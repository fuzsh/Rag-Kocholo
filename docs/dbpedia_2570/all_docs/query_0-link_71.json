He was a widely respected jazz instrumentalist on piano and organ; he composed music for three Broadway shows and many hit songs, among them \"Ain't Misbehavin',\" \"Honeysuckle Rose,\" and \"Black and Blue\"; he was among the most successful recording artists of the 1930s, scoring 23 Top Ten hits between 1934 and 1940, including \"A Little Bit Independent,\" \"All My Life,\" \"Two Sleepy People,\" and \"I'm Gonna Sit Right Down and Write Myself a Letter\"; and his engaging, humorous personality was displayed onstage, on film, and in concerts. [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Waller's parents were Edward Martin and Adeline Lockett Waller. His father was a preacher; his mother was a keyboard player, and he learned piano, harmonium, and organ at a young age. He left high school in the spring of 1918 and was hired as the organist at the Lincoln Theatre. In 1919 he wrote his first tune, \"Boston Blues,\" which became \"Squeeze Me\" when Clarence Williams added lyrics to it several years later. When Waller's mother died in November 1920, he moved in with the family of the pianist Russell Brooks, who introduced him to famed stride pianist James P. Johnson. He studied with Johnson and also later claimed to have taken lessons from pianist Leopold Godowsky and to have studied composition with Carl Bohm of the Juilliard School of Music. [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Around this time he married Edith Hatchett, and the couple had a son, Thomas Waller Jr. However, Waller and Hatchett separated and divorced within a few years. Waller married Anita Rutherford in 1926, and they had two sons, Maurice and Ronald. Each of Waller's sons became a musician. Waller made his first solo recordings, \"Muscle Shoals Blues\" and \"Birmingham Blues,\" on Oct. 21, 1922. By the mid-1920s he was recording and performing onstage and on the radio while writing songs and contributing to revues in Harlem. Keep Shufflin' (N.Y., Feb. 27, 1928) was an all-black revue that ran on Broadway for 104 performances; Waller and James P. Johnson wrote the music and played piano in the pit orchestra. Waller broke through to success as a composer in 1929, primarily with his tunes from the all-black Broadway revue Hot Chocolates (N.Y., June 20, 1929), which ran for 228 performances and introduced his most popular songs. \"Ain't Misbehavin'\" (music also by Harry Brooks, lyrics by Andy Razaf) earned many recordings, the most successful of which was the one by Leo Reisman and His Orchestra, though Waller's own instrumental treatment was popular and later was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame. The score also contained \"Black and Blue\" (music also by Harry Brooks, lyrics by Andy Razaf) and \"Honeysuckle Rose\" (lyrics by Andy Razaf), both of which became standards. [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]In August 1929, Gene Austin scored a hit with Waller's \"I've Got a Feeling I'm Falling\" (music also by Harry Link, lyrics by Billy Rose); Waller played piano on the recording. The song became his first to be featured in a motion picture when Helen Morgan sang it in Applause, released in October. During the Depression years of the early 1930s, Waller continued to enjoy occasional success as a songwriter. \"Rollin' Down the River\" (lyrics by Stanley Adams), written for a revue at the nightclub Connie's WALLER c0' Inn in Harlem, became a hit for Guy Lombardo and His Royal Canadians in July 1930; \"Keepin' Out of Mischief Now\" (lyrics by Andy Razaf), a song patterned after \"Ain't Misbehavin',\" was a hit for Louis Armstrong in June 1932; and \"Honeysuckle Rose\" was revived by Fletcher Henderson for a hit in February 1933. Meanwhile, Waller's primary outlet as a performer was radio, as he appeared regularly on such shows as Paramount on Parade (1930-31); Radio Roundup (1931-32); and, from station WLW in Cincinnati, Fats Waller's Rhythm Club (1932-34). In May 1934, Waller began a series of recordings for RCA Victor backed by a quintet under the name Fats Waller and His Rhythm. [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]It was with these recordings, along with frequent appearances on the CBS radio network, that he established himself as a singer and personality, while his composing and instrumental skills were less emphasized. The approach led to a string of hits. In 1934 he scored in June with \"I Wish I Were Twins\" (music by Joseph Meyer, lyrics by Frank Loesser and Eddie DeLange); in September with \"Then I'll Be Tired of You\" (music by Arthur Schwartz, lyrics by E. Y. Harburg); and in October with \"Don't Let It Bother You\" (music by Harry Revel, lyrics by Mack Gordon) and \"Sweetie Pie\" (music and lyrics by John Jacob Loeb). Also in October, he had a minor hit with his own composition \"How Can You Face Me?\" [lyrics by Andy Razaf]. In 1935, Waller continued to score frequent hits, including \"Believe It, Beloved\" (music by J. C. Johnson, lyrics by George Whiting and Nat Schwartz) in January; \"I Believe in Miracles\" (music by George W. Meyer and Pete Wendling, lyrics by Sam M. Lewis) in February; \"Lulu's Back in Town\" (music by Harry Warren, lyrics by Al Dubin) in July; \"Truckin'\" (music by Rube Bloom, lyrics by Ted Koehler) in August; and \"Rhythm and Romance\" (music by J. C. Johnson, lyrics by George Whiting and Nat Burton) in September. [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]His most successful recording of the year was\"A Little Bit Independent\" (music by Joe Burke, lyrics by Edgar Leslie), which reached the top of the hit parade in December. Waller appeared in two 1935 films, Hooray for Love, released in July, and King of Burlesque, which opened in December. Waller's hot streak extended through the middle of 1936, including such Top Ten hit parade entries as \"I'm Gonna Sit Right Down and Write Myself a Letter\" (music by Fred E. Ahlert, lyrics by Joe Young) in· February; \"West Wind\" (music and lyrics by Milton Ager, Charles Newman, and Murray Mencher) in March; \"All My Life\" (music by Sam H. Stept, lyrics by Sidney Mitchell) in April; \"It's a Sin to Tell a Lie\" (music and lyrics by Billy Mayhew) in May; \"Let's Sing Again\" (music by Jimmy McHugh, lyrics by Gus Kahn) and \"Cross Patch\" (music by Vee Lawnhurst, lyrics by Tot Seymour) in July; and \"You're Not the Kind\" (music and lyrics by Will Hudson and Irving Mills) and \"Bye, Bye, Baby\" (music by Lou Handman, lyrics by Walter Hirsch) in August. [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]With the onset of the Swing Era in the second half of the 1930s, Waller's music became less fashionable, but he still was able to reach the hit parade at least once a year through the end of the decade, with \"You're Laughing at Me\" (music and lyrics by Irving Berlin) in March 1937; \"I Love to Whistle\" (music by Jimmy McHugh, lyrics by Harold Adamson) in April 1938; \"Two Sleepy People\" (music by Hoagy Carmichael, lyrics by Frank Loesser) in November 1938; \"Good for Nothing\" (music by Jimmy Van Heusen, lyrics by Eddie DeLange) in March 1939; and \"Little Curly in a High Chair\" (music by Nat Simon, lyrics by Charles Tobias) in June 1940. Waller continued to tour during this period, performing in Europe from July to October 1938 and from March to June 1939. For a time in the early 1940s he acceded to current trends and led a big band. He scored his final hit as a recording artist in November 1942 with his own organ instrumental \"The Jitterbug Waltz,\" which reached the Top Ten on the R&Bcharts. Waller wrote the music for the Broadway musical Early to Bed (June 17, 1943), which, with a run of 380 performances, was his most successful show during his lifetime. He appeared in the all-black movie musical Stormy Weather, released in July 1943, performing his signature song, \"Ain't Misbehavin'.\" [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]He was on a train returning from Los Angeles to N.Y. after a club engagement in Hollywood when he succumbed to pneumonia in December at the age of 39. \"Ain't Misbehavin',\" Waller's most popular song, was heard frequently in the years immediately after his death. It turned up in the August 1944 film Atlantic City and again in the film You Were Meant for Me in January 1948. In March 1948, Dinah Washington scored a Top Ten R&Bhit with a revival of the song, which was also used in the films Rainbow 'round My Shoulder (1952), Gentlemen Marry Brunettes (1955), and, of course, Ain't Misbehavin' (1955). [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]A major Waller revival in the 1970s kicked off with Waller's co-scoring credit for the avant-garde film Eraserhead (1976). The Broadway revue Bubbling Brown Sugar (N.Y., March 2, 1976) used some Waller music, and a second revue, Ain't Misbehavin' (N.Y., May 8, 1978), was devoted to his songs; it ran 1,604 performances and that spawned a charted cast album. Waller was taken up by country musicians in the 1980s: Willie Nelson starred in a movie called Honeysuckle Rose in 1981 (though he did not perform the song on the soundtrack), and in 1986 Hank Williams Jr. revived \"Ain't Misbehavin'\" for a #1 country hit. Waller returned to Broadway with selections from another longrunning all-black revue, Black and Blue (N.Y., Jan. 26, 1989). - Died at Kansas City, Dec. 15, 1943.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]in 1906 - Willy Ferrero, American-born Italian conductor and composer, is born at Portland, Maine. He appeared as a conductor at the Teatro Costanzi in Rome at 6, and then conducted with great success throughout Europe at 8. After studies at the Vienna Academy of Music (graduated, 1924), he resumed his career but never fulfilled his early promise. He wrote a symphonic poem, II mistero dell'aurora, and some chamber music. - Died at Rome, March 24, 1954.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]in 1907 - Konstantin Ivanov, Russian conductor and composer, is born at Efremov. He played trumpet in Soviet cavalry orchestras, then enrolled in the conducting class at the Moscow Conservatory. After graduation in 1937, he served as asst. conductor at various operatic and symphony posts. From 1941 to 1946 he was conductor of the Bolshoi Radio Orchestra, and from 1946 to 1975 conductor of the State Symphony Orchestra of the U.S.S.R. He made world tours with the latter organization, which included the U.S. and Japan, as well as countries of Western Europe. He wrote several symphonic poems and a Double Bass Concerto. - Died at Moscow, April 15, 1984.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]\n\nin 1913 - Gina Bachauer, eminent Greek-born English pianist of Austrian descent, is born at Athens. She showed her aptitude as a pianist at age five; entered the Athens Conservatory, where her teacher was Waldemar Freeman. She then went to Paris, where she took lessons with Cortot at the Ecole Normale de Musique. In 1933 she won the Medal of Honor at the Vienna International Competition; between 1933 and 1935 she received occasional instructions from Rachmaninoff in France and Switzerland; in 1935 she made her professional debut with the Athens Symphony Orchestra under the direction of Mitropoulos; she was also piano soloist in Paris in 1937 with Monteux. [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]During World War II she lived in Alexandria, Egypt, and played several hundred concerts for the Allied Forces in the Middle East. On Jan. 21, 1946, she made her London debut with the New London Orchestra under the direction of Alec Sherman, who became her second husband. Her first American appearance took place in N.Y. on Oct. 15, 1950. Only 35 people attended this concert, but she received unanimous acclaim from the critics, and her career was assured. The uncommon vigor of her technique suggested comparisons with Teresa Carreno; her repertoire ranged from Mozart to Stravinsky; in both standard and modern works, she displayed impeccable taste. She died of a heart attack in Athens on the day she was to appear as soloist with the National Symphony Orchestra of Washington, D.C., at the Athens Festival. In 1976 the Gina Bachauer International Piano Competition was founded in Salt Lake City. - Died at Athens, Aug. 22, 1976.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]\n\nin 1916 - Lydia Mendoza (US guitarist and singer of Tejano music) is born.\n\nin 1918 - Dennis Day/Owen Patrick Eugene McNulty (US singer, comedian) is born.[/FONT]\n\n[ame=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWh0H0ExuPE\"][FONT=&quot]Danny Boy - Dennis Day - YouTube[/FONT][/ame][FONT=&quot] [/FONT]​\n\n​\n\n[FONT=&quot]\n\nin 1920 - Bill Barber (US jazz tuba player; Miles Davis/John Coltrane/others) is born.\n\nVideo Notes:\n\nExemplary television program with the Miles Davis Quintet featuring John Coltrane, Wynton Kelly, Paul Chambers and Jimmy Cobb, and including the Gil Evans Orchestra.

Pioneering black producer and songwriter at King Records, Arkansas-native Henry Glover quit graduate school in the late Thirties to join the jump-blues bands of Buddy Johnson and Tiny Bradshaw. While working as an arranger and trumpet player for Lucky Millinder's R&B orchestra in the mid Forties, Glover wrote and co-penned the R&B hit 'I Love You Yes I Do', for Millinder's vocalist Bull Moose Jackson at King/Queen Records. Retained at King by label head, Syd Nathan, Glover was named vice-president, overseeing many of the King's early R&B acts including Wynonie Harris and Little Willie John. Glover also travelled to Nashville to record country acts such as Moon Mullican and The Delmore Brothers. Leaving King Records in 1956, Glover produced hit records for Bobby \"Blue\" Bland, Arthur Prysock, and The Fiestas. After briefly operating his own label in the early Sixties, Glover landed at Roulette Records as the head of the A&R department, where he produced The Essex, Sonny Stitt, Dinah Washington, and co-wrote 'Peppermint Twist', for a group he discovered, Joey Dee & The Starliters. (Heart attack) - Died April 7, 1991 at N.Y. city.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]\n\nin 1926 - Albert Grossman (US artist manager; Dylan/Joplin/many others) is born.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Folk and rock music impresario, Albert Grossman is best known for managing Bob Dylan during the Sixties. Born in Chicago to Russian-Jewish immigrants, Grossman was fired from a position in the Chicago Housing Authority in the early Fifties (he would later falsely claim to have earned a business degree). Joining a friend in opening The Gate Of Horn, a pioneering Chicago folk and blues venue, Grossman booked acts such as Big Bill Broonzy. Turning his attention to management, Grossman oversaw the career of a frequent performer at his club, folk-blues singer Odetta. After co-directing the inaugural Newport Folk Festival, Grossman moved to New York City where he frequented the folk clubs of Greenwich Village. Assembling Peter, Paul & Mary, Grossman also brought them their biggest hit, the Bob Dylan composition 'Blowin' In The Wind'. Signing Dylan to a 10-year contract in 1962, Grossman gave himself a healthy percentage of the performer's earnings. [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Legendary for his evasiveness with the press and for his negotiating skills, Grossman was captured at his best in the Dylan documentary Don't Look Back, particularly during his bartering with London agent Tito Burns. Tutoring and inviting Dylan into his home for two years, Grossman was crucial in the marketing of the brilliant folk singer. Accused of orchestrating Dylan's switch from acoustic to electric music, Grossman got into a backstage brawl with researcher Alan Lomax over the issue at the 1965 Newport Folk Festival. Also that year, Grossman and Dylan launched their own music publishing company. [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]With the signing of Janis Joplin, Grossman increased his stable of acts, which also included John Lee Hooker, Ian & Sylvia, Gordon Lightfoot, and Dylan's perennial backing group, The Band. By the late Sixties, Goldman was losing many of his star acts. Dylan left Grossman in 1969, the relationship dissolved by a court two years later; in 1970 Peter, Paul & Mary disbanded; and in 1971 Joplin died of an overdose. Moving away from the music industry, Grossman settled in rural Woodstock, in upstate New York. There he launched his own record label, Bearsville Records, signing Todd Rundgren, Foghat and Jesse Winchester. He died while asleep on a flight to London, January 25, 1986. (Heart attack).[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]in 1927 - Morris Levy (MOISHE LEVY) is born. A notorious music business mogul who was involved in the many facets of the industry, Morris Levy built an extremely lucrative business empire, principally in song publishing. Born in the Bronx, Levy received little formal education but quickly progressed through the ranks of the East Coast crime underworld. In his first major acquisition, Levy joined eight partners in 1949 in opening the legendary Birdland nightclub in Manhattan. When agents of BMI and ASCAP came in and demanded royalty fees for playing music in his venue, his first thought was that a rival mob was moving in on his operation. Realising that their \"collections\" were legally enforceable, Levy expanded into different aspects of the music industry, including jukebox companies, record distribution, label ownership and publishing. [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]With his ties to major underworld figures (the FBI cited connections between him and the Genovese family), Levy built a massive web of businesses that included Roulette and several other record labels. His first publishing success would come with the George Shearing composition 'Lullabye Of Birdland'. Levy also earned much press in the mid Fifties when he teamed up with the charismatic deejay and promoter Alan Freed.

After a brief stint as a talk-show host, in 1961 Donahue arrived in San Francisco, rejoining former fellow deejay Bobby Mitchell at Top 40 AM powerhouse, KYA. Entering concert promotion, Donahue and Mitchell booked acts such as The Beach Boys and The Beatles. The pair also started their own record label, Autumn Records, hiring the fledgling Sly Stone as producer, and landing on the charts with The Beau Brummels, Bobby Freeman, and The Mojo Men. Opening the city's first psychedelic nightclub, Donahue began experimenting with LSD. Quitting his position at KYA and closing Autumn Records, Donahue yearned to create an alternative to adolescent-targeted, Top 40 radio fare. [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Gradually taking over the near-bankrupt KMPX in April 1967, Tom \"Big Daddy\" Donahue (his nickname derived from his imposing 400-pound frame) introduced his free-form format, picking his own playlist across genre lines in which long, obscure album tracks were preferable to Top 40 hits. The genesis of the Album-Oriented Rock (AOR) format, KMPX also spouted anti-establishment political rhetoric and anti-war sentiment. But following a tense employee strike in 1968, the KMPX staff quit en masse, transplanting the station at cross-town rival KSFR, whose call letters were changed to KSAN. Spawning a series of local, then national imitators, Donahue's underground radio format was considered mainstream by the mid Seventies. Although KSAN was popular, the station made little money until 1972. In 1991, San Francisco began a radio-awards gala called the Donahue Awards.

Active almost exclusively in the German-speaking world from the mid-1930s, he was a controversial figure for his actions during the Second World War and his success in Nazi Germany. Heesters was considered one of the oldest stage performers in history.\n\nHeesters was born in Amersfoort, Netherlands, the youngest of four sons. His father Jacobus Heesters (1865–1946) was a salesman and his mother Geertruida Jacoba van den Heuvel (1866–1951), a homemaker.\n\nHeesters was fluent in German from a very early age having lived for several years in the household of a German great uncle from Bavaria. Heesters decided to become an actor and a singer at the age of sixteen and began vocal training. Heesters specialized in Viennese operetta very early in his career, and made his Viennese stage debut in 1934 in Carl Millöcker's Der Bettelstudent (The Beggar Student).\n\nAged 31, Heesters permanently moved to Germany with his wife and daughters in 1935. During his time there, he performed for Adolf Hitler and visited the Dachau concentration camp which made him a controversial figure for many Dutch. Joseph Goebbels placed Heesters on the Gottbegnadeten list as an artist considered crucial to Nazi culture.\n\nHeesters is known to have funded the German war machine by donating money to the weapons industry. While he became a very controversial figure in the late 1970s, Heesters always denied these accusations despite reliable evidence.\n\nHeesters befriended several high-ranking Nazi-officials and SS-officers. Mr. \"Jopie\" also performed regularly for people such as Hitler and Goering, with the former being known to have been an avid admirer of his acting skills. Throughout the war Heesters continued to perform for German soldiers in camps and barracks. He always denied having visited concentration camps, although he did have knowledge of their existence.\n\nAccording to German author Volker Kühn, Heesters did in fact perform for the SS in Dachau concentration camp. For this claim he uses as evidence the testimony of Dachau inmate Viktor Matejka who worked for the SS and told Kühn he pulled the curtain when Heesters performed in 1941. According to German writer Jürgen Trimborn however, the interview with Matejka may not be reliable as it occurred some fifty years after the performance was said to have taken place. In December 2009, Heesters lost his libel suit against Kühn. While acknowledging having visited the camp, Heesters denied having performed as entertainment for the SS troops. In its ruling, the German court did not find that Kühn's allegations were true, but rather that too much time had passed for an accurate determination of fact to be made.\n\nHeesters' signature tune was Count Danilo Danilovitch's entrance song \"Da geh' ich ins Maxim\" from Franz Lehár's Die Lustige Witwe (The Merry Widow). He met Hitler several times and was reportedly Hitler's favorite actor in the role of Danilo.\n\nHeesters worked extensively for UFA until almost the end of the Second World War (his last wartime movie being Die Fledermaus, produced in 1945) and easily made the transition from the Nazi-controlled cultural scene to post-war Germany and Austria, appearing again in a number of films. These included Die Jungfrau auf dem Dach and the 1957 version of Viktor und Viktoria. Heesters stopped making movies around 1960 to concentrate on stage and television appearances and on producing records.\n\nIn later years Heesters spoke fondly of Hitler as a person, but condemned his political stance. In the 1990s, he and his wife toured Germany and Austria with Curth Flatow's play Ein gesegnetes Alter (A Blessed Age), which was also televised in 1996. On 5 December 2003, he celebrated his 100th birthday with a television special Eine Legende wird 100 (A legend turns 100) on the ARD television channel.\n\nOn his 100th birthday Heesters received the title \"Kammersänger\". In December 2004, aged 101, Heesters appeared in Stuttgart at the Komödie im Marquardt theatre in a show commissioned on the occasion of his 100th birthday, Heesters – eine musikalische Hommage. In 2005 aged 102 he was featured as a soloist in a major concert tour with the Deutsches Filmorchester Babelsberg under the direction of Scott Lawton.\n\nOn 5 December 2006 Heesters celebrated his 103rd birthday with a concert at the Wiener Konzerthaus. On 5 December 2007 he celebrated his 104th birthday with a concert at the Admiralspalast, Berlin, and in February 2008 he performed in his home country for the first time in four decades amidst protests against his Nazi associations.\n\nHeesters apologised for calling Adolf Hitler a \"good chap\" on the popular German TV show Wetten, dass..? on Saturday, 13 December 2008, aged 105. He said that he had said something stupid and horrible and asked for forgiveness. In addition, German media suggested that he had failed to understand the show's satirical nature.\n\nHeesters became less active in his last years and played smaller roles, as he began to lose his eyesight due to macular degeneration and could not perform on stage for long periods of times. Unable to read a teleprompter, he had to memorize his lines before a show.\n\n\"My secret to a long, healthy life is love and passion; age differences do not matter.\"\n\n—Johannes Heesters, December 2010\n\nHeesters had two daughters by his first wife Louisa Ghijs, whom he married in 1930. After her death in 1985, he remarried in 1992; his second wife, Simone Rethel (born 1949), is a German actress, painter, and photographer. His younger daughter Nicole Heesters is a well-known actress in the German-speaking world, as is his granddaughter Saskia Fischer.\n\nIn December 2010, the 107-year-old Heesters announced that he had quit smoking for his then 61-year-old wife: \"She should have me as long as possible.\"\n\nOn 1 January 2008, he fell down some stairs in his holiday house in Tyrol and broke two ribs.\n\nOn 29 November 2011, he suddenly fell ill, developing a fever, and was rushed into hospital. He was operated on to fit a heart pacemaker and following a good recovery, was allowed home less than a week later, on 4 December, in time to spend his 108th birthday the next day with family. He did not feel strong enough to make the planned stage appearance to sing in celebration of his birthday and also had missed the premiere of his latest film, Ten. Due to a relapse in his condition, on 17 December he was readmitted to hospital, where he subsequently suffered a stroke, dying on Christmas Eve 2011. He is survived by two daughters, five grandchildren, eleven great-grandchildren and three great-great-grandchildren.[/FONT]\n\n[ame=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcwdKobvYVg&feature=related\"][FONT=&quot]Johannes Heesters - Operettenmelodien - YouTube[/FONT][/ame][FONT=&quot] [/FONT]​\n\n​\n\n[FONT=&quot]in 1943 - Hilton Valentine, guitar, The Animals, (1964 UK & US No.1 single 'House Of The Rising Sun'). s born.\n\nin 1943 - John Dalton, The Kinks, (1964 UK No.1 & US No.7 'You Really Got Me', 1967 UK No.2 single 'Waterloo Sunset' plus 19 other UK Top 40 singles) is born.\n\nin 1943 - Vincent Crane, keyboards, The Crazy world of Arthur Brown, (1968 UK No.1 and US No.12 single 'Fire'), Atomic Rooster, (1971 UK No.4 single 'The Devil's Answer'), is born.

In 1923 he performed in Poland and Germany, then moved to Paris, where he would perform before the Russian émigré clientele at Montmartre cabarets for nine years. In 1926 he made one of the earliest recordings of the song \"Dorogoi dlinnoyu\"/\"Endless Road\" (which, with English lyrics by was a major hit for Mary Hopkin in 1968 as Those Were the Days). After several successful tours in the Middle East, Vertinsky followed the majority of well-to-do Russians to the USA, where he debuted before the audience which included Rachmaninoff, Chaliapin, and Marlene Dietrich. In 1943 the Soviet government allowed Alexander to return to Russia. Despite lack of media coverage, he performed about two thousand concerts in the USSR, touring from Sakhalin to Kaliningrad. In order to feed his family, he also appeared in Soviet films, often playing prerevolutionary aristocrats, as in the screen version of Chekhov's \"Anna on the Neck\"-1955.

After recording some demos with neighbourhood rap group OGB, he was discovered by Big Daddy Kane's deejay, Mister Cee. Soon hyped by The Source magazine, Notorious B.I.G. was signed by Puffy Combs to Uptown Records. Switching to Combs' new Bad Boy Entertainment label, Notorious B.I.G. chronicled his violent past on his début, million-selling album Ready To Die. Frequently in trouble on charges of drug possession and assault, he was voted top rapper of the year in 1995 at the Billboard Awards; he also claimed best rap single for 'One More Chance'/'Stay With Me'.

Sitting in the passenger seat of his GMC Suburban, he was struck by a shower of bullets fired from a passing vehicle.

As both an orchestra leader and a solo singer, Monroe successfully straddled the Swing Era and the \"sing era\" that followed it in popular music. His sonorous baritone did well with ballads such as \"There! I've Said It Again\" and \"I Wish I Didn't Love You So\" and worked equally well on specialty material such as the seasonal \"Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow!\" and the Western-themed \"Riders in the Sky (A Cowboy Legend),\" both of which were chart-topping hits for him. All told, Monroe had 25 Top-Ten hits between 1940 and 1954.

Although he aspired to become an opera singer, he began singing and playing in dance bands around Pittsburgh to help pay for his tuition at the Carnegie Institute of Technology, which he attended from 1929 to 1932. He dropped out of school to play with the orchestra of Austin Wylie in Cleveland, then worked with Larry Funk's Orchestra from 1933 to 1936 while taking courses at the New England Conservatory of Music.

(After two years he was promoted to the main label.) His first hit, \"There I Go\" (music by Irving Weiser, lyrics by Hy Zart), peaked in the Top Ten in December 1940. In the spring of 1941 he gained national attention with an appearance at Frank Dailey's Meadowbrook in Cedar Grove, N.J., one of the premier venues for swing bands, and he performed from the hall in the first remote broadcast on the national radio series Matinee at Meadowbrook on May 24.

That October he finally scored a second Top Ten hit with \"My Devotion\" (music and lyrics by Roc Hillman and Johhny Napton), then returned to the Top Ten in December with the war-themed \"When the Lights Go on Again (All over the World)\" (music and lyrics by Eddie Seiler, Sol Marcus, and Bennie Benjamin). Like other recording artists, Monroe was stymied by the musicians' union recording ban that prevailed during the war years, but he paired with his female vocal group, the Four Lee Sisters, for an a cappella recording of \"Let's Get Lost\" (music by Jimmy McHugh, lyrics by Frank Loesser) that reached the Top Ten in June 1943. [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]He appeared with his band in the motion picture Meet the People, released in September 1944. With the lifting of the ban in November 1944, he quickly scored several Top Ten hits, including a duet with his female singer, Marilyn Duke, on \"The Trolley Song\" (music and lyrics by Hugh Martin and Ralph Blane) in January 1945; \"Rum and Coca-Cola\" (music and lyrics by Morey Amsterdam, Paul Baron, and Jeri Sullivan, based on a song with music and lyrics by Massie Patterson and Lionel Belasco) in March; and \"There! I've Said It Again\" (music and lyrics by Redd Evans and Dave Mann), which went to #1 in May and sold a million copies. In November he topped the album charts with On the Moonbeam. Monroe's recording of \"Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow!\" (music by Jule Styne, lyrics by Sammy Cahn) hit #1 in January 1946 and became a seasonal standard. He returned to the Top Ten in April with \"Seems Like Old Times\" (music and lyrics by Carmen Lombardo and John Jacob Loeb). [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]His popularity led to his hosting the long-running radio series The Camel Caravan starting on July 4,1946. Running for nearly eight years, it was also known as The Vaughn Monroe Show. The series, in turn, boosted his popularity further, and he scored many hit recordings during the next three years. His album Vaughn Monroe's Dreamland was a Top Ten hit in November 1946. In May 1947 he appeared in the film Carnegie Hall, then reached the Top Ten of the singles charts with \"I Wish I Didn't Love You So\" (music and lyrics by Frank Loesser), \"Kokomo, Indiana\" (music by Josef Myrow, lyrics by Mack Gordon) in October, and \"You Do\" (music by Myrow, lyrics by Gordon) in November. He then topped the charts with the millionselling \"Ballerina\" (music and lyrics by Bob Russell and Carl Sigman) in December. In 1948, \"How Soon? (Will I Be Seeing You)\" (music and lyrics by Carroll Lucas and Jack Owens) became a Top Ten single in January. The album Down Memory Lane hit #1 in March, and \"Cool Water\" (music and lyrics by Bob Nolan) reached the Top Ten in October. [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Due to a second recording ban, Monroe recorded the Western-styled \"Cool Water\" a cappella with the Sons of the Pioneers. Monroe enjoyed his most successful year as a recording artist in 1949. In January his album Vaughn Monroe Sings went to #1. In April, \"Red Roses for a Blue ....\" (music and lyrics by Sid Tepper and Roy Brodsky) was in the Top Ten. The biggest hit of his career was \"Riders in the Sky (A Cowboy Legend)\" (music and lyrics by Stan Jones), which topped the charts in May and was the most popular song of the year. The album Silver Lining made the Top Ten in August. \"Someday\" (music and lyrics by Jimmie Hodges) hit #1 in September. \"That Lucky Old Sun (Just Rolls around Heaven All Day)\" (music by Beasley Smith, lyrics by Haven Gillespie) was in the Top Ten in October, and his version of \"Mule Train\" (music and lyrics by Johnny Lange, Hy Heath, and Fred Glickman) reached the Top Ten in December. Monroe was back in the Top Ten with \"Bamboo\" (music by Nat Simon, lyrics by Buddy Bernier) in February 1950, but his success on radio and records brought him other opportunities that prevented him from doing much recording during the year. He starred in the Western film Singing Guns, released in June, appeared with his orchestra at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in N.Y. in September, and launched a television version of his Camel Caravan radio series in October. The show ran through the 1950-51 season. [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Monroe returned to the Top Ten in the spring of 1951 with a series of novelty records: \"Sound Off (The Duckworth Chant)\" (music and lyrics by Willie Lee Duckworth, based on an Army marching drill), \"On Top of Old Smokey\" (music and lyrics by Pete Seeger, based on the traditional folk song), and \"Old Soldiers Never Die\" (music and lyrics by Tom Glazer, inspired by General Douglas MacArthur's speech to Congress after being dismissed from duty in Korea). He appeared in a second Western film, The Toughest Man in Arizona, in October 1952. He disbanded his orchestra in 1953 and began to appear as a solo singer. His radio series ended in April 1954. hi August, The Vaughn Monroe Show went back on television as a twice-a-week, 15-minute summer replacement show; it also ran during the summer of 1955. [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Monroe scored a final Top Ten hit with \"They Were Doin' the Mambo\" (music and lyrics by Don Raye and Sonny Burke) in October 1954 and continued to reach the charts occasionally through 1959. During the 1956-57 television season he hosted the musical variety series Air Time '57, and he also appeared on TV as a spokesman for RCA. By the 1960s, Monroe had largely retired from music, though he made occasional appearances, especially in Las Vegas. He owned and managed the Meadows, a club and restaurant in Framingham, Mass. He died at the age of 61 in 1973 after a long illness. In the 1990s a Vaughn Monroe ghost orchestra under the direction of Bill Davies was active.

Born July 12th 1941.[/FONT]\n\n​\n\n[FONT=&quot]in 2013 – Bob Thompson, Jazz musican dies at age 88. [/FONT][FONT=&quot]Though he grew up in New York City, pianist Bob Thompson of Local 136 (Charleston, WV) has called West Virginia home ever since his college years. He entered West Virginia State College as a trumpeter, but began playing piano seriously in order to play in the school's jazz band, which already had a trumpet player. Last year his Mountain State roots were officially affirmed when he was inducted into the West Virginia Music Hall of Fame.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Since the 1970s, Thompson has led a series of bands, releasing a steady stream of jazz CDs and performing around the world. He's also held a 23-year position as house pianist for National Public Radio's Mountain Stage. Thompson's history with the internationally broadcast show goes back to 1983, when he was a guest artist for the pilot. He returned frequently as a guest. In 1991, when the house pianist left, Thompson took over the job on a temporary basis.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]\"I enjoy doing the show; it's a lot of fun,\" he says, explaining that the variety of music is one reason he's stayed with it. \"We have everything from Appalachian or bluegrass music to jazz to a lot of singer-songwriters, plus music from other parts of the world. Guests, for the most part, are people who are about to become well known on a national basis; many folks had their first appearance on Mountain Stage, and then, after that, you see them everywhere. Plus, a lot of established artists come back and continue to do the show.\"[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Among Thompson's most memorable Mountain Stage moments, he recalls a special show with Hugh Masekela just after the 1994 election of South African President Nelson Mandela. \"He had his band from South Africa with him and this was their first performance after the election. It turned into a celebration!\" recalls Thompson. Other shows have had him sharing the stage with musicians like Courtney Pine, John Blake, Larry Coryell, and others.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Another project Thompson has been long involved with is co-production of the annual holiday jazz show, Joy to the World. Over its 20-plus-year run, what began as a small, local celebration, now includes three shows that are recorded and edited, then broadcast as a one-hour program on Public Radio and Voice of America.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]\"For a lot of people, it begins their Christmas season,\" he says of the show covering holiday tunes that range from classic to obscure. \"We try to give them a jazz treatment, but are careful not to take them too far from their roots.\" Each year the show features a special guest singer. Among past guests are Fontella Bass, Catherine Russell of Local 802 (New York City), Mollie O'Brien, and Heather Masse of Local 1000 (Nongeographic).[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Thompson first joined the union in 1964, about the same time he founded his first band, the Modern Jazz Interpreters. \"It was real helpful to me, especially in my early days; it opened up a lot of avenues to me,\" he says. \"I grew up in New York City. There were so many great musicians in my neighborhood. I just wanted to be like them and I saw that union membership was very important to them.\"[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] That first trio played the Notre Dame Jazz Festival in 1964; and toured Algeria, Nigeria, and Europe. From the 1970s through the 1980s, Thompson released a series of acclaimed contemporary jazz albums.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]When Thompson and his current band, The Bob Thompson Band, set out to create his latest CD, Look Beyond the Rain, it was a new direction and their first release with vocals. The project has an uplifting message. \"It's going to rain in your life,\" he says. \"You have to look beyond the rain because there are better times coming.\"[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] Among the hopeful tunes, \"You Are a Traveler,\" written and sung by Thompson, is about enjoying where you are today in life, he explains. \"It's about the journey, enjoying every day and the process.\"[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]The CD's opening tune, \"Time to Be One,\" is about the division that continues to develop in the country, he explains. \"It is discouraging and I wondered what I could do about it. All we can do is play music, and I think, as musicians and artists, we need to try to bring people together with music.\"[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]The CD is just the latest project for the group of musicians, all members of Local 136, who have played together for a number of years. Thompson first played with saxophonist Doug Payne in the 1980s; 41-year-old drummer Tim Courts has been with Thompson since he was 20 years old; guitarist Ryan Kennedy has played with Thompson ever since graduating from Berklee 12 years ago, and the \"newest\" band member, 31-year-old bassist John Inghram, has been in Thompson's band for around 10 years.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]\"It's more like we are a little family. One thing I enjoy about the band is its diversity in terms of ages; everybody brings something different to the table,\" says Thompson.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Even with all his performances, Thompson takes time to pass on his knowledge to the next generation. He explains that, for him, the rewards of teaching are two-fold: \"In order to teach somebody, you have to crystallize things in your mind; I always learn something from teaching. The other thing is that, when I started out, a lot of people gave me help along the way. So I feel like I'm just passing that along. If we don't teach and give to other people, the music is going to die.\"[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]He says that, as a young player he got some valuable advice from Henry Jerome. Early in his career, Thompson used some New York music connections to set up an appointment with the then-president of United Artists. He brought a tape of some music he'd recorded. Jerome said that he liked the music, and invited him to come again, but also said, \"When you do come back, bring something that, if I want to put it out, I have to have you to do it.\"[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]At first, Thompson found the advice discouraging. \"Then I realized that he was trying to tell me, 'be yourself, do something unique, make it your own,'\" says Thompson. \"I think that's one of the best pieces of advice I got from anybody in the music business.\"[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Today, Thompson advises students along those same lines. \"Try to figure out how to create your own career. Often people who go into music have stars in their eyes, thinking they are going to be big musical stars. It's really about every day being the best you can be and trying to figure out, economically, how you can make it work,\" he says.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]\"Go somewhere where there is no music being played and try to create a situation there for yourself. That allows you to build your own audience. Also, have some purpose for what you are doing. It's not all about the money; it's about what you are doing and what you are giving to people,\" he says.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]in 2013 – Frank Comstock, [/FONT][FONT=&quot]Emmy-nominated composer for TV shows including Adam-12 and Rocky and His Friends, and arranger for big bands and such vocalists as Doris Day and the Hi-Los, dies at age 90. [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] Comstock was among the last of the great swing-band arrangers who later found work in the film and television studios and went on to compose memorable, iconic themes familiar to generations of Americans. [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] He was born Sept. 20, 1922, in San Diego, and began playing the trombone at the age of 8. He began arranging in high school and never had a formal lesson in arranging or orchestration. Upon graduation from high school, he joined the Sonny Dunham band as trombonist-arranger and, in 1942, joined Benny Carter's band as arranger. In 1943 he joined Les Brown and His Band of Renown as chief arranger and remained in that capacity until 1965. [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] In 1947, while continuing to arrange for Brown, Comstock began freelancing in the Hollywood studios and for various record labels. Doris Day sang his arrangements with the Brown band, and that resulted in Comstock writing arrangements for her on such films as I'll See You in My Dreams (1951), On Moonlight Bay (1951), By the Light of the Silvery Moon (1953), April in Paris (1952), Calamity Jane (1953) and others. Comstock and Day remained friends to the end of his life and, as late as the 1990s, still joked about going back on the road. [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] He often went uncredited, as with his arrangement of \"I Wanna Be Loved by You\" for Marilyn Monroe in Some Like It Hot (1959) or work on The Desert Song (1953), Thoroughly Modern Millie (1967) and Finian's Rainbow (1968). He did get screen credit for his orchestrations on The Eddie Cantor Story (1953), The Helen Morgan Story (1957), The Music Man (1962), Hello, Dolly! (1969) and other films. [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] In the 1950s, Comstock became friendly with producer-star and jazz fan Jack Webb, who hired Comstock to supply the themes and underscore for his TV series The D.A.'s Man (1959), Temple Houston (1963-64), Adam-12 (1968-75) and Escape (1973). His sole Emmy nomination was for scoring the 1970 Adam-12 episode \"Elegy for a Pig.\" In addition, he scored many episodes of Pete Kelly's Blues (1959) and Dragnet (1968-70); the feature film The Last Time I Saw Archie (1961) and the TV-movies The D.A.: Murder One (1969) and The D.A.: Conspiracy to Kill (1971), all Webb productions. [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] He also wrote the theme and scores for the Dean Jones comedy Ensign O'Toole (1962-63); composed scores for such 1960s sitcoms as Gilligan's Island, McHale's Navy and F Troop; arranged much of the jukebox music heard during the early seasons of the 1970s hits Happy Days and Laverne & Shirley; and scored the TV-movie The Night That Panicked America (1975). [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] Perhaps most significantly, Comstock penned the original themes for several segments of the animated Rocky and His Friends (1959-61), specifically \"The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle,\" \"Fractured Fairy Tales,\" \"Peabody's Improbable History\" and \"Bullwinkle's Corner.\" Fellow composer Fred Steiner conducted the music in Mexico in order to save on union costs, but when producer Jay Ward learned that Comstock had retained publishing rights to the music, he ordered new themes written by Steiner that Ward's company would own, and these eventually replaced Comstock's. [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] His association with Les Brown resulted in his contributions of arrangements to Bob Hope TV specials for 15 years. Over the years, he also arranged songs for variety shows headlined by Judy Garland, Andy Williams and Carol Burnett. [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] In addition to his work in the studios, he was a busy arranger for records, especially in the 1940s, '50s and '60s. He worked with the innovative vocal group The Hi-Los, in collaboration with vocal arranger Gene Puerling, throughout the 1950s; he also wrote charts for Frankie Laine, Rosemary Clooney and other singers, and contributed arrangements for theme-park rides at Disneyland and Walt Disney World. [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] His own albums included A Young Man's Fancy (1954), Patterns (1955), the cult exotica favorite Project Comstock: Music From Outer Space (1962) and – a favorite among TV-theme collectors – TV Guide Top Television Themes (1959), on which he shared arranging duties with Warren Barker. His last known recording projects were arrangements for contemporary jazz bandleader Brian Setzer just four years ago.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]in 2013 – T[/FONT][FONT=&quot]revor Bolder[/FONT][FONT=&quot], bassist in David Bowie's 1970s backing band Spiders From Mars, died from cancer at the age of 62.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]In a statement, Bowie remembered him as \"a wonderful musician\" who had been \"a major inspiration for whichever band he was working with\".[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]His death was announced by rock band Uriah Heep, who called him \"a world-class bass player\".[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Bolder, who joined the band in 1976, stopped playing with them a few months ago due to poor health.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]\"Trevor was an all-time great, one of the outstanding musicians of his generation and one of the finest and most influential bass players that Britain ever produced,\" Uriah Heep said in a statement.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Spandau Ballet guitarist Gary Kemp also paid tribute on Twitter, writing: \"RIP another Spider from Mars, a kind and decent man, Trevor Bolder. Love and peace to his family.\"[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Bolder, who was born in Hull, East Yorkshire on 9 June 1950, joined his first band, Ronno, with guitarist Mick Ronson in 1970 after meeting on the local music scene. [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]He joined Bowie in 1971 to play on his fourth album, Hunky Dory, along with Ronson and drummer Woody Woodmansey.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]This paved the way for 1972's The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars, which launched Bowie and his bandmates into international stardom.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]They played together on the albums Aladdin Sane and Pin-Ups before Bowie separated from the Spiders From Mars and moved to the US.

He was 62.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]A native of the Kurdish city of Sanandaj (Sina) in Iranian Kurdistan, Kamandi was one of the most popular singers in the Kurdish world. His voice crossed borders and touched young and old alike. He died as he had wished: At his birthplace.\n\n[/FONT] [FONT=&quot]Kamandi, who worked for more than three decades at Radio Sina, was also a talented playwright who penned numerous television and radio plays. In later years he took to painting, and in 2012 showed his art at an exhibition in Sulaimani city, the cultural capital of the Kurdistan Region.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]\"Some people ask me, 'why don't you just stick to music, or painting, or poetry, or carving, or writing?'\" Kamandi said at a press conference during a recent visit to the Kurdistan Region. \"But what can I do when it is all burning within me? I'm not looking for them, they look for me.\"\n\n[/FONT] [FONT=&quot]Kamandi got his first writing award for best story in 1970, when he was only 18, at a contest organized by Radio Sina, where he went on to work for a quarter century. He also headed the House of Culture and Literature. [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Kamandi's traditional songs were and still are the theme music of countless documentaries and TV shows. In spring, as Kurdish families dot the mountainsides on picnic, Kamandi's music rings through the valleys and blasts out of cars.\n\n[/FONT] [FONT=&quot]In the early 1990s and just as Kurds in Iraq had gained autonomy and were busy rebuilding their villages, Kamandi's most famous song Kalabay or \"[FONT=&quot]Unripe Quince[/FONT]\" was the theme of the most popular TV program on the revival of village life.\n\n[/FONT] [FONT=&quot]The love for simple village life, spring and flowers were the main features of his music.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]\"We are born with love,\" he said to a crowd of journalists, artists, poets and many of his fans in Sulaimani. \"A person in love is the luckiest person. Love comes with a lot of headache, but it also gives pleasure. It makes you creative.\"\n\n[/FONT] [FONT=&quot]In many interviews, Kamandi said that he always wanted to be known as a poet, but he was known till the end as a singer.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Seldom does a day go by without his songs being played on one radio station or another.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]In an interview with the Kurdish magazine [FONT=&quot]Raman[/FONT] two years ago, Kamandi said modestly: \"If I die today, at least I would take with me three original songs to my name. Songs that I cannot compose and tell someone else, 'you sing them'.\"\n\n[/FONT] [FONT=&quot]In a condolence statement on Thursday Kurdistan Parliament Speaker Yousif Muhammad said that, \"The death of master Kamandi is a great loss to Kurdish art and music. From the start and for more than half a century, Kamandi served Kurdish culture with his originality.\"[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]One of Kamandi's earliest and most famous songs, [FONT=&quot]\"Sabri Gyan.\"[/FONT] was a duet with the doe-eyed Kurdish singer Shahen Talabani, which flared up more than two decades of rumors that the two were in love.\n\n[/FONT] [FONT=&quot]\"For the past 20 years I have been saying that there is no affair between me and Shahen,\" said Kamandi during his last visit to Sulaimani.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]\"I have never been in love with Shahen, but people keep saying that we have a love affair. What can I do? People want to create heroes; they want to create another Majnoon (Romeo).\"\n\n[/FONT] [FONT=&quot]Kamandi, who was for years the voice of the Kamkars Band, warned that traditional Kurdish music is under threat from Arabic and Turkish songs.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]\"Many of us today imitate the Turkish and Arab singers,\" he said. \"Many Kurdish singers just apply Kurdish lyrics to Arabic or Turkish songs, and then we call this Kurdish music. If we continue on this path, Kurdish music will collapse.\"\n\n[/FONT] [FONT=&quot]Months before his death, sitting in front of his paintings in Sulaimani, Kamandi lamented that today's young singers do not understand the meaning of traditional music.\n\n[/FONT] [FONT=&quot]He said that musicians who have returned from abroad with advanced degrees have failed to contribute to Kurdish folk music.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]\"They cannot apply what they have learned to advance Kurdish music.\"[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]\"Sometimes when you listen to our singers you cannot tell if their music is Kurdish, Arabic, or Turkish until they start singing the words.\"\n\n[/FONT] [FONT=&quot]Kamandi recorded more than 60 songs since beginning his singing career, wrote lyrics for 150 songs, authored several books of poetry and researched the lives of historical Kurdish figures. He said he could not release new albums in later years due to high production costs.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Kamandi who did not have a college education, lived his entire life in his birthplace.\n\n[/FONT] [FONT=&quot]\"Sina is the cradle of my love,\" he told [FONT=&quot]Rudaw[/FONT] in an interview in the winter of 2012. \"No place in the world is as pretty as Sina.

[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] Following the success of 'Terry', Ripley later toured with The Rolling Stones but failed to deliver another hit, moving in to a house in Hampton with seven dogs and a pig.

He had the unusual claim to fame of declaring Dorset independent from the UK. [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]A legend of the Bournemouth music scene, Mr Kitcher took this drastic step after learning that his entry for the 2009 Eurovision Song Contest, titled 'I Actually Rather Like You', would not be considered. [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]The song was a hit online, but nevertheless the BBC announced that musical maestro Andrew Lloyd Webber was to write the UK entry with the performers being chosen by a television vote. [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Mr Kitcher challenged the decision claiming it was against Eurovision rules, but to no avail. In the end he was somewhat vindicated - the UK's entry, 'It's My Time', came 23rd out of 25. [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Born in April 1962, bass player Mr Kitcher was, in his youth, at the forefront of the punk music scene in the local area.

[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Although the group garnered some interest their momentum was stalled when Mr Kitcher was involved in a serious on-stage accident. [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]In 1982 he formed a band called Agagaga and released two albums - Greenworld (1987, Blitz records) and Agamemnon (1990, Dew Records), and at around the same time he wrote the soundtrack for the documentary film \"The Last Word\", about the 1987 Frank Bruno v Joe Bugner boxing match. [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]In his younger days Mr Kitcher had combined his music-making with work as a manager at a print factory, but with the birth of his first child he devoted himself full-time to his craft, his band The Alliance, and his family. [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Renowned as an experienced and talented bass player, he supported many local acts, including as many as 30 Elvis impersonators. [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]He continued playing live until 2009 when he suffered a back injury. He was also diagnosed with osteoporosis and became a wheelchair user. Despite this he reunited with many former bandmates from his younger years and continued to release new music. [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Mr Kitcher ran MKM Digital, through which he acted as a manager and producer to many acts, often championing alternative music bands and helping them to achieve high profile live appearances and well-produced album releases.
