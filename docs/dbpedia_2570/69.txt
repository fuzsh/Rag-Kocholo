Welsh mezzo-soprano Katherine Jenkins has signed a cut-price recording contract that will see her return to Universal Music, after her former record company dropped her from what was the biggest classical music deal in Britain.

Jenkins is understood to have signed with the Universal-owned Decca label, in the aftermath of a £5.8m, three-album deal with Warner Music, which had been hailed as the moment when classical "crossover'' music would become as lucrative as rock and pop.

Jenkins, 33, who in 2011 was estimated to have built a £13m fortune, has worked hard at cultivating a wholesome image, including visiting British troops in Afghanistan as a "forces' sweetheart".

At Decca, where she is understood to have signed for a much more modest figure, she will join other so-called classical crossover artists including André Rieu and Andrea Bocelli. A spokeswoman for Decca declined to comment.

Jenkins signed with Warner in 2008 with the appeal of her mix of opera and pop arguably at its peak. She aimed to crack the US market to "take classical music to a wider audience" and dumped longtime manager Brian Lane, who helped turn her into one of the world's bestselling stars. Lane then accused her of "starting to believe her own hype".

Jenkins's first album, Premiere, became the fastest-selling classical CD of all time. However her last album, This is Christmas, only reached No 26 in the charts.

Jenkins started singing in a church choir and worked as a music teacher before signing a six-album, £1m recording contract with Universal in 2003 after executives heard a demo tape. Her management company had not returned a request for comment at the time of publication.
