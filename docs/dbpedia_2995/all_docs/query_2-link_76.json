This document discusses different approaches to doing philosophy through analyzing various philosophers' and scholars' perspectives. It begins by outlining C.D. Broad's view that philosophy involves analysis, synopsis, and synthesis. Next, it examines Buddy Seed et al.'s perspective that sees philosophy as a way of life inspired by religion. The document then notes that doing philosophy involves doubt, wonder, and reflection at different levels of abstraction. It closes by considering what can be done with philosophical insights gained, such as articulating, clarifying, and deepening understanding through techniques like metaphor and analysis.",
