        "text": "So far as I can tell, it is still common both in textbooks and in research papers, to draw the distinction between deductive and inductive arguments. Considering the centrality of the topic and the fact that no account proposed seems to solve the problems raised in this chapter, this situation appears to be rather anomalous. The inductive/deductive distinction is problematic but sets a great divide that has prevailed as a framework for study and research. One might argue that standard practice on this matter is all right because the distinction is intuitively understandable, traditional, and so practical as to be necessary. One might wish to make that case despite the problems explained here, arising for accounts based on form; necessitation or its lack; what is intended or âclaimedâ by an arguer; or the proper application of standards. But I would urge that the underlying theory is not adequate. I submit that the problems raised here remain real and important. They were keenly explored in early editions of the Informal Logic Newsletter (now Informal Logic) but have not been central in more recent discussions of informal logic and argumentation theory.\n\nIn this essay, I cite a number of examples to illustrate problems of application with various versions of this distinction. These examples indicate that one can easily find arguments, both in colloquial and academic discourse, that are hard to classify as inductive or deductive. Readers can readily test that claim for themselves, to explore the claims and considerations made here. I was especially concerned with the dichotomous nature of logical tradition on induction and deduction. The standard presumption has a positivist heritage. It was assumed (and, I suspect, still is) that the inductive/deductive distinction is both exclusive and exhaustive. That is to say, no argument is both inductive and deductive, and every argument is either inductive or deductive. At a time when many binaries are being rejected, this particular one appears to enjoy undeserved security. I argue here that its status poses dangers, especially as to the matter of exhaustiveness: the supposition that all good reasoning is either empirical or purely logical serves to distort and buttress false dilemmas of method and justification. Logical positivism is widely discredited, but its implications for the theory of argument continue to be sturdy survivors of their ancestor. Presuming exhaustiveness, one too easily ignores interesting argument types such as a priori analogy (appeals to consistency) and conductive or âbalance of considerationâ arguments. Both are common within philosophy itself. In past years, these arguments have received more attention from theorists. The question as to whether a priori analogies are deductive has been of some interest, and there have been many accounts, and many doubts expressed, concerning conductive arguments. These types of arguments, one putatively deductive, the other putatively inductive, are discussed in Chapter Four.\n\nIt is traditional to divide arguments into two basic types: deductive and inductive. The division is regarded as important, because it is thought that deductive arguments meet standards that inductive arguments do not meet, and that inductive arguments serve epistemic purposes that deductive ones cannot serve. The theory that there are two and only two kinds of argument, deductive and inductive, may be termed the positivist theory of argument. Where deductivism is monolithic, the positivist theory is dualistic. Theorists long impressed with the force of deductive arguments of course noted the importance of empirical cumulation of data, particularly in scientific work. Recognizing that an entirely deductive account of everyday and scientific knowledge was not plausible, they departed from deductivist rationalism to allow for a second type of argument based on empirical reasoning. The tradition that arguments are either deductive or inductive goes back to Aristotle and was a prominent feature of logical positivism. It fits naturally into a positivist theory of knowledge within which knowledge must come either from logic and mathematics (sources of deductive arguments) or from the empirical sciences (sources of inductive arguments).\n\n1. Versions of the Great Divide\n\nPerhaps because of this venerable tradition, there are several versions of the distinction between deductive arguments and inductive ones. For Aristotle, it was a matter of form. Deductive arguments were syllogistic in nature; inductive ones went from particular premises to universal conclusions. Aristotle’s way of putting the distinction is no longer influential today because it is regarded as too narrow. A look through contemporary texts and monographs will produce a number of different versions of the ‘inductive/deductive’ distinction. These versions differ in two ways. First, they vary in how they explain the content of the distinction. Second, they vary in strategy for applying it – some to arguments directly, some to what is ‘claimed’ for the connection in an argument, some to arguers’ intentions, and some to the standards of appraisal for arguments, rather than to arguments themselves. Here we primarily consider matters of content. In some versions, the two blend together, as will be apparent.\n\nOn some accounts, deductive arguments are those in which the premises entail the conclusion, thereby necessitating the truth of the conclusion in any case in which the premises are themselves true. Inductive arguments are those in which the premises, if true, would make it probable that the conclusion is true. Such an account is given in Wesley Salmon’s Logic. On this view, in a deductive argument:\n\nif all the premises are true, the conclusion must also be true, and\n\nall the information in the conclusion is already contained – at least implicitly – in the premises.\n\nwhereas in an inductive argument,\n\nif all the premises are true the conclusion is probably true, but not necessarily true.\n\nand\n\n2. the conclusion contains information not implicitly in the premises.1\n\nOn this version of the distinction, we have a dichotomy of good arguments. Bad arguments would fail to be either deductive or inductive, based on these definitions. If an argument has premises that are irrelevant to the conclusion, or contains an error in deductive reasoning, it will fall in neither category.\n\nA similar account is offered in Robert Neidorfâs text, Deductive Forms, where the inductive/deductive distinction is stated as follows:\n\nIn an inductive argument, the conclusion probably follows from the premises. In a deductive argument, it certainly follows. An argument which fails as deductive may nevertheless constitute a good inductive argument.2\n\nHenry Kyburg’s distinction in Probability and Inductive Logic is essentially similar: the distinction is given in terms of success and bad arguments fall into neither category.3 The account appears to be exhaustive, not for all arguments but for all good arguments. Bad arguments are in limbo.\n\nAnother way of drawing the inductive-deductive distinction puts all the bad arguments in the inductive category. On this view, deductive arguments are those in which the premises entail the conclusion. Inductive arguments are all the rest. This version may be adopted for the express purpose of guaranteeing exhaustiveness. Often this intent is made obvious by the replacement of ‘inductive’ by ‘nondeductive’, ‘nondemonstrative’, or ‘nonconclusive’. This is the version which Nicholas Rescher must have had in mind when he said: ‘an inductive argument is simply an argument whose conclusion outruns the information provided by its premises.â4 The scheme was also adopted by Baruch Brody in his text on theoretical and applied logic. Brody defined validity, and discussed deductive arguments and deductive validity. Then, potentially in a departure from the positivist theory, he allowed that arguments which fail to be deductively valid are nevertheless sometimes ‘perfectly acceptable’ in some other way. 5\n\nWith this approach the category of inductive arguments will be large indeed. It will include all poor arguments, as well as a motley variety of good arguments. All deductive arguments will be valid by definition. (That is to say, there will be no such thing as an invalid deductive argument.) Inductive arguments will include those in which the premises, if true, would make the conclusion probable; those in which the premises are completely irrelevant to the conclusion; all formal and informal fallacies; analogies; inferences to the best explanation; so-called âgood reasonsâ arguments; and potentially many others. Thus the ‘inductive’ category will explicitly serve as a leftover category. This way of drawing the distinction will guarantee, by definition, an exhaustive and exclusive dichotomy. The result that there are no invalid deductive arguments will be unsettling to many traditionalists, however, and the inductive category will exhibit little coherence.\n\nOn a third view, deductive arguments are those in which it is claimed that the premises entail or necessitate the conclusion. Inductive arguments are those in which it is claimed that the premises make the conclusion likely or probable. This kind of account is suggested in Max Black’s Encyclopedia of Philosophy article on induction. Black says:\n\nThe name ‘induction’, derived from the Latin translation of Aristotle’s epagoge, will be used here to cover all cases of nondemonstrative argument in which the truth of the premises, while not entailing the truth of the conclusion purports to be a good reason for belief in it.6\n\nThe most important sources for this version of the inductive/deductive distinction are Irving Copi’s classic texts. In the fourth edition of Introduction to Logic, Copi put it this way:\n\nAccordingly, we characterize a deductive argument as one whose conclusion is claimed to follow from its premises with absolute necessity, this necessity not being a matter of degree and not depending in any way upon whatever else may be the case. And in sharp contrast we characterize an inductive argument as one whose conclusion is claimed to follow from its premises only with probability, this probability being a matter of degree and dependent upon what else may be the case.7\n\nThis version of the inductive-deductive distinction may be the most standard one. It allows for the commonsensical result that there are both valid and invalid deductive arguments and both strong and weak inductive arguments.\n\nThe problems with this account begin with the expression ‘is claimed to‘. When people present arguments, it is often unclear whether logical entailment or merely some less tight support is ‘claimed‘. Their words often do not suggest one or the other. Furthermore, the expression âis claimedâ is ambiguous. One may mean by it that the arguer intends one or the other connection or one may mean that the wording, context, and nature of the argument themselves suggest either a deductive or an inductive goal. Since Copi and others who follow him have not made their distinction explicitly intentional, it seems best to follow the direction of the second interpretation of ‘is claimed’ here.8 To see what connection is claimed in an argument, we have to study the nature of that argument itself: the stated premises and conclusion, the context, the indicator words, qualifying or hedging words such as ‘probably’ or ‘in all likelihood’, and the logical relationships that exist between the premises and the conclusion. These are in the argument, not in the intentions and beliefs of the arguer. Given the inscrutability of arguers’ intentions, especially when they are distant or dead, this seems a more promising direction. However, it is not without its difficulties.\n\nTo see how problems can arise when we try to apply Copi’s version of the inductive-deductive distinction, we can consider several examples from his own exercises. Here is an argument which Copi takes from Etienne Gilson’s The Unity of Philosophical Experience.Â Since man is essentially rational, the constant recurrence of metaphysics in the history of human knowledge must have its explanation in the very structure of reason itself.9\n\nThe argument here is:\n\nMan is essentially rational.\n\nTherefore,\n\nThe constant recurrence of metaphysics in the history of humans has its explanation in the very structure of reason itself.\n\nOne could say that the word ‘must’ provides reason to take the argument as deductive. It seems to be functioning as an inference indicator rather than as a modal term within the conclusion claim. However, the word ‘must’ has empirical inference uses too, as in ‘you must be tired after all that hiking yesterday’. One might, alternatively, think that since Gilson is dealing with an explanation for the recurrence of metaphysics, he is hypothesizing, and that his argument should be taken as inductive, a kind of âbest explanationâ appeal. It will hardly do to say that since Gilson is a philosopher and writing as a philosopher, the argument must be deductive. The case is not easily classified using Copi’s distinction.\n\nAnother perplexing case is the following, which Copi quotes from Adam Smith.\n\nA gardener who cultivates his own garden with his own hands unites in his own person the three different characters of landlord, farmer, and laborer. His produce, therefore, should pay him the rent of the first, the profit of the second, and the wages of the third.10\n\nCopi classifies this argument as deductive on the grounds that it does not appeal to experience to establish what is probably the case, but appeals to principles of equity to prove what should be the case. (This appeal must be a tacit one.) Principles of equity are presumed here not to come from experience, which has been classically associated with induction. Now, there was no reference to experience in Copi’s definition of induction and it is that notion which has been omitted from modern accounts, presumably in the interests of obtaining an exhaustive dichotomy between deduction and induction. What should be at issue, strictly, within Copi’s account, is whether conclusiveness is ‘claimed’ in the argument. The matter of principles of equity has no bearing on this issue: we might appeal to them hesitantly or assuredly; one might cite them to deduce a conclusion about a particular case, or to hypothesis. We can of course make Adam Smith’s argument deductively valid by adding three premises:\n\nIf a person serves the role of a farmer, he should receive the profit of a farmer.\n\nIf a person serves the role of a landlord, he should receive the rent of a landlord.\n\nIf a person serves the role of a laborer, he should receive the wages of a laborer.\n\nBut the fact that the argument can be supplemented so as to be deductively valid does not show what is ‘claimed’ when it is unsupplemented. As we have seen, any argument can be supplemented so as to become deductively valid. If that were sufficient to make it ‘claim’ deductive validity, Copi’s view would amount to deductivism. Clearly, that is not his intent, since he seeks to explain a distinction between deductive and inductive arguments.\n\nThese difficulties do not arise just because Copi has selected unfortunate examples. The problem is that the inductive/deductive distinction as Copi draws it is difficult to apply to real arguments. Everything depends on what is claimed in the argument about the tightness of the connection between premises and conclusion. This interpretation must somehow be inferred from the wording and the context. But indicators may go in different directions or fail to be present at all. Neither contexts, nor indicator words, nor the logical ordering of claims, nor the nature of the subject provide firm guidance as to what an argument ‘claims’ about the connection between its premises and its conclusion.\n\nSome years back, readers of the Informal Logic Newsletter were treated to a series of critical articles on the viability of the inductive- deductive distinction. Perturbed by the difficulty in applying the distinction to naturally occurring arguments, several writers defended versions of the positivist theory that would transfer the inductive-deductive dichotomy into another domain. Difficulties in applying various versions of the distinction to arguments directly generated suggestions that the distinction must apply elsewhere. One suggestion, put forward by Samuel Fohr, was that the inductive-deductive distinction did not apply to arguments themselves but rather to arguers’ intentions and thereby (derivatively) to arguments as put forward by particular arguers. Another suggestion was that it applied to the standards by which arguments could be assessed.\n\nFohr maintained that arguments were not merely sets of statements to be found in textbooks, but rather claims made by persons seeking to justify further claims. On this notion of argument, Smith and Jones might make the same claims, using the same words, but offer different arguments, if their intentions were relevantly different. An explicitly intentional account had been offered earlier by Robert Olson in his text, Meaning and Argument. Olson said:\n\nThe term ‘imply’ has a stronger and weaker meaning. In its stronger meaning, the premises of an argument ‘imply’ a conclusion if and only if they give conclusive evidence for it. In its weaker meaning the premises of an argument ‘imply’ a conclusion if and only if they give reasonably good but less than conclusive evidence in its favor.Â If the arguer believes that the premises of an argument necessarily imply the conclusion, the argument is deductive (or necessary). If the arguer believes that the premises of an argument probably imply the conclusion the argument is nondeductive (or probable).11\n\nFohr endorsed Olson’s account, and put his own distinction this way:\n\nIf a person intends that his premises necessitate his conclusion, he is giving a deductive argument. If he intends only that his premises render his conclusion probable, he is giving an inductive argument.12\n\nWe see a shift here from beliefs to intentions. As Fohr was forced to admit, this version of the distinction makes it non-exhaustive. There are many cases in which those who compose arguments intend only that their premises provide support for their conclusion and fail to have any intention regarding necessitation or making probable. The concept of logical necessitation is a philosopher’s concept that is difficult to teach to students, and that we cannot expect the bulk of ordinary people to contemplate regularly in their day-to-day lives, even whenever they are offering reasons. Many arguments will fall into limbo so far as this statement of the positivist theory is concerned. As one critic pointed out, the man who tells his wife that she should help him paint the kitchen because she promised to do so is likely to have little idea as to whether he intends to prove his conclusion or merely make it probable. He wants her to help with the painting, and he’s telling her why she should do it. In response, Fohr urged that such arguments be assessed according to both kinds of standards (those appropriate for induction and those appropriate for deduction) and maintained that ordinary arguers should have the required intentions regarding their premises and conclusions.\n\nFohr’s approach would make the philosophical distinction between necessitating and making probable a norm for argumentative intentions. If arguers do not grasp this norm, we have to consider their arguments from both perspectives. However, these arguers should brush up on epistemology and order their intentions to fit our theory of argument.\n\nAnother proposal regarding application was stated by Brian Skyrms in Choice and Chance and defended in the Newsletter interchange by David Hitchcock. It moves the dichotomy from arguments to standards of appraisal.\n\nSkyrms criticizes the intentionalist account in a footnote, saying:\n\n.. this will not do, for arguments do not intend anything. People who advance arguments intend many things. Sometimes they intend for the argument to be deductively valid; sometimes they intend it to be inductively strong; sometimes they intend it to be a clever sophistry; and sometimes they don’t know the difference.13\n\nThe positivist theory of argument, on this version, would say that there are many diverse arguments – some hard to classify – but that there are, broadly speaking, only two types of standards for appraising arguments. These are deductive standards and inductive standards. On this account, the distinction between inductive and deductive is not a distinction between types of argument. Nor is it a distinction between types of intention arguers might have. Rather, it is a distinction between types of standard that may be used for appraising arguments. There are two broad types of standard: deductive standards and inductive standards. Deductive standards are used when we wish to determine whether the premises of an argument entail its conclusion. Inductive standards are used when we wish to determine whether the premises of an argument make its conclusion probable. Skyrms put it this way:\n\nWe defined logic as the study of the strength of the evidential link between the premises and conclusions of arguments. We have seen that there are two different standards against which to evaluate the strength of this link: deductive validity and inductive strength. Corresponding to these two standards are two branches of logic: deductive logic and inductive logic. Deductive logic is concerned with tests for deductive validity – that is, rules for deciding whether or not a given argument is deductively valid – and rules for constructing deductively valid arguments. Inductive logic is concerned with tests for measuring the inductive probability, and hence the inductive strength, of arguments and with rules for constructing inductively strong arguments.\n\nDavid Hitchcock defended Skyrms’ view, saying that the inductive/deductive distinction provides an exhaustive dichotomy of standards of appraisal, rather than an exhaustive dichotomy of types of argument. Hitchcock said that in deductive logic, we are offered a theory of the circumstances in which premises do or do not make it logically impossible for a conclusion to be false given the premises. In inductive logic, we have a theory of the circumstances in which an argument is inductively strong or inductively weak – that is, in which it is more or less probable that its conclusion is true, given that its premise(s) are true. Within each theory there are various types of logic. In deductive logic we have the logic of truth-functional sentence connectives, first-order quantifiers, the logic of identity and so on. Within inductive logic we have the logic of the confirmation and disconfirmation of hypotheses, the logic of analogical arguments, the logic of inferences from sample characteristics to population characteristics, the logic of controlled experiments to prove causal claims, and so on. Then there is the logic of conductive or balance of considerations or good reasons arguments. Possibly there are other standards.14\n\nBoth Skyrms and Hitchcock argue that it is not always easy to decide which sort of standard to apply to a particular argument. For this reason, they believe that it makes more sense to think of a dichotomy of standards rather than a dichotomy of arguments. There are two puzzling aspects of this view, however. First, we may question why we have a dichotomy of standards, rather than a plurality. This question will certainly strike forcefully if we look at Hitchcock’s list for the inductive standards. It is hard to see what analogy, balance-of-considerations reasoning, and the use of controlled experiments to justify causal conclusions will have in common. One suspects that they have been lumped together, seen as involving a common inductive standard (whatever that might be) precisely in the interests of getting an exhaustive dichotomy. The account is slightly anomalous, as Hitchcock acknowledged in reply to critics, because one would presume a connection between the articulation of standards for appraising the inferences within arguments and the existence of arguments to which those standards are appropriately applied. The former should presuppose the latter. The view can be amended to incorporate this point if one says that standards exist and there are arguments to which it is clearly appropriate to apply those standards. But at that point the issue will be whether standards fall broadly into just two types: deductive and inductive.15 Again, the great divide can be questioned. It is reasonable to suppose that we develop standards of one kind or another because there is a substantial group of arguments to which they are appropriately applied.\n\nAmong philosophers, the positivist theory of argument seems to be the most popular theory. It is Copi’s version which is the most commonly accepted, perhaps due to the influence of his texts over several decades. It is also because this view and it alone allows one to apply the inductive-deductive distinction to all arguments and to have good and poor arguments within each category. Salmon, Neidorf, and Kyburg give a version of the distinction applicable only to good arguments. Black and Rescher state one which allows inductive arguments to be either good or poor, but leaves all deductive ones as valid. Fohr transfer the distinction to intentions, with the result that it cannot be exhaustive after all.\n\nMost who rely on a positivist theory of argument have not articulated a particular version, for it has been ‘common wisdom’ amongst logicians and philosophers. They would hold that the theory is exhaustive, that it applies to arguments (as distinct from intentions or standards) and that it allows for good and poor arguments (inferentially speaking) within each category. These presumptions make Copi’s account the most attractive one.\n\nAs we have seen, significant problems arise in applying Copi’s distinction, due mostly to the phrase ‘is claimed to’ in the definition. This phrase does not make explicit reference to the intentions of arguers. A person might use words that, as normally understood, make a claim she did not actually intend to make. The Copi version of the inductive/deductive distinction does not commit us to the tight relationship between the intentions of the arguer and the direction and force of the argument. Rather, it requires that we look at the wording of the argument and try to determine whether the argument as stated is claiming a necessary or probabilistic connection between the premises and the conclusion. The difficulty at this point is that indicators may give conflicting signals, or be absent altogether. Hence we are frequently left not knowing whether to classify an argument as deductive or as inductive. We saw problems even with examples that Copi himself selected for exercises. Here is another:\n\nThe peculiar evil of silencing the expression of an opinion is that it is robbing the human race: posterity as well as the existing generation; those who dissent from the opinion still more than those who hold it. If the opinion is right, they are deprived of the opportunity of exchanging error for truth; if wrong, they lose, what is almost as great a benefit, the clearer perception and livelier impression of truth, produced by its collision with error.16\n\nIn this argument of J. S. Mill’s we may ask whether ‘it is claimed’ that the conclusion follows with absolute necessity from the premises. The conclusion is that suppressing the expression of an opinion always robs the human race especially ‘posterity’ and dissenters. It is quite clear what this conclusion is, and it is also fairly clear as to what premises are stated in defence of it. (Interpreters may dispute as to whether the argument contains unstated premises. But for now it is only the classification of the argument as inductive or deductive on the basis of what ‘is claimed’ that is at issue.) There seems to be no conclusive evidence as to how tightly the conclusion ‘is claimed’ to be related to those premises. One might regard the argument as deductive or as inductive.\n\nNor is this example unrepresentative. As Skyrms, teachers of informal logic, and a number of writers on the inductive-deductive distinction have noted to their consternation, examples like this are all too easy to find. Consider again:\n\nIt is the singular feature of such ethnic explanation (of poverty) that it is all but exclusively confined to conversation. The reputable scholar unhesitantly adverts to it in casual interchange but rarely if ever puts it in his books or even his lectures. What is wholly plausible in conversation is wholly impermissible in print. There is obviously something odd about an explanation of poverty and well-being that must be so discreetly handled.\n\nHere John Kenneth Galbraith, in a discussion of mass poverty, argues from the absence of ethnic explanations of poverty in print and in lectures to the ‘oddity’ of these explanations of poverty.17 It is clear what his conclusion and premises are, but unclear what ‘is claimed’ about the relation between them. The word ‘obviously’ indicates that Galbraith confidently believes his conclusion to be true, but does not indicate whether he believes it to be necessitated, or rather made probable, by his premises.\n\nIt is no accident that such examples are easy to find. People who argue do (at least implicitly) distinguish conclusions from premises and ‘claim’ that the latter provide reasons for the former. But they often do not, even implicitly, make claims about what sort of connection is supposed to hold between these premises and their conclusion. A major reason for this is that most arguers have not reflected on the difference between deductive entailment and making probable, and hence would not raise the question about strength of connection as philosophers would like them to raise it. They do not, explicitly or implicitly, ‘make claims’ about an issue that for them does not arise at all. A further problem is that even if ordinary arguers did wish to indicate whether a necessary or probable connection existed, our language provides very few words which would conveniently serve the purpose. (At least, that is true of English.) Indicators such as ‘therefore’ and ‘must’ are sometimes urged by textbook authors to indicate deductive arguments, but are also to be found in arguments that tradition would label as non deductive. Given that the notion of deductive entailment and the related notion of ‘following with absolute necessity’, which Copi uses in his definition, are philosophical constructs, it is not surprising that ordinary language lacks terms that reliably indicate a claim to either sort of connection.\n\nThose who continue to believe that ordinary arguers would do well to master this distinction and learn to observe it should recall that the closely related distinctions of analytic versus synthetic statements, and of necessary versus contingent statements, are contested. It is a commonplace of modern philosophy that these distinctions are difficult to draw with precision. Since Quine’s ‘Two Dogmas of Empiricism’ and Waismann’s ‘Analytic-Synthetic’ series, few philosophers have used these distinctions with confidence. Current analyses of scientific reasoning emphasize the difficulty of classifying terms as either conceptual or observational and the related difficulty in classifying statements as either logical or empirical. Given such acknowledged difficulties, it is a tribute to the sheer force of unanalyzed tradition that the inductive-deductive distinction has remained so prominent as the basis for a theory of argument.\n\nDepending on which version of the positivist theory we are dealing with, we need to find out whether all the information ‘in’ the conclusion is already ‘in’ the premises; whether the truth of the premises would make the falsity of the conclusion ‘logically impossible’; whether the argument or the arguer ‘claims’ or ‘intends’ either of these; and so on. If there are many borderline cases when we try to determine whether statements are analytic or synthetic (or necessary or contingent, or a priori or empirical), there will obviously be borderline cases for arguments as well. The question for arguments can be collapsed into the other: we ask whether the associated conditional is empirical or necessary instead of asking whether the argument is deductive or inductive. If the argument is deductively valid, its associated conditional is necessarily true. If it ‘claims’ deductive validity, it ‘claims’ that the associated conditional is necessarily true. If its author intends it to be deductively valid, he intends that its associated conditional is necessarily true, and so on.\n\nTo illustrate this point, consider the following argument from Thomas Kuhn’s early book, The Copernican Revolution. Early in his career, Kuhn felt an obligation to defend what was then an unusual practice – combining the history of science with the philosophy of science. He said:\n\n.. the combination of science and intellectual history is an unusual one. Initially it may therefore seem incongruous. But there can be no intrinsic incongruity. Scientific concepts are ideas and as such they are the subject of intellectualÂ history.18\n\nThere is a subargument structure here:\n\nScientific concepts are ideas.\n\nSo,\n\nScientific concepts are the subject of intellectual history.\n\nTherefore,\n\nThere is nothing intrinsically incongruous about combining science and intellectual history.\n\nAsking whether this argument is deductively valid is, in effect, asking whether its two associated conditionals are logically necessary. These are ‘If scientific concepts are ideas, then scientific concepts are the subject of intellectual history’ and ‘If scientific concepts are the subject of intellectual history, then there is nothing incongruous about combining science and intellectual history’. Are these statements logically, or necessarily true? It is not clear in either case. The first might be said to assume that all ideas are the subject of intellectual history, and thus not to be necessarily true as stated, on the grounds that it assumes something false. On the other hand, it might be said to assume only that scientific ideas are serious ideas and all serious ideas are the subject of intellectual history, and the claim might be made that these assumed statements are true, perhaps even necessarily true. The matter is arguable. Nor are standards of incongruousness precise. It is by no means easy to work out an answer to the question of whether the second conditional is necessarily true. Probably the most cautious answer is to say that neither conditional is necessarily true. We can see from this example just how directly difficulties with the necessary/ contingent and analytic/synthetic distinctions transfer to the inductive/deductive distinction. If we ask whether Kuhn intended either or both conditionals to be interpreted so as to come out as necessarily true, or claimed implicitly that either or both were necessarily true, the problem would not be more easily resolved.\n\nTo add to these difficulties, there are further problems that appear when we consider the possibility that arguments have unstated premises. As the topic of missing premises is a large and thorny one for any theory of argument, we cannot pose it as a special problem for the positivist theory. However, it augments difficulties of classification because, as we have seen, any argument can be reconstructed as a deductively valid argument by suitable addition of premises.19 Perry Weddle, among others, once urged that such possibilities for reconstruction leave too much indeterminacy in classification. He urged a shift to a monolithic theory as a result. One might urge that if an argument can be reconstructed so as to be deductively valid, this in itself may be seen as a reason to think that the arguer must, in effect, have ‘claimed’ that his premises (stated and understood or unstated) would lead with absolute necessity to his conclusion. Some who believe that such reconstructions more accurately depict the direction and force of the original argument will see the emerging ‘fact’ that the reconstructed argument is deductively valid to be a reason for thinking the arguer ‘claimed’ an absolutely necessary connection. But it is not a good reason.\n\nIt is not easy to sort actual arguments into the two positivist categories on the basis of the Copi sort of account which constitutes standard logical wisdom on the part of many philosophers today. That many difficulties arise in applying the distinction cannot be denied. What is debatable is not the existence, but the significance, of these difficulties. The distinction between A’s and B’s may be important even though there are many items that are borderline cases and might be classified either as A’s or as B’s. Yet one must acknowledge that application problems do not by themselves show that a distinction is untenable. It is likely that the classifying problems that plague the positivist theory of argument have their counterparts in other pluralistic theories of argument. We might have to choose between a theory with classifying problems and a monolithic theory. That theory would presumably be deductivism, given that no one doubts that there exist at least some arguments that are deductively valid.\n\nThere are almost always several ways of interpreting what people say and write. This point applies to arguments as it does to all other discourse. Any theory of argument allowing for several categories of argument will have to make some allowance for this flexibility in interpretation. Those who adopt the theory will have to develop a policy for borderline cases. The fact that there are many cases that are not easily classified according to the positivist theory does not count conclusively against that theory. If one is convinced that the basic dualism of the theory is built around something fundamental and important, one may attribute the many borderline cases to variations in context, the flexibility of written and spoken language, and the problem of missing premises, and decide to maintain some version of the theory.\n\nThe key issue is the nature of this basic dualism. The term ‘positivist’ is appropriate for the theory of the great divide because that divide owes much of its domination of our thought to the belief, common some decades back, that mathematics-logic and the empirical sciences are the only two sources of human knowledge. The different versions of positivism are all dualistic, though the dualism appears in different places in the various versions. The key common idea is that there is a basic kind of connection between premises and conclusion that is deductive, and there is one other kind of connection. Only one. The deductive side of the dichotomy seems relatively unproblematic. To be satisfied with the positivist theory, however, we have to be satisfied with both sides. Moreover, and most significantly, one has to convince oneself that this dichotomy is exhaustive. The key issue for any version of the positivist theory, is whether there is just one kind of nondeductive connection.\n\nThe usual way of describing an inductive connection between premises and conclusion is to say that the premises, if true, make the truth of the conclusion likely or probable. This may be a way of saying only that the premises have some bearing on the conclusion but fail to entail it. If so, no independent understanding of inductive connection is gained. One has simply, in effect, reiterated oneâs belief that deductive connection is an important thing to understand and negatively defined a second derivative category. To have a good understanding of the dichotomy around which the positivist theory of argument is built, one should have an independent and clear understanding of inductive connection. If the theory is to dichotomize arguments, this understanding should yield a distinction that will be relatively easy to apply and that will exclusively and exhaustively divide arguments into the two types.\n\nThe term ‘probable’, which is often used in defining inductive arguments, is most naturally applied to contexts where we are expressing roughly quantifiable degrees of confidence in empirical statement and where we are willing, in at least a rough sense, to make quantitative judgments. Probability theories deal with the quantitative assessment of confidence or likelihood of some empirical statements, given a prior quantitative assessment of others, based in the final analysis on relative frequencies. If one is to use ‘probable’ or a related term in order to specify a sense of ‘inductive’ which will provide a firm basis for a clear and exhaustive ‘inductive/deductive’ distinction, one need to define the term more broadly. There are many arguments that have conclusions that are non-empirical and in which, nevertheless, the supporting reasoning is, on the face of it, not deductive. (They appear to be a priori and yet not deductive.) In such contexts, a standard conception of probability is a poor fit.\n\nConsider arguments of the following types:\n\nconsistency arguments by analogy. In such arguments it is urged that case (a) is relevantly similar to case (b); that case (b) has been treated as such-and-such; and that therefore case (a) should be similarly treated. The conclusion is normative; the reasoning is based on parallel cases.\n\narguments of the type that Carl Wellman has called ‘conductive’ and which others have referred to as ‘balance-of-consideration’ or ‘good reasons’ arguments (Baier) or as ‘convergent arguments’ (Thomas). In such arguments, several reasons are cited; these appear to bear independently on the conclusion. All premises may be relevant; none taken alone is likely to be sufficient. Frequently the conclusion is normative; it may also be about an issue of classification or interpretation.\n\nnon-conclusive philosophical arguments. These may be of one of the above types. They are noted separately here in the hope that philosophers will be particularly familiar with the idea that in their own discipline there are often arguments that seem to have some force, yet not to be deductively valid. (For example, the failure of many physicalistic terms to apply naturally to such phenomena as belief and thought counts against the mind-brain identity thesis, but how seriously? It does give a reason to think there may be something wrong, or overly-simple, about the thesis. But it does not entail its falsehood. Nor would it be natural to say that this linguistic fact makes it ‘improbable’ that the identity thesis is true. The notion of probability does not fit the case well. And obviously, the truth or falsity of the thesis is not straightforwardly empirical.)\n\np class=”import-Normal indent” style=”margin-left: 0.7pt; margin-right: 0.5pt; text-indent: 10.05pt;”>There are two themes underlying the idea that an inductive connection is probabilistic rather than necessary. The first is a negative idea: the premises do not necessitate the conclusion. The second is a positive idea: the premises offer some support to the conclusion. This second idea requires clarification; âsome supportâ should not be understood merely as ânondeductive support.â How helpful is it to say that the premises will (if true) make the conclusion more probable? I submit that it is not very helpful.\n\nAppeals in this context to the term âprobableâ are not useful outside contexts where the conclusion is empirical. The reasons we offer for and against normative and conceptual conclusions are not naturally understood as making these more or less probable. For example, an argument in which abortion is assimilated to infanticide is not one in which the premises, if true, make it probable, or more probable, that abortion is wrong. They provide some reason to think that abortion is wrong. It makes little sense to attach probabilities to normative conclusions of this type.20\n\nIf a probabilistic connection is any connection other than a deductive one, then of course consistency arguments, conductive arguments, and many philosophical arguments are based on such a connection. If that connection is allowed to define what an inductive connection is, the inference in question may be said to be inductive. But little understanding is thereby gained.\n\nOne may understand probabilistic connection in this broad way. But no information is thereby provided as to what the various inductive arguments have in common. It will not elucidate the category ‘inductive’ so as to yield a balanced dualism in the positivist theory of argument. On this understanding, one has deductive arguments (in which an entailment of conclusion by premises is exemplified, intended, or ‘claimed’) and one has other arguments (in which no entailment is exemplified, intended, or ‘claimed’). The inductive is the ‘other’, about which one has said nothing informative. The broad understanding of probabilistic connection is misleading insofar as concepts of probability are most commonly associated with, and most straightforwardly applicable to, the confirmation of empirical statements by empirical evidence. This association, together with the more fundamental association between induction and scientific reasoning, has led many to ignore the fact that reasoning that is probabilistic in the broad sense is often not probabilistic in the narrower sense. Non-empirical conclusions may be defended by reasoning that is non deductive in the sense that it does not exemplify (or is not intended or claimed to exemplify) the connection of logical entailment of conclusion by premises. The shifting between a broad and a narrower sense of ‘probable’ and related terms makes it too easy to ignore the existence of nondeductive arguments that are primarily non-empirical in character.\n\nIn light of these considerations, the basic dualism underlying the positivist theory of argument is not sufficiently clear and compelling to outweigh classificatory problems. Though this is probably the theory of argument most popular among philosophers, and it has a venerable history going back through Hume even to Aristotle, I contend that it is not a satisfactory theory.\n\nThe strong philosophical attachment to the positivist theory of argument may be due to two beliefs, both prominent in tradition and both having a firm hold on many. There is first the tradition going back to Aristotle, which maintains that there are two and only two broad types of argument: deductive arguments, which are conclusive, and inductive arguments, which are not. There is secondly the tradition – with the same venerable history – that inductive arguments are the arguments of science: fundamentally induction deals with the empirical confirmation of scientific hypotheses. The problem is not with either of these traditional beliefs but with their conjunction. If one is loyal to both at once, one is led to ignore many arguments common in morality, history, literary interpretation, law, and philosophy.\n\nThere are many issues that are neither amenable to techniques of empirical confirmation (not straightforwardly, in any case) nor settled deductively. Inductive logics have dealt primarily with arguments that are classically inductive (enumerative inductive). They may venture occasionally into inferences from correlational data to causal hypotheses, or to the inference-to-the-best-explanation. But generally they fail to include many patterns and style of argument which a naturalistic analysis of discourse would reveal: appeals to authority, arguments from separate reasons, interpretive arguments, ad hominem arguments, consistency arguments by analogy, and various other types of philosophical and legal argumentation. In fact, such arguments are rarely systematically studied under any name.\n\nThis is the real danger of the great divide in the positivist theory of argument. One sets up the inductive-deductive dichotomy, making it true by definition that all arguments are either deductive or inductive. Then one looks at the work which has in fact been done by logicians. There are systems articulating various aspects of deductive logic and there are systems called ‘inductive logic’. The latter deal with sampling, generating empirical hypotheses, causal inference, and so on. One readily comes to believe that the types of arguments covered in these standard systems are all the types there are. But many arguments that are inductive in the broadest sense have not been covered.\n\nThis theme has been emphasized by Chaim Perelman and L. Olbrechts-Tyteca.21 In their substantial book, The New Rhetoric, they offer illustration after illustration of such arguments, castigating logicians and philosophers for having been so mesmerized by the traditional ‘inductive/deductive’ distinction as to have denied their very existence.\n\nThe great divide between deductive and inductive arguments is spurious and theoretically dangerous, because it makes it too easy to ignore the many non deductive arguments which are not classically inductive. Confidence in this spurious dichotomy leads one to false simplicity in classificatory categories and falsely founded problems of justification in philosophy and elsewhere. Acknowledging the existence and epistemic legitimacy of other types of argument would alter approaches to such problems as the justification of normative and interpretive statements while at the same time enhancing our understanding of natural argumentation.\n\nNotes\n\n1.Wesley Salmon, Logic.

Olbrechts-Tyteca, The New Rhetoric: A Treatise on Argumentation, (Notre Dame: University of Notre Dame Press, 1969. Translated from French by John Wilkinson and Peircell Weaver.)\n\nMy interest in these topics continues to this day, and I have written and commented further on both of them. I remain grateful to John Wisdom for permitting me to read his lectures on explanation and proof, popularly known as the Virginia Lectures, and to Roger Shiner for loaning me his copy of that fascinating material. The doctoral work of Jerome Bickenbach and the summary provided by Renford Bambrough were also helpful and should remain of interest to scholars. The topic of analogical arguments has been of interest to others, notably Marcello Guarini and Lilian Bermejo-Luque and their students.\n\nThe question of whether a priori analogies should be considered as distinct from deductive arguments also remains of interest; I sense some consensus in favour of an affirmative answer to that question. In any analogy the target case (topic in question) and the analogue are both similar and different. Assessment of an argument based on analogy presupposes awareness of those similarities and differences, and hinges mainly on the issue of their significance (in support, or in objection) to the conclusion claim. Reconstructing those arguments with a universal claim regarded as a missing premise remains a temptation for analysts and theorists. It is a temptation I would still resist, for reasons given here. Of course reconstructing by adding a universal missing premise is not the only way of rendering a priori analogies deductively valid; one can take a modus ponens approach using the associated conditional.\n\nClearly, if one thinks that a priori analogies are not deductive arguments, one presumes a distinction between the a priori and the deductive. One might say that a question is a priori if it is to be resolved by considerations of concepts, criteria, meaning, and significance; accordingly a style of argument would be a priori if these features characterize it. When we ask whether a priori analogies are deductive arguments, we need to ask what sort of argument counts as deductive. The matter is problematic. One might say that an argument is deductive if the truth of its premises render the falsity of its conclusion impossible or if the arguer intends that to be the case. On such a definition, it is clear that the a priori and the deductive may be distinguished. (Of course Kant thought so long ago, for different reasons.) Given these conceptions of the a priori on the one hand and the deductive on the other, I continue to maintain that a priori analogies are not deductive.\n\nJohn Wisdom argued that due to its role in settling questions about the application of words, case-by-case reasoning was more fundamental for human thought than either deduction or induction. So far as I am aware, that challenging hypothesis has not been seriously studied.\n\nCarl Wellmanâs ideas about conductive argument received little attention for many years, but have recently been subject to sustained discussion and criticism. My own developments of Wellmanâs ideas have been part of that picture. A key volume, resulting from a Windsor conference is Conductive Arguments: An Overlooked Type of Defeasible Reasoning, edited by Ralph Johnson and J. Anthony Blair. Topics considered in recent discussions include the convergent/linked distinction, ways of diagramming the structure of conductive argument, the role of counter-considerations in argument, the distinction between counter-considerations and objections, and the appropriacy of such language as âweighingâ and âbalancingâ in considering the significance of cumulating factors. In his work The Concept of Argument, Harald Wohlrapp argues that the pros and cons of conductive argument can better be understood as stages in an ongoing discussion, so that in a process (as distinct from product) model of argument, the category âconductiveâ will disappear.\n\nIt is quite possible that a priori analogies and conductive arguments are not the only types of arguments ignored because of the misleading and spurious exhaustiveness of the inductive/deductive distinction. If âinductiveâ is so broadly defined that every non-deductive argument counts as inductive, the inductive category will include a large variety of argument types. For example, it is common to think of abductive arguments as inductive. Abductive arguments have not been ignored by theorists, a fact that may be due to their importance in scientific reasoning. A close study of a variety of works inside and outside philosophy might well reveal other candidates that are neither deductive nor empirically inductive in nature. I suspect it would. Perelman and Olbrechts-Tytecaâs The New Rhetoric could serve as an excellent starting point in the quest for examples.\n\nThe prevailing theories of argument among philosophers seem to be deductivism and positivism. Of course there have been dissenters from these views. Some dissenters, such as Wittgenstein, Toulmin, and Perelman, were people of considerable professional prominence. Despite this, their views on argument have not greatly influenced thinking about logic and argument.\n\nAmong dissenting views on reasoning and argument, two are of particular interest. The first is that of John Wisdom, elaborated most completely in the unpublished lectures ‘Explanation and Proof’, presented at the University of Virginia in 1957, and commonly known as the Virginia Lectures. In these lectures, Wisdom described what he called ‘case-by-case reasoning’ or ‘reasoning by parallels’.1 He argued that it was a nondeductive, noninductive, type of reasoning which was, in fact, more basic than either deduction or induction. The second neglected, but interesting, view is that of Carl Wellman, articulated in 1971 in Challenge and Response: Justification in Ethics.2 Like Wisdom, Weldon challenged the prevailing belief that arguments are either inductive or deductive. He defined a third category which he called ‘conductive’, in which distinct, separately relevant factors are cited to support a conclusion. Wellman was concerned to show the relevance of conductive arguments to issues about the justification of moral beliefs; however his account has broader application as well as this single important one.\n\nAlthough case-by-case reasoning and conductive reasoning are not the same, they fit into a similar gap in the theory of argument and may have been widely ignored by philosophers for similar reasons. Both fail to supply deductive support to conclusions and yet are frequently used in a priori contexts to resolve issues that are conceptual, philosophical, normative, or in some other sense nonempirical. In addition, both seem recalcitrant to treatment by general rules. Case-by-case reasoning depends on specific similarities and differences between individual cases. These cases have to be compared and ‘seen’ as such, rather than handled by covering generalizations. Conductive reasoning depends fundamentally on judgments of positive and negative relevance and on how these separately relevant pro and con factors are significant when considered in the balance.\n\n1. Wisdomâs Virginia Lectures\n\nJohn Wisdom’s Virginia Lectures offer a sustained elaboration and defence of a view which he applied and formulated more briefly in some of his published work. The lectures are conveniently and accurately summarized in a paper by D. Yalden-Thomas, available in a collection of essays on Wisdom’s philosophy. They were the subject of several doctoral dissertations in the late nineteen fifties and of a thorough analysis in a 1977 doctoral dissertation by Jerome Bickenbach. To some extent, Wisdom’s views have been promulgated by his former students and colleagues: several works on meta-philosophy and meta-ethics, including Renford Bambrough’s Moral Scepticism and Moral Knowledge. Stephen Barker’s Elements of Logic shows Wisdom’s influence, particularly in footnotes and cautionary comments in the third edition. Barker was in the audience in Virginia, and some of his questions and comments appear in the typescript of the lectures.3 On the whole, however, Wisdom’s views have had little influence on those who reflect on the nature and types of argument.4 Even a recent paper concerned to defend analogy as a distinct form of inference and referring to a wide variety of sources neglects Wisdom’s view.\n\nAccording to Wisdom, the most basic, primary, kind of reasoning is case-by-case reasoning. This reasoning is used, either explicitly or implicitly, in order to show that a word is properly applied to a particular case. Since both deduction and induction presume the proper application of words to particular instances, any kind of reasoning which is a prerequisite of doing this can lay claim to ‘most basic’ status. Examples of instances where issues of correct application of a term arise are whether a pattern of behavior amounts to negligence; whether the Jews constitute a nation; and whether a trailer that has been fixed in one position is still a mobile home. There may be important disputes in such cases and there is a rational way to resolve them. We find an instance which is clearly a case of negligence, nationhood, being a mobile home, or whatever, and we closely compare and contrast that instance with the unresolved one. The only way to show that terms have been correctly applied is to reason from agreed instances of their correct application. In this way, we can argue for a conclusion on the point. Case-by-case reasoning is a species of argument from analogy.\n\nWisdom considered four sorts of contexts in which case-by-case reasoning is necessary: where we need to resort to comparison with a paradigm; where we are evaluating ‘paradoxical’ statements such as those commonly made in metaphysics; where we are trying to resolve borderline cases; and where criteria are not sufficiently explicit to bring out correct standards of applicability in a process of deduction. The second context here is tied to metaphilosophical disputes in the forties and fifties, and merits some explanatory comment. Wisdom had in mind such claims as ‘nothing is really solid’. His concern was to show that reasons could be offered for and against such metaphysical statements, and that they were not meaningless as positivists had maintained but were, rather, significant statements â though not about either matters of fact or matters of verbal usage.\n\nQuestions about the correct application of such terms as ‘solid’, ‘negligence’, ‘nation’, ‘race’, ‘solvent’, and many others are not purely verbal: they may have profound legal, political, moral, or psychological significance. Wisdom had an ingenious way of contrasting purely verbal disputes with significant conceptual ones. He claimed that if two people have a purely verbal dispute, their disagreement could be explained by the way in which they have used words in the past. Their past usage would be divergent. However, in a case where two people are disagreeing on a significant conceptual issue, such as whether anything is really solid, in the light of particle physics, this disagreement is not necessarily reflected in differences as to how they have previously applied the term. Rather, it is a difference as to the correct decision about how the term should be used in the future, in the light of significant new data. Nor is the difference between them a factual one, for it will not be resolved by future observations. In an inductive argument, we reason to a conclusion that can, in principle, be determined in some other context to be true or false on the basis of empirical observation. But here, the issue is one that requires decision as distinct from prediction.\n\nWhere some authors have contrasted a priori and inductive analogy, Wisdom tends to use ‘analogy’ to refer to inductive analogy and to call what others term ‘a priori analogy’ case-by-case reasoning. The difference as he understands it is that in standard, or inductive, analogy we support a prediction about a case by comparing it with an actual known case. (For example, one might seek to predict the effects of cyclamate on humans by comparing humans at a certain dosage with rats at what would be a comparable dosage for them. Or one might seek the correct diagnosis of symptoms in one patient by comparing her with another patient known to have had a specific disease.) In such cases, we use actual instances to predict unknown ones, and future experience will show whether we are right or wrong.\n\n1a. A Priori Analogy\n\nWith Wisdom’s case-by-case reasoning (or a priori analogy) it does not matter whether the instance used as a basis for comparison is actual or hypothetical, and the reasoning issues in a decision, not a prediction. Consider, for instance, Judith Thompson’s famous analogy between the woman carrying an unwanted fetus and the person who unexpectedly finds herself hooked up to a dying violinist.5 The analogue is obviously hypothetical, but this fact does not affect the merits of the argument. Thompson is arguing that the two cases are relevantly similar, so if we grant that there is no obligation to restrict one’s activities to support the life of the violinist, we ought, in consistency, to believe there is no obligation for the unexpectedly and unwillingly pregnant woman to adapt her activities so as to support the life of the fetus. In case-by-case reasoning, as contrasted with inductive analogy, there is no way of taking further measures to find out by empirical observation whether the parallelism suggested here is or is not the case.\n\nIn his systematic study of Wisdom’s theory, Bickenbach referred to case-by-case reasoning as ‘reflective reasoning’, following Wisdom’s emphasis. In the present discussion the terms ‘a priori analogy’ and ‘logical analogy’ are used. Because there is reasoning that goes from one case to another and that is inductive, the expression ‘case-by-case reasoning’ does not quite serve to pick out the kind of reasoning Wisdom was dealing with: it is too broad. So too is the concept of reflection.\n\nThe thrust that underlies logical analogies is that of consistency – not the consistency required in order to avoid assenting to contradictory propositions, but rather, the consistency required for consistent behavior. This is the consistency of treating relevantly similar cases similarly. It is inconsistent to say that all men are poor listeners while admitting that John and Fred, both men, are good listeners. It is, in another and equally important sense, inconsistent to treat relevantly similar cases differently. If one organism is regarded as alive and another as not alive, there must be a relevant difference between them, at pain of inconsistency. If one man is given three years for theft and another three months, there must be a relevant difference between them, or else the law is inconsistently (and unjustly) administered. Logical analogy focuses on similarities between cases, and arguments based on such analogies urge us to make a decision on a case based on the consideration of a closely similar one. We are pushed to do so by considerations of consistency: similar treatment for similar cases.\n\nThe negative use of logical analogy is found in the technique of refuting arguments by citing parallel flawed arguments. If two arguments are fundamentally similar as to structure, and the first is flawed, the second is flawed also. To regard one of the arguments as cogent and the other as not cogent would be to make decisions inconsistently. This is a familiar use of logical analogy. Wisdom, in his lectures, emphasized the philosophical, moral, and legal contexts in which such reasoning is ubiquitous and necessary. The appeal to consistency is also extremely important in law, moral reasoning, and administration.\n\nWhen he gave the Virginia Lectures, Wisdom seems to have been more interested in reasoning and epistemology – particularly the epistemology of philosophy itself – than he was in argument as such. Nevertheless, it is clear that he thought that case-by-case reasoning was not only a distinct and important type of reasoning but was the basis for a distinct and important type of argument. Any temptation to remodel logical or inductive analogies into deductive or inductive arguments should be resisted, because the type of reasoning such arguments employ is not only a distinct and quite proper type of reasoning but is, in fact, more fundamental than the alternative to which it is to be ‘reduced’. Arguments based on appeals to cases are not reducible to arguments of some other type.\n\nAs with other nondeductive arguments, a priori and inductive analogies can be recast as deductively valid arguments, if we are willing to add general premises of a sufficiently sweeping nature. Consider any analogy:\n\n(1) Case x has features a,b,c.\n\n(2) Case y has features a,b,c.\n\n(3) Case x is of type e.\n\nTherefore,\n\n(4) Case y is of type e.\n\nOne might regard such an argument as elliptical, insisting that cases (x) and (y) must both be subsumed under the appropriate generalization. Thus:\n\nCase x has features a,b,c.\n\nCase y has features a,b,c.\n\nCase x is of type e.\n\nMissing Premise: All things which have features a,b,c, are of type e.\n\nTherefore,\n\nCase y is of type e.\n\nBut there are significant objections to such an approach.\n\nThe added premise makes two of the stated premises redundant as far as the logic of the inference is concerned. If we know that all things with a,b,c, are of type e, then we can apply that universal statement to case (y) directly. We have no need for premises (1) and (3), which cite information about case (x). The comparison of cases is unnecessary. The supplementation makes the key premises which describe the analogy redundant. In effect, the reconstructed argument ceases to be an analogy. A particular (case y) is simply subsumed under a generalization. The analogy has been destroyed, not recast.\n\nIn defense of this enthymematic approach to analogy, one might seek to incorporate case (x) into the argument in a purely psychological way, saying that it serves to remind us of the general truth under which case (y) is subsumed. This suggestion still leaves the conclusion that there are no inferences-by-analogy: analogy is purely a psychological crutch. In fact, this view has been taken seriously by some authors of logic textbooks, including Susan Stebbing and Monroe Beardsley.6 Nevertheless, given that the generalization must bear the whole weight of the argument, it is rather unsatisfactory to have to admit that a subsumed particular case is psychologically necessary in order for us to remember what that generalization is. We may ask why the generalization is not more directly accessible, if it is known. And the word âifâ should be taken seriously here.\n\nThe requisite generalization is typically not known and this, indeed, is usually the primary reason for appealing to analogy in the first place. We do compare cases as such, and we can do this in the absence of a known generalization. As W.H. Shaw and L.R. Ashley point out in their article on analogical inference, much familiar reasoning involves the direct comparison of cases without appeal to an intermediate generalization. Ashley and Shaw say:\n\nAlternatively, consider the rich employment of analogies in contemporary ethical writing. Where is the implicit enumerative induction? We do not perform inductions about lifeboat situations, kidnapped kidney donors, trapped spelunkers, out of-control locomotives, or any of the other bizarre cases which moral philosophers spend their time inventing, when we reason analogically from them to the moral situation actually facing us.7\n\nUsually, to supplement analogies with universal statements is to distort their logical character and weaken them epistemically: in most cases, those universal statements will not be known. In fact, even to formulate them is often a challenge.\n\nIf we knew, somehow, that all reasoning had to be deductive, we would have grounds for insisting that such reconstruction of a priori analogies is necessary. But we do not know this, and we have no such basis. Analogies are, and should be, appraised not by formulating and criticizing generalizations, but by careful consideration of the relevant similarities and differences between the cases considered. This point holds for both a priori and inductive analogies. (Wisdom, as explained, was emphasizing the former over the latter.)\n\nIn Moral Scepticism and Moral Knowledge, Renford Bambrough defends Wisdom’s claim that reasoning about cases is logically prior to reasoning by the application of universal claims or rules. If a case is to be settled, and we try to settle it by deducing a conclusion from a universal rule, the epistemological problem is that the universal rule already includes a resolution of this case. Bambrough says:\n\nOnce we are convinced that there will be no exceptions we may state our conclusion in the form of an exceptionless rule, but such a rule cannot be the fundamental ground upon which we accept a conclusion about one of its own instances. Whatever is to provide us with grounds for a conclusion about this instance of an argument in this form must take the form of considering other arguments, other instances. A rule will not do the work, for a rule cannot refer to the others without referring to this one as well. It does not compete, but simply awards itself the prize.8\n\nHere, Bambrough turns the tables on those who would make individual judgments about cases dependent on universal or general rules. He sees general rules as arbitrary considered simply in themselves and as gaining their credibility (implicitly or explicitly) from their correct application to instances. On this analysis, Bambrough follows Wisdom in thinking that cases can stand alone. Mill, Moore, and Wittgenstein also accepted this. But it is a minority position in philosophy. Philosophers have usually been inclined to have universal principles stand alone as ‘self-evident’ logical or moral truths.\n\n1b. The Universal and the Particular\n\nThe issue raised here is whether the universal or the particular is logically prior. We may say, with Wisdom, Moore, and Bambrough, that nothing can have greater force than a clearly understood particular case, and that what universal truths we know are in one way or another derived from our knowledge of such cases. Or, as is more common in a generalizing and theorizing discipline, we may regard particular cases as epistemically incomplete, as being mere expressions of intuition or common sense unless ‘grounded’ in universal principles. In fact, this general issue itself may be stated in a way that is too insensitive to particulars. Perhaps the truth is that what is epistemically prior varies from case to case and from context to context. But at the very least we can find in Wisdom and Bambrough, as in Mill, Moore, and Wittgenstein a useful, reminder that arguments from universal premises are not without their epistemic problems.\n\nDespite their insistence that analogical inference is a distinct type, Shaw and Ashley take the opposite view to Wisdom’s about particulars and universals. They see the general as more fundamental than the particular and urge that a full understanding of relevance and irrelevance depends on background theory. On their account, a full understanding of the cases compared in an analogy will ultimately require a background theory, in which we are told why certain features a,b,c are relevant to the judgment that cases x and y are of type e. Shaw and Ashley allow that analogies, both a priori and inductive, constitute a distinct type of argument. They acknowledge the epistemic difficulty of formulating and knowing the requisite generalization for remodelling the arguments. And yet they see the appeals to relevant similarities on which analogies depend are theoretically incomplete.\n\nConsistency is a basic constraint on human reasoning, and we must at the very least judge similar situations similarly …. even in the absence of a clear notion of relevance, the resemblance of two situations provides some warrant for the inference that what is right in one case is right in the other. But this may be thought to beg the question. Do we not need a theory to designate the relevant and irrelevant similarities? Ultimately yes. But in the meantime we have, prior to any particular normative theory, a perception of two situations as similar, and this is enough (along with our commitment to consistency) to provide some intrinsic plausibility to the analogical move.9\n\nWisdom would have regarded such a view as symptomatic of ‘Euclid’s disease’, an ailment he and Wittgenstein diagnosed in those who disparage particular cases and regard universal knowledge, by ‘criterion’ or general reason, as the only knowledge. He saw judgments about the relevance and significance of features of individual cases and resemblances between those features of cases as being ultimate, and as not requiring or being amenable to further justification by appeal to anything more basic. According to the manuscript of the Virginia Lectures, Barker asked Wisdom why it was that the particular case always had more epistemic force than a universal that might be cited in support. In raising that question, Barker suggested that each might have force and, in some context, require revision of the other. Barker, in effect, anticipated a version of Rawls’ influential view that we seek ‘reflective equilibrium’ between theoretical principles and nontheoretical judgments about particular cases. In response, Wisdom reiterated the predominance of the particular as a ground for generalization, saying:\n\nWhat most plainly presents the data on which the rest is based is the argument from particulars to particulars.10\n\nFollowing Wisdom, Bickenbach contended that a major symptom of Euclid’s disease is the belief that systematization is a precondition for genuine or complete understanding.11\n\nWhether the judgments about the relevance of various similarities and differences that underlie our evaluation of analogies are in some ultimate sense theory-dependent is a broad philosophical issue that cannot be resolved here. The notion of reflective equilibrium between theoretical and case judgments has been applied by Goodman to deductive and inductive logic and by Rawls and others to ethical and political theory. It requires that both particular judgments about cases and theoretical principles have some initial credibility. Sometimes it is reasonable for us to revise our pre-theoretical judgments about individual cases on the basis of principles; sometimes, we seek to build up theoretical principles on the bases of knowledge of cases. We may revise principles if they do not fit our judgments about particulars that would be subsumed under them. We may also revise our judgments about cases according to principles that we have accepted. Thus principles and case-based judgments must each be adjusted in the light of the other.12\n\nEven if the disputable view that the general is always logically prior to the particular were to be true, the pertinent background theories often do not yet exist. In the meantime, it is clear that analogies, both a priori and inductive, have a real epistemic use.\n\nHume’s Dialogues on Natural Religion contain many vivid illustrations of arguments of this type. Consider, for instance, this example:\n\nThe Brahmins assert that the world arose from an infinite spider, who spun this whole complicated mass from his bowels, and annihilates afterwards the whole or any part of it, by absorbing it again and resolving it into his own essence. Here is a species of cosmogony which appears to us ridiculous because a spider is a little contemptible animal whose operations we are never likely to take for a model of the whole universe. But still, here is a new species of analogy, even in our globe. And were there a planet wholly inhabited by spiders (which is very possible), this inference would there appear as natural and irrefragable as that which in our planet ascribes the origin of all things to design and orderly system and intelligence, as explained by Cleanthes. Why an orderly system may not be spun from the belly as well as the brain, it will be difficult for him to give a satisfactory reason.13\n\nThis argument is an a priori analogy between two arguments; the spider’s argument that the world has been spun from the bowels of an infinite spider is compared to the human’s argument that the world has been designed by an infinitely expanded human mind. Hume invites us to see the second argument as being as ridiculous as the first.\n\nApart from Hume, other prime philosophical sources for a priori analogies include Robert Nozick’s Anarchy, State, and Utopia, and Stanley Cavell’s The Claim of Reason. Given that this technique of arguing is common among philosophers, it is surprising that it has not received more attention from theorists.\n\nSuch analogies are common, not only in philosophical thinking about moral problems, but in ordinary non-philosophical thinking as well. Nor is this kind of reasoning restricted to the moral realm. It is also used in conceptual and interpretive contexts, by philosophers and others. Consistency reasoning is prominent in law, especially in the common law system where cases may be resolved by appeals to precedent. Even where there are explicit statutes, constituent terms are interpreted according to their prior application to cases. The core of legal reasoning is, as Wisdom noted, case by case. The appraisal of such reasoning requires careful attention to the similarities and differences between the cases, and a judgment as to how relevant these similarities and differences are to the decision at hand.\n\nA type of argument of obvious prominence and importance has been widely ignored by theorists. Probably this is due to the fact that it is less prominent in science and in mathematics than in moral life, law, administration, criticism, and philosophy. Philosophers have tended to construct theories of knowledge and argument as though positivism were true.\n\nCase-by-case reasoning as Wisdom describes it is not itself amenable to extensive theoretical analysis. Case-by-case reasoning is recalcitrant to treatment by general rules, because we cannot say in general what cases are going to be similar and why. This may lead us to think that endorsing it will lead inevitably to scepticism or relativism. But no such consequences follow.\n\nIn isolation from information about which cases are at issue and why they are being compared, what may be said? One possibility is to explore further cases. If two cases are deemed to possess feature e in virtue of other features a,b,c then that implies that the features a,b,c, function to establish e, other things being equal. This relationship should hold in general. If we find a third case in which the relationship does not hold, we then must seek further to see how that case might undermine the basis of the analogy. It might turn out that the new case differs from the original analogue with respect to some feature f and that it is f which undermines e. If so, the original analogy tacitly depended on the two compared cases both lacking feature f. By a close examination of relevantly similar and relevantly different cases, we can rationally adjudicate differences of belief as to whether comparisons are apt and whether particular similarities and differences are significant.\n\nIt is an open question as to whether we can set out a general ‘logic’ for appraising a priori analogies. Wisdom and others following him tend to write as though this could not be done. Their opinion has probably been shared by systematic logicians, who have always found analogy less interesting than deductive reasoning and empirical inductive reasoning. Whether a set of rules for the comparing and contrasting of cases can be devised remains to be seen. But even if it cannot, this would not entail that case-by-case reasoning fails to exist at all. Whether or not such reasoning is recalcitrant to systematization, it is real.\n\nMy point, like Wisdom’s, is not merely descriptive. It is normative as well. Case-by-case arguments, or a priori analogies, are both real and epistemically legitimate. I would urge that some such arguments are good ones and can establish a conclusion. Though rules may not exist to resolve disputes about the merits of these arguments, there remains room for rational debate and reasonable resolution. Similarities and differences can be pointed out, and the significance of these can be rationally discussed.\n\nTo the Euclidean theorist who is not satisfied with such a response, we can reply by turning the tables. Rules and generalizations do not stand independently. They themselves ultimately require justification, and in the final analysis will receive it from their application to cases.\n\n2. Carl Wellman and the Concept of Conductive Argument\n\nDo philosophers prove by chains of demonstrative reasoning what they wish to say or without attempting to support in any way one thing by another, just set out the self-evident or what appears to them self-evident? This question gives one a queer feeling because one wants to answer that they do both and neither … It is true that, when we read, for example, Hume’s appendix on the analysis of right and good or Broad on theories of the nature of matter, we find that a number of what Mill might call ‘considerations capable of influencing the intellect’ are advanced. But they are not connected chainwise. They bear independently upon the issue.14\n\nCarl Wellman’s Challenge and Response was ostensibly about meta-ethics, but in fact dealt largely with the subject of justification in general. Wellman devoted much time and care to discussing the question ‘What is justification?’, and had some rather unorthodox things to say in reply. He summed up his view as follows:\n\n… justification is to be understood essentially as a process of responding to challenges made. It may be observed and described as a psychological struggle in which one person tries to force another to back down, or one person struggles to come to terms with his own doubts and conflicting convictions. But it is more than a psychological struggle because at its core are certain critical claims to truth, validity, to be upsetting, to be reassuring, and to be adequate. Therefore the actual outcome of any particular psychological struggle never settles once and for all the issues being fought over in the process of justification. It is this peculiar ambivalence of justification that enables what we actually do in discussion and thinking to serve as a test of critical ideas like truth, validity, and being justified.15\n\nMuch justification proceeds by argument and Wellman said some interesting and unusual things about arguments in his book.\n\nWellman argued that the inductive/deductive dichotomy is not exhaustive and that there is at least one other type of argument, which he termed ‘conductive’. Wellman’s definitions of ‘deductive’ and ‘inductive’ are somewhat unusual. He defines deduction much as Copi does: a deductive argument is one in which the claim is made that the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises. In ethics, which is his primary concern, Wellman associates deduction with deriving conclusions about cases by subsuming the cases under general principles. Induction according to Wellman, is that sort of reasoning by which a hypothesis is confirmed or disconfirmed by establishing the truth or falsity of its implications. Conduction, a third type of reasoning, is distinct from both deduction and induction, being that sort of reasoning in which (1) a conclusion about some individual case (2) is drawn nonconclusively (3) from one or more premises about the same case (4) without any appeal to other cases. In conductive reasoning where there are several supporting premises, we draw together these independently relevant factors to support a conclusion. A conductive argument, then, depends crucially upon the concept of relevance. It differs from a deductive argument because the factors cited do not entail, and are not put forward as being sufficient for, the conclusion stated. It differs from an inductive argument in that it is not a case of confirming or disconfirming hypotheses by instances and in that (typically) separately relevant reasons are cited in support of a normative, conceptual, or philosophical conclusion. The issue is frequently not empirical.\n\nWellman sought to establish this third category of argument in order to show that there is more flexibility than most of us suppose in the matter of justifying conclusions. He was especially concerned to combat the common view that justification in ethics must be a matter of deriving particular conclusions from universal or general principles. On Wellman’s account there are at least three different types of ethical reasoning, all of which are used to justify conclusions about what we should do. First, we may deduce such conclusions from general principles, in cases where we are certain enough of such principles to use them in this way. Second, we may confirm or disconfirm general hypotheses using judgments about particular instances, thus reasoning inductively in Wellman’s sense. Third, we may support a conclusion about a particular problem by citing a fact or several facts that are nonconclusively relevant to it.\n\nSuppose one says, ‘You ought to take your son to the movie because you promised to do so, it is a good movie, and you have nothing better to do this afternoonâ. One is reasoning conductively to a conclusion about what to do.\n\nWellman’s discussion may appear less generally interesting than it is due to his contestable accounts of deduction and induction. There are problems with defining deductive arguments in terms of ‘claim to necessary connection’; in many arguments there is just nothing to indicate whether such a connection is claimed or not. Furthermore, Wellman unnecessarily limits himself to deduction from the universal to the particular. Obviously, there are other forms of deduction. Then again, Wellman’s definition of âinduction’ is highly idiosyncratic, as he recognizes himself. One might maintain that it is useful to have an account which allows for induction in a priori contexts. A problem arises because many modus tollens arguments, which are deductively valid, will count as inductive in Wellman’s sense. Consider, ‘If all my students are computer science majors, then since Joe is my student Joe will be a computer science major. But Joe is not a computer science major. Therefore the hypothesis that all my students are computer science majors is incorrect’ is an argument in which a hypothesis is disconfirmed by an instance. It is inductive according to Wellman’s definition. But obviously it is deductively valid. And it could be claimed to be deductive in Wellman’s sense too – it can easily be regarded as ‘claiming’ deductive validity. Wellmanâs notion of induction is too broad because it will include some deductively valid arguments to count as inductive. But it is also too narrow, given that causal reasoning, reasoning to the best explanation, and reasoning from generalizations based on past experience to a future case will not count as inductive in this sense. These results are highly (and unnecessarily) counter-intuitive. With such an unorthodox concept of ‘induction’ the claim that there is a distinct type of non-deductive and non-inductive reasoning may appear to be no more than the result of an unorthodox classificatory system.\n\nAs Wellman noted, but did not emphasize, conductive reasoning is not restricted to ethical contexts. It is common in contexts where we are trying to reach a decision about a classificatory issue, in interpretive contexts, and in contexts of philosophy and theory. Arguments that are conductive typically bring forward several relevant factors in the premises. It may happen that only one non conclusively relevant factor is cited; in this case, the difference between the conductive argument and a deductive one is that the factor is not sufficient and other factors, not mentioned, could have been mentioned to count as well.\n\nAlso, conductive argumentation is a favoured context for ‘pros’ and ‘cons’ in arguing. We may allow that there are factors relevant to the conclusion that count against it, mention these in the argument, and then cite supportive factors for the conclusion. We judge, and ask our audience to judge, that the supportive factors outweigh the counter considerations.\n\nConsider, for example, the following interpretive argument:\n\nHume is not a sceptic, for although he argues that our basic beliefs are not rationally justified, he rails against classical sceptics, and he maintains that we are as much determined to believe as we are to think and feel.\n\nThis is a conductive argument of the âpro and conâ type. One factor is cited which would count towards Hume being a sceptic, and two other factors are cited which would count against that view. The latter two factors are deemed to outweigh the first one so that the argument overall presents good reason to believe that Hume is a sceptic. Much actual reasoning seems to involve this kind of consideration of pros and cons, and estimating or ‘summing up’ their collective significance. A conductive argument may be the product of such reasoning about pros and cons. It will typically involve the specification of several such factors and adduce a conclusion on the basis of what the arguer takes to be their cumulative force.Â Such arguments had been tacitly recognized by other writers.\n\n2a. Related Views\n\nKurt Baier’s emphasis on ‘good reasons’ arguments in ethics is one case in point. In The Moral Point of View, first published in 1958, Kurt Baier described the variety of reasons available to justify moral conclusions, and seems to have had something like conductive arguments in mind. He said:\n\nTo say that a certain fact is a consideration, a pro or a con, is to say that this fact gives rise to a presumption, namely, that the agent ought or ought not to enter on the course of action in relation to which the fact is a pro or a con. Exactly the same point is made when it is claimed that some reasons are prima-facie reasons, or reasons other things being equal. All that is meant is that the facts which are the reasons give rise merely to a presumption that the agent ought or ought not to enter on the line contemplated.16\n\nBoth Michael Scriven and Stephen Thomas noted the existence of arguments in which distinct factors cumulate, or converge, to support a conclusion. However, in neither case was there much discussion of such arguments as a distinct type.17 Thomas, in fact, incorporated theorizing inconsistent with the claim. As a result of my critical notice in the Informal Logic Newsletter, calling attention to Wellman’s account and arguing for its significance, David Hitchcock incorporated a recognition of conductive arguments in his textbook. In general, however, Wellman’s account did little to upset philosophers’ confidence in deductivism and positivism as theories of ordinary argumentation.\n\nThe notion of conductive argument does not owe its interest solely to Wellman’s somewhat idiosyncratic classificatory system. The idea that in many arguments the basic notion is that of nonconclusive relevance and that such arguments readily incorporate ‘pro and con’ considerations is important and had been explicitly or tacitly recognized by other analysts. What I should like to do here is endorse Wellman’s ideas about relevance and pros and cons and drop some other features of his account. I do not wish to endorse his definitions of ‘induction’ and ‘deduction’, nor his limitation of conductive reasoning to contexts where a particular conclusion is defended. Wellman made conductive arguments by definition about particular cases. But this seems unfortunate, as it is easy to think of examples where separate facts are cited to nonconclusively support generalization. Consider, for instance:\n\nBlacks are equal to whites because they are as healthy as whites, they are biologically similar to whites, they are as intelligent as whites, and they share basic needs with whites.\n\nWhatever the substantive merits of this argument, we can readily see that it is based on separate nonconclusively relevant premises. It is the sort of argument where ‘cons’ could be acknowledged and ‘weighed’ with the ‘pros’. The various premises about blacks and whites are separately relevant to the conclusion in the sense that if one were false, the others would remain unaffected. Thus the example fits much of what Wellman has to say, and yet the conclusion is not particular in form. Clearly, we may reason about cases by citing relevant factors, and in addition, much conductive reasoning is about cases. However, conductive reasoning may also be used to support conclusions that are general or universal in form.\n\nConductive argument and a priori analogy are distinct types. Wellman says that in conduction the link between premises and conclusion is not established on the basis of the experience of analogous cases; it is entirely a priori.\n\nConductive reasoning and Wisdom’s case-by-case reasoning fit into a similar gap unnoticed by many who have supported deductivist and positivist theories of argument. Both deal with nonempirical reasoning that is nonconclusive, or at least not ‘conclusive’ in the deductive sense. Conductive arguments require separately relevant non-sufficient factors and readily admit counterconsiderations as part of the argument; a priori analogies use comparison of cases to press for consistency of treatment, and depend fundamentally on the concept of relevant similarity.\n\nTo clarify the contrast between conductive arguments and others, it is useful to refer to different ways premises may combine to support conclusions in multi-premise arguments. These different styles of support have to do with the structural arrangement of premises, and not with the strength or character of the support those premises are able to give to a conclusion. Nor do they concern the truth or plausibility of the premises. They concern the diagramming of arguments, not their classification or inferential appraisal. The classic accounts of this style of support are Beardsley’s early text and Thomas’ text on reasoning in natural language. The latter is justly famous for its exposition of structure and adaptation of Beardsley’s techniques. The distinction presented is between convergent and linked argumentation.18 When the pattern of support is linked, one premise is not even relevant to the conclusion without the others. In a convergent support pattern, premises bear separately upon the conclusion. All conductive arguments exemplify the convergent pattern or support, except in the limiting case where there is only one premise. However, the converse does not hold, as Wellman was careful to note. It is possible to offer an argument which exemplifies the convergent support pattern, in whic"
