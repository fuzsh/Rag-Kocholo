        "text": "The 2nd Nordic Interdisciplinary Conference on Discourse and Interaction, NORDISCO 2012 will be held 21.11.12-23.11.12 at Linköping University, Sweden.\n\nFirst call for papers:\n\nDeadline for abstract submissions: 15 March 2012 –\n\nAfter its initial successes in Aalborg, Denmark, in November 2010, NORDISCO is emerging as a biennial event, whose goal is to create a Nordic and Baltic forum bringing together researchers and doctoral students who are investigating discourse and interaction from a wide range of disciplinary perspectives. It is now our pleasure at Linköping University, Sweden, to host NORDISCO 2012, in the hope that the second Nordic and Baltic interdisciplinary conference will give rise to creative synergies and facilitate new networks, crossing both geographical and disciplinary borders. The focus of the conference is on the organisation, structure and constitution of text, discourse, talk and social interaction. We therefore welcome researchers’ contributions from different and diverse fields of enquiry, including – but not limited to – discourse studies, conversation analysis, discursive psychology, critical discourse analysis, interaction analysis, rhetoric, narrative analysis, discourse theory, political discourse analysis, social semiotics, multimodal discourse analysis, applied linguistics, gesture studies and communication activism, as well as approaches to discourse and interaction to be found in sociology, political science, environmental science, economics, media studies and cultural studies.

In accounts of philosophy curricula, unfortunately, reference to informal logic is typically just name-dropping, as the textbook authors are mostly not scholars in the field, and instructors rarely have any relevant training. That seems to be the case here: Colorado State has only one logician on faculty, and he specializes in formal logic.\n\nThis problem is deeply ironic, for the scholarship being neglected was developed for the very purpose of filling the gap between logical theory and logical practice. Much scholarship in symbolic logic may be irrelevant to undergraduate pedagogy, but informal logic is a movement developed substantially for the purpose of creating an approach to logic that would be more relevant to students.\n\nWhen philosophers appeal to “informal logic” or philosophers claim ownership over the teaching of “critical thinking,” it verges on fraud. The baiting with informal logic scholarship devoted to critical thinking and switching it for a loose distillation of the cultural standards in the discipline of philosophy is going to catch up with us eventually.\n\nIt’s time for philosophers to wake up and put our money, our faculty positions, our textbook buying power, and our textbook reviews where the scholarship is. Philosophy can be highly relevant if we hold ourselves to higher scholarly standards.\n\nRead Full Post »\n\nLet’s be honest about this, coverage of the Occupy movement has neither been fair nor balanced in most cases. What coverage there has been has usually centered on 1) how much of a mess these sites are making, 2) on how the absence of explicit demands makes them “incoherent”, and 3) on how the major political parties may or may not try to turn the frustrations of the protesters to their advantage in the coming national election cycle. Much of the coverage that I’ve seen has focused on the second of these items, on how the protests seem to be just a sort of collective “acting out”. “With no clear message”, so goes the refrain, “how can the Occupy protesters hope to achieve their aims (whatever they are)?” (more…)\n\nRead Full Post »\n\nToday CRRAR announced the publication of two new books that should be of interest to those working in the fields of argumentation studies and informal logic. The first is a collection of papers by co-founder of the informal logic movement J. Anthony Blair. The volume collects works spanning 30 years of research of one of the most respected scholars in the field.\n\nGroundwork in the Theory of Argumentation, Selected Papers of J. Anthony Blair, with an Introduction by Christopher W. Tindale. Dordrecht: Springer, 2012. Pp. xxii, 1-355. (List price: cloth $189.00, €149,75)\n\n[ Contents: Introduction; 23 papers by Blair; list of Blair’s publications; References; Name and Subject Indexes]\n\nThe second work announced today collects papers from the CRRAR symposium on conductive argument held in 2010. I had the good fortune to be present at that event and I can attest firsthand that there is much of interest contained within these pages. There were papers from a diverse range of perspectives and approaches within argumentation theory and they covered many aspects of the topic of conductive argument. I’m very happy to announce that this collection of papers is now available to all.\n\nConductive Argument, An Overlooked Type of Defeasible Reasoning Ed. by J. Anthony Blair and Ralph H. Johnson. London: College Publications, 2012. Pp. viii, 1-299. (List price: paper $20.75)\n\n[Contents: Intro. by Blair; Papers by Derek Allen, Mark Battersby & Sharon Bailin, Maurice Finocchiaro, Thomas Fischer, James Freeman, Trudy Govier, Hans Hansen, Rongdong Jin, Ralph Johnson, Fred Kauffeld, Christian Kock, Robert Pinto, Douglas Walton, Harald Wohlrapp, Frank Zenker; References; Name and Subject Indexes]\n\nRead Full Post »\n\nCall for papers: Journal of Evaluation in Clinical Practice\n\nThe past few years have seen a resurgence of interest in the philosophy of medicine and health care. Controversies about evidence, value, clinical knowledge, judgment, integrity and ethics have required practitioners and policy-makers to confront the epistemic and moral basis of practice, while philosophers have found in these debates ways to invigorate and reframe the investigation of long-standing philosophical problems about: the nature of reasoning, science, knowledge and practice, and the relationships between epistemology and ethics, morals and politics.\n\nThe Journal of Evaluation in Clinical Practice is an international journal that focuses on the evaluation and development of clinical practice in medicine, nursing and the allied health professions. It has a large and diverse readership including practitioners and academics from a vast range of areas, and a tradition of publishing papers raising epistemological, metaphysical and ethical issues underlying clinical policy and practice. Following the publication of two highly successful thematic issues in 2010 and 2011 on the philosophy of medicine and health care, we are seeking contributions to a third thematic edition, scheduled for publication in autumn 2012. Papers are particularly welcome on the following themes.\n\n1) Reasoning in Medicine.\n\nPossible questions/topics include: what is the role and what are the limitations of statistical reasoning in medicine? What alternative accounts of reasoning are available? If arguments are somehow at the core of medical reasoning, what are the sorts of argumentation skills we need to nurture in health care? What role do intuition and emotion play in a proper account of sound decision-making? How should we understand such ideas as judging, perceiving and interpreting and their role in reasoning in a range of contexts: clinical, policy, population/ public health?\n\n2) Value, meaning and measurement.\n\nPossible questions/topics include: how do we represent meaning and value in health care and are our representations adequate? How do we account for the value of ‘unquantifiable’ aspects of these processes? What is the relationship between epistemology and ethics in discussions of value? What are the criteria used to assess health care? (Which ‘outcomes’? what counts as ‘quality’? How is health gain assessed and valued in relation to other aspects of health care process/experience?) How do we defend expenditure on health care in the context of the current global environment?\n\nHowever, we also welcome papers that do not fit neatly into one of these themes, but represent excellent examples of the application of philosophy to questions of substantive import in medicine and healthcare.\n\nThe deadline for submission of manuscripts is 30th April 2012. Original papers are usually no more than 5000 words in length, and detailed author guidelines are available at http://www.wiley.com/bw/submit.asp?ref=1356-1294&site=1\n\nThose interested in submitting a paper are invited to contact Robyn Bluhm (Old Dominion University) at rbluhm@odu.edu\n\nRead Full Post »\n\nAh, the wonders of Twitter. In a chain of argumentation that wandered around quite a bit today, the question of improvisation (what it is, how best to characterize it, etc.) came up. For those RAIL readers who are classically trained rhetoricians, this question will no doubt call to mind Book Ten of Quintillian’s Institutio Oratoria, which deals with extemporaneous speech. This led to the contribution of the video below by one of the participants.\n\nThe expansive talk herein is by George E. Lewis, the Edwin H. Case Professor of American Music at Columbia University. The general gist of it is that much of human interaction is understandable as improvisation (as understood in a manner analogous to the sort that occurs in musical performance). If this were right, then interesting consequences would follow for argumentation, at least when argumentation is considered as a dialectical process between two or more persons. For starters, one such consequence would be that argumentation needs to be seen more as a cooperative than a competitive phenomenon. Accordingly, many of the “moves” of various participants would have to be understood outside the scope of strategies for “winning”. There are other potential results too, I think, but they’re likely to appear differentially according to the approach to argumentation one takes. (For example, I find myself wondering with great interest how those working within the framework of normative pragmatics would understand improvisation in argumentation, but I’ll leave the answering of that wonder to those more qualified than I to speak on it.)\n\nIt is an interesting talk, but be warned: it is a little on the longish side and it’s general orientation from within a Continental philosophical framework may not be everyone’s cup of tea. If, knowing that, you’re not scared, then have go at it!\n\nI would be remiss if I did not thank consummate jazz musician Vijay Iyer 1) for getting involved in our Twitter conversation at all and 2) for posting the above video in the hopes of enlightening us as to the nature and power of improvisation. In return, I post this video of his wonderful trio covering Michael Jackson’s “Human Nature” in which they, yes, improvise delightfully.\n\nRead Full Post »"
