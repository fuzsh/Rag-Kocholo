Several scholarly societies and associations and various .aca­ demic journals are devoted to argumentation. A great number of books and articles concentrate on this subject. It is also the focus of attention at many conferences, symposia, and courses. The growing interest in argumentation is an international phenomenon. It is not restricted to one discipline, being appar­ ent in philosophy, logic, linguistics, discourse analysis, rhetoric, speech commu­ nication, education, psychology, sociology, political science, law, and many other disciplines. Recently, some multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary approaches to argumentation have also been developed. Because of the complexity, diversity and rate of developments in the study of argumentation, one might easily lose sight of the ways in which argumentation theory has matured. The authors of this book therefore think that a compre­ hensive survey of the various theoretical contributions is now worthwhile.\n\ndamentals\n\nof Argumentation\n\nTheory is intended to\n\nFun­\n\nserve this purpose. Although\n\nit stands to reason that choices had to be made and that not all contributions could be equally accentuated, it essentially describes the historical works that provide the background to the field of argumentation studies and the contem­ porary developments that make it prosper. All major trends in current research are discussed and all prominent approaches which are (at least partly) acces­ sible in English. The present volume originates in part with vington,\n\n1984),\n\nThe Study\n\nand ljark Kruiger, and republished as the Handbook\n\n1987).\n\nof Argumentation (Ir­\n\njointly authored by Frans H. van Eemeren, Rob Grootendorst,\n\nofArgumentation Theory (Foris,\n\nBecause argumentation theory has advanced considerably since the\n\nmanuscript for this book was completed\n\n(1980),\n\nit has been apparent for some\n\nix\n\nX\n\nPREFACE\n\ntime that it was being overtaken by new developments. It became clear that a substantially new study would be needed, and it was decided to write\n\nmentals of Argumentation Theory\n\nFunda­\n\nwith that idea in mind. The first three authors,\n\nFrans van Eemeren, Rob Grootendorst, and Francisca Snoeck Henkemans, acted as \"writers-in-chief.\" They wrote\n\nFundamentals\n\ntogether with their colleagues\n\nAnthony Blair, Ralph Johnson, Erik Krabbe, Christian Plantin, Douglas Walton, Charles Willard, John Woods, and David Zarefsky, all specialists in the field. The resulting book is altogether the authors' joint responsibility. It goes without saying that a comprehensive book such as\n\nArgumentation Theory could\n\nFundamentals of\n\nhardly be written without the help of a great many\n\nothers. Various members of the research group for Argumentation and Dis­ course Analysis of the Institute for Functional Research of Language and Lan­ guage Use of the University of Amsterdam, the Free University of Amsterdam and the State University of Leiden have been helpful in improving the manu­ script. The authors would like to thank Antoine Braet, Petra Boers, Eveline Feteris, Bart Garssen, Janne-Maaike Gerlofs, Susanne Gerritsen, Peter Hout­ losser, Agnes van Rees, Maarten van der To!, Erik Viskil, Shi-Xu, and the associ­ ated members of the Erasmus University Rotterdam, Ton van Haaften, Harm Kloosterhuis, and Jose Plug, for their useful suggestions. They also want to thank Bart Garssen, Peter Houtlosser, and Paul Nagtegaal for their technical and bib­ liographical assistance. In addition, the authors were fortunate enough to find a number of their most distinguished colleagues, from various parts of the world, willing to advise them. All of these argumentation scholars read parts of the manuscript; many sug­ gested important corrections and clarifications, some proposed elaborations or additions. Their comments have been crucial in getting the book published in its present form. The authors therefore make a point of emphasizing that their support has been invaluable. As a token of their appreciation, they have listed the names of these generous colleagues.\n\nACKNOWLEDGM ENT The authors would like to express their gratitude to the following colleagues who have been of help in preparing this book: William van Belle, Catholic University of Leuven Marie-Jeanne Borel, University of Lausanne Dale Brashers, University of Ohio Georg Brutian, National Academy of Sciences Armenia Adelino Cattani, University of Padua Robert Craig, University of Colorado at Boulder Maurice Finocchiaro, University of Nevada Las Vegas\n\nPREFACE\n\nAlec Fisher, University of East Anglia James Freeman, City University of New York Bice Mortara Garavelli, University of Turin Thomas Goodnight, Northwestern University Trudy Govier, Calgary Hans Hansen, Brock University David Hitchcock, McMaster University Hamilton Paul van den Hoven, University of Utrecht Sally Jackson, University of Arizona Scott Jacobs, University of Arizona Henry Johnstone Jr., Pennsylvania State University Manfred Kienpointner, University of Innsbruck Vincenzo Lo Cascio, University of Amsterdam Robert Maier, University of Utrecht Jo Martens, Polytechnic Eindhoven Sebastian McEvoy, Ecole des Hautes Etudes en Sciences Sociales, Paris Denis Mieville, University of Neuchatel Wim de Pater, Catholic University of Leuven Robert Pinto, University of Windsor Marc van der Poe!, Catholic University Nijmegen Igno Propper, Free University Amsterdam Peter Jan Schellens, University of Twente Harvey Siegel, University of Miami Tanya Tretyakova, St. Petersburg University lneke Vedder, University of Amsterdam Frank Veltman, University of Amsterdam Barbara Warnick, University of Washington Joseph Wenzel, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign Rob Wiehe, Association of Universities in the Netherlands Jaap Wisse, University of Leiden Harald Wohlrapp, University of Hamburg\n\nxi\n\nThis page intentionally left blank\n\nWith mortals, gold outweighs a thousand arguments. -Medea.\n\nIn Euripides,\n\nMedea and other Plays.\n\nTrans. and Intr. by\n\nPhilip Vellacott.

The following three quota­ tions are examples of argumentation:\n\n(a) Mother to daughter: Forget about vacationing all by yourself. No way! When your sister was fourteen, we didn't let her go either. (b) Tom: Of course I'm in favor of heavier punishment for drug addicts. Jim: Why? Tom: Wel l, otherwise the problem will get worse and worse. Jim: How do you mean? Tom: You know, soon enough the rumor spreads that not much is going to happen, even if you get caught, so they'll all have a go at it. (c) Letter to the Editor. Sir, When consideration is being given to a third television channel could not a way be found round the \"advertising break\" problem by devoting the new channel entirely to advertising? In that way the present commercial channel could be left free from program me breaks (natural or otherwise), thus satisfying those of us who object to these interruptions while those millions who are al leged to prefer \"the adverts\" will also be made more happy in their viewing. Yours faithfully, E.H. Dare Nobody will have much trouble in identifying such examples as specimens of argumentation as argumentation is present in virtually all our verbal communi­ cation. Both oral and written argumentation are indeed integral parts of our\n\n2\n\nFUNDAMENTALS OF ARGUMENTATION THEORY\n\ndaily routines. We all regularly engage in argumentative practices, when we advance arguments in defense of certain assertions or actions and when we react to arguments put forward by others. Argumentation is a\n\nverbal activity,\n\nwhich is normally conducted in an ordi­\n\nnary language (such as English). A speaker or writer, engaged in argumentation, uses certain words and sentences to state, question, or deny something, to respond to statements, questions or denials, and so on.1 Just as other verbal activities, argumentation may well be accompanied by the use of nonverbal means of communication, such as facial expression and gestures, but not to the extent that the verbal expressions are completely replaced by the nonverbal ones. Without the use of language, there can be no argumentation. Argumentation is a\n\nsocial\n\nactivity, which in principle is directed at other\n\npeople.2 Of course, the social nature of argumentation is most clearly evident in a discourse between two or more interlocutors. All the same, even when people are conferring with themselves, contemplating the pros and cons of their own ideas, their conduct is basically social. For as soon as they start weighing up the various considerations, this amounts to an anticipation of an interlocu­ tor's possible reactions, even if these reactions are only their own. Thus, when people put forward their arguments, they attempt to meet the outspoken or tacit reactions of others. Argumentation is an activity of\n\nreason,\n\nwhich indicates that the arguer has\n\ngiven some thought to the subject. Putting forward an argument means that the arguer attempts to show that a rational account can be given of his or her position on the matter. This is not to say that emotions cannot play a part in adopting a position, but that these internal motives, which have been assimilated in the discourse, are not directly relevant as such. When people put forward their arguments in argumentation they place their considerations within the realm of reason. In the discourse, argumentation always relates to a particular opinion, or\n\nstandpoint,\n\nabout a specific subject.3 The need for argumentation arises when\n\nopinions concerning this subject differ or are supposed to differ. By itself, holding an opinion is not enough to initiate argumentation. Arguing makes sense only if there is a listener or reader who entertains doubt about an opinion or has a diverging opinion. Argumentation starts from the presumption, rightly or wrongly, that the standpoint of the arguer is not immediately accepted, but is\n\ncontroversial. 1For brevity's sake, we shall usually refer to the participants in an argumentation as speaker and listener when, mutatis mutandis, our remarks apply to a writer and a reader as well. 2In this general characterization we neither differentiate between addressing an audience consisting of one person and addressing (perhaps over the heads of those officially addressed) a broader audience consisting of a variety of people, nor do we differentiate between speakers or writers speaking only on behalf of themselves and those acting as representatives of others. 30ther virtual synonyms of the term \"standpoint,\" used by various authors, are view, viewpoint, point of view, claim , thesis, etc.\n\n1. INTRODUCTION\n\n3\n\nA difference of opinion may be completely overt and explicit-it being clear to all that the interlocutor does not share the arguer's standpoint-but in prac­ tice the controversy will often remain covert and implicit. The standpoint itself may also remain obscure. It can vary in firmness, nature, and scope. A stand­ point that is presented as absolute (\"It is certain that litmus reacts to acid by changing color\") is firmer than a more restrained standpoint (\"It is likely that not all top sportsmen take stimulants\"). A standpoint pertaining to a factual judgment, a claim that a certain state of affairs obtains (\"No such journal exists\"), is different in nature from a standpoint referring to a value judgment (\"This journal is not very good\"). And a standpoint referring to all members of a certain class (\"All writers are intelligent\") has a wider scope than a standpoint referring to only one member (\"Jane Austen is an intelligent writer\"). Standpoints, hence differences of opinion, can be about all kinds of subjects, from economics, psychology, and politics to sex, entertainment, and the weather. They can be expressed by affirmative or negative \"objective\" state­ ments, but also by personal judgments, and even by questions and imperatives. Standpoints of any type might give rise to argumentation. A few examples may illustrate the diversity:\n\n(1)\n\nLitmus reacts to acid by changing color.\n\n(2)\n\nAmsterdam is the capital of the Netherlands.\n\n(3)\n\nIf you ask me, not all top sportsmen take stimulants.\n\n(4)\n\nIn my opinion Satie's \"Prelude de Ia porte heroique du ciel\" is superb.\n\n(5)\n\nI think one should help one's fellow men in times of need.\n\n(6) Wouldn't it be nicer if people in academic circles were a little more tolerant? As shown by the examples, a standpoint may be marked as such by the use of\n\nphrases like \"in my opinion,\" \"I think,\" and \"if you ask me.\" In ordinary discourse, however, such indicators are frequently absent. Thus, it is perfectly usual to present a standpoint by a statement consisting simply of the utterance of an unmarked (impersonal) indicative sentence, or even by a question. For an ut­ terance to count as the expression of a standpoint, it is crucial that the person involved may be considered to have taken position for or against a certain proposition about the subject of discourse. Standpoints can only play their part in argumentative discourse if the people who advance them are committed to the stands they have taken and can be called upon to defend them. Argumentation is intended to justify one's standpoint, or to\n\nrefute\n\nsomeone\n\nelse's.4 In an argumentative justification of a standpoint one is attempting to\n\n40!\n\ncourse, people may also have other motives for arguing, such as showing how clever\n\nor likeable they are, but these objectives, which can be pursued simultaneously, are secondary.\n\nFUNDAMENTALS OF ARGUMENTATION THEORY\n\n4\n\ndefend the standpoint by showing that it conveys an acceptable proposition; in an argumentative refutation one is to attack the standpoint by showing that the proposition is unacceptable whereas the opposite, or contradictory, proposition is acceptable.5 Justifying or refuting a standpoint by way of argumentation, as in advancing standpoints, proceeds by putting forward propositions. In the case of argumentation, however, the\n\nconstellation of propositions\n\nhas, due to its justi­\n\nficatory or refutatory force, a special communicative function. In an attempt to justify a standpoint, the constellation of propositions con­ sists of one or more\n\npro-arguments\n\n(\"reasons for\"); in an attempt to refute a\n\nstandpoint, it consists of one or more\n\ncontra-arguments\n\n(\"reasons against\"). In\n\npractice, arguers often restrict themselves to putting forward either pro-argu­ mentation or contra-argumentation. In principle, however, these two activities are interdependent: pro-arguments often presuppose certain contra-arguments, and vice versa. They are, in fact, complementary tools for testing the accept­ ability of a standpoint. Argumentation is aimed at\n\nincreasing (or decreasing) the acceptability\n\nof a\n\ncontroversial standpoint for the listener or reader. The constellation of propo­ sitions put forward by the arguer is calculated to achieve that purpose by convincing or persuading the audience. It depends not only on the intrinsic qualities of the arguments whether or not the approbation of the audience will be gained, but also on the audience's qualities in evaluating them. The more sophisticated the audience, the better it can fulfil a critical function in testing the strength of the argumentation for (or against) the standpoint. In advancing argumentation, arguers submit their arguments to the scrutiny of the audience. In principle, the very act of arguing involves an appeal, for better or worse, to the audience's reasonableness. In a reasonable evaluation, the audience must determine the extent to which the argumentation renders the standpoint acceptable. The appeal to reasonableness would be pointless if the audience were not presumed to evaluate the argumentation as a\n\njudge.6\n\nrational\n\nIn order to comply with this requirement the audience should evaluate\n\nthe argumentation on the basis of sound standards. In practice, arguers addressing an audience with a view to justifying or refuting a standpoint will generally presume that there are certain standards available for judging the quality of argumentation. They will also presume that these standards will be applied by the audience in evaluating the argumentation.\n\n5This is \"strong refutation.\" In \"weak refutation\" it is sufficient to cast doubt upon the attacked standpoint, without a defen s e of the opposite standpoint. Weak refutation is not argumentation in the strict sense, though it is an important ingredient of the argumentative process. 6A reasonable evaluation of argumentation is optimally based on rational evaluation criteria rather than tradition, prejudice and uncontrolled sentiments. In the evaluation of a rational judge emotions play a (motivational) part only insofar as they have become \"rationalized\" (and are open to criticism).\n\n5\n\n1. INTRODUCTION\n\nOtherwise their argumentation would be futile. Of course, the standards arguers have in mind are not necessarily those of a rational judge, and arguers can be wrong in thinking that the audience shares their standards. Having thus unraveled the main aspects of the meaning of the word\n\ntation,\n\nargumen­\n\nwe can now clarify the argumentation theorists' object of study by pro­\n\nviding a general definition. This definition is descriptive in the sense that it is closely connected to the way in which the word argumentation is used in ordinary language. This means, for one thing, that its \"process-product ambigu­ ity\" is retained. Argumentation refers not only to the process of arguing (\"I'm almost through with my argumentation\"), but also to the product resulting from it (\"The argumentation as it stands is not convincing\"). The definition is also stipulative in the sense that it introduces a terminologi­ cal convention. The meaning given by this convention to the term argumentation is more precise than that which is normally assigned to it by ordinary language users. It is not only more explicit, but also more comprehensive. The reason for this being that in this way one obtains a clear common denominator of the subject matter under investigation in the study of argumentation. The specific additional meanings attached to the term argumentation by various argumen­ tation theorists can then be more easily brought into perspective. The general characteristics of argumentation are then recapitulated in the following definition:\n\nArgumentation is a verbal and social activity of reason aimed at increasing (or decreas­ ing) the acceptability of a controversial standpoint for the listener or reader, by putting forward a constellation of propositions intended to justify (or refute) the standpoint before a rational judge.\n\n1 .2\n\nARGUMENTATION AN D LOG IC\n\nThe study o f argumentation is, b y outsiders, often too easily identified with \"doing logic.\" In order to illustrate some of the differences between the problems argumentation theorists are interested in and those currently studied in logic, let us take as our point of departure the following dialogue in colloquial speech:\n\nDale: Sally: Dale:\n\nSally: Dale:\n\nMary said she was going to get beef or cod. Do you know what we're eating tonight? No, but if she's already done the shopping it'll probably be in the fridge. Well, she rang me about her essay, and she told me then that she's already done the shopping because she wanted to go on working this afternoon. I'll have a quick look in the fridge . . . It's stacked full. But I can't smell fish, anyway. O.K., shall we get some mushrooms to go with the beef?\n\nFUNDAMENTALS OF ARGUMENTATION THEORY\n\n6\n\nIn this conversation, Dale deduces from what Sally says and does (looking in the refrigerator), and from what Mary told him, that there is beef in the refrig­ erator. Because Mary has done the shopping and is in the habit of putting the shopping in the refrigerator, Sally and Dale think that the shopping is in the refrigerator. Looking into the refrigerator, Sally does not smell any fish. Both Sally and Dale apparently deduce that there is no fish in the refrigerator. More­ over, Dale concludes that Mary has bought beef because she was going to get beef or cod and has not bought cod. Although Dale does not really state this conclusion, it is clear to Sally that he has drawn it. It is presupposed in his question \"Shall we get some mushrooms to go with the beef?\" Although Dale and Sally reach their conclusions through reasoning, they do not engage in argumentation. Their conclusions are arrived at by way of (im­ plicit) deduction. No standpoint is defended by either of them, neither explicitly nor implicitly. At this point, a first and crucial difference between the primary interests of argumentation theorists and those of contemporary logicians is to be mentioned. Argumentation theorists study the way in which people take up standpoints and defend these standpoints, whereas logicians tend to concen­ trate on the way in which conclusions are derived from premises. Other differences are connected with the present set-up of logic as the study of formal reasoning patterns and its methodological starting points. These dif­ ferences can be illustrated by slightly altering our example, so that it involves argumentation. Let us assume that Dale concludes the conversation as follows: Dale:\n\nO.K., as I see it, it is beef tonight, since it was either that or cod and there is no fish. Shall we get some mushrooms to go with the beef?\n\nWhen studying reasoning, modern logicians confine themselves to the \"formal validity\" of arguments, disregarding the actual reasoning processes and the contextual surroundings in which they take place. Although abstracting from the actual discourse has been highly beneficial to the development of logic, it has been detrimental to the study of argument as envisaged by argumentation theorists. Restricting the study of argument to formal reasoning patterns leads to the exclusion of many important problems of reasoned discourse. Conse­ quently, the discourse as an attempt to justify (or refute) a standpoint before a rational judge cannot be fully dealt with. On the basis of the amended example, it can be shown which methodological abstraction steps are made in formal logic.7 The first step in the abstraction process makes the study of argument inde­ pendent of the situation in which the arguments happen to occur. Departing from the literal wording of the conversation or text, a discourse is interpreted\n\n7This exposition of abstraction steps in formal logic is to a large extent based on Nuchelmans (1976, pp. 173-180).\n\n1 . INTRODUCTION\n\n7\n\nin such a way that implicit elements are made explicit. In the case of Dale's argument, this would result in something like the following: Dale:\n\nIt was either beef or cod. There is no fish. If there is no fish, we are not going to eat cod. Therefore, it is beef tonight.\n\nPart of Sally's reasoning can be rendered as follows: Sally:\n\nIf Mary did the shopping, then the shopping is in the refrigerator. Mary did the shopping. Therefore the shopping is in the refrigerator.\n\nThe second abstraction makes the argument independent of the participants involved, and even of people in general. Regarding every argument as an imper­ sonal linking of premises and a conclusion, what remains to be studied are the connections between the opinion expressed in the conclusion and the justifying propositions that are expressed in the premises.8 In our example, this can be achieved by omitting Dale and Sally and writing out their statements as deper­ sonalized sentences. The third abstraction involves presenting the argument in standard form. Different wordings of the same information are eliminated so that expressional variants of sentences are formulated in a uniform manner. The indicators prem­ ise and conclusion are added. This produces the following arguments in standard form: argument 1\n\npremise: premise: premise: conclusion:\n\nWe are going to eat beef or we are going to eat cod. There is no fish. If there is no fish, we are n ot going to eat cod. We are going to eat beef.\n\nargument 2\n\npremise: premise: conclusion:\n\nIf Mary did the shopping, then the shopping is in the refrigerator. Mary did the shopping. The shopping is in the refrigerator.\n\nThe fourth abstraction renders the arguments in such a form that expressions having a special meaning to logicians become more prominent. This concerns, for instance, words that link the sentences to one another such as \"or\" and \"if .. . then,\" and the word \"no(t),\" which also appears in the example. Individual sentences are abridged while the logically important words \"or,\" \"if . . . then,\" &rhis abstraction is illustrated in definitions of \"argument\" in logic textbooks. Berger ( 1 977, p. 3), for instance, says that arguments are usually defined by logicians in the first place as lists of sentences, one of which is regarded as the conclusion and the rest as the base for that conclusion.\n\nFUNDAMENTALS OF ARGUMENTATION THEORY\n\n8\n\nand \"not\" are written in full, so that they are clearly differentiated from the \"content\" part of the sentences composing the argument. It is now immaterial how the arguments were worded in English (or any other language). The sen­ tences may, therefore, be replaced by arbitrary (capital) letters (A, B, C, etc.), as long as the same sentence is represented by the same letter. Logicians call these \"abbreviations\" sentence constants, or constants for short. In our example, this abstraction would lead to the following notation: abbreviations\n\nB: C: F: S: R:\n\nWe are going to eat beef. We are going to eat cod. There is fish. Mary did the shopping. The shopping is in the refrigerator.\n\nargument I\n\npremises: conclusion:\n\nB or C, not F, if not F then not C B\n\nargument 2\n\npremises: conclusion:\n\nif S then R, S R\n\nIn the fifth abstraction step, the logically relevant expressions are replaced by logical constants, thereby translating them into a logical language in which these constants have a standardized meaning. 9 The last reminders of ordinary language in our example, \"or,\" \"if . . . then,\" and \"not,\" are thus removed. The meanings of the logical constants used in these translations are laid down in propositional logic, the logic that deals with logical constants of this type. In the language of proposi­ tional logic, these logical constants are symbolized as v (\"or\"), � (\"if . . . then\") and --,(\"not\"). 10 Using the symbol I:. to indicate the conclusion, the arguments in our example can then be translated in the following way: argument I\n\nBvC ...,f ...,f�...,c f:. B argument 2\n\nS�R s\n\n/:. R 91t should thus be clear that much more is involved in translating expressions from natural language into logical constants than in abbreviating sentences by sentence constants. 100ther (systems of) symbols for these logical constants are also current. See Schagrin (1968).\n\n1 . INTRODUCTION\n\n9\n\nThe logical constants appearing in this example are:--, (negation), v (disjunction), and � (material implication); another important logical constant of propositional logic is A (conjunction), the logical \"equivalent\" of \"and.\" The meanings of these logical constants are much more sharply defined than those of their counterparts in ordinary language. In these definitions, the meanings of the logical constants are generally related to the concept of truth value. Starting from a binary concept of truth value, sentences like \"We are going to eat beef\" can be either true or false. A sentence constant \"A\" therefore has two possible truth values: \"true\" and \"false.\" Two or more sentence constants can be connected to each other with the help of logical constants such as v (\"or\") and � (\"if . . . then\"); a sentence constant can also be preceded by the logical constant --, (\"not\"). All these cases result in new, compound sentences whose truth value is determined by the truth values of their component sen­ tences and the meanings of the logical constants used in linking them. In order to examine their influence on the truth value of the sentence (or \"proposition\"), the meanings of logical constants of this type are, in proposi­ tional logic, usually laid down in \"truth tables.\" These truth tables show which truth values a compound sentence acquires on the basis of the possible truth values of its component sentences. The truth value of the compound sentence \"We are not going to eat beef,\" for instance, is false if the sentence \"We are going to eat beef\" is true, and true if the sentence \"We are going to eat beef\" is false. Translating expressions such as \"or\" and \"if . . . then\" into the language of propositional logic involves an abstraction from various aspects of the ordinary meaning of these words. In the definition of the logical constant � . for instance, all sorts of information is ignored that the use of the wording \"if . . . then\" normally provides. The meaning of the logical constant is confined to those aspects of \"if . . . then\" which are relevant to the possible truth values of sen­ tences composed with its help. As a consequence, the translation of \"if . . . then\" by � in sentences like \"If this man j umps from a tower, then he falls to his death\" inevitably leads to a reduction in meaning. u Though this may not be immediately apparent due to the abbreviation of the sentences by sentence constants, even after the fifth abstraction the arguments that are dealt with continue to be specific arguments about a specific topic. Because it is not the logicians' intention to deal with arguments by examining them all separately, a further abstraction step is taken, which is crucial to logical theory. In the sixth abstraction step, individual arguments are interpreted as in­ stances of argument forms. Specific arguments about a specific topic are then viewed as particular instances or instantiations of formal constellations of prem­ ises and a conclusion. In the notation of these argument forms, instead of the 1 1lt is, for instance, left out of the account that there is a causal relation between the fall and the death.\n\nFUNDAMENTALS OF ARGUMENTATION THEORY\n\n10\n\nletters A, B, C, etc. which stand for sentences, the variables p, q, r, etc. are used, for which declarative sentences of any kind may be substituted. Because they are not sentences, the variables do not have any truth value; they only become true or false if sentences are substituted for them. This means that individual arguments are treated as \"substitution instances\" (fillings) of certain abstract reasoning patterns. The two arguments from our example, for instance, can be seen as substitution instances of the following argument forms: argument fonn of argument 1\n\npuq\n\n--,r --,r -4 --,q\n\nj:.p\n\nargument fonn of argument 2\n\np-4q p j:.q\n\nsoon as these six steps of abstraction are taken, logicians can set out to fulfil their general aim of distinguishing between valid and invalid argument forms (and hence, indirectly, between valid and invalid arguments). An argument form is valid (in propositional logic) if none of its substitution instances is an argument with true premises and a false conclusion. All (and only) substitution instances of a valid argument form are valid arguments. 12 In order to test the validity of an argument, logicians determine whether the argument concerned is a substitution instance of a valid argument form. One method used in this endeavor amounts to a systematic search for a counterex­ ample, which will disprove the validity of the most specific argument form of which the argument is an instance. If a substitution instance of this form is found with true premises and a false conclusion, then not only the argument form but also the argument itself is invalid (in propositional logic)P On the other hand,\n\nAs\n\n12-J'hus if an argument is valid in propositional logic it is impossible that its conclusion be false whereas its premises are true. It is important to realize that this does not mean that the premises are required to be true. A valid argument may very well have false premises. Valid arguments that do have true premises are usually called \"sound,\" but generally the soundness of arguments is no concern of logicians. On the other hand, logicians study many other types of validity besides those relating to propositional logic. If an argument is not valid in propositional logic it may still be valid in some other (stronger) logic, such as predicate logic, see below. 1Yrhe validity question can also be approached in another way. To every valid argument there is a \"corresponding implication\": a true \"if . . . then\" sentence in which the premises-con­ nected by \"and\"-are placed after \"if\" and the conclusion after \"then.\" The corresponding implication itself is not an argument but a sentence, and may therefore be true or false. In a valid argument, the corresponding implication is necessarily true, and a valid argument form must have a corresponding implication form, all of whose substitution instances are true.\n\nI. INTRODUCTION\n\nII\n\nif no such substitution instance is found, and the search was truly systematic and complete, then both the form and the argument are valid. The arguments we have used as our examples are substitution instances of argument forms in which the logical constants..., (negation), v (disjunction), and � (material implication) are used. In propositional logic, where the validity of argument forms employing this type of logical constants is examined, it is demonstrated that they are valid. The valid argument form of argument 2 is called modus ponens. In order to examine the validity of argument forms employing other types of logical constants, logical theories that go beyond propositional logic are re­ quired. Arguments whose validity cannot be established in propositional logic may prove to be valid in other logics. One such logic is predicate logic, which deals with the use of \"quantifiers\" such as \"all\" and \"some\" in arguments. Amongst other logics that have so far been developed are modal logics, exam­ ining the logical behavior of words like \"necessary\" and \"possible,\" deontic logic, concentrating on logical constants such as \"obliged\" and \"permissible,\" epistemic logic, studying the logical behavior of words like \"know\" and \"believe,\" and tense logic, investigating the logical effect of temporal references. 14 This brief account of the various ways in which logicians abstract from argumentative reality in order to pursue their general aim of distinguishing between valid and invalid argument forms should suffice as an introduction to the kinds of problems argumentation theorists are interested in. It illustrates that logicians, rather than studying argumentation as it naturally occurs in everyday discourse, concentrate on abstract premises formally structured by logical constants. In this endeavor, a great many verbal, contextual, situational, and other pragmatic factors that play a part in the communication process are not taken into account, so that the problems of argumentative discourse cannot be adequately dealt with. As is illustrated in the next Section, the study of argumentation ought to contain more than logic currently has to offer. For the sake of clarity, it should be added that in drawing this conclusion we neither say that the study of argumentation can do without logic altogether nor that the present state of affairs will never change. 15 There are logicians of various types, one being more inclined than the other, to obey the call of argumentative practice. As we shall see, there has already been a tendency among logicians towards broadening their interests in the phenomena of argumentative dis­ course which have escaped their attention for too long. At the same time, various argumentation theorists attempt to include, in their theories, relevant aspects of logic, in some form or other. For the time being, in view of the many 14Unlike propositional and predicate logic, these logics are \"intensional\" logics, since they take into account the effect of nonextensional aspects of meaning. 15In itself, there can be few objections to look upon argumentation theory as a branch of logic. In recent times, however, logic has become far removed from argumentative practice and is now largely a matter for specialists with a mathematical or computational background.\n\n12\n\nFUNDAMENTALS OF ARGUMENTATION THEORY\n\ncomplexities involved in studying argumentative discourse, it seems best to aspire to a sensible division of labor, and to regard the study of argumentation as a discipline in its own right nourished by the combined efforts of philoso­ phers, logicians, linguists, (speech) communication specialists, psychologists, lawyers, and others.\n\n1 .3\n\nTH E STUDY OF ARG U M ENTATI O N\n\nHaving defined the subject matter o f the study of argumentation, w e can now delineate its general objective by distinguishing it from the general objective of (formal) logic. In order to do so, we shall first identify four problem areas in the study of argumentation that can be adequately dealt with only if pragmatic factors are duly taken into account. These problem areas are the following: \"unexpressed elements in argumentative discourse, \" \"argumentation struc­ tures,\" \"argumentation schemes,\" and \"fallacies.\" Argumentation theorists are, broadly speaking, interested in the problems involved in the production, analysis, and evaluation of argumentative discourse. In studying these problems, they view argumentative discourse in the light of the actual circumstances in which it takes place. In examining argumentative discourse, many argumentation theorists therefore start from a unifying per­ spective on reasoned discourse which is to provide a general framework for studying the interplay of pragmatic factors. When communicating with each other by means of reasoned discourse, peo­ ple observe, as a rule, certain standards that ensure that their communication can serve its purpose. These standards can be summarized in the Principle of Communication, stating that the participants in the communication process should refrain from making any moves which impede the communication pro­ ceedings. As long as there is no evidence to the contrary, the interlocutors may be assumed to comply with this principle. The Principle of Communication is implemented by the maintenance of four standards: clarity, honesty, efficiency, and relevance. 1 6 In practice it is not at all uncommon that one or more of these standards are violated, but this does not automatically mean that the Principle of Communi­ cation has been abandoned. In ordinary communication, apparent violations of the standards are often means of implicitly or indirectly conveying some extra information. People can utilize the standards in order to be ironic, to make suggestions they would not like to state explicitly, to avoid stressing the obvious, '&rhe Principle of Communication, introduced by van Eemeren and Grootendorst (1992a), has a similar role and epistemological status as Grice's (1 975) Co-operative Principle, from which it is partly derived. According to Kasher (1982), observing the standards inherent in the Gricean Co-operative Principle stems from the compliance with a general Rationalization Principle stimulating the use of effective means (p. 33).\n\n1. INTRODUCTION\n\n13\n\nand so on. Even if the standards are occasionally violated without any such intent, there is usually no great harm done. Argumentation theorists, who deal with argumentative discourse, attempt to gain sufficient i nsight into the textual and contextual pragmatic factors that play a part in this type of discourseP They must have reasons to support their interpretation of a given discourse in order to j ustify their analysis. The crucial questions they have to answer are: Under what circumstances do speakers i ncur a commitment to a statement they did not utter explicitly; and how can implicit and indirect meanings be inferred from the utterances that were literally made? To answer these questions, one must take into account the various general and specific presuppositions entertained by the interlocutors, which constitute the point of departure of the argumentation. In this endeavor, the four standards that implement the Principle of Communication can be useful tools. In ordinary discourse, no two utterances are ever wholly identical in meaning. A high standard of preciseness is usually only aspired to in certain types of emphatic or formal usage when a speaker wishes to exclude all possible misun­ derstanding. Explicitness is the exception rather than the rule. Sometimes the communicative function of an utterance becomes clear only after the event, when this function is identified or indicated by one of the participants (\"So, that is your standpoint then, eh?,\" \"You have heard my major arguments\"), but more often than not no explicit identification will be given, while, moreover, the propositional content of the utterance remains ambiguous.18 Fortunately, there are some verbal indicators that specifically refer to stand­ points and argumentation, such as \"therefore,\" \"hence,\" \"so,\" \"thus,\" \"ergo,\" and \"since,\" \"for\" and \"because.\" Some of them, for example \"for,\" are used retro­ gressively, referring to a preceding standpoint; others, like \"so,\" are used pro­ gressively, being followed by the standpoint, and some, like \"because,\" can be used in both ways. The fewer the number of verbal pointers, the more it will be necessary to make use of verbal and nonverbal contextual clues. Usually, some background knowledge of the context and the type of speech event involved, and even some knowledge of the world, will be required to detect these clues and put them to good use. Otherwise, it would, for instance, be hard to tell that in the argument, \"You should see that film; there is no cooler apology for crime,\" first a standpoint is formulated and then a reason in its support. Confusingly, formulations of standpoints and reasons may be presented in speech acts that are, at first sight, nonassertive, as in \"Let's take an umbrella, or 171n practice, the interlocutors themselves may differ in their interpretations of what the context of the discourse is. Such different interpretations can impede a meaningful exchange . In some cases, the analyst, considering the context from an external perspective, can shed some light on why and where the interpretations diverge. 181n many cases, the function and propositional content of certain utterances cannot be determined until the entire speech or text is scrupulously examined, even then the analyst sometimes has to resort to an educated guess.\n\n14\n\nFUNDAMENTALS OF ARGUMENTATION THEORY\n\ndo you want to get wet?\" Taken literally, what the speaker does is to confront the listener with a proposal, accompanied by a question. The (rhetorical) question, however, must be interpreted as a reason to accept the implicit standpoint that the two should take an umbrella. In order to correctly determine the speaker's commitments, one must diagnose this discourse as containing an implicit (and indirect) standpoint defended by an implicit (and indirect) reason: !'We should take an umbrella, for we do not want to get wet.\" In the analysis of such implicitness (and indirectness), and in the j ustification of this analysis, an important role is usually played by general standards for reasoned discourse and by the context (in its broadest sense) of the specific discourse under analysis. It is important to realize that standpoints and reasons are functional discourse units that are instrumental in an effort to resolve a difference of opinion. Verbal utterances per se are never standpoints or reasons; they are not standpoints or reasons by nature, but only when they fulfil a specific function in the discourse. They are standpoints or reasons when they serve to express a certain position in a (potential) difference of opinion or to defend a certain position in a context of (potential) controversy. In a dispute, for example, regarding where the Dutch monarch is inaugurated, the (false) statement \"The Hague is the dejure capital of The Netherlands\" may serve to construct an argument (\"Because The Hague is the de jure capital of The Netherlands, the Dutch monarch is inaugurated in The Hague\"), but the same statement can serve as a standpoint if the dispute is about which city is the capital of The Netherlands (\"The Dutch monarch is inaugurated in The Hague, therefore The Hague is the dejure capital of The Netherlands\"). The pivotal points of an argument are often constituted by unexpressed elements, which are only implicitly present in the discourse. This holds in particu­ lar for unexpressed premises and unexpressed standpoints.19 In the arguments composing ordinary argumentation usually one of the premises is left unex­ pressed. In some cases, the identification of the elements implicit in enthymematic argumentation is quite simple. It is obvious, for example, that in \"Amos is pig­ headed, because he is a teacher\" the premise that is left unexpressed is \"Teachers are pig-headed.\" In \"I am sure that Amos is pig-headed, since all teachers are pig-headed,\" it is just as clear that the unexpressed premise is: \"Amos is a teacher.\" There are also cases in which the identification of unexpressed premises may cause more problems-usually, because there are several possibilities. In order to determine what the commitments of an arguer are, the analyst must effect not only a logical analysis, based on the validity criterion, but also a pragmatic analysis, based on standards for reasoned discourse.20 In the logical analysis, 1'\\'irtual synonyms of these terms, used by various authors, are implicit, tacit, unstated, hidden and suppressed premises (or assumptions) and standpoints (or conclusions). 20A commitment to some validity criterion is required, but it is open to discussion which criterion is to be preferred. No dogmatic commitment to deductivism is thus implied. Cf. Govier (1987, pp. 81-104). The identification of other unexpressed elements in argumentative discourse than unexpressed premises and unexpressed standpoints is often more complicated s ince no heuristic tool such as the logical validity criterion is available.\n\n1. INTRODUCTION\n\nIS\n\nan attempt is made to reconstruct the argument as one having a valid argument form; in the pragmatic analysis, the unexpressed premise that helps to make the argument logically valid is then more precisely defined on the basis of contextual information and background knowledge. The logical analysis is thus instrumental to the achievement of a satisfactory pragmatic analysis.21 We illustrate this analytic procedure by an example citing a Dutch politician's retort, at a public meeting, to a colleague, who has j ust rejected a proposal to legalize abortion:22 You are right to set such store by the sanctity of human life, but you cannot include a 6-week foetus. Speaking as a Liberal, I am amazed by your standpoint. What about the sanctity of the life of the mother who has become pregnant against her will and is unable to give the child the life it has a right to?\n\nAlthough the politician does not explicitly state his standpoint, we may take it that he defends the standpoint that abortion should be legalized, since his argumentation reacts to the other politician's standpoint that abortion should not be legalized, whereas his own reasons seem to indicate the opposite. His second reason is presented by way of a rhetorical question. The premise in­ volved can be reconstructed as \"A woman who has become pregnant against her will and is unable to provide for her child should have the right to end her pregnancy.\" How is this premise connected to the standpoint that abortion should be legalized? Which unexpressed premise is understood to fill the gap between this premise and the standpoint? First, in a logical analysis the incomplete argument can be made valid by adding the following premise to the argument: \"If a woman who has become pregnant against her will and who is unable to provide for her child should have the right to end her pregnancy, then abortion should be legalized.\" Since this addition is not really informative, the analyst then has to investigate whether the unexpressed premise can be made more informative, making use of the pragmatic data available in the context concerned. Without ascribing any un­ warranted commitments to the speaker, the unexpressed premise can, in view of the politician's avowed liberal stance expressed in the preceding sentence, be generalized by relying on the common background knowledge that the Dutch Liberals are staunch legalists. This would lead to the following unexpressed premise: \"A right can only be exercised if it is legalized.\" 21Taken literally, an argument in which a premise has been left unexpressed is invalid. The premise that is logically required to correct the invalidity may be futile, thus going against the standards for reasoned discourse. If there is no reason to assume that the speaker flouts the Principle of Communication, the analyst should investigate whether there is any pragmatic information available which enables a completion of the argument by a premise which no longer violates this Principle. 2�he procedure described here is basically that of pragma-dialectics, considered in chap. 10, but it captures problems that are encountered also in other approaches.\n\nFUNDAMENTALS OF ARGUMENTATION THEORY\n\n16\n\nIn the absence of disambiguating contextual information or background knowledge, the pragmatic identification of unexpressed premises will be hard to accomplish. A logical analysis must then suffice. Otherwise there is a danger that the added premise oversteps the mark, attributing more to the speaker than he or she is actually committed to. With unexpressed standpoints we are on safer ground. Starting from the explicit premises, a logical analysis of the underlying argument usually leads to an unequivocal determination of the con­ clusion representing the unexpressed standpoint that is being advocated. The following example may serve as an illustration: Arnold:\n\nWell, she is in love with a student. And affairs between teachers and their pupils always end in trouble . . . .\n\nThe conclusion which has been omitted here is: \"She will end up in trouble.\" Arnold, who says that she is in love with a student and that affairs between teachers and students always end in trouble, certainly suggests that conclusion, even though he might subsequently maintain that he had not said as much. Strictly speaking, it could be maintained that Arnold himself is not arguing. Rather he initiates a particular reasoning process in the listener. Although in such cases it is arguable whether or not a standpoint is actually being justified or refuted by means of arguments, it is beyond dispute which conclusion figures as the bone of contention. Argumentation for or against a standpoint can be simple, but it may also display a more complex argumentation structure, depending on how the arguer organizes the defense of the standpoint in view of (manifest or anticipated) doubts and criticisms. The simplest case is that of a single argumentation, con­ sisting of just one argument pro or contra the standpoint. Because complex argumentation can always be analyzed as a combination of single argumenta­ tions, single argumentation is considered to display the basic structure of argu­ mentation. In a typical single argumentation the argument contains, as a rule, one explicit and one unexpressed premise: You are a chauvinist, because you are a man.\n\nIn this argument, the unexpressed premise is \"Men are chauvinists.\" True, it has been omitted, but that does not mean that it has no part to play; it is a necessary element of the argument, since only if this premise is included does the argument form a complete whole. Although the argumentation structure is not affected by the unexpressed premise, even if it would have been expressed, this unex­ pressed premise is a constitutive part of the argumentation. Complexly structured argumentation consists of more than one single argu­ mentation. In such argumentation, several arguments are advanced pro or con­ tra the same standpoint. These arguments can be unconnected, but they may\n\n17\n\n1.

In the first case, the argumentation consists of alterna­ tive defenses of the same standpoint and can be structurally characterized as multiple argumentation. Here is an example: Postal deliveries in Holland are not perfect. You cannot be sure that a letter will be delivered the next day, that it will be delivered to the right address, or that it wil l be delivered early in the morning.\n\nMultiple argumentation is structurally represented in Fig. 1 . 1 . In the second case we mentioned, a compound argumentation is created consisting of a chain of arguments that reinforce each other. If the single argu­ ments constituting the chain are \"connected in parallel,\" the arguments being part of a combined attempt to defend the standpoint, the argumentation can be structurally characterized as coordinatively compound argumentation. Here is an example: This book has literary qualities: the plot is original, the story is well-told, the dia­ logues are incredibly natural, and the style is superb.\n\nCoordinatively compound argumentation is structurally represented in Fig. 1 .2. If the arguments in the chain are \"connected in series,\" the one supporting the other, the argumentation structure is that of subordinatively compound argu­ mentation.23 Whereas in coordinatively compound argumentation all the argu23Some authors use other terms for characterizing the various argumentation structures, representing similar but not always the same distinctions. Among these terms are convergent (for independent or multiple), linked (for interdependent or coordinatively compound), and serial (for subordinatively compound).\n\nFUNDAMENTALS OF ARGUMENTATION THEORY\n\n18\n\n1 s\n\nr\n\nr\n\nA l . lb R2\n\n\" l . ln Rn\n\nFIG. 1 .2.

Here is an example: I don't have to invite Carla to my party. She cannot be trusted. Last week she ran off with my friend.\n\nSubordinatively compound argumentation is structurally represented in Fig. 1 .3. A major problem when analyzing complex argumentation is that it is often unclear whether one is dealing with multiple, coordinatively compound or sub­ ordinatively compound argumentation. Explicit indications of the argumentation structure in the discourse are generally thin on the ground. As a rule, the analyst will have little more to fall back on than the connectives and other clarifying expressions that are used in the text.24 Another complication is that various types of argumentation structure may occur together in the discourse, multiple argumentation, for instance, being combined with coordinatively compound argumentation in a subordinatively compound argumentation. A warrantable analysis can usually be achieved only if, among other pragmatic factors, the distinctive features of the type of speech event or text one is dealing with are duly taken into account. An analysis of the argumentation structure, as it describes the \"external organization\" of the various arguments, yields insight into the composition of the argumentation as a whole. Argumentation theorists, however, are also interested 24Certain words and expressions can be (but need not be) indicators of the argumentation structure. Among them are: for multiple argumentation, \"by the way,\" \"moreover,\" \"inciden­ tally,\" \"quite apart from,\" \"and then I haven't even mentioned the fact that,\" and \"needless to add that\"; for coordinatively compound argumentation, \"these two things combined lead to the conclusion that,\" \"when it is also remembered that,\" \"in addition to the fact,\" and \"as well as the fact that\"; for subordinative argumentation, \"since because,\" and \"because because.\"\n\n1 .

Structure of subordinatively compound argumentation.\n\nin the \"internal organization\" of the individual single arguments, that is, the principles on which these arguments rely in defending the standpoint at issue by means of the premises. These principles are called argumentation schemes. Argumentation schemes relate to the kind of relation established in a single argument between its premises and the standpoint the argument aims to justify or refute. An argumentation scheme characterizes the type of justification or refutation provided for the standpoint.25 An analysis of the argumentation schemes used in a discourse should produce information as to the principles, standards, criteria, or assumptions involved in a particular attempt at justification or refutation. It should not be taken for granted that anyone who puts forward an argument is automatically involved in an attempt to logically derive the conclusion from the premises. Yet, in some way or other, a transfer of acceptance from the explicit premise to the standpoint must be aimed at. On this point, so far, formal logic has not much to offer. Modern logicians seem almost unanimous in their concern with formal validity rather than substantive relations between premises and conclusions, concentrating on implications and truth rather than plausible inferences and the transmission of acceptance.26 25Just as logical argument forms, such as modus fXJnens, argumentation schemes are abstract frameworks which can have an infinite number of substitution instances. All substitution instances can, of course, be logically analyzed as involving an argument form of the modus ponens type, but this argument form does not reveal the distinctive features of the various argumentation schemes. 2SSome promising developments, however, have taken place. See Harman (1 986), Cohen (1992) and others on acceptance and belief, Rescher (1976) and others on plausible reasoning, and the recent literature on default logic. -\n\n20\n\nFUNDAMENTALS OF ARGUMENTATION THEORY\n\nThe speaker aims to effect a transfer of acceptance from the premises to the standpoint that makes the listener accept the standpoint. Hence, the speaker attempts to design the argument in such a fashion that it will convince the listener. Take the following argument: Dan iel/e: Daniel is sure to be concerned about the costs, as he is an American.\n\nWhen looking for an argument to defend her standpoint that Daniel will be concerned about the costs, Danielle may, for example, have entertained an unfriendly thought like \"It is typical of Americans that they are materialistic.\" From this thought, she may have backed up her standpoint by the argument shown above, the unexpressed premise being \"Americans are inclined to care a lot about money.\" In another case, we might speculate that Danielle, from a thought such as \"We are now faced with the same problem as last year,\" came up with the following argument \"The method I propose worked last year, it will therefore work again,\" the unexpressed premise being \"This problem is similar to the one we had last year.\" And starti ng from a thought such as \"Heavy drinking is bound to cause a hangover,\" she might have argued \"Tom must have a terrible headache, because he has been drinking an excessive amount of whiskey,\" the unexpressed premise being \"Drinking too much whiskey leads to a terrible headache.\"27 By arguing in either of these ways, Danielle is relying on more or less ready­ made argumentation schemes: conventionalized ways of displaying a relation between that which is stated in the explicit premise and that which is stated in the standpoint. The internal organization of each single argument can be char­ acterized by the argumentation scheme being employed. One of the problems argumentation theorists are confronted with is to describe these argumentation schemes, to determine how they operate, and to assess their acceptability. Most often, it is not clearly indicated in the discourse which type of justifi­ cation or refutation is used. Generally, some interpretation on the part of the analyst is required to identify the argumentation scheme. In the absence of clear markers, speakers sometimes employ certain more or less standardized expres­ sions to indicate a particular argumentation scheme.28 If the argumentation scheme is not, in some way or other, indicated by the speaker, the analyst has\n\n27These examples are taken from van Eemeren and Grootendorst (1 992a, pp. 94- 102). According to these authors, the argumentation scheme employed is in the first example of the \"token\" type (indicating a symptomatic relation), in the second example of the \"similarity\" type (indicating a comparison relation), and in the third example of the \"consequence\" type (indicating an instrumental relation). 28Among these markers are such expressions as \"X is characteristic of Y,\" \"X is typical of Y,\" and \"X's are essentially Y,\" for the token type; \"X is comparable to Y,\" \"X corresponds to Y,\" and \"X is just like Y,\" for the similarity type; and \"X leads to Y,\" \"X is a means of getting Y,\" and \"Y results from X,\" for the consequence type.\n\n1 . INTRODUCTION\n\n21\n\nto detect the implicit topos relied on in the argument. For this purpose, the unexpressed premise bridging the gap between the explicit premise and the standpoint must first be identified. This means, again, that the analyst must exploit the pragmatic information contained in the context of discourse.29 A final problem area argumentation theorists are interested in, which should be briefly mentioned, concerns the fallacies. According to the standard defini­ tion, a fallacy is an argument that seems valid but is not.30 Well-known objections to this definition point out that a great number of the generally recognized fallacies are not arguments and that others are not invalid arguments. Therefore, these fallacies are not covered by the definition. One explanation why fallacy theorists stuck with this definition, although many fallacies are outside its scope, is that until recently most approaches to the fallacies have been logico-centric in a very restricted way. However, if the old definition is dropped, and fallacies are conceived as discussion moves which damage the quality of argumentative discourse, it is easier to bring to the light what is fallacious about them. For this purpose, a pragmatic approach is re­ quired which makes allowances for the communicative and interactional context in which the fallacies occur. If pragmatic knowledge is not taken into account, many of the fallacies cannot be satisfactorily analyzed. In this endeavor, a set of norms must be developed for distinguishing be­ tween acceptable and unacceptable moves in argumentative discourse. The criteria used in deciding whether such a norm has been violated, should also be investigated. For determining in specific cases if these criteria are satisfied, procedural tools are to be designed, involving the use of various kinds of contextual information. As a preliminary to this last enterprise, it must be established if the situation in which a would-be fallacy occurs is indeed within the scope of the norms. Argumentation theorists are concerned with the problem areas we have just outlined, not only for analytic purposes, but also because the analysis can be instrumental in accomplishing an adequate evaluation of argumentative dis­ course and may serve as a basis for improving its production. In order to be acceptable for a rational j udge, the point of departure of the argumentation as well as its presentational layout should comply with certain soundness criteria. These soundness criteria are validity criteria in a pragmatic sense, relating to all elements that are part of the argumentative discourse, from the premises, whether explicit or implicit, and other constituents of the point of departure of\n\n29Conversely, in cases where the argumentation scheme is clearly indicated, this scheme is part of the context and can be instrumental in identifying the unexpressed premise. A crucial concept in argumentation theorists' analysis of the pragmatic information available in the context of discourse, is relevance, which pertains to the appropriateness of the connections between separate utterances. :IDsee Hamblin (1970, p. 12).\n\n22\n\nFUNDAMENTALS OF ARGUMENTATION THEORY\n\nargumentation, to the argumentation structures and the argumentation schemes employed in its presentational layout. The point of departure of argumentation comprises everything stated as such or implicitly assumed by the speaker or writer. Normally, this starting point will be only partly explicit, the other part being tacitly presupposed in the discourse and in its contextual environment. These presuppositions, pertaining, inter alia, to the facts, ideas, values, and standards which play a part in the discourse, are immanent parts of the point of departure. Their propositional content is to be judged for accuracy and relevance, as well as the plausibility and level of endorsement of their functional status as facts, suppositions, or preferences. The presentational layout of argumentation comprises every move in the argumentative discourse which is instrumental to the justificati on or refutation of a standpoint. Normally, the structure of the argumentation and the argumen­ tation schemes employed in individual arguments will be indicated only to some extent. Hence, the analyst can make them explicit only by taking account of the contextual clues provided by the way in which the discourse proceeds in its contextual environment. The argumentation structures are to be judged for appropriateness and adequacy, while the argumentation schemes must be judged for suitability and correctness of application. The soundness criteria of a rational j udge are not necessarily identical with those employed by an arbitrary audience. However much the audience may agree with the point of departure and the presentational layout of the argumen­ tation, it may nevertheless fail to meet the requirements applied in a reasonable evaluation. A rational j udge will find the argumentation pragmatically valid only if the evaluation of its point of departure and its presentational layout is in both cases positive, so that the argumentation as a whole may be considered sound.31 It is the first responsibility of argumentation theorists to specify the validity criteria to be applied by a rational j udge in carrying out a reasonable evaluation of argumentation with regard to both its point of departure and its presenta­ tional layout. The general obj ective of the study of argumentation can therefore be summarized in the following way: The general objective of the study of argumentation is to develop criteria for de­ termining the validity of argumentation in view of its points of departure and pre­ sentational layout and to implement the application of these criteria in the produc­ tion, analysis and evaluation of argumentative discourse.\n\nArgumentation theorists differ in the meanings they assign to the term valid. For the most part, these differences relate to the various conceptions of ration3 1ln this endeavor, the term valid (and the term sound) acquires a pragmatic meaning which accords with the interests of argumentation theorists. In formal logic, of course, the term valid has a much stricter meaning. As will be clear from ordinary usage, however, formal logicians have neither been granted a patent for this term nor do they hold the monopoly of its use.\n\n1. INTRODUCTION\n\n23\n\nality or reasonableness taken as starting point in their study of argumentation and to the specific goals aimed for in these studies. In a sense, these studies can all be seen as particular views on what we are to understand by valid argumentation. By these lights, every theoretical contribution to the study of argumentation provides us with a definition of (particular aspects of) pragmatic validity, depending on a specific, usually implicit, conception of rationality. In order to provide some insight into the nature of the rationality conceptions underlying the various contributions to the study of argumentation, we offer a brief outline of three main conceptions of rationality distinguished by the phi­ losopher Stephen Toulmin (1976) in Knowing and Acting. These distinctions may be used as a background for the discussion of several contributions in the present study. Toulmin differentiates between the philosophical answers given to the ques­ tion \"What is it to have reasons for our beliefs or actions?\" (1 976, pp. vi-vii). He distinguishes a \"formal\" or \"logical\" tradition, originating in Plato, an \"empirical\" tradition, familiar from the eighteenth century and derived from \"common sense,\" and a \"critical\" or \"transcendental\" tradition, starting with Kant. These traditions find, according to Toulmin, expression in three different approaches to rationality: a geometrical, an anthropological, and a critical approach. Each of them induces a particular approach to argumentation. The geometrical approach relies heavily on formal logic. Arguments are regarded rationally acceptable only if they start from true or certain premises that necessarily lead to true or certain conclusions. This amounts to saying that the points of departure of valid argumentation must be indisputable and the arguments must be laid out in a formally valid way. The anthropological ap­ proach takes the rationality conception of a specific community as its starting point and bases its judgments on empirical evidence. Argumentation will then be regarded as valid if its point of departure and presentational layout agree with the standards of reasoning consented by the community concerned. The critical approach equates rationality with the functionality of the argumentative procedures used for achieving the aim for which they are designed, leaving aside specific logical or empirical assumptions. A rational j udge taking this approach will find argumentation acceptable only if its point of departure and its presentational layout are suitable means for achieving a well-defined aim. In practice, of course, various elements from different approaches can be com­ bined in a single conception of rationality. A rational judge represents an authority to which the evaluation of argumen­ tation is entrusted. It is debatable whether this authority should consist of an existent person or group of people or should remain an abstract ideal. If the first is preferred, it is assumed that the assessors are people capable of setting aside their own prej udices etc. If the second is preferred, it is assumed that a normative construct can be theoretically devised that is fully adapted to the task of making optimum judgments. Different argumentation theorists have dif-\n\n24\n\nFUNDAMENTALS OF ARGUMENTATION THEORY\n\nferent preferences in the matter. For our present purposes, it is most important to realize that a rational j udge can take various shapes. The various contributions to the study of argumentation differ not only in being founded on different rationality conceptions. They also differ because their specific aims are different; some are entirely descriptive, others have an orientation that is primarily normative. Descriptive approaches to argumentation aim at a description of those points of departure and presentational layouts that are regarded valid in practice. Normative approaches to argumentation aim at a determination of those points of departure and presentational layouts that are to be regarded valid from an external perspective. The crucial difference between descriptive and normative approaches to argumentation is that the first type of approach is more empirically based, whereas approaches of the second type have an analytic basis. In practice, approaches of the two types are also often combined, or considered as comple­ mentary. If the theorists aims are diagnostic as well as therapeutic, some com­ bination of the two seems to be a prerequisite, for one can only properly embark upon improving the production, analysis, and evaluation of argumentative dis­ course if one has first made clear what practice one desires to bring about, and how this accords with actual practice. The study of argumentation has so far not resulted in a universally accepted theory. The state of the art can therefore not be explained by describing one leading theory. It is characterized by the coexistence of a variety of approaches, differing considerably in conceptual breadth, scope of horizon, and degree of theoretical refinement.32 A fair picture can be given only by a survey of the various contributions, with an emphasis on the most influential and most elabo­ rated. As a consequence, apart from the general proclamation provided in this introduction, a broad perspective in which they are all put in their proper place can hardly be given. Before discussing contemporary developments which gave shape to the field as it currently is, we pay some attention to its historical background. We begin in chapter 2 with classical analytic, dialectic and rhetoric, which are still highly relevant to present-day argumentation theory. After a brief introduction to Aris­ totle's logic of the syllogism, we shall deal with the dialectical art of critical debate, the rhetorical art of civic discourse, and Roman-Hellenistic rhetoric. In chapter 3, we first discuss the Aristotelian heritage in the study of fallacies and the Standard Treatment of fallacies, so that, in spite of the enormous and unavoidable gap, at least some bridge is built between classical antiquity and modern history. We then move to Crawshay-Williams's analysis of controversy and Naess's insights concerning the clarification of discussions. Thus we hope 32For an illustration of the variety, see, for example, van Eemeren, Grootendorst, Blair, and Willard (1992).\n\n1. INTRODUCTION\n\n25\n\nto provide information concerning some substantial contributions to the study of argumentation which, in our opinion, have been unj ustly neglected. In chapter 4, we give a treatment of the New Rhetoric developed by Perelman and Olbrechts-Tyteca. We sketch their rhetorical framework and explain their specific perspective regarding the points of departure of argumentation and about argumentation schemes. In chapter 5, we explain Toulmin's model for argumentation analysis, paying attention to Toulmin's ideas concerning field-in­ variance and field-dependency and the relation between the form of argumen­ tation and validity. We also mention some applications of his model. These authors have set the stage for the developments in the study of argumentation that have taken place in the last two decades. Some of these contemporary developments took place in North America, some in Europe and the rest of the world. We start with three chapters dealing with North American developments, followed by three chapters about developments in Europe. In chapter 6, our survey of the present state of affairs in argumentation theory starts with an expositi on of the (re)emergence of Informal Logic, naming its main issues. Then we go on to the educational reform movement called Critical Thinking. In chapter 7, we discuss Communication and Rhetoric as practiced in American (speech) communication departments. We trace the development from debating contests to argumentation studies and give an impression of the social science perspectives on communication and the various contributions to the study of argumentation stemming from an interest in practical philosophy and social and cultural critique. In chapter 8, the formal treatment of the fallacies is at issue, starting with Aristotle and formal logic. Next the use of formal methods in the study of fallacies is discussed, as exemplified in the Woods-Walton approach. In chapter 9, the discussion of formal approaches to argumentation is continued. Barth's interesting conception of logical validity is explained, as well as the Logical Propaedeuti c of the Erlangen School, their dialogue logic, and Barth and Krabbe's Formal Dialectics. Chapter 10 is devoted to Pragma-Dialectics, expounding van Eemeren and Grootendorst's model for critical discussion, their method for reconstructing argumentative discourse, and their conception of the fallacies as moves which are obstacles to the resolution of disagreements. Some other, language-oriented, approaches to argumentation are discussed in chapter 1 1 . First Anscombre and Ducrot's Radical Argumentativism and their ideas concerning polyphony in argumentative discourse, then the Natural Logic described by Grize and his collaborators and Lo Cascio's argumentative grammar. Finally, in chapter 12, other more or less recent developments are mentioned that have taken place in the non-English speaking world. Among them are several philosophical and theoretical contributions to the study of argumentation, in­ spired by the Erlangen School and by Habermas and originating mainly in\n\n26\n\nFUNDAMENTALS OF ARGUMENTATION THEORY\n\nGermany, some stylistic and rhetorical studies from Italy and other European countries, particularly on the rhetoric of science, and a number of diverse contributions from scholars active in various countries. Since our study is meant to serve as an introduction to argumentation theory, we have supplemented our extensive list of references with a classified bibliography which may assist those readers who wish to acquaint themselves more thoroughly with a particular subj ect.\n\nP A R T\n\nI H I STO RICAL BAC KG RO U N DS\n\nThis page intentionally left blank\n\nCHAPTER\n\n2 ANALYTIC, D IALECTIC, AND R H ETORIC\n\nBecause the sources for modern theoretical thinking o n argumentation lie in Greek antiquity, it stands to reason that we begin our survey of the historical backgrounds of argumentation theory with a brief reconnaissance of classical logic, dialectic, and rhetoric. These new disciplines evolved in the 6th and 5th centuries B.C. Then the mythological picture of the world began to change, and attempts were made to account for natural phenomena and the genesis of the world in a rational manner, without appealing to the gallery of the gods. Before that, the cultural climate in Greek society had been rigid and dogmatic: kosmos (nature) and the social order of the polis (city-state) were seen as an immutable system ordained by the gods as a reflection of the divine order. For open discussion and argumentation there was no place: \"The gods have wished it so.\" Postulating any other explanation for the world and its creation meant setting oneself against the gods. When this picture of the world was challenged in the 6th and 5th centuries B.C., other explanations were offered. The existence of everything was, for example, explained by \"primordial\" principles or laws, such as \"the limitless,\" \"the air,\" \"the atoms,\" or \"everlasting numerical relations between the compo­ nents of the world.\" These explanations and metaphysical speculations on \"everything that exists,\" or the nature or structure of \"the world,\" differed from, even conflicted with each other. Thus Heraclitus believed that everything was always in constant motion, while Parmenides opined that motion and change were impossible. At a somewhat later period (chiefly in the 5th century B.C.) questions of direct social significance came to be discussed. Some people believed the social order to be inherent in human nature, while others thought it was the result of\n\n29\n\n30\n\nFUNDAMENTALS OF ARGUMENTATION THEORY\n\nagreements, laws, and conventions. Another problem was the question of whether all members of the community should be treated as political equals or whether the cleverest and strongest must simply ensure that power remained in their hands. All these, and other, opinions regarding the origin of the world and the political order laid claim to truth and acknowledgment by others. The ensuing differences of opinion led to questions like \"What actually is a 'good' opinion?\" and \"When can we say that something is true?\" Defending a particular opinion now required giving arguments for it, but how was one to determine which argumentation was the best? Is there such a thing as good argumentation? The Greek Sophists were the first to ask these sorts of question. They were itinerant scholars who taught lessons in argumentation and social and political skills. Though also interested in natural philosophy, they were chiefly concerned with ethics, political theory, morality, and theoretical reflection on the episte­ mology of these subjects. Some Sophists had rather radical views. Gorgias, for example, was of the opinion that (a) nothing really existed, (b) if anything really did exist it would be \"unknowable,\" and (c) if anything was \"knowable\" it would be uncommunicable to others. According to this view, everything we see about us is only an illusion. Another well-known point of view was that moral values are relative and subjective. According to this view, in the event of a dispute concerning moral questions one cannot appeal to objective criteria; the most one can do is ensure that one's own opinion is accepted. Directly related to this view is the Sophist standpoint that, obj ectively speak­ ing, there can be no such thing as good argumentation. If one person convinces another with his arguments, this is because the other person accepts what he says. 'rhe first person is, in other words, agreed to be right, but that does not necessarily mean that in objective terms he actually is right. The Sophists were excellent orators, and their orations were followed with interest and pleasure. They also organized public debating contests, and would debate for a fee. They had a reputation for being able to argue for any arbitrarily chosen standpoint. One of the earliest examples of their skill at devising argu­ ments is the following advice to someone accused of murder. If he is small in stature, he must argue in his defense that it is unlikely that so weak a person committed the crime. If he is of sturdy build, he can argue that it is improbable that so substantial a person did the deed, since he would be suspected straight­ away (Guthrie 1 97 1 , p. 1 78). Because good and convincing oratory was seen as a means towards achieving success in public life, there was widespread interest in the teaching of the Sophists. The democratic system as it existed in Athens for the major part of the 5th century required that an advocate of a particular political measure defended it at public meetings.1 On such occasions it was naturally more than 10n the working of this democratic system, see Sabine (1966, pp. 3-2 1).\n\n2. ANALYTIC, DIALECTIC, AND RHETORIC\n\n31\n\nhelpful to be able to put an argument well. When involved in a legal dispute, too, it was advantageous to be able to defend oneself before a j udge. Two main factors have thus promoted an interest in studying argumentation. First, comparison of the arguments for opposing views on all sorts of subject led to the general query of what is good argumentation. Second, the practice of politics and the law led to the question of what is good, and above all effective, argumentation. This general reflection on argumentation took shape in classical logic, dialectic, and rhetoric. The theories of classical logic, dialectic, and rhetoric were at their most influential in the finely worked out form given them by Aristotle.2 Aristotle's logical theory is found first and foremost in the Prior Analytics and Posterior Analytics. What we now call \"logic\" was referred to by Aristotle as \"analytic.\" In antiquity, it was often called \"dialectic.\" In the way in which Aristotle uses the word \"dialectic,\" however, it is the theory or art of debate. His dialectic is to be found in the Topics and in the Sophistical Refutations. The theory of good and convincing oratory, finally, Aristotle discusses in his Rhetoric. Aristotle starts from the assumption that all knowledge, insights, and opin­ ions, in so far as they arise from rational thought, are based on existing knowl­ edge, insights and opinions (Posterior Analytics 71a, 1-10). Existing opinions make up the material on the basis of which we can arrive at new opinions with the help of reasoning or arguments (Prior Analytics 68b, 14). Aristotle divides the arguments which may be used for this purpose into two sorts: deductive syllo­ gisms and inductive syllogisms.3 In the case of deductive syllogisms, something is asserted or assumed in a number of statements, and from these statements, the premises, there neces­ sarily follows a conclusion. (\"Necessarily\" means that the conclusion must follow from the premises.) In this sort of argument the relation between the premises and the conclusion is such that it is impossible for the premises to be true and the conclusion false. Nowadays, arguments that have this quality are called \"deductively valid.\" Let us give an example of our own. Suppose there are two premises: \"All cities have a city council\" and \"Paris is a city.\" From these two premises necessarily follows the conclusion \"Paris has a city council.\" Of course, at a particular moment\n\n2Aristotle wrote on logic, natural philosophy, biology, metaphysics, political theory, and other subjects. His logical writings were called the Organon (\"organon\" means \"tool\"): Logic was to be a tool in the service of the sciences and other areas of knowledge. From the Organon, we draw on the Prior Analytics, Posterior Analytics, the Topics, and the Sophistical Refutations. Aristotle 's (Nicomachean and Eudemian) Ethics and Rhetoric are not part of the Organon, but Aristotle defines rhetoric as the counterpart of dialectic (Rhetoric 1354 a1). 3Arlstotle argues (in Prior Analytics 68b, 15) that all forms of reasoning can be brought back to the syllogism. In practice, he distinguishes between deduction and induction. In some places, he contrasts (valid) deductive syllogisms and straightforward induction (Topics 105a, 1 4), and he also refers to inductive syllogisms (Prior Analytics 68b, 15). We follow him in the latter.\n\n32\n\nFUNDAMENTALS O F ARGUMENTATION THEORY\n\na city may not have a city council (the council may j ust have resigned, for example), but even then the conclusion still follows necessarily from the premises, because if the premises were true, then the conclusion would be true also. In the second sort of argument, inductive syllogisms, specific cases are named in the premises, and from these premises a general conclusion is drawn.4 One of Aristotle's examples is: \"The trained helmsman is the best; the trained charioteer is the best; therefore a trained man is generally the best in his field.\"5 Aristotle distinguishes arguments also according to the purpose they are intended to serve. Arguments designed to achieve absolutely certain and reli­ able knowledge, he calls apodictic or demonstrative; arguments calculated to lead to generally acceptable opinions, or points of view, are dialectical; and arguments that are primarily intended to convince a particular audience of the correctness of a standpoint, are called rhetorical arguments. For a demonstrative argument it is possible to use either a deductive or an inductive syllogism. The certainty of the premises is passed on to the conclusion by the argument. In a sound deductive demonstration the premises are incon­ trovertibly true, and so is the conclusion. Such arguments therefore serve as an apodictic ideal of knowledge, particularly of mathematical knowledge.6 For dialectical arguments, too, it is possible to use either deductive or induc­ tive syllogisms. The premises of a dialectical argument are generally accepted, or they are acceptable to \"the wise,\" that is, \"to all of the wise or to the majority or to the most famous and distinguished of them\" (Topics IOOb, 23). Because the premises are only \"generally accepted,\" the conclusions too are only \"generally accepted.\" Again, the degree of certainty-in this case, acceptability or prob­ ability-is transmitted from the premises to the conclusion. The premises of a rhetorical argument must be chosen so that they have cogency for the audience. By the use of a deductive or inductive syllogism, the conclusion is then also cogent in the eyes of the audience. The audience must accept the step from the premises to the conclusion; whether the reasoning is valid by demonstrative or dialectical criteria, is not important. To persuade the audience, then, two conditions must be met: both the premises and the inference must have cogency. Aristotle mentions an interesting example of an argument that is apodictically invalid, but can function well rhetorically: \"Someone who is committing adultery\n\n4Nowadays, inductive arguments are generally understood as arguments in which the premises are calculated to make the conclusion plausible while it is, strictly speaking, possible for the premises to be true and the conclusion false. Aristotle's inductive arguments are covered by this definition, but other arguments, such as reasoning by analogy, are encompassed as well. 5See Aristotle's Topics 1 05a, 13- 1 6, where he also defines induction. 6ln antiquity, mathematics was regarded as representing empirical knowledge. For example, it was considered obvious that parallel lines do not meet, since this can simply be \"seen\" to be so.\n\n2.

Apodictic arguments are treated in Aristotle's logical theory, the Analytics; dialectical arguments in the Topics and the Sophistical Refutations; and rhetorical arguments in Rhetoric. Before briefly discussing these three theories, we sum­ marize the three sorts of argument and their characteristic features in Fig. 2. 1 .\n\n2. 1\n\nT H E ANALYTICAL LOG I C OF THE SYLLOG ISM\n\nIn his logical theory Aristotle concerns himself chiefly with deductive syllo­ gisms. 7 His definition of a syllogism is so broad that it covers any argument in which a conclusion necessarily follows from two or more premises (Topics 100a, 18-25, Prior Analytics 24b, 20). Aristotle only deals with the type now known as a \"categorical syllogism,\" which must meet more stringent requirements than the general definition suggests. Here is an example: (1) All humans are mortal. (2) All Greeks are humans. (3) All Greeks are mortal (conclusion). A syllogism consists of two premises (1 and 2) and a conclusion (3). The premises and the conclusion are all categorical statements, that is, they relate to categories of entities. In practice, it is also possible to have an argument with more premises or with only one premise, or with premises and conclusions that are not cate7Further extensions of Aristotle's logic, which Is now termed traditional logic, have a long history.\n\nFUNDAMENTALS O F ARGUMENTATION THEORY\n\n34\n\ngorical statements. Just as Aristotle, however, we shall concentrate on syllogisms of the earlier described type. In a categorical statement a predicate (P) is attributed to a subj ect (S) by means of the word \"is\" or \"are\" (kategorein means \"to predicate\"). In ( 1), for example, it is said of \"humans\" (the subject) that they are \"mortal\" (the predi­ cate). The term which functions as the subject of a statement is known as the subject term (in 1 \"humans,'' in 2 and 3 \"Greeks\"), the term functioning as the predicate being called the predicate term (in 1 \"mortal,\" in 2 \"humans,\" and in 3 \"mortal\"). In (1), the predicate \"mortal\" is attributed to the subject \"humans,\" that is, all humans. The predicate, however, may also have been withheld from the subject, or might not be allocated to all humans, but only to some. In this way, a total of four variants can be distinguished, all of which Aristotle regards as categorical statements. The four variants are: ( la) All humans are mortal. (lb) Some humans are mortal. ( lc) No humans are mortal. (ld) Some humans are not mortal. In (la) and (lb) the predicate \"mortal\" is attributed to the subject \"humans,\" while in (lc) and (ld), by contrast, it is withheld from the subject. The statements (la) and (lb) are therefore called affirmative, (lc) and (ld) negative. In (la) and ( lc) the predicate is attributed to all humans and in ( lb) and (ld) to some humans. All-statements are called universal, some-statements are called particu­ lar. The difference between affirmation and denial is a qualitative difference, the difference between all and some a quantitative difference. The medieval abbre­ viations A, I, E, and 0 are generally used as indications of \"universal affirmative,'' \"particular affirmative,\" \"universal negative,\" and \"particular negative\" state­ ments respectively.8 The examples (la) to (ld) may thus be i dentified as follows: (la) universal affirmative\n\n(A)\n\n( lb) particular affirmative ( lc) universal negative\n\n(I) (E)\n\n( ld) particular negative\n\n(0)\n\nIn example ( 1), both the premises and the conclusion of the syllogism are universal affirmative. It is also possible for a syllogism to contain categorical statements of some other type, and it can also contain a variety of types. It Bnle letters A and I represent the first two vowels in the Latin word afflrmo (I affirm), the letters E and 0 the vowels of the Latin word nego (I deny).\n\n2. ANALYTIC, DIALECTIC, AND RHETORIC\n\n35\n\nmight, for example, consist o f three particular negative statements o r two par­ ticular affirmative statements (e.g., the premises) and one universal negative statement (the conclusion):\n\n(4) Some humans are not mortal.\n\n(0)\n\n(5) Some Greeks are not humans.\n\n(0)\n\n(6) Some Greeks are not mortal.\n\n(0)\n\n(7) Some humans are mortal.\n\n(I)\n\n(8) Some Greeks are human.\n\n(I) (E)\n\n(9) No Greeks are mortal.\n\n(conclusion)\n\n(conclusion)\n\nUsing the various possible ways of combining different types of categorical statement, it is possible to indicate the mood of a syllogism. This is usually done with the medieval abbreviations A, I, E, and 0. The mood of the syllogism (1-3) is thus MA, that of the syllogism (4-6) is 000, and that of the syllogism (7-9) is liE. Syllogisms, moreover, may be characterized b"
