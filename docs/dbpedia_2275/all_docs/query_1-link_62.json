        "text": "In November red light will bathe hundreds of cathedrals, churches, monuments and public buildings around the world. This is an international campaign to raise awareness of the persecution of Christians and the need for religious freedom.\n\nThe idea to light a building in red first came from ACN Brazil: in October 2015 the Statue of Christ, the Redeemer in Rio de Janeiro was illuminated in red on the occasion of the visit of Pater Douglas from Iraq. In April 2016 ACN Italia copied this idea and lit the Fontana di Trevi in red. ACN UK took the idea further and created #RedWednesday to commemorate all persecuted Christians on a specific November Wednesday. In November 2016 the Houses of Parliament, Westminster Abbey, St Paul’s Cathedral, Brentwood Cathedral, St George’s Coptic Orthodox Cathedral, St John’s Wood Synagogue and the Imam Khoei Islamic Centre in London were among hundreds of public buildings which were illuminated in blood-red light, in an act of solidarity with those around the world suffering persecution because of their faith.\n\nNow this initiative is spreading worldwide.
