        "text": "A military ordinariate is an ecclesiastical jurisdiction of the Roman Catholic Church, of Latin or Eastern Rite, responsible for the pastoral care of Catholics serving in the armed forces of a nation.\n\nUntil 1986, they were called \"military vicariates\" and had a status similar to that apostolic vicariates, which are headed by a bishop who receives his authority by delegation from the Pope. The apostolic constitution Spirituali militum curae of 21 April 1986 raised their status, declaring that the bishop who heads one of them is an \"ordinary\", holding authority by virtue of his office, and not by delegation from another person in authority.[1] It likened the military vicariates to dioceses.[2] Each of them is headed by a bishop, who may have the personal rank of archbishop. If the bishop is a diocesan rather than a titular bishop, he is likely to delegate the daily functions to an auxiliary bishop or a lower cleric.\n\nSome nations have military ordinariates of the Anglican Communion, Lutheranism and Eastern Orthodoxy.[3]\n\nThe personal ordinariates for Anglicans entering the Catholic Church announced on 20 October 2009 are similar in some ways to the existing military ordinariates.[4] But the jurisdiction of military ordinariates is cumulative to that of the diocesan bishops.[5]\n\nList of Roman Catholic military ordinariates[]\n\nCountry Military Ordinariate Notes Africa Kenya Military Ordinariate of Kenya created military vicariate and first military vicar appointment 20 January 1964;
