        "text": "The purpose of this article is to understand, from the perspective of the Bolivian Aymara identity of Bolivia, the intrinsic relation these persons have with Nature. This task is developed through the study of what they call Pachamama (sacred Mother Earth), which is part of their identity as an ‘all interrelated whole, the Suma Qamaña or Good Living’, and which can be considered a non-Western epistemology. Their worldview breaks with the Western (anthropocentric) conception of environment that informs European and Anglo-Saxon continental law, and that is currently predominant in international standards of reference. Proponents of this perspective achieved a transformation in the international treatment of Nature, recognised by the United Nations (Resolution 63/278 of 2009, promoted by the Bolivian State), gaining inspiration from the inclusion by Ecuador of Pacha Mama (Nature) as a subject of rights in its constitution (2008).\n\nThe concept of huaca is so fluid as to become almost meaningless as an analytical tool unless it is defined specifically with reference to the topic at hand, that is, centers (Fig. 9.1). Huaca is also used here to refer to Sacred Places in the landscape, and how material objects, living things, including people, attain the status of huaca and have distinct symbolic meanings with reference to such places. Particular emphasis is given to how such Sacred Places are differentiated from secular space and the role(s) ushnus may play in status differentiation and sociocultural development. Huaca shrines (huacacuna) were powerful social and political places, and as they gained legitimacy worshipers would build temples or platforms and make offerings. The oracle at Pachacamac, located near present day Lima in southern coastal Peru, was in fact so powerful and highly venerated throughout the coast and highlands that even the Inca built a temple to the Sun (Inti) and to the Virgins of the Sun (mamaconas) at that locality and made offerings of textiles, gold and silver (Salomon and Urioste, 1991 [c. 1598–1608]:Chap. 22, Sect. 277).\n\nThis study, based on fieldwork in rural Lanquín, Guatemala, discusses cultural continuity and the sense of historicity through agricultural rituals and worship of the agricultural deity Tzuultaq’as. The place, Lanquín, and the Q’eqchi’ Maya peasant farmers are situated within a two-fold tension and contradiction. Geographically remote in relation to the economic centers in Guatemala, and marginal in infrastructural development, while their cash crop harvests never fail to be effected by the fluctuations of the global market. From the eclectic stance merging both theories of cultural essentialism and constructivism, by juxtaposing the emblematic event of the anti-Monsanto Law movement in 2014 in Guatemala, and by the calendrical cycles of ritual events, routines, and ceremonials in rural Lanquín, the subsistence practices of milpa (corn field) cultivation emerge as a central theme for cultural survival and continuity. The aggregated clusters of ritual processions and the system of sy...\n\nThe ethnographic monograph \"Earth Beings\" from Marisol de la Cadena takes a closer look at indigenous practices that have challenged modern state politics in Peru in the last fifty years and that are described as \"cosmopolitics.“ Through a complex ethnographic narration, composed of seven stories and two interludes, the author shows the political relevance that natural entities, also called \"Earth beings,\" play in the lives and political struggles of two indigenous leaders from a community located in the region of Cuzco. This approach to indigenous politics in a postcolonial context not only invites us to acknowledge other forms of existence and other forms of \"doing politics,“ but it also critically revises ethnographic readings about indigenous practices."
