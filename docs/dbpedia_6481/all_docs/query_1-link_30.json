        "text": "The KiHa 58 series, along with the similar KiRo 28, KiRo 58, KiHa 28 and KiYu 25 series, are Japanese diesel multiple units operated by the Japanese National Railways and its various successor companies from May 1961 to March 2011.\n\nHistory[]\n\nBuilt from 1961 to 1969 by Fuji Heavy Industries (now known as Subaru Corporation), Niigata Tekkō (now known as Niigata Transys), Nippon Sharyo, Teikoku Sharyō (now defunct) and Tokyu Car Corporation (now known as J-TREC), the KiHa 58 series was originally used as an \"express\" diesel railcar to supplement similar railcars which would run on commuter services. The 1,863 cars produced were used by almost all of JR's divisions; some cars would even see service on the Fujikyu Railway and the Arida Railway.\n\nAs most of these diesel railcars were operational for over 50 years, their age began to show and they were gradually replaced by newer railcars. The last regular KiHa 58 series cars in operation belonged to JR Kyushu; these were withdrawn from service in March 2011. The last cars in service under JR ownership was the Kenji Joyful Train set; it was retired on 8 September 2018. Many KiHa 58 series cars still remain in service on smaller private railroads. Many surplus KiHa 58 series cars were converted into Joyful Trains, with the vast majority of Joyful Trains having been converted from these cars, and numerous cars remain in preservation.\n\nIn 1989, some KiHa 58 and 65 series cars were converted by JR Kyushu into the unique KiHa 71 series set used on Yufuin no Mori services.\n\nDesign[]\n\nThe cars have had the same traditional body style of various Japanese DMUs as manufactured by Fuji Heavy Industries, Niigata Tekkō and similar companies.\n\nSome cars were experimentally fitted with musical horns; those cars would have two additional red bands on their cabs. These musical horns have since been removed.\n\nSpecifications[]\n\nConstruction is of steel. Each car is 21.3 meters long and 2.944 meters wide. The cars all use DMH17H prime movers.\n\nPreservation[]\n\nThe following KiHa 58 series cars have been preserved:\n\nCar number Manufacturer Date manufactured Date retired Previous sets Location Notes
