        "text": "There's still time for summer adventures\n\nDimitra Lavrakas, Senior Voice Travel Correspondent|Aug 1, 2020\n\nHere it is at the end of the summer and travel and tourism are still at a standstill, adding to statewide unemployment and stalled revenue for large and small businesses across the state. This affects Alaska mightily. The Resource Development Council of Alaska reported that summer 2018 volume showed an increase of 100,000 visitors from summer 2017. The cruise market grew by seven percent or 79,300 visitors. The air market increased by one percent or 9,600 visitors, while the highway/ferry...\n\nSteals and deals around Alaska\n\nDimitra Lavrakas, Senior Voice Travel Correspondent|Jul 1, 2020\n\nWith the state opening up somewhat there is hope for travel. Many lodges and inns are closed this year while nearby accommodations are open – and offering some deals. The Glacier Bay Lodge is closed for 2020, opening again in 2021, but always offers a 10 percent senior (55 and over) discount. The lodge sits in a wooded site and is very cozy. Glacier Bay is remote and hard to get to but well worth it. Glacier Bay National Park spans over 4,000 square miles and is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and...\n\nTravel options remain iffy for now\n\nDimitra Lavrakas, Senior Voice Travel Correspondent|Jun 1, 2020\n\nWhen I contacted Scott McMurren, who has published the Alaska Travelgram each week since 1999, for his take on tourism at this strange moment in time, he wrote, \"Not sure how much insight I can share, aside from 'subject to change without notice.' \"Well, the pandemic affects every aspect of our lives, including how, where and when we travel. It's kneecapped our efforts to plan. So those of us in the business need to consider how to keep each other safe... as well as our guests. That's job one....\n\nThese movies, books take you traveling\n\nDimitra Lavrakas, Senior Voice Travel Correspondent|May 1, 2020\n\nWell now, here we are. The Canadian Border is still closed and there's the difficulty of traveling to other locations where officials continue to uphold social distancing and stay-at-home advisories. But Alaska has opened up and maybe it's time to hit the road or maybe, if you have underlying health concerns, to sit in a nice comfy chair and watch a good travel movie or read though travel guides to prepare you to go when the world becomes more welcoming. Movies with scenery and emotional punch...\n\nRestrictions are a disappointment for vacationers\n\nDimitra Lavrakas, Senior Voice Travel Correspondent|Apr 1, 2020\n\nWell this is a conundrum for a travel writer - travel restrictions. I have said this before and I will say it again: you live in one of the most beautiful places in the world, one that millions of people travel to, so get out on the road and see your state. And spring is one of the best times to journey across Alaska. It's a quiet time before the hordes come (or not this year) and the weather is usually pretty good with not-too-low temperatures and sun. There's life flooding back into the...\n\nThe birds are coming! The birds are coming!\n\nDimitra Lavrakas, Senior Voice Travel Correspondent|Mar 1, 2020\n\nLet's face it, the coronavirus has changed travel plans all over the planet. Where does a nervous Alaskan go to have fun and adventures? Your own back yard. Millions of tourists flock to The Last Frontier every year but residents have the envious cat seat to all the state has to offer – you just have to hit the road. A birder's delight Across the world and the Lower 48, birds fly north to breed and hatch their young. While not in the numbers of even 40 years ago that Elders in Utqiagvik told me...\n\nMemorials continue to fascinate enthusiasts\n\nDimitra Lavrakas, Senior Voice Travel Correspondent|Feb 1, 2020\n\nIt may seem macabre, but visiting graveyards is a time-honored activity. Other than our relatives, cemeteries can reveal the lives of famous people and the many who left the world they departed a better place. Living in New England now, I am struck by the old-time fire and brimstone on the gravestones in nearby cemeteries that go way back to 1644. And the quality of the carvings in the tight crystals of local granite have weathered the centuries well. While steam engine followers have earned...\n\nTrip a bust? Change it up, quickly\n\nDimitra Lavrakas, Senior Voice Travel Correspondent|Jan 1, 2020\n\nI once heard a story about an American couple, who traveled on a long-awaited vacation trip to India - they landed in Kolkata (once called Calcutta), took a taxi to the Hilton and never came out again until it was time for a taxi back to the airport. How do you manage disappointment, or in this case fear of crowds, on arrival at the place of your dreams, only to find it so overwhelming you want to leave? It's a combination of flexibility, turning on a dime and travel insurance. Recently, my...\n\nStop over in a very cool country\n\nDimitra Lavrakas, Senior Voice Travel Correspondent|Dec 1, 2019\n\nIf you're a \"Game of Thrones\" fan, Iceland calls to you. While you can do a self-guided tour of film locations, those all-too-familiar-to-Alaskans Gray Line buses will also take you there. Season two shifted to Iceland, and you will tour Gullfoss waterfall and the Bloody Gate at Pingvellir National Park, a UNESCO World Heritage site, where the Althing, the ages-old Icelandic parliament was seated. Iceland Air (www.icelandair.com) offers a reasonable round-ticket for two that takes you from Ancho...\n\nAlzheimer's chorus brings together music and the mind\n\nDimitra Lavrakas, For Senior Voice|Nov 1, 2019\n\nThose with dementia find their world diminished, but they don't know that. It is their caretakers and loved ones who see the change and long for the time when they were present. It is a hard experience, but sadly one that oftentimes comes with aging. There's a song in the air The Alzheimer's Resource of Alaska is trying out an approach that has been successful elsewhere - a chorus comprised of dementia patients and their caregivers they are calling \"Voices of the Last Frontier.\" And in a way,...\n\nTraveling safely in an uncertain world\n\nDimitra Lavrakas, Senior Voice Travel Correspondent|Nov 1, 2019\n\nWe live in troubling times and that's an understatement. The world reels with refugees: In the Middle East and North Africa there are 2.74 million; Africa has 4.41 million; in Europe, 4.39 million; and Asia and the Pacific, 3.83 million, according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees office. So where can an American travel safely? Prepare for your trip Before you go, take a look at the Overseas Security Advisory Council's website https://www.osac.gov/Content/Browse/Report. The OSAC is a joint venture between the Department of...\n\nRejoice Alaskans! Jet lag is strong eastbound, but returning is a dream\n\nDimitra Lavrakas, Senior Voice Travel Correspondent|Oct 1, 2019\n\nAlaskans travel for pleasure and often for the necessity of seeing far-flung family, and so jet lag is our constant companion. But a recent study from the Sleep Cycle Institute in Gothenburg, Sweden, looked at more than 1.5 million nights’ worth of sleep data from people who traveled east, meaning forward in time, to the west, or backward in time, and without traversing any time zones (the control group) to take a look at how travel interferes with our sleep. Traveling east turns out to have the worst effect on sleep, according to the study, b...\n\nAccessible and overlooked Belgium\n\nDimitra Lavrakas, Senior Voice Travel Correspondent|Sep 1, 2019\n\nComing in the year of the 100th anniversary of World War I, the \"War to End All Wars,\" it is only fitting to consider a trip to this often overlooked European country. For those of us of a certain age who learned to recite poetry at school, cemented in our memory is the haunting \"In Flanders Field,\" by Canadian physician Lieutenant-Colonel John McCrae, who wrote it after the Second Battle of Ypres and which was the inspiration for the remembrance red poppies sold to this day on Veterans Day. Bel...\n\nAlaska Airlines upgrades, expands terminal in Seattle\n\nDimitra Lavrakas, Senior Voice Travel Correspondent|Sep 1, 2019\n\nIn mid-July Alaska Airlines announced completion of the first phase of the Sea-Tac’s North Satellite Modernization Project. As part of the $658.3 million project, the Port and Alaska Airlines unveiled eight new gates, expanded locally-based dining and retail options and the brand-new, flagship Alaska Airlines Lounge. “The old North Satellite worked for 45 years and worked well, but it’s become a living time capsule. We are now headed into the future with a stunning facility that improves the passenger experience with more space, light and s...\n\nOn the trail of Japanese snow monkeys\n\nDimitra Lavrakas, Senior Voice Travel Correspondent|Aug 1, 2019\n\nWe've all seen people who remind us of animals, like turtles or owls, but I once saw an elderly lady in a bank and she looked just like a snow monkey. I couldn't stop staring and decided that some day I'd go to Japan to see them. Snow monkeys live in Jigokudani, which means \"Hell's Valley\" in Japanese, in Yamanouchi, Nagano Prefecture along the Yokoyu River, downstream from Shiga Kogen. Shiga Kogen is a ski resort and hiking spot, located in the Jōshin'etsu-kōgen National Park in the highlands o...\n\nSee the world and improve your craft\n\nDimitra Lavrakas, Senior Voice Travel Correspondent|Jul 1, 2019\n\nWe travel for many reasons-to see friends and family, relax and get a tan to escape winter, but why not improve your artwork with a trip to someplace you've never been for a workshop? Retirement can be a difficult time for those aging out of jobs that once consumed our daily lives. The space that opens up in our time seems to be a pit that must be filled or we are left to fritter away the rest of our lives bored in front of a TV set. It doesn't have to be so. Cindi Lagoudakis, a retired U.S....\n\nHead out across Alaska for summer fun\n\nDimitra Lavrakas, Senior Voice Travel Correspondent|Jun 1, 2019\n\nFrom north to south, Alaska has some great festivals for you to attend, so get out and meet the rest of your state. Fairbanks stays up late The 38th Midnight Sun festival in downtown Fairbanks brings you the best of Alaska -with food trucks from across the state, Made in Alaska crafts such as pottery, jewelry, art and clothing. Along with the car smash, an Alaska-style junker derby, events include pony rides, a gold panning booth, a skate park and a midway on 4th Avenue. Just Google 2019...\n\nTips for photography while traveling\n\nDimitra Lavrakas, Senior Voice Travel Correspondent|May 1, 2019\n\nI was reading a travel article recently and noticed a photograph the writer took of a local in the country he was covering. They were not smiling. In fact, they were scowling. It reminded me of the time I watched a visitor to Utqiagvik take a photo of three Inupiat women elders in the MarkAir terminal. They were dressed in the latest fashion of exotic Hawaiian prints for the covers of their traditional parkas and rhinestone pins on their wolverine ruffs that seemed to be a friendly contest...\n\nSwitzerland's beauty goes beyond chocolate and fondue\n\nDimitra Lavrakas, Senior Voice Travel Correspondent|Apr 1, 2019\n\nThe first time I traveled to Switzerland I felt like I was in a postcard and any moment I'd step through it. I felt the same about Alaska. Places so mind-bogglingly beautiful cause one to go around with your mouth open - it's just \"wow, wow, wow\" all the time. And the Swiss are very nice, very polite and very, very clean. From the quaint villages and farms pitched on a 45-degree mountainous angle to cosmopolitan towns like Geneva, Lucerne and Zurich, your experience in this tiny country is sure...\n\nAfrican American Trailblazers cut a trail for us all\n\nDimitra Lavrakas, For Senior Voice|Feb 1, 2019\n\nEditor's note: Some of the times and dates for the Black History Month events changed after our print deadline and have been updated in this online version of the story, below. This month, nine Alaskan African Americans and members of the Black Corps of Engineers will be saluted as Trailblazers by the Shiloh Community Development, Inc.'s Media Justice Project. This recognition is for achievements and contributions to the state over the last 75 years that are not often found in history books,...\n\nVancouver is just a short hop away\n\nDimitra Lavrakas, Senior Voice Travel Correspondent|Feb 1, 2019\n\nAlaskans will find much familiar in Vancouver. On the shores of the Pacific Ocean, with a backdrop of the North Shore Mountains, the tail end of the Coast Mountains, it could almost be Anchorage or Juneau. But there's a difference. Home to close to 640,000 people, it's near the population count of 739,000 of all Alaska. But think of it – that means in the 1,111 square miles of the city you're among the number of people that inhabit Alaska's 663,300 square miles. Tight squeeze. Cosmopolitan w...\n\nRivers offer a different kind of cruise\n\nDimitra Lavrakas, Senior Voice Travel Corresondent|Jan 1, 2019\n\nIf you live in an Alaska town that has a solid cruise ship economy, then you probably long for the quiet tourist shoulder season. Pity the people who see no down time. Rejoice that you have a break. So maybe it's time you took a cruise just to see what all the fuss is about. The Caribbean? Panama Canal? How about a river cruise through some of the most celebrated towns of Europe? Choices, choices Unlike the big cruise ships that come to Alaska, river cruises offer levels of tour participation....\n\nPay a visit to the big man and his reindeer\n\nDimitra Lavrakas, Senior Voice Travel Correspondent|Dec 1, 2018\n\nYou're never too old to sit in Santa's lap. It's true. One year I was in Nordstrom admiring their stunning Santa Claus when a woman next to me confessed she still visits Santa every year. There is something about a Santa Claus that pulls on your heartstrings no matter how old you are. I look back at one photo of me sitting in Santa's lap and I have a look of total adoration. This is perhaps one reason my life companion is a hippie version of Santa. And still, a man with a white beard and long...\n\nFairbanks has its own Aging and Disability Resource Center\n\nDimitra Lavrakas, For Senior Voice|Nov 1, 2018\n\nIn Fairbanks, the North Star Council on Aging’s new Aging and Disability Center (ADRC) is going “full blast,” said Beth Grey, program coordinator for senior services. “We just opened October 1,” Grey said. “We weren’t supposed to open until January 1, but with the new regulations we opened early. We call it a soft opening phase, but it doesn’t feel like that.” There should be an open house in January, Grey said, once the program gets solidly on its feet. For the last 10 years, Fairbanks was served out of the Soldotna ADRC office, Grey said. Add...\n\nIn the beginning: A visit to Plymouth\n\nDimitra Lavrakas, Senior Voice Travel Correspondent|Nov 1, 2018\n\nThanksgiving is more than a family feast, it is the story of how we came to be here in this country and how we were helped by the indigenous population. Plimouth Plantation in Plymouth, Massachusetts, is a time warp kind of place. As you stroll down the main streets lined with thatched homes and crude wood corrals of farm animals, performers in period dress will not break character. You ask about President Trump and they will say, \"I know not of this Trump.\" This is where the Pilgrims spent..."
