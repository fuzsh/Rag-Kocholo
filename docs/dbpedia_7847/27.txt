Vaduz is the capital of Liechtenstein and also the seat of the national parliament. The small city, which is located along the Rhine, had about 5,700 residents in the 2020s. One of the most prominent landmarks of Vaduz is Vaduz Castle, perched atop a steep hill overlooking the city. It is home to the reigning prince of Liechtenstein and the Liechtenstein princely family. The city's distinctive architecture is also displayed in the landmarks of its historic district. Although Vaduz is internationally the best-known town in the principality, it is not the largest; the neighboring municipality of Schaan has a larger population.
