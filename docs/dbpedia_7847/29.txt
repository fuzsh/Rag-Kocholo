Vaduz is the charming capital of Liechtenstein, and a lovely town to explore. What are the best things to do in Vaduz? Here a few tips!

About Vaduz

Vaduz is the capital of the Principality of Liechtenstein. Located in the Rhine Valley, on the eastern bank of the Rhine River, Vaduz is surrounded by beautiful mountain scenery. One of the smallest capital cities in the world, it has a charming and picturesque appearance.

How small is small? Vaduz had about 5,600 residents in 2020, according to the latest estimates. Although a small town, it has great symbolic significance for Liechtenstein.

Vaduz has a rich history dating back to the Middle Ages. The area on which the city is built was first inhabited in prehistoric times and has had various rulers over the centuries. From the beginning of the 18th century, the area was ruled by the princes of Liechtenstein, after which the principality was formed. Vaduz eventually became the capital of Liechtenstein in 1939, when it succeeded formerly the co-princess city of Schaan.

The city offers numerous historical sites, including Vaduz Castle, which towers over the city. The castle serves as the residence of the Prince of Liechtenstein and is a major tourist attraction. In addition to the castle, other historic buildings, churches, museums, and art galleries reflect the city‚Äôs rich culture.

Liechtenstein is also a great destination for hiking enthusiasts, as hiking trails abound in the country. Overall, Vaduz is the beautiful capital of a small, but prosperous, principality with a mix of history, nature, and modern amenities.

I visited Vaduz on a day trip from Chur, Switzerland, and was pleasantly surprised. The city has many beautiful sights that I will describe in this article.

The most beautiful Vaduz sights

What to do in Vaduz? And what is there to see? These are the best Vaduz sights not to miss during your trip to Liechtenstein.

Schloss Vaduz

Schloss Vaduz is a magnificent castle and the residence of the Prince of Liechtenstein. It stands prominently on a hilltop, offering impressive views of the city and surrounding mountains.

Originally built in the 12th century, the castle has undergone several renovations and additions over the centuries, making it today a mix of medieval and Renaissance architecture. Although the castle is not open to the public, it remains an important symbol of the principality of Liechtenstein‚Äôs rich history and princely traditions. Around the castle are several hiking trails and viewpoints.

Walk via the Alte Rheinbr√ºcke to Switzerland

The Alte Rheinbr√ºcke is a historic wooden bridge located over the Rhine River and connects Liechtenstein with Switzerland. What makes this bridge so special is that it is the last wooden bridge across the Rhine. It is a whopping 135 meters long and was completed in 1901.

The bridge is only accessible to pedestrians and cyclists, and in the middle is a sign showing that you are crossing the border between Liechtenstein and Switzerland.

Discover the Planetenweg hiking trail

Fancy a nice, not-too-difficult hike? The Planetenweg hiking trail along the Rhine is a fun one to do (planeten means planets). This unique hiking trail runs from Schaan to Triesen (Vaduz is in between) and is about 4.5 kilometers long.

Scale models of the sun and all the planets of our solar system have been placed along the route at exact scale distances. This educational and scenic walk is not only a physical adventure but also a journey through space, making it both fun and educational for adults and children alike.

Wander through St√§dtle

St√§dtle is a charming old town center and filled with picturesque buildings, cozy cafes, and quaint stores. It is a great place to explore. Wander through the quiet streets and admire the historic architecture.

Visit the Liechtenstein Center for information

The best place to start your visit to Vaduz (and Liechtenstein) is the Liechtenstein Center, aka the tourism office. Here you can get maps and brochures with information about Vaduz and Liechtenstein. There is also always someone ready to help you if you have questions or are looking for recommendations. I noticed that they are very friendly and helpful here.

In addition, this is the place to buy fun souvenirs, including a Liechtenstein stamp to put on your passport.

Visit the interesting museums

Right next to the Liechtenstein Center, you will see several modern buildings. Almost all of these are museums and each one is worth checking out.

Kunstmuseum Liechtenstein: This modern museum houses an impressive collection of modern artworks. From paintings to sculptures, you will find works by famous artists such as Roy Lichtenstein and Andy Warhol.

Postal Museum: If you are interested in postal history, be sure to visit this museum. Here you will learn about the evolution of postal services and see old stamps and letters.

Liechtensteinisches LandesMuseum: Discover more about the history and culture of Liechtenstein at this interesting museum. From archaeological artifacts to traditional crafts, you will learn about the land and its people here.

Tip! Are you planning on visiting several Vaduz sights? If you have to pay for everything separately, the costs will add up considerably. Therefore, it may be convenient to purchase the Liechtenstein Adventure Pass. It costs CHF25 for one day (comparatively cheaper if you purchase it for several days). With this pass you can use, among other things, all buses in Liechtenstein, you can visit museums for free, taste wine, and get delicious delicacies. Check this website for more information.

Cathedral St. Florin

The Cathedral St. Florin is one of the most striking buildings in Vaduz and dominates the city‚Äôs skyline. This beautiful cathedral is dedicated to Saint Florin, the patron saint of Liechtenstein, and is an important spiritual and historical symbol of the country.

The nineteenth-century church stands out tremendously for its tall narrow tower. Inside, you can enjoy a serene atmosphere and the beautiful brightly colored stained glass windows.

Taste wine in the Hofkellerei des F√ºrsten von Liechtenstein

Did you know that there is a vineyard in the middle of town? This belongs to the Hofkellerei des F√ºrsten von Liechtenstein, the wine cellars of the Prince of Liechtenstein. As a purveyor to the royal house of Liechtenstein, the Hofkellerei has a long tradition of producing high-quality wines.

The estate includes beautiful vineyards and modern wineries where artisanal techniques are used to produce delicious wines. Here you can have a wine tasting and a tour of the vineyards and cellars to discover how Hofkellerei‚Äôs wines are made.

Even if you don‚Äôt drink wine, it‚Äôs fun to take a walk through the vineyard, as there‚Äôs a nice walking path through it.

See Vaduz from above on a scenic hike

Like nearby Switzerland and Austria, Liechtenstein is a true hiking paradise. In total, there are 400 kilometers of well-maintained hiking trails! As a hiking enthusiast, I naturally wanted to explore Vaduz and Liechtenstein on foot, so I climbed up to the castle from Vaduz and then hiked to Triesenberg.

From the trail, you have great views of western Liechtenstein and the mountains of Switzerland. A great way to see more of Vaduz and Liechtenstein!
