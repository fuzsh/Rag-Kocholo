All content copyright Teaspoon of Nose 2012-2024.\n\nTucked between Switzerland and Austria, Liechtenstein is a tiny little country you may not have on your radar! But it’s a great little stopover if you’re in the region already.\n\nWhat to know about Liechtenstein\n\nA few random tidbits to know before you go!\n\nLiechtenstein doesn’t use the Euro but the Swiss Franc (CHF) instead. Most places in Liechtenstein take credit cards but keep in mind that occasionally you’ll need cash for parking meters or food stands.\n\nLiechtenstein is part of the Schengen Zone but not part of the EU. That means the borders are open (no passport checking, mostly), but it also means you’ll need to count it if you’re traveling in Europe without a visa. This may help if you’re confused.\n\nThis microstate has existed as part of a few confederations of nation-states, and then as a small independent nation since 1866. It managed to stay neutral in both world wars, largely because of its size and unobtrusive status in geopolitics.\n\nBecause of its long relationship with Germany & Austria, Liechtenstein speaks German and follows a lot of their cultural norms. For example, businesses often close at 5 p.m., and the dinner hour falls around 6 p.m. Many businesses also close on Sundays, so don’t choose Sunday as your only day in Liechtenstein!\n\nThey also use different power plugs! The sockets follow the Swiss style, not exactly the German or Italian styles. If you have a two-pronged Europlug (type C), it should work!\n\nVaduz, Liechteinstein\n\nVaduz is the capital of Liechtenstein, and if you’re only here for a day, it’s where you should focus your time. However, if you have time, I recommend giving yourself two days to get to really experience the best of Liechtenstein.\n\nIf you stay overnight, stay at Landhaus am Giessel! I stayed here for a weekend in Liechtenstein and loved it. They’re within walking distance from everything in Vaduz and close to a bus stop that can take you everywhere else. Plus, their breakfast was amazing!\n\nShould You Buy the Adventure Pass?\n\nMy number one piece of advice for your time in Liechtenstein is to buy the Adventure Pass! It works like so many other city cards, and this one is 100% worth it.\n\nIt gets you free entry into most of the museums, small gifts or tastings at other spots, and discounts on experiences throughout the whole country. If you’re staying overnight, get the 2-day pass; it’s only about $5 more and it’ll pay for itself no matter what you want to do on day two!\n\nYou can pick it up at the Liechtenstein Center right in the center of town. While there, you can get your passport stamped, pick up some souvenirs, or ask for advice on bus routes. The staff was really helpful, especially Katherine!\n\nNational Museum (Landesmuseum)\n\nIf you do one thing in Liechtenstein, do the National Museum. It covers Liechtenstein’s history and culture dating back thousands of years. There was enough history to get a sense of how this microstate came to exist, but the museum is small enough that you don’t get overwhelmed. Don’t skip the daily life and culture section, that was my favorite!\n\nTreasure Chamber (Schatzkammer)\n\nWhen you’re at the National Museum, ask for the token to enter the Treasure Chamber. The exhibition is two doors down and displays the riches of previous rulers and citizens. The Easter egg collection was my favorite: a bunch of Faberge, but also others made of every conceivable material and style!\n\nCellars of the Prince of Liechtenstein\n\nThe Adventure Pass also gives a tasting at the Cellars of the Prince of Liechtenstein! You’ll get two small glasses of wine grown in the Prince’s Vineyards. The land surrounding is beautiful as well, so make sure to wander through the grounds too! If you’re lucky, you’ll get to say hey to the resident flock of sheep among the vines.\n\nThe Old Cinema (Altes Kino)\n\nEvery day at two, the Old Theater shows a 20-minute video giving a tour of Vaduz Castle. It was really interesting to hear about the royal family of a small country and get a sense of recent history.\n\nThe Adventure Pass covers a TON more, including unlimited bus tickets! So it’s perfect for two days of exploring.\n\nWhat Else Should I Do in Vaduz?\n\nPost Museum\n\nFor some reason, Liechtenstein is known for its postage! This is a small museum dedicated to the history of their stamps. Free entry, so check it out even if for only 5 minutes. If you buy the Adventure pass, you’ll receive a free souvenir here.\n\nWalk the Old Rhine Bridge\n\nA historic pedestrian bridge sits just on the outskirts of Vaduz! It crosses the Rhine River into Switzerland and connects to gorgeous walking/biking trails. It’s a small thing, but it’s nice to get a taste of the outdoors if you’re not going hiking while in Liechtenstein.\n\nThinking of hiking? I’m sharing a full guide to outdoor Liechtenstein and all the logistics you’ll need to figure out how many days to spend in the country next week! Or grab my Thatch guide in the meantime to get all the details.\n\nVaduz Restaurants\n\nAdler\n\nIf you’re looking for a nice but not fancy meal, Adler is your best bet in Vaduz. Adler is a bit of an institution for high-quality local dishes in a setting that somehow mixes rustic with touches of elegance. Order the Käsknöpfle (cheese dumplings) or something with deer!\n\nNote that its hours change seasonally, so call ahead or just plan to go for lunch.\n\nNew Castle\n\nNew Castle is a good dinner option. Their menu has all the basics you’d expect from a place with such German & Austrian influences, like schnitzel! Naturally, that’s where we headed.\n\nCafe Amann\n\nCafe Amann is good for breakfast or lunch, offering typical European breakfast fare plus reasonably priced lunch dishes. You also get a free pastry here with the Adventure Pass!\n\nEngel\n\nEngel is great for two reasons: one, it offers Asian dishes as well as local fare for when you need a break from heavier food. It also is one of the only restaurants open on Sunday nights! This is another cultural thing common in Austria & Germany: many shops & restaurants close on Sundays, making it tough when traveling to find a meal. Engel will be open!\n\nEven if you only have a day, you’ll get a fantastic taste of Vaduz!"
