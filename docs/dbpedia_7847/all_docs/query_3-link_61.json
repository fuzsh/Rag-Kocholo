        "text": "Nestled in the heart of the Alps, Vaduz is the capital and largest city of the Principality of Liechtenstein. Despite its small size, it packs a punch with its rich history, good architecture, and picturesque landscapes.\n\nOverall, Vaduz promises a good day out and would be worth visiting if you are in nearby vicinity and looking for a day trip. Read more below about our experience in Vaduz.\n\nOverview\n\nLiechtenstein, despite being one of the smallest countries in the world, punches above its weight in terms of attractions and experiences. It is Europe’s fourth-smallest country, with an area of just over 160 square kilometres (62 square miles) and a population of 38,749 (as of 2019).\n\nVaduz, the capital of Liechtenstein, serves as the gateway to this picturesque principality. We went to Vaduz during our 2023 Interrail trip around Europe and decided to visit this city as it felt very intriguing to us.\n\nDespite its compact size, Vaduz boasts a wealth of attractions and activities that cater to all interests. Whether you’re a history buff, outdoor enthusiast, or simply looking to relax and unwind amidst stunning natural scenery, Vaduz has something for everyone.\n\nFor those seeking adventure, Vaduz offers plenty of opportunities to get out and explore the great outdoors. Hiking trails wind their way through pristine forests and alpine meadows, while mountain biking routes provide adrenaline-pumping thrills against a backdrop of breathtaking mountain vistas.\n\nIn regards to currency, Liectenstein uses the Swiss Franc (CHF), so no need to exchange currency if coming from Switzerland. Card payments are widely accepted.\n\nWe used our 0% fee cards throughout this trip to make sure we always got the better rates. Read more here about managing your finances when travelling.\n\nWhether you’re planning a day trip from Zurich to Vaduz or embarking on a longer stay, Liechtenstein’s capital city promises an unforgettable experience that will leave you longing to return time and time again.\n\nTravel to and Around Vaduz\n\nFor those looking to embark on a day trip from Zurich to Vaduz, you’re in luck! The journey from Zurich to Vaduz is incredibly scenic, with picturesque landscapes unfolding before your eyes as you make your way through the Swiss countryside.\n\nThere are plenty of trains from Zurich to the border with Vaduz. You will arrive at a city called Sargans and from there accross the parking lot you will find 2 bus lines:\n\nBus 11 – leaving every 30 minutes\n\nBus 12E (Express) – leaves every hour, reducing the 30-minute trip\n\nThe buses will both leave you at the Post Office from where you can start your itinerary. Alternatively, you can book an organised day trip from Zurich to Vaduz.\n\nOnce you arrive in Vaduz, getting around is a breeze thanks to the city’s efficient public transportation system. Whether you choose to explore on foot, by bike, or via local buses, you’ll find that Vaduz is easily navigable, allowing you to make the most of your time in this charming Alpine city.\n\nWe found that if you buy the Liechtenstein Adventure Pass you get some really astonishing perks. For only 25 CHF (one day) you can get this pass which includes all public transport in the country (including buses 11 and 12E) and entrance to all the places listed in this guide, not to mention a free pastry at the bakery in front of the Post Office. We will detail the perks for each attraction in the Things to do section.\n\nIf you have limited time in Vaduz, you can hop on the Vaduz City Train which gives you the opportunity to easily get to all the sights and attractions it has to offer.\n\nWhere to Stay in Vaduz?\n\nOn this occasion we didn’t stay in Vaduz. We only came for the day trip from Zurich, since later that evening we were supposed to go to Milan. Personally, we are not particularly sure why would someone sleep over in Vaduz as most things can be done in a day.\n\nIf you prefer to stay in a hotel, we would recommend booking your accommodation through an aggregator such as Booking.com or Agoda to get the best rates. Use the widget below to find the best accommodation in Vaduz for your specific dates.\n\nBest Time to Visit Vaduz\n\nWhile Vaduz is beautiful year-round, the best time to visit is during the summer months when the weather is warm and outdoor activities abound. However, if you’re a fan of winter sports, the snowy season offers excellent skiing and snowboarding opportunities in the nearby Alps.\n\nWe went during August and we can definitely say the city isn’t packed with tourists. Actually, we think you can count the tourist in Vaduz on your fingers.\n\nThings to do in Vaduz\n\nFrom exploring historic landmarks to indulging in gourmet cuisine, Vaduz offers a wealth of experiences that are sure to enchant and delight visitors of all ages. If planning to go on a hike we do suggest you bring your hiking shoes along.\n\nAs discussed earlier the Liechtenstein Adventure Pass alone is probably one of the main drivers to make you visit Vaduz and Liechtenstein as a whole. The pass doesn’t just apply to the capital but to the entire country. It offers several freebies in Vaduz but also in other towns in the country.\n\nThe Liechtenstein Adventure Pass also offers visitors the opportunity to explore the best attractions and activities that the principality has to offer. With the pass, you can enjoy discounted access to museums, castles, and cultural sites, as well as special offers on outdoor adventures such as hiking, biking, and skiing.\n\nWe believe it’s worth getting one if you are planning to follow this itinerary. Below are our top 10 things to do in Vaduz, Liechtenstein.\n\nOne other thing to note is that most of the attractions in Vaduz in our guide are no more than 10 min apart from each other. Most of them actually being in the same square.\n\n1. Learn about Liechtenstein at the National Museum\n\nGain insight into Liechtenstein’s fascinating history and culture at the National Museum. With exhibits spanning archaeology, folklore, and modern-day life, the museum offers a comprehensive look at the principality’s heritage and identity.\n\n2. See the Postmuseum Vaduz\n\nUpstairs from the National Museum, you will find the Postmuseum. Postmuseum Vaduz is one of the attractions in Vaduz where you can learn about Liechtenstein’s rich postal history and admire rare stamps from around the world.\n\nThey did seem to take a lot of pride in their postal service and ultimately their strategic alliance with Switzerland. Don’t forget to pick up a souvenir or two from the museum shop!\n\n3. Be Amazed at Schatzkammer Liechtenstein (Treasure Chamber)\n\nOpposite the National Museum, the Schatzkammer (Treasure Chamber), where you can marvel at exquisite treasures including precious jewels, royal regalia, and historical artifacts. This hidden gem offers a glimpse into the princely wealth and heritage of Liechtenstein.\n\nWe found this to be very impressive and a similar experience to Lisbon’s Treasury or the Bucharest National Jewels.\n\nUnfortunately photography is not allowed in the treasury and access if limited to just a few people at a time.\n\n4. Check out the Art Museum Liechtenstein\n\nImmerse yourself in the world of contemporary art at the Art Museum Liechtenstein. Housed in a striking modernist building, the museum showcases a diverse collection of works by renowned international artists, as well as pieces from Liechtenstein’s own burgeoning art scene.\n\n5. Pay your Respects at St. Florin Cathedral\n\nMarvel at the stunning architecture of St. Florin Cathedral, a beautiful Roman Catholic church dating back to the 19th century. Admire its intricate frescoes, ornate stained glass windows, and imposing bell tower as you explore this sacred site.\n\nWe even managed to get lucky and see a wedding with the bride coming out just as we were approaching the cathedral.\n\n6. Take a Photo at the Tre Cavalli Monument\n\nThe majestic 3 bronze horses (Tre Cavalli) by Swiss Sculptor Nag.Arnoldi was installed in front of Vaduz City hall in 2002. As art should be it makes you think. A little Dali and a little anything else, the horses will catch you eyes for a few minutes.\n\n7. See Vaduz Castle\n\nPerched atop a hill overlooking the city, Vaduz Castle is an iconic symbol of Liechtenstein’s rich history. While the castle itself is not open to the public, the surrounding grounds offer stunning panoramic views of the city and the Rhine Valley below.\n\nToday, Vaduz Castle serves as the official residence of the reigning Prince of Liechtenstein and his family, making it one of the few castles in Europe still inhabited by royalty.\n\nThe castle’s distinctive turreted silhouette and picturesque setting make it a popular tourist attraction, drawing visitors from around the world eager to catch a glimpse of this iconic landmark.\n\nWhen we went there we had the unfortune of it being covered in scaffolding so our photos might not be exemplary.\n\n8. Go to the Viewing Platform in the Forest Adventure Path\n\nA short stroll away from the Vaduz Castle you can observe Vaduz and in all fairness all of Liechtenstein from the viewing platform found here. It’s a 20-30 min hike through the forest so be sure to have the adequate fitness levels.\n\n9. See the Famous Red House in Vaduz\n\nThe Red House in Vaduz is a distinguished building, known locally as “Das Rote Haus”. The Red House is privately owned and serves as a residence, thus it is not open to the public for tours.\n\nHowever, its exterior and the vineyards that stretch below it—belonging to the property—offer a splendid view, making it a popular spot for photographers and a must-see landmark for visitors to Vaduz.\n\n10. Have some Local Wine at the Cellars of the Prince of Liechtenstein\n\nLocated beneath Vaduz Castle, these historic cellars house a remarkable collection of treasures, including centuries-old artifacts and priceless works of art.\n\nOverall, the cellars felt very touristy and the staff not very engaged. Having said this the Cellars offer a free wine tasting with the Adventure Pass. All in all, a good stop after coming down from the viewing platform in the forest.\n\nInteresting enough, Lichtenstein’s favourite wine and home grown type is the pinot noir as it is a strong type of grape which can withstand the harsh winters here.\n\nWhere to Eat in Vaduz\n\nGenerally speaking Liechtenstein offers a very similar Germanic, Swiss inspired cuisine.
