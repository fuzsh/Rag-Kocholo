        "text": "Vaduz Castle is the residence of the Prince of Liechtenstein, a micro-state situated in Central Europe, between Austria and Switzerland. This historical landmark is located on a hilltop at an altitude of 120 metres, overlooking the capital of Liechtenstein from its position.\n\nAlthough known for being one of the cultural symbols of Liechtenstein’s capital city as well as the residence of the Prince of Liechtenstein, the history of this castle goes way back in time to the High Middle Ages and, as such, predates the principality by large.\n\nConsequently, it is believed that the current stronghold of Vaduz was initially constructed in the 12th century. At that time, the castle (which was originally intended as a military fortress) belonged most likely to the counts of Wardenberg-Sargans, the rulers of a small state of the Holy Roman Empire. However, officially, the castle is firstly mentioned in a 1332 document.\n\nLater on, during the Swabian War of 1499 (which took place in Central Europe between the Swiss Confederacy and the Habsburgs), the castle of Vaduz was captured and burned by the army of the Swiss Confederacy. Nowadays, the castle is not open to tourists for visiting but occasional guided walks around the structure are part of the touristic attractions of Liechtenstein’s capital city Vaduz.\n\nDocumentation sources and external links:"
