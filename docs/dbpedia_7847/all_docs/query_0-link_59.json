        "text": "Introduction\n\nIntroduction\n\nIntroduction\n\nBackground\n\nThe Principality of Liechtenstein was established within the Holy Roman Empire in 1719. Occupied by both French and Russian troops during the Napoleonic Wars, it became a sovereign state in 1806 and joined the German Confederation in 1815. Liechtenstein became fully independent in 1866 when the Confederation dissolved. Until the end of World War I, it was closely tied to Austria, but the economic devastation caused by that conflict forced Liechtenstein to enter into a customs and monetary union with Switzerland. Since World War II (in which Liechtenstein remained neutral), the country's low taxes have spurred outstanding economic growth. In 2000, shortcomings in banking regulatory oversight resulted in concerns about the use of financial institutions for money laundering. However, Liechtenstein implemented anti-money laundering legislation and a Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty with the US that went into effect in 2003.\n\nGeography\n\nGeography\n\nGeography\n\nLocation\n\nCentral Europe, between Austria and Switzerland\n\nGeographic coordinates\n\n47 16 N, 9 32 E\n\nMap references\n\nEurope\n\nArea\n\ntotal: 160 sq km\n\nland: 160 sq km\n\nwater: 0 sq km\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 219\n\nArea - comparative\n\nabout 0.9 times the size of Washington, DC\n\nLand boundaries\n\ntotal: 75 km\n\nborder countries (2): Austria 34 km, Switzerland 41 km\n\nCoastline\n\n0 km(doubly landlocked)\n\nMaritime claims\n\nnone (landlocked)\n\nClimate\n\ncontinental;

The Liechtenstein economy is widely diversified with a large number of small and medium-sized businesses, particularly in the services sector. Low business taxes - a flat tax of 12.5% on income is applied - and easy incorporation rules have induced many holding companies to establish nominal offices in Liechtenstein, providing 30% of state revenues.The country participates in a customs union with Switzerland and uses the Swiss franc as its national currency. It imports more than 90% of its energy requirements. Liechtenstein has been a member of the European Economic Area (an organization serving as a bridge between the European Free Trade Association and the EU) since May 1995. The government is working to harmonize its economic policies with those of an integrated EU. As of 2015, 54% of Liechtenstein’s workforce consisted of cross-border commuters, largely from Austria, Germany, and Switzerland.Since 2008, Liechtenstein has faced renewed international pressure - particularly from Germany and the US - to improve transparency in its banking and tax systems. In December 2008, Liechtenstein signed a Tax Information Exchange Agreement with the US. Upon Liechtenstein's conclusion of 12 bilateral information-sharing agreements, the OECD in October 2009 removed the principality from its \"grey list\" of countries that had yet to implement the organization's Model Tax Convention. By the end of 2010, Liechtenstein had signed 25 Tax Information Exchange Agreements or Double Tax Agreements. In 2011, Liechtenstein joined the Schengen area, which allows passport-free travel across 26 European countries. In 2015, Liechtenstein and the EU agreed to clamp down on tax fraud and evasion and in 2018 will start automatically exchanging information on the bank accounts of each other’s residents.\n\nGDP (purchasing power parity)\n\n$4.978 billion (2014 est.)\n\n$3.2 billion (2009 est.)\n\n$3.216 billion (2008 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 179\n\nGDP (official exchange rate)\n\n$6.672 billion(2014 est.)
