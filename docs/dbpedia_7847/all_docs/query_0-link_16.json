The princely residence presides high above the little town of Vaduz, which is the capital of the principality and has about 5,000 inhabitants. The medieval castle was upgraded in the 16th and 17th centuries.\n\nThe people of Liechtenstein call their main town \"Staedtle\" or \"LIttle Town\" and their country \"Laendle\" or \"Little Country\". Considering the geographic size of the country, these diminutives are apt, but not at all so if one thinks of the history and importance of Vaduz as a financial center.\n\nFor hundreds of years culinary specialties have been enjoyed in the Old Town, at the Loewen Inn, for example, which has been in existence since 1380. The Art Museum (Kunstmuseum) of Liechtenstein houses one of Europe's oldest private collections in a modern, prize-winning museum building. The Regional Museum showcases the history of the principality and a visit to the Stamp Museum is a must for every philatelist. Castle Vaduz is the emblem of Liechtenstein and the residence of the royal family."
