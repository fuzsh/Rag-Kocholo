        "text": "Where Is Liechtenstein?\n\nThe Central European country of Liechtenstein is a doubly landlocked nation. Austria borders the nation to the north and east while Switzerland borders it to the south and west. As one of the Alpine countries, Liechtenstein is mainly mountainous in nature. The country encompasses an area of 160 square km and houses a population of only about 37,877 individuals. Liechtenstein is Europe’s fourth smallest country.\n\nWhat Type of Government Does Liechtenstein Have?\n\nThe constitution of Liechtenstein can be described as a mixed type where the political power is shared by both an elected body and the monarch. The Prince of Liechtenstein serves as the head of state of the country and wields significant political power. The executive branch of the government comprises of the Prime Minister and the other ministers who form the Cabinet. The legislative powers are vested in both the Landtag (Parliament) and the government. The country also has several judicial courts that deal with matters of justice.\n\nWhat Is the Capital of Liechtenstein?\n\nVaduz is Liechtenstein’s capital city. It is a small city with an area of only 17.3 square km and a population of only around 5,500 inhabitants. The population density in Vaduz is 288 individuals per square km. Vaduz is located in the Rhine Valley along the Rhine River. The city features an oceanic climate. The city is located at an elevation of around 1,493 feet. Unlike most other capital cities, Vaduz is not the largest city in the country. Schaan has a larger population than this city.\n\nHistory of Vaduz\n\nThe name of the city is mentioned as Faduzes in manuscripts dating to the 12th century. The settlement was nearly completely destroyed during the Swabian Wars in 1499. It was, however, rebuilt later and the castle was restored in the early 20th century. The castle at Vaduz became the permanent residence of the ruling king of Liechtenstein when Francis Joseph II came to power in 1938. Since then, it has remained the capital of the country.\n\nRole of Vaduz as the Capital of Liechtenstein\n\nAs the capital city of Liechtenstein, Vaduz is home to the Vaduz Castle, the home of the ruling princely family. The castle is located on a hilltop providing a view of the entire city below. The meeting place of the Landtag is also located in the city. Other notable landmarks of Vaduz include the City Hall, the Government House, etc."
