Liechtenstein is known for its castles, although of these there are only two which are still well preserved, namely Vaduz Castle and Burg Gutenberg. Vaduz Castle is the stunning palace and official residence of the Prince of Liechtenstein. The castle was constructed in the 12th century and overlooks Liechtenstein’s capital city of Vaduz, which is named after the castle. It is unfortunately not open to the public .\n\nPhoto by Henrique Ferreira on Unsplash"
