        "text": "Old Rhine Bridge Vaduz-SevelenIf you are coming by bike or on foot, you can use this, the last extant wooden bridge across the Rhine into or out of Liechtenstein. The bridge has been renovated several times (most lately 2009/10) but goes back to an over a century old predecessor. Until 1975 (when a new concrete bridge opened) this bridge also carried motorized traffic\n\nSchloss VaduzThe official residence of the Prince of Liechtenstein. Excellent views of the surrounding area can be gained by taking the short walk up to the Castle which hangs above Vaduz. The walk is gentle and goes up the side of the hill and through the woods and emerges at the side entrance to the Castle. It is not possible to enter the grounds of the castle, but walking around the perimeter is fine. In winter it can be very slippery, so if visiting at this time it is best to wear suitable footwear to avoid accidents.\n\nLandtagsgebÃ¤udeThe official seat of parliament since 2008, this building may look a bit bland on the outside, but it is where Liechtensteinian politics (well, the parts not decided by the FÃ¼rst anyway) is made."
