        "text": "Vaduz Self-Guided City Walk\n\nVaduz is the capital city of the Principality of Liechtenstein. The country is located between Switzerland and Austria. At only 25km long, it is one of the smallest countries in the world.\n\nThe population of Vaduz is around 5,500, so it can easily be seen in a day.\n\nThe Vaduz Self-Guided City Walk will guide you through the lovely pedestrian-only area where a number of the key buildings are located, as well as up the hillside to the castle.\n\nThe main reason to visit are the magnificent views of the mountains that surround the country, definitely a must-see.\n\nWalk Distance 3.4km/2.1miles including a steep walk up to the castle."
