        "text": "Liechtenstein is a very small country that borders to Switzerland and Austria. The surface of the country is only about 160km². Håkan I drove through Liechtenstein on our second Eurotrip in 2016, we wanted to visit the capital, which is Vaduz.\n\nEvery freaking capital in Europe is beautiful, and Vaduz is no exception. When we arrived there, they had some kind of folk fest going on. Everybody was really happy and friendly and we felt instantly at home. We found a nice campground to pitch our tent, and then went out to explore Vaduz. And we were not disappointed!\n\nBest location\n\nThe country is interspersed in the mountains and the surroundings are spectacular. It is in the middle of Europe so it is easy for the inhabitants to go wherever they like. I kind of envy that living in the freaking north of nothing…\n\nUnfortunately the weather wasn´t at its greatest when we were here though. But at least it wasn´t raining!\n\nNew and Old\n\nVaduz has a bold mixture of old and new. The old buildings are so cute with the cobble stone roads curving around them. And the new are just stunning architectural dreams. And the mixture between the two is absolutely genius!\n\nSpeed sightseeing\n\nThe city is very small and you´ve found everything that´s interesting within a couple of hours. For us, who like speedsightseeing through the cities, this is perfect! We´re more fans of the nature and, above all, to hike. But some cities you are bound to see! Like all of the capitals of Europe for an instance….\n\nConclusion\n\nI love the cities of Europe! Vaduz is no exception! But as I mentioned, I´m more of a fan of nature. So I will only give Vaduz a 3 out of 5 stars. It´s cute, picturesque and if you happen to drive by, go there. But I wouldn´t go there if I wasn´t in the neighbourhood so to speak.\n\nVaduz:\n\nHappy exploring!"
