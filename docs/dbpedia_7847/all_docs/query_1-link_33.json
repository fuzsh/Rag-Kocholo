        "text": "Vaduz Castle towers around 120 meters above the capital city of Vaduz. It is the landmark of Liechtenstein's capital and can be seen from afar.\n\nThe origins of the castle probably date back to the 12th century. The keep was probably one of the first buildings to be erected and was later supplemented by a residential tower. This residential tower can be dated to the year 1287. It was first mentioned in 1322.\n\nIt came into the possession of the House of Liechtenstein in 1712 and, under the name Hohenliechtenstein, served as the seat of the bailiwick with official apartments in the west wing until 1732. It then fell into increasing disrepair and was only thoroughly renovated and restored between 1905 and 1912.\n\nPrince Franz Josef II then had it extended and made habitable. In 1939, he moved in with his family and took up permanent residence.\n\nIt is not possible to visit the castle, but guided tours in Vaduz provide interesting insights into the history of the castle and the Princely House."
