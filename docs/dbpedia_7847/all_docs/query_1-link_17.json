It takes only an hour by car to reach the city of Zurich and its international airport. Business meetings in Munich and shopping trips in Milan are just a two-hour drive away.\n\nDespite its small size, Liechtenstein is a very attractive location in the heart of Europe on the banks of the Rhine between Switzerland and Austria. Excellent transport connections with both of these countries make it easy to get to Liechtenstein."
