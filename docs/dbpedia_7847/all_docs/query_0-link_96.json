        "text": "The Princely House of Liechtenstein is one of the oldest noble families of Europe. In 1938, Prince Franz Josef II (1906-1989) was the first Prince of Liechtenstein to move his permanent residence to Vaduz. On November 13th, 1989, following the death of Prince Franz Joseph II, his son Prince Hans-Adam II assumed the regency.\n\nOn August.15th, 2004, Prince Hans-Adam II entrusted Hereditary Prince Alois, in preparation for succession of the Throne, as his representative with the exercise of the princely rights appertaining to him. Thus, the Hereditary Prince has been performing the duties of Head of State of the Principality of Liechtenstein, both nationally and internationally.\n\nThe coat of arms of the Principality of Liechtenstein is also the national coat of arms. It can be used only by the members of the princely family and the public power. The different symbols and the combined emblems in the national coat of arms are references to the history of the Prince dynasty.\n\nCoat of Arms of the Princely House of Liechtenstein\n\nÂ© Government Spokesperson Office, Liechtenstein"
