        "text": "In its February/March 2019 issue, National Geographic Traveler featured Liechtenstein’s capital of Vaduz as a “Smart City” for its commitment to accessing clean energy. In 2018 Liechtenstein once again topped the list of per capita production of solar energy by the organization SolarSuperState.\n\nIn addition, the article highlights great places to eat, stay, play and shop and recommends visiting in 2019 – Liechtenstein 300th anniversary. We've also written about the many events taking place over the course of 2019 including a special travel package available to people in the United States!"
