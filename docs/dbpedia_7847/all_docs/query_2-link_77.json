It is home to the reigning prince of Liechtenstein and the Liechtenstein princely family. The city's distinctive architecture is also displayed in the landmarks of its historic district. Although Vaduz is internationally the best-known town in the principality, it is not the largest; the neighboring municipality of Schaan has a larger population.\n\t\n\tInformation from: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaduz\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaduz</a>",
