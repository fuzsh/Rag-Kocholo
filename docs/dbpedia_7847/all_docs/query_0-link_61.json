        "text": "Serving as the capital of Liechtenstein, Vaduz lies on the right bank of the Rhine River as its marks the border with Switzerland. Museums dedicated to history, art and culture cluster in its pedestrianised town centre, which is watched over by a hilltop castle home to the Princely Family of Liechtenstein.\n\nThings to do in Vaduz\n\nVisible from throughout the town is Vaduz Castle, which is the official residence of the Prince of Liechtenstein. It centres around a keep that dates back to the 12th century and is ringed by walls up to four metres thick. Dominating the town centre is the Cathedral of St. Florin, a High Gothic house of worship with a soaring spire.\n\nYou can learn about the people and events that have shaped the country at the Liechtenstein National Museum, which occupies a former tavern that dates back to 1438. Browse the cultural artefacts that are on display across its 40+ rooms, then get up close to postage stamps from as early as 1912 at the Postal Museum. Sleds of all shapes and sizes are exhibited at the FIS-Ski Museum.\n\nDon’t miss the Kunstmuseum Lichtenstein, which is housed within a striking building designed by a Swiss architectural firm. It houses changing displays of modern and contemporary works, as well as pieces from the princely-owned Liechtenstein Museum in Vienna. Paul Gauguin, Alberto Giacometti and Wassily Kandinsky are represented in the collection.\n\nGetting around Vaduz\n\nVaduz is around 1.5 hours' drive from Zürich and Zürich Airport, which has flights to destinations across the globe. Regular trains connect to the Schaan-Vaduz railway station, which is a five-minute ride by taxi from the town centre. Buses also serve Vaduz and the town can easily be explored on foot."
