Please see my full disclosure policy.\n\nVaduz Castle in Liechtenstein, known as “Schloss Vaduz” to locals, is the home and private residence of the reigning Prince of Liechtenstein. Yes, I said reigning Prince …\n\nYup, that’s right! The principality of Liechtenstein is a constitutional hereditary monarchy!\n\nAlthough Liechtenstein is, in part, largely run by a politically active monarch, it’s a unique type of monarchy. Their Constitution is based on both democratic and parliamentary principles in which the Prince and the people share authority of the state together.\n\nStill, the Prince is the Head of State of Liechtenstein and plays an important role in the legislation and governing of the country. And the Princely House of Liechtenstein dates wayyyyyy back. We’re talking 13th century. Since then, the family line has been uninterrupted.\n\nToday, Prince Hans-Adam II is the reigning Prince of Liechtenstein and the 15th reigning Prince overall. He grew up right here in Vaduz Castle, where he still lives with his wife, ­Countess Marie Kinsky of Wchinitz and Tettau, and their four children. Want to learn more about the Princely Family? Check out their website!\n\nPretty wild, huh?! ?\n\nAlright, well enough about the Prince, let’s get back to his big gorgeous castle up on the hill!\n\nVaduz Castle History\n\nAlthough you can’t visit the inside of Vaduz Castle, it’s still worth a trip to see it up close. The Castle is located high up on a hilltop, overlooking the length of the tiny country below, in the foreground of some pretty stunning backdrops.\n\nSchloss Vaduz has become the symbol of Liechtenstein’s capital city and even predates the principality itself by several centuries. Talk about history! The Castle is thought to have been first constructed for use as a fortress back in the 12th century, only later to have living quarters installed. In 1712 the Princely Family took ownership of the castle and it’s been in the family ever since.\n\nLocation of Vaduz Castle\n\nSchloss Vaduz\n\nSchlossstrasse\n\n9490 Vaduz\n\nLiechtenstein\n\n*No number needed, just type in “Schloss Vaduz” to GoogleMaps to find this Castle.\n\nHow to get up to Vaduz Castle\n\nThere are two different ways to get up close to Vaduz Castle, by foot or by car.\n\nHow to get there by Foot\n\nWalking up to Vaduz Castle takes around 20-30 minutes. From the main pedestrian street of Vaduz, there is a marked path that you can follow. It is pretty inclined, but anyone in decent physical shape should be able to do this.\n\nThis is my favorite way to get up to Vaduz Castle as the path is lined with historical information about Liechtenstein, the Royal Family and the Castle itself. There are also some pretty stunning panoramic views along the way!\n\nTo get started, take Vaduz’s main street, Städtle, until the corner of Beckagässli. You’ll see a restaurant called “Brasserie Burg” on the corner. From here, you’ll start your climb. At the first fork in the road stay right onto Haldenweg, and then simply follow the brown arrow signs for “Schloss” or “Castle.” The path is very easy to follow and clearly marked. You’ll end up taking “Schlossweg,” literally “Castle Path” until you see the big ol’ brick building right in front of you. Pretty straightforward ?\n\nHow to get there by Car\n\nIf you’re not in the mood to walk, or not able to, you can also arrive to Vaduz Castle by car. Unfortunately there is no public transport available that will bring you directly to the castle, nor are there taxis or apps like Uber readily available here in Liechtenstein. BUT, if you happened to drive, here are simple directions to get to the Castle from the center of Vaduz:\n\nFrom the main road, 28, you’ll want to turn onto Feldstrasse (you’ll see a “Schloss” sign) and continue on past the “Cellars of the Prince of Liechtenstein” vineyard.\n\nAfter about 250m turn right onto Fürst-Franz-Josef-Strasse and continue along this road a little over 1km until you see Vaduz Castle on your right. Continue on a bit past the castle, along the main road, first curving to the left and then the right. Here you’ll find a parking area to leave your car and walk down to the castle, as well as public bathrooms.\n\nYou can also enter: “Vaduz Castle Parking Area, Bergstrasse, Vaduz” into GoogleMaps or your GPS for guidance.\n\nThe trip by car to Vaduz Castle from the center of Vaduz takes around 5 minutes.\n\nHiking up to Vaduz Castle has become one of my favorite activities to do and work up a bit of a sweat while staying here in Liechtenstein. If you’re in the area, it’s definitely worth a trip!\n\nLiked this post? Sharing is caring! Pin it to save for later! ⬇️⬇️"
