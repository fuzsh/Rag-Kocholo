        "text": "Welcome to our website!\n\nAssembled over several centuries, the Collections of the Prince von und zu Liechtenstein are one of the most important private art collections in the world, holding around 1,600 paintings with masterpieces ranging from the early Renaissance to the second half of the nineteenth century, including works by Lukas Cranach the Elder, Quentin Massys, Raphael, Peter Paul Rubens, Anthony van Dyck, Frans Hals, Rembrandt, Rudolf von Alt, Ferdinand Georg Waldmüller, Friedrich von Amerling and Hans Makart.\n\nOf equal art-historical importance is the collection of Italian bronzes with its focus on masterpieces from the sixteenth to the eighteenth century. Besides these outstanding paintings and sculptures the Princely Collections also possess important holdings of drawings and engravings, pietra dura objects, enamels, ivories, decorative weapons, porcelain, tapestries and furniture that once graced the interiors of the family’s residences. A selection of these can be seen in the two Viennese palaces in the Rossau quarter and the centre of the city as part of a guided tour of the permanent exhibition. Many of these works of art can also be seen around the world in temporary exhibitions mounted by the Princely Collections or as individual loans to other institutions.\n\nThis website gives you access to information about the Princely Collections and their activities, the House of Liechtenstein and the palaces in family ownership. We invite you to learn about their history and background, the connections between them, to search for detailed information about the objects in the collection, and hope you enjoy examining the artworks up close via high-resolution images with zoom function or in selected cases via interactive 3D models – an ideal way to explore the Princely Collections."
