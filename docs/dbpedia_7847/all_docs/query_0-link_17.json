        "text": "Steal this itinerary: Vaduz, Liechtenstein\n\nVaduz, Liechtenstein, is a city that feels like a fairy tale sculpture garden.\n\nA castle sits on a hill overlooking surprises like unique architecture, interesting museums, cute cafes and stylish cocktail bars. There’s also a winery and a historic bridge crossing the Rhine River where you can stand with one foot in Switzerland and the other in Liechtenstein.\n\nVaduz is the capital of Liechtenstein, a tiny landlocked nation sandwiched between Switzerland and Austria. Liechtenstein is the sixth smallest country in the world and feels more like a small town than a sovereign nation. Its entire population is under 40,000, and its history dates back to just 1719.\n\nThis is a place where it’s not unusual to run into a prince or a former president. It’s a town you could visit on a day trip from Zurich, St. Gallen or Bad Ragaz, but you’ll want to pick your day strategically. Vaduz’s museums are closed on Mondays, and there aren’t many options for dinner on a Sunday night.\n\nI spent two nights in Vaduz, which was nice a break after a busy week traveling across Switzerland. It also meant I was in town by the time the local Indian restaurant opened for dinner on Saturday night and could spend my Sunday museum-hopping before heading to Zurich the following morning.\n\nHow to get to Liechtenstein\n\nFrom Zurich, take the train to Sargans, a town on the eastern edge of Switzerland. From there, catch the number 11 or 12E (express) bus that connects Sargans with Feldkirch, a town in western Austria, making several stops in Liechtenstein along the way. If you’ve got a Swiss or Austrian travel pass, you’ll be able to use it on this and other buses in Liechtenstein.\n\nThe bus ride from Sargans to Vaduz is about a half-hour. The express bus shaves off 10 to 15 minutes. The train ride from Zurich to Sargans is around one hour.\n\nWhat to do in Vaduz\n\nVaduz Castle is a royal residence that isn’t open to visitors. But there are plenty of other things to do in town. Check out the city’s historic cathedral, visit a winery or wander through any of its handful of museums. Check out a cute cafe, visit the local winery, have a cocktail or do a little shopping.\n\nI spent a full day museum-hopping, making stops at the Liechtenstein National Museum, Kunstmuseum, Postal Museum and the Treasure Chamber. These sites are within steps of each other, which makes it easy to museum-hop.\n\nProtip: Unless you’re visiting on a Wednesday when entry to the Kunstmuseum is free, pick up a Liechtenstein Adventure Pass for 25 CHF. It includes free admission to the Kunstmuseum (15 CHF), National Museum and Treasure Chamber (13 CHF), free wine tastings and discounts on bike and e-bike rentals as well as llama and alpaca tours. You can also redeem it for a free souvenir passport stamp.\n\nThe Liechtenstein museum is where I spent the most time, just over two hours. It offers a fascinating look into how Liechtenstein came to be and into the art and culture of the area. Other exhibits dove into climate change, soccer and Christmas decorations.\n\nThe Kunstmuseum was a lovely surprise. It’s a domineering piece of architecture feels but open the door and it feels like you’re walking into a cloud. This is a space that feels freeing, and its modern art collection is a nice surprise.\n\nThe Postal Museum was the most crowded of the museums I visited. This is a place that’s small but has a huge collection of stamps, including several historic local stamps. It’s also got a stamp maker on display, which is something I’ve never seen before.\n\nWhile you’re at the Postal Museum, ask for a coin to access the Treasure Chamber at the cashier’s desk. Head around the corner, and use the coin to unlock the automated Treasure Chamber door. The entrance feels like something out of a spy museum, but there isn’t a ton of treasure here. I spent about 15 minutes in the Treasure Chamber and had the place to myself.\n\nWhere to eat in Vaduz\n\nFor breakfast, lunch, coffee or a snack\n\nBalu Bakery is a cute spot for coffee, lunch or a snack. It’s also a great spot to pick up an Engadine nut cake to take home to friends and family. American Bagel is a good option for breakfast or lunch, and don’t let the name fool you. This is more cozy cafe than a New York bagel shop. I skipped the Seattle’s Best Coffee and had a delicious spinach and pine nut quiche.\n\nAmerican Bagel & Coffee Co: Staedtle 28, Vaduz, Liechtenstein\n\nBalu Bakery: Städtle 17, 9490 Vaduz, Liechtenstein\n\nFor dinner and drinks\n\nI had an excellent dinner at Schlossle Mahal, the only Indian restaurant in Liechtenstein. It was an Indian buffet with vegetarian and non-vegetarian options. It tasted and felt exactly like so many other Indian restaurants I’ve eaten at over the years. I started with the chana masala and poori, and it tasted like home.\n\nOn my second night in Vaduz, I had dinner at Bistro Residence Vaduz, an elegant restaurant that’s one of few places open on a Sunday evening. For drinks, I went to Altenbach Restaurant and Bar, which I loved. This place has a broad selection of liquors, a good cocktail list and a stylish vibe that would make it fit in even in the largest, most cosmopolitan cities.\n\nSchlossle Mahal: Fürst-Franz-Josef-Strasse 68, Vaduz, Liechtenstein\n\nBistro Residence Vaduz: Städtle 23, 9490 Vaduz, Liechtenstein\n\nAltenbach Restaurant & Bar: Städtle 3, 9490 Vaduz, Liechtenstein\n\nWhere to stay in Vaduz\n\nThere are a handful of hotels in Vaduz, but if you’re looking to earn rewards from your favorite international chain, you’re out of luck.\n\nI opted for the family-owned Hotel Vaduzerhof, an unfussy hotel steps from the city center with an automated check-in system. My room was pretty straightforward and sparsely decorated, but it had everything I needed and a terrace with a view. This is one of the more affordable hotels in Vaduz. It has a sauna, daily housekeeping and free breakfast. Prices start at around $150 a night.\n\nFor a cushier stay and more on-site services, opt for the Park Hotel Sonnenhof, a luxurious Relais & Chateau property with an onsite restaurant, gorgeous indoor pool spa and massage menu. The hotel has 29 rooms, and no two are the same. Prices here are around $450 a night.\n\nIf you go: Support this site by booking Hotel Vaduzerhof or the Park Hotel Sonnenhof through our partner links. While we may receive commissions from these bookings, this is an independent editorial review.\n\nThings to know about Liechtenstein\n\nLanguage: Swiss German, but everyone I came across also spoke English\n\nCurrency: Liechtenstein uses the Swiss Franc, CHF\n\nClosest airport: Zurich International Airport\n\nHow to get around: Vaduz is compact and walkable. There’s no ride-sharing, but there is a local bus.\n\nFYI: Museums are closed on Mondays. Many shops and restaurants are closed on Sundays."
