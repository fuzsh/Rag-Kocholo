        "text": "Explore a country that is the fourth smallest in Europe and one most people have never heard of.\n\nI have this strange quest to visit all the micro-nations of Europe, Vatican City, San Marino, Monaco, Malta, Andorra, and Liechtenstein. In February 2023, I only had two left, Liechtenstein and Andorra and now I only have one. I have no idea where this quest came from honestly. People from these countries when I meet them outside of Europe are so amazed that I even know about the country, and I have been there. I explain my quest and they usually approve of my weird hobby.\n\nLiechtenstein is smushed between Switzerland and Austria. It’s the fourth smallest country in Europe and sixth in the world. They use the Swiss Franc and have a interconnected transportation system with Switzerland.\n\nThe history of Liechtenstein is confusing to say the least. It wasn’t really a thing until 1719 when it became a principality of the Holy Roman Empire and named after an Austrian family. These princely rulers didn’t exactly visit very often. As a result of World War I and II, the country joined up with Switzerland and the princely family showed up a bit more. They couldn’t rule their former lands, which are now part of Poland, Czechia, Austria, and Slovenia.\n\nHow small is Liechtenstein? It’s 24 km (15 mi) long and 160 km² (62 mi²). Most of the villages and towns of Liechtenstein can be found in Upper Rhine River valley. The Alps tower above.\n\nThe capital of Vaduz is roughly midway down the country. It has a whopping less than 6,000 residents. It hosts the national assembly and most of the museums. Did I mention it was super tiny?\n\nAfter getting lunch and hitting the national museum, I took a bus south to Balzers to check out a castle.\n\nI wasn’t expecting much of Liechtenstein. I knew it was a small country and with mostly modern buildings. I enjoyed it though. The national museum was more than I expected and Balzers was really cute. I also didn’t go broke getting a sandwich and there were magnets at the tourist center. I didn’t have time to see any of the tiny settlements up in the mountains unfortunately. Apparently, they are much cuter. If you want something a little out of the ordinary, Liechtenstein is an interesting place to go. Maybe next time I will come in the summer so I can hike. It was a mud bath when I visited.\n\nCheck out my next update where I visit the tiny village of Werdenberg, Swtzerland!\n\nor\n\nStart at the beginning of this adventure in Zurich!"
