        "text": "The Government of the Principality of Liechtenstein, with its seat in Vaduz, is the highest executive body of the country, responsible both to Parliament and to the Reigning Prince. It is structured as a collegial Government, consisting of the Prime Minister and four Ministers. All five members of the Government are proposed by Parliament and appointed by the Reigning Prince. A legislative term lasts four years.\n\nFor the third time after 1987 and 2001, Liechtenstein holds the presidency of the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe for six months from 15 November 2023. This opens another significant chapter in the history of Liechtenstein's foreign policy."
