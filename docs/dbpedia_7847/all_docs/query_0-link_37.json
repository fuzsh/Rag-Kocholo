        "text": "When I learned that I had business appointments in Liechtenstein four days apart—on a Friday and the following Tuesday—I didn't know what to do with myself, so I decided to import my family from Vienna for company.\n\nAll month, my wife, Valerie, kept telling people she was “going to Luxembourg,” which I begged her not to tell the conductor—for Luxembourg and Liechtenstein are more than 200 miles apart and the former is 16 times the size of the latter.\n\nMonica, just turning 19, knew exactly where she was going and was remarkably enthusiastic for her age. It turned out she wanted “to meet the Prince of Liechtenstein,” at 71 the last reigning Hapsburg monarch in the world and possessor of its greatest private collection of art, conservatively valued at $300 million. Asked why, Monica said, “For personal reasons,” and clammed up.\n\nErika, 12 going on 13, took it as lightly as kids her age take everything until, when I left on- Thursday, I said: “See you Saturday morning in Vaduz.”\n\n“Vaduz?” she said. “What's Vaduz?”\n\n“The capital of Liechtenstein.”\n\n“I didn't know Liechtenstein had capital! I thought it was only one meter square.”\n\nThe principality of Liechtenstein is 61 square miles. Postage‐stamp sized isn't, though 10 percent of its income sterns from stamp sales. By the time my family arrived at breakfast time Saturday on the Wiener Walzer express from Vienna, 350 miles away, I had news for them: There was so much to do in Liechtenstein that they would be on the go from that moment until their Sundaynight return trip.\n\n•\n\nI had arrived Thursday night, kept my 9 A.M. Friday appointment, and had 22 hours to discover that Liechtenstein is land of high culture and higher mountains, a peaceful valley bounded by Austria, Switzerland and the Rhine River, with views of vineyards and villages and the sound of cowbells everywhere. There are no formalities between Switzerland and Liechtenstein. Under a 1923 customs union, Switzerland administers Liechtenstein's borders and diplomacy, and the principality's currency is the Swiss franc, though its postage stamps are its very own.\n\nThe weather favored us that weekend. Though the Fiihn—a sinister wind to which Central Eur.opeans attribute everything from suicide to stomach ulcers—was whistling through Liechtenstein, it hardly bothered us, and the rain that inevitably follows the FOhn held off until Monday.\n\nFrom May through October, an average of a thousand American tourists day pass through Liechtenstein in tour buses. They usually see just one street—the dozen miles that link Buchs, Switzerland, to Feldkirch, Austria, perhaps the least interesting street in Liechtenstein. If they're lucky, though, they stop in Vaduz for anywhere from 15 minutes to an hour and a half and meet one resident: the Baron Eduard von Falz-Feinalso known as the “Baron of Liechtenstein,” and “Mr. Quick;'—who turns out to be a 65-year-old Russian aristocrat with jet black hair.\n\nWandering between two world wars, he came to Liechtenstein with just a bicycle and a camera—and made himself a millionaire by photographing and promoting his adopted land. The ruling Prince took a liking to him; today, a couple of his Quick tourist offices guard the two one‐way streets, Stadtle and Aeulestrasse, that make up downtown Vaduz, while a third is on the main border crossing at Schaanwald on the Austrian frontier.\n\nBaron von Falz‐Fein sells souvenirs and stamps, picture books and postals, calculators and cameras and Swiss watches—and converts dollars at bank rates br slightly better. Gaunt and jaunty, noble and haggard, he climbs aboard as many as 30 tour buses a day to greet the travelers with a five‐minute spiel. Some excerpts:\n\n“Remember, we have in Europe two little principalities. One is already wellknown to you specially—Monaco—because you have there your own Princess who makes very nice advertising for the place. But Liechtenstein is so tiny that the printers of the map of Europe often forget to mention us as a separate country and never can afford to put us in a special color. Our religion is Roman Catholic. Our language is a German dialect so difficult that German tourists don't understand a word we're saying about them.\n\n“We are 24,000 people existing here for more than 250 years as an independent state in Europe. Our ruling prince is named Franz Josef II, Maria Aloys Alfred Karl Johannes Heinrich Michael Georg Ignatius Benediktus Gerhardus\n\n• Majella von Liechtenstein. He is nephew of Emperor Franz Joseph of Austria and he belongs to the Hapsburg family thanks to his mother, who was sister of the Archduke Franz Ferdinand who got killed in Sarajevo to start the First World War in 1914. The Prince is the 12th of our rulers, but the first one to live here full‐time. His ancestors used to live abroad in Vienna and come here for holidays—only 15 days a year—just to check if their country was still in the same place.”\n\n•\n\nIn addition to one‐day tourism, 6,855 Americans stayed a total of 9,562 hotel overnights in 1976. Berthold Konrad, the official director of tourism, is trying to improve this with the slogan: “LIECHTENSTEIN. Go TO it—not THROUGH it!”\n\nBut the best reason I know for staying a minimum of three nights is the Park Hotel Sonnenhof, where I lodged. A firstrate hotel nesting 15 minutes by foot above the capital, the Sonnenhof is informally but carefully run, rustically but elegantly decorated with pepper mills and painted chests. It offers such amenities as swimming pool and sauna, Pilsener beer and Pommery champagne in the room refrigerators, a little packet of Swiss chocolate on your pillow when the maid turns down your bedding, and a valet who'll shine your shoes if you leave them outside the door or even if you slip them off when sitting by the fireplace off the lobby.\n\nBoth my $35 single room and the $90 four‐bed apartment we used on Saturday night included Continental breakfasts enriched by a pork pate wrapped like a hot dog in the artificial sausage casing that is one of Liechtenstein's major industries.\n\nWhat makes the Sonnenholf is the cuisine of its owner, Emil Real, who moves around his hotel in high‐hatted cook's whites much of the time, as befits a Maxim's‐trained master chef. You can dine at the Sonnenhof only if you are a guest there or invited by one, which simplifies planning and bookkeeping for Mr. and Mrs. Real and causes normally hospitable Liechtensteiners to angle for invitations from their visitors. And if you stay a minimum of three days, you can have one of the four‐course main meals for only $8.70 additional a day, and the other for $6.50. For those who stay a shorter time, the same meal costs about $14.\n\nSuch are the wonders this man Real works with chicken that, substitutions being permitted, three of my six meals were built around this underrated bird: most notably, a hen spit‐broiled to perfection and served with French fries that were events in themselves.\n\nA • fish dish that made one want to stand up and salute was filets of Felchen, fresh from the nearby Bodensee (Lake Constance). And the green salads that accompanied every lunch or dinner were so exquisite, so leafy, that I will never, never again take lettuce for granted or leave a shred of it on my plate at Emil Real's, where it came lightly dressed in what is a family secret. Table d'hôte appetizers included such delicacies as smoked salmon, smoked trout, and grilled scampi.\n\nThe desserts ranged from Kaiserschmarren (Viennese pancakes) to a glass bowl bulging with newly‐picked raspberries. And the night they created cold Grand Marnier souffles for everybody's dessert, Emil Real peered out proudly from the kitchen.\n\nEmil Real is the kid brother of the better‐known Felix Real, also trained at Maxim's. Felix Real once cooked a legendary banquet for the Shah of Iran at Persepolis and his downtown Hotel Restaurant Real is known all over Central Europe. I deliberately settled for halfpension at Emil's so I would have the opportunity to visit Felix's as well as sample some country cooking elsewhere.\n\nWhen I did get down to the Hotel Real on Monday night, I was confronted by haute cuisine of the highest order. Brotherly comparisons could extend only as far as the mixed salad. Felix's greens were no better than Emil's, which is, a compliment to both. Mrs. Real recommended fish or game that night, so my guest, Baron von FalzFein, had filets of Felchen cooked in garlic, which he pronounced “magnifique, as ever,” and I had pepper steak of venison, rare, which I'm sure\n\nwould he cernnri to none even if T hors ever had the privilege of tasting it before.\n\nTo wrap up my meal, Mrs. Real recommended the house specialty, terrine de souffle glace, a dish of four home‐made desserts: chocolate mousse, coffee ice cream cake, raspberry and Grande Marnier ice creams, with cookieg alongside. It was so good that, as after the fresh raspberries up the hill, I went to bed that night without cleaning'my teeth—and no longer wondered why the world's second largest dentures factory is in Liechtenstein.\n\nThe Baron abstained from dessert and he doesn't touch alcohol, but, even so, this a la carte dinner for two cost me $37. (I had two glasses of white wine from Felix Real's own vineyards.)\n\n•\n\nBack on Saturday morning, when had met my family at the railroad station in Schaan, the town next to Vaduz, my elder daughter wanted to know: “When do we meet the Prince?”\n\n“At 11:15 this morning,” I had replied. On Friday, I had learned that the Prince would be giving a reception in his castle for the Swiss Foreign Press Association, which was convening that weekend in a mountaintop Tourotel in Gaflei.\n\nWaving my own press credentials had been enough to wangle four additions to the guest list of 100. Not every convention in Liechtenstein is so lucky as the journalists were. Only a handful of groups are granted audiences with His Serene Highness and they tend to be educators, members of parliaments and such special interests as 55 Liechtensteiners living in the United States and holding a reunion on their native sod.\n\nNevertheless, for incorrigible collectors of royalty, I was able to establish that the one sure time to catch the royal family—perhaps even dancing in the streets with all the rest of Liechtenstein—will be on the Sunday and Monday preceding Liechtenstein's National Day on Tuesday, Aug. 15, 1978: a long weekend holiday that will also .celebrate the Prince's 72d birthday and the 40th anniversary of his reign.\n\nThe 124‐room 13th‐century Castle of Liechtenstein—its red shutters lending a note of incongruous gaiety to an austere landmark that looks inaccessible from the city 360 feet below—is always closed to the public. But it was illuminated every night and visible from the Sonnenhof, where we had time for a bite and change of clothes that Saturday morning before making an easy 20minute hike across vineyards that put us into the castle's public parking lot when the three press buses arrived shortly before 11.\n\nOur group walked beneath stony towers, across a creaky wooden draw- bridge above a moat that was more of canyon, and up a winding cobbiestoned street lined with wrought iron that led us into the castle. With just enough time for us to peek at the frescoes in a chapel where the royal family goes to mass every morning at 7, we climbed a flight of stairs to a wood‐paneled reception room adorned with a sign in English;\n\nThough my daughters had practiced curtsying in our hotel room, we were greeted with assembly‐line handshakes by the Prince of Liechtenstein—an erect six‐footer with a light well‐trimmed mustache crowning the celebrated Hapsburg lip—and his third son, Prince Nikolaus Ferdinand, 30, who has an Aus-\n\ntrian law degree. Within five minutes, the reception line was disbanded and everybody moved next door into the television room, which had a Rembrandt self‐portrait and Quentin Massys portrait of a canon guarding one of the doors while Flemish tapestries hung loose from stone walls. A couple of waiters circulated unobtru- from the Prince”s Austrian vineyaids and freshly baked cheese sticks.\n\nFace-to-face with the monarch, Monica's reason for being in Liechtenstein turned out to be more philatelic than personal. As a stamp collector, she had a first‐day cover of a new series showing the Prince's four castles in Austria and now she asked him to autograph it. The Prince—who refuses to do this for Liechtensteiners for fear they”ll traffic in his signature—sat down on a thronelike armchair and obliged. Monica was offered $90 to $135 for the autographed cover—but she collects for love, not money, so all offers have been and will be refused.\n\n•\n\nTourists wishing to see some of the Prince's treasures will find three interesting museums situated virtually side by side along Vaduz”s main streetStadde numbers 37 to 43.\n\nThe top two floors of the Liechtenstein Art Gallery, which shares the entranceway of number 37 with the main tourist information office, are permanently reserved for loans from the Prince's collection of paintings. The gallery is open daily from 10 A.M. to noon and 1:30 to 5:30 P.M. From NoVember through March it is closed on Mondays and its afternoon hours begin 30 minutes later. Admission is $1.35; half for youths 10 to 15. For the next two or three years, one\n\nfloor will continue to feature Italian art from the 14th to 16th centuries, including a Tintoretto, a Raphael, and Andrea del Sarto's “St. John,” while the top level will go on housing more than two dozen • Rubenses, the summit of the Prince's collection. In the first room are Rubens’ portraits\n\nof a young girl (perhaps his daughter Child Serena) and his sons, the older one painted with what may be the face of his deceased mother. Then, in a living‐room setting, furnished with the Prince's own tables and chairs, hang much of Rubens’ gory cycle: “The History of the Roman Consul Publius Decius Mus.” Everybody in these paintings is left‐handed for they were painted as patterns for tapestry weavers who work with mirror images; one of the finished tapestries hangs in the front room with everybody right‐handed.\n\nAt the other, end of the same building is the Stamp Museum, which keeps much the same hours as the Art Gallery, but charges no admission. It is as compact as a stamp album, with thousands of stamps stored in vertical trays that slide out from yellow racks and are indexed by category, such as “World Rarities,” “Pre‐Philately Franking,” “Fairy Tales,” “Rubens Year” (1977 was the 400th anniversary of his birth; Liechtenstein honored the date with stamps designed from the Prince's collection).\n\nDown the block from the Stamp Museum on Stddtle, at number 43, is the National Museum. It houses regional archaeological finds dating back to 400 B.C., folk art, furniture, baroque statu-\n\nary, and, on the top floor, selections from the Prince's collection of arms and armor. The museum charges 90 cents—half for students—and keeps hours similar to the Art Gallery's.\n\n•\n\nOur Saturday noontime destination was Schellenberg,‐where the history of Liechtenstein as a, land really began in 1699. That was when Prince Johannes Adam Andreas, who acquired most of the Rubenses in the present collection, also bought himself the Lordship of Schellenberg, complete with 12th-century castle. Thirteen years later, he bought the Earldom of Vaduz—and, in 1719, when both these domains were joined, the Hapsburg Emperor Charles VI proclaimed the new country as\n\nLiechtenstein, an imperial principality.\n\n“Which Schellenberg do you want?” the bus driver asked us. “Vorderer Schellenburg? Mittlerer Schellenberg? Or Hinterer Schellenberg?”\n\nWe told him we were hungry, ,so he. delivered us to the middle of this village of 1,800 people, half an hour from Vaduz. We visited a truly lovely modern church, where everything soars—its windows are stained‐glass mosaic abstractions.\n\nAcross the square, we stepped gingerly over a sleeping St. Bernard dog in the doorway of the Hotel Krone's restaurant. Both the generosity and goodness of the Krone's venison steak in a sauce of grapes and wine (with red cabbage, chestnuts, and spatzle for $8) and a goulash called Hirschpfeffer, for half the price, left us gasping—particularly when the waitress served seconds at least as large as the firsts. Liechtenstein country cooking, we learned, is served in enormous portions, but you can order, for a slightly reduced price, teller service (no seconds).\n\nThen we walked off our banquet with a brisk 20‐minute climb to the towering rocky ruin of the original Castle of Schellenberg: a stone labyrinth flying the blue-and-red gold‐crowned flag of the principality. It was a ruin with view and, particularly with kids who still like to climb and play hide-andseek, I sometimes suspect that ruins can be more impressive than complete castles.\n\nContinuing past the ruin, we found ourselves in Hinterer Schellenberg and almost back in Austria. The border was a shingled gingerbread but manned by Swiss border guard dressed like a mountaineer, He was just going off for a bite, leaving the frontier unattended. We offered to watch it for him, but he said it wasn't necessary.\n\n• This particular border crossing (Liechtenstein has two other small ones plus the principal 24-hour-a-day crossing at Schaanwald) is closed from P.M. to 7 A.M. and, while pedestrians and cows can come and go freely, the road is barricaded to cars after hours.\n\nSo early suppers are demanded by Austrian visitors to Liechtenstein's oldest restaurant, the Lowen, overlooking the border. The Lowen was open for business even before the prinicipality was created in the early 18th century.\n\nNow it is a designated landmark that only recently reopened after a year of expensive repairs and restoration financed jointly by the principality and the Biedermann family, who own and run the inn.\n\nStill primitive, smoky and smelly, the Restaurant Lowell is where we were introduced to Sauerkase, the national cheese made from cow's milk, which looks and tastes as if it came from a goat or a sheep—but stinks like a whole barnyard. My wife and I enjoyed ours with bread and Sauser (very young red wine); the girls had their bread and cheese with Most (cloudy grape juice just before fermentation).\n\n•\n\nSunday morning, we took a bus that honked its way up a winding mountain road and through a tunnel. At the end of almost an hour's ride, we were in Malbun, a mile‐high ski resort (with slopes going up another quarter of a mile in altitude) only just being discovered by Americans. The ski season in Malbun runs from Christmas to Easter and the largest hotel, the Gorfion, already had some 250 Americans booked for the early weeks of 1978. But there are eight other hotels offering ski week packages, including all meals and lifts, starting at $140.\n\nWhile my family shopped for souvenirs in Malbun, I treated myself to $1.30 round trip on a chairlift that took me up over chalets and then mountain vegetation and into a face-to-face confrontation with a bland‐looking cliff of white sand (treacherous when wet) before discharging me at a peak where, just above a self‐service restaurant, could again set one foot into Austria.\n\nIf you want to sit in three countries at the same time, you have to start lower, in the cross‐country ski resort of Steg, almost 1,000 feet and an hour's hike below Malbun. Using mountain boots, climb to the Naafkopf peak (8,200 feet) where Liechtenstein, Switzerland and Austria converge. Instead, my family made an hour-and-a-quarter Sunday morning hike, mostly downhill, from Malbun to Steg and then the pastoral hamlet of Sukka, where we took tea at• the cozy Berggasthof of the SchadlerBeck family. Farmers in overalls were washing their hands in an outdoor trough before settling in for their kaffee fertig or jagertee (coffee or tea laced with the local apple and pear schnaps). Then we caught a midday bus back to Vaduz for the only disappointment of our weekend in Liechtenstein: a soggy salad buffet for $2.90 each, around a 17th‐century wine press at the Torkel Restaurant within the Prince's own\n\nAt that time of year all over Liechtenstein, the purple grapes, ripe for harvesting, were wrapped in mesh and cellophane to keep the birds away. Some farmers had also set up scarecrows and mechanical firecracker machines, but only in the Prince's vineyards was there a man firing a shotgun into the air at irregular intervals.\n\nThis and the arrival of a deluxe German tour bus didn't help the atmosphere at Torkel, where even the buffet service was nervous. And the red wine (Beerli) and rosé (Stissdruck), though Liechtenstein specialties and quite good, didn't compare with their counterparts from Emil Real's vineyard. A fifth-of-a-liter glass, of wine cost $1.70 at Torkel. For $3.50 you could buy a whole liter at the ‘ nearby royal Hofkeller—and drink free samples first.\n\nAfter a quick round of the museums in Vaduz and a grand farewell dinner at the Sonnenhof, I took my family to the station in Schaan—and both our daughters wanted to know when we'd all come\n\nback to see more of Liechtenstein. ■"
