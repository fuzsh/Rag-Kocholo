Production[]

For the first two seasons, the animation was in 2D, otherwise known as traditional or hand-drawn animation. Traditional animation is a technique in which a person draws a frame by hand to create animation (although, in some cases, it is drawn on a computer). In the third and final season, the animation is changed to 3D, or CGI. CGI is another technique in which a person creates a frame using computers to make it look three-dimensional.

The character of Tsukishima Kirari is voiced by a real-life idol: Kusumi Koharu of Morning Musume, who also performs the series' songs under the heroine's name, releasing multiple singles and albums as Tsukishima Kirari starring Kusumi Koharu (Morning Musume), which serve as the anime's theme songs.

The series' bands, MilkyWay, Kira☆Pika, and SHIPS, are also adapted as real bands. Every member of each group voices their own character. MilkyWay and Kira☆Pika was voiced by Hello! Project idols: Hagiwara Mai of ℃-ute, Kitahara Sayaka and Kikkawa You. SHIPS was voiced by Ide Takuya and Kanai Shikou. They also play their characters in shows, concerts and TV programs.
