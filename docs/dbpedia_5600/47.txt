Canceled project[]

Sometime in November 2015, there was a attempt to reboot Kirarin Revolution by Aniplex in association with Gonzo and the Japanese branch of The Aoi Iro Team, but it was canceled quickly due to low ratings. The pilot episode has been partially recovered as of 2023.

The character designer of this project was Honami Koyasu (子安 穂波, pictured).

The plot of this project was going to be "Kirari is now adult (18 years) instead of teenager (14 years). Her father told her to get a job since her idol job ended after 6 years."

International broadcast[]

The series was premiered for the first time in the rest of Europe on Kata TV on March 31, 2018 after the channel rebranding at 6:00 EEST. Two weeks later, TvNimerise Anime premiered as well to expand Anierican audiences.

The series was premiered regionally in the United States on October 24, 2022 when Ignition Two replaced its former season Kilari at the Next Stage/Kirarin Revolution Stage 3 (きらりん☆レボリューションSTAGE3).
