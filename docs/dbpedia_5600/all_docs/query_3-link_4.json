Traditional animation is a technique in which a person draws a frame by hand to create animation (although, in some cases, it is drawn on a computer). In the third and final season, the animation is changed to 3D, or CGI. CGI is another technique in which a person creates a frame using computers to make it look three-dimensional.\n\nThe character of Tsukishima Kirari is voiced by a real-life idol: Kusumi Koharu of Morning Musume, who also performs the series' songs under the heroine's name, releasing multiple singles and albums as Tsukishima Kirari starring Kusumi Koharu (Morning Musume), which serve as the anime's theme songs.\n\nThe series' bands, MilkyWay, Kira☆Pika, and SHIPS, are also adapted as real bands. Every member of each group voices their own character. MilkyWay and Kira☆Pika was voiced by Hello! Project idols: Hagiwara Mai of ℃-ute, Kitahara Sayaka and Kikkawa You. SHIPS was voiced by Ide Takuya and Kanai Shikou. They also play their characters in shows, concerts and TV programs.\n\nProduction Staff[]\n\nDirector: Masaharu Okuwaki (season 1 and 2), Yoshitaka Fujimoto (season 3)\n\nSeries Composition: Michihiro Tsuchiya\n\nScript: Michihiro Tsuchiya\n\nStoryboard: Masaharu Okuwaki\n\nEpisode Director: Yoshinori Odaka\n\nMusic: Bice\n\nOriginal Manga: An Nakahara\n\nCharacter Design: Yoshihiro Nagamori\n\nAnimation Director: Hiroshi Wagatsuma\n\nSound Director: Shigeru Chiba\n\nPhotographer Director: Eun Hee Kim\n\nProducers: Hiroshi Tsuzuki, Yasuyuki Uchida, Yukio Kawasaki and Yutaka Saito\n\nAnimation Producers: DU YEOL JUNG and Yasuhiro Higuchi\n\nBackground Art: SUN GEUN HAN\n\nEditor: Hiromi Komine\n\nPlanning: Nobumasa Sawabe and Toshihiro Nakazawa\n\nPublicity: Kenji Takahashi and Machiko Ishii\n\nTheme Song Arrangers: Masaki Iehara, Yasuji Goto and Yoichiro Yasuoka\n\nTheme Song Composition: Tetsuro Oda and Tsunku\n\nTheme Song Lyric Writers: Makoto Furuya, Michito and Tsunku\n\nTheme Song Performers: Tsukishima Kirari starring Kusumi Koharu (Morning Musume), ℃-ute, Kira☆Pika and MilkyWay\n\nCast[]\n\nMain Characters[]\n\nKusumi Koharu as Tsukishima Kirari\n\nSuyama Akio (ep 1-102) and Ide Takuya (ep 103-153) as Kazama Hiroto\n\nHoshi Souichiro (ep 1-102) and Kanai Shikou (ep 103-153) as Hiwatari Seiji\n\nIkeda Chigusa as Na-san\n\nSupporting Characters[]\n\nMitsui Aika as Gurossan\n\nMiyake Kaya as Sayaka\n\nSakaguchi Koichi as TanTan\n\nItou Kumiko as Miku\n\nJoh Masako as Ogura Erina\n\nNozawa Masako as Obaa-chan\n\nNeya Michiko as Kumoi Kasumi\n\nKouzuki Miwa as Na-yan\n\nChiba Susumu as Producer Muranishi\n\nKawakami Takafumi as Amamiya Arashi\n\nTsunematsu Ayumi as Tina Garland\n\nAsakura Azumi as Tomo\n\nSaito Chiwa as Kirisawa Aoi\n\nYamawaki Chomenori as Tsukishima Takashi\n\nMochizuki Hisayo as Mya-san\n\nIzaki Hisayoshi as Manager Shakujii\n\nYoshizawa Hitomi as Hitomi\n\nSakata Ito as Girl\n\nTakiguchi Junpei as Mr. Dancho\n\nKosugi Juurouta as Tanba Suzutarou\n\nHagiwara Mai as Mizuki Hikaru\n\nKatsuki Masako as Mizora Seiko\n\nShinkawa Megumi as Mr. Na\n\nKumai Motoko as Higuchi Yasuhiro\n\nMatsui Naoko as Chairwoman Higashiyama\n\nShitaya Noriko as Todou Fubuki and Mii-tyan\n\n​Kitahara Sayaka as Yukino Noel\n\nKikkawa Yuu as Hanasaki Cobeni\n\nAsanuma Shintaro as Tsukishima Subaru\n\nAono Takeshi as Crossing over house steward\n\nOhta Tetsuharu as Kamata Tomo\n\nKakihara Tetsuya as Nii-kun\n\nTakagi Wataru as Scoop Gotou\n\nSasamoto Yuku as Haruno Tsurara\n\nNishikawa Hazuki (un-credited)\n\nMerchandise[]\n\nTo see all the merchandise, check the dedicated article.\n\nDVD[]\n\nSeason 1[]\n\nVolume Number Publish Date STAGE 1 September 08, 2006 Contains episodes 01-04 STAGE 2 October 06, 2006 Contains episodes 05-08 STAGE 3 November 10, 2006 Contains episodes 09-12 STAGE 4 December 08, 2006 Contains episodes 13-16 STAGE 5 January 12, 2007 Contains episodes 17-20 STAGE 6 February 09, 2007 Contains episodes 21-24 STAGE 7 March 09, 2007 Contains episodes 25-28 STAGE 8 April 04, 2007 Contains episodes 29-32 STAGE 9 May 10, 2007 Contains episodes 33-36 STAGE 10 June 08, 2007 Contains episodes 37-40 STAGE 11 July 06, 2007 Contains episodes 41-44 STAGE 12 August 10, 2007 Contains episodes 45-48 STAGE 13 September 07, 2007 Contains episodes 49-51\n\nSeason 2[]\n\nVolume Number Publish Date STAGE 1 October 03, 2007 Contains episodes 52-55 STAGE 2 November 09, 2007 Contains episodes 56-59 STAGE 3 December 07, 2007 Contains episodes 60-63 STAGE 4 January 11, 2008 Contains episodes 64-67 STAGE 5 February 08, 2008 Contains episodes 68-71 STAGE 6 March 07, 2008 Contains episodes 72-75 STAGE 7 April 02, 2008 Contains episodes 76-79 STAGE 8 May 09, 2008 Contains episodes 80-83 STAGE 9 June 06, 2008 Contains episodes 84-87 STAGE 10 July 09, 2008 Contains episodes 88-91 STAGE 11 August 08, 2008 Contains episodes 92-95 STAGE 12 September 10, 2008 Contains episodes 96-99 STAGE 13 October 03, 2008 Contains episodes 99-102\n\nSeason 3[]\n\nVolume Number Publish Date STAGE 1 November 7, 2008 Contains episodes 103-106 STAGE 2 December 10, 2008 Contains episodes 107-110 STAGE 3 January 7, 2009 Contains episodes 111-114 STAGE 4 February 6, 2009 Contains episodes 115-118 STAGE 5 March 6, 2009 Contains episodes 119-122 STAGE 6 April 3, 2009 Contains episodes 123-126 STAGE 7 May 8, 2009 Contains episodes 127-130 STAGE 8 June 10, 2009 Contains episodes 131-134 STAGE 9 July 8, 2009 Contains episodes 135-138 STAGE 10 August 5, 2009 Contains episodes 139-142 STAGE 11 September 9, 2009 Contains episodes 143-146 STAGE 12 October 2, 2009 Contains episodes 147-150 STAGE 13 November 6, 2009 Contains episodes 151-153"
