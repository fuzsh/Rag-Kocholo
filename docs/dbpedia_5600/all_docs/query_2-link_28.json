        "text": "This telegraph arrived in Japan in 1854. The device was first demonstrated in front of Dutch scholars by Commodore Matthew C. Perry, leader of the Perry Expedition (a diplomatic and military mission to Japan that led to the country ending its long period of isolation). Following the demonstration, the telegraph was presented to the Japanese Shogunate. That same year, the Shogunate also received a telegraph from the Netherlands, and Count Katsu Kaishu was the first person in Japan to attempt communication using these devices. During the Tokugawa Period (1603-1868), research did not progress to a significant extent, but the Meiji Restoration government placed importance on the telegraph. In 1869, British telegraph engineers were invited to Japan, and Japan's first telegraph circuits were opened at the Yokohama Lighthouse Government Office and Yokohama Courthouse. This was the beginning of the telegraph's establishment in Japan.\n\nPhotograph: PPA/Aflo\n\nThe Morse Telegraph\n\nThis telegraph used the dot-dot-dash Morse code. In Japan, which was just discovering the telegraph as the country began Westernizing, the first telegraphs built (in1869) were Breguet-style dial telegraphs. Since there was no need to remember characters or symbols, dial telegraphs could be used by anyone. Another reason why Japan adopted the dial telegraph was that it cost less than the communication-line Morse telegraph to construct.\n\nPhotograph: NTT\n\nThis telegraph used the dot-dot-dash Morse code.

At this time, Japan was still undergoing post-war recovery and was lagging behind in technology since its equipment had been ruined.\n\nThe Corporation conducted a wide range of efforts to achieve a telephone service that connects instantly, in light of public demand.\n\nIn 1849, Sakuma Shozan, a samurai from the Matsushiro domain in Shinshu (current-day Nagano Prefecture), constructed Japan's first telegraph using Western books for reference. Five years later, when Perry revisited Japan, the Japanese Shogunate was presented with telegraph sets. From this point onwards, Japan's telegraph and telephone history began in earnest and developed at an astonishing rate. Until the middle of the 20th century, development progressed through a fusion of developed-country technology and technology developed independently in Japan, and the prototype for the familiar rotary dial telephone had already been born by 1933.\n\nSubsequently, functionality and design were enhanced using independent technology exceeding world standards, and by 1939 the number of subscriber telephones nationwide had reached 1 million. Around World War II, the number of telephone subscribers dropped to around 540,000, but the postwar period saw accelerated technological innovation once again, and landline telephones spread.\n\nThe No. 23 Automatic Wall Telephone was born in 1953. Although enabling users to call and talk with others simply by turning the dial, without having to go through an operator, conventional automatic telephones had poor transmission characteristics; however, quality was dramatically improved with the No. 23 model.\n\nThat same year, mechanization of the telegraph relaying process was realized (at the Mito Telegraph Office) for the first time in Japan, and red-colored public telephones were introduced. These red telephones were installed at 15 locations, including kiosks on the Yokosuka Line platforms and the Yaesu Entrance/Exit of Tokyo Station, their vivid color making their presence known to many people. The year 1953 was also the year in which NHK, NTV, and other television broadcasting services began. With the Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Public Corporation (now NTT) launched the previous year under the motto of \"field-orientated services,\" expanding telegraph and telephone services with private-sector funding became possible. The 1950s were truly an era in which huge leaps forward were achieved in the telecommunications and wireless telegraphy fields.\n\nPhotograph: exhibit at the NTT History Center of Technologies\n\nDelville magnetic wall telephones\n\nAutomatic wall telephones that did not require calls to be connected by an operator first appeared in Japan in 1926 during the reconstruction following the Great Kanto Earthquake, at the Kyobashi Office in Tokyo. However, transmission characteristics were poor and parts were old, and so there was a major upgrading of transmitters and circuits in 1953. From around 1959, these telephones were gradually eased out of service. The photograph shows a person speaking on a Delville magnetic wall telephone, which was introduced in 1896.\n\nPhotograph: NTT\n\nAutomatic wall telephones that did not require calls to be connected by an operator first appeared in Japan in 1926 during the reconstruction following the Great Kanto Earthquake, at the Kyobashi Office in Tokyo.

Gaining popularity in many households as so-called \"kurodenwa (black telephone)\" because of its excellent communication functionality, this model became the most common communication tool in those days.\n\nIntroduced in 1962, the 600 model automatic table telephone was said to be the perfect telephone in terms of transmission performance and cost.

The research on pocket bell (buzzer) (=wireless call service) began to meet the need to send the minimum information required to individual people, such as people working away from their office or car (since car phones already existed).\n\nOut of this research, \"pagers\" (\"pocket bell\" beepers) that notified people out of the home or office that someone wished to contact them wirelessly using just a push of the dial were born in the United States in 1958. The service was named the \"Bellboy Service\" after hotel bellhops. Four years later, \"pocket bell\" contractors were established in Japan, and pager services began in the 23 wards of Tokyo. Use of these devices spread mainly among sales representatives, who spent a large amount of time out of the office, and were also favored by young people. At its peak, the service had more than 6 million subscribers. Later, needs for this service diminished with the spread of mobile telephones, and it was suspended in 2007.\n\nPhotograph: exhibit at the NTT History Center of Technologies\n\nLater Pocket Bell (beeper)\n\nBorn in 1968, the original pocket bell (beeper) devices were an extremely useful communication tool of contacting salespeople who were out of the office, and their use diffused widely. Eventually, these devices also developed a role as a communication tool as young people used them for word play with numbers, and they are the basis for various mobile communication tools.\n\nPhotograph: exhibit at the NTT History Center of Technologies\n\nBorn in 1968, the original pocket bell (beeper) devices were an extremely useful communication tool of contacting salespeople who were out of the office, and their use diffused widely.

The new company became known as \"NTT.\" The Public Telecommunications Act was revised and renamed the Telecommunications Business Act, liberalizing participation in the telecommunications business.\n\nIn the following year, the 1.95 million NTT shares owned by the Japanese Government were sold; services such as the \"Pressed Flower Telegram Service,\" airplane public telephone service, message dial services, and reduced telephone call rates on Saturdays were introduced as customer-orientated business initiatives were enthusiastically developed and expanded.\n\nAfter privatization, the following companies were founded: NTT DATA CORPORATION (1988), NTT DOCOMO, INC (1991), NTT FACILITIES, INC. (1992), and NTT COMWARE CORPORATION (1997).\n\nPortable shoulder telephone (101 model)\n\nFirst-generation shoulder telephones (100 model) weighed a heavy 3 kg. They were portable/car telephones to be used when away from your vehicle. Launched in 1988, the 101 model portable telephone was to be used as a portable phone only. The telephone's portability was groundbreaking, but they weighed 2.5 kg. They were simply an extension of the car phone.\n\nPhotograph: exhibit at the NTT History Center of Technologies\n\nFirst-generation shoulder telephones (100 model) weighed a heavy 3 kg.

This was also the starting point for the intense race for technological innovation with rivals companies that flocked to the mobile telephone market one after the other.\n\nThe year 1991 saw the birth of \"mova\", a mobile telephone designed to be the \"world's smallest and lightest mobile telephone.\" The huge success of this mobile telephone revolutionized the image of mobile telephones as \"status symbols of the wealthy\", transforming them into \"indispensable communication tools\" for many, many people.\n\nIn 1992, NTT's mobile communications business was spun off into a new company, NTT Mobile Communications Network, Inc. As the times anticipated the \"era of every person having a mobile terminal\" that would eventually come, the mobile communications market was explosively invigorated.\n\nThe PHS (Personal Handy-phone System) debuted in 1995. Providing inexpensive call rates and using a digital system, these devices became widely accepted as \"mobile public telephones\" capable of responding to the multimedia era of the future.\n\nComing ten years after the company's privatization in 1985, this period was truly an \"era of innovation and leaps forward\" for NTT. However, even during this period, NTT was steadily making preparations for the \"next generation\" that was soon to arrive.\n\nPhotograph: NTT\n\nTZ-802 model\n\nThe TZ-802 model shown in the photograph weighed approx. 900 g--hardly lightweight by today's standards, but it created the trigger for the concept of mobile telephones to be born. In this year, the number of people with mobile telephone contracts exceeded 100,000 for the first time.\n\nPhotograph: exhibit at the NTT History Center of Technologies\n\nThe TZ-802 model shown in the photograph weighed approx. 900 g--hardly lightweight by today's standards, but it created the trigger for the concept of mobile telephones to be born.

In contrast to connecting to the Internet from a computer--which required many steps, including setting-up circuits and modems and concluding contracts with providers--, with i-mode, you could simply access the Internet directly from your mobile telephone, and so the service spread like wildfire. The number of service users was 1 million after six months and grew to some 10 million users in just one year. Not only was the service easy to operate, but also the contents were listed by category in alphabetical order so that users could find the information they wanted at a glance, making the service very easy and convenient to use. Thus i-mode created an opportunity for broadening the Internet base.\n\nBehind the success of this service lay continuous technological evolution, such as the expansion and enhancement of mobile terminal functions, improvement of data communication speed, and reduction of packet communication charges. When the service was initially introduced, terminal screens were black-and-white, but by December of the same year Docomo was using color liquid-crystal screens for the first time, after which advances were made in terms of enhancing high definition and increasing screen size. Furthermore, diverse advances are now the driving force supporting mobile telephone culture. These include the \"Deco-mail\" service, which enables the use of templates and images in e-mails whereas previously only emoji (pictographs) could be used (introduced in 2004); and the \"i-channel\" service, which automatically displays news, weather, entertainment news, fortune-telling, and other information on the standby screen (introduced in 2005).\n\nPhotograph: exhibit at the NTT History Center of Technologies\n\n1999\n\nTransition to a holding company structure\n\nNTT Group transitioned to a holding company structure, founding NTT EAST, NTT WEST, and NTT COMMUNICATIONS.\n\nmova 501i series\n\nOn February 22, 1999, the mova 501i was the only i-mode service-compliant terminal device. The i-menu contained 68 sites, with content focused on news and weather. The next year saw the launch of i-app, followed by i-motion, flash functions, chaku-motion, chaku-uta (truetone ringtones), and other services one after the other.\n\nPhotograph: Reuters/Aflo\n\n>On February 22, 1999, the mova 501i was the only i-mode service-compliant terminal device.

GI fiber cables were introduced for suburban broadcasting services (commercial testing) in 1981, and a trans-Pacific submarine cable system was completed in 1989. In this way, by undertaking the diffusion of high-speed/high-volume optical communications systems such as optical fiber systems, NTT has consistently been a leader in the evolution of the optical fiber industry.\n\nThese efforts took shape in a big way in 2001. In that year, NTT East Japan and NTT West Japan introduced FTTH (Fiber To The Home)--a communications system for general households that uses optical fibers--in the form of B FLET'S. Subsequently, with the rapid diffusion of the Internet and commencement of video screening services, demand for FTTH (which boasts incredibly fast transmission speeds) increased at an accelerated pace.\n\nGoing back two years, NTT DOCOMO launched the \"i-mode\" service in February 1999. This made it possible to use online services that previously had only been available to personal computer users using just a mobile telephone, thereby making e-mail, ticket reservations, restaurant and \"yellow pages\" searches, and other convenient services for everyday living easily available for people to use anywhere, anytime. These i-mode services were widely embraced, mainly by younger age groups, generating a record number of service subscribers of some 5.6 million in the year between their introduction and the end of March 2000 and creating a new form of communication.\n\nPhotograph: Corbis/Aflo\n\nB FLET'S\n\nUsing optical fiber services provided experimentally from the previous year, provision of fixed price services offering high speed Internet access began in earnest on August 1, 2001 (initial monthly fee: 9,000 yen/100 M maximum). In the approx. four years since commencement of this service, NTT East and West have collectively concluded more than 2 million user contracts.\n\nUsing optical fiber services provided experimentally from the previous year, provision of fixed price services offering high speed Internet access began in earnest on August 1, 2001 (initial monthly fee: 9,000 yen/100 M maximum).

NTT believes that realizing a paraconsistent society, in which these opposing concepts and phenomenon are included and diverse values are accepted, will contribute to the realization of sustainable society. To help realize this harmonious society, the NTT Group has developed our Sustainability Charter based on the concept of moving towards \"Self as We.\" In other words, moving from standalone individuals or isolated groups and towards diverse cultures and communities that are highly connected. This approach is based on enabling our connection to all things, including other people, goods, nature, and technology. The NTT Group will promote corporate and economic growth and, at the same time, will contribute to resolving social issues to realize a sustainable society.\n\nBased on the fundamental principle \"Innovating a Sustainable Future for People and Planet,\" we plan to invest a total of approximately 8 trillion yen in new growth sectors over the next 5 years. We will also strengthen our cash generation capabilities and grow annual EBITDA to approximately 4 trillion yen by fiscal year 2027, which is a 20% increase over fiscal year 2022.\n\nThe new medium-term management strategy has three main pillars.\n\nThe first pillar is \"NTT as a Creator of New Value and Accelerator of a Global Sustainable Society\" and to that end we will pursue the following initiatives:\n\nIOWN-Driven Creation of New Value\n\nData-Driven Creation of New Value\n\nAchievement of a Circular Economy Society\n\nFurther Strengthening of Business Foundations\n\nTo support this, we will continue \"Upgrading the Customer Experience (CX)\" as the second pillar and \"Improving the Employee Experience (EX)\" as the third pillar."
