        "text": "Similar to the time when All Star Selection got announced, the article on ANN is pretty complete, but it’s still missing little bits of info I read on other Japanese news site, like Animate. So you should read the ANN article BEFORE reading this. I’m not gonna repeat stuff they already said. (Unless if by the time I finish typing this, they edit their article and add the things they missed). I’m also including some news I read on Twitter. Sorry if the post is a bit confusing, I’m not a very good writer or journalist. Just read it twice if you don’t understand something.\n\nEDIT after All Star Selection started: Yeah I was so optimistic when I wrote this post hahaha. All Star Selection turned out to be just reairs with SD segments at the beginning & end. Really disappointing.\n\nTakara Tommy revealed the new arcade game machine for Puri Para and announced the anime today, 13/03/2014 at an event. These I pics I found from various sources. those from Animate have the Animate logo on them.\n\n1st pic is a promotional picture for Pretty Rhythm All Star Selection.\n\n2nd pic was released to announce they’ll update the 3DS game with the All Star Selection costumes.\n\nI think I finally get the point of All Star Selection now. With Puri Para, Takara Tommy is starting a new series, the successor of the Pretty Rhythm series. Instead of immediately doing Puri Para, Takara Tommy thought about bringing back together all the characters one last time as a homage. Lala isn’t the heroine of All Star Selection, but is the heroine of Puri Para. They thought that since they’re doing this, they might as well bring her in All Star Selection as well.\n\nTakara Tommy even said about Pretty Rhythm All Star Selection that it’s about “The heroine of Puri Para, Lala, taking lessons from her senpais before her debut and the start of her show this summer”.\n\nPuri Para will air on Saturdays from 10:00 AM to 10:30 AM on TV Tokyo, taking the time slot of Pretty Rhythm All Star Selection, the same time slot which has been holding Pretty Rhythm for three years. As Pretty Rhythm All Star Selection starts the 5th of April, and that Puri Para starts the 5th of July, this confirms that Pretty Rhythm All Star Selection will only be 13 episodes.\n\n13 episodes + the movie is more than enough for a homage I guess. One thing worrying me now since it’s only 13 episodes, is the fact that they can do a lot of rewind after all. Sigh. I hope it won’t be too much.\n\nThe promo picture and the 3DS game update suggests that we will see these pairings in the show and I really hope they happen. That would mean we will see cross character interaction. I guess they won’t do a crazy story in All Star Selection but if they can show all the characters laughing together and stuff I’d be really happy. We’d get galaxy level and dimension breaking jumps all the time too. The pairings are pretty meaningful:\n\nAira and Naru are the heroines of their respective seasons and are both dojikkos. They’re both clumsy but with hidden super talent heroine types. Naru is very similar to Aira.\n\nRizumu and Ito are powered by love types, they’re the first to have a boyfriend in their respective seasons.\n\nHye In and Ann are super hard working/training girl types.\n\nJuné and Mion are the BEST GIRLS EVER in their respective seasons (This is a totally legit reason, I totally didn’t make it up from my tastes)\n\nThey both are the current Prism Queen at the start of their respective seasons and all the other characters admire them. Aira is a huge Mion fan and Naru is a huge Juné fan.\n\nThey both lived an unrequited love. Hijiri for Juné and Jun for Mion.\n\nCan’t think of anything for Rinne and Mia. Rinne does Kirameki Future Star like Mia so they paired them up I guess. Or you could say they are the two most obnoxious and crazy. I mean, if I was a kid browsing /a/ I’d call them the autism duo. Trio if they’d include Kaname. I love Mia and Rinne so it’s cool.\n\nPics from a CM for the All Star Selection version of the arcade game. It first aired during Rainbow Live episode 45’s CM break.\n\nI’m also scared and wondering if the other girls not featured in the promo pictures will appear or not. This CM says there will be every girl including Cosmo in the All Star Selection version of the arcade game, so I hope the anime will do the same. But anyway, there’s no use worrying about it now. We’ll be certain of it when the show starts airing.\n\nIn other news, Otobe Yoshihiro, the CG director twitted that “There’s only two weeks left until his three year long work on Pretty Rhythm ends”. Meaning he won’t be working on Puri Para? Puri Para doesn’t start until July though, so why did he say that? I guess he means that even though All Star Selection will have stuff he worked on, he didn’t do anything on it? I have no idea. We won’t know until it airs. From what I read about the movie they didn’t redo the AD and DMF Prism Shows with the CG quality of RL so I don’t think they’ll do it for All Star Selection either…\n\nThey announced some of the staff both for Pretty Rhythm All Star Selection and Puri Para:\n\nPretty Rhythm All Star Selection\n\nAnimation Studio: Tatsunoko & Dongwoo Ａ＆Ｅ\n\nDirector: Hishida Masakazu\n\nScreenplay: Akao Deko\n\nPuri Para\n\nAnimation Studio: Tatsunoko & Dongwoo Ａ＆Ｅ\n\nDirector: Moriwaki Makoto\n\nSeries Composition: Tsuchiya Michihiro\n\nCharacter Design: Hara Shoji\n\nThe Pretty Rhythm All Star Selection main staff is the same people as always. Puri Para has new staff. I know I said multiple times that Director said “he won’t be participating in the next Pretty Rhythm”, but I guess when he said “the next Pretty Rhythm” he meant Puri Para. Btw about that, since he deleted his old tweets some time ago, I can’t prove it anymore, so you’ll have to trust my word if it’s the first time you’re reading this blog.\n\nSpeaking of Hishida Masakazu/the director, he tweeted that Puri Para is inheriting the genes of Pretty Rhythm. And he’s happy to finally pass the baton. He was getting burned out. He was super happy and said quite a lot of Gundam related jokes, like “Laala could’ve been my mother!!!” Laughed so much when I read that.\n\nHe also said to not throw out your Prism Stones since you’ll be able to use them in Puri Para. About the name “Puri Para”, he said that nothing beats short titles with four syllables like this. He said he’s going back to Prism World now lol.\n\nReposting the opening pic so you don’t have to scroll up to see who is who.\n\nLike you should have read on the ANN article, all the heroines in Puri Para will be voiced by i☆Ris members. They will also sing the songs. They announced three of them for now and will announce the others later. I like Lala’s design, but I’m not a big fan of the other two.\n\nLike you already know, the heroine Lala is voiced by Akaneya Himika. She’s the one in the middle and totally looks like Creamy Mami. I really like her design.\n\nThe one on the left is called Mireille and will be voiced by Serizawa Yuu (Ann in RL). Mireille is a French name and she wears a blue and a red ribbon with white on them, and her outfit is full of these colors. These are the colors of the French flag. She’s even blonde and got blue eyes too. She presents all the stereotypical traits the usual Japanese person would imagine about a French little girl so I guess she’s French. I bet she’ll even spout out random French words since it’ll sound cool to little girls. Siiiigh.\n\nThe one on the right is called Sophie and is voiced by Kubota Miyu.\n\nSomething a bit similar already happened in Dear My Future with Prizmmy and PURETTY. The Prizmmy and PURETTY members in Dear My Future weren’t voiced by their respective real life counterpart though. This time the real life singers are voicing the characters along with singing, but unlike in DMF the characters doesn’t share the real girls’ first names. When we’ll have more info, we’ll know if the idols in the anime will use the name i☆Ris for their group or not. Notice how I use the word “idol” since they’re definitely idols and this is definitely an idol show now. That’s what I want to talk about next.\n\nPuri Para’s logo.\n\nAnyway, it’s funny because whenever someone said that All Star Selection could be ditching the skating because Lala doesn’t wear skates, I’d say that the Pretty Rhythm logo has a skate on it so they definitely won’t remove skating. Turns out now Pretty Rhythm will end once All Star Selection is over and it’s successor Puri Para will be focused entirely on idoling. All Star Selection is the last time we’re seeing ice skating.\n\nMore about the Puri Para arcade game now. The game will be launched in July, around the time Puri Para starts airing. They’re keeping the idea of the Pretty Rhythm arcade game system with the clothes data in collectibles. Instead of Prism Stones, Puri Para’s arcade game will use a ticket system with tickets/cards called “Purichike” (Contraction of Prism and Ticket)\n\nLike they say in the video, if you have Prism Stones, you’ll be able to use them to get the corresponding outfits in Puri Para. You’ll also be able to transfer data from your 3DS Pretty Rhythm game too. Taking this into account, Takara Tommy will probably remove the old Pretty Rhythm arcade game machines in two or three years and replace everything with Puri Para. The slogan of the game promotes the fact that you can take photos with the machine and immediately debut and become an idol.\n\nA Purichike containing one of Lala’s dresses. Notice how it has some sort of appellation, “Dreaming Girl”. I don’t think I ever brought it up, but the Prism Stones clothes in Pretty Rhythm are divided into multiple categories. Lovely, Pop, Cool, Sexy, Ethnic, Feminine and Star. I learned this a long time ago thanks to Pretty Rhythm Aurora Dream’s 3rd ED.\n\nThis is why btw they decided to give each of these attributes to the Rainbow Live girls.\n\nIt seems they will divide the Purichike using some kinds of brands now, instead of attributes. JUST LIKE AIKATSU!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nTo end this post, I’d like to bring up possible reasons for these major changes. I gotta say though, I’m not a little girls anime and toys industry specialist, and I definitely don’t want to pass as one, unlike so many people on the net. So all of this is just my own interpretation based on my own experiences. The biggest reason I can think of is AIKATSUUUUUUU\n\nCertainly, Pretty Rhythm is ok profitable for Takara Tommy, else they wouldn’t have continued the arcade game for more than 4 years, released 4 anime seasons + a movie and two video games. The thing is, Aikatsu! is doing really well in Japan, even rivaling Pretty Cure in terms of popularity. For example, the second Aikatsu! game, “Aikatsu! Futari no My Princess” on 3DS sold 170.716 copies in 2013. It’s in the top 100 of the most bought games in Japan in 2013. Meanwhile the second Pretty Rhythm game “Pretty Rhythm: My Deco Rainbow Wedding” on 3DS sold around 70.000 copies.\n\n(The numbers are from Famitsu. I’m too lazy to find the actual number for Pretty Rhythm.\n\nI can’t really compare the popularity of their respective arcade games.\n\nI could look at the TV ratings of the anime but screw that, not gonna waste minutes of my life for this.)\n\nAnyway, since Aikatsu! started after Pretty Rhythm and got much more popular, Takara Tommy is now copying from Aikatsu!.\n\nThey’re stopping Pretty Rhythm and starting Puri Para to focus on idols too. This is really funny because Aikatsu! copied ton of things from Pretty Rhythm in the first place. Among the ones I can think of right now:\n\nFor the arcade game:\n\nUsing a card system with the Aikatsu Cards to collect clothes just like Pretty Rhythm and the Prism Stone system.\n\nAikatsu! being based on a rhythm game just like Pretty Rhythm.\n\nAdding new idols using instruments when Rainbow Live got released. This would be a coincidence if not for the fact that the new idol in the new Aikatsu! used a guitar, just like Naru in Rainbow Live which got released a few months before.\n\nFor the anime:\n\nIchigo’s family owning a restaurant, namely a bento store. Aira’s parents in Aurora Dream had a patisserie.\n\nThe story twist of one of the main characters’ mother being actually the most famous performer a few years ago. (Sure, that one is a classic in anime but you still can’t ignore it)\n\nSaid mother also “mysteriously disappeared” in both shows when they were at the peak of their popularity.\n\nUsing CG for the performances (though you could argue this is a common thing nowadays)\n\nLast but not least, the most popular and blatant one: a good portion of the “Appeals” in Aikatsu! season1 are literally copy pasted from the Prism Jumps in Pretty Rhythm.\n\nI actually never watched videos of the Aikatsu! arcade game, or played it myself, so I never checked if it is also the case in the game or if it’s limited to the anime. I also haven’t watched Aikatsu! past episode 44 so far because of a lack of time so maybe they stopped copying in the second season. They should just remove the appeals anyway, they all suck.\n\nNow don’t get me wrong, I love Aikatsu!, and I already said multiple times that in the end, the Aikatsu! anime and the Pretty Rhythm anime are pretty different. You can like one and not the other. In my case, I think Pretty Rhythm is the best anime airing for three years while i think Aikatsu! is just a good show. In any case, I just had to bring this up.\n\nAnd you know, Pretty Rhythm too copied stuff from it’s predecessors, mainly Sega’s Oshare Majo: Love & Berry released in 2004. Maybe you know about it thanks to back when Bakemonogatari didn’t use to suck, as there was a reference to it in one of the episodes.\n\nAs far as I know (and I’m probably wrong) Love & Berry is the first arcade game to have coupled a collectible card system you can use for getting clothes with a rhythm & fashion game.\n\nIn the end that’s just how the world of toys or business in general work.\n\nTo end this post, here’s some of my first speculations about Puri Para:\n\nSince they explicitly use the word idol, do you think there won’t be love interests anymore? Or are they going to do the no romance policy crap cuz they’re idols? I wonder if they’ll have follow this romance is taboo stupid rule, and if it’ll be idols for otakus instead of idols for little girls?\n\nDo you think Puri Para’s anime will be a typical kid anime or will try to appeal to a broader audience like Pretty Rhythm, with actual character development among other things?\n\nMoriwaki Makoto worked on Captain Tsubasa, one of my favorite shows (though I’d say I like the Road to 2002 anime better since they remade the parts covered in the first anime with less dragging on. I feel the same with Dragon Ball Kai). She also worked on Doreamon and Gintama. Also on Jewelpet Sunshine and Jewelpet Kira Deco and over at that blog I read about them being aimed at adults so I guess she knows how to do a kids shows also interesting to adults. It’s not like the director is the only factor that will make a show this or that though."
