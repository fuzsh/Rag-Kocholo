The difference, however, lies in the execution. The series redelivers comedy, inspirational, heart-warming moments in many different ways, some of them pretty creative. If you're looking for any kind of realism look elsewhere. All the problems in the show are solved by Kirari giving a little to a lot of kindness and hard work over a day to a few weeks. The antagonists introduced in the show almost always end up having some personal circumstances that we discover ... later on make their actions more excusable (and sometimes downright funny).\n\nI can see how, if you are the target audience for this show, this could make kids dangerously idealistic and bound for a rude awakening. Sometimes people just suck and there's no amount of kindness you can give and no excuse they can provide that will make it better. Also, the people with good intentions putting in hard work don't always reap the rewards. As long as its taken with a grain of salt anyone should be fine.\n\nArt: 6\n\nThe artists succeed in making Kirari cute and they don't resort to cheap means like Rosario Vampire (I like that show too but you can't go five minutes without an up-skirt shot). They do resort to using sparkles ALOT. The main character sparkles. Get used to it. Backgrounds and side characters are decent. The amount of detail is lacking but it gets the job done. Many of the animations that are simple have a comedic effect though.\n\nSound: 8\n\nAny show that makes half-way decent pop songs for half of their main characters deserves at least a 7. The songs in Kirarin Revolution, especially Kirari's are pretty good. Voice acting is hilarious. I thought they did a pretty decent job. Some one liners get repetitive. It's amazing how many times Hiroto calls Kirari an idiot.\n\nCharacter: 7\n\nAs of episode 65 Hiroto's character is pretty three-dimensional. Seiji is pretty much an air-head with a decent heart when he remembers. Kirari is one of the cutest characters in anime that I've encountered. Hiroto actually balances her character because she's too nice and Hiroto will actually reprimand people who are acting out of line. As for how deep Kirari is, she definitely has her moments. I wouldn't call her character monochromatic. The antagonists of the show are pretty solid. It's nice when you get to the show, knowing that things are going to work out in the main character's favor, I started to actually like the antagonists and find them amusing. Most of them have decent reasons for being antagonists as well.\n\nEnjoyment: 8\n\nThis show makes me laugh very often. I find it clever in its execution and I like the good feeling I get when things work out for Kirari and the people she tries to help. Even though I know most of those things don't, or rarely happen in real life, its nice to visit a world where they do. There's also undertones of romance that are well done and appropriate.\n\nOverall: 7\n\nOne Warning, there are a few episodes that are clearly fillers. There are a few more that are filler-ish. I couldn't find a list of them but I could pick them out pretty easily, so you can safely skip the ones that don't look like they're adding anything important to the mix. Other than that I have no real complaints. I like long series that continue to deliver. I'm happy I'm watching Kirarin Revolution. I can care less that I'm not the target audience.\n\nReviewer’s Rating: 7\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\nNice 0\n\nLove it 0\n\nFunny 0\n\nConfusing 0\n\nInformative 0\n\nWell-written 0\n\nCreative 0\n\nShow all\n\nI think the animators should know that their art begins to deteriorate after each big problem is overcame by Kirari. What is worse is that Kirari matures, which kind of loses the comedy as time goes by.\n\nStory: (2) --Because it can only gets more realistic and not comedic\n\nArt: (1) -- Must I say, a rectangle face shaped Kirarin suits the world of Minecraft rather than the anime world\n\nSound: (4) --I had some opening and ending songs I liked so I'd say this is a decent score I'll give\n\nCharacter: (6) --Naa-san is a character that is way past worthiness to be worshipped.....\n\nEnjoyment: (4) ... --God is good to whoever can enjoy the anime without noticing the art\n\nOverall: (5)--I enjoyed how the anime began but.....damn. It's a fair score, I am even thinking that I am too nice to give such a high score\n\nThat is all; my long held anger is finally being spoken and released.\n\n(Btw most of my anger came from how they made Seji and Hiroto ugly. Such a horrendous crime cannot go unseen. )\n\nReviewer’s Rating: 5\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\nNice 0\n\nLove it 0\n\nFunny 0\n\nConfusing 0\n\nInformative 0\n\nWell-written 0\n\nCreative 0\n\nShow all\n\n*Before you decide to watch this anime, be informed that there is no Eng sub for the last episodes (116-153). I was able to finish this with French dub*\n\n--In a hurry ? Read that important notice : Change of art style and seyuus in the middle of the series for CGI and younger seyuus. No story developpement. Don't waste your time.-- Exemple of the magnificent art style in the late episodes : https://www.hostingpics.net/viewer.php?id=63023020170517130837Kilaripisode125VFYouTube.png\n\n==Story== (2) : Kirarin☆Revolution is about a cute girl with a big heart and a beautiful smile. The story revolves around her idol career and the other characters that get in her ... way for diverse reasons. There's aelso a love triangle between Kirarin and 2 guys (which are also idols).\n\nHonestly, my score for the story wouldn't be *that* low if the anime was shorter. The first 30 episodes were entertaining. Damn, even the first 60 manage to make me smile ! But after that... the story was a repetition of a repetition of a repetition. No developpement of the characters. No improvement of the love story.\n\nOh, and I almost forgot. After episode 100, almost 6 minutes (excluding opening/ending) were kirarin singing the same. f*king. song. (Because she's popular and sings in her shows for her fans, you see ?)\n\n==Art/Animation== (1) : Oh. My. God. Why no reviews about this ?! Art was good for the first 103. At episode 103, I thought I was watching a video made for April Fool. I seriously thought that. They F*ucing changed the art style for CGI. Honestly, I don't know why they thought it was a smart move to change the art style in the middle of the series, but I would've accept it if it was well made (I had no problem with Ajin and Kingdom !), but damn, the movement of the characters were awkward, the shape of the mouth was, well... the mouth was in the place of the nose and weirdly moving. Everything was ugly, except when they were dancing. At least, they were dancing often.\n\n==Sound== (4) : I liked some Seyuu's voices acting. Some were bad (especially the \"villains\") but we can manage that, eh ? What I have a difficulty to manage is the change of Seyuu's in the middle of the series. Wait for the reason : apparently, they wanted younger seyuus so they can perform in front of IRL fans. Really ? Who made that stupid decision ? Clearly not people that were planning to make an anime of quality.\n\n==Character== (3) : I loved the characters, at first. Funny, cute, made me smile. I shipped Kirarin x Hiroto. But NO DEVELOPEMENT of the characters. At episode 153, they are at the same developpement than at episode 10. Seriously.\n\n==Enjoyment== (3) : The first episodes ? 7.
