        "text": "Remember I was going to write a summary/review for all the Kirarin * Revolution volumes I own? Well, this is it. (I'll be changing the \"preview\" image soon because I currently have no access to a scanner.) I will only review the first 9 volumes because those are the only ones I have. Currently volumes 10 and 11 are released, but I do not plan on getting them now. My Japanese isn't that proficient but I understand enough to know what's going on most of the time. VIZ has licensed the manga, but they have no release date yet, but I'm sure they'll speak up soon.\n\nYou may know Kirarin * Revolution from that one girl from Morning Musume. (I heard rumors it was Yaguchi Mari originally slated to voice her?) that voices the main character, Kirari, and regularly produces new songs under that image (recent song being that godawful ear-bleeding Pa-Pancake). You may know Kirarin * Revolution from that one anime adaptation that recently went 3D CG animation that now looks so lame. You may know Kirarin * Revolution as one of Ciao Comics' most popular hits in the shoujo manga universe.\n\nPeriodic introduction aside, Kirarin * Revolution is a still-running manga series written and drawn by Nakahara An. It is about one girl named Tsukishima Kirari who aspires to be an idol (just to be with Seiji from the boyband SHIPS) and the trials she encounters before she is able to become successful.\n\nChapter 1: Kirari is a very cute but gluttonous girl who does not care about idols. One day, she finds a turtle in a tree. She rescues it from the tree, thinking it as a childish prank, but she ends up falling into the arms of a nerdy boy. Nerdy boy turns out to be a heartthrob, who had been looking for the turtle (unoriginally named \"Kame-san\"). Kirari develops a crush on him, and as thanks, the boy, Seiji, gives Kirari a ticket to a SHIPS concert where he claims to be working there.\n\nKirari goes to the hall where SHIPS is performing and meets this cocky boy. She tells him she wants to meet Seiji, but cocky boy cockblocks her by ripping up her ticket, telling her to \"stay away from Seiji because they are from different worlds.\" However, Kirari retaliates, telling him to not interfere with her and Seiji. Ticketless, she sneaks into the hall by an air vent, and makes an astonishing discovery when she sees the stage — Seiji and the mean boy from earlier are on it!! Kirari falls from the vent, but her fall is luckily cushioned by a star-shaped... um, cushion.\n\nSeiji doesn't mind her presence (OF COURSE) and introduces her to the crowd as an angel, sprinkling feathers from the cushion on her. He and mean boy escort her backstage, with the mean boy freaking out at Seiji for being so nice to the \"dummy\" (Kirari). Kirari still doesn't understand what's going on (she thinks that both of them are staff members) until the mean boy (known as Hiroto) tells her that he and Seiji are SHIPS, a popular boy duo. It finally dawns on Kirari by what he means by \"different worlds\", but she's determined to be with Seiji, no matter what! She runs out to the stage, snags the mic, and is like, \"I'M TSUKISHIMA KIRARI AND I'M AIMING TO BE AN IDOLLLLLLLL!!!\"\n\nChapter 2: Kirari's claim to be an idol has made it to the press, but it's not as bad as it seems because the girls in the class end up supporting Kirari. Kirari's friend finds an ad in a magazine that is holding idol auditions for people 12-16 years old. Kirari decides to go but at the auditions, the dressing room is filled with boys undressing. Expectedly, here comes SHIPS again. Hiroto cockily shows her the fine print of the ad, and it turns out that the auditions were meant for boys. He tells her to give up and go home. However, Seiji secretly slips, \"Sorry, Kirari-chan, for the mean things Hiro-kun said...\" Kirari replies, \"No, it's okay,\" and then Seiji says, \"I'm happy that you came\" before he leaves with Hiroto. (He's such a nice boy!)\n\nNa-san, Kirari's genius cat who follows her everywhere, shows Kirari that she can still participate in the auditions by pretending to be a boy, so she does. She wears a wig and calls herself \"Tsukishima Kirao\" (the character that stands for \"o\" is \"boy\"). Of course, SHIPS immediately know who she is, and surprisingly they, along with their manager, are dazzled with \"Kirao's\" performances.\n\nDuring break, Kirari is approached by a bulky boy (another audition participant) and he had been appealed by Kirari's cuteness. He basically hits on her, claiming that he doesn't care if she's a girl or a guy, and Na-san jumps on his head to stop him. Na-san is thrown out of the window and lands in a tree. Kirari climbs out of the window to the tree in order to save him. The commotion causes SHIPS to notice, and Hiroto impulsively goes to rescue her. Kirari successfully rescues Na-san, but she's stuck in the tree and can't get down; the tree branch she's on snaps and she falls. Fortunately, Hiroto makes it in time to grab her arm. As he pulls her up, her wig falls off, revealing to everyone that she is a girl. Kirari apologizes for lying about her sex, but SHIPS' manager decides to make her part of the agency as an idol...\n\nChapter 3: The next day, SHIPS' manager (he's called \"Shachou-san\", \"shachou\" meaning \"president\", and he has no name) informs Kirari that she will make her debut in a cake mix commercial. However, this role was originally supposed to be Ogura Erina's, so the two are to audition for it. That's when Erina, who turns out to be a Hiroto fan with a faux cute act, comes in. (Hiroto continues to be an asshole as he calls Erina annoying, and not even to her face.) Anyways, as soon as she hears of Kirari, she becomes understandably angry.\n\nKirari trains herself to bake a cake for the audition, but her creations suck terribly. At seeing her effort and stamina, Hiroto teaches her how to bake a cake. Erina sees them together and that's the last straw for her; later, Shachou-san alerts her that the time of the audition. Not surprisingly, she lies to Kirari about the time so she would miss it.\n\nHiroto finds Kirari and alerts her that the audition is about to start. He's wondering why she's dillydallying and asks her if it's because she doesn't want to go. Kirari tells him in an emphatic speech that she wants to go, so Hiroto replies to \"leave it to him\" and he calls a bunch of fashion assistants to rush her over to the audtions. Meanwhile, Erina's plan is nearly successful until Kirari steps into the studio.\n\nChapter 4: Erina is certainly not pleased Kirari has shown up after all. Meanwhile, Na-san makes a cake, dazzling one of the directors, but Seiji takes him away, telling Kirari he'll take care of Na-san while she auditions. So, anyways, as Kirari and Erina begin, Erina is determined to take down Kirari at all costs. First, she tries to trip Kirari, but Hiroto dives in to block the cake batter from falling on her dress and Na-san catches her bowl. Kirari thanks Na-san, totally ignoring Hiroto, but after he's like, \"DUDE I SAVED YOU\" she thanks him and offers to wipe the cake batter off his head. He goes typically tsundere about it, and at this Erina gets angrier.\n\nMeanwhile, Na-san and Kame-san are getting along very well, and Kame-san is now \"calling\" Na-san \"Aniki\" (slang for \"big brother\", or in a yakuza/gang sense, \"boss\"). Back with Kirari, Erina tries Plan B and tricks Kirari and Na-san into looking away (lying to them about there being taiyaki, which is both of their favorite food). She places Kame-san on the cake, causing it to fall down and look messy. Seiji apologizes for Kame-san being on there, but Kirari is determined to go on.\n\nThe crew starts filming the commercial, and it appears that they film both of the girls and take the best footage for the actual commercial. Both of the girls have to eat their cake for the commercial and Erina eats her first, going on about how GUUUUUUUD it is. Kirari eats her cake next, but her mouth starts burning up. Erina had put wasabi in her cake as a back-up plan in case Kame-san was removed. Everyone's a little worried, but when Kirari stares into the camera, she smiles with tears in her eyes. Everyone's touched at her performance.\n\nErina is outraged that her plan didn't work and eats Kirari's cake to see how she failed. She starts breathing fire because it's so spicy, and Kirari starts breathing fire as well. Both of them pass out when Na-san throws water on them. Kirari wakes up in her bed the next day, and when she goes to the studio, Hiroto shows her the cake commercial being played outside on a huge TV screen. Kirari's on it. Shachou-san claims that a new \"revolution\" is about to start...\n\nChapter 5: Kirari is super-happy that she passed the audition, and Shachou-san decides to make her an idol. He hires a flamboyant man named KAMA (who speaks like a girl and is someone famous that everyone except for Kirari knows) to give her vocal lessons. Kirari's singing is TERRIBLE (exaggerated by nearly destroying the room) and KAMA says that she is a hopeless case, but Kirari wants to continue because she really wants to learn how to sing.\n\nKirari feels unconfident about her abilities as an idol until she encounters Seiji, who was taking Kame-san out for a walk. ♥ Seiji boosts her confidence by running out downtown, pushing Kirari into the center of many people, and yelling to everyone that she's the girl on the cake commercial. The people recognize her immediately, and Kirari feels scared that they'll hate her, but the crowd thinks it might be a promotion for something. They cheer for her to sing. Kirari's unsure that her vocal abilities are good, but Seiji gently tells her that the people gathered want to hear her song, and as an idol, she needs to cater to her fans. You know the term, \"give the people what they want\", except this isn't a democracy.\n\nSo Kirari sings. Her song charms them, and with this newfound confidence, Kirari feels better. She thanks Seiji, but Seiji's disguise slips. One of the girls in the crowd notice THE Seiji from SHIPS is there, and Kirari has to drag him away~\n\nBack at the studio, Kirari's singing has gotten immense improvement, and she thanks Seiji for boosting her confidence (while Hiroto looks on, a little jealous). Meanwhile, Erina's in the hospital, watching the commercial and seething in anger.\n\nChapter 6: Kirari is preparing for her first TV live with SHIPS. She's getting along with Hiroto better now, and Erina, off to the side, is jealous. Before the live is about to begin, Na-san is hypnotized with taiyaki and is lured into Erina's trap. Kirari receives a kidnapping note that Na-san has been kidnapped. Although the live is starting, Kirari instead plans to search for Na-san. Hiroto offers to help, but Shachou-san comes in to tell Seiji and Hiroto that they need to go on stage. In response, Kirari says she'll do it by herself and starts her quest.\n\nShe finds Kame-san in the trash bin and Kame-san leads her to where Na-san is held captive, but a man comes out with Na-san's cage, mistakening Kirari for Erina. It turns out Na-san had escaped, and he was out buying taiyaki. (♥) Erina tries to take over Kirari's role, but unfortunately for her, Kirari makes it to the stage in time and sings her debut song, Kirarin * Revolution. She's now popularized on TV as an idol...\n\nMmkay, thoughts and thoughts.\n\nI've already said this before, but Hiroto strikes me as a tsundere. It's rather irritating to see him be such an asshole to everyone. He rudely insults Erina when she says hi to him (\"Who's she? That annoying [girl]...\") and on some occasions lashes out at Seiji. However, he is growing to be protective of Kirari. Why? People fall in love for different reasons, but I think it's because Hiroto is impressed with her determination, although she has a really silly reason to be an idol.\n\nNow, Kirari has a silly reason to be an idol — she wants to be with Seiji, someone she just met. She couldn't even sing, and she hardly understands the pressures of being an idol... but in the later volumes, she does learn. None of it drives her to the point of wanting to quit, though.\n\nErina is really one-dimensional and hella annoying. The way she talks is so fake and it's like she's pretending to be cute. She's been pushed into the role of playing that \"super jealous rival that is the opposite of the good character\" and is depicted as malicious for no reason. It's mostly because Kirari took her spot to shine, but duuuude. That is so dumb. She has other opportunities to shine; at least she wasn't dropped from the commercial! She had a chance to be a star, and it just so happens that the more appealing one took over. It's not the end of the world, and there are other ways for her to be popular.\n\nAs for Seiji, he's super nice to everyone, Kirari especially, but it seems to be his nature. He has a less tendency to become angry (although one of the episodes in the anime show him angry, but since it wasn't in the manga, it shall not be discussed) and it makes him all the more mysterious. He's such a kind person, always supporting Kirari, and that's why he's my favorite character. The author does not expand on his character or give a little backstory in the volumes I have, but I heard that he came from a wealthy family who were against his being an idol. That might just be in the anime only.\n\nAnd the title. \"Kirarin * Revolution\" is Kirari's debut song, but the characters also say it's like a new revolution is starting. My question is, a new revolution of what exactly? A new revolution of the way idols are depicted...? To an average person, Kirari's almost the same as any typical idol girl.\n\nInterestingly, Seiji's turtle Kame-san and Kirari's freaking genius cat Na-san are not called pets. In one volume, Kirari even says that Na-san is not a \"pet\", but a \"best friend.\" I liked that denotation more and how animals are seen more as friends because \"pet\" has a meaning of \"property\" while \"best friend\" indicates a strong bond.\n\nCompared to other idol series like Full Moon wo Sagashite, it isn't the best — there's hardly any character development except for Kirari and Hiroto, some characters are too one-dimensional, the art is a little disproportioned, and obviously Kirari would be useless without Na-san. It's not my favorite; I actually only read the manga just for Seiji. The screentoning and the panel layouts seem to make up for the flaws — well, if you're like me, who likes looking at stuff like this.\n\nI have already mentioned the animated adaptation of it, and in my opinion it is honestly inferior to the manga. Because manga chapters are released monthly, the show needed fillers to fill up the episode schedule to make up for it; at the same time it provides more character depth. Also, since the debut of Kirarin * Revolution STAGE 3 (the \"second series\" taking place after episode 102), the animation has gone all 3D and it looks REALLY BAD. Not to mention, I do not like Kusumi Koharu's acting because most of the time it feels forced. Nakahara An thinks of Koharu as a \"real-life Kirari\" but I kind of disagree. Koharu's voice acting made me not like the show and Kirari as much, and my liking in Kirari was slightly restored when I read the manga.\n\nThe animated adaptation seems to feature characters that were not in the original manga. I have not gotten the recent releases but I am honestly sure that Kirari does not form Kira * Pika with Hikaru or MilkyWay with Kobeni and Noeru. There's only two volumes with six chapters each so I'm not sure if it could accomodate so much. However, I'm almost fairly certain that the manga artist, Nakahara An, planned the character designs for Hikaru and MilkyWay... almost, that is.\n\n... oh, yeah, unrelated, but since when did FUNimation license Mamotte! Lollipop?!"
