However, when Kirari shows up at the concert, another boy named Hiroto, tears up her ticket and warns her to stay away from Seiji, because they both live in different worlds. Kirari learns that Seiji and Hiroto are members of the idol group Ships. Finally understanding the meaning of \"different worlds\", Kirari refuses to give up pursuing Seiji and declares that she will also become an idol. However, being an idol requires tons of training and talent.

Koharu Kusumi from Morning Musume was cast as Kirari. Kusumi also performed the opening and ending theme songs, as well as releasing music under Kirari Tsukishima's name.[6] Kusumi noted in her autobiography, 17-sai no Tenshoku, that the anime was originally supposed to last for one year, but due to the success of the show, it was renewed for two more broadcast years.[7]\n\nAfter the show's third renewal, Kirarin Revolution broadcast its second season with the subtitle Kirarin Revolution Stage 3. The show aired on TV Tokyo from April 8, 2008 to March 27, 2009, for a total of 51 episodes.[8] It was animated by SynergySP and SimImage in 3D animation and HD format. Noel Yukino and Kobeni Hanasaki, new original characters played by Sayaka Kitahara and You Kikkawa from Hello Pro Egg, were added to the main cast.[9] Takuya Ide and Shikou Kanai were cast as the new actors for Ships members Hiroto and Seiji.[10]\n\nIn addition to providing the voice to Kirari, Kusumi made crossover appearances at concerts and television shows as her character, including being a recurring guest on Haromoni and Oha Suta,[11] which made her one of the pioneers of the \"idol voice actor\" crossover beginning in the late 2000s.[12] For the summer of 2007, Mai Hagiwara from Cute was cast as an anime-original character, Hikaru Mizuki, and became part of an anime-original idol subunit Kira Pika with Kusumi for a short story arc, releasing music and making in-character appearances on other television shows on TV Tokyo.[13] During Kirarin Revolution Stage 3's run, the show's new format launched a singing career for new cast and allowed crossover appearances on other television shows as their characters.[9][10] On April 4, 2008, Ide and Kanai appeared on Oha Suta as their characters for the first time and also had their own in-character segment on the show on Thursdays from April 10, 2008 to May 4, 2009.[11][14]\n\nIn 2007, Viz Media Europe licensed the anime for European release under the title Kilari![15][16]\n\nLive-action TV series[]\n\nShort live-action drama episodes were aired on Oha Suta, with small segments aired over several days.
