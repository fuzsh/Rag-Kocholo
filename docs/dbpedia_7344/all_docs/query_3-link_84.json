It brings an aura.\n\nwe all said at minimum 2 out of 3 in KC.... if not all 3.... which put us back in the WC Race, as KC is imploding here if they've got the 3rd WC spot\n\nPlease put Crawford on the phantom IL.\n\nI beg.\n\ngotta skip him for a couple weeks maybe more - get fitts/penrod up there something. I'd rather not go back to the winck stuff but kutter can't keep going like this.\n\nf***ed by the ump this inning\n\nUsually I agree with you but no this has been all on Crawford\n\ngotta skip him for a couple weeks maybe more - get fitts/penrod up there something. I'd rather not go back to the winck stuff but kutter can't keep going like this.\n\nIt's clear he's gotta sit. Can't keep putting him out there. He looks lost.\n\nBernardino serving up a f***ing meatball to Pasaqulino there\n\nf***ing gross.\n\nUsually I agree with you but no this has been all on Crawford\n\nThat walk to Massey was brutal but I’m referring to the Melendez at-bat. That was a long battle that he won and the ump porked him. Everything after is on him\n\nThat walk to Massey was brutal but I’m referring to the Melendez at-bat.

And I saw that pitch, it was out of the strike zone even though it looked deceiving by how that guy bats.\n\nTrevor Story doing fielding drills? Batting?\n\nColor me flabbergasted. Maybe it is true he'll come back this season.\n\n5 and 1/2 weeks left in the Minor league Regular season\n\nTell Trevor that\n\nas it stands now Worcester isn't likely to get in..... Portland might.... but will the team elect a rehab assignment instead of readding Story outright to the roster\n\nYeah but usually when pitchers are obviously doing awful, the umps don't give them the benefit of the doubt.
