        "text": "As recently as last week, it was suggested that the Pittsburgh Penguins and superstar Sidney Crosby could wait until he turned 37 on Wednesday to announce a contract extension.\n\nThe date of 8-7 came and went without the Penguins confirming any meaningful update about No. 87's status. On Thursday, Penguins insider Rob Rossi of The Athletic explained why fans shouldn't be worried about where Crosby will call home through the remainder of his Hall of Fame career.\n\n\"Crosby’s 37th birthday was never a target date for a new deal that he and the team remain confident will be signed, multiple Penguins and league sources said,\" Rossi shared. \"...Crosby has told close friends he intends to re-sign with the Penguins and that he, agent Pat Brisson and Penguins hockey president/general manager Kyle Dubas are largely aligned about details of a new contract; however, his priority this offseason has been on training for the upcoming season. There are 'no issues at all' between Crosby and the Penguins.\"\n\nWhile Crosby became the subject of some trade rumors this past winter before the Penguins missed the playoffs for a second consecutive year, multiple reports have indicated he still wants to retire a one-club NHL man. However, the fact that he remains in the final year of his current deal continues to raise eyebrows among the Pittsburgh fanbase, worrying he could experience a change of heart about featuring for a franchise that's seemingly begun a much-needed roster rebuild.\n\nAs of Thursday afternoon, DraftKings Sportsbook had the Penguins at +120 betting odds to make the playoffs for the 2024-25 campaign.\n\n\"Crosby has counted only $8.7M against the cap on his past two contracts, granting the Penguins his services at a perceived below-market level for the past 16 seasons,\" Rossi added. \"He is unsure exactly how long he wants to keep playing and 'doesn’t want to put (the Penguins) in a bad spot' if he signs a longer deal and doesn’t play it out in full, a source close to Crosby said.\"\n\nSources close to the Penguins want fans to relax regarding Crosby's future. With that said, Rossi noted that \"all parties agree that a delay in finalizing a new contract for Crosby naturally leads to speculation that a deal will not get done.\"\n\nThe parties could end such speculation by finalizing an agreement sooner rather than later. They also seem in no rush to do so, even though they understand fans are growing a bit uneasy as Labor Day approaches."
