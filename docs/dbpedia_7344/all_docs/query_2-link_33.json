        "text": "As we've written previously in this space, the winner of the Presidents' Trophy is by no means guaranteed a Stanley Cup championship. Since the trophy was first awarded in 1985-86, only eight teams have won the regular-season points race and the Cup in the same campaign, the most recent being the Chicago Blackhawks in the lockout-shortened 2012-13 season.\n\nBut it's nevertheless an impressive accomplishment and guarantees home-ice advantage throughout the postseason to the team that claims the crown.\n\nSo who's winning it this season?\n\nFollowing wins yesterday, the New York Rangers and Dallas Stars continue to lead the pace. The Rangers are at 112 points and 42 regulation wins through 81 games. They'll close out their regular season on Monday against the Ottawa Senators, and a win of any kind in that game clinches the Presidents' Trophy for them.\n\nThe Stars have 111 points and 40 regulation wins through 81 games. Dallas will play its final game on Wednesday against the St. Louis Blues, and will know prior to opening puck drop whether it can catch New York.\n\nThe Carolina Hurricanes, who skate against the Blackhawks on Sunday (6 p.m. ET, NHL Power Play on ESPN+), have 109 points and 43 regulation wins through 80 games. After Sunday's matchup against one lottery team, their final game Tuesday is also against a team in the bottom four of the league, the Columbus Blue Jackets. The Canes are also hoping for a Rangers loss to the Sens to make this all interesting.\n\nFinally, the Boston Bruins have 109 points and 36 regulation wins following their win over the Pittsburgh Penguins on Saturday night. Much like the other clubs, they're hoping for the Rangers to lose to Ottawa to make things more interesting; the Bruins skate against the Washington Capitals on Monday, followed by those very same Senators on Tuesday to close out their regular season. Given their regulation wins deficit to all these other teams, the Bruins will need to win out and hope the other teams cap out at 112 or below.\n\nAs we traverse the final stretch of the regular season, it's time to check in on all the playoff races -- along with the teams jockeying for position in the 2024 NHL draft lottery.\n\nNote: Playoff chances are via Stathletes.\n\nJump ahead:\n\nCurrent playoff matchups\n\nSunday's schedule\n\nSaturday's scores\n\nExpanded standings\n\nRace for No. 1 pick\n\nCurrent playoff matchups\n\nEastern Conference\n\nA1 Boston Bruins vs. WC1 Tampa Bay Lightning\n\nA2 Florida Panthers vs. A3 Toronto Maple Leafs\n\nM1 New York Rangers vs. WC2 Washington Capitals\n\nM2 Carolina Hurricanes vs. M3 New York Islanders\n\nWestern Conference\n\nC1 Dallas Stars vs. WC2 Vegas Golden Knights\n\nC2 Winnipeg Jets vs. C3 Colorado Avalanche\n\nP1 Vancouver Canucks vs. WC1 Nashville Predators\n\nP2 Edmonton Oilers vs. P3 Los Angeles Kings\n\nSunday's games\n\nNote: All times ET.

As of 2021, a team can move up a maximum of 10 spots if it wins the lottery, so only 11 teams are eligible for the draw for the No. 1 pick. Full details on the process can be found here. Sitting No. 1 on the draft board for this summer is Macklin Celebrini, a freshman at Boston University.\n\n1. San Jose Sharks\n\nPoints: 47\n\nRegulation wins: 14\n\n2.
