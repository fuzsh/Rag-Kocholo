        "text": "Ed Sheeran is a singer-songwriter from Suffolk, England. Known for his hybrid pop and R&B sound, which mixes his soulful lyrics with his mellow voice, Ed Sheeran has found extensive fame across all corners of the globe.\n\nAt the tender age of 14, Ed Sheeran began recording music and independently released his first collection of songs “The Orange Room EP”. It was after his move to London in 2008, though, that his music career really began to take off due to the release of his “Loose Change EP”, which featured future megahit single “The A Team”.\n\nPrepared to graft from the very start, Ed Sheeran played 312 gigs in 2009 in addition to constantly releasing new material on his YouTube channel. These gigs and his widespread social media following caught the attention of Jamie Foxx, Elton John and Example. Further to this, his hard work won thousands of fans, who would show up at any small gigs he was playing. Knowing they were on to a good thing, Asylum/Atlantic Records quickly signed Ed Sheeran to their label after the release of his popular “No. 5 Collaborations Project” EP.\n\nEd Sheeran’s debut studio album “+” entered at number one in the UK charts after Ed secured four top ten singles in a row from the album. An opportunity to break into the US market soon came about after Ed was given the opportunity to tour with the band Snow Patrol.\n\nLicensing of his music to television shows, and collaborations with One Direction on their song “Moments” and with Taylor Swift on the song “Everything Has Changed” paved the way for Ed Sheeran’s second studio album “x” (pronounced ‘multiply’) to hit the number one position in both the UK and the US charts.\n\nDespite being so early in his career, Ed has already been nominated for three Grammy Awards and was the recipient of a 2012 Ivor Novello Award for “The A Team”. With these successes under his belt, Ed Sheeran’s star can only continue to rise.\n\nRead more\n\nGreat show! I bought my wife and I tickets as a gift for her (she was a huge Ed Sheeran fan even before he was famous) and we had a great time. My wife had never been to the venue, and while I had been to shows at Consol Enery Center before this was the first show I saw there since it became PPG Paints Arena. Everything about the production and performances (lights, audio, visuals, crew, musicians etc) went off with nary a hitch and was executed in a very timely manner. Props to all involved.\n\nJames Blunt opened, and like many people there (as he joked) I only knew one of his songs: \"You're Beautiful\". He was funny, charismatic, a good showman, and a good sport. He put on a high quality emotion filled performance, and despite his music being on the sadder side still managed to pump everyone up for Ed Sheeran. \"Don't Give Me Those Eyes\" was a highlight. He hung out in the Captain Morgan lounge after his performance and invited anyone interested to come hang with him. I came in not really knowing who he was and left checking out his latest music and regretting not grabbing a beer with him.\n\nThan Ed came out (my wife had a pinch me I'm dreaming moment). He was noticeably quieter and a bit more reserved than Blunt when addressing the audience, but quickly dove in. I was always aware Ed was a talented solo artist, but you really appreciate his talent on a different level when you actually hear him perform outside of a studio live with just him and a guitar. Most of his songs were studio quality. A few songs dipped in quality but for charming and understandable reasons like audience involvement and impressive sped-up improv (i.e. the \"Don't\" and \"New Man\" mashup). He played nearly all the songs my wife and I were looking for (\"Perfect\", \"A-Team\", \"Galway Girl\", \"Nancy Mulligan\", \"Thinking Out Loud\", etc.). Since this was the \"Divide\" tour he played almost every song off that album (but not all: no \"Barcelona\", \"Bibia be ye ye\", etc.) He also played a lot of his older songs, including an audience request for \"Cold Coffee\" (he stated it was the first time he performed it live since 2010-2011). I also liked how he put on a Pittsburgh Penguins jersey during his closing song \"You Need Me and I Don't Need You\".\n\nTLDR it was one of the best shows I have seen.\n\nRead more\n\nReport as inappropriate\n\nIt is safe to say that Ed Sheeran will be one of the defining artists of our generation. His music transcends any definable genre, combining soft folk with bright pop and grime hip-hop. Sheeran's clever wordplay and soulful lyrics are able to really captivate an audience, both when listening to him live or on a CD. One of the most salient qualities about him though, is his pure, unaltered, truly beautiful voice. It is hard to really visualize how great he sounds until you see him live. I was lucky enough to see him at a small, intimate performance with a crowd of only about 100. The first thing you notice about him is that it is just him up on stage. There is no band, no backing vocals, no track playing in the background or anything. It is him, a guitar, and a loop pedal. From the moment he struck the first chord until the moment he stepped off stage, the audience was enchanted by him. His voice can transport you from an old pub in Ireland to the grimy streets of London without ever missing a beat. A real troubadour, his shining moments are the ballads in which soaring vocals and romantic lyrics backed by the simple strum of his Little Martin cause major swooning.\n\nIt was evident to me that Sheeran deserves all of the attention he gets and more; his talent is truly undeniable, even if he isn't your favorite. He is so incredibly down-to-Earth, as well. I was able to meet him after he performed and he genuinely cared about what I had to say to him. He was warm, friendly, funny, and exceedingly normal. He's someone that you would want to hang out and watch TV with.\n\nWith his new album \"x\" (pronounced \"multiply\") Sheeran shows how much he has grown as an artist since the release of his debut album \"+\" three years ago. His love is more passionate, his hurt is more palpable, and when he throws shade, it's pretty intense. At the end of the day, he is a performer. You can tell how much music means to him when you see him live. He is a true artist: a beautiful lyricist, a stunning vocalist, and an incredibly entertaining musician.\n\nRead more\n\nReport as inappropriate\n\nLet me just start off by saying Ed Sheeran is an amazing performer and speaker. He is comedic and doesn't require thousands of lights and a massive stage to impress thousands. He stayed interactive with the crowd very well. This is my 3rd concert ever and it was both the best and worst I have ever.\n\nEd Sheeran did amazing, he isn't the issue. As people know in concerts you stand and dance to most songs and sit (under circumstances) when ballads are playing or the performer is speaking. So- I was standing during one of Ed Sheeran's many sings along/dancing songs. I am a 6 foot tall 13 years old there for my birthday. In the area, I was in many people asked me to sit while he talked which I happily obliged to then learning the rules.\n\nIt was all fine until one man yelled in a very rude/angry voice yelled at me (during a dancing song) \"SIT DOWN IDIOT IN THE BLACK HAT.\" Which at the very moment I didn't recognize as myself until my father went to lash back (as any protective super concert dad would do). This is something I had never experienced. So for the rest of the concert, I sat having an emotional/mental breakdown.\n\nI'm not sure if it was the music or the people that made me cry so much. This was an experience I will learn from. Unfortunately, it is (probably) because Ed Sheeran reins in a large age group as an audience. This means sometimes people will be cranky, rude, or just plain snarky.\n\nI understand if someone handicapped asked me to sit because they couldn't stand. But this man that yelled at me was about 50 or younger. I hope he ended up enjoying his concert because by halfway through my whole 6' or taller family stood and danced. He sat and everyone around him was asking him to join.\n\nSorry for my rant. Ed Sheeran is an amazing performer. I just thought you should know that people that (I know) will be everywhere (and we cant do much about them). But it was rude.\n\nRead more\n\nReport as inappropriate\n\nEd was fantastic! He played with no band or backtrack, but instead recorded himself and looped it as he went along to create the illusion of a backtrack or band. With only one person on stage in such a huge arena, there was a lot of opportunity to for the show to grow dry or redundant, especially for those sitting far away. However, he managed to keep me entertained the whole show with an AMAZING graphic show to accompany him. Each of his songs had a unique visual and light show that included scenes from music videos, new visuals, and video to project his performance. There was so much to look at I didn't even mind sitting far away (second level).\n\nHe was also very interactive with the crowd, asking us to sing along for most songs, telling stories, and even managing to request and achieve (near) complete silence from the audience during the few songs he deemed needed it. He's got just as amazing of a voice live as on his albums and managed to play all of my personal favorite songs in the span of his set, including a nice mixture of \"plus\" and \"multiply\" Plus, his rapping is 10x more impressive live. Between being his own DJ, spitting out verses quicker than I thought possible, and jumping around stage, it's hard to find out when he has time to breathe. But he kept his energy up throughout the whole show.\n\nThe exciting surprise of the event was during the encore, when he started singing \"Chasing Cars\" and was joined on stage by Gary Lightbody of Snow Patrol. He ended the snow and left the stage with his single \"Sing\" still looping, leaving the song and his performance stuck in everyone's head for the rest of the night. Overall, he was a skilled entertainer, one I would Definitially recommend to all who enjoy his music.\n\nRead more\n\nReport as inappropriate\n\nI have seen 300 concerts. This evening is in my top ten. The sheet quality of his songs, what he achieves with his looping, and the visuals on the screen were excellent. There were a few occasions during the night when Ed was bashing away at his guitar, lost in that massive cacophony,of sound, that I thought that the Budweiser Gardens might blast off into space! Excellent.\n\nEd also has a powerful voice and a fairly extensive knowledge of soul music. Some of the snippets he threw into songs last night were fantastic. There were some transcendental moments in that show were I felt that anything could happen. People were stunned. Also, the way that he deconstructed some of the fan favourites was very interesting to watch and listen to.\n\nAll that said, I think needs some assistance in creating more flow to the show and in reaching out to his audience in a meaningful way. He is 24. His songs are unreal. He knows how good he is. I hope that the stagecraft develops further with maturity.\n\nSongs like Photograph and Thinking Out Loud were a bit understated. Again, the quality of the songs allowed for a successful delivery. However, a song like Thinking out Loud is one for the ages. People will connect to that song forevermore. That piece needs to be a showstopper; a song that leaves the audiences emotional avd feeling connected to each other. He did not deliver in this department last night. His delivery on songs like this felt a bit selfish - a bit of a disappointment.\n\nEd Sheeran might level off in terms of the songs that he delivers to the world. If, on the other hand, they keep getting better we could be looking at a new kind of stardom. This boy is unreal. The world owns this guy now.\n\nRead more\n\nReport as inappropriate\n\nI don't know if it was the galavanting with Taylor Swift, but I know what you are thinking… Ed Sheeran is a ginger with a One Direction pre-teen fanatic following, and I'm not sure if I want to experience that live. Well I am here to tell you, you do. You really need to see Ed Sheeran live the next chance you get.\n\nI've been a fan of Ed Sheeran since I first heard \"You Need Me\" in 2011. Since then, Ed Sheeran has exploded, touring with Snow Patrol and (of course) Tay Swifty. I'm not sure if it was the time spent with Gary Lightbody and Snow Patrol, but Ed Sheeran has refined his songwriting to pull at your heartstrings and bring you on a 3 minute plus journey of love, loss, and sometimes revenge.\n\nWhen I had an opportunity to see him live for the first time this year, he was playing a massive stadium in Philadelphia. I was as ready as I could be for all the screaming pre-teens, but looking around before the show started the thing that surprised me most was the stage set up: two mics, two guitars and a loop pedal at the very front of the stage. The next couple hours were a thrilling experience of watch Ed Sheeran build his songs from those 3 things, using his guitar as drums, layering vocals to harmonize with himself, and using the crowd as an award winning choir.\n\nWith all of the production on the new album, I completely expected him to have a huge band on stage. Yet, just as he had done when he first started on the street and at open mic nights, Ed Sheeran played completely by himself… in a stadium. This is definitely a case of the pop music world getting it right… Ed Sheeran is a huge talent who deserves to be massive, and you will agree next time you see him live.\n\nRead more\n\nReport as inappropriate\n\nAfter a 4.5hr drive to see the show we weren’t disappointed!\n\nLewis Capaldi was first up and as funny and great as ever. Had the crowd laughing.\n\nThe Darkness were not my thing but they engaged with one particular guy called “Rick” in the crowd, who also sang his heart out for an appreciative audience.\n\nThe main man Ed appeared on stage around 8.30pm with a huge smile on his face, to an immense welcome from the Ipswich crowd, he was born not too far away, so was nice to see him finish this huge 2 year world tour at home.\n\nAlso he gave hundreds of free tickets to the pupils of the school he attended when he lived there.\n\nHis vocals were simply incredible, loud, strong, smooth and steamy, just beautiful !!\n\nScreen graphics and timings were perfect too.\n\nHis guitar playing was awesome to watch and I have no idea how he concentrates on so many things at once with the loop, that is pure talent and the build up and sound in some songs ie Eraser, Bloodstream and the awesome You need me,I don’t need you gave me goosebumps.\n\nEd was joined for Galway Girl by Beoga which was brilliant.\n\nSpecial guest Stormzy for “Shape of You” was the icing on the cake and I’m so pleased I bought the tickets last year, they were worth every penny.\n\nOnly complaint was the rude and miserable guy behind the official merch counter!! Spending £50 on a hoodie for my daughter meant I had to save for it and it would have been nice to have had a “hello” a “thank-you” or any kind of a smile!!!\n\nLuckily the bar staff were friendly, smiley and helpful as were the local people.\n\nWould 100% recommend ED SHEERAN as someone to see live, he is INCREDIBLE.\n\nMandy x\n\nRead more\n\nReport as inappropriate\n\nSeeing Ed Sheeran live was an incredible experience. Ed is not just a singer, but a brilliant artist, because every song of his is a work of art. He is 23 years old and he has released two albums, twelve EPs and collaborated with many successful artists.\n\nIf you doubt about seeing him live, because you're not really a big fan and you know a few of his most successful songs (The A-team, Lego House, Drunk, Give Me Love) - don't doubt my friend. Why? Let me tell you why. You know this feeling when you have to drive to a concert and you're already exhausted and the summer heat is making you all giddy? And then you have to wait in line and the heat is really bothering you? Well my friend, you forget all about it once Mr. Sheeran comes to the stage. The way he presents himself and his music is brilliant. He's just one man on the stage but he is all over the place. He makes sure we are all listening to him and not just screaming whenever he opens his mouth and a beautiful note comes out. During some of the songs you need to be quiet, and oh boy, we were quiet. It was like the crowd was holding their breath.\n\nSomething I really like about him, is that he is just a simple human being with an amazing talent that he wants to share with the world. He plays mostly in smaller arenas so he can connect more with the crowd. If you are a fan of acoustic artists and small venues - then his concert is definitely for you. I would highly recommend you go to Ed's concert even if you only know one song of his. He is absolutely amazing and his gigs are an incredible experience for everybody.\n\nRead more\n\nReport as inappropriate\n\nI fell in love with Ed's music a few years ago, a little before the big hype about him (of which there is every need to be). I loved his first album and all his \"old\" songs (pre-+) like ones in The songs I wrote with Amy and X (Mulitply) is just even better. I knew he would be amazing live, because any live lounges or live performances I've watched of his have been brilliant. What I love is that it's just him, his guitar and his loop pedal – no band or back-up singers which is something quite unique to him. That, I think, makes a more personal connection with him and the crowd so, even parents who didn't particularly want to be there could be involved as well with clapping etc. He seems really genuine and down-to-earth through his performances too as he doesn't have anything too flashy – just a couple screens behind him so everyone can see him. And of course, just jeans and a t-shirt. He had a good mix of up-beat and slow songs and songs with a slow start and build up which I really liked. He also added things to the songs like adding other parts of songs to the end or adding an extra verse than from what's on the album (eg. You need me, I don't need you). His love performance consisted mostly of songs from his new album, X but also many songs from + and a few older songs too like Gold Rush. I was definitely recommend listening to and going to a concert of Ed's because his music is for everyone and he is definitely a crowd-pleaser.\n\nRead more\n\nReport as inappropriate\n\nJames Blunt was the opening act, with Ed Sheeran as the main. The show started right on time, which doesn't always happen in my experience. Blunt had a hit with \"Beautiful\" in the states a while back and we haven't heard much from him since, so he poked fun at himself on stage and put on a great show. The crowd may have come to see Ed Sheeran, but Blunt set a great mood for the rest of the show, ending with an upbeat song. He is the self proclaimed singer of \"miserable songs\", yet he ended his set on a positive note and crowd participation.\n\nEd Sheeran's show started a bit after James Blunt's performance ended, 15 minutes maybe. As we already know, he's an incredibly gifted and talented artist. His set was beautiful, with a lot of graphics on the screens to go with the songs. I do wish that on some songs they'd shown him more on the big screens, since it's those of us sitting further back couldn't see him as well. That's fine though, it was still worth it. He ended with \"Shape of You\", which made our daughter very happy since she's not yet 9, that's one of her favorite songs, and this was her first concert.\n\nTacoma Dome was the venue, the concert and venue were great, the parking and way out, not so much. It was a total cluster and $30 parking for an outdoor lot with no real direction is not good, in my opinion. If there was actual traffic control to help leaving the concert, it would have been perfect. That's my only gripe.\n\nRead more\n\nReport as inappropriate"
