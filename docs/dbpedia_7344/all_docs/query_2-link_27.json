And then there were some just passing through.\n\nShare this story\n\nShare this on Reddit\n\nShare All sharing options\n\nShare All sharing options for: All-Time “HE Played for the Penguins?” Team\n\nThe Buffalo Sabres blog, Die By The Blade, did a fun story a few days ago making a lineup consisting of players that played in Buffalo throughout their franchise’s existence that most people forgot even happened. Their list was littered with former Pens players, including none-other than Bob Errey - as their 1LW to boot. Here’s an excerpt about their parameters in how they compiled their lineup:\n\nOne of the fun quarantine-era bits going around sports Twitter nowadays is compiling a roster of players for a team who people are apt to forget ever suited up for that team. With that in mind, I thought it’d be fun to take a crack at this for the Buffalo Sabres.\n\nI set out to put together my team, with the following parameters: I’d pick enough players to compile a standard team - four forward lines, three defense pairings and two goaltenders. Players appeared in 10 or fewer regular-season games with the Buffalo Sabres, which means many may not remember or even know that they ever skated in the blue and gold (or in some cases, the black and red).\n\nOverall, 67 skaters and 18 goaltenders meet the criteria. Without further ado, here’s my all-time “Wait, HE played for the Sabres?” team.\n\nWith the same criteria with the Penguins, the list came up with 98 skaters and 21 goalies. Let’s see what the Pens could do:\n\nForwards\n\nPatrick Marleau - Doug Smith - Rich Sutter\n\nBrett Sterling - Jason Williams - Petr Klima\n\nZach Boychuk - Alain Lemieux - Colin McDonald\n\nReid Simpson - Cal O’Reilly - Josh Jooris\n\nDefense\n\nCory Cross - Frantisek Kucera\n\nJoel Bouchard - Dylan Reese\n\nPhillip Samuelsson - Taylor Chorney\n\nGoalies\n\nRon Tugnutt\n\nMathieu Garon\n\nWhy Him?\n\nPatrick Marleau: 1,723 games, 562 G, 626 A, 1188 PTS; 8 games with Pittsburgh, 1 G, 1 A, 2 PTS\n\nTraded to Pittsburgh on 2/24/20 by San Jose for Pittsburgh (conditional) 3rd round pick in the 2021 NHL Draft.\n\nDoug Smith: 535 games, 115 G, 138 A, 253 PTS; 10 games with Pittsburgh in 1989-90, 1 G, 1 A, 2 PTS\n\nTraded to Pittsburgh on 2/26/90 by Vancouver for cash.\n\nRich Sutter: 874 games, 149 G, 166 A, 315 PTS; 4 games with Pittsburgh from 1982-84, 0 PTS.
