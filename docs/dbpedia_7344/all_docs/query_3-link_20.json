        "text": "The Edmonton Oilers recently won 16 consecutive games but ultimately fell short of the NHL record. The Vegas Golden Knights broke Edmonton's winning streak on Feb. 6, therefore holding the Oilers to the second spot among the longest such streaks in league history. What other teams are on the list?\n\n17 wins: 1992-93 Pittsburgh Penguins\n\nThe Penguins' winning streak lasted from March 9, 1993, to April 10, 1993, but they ultimately tied the New Jersey Devils 6-6 in the final game of the regular season. Led by Mario Lemieux, the Penguins would finish with a 56-21-7 record (119 points) and win their division. In the playoffs, they advanced to the division finals, where they lost to the New York Islanders in seven games. This team featured six future Hall of Famers: Lemieux, Ron Francis, Larry Murphy, Joe Mullen, Tom Barrasso and Jaromir Jagr (who will be inducted as soon as he's done playing).\n\n16 wins: 2023-24 Edmonton Oilers\n\nThe Oilers' streak began on Dec. 21. They were one victory away from tying the record when the Vegas Golden Knights stole their thunder on Feb. 6. The Oilers, who opened the season 3-9-1 before firing coach Jay Woodcroft on Nov. 12, were just 13-15-1 before their streak started. Edmonton hadn't lost a game since Dec. 19 and improved its record to 29-16-1 during its prime performance window.\n\n16 wins: 2016-17 Columbus Blue Jackets\n\nDuring the 2016-17 season, the Blue Jackets went undefeated from Nov. 29, 2016, through Jan. 3, 2017, including a perfect 14-0-0 record in Dec. However, the Washington Capitals ended their streak on Jan. 5, 2017, with a 5-0 win over the Blue Jackets. Columbus would finish the season 50-24-8 (108 points), which was the third-best record in the Metropolitan Division. In the playoffs, the Blue Jackets were eliminated by the Penguins in the first round (4-1).\n\n15 wins: 1981-82 New York Islanders\n\nThe Islanders were undefeated from Jan. 21, 1982, through Feb. 20, 1982. The Islanders finished the season with a 54-16-10 record (118 points), which ranked first in the Patrick Division. Unlike the other teams on this list, their regular-season success translated to the playoffs, as they would go on to win the Stanley Cup over the Vancouver Canucks (4-0). They lost just two games during their entire postseason run. This team featured five future Hall of Famers: Mike Bossy, Bryan Trottier, Clark Gillies, Denis Potvin and Billy Smith.\n\n15 wins: 2012-13 Pittsburgh Penguins\n\nDuring the lockout-shortened season, the Penguins went undefeated from March 2, 2013, through March 30, 2013. Led by Sidney Crosby, Pittsburgh won 15 straight games before losing 4-1 to the Buffalo Sabres on April 2, 2013. The Penguins finished the season with a 36-12-0 record (72 points), which was the best in the Atlantic Division. Pittsburgh ultimately advanced to the conference finals, where they were swept by the Bruins."
