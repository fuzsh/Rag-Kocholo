        "text": "As the 2024-25 season approaches, the Boston Bruins have created competition for a few roster spots. Second-line right-wing and fourth-line forwards are needed, and several players will compete to crack the lineup on opening night. Training camp will also showcase several prospects in the Bruins’ system as the organization looks to replenish a recently depleted prospect pool. The Bruins Benders Podcast has ranked the top 30 Bruins’ prospects, and here is the countdown, beginning with the bottom ten rated from 30 to 26.\n\n30 – Jake Schmaltz – Forward – University of North Dakota (NCAA)\n\nSchmaltz was a seventh-round draft pick in 2019 and is entering his senior season as an assistant captain at the University of North Dakota. The 23-year-old scored one goal with ten assists in 36 games last season. The 6-foot-2, 185-pound left wing will need a more productive offensive season to be considered a candidate to sign with Boston after his collegiate season.\n\n29 – Jonathan Morello – Center – Dubuque Fighting Saints (USHL)\n\nMorello was a fifth-round draft pick in the 2024 NHL Draft and has potential as a fast-skating center with size. The 18-year-old center had a productive season with the St. Michael’s Buzzers in the Ontario Junior Hockey League with 57 points in 50 games last season. The 6-foot-3 Morello participated in the 2024 Junior All-Star hockey tournament where he was awarded the title of fastest skater. After next season, Morello will attend Clarkson University.\n\n28 – Ryan Mast – Defenseman – Maine Mariners (ECHL)\n\nMast was a sixth-round draft pick in 2021 and is in the third year of his three-year entry-level contract with Boston. Mast played just seven games with the Providence Bruins in the AHL last season and was pointless with a minus-5. In 47 games with the Maine Mariners of the ECHL, the 6-foot-5, 220-pound blue liner contributed five goals and 11 assists. Maine looks like the destination again during the 2024-25 season as there doesn’t seem to be room in Providence. Mast could be playing out the string with Boston.\n\n27 – Drew Bavaro – Defenseman – Providence Bruins (AHL)\n\nBavaro was signed as a college free agent for the 2024-25 season for $867,500 by Boston on March 12. The 24-year-old defenseman played seven games for Providence on an Amateur Tryout Contract last season and projects to play there again this year. The 6-foot-2, 200-pound blue liner played two seasons at Bentley University and two seasons at Notre Dame. Last season, Bavaro scored ten goals with ten assists in 35 games with the Fighting Irish.\n\n26 – Jaxon Nelson – Forward – Providence Bruins (AHL)\n\nLike Bavaro, Nelson was signed by Boston for the 2024-25 season after five seasons at the University of Minnesota. The 6-foot-4, 220-pound center had a breakout season for the Gophers last season with 19 goals and 12 assists in 39 games. After signing with the Bruins, Nelson registered one goal in seven games. The Magnolia, Minnesota native is one of the most prolific offensive players in Minnesota high school history and totaled 113 points in 25 games with Luverne High School during the 2015-16 season. Nelson will play with Providence this season."
