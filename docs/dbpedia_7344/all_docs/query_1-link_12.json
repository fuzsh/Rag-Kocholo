        "text": "Get Ready to Play – Our Way!\n\nMighty Penguins Sled Hockey is a fun, therapeutic and competitive program for physically disabled children and adults. We aim to develop character, sportsmanship and physical fitness – while promoting and encouraging both educational and cultural experiences.\n\nOur Mission\n\nMighty Penguins Sled Hockey operates therapeutic and competitive ice hockey programs for the benefit of physically disabled individuals in Pennsylvania and adjacent areas.\n\nWe strive to:\n\ndevelop character, sportsmanship and physical fitness among the disabled adults and youth of Pennsylvania and adjacent areas while promoting and encouraging both educational and social experiences;\n\npromote, encourage and improve the standard of sled hockey, and support and develop athletics on a local, state and national level\n\nconduct a sled hockey program consistent with the rules and regulations of USA Hockey, Inc.; the Mid-American District Hockey Association; and, as consistent as practicable, with rules and regulations of any successor(s) to the above;\n\nperform or participate in such other educational activities as may be necessary to facilitate the achievement of the foregoing purposes.\n\nHistory\n\nIn the early 1960’s, the sport of sled hockey was developed at a rehabilitation center in Stockholm, Sweden by a group who, despite their physical impairment, wanted to continue playing hockey. Today, sled hockey is a fast-growing internationally recognized sport and a key event in the Paralympic games.\n\nIt provides a means for physically challenged individuals to play competitive ice hockey. Getting a good workout, building self-esteem and being part of a team are just a few of the benefits of sled hockey!\n\nSled Hockey in Pittsburgh\n\nIn 1998, volunteers from Shriner’s Hospital for Children in Erie introduced the sport of sled hockey to Pittsburgh and the Mighty Penguins were born! Initially the goal was to provide children and young adults with physical disabilities the opportunity to participate in a competitive sport. The parents and guardians of these players have seen firsthand the physical and emotional benefits of the program. Many local organizations have helped our program by donating ice time, equipment, customized hockey gear and insurance. Individuals throughout the Greater Pittsburgh area volunteer their time and talents to educate and assist our players.\n\nAchievements\n\nThe Mighty Penguins continue to build on this existing foundation of support by increasing player involvement and expanding the number of teams competing locally and nationally. This past season, the Mighty Penguins registered on its roster various teams that included Youth Novice, Junior Gold, Junior Black, Adult Gold, Adult Black, and competitive Senior Team. These teams competed in tournaments throughout Canada and the United States.\n\nPlayers on the team are achieving tremendous success and recognition nationally and internationally. While playing for the Mighty Penguins, Josh Wirt became a 2002 Paralympic Gold Medalist. In addition to playing with the Mighty Penguins, Daniel McCoy won the gold medal at the 2014 Paralympic Winter Games in Sochi, Russia with the USA National Men’s Team. Nevin Gray was selected for the 2010 USA Junior National Team. Kelsey DiClaudio has been selected for the USA National Women’s Team as well as the USA National Development Team! Harrison Burgess was first named to the USA National Men’s Development Team in 2017. Most recently, Kaden Herchenroether was selected for the USA National Women’s Team in 2021.\n\nToday and Beyond\n\nThe Mighty Penguins sled hockey team was founded in 1998. We have grown over the years and are proud to include over 70 players of all ages on various teams. We continue to provide opportunities to our amazing athletes of all abilities. The Mighty Penguins are excited to share home ice with the Pittsburgh Penguins at the UPMC Lemieux Sports Complex!\n\nREAD ABOUT OUR ORGANIZATION WATCH THE VIDEO"
