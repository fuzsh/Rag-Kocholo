        "text": "Welcome to the second part of the July mailbag.\n\nLots of fun questions in this go-around, including some hypotheticals that are good for daydreaming, if nothing else.\n\nMay your summers be going safely and with an abundance of good times.\n\nAway we go…\n\n(Some questions have been lightly edited for style and clarity.)\n\nBased not only on what Kyle Dubas has said, but also on his track record with the Maple Leafs and what he has done in his short time here, how long will it be until the Penguins are competitive again? — @PeteKadar\n\nThe key here, Pete, is your definition of “competitive.” Could they sneak into the playoffs next year? Sure. Sometimes expectations are exceeded. And it’s not like they’re terrible.\n\nWhen can they be Stanley Cup competitive? I have to think they’re four or five years away from that, realistically speaking. They need a group of young players to come along. Not just one or two. A group. And they have to have some special players in that mix.\n\nIdeally, Sidney Crosby is still something of a force when those kids show up. It would be the fairytale ending to his career, graybeard Sid leading a bunch of kids to the promised land. It’s not an impossible dream. But Dubas has to go on a heater in the next couple of years.\n\nDo you think Tristan Jarry can win back his teammates after last season, when he gave some of them a look after allowing a goal? — @paulmcd1232\n\nI don’t know that he has to. I do know that many in the organization were fuming after the game in Dallas on March 22, when Jarry stared down Marcus Pettersson following a Stars goal. It’s not the first time he’s done stuff like that, and it doesn’t reek of accountability. Goalies do this a lot. Henrik Lundqvist was infamous for it. While it didn’t go over well with some in the organization, I honestly don’t know how the locker room feels about Jarry. I know of a couple of players who didn’t care for him many years ago, but I’ve not heard a bad word about him from the current team.\n\nJosh, do you think the Pens have a shot at the postseason next season and a chance to be really competitive in a year or two? — @MarcieWodlinger\n\nI wouldn’t bet on them making the playoffs, though nothing is impossible. On paper, the Rangers, Hurricanes and Devils are clearly better than the Penguins, in my opinion. So that theoretically leaves them fighting for a wild-card spot. The thing is, the middle of the Eastern Conference is terrible. Look at the Islanders, Capitals, Red Wings, Sabres, etc. … do any of those teams scare you? So sure, they could get in, but they’d have to stay healthy and receive top-notch goaltending.\n\nYou can remake one draft choice over the last 15 years. The player has to be available at the Penguins drafting position. Who are you taking? — @JakeEGraham\n\nI’ve got to look at 2014. The Penguins took Kasperi Kapanen with the No. 22 pick.\n\nThree picks later, the Bruins selected David Pastrnak.\n\nI don’t think a further explanation is required.\n\nBonus pick: They took Derrick Pouliot with the No. 8 pick in 2012 with Filip Forsberg on the board. Good God.\n\nHave you ever met a more superstitious athlete than Sid? — @jlhorn33\n\nHere’s the thing: They’re all superstitious. We just talk about him so much more than we talk about other players.\n\nThat said, his superstitions are great and I like how miffed he becomes when others aren’t superstitious to his level. Case in point, during his brief stint with the Penguins, Ryan Reaves scored a goal on the same day in which he accidentally left his garage door open while departing for the game. Upon hearing this, Crosby looked at him and said, “Well, are you leaving it open tonight?”\n\nReaves said no. Crosby looked at him like he was crazy.\n\nDo you think Erik Karlsson will be more comfortable in Year 2 in Pittsburgh? What kind of year do you think he’s capable of having? — @the_dzarina\n\nHe’s absolutely capable of more. Gauging his 2023-24 season is difficult. The analytics said one thing, the eye test said another. I know this much: He’s absolutely capable of more. I think he’s an on-ice genius who isn’t easy to coach, and I imagine fitting in with a new team and system is difficult for him because he plays the game like such of a free bird.\n\nHis teammates absolutely love him. Great guy, the kind of fellow you’d want to have a drink with. I think he’s a candidate for a bounce-back year, and having David Quinn on board should help. Karlsson needs to remember that he’s Erik Karlsson and stop deferring to Crosby and Evgeni Malkin so much. They’re great. They’ll figure out what he’s doing. He just needs to be more aggressive and do the things that make him special, because he is special.\n\nWith Connor McDavid available in two years, will Dubas and Crosby try to pitch him signing in Pittsburgh? Cap room, Evgeni Malkin off the books? — @BryanBorowitz\n\nWell that would be a story!\n\nPittsburgh makes sense for McDavid in some ways. He’s from Toronto, which is only a five-hour drive from here. He played his junior hockey two hours away in Erie. The Penguins have a rich, almost incomparable history of being an organization successfully run by superstar players. So, sure, I bet Pittsburgh would be high on his list, especially if, say, he and Crosby were to develop a friendship during international competitions in each of the next two seasons. (I am not suggesting that they aren’t pals, I just don’t think they know each other all that well.)\n\nThat said, it’s hard to imagine that the supporting cast in Pittsburgh two years from now is one that would intrigue McDavid. Although I don’t know this, and it’s 100 speculation on my part, I always suspected that GMJR had some kind of a post-Malkin mega-plan, and I always wondered if luring McDavid to Pittsburgh was part of it.\n\nWhen you first started reporting, how did you go about building trust with higher-ups for them to leak information through you as a liaison to fans? — @WatchPGHSports\n\nI’d love to give you a detailed answer, but so much of it is just being around, seeing your name grow. Then, they know who you are. Then you start to talk with people, get to know them. They trust you or they don’t. Treat them well and don’t backstab them, and you’ll probably get some stories. They’re people. Treat them the way you’d like to be treated.\n\nWith Pennsylvania getting new license plates featuring the Liberty Bell, should Western Pennsylvania be represented by getting a version with the Stanley Cup? — @slf66\n\nThis is one of the best questions I’ve ever received. And I really think you’re onto something here.\n\nWho is your pro comparison with Brayden Yager? — @SeagerBombs\n\nRemember Michael Ryder? Played for the Canadiens and some other teams. He had that great shot, a right-handed guy. Scored 30 goals a handful of times. That’s the name that comes to mind when I read this question.\n\nSeems like we might have an abundance of goalie talent in the pipeline. With Sergei Murashov showing up, how do you see the future between the pipes in Pittsburgh? — @hennessey27\n\nTough to say, but I’m glad you asked about him. Man is he talented. He’s quite an athlete and I think he’s someone to watch. He won’t be ready for the NHL for a year or two, but I happen to think he’s a legitimate NHL talent. I don’t give Ron Hextall credit for a ton, but that was a good draft pick.\n\nIs there any reason to think this time will be different for the Pirates? Should we have any hope that Paul Skenes won’t be out of here in four or five years like Gerrit Cole was? — @jtgensler\n\nI don’t trust Bob Nutting any further than I can throw him. I pulled a muscle in my side the other day, so I couldn’t throw anyone very far. So, yeah, your question is understandable.\n\nI hate that any time I tweet about Skenes, everyone responds, “He’ll be with the Yankees or Dodgers soon enough.” It’s annoying, but it’s also likely accurate, so I understand the fan rage.\n\nLet’s just enjoy him while he’s here. You win championships with pitchers like him. It sounds silly saying that about the Pirates, I know, but this guy is different. Hopefully they quickly build a team around him.\n\nIf you were a closer in baseball, what song are you walking out to? — @cwhitney29\n\n“Sex and Candy” by Marcy Playground. I think creeping out the other hitters would be a good tactic.\n\nWhat’s your favorite thing to do in the offseason? — @stefdin\n\nSpend time with my kids, and get my toes in the sand at some point. I’m trying to learn to be a good cook, too. Any pointers are appreciated.\n\nHope all is well, everyone.\n\n(Photo: Matthew Stockman / Getty Images)"
