The trophies will be on display from the start of the first intermission to the end of the second intermission.\n\nThe game will be televised nationally by NBCSN and carried on radio by WXDX-FM (105.9 The X) and the Penguins Radio Network.\n\nFans also are encouraged to stop at Dunkin’ Donuts stores on Wednesday to pick up a free “Driven for More” window cling (while they last). Dunkin’ Donuts also will be offering an 87-cent medium coffee on Wednesday!"
