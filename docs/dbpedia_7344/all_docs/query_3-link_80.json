        "text": "Early Wednesday morning, coach Mike Tomlin announced that seven of his most established veteran players would not participate in the Pittsburgh Steelers’ preseason opener Friday. Ninety minutes later, though, six of those seven took part in a fully-padded, tackling-allowed practice at Saint Vincent College.\n\nTomlin said that quarterback Russell Wilson, guard Isaac Seumalo, defensive lineman Cameron Heyward, safety Minkah Fitzpatrick and linebackers Patrick Queen, T.J. Watt and Alex Highsmith would not be in uniform for Friday’s 7 p.m. exhibition against the Houston Texans at Acrisure Stadium.\n\n“Those guys are veteran guys,” Tomlin said in explaining his excusing them from game action. “They know what they’re doing.”\n\nAll but Highsmith were on Chuck Noll Field taking part in drills Wednesday. And with the exception of Fitzpatrick, all were regulars with the first-team offense or defense when full-team periods began. As has often been custom for much of this camp, Fitzpatrick rotated in to 11-on-11 and seven-on-seven drills as practice wore on.\n\nHighsmith left Tuesday’s practice early because of a groin injury.\n\nSeumalo has taken multiple days off during camp. Wilson suffered a calf injury on reporting day, and along with Heyward are the oldest players on the team. Queen had missed multiple recent practices because of an apparent minor lower-body injury.\n\n“It’s just going to provide additional opportunity for others that I know less about and maybe need more runway from a preparation standpoint,” Tomlin said.\n\nFurther injuries\n\nReserve safety Nathan Meadors (hamstring) joined Highsmith as sitting out Wednesday’s practice.\n\nDefensive lineman Breiden Fehoko and safety DeShon Elliott left the practice early because of what appeared to be minor injuries.\n\nIn addition to Queen and Seumalo, defensive back Grayland Arnold, outside linebacker Jeremiah Moon and defensive linemen DeMarvin Leal and Keeanu Benton returned to practice after missing time because of ailments.\n\nAye, aye, Aiyuk\n\nTomlin, predictably, did not address the omnipresent rumors around the team regarding a potential trade for star San Francisco 49ers wide receiver Brandon Aiyuk.\n\nAsked during his news conference if the Steelers were looking to add a wide receiver, Tomlin responded: “I’ll let you guys (media) speculate on that.”\n\nJust prior to that, Tomlin expanded on what he liked about the team’s WR corps as presently constructed."
