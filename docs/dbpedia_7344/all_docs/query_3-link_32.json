        "text": "The Columbus Blue Jackets’ winning streak ended at 16 games with a 5-0 loss to the Capitals in Washington on Thursday night.\n\nBefore the game, Capitals forward Andre Burakovsky told reporters that it was “going to be a really fun moment for us” to end Columbus’s streak. And Washington, which finished with the league’s best record last season, wasted little time, taking a 2-0 lead in the first 12 minutes.\n\nLater, Burakovsky even got in on the action, scoring Washington’s fourth goal late in the second period."
