        "text": "Day 3 of the World Junior Summer Showcase in Plymouth, Michigan is a wrap – and the United States have finally been defeated, losing 5-3 to Finland in USA’s first game as a single unit.\n\nFinland opened the scoring quickly with a redirect from Emil Kuusla just under two minutes into the game. The lead didn’t last long though as Chris Pelosi was able to find the back of the net for USA. But that was just the beginning of a multi-goal first period as Kuusla fired home his second of the night to give Finland the lead again, only for it to be squashed by New York Islanders prospect Cole Eiserman.\n\nThanks to work between the pipes from USA’s Nick Kempf and Finland’s Visa Vedenpaa, the second period almost ended scoreless. However, Topias Hynninen broke the tie midway through the second. Rasmus Kumpulainen and Jesse Nurmi both scored in the third to offset Max Plante’s goal, giving Finland their first win of the tournament.\n\nHere’s a look at the top performers from both teams from the lone game in Plymouth on Wednesday:\n\nUSA\n\n#38 Cole Eiserman, RW (New York Islanders): Eiserman gave the Americans life in the first period tying the game at 2-2 after a beautiful one-timer on a feed from 2025 prospect James Hagens. Eiserman has been lethal in all international competitions thus far and should be a key piece of the main team come December.\n\n#12 James Hagens, C (2025): Another day, another dominating performance. Hagens forced a turnover and put together a one-timer for the American sniper Eiserman in the first. Hagens had a few good looks as he looked to carry a lot of the load today, and it was good to see him share some chemistry with his former USNTDP teammate, Eiserman.\n\n#20 Chris Pelosi, C (Boston Bruins): Pelosi played his best game today, picking up a quick goal to tie the game 1-1 on a feed down the middle from Philadelphia Flyers prospect Noah Powell. Pelosi was able to rifle home the one-timer from the slot, showing he knows a thing or two about shooting the disk. He added an assist to the board on a goal from Max Plante late in the third. The Bruins prospect was fast and energetic throughout the game on a line that featured Brandon Svobodoa and Powell.\n\nFinland\n\n#24 Jesse Nurmi, C (New York Islanders): After a two-point game on Monday, Nurmi continued with another multi-point effort in today’s matchup against the USA. He assisted on Kussla’s first goal, making a pass to Kalle Kangas, who was able to fire a shot off. Nurmi again found the scoresheet in the first period assisting on Kuusla’s second goal. Nurmi added a goal to the sheet late in the third on an empty net.\n\n#25, Emil Kuusla, LW: – Kussla was rock solid for the Finns’ opening the scoring and again adding another to the scoresheet in the first period. The 19-year-old was dominant and looks to be an impact player Finland can rely on in December. Kuusla then found the scoresheet again, this time picking up an apple on Topias Hynninen’s goal late in the second period.\n\n#6 Kalle Kangas, D (Pittsburgh Penguins): Kangas again had a pair of assists for the Finns. He was also involved in some physical play and scrums, one specifically near the end of the second period which found him in the box for roughing. Kangas now has four points and is off to a good start at the showcase, which is huge.\n\n#30 Visa Vedenpaa, G (Seattle Kraken): Vedenpaa was solid throughout the entire game. The 19-year-old Finnish netminder earned Finland their first win of the Summer Showcase, stopping 38 of 41 shots. Vedenpaa stopped all 18 shots he faced in the second period as the Americans pounced, and even tested him on a couple of power plays. With the win tonight, Vedenpaa may have locked himself on the roster this winter.\n\nWin One of 98 Exclusive Gatorade Bottles Signed by Connor Bedard\n\nGatorade Canada is proud to announce its newest roster expansion with the NHL’s Calder Trophy Winner, Connor Bedard.
