        "text": "The 2024-25 NHL season is less than two months away, with training camps starting in about a month. Many Unrestricted Free Agents (UFA’s) remain on the market including several former Washington Capitals players. These players could be reaching the end of their NHL careers, especially those over 30 years old.\n\nMax Pacioretty, Left Wing – Pacioretty played with the Washington Capitals in 2023-24 season, where he played in 47 games, scoring 4 goals and recording 19 assists. His production was below his career norms, as he was still recovering from his second Achilles tendon tear since 2022.\n\nBefore joining the Capitals, he spent 10 seasons with the Montreal Canadiens, his drafting team, four seasons with the Las Vegas Knights, and one injury-plagued season with the Carolina Hurricanes.\n\nDuring his career, he scored 30 or more goals six times and topped 20 goals in two more seasons. Given he is now 35 years old and has had two Achilles tendon injuries, teams are hesitant to sign him. If he can’t even get a PTO offer, he will likely retire.\n\nKevin Shattenkirk, Defenseman – Shattenkirk played with the Capitals during the 2016-17 season after being acquired at the trade deadline, scoring 2 goals and recording 12 assists in 19 games.\n\nHe started his career with the Colorado Avalanche before being traded to the St. Louis Blues where he spent 7 seasons. He also played with the New York Rangers, Tampa Bay Lightning, Anaheim Ducks, and Boston Bruins.\n\nShattenkirk spent last season with the Bruins, playing in 61 games, scored 6 goals and recorded 18 assists. He has been a good offensive defenseman throughout his career. His age, 35, is working against him for contract offers. He might get a PTO offer from a team in time for training camp or if a team is short on defensemen due to injuries. If he can’t get an NHL offer, he could continue his career in Europe, such as the Swiss National League.\n\nJustin Schultz, Defenseman – Schultz played with the Capitals during the 2020-2021 and 2021-22 seasons after signing with the team as a free agent. He played in 120 games with the Capitals during that time frame where he scored 7 goals and recorded 43 assists.\n\nBefore the Capitals, Schiltz played with the Edmonton Oilers and Pittsburgh Penguins. After leaving the Capitals, he played with the Seattle Kraken. Like Shattenkirk, his age, 34, is working against him for getting contract offers.\n\nHis odds should be better than Shattenkirk’s since he is a year younger and brings a little more offense to the table. Like Shattenkirk, he might get a PTO offer from a team in time for training camp or if a team is short on defensemen due to injuries. If he can’t get an NHL offer, he could continue his career in Europe, such as the Swiss National League.\n\nJakub Vrana, Left Wing – The Capitals drafted Vrana in the first round of the 2014 NHL Draft with the 13th pick overall. He played with the Capitals from 2016-17 through 2020-21 when he was traded to the Detroit Red Wings at the trading deadline. During his time with the Capitals, he played in 284 games, scored 76 goals, and recorded 81 assists. He was a member of their Stanley Cup-winning team in 2018. His best season with the Capitals was in 2019-20 when he scored 25 goals and 27 assists.\n\nSince leaving the Capitals, he played for the Red Wings and St. Louis Blues. Although he is only 28, his NHL career is likely finished as he finished the 2023-24 season with the Blues’ AHL affiliate, the Springfield Thunderbirds. He had produced well initially after joining the Red Wings but went into the NHL Player Assistance Program early in the 2022-23 season and was sent to the minor leagues after being released from it. He was traded to the Blues, and started well after the trade, but slumped early in 2023-24 and was sent to the AHL. If he wishes to continue his hockey career, it will likely be with the Czech League or another European League.\n\nMatt Irwin, Defenseman – The Capitals had signed Irwin in free agency before the 2021-22 season. He spent two seasons with them where he played in 78 games, scoring 3 goals with 6 assists., playing the bulk of his games during 2022-23. Before playing with the Capitals, he had played with the San Jose Sharks, Boston Bruins, Nashville Predators, and Buffalo Sabres. Last season, he had signed a one-year two-way contract with the Vancouver Canucks but spent the entire season in the minor leagues. As he is now 36 years old and spent no time in the NHL last season, he is likely finished in the NHL. His options for continuing his career are to sign another two-way contract, an AHL contract, or play in a European league.\n\nLucas Johansen, Defenseman – The Capitals drafted Johansen in the first round of the 2016 NHL Draft with the 26th pick overall. He had numerous injuries throughout his professional career and did not make his debut with the Capitals until the 2021-22 season when he played one game. He ultimately played in 9 NHL games with the Capitals. Given that he’s now 26 years old and had played less than 80 games in the NHL, he is now a Group 6 Unrestricted Free Agent. His next professional contract will likely be either a two-way contract or an AHL-only contract unless he chooses to play hockey in Europe.\n\nMatthew Phillips, Right Wing – The Capitals signed Phillips in free agency before the 2023-24 season when the Calgary Flames did not give him a qualifying offer. He played in 28 games for the Capitals, scoring 1 goal and recording 4 assists in 28 games. As his offensive production disappointed, the Capitals waived him and sent him to the Hershey Bears. His next professional contract will likely be either a two-way contract or an AHL-only contract unless he chooses to play hockey in Europe.\n\nBy Diane Doyle"
