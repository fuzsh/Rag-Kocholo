        "text": "The Pittsburgh Penguins (14-8-4) travel to face the St. Louis Blues (16-5-6) at Enterprise Center Saturday at 8 p.m. ET. We analyze the Penguins-Blues odds and lines while providing NHL betting tips around this matchup.\n\nPenguins at Blues: Projected starting goalies\n\nMatt Murray vs. Jordan Binnington\n\nMurray has a 9-4-4 record for Pittsburgh with a 2.72 goals against average and .901 save percentage. Murray was rested Friday night to start against St. Louis. He attempts to rebound after getting pulled against the Vancouver Canucks Wednesday night after allowing four goals on 14 shots.\n\nBinnington has 12 wins in 20 starts (12-4-4). He was rested for Jake Allen Friday. Overall, he has a 2.27 GAA with a .925 save percentage. Binnington won his last start against the Tampa Bay Lightning, stopping 32 of 35 shots in a 4-3 win.\n\nBetMGM BLACK FRIDAY SPECIAL\n\nBET $1, WIN $250 in free bets if ANY NFL team scores a touchdown Sunday, Dec. 1, 2019. Bet now and win!\n\nVisit BetMGM for terms and conditions.\n\nPenguins at Blues: Odds, picks and betting tips\n\nOdds courtesy of BetMGM; access them at USA TODAY Sports for a full set of today’s betting odds. Odds last updated at 7:55 a.m. ET.\n\nPrediction\n\nBlues 3, Penguins 2\n\nMoneyline (ML)\n\nThe BLUES (-129) and Penguins both played Friday night so this is a textbook “sludge” matchup. At least St. Louis is the home team and mostly explains why they are a small favorite on the moneyline. Also, Binnington has shown better form than Murray of late.\n\nA $10 bet with St. Louis results in a $7.75 profit with an outright win for the Blues.\n\nPuck Line/Against the Spread (ATS)\n\nBoth teams are under .500 against the spread. Pittsburgh is 11-15 while St. Louis is 12-14. AVOID.\n\nOver/Under (O/U)\n\nThe UNDER 5.5 (+125) carries some risk but does have a solid plus number worthy of a small wager. St. Louis tends to play more defensive on the back end of back-to-backs. The wise move is to take the Under and try not to overthink it.\n\nPlacing a $10 bet here will give a bettor a $12.50 profit with a total of five or fewer goals scored.\n\nWant some action on this matchup?
