        "text": "Dilip Vishwanat/Getty Images\n\nPlaying well in March is important for every team in the NHL.\n\nFor the bottom-feeders, it's about respectability.\n\nFor the middle of the pack, it's about trying to make the playoffs.\n\nAnd for the cream of the crop, it's all about positioning yourself well in the playoffs with the highest possible seeding.\n\n1. St. Louis Blues (Last week: No. 3)\n\nDon't think coaching matters in hockey?\n\nExhibit A: 2012 St. Louis Blues. Ken Hitchcock has elevated this team to the highest point in the NHL. Let's not forget that the Blues are also in the NHL's most difficult division. Four out of five teams in the Central are probably going to make the playoffs.\n\nThe Blues already have their highest point total since the 2003-04 season.\n\nThe team doesn't have a major scoring threat. No one on the team has over 50 points, yet their defense and goaltending is superb enough to lead them to the promised land.\n\n2. Pittsburgh Penguins (Last week: No. 6)\n\nThe Penguins are the hottest team in the league and they're about to get Sidney Crosby back very soon. He's only going to make this team even more dangerous. They've won eight in a row but they have a series of tough games coming up this week against the Bruins, Rangers, Devils and Flyers.\n\nMarc-Andre Fleury has been a major part of the Pens' success. He's made timely saves and because of him, the Penguins now have a higher point differential than than the Rangers. They've also beat them twice in the last two meetings, elevating them in front of New York in the rankings.\n\n3. New York Rangers (Last week: No. 1)\n\nThat comfortable nine-point lead in the Eastern Conference is down to four. The Rangers came up empty-handed in this week's three-game road swing, losing to the Devils, Senators and Blackhawks.\n\nThat said, they have a seven-game home stand coming up in the next two weeks. Hopefully for the Rangers they'll use this homestand to extend their lead over the Penguins.\n\n4. Vancouver Canucks (Last week: No. 2)\n\nRoberto Luongo's inconsistencies continue. He can't be getting pulled against the Buffalo Sabres and follow up that lackluster performance by letting four pucks go through against the Dallas Stars.\n\nThey still have three more games on their seven-game homestand. Luongo needs to figure it out, because the Canuck fans don't want a repeat of last year's Stanley Cup Final in this year's playoffs.\n\n5. Detroit Red Wings (Last week: No. 4)\n\nWhile St. Louis has nobody over 50 points on offense, the Red Wings have four guys hovering over the 50-point mark. And with Jimmy Howard a wall in net, the Wings have the highest point differential. This team isn't fazed by the Blues. They're going to make an effort to win the division and the West.\n\n6. Boston Bruins (Last week: No. 5)\n\nThe Bruins may be the best built team for the playoffs, but they're just 12-12-1 since January 14. Perhaps they're just getting complacent waiting for April.\n\n7. Nashville Predators (Last week: No. 7)\n\nThe Predators finally lost in regulation at home to the Los Angeles Kings.\n\nPerhaps some help from Alex Radulov in the KHL on the way?\n\n8. Philadelphia Flyers (Last week: No. 9)\n\nIlya Bryzgalov has opponents saying, \"Why you have to be so good all of a sudden?\"\n\nBryz had two shutouts in the last four games, but the quote of the week came from Jaromir Jagr when asked why he played when he had a hip injury.\n\n\"I had to play because there were no other Czechs. All of the Czechs were out and everybody knows if there are no Czechs in the game, it's kind of a boring game. It's like when you want to make food without salt, you know what I mean? I was pushed.\"\n\n9. Chicago Blackhawks (Last week: No. 11)\n\nThey may have lost to the Blues on the road, but they also beat the Red Wings and Rangers. They get another shot against St. Louis this week. Because of those two big wins, they're back in the top 10.\n\n10. New Jersey Devils (Last week: No. 10)\n\nWouldn't the Devils rather finish sixth in the East so they play Florida (or any other Southeast Division team) in the first round?\n\n11. Dallas Stars (Last week: No. 17)\n\nThe Stars are 8-0-1 in their last nine, propelling them to the top of the Pacific Division. We've noted weeks before that the Stars were struggling to find consistency throughout the season. They kept winning one and losing one.\n\nWell, it seems like they've figured that one out.\n\n12. Ottawa Senators (Last week: No. 13)\n\nThe Senators gained some confidence after beating down on the Rangers, 4-1. They're only three points behind the Boston and catching them is a conceivable task.\n\n13. Phoenix Coyotes (Last week: No. 8)\n\nAfter not losing in regulation in February, the Coyotes have yet to win in March.\n\n14. San Jose Sharks (Last week: No. 12)\n\nThe Sharks have lost 10 of their last 12. Fortunately for them, they still have a few games in hand against the Stars and are within striking distance for the division lead.\n\n15. Florida Panthers (Last week: No. 14)\n\nThe Panthers somehow have gone 1-3-1 in their last five yet taken control over first place in the Southeast. In that span, they lost 7-0 to Winnipeg and 5-0 to Philadelphia. They're a minus-27 overall in the season.\n\nSay hello to a quick first-round exit...\n\n16. Washington Capitals (Last week: No. 15)\n\nAll the Capitals need to do is get on a four- or five-game winning streak and they should wrap up the division. What is this team waiting for? Why are they having such difficulty in winning this weak division?\n\n17. Los Angeles Kings (Last week: No. 16)\n\nJeff Carter only has four points in his stint with the Kings so far. With all this talent, if Los Angeles doesn't make the playoffs, it's going to be a miserable failure for the organization.\n\n18. Calgary Flames (Last week: No. 19)\n\nAfter a rough end to February, the Flames have recorded points in four of their last five games and are only a point behind the eighth seed in the West.\n\n19. Winnipeg Jets (Last week: No. 20)\n\nThe Lakers of the NHL. Dominate at home, can't win on the road. That was the story for the week for the Jets as they won two home games, then lost two away from the MTS Centre.\n\n20. Buffalo Sabres (Last week: No. 23)\n\nIf the Sabres make the playoffs, watch out. They have the potential to knock off a No. 1 seed because of Ryan Miller and Jason Pominville.\n\nThat said, Ville Leino has to be the worst signing in a long time.\n\n21. Colorado Avalanche (Last week: No. 19)\n\nThe Avs only have 13 games left in the regular season. They're only a point behind the Sharks but they're really going to have to finish strong if they want to lock the final seed. Losing Matt Duchene doesn't help them either.\n\n22. Tampa Bay Lightning (Last week: No. 24)\n\nThe Bolts are just three points behind the No. 3 seed. They have the second-best player in the league so if they can just get some goaltending and if Steven Stamkos goes on a roll, we could see the Eastern Conference finalists from last year back in the thick of things.\n\n23. Anaheim Ducks (Last week: No. 22)\n\nFor a minute there the Ducks were making a huge run for the playoffs. Four key losses in the last two weeks have made that dream almost impossible. They'll probably need to win 11 of their last 14 if they're going to come close to making the playoffs.\n\n24. Toronto Maple Leafs (Last week: No. 21)\n\nThey're doing a good job in not being as bad as Montreal and Toronto recently.\n\n26. Carolina Hurricanes (Last week: No. 24)\n\nThe Hurricanes have yet to win in the shootout.\n\n27. Minnesota Wild (Last week: No. 26)\n\nThe Wild, along with the Kings, have proven that defense isn't going to win championships if you don't have at least some offense. (See St. Louis)\n\n28. Montreal Canadiens (Last week: No. 28)\n\nInteresting theory: Hockey-rabid cities aren't attracting any free agents because they're so crazy about hockey that it's an uncomfortable environment to play in.\n\nKind of explains Montreal's mediocrity in the past decade. Why would anyone want to play there? Being under that kind of microscope isn't worth it. Just ask Scott Gomez.\n\n29. Edmonton Oilers (Last week: No. 29)\n\nOne goalie away from making a run for the playoffs next year.\n\n30. Columbus Blue Jackets (Last week: No. 30)\n\nDeadline ends. Blue Jackets win four in a row. Watch them crush a few playoff hopefuls' dreams in the last month of the season."
