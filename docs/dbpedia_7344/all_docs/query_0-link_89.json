        "text": "After everything he has done in the NBA, point guard Kyrie Irving has definitely transcended borders by reaching a lot of people outside of the United States. Proof of his popularity is an insanely cool mural made in the Philippines, a work of art that prompted the Dallas Mavericks star visit it soon.\n\nIn the norther part of the Philippines, a basketball court has become a canvas to celebrate one of Irving’s most iconic moments as a Dallas Maverick. The artist, Maya Carandang, has taken it upon himself to honor the guard’s game-winning heroics against the Denver Nuggets, immortalizing the unforgettable left-handed floater as a mural on the court’s surface.\n\nThis project is part of Carandang’s ambitious goal to create 100 such basketball court murals across the Philippines, each one capturing the essence of the sport and its greatest moments. Irving’s shot, which propelled the Mavericks to a crucial victory last season, was an obvious choice for the inaugural work in this series.\n\nThe NBA superstar himself was quick to recognize and appreciate the artistic homage, praising the court’s colorful depiction of his clutch play. The one-time champion’s journey has been a rollercoaster in recent years, but his redemption arc with the Mavericks has solidified his status as a fan favorite once again. This mural serves as a testament to his resilience and the lasting impact he has had on the game.\n\nAlthough the mural itself is far away from Manila, the Philippines’ capital, Irving himself made a promise to visit it soon. In a post shared by ClutchPoints on X, the Dallas Mavericks star explained that all he needed was an invite to see the mural in person.\n\nOver the course of his 13-year run in the NBA , Irving has amassed an impressive resume playing for teams like Dallas, Cleveland Cavaliers, Boston Celtics, and Brooklyn Nets. During that period, he was won one championship, one All-Star Game MVP, Rookie of the Year in 2012, and eight All-Star Game selections, among others."
