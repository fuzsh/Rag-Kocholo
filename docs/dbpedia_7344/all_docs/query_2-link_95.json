        "text": "These are the professional hockey players you love to hate for all the right reasons.\n\nMost Hated Hockey Players of All Time\n\nWhen picking the most hated hockey players in National Hockey League (NHL) history, it’s a fine line between genuine hatred, downright jealousy and grudging respect.\n\nSo while some puckheads may not particularly care for Sidney Crosby, Gordie Howe, Mark Messier, Bob Probert, Maurice Richard and Scott Stevens, to name a few prominent lightning rods, we contend that there aren’t enough valid reasons for inclusion here.\n\nFear not, though, because there are plenty to include. Boston Bruins and Philadelphia Flyers fans are gonna particularly love this.\n\n50. Phil Kessel\n\nCareer: 17 seasons (2006-present)\n\nTeams: Boston Bruins (2006-09), Toronto Maple Leafs (2009-15), Pittsburgh Penguins (2015-19), Arizona Coyotes (2019-22), Vegas Golden Knights (2022-present)\n\nBottom Line: Phil Kessel\n\nAs you might have heard, Phil The Pill has a thing for hot dogs. This guy has never been in hockey shape in his life. He’s also extraordinarily aloof, grossly overpaid and Bounty soft — he averages one hit about every two hours on the ice.\n\n49. Alexander Semin\n\nCareer: 11 seasons (2003-04, 2006-16)\n\nTeams: Washington Capitals (2003-12), Carolina Hurricanes (2012-15), Montreal Canadiens (2015)\n\nBottom Line: Alexander Semin\n\nWhat do you call brain-dead penalties, half-assed effort and questionable injuries? The Alexander Semin hat trick, that’s what.\n\nAs ex-teammate Troy Brouwer once said, “Some nights you didn't even know if he was gonna come to the rink. It's tough to play alongside guys like those because you don't know what you're gonna get out of 'em.\"\n\n48. P.K. Subban\n\nCareer: 13 season (2010-22)\n\nTeams: Montreal Canadiens (2010-16), Nashville Predators (2016-19), New Jersey Devils (2019-22)\n\nCareer statistics: 834/115/351/905\n\nBottom Line: P.K. Subban\n\nSubban is (too) well known for his lust for attention and demonstrative ways. Sorry, brah, wrong sport.\n\nWorse yet, the guy has turned low hits into an art form, although he means no harm, of course. Opponents tend to not like that, you know.\n\n47. Steve Ott\n\nCareer: 14 seasons (2002-17)\n\nTeams: Dallas Stars (2002-12), Buffalo Sabres (2012-14), St. Louis Blues (2014-16), Detroit Red Wings (2016-17), Montreal Canadiens (2016-17)\n\nCareer statistics: 848/109/179/1,555\n\nBottom Line: Steve Ott\n\nOtt had value as a dogged defender, efficient face-off specialist and occasional scorer who could invade heads. But those traits were neutered by his nonstop chatter, all-too-frequent cheap shots and multiple suspensions.\n\nHe took on all lightweights but often turtled or hid behind referees against tough guys. Kind of like...\n\n46. Max Lapierre\n\nCareer: 10 seasons (2005-15)\n\nTeams: Montreal Canadiens (2005-10), Anaheim Ducks (2011), Vancouver Canucks (2011-13), St. Louis Blues (2013-15), Pittsburgh Penguins (2015)\n\nCareer statistics: 614/65/74/586\n\nBottom Line: Max Lapierre\n\nAt 6-foot-2, 215 pounds, yappy Lappy was a public nuisance of giant proportions. When the career fourth-liner didn’t piss off opponents with dives and insults, he rankled teammates with hit-and-run tactics that pushed them into the fire.\n\nBoston Bruins coach Mike Milbury called the guy a “punk,” and who would know better than him?\n\n45. Alex Burrows\n\nCareer: 13 seasons (2005-2018)\n\nTeams: Vancouver Canucks (2005-17), Ottawa Senators (2017-18)\n\nBottom Line: Alex Burrows\n\nThere have been a lot of Burrows in NHL history — aka low draft picks who feel that they have something to prove and will do virtually anything to leave their marks. It’s just that this psycho did it as well or better than anyone. Like when he bit the finger of future Hall of Famer Patrice Bergeron in a scrum, for instance.\n\nHe also could speak French and English, which made him one of the most versatile smack talkers ever.\n\n44. Esa Tikkanen\n\nCareer: 1985-99 (14 seasons)\n\nTeams: Edmonton Oilers (1985-93), New York Rangers (1993-94, 1999), St. Louis Blues (1994-96), Washington Capitals (1997-98)\n\nBottom Line: Esa Tikkanen\n\nTikkanen is one of the better two-way players on this list, but did he have to be such a supersized jerk about it? He wielded his stick like a samurai and chirped incessantly in Tikkanese. Not even his teammates knew what the hell came out of his potty mouth.\n\nAll of this made him the all-time pest that he was — The Grate One famously goaded The Great One (ex-teammate Wayne Gretzky) into a hissy fit — but he crossed the line more times than anyone could count.\n\n43. Patrick Kaleta\n\nCareer: 9 seasons (2006-15)\n\nTeams: Buffalo Sabres (2006-15)\n\nBottom Line: Patrick Kaleta\n\nKaleta was up to no good so often, he knew league police chief Brendan Shanahan on a first-name basis. He was especially nasty against the Philadelphia Flyers. The shortlist of victims: Mike Richards, Jared Ross, Nik Zherdev and Jakub Voracek.\n\nOh, and he trolled Danny Briere and Scott Hartnell about their broken marriages. Not exactly a nice guy.\n\n42. Steve Downie\n\nCareer: 9 seasons (2007-16)\n\nTeams: Philadelphia Flyers (2007-08, 2013-14), Tampa Bay Lightning (2008-12), Colorado Avalanche (2012-13), Pittsburgh Penguins (2014-15), Arizona Coyotes (2015-16)\n\nBottom Line: Steve Downie\n\nIf Downie had stuck to hockey, he might not have been out of the league at 28 years of age. But nooooo, he chose to be the worst kind of coward, the kind that purposely tries to injure people and blames others for his behavior.\n\nHis blindside that effectively shortened the career of Dean McAmmond and drew a 20-game suspension was beyond pathetic.\n\n41. Milan Lucic\n\nCareer: 16 seasons (2007-present)\n\nTeams: Boston Bruins (2007-15), Los Angeles Kings (2015-16), Edmonton Oilers (2016-19), Calgary Flames (2019-present)\n\nBottom Line: Milan Lucic\n\nIt wasn’t just that Lucic could beat opponents with a punch as well as a goal that pissed them off. It was also the way he went about his business. The big lug repeatedly crossed the line yet acted like some kind of moral authority.\n\nHis career lowlight came in a handshake line when he threatened to kill Dale Weise the next season. He owns the unofficial record for most testicular procedures performed with his stick in league history.\n\n40. Chris Neil\n\nCareer: 15 seasons (2001-17)\n\nTeams: Ottawa Senators (2001-17)\n\nBottom Line: Chris Neil\n\nNeil ranks 20th in penalty minutes on the all-time list, but the half-agitator-half-enforcer was dirty only about half the time. Rather, it was that toothless smirk of his that made opponents want to wring his thick neck.\n\nHe also was known to take on smaller players and avoid bigger ones, which led one-time teammate Brian McGrattan to complain, “I had to protect that guy for three years when I was there.”\n\n39. Jordin Tootoo\n\nCareer: 13 seasons (2003-17)\n\nTeams: Nashville Predators (2003-12), Detroit Red Wings (2012-14), 2014-16), Chicago Blackhawks (2016-17)\n\nBottom Line: Jordin Tootoo\n\nAt 5-foot-9, 195 pounds, Tootoo beat the odds with big hits and a small conscience. The guy had a huge Napoleon complex and the suspensions to prove it. The dirtball would hit high. He would hit low. He would hit head-on and behind the back.\n\nThunder even trucked 168-pound goalie Ryan Miller, for cripes sakes. Yes, more than one foe would tell that Tootoo was DooDoo.\n\n38. Bob Probert\n\nCareer: 16 seasons (1985-2002)\n\nTeams: Detroit Red Wings (1985-94), Chicago Blackhawks (1995-2002)\n\nBottom Line: Bob Probert\n\nThe fact that this all-time tough guy isn't too high on our list is an indication of his widespread respect as an honest brawler. He reached the 20-goal mark on two occasions and received votes for the Selke Trophy once.\n\nStill, the sight of a 6-foot-3, 225-pound hitman in an occasionally drug-altered state made for an enormous amount of fear and loathing around the league for more than a decade.\n\n37. Chris Nilan\n\nCareer: 15 seasons (1979-92)\n\nTeams: Montreal Canadiens (1979-88), New York Rangers (1988-90), Boston Bruins (1990-92)\n\nBottom Line: Chris Nilan\n\nWhat made Knuckles even more despised was that he played with the Canadiens, allegedly the standard for righteous play. Yeah, right.\n\nBoston Bruins fans really hated their native son (of an expletive). It got so bad that the Bs installed plexiglass to separate their bench from the runway to the locker room to discourage any more of his lunacy.\n\n36. John Scott\n\nCareer: 8 seasons (2009-15)\n\nTeams: Minnesota Wild (2009-10), Chicago Blackhawks (2010-12), New York Rangers (2012), Buffalo Sabres (2012-14), San Jose Sharks (2014-15), Arizona Coyotes (2015), Montreal Canadiens (2015)\n\nBottom Line: John Scott\n\nScott qualifies as the biggest goon in pucks' history in more ways than one — 6-foot-7.75 of violence and a quarter-inch of hockey skills. The guy averaged one goal every six hours, 46 minutes and 36 seconds that he was on the ice. (We're serious.)\n\nAll he did was skate in circles and pick fights, even one with pansy Phil Kessel of all people. We said Phil Kessel, people! Unfortunately, the result was not a double knockout.\n\n35. Lou Fontinato\n\nCareer: 9 seasons (1954-63)\n\nTeams: New York Rangers (1954-61), Montreal Canadiens (1961-63)\n\nBottom Line: Lou Fontinato\n\nAs the first player to reach 200 penalty minutes in one season, Leapin’ Louie dragged the enforcer role to a historic low. His short fuse and two-fisted talents incurred the wrath of opponents around the league.\n\nIt wasn’t until Gordie Howe turned his schnoz into an S-curve that the reign of terror finally came to an end.\n\n34. Rob Ray\n\nCareer: 15 seasons (1989-2004)\n\nTeams: Buffalo Sabres (1989-2003), Ottawa Senators (2003-04)\n\nBottom Line: Rob Ray\n\nThe Sabres have been one of the biggest jokes in pro sports for years, and this guy is the punch line. The stark raving lunatic amassed 3,207 penalty minutes, 41 goals, a minus-38 rating and zero Stanley Cups in his career.\n\nHis greatest achievement was the Rob Ray Rule, which required pugilists to keep their jerseys and shoulder pads buttoned down. Currently, he shares his thimbleful of hockey acumen on team telecasts, and boy, are we the lucky ones or what?\n\n33. Evander Kane\n\nCareer: 14 seasons (2009-present)\n\nTeams: Atlanta Thrashers (2009-11), Winnipeg Jets (2011-15), Buffalo Sabres (2015-18), San Jose Sharks (2018-21), Edmonton Oilers (2021-present)\n\nBottom Line: Evander Kane\n\nMention his name in league circles, and “bad guy” are the two words that you’ll hear most often.\n\nAfter he signed with his third team in five years amid massive gambling debts and accusations of violence against women, broadcaster Jeff O’Neill summed up the situation thusly: “If the guy’s a total idiot and a goof and a jerk, no matter what happens, everyone is going to hate his guts.”\n\n32. Andrew Shaw\n\nCareer: 10 seasons (2011-21)\n\nTeams: Chicago Blackhawks (2011-16, 2019-21), Montreal Canadiens (2016-2019)\n\nBottom Line: Andrew Shaw\n\nThis public nuisance had few fans around the league for starters, but when he called out the entire gay and lesbian community, his name had a permanent spot on this list. The moment of truth came in the 2016 playoffs when he raised both middle fingers (with his gloves on) at the officials after a penalty call.\n\nUpon his arrival to the sin bin, he went on a profanity-strewn tirade that featured a homophobic slur. He tried to convince us that wasn’t the real him in an emotional apology, but a lot of us knew better.\n\n31. Zac Rinaldo\n\nCareer: 9 seasons (2011-21)\n\nTeams: Philadelphia Flyers (2011-15), Boston Bruins (2015-16), Arizona Coyotes (2017-18), Nashville Predators (2018-19), Calgary Flames (2019-21)\n\nBottom Line: Zac Rinaldo\n\nZac The Hack always finds a way — way high, way late, way from behind. Yeah, that’s about as close as the coward will ever come to a hat trick. The guy shows no remorse for his despicable actions, a few of which have left opponents with serious health issues.\n\nConsider all the other mindless penalties that the peabrain has committed over the years, and it’s difficult to tell who’s dumber — him or his employers.\n\n30. Mike Milbury\n\nCareer: 12 seasons (1975-87)\n\nTeams: Boston Bruins (1975-87)\n\nBottom Line: Mike Milbury\n\nYou didn’t care for him as a talent-challenged Bruins defenseman; you couldn’t stand him as a petulant Bruins head coach; you swore at him as an overmatched Islanders general manager; and you couldn’t wait for him to get fired as a smug television know-it-all.\n\nHas anyone turned off more people at more levels than this do-nothing know-nothing? He’s the only person on Earth who has a bad word to say about Hall of Fame coach Badger Bob Johnson, which is all you need to know about him.\n\n29. Raffi Torres\n\nCareer: 12 seasons (2001-14)\n\nTeams: New York Islanders (2001-03), Edmonton Oilers (2003-07),Columbus Blue Jackets (2008-10), Buffalo Sabres (2010), Vancouver Canucks (2010-11), Phoenix Coyotes (2011-13), San Jose Sharks (2013-14)\n\nBottom Line: Raffi Torres\n\nThis power forward was a real player early in his career, but it wasn’t long before he regressed into a hired assassin. In the 2012 playoffs, he infamously jacked the jaw of Chicago Blackhawks forward Marian Hossa to draw a 21-game suspension.\n\nThree years later, his decapitation of the Anaheim Ducks forward Jacob Silfverberg resulted in a 41-game vacation, the longest suspension in league history. And let's not forget that this happened in a preseason game of all places.\n\n28. Corey Perry\n\nCareer: 18 seasons (2005-present)\n\nTeams: Mighty Ducks of Anaheim/Anaheim Ducks (2005-19), Dallas Stars (2019-20), Montreal Canadiens (2020-21), Tampa Bay Lightning (2021-present)\n\nBottom Line: Corey Perry\n\nWhen Winnipeg Jets forward Mark Scheifele did something out of character to one of their players last postseason, the Canadiens moaned to no end.\n\nSorry, but any organization that employs this whiney cheapshot has no right to protest. He ran out of his allotment of accidentally-on-purpose cards a decade ago.\n\n27. Dino Ciccarelli\n\nCareer: 19 seasons (1980-99)\n\nTeams: Minnesota North Stars (1980-89),Washington Capitals (1989-92), Detroit Red Wings (1992-96), Tampa Bay Lightning (1996-98), Florida Panthers (1998-99)\n\nBottom Line: Dino Ciccarelli\n\nRemember those chants at old Chicago Stadium?Di-no sucks! Di-no sucks! Di-no sucks! This chirper/flopper/reckless hitter would annoy opponents and their fans to no end.\n\nStickerelli twice conked Toronto Maple Leafs defenseman Luke Richardson on the head and spent a few hours in jail as a result. Alas, the judge let him off, but not without a warning ... “Di-no sucks!”\n\n26. Brad Marchand\n\nCareer: 14 seasons (2009-present)\n\nTeams: Boston Bruins (2009-present)\n\nBottom Line: Brad Marchand\n\nLittle Ball of Hate? No, more like Big Piece of Excrement. Dirty. Smug. Sneaky. Creepy. Slimey. All the no-good adjectives apply here. Even some Bruins pom-pom wavers are embarrassed by his act, but because the career overachiever puts up big numbers consistently, there’s not much they can say out loud.\n\nYou know, like the ever-so-subtle slew foot from behind, his favorite stunt. (If you want to include Theo Fleury as a double-entry here, you have our permission. One and the same dirtbag, basically.)\n\n25. Almost Any Philadelphia Broad Street Bully\n\nCareer: 3 seasons (1972-75)\n\nStatistics: 23 penalty minutes per game\n\nBottom Line: Almost Any Philadelphia Broad Street Bully\n\nIn a span of three reprehensible seasons, the Flyers averaged 81 percent more penalty minutes per game than the league average while they elbowed/pole-axed/sucker-punched hockey into the dark ages.\n\nSo take your pick — Gary Dornhoeffer, Andre Dupont, Bob Kelly, Ed Van Impe, Don Saleski. (Don’t worry, Bobby Clarke and Dave Schultz, your times are about to come.)\n\n24. Dale Hunter\n\nCareer: 19 seasons (1980-1999)\n\nTeams: Quebec Nordiques (1980-87), Washington Capitals (1987-99), Colorado Avalanche (1999)\n\nBottom Line: Dale Hunter\n\nIf this spit disturber had stuck more to hockey all those years, he might have been a borderline Hall of Fame candidate. The only player to reach four figures in points and penalty minutes in league history resorted to cheap tactics that riled opponents and smeared his reputation, sad to say.\n\nThe guy is known more for the very, very late blindside hit that ruined the career of New York Islanders forward Pierre Turgeon in the 1993 playoffs than anything else he did on the ice. The resulting 21-game suspension was the most severe in league history at the time.\n\n23. Daniel Carcillo\n\nCareer: 9 seasons (2006-15)\n\nTeams: Phoenix Coyotes (2006-09), Philadelphia Flyers (2009-11), Los Angeles Kings (2013), New York Rangers (2014), Chicago Blackhawks (2011-12, 2014-15)\n\nBottom Line: Daniel Carcillo\n\nThis potty-mouth suffered traumatic brain injuries in his role as enforcer, but put away the violins, please. The one-time dirtiest player in hockey wasn’t a victim. He was the perpetrator.\n\nIn his pugilistic prime, he piled up 578 penalty minutes in back-to-back seasons. That’s nearly seven hours worth for you scoring at home. Worse yet, he was known to flop on contact, an insult to real tough guys everywhere.\n\n22. Larry Zeidel\n\nCareer: 5 seasons (1951-54, 1967-69)\n\nTeams: Detroit Red Wings (1951-53), Chicago Blackhawks (1953-54), Philadelphia Flyers (1967-69)\n\nBottom Line: Larry Zeidel\n\nThis maniacal defenseman had a rather brief NHL career, but he pissed off (and terrorized) so many opponents in his earlier minor league days, there was room for him here. “This kid was an animal, I tell ya,” said hockey personality Don Cherry, his roommate for two seasons in the minors. “He’d carve you up as soon as he looked at you.”\n\nZeidel and Eddie Shack were involved in donnybrooks 10 years apart. The first ended with The Rock in a jail cell after he assaulted a referee in the stands, while the second was a gruesome stick duel that left them bruised and bloodied.\n\n21. Tiger Williams\n\nCareer: 14 seasons (1974-88)\n\nTeams: Toronto Maple Leafs (1974-80), Vancouver Canucks (1980-84), Detroit Red Wings (1984-85), Los Angeles Kings (1985-87). ChHartford Whalers (1987-88)\n\nBottom Line: Tiger Williams\n\nFor years, this gap-toothed Canucklehead was the most distorted and loathed face in the sport. He made a name for himself with sticks and fists, and five teams gave him the stage to do it. In 1977, after the forward tried to behead Pittsburgh Penguins defenseman Dennis Owchar with his stick, he became the first player to face criminal charges in league history.\n\nThe judge ruled the 18 stitches were unintentional and acquitted him. “When you’re going to court for assault with a deadly weapon, it sounds like I’m Charlie Manson’s brother,” he sniffed in a CBC interview.\n\nMore people were thinkin’ Attila the Hun, actually.\n\n20. Matt Cooke\n\nCareer: 16 seasons (1998-2015)\n\nTeams: Vancouver Canucks (1998-2008), Washington Capitals (2008), Pittsburgh Penguins (2008-2013), Minnesota Wild (2013-15)\n\nBottom Line: Matt Cooke\n\nThe Cookee Monster could play a little bit. Too bad he valued cheap shots as much as wrist shots. His career lowlight was a knockout of Marc Savard just after the Boston Bruins forward had shot the puck.\n\nWait, it gets worse — while the victim was concussed, the conspirator got off scot-free. Something good did come out of this, though. At long last, the league adopted Rule 48 that prohibited hits to the head.\n\n19. Bobby Clarke\n\nCareer: 15 seasons (1998-89)\n\nTeams: Philadelphia Flyers (1998-2008)\n\nBottom Line: Bobby Clarke\n\nWhen New York Islanders goalie Billy Smith and this Flyboys captain went at it, as they were prone to do, we kinda rooted for them both to lose. Not only was this swordsman among the dirtiest players of his era — Soviet team star Valeri Kharlamov could vouch for that — but he had the face to match.\n\nThat toothless grin and orange sweater made him look like a human jack-o’-lantern. You wanted to drop it on the floor and watch it splatter to smithereens, didn’t you?\n\n18. Pat Quinn\n\nCareer: 10 seasons (1968-77)\n\nTeams: Toronto Maple Leafs (1968-70), Vancouver Canucks (1970-72), Atlanta Flames (1972-77)\n\nBottom Line: Pat Quinn\n\nThis no-talent Hall of Famer (huh?) wasn’t known for his smarts, either, but a person had to have the IQ of a hockey puck to freight-train Boston immortal Bobby Orr in a playoff game. In Beantown!\n\nBruins teammates were quick to exact payback, but no amount of flesh could ever be enough. The guy remains one of the most hated athletes in Beantown to this day — worse than Bucky Bleepin’ Dent even — and that will rightfully remain his legacy. Then, he took his attitutde to Philadelphia, where the Flyboys head coach and his team peeved off even more people.\n\n17. Darius Kasparaitis\n\nCareer: 14 seasons (1992-2007)\n\nTeams: New York Islanders (1992-96), Pittsburgh Penguins (1998-2008), New York Rangers (2002-07)\n\nBottom Line: Darius Kasparaitis\n\nThe 5-foot-11 defenseman was especially brutal on low blows to the knees or thereabouts.\n\n“He thrived on hitting the stars,” said one-time teammate Matthew Barnaby, no shrinking violet himself. “Whether it be clean or dirty, he really didn’t care.”\n\n16. Bryan Marchment\n\nCareer: 17 seasons (1988-2006)\n\nTeams: Winnipeg Jets (1988-1991, Chicago Blackhawks (1991-93), Hartford Whalers (1994), Edmonton Oilers (1994-97), Tampa Bay Lightning (1997-98), San Jose Sharks (1998-2003), Colorado Avalanche (2003), Toronto Maple Leafs (2003-04), Calgary Flames (2005-06)\n\nBottom Line: Bryan Marchment\n\nIn his prime, this designated hitter was suspended 13 times in a span of 12 seasons. From the first puck drop, the defenseman played on the edge with a full complement of body blows, some of which were even legal.\n\nSo proficient was he in his role that no fewer than nine teams wanted him. The guy backed up the frequent cheap shots with his fists, but a willingness to drop the gloves and hold his own doesn’t preclude the fact that he was dirtier than most.\n\n15. Alex Ovechkin\n\nCareer: 18 seasons (2005-present)\n\nTeams: Washington Capitals (2005-present)\n\nBottom Line: Alex Ovechkin\n\nAs we can’t help but notice, Ovi scores a lot of goals — except that he acts like a kid who got lucky on prom night after every one of them. He rarely makes his teammates better, flops like a stoned seal and leaves his feet to deliver illegal hits.\n\nThe Russian is a loyal member of the Vladimir Putin mafia, which speaks volumes about Ovi the person. Some have ever referred to him as “treasonous scum,” not to be critical or anything.\n\n14. Ron Hextall\n\nCareer: 13 seasons (1986-99)\n\nTeams: Philadelphia Flyers (1986-92, 1994-99), Quebec Nordiques (1992-93), New York Islanders (1993-94)\n\nBottom Line: Ron Hextall\n\nCouldn’t somebody think of a nickname better than Hexy for this whack job? We like The Mad Slasher better. The most penalized netminder in league history picked up where Billy Smith left off in the late-1980s when he took goaltender goonery to an even lower level.\n\nSo far out did he stray to assault opponents that one thought his team had pulled the goalie. The shenanigans overshadowed the fact that the guy was little more than above average and won diddly squat. (Have you ever seen the Flyers win the Cup?)\n\n13. Bryan Watson\n\nCareer: 15 seasons (1963-78)\n\nTeams: Montreal Canadiens (1963-64), Detroit Red Wings (1965-67, 1973-76), Oakland Seals (1968-69), Pittsburgh Penguins (1969-74), St. Louis Blues (1974), Washington Capitals (1976-78)\n\nBottom Line: Bryan Watson\n\nSuper Pest was one of the original shadows in the league — i.e., the agitator whose purpose was to get in the face of the top gun on the other side. He did a pretty fair job of it, too — all 5-foot-9, 175 pounds of him.\n\nThe big shooters and their fans grew to despise him, most notably normally mild-mannered Chicago Blackhawks star Bobby Hull, who tangled with him on more than one occasion. Worse yet, the one-time league leader in penalty minutes was the rare brawler who had more than an ounce of puck smarts. He went on to coach a kid named Wayne Gretzky in their World Hockey Association days.\n\n12. Chris Simon\n\nCareer: 15 seasons (1992-2008)\n\nTeams: Quebec Nordiques (1993-95), Colorado Avalanche (1995-96), Washington Capitals (1996-2002), Chicago Blackhawks (2002-03), New York Rangers (2003-04), Calgary Flames (2004-06), New York Islanders (2006-08), Minnesota Wild (2008)\n\nBottom Line: Chris Simon\n\nThis 6-foot-3, 233-pound menace to society was a bad man in so many ways. On the ice, he constantly went out of his way to maim opponents. Off of it, he frittered away $15 million in career earnings, had two lousy marriages and reneged on six figures worth of child support.\n\nSimon says his many failures were the result of brain trauma among other physical problems, but it’s hard to feel sorry for a lughead who willingly took part in more than 100 fights and was suspended for 65 games in his career.\n\n11. Tie Domi\n\nCareer: 16 seasons (1990-2006)\n\nTeams: Toronto Maple Leafs (1990, 1995-2006), New York Rangers (1990-92), Winnipeg Jets (1992-95)\n\nBottom Line: Tie Domi\n\nHas there ever been a narcissist who could boil blood in more ways than this Napolean on skates? The 5-foot-10 lightweight was equal parts goon and agitator, both designed to place the spotlight squarely on him. (Remember that goofy WWE belt routine?)\n\nNo wonder his act wore thin even on teammates. His career lowlight: a drive-by that laid out New Jersey Devils defenseman Scott Niedermayer in the 2001 playoffs and got him suspended for the rest of the series.\n\n10. Billy Smith\n\nCareer: 18 seasons (1971-89)\n\nTeams: Los Angeles Kings (1971-72), New York Islanders (1972-89)\n\n9. Tom Wilson\n\nCareer: 8 seasons (2013-21)\n\nTeams: Washington Capitals (2013-21)\n\nBottom Line: Tom Wilson\n\nJust check out YouTube for a comprehensive list of Wilson's jerk moments, and there’s plenty of time for him to move up on this list. Yet we blame the enablers as much as Whip for his criminal behavior.\n\nWe're lookin’ at you, linemate Alex Ovechkin. (“It’s hockey. It’s not a ballet.”) And you, ex-head coach Barry Trotz. (Seriously, some people would love to wring his neck if they could just find it.) And you, too, one-time goon George Parros. For him to be the league chief police is like Jack The Ripper as a Supreme Court Justice.\n\n8. Ulf Samuelsson\n\nCareer: 16 seasons (1984-2000)\n\nTeams: Hartford Whalers (1984-91), Pittsburgh Penguins (1991-95), New York Rangers (1995-99), Detroit Red Wings (1999), Philadelphia Flyers (1999-2000)\n\nBottom Line: Ulf Samuelsson\n\nContrary to popular belief, this robocop defenseman did not end the career of Cam Neely with a reckless low hit. As Neely said himself, the fatal thigh-knee injury was the result of an earlier confrontation in which Ulfie ducked his attempted hit in the corner.\n\nThe coward ducked a lot of things, namely fisticuffs, which made the league-wide disdain for him that much more intense. What did it say for the league that the Penguins needed an enforcer like this to hoist back-to-back Stanley Cups?\n\n7. Claude Lemieux\n\nCareer: 17 seasons (1983-2006)\n\nTeams: Montreal Canadiens (1983-90), New Jersey Devils (1990-95, 1999-2000), Colorado Avalanche (1995-09), Phoenix Coyotes (2003\n\nBottom Line: Claude Lemieux\n\nClaude The Fraud was ankle-deep in so much excrement, it took the gloss off his reputation as a clutch player. The nonsense started in the 1988-89 season when the rookie bit Calgary Flames forward Jim Peplinski in a playoff game. Yet that was nothin’ compared to his blindside hit that broke the face of Kris Draper in the 1996 playoffs and would define the Avalanche/Detroit Red Wings blood wars.\n\n“I can’t believe I shook this guy's freakin’ hand after the game,” Red Wings Dino Ciccarelli said famously. “That pisses me right off.”\n\n6. Marty McSorley\n\nCareer: 17 seasons (1983-2000)\n\nTeams: Pittsburgh Penguins (1983-85, 1993-94), Edmonton Oilers (1985-88, 1998-99), Los Angeles Kings (1988-96), New York Rangers (1996), San Jose Sharks (1996-98), Boston Bruins (1999-2000)\n\nBottom Line: Marty McSorley\n\nThis McMeathead is known for two things: 1) an unconscionable two-handed stick swing that darn near killed Vancouver Canucks enforcer Donald Brashear late in a 2000 game and 2) an illegal stick penalty in the 1993 Stanley Cup Final that might have cost the Kings their first-ever league championship.\n\nWhile the guy had some talent, it’s the cold-blooded head hit that will forever be his legacy. It came with three seconds left in a blowout loss. Dumb-de-dumb-dumb.\n\n5. Eddie Shore\n\nCareer: 18 seasons (1926-40)\n\nTeams: Boston Bruins (1926-39), New York Americans (1940)\n\nBottom Line: Eddie Shore\n\nBy almost all accounts, the first great NHL defenseman was almost as nasty as he was talented. Which is to say, very much so. The future Hall of Famer also nearly became the first NHL player to kill somebody on the ice in an era without helmets.\n\nFor days, Toronto star Ace Bailey lay near death with a massive brain injury, the result of a thunderous hit from behind. Shore claimed the blow was accidental but was suspended for 21 games, anyway. Bailey’s father was among the less forgiving — he had a .45 revolver at the ready before a team official calmed him down. We're pretty sure that qualifies as hate.\n\n4. Todd Bertuzzi\n\nCareer: 18 seasons (1995-2014)\n\nTeams: New York Islanders (1995-98), Vancouver Canucks (1998-2006), Florida Panthers (2006), Anaheim Ducks (2007-08), Calgary Flames (2008-09), Detroit Red Wings (2007, 2009-14)\n\nBottom Line: Todd Bertuzzi\n\nIn one horrific sequence in the 2003-04 season, Big Bert went from a semi-respected power forward to a villain of monstrous proportions. His sucker punch from behind left Colorado Avalanche forward Steve Moore unconscious, concussed and with three broken vertebrae in his neck. The guy never played another game.\n\nThe perpetrator issued a tearful apology afterward, but it was too late to undo the damage — to the victim, the sport, the league and his legacy.\n\n3. Sean Avery\n\nCareer: 11 seasons (2001-2012)\n\nTeams: Detroit Red Wings (2001-03), Los Angeles Kings (2003-2007), Dallas Stars (2008), New York Rangers (2007-12)\n\nBottom Line: Sean Avery\n\nThis psychopath admits that he was unhinged from as far back as he can remember. “I never waited for someone to tell me the rules,” he said. “I always thought there was kind of a way to come in the back door.”\n\nThat back door included physical and/or verbal assaults on everything from opponents to referees to law enforcement personnel to even the rules of the game. Even after retirement, the lunatic smashed the car mirror of a neighbor whom he claimed had tried to run him over.\n\n2. Chris Pronger\n\nCareer: 18 seasons (1993-2011)\n\nTeams: Hartford Whalers (1993-95), St. Louis Blues (1995-2004), Edmonton Oilers (2005-06), Anaheim Ducks (2006-09), Philadelphia Flyers (2010-11)\n\nBottom Line: Chris Pronger\n\nOne would think that a defenseman with 6-foot-6 size and considerable talent would be a better human, but in the case of this ogre, one couldn’t be more wrong. The guy turned more stomachs than a week-old burrito wherever he went. He sobbed his way out of Edmonton after one successful season, wimped out on the Florida Panthers in the playoffs and mocked the media more than once.\n\nAnd when the prima donna didn’t get his way — and the refs allowed him to get away with a lot — he resorted to enough elbows, high sticks and foot-stomps to warrant not two, not four, not six but eight suspensions.\n\n1. Dave Schultz\n\nCareer: 9 seasons (1971-79)\n\nTeams: Philadelphia Flyers (1971-76), Los Angeles Kings (1976-77), Pittsburgh Penguins (1977-79), Buffalo Sabres (1979)\n\nBottom Line: Dave Schultz\n\nOf the dozens of Flyers over the decades, why this loser? No-brainer. The Hammer was the baddest of the Broad Street Bullies, the criminals who single-fistedly set back the sport and the league years, if not decades.\n\nHis brutal assault of helpless New York Rangers defenseman Dale Rolfe in the 1974 playoffs was beyond reprehensible and defined the ugliness of the era. Do that on the street, and it’s jail time. Do that in the NHL, and you’re hailed as a tough guy. Still wonder how the best sport can have the worst league?"
