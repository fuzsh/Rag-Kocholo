Staios couldn't have been expected to do much, considering he joined a team that was 13-18-0-0, and Don Waddell just joined Columbus, and thus can't be meaningfully measured on that scale.\n\nAlso, they both aren't Brad Treliving.\n\nLEAFANFORLIFE23\n\nRegistered User\n\nJun 17, 2010\n\n46,654\n\n15,300\n\nAug 8, 2024\n\n#21\n\nLeafs should be 13-17\n\nThey are behind the Buffalo Sabres who haven't made the playoffs in 13 years.\n\nDetroit who is going for year 9.\n\nOttawa who is going for year 8\n\nUtah who hasn't played a game as Utah and is the former Arizona\n\nThen you get to Chicago, SJ and the Ducks.\n\nThe Athletic should be ashamed to post this.\n\nReactions: Laus723\n\nAlexBrovechkin8\n\nAt least there was 2018.\n\nFeb 18, 2012\n\n27,327\n\n26,539\n\nDistrict of Champions\n\nAug 8, 2024\n\n#22\n\nThe difference between the public perception of what Washington is doing and what the fans think is pretty stark.
