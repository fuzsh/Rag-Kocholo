        "text": "Thirty years ago, the Penguins didn’t win the Stanley Cup. Didn’t win their division either. Actually, the Penguins didn’t win much of anything during the 1983-84 season. Well, not on the ice anyway.\n\nBut, that ill-designed, ill-fated team – Pittsburgh’s original “Boys of Winter” – set the team on a franchise-altering course that sent ripples through the NHL for decades. Though they lacked victories, talent and, some would suggest, scruples, Penguins fans should be grateful for what that team, by design or not, accomplished.\n\n“It was turbulent. It was disappointing. It was depressing at times,” said Bob Errey, then a bright-eyed 19-year-old rookie, who was the Penguins’ first-round pick in the ’83 draft.\n\nFor the majority of Pittsburghers raised on football, baseball and basketball, the novelty of an NHL team had long worn off by the fall of 1983. The Penguins were largely a curiosity, a healthy distraction to pass the time between the Super Bowl and the start of spring training.\n\nAt the bottom of Pittsburgh’s sporting totem pole, the Penguins averaged more than 11,000 fans to the 16,033-seat Civic Arena just three times in their first 16 seasons. In 1975, the organization emerged from -- what turned about to be its first -- bankruptcy after which the doors to the team’s Uptown offices were infamously padlocked. Three years after that, Youngstown businessman Edward J. DeBartolo Sr. took ownership of the rudderless club.\n\n“The Penguins were less popular than the Pittsburgh Spirit indoor soccer team, which was kind of humiliating,” said Paul Steigerwald, then a 29-year-old staffer in the hockey team’s marketing department. “They became the darlings of the organization because DeBartolo owned both teams. The Penguins were sort of the scourge of the organization at that time.”\n\nOn the ice, the Penguins had one second-place finish in 1978-79 and nine playoff appearances to their credit, but up until that point, the Penguins’ most memorable moments were a pair of postseason losses, each in exceedingly excruciating fashion, to the New York Islanders. In ’75 they became just the third team in history to blow a 3-0 series lead and in ’82 they forced a deciding Game 5 against an Islanders powerhouse only to lose a heartbreaker in overtime.\n\nWhen Eddie Johnston took over the coaching reigns in 1980, he needed just one day on the job during training camp in Johnstown before realizing that DeBartolo wasn’t handing him the keys to a Cadillac.\n\n“We were in bad shape,” said Johnston. “We had 23 guys in training camp. Everybody has 40-50 guys. So we had all 23 guys making our team. You know, which is a no-brainer, everyone had a job.”\n\nTwo months following the tragic death of general manager Baz Bastien in an early morning car wreck on the Parkway West in Green Tree, Johnston ascended to the front office in May of ’83.\n\nHe may have been best known as the answer to a trivia question -- Who was the last goalie to not wear a facemask? -- but Johnston also had a lifetime of knowledge and a keen understanding of his team and the direction it had to take.\n\n“That was rock bottom,” said Steigerwald. “At least we had embraced, by virtue of Eddie Johnston being our general manager, the concept of building through the draft and not trading first-round picks, which the Penguins had done for years. There was at least a feeling of optimism that what we were doing was going to eventually make us a good team.”\n\nThe Penguins had dealt first-round picks in 1971, ’72, ’77, ’78, ’79, ’81 and ’83. Johnston refused to make the same mistake in 1984. Everyone in hockey knew who the No. 1 overall pick would be and had known it for a few years. It would just be a matter of landing that golden ticket.\n\n---\n\nNo, the Penguins didn’t have many wins in the 1983-84 season -- 16 to be exact -- but they did have a slick new marketing campaign and a catchy jingle to go with it.\n\nIt was the brainchild of Steigerwald, now the team’s TV play-by-play man, who began dabbling in television work during intermissions that season.\n\nWith neither of Pittsburgh’s two major dailies even bothering to send beat reporters to Penguins road games, selling the team to the public was crucial in those days. After noticing the players referred to themselves as “boys,” Steigerwald pitched “The Boys of Winter,” among others. The concept was an idyllic vision of the game with almost Rockwellian imagery.\n\n“We sort of knew going in that we weren’t going to be selling competitiveness,” said Steigerwald. “What we were selling was the charm of hockey and how much we loved the game.\n\n“The players were used in that capacity to help us sell that by telling what it was like growing up in Canada on the pond, all the stuff you hear now when they talk about the Winter Classic. We were evoking that back in ’83-84.”\n\nAdvertising director Tom Rooney took the idea to an Edgewood production house to pen the song, and the correlating “Boys of Winter” tune was born. Little did they know the ad campaign and song would make the second-most lasting impact from the Penguins’ 1983-84 season.\n\nThe man Johnston assigned to coach the Penguins was a fellow hockey lifer, Lou Angotti. The 5-foot-9, 170-pound Angotti lasted a decade in the pros as a player for six NHL teams and one season, his last, in the WHA. A year after serving as captain on the expansion Philadelphia Flyers’ inaugural team, Angotti netted a career-high 17 goals for the Penguins in 1968-69 as a 31-year-old.\n\nUpon hanging up his skates, Angotti coached the St. Louis Blues for parts of the 1974 and ’75 seasons, compiling a miserable 6-20-6 record. However, Angotti’s nadir was still to come in Pittsburgh.\n\n“He was a good guy, he was,” Steigerwald said. “He was put in a really tough situation.”\n\nWhile tempting to cast the ’83-84 Penguins as a lovable bunch of losers, there was actually very little to like about this team of has-beens, never-wasses, cast-offs and untested rookies.\n\nAngotti was hamstrung from the start as the Penguins went through an unheard-of 48 players that season. Some, like Rick Kehoe, Randy Carlyle, 20-year-old enforcer Marty McSorley and Errey, were good. But most weren’t. Even leading scorer Mike Bullard, one of eight 50-goal scorers that season, was a minus-33.\n\nToo many looked out for themselves, mercenaries desperate to cash one last NHL paycheck. Angotti, whose son was killed in a car accident that season, never stood a chance.\n\n“He didn’t have a lot of great leaders,” said Errey, now the team’s TV color analyst. “Guys weren’t as disciplined back then. It’s tough to run a ship if everyone isn’t willing to get on board. That made it tough, and he wore every loss on his sleeve.”\n\nAngotti’s sleeves would be filled in his one season on the job.\n\n---\n\nAfter dropping the opener 5-3 at St. Louis, the Penguins lost their following three -- getting outscored 22-8 in the process -- and set the tone for a train wreck of a season.\n\nThe Penguins had just three two-game winning streaks, and though the power player converted at a respectable 20.6 percent, there was one caveat: They surrendered an unseemly 14 shorthanded goals.\n\nThe team performed even worse at the gate. In 40 home dates, the Penguins drew just 6,839, a number that hadn’t been seen since the franchise’s infancy in the late ‘60s.\n\nThose who showed let their displeasure be known.\n\nComing from a successful junior program in Peterborough, where he starred alongside Steve Yzerman, Pittsburgh wasn’t exactly a healthy environment for a youngster like Errey to be.\n\n“The boobirds certainly were well-heard,” said Errey, who scored nine goals his rookie year. “It didn’t feel too good to be told you’re a bum coming off the ice after another loss. It was hard. It was hard on the young players. Hard on me, speaking for myself. It was tough.\n\n“My recollection, I didn’t take a lot of positives out of it from coaching on down. I thought it was a tough indoctrination to the National Hockey League.”\n\nAfter an especially brutal 13-4 loss to the Flyers at the Philadelphia Spectrum on March 22, the Penguins still managed to take a road trip to the casinos in nearby Atlantic City. It was the kind of lackadaisical response that was typical of the Flightless Fowl.\n\n“Think that would affect our travel plans? No,” Errey said. “That’s just the way it was. Just another city, just another stop on the train.”\n\nWhile the losing didn’t weigh heavily on some, it did on the owner. One night, in front of yet another mostly-empty Igloo, Steigerwald vividly recalls DeBartolo standing behind the last row of the lower bowl, stewing as he watched his team’s incompetence play out in front of him. DeBartolo wasn’t known for his accessibility, but he wanted to get a feel for what the team’s long-suffering fans were going through.\n\n“Anybody could have walked up to him, nobody did,” Steigerwald said. “But I still have that vision of him standing there watching.\n\n“Even though your team is expected to lose and everyone knows you don’t have the talent to win, it’s really hard to lose. That’s what I remember, how much the losing effected people and made you feel like crap every day.”\n\n---\n\nAs the calendar turned to 1984 and with his team hopelessly out of contention, Johnston sprung into action just as Mario Lemieux, a gangly French Canadian teenager in Montreal, was dazzling the junior hockey world.\n\n“Everybody in amateur scouting knew who we was,” said Kehoe. “It wasn’t like it was a secret hiding up there in Quebec. Everyone knew about him.”\n\nIntentionally or not, the Penguins seemed like a team that was jockeying for position to land the coveted No. 1 overall pick in the draft by losing. More players came in and more players were shipped out, most notably Carlyle, who had won the Norris Trophy as the league’s top defenseman just three years earlier.\n\n“We had to find out what we had in the organization,” Johnston said. “We brought guys up late in the year because we had to make an evaluation. After Christmastime, we’re 30 points out of the playoffs. So where are we going? What do you do? You’ve got do what’s best for your hockey club and evaluate everybody and see how things go.”\n\nJust as things were going from bad to absurd in Pittsburgh, New Jersey’s front office, to Angotti’s dismay, publicly claimed that the Penguins were tanking the season to land the top pick.\n\nOne of Johnston’s more curious evaluations included goalie Vincent Tremblay, who replaced Roberto Romano, one of four goalies used in ’83-84, as the starter late in the season.\n\nRomano, who posted a dreadful .876 save percentage and 4.59 goals-against average, was jettisoned to the AHL affiliate in Baltimore. But as bad as those numbers were, Tremblay’s were even worse. Tremblay went 0-4 with a 6.00 GAA and .831 save percentage.\n\n“I just think it’s funny because the Penguins didn’t have to try very hard to lose,” Steigerwald said.\n\nThough management may have had a hand in it, the players remain vehement that they were not some pawns in a lecherous scheme hatched by Johnston.\n\n“When players put on the uniform, they go out to play and win,” said Kehoe, who scored 18 goals in 57 games in ’83-84 before a neck injury cut his season, and ultimately his career, short. “It’s a touchy situation. (The Devils) were losing, too, or they wouldn’t be in the same position we were in.”\n\nIn a March 6 game at the Meadowlands which would go a long way in deciding whether Pittsburgh or New Jersey would finish 21st in the then 21-team NHL, the Devils scored three times in the third period to beat the Penguins 6-5.\n\nThe Devils, in just their second season in New Jersey after relocating from Colorado, ended their season on an eight-game losing streak, finishing 17-56-7 for 41 points.\n\nThe Penguins concluded their season on a six-game losing streak, losing 12 of their final 14 and seven of their final 42 to finish 16-58-6 for 38 points (Interestingly, 66 points fewer than the Patrick Division champion Islanders).\n\n“Hey, Jersey wins two games,” Johnston said. “That’s basically what it came down to.”\n\n---\n\nHaving played in Boston in the 1960s, Johnston was well aware what a franchise player would mean for Pittsburgh.\n\nFrom 1960 until ’67, when the NHL was still a six-team league, the Bruins failed to qualify for the postseason. That, of course, changed with the signing of Bobby Orr.\n\nThe high-scoring defenseman revolutionized the position, sold out Boston Garden and carried the Bruins -- and Johnston, the backup goalie -- to Stanley Cup championships in 1970 and ’72.\n\nThe Penguins had some good players in their history -- Jean Pronovost, Dave Burrows, Syl Apps – but never a franchise player. Nothing like Lemieux, another once-in-a-generation player in the vein of Orr and Wayne Gretzky.\n\nIn his final season for Laval in the Quebec Major Junior League, Lemieux scored an astonishing 133 goals and 282 points in 70 games, shattering records held by Guy Lafleur, Mike Bossy and Pat Lafontaine.\n\nBlessed with size, the 6-foot-4, 200-pound center reminded some of former Montreal great Jean Believeau, but he also had the skill and speed of a smaller player like Gretzky.\n\nHaving grown up in the same Montreal district as Lemieux, Johnston had “pretty good insight” with the Lemieux family. That season alone, Johnston made 10-15 pilgrimages to Laval to scout the wunderkind. Print and television reporters from Pittsburgh soon followed.\n\nIn the days before social media and the internet, Steigerwald had only known of Lemieux from what he had heard through the media but soon began working on a Lemieux-themed brochure called “The Class of ‘84,” complete with quotes from Scotty Bowman and Glen Sather among others.\n\n“We were going to market him big-time,” Steigerwald said.\n\nNearly all of the league’s 20 other teams made trade offers for the No. 1 pick. But Johnston informed DeBartolo that under no circumstances would he move the top pick, though there were more than a few intriguing offers.\n\nMinnesota North Stars GM Lou Nanne pitched all 12 of his picks in the ’84 draft. The Flyers and Montreal Canadiens also made substantial offers, although consisting mostly of veterans. The Quebec Nordiques, just to spite their provincial rival Canadiens, offered the Stastny brothers -- all three.\n\n“It was an easy call for me,” Johnston said. “The only tough part about it was some of the good offers that I got. But I had made up my mind that I wasn’t moving him.\n\n“I’d seen enough of Mario and knew that a player like that comes around once in a lifetime.”\n\nOn June 1, 1984, at the Montreal Forum, just a few miles from where both Johnston and Lemieux grew up, the Penguins GM made the first of the 250 total picks that day. Meanwhile back in Pittsburgh, 3,000 fans watched a closed-circuit telecast of the draft at the Civic Arena.\n\nSeated at a table on the floor of the fabled Forum, home of the Canadiens, Johnston, in broken French, uttered the words that changed franchise history.\n\n“Pittsburgh ... le numero soixante-six, Mario Lemieux!”\n\n---\n\nThere was never a question that Lemieux would be the No. 1 pick, just as there wasn’t much doubt that Johnston would draft him if available.\n\nAfter failing in their own attempts to fall into last place, New Jersey selected Kirk Muller at No. 2, while Eddie Olczyk, later a Penguins player, broadcaster and coach, went third to Chicago.(Had Pittsburgh selected second, Johnston offered a faint, “Probably Muller, maybe”). Both Muller and Olczyk had outstanding careers but neither won Stanley Cups\n\nfor the teams that drafted them and neither were Lemieux.\n\nThough Lemieux refused to don a Penguins jersey on draft day in a negotiating ploy, that was soon smoothed over and he signed a two-year deal for a reported $600,000, a $150,000 signing bonus included, two weeks later.\n\n“(Lemieux) was a guy with that presence, that cornerstone that you can build around,” Errey said. “That franchise player that they were looking for to take us in the right direction, but it didn’t happen overnight.”\n\nFar from it.\n\nIn 1984-85, the Penguins showed a 15-point improvement but still finished in last place, Attendance ticked up to 10,018, but that was still far from capacity.\n\nLemieux, who scored 100 points (43 goals) to win the Calder Trophy as the NHL’s rookie of the year, paid immediate dividends, famously scoring on his first shift in his first game by undressing Boston star defenseman Ray Bourque and lifting a backhander past Bruins goalie Pete Peeters.\n\n“I think everyone in the National Hockey League went, ‘Wow, this is a special player,’” Johnston said.\n\nBut, as Errey suggested, the Penguins didn’t become a legitimate Stanley Cup contender just because of Lemieux. It took five years for the Penguins just to reach the playoffs in ‘89. It took seven years and a star-studded supporting cast that included Paul Coffey, Jaromir Jagr, Joe Mullen, Ron Francis, Bryan Trottier, Mark Recchi, Larry Murphy, Tom Barrasso and Kevin Stevens before the Penguins lifted the big silver mug after the first of consecutive Cup championships.\n\nLemieux later bought the team out of bankruptcy in 1997 and won the Cup for a third time, as an owner, in 2009. Wednesday night will mark the eighth straight year that Sidney Crosby -- the franchise’s new hero -- and the Penguins have qualified for postseason play. And they will do it in front of their 328th straight sell-out at the four-year-old, $318 million Consol Energy Center, across Centre Avenue from the old Igloo.\n\nThirty years later, the story of how the Penguins landed Lemieux has been a source of controversy. For those who were around at the time, there is no great mystery, no conspiracy theories.\n\n“If E.J. did create the opportunity for the Penguins to be in a better position to draft Mario Lemieux, I take my hat off to him,” Steigerwald said. “At that time, he wasn’t just ensuring a brighter future, he was saving the franchise.”"
