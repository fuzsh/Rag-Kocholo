The Mori Cabinet briefly governed Japan between April and July 2000, after the sudden incapacitation of Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi and his replacement by Yoshirō Mori, who had been LDP Secretary General. Mori called his government "the Japan revival cabinet", but made no personnel changes when he took office, pledging to retain Obuchi's ministers, maintain the 3-party coalition and continue his policies to try to improve the economic reforms based on Noboru Takeshita's 1988 reforms, as well as reforms that resembled US policies of Reaganomics.
