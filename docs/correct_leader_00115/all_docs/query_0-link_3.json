Mori called his government \"the Japan revival cabinet\", but made no personnel changes when he took office, pledging to retain Obuchi's ministers, maintain the 3-party coalition and continue his policies to try to revive the economy.[1][2][3]\n\nMori proved an unpopular Prime Minister due to a series of gaffes and the manner of his coming to power, and called early general elections for June 2000 to pre-empt a continuing decline in the LDP's poll numbers.[4][5] In the elections, the LDP lost the majority that it had built up through opposition defections since 1996, but the coalition held enough seats to retain government.[6] Therefore, the cabinet was dissolved in July when Mori was re-elected by the National Diet and replaced with the Second Mori Cabinet.\n\n5 April 2000 House of Representatives\n\nAbsolute majority (251/500) required Choice First Vote Votes YYoshirō Mori\n\n335 / 500\n\nYukio Hatoyama\n\n95 / 500\n\nOthers and Abstentions (Including blank ballots)\n\n70 / 500\n\nSource Diet Minutes - 147th Session Archived 2016-09-18 at the Wayback Machine\n\nLiberal Democratic\n\nNew Komeito\n\nNew Conservative\n\nIndependent\n\nR = Member of the House of Representatives\n\nC = Member of the House of Councillors\n\nFirst Mori Cabinet from April 5, 2000 to July 4, 2000 Portfolio Minister Term of Office Prime Minister Yoshirō Mori R April 5, 2000 - April 26, 2001 Minister of Justice Hideo Usui R October 5, 1999 - July 4, 2000 Minister of Foreign Affairs Yōhei Kōno R October 5, 1999 - April 26, 2001 Minister of Finance Kiichi Miyazawa R July 30, 1998 - April 26, 2001 Minister of Education\n\nDirector of the Science and Technology Agency Hirofumi Nakasone C October 5, 1999 - July 4, 2000 Minister of Health and Welfare Yuya Niwa R October 5, 1999 - July 4, 2000 Minister of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Tokuichiro Tamazawa R October 5, 1999 - July 4, 2000 Minister of International Trade and Industry Takashi Fukaya R October 5, 1999 - July 4, 2000 Minister of Transport\n\nDirector of the Hokkaido Development Agency Toshihiro Nikai R October 5, 1999 - July 4, 2000 Minister of Posts and Telecommunications Eita Yashiro R October 5, 1999 - July 4, 2000 Minister of Labour Takamori Makino R October 5, 1999 - July 4, 2000 Minister of Construction\n\nDirector of the National Land Agency Masaaki Nakayama R October 5, 1999 - July 4, 2000 Minister of Home Affairs\n\nDirector of the National Public Safety Commission Kosuke Hori R October 5, 1999 - July 4, 2000 Chief Cabinet Secretary\n\nDirector of the Okinawa Development Agency Mikio Aoki C October 5, 1999 - July 4, 2000 Chairman of the Financial Reconstruction Commission Sadakazu Tanigaki R February 25, 2000 - July 4, 2000 Director of the Management and Coordination Agency Kunihiro Tsuzuki C October 5, 1999 - December 5, 2000 Director of the Japan Defense Agency Tsutomu Kawara R October 5, 1999 - July 4, 2000 Director of the Economic Planning Agency Taichi Sakaiya - July 30, 1998 - December 5, 2000 Deputy Secretaries Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary (Bureaucrat) Teijiro Furukawa - February 24, 1995 - September 22, 2003\n\nPages at the Kantei (English website):"
