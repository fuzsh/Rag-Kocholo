V. Putin, President of the Russian Federation, â¦ reached mutual understanding that the commencement of the consultations on joint economic activities on Etorofu, Kunashiri, Shikotan, and the Habomai Islands by Japan and Russia can be a significant step toward the conclusion of a peace treaty.\n\n4Japan and Russia stand on the basis that this Statement and any agreement achieved thereon concerning the coordination on the joint economic activities as well as the implementation of the joint economic activities are without prejudice to the positions of Japan and the Russian Federation concerning the issue of a peace treaty.\n\n5The two leaders agreed to proceed with the negotiations on the joint economic activities on the above-mentioned islands and expressed their sincere determination to resolve the issue of a peace treaty.\n\n*Provisional translation\n\nPress Statement (Grave Visits etc. by Former Island Residents) (Excerpton)\n\nThe two leaders expressed their endorsement to create favorable conditions for the people-to-people exchange between the two states. In particular, they touched upon the theme on the visits by former island residents to the graves of their ancestors, which have been implemented based on the agreement dated July 2, 1986 between Japan and the Soviet Union. The two leaders agreed, on the basis of humanitarian considerations, that the scheme of the implementation of the above agreement requires improvement that takes into account, above all, advanced age of the Japanese participants in these visits. In this regard, the two leaders instructed their respective Ministries of Foreign Affairs to promptly consider possible measures including the setting up of additional temporary passing points and the further simplification of the current procedures.\n\n*Provisional translation\n\nã"
