        "text": "\"I don't know if politics should be steered merely by public opinion polls,\" said former Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori, successor to the late Keizo Obuchi who collapsed in April 2000. Support for Mori's Cabinet plummeted after he had stated \"Japan is a nation of gods with the emperor at the center,\" and despite dissolving the House of Representatives, the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) failed to win a single-party majority.\n\nAlthough Mori stayed on as prime minister, his approval rating remained low due to a string of resignations by party officials and Cabinet members related to corruption scandals. When the figures dropped to single digits, a move to \"demote Mori\" surfaced within the LDP, forcing him to step down after just a year in office as the party moved up its leadership vote.\n\nThe sharp decline in support for current Prime Minister Fumio Kishida's Cabinet is such that a review of political history at the start of this century is necessary. The approval rate for his Cabinet plunged to a record low of 21% in a nationwide opinion poll conducted by the Mainichi Shimbun. Other news media have also reported figures falling below 30%.\n\n\"Aoki's Law,\" said to be devised by former Chief Cabinet Secretary Mikio Aoki, who also played a role in bringing Mori to power, is often discussed at times like these. According to this, an administration is in the danger zone if the sum of approval ratings for the Cabinet and the LDP falls below 50 percentage points. This number has dropped to 45 points, according to Mainichi opinion polls.\n\nIt is said that the factors influencing support rates are Cabinet reshuffles, scandals and proceedings in the Diet. Kishida reshuffled his Cabinet in September in an attempt to regain support, but it soon backfired due to the scandal-induced resignations of senior members including a parliamentary vice minister and senior vice ministers. Recovering from here will not be easy if the opposition parties continue their offensive during supplementary budget deliberations.\n\n\"They call me a 'dying man' (a term synonym to 'lame duck') but as you can see, I am in extremely good health,\" and, \"It's disrespectful to all the farmers in Japan to call me a 'husk' prime minister.\" These are nonsensical comments by Mori, who was regarded as a \"rice husk\" with no actual substance just before stepping down from office. Approval ratings are an indicator of citizens' contentment. Instead of complaining about public opinion polls, prime ministers should directly face the numbers and carefully think about what they mean.\n\n(\"Yoroku\" is a front-page column in the Mainichi Shimbun.)"
