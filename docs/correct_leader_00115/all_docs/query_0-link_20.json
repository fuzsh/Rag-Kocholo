The contacts between the heads of state were candid and open, including a recent meeting in Irkutsk, which contributed to deeper understanding of each other’s positions and showed mutual desire to solve complicated problems.\n\nVladimir Putin emphasized Mr Yoshiro Mori’s personal achievement in “laying a solid basis for promoting Russian-Japanese relations in all directions.”\n\nIn conclusion, Mr Putin expressed hope that Mr Mori “as a highly respected politician of present-day Japan, will further contribute to the development of Russian-Japanese relations.”"
