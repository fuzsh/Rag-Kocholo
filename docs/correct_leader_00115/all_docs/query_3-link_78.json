        "text": "The head of the Tokyo Olympics organising committee has resigned after he was criticised for making \"inappropriate\" remarks about women.\n\nYoshiro Mori, 83, was quoted as saying women talk too much and that meetings with many female board directors would \"take a lot of time\", reports the BBC.\n\nThe remarks set off a firestorm of protest and Mori apologised at the time but said he would not resign.\n\nHowever, the pressure on him to step down had been steadily increasing.\n\nMajor sponsors had also come forward to criticise the former Japanese prime minister's comments, including Toyota, one of the biggest Olympic backers.\n\nToyota's president Akio Toyoda said the company was \"disappointed\" at the remarks.\n\nOn Tuesday, a group of female lawmakers wore white in a protest against his remarks, with some men doing the same in solidarity.\n\nAnd Tokyo governor Yuriko Koike said she would not attend a meeting of high-level Olympic officials in protest.\n\nAccording to local media, almost 400 people have also withdrawn applications to volunteer at the Olympic games, which are scheduled for later this year.The committee board currently has 24 members, five of whom are women.\n\nIn 2019, the committee - which is responsible for selecting Japanese Olympians - set itself a goal of increasing the number of female board directors to 40%.\n\n\"If we increase the number of female board members, we have to make sure their speaking time is restricted somewhat, they have difficulty finishing, which is annoying,\" Mori was quoted as saying.\n\n\"We have about seven women at the organising committee, but everyone understands their place,\" he said.\n\nMori is known in the country for a string of gaffes and undiplomatic statements made while in office from 2000 to 2001.\n\nHe told Japan's Mainichi newspaper that female family members had also lambasted him after his comments.\n\n\"Last night, my wife gave me a thorough scolding. She said: 'You've said something bad again, haven't you? I'm going to have to suffer again because you've antagonised women',\" he said.\n\n\"This morning, my daughter and granddaughter scolded me as well,\" the paper quoted him as saying."
