        "text": "New Premier Takes Office in Japan and Vows Continuity\n\nBy CALVIN SIMS\n\nOKYO, April 5 -- In Nagatacho, Tokyo's political hub, Yoshiro Mori, who was elected prime minister today, is often referred to as \"an elephant with a flea's heart,\" a reference to his 220-pound frame and what many of his critics say is his indecisiveness, especially under fire.\n\nMr. Mori, 62, who has been in Parliament for more than 30 years, has held several cabinet posts, including the trade and education portfolios, and is considered an adept political operator.\n\nLately he has played a pivotal role in keeping the Liberal Democratic Party's coalition, one of the largest in decades, intact. He is also said to have especially warm relations with New Komeito, a Buddhist-backed party whose strength is greater than that of the Liberal Party, which recently defected from the coalition.\n\nWhat Mr. Mori does not have is experience in either the foreign or finance ministries, two government powerhouses where several of his predecessors have served. Those deficiencies, together with a reputation for blunt talk that has got him in trouble in the past, have prompted some to question whether he is little more than an interim leader until a general election can be called.\n\nMr. Mori's lack of broad experience may be an immediate handicap given the fact that as the world's second-largest economic power Japan is in frequent contact with foreign officials and that it is scheduled to be host at the annual summit meeting of the world's leading economic powers in Okinawa in July. The meeting will include Russia's new president, Vladimir V. Putin, whom Mr. Mori is now expected to meet later this month on his first overseas trip as prime minister.\n\nBut Mr. Mori's domestic policy views are not well known either. Like many politicians of his generation he has steadily climbed the political ladder here by staying assiduously loyal to the leadership of the dominant party, the Liberal Democrats, not by staking out policy initiatives or specialties. When he has attracted attention it has usually been because of his blunt language or a flip remark.\n\nIn January, he apologized to AIDS patients after he likened them to unwelcome guests. \"When I visited a village, all farmers out in the fields went home, as if AIDS had come in town,\" he was reported to have said. And last month, he angered many people in Okinawa by saying that teachers there opposed the government's new policy of requiring the national anthem at functions because they were \"controlled by Communists\" and \"oppose everything the government does.\"\n\nAt his first news conference as prime minister tonight, he said that in both cases his comments had been taken out of context.\n\nIn the late 1980's Mr. Mori was implicated in a major stocks-for-favor scandal known as Recruit that toppled Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita. Mr. Mori admitted making more than $950,000 by selling shares that he had acquired in a company before it went public.\n\nAt his news conference tonight, he seemed to brush aside the 11-year-old scandal by characterizing it as a \"regular business transaction,\" a remark that struck some as dangerously cavalier.\n\nBefore being named prime minister, Mr. Mori was the Liberal Democrats' secretary general, the party's No. 2 position, and was a close ally of Keizo Obuchi, the stricken prime minister whom he replaces.\n\n\"When continuity is most important you need someone like Mori who is colorless and can fit into any kind of mold,\" said Yukio Okamoto, a political consultant. \"Because he is not biased in his ideology and political beliefs, he can change according to the situation. He was a safe bet because he epitomizes middle of the road.\"\n\nWhile members of Mr. Mori's party praised his selection as prime minister, some opposition party legislators ridiculed it. Hiroshi Kawauchi, a Democratic Party lawmaker, said, \"I think he's better suited to be a sumo wrestling stable master than prime minister of a country.\"\n\nAt his news conference Mr. Mori clearly signaled that he would make no major changes. He offered no new policy agenda but vowed to continue Mr. Obuchi's economic plan. He also retained Mr. Obuchi's cabinet.\n\n\"I will aim to achieve a government that would walk with the people and is trusted by the people,\" he said.\n\nHe said that he had no immediate plans to call elections, despite the rumors today that the party was considering moving them up to take advantage of public sympathy over Mr. Obuchi's massive stroke.\n\nMr. Mori was born on July 14, 1937, to a family of middle-class rice farmers in Neagari, a rural town in Ishikawa Prefecture on the coast of the Sea of Japan. Politics ran in the family, and both Mr. Mori's father and grandfather served as the town's mayor.\n\nMr. Mori graduated from prestigious Waseda University where he majored in commerce and pursued his boyhood passion for rugby. But an illness forced him to give up the sport, and on a whim he joined the debating club, where he met Mr. Obuchi.\n\nAfter working briefly as a newspaper reporter in the early 1960's, Mr. Mori started his political career as secretary to a member of Parliament and was elected a member himself in 1969 at age 32. He has been re-elected nine times.\n\nMr. Mori was named to his first cabinet post, as education minister, in 1983, followed by an appointment as trade minister in 1992. When Mr. Obuchi became prime minister in 1998, Mr. Mori assumed the party's second-ranking job. Mr. Mori and his wife, Chieko, have a daughter and son.\n\nJunzo Nishino, who played rugby with Mr. Mori when the two were in high school, dismissed criticism that his former teammate lacked the leadership skills to be prime minister. \"He's a very considerate and compassionate man,\" Mr. Nishino said. \"Whenever we wanted to exclude some boys from the game, Mori-san would always say, 'No, let's give him a chance to train harder and improve his ability.' \""
