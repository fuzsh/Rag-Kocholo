        "text": "Mori Yoshiro (born July 14, 1937, Neagari, Ishikawa prefecture, Japan) is a Japanese politician who was prime minister in 2000–01 during a period of economic downturn.\n\nBoth Mori’s father and grandfather had been mayor of Neagari. He received a degree in commerce from Waseda University, Tokyo, in 1959. He became secretary to a member of the Diet (parliament) in 1962, and in 1969 he was elected as an independent to the House of Representatives, after which he joined the Liberal-Democratic Party (LDP). He held a number of powerful positions in the government and the party. In 1983–84 he served as minister of education and in 1992–93 minister of international trade and industry, and in 1995 he was appointed minister of construction. In 1993 he became secretary-general of the LDP, and he was reappointed in 1998. Although he was connected with the stock scandal of 1989 that brought down the government of Prime Minister Takeshita Noboru, he himself was not prosecuted.\n\nAfter his longtime associate Obuchi Keizo was incapacitated by a stroke on April 2, 2000, Mori was elected president of the LDP and on April 5 became prime minister. Plagued by cabinet scandals, an inability to reverse the country’s economic recession, and a habit of making blunt, insensitive comments, he proved to be highly unpopular. The LDP suffered losses in June elections for the House and was forced into a coalition government. Amid growing calls for change, he announced on April 6, 2001, that he would step down upon the election of a new LDP president later in the month."
