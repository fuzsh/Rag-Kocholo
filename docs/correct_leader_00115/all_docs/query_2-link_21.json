        "text": "CNN International World News\n\nNew Prime Minister Gives First Address To Japanese Parliament\n\nAired April 7, 2000 - 0:00 a.m. ET\n\nTHIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.\n\nCOLLEEN MCEDWARDS, WORLD NEWS: Japan's new prime minister Yoshiro Mori is presenting his first policy speech to the country's parliament. He has been in office only two days. He has reappointed all the cabinet ministers of his predecessor, Keizo Obuchi. Mr. Mori also says he will not make major changes in Mr. Obuchi's policies.\n\nMr. Obuchi was left comatose by a massive stroke on Sunday. We want to take you to Tokyo live now for coverage of the prime minister's address.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\n\nMARINA KAMIMURA, CNN TOKYO BUREAU CHIEF (voice-over): .newest leader, Yoshiro Mori, sounded the eternal optimist on his first full day on the job.\n\nYOSHIRO MORI, JAPANESE PRIME MINISTER (through translator): I wanted to see Mount Fuji this morning when I was having breakfast. If it were a little brighter, it might have possible, just like the economy. I'm looking at the skies with hope.\n\nKAMIMURA: His first official duty - talks with a senior official of China's Communist Party. Once again, pressing on with the agenda set forth by his predecessor, Keizo Obuchi, who had hoped to meet with China's president early this summer before he succumbed to a stroke.\n\nEver since he was elected Wednesday, Mr. Mori has been dodging criticism he's just a convenient replacement for his friend and predecessor. Mr. Mori was chosen to replace Mr. Obuchi as party president and subsequently prime minister in classic Japanese political style - in closed door meetings between groups of his ruling Liberal Democrats.\n\nEven those within his party criticize the process.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (through translator): The way the whole thing was decided so swiftly shows clearly how much fractional politics rule the LDP. That's why there are no candidates for the presidential race. It looks like the clock is moving backwards.\n\nKAMIMURA: And so, calls are growing for a snap election to give Japanese voters a chance to make their voices heard. No matter who is at the helm, Japan will have a general election before October.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator): I think the Diet should be dissolved and an election held as soon as possible so that the will of the people can be reflected.\n\nKAMIMURA (on camera): The Japanese admire cherry blossoms for their fleeting beauty - quick to blossom, but equally quick to fall. Analysts say Mr. Mori will have his hands full trying to avoid the same fate.\n\nMarina Kamimura, CNN, Tokyo.\n\n(END VIDEOTAPE)\n\nCOLLEEN MCEDWARDS, WORLD NEWS: And obviously, that was Marina Kamimura's report. It was not his live address. But we do plan to bring it to you when it happens.\n\nEND\n\nTO ORDER VIDEOTAPES AND TRANSCRIPTS OF CNN INTERNATIONAL PROGRAMMING, PLEASE CALL 800-CNN-NEWS OR USE THE SECURE ONLINE ORDER FROM LOCATED AT www.fdch.com"
