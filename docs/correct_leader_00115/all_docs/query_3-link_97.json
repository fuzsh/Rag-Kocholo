        "text": "TOKYO Japanese Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori faces the biggest crisis of his 10-month rule with his popularity in tatters and mounting speculation that he'll be forced to resign next month.\n\nThe question mark over who will run Japan comes amidst growing concern of the nation's faltering economy and tense ties with the United States after a U.S. submarine sank a Japanese trawler off Hawaii, leaving nine missing, presumed dead.\n\nMore than 77 percent of voters polled in a new survey released on Sunday said they wanted Mori, under fire for a string of gaffes and scandals and a nagging golf habit, to quit soon.\n\nA mere 8.4 percent of those responding to the poll by private broadcaster Asahi television said they still supported Mori -- a rating which past premiers have found impossible to survive.\n\nSpeculation is swirling that leaders of the ruling three-way coalition will force Mori to resign in order to improve their chances in an Upper House election in July.\n\nTop executives of the two coalition partners whose support keeps Mori in office denied on Sunday that their parties had already agreed he must step down in early March.\n\nBut they failed to pledge future support, saying a decision to replace him rested with Mori's Liberal Democratic Party (IDP).\n\nNew Komeito Secretary General Tetsuzo Fuyushiba said his number two ruling party would not back a no-confidence motion if opposition parties submitted one before the budget for the next fiscal year was adopted by Parliament's powerful Lower House.\n\nBut asked if Mori should stay on after the budget was passed, Fuyushiba said: \"That is an issue for the LDP. We will be giving our opinion.\"\n\nEven LDP Secretary General Makoto Koga failed to give the embattled premier a guarantee of job security.\n\nAsked if Mori would lead the party to the Upper House election, Koga said: \"There will be various matters to emerge and the budget is at a critical juncture. What is most important is to resolve each issue, and for that, party unity is essential.\"\n\nFor his part, Mori told business leaders on Friday evening that he intended to \"hang on\", Kyodo news agency reported.\n\nCriticism of Mori from the media and politicians of all persuasions reached a crescendo after he carried on with his golf game despite learning that the USS Greenville nuclear submarine had crashed into and sunk the Japanese trawler carrying students.\n\nThen reports emerged that Mori had been playing heavily his rounds almost for free at two expensive golf clubs.\n\n\"The voices criticizing Prime Minister Mori are very loud,\" Fuyushiba said. \"Our desks are piled high with faxes and mail and we are telling him so.\"\n\nLawmakers in the LDP itself are growing increasingly worried about the impact of Mori's disappearing popular support on their own chances in the Upper House election.\n\nLDP members of the Tokyo Assembly, facing their own election in June, last week urged the party to move up the timetable for an LDP presidential election not mandated until September.\n\nNow LDP young Turks who last year campaigned heavily for Mori's ouster are renewing their calls for him to quit, domestic media said on Sunday.\n\n\"Not only the public, but also the party has given up on Mori,\" LDP lawmaker Yoshihide Suga told the conservative nationwide daily **** Yomiuri Shimbun. ****\n\nThe most oft-cited scenario is for Mori to step down after the Lower House adopts the budget, probably in early March. The budget becomes law a month after passage by the powerful Lower Chamber even if the Upper House does not vote on it.\n\nAnother option would be for the LDP to decide at a March 13 convention to change its party rules and bring forward the election for party president -- a post which ensures the premiership as long as the ruling camp controls the Lower House.\n\nBut the LDP's Koga said such a rule change would be difficult and he was not considering it now.\n\nMori himself has been hanging tough and the coalition appears to be having trouble agreeing on a replacement.\n\nAmong the names floated are wily LDP elder Hiromu Nonaka, who has close ties with the new Komeito. But Nonaka, 75, is known for his penchant for backroom deals, and selecting him would do little for the ruling camp's tarnished image with voters.\n\nMany younger LDP lawmakers are believed to favor Junichiro Koizumi, 59, the quixotic head of Mori's own faction in the LDP and a proponent of economic reforms.\n\nNearly one-third of voters polled by Asahi television said anyone would do. Koizumi topped the list of those specifically named, with about 10 percent.\n\n(Reuter)"
