        "text": "Speaking on behalf of the Office of the President today, Spokesperson Xavier Chang (張惇涵) expressed sincere gratitude to former Japanese Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori for leading a cross-party delegation of Diet members to Taiwan on August 9 to commemorate our late former President Lee Teng-hui. Spokesperson Chang also stated that our guests will be properly received based on international diplomatic protocol, while also following Taiwan Centers for Disease Control guidelines and domestic disease control standards to ensure the safety of delegation members from both countries and Taiwan citizens.\n\nSpokesperson Chang added that former Prime Minister Mori has always been an important and steadfast friend of Taiwan, and leading a non-partisan Diet delegation to Taiwan shows the international community's admiration for former President Lee's achievements in promoting Taiwan's democracy. He also said that this visit shows the close friendship between Taiwan and Japan, and that he is sure bilateral exchanges will continue to grow. In the future, Taiwan and Japan will also strengthen cooperation in substantive areas including disease prevention, while continuing to work together to maintain regional stability, prosperity, and development.\n\nSpokesperson Chang thanked former Prime Minister Mori and his delegation for following domestic COVID-19 prevention regulations to minimize the impact on the public. After the memorial venue for former President Lee closes to the public at 5:00 PM, former Prime Minister Mori and his delegation will head to the Taipei Guest House to pay their respects. Spokesperson Chang also urged members of the public who wish to pay their respects to former President Lee that day to please enter the venue early and depart promptly before 5:00 PM, and apologized for any inconvenience."
