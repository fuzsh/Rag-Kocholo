        "text": "CNN International World News\n\nNew Japanese Prime Minister Makes Controversial Remark\n\nAired May 17, 2000 - 2:03 a.m. ET\n\nTHIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.\n\nMICHAEL HOLMES, WORLD NEWS: Japan's prime minister, Yoshiro Mori, is under criticism from opposition leaders and Asian neighbors for saying Japan is a, quote, \"divine nation.\" That's a term many people recognize from the 1930s and `40s when Japanese troops rampaged through much of Asia.\n\nCNN's Tokyo bureau chief Marina Kamimura reports.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\n\nMARINA KAMIMURA, CNN TOKYO BUREAU CHIEF (voice-over): When Yoshiro Mori was chosen to become the 55th person to sit in Japan's prime minister's office, questions were raised about the rugby-playing politician's track record - not on the field, but off-the-cuff remarks he'd made in the past.\n\nEarlier this year, Mr. Mori was quoted as saying Americans had bought guns to prepare for potential Y2K problems, saying when the power goes out in the U.S., gangs and murderers come out. This time, Mr. Mori told fellow lawmakers that Japan is a divine country with the emperor at its core.\n\nThat was a bedrock principle in Japan before World War II, but it's problematic now because of the strict separation between state and religion that was carefully etched out in post-World War II Japan, particularly relevant for other countries in Asia, since Japan's aggression in the years leading up to and including that war were made in the name of the so-called divine emperor.\n\nTAKASHI INOGUCHI, UNIV. OF TOKYO: In the constitution, the politics should be separated from religion very clearly and then his difference to his support for one of the religious organization can be very damaging.\n\nKAMIMURA: As Mr. Mori attended the private funeral to lay to rest his predecessor, Keizo Obuchi, his remarks created a firestorm in Japan's political circles. The new prime minister made an effort to calm the critics, saying he never meant to contradict post-second world war principles, saying that Japan's sovereignty rests with its people, not its emperor.\n\nMr. Mori says he only meant to encourage the Japanese to cherish their culture. But with a general election expected next month, this is one play the opposition, and even those within his party, will be keen to exploit.\n\nMarina Kamimura, CNN, Tokyo.\n\n(END VIDEOTAPE)\n\nEND\n\nTO ORDER VIDEOTAPES AND TRANSCRIPTS OF CNN INTERNATIONAL PROGRAMMING, PLEASE CALL 800-CNN-NEWS OR USE THE SECURE ONLINE ORDER FROM LOCATED AT www.fdch.com"
