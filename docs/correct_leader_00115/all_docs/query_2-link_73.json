        "text": "Japan's prime minister, Yoshiro Mori, told his cabinet today that he would stand down after just a year in office, signalling the end of one of the country's most unpopular governments since the end of the second world war.\n\nMr Mori, under fire for months over verbal gaffes and mistakes, had been long expected to quit. The ruling Liberal Democrat party (LDP) is planning to hold a leadership election on April 24 to choose a successor.\n\nHowever, his resignation is unlikely to solve Japan's mounting problems. A long-awaited recovery from the lengthy economic downturn has stalled and banks are still crippled by a decade-long debt crisis.\n\n\"I made up my mind to resign because I think it is necessary to tackle mounting issues both at home and abroad under a new administration,\" Mr Mori was quoted as saying by the chief cabinet secretary, Yasuo Fukuda.\n\nThere is general agreement in Japan that Mr Mori leaves the country hungering for leadership, and that his mistakes have severely damaged the LDP, which has ruled nearly uninterrupted since 1955.\n\n\"Japan needs economic reforms no matter who the prime minister is,\" said Masumi Ishikawa, a political expert at Obirin university in Tokyo. \"The year 2001 will be the year that made it clear that the LDP is finally falling apart.\"\n\nThe cabinet today announced an emergency economic package that set a two-year deadline for banks to dispose of their riskiest bad loans. One estimate has the level of debt at Â£73.5bn.\n\nThe apparent front runner to replace Mr Mori is the former prime minister, Ryutaro Hashimoto, who served from 1996 to 1998. Mr Hashimoto heads the LDP's largest faction and reportedly has the support of two other factions.\n\nMr Hashimoto said today that he was flattered by the attention, but stopped short of declaring his candidacy.\n\nAnother politician often mentioned as a possible candidate, reform-minded Junichiro Koizumi, gave his strongest indication yet that he intends to seek the prime minister's post.\n\n\"You have to fight when you have to fight,\" said Mr Koizumi. \"It would be cowardly to avoid the contest out of a fear of losing.\"\n\nThe former health minister is popular with the public, but analysts see his chances as slim because he has provoked distrust within the party with his calls to privatise the postal service.\n\nMr Mori took office in April 2000 after the prime minister, Keizo Obuchi, suffered a fatal stroke. His selection in a closed-door meeting of LDP bigwigs immediately came under heavy criticism and he was widely assailed as a policy lightweight.\n\nHe has also been attacked for comments recalling Japan's wartime emperor worship and militarism, and for his decision to continue a round of golf in February after being told of the collision of a US submarine and a fishing vessel, in which nine Japanese were killed.\n\nRelated articles\n\n27.03.2001: The down turn\n\n13.03.2001: Japanese PM calls early party elections\n\n13.03.2001: Mori?
