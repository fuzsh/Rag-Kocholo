        "text": "TOKYO -- A political fundraising scandal in Japan has hit the ruling Liberal Democratic Party hard, particularly its largest intra-party faction once led by the late Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, potentially creating room for the government to relax its cautious immigration policy.\n\nMinisters of Prime Minister Fumio Kishida's cabinet and executive members of the LDP who belong to the faction have lost their posts. Now that the faction, which has produced Abe and multiple other prime ministers, has come to a point where its grip on the LDP may weaken, the governing party may well change its policy direction."
