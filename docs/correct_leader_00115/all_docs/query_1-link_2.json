        "text": "In this story:\n\nSpeculation\n\nNo win situation\n\nDisaffected voters\n\nRELATED STORIES, SITES\n\nTOKYO, Japan -- Japanese Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori said Friday he has decided to resign to make way for a new political structure.\n\nThe chief cabinet secretary said in a news conference Mori's announcement came during a meeting with his cabinet, and confirms what he told the leadership of his party earlier in the week.\n\nIt also paves the way to move up the country's presidential elections from September to this month.\n\nAn LDP official said the party plans to hold those elections April 24.\n\nLocal media reports said it is likely that following the presidential elections, a new prime minister will be elected and sworn in April 26.\n\nWhoever wins the party leadership position will almost certainly be named the country's next prime minister, because of the LDP-led coalition's majority in Japan's parliament.\n\nSpeculation\n\nThere had been increased speculation Mori would step down, following several recent \"slips of the tongue\" and other blunders, including his continuation of a golf game after receiving word of the collision between a U.S. Navy sub and a Japanese fishing trawler Feb. 9 that left nine Japanese missing.\n\nThere has also been dissatisfaction with the prime minister because the nation's economy has shown no signs of improvement.\n\nBut although the end of Yoshiro Mori's unhappy tenure as Japan's prime minister is now in sight, few people expect any turnaround in the nations political or economic environment.\n\nThe decision to bring the curtain down on Mori's term in office comes a year after he took the job, replacing Keizo Obuchi, who suffered a fatal stroke. He will leave as one of the most unpopular prime ministers Japan has seen since World War Two.\n\nWhile there exists a host of potential successors, not one has formally thrust his hand into the air because of the likelihood that whoever takes over as prime minister will suffer just as much of a political headache from the countries spiraling economic woes.\n\nEven worse news is that the new prime minister will serve until September, when Mori's term originally would have expired.\n\nNo win situation\n\nSydney-based Macquarie Bank chief economist Richard Gibbs said it remains far from certain who will succeed Mori.\n\n\"There's reluctance to take the leadership ahead of the upper house (parliamentary) elections, which of course are in July in Japan, because in some respects it's seen in political circles as being a bit of a poisoned chalice,\" he told CNN.\n\nFew pundits doubt that after the disaster of Mori's gaffe-prone tenure, the three-way coalition that makes up the LDP would lose significant power in the Diet, and may even lose power.\n\nOnly former LDP policy chief Taku Yamasaki has said he will run in the internal leadership election -- but only if nobody else does. Economics Minister Taro Aso said on Tuesday he was considering his candidacy in response to calls to run by some young members of the LDP.\n\nAmong the others considered eligible to become Japan's 11th prime minister in 12 years are former prime minister Ryutaro Hashimoto, who heads the party's largest faction; Junichiro Koizumi, a former health minister; and Hiromu Nonaka, an LDP powerbroker.\n\nHashimoto appears to have become the front-runner, with Junichiro Koizumi recently appearing to lose some support because of his calls to privatize the postal service. Nonaka, who was once considered Mori's most likely replacement, belongs to the Hashimoto faction of the LDP.\n\nMakoto Koga, the Liberal Democratic Party secretary-general, proposed the election date after a morning meeting with Mori.\n\nThe date still needs to be approved by other party officials and a final decision was scheduled for next Tuesday, said party spokesman Makoto Tsuji.\n\nMori agreed in a meeting with Koga on Wednesday to resign as prime minister after the new president is selected. The party president is virtually assured of the prime minister's job because of the Liberal Democrats' dominance in the Diet, or Japanese parliament.\n\nDisaffected voters\n\nA poll released by a major newspaper Thursday indicated Japan's voters would prefer none of the leading contenders.\n\nInstead, the politician most said they would like to see lead the nation is Makiko Tanaka, the outspoken daughter of the late Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka. She was supported by nearly 31 percent of those polled; Koizumi was second with almost 18 percent.\n\nFew believe she has the power base within the party to actually stand as a candidate. But Tanaka, 57, has repeatedly been singled out in popularity polls because of her image as a straight shooter.\n\nIronically, Makiko Tanaka's father came to symbolize backroom power politics before being forced out of office and disgraced in the 1970s in a bribery scandal.\n\nRELATED STORIES:\n\nParty shows Mori the way out\n\nApril 4, 2001\n\nJapan's LDP deny election date is set\n\nMarch 29, 2001\n\nJapan's Mori defends royal snub\n\nMarch 28, 2001\n\nJapan's Mori stands up Norwegian royals\n\nMarch 28, 2001\n\nMori's job remains up for grabs\n\nMarch 26, 2001\n\nRELATED SITE:\n\nLiberal Democratic Party of Japan\n\nNote: Pages will open in a new browser window\n\nExternal sites are not endorsed by CNN Interactive."
