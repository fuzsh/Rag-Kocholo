PVCz irradiated with γ-rays in a film form showed a higher conductivity and threshold voltage than films cast after irradiation in powder form. Purification of irradiated PVCz by precipitation from a benzene solution reduced the effects of γ-irradiation. Preheat treatment increases crystallinity and conductivity but not the threshold voltage.",
