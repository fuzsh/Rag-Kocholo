        "text": "– All talk. The Tokyo 2020—now 2021—Games had enough problems. The Olympics slated for this summer have already been postponed because of the pandemic, public opinion in Japan is turning against the Games, and it looks like any spectators allowed to attend the event will be banned from cheering. (Claps only, please.)\n\nAnd then on Wednesday, Yoshiro Mori, head of the Tokyo 2020 Olympics organizing committee, said that meetings with too many women drag on because women talk too much.\n\nMori explained the phenomenon this way: “Women have a strong sense of rivalry. If one raises her hand to speak, all the others feel the need to speak, too. Everyone ends up saying something.”\n\nHe made the comments as the Japan Olympic Committee Council discussed increasing the share of women members on sports organizations’ executive boards. “If we increase the number of female board members, we have to make sure their speaking time is restricted somewhat, they have difficulty finishing, which is annoying,” Mori said, according to Reuters.\n\nNot only are Mori’s comments sexist, research suggests they are wrong. A review of research from 1951 to 1991 found that of 56 studies of mixed-sex interaction, only two said that women talk more than men. A 2012 study from researchers at BYU and Princeton discovered that women spoke much less than their proportional representation, spending roughly 75% less time talking than their male counterparts.\n\nStill, women are perceived as talking more than men, even when they don’t, and while men benefit from talking more—listeners find them to be more competent—women don’t get the same bump.\n\nTo be fair, most of that research has studied English language interactions, but it’s hard to imagine the outcomes being much different in Japan, where men dominate politics and corporate settings. Japan ranks No. 166 out of 200 for female representation in parliament, according to the Inter-Parliamentary Union, well below Saudi Arabia and Pakistan. Japan was 121st out of 153 nations on the World Economic Forum’s global gender gap report last year.\n\nOf the 24 members on the Japan Olympic committee, five are women.\n\nKaori Yamaguchi, a former judo champion, accused Mori, 83, of undermining the Games’ goal of promoting equality and inclusion. “Gender equality and consideration for people with disabilities were supposed to be a given for the Tokyo Games,” she said, according to the Kyodo news agency. “It is unfortunate to see the president of the organizing committee make a remark like that.”\n\nMori later acknowledged that his comments ran counter to the Olympic spirit, but he rejected calls to resign. And when asked if he really thought women talk too much, he said, “I don’t listen to women that much lately so I don’t know.”\n\nMedia coverage of his remarks mention that Mori, a former prime minister, is prone to gaffes like making insensitive references to AIDS and insulting his country’s Olympic athletes. He was one of the least popular prime ministers in Japan’s history and resigned after a year with an approval rating in the single digits.\n\nIt would be easy to read that history, roll your eyes, and think, ‘Well, what did they expect?’ But instead, perhaps we should be asking how he got his job in the first place.\n\nClaire Zillman\n\nclaire.zillman@fortune.com\n\n@clairezillman\n\nToday’s Broadsheet was curated by Emma Hinchliffe.\n\nALSO IN THE HEADLINES\n\n- Cleaning House. Representatives in the House voted yesterday on two questions: whether to keep Rep. Liz Cheney in a leadership position after her vote to impeach President Trump, and whether to strip Rep.

Cheney survived her vote; the House voted to boot Greene from her committee seats, 230 to 199.\n\n- Bills, bills, bills. Senators unveiled new proposals today. Sen. Amy Klobuchar, as chair of the Senate Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust, introduced an antitrust reform bill, the Competition and Antitrust Law Enforcement Reform Act. Sen. Mitt Romney introduced a GOP version of legislation to support families with children, offering up to $4,200 a year in direct payments. The plan cuts funding for some other welfare programs.\n\n- Continuing crisis. The NYT weighs in on the mental health crisis among America's moms with a multi-part package exploring women's experiences during the pandemic—and what might be done to help. New York Times\n\n- Ready, set, SPAC. 23andme, led by CEO Anne Wojcicki, is set to go public through merger with VG Acquisition Corp., a special purpose acquisition company founded by billionaire Richard Branson.

One of the financial supporters of the controversial app Parler is Rebekah Mercer, the GOP donor. The app's CEO, John Matze, says he was fired after a disagreement with Mercer. He says that she doesn't support imposing any restrictions on what users can say on the app—the issue that got Parler booted from app stores and Amazon Web Services. Mercer didn't respond to request for comment.
