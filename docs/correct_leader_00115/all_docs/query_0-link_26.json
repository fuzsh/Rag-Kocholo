        "text": "The head of the Tokyo Olympics organising committee has apologised for making \"inappropriate\" remarks about women, after calls for his resignation.\n\nYoshiro Mori retracted the comments but said he was not planning to stand down.\n\nThe Games chief, 83, was earlier quoted as saying women talk too much and that meetings with many female board directors would \"take a lot of time\".\n\nThe International Olympic Committee told Reuters it considered the \"issue closed\" following the apology.\n\nJapan's Olympic Minister Seiko Hashimoto said she wanted to hold \"thorough discussions\" with Mr Mori, a former Japanese prime minister.\n\n\"The Olympics' fundamental principle is to promote women's advancement in sport at all levels and organisations in order to realise gender equality,\" she said, according to local media.\n\nMr Mori made the remarks at Wednesday's meeting of the Japanese Olympic Committee.\n\nThe committee board currently has 24 members, five of whom are women.\n\nIn 2019, the committee - which is responsible for selecting Japanese Olympians - set itself a goal of increasing the number of female board directors to 40%.\n\n\"If we increase the number of female board members, we have to make sure their speaking time is restricted somewhat, they have difficulty finishing, which is annoying,\" Mr Mori was quoted as saying by the Asahi Shimbun newspaper.\n\n\"We have about seven women at the organising committee but everyone understands their place,\" he said.\n\nMr Mori is known in the country for a string of gaffes and undiplomatic statements he made while in office from 2000 to 2001.\n\nHis latest comments triggered anger on social media, with the hashtag #Moriresign trending on Twitter.\n\n\"Shame. It's time, get out,\" one user tweeted, while another urged athletes to boycott the Games if Mr Mori kept his job."
