        "text": "165 days before the opening ceremony, the Tokyo Games are still written in the conditional. But one question seems to be raised. It concerns Yoshiro Mori, the president of the organizing committee. Pointed out since last week for his misogynistic remarks, credited by an international NGO with the “gold medal of sexism”, the former Prime Minister will not resign. The matter is settled. He will keep his place.\n\nIn Japan, however, public opinion would happily see him out the door. A petition launched last Friday by several Japanese activists, demanding his resignation from the presidency of the Tokyo Games organizing committee, collected more than 110.000 signatures in less than 24 hours.\n\nAt the same time, a survey carried out by Kyodo News over the past weekend reveals that 60% of those surveyed now judge Yoshiro Mori “ non qualified \" for its function. Only 6.8% of respondents admitted that they still had confidence in him to lead preparations for the Games.\n\nBy his own admission, Yoshiro Mori wanted to give up his apron. He explained it to Mainichi shimbun : \" From the start, I did not feel a lasting attachment to the position of president (of the organizing committee). So first I wanted to resign. But I refrained from doing so after being dissuaded from leaving office by Toshiro Muto (the general director of the organizing committee) and by others. »\n\nAccording to Kyodo News, Yoshiro Mori would have become essential at the head of the organizing committee. A former university rugby player, who served as president of the Japan Rugby Federation, he was appointed president of the Tokyo Games in January 2014, when the organizing committee was created.\n\nSince then, the former Japanese Prime Minister has been unanimously unanimous, through his influence and his network, in the political world as well as in the sporting world. He would have helped overcome several crises, notably at the time of the IOC's decision to move the marathon and walking events to Sapporo, or more recently during the postponement of the Olympic and Paralympic Games by one year.\n\nAfter his sexist comments, the government very officially called him to order, reciting to him the principles of the Olympic Charter like a punished student. But, behind the scenes, Yoshiro Mori was not let go by anyone.\n\nThe Japanese Minister of Education, Koichi Hagiuda, considered his remarks completely “ inappropriate”, but he admits that he never had the intention of demanding his resignation.\n\nYuriko Koike, the governor of Tokyo, shares the same opinion. She also wants to see him retain his position in the months to come. His spats with Yoshiro Mori have, however, often been explosive in recent years, particularly when the cost of the Games climbed to heights never before approached in Olympic history.\n\nAn anonymous source within Yoshihide Suga's government, cited by Kyodo News, suggests without nuance: “ If he resigns, there will be no Olympics. We need him to continue whatever it takes.\"\n\nAccording to several major players in the Olympic movement, Yoshiro Mori managed to build a relationship over the years “ equals \" with Thomas Bach, the President of the IOC.\n\nClearly, Yoshiro Mori has become essential. In Japan, not a single name was mentioned to replace him, after the outcry caused by his sexist speech before the national Olympic committee. “ With less than six months until the Games, there is no alternative.”, says a source close to the matter.\n\nAt 83, the former Prime Minister will therefore retain his chair. But his team will have to work hard, in the weeks and months to come, to forget his remarks on “ women who talk too long.”\n\nSince last Saturday, the organizing committee began sending an apology email to the 80.000 volunteers recruited for the Olympic and Paralympic Games. The message begins with this sentence: “ President Mori made inappropriate comments that go against the spirit of the Olympic and Paralympic Games. »\n\nSufficient ? Not sure. According to the latest agency survey Kyodo News, carried out by telephone on February 6 and 7, 47,1% of those questioned think that the Tokyo Games should be postponed again, while 35,2% believe that the event should be canceled. In the opposite camp, only 14,5% of respondents responded that they wanted the Olympic and Paralympic meeting to take place as planned."
