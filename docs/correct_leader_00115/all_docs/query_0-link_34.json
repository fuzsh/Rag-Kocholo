        "text": "Yoshiro Mori, president of the Tokyo Olympic organizing committee believes women are the culprit when it comes to meetings that drag on too long. Women, he believes, talk too much, and he finds this “annoying.” But his gender insights don’t stop there. He also believes women’s greater competitiveness is what compels them to speak so much. Research suggests Mori is wrong on both counts. Despite stereotypes of talkative women, men tend to be more competitive and talk more.\n\nMori was responding to a question today about the Japan Olympic Committee’s goal to have more than 40% female members, and his comments were made in the presence of the Japan Olympic Committee and some reporters. “Board of directors meetings with many women take a lot of time,” Mori said. “When you increase the number of female executive members, if their speaking time isn’t restricted to a certain extent, they have difficulty finishing, which is annoying,” he added. He then explained why this happens, “Women are competitive. When one person raises a hand, others think they need to speak up as well. That’s why everyone speaks.” A mere five of the 24 Olympic committee members were women as of November according to the Washington Post.\n\nMori may be surprised to learn that there is little evidence to support his claims. In one review of 56 studies examining which sex talks more, Deborah James and Janice Drakich found only two of the studies revealed women talked more than men. A whopping 34 of the studies showed the opposite—that men talked more than women.\n\nIt turns out who speaks more has less to do with gender and more to do with status. The researchers concluded that those who speak more typically have higher status. At work, that’s more likely to be men. In an Olympic Committee meeting with five women and 19 men, odds are that the men have higher status and are speaking more as well.\n\nThe stereotype that females are the more talkative sex is widespread, and Mori is certainly not alone in his belief that women talk more than their male counterparts. For example, studies show that in the classroom, boys tend to speak more than their female counterparts. But ask the teachers in those same classrooms who speaks more, and they get it wrong, just like Mori. The teachers incorrectly believe that girls take up more class time speaking. In reality, these teachers gave the boys more opportunities.\n\nTo make things worse, when women do speak up, they sometimes face backlash for their assertiveness. One study found that male executives who spoke more often were perceived to be more competent. Women executives who did the same were perceived as less competent.\n\nMori’s explanation that women are more competitive is also unsupported by research. Research shows that men are typically more eager to compete and their performance gets a boost when they’re competing. In addition to their affinity for competition, men tend to be more overconfident in their abilities, which also leads them to pursue more competition.\n\nMisperceptions that women are too talkative and need to be shut down have some serious repercussions in the workplace. At a time when we’re encouraging women to “lean in,” it’s counterproductive to complain about women speaking out. Speaking up and having your voice heard is a necessary step in gaining recognition and sharing ideas. Instead of discouraging women from speaking up, we should be encouraging them to participate more."
