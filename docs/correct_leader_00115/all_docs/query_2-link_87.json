        "text": "Japan, an aging nation in which leadership positions in business and government are overwhelmingly dominated by men, had hoped that hosting the summer Olympic Games would afford an opportunity to showcase its vitality and commitment to gender equality.\n\nSo it seemed to me a little bizarre when, in 2014, the person Japan chose to lead the Japanese Olympic organizing committee was…another old guy.\n\nYoshiro Mori was arguably modern Japan’s least popular prime minister. He is undisputedly its most gaffe-prone. He was hounded out of office for, among other blunders, carrying on with his game golf after being informed that a U.S. submarine had collided with a Japanese fishing boat, killing nine people.\n\nOn Wednesday, Mori, 83, found himself at the center of a social media firestorm after the Japanese press reported that he had suggested during an online executive meeting of the committee, that the group limit the number of female members because women talk too much.\n\n“On boards with a lot of women, the board meetings take so much time,” Mori said, according to the Asahi Shimbun. “Women have a strong sense of competition. If one person raises their hand, others probably think, I need to say something too. That’s why everyone speaks.”\n\nMori apparently made the remarks in response to questions about plans to double the proportion of women on the Japanese Olympic Committee to 40% from 20%. “If you increase the number of women, you have to some extent limit the time for their remarks, otherwise you’ll run into trouble because it will never end,” he said.\n\nIt was not the kind of publicity Japan’s Olympic effort—or the nation’s current Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga—needs.\n\nThe Tokyo games spiraled over budget even before the pandemic, which forced organizers to postpone them for a year. Suga’s government is scrambling to convince the world and Japan’s citizens that it can ensure the safety of athletes and visitors to the games, which have been rescheduled to open July 23. Japan remains in a state of emergency and has yet to begin vaccinating its citizens.\n\nA recent survey found that only 16% of Japanese think the games should proceed.\n\nSuga and his predecessor, Shinzo Abe, have championed the idea of “Womenomics”—that government must push through new policies to make it easier for Japanese women to participate in the workplace. In theory, those policies should also help ease the burden to families of raising children, thus slowing the downward spiral in the nation’s birth rate.\n\nMori spent much of Thursday attempting to apologize and fend off calls for his resignation. Mostly, he just made things worse. Asked if he really thinks that women talk too much he reportedly replied: “I haven’t been listening to women talk recently, so I don’t know.”\n\nHe did allow, however, that perhaps he himself should talk a little less.\n\nClay Chandler\n\nclay.chandler@fortune.com\n\nThis edition of Eastworld was curated and produced by Grady McGregor.

The app boasts some 300 million daily active users and is popular in China's rural areas and lower-tier cities, unlike the Bytedance-owned Douyin (TikTok's sister app in China) that caters to a more urban elite crowd. With the IPO, along with booming livestreaming and e-commerce businesses, Kuaishou aims to enter the ranks of China's top tech giants. Fortune\n\nDisney+ India = success\n\nDisney+ has been a smashing success, acquiring nearly 70 million subscribers since the entertainment giant launched the streaming service in November 2019. Subscribers to a service Disney operates in India have accounted for nearly one quarter of that total, but Indian subscribers didn’t sign up to watch The Mandalorian or Marvel movies. Instead, Disney can attribute its success to cricket, as Fortune’s Eamon Barrett explains in a feature this week. Fortune\n\nAnt Group\n\nLate last year, Beijing quashed Alibaba founder Jack Ma’s plans for the blockbuster IPO of Ant Group, Alibaba’s fintech affiliate. Now it appears Ant Group may be back but in a much-diminished form since the firm and Chinese regulators have reportedly reached a deal to restructure Ant Group’s assets into a new holding company that would be under closer supervision of China’s government. Alibaba, meanwhile, posted better-than-expected quarterly earnings this week, but its stock price fell amid China’s regulatory crackdown. Fortune\n\nA bloodless coup\n\nIn one fell swoop, Myanmar’s military seized back control of the 6-year-old democracy on Monday, ousting and taking into custody democratically-elected President Aung San Suu Kyii, jailing politicians and activists, and shutting down phone lines and Internet access across the country. Washington has condemned the coup and hinted at forthcoming sanctions while Beijing asked all sides in Myanmar to “appropriately handle their differences.”Nikkei Asian Review\n\nTeam of Rivals\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden is building a cabinet with differing perspectives on China, and it remains an open question whether his administration will provide a unified front in dealing with Beijing. Climate Tsar John Kerry will likely prefer friendly relations with China in order to achieve goals on climate change while Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Indo-Pacific Coordinator Kurt Campbell may take a more hawkish line on challenging China’s human rights record and business practices. Wall Street Journal\n\nCoronavirus by country\n\nJapan\n\nRain, snow, or COVID-19, the Olympics will go on. “We’ll certainly go ahead however the coronavirus [pandemic] evolves,” Tokyo 2020 chief Yoshiro Mori said Tuesday. This week, Olympic organizers also unveiled their COVID-19 playbook, a 32-page document outlining the logistics of hosting the games starting in July amid a global pandemic. Japan hasn't decided whether fans will be able to attend events, but if they do, organizers say they will be banned from singing or chanting. Athletes will be asked to not leave the Olympic Village, and likely won't be able to hang around for much time before and after their competitions.
