        "text": "One president is leaving, but the next one could be slow to come to the Tokyo Games organizing committee. Yoshiro Mori presented his resignation as president of Tokyo 2020 this Friday, February 12, during an executive board meeting scheduled for the afternoon. She was accepted. But the announcement of his replacement will not be immediate.\n\nA name was already circulating to take over the office abandoned by Yoshiro Mori. Saburo Kawabuchi, a former professional football player, known in Japan for having participated in the Tokyo Games in 1964, then serving for a long time as president of the Japan Football Federation. More recently, he was appointed mayor of the future athletes' village for the Tokyo 2020 Games. A very symbolic position, certainly, but revealing of his influence in the Japanese Olympic movement.\n\nWithout fearing to skip ahead, Saburo Kawabuchi assured the media on Thursday, February 11, that he was ready to accept the position. “ My biggest mission will be to make the organization of the Games possible by all means., he suggested. It is an honor. I would like to accept and offer my help so that Mr. Mori's efforts will not be in vain. »\n\nThe matter seemed to be over. Obviously, it is not. Saburo Kawabuchi will not be the chosen one. According to Kyodo News, the name of Yoshiro Mori's successor will not be known this Friday. A panel will be set up by the organizing committee, with the mission of proposing one or more names. The nomination process will not be immediate. It might take a few days.\n\nStill according to Japanese media, the name of Saburo Kawabuchi would have raised some doubts within the organizing committee. Some would have coughed, others would have raised an eyebrow.\n\nIn question, two things. The first is the approach. Saburo Kawabuchi would be Yoshiro Mori's choice. He would have been suggested, even dubbed, by the former Prime Minister. Comment from a member of the board of directors, quoted by the Mainichi shimbun : \" It is not logical for a resigning boss to appoint his successor. This process should have steps. If this is allowed, there is no reason to even hold a meeting. »\n\nThe second reason has to do with Saburo Kawabuchi himself. At 84 years old, he admits to being one year older than Yoshiro Mori. He belongs to the same generation of sports leaders. And even, for part of the public, to the same generation of Japanese.\n\nCertainly, the former footballer has never been caught making sexist remarks. But his age, his background, and his presumed proximity to Yoshiro Mori, do not seem likely to convince public opinion of a real change at the head of the organizing committee. Very imprudent, Saburo Kawabuchi even suggested Thursday February 11 that Yoshiro Mori should retain an advisory role to the organizers of the Tokyo Games.\n\nSeiko Hashimoto, the Minister of the Olympic Games, remains unwavering: the priority is to restore public confidence in the Olympic and Paralympic event. Less than six months before the opening, all the polls agree on one obvious fact: the vast majority of Japanese today want a cancellation or further postponement of the Games.\n\n« The organizing committee will make a decision after listening to the opinions of a wide range of people.”, said Seiko Hashimoto on the eve of the board and executive committee meeting. According to several sources, the Olympic minister is among the candidates to succeed Yoshiro Mori. It would even point in a good position.\n\nIn Lausanne, the IOC made no secret of its wish to see the Japanese demonstrate transparency in the appointment of its successor. Less than six months before the opening, the Tokyo Games can no longer afford a new crisis."
