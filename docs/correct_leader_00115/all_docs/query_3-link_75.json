        "text": "Bloomberg reported that the 85-year-old politician spoke at a reception in Tokyo, which was also attended by Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida. The day before, by the way, he announced that he was going to pay a visit to Kiev.\n\nAccording to Kyodo News, Yoshiro Mori made a lot of noise, saying that Tokyo should not invest so much effort in Ukraine. \"It is simply unthinkable that Russia would lose,\" the former head of government said.\n\nMori, RIA Novosti writes, also criticized Japanese news agencies, stressing that their one-sided reports on the conflict in Ukraine give him the impression that they \"rely only on media reports from Europe and the United States\".\n\nYoshiro Mori will also be remembered as a Japanese for the fact that, while serving as head of the organizing committee of the Olympic Games in Tokyo, he spoke from \"sexist positions\", forbidding women to occupy administrative posts in his office. He believed that women in sports committees and federations \"talk too much\", so meetings with their participation last too long.\n\nMori also stated that women are constantly trying to compete with each other during meetings. As an example, Yoshiro Mori cited the Japanese Rugby Federation, which he headed for many years. It was because of the increase in the number of women in its composition that the federation meetings began to drag on, the official was indignant."
