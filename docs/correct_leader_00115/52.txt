TOKYO -- Former Japanese leader Yoshiro Mori has voiced support for the idea of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe seeking an unprecedented fourth term as head of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, which would keep the 65-year-old leader in office until 2024, citing Abe's close relationship with U.S. President Donald Trump.

The revelation comes in an interview published Friday by monthly magazine Bungeishunju.
