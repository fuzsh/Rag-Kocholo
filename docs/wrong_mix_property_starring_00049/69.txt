‘I understood what people meant by the voice in a book. I started to hear it, and I liked what I heard.”‘ – Steve Bisley.

In this podcast, Cheryl Akle is joined by Australian actor and writer Steve Bisley to talk about breaking into acting, his memoir, and his most recent book, ‘All The Burning Bridges’.

In this sensory and poetic memoir, actor Steve Bisley reflects on loving, losing, wrecking and running – the bridges burned – in the decades since hitchhiking away from the small family farm on the central coast of NSW in the 1960s. He explores with confronting honesty what it is to live on the edge of uncertainty, regret, despair and depression as an actor, lover and father, a life held together at times “by bits of frayed cotton and Perkin’s paste and hope”.

In 2014, Stillways was shortlisted for The N.S.W Premier’s Literary Awards, The National Biography Awards and The Queensland Literary Awards. All the Burning Bridges is a sequel, the next chapter in the young man’s life.

Duration: 29 mins.
