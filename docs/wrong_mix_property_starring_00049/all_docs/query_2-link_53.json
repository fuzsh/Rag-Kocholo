        "text": "By Rob Hartnett\n\nA lot of people ask me about leadership and what are the key principles of a leader versus a manager for example.I think one of the greatest books written on leadership is called The Leadership Challenge by James Kouzes and Barry Posner. It's in its sixth edition and highly recommended.\n\nIn the book Kouzes & Posner talk about the Five Practices and Principles of Leaders. Let me summarise five key practices and then I'm going to give you a really interesting scenario of this in action.\n\nThe first one is: A good leader models the way. My mentor John Maxwell says that a good leader knows the way, goes the way and shows the way. They know what behaviour they want, they're able to model it daily and they are able to explain it.\n\nThe second one is: They are inspirational and they create a shared vision for what they're looking to achieve with their team.\n\nThe third one is: They enable and empower others. They actually take the lead, in other words, to create more leaders. They are connectors as opposed to climbers.\n\nFourthly: They challenge existing processes. They don't just put up with the status quo or the norm. They see possibility not obstacles.\n\nAnd fifth: They reward the heart. They reward those who are following them, those who believe in their values and their direction and their vision.\n\nSo those five really came to life for me just recently because this year is the 40th anniversary of Mad Max. The original Mad Max 1, filmed all those years ago and put together by the late Byron Kennedy and George Miller. But George Miller and Byron Kennedy filmed that movie on a very short shoe-string budget. Very tight. But they were examples of the Leadership Challenge. All five of those things they did.\n\nThey modelled the way, they used their own hard assets, their own vans, caravans, and cars, for example, in the movie. They were prepared to destroy those things they were so committed.\n\nIn terms of inspiring and creating a vision, the vision was bought into by the lead actors, a young Mel Gibson, a young Steve Bisley, still at NIDA, and they explained the movie to them and they bought into it. Clint Eastwood once said that if you get the casting right, 75% of the movie is done. Steve Bisley said that being a motorcyclist and actor, as he soon as he read the script he thought \"I have to play the role of Goose\". Think about that in your organisation. Have you got the right people in the right roles and do they believe in your vision? Are they passionate along with you?\n\nThey also enabled and empowered others. They took advice, they took guidance. The crew themselves were motivated and excited to be working on this project even though a lot of them weren't paid much money, sometimes not at all! But great actors like Hugh Keays-Byrne who played the role of Toecutter, really took this to heart. Hugh Keays-Byrne a Royal Shakespeare Company trained actor had the whole gang of motorcycle riders literally ride from Sydney to Melbourne on their bikes to bond as part of this movie so it would feel very real when they came together. He not only did that, he came up with all sorts of ideas and new lines that George Miller and Byron Kennedy hadn't written, to enhance the Toecutter character. He wasn't paid anymore for doing that, he just wanted to bring his best to the role. Do your people do this for you?\n\nThey challenged the process; people had never filmed this movie like this beforehand. The lead cameraman, David Eggby, a keen motorcyclist, built his own crane for the cameras, put it on his own F100 truck and did some of the most amazing camera angles super low to the ground that had never been done before, and are used on movies to this day. Below is David Eggby with stunt rider Terry Gibson who had to borrow a Kawasaki 900 ZIB from a mate to use in the movie as he rode a Triumph and the directors wanted to use the Kawasaki's.\n\nThey rewarded the heart as well. Those people who worked with them and gave them all that effort. Think about the amount of Mad Max sequels that came after the first one. Mel Gibson starred in the next two and Hugh Keays-Byrne, the original Toecutter in Mad Max 1, 36 years later, was in Mad Max: Fury Road as Immortan Joe (below).\n\nGeorge Miller and Byron Kennedy put Mad Max 1 together by living the five principles. They modelled the way, they created a shared vision, they empowered others, the challenged the process of what you can do in terms of making a movie, and they rewarded the heart. It's a great way of seeing what can be accomplished with leadership."
