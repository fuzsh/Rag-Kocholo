        "text": "Director: George Miller\n\nCast: Anya Taylor-Joy, Chris Hemsworth, Tom Burke, Alyla Browne\n\nScreenplay: George Miller, Nick Lathouris\n\n148 mins. Rated R.\n\nSo Furiosa features a scene with a “Boomstick.” We may be living in a cinematic universe with Evil Dead.\n\nNearly ten years after Fury Road, we’re finally seeing the long-gestating Furiosa prequel film hitting theaters. The film, which follows a young Furiosa in the years between her childhood and introduction in George Miller’s Mad Max legacy sequel, is presented in chapter form (something I absolutely adore). We see young Furiosa (Alyla Browne, Sting) as she witnesses the death of a loved one and her incarceration at the hands of the psychotically absurd Dementus (Chris Hemsworth, Avengers: Endgame). Anya Taylor-Joy (The Menu) stars in the film as adult Furiosa.\n\nBe forewarned, if you are looking for 2-plus hours on non-stop car-on-car spectacle violence, that is not Furiosa. While feeling like a companion piece to Fury Road, this is a very differently-structured tale, presented in a way that feels anthological, where each chapter sees a time jump and a new part of Furiosa’s journey to the character we know. It’s a clever tool because it gets over that big hurdle of origin stories, where they all feel like they have to answer every lingering question about a character and ultimately show that a character was formed over a single event that shaped every part of them. Furiosa isn’t that. This is a life lived, one where she was slowly molded over time as she interacts with the two greatest villains of her life: Dementus and Immortan Joe. I get the feeling that this film and Fury Road will only become stronger as they watched back-to-back over the coming years.\n\nIt’s also a long film, making full use of the term Saga, which may veer some viewers away, and I felt like the first portion of the film isn’t as strong as when the adult Furiosa comes into play (this by no means is meant to denigrate Alyla Browne’s performance, as she’s quite great), and we get to see flourish through her interactions with Praetorian Jack (Tom Burke, Mank), a new character who sees Furiosa’s strengths and views her as an equal for the first time in her adult life. This portion of the film was my personal favorite.\n\nThere isn’t a bad performance in the bunch, but I have to signal out the absolutely career-best acting of Chris Hemsworth. His take on Dementus is so absurdly out of place that it fits right into Miller’s madcap apocalyptic world. At times funny, while occasionally horrifying and (it’s in the name) demented, this is a new bar for an actor that always brings it. Oh yeah, and for Christmas, I would like his motorcycle chariot.\n\nThe film also features just enough references to past films to make any Mad Max fan happy, including the first reference I could find to events in the original trilogy of films from the 70s/80s, and a boatload of setups and payoffs for Fury Road, further intrinsically linking the two stories.\n\nFuriosa is an excellent new entry of the Mad Max world, interestingly enough depicting a tale where the title character is occasionally in the backseat of her story, much like the aforementioned Road Warrior himself. It’s a lush and beautiful landscape with some newly iconic set pieces, characters, and locations that only add to the Saga of both Furiosa and Max. While it does have an unwieldy pacing that may not work for some, I was still quite impressed and entertained throughout, and I’m excited to revisit this one again.\n\n4/5\n\n-Kyle A. Goethe\n\nFor my review of George Miller’s Mad Max, click here.\n\nFor my review of George Miller’s Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior, click here.\n\nFor my review of George Miller’s Mad Max: Fury Road, click here.\n\nDirector: Russell Mulcahy\n\nCast: Milla Jovovich, Oded Fehr, Ali Larter, Iain Glen, Ashanti, Mike Epps, Christopher Egan, Spencer Locke, Jason O’Mara\n\nScreenplay: Paul W.S. Anderson\n\n94 mins. Rated R for strong horror violence throughout and some nudity.\n\nThere are a lot of elements in the third Resident Evil film that convinced 17-year-old me this one was going to absolutely rule. It was directed by Russell Mulcahy (Highlander, In Like Flynn), its trailer appeared to have similarities with my favorite Romero Living Dead film, Day of the Dead, and with the new character introductions, it seemed like it might be honing in on more of what the fans of the games wanted. Sure, what we got wasn’t really like what I had gleaned from the trailers, but let’s be clear: this movie is entertaining as hell through all of its many faults.\n\nIt’s been five years since the events at Raccoon City left most of the world devastated by the T-Virus. Alice (Milla Jovovich, The Fifth Element, Monster Hunter), on her own for some time, finds herself taken in by a convoy including some old friends: Carlos Olivera (Oded Fehr, The Mummy Returns, Lair) and L.J. (Mike Epps, Friday After Next, The House Next Door: Meet the Blacks 2). The convoy is in search of shelter, and Alice shows them a book she discovered, claiming to have safe haven in Alaska, but they lack the gasoline to get them there. The convoy heads to Las Vegas to get supplies and gas, all the while Umbrella Corporation and the sinister Dr. Isaacs (Iain Glen, Lara Croft: Tomb Raider, TV’s Reyka) plot to retrieve Project Alice and continue their research.\n\nFirst of all, I have to be the one that says it: screen your movie. Resident Evil: Extinction was not screened for critics, but here’s the thing, we all were pretty confident critics would hate the movie anyway, and most of the time, critical reviews can really only influence about 10% of the box office take. When Malignant came out recently, and we were all discussing the lack of reviews, no Thursday night opening, and the assumption was that the studio didn’t believe in their product. The same is true here. Screen your movie.\n\nAs far as Resident Evil: Extinction goes, the entertainment value is a definite win. Sure, the movie itself has flaws in and out, but I was thoroughly entertained. I think that Resident Evil: Apocalypse and Extinction are the absolute best that this franchise will have to give, so if you aren’t won over at this point, this just may not be the movie series for you. Where it wins most is in the action. This is probably the best action of the series, and that is due to Russell Mulcahy’s handling of the set pieces. It’s obvious that he’s the most capable of the directors in this franchise because he has the best looking action, and it’s the most tense that the series gets. His choice to film in sunlight more often as opposed the coldness of the first film and the darkness of the second really give a more stunning visual flair that’s in line with the film’s comparisons to Day of the Dead and Mad Max. In particular, the crow scene is a new element taken from the mythology of the games that feels quite fresh and is handled well.\n\nThe returning actors, Jovovich, Fehr, and Epps are all putting forth some solid work, even if it feels odd that Jill Valentine and Angela Ashford are just gone from the narrative (with Sienna Guillory primed to return in the next installment). Their absense gives the film an Alien 3 vibe (something the franchise would probably want to avoid). All the same, I like their general chemistry and performances, but Paul W.S. Anderson’s script just doesn’t give them much to do. The big Alice moments of the film are either “She’s too powerful” or “She does nothing.” She can firebend at some points, and also, Umbrella can completely control her movements, but they’ve elected not to for the past five years. Carlos is mostly reactionary in the film, and L.J. goes from street-smart in Apocalypse to completely foolish in this installment, ultimately becoming a fairly stereotypical stock zombie movie character that we all hate now.\n\nAs far as new additions, I feel like Ali Larter (Final Destination, The Last Victim) was miscast as Claire Redfield and Ashanti (Coach Carter, A Christmas Winter Song) is just kind of bland as medic Betty. Spencer Locke (Insidious: The Last Key, Walk. Ride. Rodeo.) is given a nickname as character development, and Jason O’Mara (Batman: Hush, TV’s The Man in the High Castle) is just given very little to do as the first appearance of franchise villain Albert Wesker is concerned.\n\nAs mentioned above, you get some pretty iconic characters from the game series here, like Claire Redfield and Albert Wesker, and there’s also a newly-named scientist seemingly modeled after William Birkin with Dr. Isaacs. I guess, at this point, I wonder why they’re even introducing iconic characters if they aren’t going to use them. I’m all for creative license in adapting, especially where the video game to film adaptation is concerned, but Claire Redfield has nothing in common with her video game persona at all, and Albert Wesker ends up being very underutilized in the franchise starting here. As far as Dr. Isaacs is concerned, Iain Glen chews up the scenery quite well and has fun with the role, and because he isn’t named after William Birkin, it feels like game fans were willing to give him a pass as a character. Why didn’t they do that with everyone? It’s become obvious that we’ve strayed heavily from the video game franchise at this point, so why continue to under-deliver on legacy characters? I guess it’s worth noting that Anderson (who scripted every installment of this franchise) did care about fan reaction, but he didn’t do a great job of taking that criticism.\n\nAlongside that, it needs to be stated that this film is the one you can look back on and realize that there was no plan for this movie series. Why is the Red Queen replaced in this film with the White Queen, and then why do we never see the White Queen again? Why does the finale of this film have a trilogy-ending set piece meant to take us “back to the beginning” of the series? I remember the idea going in was that this movie was likely to be the ending of the movies, and this film gives us that sense that we are going back to where it started to finish it, but then it ends on another cliffhanger (something that becomes more frustrating from this point on) and, looking back, this feels like an ending that was retconned into not ending, and even the final installment of the series, titled The Last Chapter, hits the same kind of story beats as this one, going back to the very beginning all over again.\n\nResident Evil: Extinction looks great, and the action is tense and exciting, but this is a hodgepodge of Resident Evil mythology, a Greatest Hits in some ways, hobbled together and retrofitted to kind of showcase a general knowledge of the video games. It’s full of ideas, but it’s also full of frustrating characters doing stupid things and being punished for it, and while the movie still has a solid amount of entertainment, it’s unlikely that this film will win over video game fans, and the franchise should be moving forward with its own thing and stop trying to be the games.\n\n3/5\n\n-Kyle A. Goethe\n\nFor my review of Paul W.S. Anderson’s Resident Evil, click here.\n\nFor my review of Alexander Witt’s Resident Evil: Apocalypse, click here.\n\nFor my review of Russell Mulcahy’s Highlander, click here.\n\nDirector: George Miller\n\nCast: Tom Hardy, Charlize Theron, Nicholas Hoult, Hugh Keays-Byrne, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, Riley Keough, Zoe Kravitz, Abbey Lee, Courtney Eaton\n\nScreenplay: George Miller, Brendan McCarthy, Nico Lathouris\n\n120 mins. Rated R for intense sequences of violence throughout, and for disturbing images.\n\niMDB Top 250: #68 (as of 7/10/2015)\n\nHow often does a film get a good sequel 36 years after its initial release? Not often. That’s the answer, and it was my worry when I heard that Mad Max would be continuing the franchise with a fourth installment, Mad Max: Fury Road featuring a new Max in Tom Hardy (Inception, Child 44). In this new chapter, Max Rockatansky is captured and used as a blood bag by Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne, Moby Dick, Sleeping Beauty) and his War Boys. When the War Boy Nux (Nicholas Hoult, Warm Bodies, X-Men: Days of Future Past) takes Max along on his hunt for Joe’s missing wives, stolen from him by his Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron, Prometheus, Dark Places), Max gets caught in a war on Fury Road and his alliances to only himself must be put into question.\n\nDirector George Miller (Happy Feet, Babe: Pig in the City) proves that age is only a number as he controls the most high-octane action spectacle that I can recall in recent memory. His unique blend of story with nonstop action gives audiences a personal tale of freedom, redemption, and the ability to survive in a world without laws.\n\nTom Hardy is a great new Max. He doesn’t need to speak often to convey the complex emotions and depression that Max struggles from after the loss of his wife and child. His leadership struggle with new ally Furiosa, played excellently by Theron. Just like the previous films, this film isn’t entirely about Max. It’s a Furiosa movie all the way. Many have complained that the focus should be on Max, but what they should realize is that this series is rarely ever focused on Max. Each adventure is usually told as a legend from another’s perspective and in Fury Road, that perspective is Furiosa’s.\n\nHugh Keays-Byrne and Joe’s brides, including Rosie Huntington-Whiteley (Transformers: Dark of the Moon) and Zoe Kravitz (Divergent, Dope), all do great work as well, with a standout crazy performance from Nicholas Hoult as Nux.\n\nThe usage of 80% practical effects over computer-generated images helps create an astoundingly realistic yet overwhelmingly fantastical view of the apocalyptic landscape. The screenplay, a combination of sequences storyboarded and story written to format it, works so well. And then there is Miller’s reliance on trying new things, like hiring wife Margaret Sixel to edit the film. Sixel has no experience editing, but he entrusted her to use her novice skills to create something new and interesting, coupled beautifully with the furious score from Junkie XL.\n\nMad Max: Fury Road is one of the best times you will have at the theater this summer and contains some of the best action sequences ever put to the screen. Miller’s creative decision to devise something new rather than fall back on remakes and rehashes helps to bring in fans of the original while attracting new attention from non-fans.\n\n5/5\n\n-Kyle A.
