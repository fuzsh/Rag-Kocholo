        "text": "‘I remember a time of chaos…ruined dreams…this wasted land. But most of all, I remember The Road Warrior.’\n\nThe survivors of a global collapse roam the desert highways searching for fuel, the only commodity that still has value. In the wasteland, the inhabitants of a peaceful settlement drill and refine their own supply, but they are targeted by a gang of vicious marauders…\n\nHigh octane thrills and spills with Mel Gibson returning as Mad Max for director George Miller. The film became a global phenomenon, and its influence birthed a legion of post-apocalyptic pretenders suiting up in the wastelands of international low-budget genre cinema.\n\nIt’s five years since former policeman Max Rockatansky (Gibson) lost his wife and child to the gangs on the road. In that time, the world has gone to war, civilisation has collapsed, and all that remains are a few survivors clinging to a precarious existence out in the wasteland. These include marauding gangs, now united under the banner of the masked muscleman The Humungus (Kjell Nilsson) and his deranged lieutenant Wes (Vernon Wells). Everyone needs fuel, and possession of it has become vital for survival.\n\nAfter escaping from a run-in with Nilsson and his men, Gibson encounters the eccentric Gyro Captain (Bruce Spence) and learns of a community refining petrol in the desert. Looking for an opportunity to score some precious gas, Gibson forces Spence to take him there, but they arrive just after Nillson and his marauders, who lay siege to the compound. Using a survivor from an aborted breakout attempt, Gibson gets inside and tries to make a deal with leader Pappagallo (Mike Preston). Instead, circumstances dictate that he becomes heavily involved in their struggle for survival.\n\nThere are not many occasions when a film hits so big and instantly that it becomes part of the cultural fabric almost overnight. This film, with its mixture of crazy stunts, outrageous costumes and a unique setting, is one example. Post-apocalyptic cinema was nothing new, but it had tended, for the most part, to be reflective, even cerebral to some extent. Dramas such as ‘The Omega Man’ (1971) and the underrated Yul Brynner vehicle ‘The Ultimate Warrior’ (1975) had featured doses of action, but nothing like the almost relentless procession of thrilling set pieces delivered by Miller and his stunt team. Audiences couldn’t get enough of it, and the film grossed nearly eight times its budget in its initial cinema release alone.\n\nThe story’s simplicity is its strength, although this was likely largely unintentional as the script was written almost on the fly during the shoot. This is usually a recipe for disaster, of course, but here it results in a lean, taut narrative that has little time for diversions into tired conventions, stock supporting characters or contrived romance. The plot provides only enough complexity to justify setting up the action, and it works wonderfully.\n\nThat’s not to say the supporting cast doesn’t make an impact. Emil Minty’s Feral Kid, with his deadly boomerang, and Spence’s lovable Gyro Captain, provide flavour and a delicious hint of black humour. On the other side of the fence, Wells’ psychotic barbarian became the 1980s post-apocalyptic poster boy with his leathers, American Football shoulder pads, feathers and scarlet-topped mohican. It also doesn’t hurt that the actor gives a performance of such brutal intensity that it makes you worry about his mental health.\n\nBut it’s Gibson who anchors the drama, and it was this film that launched him on the way to international stardom. His progress as an actor since the original ‘Mad Max’ (1979) is quite astonishing. It wasn’t even three years between films, and he’s almost unrecognisable, youthful, uncertainly eradicated by a mature, formidable charisma that dominates the frame whenever he appears. It’s a strong, authoritative performance, but it’s also true that Miller knew how to utilise his star to the best advantage, keeping his dialogue minimal to emphasise the character’s mythic quality, much in the way Sergio Leone and Clint Eastwood had done when they collaborated on ‘A Fistful of Dollars’ (1964).\n\nOf course, it’s hard not to focus on the incredible 13-minute chase sequence that concludes the film. Gibson wrestles with the speeding petrol tanker as Wells, Nillson, and the barbarians give chase of various stripped-down vehicles across the epic landscape of the Australian desert. Films have always featured big, eye-popping stunts, but previously they tended to stand alone, usually at the end of an action sequence. Here, Miller just keeps hitting the audience with one after another, and in the pre-digital age, everything on the screen was done for real, which gives it weight and an impact that pixels have never been able to replicate. The superb score by composer Brian May is the perfect accompaniment to the sequence and delivers the goods throughout the film.\n\nAlthough the plot is very basic and without complexity, Miller and writers Terry Hayes and Brian Hannant provide enough shorthand character beats to make the audience care. Preston’s community is just that; a community. It’s not overdone by any means, but we see enough to know that basic humanity has survived the apocalypse, even if sentimentality has not. Many of the films that followed lacked this dimension and expended too much energy on simply trying to make everyone cool and tough. Here, when Max elects to drive the tanker on what amounts to little more than a suicide mission, his motivations are wonderfully ambiguous. It’s hinted that he’s finding his humanity again, but it’s just as possible that he sees his probable death as an inevitability and is too tired to fight his destiny any longer.\n\nThe Australian outback is also impressive, its widescreen emptiness perfectly captured by cinematographer Dean Semler. The landscape stretches forever to the horizon, infusing the action with a brutal poetry and an epic scale. Although it’s never specified just how much civilisation remains elsewhere, it truly feels like we’re witnesses at the end of the world and that humanity’s future hangs on the conflict playing out before our eyes. This notion is reinforced by the clash of national accents among the actors, which helps suggest the global nature of the catastrophe that has overtaken the planet, although this may have been a happy accident with the casting.\n\nThe hero’s journey and the mythologising of the lone warrior against impossible odds in a strange, almost alien world has been a staple of storytelling for as long as stories have been told. Cinema adapted this over many genres from its earliest days; the cowboy in the Old West, the policeman in the urban jungle, the Ronin of feudal Japan, and many other archetypes. However, by placing his hero in a possible future rather than the present or historical past, Miller created something with infinite and fascinating possibilities. It felt very fresh and new, even if some might argue that George Lucas had already beaten him to the punch. However, Luke Skywalker’s future was clearly fantastical and in the mode of earlier heroes such as Flash Gordon, whereas Max’s destiny seems, relatively at least, a far more plausible outcome.\n\nAfter such a huge success, it might be assumed that Miller delivered a string of big film projects in its wake. Instead, he has completed only eight films in the four decades since. The length between this project and the series’ third instalment, ‘Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome’ (1985), was likely caused by the sudden death of producer Byron Kennedy, with whom Miller had created the first two films. In the 30 years leading up to ‘Mad Max Fury Road’ (2015), Miller’s best-known work is probably the star-studded comedy ‘The Witches of Eastwick’ (1987), which, although a significant hit at the time, seems to have been mostly forgotten. He was also primarily responsible for the popular dancing penguins of the ‘Happy Feet’ franchise. As of the time of writing, he is working on two more films in the Mad Max universe, the first of which is due to hit theatres in 2024.\n\nEssential post-apocalyptic cinema and a cracking ride to boot.\n\n‘See you on the road, scag!’\n\nSociety is collapsing, and biker gangs run rampant on the remote highways. One police officer finds his family targeted and sets out on a personal mission of revenge…\n\nLow-budget cult film that eventually became a global phenomenon, spawning a franchise, dozen of imitators and making a star of a young Australian actor named Mel Gibson. George Miller directs as ‘Mad Max’ takes his big-screen bow.\n\nIn the near future, civilisation has begun to implode, and what remains of law enforcement battles the gangs out on the empty highways. Career criminal the Nightrider (Vince Gil) and his girlfriend Lulu Pinkus crash and burn after a high-speed pursuit by young cop Max Rockatansky (Gibson).\n\nGil was part of the dangerous gang led by the Toecutter (Hugh Keays-Byrne), and Gibson soon gets the word from his boss, Fifi (Roger Ward), that they are plotting revenge. Along with his partner, Jim Goose (Steve Bisley), he arrests biker Johnny the Boy (Tim Burns), but they are forced to release him on a technicality. The gang takes revenge by torching Bisley in an overturned truck, and Gibson tries to quit while he’s still ahead. Instead, Ward suggests he take a short trip with his wife Jessie (Joanne Samuel) and young son and think it over. Unfortunately, nowhere is safe with Keays-Byrne and his gang on the rampage.\n\nStories of the making of the first instalment of the ‘Mad Max’ saga have passed into low-budget movie legend. Extras paid in beer, the bikers being a real-life gang called the Vigilantes, Miller and his crew closing off remote roads and filming without permits. The entire budget was $350,000, and Miller and producer Byron Kennedy cut the results at home after the editor had to leave to go to his next job. They could never have imagined that they were assembling what would turn out to be the most financially successful independent film of all time until the arrival of ‘The Blair Witch Project’ (1999).\n\nGiven the circumstances of its production, it’s inevitable that the film was a sleeper, gaining a reputation through word of mouth from audiences hyped on its heady mixture of car porn, stunts and violence. Considering the limited resources at Miller’s disposal, it’s a tribute to his instincts as a filmmaker that he’s able to deliver such a visceral, kinetic experience that still holds up well today if you make a few allowances.\n\nThe film opens with a wonderfully bold, intense sequence. Various officers attempt to bring in the Nightrider as he burns rubber down the highways of the outback. Shotguns fire, a car smashes into a truck, and a baby is snatched from the road in the nick of time. Occasionally in the middle of the mayhem, we cut to another cop waiting at the side of the road somewhere up ahead. First, we see his boots, later his back, then the lower half of his face in a wing mirror, and eventually his sunglasses. All the while, his colleagues are dropping out of the race one by one as more twisted wreckage lines the road. It’s a superb way to introduce Max. From the start, we know he’s special. The action and violence are coming to him as if drawn by a magnet. It’s a tour de force of conception, editing and execution.\n\nSadly, nothing quite matches that opening. There’s still plenty to enjoy, though, and Miller demonstrates a staggering maturity in his direction, considering it was his first dramatic assignment. Crucially, he shot with an anamorphic lens discarded in Australia by Sam Peckinpah after filming ‘The Getaway’ (1972). He used it for the entire shoot, and the widescreen landscapes it creates provide a perfect backdrop to the action; low desert hills bisected by a never-ending road with no apparent final destination. Placing the camera low down to the tarmac for many shots gives a furious, headlong sense of speed, which infuses the action with a kinetic energy and immediacy that’s hard to match.\n\nThe film’s main flaw is the predictable and formulaic plot, of course, familiar from hundreds of Western programmers. The small town where the bikers go to pick up the Nighrider’s coffin even looks like it belongs in the Old West, and station master Reg Evans could be running the telegraph office in Tombstone. As a result, the off-road moments need some work to keep the audience hooked, and Miller tries everything he can to make them count. So, supporting characters carry cheap but intriguing props; Gibson juggles apples while waiting for Bisley to arrive in the police station’s car park, and officer Charlie (John Ley) speaks with an electronic voice box pressed to his neck after having his throat injured in a crash at the start of the film. Fairly small bits of business, yes, but they demonstrate an attention to detail and a determination to give the audience something extra in every scene.\n\nThere are some rough spots with the acting, though, and Gibson is the main culprit. He was still in drama school at the time, and although he’s adequate, he does appear stiff on occasion, particularly in the intimate scenes with Samuel. Fortunately, her natural performance mitigates the problem, although the sequence when he talks about his father still appears somewhat awkward. He also fails to sell the character’s central emotional conflict, the worry that he’s becoming desensitised to the violence of the road. Fortunately, it’s not a film about character beats, but there’s little sign of the Hollywood A-Lister to come or the staggering improvement he would make by the time of the sequel ‘Mad Max 2/The Road Warrior’ (1981).\n\nThe action also gets a kick from a stirring score by composer Brian May, even if he occasionally tries too hard. The triumphant fanfare when an injured Gibson gets to his feet and the lush strings accompanying his talk about his father provide more emphasis than was necessary. Still, the epic clash of brass and percussion helps to infuse what is essentially a small movie with a real sense of scale and importance, and the film would not be nearly as effective without it. The film was released in the U.S. with the entire cast dubbed by American actors. For many years, it was believed that this was done because the distributors were worried that the audience would not understand the Australian accents. This may have been a reason, but recent home media releases have revealed that the original sound mix was very poor, with dialogue sometimes drowned out by background noise. Obviously, dubbing an unknown like Gibson was not an issue at the time, but the American version does play a little strangely now as his voice is so well known.\n\nOf course, this film, and the sequel in particular, are credited with inspiring a sub-genre of post-apocalyptic action cinema in the following decade. Yet, this film is not really post-apocalyptic. Cleverly, there’s no discussion between characters about the global situation at any time. All we get is conveyed entirely through background radio chatter, and it’s not too specific. This is a world breaking down, but not one that has reached the end times yet. Ironically, Miller only included this background to explain the lack of cast members and the emptiness of the roads.\n\nIt’s hardly necessary to detail the subsequent careers of Gibson, Miller, or even Max himself, as all are very familiar to anyone interested in film. What is more interesting is to note how the sequel hit U.S. theatres a year after John Carpenter’s ‘Escape from New York’ (1981) and coincided with the explosion of the home video rental market. This winning combination inspired an entire rogues gallery of Road Warriors and Snake Plissken wannabes from all around the world, sometimes combining story and character elements. These ranged all the way from the sublime to the ridiculous. Although, to be honest, mostly the latter.\n\nAfter all these years, it may not quite be the thrill ride you recall, but it’s still high-octane entertainment."
