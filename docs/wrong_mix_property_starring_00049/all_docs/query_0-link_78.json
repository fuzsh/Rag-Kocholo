        "text": "Hey Bronze, gonna get You!\n\nI've been a diehard fan of the original 1979 Mad Max since I first saw it on VHS in 1982, and this documentary uncovers a wealth of background about the production. Terrific private collection photos, \"home movie\" style video made on set, and very insightful interviews from many people who played a part in the creation of one of my very favorite and impactful movies of my youth!\n\nYou can shut the gate on this one; it's the duck's guts!\n\nE. Iverson - 5 stars\n\nGreat doco, watch it!\n\nWhat an amazing doco on the original Mad Max movie. So much detail and some great insight into how it was made, the ideas behind it, how they made it and so much more. Well worth watching for any Mad Max fan or no doubt lots of great insight for new aspiring film makers to see how 30 years ago on a low budget a blockbuster and cult classic could be made.\n\nCameron Manewell - 5 stars\n\nINSANELY GREAT DOCUMENTARY!\n\nOMG!!!!!! Where has this documentary been? Positively INSANE compilation of every behind the scenes anecdote having to do with George Miller's classic 1979 film. Everyone is here. No question is unanswered. No story is untold. Whether you are a fan of the Mad Max series, a fan of independent cinema or just like movies...you need to see this documentary.\n\nKurt Root - 5 stars\n\nIf you are a fan of Mad Max then you may find this fascinating. It provides glimpses into how they made parts of the film and includes many of the actors being interviewed throughout. Well worth watching.\n\nAndrew - 5 stars\n\nIn-depth reminiscing about the first MM film\n\nA mainly talking-head documentary that goes into great and fascinating detail about the making of the first Mad Max film. This is probably more something for the hard-core MM fan, but if you're into all the MM films, this will be up your alley. It's a bit long, but worthwhile. I would've liked it to include some info about MM2/The Road Warrior, but it focuses solely on the first film, and it's pretty amazing how it was made with such a relatively low budget and in guerrilla fashion.\n\nMatthew Snope - 4 stars\n\nFantastic documentary about the definitive making of the original classic that started it all.\n\nThe Shadow - 5 stars\n\nI urge anyone who is a fan of the original classic to watch this documentary... most informative... excellent!\n\nAmazon Customer - 5 stars\n\nFascinating and compelling. Highly recommended for any Mad Max/Road Warrior fan.\n\nRachel A. Bones - 5 stars\n\nCrazy cool documentary, love every minute.\n\nSteve Funnell - 5 stars\n\nA must see for Mad Max enthusiasts!\n\nVery comprehensive, really fun to hear all the inside stories about how the cast and crew interacted with each other.\n\nErika M. Tandy - 5 stars\n\nVery interesting and thorough documentary. I enjoyed it very much.\n\nM. Leary - 5 stars\n\nLots of new info never seen.\n\nTerry Parker - 5 stars\n\nLoved the behind the scenes details. Thanks!\n\nScott Hunter - 5 stars\n\nInteresting to see what an amazing mess the whole process was on such a low budget.\n\nMichael G. - 5 stars\n\nExcellent and informative, really enjoyed this.\n\nRobbie C. - 5 stars\n\nFun movie - great action.\n\nDavid - 5 stars\n\nLong, in-depth look at the making of Mad Max. A little ridiculous in an eye-rolling way at times, but forgivable in place of some pretty great stories about the roller-coaster ride of making something low-budget and balls-out crazy. Biggest take away is the responses from the cast of the original in their similarities to the cast of Fury Road, addressing the confusion and subsequent insanity of filming being alleviated by the first screening, in which they finally \"got it.\"\n\nBenjamin Nason - 3 stars"
