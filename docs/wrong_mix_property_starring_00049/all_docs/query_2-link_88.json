        "text": "The Law Is A Ass #395\n\nThere’s an old joke I’m not going to repeat. It’s long; not very good; and, worst of all for a joke, not particularly funny. I bring it up because it’s punchline, “You can’t get there from here,” has a great bearing on the comic we’ll be discussing today.\n\nWhat comic? My pun-ishing headline indicates, it’s a comic featuring Daredevil, Matt Murdock, and a change of venue in a trial. And that means it’s Daredevil/Punisher: Seventh Circle.\n\nWe learned in the first issue of this mini-series that there’s this gangster named Sergey Antonov, see, and he’s a bad man, see. How bad? Well, he didn’t shoot a man in Reno just to watch him die, but he poisoned a rival gang’s boss’s Christmas turkey just to get him out of the way. Unfortunately, the rival boss’s whole family was eating that turkey. Four generations – most of them innocents – died because of Antonov’s actions. That’s how bad.\n\nWell, Antonov has been captured and is going to stand trial for his crimes. However, because “too many people hate [him]” in New York City, the District Attorney’s office feared it couldn’t get an impartial jury in New York City. So Assistant District Attorney Matt Murdock, moved for a change of venue. To Texas.\n\nWhich leads us to several points of discussion. First: what’s venue? To answer that I have to take us back to the time when we weren’t the United States but thirteen colonies under the British Empire. (Okay, I don’t have to, but I’m going to. How else can I show off all this historical knowledge I picked up in law school?) Back then, King George III had people who committed crimes in the colonies transported back to England for trial. The colonies didn’t like this. They even included it as one of their grievances with the Crown in the Declaration of Independence.\n\nIn order to prevent that from happening in the United States of America, the Founding Fathers put a clause in Article III of the United States Constitution requiring all criminal trials must be held within the state in which the crime was committed. But the Founding Fathers didn’t stop there. They also included a Vicinage Clause in the Sixth Amendment’s trial by jury provision dictating that the jury be composed of people who live within the state and district where the crime occurred. That district where the trial can be held, that’s the venue.\n\nKilling four generations of one family with a Swift Botulismball Turkey would be a felony. Actually, it would be a lot of felonies; four generations worth of felonies. Felonies are tried in county courts in most states – Louisiana and Alaska have parishes and boroughs instead of counties – so for a felony trial in New York, the proper venue would be the county where the crime occurred. As Matt Murdock, who works for the District Attorney in Manhattan, is prosecuting the case, we’ll assume Antonov’s crimes occurred in the county that contains Manhattan; New York County.\n\nMatt successfully moved to change the venue of Antonov’s upcoming trial, bringing up our second point of discussion: what’s a change of venue? Pretty much exactly what it sounds like. Sometimes a case is so highly publicized that it’s difficult to find people who haven’t heard about the case or formed an opinion about it before the trial started and the proper venue can’t assemble an unbiased jury. When that happens, the defense may seek a change of venue, so that the case can be tried in a different venue; one where the jury hasn’t heard about the case and isn’t biased.\n\nIn most states only the defendant can move for a change of venue. It is, after all, the defendant’s constitutional right to have the case tried in the venue where the crime occurred. And usually only the defendant may waive that right and seek to have the trial in a different venue. But NY Criminal Procedure Law § 231.20 specifically says that either the defendant or “the people,” i.e. the DA’s office, may move for a change of venue. So, having Matt Murdock ask for the change of venue wasn’t incorrect.\n\nHaving Matt Murdock request a change of venue to Texas, on the other hand…\n\nAnd, yes, that is our third point of discussion.\n\nRemember what I said earlier about Article III, dictating that a trial must be held within the state wherein the crime occurred. That means the only state that has jurisdiction to try a criminal case is the state where the crime occurred. Texas would have no subject matter jurisdiction over a crime committed in New York and a DA’s office could not ask that a New York criminal trial be transferred to Texas. The Constitution would permit changing the venue to some other county in New York. It would not permit changing the venue to some other state, like Texas.\n\nThere’s also no reason to move the trial to Texas. I’m a reasonably educated and well-read person but I’m up in Cleveland and I really couldn’t tell you much about the criminal goings on down in Cincinnati; except for this one noted case of vandalism involving a radio station and Thanksgiving turkeys. I don’t care how infamous Antonov’s crimes were in Manhattan, I can’t believe knowledge of his crimes was so wide-spread or pervasive that you couldn’t find twelve jurors in, say, Chautauqua County New York who hadn’t heard about or formed an opinion about the case.\n\nFor the record, I choose Chautauqua County because – check a map – it’s about as far away from Manhattan geographically as you can get and still be in New York state, not because I think it’s provincial. I doubt they’re all that familiar with Manhattan’s crimes in, say, Jamestown or Celoron. Besides they’ve been a little preoccupied there with that “Scary Lucy” statue.\n\nSo why did the judge grant Matt’s unconstitutional request to move Antonov’s trail to Texas? I have no idea. We didn’t see the change of venue hearing or meet the judge, so I have no way of knowing why the judge did what the judge did. There could be a few reasons. Hell, considering Matt’s history of unethical behavior, we can’t even eliminate bribery.\n\nWhy did Matt Murdock choose the unconstitutional venue of Texas instead of the constitutional venue of Chautauqua County? That’s another story.\n\nLiterally. We found out why Matt chose Texas in Daredevil/Punisher: Seventh Circle # 4. And that’s another story. (Okay, it’s a later chapter in the same story but for the purposes of the joke that’s as good as another story.) And because it’s another story, it will also be another column.\n\nOr, in the immortal tradition of comic books everywhere, to be law-tinued.\n\nThe 1980s was perhaps the first decade where sequels were crowding the theater screens and most were justifiably vilified by critics and fans alike for being little more than a retread of the original. That changed when director James Cameron, fresh off a little indie production The Terminator, was tasked with a sequel to 1979’s surprise hit, Alien.\n\nThe Hollywood executive merry-go-round delayed the sequel by several years, although that allowed Cameron to hone his ideas with producer/wife Gale Anne Hurd. He envisioned a story where the humans were akin to the Americans during Viet Nam, strangers seriously outnumbered in a strange land. After insisting the film star Sigourney Weaver, who was in a contract dispute with 20th Century-Fox, all the pieces came together.\n\nWhen the movie opened in 1986, it set a new higher standard for what a sequel should be, which was expanding upon the characters and universe seen in the first film. At the same time, it also was one of the first films of the modern era to hang so much of the film on a female protagonist. As a result, it was the right film at the right time, in the hands of a rising director who it box office gold.\n\n20th Century Home Entertainment is celebrating this achievement with a handsome Aliens: 30th Anniversary Edition. The box set comes with a digital HD code and a booklet featuring art culled from Dark Hose Comics’ assortment of Aliens-related comic covers plus a handful of art cards.\n\nWeaver’s Ripley, sole survivor of the Nostromo, awakens 57 years later and winds up leading an expedition back to LV-426 and the malevolent lifeform awaiting them. The film continues to be a thrilling adventure thanks to Weaver, Michael Biehn, Paul Reiser, Lance Henriksen, and Bill Paxton. Not only is it an action-adventure thriller, but it deepens Ripley by her protecting Newt (Carrie Henn), the young survivor of the human colony. All of which results in the now-famous but then-explosive climax as Ripley, in armor, confronts the Alien Queen.\n\nThe Blu-ray transfer is excellent (same one from the Aliens Anthology) and the sound superb, making for a good home viewing experience. You can choose the theatrical or 17-minute longer extended edition, which is nice to have. All the old special features are reprised here along with. The Inspiration and Design of Aliens featurette. However, you can only access the new feature through HD streaming and only 10 times between now until 2019 when it presumably vanishes.\n\nDespite that flaw, this is one of the strongest anniversary editions of a film to come out in a long time and is recommended.\n\nWe geeks are a passionate group. Not just for the stories we love, but in most aspects of our entire existence. We look for ways to share our passion, like joining fan groups. And very often, we use our passion for causes that need our help. Everyday geeks champion causes around the world, whether it’s a fundraising event or just raising awareness for a comic creator in need.\n\nHonestly, when I think about geek causes, I immediately think Captain Planet. Yes, I know that doesn’t make the most sense, but it is the truth. As a kid, I loved watching Captain Planet help out a group of diverse teenagers protect Mother Earth. And travel the globe without parental supervision. As a kid, I loved the idea of no parental supervision. Each episode gave a call to action based on that lesson of the week. Don’t litter, teach your parents to recycle, plant a tree. Simple but effective as a kid. But with those weekly lessons of helping others, along with my wonderful Girl Scouts experience, I learned a lot about giving back.\n\nAs an adult I quickly embraced the need for these events, throughout all the parts of my life. The best ones are always the geeky events, where my love for a TV show, comics, or any franchise can be shared while helping others. Nowadays we see geeky causes popping up frequently. Blood drives at SDCC, celebrities auctioning off set visits and trips to premieres, Browncoats Global Can’t Stop The Serenity fundraisers, 501st Legion raising for a variety of causes; these are just a few examples but there are so many more of varying size. Every group can find a charity group to support, a member to help. Or you can turn to the thoroughly geeky (but official) groups like Comic Book Legal Defense Fund and the Hero Initiative.\n\nA lot of my pieces include a call to action within them. Frankly, you would be hard pressed to find a week where a ComicMix columnist doesn’t have a call to action. Even yesterday, columnist Joe Corallo shared a call to action about supporting comics writer Rachel Pollack. But you don’t need to wait for a call to action to make a difference.\n\nSince you are reading this, you are obviously a passionate geek. (Or a family member of mine.) And while I said you don’t need a call to action, I’m going to give you one anyway to get you started. So your call to action is to go out and find your cause. If you don’t like those that I mentioned above, ask your friends, your local comic shop, the Internet. Check with your favorite fan pages. Don’t just look for opportunities to give money, look for chances to make a difference. Use all that bubbling passion for geekdom towards something more.\n\n(The ComicMix staff would like to congratulate Molly on her awesome conquest of the EtherTrolls!)\n\nIt is harvest time. The Green Market is a riot of colors, and I can’t seem to eat fast enough to take advantage of the riches of the season. I spend far too much time worrying about what to cook so that I don’t have to throw away any of my beautiful produce.\n\nThis might seem like a stupid thing to obsess about — why don’t I just buy less? — but it’s far better than my other current obsession, which is to wonder if I should have kissed that guy I like, and, if so, would there have been tongues, and had I brushed my teeth recently enough for that to happen. Often, it’s no fun inside my head.\n\nNo matter. Too much good food is not a bad problem to have. It’s certainly better than the obsession with death that seems to be once again encroaching on American superhero comics, a genre I like because it’s often full of hopeful fantasy. Here and here and here, just to take three examples from various rumor mills around the ‘Net. (Beware! Those links contain spoilers.)\n\nI know that heroism involves risks, and that death is a part of life. I’m just bored with killing off characters as a stunt to get attention. It makes story- and character-driven deaths less meaningful.\n\nSo let’s talk about vegetables. Superhero vegetables.\n\nSurprisingly (to me, at least), there are very few. One is a Green Lantern, and one is a Guardian of the Galaxy, who is also currently a movie star.\n\nAlas, Captain Carrot is not, in fact, a vegetable. And Swamp Thing can be food, but he can also be poison, since he can be any plant he chooses to be.\n\nWith the growing concern about children’s health, it’s not a surprise that parents want to find ways to get their kids to make healthier food choices. And it’s not a surprise that these parents, thinking that superheroes are kid stuff, would try to co-opt the vocabulary and imagery of comics to tempt their children.\n\nSome have even found a way to make a business out of it. A successful business that seems to be accomplishing its goals, at least so far. And they have Aasif Mandvi among their celebrity spokes-plants!\n\nI don’t know what you might like to eat, or what variety of nutrients makes you feel your best. Because we are human and capable of infinite variety, you probably have a different list than I do. I find that whatever I want to eat, I want to add more vegetables to it (except for, maybe, ice cream). In the process, I suppose I am causing the death of these vegetables, or at least creating the demand that is the incentive for farmers to kill them.\n\nIt’s possible vegetables have feelings. Whether that is true or not, they have more life than a fictional character.\n\nEven one with super-powers.\n\nBurbank, CA, September 14, 2016 –Mad Max fans will have something to put atop their holiday gift lists with the Mad Max High Octane Collection, debuting December 6 from Warner Bros.

Living on the edge of an apocalypse, Max is ready to run far away from it all with his family.

I guess I should care…\n\nBut a lot of us don’t. I’m reminded of a folk song I haven’t heard since the muddled days at the university, titled “The Vicar of Bray.” Here’s a taste:\n\nAnd this be the law, I shall maintain\n\nUntil my dying day, sir\n\nThat whatever king may reign,\n\nStill I’ll be the vicar of Bray, sir.\n\nIn other, less metered words, the day-to-day of the ordinary citizen, doesn’t usually change much after any given governmental upheaval. No matter who occupies the carpeted corner office or plunks his ass onto the throne, the guy who delivers the mail will continue to deliver the mail. And the shivering folk on that side of town will continue to be hungry.\n\nSo, yup, there are a couple of presidential campaigns afoot, and some other office-seekers asking for the favor of your vote, too, and you may or may not give a hoot. If you’re a character in a comic book, you probably don’t. Politics don’t get into comics much. I think a lot of the reason is that stuff we discussed last week, the tendency of fiction writers to be stingy with the minutiae of their hero’s existence less they offend readers who absolutely despise and abhor the collecting of doilies, the hobby you gave the aforementioned hero. Or like that.\n\n(The one time that I made politics part of a storyline by having a character elected mayor, I did what was customary and did not supply a party affiliation. I don’t think it occurred to me to do anything else.)\n\nClimb up out of the comics page to the editorial office where it was incubated in what we jokingly refer to as The Real World and in matters political, it’s much the same.\n\nI worked in comics for more than 50 years and I remember very little mention of politics in the publishers’ headquarters. Oh, there were creative folk who, I knew, shared my opinions and in the natural course of a meeting or a lunch we’d occasionally get around to talking about such matters, but they were never part of our work. I honestly don’t know how folks voted, and this does not impoverish my life.\n\nI’m aware that, a while back, there was a rumble in the comics world when some freelancers said that their conservative political views cost them assignments. I’ve known and worked with one of these guys for decades and there are few creators that I respect more. So if he said that something ugly happened in his professional life, as far as I’m concerned, something ugly happened.\n\nBut that was not my experience. Liberal bias? It seemed to me that there was a slight conservative bias in all aspects of comics, partly because comics grew up in a world at war, when patriotism was a valid response to what was happening abroad.\n\nAlmost everyone was a patriot in World War Two, and you’ll get no complaint about that from me.\n\nLet’s not mention other wars.\n\nWhen I tell the truth, it is not for the sake of convincing those who do not know it, but for the sake of defending those that do • William Blake\n\nLast Thursday, the Guardian – last real newspaper on Earth – carried a story by Sian Cain revealing Alan Moore was retiring from comic books. I guess Alan was promoting his William Blake-inspired novel, Jerusalem in a unique manner.\n\nBeing a professional cynic, my initial thought was “hadn’t he done that already?” No, Alan has quite publicly left the services of various and sundry publishers – DC Comics, Marvel, IPC – because he is a man of principle, and I mean that with the highest respect. And a reading of the piece reveals he hasn’t double-locked the door behind him, telling Cain “I may do the odd little comics piece at some point in the future, (but) I am pretty much done with comics.”\n\nThat saddens me, as I’m part of the rather formidable horde of readers that feels Moore is about as good as it gets. His current work in Cinema Purgatorio, one of the most interesting anthology comics I’ve seen since the debut of 2000 A.D., meets that standard. But I totally understand his point about what superhero comics mean to him and why it’s time to move on, and it is simply the rock-solid truth:\n\n“The superhero movies – characters that were invented by Jack Kirby in the 1960s or earlier – I have great love for those characters as they were to me when I was a 13-year-old boy. They were brilliantly designed and created characters. But they were for 50 years ago. I think this century needs, deserves, its own culture. It deserves artists that are actually going to attempt to say things that are relevant to the times we are actually living in. That’s a longwinded way of me saying I am really, really sick of Batman.”\n\nDamn, Alan. That’s right on the money. Including that last bit.\n\nI’d said Alan Moore is a man of principle. In some ways, his behavior reminds me of Steve Ditko, another important comics creator who stands up for his beliefs. And like Steve, this behavior has bewildered some of his fans, promoted criticism well before the Internet made that totally defatigable, and even caused people to doubt his sanity because he wouldn’t simply take the money and run. I don’t have to agree with all or even most of Moore’s views to respect his stand, and I say the same about Ditko. Hell, I’ll say the same thing about me – I change my mind from time to time. I like to think of that as keeping an open mind, but it’s also the result of a short attention span.\n\nNonetheless, in this time of massive political turbulence in both the United Kingdom and the United States, Alan Moore’s most important contribution to our shared culture is that he has always been the real thing. If he were running for office… well, I might move if he won, but I think he would as well. However, unlike those who actually do run for office, I’m absolutely certain I know where he stands.\n\nAlan is a man of principle.\n\nI welcome to see his future works that he will be doing because they are outside of his comfort zone. But as far as his comics work is concerned, well, Alan Moore, so long, and thanks for all the fish.\n\nAmerica still has a problem with accepting comics as anything other than kid stuff. There may be millions of “regular” people hiding their comic book lifestyle. This cannot stand and has to stop.\n\nAs you’re reading ComicMix, most likely this will not apply to you. Pass this on to a friend who you suspect may need it. If you’re trying to stay in the closet, yes this will help you avoid getting caught but consider the damage you may be doing to yourself.\n\nFor god’s sake – stop living a lie!\n\nDon’t see any comic books around his or her place? Somehow they manage to have seen or “has a friend” who has viewed that “stupid” superhero movie? If you’re dating anyone who spends considerable time and or money on things you just can’t understand, chances are you’re in love with a comic book person.\n\nHere’s a few simple tests and topics to find out if someone is hiding a comic book past.\n\nAsk them to name a Captain. Any Captain. If they describe Captain Action, Captain America, Captain Kirk or Captain Nemo, chances are they’re comic book people.\n\nIf Captain Morgan is the first name out of the box and they slur, droll and or lick their lips while doing Captain Morgan pose you’re dating a comic fan… and an alcoholic.\n\nMost fans of comic books are fans of movies, bookstores, and bacon. They either like Star Wars or Star Trek a few of us like both but if pressed will pick a side.\n\nA comic book fan will respect both the Beatles and Jay-Z, both Public Enemy and Paul Simon. Yes, different music but all icons. Symbols are important to comic book people. Even if we don’t love what they do, we have an appreciation for what they represent.\n\nAsk if they know anything about Dark Horse Comics, Kevin Eastman or an Apple product besides an iPhone. See if Norman Rockwell or the Wu-Tang Clan sparks a gleam in their eye. If you know anything about those subjects, try and act they like you don’t. We do so love to hear how smart we are or at least how cool we sound.\n\nIf the above questions or secondary inquiries don’t work for you, then hit them with one of the following:\n\nTell them (name of someone with basement or attic) was about to throw out a box of old comics from the 30s they found. You had no idea Batman had real pointy ears and carried a gun back then.\n\nAsk if anyone they know wants an ancient Superman comic with him lifting a car over his head while running.\n\nSay “Some crazy guy named Stan has a flat tire in front of our house. Seemed OK until he said he created Spider-Man…”\n\nIf none of the above gets a reaction, they are in deep denial or don’t read comics. If there is a response, stand clear of the door because you’re about to be run over.\n\nBeing a closeted comic fan takes work. That fan is often placed in the “never get a mate” or “mentally challenged” category, so he or she hides their obsession.\n\nAs an example, I have a mint in the box Japanese G.I. Joe. An ex-girlfriend of mine brought her little brother to see my toy collection.\n\nThis 10-year-old little snot opened my display case and was a second away from tearing open the box and 2 seconds away from ever reaching 11.\n\nI yelled no! so loud the Hell Spawn dropped the box and started crying.\n\nMy ex, she who must not be named, girlfriend could not understand why I had reacted that way. In what I thought was a well said and reasonable explanation of my behavior I explained to her just what little Satan was about to deface.\n\nAll she heard was blah blah, I don’t want anyone else playing with my doll, blah blah. She asked me what I would save first in a fire, her or my “doll.” I said, “Not the doll…the action figure.”\n\nShe said she didn’t think that was funny.\n\nHell, neither did I but I’m smart enough to know I was talking myself into a cold shower. I said I’d save her and would if there was sufficient time to do so after I got Captain Action to safety.\n\nWhat?\n\nRarely are folks like us understood by those who don’t share our love for comics and related stuff. Trying to explain why we do something to those who don’t is like yelling at someone who does not speak English.\n\nNo matter how loud you get, they still won’t understand you.\n\nComics needs all the support we can get, and you in the closet will come out once that respect is granted you won’t have to hide.\n\nNonetheless, we need your voices too, but no one can hear you with the door closed."
