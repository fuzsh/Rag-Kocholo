        "text": "Plenty of great films over the years have had extremely troubled productions, but have gone on to be hugely successful and influential — films such as Star Wars, Apocalypse Now, or Jaws. The old saying “art from adversity” is frequently cited in these cases — the idea that you have to suffer through a somewhat-crazy production in order to enjoy the high moments of a well-received film. It’s Murphy’s law of filmmaking, really: that things will inevitably go wrong, but that the payoff is all the more satisfying in the end.\n\nThe three aforementioned movies were all unique in their own ways. George Lucas and Steven Spielberg were both considered young up-and-comers; they had been mentored by industry giants, but still had plenty of doubters from major studios — and it didn’t help that both Jaws and Star Wars were beset with problems from the get-go. On the other hand, Francis Ford Coppola was an Oscar winner on top of the world when he made Apocalypse Now, but the director still dealt with mercurial actors, political unrest, and inclement weather when making the Vietnam epic in the Philippines.\n\nAnd then, every once in awhile, a film changes everything from the unlikeliest of places and from complete industry outsiders. Which brings us to George Miller, the Australian doctor-turned-filmmaker who created and directed the Mad Max series.\n\nMad Max and its resulting sequels have become so iconic and important in action movie culture that it’s increasingly hard to look at it with fresh eyes. Basically every post-apocalyptic sci-fi or action movie since has been influenced by the Mad Max series. For many years, the original Mad Max (released in 1979) held the Guinness World Record for most profitable film on a budget-to-box-office ratio: over USD$100 million worldwide on a budget of AUD$380,000.\n\nMiller, now age 72, was a complete neophyte when he was making the original Mad Max film in the summer of 1977. Miller was an ER doctor in residence at a hospital in Sydney and frequently treated car accident victims. He met producer Byron Kennedy, a self-taught filmmaker from Melbourne, in 1971 at a summer film course. Kennedy and Miller made a short action film shortly thereafter, which won several awards and gave them enough confidence to helm a feature on their own terms and with their own money.\n\nMiller had wanted to make a road film within the context of a realistically bleak, post-apocalyptic Australia, where fuel and water are in short supply, violent biker gangs rule the streets, and rogue policemen are the only major line of defense. Miller — who co-wrote the script with James McCausland — claimed that he wanted Mad Max to feel like “a silent movie with sound,” meaning that the story would be inherently simple, with the visuals reigning supreme.\n\nMcCausland was also inspired by the worldwide oil crisis of the late 70s, which hit Australia well before it hit the US (in 1973).\n\nA couple of oil strikes that hit many pumps revealed the ferocity with which Australians would defend their right to fill a tank….George and I wrote the script based on the thesis that people would do almost anything to keep vehicles moving and the assumption that nations would not consider the huge costs of providing infrastructure for alternative energy until it was too late.\n\nBoth Miller and Kennedy were able to raise a mixture of their own funds and some small contributions from state film bodies in Australia, who thought that the film had potential. Still, this was very much a micro-budget affair; Miller estimated that the final budget was AUD$380,000.\n\nCasting Mad Max proved to be very difficult, as Miller was putting all options on the table in order to stay within budget and still cast the right people for each part. The director even made a brief trip to Los Angeles, but eventually decided against casting American names due to the high cost. Instead, Miller and casting director Mitch Mathews found a group of recent graduates of the National Institute of Dramatic Art (NIDA), which included a 21-year-old Sydneysider named Mel Gibson.\n\nGibson had trained strictly as a theatre actor at NIDA and had only appeared in one feature film at that point, while his friend and classmate, Steve Bisley, was also cast in the movie. Three other cast members were Hugh Keays-Byrne, Vincent Gil, and Roger Ward, who played members of the biker gang; they had also previously appeared as bikers in a 1974 film called Stone that inspired Miller.\n\nDue to the tiny budget, Mad Max had only ten weeks to shoot — six for first unit shots and four weeks strictly dedicated to the chase sequences and stuntwork. Much of the film was shot in country Victoria, including the outskirts of Melbourne and the towns of Little River and Clunes.\n\nFour days into the shoot, Rose Bailey, who was originally cast as Max’s wife Jessie, got injured in an off-set accident and had to be replaced. The production was put on hold for two weeks until Joanne Samuel was hired to replace Bailey. In the end, the filming only took six weeks overall in the summer of 1977, with six more weeks on second unit footage. Some stunts had to be re-staged and more second-unit work had to be done in May 1978.\n\nThe shoot was guerrilla filmmaking at its finest, as the crew didn’t even have permits and Miller and Kennedy had to continuously sweep down the rural roads themselves. Thankfully, the Victoria Police didn’t shut anything down and were even able to help the crew escort the many stunt vehicles to set. Costumes were simple as well due to the limited budget, with almost all of the police jackets made of vinyl leather rather than real leather.\n\nMany of the biker extras featured were actual members of outlaw biker gangs and rode their own motorcycles in the film. Due to the prohibitive cost of flying in extra talent for short periods of filming, Miller had to ask the bikers to drive the 10-hour trip from Sydney to Melbourne for the production.\n\nPost-production was even more of an adventure. Miller and Kennedy co-edited the majority of the footage themselves and also collaborated on the sound editing at a friend’s apartment in Melbourne. Kennedy’s father, an engineer, helped construct a home-built machine for editing purposes. “Byron would cut sound in the lounge room and I’d cut picture in the kitchen,” Miller recalled.\n\nEventually, Miller and Kennedy were able to to bring in outside talent. Editor Tony Patterson helped work on Mad Max‘s post process for four months, but eventually left due to prior commitments. Miller and a friend, Cliff Hayes, worked on the editing for a few more months before completing the final cut with Kennedy. Sound engineer Roger Savage was then brought in to do the sound mixing.\n\nMad Max‘s musical score was composed by Brian May (not to be confused with the famous Queen guitarist), whose earlier work Miller had admired. “George was marvelous to work with,” May said in a later interview. “He had a lot of ideas about what he wanted even though he wasn’t a musician.”\n\nMad Max was released through Roadshow Entertainment in Australia, American International Pictures in the US, and Warner Bros. in the rest of the world. Concerned that the majority of American audiences wouldn’t understand the Aussie slang in the film’s dialogue, Mad Max was re-dubbed with American accents for its theatrical release. Because Gibson was not a star at the time, American trailers for Mad Max chose to emphasize more of the action sequences and the post-apocalyptic landscape of the movie, as opposed to focusing on a singular actor.\n\nDubbing aside, Mad Max didn’t do too well in the US at first and received a polarizing response from critics. However, the movie was a massive hit in its native country, grossing over AUD$5 million and receiving three Australian Film Institute Awards in 1979 (Best Editing, Best Sound, and Best Musical Score).\n\nAs we all know, the film became a cult classic and spawned two successful sequels also starring Gibson, as well as 2015’s long-awaited and acclaimed Fury Road, which starred Tom Hardy as Max. Miller, along with fellow director Peter Weir, is credited with opening up the market for Australian New Wave cinema to a worldwide audience. The Mad Max series continues to influence the look and feel of many sci-fi, action, and chase films, and helped introduce Gibson to American audiences.\n\nAnd it all started because of a couple of doctors and their wild passion for filmmaking."
