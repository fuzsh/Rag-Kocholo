        "text": "In a dystopian future Australia, the roads are run by violent marauders and gangs. Only a small few policemen stand against them, hoping to maintain some order and civilization. One such officer, Max (Mel Gibson) crosses paths with one of the more violent gangs led by a psychopath known as The Toecutter (Hugh Keays-Byrne). When The Toecutter starts targeting Max’s partner and family, Max decides to take the law into his own hands, seeking revenge on The Toecutter and his gang.\n\nA few weeks ago, I reviewed Mad Max: Fury Road, and I was pleasantly surprised by the awesome action and insane moments. I decided to go back and watch the 1979 original, and the two barely resemble each other. Taking Mad Max on its own, there are some great moments of action and suspense. Max is a well thought-out and defined character whose vengeance-filled motives seem entirely justified. The other supporting roles, such as his partner Goose (Steve Bisley) and his wife Jessie (Joanne Samuel) all play their parts well in establishing Max as an interesting character. In terms of action, it is much more limited than I expected. There are a few car/motorcycle chases and a couple gunfights. This makes it hard at times to actually see Mad Max as an action movie, since there are plenty of moments of down time.\n\nAll around, I found this movie to be particularly confusing. The pace is much slower than more modern action movies. It takes a while to establish the world, characters, and set up the villain. But once the movie does, it improves dramatically, as the villain and hero chase each other around through the back half hour of the short 90-minute run time. Mad Max might be great for someone who enjoys late 70’s and early 80’s action movies and viewers who can handle a slower pace. But if you’re looking for non-stop, edge-of-your-seat action, I suggest Fury Road instead.\n\nMad Max is rated R for violence and some sexuality.\n\nIn an apocalyptic future, Earth has become a desert wasteland. All of the planet is seemingly unlivable except one area where an evil tyrant named the Immortan Joe rules by having full control of a large supply of water. Not only does he control the water, but he controls the people by his army of War Boys, and his massive cars and trucks called War Rigs.\n\nAgainst Immortan Joe stands Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron) who rescues Joe’s “wives” and embarks on a dangerous escape across the wasteland. With her is Max (Tom Hardy) who also escaped Joe’s grasp after being captured by him and used for his blood. Together, they brave the harsh wild on an exhilarating high-speed chase as Joe seeks to reclaim what he thinks is his.\n\nMad Max: Fury Road epitomizes a great action movie. The movie is, start-to-finish, an edge of your seat heart-racing thriller. The costume design, along with the set pieces (which are vehicles rather than places) instantly immerse you in this post-apocalyptic world. Viewers watch enraptured as the action unfolds, creating moments of stunning madness, and there’s more than just explosions to love. Director George Miller choreographs Cirque du Soleil levels of acrobatics into the action scenes.\n\nBut, though the movie shines most in the action, it is more than that. Each character grows tremendously over the course of the movie. And questions of human dignity shine in strange ways, particularly in the development of one of the War Boys named Nux (Nicholas Hoult), a crazed worshiper of Immortan Joe, who is captured by Max and Furiosa. Through his experience with them and the women Furiosa is rescuing, he learns more about himself and goes from being a maddened zealot to a man willing to sacrifice himself for others.\n\nMad Max: Fury Road is a dark and violent display, matched by incredible cinematography and expert writing. It stands almost alone as one of the best action movies of the decade, and perhaps one of the best action movies ever made.\n\nMad Max: Fury Road is rated R for intense sequences of violence throughout, and for disturbing images.\n\nIt is available on Amazon and Amazon Prime Video.\n\n*review by Brennan Kress"
