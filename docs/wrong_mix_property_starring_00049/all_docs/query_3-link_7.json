        "text": "Fasten your seatbelts, because Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga is speeding onto digital platforms, one month after the movie opened in theaters. We know everything moves fast in the world of Mad Max, but, still, that seems fast!\n\nDirected by George Miller, who’s helmed every film in the Mad Max franchise since the original cult hit in 1979, this new film is intended as a prequel to 2015’s Mad Max: Fury Road. Anya Taylor-Joy steps into the role previously played by Charlize Theron, aka a young Imperator Furiosa. This version of Furiosa gets taken by a Biker Horde led by the Warlord Dementus (played by Chris Hemsworth), and is forced to endure trials as she attempts to get back home.\n\nThe Furiosa movie was praised by critics—it currently boasts a 90 percent on the review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes—but made around $161.49 million at the worldwide box office. That may sound like a lot, but it’s significantly less than Fury Road made (around $368 million). Maybe that’s why Warner Bros. is pushing the movie to digital a few weeks earlier than other blockbusters like Dune 2 and Godzilla X Kong, both of which got six weeks in theaters before going to digital, compared to Furiosa‘s four.\n\nBut even box office hits are getting released on “premium” video-on-demand—which is the industry term for charging movie theater prices for an earlier release on digital platforms—after a month in theaters or less. The new Furiosa will soon be available to watch at home, but you’ll have to pay a pretty penny to watch it—more, even, than you might pay to watch the movie in theaters. Why pay so much, when Furiosa will be streaming free on Max soon enough?\n\nHere’s what you should know about how to watch Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga online, and when to expect to see Furiosa streaming on Max.\n\nFuriosa: A Mad Max Saga digital release date:\n\nFuriosa: A Mad Max Saga will be released on digital platforms tomorrow, on Tuesday, June 25. Beginning tomorrow, you’ll be able to buy and rent digitally on Amazon Prime, Google Play, Apple TV, Vudu, and more. The price may vary depending on which platform you use to purchase the film, but on Amazon Prime the movie will cost $29.99 to buy, and $24.99 to rent.\n\nFuriosa: A Mad Max Saga will also be released on 4k UHD, DVD, and Blu-Ray on August 13. The 4K UHD release will come with the follow special features: “Highway to Valhalla: In Pursuit of Furiosa,” “Stowaway to Nowhere,” “Metal Beasts & Holy Motors,” “Darkest Angel: Anya Taylor-Joy as Furiosa,” and “Motorbike Messiah: Chris Hemsworth as Dementus.”\n\nThe Blu-ray will come with only the “Highway to Valhalla: In Pursuit of Furiosa” and the “Stowaway to Nowhere” special features.\n\nHow to rent the Furiosa movie online:\n\nFuriosa: A Mad Max Saga will be available to rent on digital platforms like Amazon Prime, Google Play, Apple TV, Vudu, and more, beginning on June 25. The movie will cost $24.99 to rent, and you’ll have 48 hours to watch the movie after hitting “play.”\n\nWhen will Furiosa be streaming on Max?\n\nThe Furiosa streaming release date on Max has not yet been announced, but we know that Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga will be on Max eventually because it is a Warner Bros. movie, and Max is the streaming service owned by Warner Bros. All the new WB theatrical movies end up streaming on Max, though the wait period has varied by title. Dune: Part Two, for example, was released on PVOD six weeks after opening in theaters, and began streaming on Max on May 21, about six weeks after it was released on PVOD.\n\nIf Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga—which is coming to digital about four weeks after opening in theaters—follows a similar release pattern, you can expect to see Furiosa on Max around late July 2024, about four weeks after its digital release date.\n\nThat said, this is all speculation. There is not yet an official Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga Max release date. If you want to watch Furiosa right away, you can buy or rent the movie online. The movie is sure to bring you much (Anya-Taylor) joy."
