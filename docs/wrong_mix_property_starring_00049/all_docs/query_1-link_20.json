        "text": "FILMMAKING\n\nThe Legend of Mad Max – The Complete Saga from Mad Max to Furiosa\n\nIan Nathan, Hardie Grant, $50\n\nThe Mad Max story is indeed the stuff of legend. It began as a film shot on-the-run during the late 1970s on the western outskirts of Melbourne for around $400,000 and has grown into a massive Hollywood franchise, part five of which cost $US168,000,000 (almost $253,000,000, more than 60 times its original budget).\n\nIt launched the career of American expatriate Mel Gibson, who’d moved to Sydney as a kid with his family in the late 1960s before graduating from NIDA in 1977. His salary for Mad Max (1979) was a whopping $15,000; after Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome (1985), the third film in the ongoing saga, it had skyrocketed beyond the million-dollar mark. At the same time, the series catapulted its co-creator, the mild-mannered former doctor George Miller, out of the casualty ward in Sydney’s St Vincent’s Hospital and into a Superman-tinged spotlight.\n\nWritten in the same snappy, helter-skelter style that the films maintain, British critic Ian Nathan’s handsomely illustrated book enthusiastically takes us through each of the films, detailing their production histories, situating them in the context of the Australian film renaissance of the ’70s, and appraising the evolution of a “Maxian mythology” through them. For him, the thematic thrust of the ongoing story – whose sixth part, if he’s correct, is on Miller’s to-do list – is about “stripping away civilisation to ponder what it means to be human”.\n\nNathan leaves little room for doubt about his view of the films. “They are as vital as the works of Chaplin and Keaton,” he proposes, “as inventive and ambitious as anything by DeMille, Kurosawa, Spielberg, or Cameron; as strange and funny and as non-conformist as anything by Bunuel, Tarkovsky, or Lynch.”\n\nPhew! As you can see, he’s not short of hyperbole in his assessments and his book is cram-packed with an intriguing mix of excess and insight. Sometimes, it’s a bit glib: the first Mad Max arrived like “a thunderclap over the tidy lawns of the Australian New Wave”!? Well, perhaps. But many films from that era, such as Peter Weir’s The Cars That Ate Paris (1974), Fred Schepisi’s The Chant of Jimmie Blacksmith and Richard Franklin’s Patrick (both 1978), are hardly sunshine and roses.\n\nMuch of his commentary is astute, though, as he provides a list of how “hints of films past dance through Fury Road like dust devils”, or expounds on the always articulate Miller’s comments about the ways in which the silent cinema left its mark on the show-don’t-tell style he’s brought to the films. Or likens the remote township of Bartertown in Beyond Thunderdome to “Deadwood painted by Hieronymous Bosch”; or recognises how in Fury Road “the clouds of dust billowed up behind Immortan Joe’s shimmering armada (are) like a demonic twist on the ‘mirage’ in Lawrence of Arabia”, a film which Miller acknowledges as an influence.\n\nHe’s also spot-on in his description of the writer-director as unlike the kind of person you’d expect from the films, and more like “a genial sociology professor bemused to find himself orchestrating mayhem”. He accurately traces Miller’s growing fascination with the art of storytelling throughout his career and how it has impacted on the films he’s made. And his captions for the abundant photos throughout the book have all been carefully drafted to expand upon the main body of text, a contrast to the throwaway descriptions routinely deployed in most film books.\n\nSome of the tales he has to tell about the making of the films may or may not be apocryphal. Like the one about the City of Sydney taking the Thunderdome production to court because the Glebe-based set housing the film’s Underworld and its 400 pigs “was a hotbed for transmissible diseases”. According to his account, the council believed that the pigs’ urine was being projected two feet into the air and absorbed into the atmosphere.\n\nLoading\n\nStories like this are certainly entertaining. However, the absence of any indication of where they come from inevitably creates a credibility problem. Nathan includes a general list of his sources, but there are no footnotes. And, I suspect, because his history is based on research done from afar rather than on the spot, he sometimes gets things wrong. Which only exacerbates the issue.\n\nIt doesn’t really matter that he thinks Geelong is a suburb rather than a city, but when he merges the well-known actor and Beyond Thunderdome cast member Frank Thring Jr. with his famous filmmaking father (who made The Sentimental Bloke in 1932) it’s more serious. And, perhaps I slept in that day, but I don’t recall petrol shortages in the 1970s leading gun-wielding motorists to lay siege to “gas stations”.\n\nIt would be churlish to allow blunders like this – or Nathan’s cryptic, sometimes grammatically ramshackle prose – to lead one to ignore the qualities of his irrepressibly ardent study. His zappy turn of phrase frequently hits its target and he brings a keen critical eye to the ways in which the Mad Max films draw on a wide range of sources – including earlier locally made films such as The Cars That Ate Paris and the biker thriller Stone (1974) – as well as constantly referencing each other."
