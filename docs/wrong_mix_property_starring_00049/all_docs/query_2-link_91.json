        "text": "This paper is an attempt to analyze the theme of \"dystopia\" in Mad Max I (1979), a movie from the Australian cinema, which uses American leitmotifs in new disguises. While, on the one hand, the paper will focus on the cinematic representation of the theme of dystopia in the specified movie; on the other, it will have occasional references to other literary and cinematic works that are related to or center on the theme. Before embarking on a discussion of the semiotic and structural workings of cinematic dystopia, I consider it inevitable to give a definition and origin of literary dystopia, in reference to which I will argue about the subject matter. Therefore, in the first part of the paper, there will be a laconic survey of literary dystopia and its fundamental characteristics.\n\nMad Max: Fury Road has been critiqued for its feminist, masculine, biblical, and environmental themes, but these critiques fail to engage with the connection between humans, machines, and the Earth in Fury Road. Nuclear technology may have produced the apocalyptic wasteland in which the film is set, but machines and industrial technology remain coupled to humanity to the point of symbiosis. Through the images of Fury Road, director George Miller reveals an ideology of ecomobility that demands an assemblage of human and machine. To exist in the wild and desolate spaces of the Earth is to become one with machines. Further, despite the distraction of subjective violence, the film is a critique of the ideological fantasy of modernity's regime of automobility and its connection to capitalism.\n\nGeorge Miller’s Mad Max series has established the unique subgenre of post-apocalyptic road movie. Interestingly, its episodic structure of Max navigating across disparate dystopian desert towns reflects human history in general with politico-economic shifts and techno-environmental concerns. Evoking the 1970s-80s oil and nuclear crises, the series stages an endangered future when the survivors’ struggle for scarce resources intensifies on an ever-larger scale. The vicious cycle of violence grows accordingly, in the lawless state of exception and the prehistorical state of nature followed by brutal regimes of commerce and dominion. Mad Max: Fury Road proposes that the only alternative to such a hostile community is to fight and change it within it. The imperial “Citadel” that eclectically embodies mythic fundamentalism, colonial autocracy, neoliberal inequality, and biopower technology is overthrown by its abject lives who become the united agents of revolution. Nonetheless, Max leaves the utopia he enables, which suggests deep skepticism about communal civilization as if its future New Normal would repeat the apocalyptic past he underwent. Yet his “atopian” drift also resonates with today’s post-historical (pre-apocalyptic) “liquid modern” subjectivity: modulable individualistic agency for survival, competition, pleasure, and connection without political collectivity. Max’s flight from a new world’s potential apocalypse is thus a symptom of ‘our’ post-political lifestyle stuck in the perpetual present when more and more global disasters are predicted to threaten the entire humankind. This paradox underlies the film saga’s loop of historical déjà vu, which I will critically explore in light of the current pandemic situation.\n\nMuch post-modern cinematic narrative has been preoccupied with apocalyptic, post-apocalyptic, and dystopian fantasies that closely reflect aspects of our lived reality. This paper seeks to distinguish the boundaries between films categorized as apocalyptic, post-apocalyptic, and dystopian and to examine some of the most iconic cinematic artifacts in each of the categories to differentiate their parameters and to explore in detail dystopian film through the prism of cultural theory, to better understand the cultural work that specifically dystopia cinema does. Dystopia film is primarily concerned with the social conditions inherent to patriarchal capitalism in which the narratives simultaneously expose and reproduce social and economic contradictions in an ideological process of repressive tolerance. Contemporary dystopia films such as In Time (Andrew Nicoll, 2011) and The Purge (James DeMonaco, 2013) criticize the aspects of capitalism that contradict social mythologies in an effort to reconcile these contradictions with a valorizing fantasy of romance and revolution.\n\nIn George Miller's post-apocalyptic film, Mad Max: Fury Road (2015), issues concerning automobility, Indigeneity and environmental justice are inextricably intertwined. The depiction of vehicles and mobilities needs to be understood in the cultural and historical context the film draws on, such as the history of the Stolen Generations. This article aims at addressing the representation of the Stolen Generations in Fury Road in order to add another layer to previous readings of the film. Although the representation of Indigeneity in the film is problematic in several respects, the implications of such a reading of the female protagonist Furiosa and the elderly women called Vuvalini as Indigenous are intriguing, particularly when taking into account that Immortan Joe and his War Boys stand for a white masculinity. So far, readings of Indigeneity in current scholarship on the film are limited to criticising shortcomings. I want to suggest that paying attention to Fury Road's Indigenous coding allows for two significant (re)interpretations of the film: firstly, it is possible to read the upending of Immortan Joe's regime as Indigenous and feminist resistance to colonial and patriarchal legacies; and secondly, Furiosa's and the Vuvalini's participation in automobility balances their stereotypical proximity to the land. Indeed, neither Furiosa nor the elderly women are victimised; instead, they oscillate between being the harbingers of hope and the perpetrators of violence.\n\nThis article explores articulations of the posthuman in two millennial post-apocalyptic films, I Am Legend and Mad Max: Fury Road. Using Rosi Braidotti’s posthuman theory, this article argues that despite the humanist trajectory of I Am Legend’s protagonist the film still expresses the notion of becoming-posthuman but in a latent form—through specific narrative and visual elements, but also via its alternate ending. This research labels these concealed expressions of the posthuman “latent posthumanism,” a tendency that is also evident in most contemporary Hollywood post-apocalyptic films with male leads. The essay then moves on to discuss Mad Max: Fury Road, as a rare case of blockbuster film where this latent posthumanism becomes explicit mainly through its female protagonist and its ecofeminist discourses. Both films suggest the potential of the post-apocalyptic film to provide important insights into expanded notions of subjectivity beyond the human.\n\nGeorge Miller redefined the ‘postapocalyptic’ genre with his Mad Max series (1979-2015). It appeared as though the franchise was dead due to the somewhat lacklustre response to the concluding film of the original series, Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome in 1985. After years of attempting to revive the series, Mad Max: Fury Road began production in 2013 amongst a degree of scepticism from fans of the series. Miller had moved away from post-apocalyptic worlds and turned ‘family-friendly’, giving us the adaptation of Babe (1995) and its underrated sequel Babe: Pig in the City (1998) as well as Happy Feet (2006) and its sequel (2011). However, when released, Mad Max: Fury Road was met with critical and commercial success, re-establishing Miller as the ‘road warrior’ of the postapocalyptic genre."
