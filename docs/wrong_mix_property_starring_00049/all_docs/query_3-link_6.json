        "text": "Mad Max is the novelised story of the film of the same title. The novel was written by Terry Kaye.\n\nDescription[]\n\nThe First Edition was released in March 1979 by Circus Books to coincide with the first film. The novelisation was written from the George Miller story.\n\nSecond Printing[]\n\nA Second Edition was released in 1985 as a tie-in to Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome [1] The cover featured the same \"Mad Max\" title logo, but the Frank Frazetta artwork was the same used on many of the posters and home video releases.\n\nThe cover also featured a cool, little blurb, \"When the gangs take over the highways . . . pray he's still out there somewhere.\"\n\nBoth editions are now long out of print.\n\nFrom the rear cover:\n\n“MAD MAX will make you stab for the brake until the very last page.\n\nYour blood will turn to ice and your eyes will squirm with horror. Bullet down the spine of suicide highway with the Toe Cutter, Bubba Zanetti, and Johnny the Boy hissing with revenge for the death of their hero The Night Rider, killed after a frenzied car chase with mad-cop Max.\n\nMad Max, Jim the Goose, and Fifi Macaffee follow a twisted trail of highway smashes, torture, and brutality in pursuit of the nomad bikies. MAD MAX will careen you into a metallic volcano, exploding with fiendish crimes, lightning chase scenes and one man’s madness against a gang of bike riding psychopaths. Hit the road with MAD MAX and crash the hot metal nightmare of a lifetime.\n\nSTEPHEN KING AND HUNTER S. THOMSPON EAT YOUR HEARTS OUT!”\n\nUnauthorized Audiobook[]\n\nAn unabridged and unauthorized audiobook was produced for Episode #68 by \"Audiobooks for the Damned\" and published on YouTube on April 15, 2018. It has an approximate running time of 5 hours and 6 minutes. Interestingly, AFTD produced the first Mad Max, last."
