These climate fiction narratives are as diverse as Swastika Night by Katharine Burdekin (1937); the incomplete Parable trilogy by Octavia Butler (1993–98); MaddAddam by Margaret Atwood (2003–2014); The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins (2008–10); The Strain by Guillermo del Toro and Chuck Hogan (2009–11); the book and film adaptations of J. G. Ballard’s High-Rise (1975) and Meg Rosoff’s How I Live Now (2004); V: The Original Miniseries by Kenneth Johnson (1983); V for Vendetta by Alan Moore and David Lloyd (1982–89); the “A Boy and His Dog” story cycle by Harlan Ellison; and the films Zardoz (1974), Spacehunter: Adventures in the Forbidden Zone (1983), Tank Girl (1995), Iron Sky (2012), Snowpiercer (2013), and Mad Max: Fury Road (2015).\n\nThe narratives enumerated above vary vastly in quality, from the canonical classics that are respected by scholars of literature, film, television, and graphic novels to ambivalently embraced cult classics to works so artistically disposable that they barely have champions among those who cherish nerd culture and “trash cinema.” Devoting a chapter to such qualitatively uneven works is defensible in terms laid out by I. Q. Hunter, author of British Trash Cinema (2013), once the argument is expanded beyond the scope of Britain to include all national cinemas: “Critics have often been at odds with popular tastes, which they cannot police and regularly despair at, and with the even more recherché tastes of cultists and cineastes, who revel in bizarre and undervalued films maudits and who, when they notice British films at all, love a different kind of British cinema and perhaps a different version of Britain.” Hunter explains that trashy films are culturally and artistically significant because they enable “little stabs of insight into what might grandiosely be described as the Unconscious, even what the Marxist critic Frederic Jameson calls the Political Unconscious, of … culture seething with repression and coming apart.”1 The somewhat disreputable films and books considered in this chapter provide more than stabs of insight into the Political Unconscious—they blow the doors off the Political Unconscious, most notably in their exploration of Ur-Fascist villains, feminist heroes, and Marxist ideologies.\n\nAs we have seen, fascist villains have been a staple of climate fiction since the birth of the genre. Perhaps most notably, C. S. Lewis’s That Hideous Strength features the fascist villains of N.I.C.E. who represent a physical threat (they try to kill the heroes), an ideological threat (they try to brainwash all of England through co-opting the mass media), and a spiritual and psychological threat (flawed protagonist Mark Studdock joins N.I.C.E. because his poor self-esteem and weak character predisposes him to embracing fascism). The Daleks, Orcs, and the Empire from Doctor Who, Lord of the Rings, and Star Wars all serve the same narrative function as the Ur-Fascist villains of N.I.C.E. This is no mere lazy genre trope, employing the Nazis and neo-Nazis as pro-forma, They Saved Hitler’s Brain–style villainy. Fascists are a staple of climate fiction villainy because they are the ideological opposites of environmentalists; they model a fundamentally unhealthy, utilitarian attitude toward the world. Wendell Berry has argued that when we manipulate everything in our environment to service us, we subjugate all forms of life in a fascist-like manner: “This, clearly, is a dictatorial form of behavior, as it is as totalitarian in its use of people as it is in its use of nature. Its connections to the world and to humans and the other creatures become more and more abstract, as its economy, its authority, and its power becomes more and more centralized.”2\n\nThe Ur-Fascist societies depicted in the controversial narratives listed above are oppressive but maintain control by providing an illusion of stability in a world gone mad. The leaders of these societies build religions around themselves, inspiring the worship of those they have subjugated. Their Messianic status grants them the right to persecute and kill anyone who opposes them, and to collect wives, mistresses, and prostitutes around them as trophy-like testimonials to their power. They are also not above incestuous sex. In several of these narratives, charismatic idealists attempt to overthrow the Ur-Fascist overlords by inciting populist uprisings of women and the oppressed working classes in the hopes of forming a more egalitarian society. The villains of these pieces are not only the totalitarian rulers and their militaristic henchmen, but also the cowed members of the middle and lower classes who are too awed by the Messianic veneer of the Ur-Fascist leadership, too enraptured by the prospect of sharing in the pomp and wealth of the ruling classes to want to see those classes humbled, or too afraid of the fruitlessness of the rebellion to help the rebels mount any real challenge to the Ur-Fascists. Each of the narratives identified above depicts slightly different outcomes to the insurgencies, but one consistent theme is the importance of undermining the patriarchal system of thought that validates oppression by giving the villains the tools to cast themselves as Messianic figures or heroes.\n\nIn “Eternal Fascism: Fourteen Ways of Looking at a Blackshirt” (1995), Umberto Eco wrote that\n\nUr-Fascism is still around us, sometimes in plainclothes. It would be so much easier for us if there appeared on the world scene someone saying, “I want to reopen Auschwitz, I want the Blackshirts to parade again in the Italian squares.” Life is not that simple. Ur-Fascism can come back under the most innocent of disguises. Our duty is to uncover it and point our finger at any of its new instances—every day, in every part of the world. Franklin Roosevelt’s words of November 4, 1938 are worth recalling: “If American democracy ceases to move forward as a living force, seeking day and night by peaceful means to better the lot of our citizens, fascism will grow in strength in our land.” Freedom and liberation are an unending task.3\n\nEco enumerates and explicates a list of fourteen features “typical” of an Ur-Fascism (or “Eternal Fascism”) to clarify the connective philosophical tissue between manifestations of fascism in different cultures and historical periods. The following are paraphrased, truncated versions of Eco’s fourteen traits of Ur-Fascism, which are presented here for their cultural import as well as their relevance to an understanding of Ur-Fascism in climate fiction. For Eco, Ur-Fascism involves:\n\n1.cult-like reverence for tradition;\n\n2.embracing irrationality and anti-intellectualism;\n\n3.celebration of swift, impulsive, violent action;\n\n4.the view that all dissent is tantamount to treason;\n\n5.belief that dissent suggests a diverse populace, and diversity is evil in this mindset—therefore, Ur-Fascism is implicitly and explicitly racist;\n\n6.rallying the angry feelings of an economically beleaguered middle class;\n\n7.embracing a paranoid form of patriotism in which Ur-Fascists are obsessed with one or many conspiracy theories about subversives or foreigners conquering their beloved homeland;\n\n8.envy of the prosperity of their cultural, ideological, and economic enemies;\n\n9.the view that “life is permanent warfare” and “pacifism is trafficking with the enemy”;\n\n10.belief that the masses are weak and contemptible and must be subdued by a strong leader for their own benefit;\n\n11.love of narratives of heroism in which heroes deal out death to vast numbers of enemies before they themselves fall gloriously in battle. (Notably, all citizens are encouraged to emulate these heroic values, and all citizens should consider themselves heroes.)\n\n12.a scenario in which men who are cheated of an opportunity to claim military victory in combat and call themselves heroes transfer their frustrated feelings of aggression to women and “effeminate” men. Consequently, the endless war ethic and hero mentality leads to antifeminist and homophobic attitudes and the exploitation of women and gays in an Ur-Fascist society;\n\n13.an establishment force that uses up-to-date broadcasting technology to create the illusion of populism. In Nazi Germany, radio and film were the most effective means of disseminating Ur-Fascist propaganda. In our present day, cable television, internet sites such as YouTube and Reddit, and social media venues such as Twitter and Facebook join these technologies to present to the public an extremist, minority view as the unified Voice of the People. This niche voice is given the most broadcast attention because it happens to shore up the political power and objectives of the Ur-Fascist rulers;\n\n14.public discourse that is defined by the Ur-Fascist equivalent of Newspeak, including poor vocabulary, syntax, a lack of trust in objective truths or facts, and inability to embrace complex ideas or employ critical thinking skills.\n\nIt is of enormous import that the above elements of Ur-Fascism described by Eco are the opposite of the sociopolitical values espoused by environmentalist advocates of ethical stewardship of the planet, point by point. That is why it should be no surprise that Ur-Fascists are the central villains in all the works of climate fiction covered in these pages. The Ur-Fascist ideology is pervasive in climate fiction, as it is in the real world in the twenty-first century, making it worthy of further analysis.\n\nIn both climate fiction and reality, Ur-Fascists are revered partly because they make the people they subjugate feel “important” and hint that, one day, one of the worthiest among them might be elevated to a heroic status, if not to the highest status in the land as the next Ur-Fascist leader. This idea is disseminated through propagandistic entertainment, religious and political sermons, heavily biased sources of “news,” and in classrooms controlled by teachers who indoctrinate their students instead of instruct them to think for themselves. For example, Margaret Atwood’s The Handmaid’s Tale contains numerous segments in a classroom in which sexually enslaved women are drilled on the honor it is for them to be raped and impregnated by wealthy patriarchs in a dystopian society plagued by widespread sterility.\n\nOne of the more memorable film scenes on this theme in recent years is the classroom segment that serves as the thematic centerpiece of Snowpiercer (2013). The film’s dramatic conceit is that the last remaining humans on Earth have survived a freak-accident ice apocalypse on a never-ending train voyage. On the train, the wealthy few enjoy luxury in the front cars, the poor are starved and enslaved in the tail section, and the middle class in the center cars are indoctrinated to love and serve their wealthy benefactors. At the end of the film’s first act, one of the tail sectioners, the young, powerful, and charismatic Curtis (Chris Evans) leads a rebellion in hopes of taking control of the entire train and redistributing the remaining wealth and goods more equitably among the passengers. Curtis calculates that their oppressors ran out of bullets some time ago and lack the capacity to make any new ones. If his theory is true, then the guards have been maintaining control of the train by frightening the tail sectioners with unloaded automatic weapons. The theory appears correct as Curtis and his forces ignite the rebellion and take control of several of the rear cars with relative ease. They face their first, bloody contest as they near the water recycling plant, and win a pyrrhic victory taking that car and capturing Minister Mason (Tilda Swinton) the voice of their oppressive leader, Wilford. Afterward, the hostage Mason leads Curtis and his main supporters on a quest to walk the length of the train and confront Wilford in his office haven in the Engine compartment. On the way, the dirty, bloodied tail sectioner rebels wander into a pristine grammar school classroom overseen by a pregnant, blonde, beaming teacher in an old-fashioned, floral-print dress. Acting as if a rebellion were not in full sway, Teacher begins a film showing the students a hagiographic biography of Wilford, praising him for his forethought in preparing for the apocalypse by designing the Snowpiercer, for his beneficence in hand-picking the survivors of humanity to occupy the train, and for the burden of leadership he has assumed in keeping the train well maintained and impervious to the biting cold. The children then sing a frightening propaganda song in Wilford’s honor that sounds much like a church hymn.\n\nTEACHER: Mr. Wilfred knew that CW7 would freeze the world, so what did the prophetic Mr. Wilford invent to protect the chosen from that calamity?\n\n10-YEAR-OLD KIDS IN THE CLASSROOM: The Engine!\n\nTOGETHER: Rumble, rumble, rumble, rattle, rattle, it will never die!\n\nTEACHER: [playing organ music and singing] What happens if the engine stops?\n\nKIDS: [singing continuously] We all freeze and die!\n\nTEACHER: But will it stop? Oh, will it stop?\n\nKIDS: No, no!\n\nTEACHER: Can you tell us why?\n\nTOGETHER: The engine is eternal!\n\nYes!\n\nThe engine is forever!\n\nYes!\n\nRumble, rumble, rattle, rattle!\n\nWho is the reason why?\n\nWilfred, yeah!\n\nWilfred, Wilfred, hip-hip hooray!\n\nThis scene was inspired by a similar segment in Vol. 1 of the Snow Piercer comic book, in which a tail sectioner is led up the course of the train and stumbles across a frightening religious ceremony hosted by the Brotherhood of the Engine.4 Transposing the themes and dialogue from a religious ceremony to a grammar school classroom was an inspired decision on the part of the filmmakers. In a chilling (if not subtle) manner, the film evokes the critique of the dehumanizing effects of imperialist education on both teacher and students condemned by Paulo Freire in his educational polemic Pedagogy of the Oppressed (1968).\n\nAt the song’s close, Teacher draws the students’ attention to the compartment’s windows, knowing that Curtis will look out them as well. Through the windows, onlookers can see ice and snow coating a once great and now dead human civilization. On this part of the Snowpiercer’s journey, among the snow-covered wasteland, viewers can make out the frozen figures of seven humans, petrified, mere yards from the train tracks. Teacher tells the gathering that the figures are the members of a failed rebellion, “The Revolt of the Seven,” which took place “fifteen years ago, in the third year of the train.” The rebels had attempted to stop the train, supposing the Earth had warmed enough that they could survive in the frozen landscape, free of Wilford’s tyranny. When they failed to stop the train, they leaped from its safety and tried to find shelter. “There they are, that’s how far they made it,” Teacher observes smugly. The remark triggers a new religious ritual, in which Teacher and students make knife-handed salutes and chant in observance of Wilford’s greatness, and in mockery of those who would seek to escape his domain. The phrases “we all freeze and die” and “we all die” are repeated to underscore this point.\n\nIf it isn’t already apparent at this point in the film, it becomes clear by the climax that even though this classroom lesson is a ritual and a staple of the children’s education, it is being staged at this precise moment to educate Curtis ideologically. Throughout the film, the seemingly absent and disengaged Wilford is slyly instructing Curtis about the folly of rebellion against the status quo while giving Curtis a guided tour of the train. As Curtis moves up the course of Snowpiercer, he develops a sense of the entire contained ecosystem. By the time he reaches the Engine, he has learned enough to be groomed to replace the aging Wilford. The twist is that, while Curtis hopes to seize control of the train from Wilford and transform the train into an egalitarian community, what is happening is that Wilford intends to hand control of the train over to Curtis, on the condition that Curtis will be neither liberator nor reformer, but the new Ur-Fascist ruler of Snowpiercer.\n\nWhen Curtis discovers that bullets are not, in fact, extinct, and most of his followers are massacred in a barrage of automatic weapons fire, he begins to realize that his rebellion was not so much successful as it was encouraged and orchestrated by both Wilford and Curtis’s tail section mentor, Gilliam (John Hurt), to groom Curtis for leadership. The aging Gilliam, the first leader figure to emerge in the tail section and the hero who had brought an end to cannibal culture there, had long since become a corrupt part of the status quo of Snowpiercer, pretending to oppose Wilford at every turn while secretly talking with Wilford each night on the phone, planning the future of humanity. Between them, the two old men settled on Curtis to take over both roles—leader of the tail section and head of the Engine—because he was young, handsome, intelligent, aggressive, and Caucasian. Other worthy candidates for leadership, such as Tanya (Octavia Spencer) were disregarded based on their race, gender, ethnicity, or the ways in which their impoverished lives marked their physique, deportment, and speaking style. Gilliam and Wilford agree that a shortage of food and other resources warrants a culling of a healthy percentage of the denizens of the tail section, which will be carried out in retribution for a failed rebellion that Gilliam will coax Curtis to orchestrate. Interestingly, while Gilliam betrays Curtis by revealing the most intimate details of their interactions to Wilford, part of him appears to hope that Curtis will succeed in killing Wilford and reforming the culture of Snowpiercer, as he tells Curtis not to listen to Wilford’s silver tongue, but to execute him the moment they meet for the first time.\n\nWhen a captive Curtis does meet Wilford (Ed Harris), he is unable to follow Gilliam’s advice. The God of Snowpiercer talks of the burden of leadership and the need to pass the torch onto a worthy successor. It is a lonely job, and filled with grim responsibilities—like orchestrating the occasional culling—but it is a job that he believes a murderer such as Curtis is fit for. The perks involve silence and privacy in the solitude of the Engine room, two things that Curtis has not experienced in almost twenty years. There is also a zaftig bodyguard dressed in yellow who almost never speaks and who serves as a sexual plaything of the God of Snowpiercer. Curtis will inherit her as well. Disenchanted by learning that Gilliam had sold out the tail section at some unknown point in the past, remembering the horrors of life in a cannibalistic society, and furious at the decadence, cruelty, and stupidity he has witnessed on the tour of the train, Curtis wonders if he should not, after all, take this rabble in hand and lead them just as Wilford has. However, he discovers that Snowpiercer’s perpetual motion engine is kept running only though the round-the-clock work of enslaved children—the manual labor needed to replace broken parts that could no longer be manufactured in the self-contained world of the train. When Curtis sees the cost of maintaining Snowpiercer, he decides that the train needs to be derailed, as another insurgent, the Inuit Namgoong Minsoo (Kang Ho Song), had insisted earlier. Minsoo is convinced that the snow outside is melting, that the planet was finally warming again, and that the Earth could now sustain life beyond the confines of Snowpiercer. Seeing to the welfare of the children, Curtis does not stop Minsoo from setting off an explosive charge that flips Snowpiercer off its tracks. In the wreck that follows, all the lives aboard Snowpiercer are lost save for Minsoo’s daughter and Tanya’s son. The Inuit girl and black boy walk away from the burning train into the snow-swept landscape. They are cold but not freezing to death. In the final shots of the film, they catch sight of a polar bear—the first sign of life they encounter beyond the confines of the train—which offers the hope to this new Adam and Eve that other life lies just over the next snowdrift.\n\nThe film was a thematic, not literal, adaptation of the recently reprinted graphic novels Snow Piercer 1: The Escape (1982) and Snow Piercer 2: The Explorers (1999–2000). Interestingly, the film is different enough from the source material that the comic book creators were able to claim it as part of the series’ own continuity—treating it as an adventure that took place on a different Snowpiercer. (There are ten miracle trains, per comic book lore.) Therefore, the graphic novel Snow Piercer 3: Terminus by Olivier Bouchet and Jean-Marc Rochette acts as a follow-up to both the film and Snow Piercer 2: The Explorers (2016), and reveals the final fate of the film’s “Adam and Eve,” Tim and Yona.\n\nIf one were inclined to be critical of the Snowpiercer film and comics, one might suggest that it is a perfect specimen of what Tolkien disliked about the allegory genre. Overt symbolism is rampant. Dialogue is loaded with contemporary political significance. The construction of the world is so ideologically informed and designed to be pedagogical that it feels wholly artificial. It is also, arguably, derivative and contains plot and thematic elements from J. G. Ballard’s High-Rise transplanted from skyscraper to train. The characters are broadly drawn, representing concepts: rich woman, poor man, and middle-class child. The villains are so operatically evil they are about as intellectually and spiritually nuanced as Orcs or Daleks, yet they are not supposed to be hive-minded automatons. (Of course, this is a deliberate political point the film is making.) Whether one is inclined to consider Snowpiercer brilliant or contrived or somewhere in between, the film is noteworthy for having been distributed in America despite its subversive content. As David Denby wrote in The New Yorker, “Snowpiercer, like Elysium and The Hunger Games movies, presents a portrait of oligarchical rule and underclass discontent; these films are fueled by disgust for the decadent rich and admiration for the outraged poor. Is revolution being hatched in the commercial cinema?”5\n\nRevolt of the Matriarchs: Octavia Butler’s Parable of the Sower and Parable of the Talents\n\nUnhappy and impoverished people are desperate to see their lot in life improved, and when it seems that hard work is not being rewarded and “the American Dream” is illusory, it is then that a narrative such as Snowpiercer is popular. However, would-be revolutionaries such as Curtis—or, perhaps, some viewers of Snowpiercer—cannot help but be in awe of the Ur-Fascist ruler and his trappings of wealth and power even as they plot to drag him down from his (Iron) Throne and place his head upon a spike. Indeed, many would-be revolutionaries wonder what it would be like to take the Ur-Fascist’s place upon the throne, proving to be poor revolutionaries after all. Gilliam is corrupted in this fashion and Curtis almost is. Snowpiercer asks us to consider just how invested we are in becoming wealthy and powerful and how much of our feelings of solidarity with the suffering masses is illusory. Do we object to the concept of Ur-Fascist oppression or do we only object to being counted among the oppressed? Would our horror at social injustice vanish if we won the lottery and were magically granted a seat at the banquet table with the Ur-Fascists?\n\nWhen we watch a dystopian film such as Snowpiercer or Hunger Games, do we think critically about both sides of the dramatized conflict and are we sure which characters we should be sympathetic to and/or rooting for to win? When we watch the cyberpunk film Blade Runner, should we feel more empathy for Rick Dekard or Roy Batty? Or does the end of Blade Runner suggest that that is not the right question to be asking? When we watch Snowpiercer, what character do we find the most compelling and relate to the most: the poor Tanya, who only wants her enslaved son back, or the articulate, polished Wilford, with his fine wine and gourmet steak? When we consider other postapocalyptic scenarios, what characters do we see ourselves in? Most of us probably flatter ourselves that we will be either the Ur-Fascist or the head of the rebellion—Darth Vader or Luke Skywalker, President Snow or Katniss Everdeen. Do we ever see ourselves as the victim of the village massacre on Jakku carried out by Finn’s Stormtrooper compatriots in Star Wars: The Force Awakens (2015)? Do we see ourselves among the enslaved, like Anakin Skywalker’s mother in Star Wars: The Phantom Menace (1999)?\n\nAre we more like the brothel owner Littlefinger in Game of Thrones, or are we one of his whores? Perhaps one of the reasons why Tyrion Lannister is so popular a character in the universe of Westeros and Shae is so frequently criticized is that Tyrion is the vulnerable but wealthy and clever survivor we would like to see ourselves as and Shae is the pathetic, subjugated prostitute we fear we would be in a “survival of the fittest,” pseudo-medieval universe. After all, in the Martin novels, all of the scenes featuring Shae are told from Tyrion’s perspective, and she is granted no interiority—her thoughts and feelings are as closed to us as the narrator’s of The Handmaid’s Tale are open to us. When reading the MaddAddam trilogy, it might well feel better to readers to relate to Snowman, the fallen-from-grace best friend of the Messianic Crake, than to identify with the child prostitute Oryx, the high-end prostitute Ren, or the rape victims Toby and Amanda Payne. This is also one of the lessons Atwood provides in the epilogue of The Handmaid’s Tale. When a male historian immerses himself in the heroic, horrifying memoir of a woman who lived as a sex slave in the now fallen civilization of Gilead, he cannot bring himself to research and explicate her story, only strive to find out more about her oppressor, “the Commander.” After all, to the male historian, the Commander is a far more interesting subject of study since patriarchs are inherently fascinating and their victims are not.\n\nThe problem is that patriarchs are not inherently fascinating. They are small. The Commander in The Handmaid’s Tale has an imposing military title and is one of the founders of the Ur-Fascist regime, but he is ridiculous as a man, looking for constant validation from Offred, the woman he has enslaved, and approval from her for the system he designed that keeps her a slave. Even his real name—Fred—sounds too pedestrian to be the real name of a “Commander.” Furthermore, his efforts to coax Offred to fall in love with him instead of just being his slave underline his own insecurity and emptiness as a human being. It is bad enough that he is enslaving Offred; it is still more horrible that he wants to be loved as the slave master. (And he even wants her to delight in playing Scrabble with him.) In A Song of Ice and Fire by George R. R. Martin, Tyrion makes the same demand of Shae and kills her in part because she refuses to comply with this demand. Her love is an act. Inauthentic. When he realizes this, he feels emasculated and murders her. (Of course, the key phrase above is, “in part,” since Tyrion also kills her because she testifies against him during his trial.)\n\nIn The Handmaid’s Tale, what Fred has in his favor is pomp and circumstance and a title—and that is all. His power is all smoke and mirrors and myth: the cult of the wealthy, the Godhood of the Ur-Fascist. Take that mystique away from him and he is ripe for deposing, either by a successor Ur-Fascist or by a mass uprising of those he has subjugated. In the epilogue, readers learn he was likely replaced by still more extremist totalitarians who saw him as having gone soft shortly after the events depicted in Offred’s autobiographical account.\n\nWhen climate fiction such as The Handmaid’s Tale is told from the perspective of the victims of sexual exploitation, and explicitly condemns the Ur-Fascist antagonist, then they act as a challenge to fascist thinking in the real world. When climate fiction seems to invite audience identification with fascist characters, and depicts scenes of rape from the perspective of the fascist rapist in a manner that makes rape seem somehow justifiable or enjoyable, then the climate fiction is promoting fascist thinking in the real world. Ideally, climate fiction should always challenge fascist thinking. That is its central job in promoting a more ecologically just world.\n\nThe Ur-Fascist as God\n\nIn climate fiction narratives set in a postapocalyptic world ruled by Ur-Fascists, the Ur-Fascists maintain their control over the populace by placing a religious gloss over all their activities, whether those activities include feeding and protecting their subjects or raping and executing them. These Ur-Fascists cloak themselves in the robes of godhood and give a ritualistic quality to the moments at which the Ur-Fascists are doing the most to humiliate their subjects. In Mad Max: Fury Road (2015), Immortan Joe, the totalitarian ruler of the Citadel, celebrates an unholy mass by appearing upon a balcony high above his emaciated subjects and raining rations of water in one great flood down over their heads, forcing them to crawl over one another and push each other out of the way to catch the water in their mouths and in any makeshift bowl or cup they have handy. He tells them that too much water is no good for them, and not to get addicted to it. If they become too dependent upon water, it is a sign of their weak character. The subjugated peoples fall over themselves thanking Joe for the water with the same gratitude that the Israelites expressed, thanking their God for the manna from Heaven. The implied lesson is that Joe’s subjects must never challenge his rule or he will be justly angry—as Gods are wont to become—and the water tap will suddenly find itself shut off. Indeed, in the Arnold Schwarzenegger action film Total Recall (1990), the Ur-Fascist ruler of the Earth colony on Mars, corporate CEO and Governor Vilos Cohaagen (Ronny Cox) retaliates against the terrorist insurgents who seek to unseat him by shutting off all the breathable oxygen in the domed neighborhoods he knows are sheltering the rebels. When victory seems assured, “everyman” Messiah Douglas Quaid (Schwarzenegger) yells, “Come on, Cohaagen! You got what you want. Give these people air!” Cohaagen considers the request for a moment and takes another look at the surveillance camera footage of prostitutes, alcoholics, tourists, and members of the working classes suffocating on the floors of the red-light district Venusville. “Fuck ’em,” Cohaagen declares, and stops watching the surveillance footage. Characters such as these are portrayed as evil in the movies, but their real-life analogues are more often greeted with respect and are held aloft as models of financial and personal success that everyone should emulate.\n\nAmerican filmgoers are accustomed to rooting against genre villains such as Cohaagen or President Snow in The Hunger Games or Lex Luthor in Batman v Superman (2016). However, they are more likely to praise, emulate, and vote for the real-world analogues of such figures. Part of our fealty to such figures comes from a lack of knowledge of history. Another part comes from the seductive way figures such as these present themselves in the mass media to an impoverished, uneducated, desperate public. Octavia Butler’s prophetic 1998 book Parable of the Talents depicts charismatic Texas Senator Andrew Steele Jarret, who mobilizes the racist vote and becomes President of the United States by promising to “Make America Great Again.” The following passage from Butler’s novel is an excerpt from the personal journal of her heroine, Lauren, dated September 26, 2032:\n\n[Jarret] wants to take us all back to some magical time when everyone believed in the same God, worshipped him in the same way, and understood that their safety in the universe depended on completing the same religious rituals and stomping anyone who was different. There was never such a time in this country. But these days when more than half the people in the country can’t read at all, history is just one more vast unknown to them. Jarret supporters have been known, now and then, to form mobs and burn people at the stake for being witches. Witches! In 2032! A witch, in their view, tends to be a Moslem, a Jew, a Hindu, a Buddhist, or, in some parts of the country, a Mormon, a Jehovah’s Witness, or even a Catholic. … Jarret condemns the burnings, but does so in such mild language that his people are free to hear what they want to hear. As for the beatings, the tarring and feathering, and the destruction of “heathen houses of devil-worship,” he has a simple answer: “Join us! Our doors are open to every nationality, every race! Leave your sinful past behind, and become one of us. Help us to make America great again.” He’s had notable success with this carrot-and-stick approach. Join us and thrive, or whatever happens to you as a result of your own sinful stubbornness is your problem …\n\nJarret … is a big, handsome, black-haired man with deep, clear blue eyes that seduce people and hold them. He has a voice that’s a whole-body experience. … It seems inevitable that people who can’t read are going to lean more toward judging candidates on the way they look and sound than on what they claim they stand for. Even people who can read and are educated are apt to pay more attention to good looks and seductive lies than they should.6\n\nImmediately following Donald Trump’s election to the presidency of the United States, George Orwell’s 1984 became an overnight bestseller again on Amazon.com. However, Nigerian American fantasy writer Nnedi Okorafor observed that, in many respects, Octavia Butler is the author who most accurately predicted Trump’s America, not Orwell. “After everything that happened, I’m not reading 1984, I’m not reading Fahrenheit 451, I’m not reading The Handmaid’s Tale. I’m reading Parable of the Sower [and Parable of the Talents] by Octavia Butler. I feel like if we’re looking for any answers or where we’re going, it’s definitely in Octavia’s work,” said Okorafor.7\n\nThe passage from Parable of the Talents quoted above is insightful in its depiction of the poor and desperate looking for any easily visible peg on which to hang their hopes for survival, no matter how inappropriate. Indeed, as Butler demonstrates, support for fictional characters such as Jarret and their real-life analogues might be explained away by media lionization fueling the fears of a desperate and uneducated public looking for a Messiah figure to save them. However, the historical one-to-one-corollary between divine gods and human demagogues is worth exploring. After all, in the real world, what figure is closer to God the Father than the successful corporate CEO? As theologian and activist Joerg Rieger observed in Religion, Theology, and Class: Fresh Engagements After a Long Silence (2013):\n\nFrom the very beginning, Christian images of God’s power … [were informed by the example of political power and wealth evident in] the Roman Empire. Consequently, many theological notions of God as king were informed by the power of the upper classes. … When contemporary Christians talk of God’s power, the power of the CEO of a successful corporation is often what is envisioned. When this definition of power is taken for granted, as it often is, the discussion is confined to an endorsement of such a God by people who consider themselves theists or a rejection by others who claim to be atheists.\n\nYet what if God’s power were not defined in terms of the ruling class but of the working class? The question is not as odd as it may sound, as the God in the biblical traditions is often described as a worker: in the second Creation account in Genesis 2:4–25, God crafts the human being out of clay and plants a garden. In the creation stories of the Psalms, God’s labor is celebrated (Psalm 8:3 describes the heavens as the work of God’s fingers, in Psalm 65:9, God is said to water the earth, etc.). And in the first creation account in Genesis, God is said to establish what in capitalist societies was established only by unionized workers: a day of rest after several days of work—that is, the weekend.8\n\nJoerg Rieger’s theological and political justification for a more egalitarian conception of Christianity is, indeed, compelling. However, it would be understandable if the imperial legacies of Christianity and its historic use as a weapon of the powerful against the weak would make many in our current generation reluctant to strive to reclaim a faith that has been so tainted—even if C. S. Lewis and Pope Francis effectively model how a more loving Christianity might be reclaimed from a more Dominionist form of Christianity. Instead of reforming the old, patriarchal religions, some modern thinkers might be more inclined to advocate the invention of new religions for a new time—and the invention of more female-centric religions to challenge the patriarchy. Octavia Butler dramatizes just such an enterprise in 1993’s Parable of the Sower.\n\nOne of the central themes of Butler’s book is the use of religion as a means of responding to periods of extreme personal and social crisis. Her heroine, Lauren, copes with tragedy through creating a new religion called Earthseed that is predicated on the notion that God is the greatest force in the universe: change. Change shapes humanity, and humanity shapes change. As Lauren’s lover Bankole explains, the religion is pseudo-Buddhist and pseudo-Deist in its conception of God and in her refusal to provide any strong sense of God (or “Change”) as personal, mystical, or Messianic. Derivative or not, Lauren conceived of Earthseed as a commonsense faith and reflection of her direct experience of the real world. In some respects, she is following Ralph Waldo Emerson’s call to develop her own relationship to Nature and the Divine through her sense perceptions, rather than have these relationships mediated through texts written by dead prophets. Her enterprise is a classically American transcendentalist one.\n\nIn the first book of the incomplete Parable trilogy, Lauren uses Earthseed as a tool to boost the morale of the refugees in her charge during their Exodus-like journey to a new home. The minister’s daughter aids several lost souls during the book, and the group is notable for its inclusiveness. Lauren offers help to people from a wide variety of ages and races, and a balanced mix of men and women are present. Notably, among those she takes under her wing are former prostitutes and women who have been raped, including one of the widows of a slain, upper-middle-class polygamist; a married female servant of a wealthy man (whose sympathetic wife snuck her out of the house in time to prevent the servant’s rape); and a preteen girl who had been a nightly victim of incest by a charismatic relative held blameless by the rest of the family. When Lauren and her followers settle on Bankole’s family plot for a destination at the end of the novel, they begin planting the roots of a new kind of humane, matriarchal, agrarian community there called Acorn. While some of Lauren’s flock doubt that her vision of a better future will come to anything but death and disaster, Lauren chooses to believe that Earthseed will be the faith that binds them together despite the hardships they will face in the future—and do face in the sequel, Parable of the Talents. Certainly, the sense of solidarity the group develops helps them stand together in the face of overwhelming challenges from a hostile environment populated by murderous bands of white supremacists, drug addicts, and cannibals.\n\n(It is important to note here that, even though Butler died before writing her planned third novel, the second book has a strong ending and offers a closer that makes a third novel seem, in many respects, unnecessary. Therefore, no one should be discouraged from reading the two extant books solely because the third doesn’t exist.)\n\nIn the first Parable book, Lauren flees a world overrun with the sort of drug-addled, murderous, cultist villains one might find in a Mad Max film, and attempts to found a new society that is safe for women to live and thrive in. Improbably, since it is a well-directed action movie instead of a literary work like Parable of the Sower, the fourth film in the Australian, postapocalyptic Mad Max series, Fury Road (2015), has a similar “story”: Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron) liberates the Five Wives of the water-hoarding Ur-Fascist Immorten Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne), unchaining them from their chastity belts and driving them across perilous desert in an armored oil tanker to take shelter with the Vulvalini, a community of women she had been taken from years ago. Fury Road and Parable of the Sower make an odd pairing, but the thematic similarities between the two are significant.\n\nWomen as Victims and Heroes in the Mad Max Series\n\nThe first Mad Max film (1979), co-written and directed by George Miller, was a science fiction car chase Ozploitation notable for the way it seemed to fit into the mold of the successful Roger Corman B-movie Death Race 2000 (1975) and took some cues from the satirical British comic book character Judge Dredd (whose first appearance was in the second issue of the periodical 2000 AD in 1977). Still more notably, Mad Max helped launch lead actor Mel Gibson to international stardom, and spawned the sequels The Road Warrior (1981) and Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome (1985). The first film is about a blood feud between Australian highway patrol officer Max Rockatansky (Gibson) and a biker gang called the Acolytes—a freakish assemblage of psychotic figures dressed in sadomasochistic, tribal, and punk clothing, who appear devoid of all humanity. The Acolytes spend their days terrorizing the small-town communities found dotting the highway. Max and his peers are among the few remaining vestiges of law and order left in the region, and their ability to control the Acolytes gradually slips away. In a humane segment in an otherwise brutal film, Max’s partner Goose (Steve Bisley) comforts a woman that the Acolytes have raped (Kim Sullivan), speaking to her in soothing tones, offering her help, and deferring to her at all turns to help her recover a sense of agency. Goose vows to bring her brutalizers to justice, but the system begins to unravel even as he pursues a by-the-book form of justice; he is unable to make arrests permanent or see prosecutions turn into convictions. After the Acolytes murder Goose and run over Max’s wife and child, Max hunts down and kills the gang members in revenge and leaves society behind to explore the Australian outback in his black 1973 XB GT Ford Falcon Coupe.\n\nDiscussing the film in a recent interview, Gibson explained, “This was the first one of those post-apocalyptic films where you saw the decay and damage of world conflagration and the aftermath, so it was a new notion. It was a revenge story set in a world that was hostile, but underneath it was a scary classic tale that has been told and retold ever since they were painting things on caves and talking across a fire and eating semi-cooked meat on their haunches. … It had something mythic at its core that audiences responded to. It is a harbinger of what is to come if we keep destroying our world. We’ll see where we end up—with some pretty lawless characters.”9\n\nThe film was not successful in the United States, but Mad Max 2 was, partly because it had a larger budget, more action, and was marketed as if it were the first film in a new series; it was renamed The Road Warrior in the United States. While the circumstances of society’s unraveling—and the extent to which human civilization has “ended”—was left unclear in the first film, The Road Warrior begins with a narrator offering a vague, mythic sense of post-apocalyptic historical context that appears to describe a civilization-ending war between the United States and the Soviet Union tied to the rapid depletion of the world’s remaining oil resources. The narrator is one of many residents of a small, fortified oil refinery settlement whom Max reluctantly saves from being wiped out by a roving band of pirates led by Lord Humungus (Kjell Nilsson). The plot concerns Max’s efforts to get the refinery workers and the oil past the pirates to a new settlement, where they will one day become the Great Northern Tribe. At the start of the film, Max is too wounded from the recent loss of his family to consider himself a hero. He comes across and captures a Gyro Captain (Bruce Spence), who leads him to the oil refinery. Max keeps his distance from the settlement, interested in seeing how he can refuel his car, but unwilling to get too close. He knows that the pirates stand between him and the refinery. From their vantage point, Max and the Gyro Captain witness two refinery workers making a vain attempt to leave the settlement. Humongus’s men set upon them, raping and murdering the woman and leaving the man for dead. As Max watches, his sympathies are with the woman, who reminds him of both his wife and the other female victims of the Acolytes. For his part, the Gyro Captain relates to the rapists, and wishes that he were getting the “sex” that they were getting. He laments that he doesn’t have a “clean woman” of his own and is morally outraged when the rapists kill their victim because he feels that a sex object has been wasted. The rest of the film includes as a comic subplot the Gyro Captain’s quest to land himself a “clean woman,” and he manages to find one in the end—which is unfortunate given his appalling tendency to empathize with rapists instead of with their victims.\n\nIn “Rape Scenes Aren’t Just Awful. They’re Lazy Writing,” (June 30, 2015), WIRED columnist Laura Hudson lists a series of ways in which the increasingly frequent depictions of rape in popular culture misunderstand what rape is and seem to justify its being committed. She is particularly concerned with moments when premium channel cable shows such as Game of Thrones sometimes blur the lines of what constitutes rape when “rape is rape.” As she observes:\n\nOne of the reasons why rape remains so terrifyingly pervasive is far too often, no one is willing to call it what it is. We’ve generally agreed as a culture that rape is bad, but since people want to continue to commit (and excuse) rape, they resolve that cognitive dissonance by defining rape in incredibly narrow ways that distance it from themselves and the people they know. Behold the rise of euphemisms like “gray rape” and “rape rape” (aka “real” rape).\n\nA small but terrifying study conducted on college-age males earlier this year found that around one in three men said they would be willing to rape a woman if there were no consequences—but only if you didn’t call it “rape.” For these men, the resistance or disinterest of women was viewed as insincere or inconsequential, and the use of force or coercion was seen as either acceptable, or a nebulous “gray” area—but not “rape rape.” That’s why definitions of rape and consent are so crucially important: They literally encourage people to commit acts of rape by redefining them into social acceptability. Simply put, any form of media that reinforces any of these ideas actively enables sexual assault.10\n\nAlso, Hudson explains, rape presented in popular narratives should not be depicted as sexy; should not have to be graphically depicted for the audience to believe it has occurred; and should not be considered shorthand for mature, edgy, or deep storytelling (especially since it is often just the opposite). She adds that female rape victims do not exist solely to motivate men to revenge; rape is not just for women; and not all rapists are mustache-twirling villains, but most often acquaintances, friends of the victim, or romantic partners of the victim.\n\nHudson concludes by observing, “Yes, there are stories about rape that are worth telling. But without extensive research into the problems, stereotypes, and struggles that rape survivors face—including what makes sexual assault different from other forms of violence—it’s too easy for fictional depictions to contribute to those issues rather than combat them. With so many other narrative tools out there, using sexual assault is almost always unnecessary. There are better ways to tell nearly any story, so why use the one that tends to be both the laziest and the most harmful?”11\n\nBy Hudson’s standards, the depiction of rape in the Mad Max series is deeply problematic, especially in The Road Warrior. Rape is one of the central motifs of Mad Max, but the suffering of women is used more as a moral justification for Max’s acts of violent aggression against the bikers than it is to tell the story of female exploitation in a postapocalyptic patriarchy. The pain the women experience firsthand is given secondary consideration to the pain that their suffering causes Max vicariously. Their stories become his Story. In this context, what makes Fury Road so interesting is that, for the first time in the series, the women who are brutalized by the inhuman gangs of men who rule the highways are placed front and center and Max is sidelined. For the first time, their experiences of subjugation, vengeance, and liberation are presented as their Story, and Max is brought along for the ride as a witness and male ally. Both he and the filmgoer now know that the women’s story is their own, and Max’s story is of secondary import.\n\nSince the male chauvinist series star Mel Gibson and the Mad Max series are popular with Men’s Rights Activists (MRAs), the recasting of Max (now Tom Hardy) and the displacement of the hero in favor of Furiosa in Fury Road caused a stir in online forums, with MRAs seeing the shift in principal viewpoint character in this installment of the series as further proof of the unwanted female and multiethnic takeover of the science fiction genre. On the flip side, while the plot was feminist, several critics were quick to point out that Immorten Joe’s fugitive Five Wives were all sexy in an undernourished, “lingerie catalogue model” way. In these respects, one might think the film was calculated to please no one: a car chase movie and rape revenge narrative awash in blood-soaked masculine ideals of glorious combat and heroism, yet one that attempts to foreground certain ideas of feminism and critiques of Ur-Fascist culture in unsubtle ways. Improbably, the film has been embraced by critics and fans, dubbed one of the best action films ever made, and was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Picture in 2016.\n\nFor all the jokes made at the expense of the sidelined Max character, he is far from inessential. He begins the film so damaged from his experiences in the previous movies, and from being tortured and enslaved in the Citadel at the start of the film, that he is not initially willing to aid Furiosa in her escape efforts. In fact, he is willing to abandon her and the other refugees—including one visibly pregnant woman, the Splendid Angharad (Rosie Huntington-Whiteley)—to die in the desert. However, circumstances compel Max to reconsider his position and he reluctantly allies with Furiosa because he fears Joe more than he dislikes the idea of bearing the responsibility of aiding refugees. Once he finds himself caught up in their escape plan, he rapidly becomes emotionally involved in their plight and regains his humanity as his sympathy for the women grows. Max rediscovers the empathy for women that he felt for victimized women in the previous films. The chase they lead Joe and the battles they fight are so intense that Max and Furiosa develop first a wary and battlefield-forged alliance, then mutual respect, then, ultimately, a genuine Platonic affection for one another. During their escape, Furiosa and the Five “Wives” (or “Breeders”) benefit from Max’s help. He offers key advice. And yet, they do not need him to ride in like a white knight to save them. His presence is also instructive to the males in the audience—be careful whom you relate to. As a male, one might expect Max to show more sympathy for Immorten Joe, but he allies himself with Furiosa early on and never rethinks or regrets the decision. Indeed, the film features another, still more dramatic redemption story. One of Joe’s most loyal subjects, Nux, is willing to go to his death a hero to help Joe reclaim his brides. When he fails in this task and is abjured by Joe, Nux is shocked into a realization that Joe is not the Godlike figure he thought Joe was, and that if he died fighting for Joe, he would not find himself in Valhalla as promised. Shaken free of the Ur-Fascist ideology Joe had brainwashed him in, Nux helps Furiosa and the others escape. Like Max, Nux sides against the male oppressor and with the women, and is not depicted as a traitor to his gender, but as a champion of freedom. This was a message that, for some reason, offended Men’s Rights Activists. Perhaps that fact should not be remotely surprising. Nevertheless, it is more than a little disappointing.\n\nIn one of the darkest moments of the film, Furiosa reaches her destination, finds the last few remaining Vulvalini, and realizes that the green paradise she remembered as a child has since withered and died because of climate change. The haven she sought when escaping the Citadel was gone. When she recovers from the shock, she and Max realize that what they need to do is not try to find a new, mythical home, but claim the Citadel for themselves, unseat Joe, and give the water and the greenery within its walls over to Joe’s repressed subjects. They turn about and race home, confronting Joe directly on the road back, killing him and his musclebound son and destroying his mobile army. When they arrive at the Citadel with the body of Joe strapped to the hood of Max’s car, Joe’s remaining lieutenants surrender and hand control of the Citadel over to Furiosa. Since she has experienced suffering, and knows compassion, she will be a benign ruler. She will not become another Ur-Fascist ruler withholding water from the common people. For his part, Max is glad to see Furiosa succeed, but the Citadel is not his home, so he returns to his car to resume his wanderings across the Outback.\n\nThe pitched battle over freedom for women and for clean drinking water for citizens has resonance in recent years. The women’s rights angle resonates in the era of the war on women’s reproductive rights, as well as their rights to receive equal pay and family leave, breastfeed outside the home, be believed when they report sexual abuse, wear yoga pants (or anything flattering to their figures, for that matter), and post cultural criticism of video games on YouTube. Meanwhile, the horrors of the Flint and Detroit, Michigan, water wars; the California drought and its attendant battle between the government and the Nestle corporations for control of the remaining water supply, and the 2016 EPA revelation that hydraulic fracturing poisons local water supplies makes the hoarding and liberating of water motif evocative.\n\nThose interested in exploring greater contemporary cultural context for dystopian climate fiction such as Fury Road should consider consulting the following studies: The Next American Revolution: Sustainable Activism for the Twenty-First Century (2012) by Grace Lee Boggs and Scott Kurashige; This Is an Uprising: How Nonviolent Revolt Is Shaping the Twenty-First Century (2016) by Mark Engler and Paul Engler; and We the People: Stories From the Community Rights Movement in the United States (2016) by Thomas Linzey and Anneke Campbell. For histories of similar conflicts, most provocatively in the heart of Oklahoma, read The Green Corn Rebellion (2010) by William Cunningham; The Color of the Land: Race, Nation, and the Politics of Land Ownership in Oklahoma, 1832–1929 (2010) by David A. Chang; and Agrarian Socialism in America: Marx, Jefferson, and Jesus in the Oklahoma Countryside, 1904–1920 (2002) by Jim Bissett.\n\nAs well reviewed as Snowpiercer, Parable of the Sower, and Mad Max: Fury Road have been, none has enjoyed the vast mainstream popularity of The Hunger Games or been accorded the smallest percentage of its cultural impact. The following chapter considers The Hunger Games saga in detail, the species of populist rebellion against Ur-Fascism that it depicts, and the Tolkien-like Roman Catholic sensibilities underpinning its narrative."
