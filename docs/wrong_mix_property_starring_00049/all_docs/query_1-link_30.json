        "text": "The Gospel: After Max avenges his family’s murder, he roams the Australian wasteland searching for food and oil. Gangs of vicious marauders litter the environment and prey on the weak. When Max discovers an oil refinery and a peaceful community, he originally plans to steal the oil. However, he agrees to help the people fight off Lord Humungus (Kjell Nilsson) and his band of thugs in exchange for precious petroleum.\n\nWhy It's Worth The Drive: George Miller and Mel Gibson both return for Mad Max 2, AKA The Road Warrior. This time around, Miller received a bigger budget, and the car chases and explosions are even more spectacular and groundbreaking. Many cinephiles and critics consider this one of the best sequels ever made. The post-apocalyptic world is grim material, and Max the grieving husband and father becomes the classic movie loner.\n\nThe picture also has humanity. Max thinks he can roam around in his car with just his dog at his side, but in the end, the ex-cop in him feels a responsibility to help other people. It’s that humanity that separates Mad Max 2 from other action movies. How can a man grow when faced with a devastating post-apocalyptic world? The sequel has a beating heart, though you may need to push over deceased bodies to feel it.\n\nIn 1982, Miller explained to The New York Times the importance of making the movie work on an emotional level:\n\nI certainly don't want this film to be seen purely as an escapist fantasy. That is all there, sure, but a movie that only stimulates you on that basic emotional level is not very effective.\n\nThis is a mythological tale, and Max takes a journey and learns some things about himself during it. You can compare it to a western - I grew up on them and they are very important to me - but I think this kind of story is told over again in many cultures. Road Warrior is a hybrid: part Hollywood, part samurai, part European art film.\n\nChrome Moment: The Mad Max franchise is littered with memorable villains. However, Mad Max 2’s Lord Humungus might be the most unforgettable. With his metal hockey goalie mask, black leather, and studded jock strap, the look isn't far from what one might see in an extreme porn flick.\n\nLord Humungus is ruthless, but has an air of calmness. His actions may be violent and barbaric, but his demeanor remains even-keeled. Like any great villain, he wants total control and power. He commands his underlings with charm and esoteric speeches, and his “just walk away” speech is one of the franchise's most-quoted monologues:\n\nThere has been too much violence, too much pain. None here are without sin. But I have an honorable compromise. Just walk away. Give me the pump, the oil, the gasoline, and the whole compound, and I’ll spare your lives. Just walk away; I will give you safe passage in the wasteland. Just walk away and there will be an end to the horror.\n\nThe Gospel: Thirty years after Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome, George Miller returned to helm the film’s fourth installment, Mad Max: Fury Road. In the hit film, Tom Hardy replaces Mel Gibson as Max Rockatansky. There isn’t a clear timeline for the movies, so Fury Road does not necessarily come after the other three.\n\nIn the film, a grieving Max, whose wife and child have been murdered, roams the barren, post-apocalyptic desert. He spars with Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron), a driver/lieutenant for the warlord Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne). Furiosa turns on the warlord by sneaking out the five young women forced to be his wives. She hopes to take them to freedom in her homeland, The Green Place. Max, ever the loner, reluctantly joins forces with Furiosa. A race across the desert ensues as Furiosa and Max try to outrun Immortan Joe and his War Boys.\n\nWhy It's Worth The Drive: Like the first film in the franchise, Fury Road has limited dialogue. The film didn't even have a screenplay - just elaborate storyboards. But, as the cliché goes, a picture is worth a thousand words. Despite the paucity of conversation, Fury Road was nominated for 10 Academy Awards and won six. As an additional compliment, critics on Rotten Tomatoes gave Fury Road a 97% rating.\n\nMiller's film is a high-octane visceral experience, in which viewers become engrossed in the action. Critic Jennifer Bisset named Fury Road among the best movie of the 2010s, explaining:\n\nThe entire movie takes place over one absolutely bonkers chase sequence. Its cinematic stats are jaw-dropping: Miller used 3,500 storyboards and took 480 hours of raw footage. He overcame a decade of roadblocks - recasting, location changes and creative resets (he explored the possibility of a 3D live-action version) - before achieving high-octane imaginative insanity.\n\nChrome Moment: Theron shaved her flowing blond locks to play the one-armed warrior Imperator Furiosa. In a post-apocalyptic world with little hope, the lieutenant manages to be selfless and risk her life to save Immortan Joe's five wives. The Academy Award winner commands the screen and takes no prisoners. Max’s name is in the title, but Furiosa and the other women are the movie's true heroes.\n\nAs critic Gabrielle Rivera wrote:\n\nCharlize Theron delivers a captivating, challenging performance as Furiosa, arguably her best since Monster, as she barrels across the desert in a souped-up war rig to carry five angelic, badass women to a search for hope. Those women each embody their own strength and grace, overcoming fear and internalized misogyny to create a vision for a new life. Instead of forming a chorus of interchangeable former sex slaves, they are five women with their own goals, struggles and connections to each other and other characters.\n\nThe Gospel: In 1979, director and co-screenwriter George Miller introduced the cinema world to Max Rockatansky (Mel Gibson). The laconic hero is an ex-cop turned vigilante intent on seeking revenge for the murder of his wife and son by a motorcycle gang.\n\nThe Australian film is set in a barren, post-apocalyptic, dystopian world. Society has collapsed, and few resources are left. Murderous gangs fight for whatever remains in a landscape filled with war and hunger. If you're looking for sunshine, rainbows, and happy endings - it's best to steer clear of Mad Max.\n\nWhy It's Worth The Drive: Miller’s action film was innovative for its time. The movie world had not seen many desolate post-apocalyptic wastelands. Nor had they seen a hero like Max, which served as Gibson’s breakout film role. Miller’s film is visually stunning, but the action sequences really make it stand out. Mad Max is filled with intense car chases, explosions, stunts, and plenty of bare-knuckled fight scenes. It’s hard to believe Miller could do so much with just a $400,000 budget.\n\nThe film went on to earn $100 million worldwide. It even held the Guinness World Record for the most profitable film until The Blair Witch Project broke the record in 1999. Mad Max set the bar for the dystopian genre movies that followed and also had a massive impact on popular culture.\n\nChrome Moment: No conversation about Mad Max can end without mentioning the cars. The most famous one in the entire franchise (and perhaps of any film) is the all-black V8 Interceptor, which Max drives in the original installment and two other movies. The vehicle, also known as the Pursuit Special, is based on the 1973 Ford Falcon XB GT Coupe. The 600-horsepower car is dangled in front of Max as a bribe to stay on the police force. However, when his wife and son are killed, he steals the Interceptor to seek his deadly revenge.\n\nThe Gospel: In the franchise’s third installment, Max finds himself in Bartertown, a trading/market locale ruled by the tyrannical Aunty Entity (Tina Turner). He strikes a deal with her to get his stolen car back by agreeing to fight The Blaster (Paul Larsson) in the Thunderdome, where men spar to the death.\n\nMax shows mercy to Blaster instead of killing him, and Aunty Entity exiles them to the desert to die. A community of feral children - who live at an oasis without the help of adults - offer Max assistance. However, they're waiting to be saved and hope Max is the hero they need.\n\nWhy It's Worth The Drive: This was Gibson’s last Mad Max movie. Armed with a $10 million budget, George Miller (with the help of co-director George Ogilvie) made the stunts and action sequences even bigger and more spectacular than the previous films. Thunderdome takes place several years after Mad Max 2. Petroleum and other vital supplies are gone. Bartertown is powered by pigs and their waste - a gassy affair that adds some levity to the movie's bleakness.\n\nPerhaps the most impressive area in the film is Miller’s attention to detail in creating the landscape and feel of the post-apocalyptic world. Critic reviews were mixed for Thunderdome; however, Roger Ebert thought it was even better than the first two:\n\nTina Turner herself lives far above the masses in a bird-nest throne room perched high overhead. And as Mad Max first visits Turner's sky palace, I began to realize how completely the director, George Miller, had imagined this future world. It has the crowding and the variety of a movie crossroads, but it also has a riot of hairstyles and costume design, as if these desperate creatures could pause from the daily struggle for survival only long enough to invent new punk fashions.\n\nAfter the clothes, the hair, the crowding, the incessant activity, the spendthrift way in which Miller fills his screen with throwaway details, Bartertown becomes much more than a movie set - it's an astounding address of the imagination, a place as real as Bogart's Casablanca or Orson Welles' Xanadu or the Vienna of The Third Man.\n\nChrome Moment: Turner doesn’t have many credits in her filmography, but her performance as a charismatic and powerful autocrat in Thunderdome is forever sketched into the minds of everyone who saw the movie. Aunty Entity originally saw Bartertown as a way to help rebuild civilization by allowing people to trade for things they needed. Unfortunately, like many leaders, she gets drunk with power and becomes a despot.\n\nTurner did not act in another movie after Thunderdome. Before it came out, she resurrected her singing career with the release of her fifth solo album, Private Dancer, in 1984, which became a multi-platinum hit. She also sang the hit song \"We Don't Need Another Hero (Thunderdome)\" for the film's soundtrack.\n\nFollowing Turner’s passing in 2023, Miller penned a remembrance of her, highlighting why he knew she would be perfect for the role of Aunty Entity. He wrote:\n\nWhen we made Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome, I knew her music like everyone else, but it was her persona that drew me to her, particularly for the role of Aunty Entity. I knew where the music came from, where her power came from. In this Mad Max wasteland, anyone who survives, let alone becomes a dominant force, has had to survive a lot of things that would normally diminish a person. Everyone time we talked about Aunty Entity, as we were writing, we would say: “Oh, someone like Tina Turner.” She was the only person we could think of. Sure enough, she was the only person we ever asked.\n\nThe Gospel: Set before the events of Mad Max: Fury Road, director George Miller returns fans to the world of the Wasteland with Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga. The prequel follows in the footsteps of Imperator Furiosa, now played by Anya Taylor-Joy.\n\nIn this epic tale, moviegoers watch the evolution of one of the most formidable allies Max Rockatansky ever encountered. A Mad Max film without Mad Max, the story follows Furiosa from her kidnapping from her idyllic childhood home in the Green Place to a barren desert wilderness where she meets the false messiah-turned-warlord Dementus, played with absolute zeal and gusto by Chris Hemsworth.\n\nAccording to Miller, Furiosa was necessary to the evolution of the Mad Max saga. When creating Fury Road, he realized that Max was not the only hero of the story:\n\nIn the case of Fury Road, I thought, ‘What if the MacGuffin, the thing everyone is chasing, were human?’ And that led to the wives being stolen from the warlord. And it couldn’t be a man taking the wives because that would be a different story. It would have to be a woman.\n\nWhy It's Worth The Drive: The trials and tribulations of Furiosa, her story of lost love and limbs, and her ability to overcome the many obstacles placed in her path provide not just a great narrative within the Mad Max world, but also blend elements from all the Road Warrior movies together. Furiosa's story is one of great loss, but also of adaptation to a new, brutal atmosphere where she flourishes despite hardships. The set up is a return to form for the series, which saw a similar evolution in the character of Max in the first two film. But Furiosa also includes the fast-paced, high-octane action pieces that made audiences of Fury Road gasp in shock and awe.\n\nTaylor-Joy completely embodies the role of Furiosa in mind and spirit. Forever changed by all she has lost and made fierce by what she has survived, Furiosa is the audience's guide for this new world order, just as Max was in previous installments. From her childhood to her time in the Citadel, Furiosa is an unflinching look at the origin of a warrior.\n\nMiller revealed that Taylor-Joy was chosen not just because of her impressive resume and experience, but that she shared a similar history to previous Furiosa, Charlize Theron:\n\nI learned that she was somebody who is very, very disciplined, and she’s very young She was a ballet dancer, Charlize was a ballet dancer. I worked on Happy Feet with a lot of brilliant dancers, and I understand the physical discipline, as well as the emotional discipline they have. So, all of that led to Anya being Furiosa.\n\nChrome Moment: The pure grit and determination that Taylor-Joy injects into Furiosa is a sight to behold. Born to a society of female warriors, Furiosa's difficult journey teaches her how to become a fighter before she can become a champion. Her ability to transition from moments of heartbreaking drama to neck-breaking action sequences is a talent that few can muster.\n\nIn an interview, Miller explained that he might have plans for Furiosa after her conquest of the Citadel:\n\nI’ve often speculated when we see Furiosa go up to the Citadel on that platform at the very end [of Fury Road] and nod goodbye to Max who wanders to the Wasteland... 'What does she do, sitting up at the top of the dominant hierarchy? Does she fall into the trap that most revolutionaries do?' You know, yesterday’s hero becomes tomorrow’s tyrant, which is classic in storytelling."
