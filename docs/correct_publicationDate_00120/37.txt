The Iron Dragon’s Daughter is the first in a series that combines cyberpunk with dystopic fantasy. Jane is a changeling who is trapped in a factory run by aristocratic high elves. The factory puts underage people to work and Jane is the only human. They are building cybernetic, magical dragons that are weaponized for war. The book takes place against a dystopic mindscape of dark challenges and class struggles. The dragon Melanchton is tempting Jane with the promise of freedom that will lead her into a daring escape. An escape that will shake the foundations of existence.

Swanwick’s Nebula award-winning novel was Stations of the Tide. The Jubilee Tides are a once-in-two-centuries cataclysm that threaten to drown the continents of planet Miranda. That is the least of their worries though as their is an even greater catastrophe looming. The Bureau of Proscribed Technologies has sent someone to investigate and he finds that Gregorian has come, a genius renegade scientist and charismatic bush wizard. He plans to remake the world in his own evil image and to force whatever is in his way to bend to his will.
