        "text": "Swanwick, Michael; Dann, Jack; Davidson, Avram; Dozois, Gardner (authors) ; Broomhead, Ann A. ; Szczessuil, Timothy P. (editors)\n\nMoon Dogs\n\nRick Berry/Braid Media Arts. Framingham, MA: The NESFA Press 2000. First Edition. 409, [1], [1-ads] pages. Publisher's blue green cloth with pictorial dust jacket. A new copy in the publisher's slipcase. SIGNED on the front flyleaf by both Michael Swanwick (author, and Guest of Honor Boskone 37) and Rick Berry (Official Artist Boskone 37). Issued in a limited edition of 1000 copies, of which the 10 lettered A thru J and 175 numbered 1 through 175 are the autographed and slipcased state. The remaining 815 copies the trade state and are numbered 176 through 990. This copy (#126) is one of the 175 numbered autographed and slipcased copies with special endpapers. Fine / Fine. Cloth. [28065]\n\n\"Moon Dogs is the 2000 Boskone book by Guest of Honor Michael Swanwick. It is a sampling of his work, with seven stories, one play, six essays, and two speeches. Two of the stories, “Moon Dogs” and “Mickelrede,” are new, and “Moon Dogs” was been nominated for the 2001 Best Short Story Hugo!\n\nMichael Swanwick has given readings of the title story to general acclaim, and the NESFA Press is proud to make it available. “Mickelrede” is one of his posthumous collaborations with Avram Davidson, and gives an intriguing look into the creative process. His other such collaboration, “Vergil Magus: King Without Country,” is another chance for the reader to visit with the mage from The Phoenix and the Mirror.\n\nThe range of his fiction work is represented with the short novel Griffin’s Egg, and the award-winning play “The Dead.” Among the essays here are the hard-to-find “The Death of the Magus: Two Myths” and “The Hagiography of Saint Dozois,” and the bizarre tale of “Jane Swanwick and the Search for Identity.” His discussions of the SF field, “A User’s Guide to the Postmoderns” and “In the Tradition …,” are witty and insightful surveys—so much so that the former has even been pirated in countries around the world.\n\nHis collaboration with Jack Dann, “Ships” (in its first American publication), and two of his several collaborations with Gardner Dozois, “Ancestral Voices” and “The City of God,” are further demonstrations of the range of his fiction.\"\n\n\"Michael Swanwick is the Hugo, Nebula, World Fantasy, and Theodore Sturgeon Award winning author of many science fiction and fantasy novels, including In the Drift, The Iron Dragon's Daughter, Jack Faust, Stations of the Tide, and Vacuum Flowers.\" (Nesfa press)\n\nITEM SOLD"
