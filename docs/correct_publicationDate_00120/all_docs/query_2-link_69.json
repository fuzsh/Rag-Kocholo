Cabell’s books were Mark Twain’s chief reading in the great humorist’s declining years. Theodore Roosevelt received him at the White House. The occultist Aleister Crowley harried him with fan letters. H. L. Mencken was his advocate. Sinclair Lewis, accepting the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1930, mentioned him as one of a number of writers who might reasonably have won it.\n\nYet he died as good as forgotten.\n\nMICHAEL SWANWICK is author of the Hugo finalist Hope-in-the-Mist a monograph on the life and writings of of Hope Mirrlees (also an e-booke from Weightless Books). His novels include The Iron Dragon’s Daughter, Jack Faust, Stations of the Tide, and Chasing the Phoenix, and his short story collections include Gravity’s Angels, The Dog Said Bow-Wow, and Not So Much, Said the Cat (new from Tachyon).\n\nBARRY HUMPHRIES is an Australian National Treasure, known worldwide for creating the role of Dame Edna."
