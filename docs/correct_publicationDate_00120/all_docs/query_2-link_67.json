        "text": "I'd be interested to see if folks might be able to recommend me something which is a typical representation of a battle between the forces of Light and Dark. Something like Carnivale (the tv show) in which you have an avatar for the devil as well as an avatar for the forces of good. Something featuring an Anti-Christ come real for instance, and his greatest adversary.\n\nI suppose this can range from epic Fantasy ( Tolkien, Lawhead's Song of Albion) to urban fantasy, to post-apocalytic books (Swan Song, Acts of God trilogy). I don't really care about the genre in this case, it just has to be a cool, intriguing story, possibly something deep to really get into. Something serious though, not comic.\n\nI suppose you could say that lots of epic Fantasy is a version of Tolkien's struggle between light and dark but if recommend it only if you thought it was really strong. Maybe I should be looking into (aahhhh the dreaded horror) \"Christian fiction\"?\n\nIt's sort of like asking if we have any ocean water while we're standing on the beach, Mith.\n\nBut here's some you might like if you haven't read them already:\n\nSean Stewart -- \"Galveston\" -- not strictly God and the Devil, but sort of in the Carnivale mode and I think you'd like his style, set in Galveston, TX, which has become a magic zone of sorts.\n\nJames Blaylock -- \"All the Bells on Earth\" and \"The Last Coin\" -- two contemporary fantasies dealing with God and the Devil.\n\nTerry Pratchett & Neil Gaiman -- \"Good Omens\" -- This is a comic fantasy about the son of the Devil and the coming apocalypse.\n\nWayne Thomas Batson -- \"The Door Within\" -- haven't read this one yet, our member batguy's work, but Rob has reviewed it on the site. It's Christian-related horror-tinged fantasy.\n\nJerry Jay Carroll -- \"Top Dog\" and sequel \"Dog Eat Dog\" -- haven't read yet, but good rep, dark comic fantasy about those dealing with Christian Hell. (I think it's the Christian's hell if I remember right.)\n\nMichael Swanwick -- \"Jack Faust\" -- haven't read yet, Swanwick as you probably know a highly regarded sf writer who sometimes does fantasy stories.\n\nA bunch of the new supernatural fantasies I believe tackle the idea also. I think it's Keri Arthur who has a heroine who's made a pact with the Devil, but it might be somebody else.\n\nOf course, I know you're not asking only for Christian God-Devil set-ups, but those are the ones that first come to mind. Also maybe Tim Powers' \"Last Call\" which is about poker and Vegas, and gods and god incarnations -- also sort of a Carnivale feel to it.\n\nKatG said:\n\nWayne Thomas Batson -- \"The Door Within\" -- haven't read this one yet, our member batguy's work, but Rob has reviewed it on the site. It's Christian-related horror-tinged fantasy.\n\nThanks for the ref. KatG!\n\nMy trilogy, The Door Within Trilogy, is definitely a fantasy adventure based on the struggle between a clearcut light and dark side. The story pits the forces of the Noble King Eliam of Alleble against his predatory former successor, Paragor the Prince of Paragory. A young man named Aidan who enters The Realm where Glimpses dwell finds himself in the midst of this struggle.\n\nPM me if you have any questions.\n\n--WTB\n\nSomething wicked this way comes is alreayd on the wishlist, though I thought it was more of a horror tale than classic Light vs Dark.\n\nWhich is what The Exorcist is right? I know the film, a demon possesses a child and a priest tries to save her. Or is there more to it than that?\n\nI'll look into Black Easter, Galveston and the Blaylock books for certain.\n\nThanks everyone for your input\n\nMithfânion said:\n\nSomething wicked this way comes is alreayd on the wishlist, though I thought it was more of a horror tale than classic Light vs Dark.\n\nIt's possible that I'm not following what you mean by \"classic Light vs. Dark\" since it seems to me 'horror' in its various shades is often light vs. dark.\n\nWhich is what The Exorcist is right? I know the film, a demon possesses a child and a priest tries to save her. Or is there more to it than that?\n\nYup. By my lights, Light vs. Dark\n\nThough I'd accept the argument it's more light grey vs. deep black.\n\nNever have seen the movie, though, so I can't say what liberties were taken with the book.\n\nI'll look into Black Easter, Galveston and the Blaylock books for certain.\n\nThanks everyone for your input\n\nI need to look into Stewart and Blaylock, too, for that matter.\n\nRandy M."
