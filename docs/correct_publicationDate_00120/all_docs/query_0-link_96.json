        "text": "Triceratops Summer by Michael Swanwick\n\nSection: Experiments\n\nGenre: Science Fiction\n\nRating: 3.5/5 Rating\n\nWhy did the triceratops cross the road?\n\nAbout the author:\n\nMichael Swanwich is an American writer of novels and stories who has received the Hugo, Nebula, Theodore Sturgeon, and World Fantasy awards for his work. His stories have appeared in Omni, Penthouse, Amazing, Asimov‚Äôs Science Fiction Magazine, High Times, New Dimensions, Starlight, Universe, Full Spectrum, TriQuarterly, and elsewhere. Many have benn reprinted in year‚Äôs best anthologies, and translated into several foreign languages. His books include In the Drift, an Ace Special; Vacuum Flowers; Griffin‚Äôs Egg; Stations of the Tide; The Iron Dragon‚Äôs Daughter, a New York Times Notable Book; and Jack Faust. This story was first published by Amazon Shorts in 2005.\n\nWhen you see a time-travel story with a dinosaur in the title you would most likely expect the story to be about either humans going back in time and having to fight off/learn to live with dinosaurs, or that somehow the dinos came to the present and are now wreaking havoc and people either want to kill or protect them. That is not always the case though. Sometimes, dinosaurs are used a backdrop and tool for the author to tell their message.\n\nOur narrator is driving to work along with his neighbor, Gretta, when he sees off in the distance, a herd of triceratops. After gawking, and watching Gretta yell the creatures for making her late for work, a young man working for the Institute for Advanced Physics comes to ask to them to please be quite and try keep this a secret. The reason the triceratops are here was because of an incident down at the Institute.\n\nGretta, still in a rush, tricks the nervous you man into giving her his car so she leave and get to work. Our narrator kindly offers to drive him to a nearby bar so he may call for a ride. While at the bar, our narrator has conversation with the young man, whose name turn out to be Everett, and gets told some secret news. After this conversation, our narrator goes out to the bank, takes out a second mortgage, buys the biggest ring he can find for his wife, and says where ever she wants to, he can have her there tomorrow.\n\nEverything about this story circles around that conversation. The only information we have is that it ended with the narrator asking, ‚Äúhow long?‚Äù, and then with Everett replying, ‚Äúthree months‚Äù. Swanwick doesn‚Äôt directly reference that conversation afterwards, but based off of our narrator‚Äôs reactions after that convo, him and his wife‚Äôs actions later on, and somethings Everett says later, that conversation was clearly something life changing and top-secret. We don‚Äôt find out what was said in that conversation until the end of story, and personally, I couldn‚Äôt guess what it was until then. I won‚Äôt say what my theories were (because then you‚Äôd know what it isn‚Äôt), but when it was finally revealed, all of character‚Äôs actions made sense.\n\nAs you should have guessed, despite Everett‚Äôs wishes, the herd of roaming triceratops was not kept secret. As nice touch, I thought, was how Swanwick able to show varied the reactions to an event like this would be. Our narrator feels like a blue-collar average Joe, who has that ‚Äúwhoa, that‚Äôs cool‚Äù reaction, but it not overly shocked and awed; Gretta is the type who doesn‚Äôt give a damn about this these things, because all they are doing is causing inconveniences to her life; other people can‚Äôt help but pull up and start taking photos. Then as news of the of the triceratops spread, there is mass new and media, business looking to make a profit off them, and then even some of the triceratops being shipped off to zoos. It created just enough of picture that you see how the world was taking things outside of our narrator‚Äôs life.\n\nAnd for our narrator‚Äôs life. Well, that is where the simple and beautiful message of the story is hidden üôÇ\n\nSpolierific Speculations: (Highlight to read)\n\n‚äó‚äó‚äó\n\nMy theory was we have ‚Äúthree month‚Äù unlike the world blew up. That accident/incident at the institute, that caused the dinos to appear, I thought it was like melting down and was going to cause some time of nuclear explosions or something. Travel back in time to fix it, does seem like the obvious idea now though Lol\n\n‚äó‚äó‚äó\n\nIf your comments contains a spoiler, please type ‚ÄúSPOILER:‚Äù at the start of your comment to alert fellow readers and comments. Thanks!\n\nI thought Michael Swanwick has some great writing. Our narrator is great character, and his average-joe personality fits perfectly into the story. While it is a fairly simply story, it leaves behind an important message about life that I think people really over look nowadays, and Swanwick uses the time-travel and dinosaurs very efficiently to get that across.\n\nI have complained in the past about missing the connection to the message authors are trying to convey, or that time-travel wasn‚Äôt used properly to help get that message across, but here, there is no of that. Triceratops Summer is an excellent example of how to write a time-travel story where time-travel isn‚Äôt the main focus.\n\nBe sure to check out my fellow time-travelers‚Äô reviews!\n\nAlesha Escobar\n\nH.M.
