        "text": "Hope-in-the-Mist is the first book-length study of British author HOPE MIRRLEES, whom Virginia Woolf described as “her own heroine — capricious, exacting, exquisite, very learned, and beautifully dressed.” Raised in Scotland and Zululand, Mirrlees studied with the great classical scholar Jane Harrison and later lived with her in Paris and London. Mirrlees wrote one major poem, Paris (1920), the missing link between French avant-garde poetry and her friend T. S.\n\nEliot’sThe Waste Land (1922) ; her novel Lud-in-the-Mist is an acknowledged classic of fantastical literature. With a preface by NEIL GAIMAN. Hope-in-the-Mist also includes “ A Lexicon of Lud ” prepared by Michael Swanwick (first published in shorter form in The New York Review of Science Fiction in July 2005).\n\nMichael Swanwick is author of What Can Be Saved from the Wreckage ? (2007), a monograph on American author James Branch Cabell. His novels include The Iron Dragon’s Daughter, Jack Faust, Stations of the Tide, and Chasing the Phoenix, and his short story collections include Gravity’s Angels, The Dog Said Bow-Wow, and Not So Much, Said the Cat (new from Tachyon).\n\nNeil Gaiman has long been a champion of Lud-in-the-Mist.\n\nHope-in-the-Mist was first published 10 July 2009 at Readercon in Burlington, Massachusetts. The book was a finalist for the 2010 Hugo Award for best related work. An earlier version of Hope-in-the-Mist was published in the journal Foundation in 2003.\n\nPosted on Friday, July 8th, 2016 at 12:00 am."
