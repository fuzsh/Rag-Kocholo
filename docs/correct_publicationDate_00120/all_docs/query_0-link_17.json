        "text": "Hugo Award nominee 1998.\n\nThe Faust myth reinterpreted for the information age.\n\nAt the turn of the 16th century in the city of Wittenberg, Magister Faust is made an offer he cannot resist. If he accepts the offer he will know all there is to know, have answers to the mysteries of physics, astronomy and religion that have long frustrated him, but if he accepts he will also be condemning the human race to inevitable death. Or so says the demon, Mesphistopheles.\n\nWith the sharing of demonic knowledge comes the race for ever greater technological breakthroughs – within scant years the inventions of the twentieth century, the atrocity machines, are ready... Mesphistopheles' vision of the end of mankind is days away – a dictator is risen and the final nuclear confrontation looms."
