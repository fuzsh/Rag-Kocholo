        "text": "Moon Dogs is the 2000 Boskone book by Guest of Honor Michael Swanwick. It is a sampling of his work, with seven stories, one play, six essays, and two speeches. Two of the stories, Moon Dogs and Mickelrede, are new, and Moon Dogs was been nominated for the 2001 Best Short Story Hugo!\n\nMichael Swanwick has given readings of the title story to general acclaim, and the NESFA Press is proud to make it available. Mickelrede is one of his posthumous collaborations with Avram Davidson, and gives an intriguing look into the creative process. His other such collaboration, Vergil Magus: King Without Country, is another chance for the reader to visit with the mage from The Phoenix and the Mirror.\n\nThe range of his fiction work is represented with the short novel Griffins Egg, and the award-winning play The Dead. Among the essays here are the hard-to-find The Death of the Magus: Two Myths and The Hagiography of Saint Dozois, and the bizarre tale of Jane Swanwick and the Search for Identity. His discussions of the SF field, A Users Guide to the Postmoderns and In the Tradition , are witty and insightful surveys—so much so that the former has even been pirated in countries around the world.\n\nHis collaboration with Jack Dann, Ships (in its first American publication), and two of his several collaborations with Gardner Dozois, Ancestral Voices and The City of God, are further demonstrations of the range of his fiction.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nIntroduction: The Chameleon Eludes the Net by Gardner Dozois\n\nAuthor Profile\n\nMoon Dogs Hugo Nominee!\n\nThe Death of the Magus: Two Myths\n\nMickelrede by Michael Swanwick and Avram Davidson\n\nVergil Magus: King Without Country by Michael Swanwick and Avram Davidson\n\nJane Swanwick and the Search for Identity (article)\n\nThe Hagiography of Saint Dozois (article)\n\nAncestral Voices by Michael Swanwick and Gardner Dozois\n\nThe City of God by Michael Swanwick and Gardner Dozois\n\nThe Dead\n\nThey Fell Like Wheat\n\nA Users Guide to the Postmoderns (article)\n\nShips by Michael Swanwick and Jack Dann\n\nIn the Tradition\n\nGrowing Up in the Future (article)\n\nGriffins Egg\n\nWhat others have said about Michael Swanwick:\n\n\"Michael Swanwick is a true seer in the best sense of that word.\" —David Zindell\n\n\"An important writer whose work is contributing to the shape of things to come in our field.\" —Pat Cadigan\n\n\" grim, intense, and quite overwhelming a shock of the first order.\" —James Schellenberg\n\n\" seething, brain-bursting, all but indescribable.\" —Kirkus Reviews\n\nMichael Swanwick\n\nMichael Swanwick is the Hugo, Nebula, World Fantasy, and Theodore Sturgeon Award winning author of many science fiction and fantasy novels, including In the Drift, The Iron Dragon's Daughter, Jack Faust, Stations of the Tide, and Vacuum Flowers.\n\nDuring his writing career Swanwick has penned many fine shorter works, including several nominated for the Hugo Awards, and one of which, \"The Very Pulse of the Machine,\" won the Hugo Award for Best Short Story of 1998.
