Mirrlees wrote one major poem, Paris (1920), the missing link between French avant-garde poetry and her friend T. S. Eliot’s The Waste Land (1922) ; her novel Lud-in-the-Mist (1926) is an acknowledged classic of fantastical literature. An earlier version of Hope-in-the-Mist was published in the journal Foundation in 2003.\n\nHope-in-the-Mist includes “ A Lexicon of Lud ” prepared by Michael Swanwick (published in shorter form in The New York Review of Science Fiction in July 2005).\n\nThe original edition of Hope-in-the-Mist was published 10 July 2009 at Readercon, in an edition of 230 copies, with illustrations including a frontispiece by Charles Vess. 30 copies, hand bound in Asahi book cloth with Ann Muir marbled endsheets, signed by Michael Swanwick and Neil Gaiman, and with the frontispiece signed by Charles Vess.
