        "text": "Billy Ray Cyrus and Firerose have finalized their divorce.\n\nThe end to the couple’s marriage, which officially took effect on Monday, August 5, comes after less than a year together as husband and wife.\n\nCyrus, 62, filed for divorce from his Australian ex and musical collaborator three months ago, on May 22, 2024, citing “irreconcilable differences.”\n\nAccording to the divorce documents obtained by The Post, Firerose walked away from the marriage with $0. The singer decided to “walk away without fighting for money in order to be done with the volatile relationship and anything having to do with Billy,” a source close to Firerose told The Post.\n\nCyrus seems equally grateful that the seven-month-long union has been dissolved.\n\nIn a statement given to The Post by Cyrus’ lawyers, the country star said, “I’m just very relieved … and giving thanks today to breathe a sigh of relief.”\n\n“This has been absolutely the most crazy insane scam I have ever heard of. Let alone the fact I’m right in the center and basically the target of the scheme.”\n\n“It’s unfortunate … it played out this way,” he added. “[N]ot only was it a web of lies that put me in physical danger … It was a matter of the heart. Love is blind … that’s for sure.”\n\nCyrus’ legal team called the marriage and subsequent divorce a “nightmare.” They also alleged that Firerose only married Cyrus for his last name. According to them, his now ex-wife, who had taken her first husband’s last name, Hodges, legally changed her surname to “Cyrus” just before the pair entered mediation.\n\n“Mr. Cyrus feels that this validates his assertion that his ex-wife’s sole impetus for marrying him was to obtain his last name,” they declared.\n\nHowever, a source close to Firerose told The Post that she filed for the last name change shortly after she and Cyrus wed. “This was not something she just did last week, especially following the ongoing smear campaign by [Billy Ray’s] team,” the source said.\n\nThey added that public’s perception of the “Achy Breaky Heart” singer would have been tarnished had the divorce continued to play out, confirming a report from the Daily Mail.\n\n“If this went to trial, Firerose and her team would have provided a significant amount of evidence to prove he fabricated a narrative that would benefit his public image,” the source asserted.\n\n“There is no doubt she would have been awarded the divorce. But it was much more important to her that this continuous smear campaign end, and the emotional turmoil stop so she can close the door on this chapter and recover from her surgery peacefully.”\n\nFirerose has planned a double mastectomy after learning she tested positive for the BRCA gene, which indicates that a person is more likely to contract certain types of cancer. Allegedly, the surgery was originally supposed to take place just days before Cyrus filed for divorce in May. However, he went on to subpoena her medical records, seemingly questioning the diagnosis.\n\nThe source close to Firerose told The Post that in a former proposed Marital Dissolution Agreement, Cyrus and his team had included a clause asking Firerose to admit she was lying about having the BRCA gene. The source said that this “was quickly and easily thrown out upon Firerose showing her test results and medical records to prove otherwise,” calling it, “just another disgusting move by him.”\n\nFirerose’s surgery is set for later this month.\n\nAccording to the pair’s official settlement, obtained by The Post and first reported by InTouch, both parties will keep all the possessions they owned when they entered into the marriage. This includes any “inherited assets, clothing, hats, accessories, guitars, and musical equipment, jewelry, and items personal to him or her now in their respective possession,” the documents stated.\n\nCyrus will keep all of his horses and livestock along with all of his vehicles — a 2010 Nissan Titan, 1993 Harley Davidson, 1993 GMC Truck, 2008 Freightliner Sprinter Van and a 2024 Nissan Murano. The Kentucky native also maintains his interest in an assortment of production and publishing companies and “any and all right, title and interest” in royalties for his musical compositions.\n\nFirerose was awarded her 2020 Mercedes Benz and also the ownership, master rights and copyright interests “as well as [Billy Ray’s] share of any writer’s ownership and publishing and writers royalties” for the songs the pair wrote and/or published “prior to and during the course of the parties’ marriage in order for wife to have one hundred percent ownership.”\n\nNeither will pay alimony or spousal support, and both were deemed responsible for their own debts.\n\nCyrus and Firerose’s bitter split played out in public, with each accusing the other of both verbal and emotional abuse.\n\nThe Daily Mail obtained audio in July of Cyrus belittling and mocking his Australian-born wife in an expletive-laden rant. The confrontation appeared to have occurred after Cyrus was late to get onstage at a show, for which he seemed to blame Firerose.\n\n“If you had just left it the f–k alone, now I’m really f–king pissed, once again showing you will not listen,” Cyrus reportedly said.\n\n“I don’t know who the f–k you think you are, but you will not listen…this ain’t about nothing this is about you being a selfish f–king b—.”\n\n“I don’t think you’re real smart,” he added. “I’ve changed my mind on that s–t. What I think you are is a selfish f–king b—h. That’s what you are.”\n\nFirerose can be heard on the recording begging Cyrus to “please stop shouting.” Unmoved, he responded, “This would not be happening if you had just shut your f–king mouth. Look at what a f–king mess you’ve made.”\n\nHe continued, “What a dumb ass [you are] …’cos you have to know I will not tolerate that s–t. You just f–ked up…f–k you. You know better than that. F–king idiot.”\n\nMiley Cyrus’ dad responded to the audio in an Instagram story.\n\n“Hell yeah, I was at my wit’s end,” he wrote. “As every day went by, I started realizing something was wrong. And that’s before I knew she [Firerose] was a fraud.”\n\n“I just knew something wasn’t right. That was before I knew she was David Hodges ex-wife. That’s before I knew her parent’s last name.”\n\n“I had no idea she was arrested for felony residential burglary,” he went on, making allegations about her past.\n\n“I saw before my very own eyes, everything I thought I knew about her was a lie. She was trying to take over my career, my life and usurp the Cyrus name for [her] own gain.”\n\nCyrus and Firerose, born Johanna Scholem, married in October 2023 but met in 2010 when he was still married to Tish Cyrus. Billy Ray was 48 at the time and Firerose was 22.\n\nThe couple’s relationship began as a friendship. But 10 years after their first meeting, Cyrus contacted Firerose and asked her to do a duet with him on a cover of Tanya Tucker’s song, “Delta Dawn.”"
