        "text": "Lucie Arnaz Shares Rare Photo of Her Brother Desi Jr. After Being ‘Undercover’ for Years\n\nWhile Lucie Arnaz, the oldest child of the late Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz, continues to appear in the spotlight, the same cannot be said for her brother Desi Arnaz Jr. He began his career in show biz, following his very famous parents, but in recent years has stepped back and very rarely gives a glimpse into his life and what he looks like now. However, Lucie shared a few snaps over the weekend of her brother, who likes to stay “undercover” these days.\n\nOne photo shows Lucie resting her head on her brother’s shoulder, while the other shows the pair smiling at the camera, hugging close. She wrote, “Thank you, Nick Luckinbill (mega producer for EDC), for treating your family to a grand meal at Wally’s in Las Vegas, with our special guest, my recalcitrant brother, Desi Arnaz Jr.!!! Desi is alive and well, my friends — just likes to stay a bit ‘undercover.’”\n\nDesi Jr. deserves some privacy since his birth was one of the most publicized in television history as his parents were on the hugely popular sitcom I Love Lucy and her pregnancy with him was written into the show. In 1952, this was not a common storyline, making it an even bigger part of history. People were so invested in the couple’s second child that a photo of him appeared on cover of the first issue of TV Guide Magazine with the headline, “Lucy’s $50,000,000 baby,” referring to advertising revenue.\n\n>> The Very First TV Guide Turns 70! What Issues Are Most Valuable Today?\n\nAt a young age, Desi Jr. showed an interest in music and acting. He appeared in a band with Dean Martin‘s son, Dean Paul Martin, and Billy Hinsche when he was just a young teen. The trio of Dino, Desi & Billy had a few hit singles including “I’m a Fool” and “Not the Lovin’ Kind.” He went on to appear with his mother and sister in Here’s Lucy and made a guest appearance on The Brady Bunch. Desi Jr. continued to act in films and TV shows including The Streets of San Francisco, Billy Two Hats, Police Story, Matlock and more. He even portrayed his father in the 1992 film The Mambo Kings.\n\nHowever, since his longtime wife Amy Laura Bargiel died in 2015, he has chosen to stay out of the spotlight. Prior to marrying her in 1987, he was connected to Linda Purl, Patty Duke and Liza Minnelli. He has a daughter named Julia from a teenage relationship with model Susan Callahan-Howe and adopted Bargiel’s daughter Haley when they got married."
