        "text": "That's all I've ever heard about this movie, that it was a box office flop. I can accept that it was a flop with critics, and I understand full well why critics did not like it, but many years ago I saw a book in my university library that contained a list of 1974 movies ranked by box office numbers. My memory was that, while Mame was not ranked anywhere near the top for the year, it was still far from the bottom. Now I have found this website which confirms my memory. It shows 117 movies released that year, and if you sort by box office earnings, it comes in at 30th place. That puts Mame in the top 26% of movies that year in terms of box office numbers. According to this site, it earned $18,200,000 (or $87,200,000 in today's dollars). That sounds pretty impressive to me. What's more, according to IMDB, Mame had a budget of $12 million. $18.2 million in earnings on a film that cost $12 million means a 52% return! Please sign me up for any opportunity to make 52% on my investment! And look at some of the movies that year that did less box office than Mame. Harry and Tonto, for example, which won Art Carney an Oscar. And The Life and Times of Grizzly Adams, which NBC apparently thought was a big enough hit to turn it into a TV series a couple years later. And It's Alive, which spawned a sequel. There are a number of other movies further down the list below Mame that are familiar to me but which I've never heard referred to as bombs. So what gives? Why is Mame repeatedly called a box office bomb?\n\nhttps://www.ultimatemovierankings.com/1974-movies/\n\nRank Movie Stars Box Office (Millions) Adjusted B.O.

Where did you get it from? I'd like to look up other years.\n\nBudget and box office numbers can be very misleading. $18M is higher than I've ever heard. When BO numbers are released, they're not always clear: are they 1) the gross receipts received by the theaters? 2) the net of that that reaches the studio? 3) including pre-sold network TV fee? (which was probably considerable). Or some other calculation. The bottom line: what was the PROFIT? When they tally gross receipts based on a calendar year, it doesn't take into account movies that had a run that spanned 2 calendar years. (though Mame's take would have been all 1974). I followed Variety's publish weekly grosses and they said Mame ended up with $6.5million or so. I've heard the Mame budget as $6M, $8M, $10M and $12M. Warners paid (I think) $3.5M for the rights to the Broadway musical, so that was a big chunk. In a big coffee table book about Warner Brothers movies, \"Mame\" was the studio's 4th highest grossing film of the year, behind \"Exorcist\" \"Blazing Saddles\" and \"Magnum Force\". And one more time: Lucy did NOT finance the movie and BUY the role, STEALING it from Angela!! a rumor people seem to like to believe, akin to \"Viv was a year younger than Lucy but was contractually bound to remain 20 pounds overweight\".\n\nAny way you figure it, Mame's BO was a disappointment. The rights were purchased at a time when the major studios were still hoping for one more \"Sound of Music\". But \"Mame\" was really the last of those faithful Broadway-to-movie musicals, and the last by a long shot (with a few low-performing exceptions). The sophisticated \"Cabaret\" changed critic's expectations and they were NOT in the mood to endorse the old-fashioned \"Mame\". Had \"Mame\" been made even 5 years earlier, it may have joined the list of revered movie musicals. For one thing, Lucy was in much better shape vocally in 1968 than she was in 1973 (year of production) and her age wouldn't have been such a HUGE factor.\n\n18 hours ago, Neil said:\n\nLove this chart! Where did you get it from? I'd like to look up other years.\n\nBudget and box office numbers can be very misleading. $18M is higher than I've ever heard.

I can't tell from the information provided, but I would have to assume that the box office numbers of all of the movies listed there were determined on the same basis. However, it would certainly make a difference whether those numbers reflect earnings just during 1974, or whether they are for the entire period the respective movies were playing in theaters, which could have extended into 1975. This is what is stated on the site:\n\n\"Finding box office information for movies made before 1980 is not an easy task. For somebody looking for box office information on 1974 it is very very frustrating. Over the years, we have researched and collected information on over 36,000 movies. So we figured we would show all the 1974 movies in our database.\n\nTo make this list a movie had to be made in 1974. This page will looks at 115 1974 Movies. The movies are listed in a massive table that lets you rank the movies from Best to Worst in six different sortable columns of information. This only represents about 33% of the movies made in 1974….but should cover the top box office movies.\"\n\nSo while I don't know whether these are gross or net box office figures, assuming everything was done on an equal basis, that last sentence that these 115 movies only represent about 33% of the total for 1974 \"but should cover the top box office movies\" is significant. That means that Mame ranked #30 of 115 movies, but rather #30 of around 345 movies, which puts it in the top 9%!\n\n18 hours ago, Neil said:\n\nAnd one more time: Lucy did NOT finance the movie and BUY the role, STEALING it from Angela!! a rumor people seem to like to believe, akin to \"Viv was a year younger than Lucy but was contractually bound to remain 20 pounds overweight\".\n\nSo how did that rumor start? I see people stating that repeatedly on the Internet as if it's fact.\n\n18 hours ago, Neil said:\n\nAny way you figure it, Mame's BO was a disappointment.\n\nANY way you figure it? If Warners was expecting it to be one of the top 10 movies for the year, but it just wound up in 30th place, then yes, it was a BO disappointment. And if they needed for it to be in the top 10 to cover costs, it was a BO disappointment. But relative to the BO of the vast majority of movies that year, it was a big success.\n\nMore fun with numbers! I clicked on the Lucille Ball link and came up with 2 Top 10s\n\nI left out movies that weren't really hers: Ziegfeld, Thousands Cheer, Guide for Married Man, etc. Even in her top 10 list, there are 2 where her role is subordinate (4 if you count Sorrowful and Fancy Pants). Coming in last on the full list is \"Miss Grant Takes Richmond\" with a meager $20M (2018) gross. Lucy's $85,000 pay was a 2018 $900,000. As long as \"Miss Grant\"'s original budget was under $2million, it made money. Not on this list: \"Fuller Brush Girl\"! I don't know where they cut it off. Not surprisingly, YMO held her highest ranking. I'm surprised \"Long Long Trailer\" was not higher on the 1954 list. It was after all \"MGM's HIGHEST GROSSING COMEDY up to that time\" (NOT adjusted for inflation). The consistently maligned \"Forever Darling\" managed to be #33 and gross a 2018 $121M (a bit more than HALF \"Trailer\") To put \"Mame\"'s gross in perspective, it is topped by \"Her Husband's Affairs\" and \"Seven Days Leave\"!!\n\nTop Ten by order of standing of Box Office performances of all movies in a given year (followed by their 'adjusted for inflation' gross)\n\n#10 for 1968: Yours Mine and Ours (inflation adjusted gross) $227M\n\n11 Sorrowful Jones $197\n\n14 Easy to Wed $279\n\n19 Fancy Pants $139\n\n22 Long Long Trailer $223\n\n22 Stage Door $173\n\n23 Dubarry $220\n\n35 Without Love $198\n\n27 Facts of Life $119\n\n#30 Mame $87\n\nTOP 10 ranked by inflation adjusted gross . Note in her #1 movie, she's THIRD billed.\n\n$279,000,000 Easy to Wed\n\n$227 Yours Mine and Ours\n\n$223 Long Trailer\n\n$220 Dubarry\n\n$198 Without Love\n\n$197 Sorrowful Jones\n\n$173 Stage Door (yes, she's not the star but contributes a lot to the appeal of the movie)\n\n$139 Fancy Pants\n\n$121 Forever Darling\n\nOn 12/19/2018 at 9:20 AM, LittleRickyII said:\n\nRE: (Lucy did NOT finance the movie and BUY the role, STEALING it from Angela!!)\n\nSo how did that rumor start? I see people stating that repeatedly on the Internet as if it's fact.\n\nOh, it's just one of things people WANT to believe.\n\nAnd yes Cabaret is definitely a musical even if all the songs were part of the Club act. Non-Sally/Liza songs were dropped except for the Master Race anthem \"Tomorrow Belongs to Me\". Cabaret was completely deconstructed and put back together for the screen by Bob Fosse, taking a big chance that paid off.\n\nAnother musical that changed greatly from stage to screen was \"The Unsinkable Molly Brown\". At least in the song department. The screen version retained only FOUR songs from the original Broadway version, but added a big production number \"He's My Friend\" (otherwise the 2nd half of the movie would be a virtual non-musical). . Our leading lady, Debbie Reynolds on screen, sang only TWO songs (\"Ain't Down\" and \"Belly Up\"), both at the beginning of the movie as opposed to the 8 songs Tammy Grimes had--and Debbie was more of a singer than Tammy. I think their song decision was a good one because the \"Molly\" score was quite a step down from Meredith Willson's \"Music Man\". \"Molly Brown\" was one of the projects Lucy considered before settling on \"Wildcat\" (which IMO has a MUCH better score). Molly and Wildcat are similar characters. 'Molly', at over 500 performances was a hit, a figure that most theater historians agree would have been achieved by Wildcat had Lucy stuck with it. Side note trivia: one thing both Molly Browns had in common (Debbie and Tammy): they both starred in flop sitcoms in the 60s trying to be television's next LUCY!\n\nThe majority of stage-to-screen musicals of the 60s were pretty faithful to the original productions (can't vouch for the ones I haven't seen on screen or stage). \"Mame\" may have been the VERY last of those. At least for the decade. (don't know for sure). With the exception of \"A Little Night Music\" which only got a scant release in 1977. \"Annie\" is pretty faithful but that was 1980. Annie: oddest choice for director of musical movie EVER: 75 year old John Huston. When Mame's crew was being assembled one of the directors approached was FRANCIS FORD COPOLLA (pre-Godfather, of course). Though maybe in his version, Sally Cato would have left the severed head of \"Lightning Rod\"* in Mame's bed the morning after SC stomped off mid-Mame song.\n\n*My memory of the name of \"the delicious piece of horseflesh\" Sally secured for Mame"
