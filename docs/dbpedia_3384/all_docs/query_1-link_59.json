        "text": "Gregory Peck, whose chiseled good looks, resonant baritone and quiet strength made him an unforgettable presence in films like To Kill a Mockingbird, Gentleman's Agreement and Twelve O'Clock High, died early Thursday (June 12, 2003) at his home in Los Angeles. He was 87.\n\nIn a career that spanned a half century, Mr. Peck often played morally anguished heroes who displayed grace under fire. In his most memorable role, as Atticus Finch in the 1962 film To Kill a Mockingbird, he won the Academy Award as best actor for his performance as a gentle Southern lawyer who incurs the wrath of his fellow townsfolk when he defends a black man accused of raping a white woman.\n\nIn this and other movies, his persona as the embodiment of American decency made him a persuasive advocate for the many liberal candidates and causes that he supported.\n\nOver the decades, Mr. Peck remained a popular movie hero who skillfully projected courage, wholesomeness and vulnerability in a wide range of films. His 46th performance, in the 1977 film MacArthur, about Gen. Douglas MacArthur, was praised by Vincent Canby of the New York Times, who wrote that Mr. Peck \"not only looks and sounds like the general, he also makes the character disgracefully appealing, even when he is being his most outrageous.\" Mr. Peck turned in some of his finest performances in the late 1940s. In Alfred Hitchcock's thriller Spellbound (1945), he played an amnesiac with whom his psychiatrist (Ingrid Bergman) falls in love. In his portrayal of the father in The Yearling (1947), Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings' tale of a young boy and his love for a deer, he displayed the warmth and parental understanding that would endear him to audiences in To Kill a Mockingbird.\n\nIn Duel in the Sun (1946) Mr. Peck took a holiday from decency, playing the murderous son of a cattle baron. Although Mr. Peck and his co-star, Jennifer Jones, provided some sizzling scenes that had to be cut when moral watchdog groups objected, the film, a lavish Technicolor western produced by David O. Selznick, failed at the box office. Mr. Peck returned to form as a journalist battling anti-Semitism in Gentleman's Agreement (1947) and as a commanding officer of a bomber unit in Twelve O'Clock High (1949).\n\nDuring the 1950s and '60s, Mr. Peck appeared in roles as various as the burned-out gunslinger in The Gunfighter (1950) and the amiable journalist who courts Audrey Hepburn in the romantic comedy Roman Holiday (1953), a step into Cary Grant territory that caught many critics by surprise. Other roles included the button-down, harried corporate man in The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit (1956), the obsessed Captain Ahab in Moby Dick (1956), the conscience-stricken military officer in Pork Chop Hill (1959) and the idealistic officer in The Guns of Navarone (1961).\n\nAlthough Mr. Peck was nominated as best actor for The Keys of the Kingdom, The Yearling, Gentleman's Agreement and Twelve O'Clock High, he did not win an Oscar until To Kill a Mockingbird, which dealt seriously with racism and social injustice at a time when the civil rights movement was gaining national attention.\n\n\"For Peck, it is an especially challenging role,\" wrote a critic in Variety, adding, \"He not only succeeds, but makes it appear effortless, etching a portrayal of strength, dignity and intelligence.\"\n\nEldred Gregory Peck was born April 5, 1916, in La Jolla, Calif. His father, Gregory, a pharmacist, and his mother, Bernice, separated when he was 3 and divorced soon after. He was brought up primarily by his maternal grandmother, Kate Ayres. He attended St. John's Military Academy in Los Angeles and the University of California at Berkeley, where he paid his way as a janitor, waiter and dishwasher and majored in English and drama. While performing in Moby Dick, Anna Christie and other productions at the university's Little Theater, he resolved to become an actor.\n\nAfter earning a bachelor's degree in 1939, he moved to New York. While struggling to gain a foothold on Broadway, he worked as a barker at the 1939 World's Fair, an usher at Radio City Music Hall, a tour guide at the NBC studios and a model. He won a two-year scholarship at the Neighborhood Playhouse, where he studied Method acting with Sanford Meisner. An injury exempted him from military service during World War II.\n\nMr. Peck played two seasons of summer stock, won the 1940 best actor award from the Barter Theater in Abingdon, Va., and had roles in three Broadway flops. His notices were favorable, and he was offered a lead in the 1944 film Days of Glory, in which he played a Russian partisan in World War II; it was criticized after the war as Soviet propaganda.\n\nHis second picture, The Keys of the Kingdom (1944), won him stardom and his first Academy Award nomination, for his portrayal of a noble maverick priest.\n\nEligible leading men were in short supply during World War II, so Mr. Peck's stock soared. From the start, he chose roles carefully, resisted typecasting and stayed independent by refusing to sign long-term contracts. On one celebrated occasion, he reduced Louis B. Mayer to tears by turning down a contract at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. Mr. Peck was one of the Top 10 Hollywood box office stars for several years, and by 1962 he was usually earning at least $1-million a movie.\n\nMr. Peck was active in charitable and film industry causes. He was a longtime member of the National Council on the Arts. He was governor of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences for 15 years, and the academy's president from 1967 to 1970. He also served on the board of the American Film Institute, and was its founding chairman from 1967 to 1969.\n\nHis name was perennially prominent on lists of Hollywood figures who backed liberal political causes. Most famous, perhaps, was his opposition in 1987 to the nomination of Judge Robert H. Bork to the Supreme Court.\n\nMr. Peck was also the national crusade chairman of the American Cancer Society and was a longtime board member of the Motion Picture and Television Relief Fund and its country house and hospital for retired actors. He aided black artists as a co-founder and major benefactor of the Los Angeles Inner City Cultural Center.\n\nHis honors included the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian award in the United States, and the movie academy's Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award. In his leisure time he supervised the training of his thoroughbred racehorses.\n\nHis first marriage, to Greta Rice, ended in divorce in 1955. He is survived by his wife, the former Veronique Passani; his sons Stephen, Carey and Anthony; a daughter, Cecilia; and six grandchildren. Another son, Jonathan, a television reporter, committed suicide at 30.\n\nThe films of Gregory Peck:\n\nDays of Glory, 1944\n\nThe Keys of the Kingdom, 1945\n\nThe Valley of Decision, 1945\n\nSpellbound, 1945\n\nThe Yearling, 1946\n\nThe Macomber Affair, 1947\n\nDuel in the Sun, 1947\n\nGentleman's Agreement, 1947\n\nThe Paradine Case, 1948\n\nYellow Sky, 1948\n\nThe Great Sinner, 1949\n\nTwelve O'Clock High, 1950\n\nThe Gunfighter, 1950\n\nOnly the Valiant, 1951\n\nDavid and Bathsheba, 1951\n\nCaptain Horatio Hornblower, 1951\n\nThe Snows of Kilimanjaro, 1952\n\nThe World in His Arms, 1952\n\nRoman Holiday, 1953\n\nNight People, 1954\n\nThe Million-Pound Note or Man With a Million, 1954\n\nThe Purple Plain, 1954\n\nThe Man in the Gray Flannel Suit, 1956\n\nMoby Dick, 1956\n\nDesigning Woman, 1957\n\nThe Bravados, 1958\n\nThe Big Country, 1958\n\nPork Chop Hill, 1959\n\nBeloved Infidel, 1959\n\nOn the Beach, 1959\n\nThe Guns of Navarone, 1961\n\nTo Kill a Mockingbird, 1962\n\nCape Fear, 1962\n\nHow the West Was Won, 1962\n\nCaptain Newman M.D., 1964\n\nBehold a Pale Horse, 1964\n\nMirage, 1965\n\nArabesque, 1966\n\nThe Stalking Moon, 1969\n\nMackenna's Gold, 1969\n\nThe Chairman or The Most Dangerous Man in the World, 1969\n\nMarooned, 1969\n\nI Walk the Line, 1970\n\nShoot-Out, 1971\n\nThe Trial of the Catonsville Nine (producer only), 1972\n\nBilly Two Hats, 1974\n\nThe Dove (producer only), 1974\n\nThe Omen, 1976\n\nMacArthur, 1977\n\nThe Boys from Brazil, 1978\n\nThe Sea Wolves, 1980\n\nThe Blue and the Gray (TV movie), 1982\n\nThe Scarlet and the Black (TV movie), 1982\n\nAmazing Grace and Chuck, 1987\n\nOld Gringo, 1989\n\nOther People's Money, 1991\n\nCape Fear, 1991\n\nThe Portrait (TV movie), 1993\n\nMoby Dick (TV movie), 1998\n\nGregory Peck posed with Sophia Loren backstage during the Academy Awards in 1963 after winning his only Oscar, for his portrayal of Atticus Finch in To Kill a Mockingbird.\n\nGregory Peck may be best known for playing Atticus Finch, a Southern lawyer who defends a black man accused of raping a white woman in To Kill a Mockingbird."
