        "text": "What male star has the best record of quality movies in Hollywood history? It’s probably Cary Grant, who didn’t tie himself to one studio and therefore could pick his roles. He did a great job. You can count on one hand the number of less than “good” movies he made when he became a leading man in the mid-thirties.\n\nFor the purposes of this post, I considered (1) the male stars who began before World War II whose careers were interrupted by military service but who returned from the war with careers intact and reached their apogee after the war (Glenn Ford, William Holden, James Stewart) and (2) the likes of Kirk Douglas, Charlton Heston, Richard Widmark, and Gregory Peck, who made their first major features postwar. Peck, whose career actually began in 1944, had a sterling resume that rivaled Grant for many years but was compromised by such feeble efforts as Shoot Out (1971) and Billy Two Hats (1974). Clark Gable’s postwar record is not the stuff of legend. He, too, was in the war, but after the conflict and return to his home studio MGM, his films were distinctly less noteworthy than those in his 1930s resume. If you can count on one hand the unsatisfying films of Cary Grant during his career, you can count on one hand the truly good movies Gable made after WW II. Could it be that the death of his star wife Carole Lombard in a 1942 air crash made him less selective of the scripts he received after the war?\n\nThe timeframe for this post is, then, the immediate postwar years into the 1970s. Of course it’s subjective, but an actor who began as a leading man in his first released postwar movie arguably has the best resume: former circus acrobat Burt Lancaster. The film was the noir classic The Killers (1946) in which pugilist “Swede” got on the wrong side of the mob and of Kitty (Ava Gardner, also early in her career) and was pursued by two exceedingly frightening hitmen memorably played by Charles McGraw and William Conrad.\n\nLancaster had the drive, the moxie, and the intelligence to capitalize on his early celebrity and along with being under contract to big-time producer Hal B. Wallis, make good or excellent films in various genres, sometimes for his own production company. In both instances Wallis and/or Lancaster chose wisely. His career was mostly clunker-free. One remembers what Swede said in The Killers: “I made a mistake—once.”\n\nFollowing on the heels of The Killers was another noir, I Walk Alone (1947). But Lancaster’s best film that year was Brute Force, a topnotch and quite violent prison drama.\n\nSorry, Wrong Number (1948) paired Lancaster with a legend, Barbara Stanwyck. She got top billing.\n\nCriss Cross (1949) was a noir with an armored car robbery at its heart. A top Hollywood villain, Dan Duryea was Lancaster’s nemesis. Like Ava Gardner in The Killers, Yvonne de Carlo was the femme fatale who was not good for Lancaster’s health.\n\nThe following year (1950) Lancaster had the chance to use his athleticism in the medieval swashbuckler, The Flame and the Arrow. As Dardo, a William Tell-like freedom fighter, Lancaster employed his superb athletic ability to evade, then put the kibosh on his assailants. It was of similar mien to 1938’s The Adventures of Robin Hood, both from Warner Bros., with which Lancaster had signed the standard long-term contract courtesy of producer Wallis.\n\nVengeance Valley (1951) was Lancaster’s first western, a genre in which he would excel although he is not especially remembered as a cowpoke. (See Apache, Gunfight at the OK Corral, The Unforgiven, The Professionals, The Scalphunters, Valdez is Coming, Lawman, and Cattle Annie and Little Britches.)\n\nLike The Flame and the Arrow, 1952’s The Crimson Pirate was a rousing swashbuckler not to be taken seriously. It was in fact something of a lightning rod for anti-communists. For them crimson was, of course, a hidden allusion to “red,” aka Red!\n\nFor Come Back, Little Sheba (1952), Lancaster had his hair dyed to look older. This was an attempt to show his chops in a respectable play-into-movie version of William Inge’s drama that netted Shirley Booth an Academy Award.\n\nAlthough it was the 1951 National Book Award-winner, the James Jones novel From Here to Eternity was thought to be un-filmable because of its racy nature. Nevertheless, it was composed with care and released in 1953, winning the Best Picture Academy Award over notable competitors: Shane, Julius Caesar, Roman Holiday, and The Robe. Despite the powerhouse cast that included Deborah Kerr, Montgomery Clift and Frank Sinatra, Lancaster held it all together as Master Sergeant Milt Warden, playing fair with his men and brandishing a broken bottle to stymie knife-wielding Sergeant “Fatso” Judson (Ernest Borgnine), intent on carving up Maggio (Sinatra). Both Lancaster and Clift received Best Actor Academy Award nominations, and Kerr received the second of her six nominations. (She never won. Competition was stiffer back in the day.) Sinatra and Donna Reed did win Supporting Actor and Actress, respectively.\n\nTwo westerns were on tap in 1954. Apache may have starred Caucasians (Lancaster and Jean Peters) but their native-American characters were shone in the positive light that had begun in 1950 with Broken Arrow and Devil’s Doorway. Lancaster played Massai, one of Geronimo’s band unwilling to go to a Florida reservation after his chief’s capture. Vera Cruz was the second western of the year, a hard charging, roaring adventure south of the border. Lancaster played Joe Erin, a lovable scoundrel opposite Gary Cooper’s taciturn ex-Confederate officer Ben Trane. Hoping to run guns or gold for the Emperor Maximilian, the two protagonists find their affections drifting toward the rebel Juaristas—at least for Trane. Lancaster did a reverse draw early in the film to dispose of his rival played by veteran character actor villain Jack Lambert. “Anybody else sidin’ with Charlie?” was a non sequitur. Confronted, nay, surrounded by gun-totin’ Juaristas led by General Ramirez (Morris Ankrum), Joe is presented with a dilemma: join the rebels or be shot down there and then—when Pedro stops strumming his guitar. “Better make it a long one, Pedro, ‘cause you ain’t never gonna play another.” That was a hoot. Also “hootish” was the scene when Lancaster grins across the back of his saddle, his white teeth blinding us mortals. (Probably only Kirk Douglas could have sported such a smile. Fortuitously, Lancaster and Douglas would work together seven times and pair up on the 1958 Academy Award telecast where they performed a soft shoe routine to “It’s Great Not to Be Nominated.”)\n\nAnother estimable play from Tennessee Williams served as the basis for The Rose Tattoo (1955). As with Shirley Booth in Come Back, Little Sheba, Lancaster was magic for his leading lady. Anna Magnani won the Best Actress Academy Award.\n\nEarly in his career Lancaster decided to form Norma Productions, which morphed into Hecht-Lancaster and finally Hecht-Hill-Lancaster. Over 20 films came under this banner. Lancaster starred in most. Others from this stable in which he did not appear but became famous were Best Picture Academy Award winner, Marty (1955), and The Bachelor Party (1957). Interestingly, Marty starred and won the Best Actor award for Ernest Borgnine, previously a character actor known to Lancaster via his parts in From Here to Eternity and Vera Cruz.\n\nIn Trapeze (1956), the first Hecht-Hill-Lancaster production, Lancaster got close to his pre-war roots when he and partner Nick Cravat were circus performers. Lancaster tutored Tony Curtis in high-wire skills and competed with his protégé for the affections of ultra-sexy Gina Lollobrigida.\n\nYet another film with a theatrical heritage was The Rainmaker (1956). Looking back, this was a sort of trial run for 1960’s Elmer Gantry. Lancaster was paired with Hollywood legend Katharine Hepburn. Such was his status that he got first billing.\n\nIn the now recognized classic Sweet Smell of Success (1957) Lancaster played the ruthless columnist J. J. Hunsecker. Tony Curtis returned, again as Lancaster’s apprentice.\n\nNot a great but a very enjoyable big western was released the same year. Gunfight at the OK Corral paired Lancaster as Wyatt Earp with Kirk Douglas as Doc Holliday. Under director John Sturges’ deft hand, including outstanding gunfight choreography, the movie was a big hit.\n\nRun Silent, Run Deep (1958) was a meeting of old and new. Clark Gable was the sub captain, Lancaster the executive officer returning to the fabulously titled Bungo Straits, this time to redeem himself after a previously botched sally into Japanese waters.\n\nThe Unforgiven (1960) was a large-scale western directed by John Huston. Certainly Lancaster had arrived—if this wasn’t already evident—by securing star billing over a second Hepburn—Audrey, playing a young woman who might or might not have been born to the Kiowas.\n\nThat same year Lancaster was Elmer Gantry. It was based on Sinclair Lewis’s notorious 1927 novel, an attack on unscrupulous religious con men that really was “banned in Boston.” Who else but the grinning, boisterous Lancaster to play the title character in the movie version—and win the Best Actor Academy Award?\n\nIn 1961 Lancaster was part of an ensemble cast in Judgment at Nuremberg, a semi-fictionalized account of the postwar crime trials of German judges and prosecutors. This was a successful reserved seat production.\n\nThe hits continued with Birdman of Alcatraz (1962). Lancaster received another Academy Award nomination for portraying Robert Stroud, murderer become a self-made avian expert.\n\nStretching himself again, Lancaster took on the role of a noble Italian family’s paterfamilias in The Leopard (1963), an epic set in the second half of the 19th century. Some critics at the time thought Lancaster was over-reaching, but he and the film are now ranked highly.\n\nThe Train (1964) remains a well-regarded war film in which Lancaster played a French railway worker foiling a Nazi officer’s plan to spirit various works of art out of the country as the Allies advanced toward Germany.\n\nSeven Days in May (1964) was a political thriller. Lancaster played General James Mattoon Scott. Kirk Douglas was Colonel “Jiggs” Casey, who discovered that Scott was engineering a governmental overthrow because he felt the President (Fredric March) was too weak to guide the country in perilous times.\n\nEvery studio contracted roadshow fever in the 60s, and the bloated and racially insensitive The Hallelujah Trail (1965) was a United Artists and Lancaster misstep. Even at the time it seemed ridiculous and has a claim to being the worst of the reserved-seat films in that golden age of roadshows. It was a flop, financially and critically. Recall his line in The Killers: “I made a mistake—once.”\n\nA western with much more gravitas was The Professionals (1966), a sort of run-up for Lee Marvin in The Dirty Dozen (1967). Four men with distinctive skills are hired by Ralph Bellamy to enter Mexico to retrieve his wife (Claudia Cardinale): Lancaster the explosives expert, Marvin the leader, Robert Ryan the wrangler, and Woody Strode the archer who launched Lancaster’s dynamite sticks into the heavily guarded compound of Jesus Raza (Jack Palance). A macho cast if ever there was one!\n\nGiven short shrift at the time, The Swimmer (1968) is now recognized as another triumph in Lancaster’s career. Based on a John Cheever story published in The New Yorker, the film follows upscale Connecticut citizen Ned Merrill who makes his way home from a posh party via a series of swimming pools. It is a voyage of self-discovery, and Lancaster’s performance is now recognized as one of his best.\n\nSkydiving was the subject of The Gypsy Moths (1969). Lancaster was reunited with his From Here to Eternity co-star Deborah Kerr, and despite the action and Kerr’s nude scene the movie was not a success.\n\nAirport (1970) was based on Arthur Hailey’s novel, the biggest bestseller of 1968. Termed by some a Grand Hotel of the sky, what with its king-size roster of stars, this disaster movie now looks rather tame. Nevertheless, the movie version was one of the big hits of 1970 and is considered the grandparent of the modern disaster movie.\n\nLancaster’s western credentials were amplified in the early 70s with Valdez is Coming (1971), Lawman (1971), and Ulzana’s Raid (1972). In the first he played a Hispanic sheriff, in the second an Anglo sheriff, in the third and best of the trio, a cavalry scout.\n\nIn 1978 Lancaster starred in two films, Go Tell the Spartans (1978) and The Island of Dr. Moreau (1978). Spartans was an anti-war piece about U.S. “advisors” in Vietnam in 1964. It was no big hit then but over time has come in for praise. Moreau was set on a distant island where the title character, as in H. G. Wells’ famous novel, performs surgery to transform animals into “men.”\n\nIn Atlantic City (1980) Lancaster squired Susan Sarandon around the underbelly of the East Coast Vegas and scored another Academy Award nomination, but who was going to best Ben Kingsley as Gandhi?\n\nLancaster’s leading man days were essentially over. Nevertheless, his character parts in Local Hero (1983) and Field of Dreams (1989) were signaled out for praise.\n\nWhen Lancaster passed away in 1994, the co-author of Science Fiction, Fantasy and Horror Film Sequels, Series and Remakes, Tom Winchester, sadly and aptly remarked, “Who can imagine a world without Burt Lancaster?”\n\nReferences\n\nBuford, Kate.
