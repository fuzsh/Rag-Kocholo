        "text": "Melee Stats is proud to present SSBMRank Summer 2024! Counting down the 50 best players of the year so far to determine the best player for the first half of 2024.\n\nWe polled 21 community figures to rate each ballot-eligible player based on their performances throughout the first half of 2024. These panelists span a wide range: top players, tournament organizers, writers, analysts, and more. Each panelist rated each player with a value between 1 and 70, and then each player’s rating was aggregated to a single value based on their distribution of votes.\n\n#40: KJH | Rating: 43.53\n\nIt’s hard to deny that this is a period of uncertainty for Michigan Melee. The Big House, which once brought the entire Smash community to the Great Lake State on an annual basis, is on indefinite hiatus. Some of the state’s longest-standing top players, including community figureheads such as Duck and Ginger, have retired or moved away.\n\nBut Kalindi “KJH” Henderson isn’t going anywhere. The Fox/Falco dual main already tried his hand at retiring back in 2020 — and soon found that it wasn’t his speed. These days, KJH continues to make his mark on the scene, both through recent wins over such talent as Zuppy, Ben and Bbatts and in the form of content such as “Spacie Jam,” his regular theorycrafting sessions with Mang0.\n\nIn past years, KJH was a disruptor — an innovating Fox main who broke with existing preconceptions about the character to develop his own unique techniques and playstyle. Now, as newer talents such as Ossify rise through the ranks within his region, KJH has become a role model in his own right. For students of the game, his teachings have become required reading.\n\n-Alex “QualitySteve” Lee\n\n#39: Drephen | Rating: 45.14\n\n1920’s World Chess Champion José Raúl Capablanca wrote in his still-used guide Chess Fundamentals that “tactics may change but the strategic fundamental principles are always the same, so that Chess Fundamentals … will be as good a hundred years from now; as long in fact as the laws and rules of the game remain what they are at present.” Melee is (basically) still Melee, and Drew “Drephen” Scoles is living proof that fundamentals are indeed fundamental.\n\nThat’s not to say Drephen isn’t quirky — anyone who’s seen him play tends to be baffled by the options he hits people with. Why is full hop double jump down air working? Can you really roll and spotdodge that much? I guess you can.\n\nAt this point, Drephen feels as much a part of Melee as Captain Falcon. We are now seventeen years past Drephen’s breakout tournament win over Azen, and his results are still something to be envied. How many players pushing 40 can still knock out young cracked foxes like Chem and Zamu? He’s even a significant hurdle for hot new commodities like Ossify. Forget just Sheik and the Midwest; Drephen is a source of inspiration for married men everywhere.\n\n-Larfen\n\n#38: Logan | Rating: 47.73\n\nIf you’re a Melee fan, you’ve probably seen the soul-crushing clips from Logan Dunn’s run at Smash Camp: New Lands 2024. First, there was their nail-biting last-stock finish against Aura in winner’s quarters. Then, a devastating missed suicide dair against Fiction to leave Logan down and out at 5th place.\n\nBut Logan’s response to this adversity demonstrated the remarkable strength of character that the South Carolina native has cultivated since their most recent SSBMRank appearance in 2022. Instead of exploding with rage or losing hope, Logan took to Twitter to poke fun at their situation, comparing it to the mythical trial of Sisyphus — only with a tournament bracket instead of a hill.\n\nLogan’s trial isn’t over yet. Having achieved their lifelong goal of becoming a top Melee player, they are now in the exciting, if also daunting, position of figuring out what dream to pursue next — all while solidifying their spot on the year-end rankings. Watch out, hill: here comes that boulder.\n\n-Alex “QualitySteve” Lee\n\n#37: Akir | Rating: 48.16\n\nThe Donkey Kong renaissance may have started in 2023, but Joseph “Akir” Neidig is cargo carrying that momentum well into 2024. After making his SSBMRank debut last year, Akir proved alongside his fellow DK companions that the character was a serious tournament threat. However, without the chance to travel often, the Florida native was limited to online competition, where he could often be found on top of the Slippi leaderboards and online event graphics with the trusty leader of the DK crew or his many secondaries.\n\nSo when a sponsorship from community members like Fizzi gave Akir the rare chance to compete out of region, it was an opportunity he did not waste. If securing wins on Fishbait, Gahtzu, and Soonsay on his way to a 25th place finish at Genesis X wasn’t impressive enough, Akir was also a stock away at Tipped Off 15 from 3–0ing moky and sentencing a second Canadian Fox to finish 33rd at a major.\n\nDespite his stellar year in singles competition, when asked his favorite moment competing this year, Akir chose teaming with his longtime friend Ossify at Tipped Off 15. No matter where he’s playing or what character he chooses before a match, Akir just wants to have fun playing video games with his friends.\n\n-Todd “Anchor” Bechtel\n\n#36: Bbatts | Rating: 48.83\n\nBetween his extravagant, “unapologetically himself” Twitter personality, and his wildly enthusiastic energy whenever he lights up the mic, it’s no surprise that New Jersey’s zoomer Peach William “Bbatts” Batista became a fan-favorite. His Gen Z zealousness is clear in his gameplay too — watch any Bbatts set and he’ll be holding forward, pressing as many buttons as humanly possible to make his princess tweak across the screen.\n\nBbatts kicked off Pride Month by beating Spark and Fiction during a ridiculous Smash Camp: New Lands 2024 run that ended in tragedy: a DQ to catch his flight home. But Billy wasn’t finished with the West Coast yet. Weeks later, he flew to SoCal, spent the whole day at Universal Studios, strolled into the SoCal Star League venue, and proceeded to casually whoop KoDoRiN, all while wearing a plushie Toad hat. Between those two results and Billy’s victory over Aklo at the Juneteenth Nightclub, the drastic improvement of his results this summer almost looks staged. We asked what the secret to his recent success was. His response? “Pride Month Powerup.”\n\nJune is over, but don’t think Billy’s stopping anytime soon: his sunglasses are on and he’s LOCKED IN. Move over, “brat summer;” it’s giving Bbatts summer.\n\n-Justin “DarkGenex” Cohen\n\n#35: bobby big ballz | Rating: 49.77\n\nLet’s be honest. An introduction for a guy like bobby big ballz is a formality. Through both whims and wins, he’s carved out a place in the zeitgeist as one of Melee’s biggest streamers aside from the grand-fathered legends of Mang0 and Hungrybox. Most likely to pass the airport security charisma check. Most likely to run amok in your favorite city then drop a combo video about it. Most likely to tell a storied veteran to retire post-set. He’s snatched up more uncanny superlatives than those — all for the love of the game and his adoring fans.\n\nYou’re at the function when BBB’s going live notifications pops off. You decide to tune in. Turn on his stream and see it unfold in real time: he’s dropping names to the shadow realm at his Tipped Off 15 losers run. Zasa, KJH, and Panda fall prey to him as farmed content. These days, missing bobby on stream might mean missing the clip of the day.\n\n-Michael Wills\n\n#34: S2J | Rating: 54.52\n\nMelee veteran Johnny “S2J” Kim, AKA the reigning “King of New York,” has spent 2024 solidifying his name in the history books of Melee. Johnny started the year off strong with high placements at Genesis X, Pat’s House 4 and Tipped Off 15 over incredibly fierce opposition. So far this year he has secured wins from Joshman, Lucky, Salt, and KJH. However, S2J’s losses are equally diverse, making him a particularly difficult player to place.\n\nS2J’s move to NorCal from SoCal a little over a year ago has provided a changed in scenery, both literally and with regards to competition. S2J is used to facing off against a highly saturated population of Top 100 level players on a weekly basis, including Mang0, Fiction, and Lucky. These days, you can instead spot him competing against a different crop of talent such as Umarth, Mojoe, and darkwizard123 at San Jose’s Guildhouse local. Regardless of what his location is, he doesn’t let his foot off the gas when it comes to his amazing combo game or ability to clutch close matches. Seeing him travel to majors and putting his swag-filled Falcon on display is always a treat for his fans, who can count on S2J to keep pushing the Falcon meta for his peers.\n\n-CJ Hyland\n\n#33: MOF | Rating: 55.60\n\nDespite playing Ice Climbers, Aly “MOF” Oquendo embodies the heat of the summer better than any Melee player today. And it’s not just about her aggressive, space-limiting playstyle or flashy hand-offs hailing from sunny southern Florida, MOF just plays better in higher temperatures. Her major results quite noticeably trend better the closer she gets to the equator; from disappointment at Canada’s Get On My Level X, to average at NorCal’s Genesis X, to a strong Top 6 finish at Florida’s very own CEO 2024.\n\nThis year, MOF returned to the very tournament series where she put her name on the map at Georgia’s Tipped Off 15, beating moky, bobby big ballz, and Drephen on the way to 13th place. With SluG still largely inactive, MOF clearly retains the title of the top Ice Climbers main in the world. The question isn’t her skill level, which she’s made evident to anyone watching; the question is whether she can manage a level of consistency with her results. We’ll see if she can adjust for the colder half of the year.\n\n-Kezzup\n\n#32: Wally | Rating: 57.05\n\nIf you follow Ryan “Wally” Metwally closely, you’ll learn some surprising truths about competitive melee. Watch his Peach move THAT fast and hit the best players THAT hard, and then realize that he picked up the game about a year before he became top five in New Jersey. Three years after that, he’d stun world #1 Zain. Even twenty years into Melee’s lifetime, true prodigies still exist.\n\nWhen he “retired” last year, you may have assumed Wally’s Melee climb was over. What you have to understand is that in our scene, retirement means less “I am done playing” and more “I will stop spending most of my waking life attempting to be the world champion.” Is it that surprising that taking a step back to find the joy in competing can inadvertently put you back on the Golden Path? Did you not expect Wally to storm to 9th at Collision 2024 by 3–0ing Kodorin, KJH, and Chem? When you saw his Get On My Level X bracket path careen right into Cody Schwab for 25th, did you really think he wouldn’t put himself one close-out fair away from taking down another reigning world #1? At the next major, he could DQ himself early on to go hang with friends, or dominantly tear the hearts out of the game’s stars. Who can guess. You’re going to have to learn to enjoy the journey.\n\n-Chroma09\n\n#31: Sirmeris | Rating: 57.37\n\nEvery year has taken Daniel “Sirmeris” Dolin to increasing heights, and 2024 has been no different. When leaving his long-time home state of West Virginia in the tail end of 2023, he migrated across just a single border into Ohio. Upon arrival, the Appalachian Peach main immediately staked his claim on his new territory by earning the #1 spot on the first full-state power ranking since 2019, above four other players who qualified for the Summer Top 50.\n\nNot content with mere local domination, Sirmeris crossed yet another single state line to visit Indiana for Full Bloom 2024. Upon arrival, he was met by none other than Mang0, who sent him off to loser’s bracket with a 1–3 loss. Undeterred, Sirmeris slayed Komodo, TheRealThing, Salt, and Grab to earn his rematch and flip the script on The Kid with his own 3–1 victory, achieving his highest ever national tournament placement of 4th. With no further avenues to discount his skill, Peach haters everywhere can only pray that Sirmeris doesn’t sub-float his way to their region next. For now, they might rest easy — if only they remain multiple borders away.\n\n-Seal\n\nThe SSBMRank Summer 2024 Team\n\nDirector: Brendan “GimmeDatWheat” Malone\n\nEditing Lead: Zane “epengu” Bhansali\n\nData Lead: Eryk “Ambisinister” Banatt\n\nGraphics Lead: Nick “DarkDragoon” Konstantino\n\nCommunity Lead: Justin “DarkGenex” Cohen\n\nCheck out start.gg/SSBMRank to follow along with the full list as it releases"
