        "text": "For more than 30 years, Keuka College students, alumni, and friends of the College have enjoyed traveling for Field Period® with faculty from the political science and history program. Having a Ph.D. historian or political scientist lead a group learning process opens doors to the significance of culture, architecture, political events, and history itself.\n\nStudents and professors have traveled to Eastern European cities in the Czech Republic and Slovakia, Italy, England, Ireland, France, Hungary, and Romania.\n\nKeuka College also encourages students to apply to the Fulbright Scholar Program, a federally-funded international educational exchange program that helps build relationships between American academics, policy expert, and students and their foreign counterparts.\n\nIn addition to your Field Period® experiences, there are several other opportunities to gain real-world experience in your political science and history program.\n\nYou can join the Political Science, History, and Pre-Law Club and participate in several annual activities including voter registration drives, visits to law schools, and trips to statehouses serving as local, state and national seats of government.\n\nYou can also participate in the Washington Internship Program, a semester-long internship in Washington, D.C. during the fall or spring semester. Spend time in the nation’s capital studying, working, and earning up to 16 academic credits. This internship is open to sophomores, juniors, or seniors.\n\nThroughout the political science and history program, you’ll have the opportunity to work with your professors on joint research projects for presentations at academic or professional conferences."
