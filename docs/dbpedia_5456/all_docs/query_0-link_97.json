        "text": "Re “Golden State’s slow vote count is an embarrassment” (Aug. 4): As a recent letter writer complains, the Republican Party has little role in the governing of California, though that is members’ own choice. Back when I registered as a Republican voter, the party was known for fiscal responsibility and less government and held a strong role in the state’s politics. Now it is most famous for a religion-driven social agenda designed to reduce our personal freedoms. That agenda is not acceptable to most Californians. In a democracy, the power of a political party depends on relevance to a majority of the voters. Hewing to unpopular principles may feel good to some, but it will never produce a return to political power.\n\n— Geoff Smith, Carlsbad\n\nDavid Marinkovich cannot see the forest for the trees. He mistakenly believes that the open primary (“jungle” primary) favors Democrats. The Open Primary Act was fostered by Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger in 2012. The point being to allow all voters, especially independents, to participate. Schwarzenegger handed the Republicans a road map for taking back the governor’s mansion. I would prefer to see more Republicans and a balanced Legislature. But they don’t get it. Republicans spent $450 million of the state’s funds to recall Newsom. OK. But who did they back? Larry Elder?! Doubling-down on culture wars is not going to work in California.\n\n— Jan Christenson, Del Mar"
