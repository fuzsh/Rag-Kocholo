        "text": "District 7\n\nThe District\n\nThis East Bay district includes parts of Alameda and Contra Costa counties, and a sliver of San Francisco County. The district has a mix of incomes and wealth levels. It includes the cities of Berkeley and Oakland, which in 2022, experienced some of the highest rates of homelessness in California.\n\nVoter registration: 68.2% Democrat, 6.4% Republican, 20.4% no party preference\n\nThe Scoop\n\nPrimary results: Jesse Arreguín 32.1%, Jovanka Beckles 17.7%\n\nCan the primary underdog do it again? The bid to take over this seat, now occupied by Sen. Nancy Skinner, who reaches her term limit in December, was the most expensive legislative race in the state. Early results in the March primary leaned towards a general election battle between Berkeley Mayor Jesse Arreguin and Oakland City Council member Dan Kalb — until a late-stage surge in votes for Jovanka Beckles, a former Richmond city council member and a member of the Bay Area Rapid Transit board who spent far less on the primary race.\n\nArreguin has the support of Skinner, long a powerful lawmaker, and the Democratic Party and continues to outraise Beckles. But he has been criticized for taking money from industry groups representing landlords, developers and realtors. Beckles has the support of more progressive groups and elected leaders — including U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont.\n\nFundraising\n\nKey Endorsements\n\nJesse Arreguín\n\nCalifornia Democratic Party\n\nPlanned Parenthood\n\nState Building and Construction Trades CouncilCalifornia YIMBY\n\nUnited Farm Workers\n\nSan Francisco Chronicle\n\nJovanka Beckles\n\nCalifornia Teachers Association\n\nCalifornia Labor Federation\n\nCalifornia Working Families Party\n\nU.S. Rep.

It is home to Joshua Tree National Park — meaning national parks, recreational activities, and tourism are key issues here.\n\nVoter registration: 36.7% Democrat, 35.6% Republican, 18.7% no party preference\n\nThe Scoop\n\nPrimary results: Rosilicie Ochoa Bogh 53.8%, Lisa Middleton 46.2%\n\nThe primary in this purple district wasn’t exactly a close one, with Rosilicie Ochoa Bogh, the incumbent in the prior district covering most of the current one, securing a solid lead. But that was before President Joe Biden decided not to run for re-election. Some consultants believe the surge in enthusiasm among Democratic voters for Kamala Harris could carry Democrat Lisa Middleton to victory in a district that has become more blue since 2020. Democrats currently have about a 1 percentage point advantage in voter registration.\n\nOchoa Bogh is a former elementary school teacher, school board member and Realtor. She was the first Republican Latina to serve in the Senate, where she has held leadership positions on education, housing and human services.\n\nMiddleton worked as an auditor and later, as vice president for California’s State Compensation Insurance Fund. She also served as chairperson of California’s Fraud Assessment Commission.\n\nKey Endorsements\n\nLisa Middleton\n\nCalifornia Democratic Party\n\nNational Union of Healthcare Workers\n\nEquality California\n\nReproductive Freedom For All California\n\nRosilicie Ochoa Bogh\n\nCalifornia Republican Party\n\nHoward Jarvis Taxpayers Association\n\nCalifornia Association of Highway Patrolmen\n\nRelated News\n\nBack to top\n\nDistrict 23\n\nThe District\n\nThis Southern California district includes a mix of coastal communities such as Santa Barbara, as well as smaller, rural agricultural communities and the Danish-inspired village of Solvang.\n\nVoter registration: 39.6% Democrat, 30.8% Republican, 21.1% no party preference\n\nThe Scoop\n\nPrimary results: Suzette Martinez Valladares 32.8%, Kipp Mueller 29.4%\n\nBased on the new boundaries from the most recent redistricting, this Northern Los Angeles County district has become more Democratic since 2014, so it’s worth watching whether that, and enthusiasm among Democrats for the presidential race, helps flip it. Sen. Scott Wilk, who represents the district in its current boundaries, pulled off a win as a Republican in a district with a Democratic majority in 2016 — though just barely. The new district lines give Wilk’s former Democratic opponent, Kipp Mueller, another shot at the seat, as Wilk reaches his term limit.\n\nMueller’s resume includes working for the U.S. Department of Justice consumer protection branch under President Barack Obama, and as a workers rights and pro bono asylum attorney with the Catholic Charities of Los Angeles Esperanza Immigrant Rights Project.\n\nHe’s running against Suzette Martinez Valladares, a former Republican Assemblymember who lost her reelection bid by about 500 votes to Assemblymember Pilar Schiavo in 2022. Valladares was the executive director of Southern California Autism Speaks before her time in the Assembly.\n\nKey Endorsements\n\nKipp Mueller\n\nCalifornia Environmental Voters\n\nCalifornia Nurses Association\n\nState Building and Construction Trades Council\n\nSEIU California\n\nSuzette Martinez Valladares\n\nSen.

The densely populated area is home to many low-income and working-class communities. With their proximity to many highways and Los Angeles International Airport, the cities in the district share concerns about pollution and environmental justice, as well as affordability and cost of living.\n\nVoter registration: 58.7% Democrat, 11.7% Republican, 21.7% no party preference\n\nThe Scoop\n\nPrimary results: Laura Richardson 27.8%, Michelle Chambers 24.5%\n\nLaura Richardson, who served in the Assembly in 2006 for a year before being elected to Congress in a special election in 2007 and serving until 2013, is looking to make a comeback to the Legislature to replace Sen. Steven Bradford, who is leaving due to term limits. But some local leaders are reminding voters of Richardson’s past controversies, according to LA Magazine: alleged attacks on her LGBTQ+ opponent (which she denied), and a reprimanded and fine by the House Ethics Committee for misusing her staff members to work on her 2010 campaign. Richardson is endorsed by Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass.\n\nIn the primary, Richardson led fellow Democrat Michelle Chambers by more than 3,000 votes in this safe blue district. Chambers has worked as the external affairs manager for the California Department of Justice.\n\nWhoever wins this seat may have big shoes to fill of Bradford, who has been a leading force in work on reparations for descendants of Black Americans who were enslaved in the United States. Both Chambers and Richardson have said they support concepts of the reparations package, including cash payments, free public college tuition and paying fair market value for jail and prison labor, according to the Los Angeles Times. Bradford has endorsed Chambers.\n\nKey Endorsements\n\nMichelle Chambers\n\nCalifornia Teachers Association\n\nDolores Huerta, United Farm Workers co-founder\n\nCalifornia Democratic Party\n\n​California YIMBY\n\nSen.
