        "text": "Ronald Reagan had quite a prolific career, having catapulted from a Warner Bros. contract player and television star, into serving as president of the Screen Actors Guild, the governorship of California (1967-1975), and lastly, two terms as President of the United States (1981-1989).\n\nRonald Wilson Reagan was born in Tampico, Illinois, to Nelle Clyde (Wilson) and John Edward \"Jack\" Reagan, who was a salesman and storyteller. His father was of Irish descent, and his mother was of half Scottish and half English ancestry.\n\nA successful actor beginning in the 1930s, the young Reagan was a staunch admirer of President Franklin D. Roosevelt (even after he evolved into a Republican), and was a Democrat in the 1940s, a self-described 'hemophiliac' liberal. He was elected president of the Screen Actors Guild in 1947 and served five years during the most tumultuous times to ever hit Hollywood. A committed anti-communist, Reagan not only fought more-militantly activist movie industry unions that he and others felt had been infiltrated by communists, but had to deal with the investigation into Hollywood's politics launched by the House Un-American Activities Committee in 1947, an inquisition that lasted through the 1950s. The House Un-American Activities Committee investigations of Hollywood (which led to the jailing of the \"Hollywood Ten\" in the late '40s) sowed the seeds of the McCarthyism that racked Hollywood and America in the 1950s.\n\nIn 1950, U.S. Representative Helen Gahagan Douglas (D-CA), the wife of \"Dutch\" Reagan's friend Melvyn Douglas, ran as a Democrat for the U.S. Senate and was opposed by the Republican nominee, the Red-bating Congressman from Whittier, Richard Nixon. While Nixon did not go so far as to accuse Gahagan Douglas of being a communist herself, he did charge her with being soft on communism due to her opposition to the House Un-American Activities Committee. Nixon tarred her as a \"fellow traveler\" of communists, a \"pinko\" who was \"pink right down to her underwear.\" Gahagan Douglas was defeated by the man she was the first to call \"Tricky Dicky\" because of his unethical behavior and dirty campaign tactics. Reagan was on the Douglases' side during that campaign.\n\nThe Douglases, like Reagan and such other prominent actors as Humphrey Bogart and Edward G. Robinson, were liberal Democrats, supporters of the late Franklin D. Roosevelt and his New Deal, a legacy that increasingly was under attack by the right after World War II. They were NOT fellow-travelers; Melvyn Douglas had actually been an active anti-communist and was someone the communists despised. Melvyn Douglas, Robinson and Henry Fonda - a registered Republican! - wound up \"gray-listed.\" (They weren't explicitly black-listed, they just weren't offered any work.) Reagan, who it was later revealed had been an F.B.I. informant while a union leader (turning in suspected communists), was never hurt that way, as he made S.A.G. an accomplice of the black-listing.\n\nReagan's career sagged after the late 1940s, and he started appearing in B-movies after he left Warner Bros. to go free-lance. However, he had a eminence grise par excellence in Lew Wasserman, his agent and the head of the Music Corp. of America. Wasserman, later called \"The Pope of Hollywood,\" was the genius who figured out that an actor could make a killing via a tax windfall by turning himself into a corporation. The corporation, which would employ the actor, would own part of a motion picture the actor appeared in, and all monies would accrue to the corporation, which was taxed at a much lower rate than was personal income. Wasserman pioneered this tax avoidance scheme with his client James Stewart, beginning with the Anthony Mann western Winchester 73 (1950) (1950). It made Stewart enormously rich as he became a top box office draw in the 1950s after the success of \"Winchester 73\" and several more Mann-directed westerns, all of which he had an ownership stake in.\n\nIronically, Reagan became a poor-man's James Stewart in the early 1950s, appearing in westerns, but they were mostly B-pictures. He did not have the acting chops of the great Stewart, but he did have his agent. Wasserman at M.C.A. was one of the pioneers of television syndication, and this was to benefit Reagan enormously. M.C.A. was the only talent agency that was also allowed to be a producer through an exemption to union rules granted by S.A.G. when Reagan was the union president, and it used the exemption to acquire Universal International Pictures. Talent agents were not permitted to be producers as there was an inherent conflict of interest between the two professions, one of which was committed to acquiring talent at the lowest possible cost and the other whose focus was to get the best possible price for their client. When a talent agent was also a producer, like M.C.A. was, it had a habit of steering its clients to its own productions, where they were employed but at a lower price than their potential free market value. It was a system that made M.C.A. and Lew Wasserman, enormously wealthy.\n\nThe ownership of Universal and its entry into the production of television shows that were syndicated to network made M.C.A. the most successful organization in Hollywood of its time, a real cash cow as television overtook the movies as the #1 business of the entertainment industry. Wasserman repaid Ronald Reagan's largess by structuring a deal by which he hosted and owned part of General Electric Theater (1953), a western omnibus showcase that ran from 1954 to 1961. It made Reagan very comfortable financially, though it did not make him rich. That came later.\n\nIn 1960, with the election of the Democratic President John F. Kennedy, the black and gray lists went into eclipse. J.F.K. appointed Helen Gahagan Douglas Treasurer of the United States. About this time, as the civil rights movement became stronger and found more support among Democrats and the Kennedy administration, Reagan - fresh from a second stint as S.A.G. president in 1959 - was in the process of undergoing a personal and political metamorphosis into a right-wing Republican, a process that culminated with his endorsing Barry Goldwater for the Republican presidential nomination in 1964. (He narrated a Goldwater campaign film played at the G.O.P. Convention in San Francisco.) Reagan's evolution into a right-wing Republican sundered his friendship with the Douglases. (After Reagan was elected President of the United States in 1980, Melvyn Douglas said of his former friend that Reagan turned to the right after he had begun to believe the pro-business speeches he delivered for General Electric when he was the host of the \"G.E. Theater.\")\n\nIn 1959, while Reagan was back as a second go-round as S.A.G. president, M.C.A.'s exemption from S.A.G. regulations that forbade a talent agency from being a producer was renewed. However, in 1962, the U.S. Justice Department under Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy successfully forced M.C.A. - known as \"The Octopus\" in Hollywood for its monopolistic tendencies - to divest itself of its talent agency.\n\nWhen Reagan was tipped by the California Republican Party to be its standard-bearer in the 1965 gubernatorial election against Democratic Governor Pat Brown, Lew Wasserman went back in action. Politics makes strange bedfellows, and though Wasserman was a liberal Democrat, having an old friend like Reagan who had shown his loyalty as S.A.G. president in the state house was good for business. Wasserman and his partner, M.C.A. Chairman Jules Styne (a Republican), helped ensure that Reagan would be financially secure for the rest of his life so that he could enter politics. (At the time, he was the host of \"Death Valley Days\" on TV.)\n\nAccording to the Wall Street Journal, Universal sold Reagan a nice piece of land of many acres north of Santa Barbara that had been used for location shooting. The Reagans sold most of the ranch, then converted the rest of it, about 200 acres, into a magnificent estate overlooking the valley and the Pacific Ocean. The Rancho del Cielo became President Reagan's much needed counterpoint to the buzz of Washington, D.C. There, in a setting both rugged and serene, the Reagans could spend time alone or receive political leaders such as the Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev, Margaret Thatcher, and others.\n\nReagan was known to the world for his one-liners, the most famous of them was addressed to Mikhail Gorbachev in 1987. \"Mister Gorbachev, tear down this wall\" said Reagan standing in front of the Berlin Wall. That call made an impact on the course of human history.\n\nRonald Reagan played many roles in his life's seven acts: radio announcer, movie star, union boss, television actor-cum-host, governor, right-wing critic of big government and President of the United States.\n\nWith an almost unpronounceable surname and a thick Austrian accent, who would have ever believed that a brash, quick talking bodybuilder from a small European village would become one of Hollywood's biggest stars, marry into the prestigious Kennedy family, amass a fortune via shrewd investments and one day be the Governor of California!?\n\nThe amazing story of megastar Arnold Schwarzenegger is a true \"rags to riches\" tale of a penniless immigrant making it in the land of opportunity, the United States of America. Arnold Alois Schwarzenegger was born July 30, 1947, in the town of Thal, Styria, Austria, to Aurelia Schwarzenegger (born Jadrny) and Gustav Schwarzenegger, the local police chief. From a young age, he took a keen interest in physical fitness and bodybuilding, going on to compete in several minor contests in Europe. However, it was when he emigrated to the United States in 1968 at the tender age of 21 that his star began to rise.\n\nUp until the early 1970s, bodybuilding had been viewed as a rather oddball sport, or even a mis-understood \"freak show\" by the general public, however two entrepreneurial Canadian brothers Ben Weider and Joe Weider set about broadening the appeal of \"pumping iron\" and getting the sport respect, and what better poster boy could they have to lead the charge, then the incredible \"Austrian Oak\", Arnold Schwarzenegger. Over roughly the next decade, beginning in 1970, Schwarzenegger dominated the sport of competitive bodybuilding winning five Mr. Universe titles and seven Mr. Olympia titles and, with it, he made himself a major sports icon, he generated a new international audience for bodybuilding, gym memberships worldwide swelled by the tens of thousands and the Weider sports business empire flourished beyond belief and reached out to all corners of the globe. However, Schwarzenegger's horizons were bigger than just the landscape of bodybuilding and he debuted on screen as \"Arnold Strong\" in the low budget Hercules in New York (1970), then director Bob Rafelson cast Arnold in Mister Universum (1976) alongside Jeff Bridges and Sally Field, for which Arnold won a Golden Globe Award for \"Best Acting Debut in a Motion Picture\". The mesmerizing Pumping Iron (1977) covering the 1975 Mr Olympia contest in South Africa has since gone on to become one of the key sports documentaries of the 20th century, plus Arnold landed other acting roles in the comedy Kaktus Jack (1979) opposite Kirk Douglas, and he portrayed Mickey Hargitay in the well- received TV movie Die Jayne Mansfield Story (1980).\n\nWhat Arnold really needed was a super hero / warrior style role in a lavish production that utilized his chiseled physique, and gave him room to show off his growing acting talents and quirky humor. Conan, der Barbar (1982) was just that role. Inspired by the Robert E. Howard short stories of the \"Hyborean Age\" and directed by gung ho director John Milius, and with a largely unknown cast, save Max von Sydow and James Earl Jones, \"Conan\" was a smash hit worldwide and an inferior, although still enjoyable sequel titled Conan der Zerstörer (1984) quickly followed. If \"Conan\" was the kick start to Arnold's movie career, then his next role was to put the pedal to the floor and accelerate his star status into overdrive. Director James Cameron had until that time only previously directed one earlier feature film titled Fliegende Killer - Piranha II (1982), which stank of rotten fish from start to finish. However, Cameron had penned a fast paced, science fiction themed film script that called for an actor to play an unstoppable, ruthless predator - Terminator (1984). Made on a relatively modest budget, the high voltage action / science fiction thriller Terminator (1984) was incredibly successful worldwide, and began one of the most profitable film franchises in history. The dead pan phrase \"I'll be back\" quickly became part of popular culture across the globe. Schwarzenegger was in vogue with action movie fans, and the next few years were to see Arnold reap box office gold in roles portraying tough, no-nonsense individuals who used their fists, guns and witty one-liners to get the job done. The testosterone laden Phantom Kommando (1985), Der City Hai (1986), Predator (1987), Running Man (1987) and Red Heat (1988) were all box office hits and Arnold could seemingly could no wrong when it came to picking winning scripts. The tongue-in-cheek comedy Twins - Zwillinge (1988) with co-star Danny DeVito was a smash and won Arnold new fans who saw a more comedic side to the muscle- bound actor once described by Australian author / TV host Clive James as \"a condom stuffed with walnuts\". The spectacular Total Recall - Die totale Erinnerung (1990) and \"feel good\" Kindergarten Cop (1990) were both solid box office performers for Arnold, plus he was about to return to familiar territory with director James Cameron in Terminator 2: Tag der Abrechnung (1991). The second time around for the futuristic robot, the production budget had grown from the initial film's $6.5 million to an alleged $100 million for the sequel, and it clearly showed as the stunning sequel bristled with amazing special effects, bone-crunching chases & stunt sequences, plus state of the art computer-generated imagery. Terminator 2: Tag der Abrechnung (1991) was arguably the zenith of Arnold's film career to date and he was voted \"International Star of the Decade\" by the National Association of Theatre Owners.\n\nRemarkably, his next film Last Action Hero (1993) brought Arnold back to Earth with a hard thud as the self-satirizing, but confusing plot line of a young boy entering into a mythical Hollywood action film confused movie fans even more and they stayed away in droves making the film an initial financial disaster. Arnold turned back to good friend, director James Cameron and the chemistry was definitely still there as the \"James Bond\" style spy thriller True Lies - Wahre Lügen (1994) co-starring Jamie Lee Curtis and Tom Arnold was the surprise hit of 1994! Following the broad audience appeal of True Lies - Wahre Lügen (1994), Schwarzenegger decided to lean towards more family-themed entertainment with Junior (1994) and Versprochen ist versprochen (1996), but he still found time to satisfy his hard-core fan base with Eraser (1996), as the chilling \"Mr. Freeze\" in Batman & Robin (1997) and battling dark forces in the supernatural action of End of Days - Nacht ohne morgen (1999). The science fiction / conspiracy tale The 6th Day (2000) played to only mediocre fan interest, and Collateral Damage - Zeit der Vergeltung (2002) had its theatrical release held over for nearly a year after the tragic events of Sept 11th 2001, but it still only received a lukewarm reception.\n\nIt was time again to resurrect Arnold's most successful franchise and, in 2003, Schwarzenegger pulled on the biker leathers for the third time for Terminator 3: Rebellion der Maschinen (2003). Unfortunately, directorial duties passed from James Cameron to Jonathan Mostow and the deletion of the character of \"Sarah Connor\" aka Linda Hamilton and a change in the actor playing \"John Connor\" - Nick Stahl took over from Edward Furlong - making the third entry in the \"Terminator\" series the weakest to date.\n\nSchwarzenegger married TV journalist Maria Shriver in April, 1986 and the couple have four children.\n\nIn October of 2003 Schwarzenegger, running as a Republican, was elected Governor of California in a special recall election of then governor Gray Davis. The \"Governator,\" as Schwarzenegger came to be called, held the office until 2011. Upon leaving the Governor's mansion it was revealed that he had fathered a child with the family's live-in maid and Shriver filed for divorce.\n\nSchwarzenegger contributed cameo roles to Welcome to the Jungle (2003), In 80 Tagen um die Welt (2004) and The Kid & I (2005). Recently, he starred in The Expendables 2 (2012), The Last Stand (2013), Escape Plan (2013), The Expendables 3 (2014), and Terminator - Genisys (2015).\n\nClinton Eastwood Jr. was born May 31, 1930 in San Francisco, to Clinton Eastwood Sr., a bond salesman and later manufacturing executive for Georgia-Pacific Corporation, and Ruth Wood (née Margret Ruth Runner), a housewife turned IBM clerk. He grew up in nearby Piedmont. At school Clint took interest in music and mechanics, but was an otherwise bored student; this resulted in being held back a grade. In 1949, the year he is said to have graduated from high school, his parents and younger sister Jeanne moved to Seattle. Clint spent a couple years in the Pacific Northwest himself, operating log broncs in Springfield, Oregon, with summer gigs life-guarding in Renton, Washington. Returning to California in 1951, he did a two-year stint at Fort Ord Military Reservation and later enrolled at L.A. City College, but dropped out to pursue acting.\n\nDuring the mid-1950s he landed uncredited bit parts in such B-films as Die Rache des Ungeheuers (1955) and Tarantula (1955) while digging swimming pools and driving a garbage truck to supplement his income. In 1958, he landed his first consequential acting role in the long-running TV show Tausend Meilen Staub (1959) with Eric Fleming. Although only a secondary player the first seven seasons, he was promoted to series star when Fleming departed--both literally and figuratively--in its final year, along the way becoming a recognizable face to television viewers around the country.\n\nEastwood's big-screen breakthrough came as The Man with No Name in Sergio Leone's trilogy of excellent spaghetti westerns: Für eine Handvoll Dollar (1964), Für ein paar Dollar mehr (1965), and Zwei glorreiche Halunken (1966). The movies were shown exclusively in Italy during their respective copyright years with Enrico Maria Salerno providing the voice of Eastwood's character, finally getting American distribution in 1967-68. As the last film racked up respectable grosses, Eastwood, 37, rose from a barely registering actor to sought-after commodity in just a matter of months. Again a success was the late-blooming star's first U.S.-made western, Hängt ihn höher (1968). He followed that up with the lead role in Coogans großer Bluff (1968) (the loose inspiration for the TV series Ein Sheriff in New York (1970)), before playing second fiddle to Richard Burton in the World War II epic Agenten sterben einsam (1968) and Lee Marvin in the bizarre musical Westwärts zieht der Wind (1969). In Ein Fressen für die Geier (1970) and Stoßtrupp Gold (1970), Eastwood leaned in an experimental direction by combining tough-guy action with offbeat humor.\n\n1971 proved to be his busiest year in film. He starred as a sleazy Union soldier in Betrogen (1971) to critical acclaim, and made his directorial debut with the classic erotic thriller Sadistico (1971). His role as the hard edge police inspector in Dirty Harry (1971), meanwhile, boosted him to cultural icon status and helped popularize the loose-cannon cop genre. Eastwood put out a steady stream of entertaining movies thereafter: the westerns Sinola (1972), Ein Fremder ohne Namen (1973) and Der Texaner (1976) (his first of six onscreen collaborations with then live-in love Sondra Locke), the Dirty Harry sequels Calahan (1973) and Dirty Harry III - Der Unerbittliche (1976), the action-packed road adventures Die Letzten beißen die Hunde (1974) and Der Mann, der niemals aufgibt (1977), and the prison film Flucht von Alcatraz (1979). He branched out into the comedy genre in 1978 with Der Mann aus San Fernando (1978), which became the biggest hit of his career up to that time; taking inflation into account, it still is. In short, Im Auftrag des Drachen (1975) notwithstanding, the 1970s were nonstop success for Eastwood.\n\nEastwood kicked off the 1980s with Mit Vollgas nach San Fernando (1980), the blockbuster sequel to Every Which Way but Loose. The fourth Dirty Harry film, Dirty Harry IV - Dirty Harry kommt zurück (1983), was the highest-grossing film of the franchise and spawned his trademark catchphrase: \"Make my day.\" He also starred in Bronco billy (1980), Firefox (1982), Der Wolf hetzt die Meute (1984), City Heat - Der Bulle und der Schnüffler (1984), Pale Rider - Der namenlose Reiter (1985) and Heartbreak Ridge (1986), all of which were solid hits, with Honkytonk Man (1982) being his only commercial failure of the period. In 1988, he did his fifth and final Dirty Harry movie, Das Todesspiel (1988). Although it was a success overall, it did not have the box office punch the previous films had. About this time, with outright bombs like Pink Cadillac (1989) and Rookie - Der Anfänger (1990), it seemed Eastwood's star was declining as it never had before. He then started taking on low-key projects, directing Bird (1988), a biopic of Charlie Parker that earned him a Golden Globe, and starring in and directing Weißer Jäger, schwarzes Herz (1990), an uneven, loose biopic of John Huston (both films had a limited release).\n\nEastwood bounced back big time with his dark western Erbarmungslos (1992), which garnered the then 62-year-old his first ever Academy Award nomination (Best Actor), and an Oscar win for Best Director. Churning out a quick follow-up hit, he took on the secret service in In the Line of Fire: Die zweite Chance (1993), then accepted second billing for the first time since 1970 in the interesting but poorly received Perfect World (1993) with Kevin Costner. Next was a love story, Die Brücken am Fluss (1995), where Eastwood surprised audiences with a sensitive performance alongside none other than Meryl Streep. But it soon became apparent he was going backwards after his brief revival. Subsequent films were credible, but nothing really stuck out. Absolute Power (1997) and Space Cowboys (2000) did well enough, while Ein wahres Verbrechen (1999) and Blood Work (2002) were received badly, as was Mitternacht im Garten von Gut und Böse (1997), which he directed but didn't appear in.\n\nEastwood surprised again in the mid-2000s, returning to the top of the A-list with Million Dollar Baby (2004). Also starring Hilary Swank and Morgan Freeman, the hugely successful drama won four Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Director for Eastwood. He scored his second Best Actor nomination, too. His next starring vehicle, Gran Torino (2008), earned almost $30 million in its opening weekend and was his highest grosser unadjusted for inflation. 2012 saw him in a rare lighthearted movie, Back in the Game (2012), as well as a reality show, Mrs. Eastwood & Company (2012).\n\nBetween acting jobs, he chalked up an impressive list of credits behind the camera. He directed Mystic River (2003) (in which Sean Penn and Tim Robbins gave Oscar-winning performances), Flags of Our Fathers (2006), Letters from Iwo Jima (2006) (nominated for the Best Picture Oscar), Der fremde Sohn (2008) (a vehicle for Angelina Jolie), Invictus - Unbezwungen (2009) (again with Freeman), Hereafter - Das Leben danach (2010), J. Edgar (2011), Jersey Boys (2014), American Sniper (2014) (2014's top box office champ), Sully (2016) (starring Tom Hanks as hero pilot Chesley Sullenberger) and 15:17 to Paris (2018). Back on screens after a considerable absence, he played an unlikely drug courier in The Mule (2018), which reached the top of the box office with a nine-figure gross, then directed Der Fall Richard Jewell (2019). At age 91, Eastwood made history as the oldest actor to star above the title in a movie with the release of Cry Macho (2021).\n\nAway from the limelight, Eastwood has led an aberrant existence and is described by biographer Patrick McGilligan as a cunning manipulator of the media. His convoluted slew of partners and children are now somewhat factually acknowledged, but for the first three decades of his celebrity, his personal life was kept top secret, and several of his families were left out of the official narrative. The actor refuses to disclose his exact number of offspring even to this day. He had a longtime relationship with similarly abstruse co-star Locke (who died aged 74 in 2018, though for her entire public life she masqueraded about being younger), and has fathered at least eight children by at least six different women in an unending string of liaisons, many of which overlapped. He has been married only twice, however, with a mere three of his progeny coming from those unions.\n\nHis known children are: Laurie Murray (b. 1954), whose mother is unidentified; Kimber Eastwood (b. 1964) with stuntwoman Roxanne Tunis; Kyle Eastwood (b. 1968) and Alison Eastwood (b. 1972) with his first ex-wife, Margaret Neville Johnson; Scott Eastwood (b. 1986) and Kathryn Eastwood (b. 1988) with stewardess Jacelyn Reeves; Francesca Eastwood (b. 1993) with actress Frances Fisher; and Morgan Eastwood (b. 1996) with his second ex-wife, Dina Eastwood. The entire time that he lived with Locke she was legally married to sculptor Gordon Anderson.\n\nEastwood has real estate holdings in Bel-Air, La Quinta, Carmel-by-the-Sea, Cassel (in remote northern California), Idaho's Sun Valley and Kihei, Hawaii.\n\nJohn Davis Lodge was the grandson of Massachusetts Senator Henry Cabot Lodge ) and the brother of Henry Cabot Lodge Jr.\n\nThere was a saying in Boston, portraying the capital of the Bay State as \"the land of the bean & the cod/Where the Lodges talk only to the Cabots/And the Cabots talk only to God.\" John Lodge was both a Cabot AND a Lodge, a thorough and thoroughly bred blue-blood to boot. However, before realizing that politics flowed through his veins, John Lodge - who was born in Washington, D.C. - humored himself with acting, that other public speaking sport that ranks among the world's oldest professions, and it was as an actor that the general public first got to know him.\n\nJohn was born a year after his brother, debuting in the world on October 20, 1903. His father was the patrician playwright and poet George Lodge and his mother was the former Matilda Frelinghuysen Davis. He grew up in Washington and in Paris before being educated at the Evans School in Mesa, Arizona and the Middlesex School in Concord, Massachusetts. He attended Harvard College (Class of 1925) and Harvard Law School ('29), with a year of graduate study at Paris' Ecole de Droit in between. At Middlesex, he had indulged his interest in school theatricals, and he continued as an amateur thespian while matriculating at Harvard, playing leads in Hasty Pudding Club shows and French Club productions.\n\nIt was in Cambridge, Massachusetts during his undergraduate days that he met his future wife, the Italian-born Francesca Braggioti. While men played female roles in drag at Hasty Pudding Club shows, this was not so at the French Club theatricals (where the plays were presented in the French tongue). Francesca, who was both a dancer and a choreographer, often appeared in the French Club plays when there was wont of a female. The couple were married in 1929.\n\nThe newlyweds settled in New York City, where Lodge obtained employment as a law clerk in a prestigious Wall Street firm. In 1930, the couple's daughter Lily Lodge, a future actress and drama coach, entered the world with a kick of her wee legs and a hearty scream. Lily's mama Francesca, ever the trouper, pursued her own dance career after recovering from the birth, branching out into acting on Broadway and at small theaters when she wasn't kicking up her own heels. While Lilly's papa John didn't join his wife for any professional tripping of the light fantastic, he did indulge his own acting bones by joining Francesca in the New York Amateur Comedy Club's production of Noël Coward's \"The Young Idea.\" The Coward comedy (the credits for which claim \"The Snarks\" as producer) played three performances on Broadway in March 1932.\n\nIt was the Great Depression, and despite John Lodge's patrician background, Francesca felt the need to generate some coin (gold specie wasn't outlawed until 1933 by President Franklin D. Roosevelt - Groton '00; Harvard '03, though he claimed allegiance to the Class of '04 despite finishing his undergraduate studies in three years - who most people of Lodge's class considered a class traitor) by hiring on to dub Greta Garbo's newly made sound films into Italian. Garbo had been a silent-film superstar in Francesca's native Italy, and the task was an important one, as the proper presentation of a speaking Garbo was critical to her future success in Italy. The job necessitated that Francesca move to Culver City, California for six months to perform the task at the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer studio.\n\nThus, fate intervened in John Lodge's life, separate from the accident of his birth. In the late summer of 1932, he took a vacation to California to join Francesca. In Santa Monica, while playing in a celebrity tennis tournament, he was spotted by talent agent Ad Schulberg. Lodge agreed to a screen-test, which was scripted by his prep school buddy John Lee Mahin, a successful screenwriter. The screen-test led to an offer of a six-month contract from Paramount Pictures at $75 a week.\n\nLodge's patrician family was aghast that he would even think of such as thing as leaving his law career for the then-disreputable \"profession\" of movie-making. For six weeks, Lodge dithered over accepting the offer. Paramount, anxious to sign the tall and handsome blue-blood, upped its offer to $275 a week (approximately $3,300/week in 2005 dollars), which at the time was a considerably greater sum than most New York City lawyers earned. Lodge signed the contact. While he did understand his family's dismay over his uprooting himself from a respectable avocation in the upright and proper Establishment East for a Prodigal Son-like journey to the Babylon on the sun-kissed and faintly wicked Left Coast to live the life of a Hollywood player, what he didn't count on was Mae West. His family was concerned over his new career route, while - if gossip was correct - Miss West was sure to be concerned over another root entirely.\n\nAs soon as the Paramount publicity department began ballyhooing the signing of their latest discovery, Mae West - who was not only Paramount's biggest star but had single-handedly taken the studio out of bankruptcy - decided she wanted the handsome young Lodge to play the male lead in her new movie, \"She Done Him Wrong,\" an adaptation of her notorious stage hit \"Diamond Lil.\" Lodge heard about West's interest, and as he was in no desire himself to further humiliate his family by associating with the notorious Mae West (West had been arrested and jailed for obscenity in New York in 1928 over her play \"Sex\"), he decided to nix the role. Lodge informed Paramount that he would not accept West's offer to co-star in her new picture and that he would prefer to learn the movie-acting craft by being cast initially in smaller parts.\n\nNo unknown had ever turned down such a big role before, but Paramount acquiesced. Lodge would later express regrets over his refusal of the part in \"She Done Him Wrong,\" which became one of the top box office hits of 1933 and made the man whom Mae West chose to replace him in the role - Cary Grant - a star. Her first film at Paramount, \"Night After Night,\" had introduced George Raft to Hollywood. No, John Lodge never became a star, but he did become the governor of Connecticut. Politics turned out to be his fate, after all. But before that milestone, there were movies to make, and a war to be fought.\n\nAfter making three minor pictures at Paramount, the studio lent him out to R.K.O, where he made George Cukor's classic \"Little Women\" (1933). The apogee of his career came in 1934-35, when he appeared in two more classics: Josef von Sternberg's \"The Scarlet Empress\" (1934) in support of the legendary Marlene Dietrich at Paramount, and \"The Little Colonel' at 20th Century-Fox, where he portrayed the father of another future actor-turned-politician (and yet another screen legend), Shirley Temple. That was about it. He made one more movie for Paramount, the mystery \"Menace\" (1934), and then became a freelance. In all, he appeared in 21 movies altogether between 1932 and 1940, including several that were shot in Europe, such as Maurice Tourneur's \"Königsmark\" (1935), which was made in France, and \"Bulldog Drummond at Bay\" (1937) and \"Queer Cargo\" (1938), which were shot in Great Britain. (John Lodge thus becomes an answer to a trivia question: name the actors who have played Bulldog Drummond.)\n\nIn January 1941, Lodge returned to Broadway after his less than auspicious 1932 interlude to appear as \"The Young Man\" in the musical \"Night of Love.\" The musical, produced by the Schuberts, lasted twice as long as Lodge's previous engagement, closing after seven performances. He had better luck in his next play, Lillian Hellman's anti-fascist drama \"Watch on the Rhine,\" in which he played David Farrelly. The play opened at the Martin Beck Theatre on April 1, 1941 and closed eleven months later, on February 21, 1942, bowing out after a total of 378 performances. John Lodge was ending his acting career with a hit.\n\nWorld War II came to the United States during the run of his last play, and Lodge became a naval officer in August 1942. Capitalizing on his language skills and his molarity with Europe, the U.S. Navy made Lodge a liaison officer between the French and U.S. Fleets. In his over-three-years of service, Lodge reached the rank of Lieutenant Commander and was decorated with the rank of Chevalier in the French Legion of Honor and with the Croix de Guerre with Palm by General Charles de Gaulle. (He would later make the rank of Captain in the U.S Naval Reserve.) After he was demobilized, in January 1946, Lodge made his home in of Westport, Connecticut and joined the family business: politics.\n\nIn November 1946, he became the second movie actor ever elected to high office, winning a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives as a Republican. (The Democrat Helen Gahagan Douglas had become the first when she was elected from California's 14th District in 1944.) He won a second term in 1948, but resigned his seat in 1950 to run for governor. He was elected, and took office as Connecticut's 50th governor in January 1951. His wife, Francesca, proved to be the most active First Lady in Connecticut history, opening the governor's mansion to the public. She served as a patron of the arts, promoting concerts and theater and serving as a founding member of the American Shakespeare Festival in Stratford, Connecticut.\n\nAfter his bid for a second gubernatorial term ended in defeat in 1954, President Eisenhower appointed Lodge U.S. Ambassador to Spain, where he served from 1955 to 1961. While the Republicans were out of power in Washington during the 1960s, Lodge was the National President of Junior Achievement, Inc. from 1963-64, served as a Delegate and Floor Leader at the 1965 Connecticut Constitutional Convention, and was the Chairman of the Committee on Foreign Policy Research Institute at the University of Pennsylvania from 1964-69. After Nixon was elected President in 1968, he appointed Lodge as U.S. Ambassador to Argentina, where he served from 1969 to 1974. Later, for the most successful actor-cum-politician in history, President Ronald Reagan, he served as the U.S. Ambassador to Switzerland from 1983-85 and as a member of the U.S delegation to the United Nations. (Lodge's tours as the ambassador to Spain and Switzerland were fitting, as he was a bigger star in Europe than he had ever been in the United States.)\n\nJohn Davis Lodge died in New York City on October 29, 1985, nine days after his 83rd birthday, and was buried at Arlington National Cemetery. The Connecticut Turnpike (Interstate-95) was named the Governor John Davis Lodge Turnpike in his honor. His widow, Francesca Lodge, died on February 25, 1998 at her home in Marbella, Spain. She was 95 years old.\n\nAmitabh Bachchan was born on October 11, 1942 in Allahabad, British India (present-day Prayagraj, Uttar Pradesh, India) to legendary poet Harivansh Rai Bachchan & Teji Bachchan. He also has a brother named Ajitabh. He completed his education from Uttar Pradesh and moved to Bombay to find work as a film star, in vain though, as film-makers preferred someone with a fairer skin, and he was not quite fair enough. But they did use one of his other assets, his deep baritone voice, which was used for narration and background commentary. He was successful in being cast in Saat Hindustani. He got his break in Bollywood after a letter of introduction from the then Prime Minister Mrs. Indira Gandhi, as he was a friend of her son, Rajiv Gandhi. This is how Bachchan made an entry in Bollywood, starting with Zanjeer, co-starred with his future wife Jaya Bhaduri, and since then there has been no looking back.\n\nHe married Jaya Bhaduri, an accomplished actress in her own right, and they had two children, Shweta and Abhishek. Shweta is married, lives a non-filmy life and has two children.\n\nBeing friends with Rajiv Gandhi, got him to decide to run for seat in the Indian National Congress (political party) from his home town but had to leave mid-term because of controversies, particularly after Rajiv and he were implicated in the now infamous \"Bofors\" case along with the U. K. based Hinduja Brothers.\n\nAfter a four year break, he was back in the unsuccessful Mrityudaata (1997), a comeback which the actor wanted to forget. Critics written him off but his career was saved with Bade Miyan Chote Miyan (1998). But four flops in 1999 and incurring debt of over 90 crore rupees of his sinking company ABCL saw him at an all-time low. To make matters worse, after the defeat of the Congress party, Bachchan lost considerable political support, the opposition made him a target, and his credit rating deteriorated to such an extent that a leading nationalized bank, Canara Bank, sued him for outstanding loans. He did bounce back, presenting the Indian version of Who Wants To Be A Millionaire called Kaun Banega Crorepati? (2000). After a series of hits with Denn meine Liebe ist unsterblich (2000), In guten wie in schweren Tagen (2001) and Baghban - Und am Abend wartet das Glück (2003) and Khakee - Das tödliche Gesetz Indiens (2004), Bachchan is showing no signs of slowing down and proving the critics wrong once again.\n\nAmitabh and Jaya were interested in getting their son Abhishek married to Karisma Kapoor, the daughter of Babita and Randhir Kapoor, they went through a formal engagement, but later broke it off.\n\nThe former Miss World and Bollywood actress, Aishwarya Rai and Abhishek, were formally engaged on Sunday January 14, 2007, at the Bachchan residence in Juhu, Bombay, with the marriage taking place at the Bachchan residence on April 20, 2007.\n\nOn November 16, 2011, he became a Dada (paternal grandfather) when Aishwarya gave birth to a daughter in a Mumbai Hospital. He is already a Nana (maternal grandfather) to Navya and Agastye - Shweta's children.\n\nHe continues to be one of the busiest actors and singers in Bollywood as well as on TV, as can be seen from the commercials that he appears on, especially on Sahara One. Looks like there are no limits for this super-star and once the \"Angry Young Man\" of Bollywood.\n\nBaby Boomers remember well the dark-haired, diminutive (4'10\") comedienne Sheila James, who raised a smile with her portrayals of tomboyish kid sisters and boy-crazy high schoolers on late-'50s and early-'60s TV. For a while she was a huge hit, backed by her characters' plaintive, pony-tailed presences, strategies, and sheer persistence to get what they wanted. In her best known show The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis (1959), Sheila gave plain-Jane teenagers everywhere hope that they too could net the guy of their dreams.\n\nShe was born Sheila James Kuehl on February 9, 1941 in Tulsa, Oklahoma and pursued acting as an adolescent. She started things off with quite a bang at age 10 with a five-season regular role as Stuart Erwin and June Collyer's tomboy daughter Jackie in The Stu Erwin Show (1950). She appeared in her first film (using the stage name of Sheila James) at age 12 with an unbilled role in Those Redheads from Seattle (1953) and the next year was glimpsed in the MGM classic musical Eine Braut für sieben Brüder (1954). Meanwhile, Sheila made appearances on such TV series as \"Mayor of the Town\", \"My Little Margie\", \"Date with the Angels\", \"The Bob Cummings Show\", \"The Millionaire\", and \"National Velvet\" before landing the role that her famous -- squinchy-nosed high-schooler Zelda Gilroy in The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis (1959). As the obsessed student who only had eyes for the poetic, lovelorn title character (Dwayne Hickman), Zelda's confidence in hooking up with the uninterested Dobie never wavered, despite competition in the form of spoiled, dreamy blonde Tuesday Weld as Thalia Meninger.\n\nSheila was an instant hit as Zelda, so much so that a 1962 pilot entitled \"Zelda\" was filmed as a possible spinoff. However, when Hollywood gossip spread that 21-year-old Sheila was a lesbian, the powers-that-be decided to permanently shelve the project. The actress began to see her popularity, and her ability to find acting jobs, diminish after this. Despite some comedy roles in \"Petticoat Junction\", \"Ozzie and Harriet\", and \"The Donna Reed Show\", she found Hollywood more than reluctant to cast her. She did appear as Sally Ragsdale not to mention her appearance on a 1964 episode of Petticoat Junction (1963) as one of the singing \"Ladybugs\" along with the lovely \"Petticoat Junction girls, Linda Henning, Jeannine Riley, and Pat Woodell. The pretty foursome even took their act to \"The Ed Sullivan Show\" in which they appeared as a mop-haired female version of the Beatles and performed the Fab Four's hit song \"I Saw Her Standing There\" with Henning as drummer \"Ringo Starr,\" Riley as guitarist \"John Lennon,\" Woodell as bassist \"Paul McCartney\", and James as guitarist \"George Harrison\". Sheila would appear in one more regular series, co-starring with Kathleen Nolan of \"The Real McCoys\" fame in the short-lived service comedy Broadside (1964), before seeing the writing on the wall.\n\nAfter the show's quick demise, a practical Sheila decided to take a different direction in her life. She first found a job as a student campus adviser at UCLA which led to her appointment as the college's associate dean. At age 34 (and back to using her real name, Sheila Kuehl), she was admitted into Harvard Law School, where she rose to the top of her class and was elected student council president. Thereafter, Sheila returned on a rare occasion to TV (guest appearances on \"Love American Style\", \"Emergency!\") and film (Der Besuch der reichen Witwe (1988)), a sequel to the popular comedy show in which she and Dobie (Hickman) have married and have a child!\n\nSheila made bold moves into the political arena on feminist issues and went on to serve as the first openly-gay member of the California State Assembly (6 years) and Senate (8 years). She later focused on community programs and policies as Director of the Public Policy Institute at Santa Monica College and played host of the West Hollywood cable show \"Get Used To It\", that dealt with gay people and issues. She also worked in tandem with Planned Parenthood of California in helping to develop legislation. To this day, the former child actress continues to be a strong, vital force in Los Angeles politics."
