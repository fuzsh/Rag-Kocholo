        "text": "David Carr is the Council Member representing the Mid-Island based 50th Councilmanic District. Carr has had a lifelong passion for government and politics and began getting involved in campaigns at the age of 10. He began working in government doing constituent services in the United States House of Representatives. He eventually became the Chief of Staff to then-Assemblyman Joseph Borelli.\n\nCarr went on to serve in that role for former City Council Minority Leader Steven Matteo in 2014. As a focal point of the Mid-Island Council office, Carr managed a broad range of issues from constituent and community matters, to moving legislation in City Hall. In less than seven years, he helped negotiate the passage of 27 of Matteo’s bills, which is a record for a Staten Island Council Member. He also worked closely with many community organizations and city agencies to help the Council member allocate funding and capital resources. He served as Chief of Staff to Matteo for eight years until his election to the Council in November 2021.\n\nSince taking office, Carr’s focus on quality of life projects and financial relief for working New Yorkers in an increasingly challenging fiscal and social landscape has led to numerous headline-filling projects and legislation.\n\n…"
