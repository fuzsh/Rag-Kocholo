        "text": "The Eisenhower Presidential Library has an oral history collection of over 500 transcripts.\n\nThe oral history collection has been built upon two major components: (1) The Eisenhower Presidential Library's own interviews, and, (2) transcripts acquired through a cooperative arrangement with Columbia University's Oral History Project. A third and smaller component consists of a number of oral history interviews donated to the Library by various institutions and individuals.\n\nTranscripts:\n\nThe list of oral history transcripts gives the names of the persons interviewed, the principal positions held by them during the Eisenhower administration or their personal relationship to Dwight D. Eisenhower as documented by their interviews, the date of the interview, and the number of pages in the transcript. Transcripts originating from other institutions are not available on our web page but may be viewed in our research room.\n\nFinding Aids:\n\nFinding aids for the oral history interviews consist of short descriptions prepared by the staff of the Library. Each description lists the ordered subject content of each oral history. Descriptions are available for over two-thirds of the collection.\n\nEL Eisenhower Presidential Library\n\nCOHP Columbia Oral History Project\n\nOTHER Other Institution or Individual"
