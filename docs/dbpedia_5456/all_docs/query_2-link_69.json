Erica currently serves as the Voter Protection Director of the Michigan Democratic Party, defending democracy on multiple fronts statewide.\n\nBefore focusing on voting rights, Erica practiced business law at Pettit & Martin in San Francisco and at Pepper Hamilton in Detroit, where she was a partner. After a detour to Luxembourg for her husband’s job, she devoted herself to community work in food insecurity, college readiness and success, and faith leadership, and was Director of Philanthropy at Gleaners Community Food Bank in Detroit.\n\nErica currently serves on the boards of Promote the Vote, Impact100 Metro Detroit, and the Detroit Jewish Community Relations Council/AJC. She is a past president of Congregation Shir Tikvah in Troy.\n\nErica earned a bachelor’s degree in Humanities from the University of Chicago and a law degree from Stanford Law School. She and her husband David Jaffe are the proud parents of two adult daughters."
