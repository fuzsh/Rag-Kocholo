        "text": "BU Today: Professor Slaughter, from your perspective as a scholar of race and ethnic politics, as well as political psychology, what does Walz bring to the Harris ticket?\n\nSlaughter: It’s important to keep in mind that this, too, is a play thinking about identity politics. Walz has an ability to connect with Midwestern voters, rural voters, male voters, etc. So, he brings not only his experience as a governor—as an executive of a state—but also his ability to balance out a key demographic of the Democratic Party that is important to Vice President Harris’ success in November.\n\nBU Today: The New York Times notes: “Every one of Ms. Harris’s finalists for the job, including Mr. Walz, was a white man who had some record of winning in Republican areas.” What does it say about our national politics that a Black and Indian woman is expected to “balance her ticket” in this way?\n\nSlaughter: Well, first, I think we should recognize the importance of having a Black and Indian woman at the top of the ticket.\n\nBut we saw, even with Barack Obama in 2008 as a multiracial, Black candidate, that he, too, faced the constraint of needing to appoint someone on his ticket that had experience in the Senate and had been a longtime broker of bipartisan politics. So, I think this says today what it said then: there are still constraints on who is able to secure our highest office.\n\nThe other aspect of this, though, is that this is such a condensed campaign. It was [just over] two weeks ago that President Biden exited the presidential contest. And early voting, in some states, starts in September. So, strategically, I think the maneuvers that Harris and the Democrats are able to make are limited.\n\nBU Today: We’ve seen from Trump’s performance at the National Association of Black Journalists conference that Harris will face racist, xenophobic attacks during this campaign. How might Walz fit into this picture, either as a defender of Harris or as a surrogate?\n\nSlaughter: I think we saw that Trump utilized the National Association of Black Journalists to make it appear that he still had the support among Black voters that we’ve seen dissipating since Biden exited the race. It seemed to be an attempt to leech some of the enthusiasm that we’ve seen for Vice President Harris by attacking her identity. But what we know from racial and ethnic politics is that many Black Americans have a strong racial identity, so those attacks actually may have worked in Harris’ favor to hunker down on support for someone who not only is a Black woman, but a South Asian woman, and who has experience in the White House. So, [Trump’s attacks at the NABJ conference] actually gave her some momentum.\n\nNow, how does Walz fit into this picture? Well, for one thing, I think Vice President Harris has shown that the primary role of the vice president is to support the president. So, Walz will be the supporter of candidate Harris in the same way that we saw Biden support Obama and Harris support Biden, and, to a lesser extent, J. D. Vance for Donald Trump.\n\nBU Today: What’s the role, historically, of a vice presidential running mate during the campaign, and how does Walz’s pick fit into those trends?\n\nDavid: Vice presidents can serve a variety of purposes. One of the most important is party unity. If you look at someone like Franklin Roosevelt, he picks John Nance Garner—at that point [early 1930s], a very prominent Democrat from Texas. Roosevelt picks him because Garner represents a more traditional aspect of the Democratic Party. John F. Kennedy did the exact same thing in 1960. So, the idea, “I’m going to pick someone who represents a different part of the party than I do,” is pretty prominent. And I think the idea of the [current] vice president from California picking a Midwesterner is an attempt to capture a chunk of the population where the Democratic Party has really struggled in the last couple years.\n\nThe other thing is that you want someone who has qualities you, being the presidential candidate, don’t [have]. So, famously, in 1952, Dwight Eisenhower was beloved by many Americans. In fact, he still is the modern president with the highest approval ratings. But Eisenhower can’t go out on the campaign trail and say, “Look at my terrible opponent, who’s a monster.” But Richard Nixon, his vice president at the time, can do that. And Nixon’s really good at that. In that case, you want someone who can be the attack dog.\n\nThe other side of that balance is what Trump did in 2016. Trump was very comfortable and was accepted by the public making these aggressive statements. He wanted someone like Mike Pence who can say, “No, I represent a different aspect of the party. I can give legitimacy to this guy. I’m going to seem like the voice of reason.”\n\nSo, Walz is a National Guard veteran. He’s, again, a Midwesterner. He was a union member at one point. He can speak to a rural upbringing, a small-town vision of America that Harris, being from California, can’t.\n\nBU Today: What impact do vice presidential selections typically have on an election?\n\nDavid: We have had some very effective vice presidents. I think back to Kennedy, who narrowly won in 1960. And part of the reason he won that election is because the Democratic Party was fractured going into 1960, they didn’t know who their standard-bearer was going to be. Kennedy pulls it together, and part of the way he signals, “Hey, look, I’m a Democrat you can trust,” is by selecting this immensely popular Democrat from Texas to be his running mate.\n\nBU Today: How does Harris’ selection of Walz compare to Trump’s selection of Vance?"
