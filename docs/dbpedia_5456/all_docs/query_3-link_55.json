        "text": "PASADENA, Calif.— Pasadena Public Health Department (PPHD) has received a report of a dead bat infected with rabies in Pasadena near the intersection of E. Green St. and S. Hudson Ave. There are no reports of rabies in humans and the risk of rabies infection in humans remains low. PPHD advises the public to never touch a bat with bare hands, and to report injured, sick, or dead bats. Summer and early-fall months are when rabid bats are most often found in Los Angeles County, especially during July, August, and September.\n\n“In Pasadena, this is the first bat to test positive for rabies in 2024,” stated Manuel Carmona, Acting Director of Public Health. “While the last rabid bat in Pasadena was found in 2019, there is the potential for additional rabid bats in the region. Community members are encouraged to avoid contact with and immediately report injured or dead bats.” In Los Angeles County, the only animals known to routinely carry rabies are bats.\n\n“Any contact by humans or pets with a rabid bat is a very serious health concern. Rabies is often a fatal disease and requires timely preventive medical treatment,” stated Dr. Parveen Kaur, Acting Health Officer. “Any contact with bats or other wild animals should be avoided. A scratch from a tooth or bite from a rabid animal could cause rabies infection in people or other animals. In the event of skin contact with a bat, wash the area immediately with soap and water and seek medical care.”\n\nIf you see a dead or dying bat on the ground, do not handle it. Contact your local animal control agency to collect the bat for rabies testing. Pasadena Humane is the local agency for Pasadena and can be reached at (626) 792-7151. Animal bites should be discussed with your medical provider as soon as possible. If pets are affected, contact an emergency veterinarian. For more information on rabies, please visit CDC.gov/rabies."
