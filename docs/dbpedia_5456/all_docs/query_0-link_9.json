        "text": "The hedge fund billionaire is backing candidates who share his conservative priorities — as the former president steers Republicans toward populism\n\nBillionaire financier Ken Griffin is spending tens of millions of dollars to back Republican primary candidates across the US, but records show he has so far resisted contributing to Donald Trump — the former president leading an ideological overhaul of the GOP.\n\nGriffin’s position as an established force in Republican fundraising has sometimes put him at odds with Trump and his running mate, Ohio Senator JD Vance , who have promoted policies that were long anathema to conservatives."
