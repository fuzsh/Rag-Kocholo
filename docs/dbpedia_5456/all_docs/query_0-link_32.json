        "text": "Dave Alvord represents Salt Lake County's west side in District 2, which covers sections of Herriman, Riverton, South Jordan, West Jordan, Copperton, West Valley, Kearns, and Magna. Dave has a longstanding tradition of \"Fighting for the West Side.” As Mayor of South Jordan City (2014-2018) he recognized that the West Side is entitled to its fair share and championed equal representation for transportation dollars.\n\nIn his first two terms as a council member Dave doubled the amount of ZAP tax going to the west side, spearheaded the creation of the valley’s first NICA certified competition mountain biking trails in Butterfield Canyon, supported legislation to improve separation of powers between the executive and legislative branches of county government. He saved taxpayer dollars by cutting costly county employee incentive plans, reduced the mayor's budget, opposed a .25% Library tax increase, and worked to expand the size and impact of the Salt Lake County Auditor’s office.\n\nHis current priorities include: restoring lap lanes to the city of South Jordan, revitalizing Magna Main St, completing the 160 acre Bingham Creek Regional Park, and other initiatives that reduce taxes and improve county services. He currently serves as Vice Chair and Republican Majority Caucus Leader. Alvord represents the council on COG (Council of Governments), as a member of the WFRD Growth Committee, as well as the Environmental Quality Advisory Commission (EQAC) and the Criminal Justice Advisory Council (CJAC).\n\nDave practiced dentistry for 16 years and is currently the CEO of Professional Insurance Exchange, Utah's premier dental malpractice insurance company. Dave has been active on dental boards associated with the Utah Dental Association and its Salt Lake Chapter. He loves the outdoors, and one of his favorite hobbies is mountain biking. He is married to Laura and has four children who attend school in the Jordan School District. Dave enjoys serving on the Salt Lake County Council and would love to hear from the residents anytime!"
