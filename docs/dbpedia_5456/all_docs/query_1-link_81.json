        "text": "FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE\n\nSeptember 28, 2023\n\nContact: Sasha Galbreath, Sasha.Galbreath@mail.house.gov\n\nHouse Appropriations Member David Trone Underscores How an Extreme Republican Shutdown Would Harm Marylanders\n\nA Republican-driven government shutdown would hurt working families, interrupt vital services, damage our economy, endanger our national security, and force millions of our troops to work without on-time pay\n\nWASHINGTON, D.C. — With just three days remaining until a devastating extreme Republican government shutdown, Congressman David Trone (D-MD) warned that House Republicans are risking serious consequences for Maryland families:\n\n“Maryland families shouldn’t suffer because of House Republicans’ incompetence,” said Congressman Trone, a member of the House Appropriations Committee. “It is unacceptable that extreme House Republicans are willing to harm our economy, hurt hard-working families, and threaten our national security – all to score political points.”\n\n“I will keep fighting tooth and nail to prevent a government shutdown and protect Maryland families,” continued Congressman Trone. “The clock is ticking, and House Republicans need to stop wasting our time and start acting in the interest of the American people.”\n\nAccording to new data released by House Budget Committee Democrats, of which Congressman Trone is also a member, a Republican government shutdown would mean:\n\n48,236 active duty and reserve personnel serving our nation’s armed forces in Maryland would be forced to go without the pay they earn during a shutdown.\n\nThe Small Business Administration would stop processing small business loans, halting a program that provides $329,331,400 in funding to small businesses in Maryland every year.\n\n22,460 people flying throughMaryland airports every day would face potential delays and safety concerns due to staffing impacts on TSA agents and air traffic controllers.\n\n123,101 people inMaryland would soon lose access to Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) benefits.\n\n144,165 federal workers in Maryland would be furloughed or forced to work without pay, in addition to the many employees of businesses with government contracts who could be laid off, furloughed, or see their hours cut.\n\nWorkers at the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) would be sidelined, risking interruptions and delays to 202 food safety, pharmaceutical manufacturing, and other inspections conducted in Maryland last year.\n\nThe Department of Agriculture would be forced to stop processing housing loans, which provide $382,381,470 in funding to help 1,448 families in rural Maryland communities buy homes every year.\n\nThe Department of Agriculture would be forced to stop processing farm loans which provide $21,424,000 in funding for farmers in Maryland every year.\n\n670,867 Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) beneficiaries inMaryland would lose access to benefits in a prolonged shutdown.\n\n5,802,513 people who visit national parks in Maryland every year may be turned away or unable to fully access parks, monuments, and museums.\n\nState governments would be forced to pay for federal services like the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program, potentially risking benefits for the 43,336 TANF beneficiaries in Maryland.\n\nCongressman David Trone was elected to the House of Representatives in November 2018 to serve the 6th District of Maryland, which includes all or part of Montgomery, Frederick, Washington, Allegany, and Garrett Counties. Trone serves on the Appropriations, Budget, and Joint Economic Committees in the 118th Congress. In Congress, Trone is fighting to make progress on issues that matter to Marylanders.\n\nFollow Congressman Trone at @RepDavidTrone for updates on Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram.\n\n###"
