        "text": "SACRAMENTO, Calif. – A moderate California Democratic state lawmaker announced Thursday that she is switching to the Republican Party while criticizing her former party's leadership and policies.\n\nState Sen. Marie Alvarado-Gil said she had long been a Democrat, but she and the Democratic Party no longer have the same values since she was elected in 2022.\n\n“In the past two years that I've been working in the Senate, I have not recognized the party that I belong to,” Alvarado-Gil said in an announcement on “The Steve Hilton Show,” a YouTube series hosted by a former Fox News host and policy adviser to British ex-Prime Minister David Cameron. “The Democratic Party is not the party that I signed up for decades ago.”\n\nAlvarado-Gil represents a largely rural district northeast of the Central Valley. She said the Democratic Party's policies are hurting middle class and children in California and pushing the state in a wrong direction.\n\n“It's not a very popular decision to leave a supermajority party where perhaps, you know, you have a lot more power and ability,” she said.\n\nShe adds: “But this is a decision that is right for the constituents that voted me into office.”\n\nAlvarado-Gil is known for her support of the tough-on-crime approach and fiscally conservative outlook. She also has voted with Republicans on labor legislation.\n\n“It takes courage to stand up to the supermajority in California and Marie has what it takes,” Senate Minority Leader Brian Jones said in a statement. “Her record on tackling crime, protecting communities from sexually violent predators, and prioritizing her constituents speaks for itself.”\n\nHer defection gives Republicans nine votes in the 40-member Senate, still well under the majority they need to control the chamber. Democrats hold supermajorities in both the Assembly and Senate at the Capitol.\n\nState Senate President Pro Tem Mike McGuire said her decision “is disappointing for voters” who elected her in 2022.\n\n“They trusted her to represent them, and she’s betrayed that trust,” he said in a statement.\n\nHe added: “One silver lining is MAGA Republicans are gaining a pro-choice, pro-LGBTQ+ rights, anti-Trump colleague. We wish her the best of luck.”\n\nAlvarado-Gil, who represents a conservative-leaning district, won her 2022 election against a progressive Democrat by more than 5 points after the duo beat out six Republican candidates in the primary. Her district has become slightly more Republican since 2022, with Republicans having nearly 39% of registered voters to Democrats’ 34% in 2024.\n\nAlvarado-Gil is not up for reelection until 2026."
