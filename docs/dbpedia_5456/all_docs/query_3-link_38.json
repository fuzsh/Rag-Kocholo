It’s not only a “progressive” cause. I heard from people left, right and center who support the concept, yet on Wednesday, the bill died a painful, needless death. Ironic?\n\nIt was only one of many progressive priorities slain or diluted into meaninglessness in Carson City (James DeHaven outlined progressive disappointment in the era of Democratic control last week if you want the whole list). Democrats often cave while in the majority because they lack confidence in their own policies, even as those same ideas are wildly popular with voters. Death with dignity is a perfect example with upward of 70 percent public support. I appreciate that our Legislature wants to avoid “Washington dysfunction,” but we should be equally worried about mindless “neoliberalism” and “conventional wisdom” that make problems impossible to identify or solve.\n\nMore from Lyngar: Defending the Bee, exposing salamanders\n\nFirst, I think progressives must cultivate some understanding. A newly elected governor never has time to create an entire state budget in the weeks before his first legislative session, and the Democrats have been both shrewd and magnanimous in seeking bipartisan consensus. Democrats have also been fierce in punishing corruption in their caucus. Disgraced Majority Leader Kelvin Atkinson resigned so fast he left a cartoonish, swirling cloud behind him. It’s refreshing to see people who break the law get punished in the age of Trump’s nonstop criminality. There is much to admire about this legislature.\n\nYet, I worry greatly about stubborn, discredited “neoliberalism” — a word that means Democrats who prioritize business profits over people. Neoliberalism explains the cozy relationship between political parties and rich people. When Republicans talk fondly about Joe Biden, that’s neoliberalism talking. After letting their party be hijacked, “never-Trump” Republicans are hoping neoliberalism will turn Democrats into the GOP lite. We cannot allow it.\n\nMore: Stop attacking liberal arts | Edwin Lyngar\n\nOf the many issues being debated in the Legislature, two capture the essence of neoliberalism — minimum wage and payday lending. Had the minimum wage kept up with productivity, it would be near 20 dollars an hour. Democrats are offering tepid and lame solutions to Nevada’s unsustainable wages, even as polling shows tremendous public support for a robust minimum wage (to be fair, the GOP wants to eliminate it altogether). The hesitancy to regulate payday lending is baffling, because the industry is built on exploitation and human misery. It’s good business with the smartest lobbyists money can buy, but payday lending is itself a kind of economic violence. Where is the outrage and sense of urgency?\n\nAccording to Bloomberg and others, America resembles a “developing” country in many places. For the third year running, American life expectancy has declined, led by early deaths of white people from suicide, drug addiction and despair. A full 40 percent of Americans can’t come up with a measly 400 bucks in an emergency. Desperate people can’t wait for politics. They need help now.\n\nMore: The liberal economic consensus | Edwin Lyngar\n\nSome people in the Legislature are like me and doing just great (I got a new puppy), but many more Nevadans struggle. We can’t afford to be patient. If you live in a sleeping bag next to the Truckee River, your problems are here, now. Our civilization is running out of time and willpower to fix things, and I can prove it: A healthy nation does not elect a clown as president.\n\nYet, a minority of Americans revel in the chaos, because at least it’s better than the intolerable status quo. Meanwhile Democrats can’t stop pining for these voters who will never, ever support them or their issues such as gay rights, increased minimum wage, free college, protecting religious minorities and fair elections. Democrats should stop kowtowing to those who despise them. It’s as if we crave abusive relationships.\n\nIf you listen to the conventional neoliberalism, it’s a nonstop drumbeat that we can’t afford nice things. Sure, we can afford massive tax cuts, a bloated military and endless wars, but we can’t help regular people. I reject this pile of nonsense, just as most Nevadans did in November.\n\nEven with some disappointments this legislative session, progressive policies are more popular than ever. With population booms in Washoe and Clark Counties, these numbers will only grow. I feel budding shoots of hope, and now it’s time for action."
