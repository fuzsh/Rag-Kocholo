        "text": "Ahead of the March primary, The Orange County Register compiled a list of questions to pose to the candidates who wish to represent you. You can find the full questionnaire below. Questionnaires may have been edited for spelling, grammar, length and, in some instances, to remove hate speech and offensive language.\n\nMORE: Read all the candidate responses in our Voter Guide\n\nName: David Pan\n\nCurrent Job Title: Professor\n\nPolitical Party Affiliation: Republican\n\nIncumbent: No\n\nOther political positions held: None\n\nCity where you reside: Irvine\n\nCampaign website or social media: www.davidpanforcongress.com\n\nHow much assistance should the U.S. provide — military and/or financial — to foreign countries at war, like Israel or Ukraine? What, if any, should be the litmus test for American allies to receive assistance from the U.S.?\n\nCountries that clearly share our liberal democratic values should be supported with military and financial assistance to allow them to achieve victory. We are currently facing an international situation in which Israel and Ukraine are fighting to uphold the values that we hold dear. Since their success will save U.S. lives and resources for conflicts ahead, we must support them now. The litmus tests for our support include their commitment to international law and human rights in their domestic and foreign policies.\n\nBorder security continues to be a concern for many Americans. What is one proposal, that you believe could get bipartisan support, to address the border?\n\nThere is already bipartisan support for asylum seekers to remain in safe countries such as Mexico. We need to build on such consensus to craft a deal to stop illegal immigration while developing a solution for Dreamers and a sustainable immigration policy that contributes to a strong economy through new jobs, new innovation and greater productivity.\n\nAs AI technology continues to rapidly expand, what do you see as the federal government’s role in creating and enforcing a regulatory framework?\n\nAs with cybersecurity, the federal government has the role of collaborating with private actors to develop safe AI systems that also allow for growth and innovation.\n\nThe role — and size — of the U.S. Supreme Court has come under scrutiny in recent years. Do you believe more justices should be added to the nation’s highest court, or would you support any kind of reform, like term limits?\n\nI would not support any change to the size of the Supreme Court or to the current policy of lifetime terms.\n\nWhat is one environment or climate policy you’d champion if elected?\n\nI would support the elimination of subsidies for specific products and the abandonment of industrial policies that undermine the workings of our economy. Instead, I would support cap and trade policies that would create demonstrable progress toward climate goals. These goals also need to be revised for a time horizon that takes into account the interdependence of climate policy and our economic well-being.\n\nThe George Santos saga made for numerous memes and “SNL” skits. But what is one thing Congress should take away from the former congressman’s expulsion from the House?\n\nWe need to expect more from our representatives. Political careerism and pandering to the convenient rhetoric of the moment should be rejected in favor of leaders who are willing to step up and honestly address difficult topics and take on special interests.\n\n2023 was a year for labor in California. What is one policy you’d champion to support workers, if elected?\n\nOur workforce competes on a global level, and so we must make sure that our education system rewards hard work and merit rather than an accident of birth. School choice is the key to allowing all parents — not just the wealthy — to take control of their children’s education. I will work to establish school choice as the pathway to a better future for all our children.\n\nIf you are an incumbent, tell us the most significant accomplishment of your most recent term. If you’re a newcomer, tell us how you, as a freshman, would stand out.\n\nAs a freshman working against the political establishment, I would be seeking to address the difficult issues that need to be discussed but have been overshadowed by party politics and ideology: government spending and the failure of our most important institutions, the deterioration of our military infrastructure and the ability of citizens to expect a fair livelihood for their own hard work.\n\nDescribe your political philosophy in 10 words or less.\n\nStrong nation, small government, trust in Americans.\n\nWhat is your go-to campaign trail snack or drink?\n\nProtein bars."
