        "text": "If elected, what would be your top three priorities during the 2025 legislative session?\n\nAMABILE:\n\nAdequate treatment for people with serious mental illness. Too many people are suffering in our streets in homelessness, psychosis, and addiction. We have to create adequate infrastructure to stop this cycle before it starts. I passed a bill to consider involuntary care in the most extreme cases, similar to California’s CARE courts. That study was recently completed. I plan to build on this progress through legislation in the Senate. Climate action. I passed a bill in 2023 to study issues faced by oil and gas workers as Colorado transitions to clean energy. I want to pursue legislation based on that study in 2025. I also want to continue working to create greater resiliency for inevitable climate-driven challenges like fire disasters and drought. I have passed several insurance reform bills, and a bill to provide insurance options in communities where carriers have exited. Housing availability and affordability. This session I passed a bill allowing more ADUs, and I supported the bill to increase density on transit corridors. I also supported protections for renters. If elected I will continue to work on policies to create more affordable housing.\n\nSCHIFFER: We must simultaneously and comprehensively transform multiple systems to address the economic and social disparities at the root of many of our challenges in SD18. This transformation necessitates a shift in our legislative approach, moving away from singular policy priorities to a focus on policy outcomes that enhance the economic stability, fair treatment, and holistic well-being of all SD18 residents.\n\nThe outcomes-based priorities that will guide my decision on every bill that comes across my desk are:\n\nWill this policy enhance economic security for everyone in SD18? Will this policy be applied in a way that is fair for all SD18 constituents? Will this policy create opportunities for physical, emotional, and mental well-being for everyone?\n\nSpecific policy priorities that are urgent and necessary for our communities and others across the state include enacting a ban on the sale, purchase, and transfer of assault weapons, removing the state prohibition on rent control in cities and counties, and acting on HB23-1300‘s feasibility study to take advantage of new federal guidance that enables states to use Medicaid to pay for housing, food, climate-related supports (e.g., air conditioners), and other social determinants of health.\n\nWhat do residents in your district say is the community’s biggest issue, and how will you work to address it?\n\nAMABILE: Beyond the three priorities mentioned above, I believe District 18 voters are concerned about income inequality and the wealth gap. Boulder County includes people at every level of the economy, and many working families with kids are really struggling. I’m glad we took strong steps in the 2024 legislative session to help, passing bills to provide tax benefits and transfers to the most vulnerable: families with children, seniors, and people who are trying to gain a foothold on their housing situation. These new policies will make a big difference and cut child poverty by nearly half. Affordability is impacted by many interconnected issues. I have and will continue to work on policies that fundamentally address market conditions (like housing, health care, education, transportation, internet access, etc.) that create income inequality and make our state unaffordable, especially for low income earners.\n\nSCHIFFER: The issues I hear most about from SD18 are the top concerns my family and the families I work with have faced in my 25 years in Boulder County: pollution and climate crisis impacts, housing affordability and homelessness, and access to affordable and culturally competent mental health treatment and prevention.\n\nPrevention is vital to creating long-term solutions to housing and homelessness, climate disasters, and behavioral illness. We must focus as much on prevention as we focus on responses to these crises. Prevention means educating and resourcing individuals and businesses to prepare for climate-related disasters, keeping people housed so they don’t become homeless in the first place, and addressing factors like lack of stable and affordable housing and healthcare that put all of us at risk for mental illness, especially our youth (e.g., poverty).\n\nIn recent years, we have seen locally how prevention-oriented programs can make a difference. For instance, Boulder’s Wildfire Home Assessment Program educates homeowners on protecting their homes and communities. Similarly, the new Building Home peer support program gives formerly unhoused individuals the tools and support they need to stay housed. I will champion these types of initiatives that provide tangible solutions to our community’s most pressing issues.\n\nThe Legislature passed a few key land use bills this year aimed at increasing housing development. What is the state’s role, if any, to increase development and density to address the affordable housing stock issue?\n\nAMABILE: Housing has become a matter of statewide concern because too many people cannot find an affordable place to live. The housing and land use policies that passed this year aim to strike a balance between what is good for many, and acceptable for most. I was proud to be the prime sponsor of the ADU bill.\n\nSCHIFFER: All of our communities are dealing with the consequences of our state’s failure to develop sufficient housing stock over the past 50 years: higher rates of homelessness, skyrocketing housing costs, and more families spending more than a third of their income on housing. Solutions do not look the same in each city or county across our state. We should give cities and counties the tools and support they need to help achieve statewide goals to create more affordable housing, including ending the statewide ban on rent control. We are in a housing crisis, and we need to enable cities and counties to innovate and problem-solve in a way that advances statewide goals while adapting to local needs. SB24-174 is on the right track by providing technical assistance, guidance, and incentives to enable local governments to identify housing needs, create action plans to meet them, and be accountable for progress on their plans through funding incentives. This state-supported, locally driven approach is precisely the type of problem-solving approach that leads to success: the state gives local communities the tools, resources, and flexibility to solve their problems locally while being held accountable for progress through incentives such as state grants.\n\nWhat is the state’s role in mitigating the effects of climate change on citizens and what specific environmental policies would you support in the Legislature?\n\nAMABILE: The state plays a crucial role in regulating and reducing carbon, encouraging a renewable energy economy, and creating greater resiliency against immediate and future climate change impacts. I was the prime sponsor in the House of 14 bills on climate resiliency and sustainability, energy and environment, including establishing the Office of Climate Sustainability, expanding solar rights for homeowners, insurance reform, grant funding for sustainable and resilient rebuilding, changes to plugging orphan wells, prohibiting counties from forced pooling and many more. I will continue to work hard on climate policies that get Colorado to net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2040.\n\nSCHIFFER: The state should be responsible for regulating the oil and gas corporations contributing to greenhouse gas emissions that exacerbate local climate disasters and pollute our air. I was disappointed by the failure of the ban on new oil and gas drilling permits in the last session. As senator, I will support such bans. I understand that legislators and climate advocates sought a compromise with the oil and gas lobby. Their efforts will generate approximately $180M/year for public transit and environmental protection. However, it doesn’t account for the cost to residents, cities, and counties of climate-related wildfires ($2B for the Marshall fire), floods ($715M for the 2013 floods), and the mitigation measures cities and counties are racing to put in place due to the escalating climate crisis. Nor does it account for the negative health impacts on Coloradans across the state who breathe some of the poorest air in the country. The climate crisis is worsening, and its initial economic impacts are already proving disastrous for our state. I will also advocate for extracting more money for climate mitigation efforts from the wealthy oil and gas companies that harm our health, put our communities at risk, and destroy our ecosystems.\n\nHow can the Legislature most effectively address cost-of-living concerns for Coloradans across all backgrounds, including income levels and homeowner/renter status?\n\nAMABILE: We took strong steps to decrease poverty, boost incomes, and support workers and families in Colorado, including an expansion of Colorado’s earned income tax credit. The tax package we passed will return $450 million to all Coloradans and cut child poverty nearly in half by creating the Family Affordability Tax Credit, which will put $650 million directly into the pockets of hardworking families with children making under $85,000. Additional legislation will ensure tax credits for working families remain robust in years to come. These credits will return hundreds of millions of dollars to hardworking Coloradans, and include a significant tax credit for child care expenses.\n\nWe voted to return $40 million to Coloradans who provide essential services like child care, home health care, personal care, nursing care, or care for a family member. We also passed a bill to make it easier for seniors and Coloradans with disabilities to receive property tax, rent and heat assistance. We expanded the senior property tax exemption so seniors can keep the exemption even when they move.\n\nProtecting workers is an important way to foster greater equity. I was the primary sponsor of a measure to crack down on businesses that violate child labor laws. We also passed legislation to increase transparency for gig workers.\n\nSCHIFFER: In 2012, I lost my home to foreclosure. I went from a stable middle-class life to single parenthood, trying to create stability for my sons on a school district paycheck. What broke my heart most at the time was not losing my home; it was watching my children lose the only home they had ever known. Everyone should have a safe, stable place to call home, regardless of how much money they have. Corporate greed pushes Colorado families out of their homes and communities for profit. There are many ways to address cost-of-living. We need wages that keep up with housing costs and affordable healthcare for all, and every family needs access to high-quality care for elderly parents, children, or other family members who cannot care for themselves. We must end exclusionary housing practices, provide more funding for safety net programs such as emergency rental assistance and eviction protection, and fund policies such as low-interest loans for more people to move from renting to home-owning and the county-supported down payment assistance program that allowed me to repurchase a home in 2020. Funding for these programs should come via taxes on the investors and investment companies profiting from our housing markets.\n\nDo you support deeper property tax cuts through ballot initiatives this year that would override the Legislature’s property tax work from the most recent session?\n\nAMABILE: No.\n\nSCHIFFER: No. I would only consider deeper property tax cuts when we have other ways to fund critical programs such as education, public transportation, and climate mitigation. The housing market is becoming a source of distress for more and more of us. Rent-backed securities, short-term rentals, and corporate landlords are driving up prices for everyone, leading to more homeowners needing help to keep up with property tax payments and at risk of losing their homes. We need to tax the groups who have turned our fundamental human right to housing into a tool for corporate profit, not homeowners struggling to keep up with higher and higher costs of food, energy, housing, healthcare, and other basic human needs.\n\nMany Coloradans are listing their top issue this election year as democracy and good governance through the statewide Voter Voices project. Do you find any common ground with members of the opposite party, and how important is bipartisanship in your political philosophy?\n\nAMABILE: Absolutely. I am known for reaching across the aisle and much of the legislation I’ve passed in the General Assembly has earned bipartisan support. My style is both collaborative and tough. I am not afraid to take on difficult issues or take hard votes. I’m willing to stand up to my own caucus when I think that’s the right thing to do.\n\nSCHIFFER: Absolutely. Whatever side of the political aisle we are on, we all want stable and affordable housing, quality healthcare, clean air and water, healthy food, and communities where we and our families are safe and secure. Finding common ground is vital in policymaking to balance diverse perspectives and contribute to the legitimacy and acceptance of laws and policies. It also prevents gridlock and polarization, ensuring policymakers can adapt policies to meet the needs of a diverse state like Colorado. When policymakers with diverse perspectives pursue common ground, they bring us closer to a society that serves all of us rather than a select few. However, politicians must be steadfast in our commitment to not compromise on fundamental democratic values, such as freedoms of speech, press, assembly, and religion, equality and justice for all, free and fair elections, the peaceful transfer of power, and respecting and defending human rights.\n\nWhat is one bill, vote or other legislative action you’ve taken that you feel best demonstrates your qualification for reelection?\n\nAMABILE: HB22-1303, which directed $65 million in Federal ARPA dollars to increase capacity at the Colorado Mental Health Institute and create 125 new residential care beds statewide. It was a tough fight, and I’m glad I was successful. These resources are coming online now, and they will make a difference. We have a mental health crisis in our state. It is complicated and has developed insidiously over the decades. When I started in the General Assembly, most lawmakers couldn’t seem to fathom why we have a homelessness problem, why our jails are overflowing with people who are mentally ill, or what we should do about it. I believe my work has helped change the conversation. Lawmakers are now working with more clarity and urgency to address inadequate care. We have a long way to go and I want to build on these wins in the Senate.\n\nYou are running against a current state lawmaker. Are there any votes they have taken in the Legislature you disagree with? What are they and why would you have voted differently?\n\nSCHIFFER: Yes. I am running for an open Senate seat. My opponent currently serves in the House. She is not term-limited but chose to vacate her House seat to run for Senate. A few bills stand out from her last House session, where I would have taken a different position. Three of the bills relate to enhancing protections for victims of sexual assault: HB24-1072, HB24-1460, and SB24-113. I would have voted “yes” to all three of these bills; my opponent voted “no.” As the mother of two multiracial sons, I appreciate the risks young men face in the criminal justice system, especially men of color. I also understand the lifelong trauma victims of sexual assault face, especially when reporting is itself a traumatic experience. I will support victims of sexual assault, especially as a senator for a district that includes a college town. I would have voted against HB24-1233, which loosened restrictions on how HOAs collect payments on delinquent unit owners and created additional fees for homeowners. My opponent voted “yes.” As someone who lost a home to foreclosure in 2012, I will support the dignity of families struggling to make ends meet.\n\nSenate District 19 is centered in Jefferson County and includes parts of Arvada and Westminster. It is currently represented by Democratic Sen. Rachel Zenzinger, who won in 2020 with 59% of the vote.\n\nIf elected, what would be your top three priorities during the 2025 legislative session?\n\nDAUGHERTY: My top three priorities for the 2025 legislative session are to continue supporting our workers and amplifying their voices, making healthcare more affordable and transparent, and investing in public education.\n\nEZEADI: Cost of living is my top priority. First, I will work to significantly lower childcare costs to support working families, making it easier for parents to return to work while ensuring their children receive high-quality care. Second, I will advocate for comprehensive strategies to make housing more accessible and affordable, coupled with initiatives to reduce healthcare costs, ensuring that every family in our district can live a healthy, secure life without financial strain. And third, I am committed to securing full funding for our public schools and ensuring our teachers are well-compensated. This investment in education is critical for equipping our youth with the skills they need for the future and strengthening our community’s overall economic and social well-being.\n\nWhat do residents in your district say is the community’s biggest issue, and how will you work to address it\n\nDAUGHERTY: Affordability is the biggest issue facing my community right now. The rising cost of groceries, prescription drug costs, childcare, and housing have all contributed to making it more expensive to live in my community and across Colorado. If elected, I will address these issues through a creative and pragmatic approach, ensuring that Coloradans are not priced out of their communities. That means increasing protections for our renters and homeowners, pushing for increased funding for affordable housing development, ensuring support for hardworking families through tax credits and ensuring fully-funded public schools, and making sure all Coloradans have access to quality, affordable healthcare.\n\nEZEADI: Residents in our district are increasingly concerned about the lack of civility and collaboration at the state Capitol, which has contributed to a toxic political environment. Addressing this issue is crucial for effective governance and restoring public trust in our legislative processes. If elected, I will prioritize fostering a culture of respect and bipartisanship. I plan to initiate and support measures that promote open dialogue and cooperation across party lines. By working together, we can more effectively tackle the pressing issues facing our state and ensure that our legislative actions reflect the diverse needs and values of all Coloradans.\n\nThe Legislature passed a few key land use bills this year aimed at increasing housing development. What is the state’s role, if any, to increase development and density to address the affordable housing stock issue?\n\nDAUGHERTY: I am committed to addressing these housing challenges through policies and legislation that promote affordability and availability. This includes pushing for increased funding for affordable housing development, supporting renters’ rights and protections, promoting innovative housing solutions, and addressing zoning laws that can restrict housing development. Housing is an issue that must be addressed through both state and local initiatives. That is why having an open line of communication with my local district leaders is key to ensure that we can tackle these issues together and effectively.\n\nEZEADI: By streamlining zoning laws, providing incentives for developers to build affordable units, and investing in public infrastructure, the state can effectively increase the availability of housing people can afford while ensuring sustainable community growth. In tackling housing issues, I will prioritize addressing missing-middle homeownership gaps, particularly for townhomes and condos, incentivize municipalities, and ensure that all development plans include a sustainable water supply strategy due to our state’s finite water resources.\n\nWhat is the state’s role in mitigating the effects of climate change on citizens and what specific environmental policies would you support in the Legislature?\n\nDAUGHERTY: The state has a sizable role in an equitable climate future. Climate change disproportionately affects communities of color and people living in impoverished areas. We need to make sure that these communities have a voice at the table and are able to fully participate in legislation that actively affects their day to day living standards. For starters, we need to actively enforce and strengthen our pre-existing regulations so that big polluters are both held accountable and held to higher standards. I also fully support investing in renewable energy sources and having a just transition for our workers into a new green economy. It is only together, from all levels of government, can we even begin to adequately address the climate crisis we are currently facing.\n\nEZEADI: The state must lead in combating climate change through robust environmental policies. I support transitioning to renewable energy sources, investing in green public transport, and enforcing stricter pollution controls. Additionally, I would advocate for policies that promote water conservation and sustainable land management to protect our natural resources and public health. A just transition is essential to ensure that the shift towards renewable energy is equitable and does not leave workers or communities behind. This involves a comprehensive strategy that includes retraining programs, economic diversification, and targeted support for affected workers and regions.\n\nSpecifically, I advocate for the establishment of a Just Transition Fund that provides financial assistance and job training for workers transitioning from fossil fuel industries to emerging sectors. Additionally, I support policies that incentivize the creation of green jobs in areas most affected by the energy transition, ensuring these jobs offer competitive wages and benefits. Collaborative efforts with unions, industry, and educational institutions are crucial to develop tailored training programs that meet the specific needs of the local workforce. My approach also includes actively involving affected communities in the planning and implementation processes to ensure their voices are heard and their needs are addressed, thereby fostering an inclusive economy that benefits all.\n\nHow can the Legislature most effectively address cost-of-living concerns for Coloradans across all backgrounds, including income levels and homeowner/renter status?\n\nDAUGHERTY: As housing costs skyrocket, more people are facing impossible choices between paying rent or buying groceries. This crisis disproportionately impacts communities of color, lower-income households, and renters who are being pushed out of the communities they call home.\n\nIncome inequality prevents too many Colorado families from building economic security. Empowering workers is critical to addressing these inequities. I have consistently stood with workers and unions and sponsored bills to expand workers’ compensation benefits, protect injured workers from unfair clawbacks, and require employers to notify staff about tax credits to boost their take-home pay. In the state Senate, I’m eager to focus on improving our systems for paid family and medical leave, so employees don’t have to choose between work and family.\n\nEZEADI: To effectively address cost-of-living concerns, the Legislature should focus on creating more affordable housing, reducing healthcare costs, and increasing educational opportunities that lead to better-paying jobs. Policies that provide tax incentives for lower and middle-income families and regulate utility costs can also help make daily expenses more manageable for all Coloradans.\n\nDo you support deeper property tax cuts through ballot initiatives this year that would override the Legislature’s property tax work from the most recent session?\n\nDAUGHERTY: I am proud of what we accomplished at the state Legislature this past session, though property taxes are an ongoing issue that we need to further address. Also, it is crucially important that we center this conversation around balancing the need of lowering property taxes with making sure critical public services like education and fire departments are fully funded. We need to work together on a long-term solution, and I don’t believe the current ballot initiatives provide us with that long-term solution as it stands.\n\nEZEADI: Property taxes are too high for most working families in my district. We need to lower them and hopefully the bipartisan compromise bill that passed will do that. While I understand the appeal of even deeper property tax cuts, I believe we must balance tax relief with the need to fund essential services like education, healthcare, and public safety. I would prefer to refine the Legislature’s recent work to target tax relief more effectively at those who need it most without compromising public services.\n\nEditor’s note: Ezeadi’s response to this question was updated at 7:15 a.m., June 14, 2024, to correct an error.\n\nMany Coloradans are listing their top issue this election year as democracy and good governance through the statewide Voter Voices project. Do you find any common ground with members of the opposite party, and how important is bipartisanship in your political philosophy?\n\nDAUGHERTY: I really appreciate this question because, currently, our country is very divided and political rhetoric can be extremely vitriolic. We need good governance to ensure the continuation of our democracy, and finding common ground is crucial to achieving that goal. Not everyone in my district voted for me, but their voices still matter in our legislative process. My door is always open to all of my constituents, and I take that very seriously because I want to know how the policy we enact will impact my community.\n\nWhile I certainly do not agree with my colleagues across the aisle all of the time, it is very important to me to find spaces where we can come together to find common ground so that we can craft better and more nuanced legislation for our communities. In the past, I have worked with my colleagues across the aisle to successfully sponsor and pass bills such as SB22-182 Economic Mobility Program, and HB23-1201 Prescription Drug Benefits Contract Term Requirement. If elected to the state Senate, I will continue to strive to best represent the needs of all of my constituents.\n\nEZEADI: Bipartisanship is crucial for effective governance. I find common ground with members of the opposite party on issues like veterans’ affairs, infrastructure, and emergency preparedness. It’s vital to work across the aisle to craft policies that serve the best interest of all citizens, ensuring robust and resilient democratic processes.\n\nWhat is one bill, vote or other legislative action you’ve taken that you feel best demonstrates your qualification for reelection?\n\nDAUGHERTY: My experience of being a family and juvenile law attorney and guardian ad litem has uniquely ingrained in me a passion to fix the disparities in our criminal justice system and to support our at-risk youths. I also have a strong track record of passing bills that make our justice system more equitable, fair, and transparent.\n\nFor example, my bill, HB24-1017, Bill of Rights for Foster Youth ensures Colorado’s foster youths are treated with the respect and dignity they deserve by addressing critical areas like protection from discrimination, access to education and healthcare, preparation for adulthood, and a written notification of their rights. I am extremely proud of the work we did on that bill, and I fought really hard to make sure the most vulnerable in our population have their voices amplified and uplifted in our law.\n\nI am qualified to be elected because I have the experience and expertise to be effective starting on Day No. 1 in the state Senate, and if elected, I would be the only woman attorney in the state Senate. Moreover, my experience as a family law attorney means I know how to mediate, negotiate, and get results for my constituents.\n\nYou are running against a current state lawmaker. Are there any votes they have taken in the Legislature you disagree with? What are they and why would you have voted differently?\n\nEZEADI: As this is an open seat with the current state senator being termed out, I have not spent my time analyzing my opponent’s voting record. I wish my opponent success, but I am focused on the positive campaign I am running, based on my strong connection with the community and the clear vision I have for our future. I had the privilege of volunteering for the current state senator back in 2023 and learned in-depth about the state budget while working in her office, which has significantly informed my understanding of effective governance. I am dedicated to continue the excellent levels of communication and community engagement that the constituents have come to expect. I believe the residents of our district deserve a senator who not only understands their issues but has lived through similar struggles and has the proven diverse professional and municipal experience to problem solve, and is committed to a government that genuinely works for everyone.\n\nThis commitment is reflected in my winning 60% of the vote at the County Assembly and the robust support of over 150 active volunteers. My campaign is driven by a deep-seated desire to serve and the urgent need to address the compounding crises that affect us all. I firmly believe that my unique experiences and the strong community backing make me the best candidate for this moment.\n\nSenate District 23 includes part of Larimer and Weld Counties. It is currently represented by Republican Sen. Barbara Kirkmeyer, who won the seat in 2020 with 55% of the vote.\n\nIf elected, what would be your top three priorities during the 2025 legislative session?\n\nABSHIER:\n\nIllegal Immigration: Open borders are detrimental not only to the citizens of this country but also to the people who are making their way into our country. LEGAL immigration is humane. Illegal immigration is not. Problems caused by open borders. Human, sex and drug trafficking: This issue endangers men, women and children being used by the cartels and the bad actors who support open borders has led to death of tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, of innocent human beings. Fentanyl epidemic: This dangerous drug is being brought across our open borders and is causing great harm to thousands of people in Colorado and across the country. Crime & Safety: We must stop treating victims as criminals and criminals as victims. Lowering the standards for law enforcement doesn’t help people who are victims nor is it helping those who continue to live a life of crime. I support law enforcement to keep our communities safe and making sure victim rights are protected. Limiting government, reducing spending and protect TABOR: I will stop the out-of-control spending and limit the government’s intrusion into private lives and small businesses. Parental Rights: Parents must be able to educate their children by methods they feel are right for their family, whether that’s public, charter, private or home schooling. Every student deserves to receive an excellent education. Public schools must not be controlled by the government or education unions who care more about protecting their own interests rather than focusing on improving student test scores and preparing students for life after their K-12 education.\n\nKIRKMEYER: Education funding and accountability. Repeal cashless bail policies that put dangerous criminals back on the street. Criminalize (refelonize) the possession of fentanyl, a poison which is killing far too many Coloradans.\n\nWhat do residents in your district say is the community’s biggest issue, and how will you work to address it?\n\nABSHIER: Illegal immigration is the biggest issue of concern for residents in our community. Colorado citizens must come first before illegal immigrants who’ve come here through by reckless Democrat policies. Open borders are detrimental not only to the citizens of this country but also to the people who are making their way here. It’s my priority to stop funding illegal immigration in Colorado and enforce the laws already in place. We must stop sanctuary statuses that are responsible for death and destruction across Colorado. LEGAL immigration is humane immigration.\n\nKIRKMEYER: People say Colorado is no longer a great place to raise a family or start and run a business. It’s just too expensive! I’ve already made progress in cutting the cost of living. In 2024, I took on the Democrats and won. We got $1.3 billion in property tax relief passed. We have more work to do to cut the cost of living. I will continue to work to end punitive, costly regulations on our energy and agriculture workers and to bring additional tax relief.\n\nThe Legislature passed a few key land use bills this year aimed at increasing housing development. What is the state’s role, if any, to increase development and density to address the affordable housing stock issue?\n\nABSHIER: The state should let the market along with local jurisdictions decide housing development. Zoning laws are changing the landscape of Colorado — we must reign in the overzealous zoning laws and protect our property values. Regulations should be reduced and local communities must be able to control where and how housing development should occur. I believe in small government and less regulation. Smaller, limited government is crucial to maintaining our constitutional republic. The state shouldn’t be involved in creating or changing laws related to housing development.\n\nKIRKMEYER: In the 2024 session I passed SB24-174 that focuses on partnership versus preemption and requires housing needs assessments and action plans. Housing development and density decision-making should lie with local governments, not at the state level. Why should state government dictate one-size-fits-all regulations and policies on communities across our diverse state?\n\nWhat is the state’s role in mitigating the effects of climate change on citizens and what specific environmental policies would you support in the Legislature?\n\nABSHIER: Colorado has gone too far by regulating shopping bags and creating over-reaching guidelines that negatively impact our ability to maintain our oil and gas industry as well as driving up energy costs across the state. Government shouldn’t be involved in creating or changing laws related to climate change by enacting over-reaching, business killing laws and mandates.\n\nKIRKMEYER: Re-introduce SB24-095. This bill, had it passed, would have provided a $850 voucher for high emitter vehicles unable to pass the emissions test to get the vehicle fixed, thereby reducing tons of pollution in Colorado. The Democrats killed the bill in committee. The number one thing the state can do to reduce the emission of greenhouse gasses is property forest management. One Colorado forest fire can emit millions of tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. We should thin forests, remove dead trees, and plant more trees to mitigate forest fire risk and remove more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.\n\nHow can the Legislature most effectively address cost-of-living concerns for Coloradans across all backgrounds, including income levels and homeowner/renter status?\n\nABSHIER: The role of our government is to protect the citizens from foreign and domestic enemies by maintaining military and police forces for the protection of its citizens against loss of life, property and liberty. Once again, smaller, limited government is crucial to maintaining our constitutional republic. The government should stay out of private property and private market issues.\n\nKIRKMEYER: Inflation is caused by too much money chasing too few goods and services. Conservative solutions are the answer: reduce runaway spending, cut taxes, and rein in punitive regulations that kill jobs and drive-up prices.\n\nDo you support deeper property tax cuts through ballot initiatives this year that would override the Legislature’s property tax work from the most recent session?\n\nABSHIER: Yes, most definitely.\n\nKIRKMEYER: Additional property tax cuts are needed. We have more work to do. I have concerns about the various ballot measures currently under consideration.\n\nMany Coloradans are listing their top issue this election year as democracy and good governance through the statewide Voter Voices project. Do you find any common ground with members of the opposite party, and how important is bipartisanship in your political philosophy?\n\nABSHIER: The common ground with Democrats is to address illegal immigration, statewide crime and fentanyl access and abuse.\n\nKIRKMEYER: I was listed by Colorado Politics twice in the top three bipartisan teams. I have worked across the aisle on many policies and will continue to do so. This includes legislation to fully fund education and eliminate the budget stabilization factor , decreasing property taxes (SB24-233), securing funding for higher education, affordable and sustainable housing (SB24-174) and ensuring water rights are not infringed on while the protecting our rivers and wetlands (HB24-1379).\n\nAre there any votes the incumbent has taken in the Legislature you disagree with? What are they and why would you have voted differently?\n\nABSHIER: SB23-101, Candidate Ballot Access for Primary Elections: This bill that would’ve eliminated the caucus and assembly process in Colorado, resulting in only allowing candidates to get on the ballot by gathering signatures on a petition. I would’ve never voted for, much less sponsored, this horrendous bill. Thankfully, it didn’t pass.\n\nSB24-233: This bill was co-sponsored and helped pass a property tax increase while trying to convince voters that it’s really a tax decrease and it was the “responsible thing to do.” In reality, property tax rates go up under this bill and won’t save Coloradans any money. This legislation is a scam that will will cause property taxes to go up and its real purpose is to try and convince voters to not pass a property tax cut and cap ballot measure this fall. I would’ve never co-sponsored or voted for this bill.\n\nWhat is one bill, vote or other legislative action you’ve taken that you feel best demonstrates your qualification for reelection?\n\nKIRKMEYER: In the face of an overwhelmingly Democrat-controlled Legislature, I took a leading role in developing, negotiating, and passing Senate Bill 233, which cut property taxes by $1.3 billion this year. This is just one example of how I am a conservative fighter who wins.\n\nSenate District 28 cuts across Adams and Arapahoe counties and includes parts of Aurora and Watkins. It is currently represented by Democratic Sen. Rhonda Fields and historically favors Democrats by 32 points.\n\nEditor’s note: Weissman’s responses were added at 10:30 a.m. on June 10.\n\nIf elected, what would be your top three priorities during the 2025 legislative session?\n\nKEITH: First, I will work to expand school safety measures which keep our children safe. Schools must be places to learn and learning is difficult if children do not believe they are safe. Additionally, we must expand access to pre- and post-school programming to build structure and stability for the next generation of Colorado leaders and thinkers. Second, I will invest in public infrastructure including modernizing public schools, providing more competitive pay for our educators and support staff, enhancing access to sustainable and safer public transit, and expanding more affordable health care. In particular, we must prioritize mental health coverage and defending a woman’s freedom to make her own health care choices and access to IVF. Third, I will work to finally address the housing crisis and expand access to quality, yet affordable, housing with the intent to expand the middle class.\n\nWEISSMAN:\n\nContinued attention to our tax laws to make sure that they are supporting and responding to the needs of working Coloradans and small businesses to make ends meet and that we modify or discontinue ineffective tax breaks particularly those benefiting the largest corporations. Affordable higher education options particularly including options like two year degrees, concurrent enrollment, and technical education for students and families for whom a four year college track may not make sense, or may not make sense initially. Campaign finance transparency. The amount of untraceable money in our elections is corrosive to small-d democracy and is reaching historic levels. We can’t address concerns that people want us to address — cost of living; reducing climate pollution, anything — if giant sums of money drown out popular voice. Recent reporting shows this concern.\n\nWhat do residents in your district say is the community’s biggest issue, and how will you work to address it?\n\nKEITH: My team and I have knocked on more than 10,000 doors in the past few months. During this process, my neighbors in Senate District 28 have shared their concerns and their hopes. As I listened, the common issues were affordable housing and well-paying jobs that can support a family. My wife and I agree. Many people are one emergency from a financial disaster. As your next state senator in District 28, I will make it my mission to remove needless administrative barriers, unnecessary expenses, and unexpected red tape that make single family dwellings, multi-unit housing, and mixed-use modern construction difficult to attain. We can solve this issue, but we must stop the politics of do-nothingism to score political points. The people of Senate District 28 and the people of Colorado deserve concrete steps to meet the end goal of home ownership.\n\nWEISSMAN: Cost, cost cost, particularly of housing. I will continue to work to address both on the supply side (for example running bills or supporting other legislators’ bills that drive funding to build more affordable units) and the demand side (helping people meet the cost of housing and/or getting more value for their housing dollar through things like strengthening renters’ rights; improving protections for mobile park residents; and eliminating abusive fees on renters). My years-long work on various tax issues also has a major component of helping people afford the cost of housing, through things like increasing the Earned Income Tax Credit and creating the senior income tax credit.\n\nThe Legislature passed a few key land use bills this year aimed at increasing housing development. What is the state’s role, if any, to increase development and density to address the affordable housing stock issue?\n\nKEITH: The bills recently passed were well-intentioned and they should have an impact on the current housing crisis. Nevertheless, there remains much to be done to make Colorado an affordable, safe, and practical place to live and work. Specifically, we must dispense with party labels and begin and remind ourselves of our sacred duty to the families who rely on us to protect this great state.\n\nWe must revisit popular bills which would make condominium construction quicker and easier in Colorado. In fact, the bill was so popular that it garnered more than 70% in popular support prior to its defeat last term. This is unfortunate. The people deserve quality mixed-use developments which bring local grocery stores and small businesses closer to our higher density neighborhoods. This act would nearly eliminate food deserts and limit the impact of store relocations similar to a Wal-Mart that chose to close their location in Senate District 28; thus, depriving over 100,000 District residents easy access to fresh produce and quality food to feed their families.\n\nFurthermore, we must proactively address Colorado’s sustainable future by framing the housing issue as a state-wide crisis as opposed to a local Denver/Aurora challenge. A more effective approach to how Colorado grows and supports our whole economy will make sure that the decisions we make today will sustain our state tomorrow. This requires respect for one’s peers and for all voices to have input in problem resolution.\n\nWEISSMAN: The 2024 legislative session in particular shows that the state can play two key roles. The first involves prioritizing state funding (e.g. competitive grants) for localities that choose to partner with the state on demonstrated state priorities – for example in HB24-1152 there is funding for cities that choose to help home owners develop ADUs. The second involves the increasing reality that the intersection of zoning and housing a mixed matter of state and local concern. Legislation eliminating arbitrary caps on how many people may choose to share a home is one such example. Another aspect of the “ADU” bill 1152 is another example, preventing localities from restricting homeowner property rights to build an ADU if a homeowner wants, as long as building codes re health & safety are complied with.\n\nWhat is the state’s role in mitigating the effects of climate change on citizens and what specific environmental policies would you support in the Legislature?\n\nKEITH: Colorado lies at the crossroads of several critical threats to our community due to climate change: massive wildfires, dangerous hailstorms, stifling heat waves, and unpredictable air quality. While we can control only so much of this global crisis from the position of our state, it is my commitment to approach our responsibility from multiple angles. That is, we must work to prevent causes where possible by reducing our carbon footprint responsibly, expedite responses to crises when they occur, and to mitigate impacts including offering full support to those impacted by climate events. As the world economy changes, we must ensure that our citizens are leading the movement for high-paying and cutting edge renewable energy jobs.\n\nColorado, similar to several Western states, is subject to the unpredictability of climate change — water shortages, wildfire risks, extreme heat and sudden cold snaps. We have, in the past, worked to build minor relationships with those states which have borne enduring outcomes. For example, the Colorado Water Congress is a marked example of collegial interstate partnership. However, we must expand upon this type of partnership and work to effectively resource programs that will address our needs such as multi-state compacts to build and maintain helicopter and plane-based wildfire containment and mitigation strategies. We must also modernize our forecasting and relationship to our water resources.\n\nWEISSMAN: Any state and CO in particular needs to play a leadership role both because it is the right and necessary thing to do and because we have model & develop functional policies that can hopefully be emulated at the federal level. I have worked on this issue for most of my time as a representative, including serving 5 sessions on the House Energy & Environment Committee. Two of my biggest pieces of legislation in this realm were HB23-1272 to create various tax credits to help individuals and businesses utilize less polluting technologies like EVs, e-bikes, and heat pumps and HB21-1266, the Environmental Justice Act, that set specific climate pollution goals.\n\nHow can the Legislature most effectively address cost-of-living concerns for Coloradans across all backgrounds, including income levels and homeowner/renter status?\n\nKEITH: We continue to suffer the economic aftershocks of the COVID-19 pandemic. Thousands of businesses closed and there were instances of price gouging resulting in costs of living increasing throughout the nation. Colorado has always been a small business state — we support those who live and work in our communities.\n\nWe must work together to revive competition and a tenacious sense of service in Colorado. When choice and innovation flourish, companies who engage in price gouging are held accountable by their competitors who can deliver goods and services at a more reasonable price. I will work to support the creation of a new generation of local businesses, and especially seek to enhance our programs that train, support, and offer grants to women- and minority-owned small businesses in our state.\n\nWEISSMAN: Most us have heard the saying “we’re all in the same boat.” I think a greater truth is “we’re all in the same storm but in different boats.” Hundreds of thousands of people in our state are “housing cost burdened” meaning more than 30% of income toward housing. A shocking number are further “extremely housing cost burdened” meaning more than 50% of income is spent toward housing. Home owners feel the brunt of property taxes directly and I have worked on that issue directly via SB22-238 to reduce property taxes $700M over two years and supported this year’s major property tax bill. Renters experience property tax increases indirectly through rent increases (approximately 15-20% of rent is attributable to property taxes). I have supported a wide variety of what one might call renters’ rights bills to address other aspects of the costs of housing for renters, such as improving our “warranty of habitability” laws (requirement of a landlord to maintain safe premises as a part of the lease). We have to start from the reality that all but the most well off in our state have experienced the home price spikes of the last couple years in some impactful way, if not profoundly so.\n\nDo you support deeper property tax cuts through ballot initiatives this year that would override the Legislature’s property tax work from the most recent session?\n\nKEITH: The voice of Colorado’s voters is paramount and I support popular measures that help us better understand and consider that which is right for our state. I am deeply supportive of the work our leaders performed during Gov. Polis’ special session.\n\nI am concerned that subsequent tax cuts will force our neighbors to weigh how much we treasure other initiatives voters have passed like universal pre-k against minor tax reductions that do not directly benefit the many who rent properties in Colorado. We must work to better address the cost of living crisis in Colorado by focusing on measurable outcomes for our neighbors.\n\nWEISSMAN: No. Ballot measures to implement California-style caps or to make deep cuts with no solution at all to make up the costs to things like our schools are irresponsible and dangerous. I supported the bipartisan legislative compromise to strike a balance between fundings things people want us to fund – like schools and county services like healthcare and roads – and holding down property tax bills for homeowners (and thus indirectly renters) and business owners.\n\nMany Coloradans are listing their top issue this election year as democracy and good governance through the statewide Voter Voices project. Do you find any common ground with members of the opposite party, and how important is bipartisanship in your political philosophy?\n\nKEITH: A key component of leadership is building broad consensus to execute your program. It is difficult to lead when you intentionally exclude others based on their political philosophy. Ultimately we must seek outcomes that benefit all of our citizens, regardless of political philosophy. I am running to help ensure that we can build a pragmatic legislature that focuses on how we, together, can find common ground. Leaders should want a Colorado that works for everyone.\n\nWEISSMAN: I have repeatedly found common ground with members of the other party on subjects from government transparency to criminal justice to veterans’ issues to supporting survivors of crimes to property taxes. Particularly as a member of the majority party, it’s important to start from the place that policy ideas are fundamentally good or bad before they Democratic or Republican. I am happy to support a good idea from the other party, or to propose amendments to such a bill if it’s not quite there yet but can get there.\n\nYou are running against a current state lawmaker. Are there any votes they have taken in the Legislature you disagree with? What are they and why would you have voted differently?\n\nKEITH: As a Democrat and long-time resident of Aurora, I am proud that the work of our leaders across the years has helped push our community forward and built a brighter Colorado. My opponent has taken several stances in the recent past which, as a father, cause me grave concern.\n\nJust this year my opponent chose to kill a common sense bill that addressed the crime of gun theft in Colorado. Currently, improper storage of a firearm is a greater crime than theft of that firearm from someone’s home. The bill, HB24-1162 sought to address that inequity and make clear that firearm theft is a serious offense. This reasonable bill would save lives and provide better protection for our community at a time when District 28 residents express concern about the increased influx of firearms that maim or kill.\n\nIndeed this is a troubling trend that has continued. Last year my opponent elected to vote “no” on a bill that would have made it a felony to intentionally commit indecent exposure toward a minor (see HB23-1135). The bill received unanimous support by our state Senate, including Sen. Rhonda Fields, the current senator for SD28.\n\nWhat is one bill, vote or other legislative action you’ve taken that you feel best demonstrates your qualification for reelection?\n\nWEISSMAN: HB21-1311 & HB21-1312 — this was a pair of bills I sponsored with Rep. Sirota that year. They were very complex in terms of both policy and politics but we got them done. Together they made some of the biggest changes to Colorado tax law in decades, increasing the Earned Income Tax Credit for working families; funding the Child Tax Credit for the first time in Colorado; reducing taxation on Social Security income; eliminating the Business Personal Property Tax for many small businesses; supporting employee-owned businesses through new, nation-leading tax credits; and keeping the state’s budget in balance by reducing or eliminating special interest tax breaks that were costing the state millions. From start to finish, we negotiated with members of our own party; the other party; the governor’s office; and various interest organizations who are present at the capitol; and we made some changes along the way in response to those negotiations. Bottom line, this was a huge amount of work, involving research, technical details, and navigating complex and sometimes competing priorities but we stuck with it to the end, because it was the right and necessary thing to do for our constituents and our state. That is how I view the job of public service."
