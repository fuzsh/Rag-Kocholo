If you havenâ€™t yet, be sure to join The City of Groveland, once a month at our 2nd Friday Block Party at Lake David Park!

We strive to ensure our 2nd Friday Block Party at Lake David will be a monthly staple in the community filled with local shopping, community involvement, and live entertainment.

There is always something for everyone!

Our goal is to provide consistency as well, so you will always have a multitude of artisan vendors, food trucks, live entertainment (DJ and/or band), and we always have a kid zone!

The 2nd Friday Block Party is held on the second Friday of each month from 5:00 pm - 9:00 pm on Lake Ave in front of the Lake David Park Amphitheater.
