Nevada and Maine could see the number of openly gay state lawmakers triple after Victory Fund-endorsed candidates advanced in primary elections last night.

In Maine House primaries, Andrew McLean and Terry Morrison were unopposed, while Matt Moonen (pictured) convincingly beat his opponent. All three Democrats are running in Democratic-performing districts.

In Nevada, David Parks was unopposed in his primary for reelection to the State Senate. Andrew Martin and James Healey won their Democratic primaries for seats in the Nevada Assembly.

“These wins are great news for LGBT Mainers and Nevadans,” said Tiffany Muller, vice president for political affairs at the Victory Fund. “Each state is now a step closer to strengthening LGBT representation in their state legislatures.”

UPDATE: One more big win last night for LGBT candidates, as an out lesbian beat an incumbent state senator in Nevada. Patricia Spearman will become Nevada’s first and only openly LGBT woman elected to the state legislature, as she faces no Republican opponent this fall. She will also be one of just a handful of openly LGBT African Americans elected to state legislatures in the U.S.
