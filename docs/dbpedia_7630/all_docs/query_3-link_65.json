        "text": "This article addresses the historical gap concerning the Brazilian composer and pianist Henrique Oswald (1852 – 1931). Oswald spent many years in Europe and, back to Brazil, he and his music were accused of not being \" Brazilian enough \". Notwithstanding, Oswald is one of the greatest Brazilian composers of all times. So far, however, he has not achieved the historical recognition he deserves. I. \" By and large, the historian will get the kind of facts he wants \" History's raw material are human facts and it is for historians to decide which of those are historical, what means to have collective importance among the uncountable other facts that have not; in other words, historical facts are the tip of an iceberg which is already an iceberg's tip (since the great majority of them will remain inaccessible forever), and their historicity will always rest on human decision. Being a conversation of the present with the past, History lies, to a large extend, in the methods of fact gathering and in the person who gathers and interprets them. As the English historian Edward Hallett Carr (1892-1982) puts, The facts are really not at all like fish on the fishmonger's slab. They are like fish swimming about in a vast and sometimes inaccessible ocean; and what the historian catches will depend, partly on chance, but mainly on what part of the ocean he chooses to fish in and what tackle he chooses to use-these two factors being, of course, determined by the kind of fish he wants to catch. By and large, the historian will get the kind of facts he wants. History means interpretation.[1] No wonder History is full of misinterpretations, gaps, and flaws of all kinds. In the following lines, we will address one those cases, namely that of the Brazilian composer and pianist Henrique José Pedro Maria Carlos Luis Oswald (1852 – 1931), better known as just Henrique Oswald.\n\nThis article discusses how the flux of cultural productions between centre and periphery works, taking as an example the field of music production in France and Brazil in the 1920s. The life trajectories of Jean Cocteau, French poet and painter, and Heitor Villa-Lobos, a Brazilian composer, are taken as the main reference points for the discussion. The article concludes that social actors from the periphery tend themselves to accept the opinions and judgements of the social actors from the centre, taking for granted their definitions concerning the criteria that validate their productions. In July 1923, the Brazilian composer Heitor Villa-Lobos arrived in Paris as a complete unknown. Some five years had passed since his first large-scale concert in Brazil; Villa-Lobos journeyed to Europe with the intention of publicizing his musical output. His entry into the Parisian art world took place through the group of Brazilian modernist painters and writers he had encountered in 1922, immediately before the Modern Art Week in São Paulo. Following his arrival, the composer was invited to a lunch in the studio of the painter Tarsila do Amaral where he met up with, among others, the poet Sérgio Milliet, the pianist João de Souza Lima, the writer Oswald de Andrade and, among the Parisians, the poet Blaise Cendrars, the musician Erik Satie and the poet and painter Jean Cocteau. After the lunch, the artists became engrossed in a lively conversation which drifted into a discussion on the art of musical improvisation. Villa-Lobos, who had already composed an extensive repertoire of piano solos, then sat down to Tarsila's Erard concerto to improvise. Immediately, Jean Cocteau, known for his boutades and his playful behaviour, sat underneath the piano on the ground, \" so he could hear better. \" At the end of Villa-Lobos's improvisation, however, Cocteau returned to his chair and launched a ferocious attack on what he had heard: in his opinion, the music presented by the composer was no more than an emulation of the styles of Debussy and Ravel. Villa-Lobos * I am grateful for the suggestions of Prof. Lygia Sigaud and the two anonymous readers who reviewed this article. Responsibility for its content remains entirely my own.\n\nThe main purpose of this article is to discuss the importance of music to Manuel Araújo Porto Alegre (1806-1879) – an artist and intellectual who had a particular relevance within the first romantic generation in Brazil. The text is divided into five parts. An introduction analyzing the theme from the Intellectual History point of view and from the concept of Coloniality, according to Carlos Altamirano, Jorge Myers, Ângela de Castro Gomes, Patrícia Hansen and Nelson Maldonado-Torres. The second part, seeks to understand Porto Alegre's particular position among the men of letters of Brazil Empire. He was the only one to have specific interests in affirming the importance of Fine Arts in the development of Brazilian society as in the construction of national identity. In the third part, his main ideas about music will be analyzed, in philosophical and historical terms. The fourth part highlights the great relevance that music had among his institutional projects. We will emphasize the Imperial Academy of Fine Arts reform, the support given for the maintenance of the Conservatory as well as his direct involvement in the creation of a \"national opera\". The final considerations will reaffirm the importance that music had for Porto Alegre, stressing its importance in the institutional development of this art in Rio de Janeiro in the nineteenth century."
