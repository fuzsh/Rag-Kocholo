        "text": "Preface\n\nWhen I first heard of racially segregated graduation ceremonies at Ivy League colleges, I was astonished. That was in the Spring of 2016, and despite the recent spread of Black Lives Matter protests and numerous instances of black student groups issuing capital D “Demands,” I still assumed that the ultimate goal of the activists was a just and fair society. We might disagree about how to achieve justice and what exactly fairness might entail, I thought, but surely all Americans agree that racial division is unjust, unfair, and destructive.\n\nI was born in late 1953, a few months before the U.S. Supreme Court issued its decision in Brown v. The Board of Education of Topeka. In that case, the justices decided by a vote of nine to zero to overturn a previous ruling, Plessy v. Ferguson. In this 1896 case, the Supreme Court ruled that the Constitution permitted racial segregation laws in public facilities if the separate facilities were equal in quality. The shorthand for the Plessy decision was \"separate but equal,” and under that rubric Jim Crow segregation reigned in the American South for the next 58 years. The Supreme Court’s decision in Brown demolished the “separate but equal” façade. The justices observed that the legalistic subterfuge of “racially separate” almost never resulted in “facilities” that were of equal quality. Especially in schools, racial segregation generally meant that black students were provided fewer resources, inferior opportunities, and a lesser education.\n\nFor many years, scholars picked over the Supreme Court’s findings in Brown. There have been learned arguments that the Court gave too much weight to some kinds of evidence and not enough to other kinds. But experts and the public alike generally came to agree that the Court was right to overturn Plessy. The separate-but-equal doctrine was unworthy of America. It gave a legal pretext for what everyone knew was a lie: state-sponsored segregation was never meant to be an avenue towards racial equality. It was meant to be what it was: a form of racial oppression. A nation founded on the principle that “All men are created equal,” and on the rule of law, should not have enshrined the idea that the citizens should be divided by race. Whatever the quibbles the experts might have had over how the Supreme Court reached its decision in Brown, Americans came to embrace the central finding that the government should not engage in racial segregation.\n\nI belong to the generation of Americans who grew up believing that this was more than just a legal matter. It was—and is—a moral principle. Segregation is wrong, whether it is imposed by government fiat or by the policy of some private entity. Segregated lunch counters in privately-owned restaurants and segregated movie theatres in privately-owned cinemas were as bad as segregated government facilities.\n\nThe moral certitudes of youth often run into complications as we get older. At some point I began to wonder if my sense that segregation was always bad made sense in contexts such as black churches and black colleges, places where racial segregation was plainly the result of individuals making free choices about how they wished to live their lives. I began to make allowances for these, but I remained committed to the basic principle that racial segregation is wrong—except in certain instances.\n\nMy, and others, willingness to make allowances was anticipated by the Supreme Court. It had evolved the practice of “strict scrutiny.” That meant that any time the government wanted to classify people by race, it had to come up with a compelling reason and sound evidence that it couldn’t accomplish whatever public good it was seeking in another way.\n\nMost Americans don’t go around talking about “strict scrutiny,” but I think we have taken the idea to heart. We think that, generally speaking, it is wrong to treat people differently based on their race, but we do make exceptions. We practice private versions of strict scrutiny.\n\nYet when I heard of racially separate graduation ceremonies at elite colleges, my alarms went off. I could think of no compelling, morally competent reason why colleges would do such a thing. A year after I first heard of these ceremonies, Harvard University decided that it too would hold a racially segregated commencement—an endorsement of the concept that attracted considerable public attention and criticism.1\n\nMy personal alarm over this development is the origin of this collection of studies titled Separate but Equal, Again: Neo-Segregation in American Higher Education.\n\nWho We Are\n\nAs it happened, I was in a position in which I could translate my alarm into action. As president of the National Association of Scholars (NAS), I have some room to choose the issues in higher education we investigate. I thought that NAS should look into the decisions of elite colleges and universities to hold separate graduation ceremonies for black students. How many colleges were doing this? Why? How did the students feel about it? Did some students decline to participate?\n\nThis wasn’t new territory for the NAS. The NAS was founded in 1987 by a network of college and university faculty members, who had begun a few years earlier to assemble as “The Campus Coalition for Democracy.” The Campus Coalition drew together prominent scholars who were worried about the threat to liberal arts education posed by Marxists and by other opponents of the Western tradition. They worried that “relativism” was displacing the pursuit of truth as the core value of higher education. The Campus Coalition for Democracy published a newsletter titled Academic Questions. The flavor of the organization is apparent in the first issue, which featured an excerpt from an article by William Bennett, then Secretary of Education. Bennett championed Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.’s views of moral order, which he identified as at odds with the radical ideology spreading through education:\n\nDr. King’s teachings are an embarrassment and an offense to the posture of cultural relativism, which has come to dominate much of the teaching of social studies in our schools today.\n\nThe difficulty that Dr. King presents to many curriculum “experts” is that he was firmly committed to making “value judgments” and to insisting that some moral teachings are demonstrably superior to others. He taught, for example, that democracy is morally superior to totalitarianism.2\n\nThe Campus Coalition for Democracy’s tough-minded support for moral and intellectual standards attracted broad attention in higher education. This led to its formal organization as the non-profit 501(c)(3) National Association of Scholars in 1987. NAS began as a network of academics determined to defend liberal arts education as a necessary part of preparing students for active citizenship. The motto of the new organization was, “For reasoned scholarship in a free society.” Among other things, NAS set its sights on maintaining race-neutral standards in the academy.\n\nA signal victory in that campaign was the passage in 1996 of a ballot referendum in California, Proposition 209, authored by NAS members Glynn Custred and Tom Wood. Proposition 209, also called the California Civil Rights Initiative, banned the use of racial preferences by state institutions, including public colleges and universities. Many of those colleges and universities have spent decades attempting to subvert the law, but it has withstood numerous legal challenges and become a model for other states.\n\nToday, the NAS has nearly 3,000 members from across the country. We publish a quarterly journal that preserves the name of the Campus Coalition’s newsletter, Academic Questions. We hold regional conferences. We intervene on behalf of scholars tangled in the machinery of political correctness. We advocate for public policies that will improve higher education. And we publish long, deeply researched reports on matters that the higher education establishment would prefer the public not pay attention to. Among our recent contributions are What Does Bowdoin Teach? How a Contemporary Liberal Arts College Shapes Students; Making Citizens: How American Universities Teach Civics; and Outsourced to China. The last of these prompted Congress to enact restrictions on the ability of the Chinese government to run programs on American college campuses.\n\nThis isn’t the place for a long history of the NAS, but it is important to underscore that our opposition to racial segregation in higher education goes way back and has involved numerous efforts. Most recently NAS was the first organization to sign on as a formal supporter of Students for Fair Admissions in its lawsuit against Harvard University for discriminating against Asian applicants on the basis of race.\n\nThus, when the black-only graduation ceremonies came to my attention, I had the tools to do something. First I wrote a grant application, because nothing can be done without financial support. The Arthur N. Rupe Foundation of Santa Barbara, California came forward with a generous grant to get us started. Then the challenge was to find a dedicated researcher to help us execute the project.\n\nDion J. Pierre\n\nFinding a qualified researcher to pursue this study proved to be a challenge. Anyone who chooses to pursue research that cuts against the grain of today’s identity politics is likely to face recrimination. The tactics by which the academic left enforces conformity are not gentle and not always limited to harsh words. This prospect deterred many candidates until we came upon Mr. Dion J. Pierre. Dion is a recent graduate of Hofstra University who had spent a year in Washington, D.C. working for Walter Russell Mead at the Public Interest Fellowship. With eyes wide open, he was willing to venture where others had shied away.\n\nDion is an outgoing young man, a voracious reader who devours books on Western history and biographies of great leaders (Churchill, Grant, Reagan). From the start he was eager to prove himself and to improve himself by acquiring the hard discipline of an NAS researcher. He defines himself as a conservative—sometimes modified as “black conservative”—but I would define him as an intellectual who, at this point, has no sure identity. He is attracted by ideas and tries them on for size. Perhaps his proudest point is that he refused all the advantages that Hofstra University was willing to award him because of his race. That wasn’t a cost-free decision. Because of it, he graduated with a mountain of debt. His NAS salary can remove only a few pebbles from that mountain.\n\nI hope our neo-segregation project will change his situation for the better. What emerges from the pages of our reports on Yale and Wesleyan is an unusually talented writer. The ideas in these reports are entirely Dion’s and so too most of the writing. I am his editor and, as editors are wont to do, I’ve rearranged text, cut out sections that dragged, reworded some sentences, and here and there added some paragraphs of my own. But the reports remain Dion’s work from conception to final cut. It adds up to a powerfully original work of scholarship and a major contribution to understanding American race relations.\n\nA Thesis\n\nI started this project believing that the black-only graduations were evidence of an unfortunate backward slip. I’m not naïve about these matters. My 2003 book, Diversity: The Invention of a Concept, tracked in detail how Americans had absorbed the dubious logic of racial division as a supposedly positive force in our national life. I noted that diversity succeeded in meaning opposite things to different groups of students. It was sold to white students mainly as the opportunity to mix freely with students from many dissimilar backgrounds. But at the same time it was sold to “students of color” as the opportunity to form enclaves of their own within majority white institutions. This dual-message marketing of diversity started in the late 1980s, and since then whole professions of diversity counselors and diversity deans have grown up with a vested interest in keeping these conceptions alive.\n\nDiversity, as I said then, not only appealed with a different message to different demographics, it also mothered different emotions. On one side it encouraged a feeling of benevolence and pan-ethnic unity; on the other side, it fostered a sense of grievance, resentment, and simmering anger. I worried that the angry side of the diversity ideology was likely to play into a growing susceptibility of Americans for angry theatrics and showmanship—an emergent angri-culture—that I described in another book, A Bee in the Mouth: Anger in America Now (2007). I hereby claim my credentials as a prophet.\n\nBe that as it may, the Obama presidency and the growing racial integration of American life suggested to me that the crude forms of segregation—even if voluntary—were starting to fade from everyday life. If so, the creation of black-only graduation ceremonies might be understood as a last ditch effort of the professional diversiphiles to sustain a separatist message even as the students themselves no longer felt much attraction to it.\n\nDion disagreed.\n\nFrom the start he said that neo-segregation was nothing new. It had been going on for decades and was still gaining momentum. He was willing to trace its deep origins back to the black separatist movements of the early twentieth century and even earlier into the Reconstruction era. The black college students in the 1960s who began to demand various forms of separation under the banner of Malcolm X could consciously look back to a long tradition of black separatism. That tradition had always been a marginal part of the black community. Oddly, at the moment of the greatest achievement of the Civil Rights Movement, when the prospects of racial integration had never seemed brighter, a new spirit of self-imposed racial segregation descended on some of the most successful and privileged members of the black community: students who had been admitted to elite colleges and universities.\n\nThis sounded unlikely to me, but I’ve learned in running research projects that it is best to give your lead researcher room to run. If Dion could not substantiate his thesis, he’d have to return to mine: that neo-segregation was a new, and probably temporary, misstep on the path to further racial integration.\n\nPlainly, Dion made his case—at least with me. Readers will have to decide for themselves.\n\nNeo-Segregation, By the Numbers\n\nOur study examined three universities in depth: Yale and Wesleyan. Originally there were others and we may get back to them. But these three elite private universities in New England provide the granite floor for our conclusions. We know how neo-segregation was born and how it grew at Yale and Wesleyan. Our study, however, also includes data on 173 other four-year colleges and universities across the country. These include public and private institutions, large and small, representing all fifty states.\n\nWhat we found was that neo-segregation is widespread if not pervasive. About 46 percent (80 colleges out of 173 surveyed) segregate student orientation programs; 43 percent (75 colleges out of the total) offer segregated residential arrangements; and 72 percent (125 colleges out of the total) segregate graduation ceremonies. Though these arrangements are ostensibly voluntary, students can’t easily opt out. We tracked numerous indicators of neo-segregation, from “Diversity Fly-Ins,” (68 percent of the total) where colleges offer minority students an expense-paid segregated preview of the experience that awaits them should they enroll, to segregated alumni groups.\n\nThe heart of all this, no doubt, are the segregated ethnic and racial clubs—segregation having long ago spread to many minority groups besides blacks. Counting the number of ethnic and racial clubs has proved daunting. Is a “Spanish Club” an opportunity for students learning Spanish to practice their language skills or an enclave for students of Latin-American origin? Uncertainties like that prevent us from offering an exact count of colleges in our sample that have segregated clubs of various types. But in our 173-college sample, we found only one college that had no segregated clubs. That is St. Louis Christian College. How long this tiny college (as of 2017-18, 82 students, 31 of whom are black) will maintain this distinction is unclear. In 2015, black students there organized and issued their own list, “The Demands,” outlining steps towards repairing “the institutionally racist nature of the College.”3\n\nThe segregated clubs are typically connected to ethnic “cultural centers,” which implies a dedicated physical space, a director, and professional and clerical staff. In our sample, 85 percent of the colleges and universities have “multicultural centers.” Black cultural centers exist at 34 percent of the institutions in our sample. In many cases, such as Stanford University, the institution hosts both a multicultural center and a black cultural center. Stanford also has a Latino Cultural Center; an Asian-American Cultural Center; and a Native American Cultural Center. The profusion of such centers correlates with the profusion of segregated ethnic and racial clubs.\n\nTo give a sense of what our survey data look like, here is the section on Swarthmore College, which ranks unusually low in neo-segregation programs:\n\nAnd here is the tabular data for Dartmouth, which ranks unusually high:\n\nThis data lend itself to many kinds of analysis beyond what we have already done. Is neo-segregation more common in private or public colleges? Does it reflect the size of the student body? Is it more common in some regions of the country than others? Does the kind of neo-segregation (diversity fly-ins, segregated orientation programs, segregated advisors, segregated residential facilities, etc.) correlate with other aspects of the institution? Do less prosperous colleges have more or less neo-segregation than more wealthy colleges?\n\nSeven Questions\n\nHaving established that neo-segregation exists in American higher education, we come to some crucial questions. Does it matter? Is it harmful or beneficial or some combination of the two? Should the public care? Should the students?\n\nBehind these questions lie still more basic ones: How do we balance equality with freedom? To what extent is neo-segregation part and parcel of the multiculturalist agenda in American higher education? And what, if anything, should be done about neo-segregation?\n\nOur answers are embedded in the reports, but it would be asking a lot of the reader to say, “Go look.” The reports are necessarily long and detailed. What follows in this section are succinct answers. Context, however, contributes a great deal and we urge the reader of this short guide to venture up the mountain trail to see the bigger picture for himself.\n\nDoes neo-segregation matter?\n\nThe division of students on campus into separate racial and ethnic groups is the primary social reality of most American college students today. It isn’t incidental to the experience of college. It is central. Every student knows about and is frequently and forcefully reminded of it. Colleges and universities spend hundreds of millions of dollars every year to reinforce neo-segregation. So, yes, it matters.\n\nIs neo-segregation harmful or beneficial, or some combination of the two?\n\nSegregation of racial and ethnic groups is intended to benefit the members of the minority groups who are thought by their college administrations to be vulnerable and in need of the life-enhancing benefits of group solidarity. The most readily apparent harm from such segregation is that it fosters a sense of insecurity. The members of the segregated group are taught to fear other groups, especially white students. They are encouraged to see themselves as victims or potential victims, and as heirs to past grievances. Training students to see themselves as vulnerable to the transgressions of a larger, intolerant or bigoted community is poor preparation for life in American society. Students who venture outside the segregated bubble may indeed encounter some hostile attitudes and racial stereotypes, but surely it is better to learn how to deal with these realities than to hide from them.\n\nSegregation is harmful in another respect as well. It motivates an unending search for evidence that the larger community is hostile to the minority group. The concepts of “microaggressions” and “implicit bias” are the weaponized versions of this search. The music that accompanies segregation is a combination of anger and suspicion. Sentencing bright young people to four years of intensive isolation in a segregated community that plays this music on endless loop demoralizes students and undermines their education.\n\nOn balance, neo-segregation is harmful to those who are segregated. It is also harmful to the whole community of students.\n\nShould the public care about neo-segregation?\n\nAt least superficially, neo-segregation is a personal choice. Colleges and universities are not forcing minority students to join segregated social groups, take segregated classes, or march in segregated graduations. But the voluntary character of neo-segregation is illusory. Colleges encourage minority students when they are still in high school to apply as minority students and to capitalize on their minority identities. Many colleges have “diversity fly-ins” where they invite minority students, usually at the college’s expense, to special segregated sessions that sell the college as an attractive destination. The students who attend as recognized minorities often receive benefits, sometimes in the form of extra financial aid: a practice that is illegal but still widespread. When these students arrive, they are often conscripted into a segregated orientation.\n\nThose steps are “voluntary” in name only. It would take an unusually adroit and determined student to avoid them—and a very brave one. The segregated orientation programs are the gateway drug to many other forms of segregation because they mean that the first classmates the students meet and get to know belong to the same ethnic group. The typical vulnerability and social awkwardness of freshmen is channeled into reinforcing minority identity and preparing students for the security of a segregated support group. Those who resist are exposed to both isolation and ridicule.\n\nThe public should care because neo-segregation is the breeding ground of racial conflict in American society. Neo-segregation inculcates in young people the readiness to cling to a victim identity at the expense of becoming a positive member of the larger community. No doubt a large portion of the racial grievance politics we see in society at large these days is the carefully nurtured product of campus neo-segregation. We as a people are increasingly self-divided and well-supplied with stereotypes and invective to use against each other. Our descent into such polarization has many causes but neo-segregation is among the deepest.\n\nShould students care about neo-segregation?\n\nYes. Neo-segregation is one of the forces that has fragmented the curriculum. This is a story told in most detail in our study of Yale, and it connects with another NAS study, The Vanishing West. The latter tracks the disappearance of Western Civilization survey courses from the 1960s, when they were the mainstay of undergraduate liberal arts programs, to 2010, by which time they were nearly as rare as courses on Egyptian hieroglyphics. What happened? The answer we give in the Yale report is that the black students demanded—and Yale agreed—that Western Civilization requirements were racist and irrelevant.\n\nThis came to noticeable public attention in January 1987 when Jesse Jackson led some 500 student protesters at Stanford in a chant of “Hey hey, ho ho, Western culture’s got to go!” The Western culture he was referring to was Stanford’s Western Civilization survey course, which the Stanford administration soon abolished.4\n\nNo single course could take the place of the Western Civilization survey course, which served as an armature for the whole curriculum. Numerous other courses built on the Western Civilization survey. Without it, the curriculum dissolved into fragments, and faculty members could no longer proceed in confidence that all the students knew the basics. For students this fragmentation was a liberation, at first. What they weren’t learning was invisible to them. Suddenly the opportunities to study seemed endless. One of those opportunities was the newly created Afro-American Studies program.\n\nThe creation of Afro-American Studies at Yale, and soon after at many other colleges and universities, wasn’t the sole cause of the demise of the old curriculum, but it was a powerful contributing cause. And it remains part of the explanation of how neo-segregation hurts all students. It turned the college curriculum into a moonscape of courses whose only common thread is conveying a picture of myriad grievances against a civilization of which most of the students are largely ignorant.\n\nThis was a high price to pay to compensate for the discomfort black students felt in the mid-1960s and ensuring decades for having to learn something about the European past. Neo-segregation, of course, hurts students in other ways as well. It narrows their social experience; it gives them a false picture of life in contemporary America; and it fosters the racial animus that it supposedly aims to eradicate.\n\nHow do we balance equality with freedom?\n\nHere we move to an important question of political theory. One of the lessons of American history is that racial division inevitably leads to injustice. Racial division is incompatible with justice, because justice demands that the same standards apply to all. Few if any Americans believe that division into racial groups is compatible with equal protection of the law, let alone equality in everyday life.\n\nBut Americans also believe in their right to choose their own friends and form their own communities. When we do that, forms of segregation often happen.\n\nThus our freedom to choose our friends, make our own families, and form our own associations can result in a form of racial segregation. There is a conflict between our search for equality and our enjoyment of personal freedom. We can’t wish this conflict away. It is real and it is important. Segregation is the path of division, but at least in some circumstances it is also the result of free people making choices for themselves.\n\nIn American higher education this conflict has escalated to the point of overt racial antagonism. How do we balance the pursuit of equality with our freedom of association? We don’t have an answer that will liberate us once and for all from the dilemma, but we do have a recommendation. An essential first step for managing the conflict between these two principles is to stop making the conflict worse. Let informal segregation take its course in the texture of everyday American life, but don’t plot to create even more. Neo-segregation in American higher education isn’t something that just happened. As we show in these reports, neo-segregation is the result of decisions made by college administrators (most of whom were white) who thought it would be expedient to allow blacks to create self-enclosed enclaves, and then further decided that allowing was not enough: they would encourage the formation of enclaves and nurture them with an ever-expanding abundance of resources.\n\nTo what extent is neo-segregation part and parcel of the multiculturalist agenda in American higher education?\n\nNeo-segregation is a term we have invented to describe a particular phenomenon in American higher education that has not received the attention it deserves. But neo-segregation is part of a larger set of developments that has a name of its own: multiculturalism. We don’t want to expand our focus too far beyond our central topic, but it is important to recognize that neo-segregation is the main wrecking ball in the effort to demolish America’s sense of itself as “one nation.” Our national unity has never been all that secure a thing. After all, as a nation we are a composite of peoples of different ethnicities, historical experiences, regional subcultures, religions, and aspirations. Securing the blessings of liberty along with mutual toleration and a love of country has often demanded a great deal of ingenuity from both our leaders and from ordinary people.\n\nMulticulturalism, though often presented in a spirit of joyful celebration of our differences, aims at something vastly different from love of country. It aims to elevate our differences above our commonalities. After the diversity quilt has been hung on display on the Kindergarten wall, it proceeds to excavate the grievances of each group against the whole. “Allies” are welcome, but the very word denotes a common enemy, and the enemy is the dominant culture of the past: our bygone sense of being one people, despite our differences.\n\nHigher education is the font of multiculturalism in America. It is an anti-American doctrine in a new sense of that Cold War term: anti-American in that it embodies a basic aversion to America’s common values. Perhaps it is more circumspect to call multiculturalism post-American or post-national in character. Those words apply too. Multiculturalism isn’t limited to the United States. It is a cause that encompasses an elite attitude in many developed nations that the nation state itself is obsolescent and should be replaced by a new order in which we are all “global citizens.” This would-be new order comprises post-states such as the European Union and various international entities. It also has its own cherished causes such as fighting climate change, promoting open borders, and ending post-colonial exploitation.\n\nOur purpose in this report is not to sweep all these many pieces of the multicultural ethos into a basket that makes them the result of neo-segregation. Each of the various strands of multiculturalism has its own history. We have explored some of them in other reports, such as Sustainability: American Higher Education’s New Fundamentalism, and The Disappearing Continent. Our point here is simply that neo-segregation is one of the key forces driving the fragmentation of America’s common identity. That makes it integral to the multiculturalist agenda.\n\nOur larger project, “Separate but Equal, Again: Neo-Segregation in American Higher Education,” connects with the initiative undertaken by the Claremont Institute, Multiculturalism vs. America.”5\n\nWhat, if anything, should be done about neo-segregation?\n\nOur aim is to bring to the surface a widespread phenomenon that has been under-reported and that has largely escaped the critical attention of parents, alumni, and institutional supporters. Of course, some of these are on the side of the multiculturalists and the neo-segregationists. If they read our reports, they can take satisfaction in how well the college administrators have advanced their cause. Others—we hope a substantial majority—will be alarmed by our findings, as I was alarmed when I first heard about those segregated commencement ceremonies.\n\nIf they are sufficiently alarmed, they will set about changing the institutions they care about. Neo-segregation will not bring itself to a close. It is a thriving business in higher education, supported by true-believers and a well-paid class of neo-segregation professionals who will not give an inch without a fight—and without calling their critics’ character into question. The time has come to bring down the curtain on neo-segregation the way that the Supreme Court in Brown and the Civil Rights Movement brought down the curtain on the old forms of segregation. It won’t happen without a struggle. Consider this a summons to a new civil rights movement—one that promises a truly post-racial America.\n\nRace at Yale Today\n\nSeveral incidents in the last few years have cemented the view among many Americans that Yale University is a hotbed of irrational racial antagonism. Millions have viewed the 25-minute video of Professor Nicholas Christakis surrounded on the quad by a mob of about 100 undergraduate students on November 5, 2015.6 The students, mostly black, were confronting him over a memo his wife, Erika Christakis, had released a few days earlier. In that email, she had urged students to tolerate Halloween costumes that some might find irritating or offensive.7 In the video, Nicholas Christakis tries in vain to explain the email and to respond constructively to the barrage of outrageous accusations. “You are disgusting,” shouts one of the students.\n\nAnother student, Jerelyn Luther (’16), commanded Christakis to “be quiet!” and asserted that Yale’s college masters were charged with fostering “a place of comfort and home for students that live in Silliman.” (Silliman is the residential college at which Christakis at the time served as “master.”) Erika Christakis’s email to students, she continued, went “against your position of master.” Christakis responded that he disagreed with Luther’s description of his role as master. At this, Luther shrieked, “Then why the fuck did you accept the position? Who the fuck hired you? You should step down! It is not about creating an intellectual space! Do you understand that?”8 In fact, Luther had served on the search committee that selected Professor Christakis to be Master of Silliman College—an irony that went largely unreported.9\n\nThe filmed portion of the confrontation lasted about 25 minutes.10\n\nThe vitriol documented in the video was not isolated to this one incident. Earlier that day, a group of minority students had staged a “chalking event”—drawing pictures on the sidewalks—to protest an alleged incident in which a fraternity had turned away some black women who tried to enter a party. Yale College Dean Jonathan Holloway came to the event, which turned into a three-hour emotional confrontation. Students said, “they were disappointed in [Holloway] both as a black administrator and as a black man.” The students, many in tears, urged Dean Holloway to use his position to advance their racial agenda, though the reports are not clear as to what exactly this would have entailed.11\n\nHolloway mounted a table and declared his determination, in the Yale Daily News’s account, “to more fully embrace his responsibilities as a prominent black administrator and professor of African-American Studies.” This commitment did not last long. In November 2016, Holloway announced that he was resigning his Yale position to become provost of Northwestern University.12\n\nOn June 13, 2016, a 38-year old man employed by Yale as a dishwasher, Corey Menefee, took a broomstick and smashed a historic window in the dining hall of Yale’s Calhoun College.13 The window depicted slaves picking cotton. Yale promptly fired Menefee or, more exactly, made him resign to avoid prosecution.14 Menefee, however, was proud of his vandalism and gathered supporters. On July 12, according to the Yale Daily News, “dozens of supporters met him on the steps of the New Haven courthouse before his court date [on] July 12.”15 Menefee suddenly became both a campus hero and a center of national attention. He was interviewed on National Public Radio and ran a successful GoFundMe campaign to assist “him and his family while he is unemployed.”16 Menefee told NPR that, “I mean, you can only imagine the type of emotions that run through an African-American, if I can say that, seeing a picture of two slaves—two actual slaves picking cotton.”17\n\nThe Yale administration promptly caved. Yale asked the State Attorney to drop the charges against Menefee and he was rehired.18 Soon after this, on February 11, 2017, Yale President Peter Salovey announced that Yale was changing the name of Calhoun College—which honored South Carolina Senator and slavery apologist John C. Calhoun—to “Grace Hopper College.” Dr. Hopper was a computer scientist and distinguished naval officer. Salovey was responding to the demands of Yale students who had made changing the name of Calhoun College a key part of their program for a “more racially inclusive Yale.” 19 The students had launched an online petition a few weeks after the Christakis incident demanding the name change. It eventually gained 9,000 signatures. The petition characterizes Calhoun’s legacy as “one of racism and blood.”20 When Salovey finally conceded, one student, Dillon Miller, was elated: “A lot of [my suitemates last year] lost the majority of their sophomore year pushing for this change, and to see them out here dancing and smiling and knowing that their work is fruitful is the biggest blessing.”21\n\nYale’s Menefee-inspired purge of racially offensive names and imagery continued. On August 22, 2017, Yale announced it was removing a stone carving above a door to the Sterling Memorial Library. The 1929 carving depicted an American Indian with a bow and a Puritan settler with a musket. The new censors first put a patch over the musket to obscure the settler’s violent intent. But the plan was to chisel out the ornament entirely and move it to an undisclosed location.\n\nIn the meantime, Yale was making sure that the contributions of the students who had mobbed Professor Christakis were properly recognized. In May 2017 Yale awarded its Nakanishi Prize (bestowed on “two graduating seniors who, while maintaining high academic achievement, have provided exemplary leadership in enhancing race and/or ethnic relations at Yale College”) to Abdul-Razak Mohammed Zachariah and Alexandra Zina Barlowe.22 Zachariah and Barlowe participated in the Christakis mobbing, with Zachariah at one point taking a leading part. Zachariah lectures the sociology professor about the chasm that separates blacks from whites. He explains, “Nobody has ever been racist to you because they can’t be racist to you.”23\n\nIn May 2018, another supposedly racial confrontation ensued. A white female student in one of the residence halls discovered a black female student sleeping in a lounge late at night. She “flipped on the lights, told her she had no right to sleep there, and called the campus police.”24 As it happened, the napping student lived in the same residence hall and the Yale campus police soon sorted things out. In the aftermath, however, Yale grievance activists took hold of the narrative. Heather Gerken, dean of the Yale Law School, emailed the law school community claiming that when the Yale police checked the identity of the napping student, they were acting as part of a “corrosive” pattern of police treating black students unfairly. Black students climbed on board this bandwagon and the matter escalated all the way to President Salovey who, in Heather Mac Donald’s account, “circulated a missive to the entire university declaring what was at stake in the incident: ‘discrimination and racism at Yale.’ He admonished Yale’s faculty, staff, and students: ‘We must neither condone nor excuse racism, prejudice, or discrimination at Yale.’”25\n\nIn November 2018, two masked people posted flyers on the Yale campus with the provocative label “@ white students’ union of yale.” One flyer declared “We Out Here. We Been Here. We Ain’t leaving. We Are Loved.” Another sported a quotation from John C. Calhoun. The culprits have not been identified and it is not clear whether this was the work of white nationalists or someone else attempting to foment the suspicion that white nationalists are lurking unidentified in the Yale community. In any case, the Yale administration responded with strenuous efforts to root out the perpetrators.26\n\nThese events at Yale in the last several years point to a university campus in the midst of racial hysteria. They are not, however, the complete picture, and they do little to illuminate the institutional ferment from which these events sprung. Understanding the genesis of the current racial animus can help answer a number of perplexing questions: How did it happen that Yale reached the point where a senior and well-respected professor could be subjected to public racial bullying without anyone in authority intervening? How did it happen that a senior black administrator was harangued by black students for failing to advance a “black” agenda? How did Yale become so timid as to countenance an employee smashing a window out of racial resentment? What moved President Salovey to accede to the demands that the university change the name of Calhoun College?\n\nThe racial dynamics at Yale today are the result of a particular history—a history of decisions made as long ago as the 1960s. It is a history of racial bargaining. Yale sought to bring racial integration to its campus but found, at each step of the way, that integration came at a steep price. Part of that price was to accede to what became, in fact, new forms of racial separation. Yale’s attempts to integrate ironically became, over the course of decades, the entrenchment of segregation. In this part of our report, we trace that history.\n\nSince the fall semester of 2015, racial tensions at Yale have increased, as evidenced by the mobbing of Professor Christakis, the demand that Dean Holloway place race loyalty above his professional responsibilities, the movement to excuse Corey Menefee after he vandalized a stained glass window, the escalation of criticism of the police after they checked the identity of a napping black student, and the renaming of Calhoun College.\n\nSources and Procedure\n\nYale has been the subject of innumerable histories, memoirs, and specialized studies. We have drawn on previous work freely but have relied most extensively on the archives of the Yale Daily News. The student newspaper serves as an especially valuable witness to contemporary events because of its record of undergraduate student voices. Our study also relies on interviews with Yale students conducted on-site in 2018.\n\nOur report is divided into five major sections supplemented by several brief ones. The first major section deals with Yale’s debates over the admission of black students, beginning in the early 1960s. These debates blended with the debate over the creation of Afro-American Studies in 1968. The admission of substantial numbers of black students was inextricably linked with the pressure to create the Afro-American Studies program. Our focus in this and the other sections is not just on what happened, but why, and how the events recorded bear on Yale today.\n\nThe second section, which flows from the first, deals with the Black Panther crisis and the trial of Bobby Seale in 1969 and 1970. This crisis was precipitated by the actions of the Black Student Alliance at Yale (BSAY), which was founded by the first cohort of black students that Yale recruited. The outcome of the Panther crisis, which played out under the watch of President Kingman Brewster, confirmed the power of BSAY and established Yale’s pattern of resolving grievances framed by campus minority groups by sacrificing the common interests of the Yale community.\n\nThe third section deals with the creation of segregated student orientation programs. These programs began as an attempt to offer academic remediation to under-qualified minority students whom Yale had admitted. While a trace of the remedial goal remained, the orientation programs very quickly shifted focus to building ethnic solidarity among various groups. Yale learned how to shape minority students into grievance-minded activists largely through these orientation programs. The students in turn became fiercely loyal to the racial cohorts in which they had been placed.\n\nThe fourth section addresses Yale’s practice of hiring fellow minorities to “counsel” members of ethnic and racial groups. For no very clear reason, Yale called these staff members “Floating Counselors.” They were renamed “Peer Liaisons” in 2010. Like the ethnically separatist orientation programs, the Floating Counselor program assumed that Yale students are best treated and most appropriately served by being grouped together under an ethnic rubric and assisted by someone of their “own kind.” The spirit of segregation embodied by the Floating Counselor program has occasionally been criticized by students. It also became, for a time, an object of envy by organized gay and lesbian students. We trace these controversies and rivalries among the ethnic groups for larger shares of Floating Counselors. What emerges from the details is a vivid picture of how Yale engineered a system that encourages both ethnic separatism and inter-group rivalry.\n\nThe fifth section examines Yale’s “Cultural Houses,” which are the source of much aggressive separatist propaganda and agitation. The Cultural Houses are not residences. Students who identify with an ethnic minority group do not live in the designated Cultural House, but many use them as a primary place to socialize.\n\nThe remainder of our essay on Yale touches on the university’s hiring practices and its curriculum. Note that we have quoted all sources literally, including ethnic slurs and other vulgarities. We do so in the spirit of preserving the authentic voices of those we quote.\n\nPart I. The Rise of Black Admissions and Afro American Studies, 1960-1969\n\nToo Great a Risk\n\nIn the spring of 1960, a black American student applied to Yale sporting straight As on his transcript “since the seventh grade.” Benjamin Williams—a pseudonym—was a varsity quarterback, first in his class of 500, the first African American to be elected president of his school’s student council, and the son of an “illiterate father and a mother who worked at a laundry.”27\n\nBenjamin’s successes show that humble origins had not crushed his spirit nor his ethic. Such was his community’s faith in him that it offered to raise $500 per year towards his expenses.28 Like many successful black students who came from meaner streets, Williams symbolized his community’s highest hopes and aspirations.\n\nBut Williams’s SAT scores disqualified him for admission under Yale’s traditional criteria. His math and verbal SAT score of 488 was well below the average of Yale’s incoming freshmen, and although he exemplified traits that Yale admissions officers desired such as “character” and “leadership,” the school decided that Williams was “too great a risk to warrant acceptance.” Yale’s rejection of Williams aligned with the thinking of its Dean of Admissions, Arthur Howe Jr., who had been asked earlier that year whether Yale would consider increasing its acceptance rate of black students by adopting a more lenient admissions standard. Howe refused to change Yale’s “admission policy with respect to race” and maintained that Yale would “continue to expect [black students] to meet the same standards required of other applicants.”29\n\nHowe’s position was consistent with the integrationist ethic of the postwar civil rights movement, and was reinforced by Yale’s Governing Board of the Committee on Admissions. On October 26, 1964 that Board announced that it had “no interest in suddenly opening the gates solely to increase the number of Negro and foreign students, unless they were qualified according to the same criteria used to judge all other candidates.”30 Jerome Karabel in his magisterial book, The Chosen: The Hidden History of Admission and Exclusion at Harvard, Yale, and Princeton (2005), tracks other Yale authorities who were determined to hold the line against a more relaxed admissions policy:\n\nJust ten days earlier [than the Board’s announcement] the Committee on Admissions had itself decided against enrolling “Negro and other underprivileged candidates” by lowering admissions standards, with George May, the dean of Yale College, expressing “strong opposition” to using a double standard for admission.31\n\nYale had indeed admitted academically qualified black students for many years. Yale’s first black graduate, Courtlandt Van Rensselaer Creed, was awarded his degree from Yale’s School of Medicine in 1857.32 The number of blacks who matriculated was low, but some were outstanding:\n\nIn 1870, Edward Alexander Bouchet became the first black person to enroll in Yale College. Also the son of a Yale employee, Bouchet was the valedictorian of the Hopkins School in New Haven. He was the first African American in the country elected to Phi Beta Kappa and ranked sixth in the Yale Class of 1874. When he received his doctorate in physics in 1876, he became the first African American to earn a Ph.D. from an American university.33\n\nYale did not by policy discriminate in admissions on the basis of race, though plainly this did not eliminate all the obstacles that American blacks or blacks from abroad faced if they sought to enroll at Yale.\n\nThe various declarations made by Yale officials in the five-year period from 1960 through 1964 against lowering admissions standards to increase the number of black students are evidence that the topic was on the table. The end of this period, however, coincided with important changes in leadership at Yale. Kingman Brewster succeeded Alfred Whitney Griswold as Yale’s new president in October 1963. Brewster presented himself as a strong supporter of merit-based admissions. He faced opposition from some in the Yale community who\n\nYale’s Presidents, 1950-2019\n\nAlfred Whitney Griswold 1950-1963\n\nKingman Brewster, Jr. 1963-1977\n\nHana Holborn Gray 1977-1978\n\nAngelo Bartlett Giamatti 1978-1986\n\nBenno C. Schmidt, Jr. 1986-1992\n\nHoward R. Lamar 1992-1993\n\nRichard C. Levin 1993-2013\n\nPeter Salovey 2013-Present\n\nwere concerned over the loss of an “Old Yale” tradition of cultivating gentlemen of high character, who might not have been primarily focused on academic achievement.34 “This near-sacred mission is hanging somewhat in the balance,” wrote one prominent alumnus. Brewster did his best to appease both the meritocrats and the old schoolers. He insisted that “trained intelligence will assume an even greater importance in the struggle for leadership,” but he told another audience that Yale could serve both those of “highest intellectual capacity” and those of “moral capacity.”35 Fence-sitting would become one of Brewster’s specialties. Few could ever predict where he would come out on a controversial issue, though he reliably told people what they wanted to hear.\n\nKarabel quotes Brewster’s response to a correspondent, Leon Himmelfarb, who asked him if “Yale has definite quotas in operation against Jews, Negroes and other minority groups.” Brewster denied that Yale had such quotas, asserting “without qualification that Yale has no quotas for any minority or majority group,” and adding that to his knowledge, “Yale has at no time in its history had such restrictions.”36\n\nBrewster and Dean of Admissions Howe did not get along. Several months after Brewster’s appointment, Howe took a leave of absence and then resigned. Yale appointed a 68 year-old alumnus, Alton Rufus Hyatt, as acting dean, leaving the door open for Brewster to recruit someone of his own choosing. He settled on R. Inslee (“Inky”) Clark, who won Brewster’s favor by disdaining “the well-rounded, pleasant, jovial, athlete type” in favor of “the abrasive kid,” “the scientist,” “the egghead,” and “the oddball.” Clark, in other words, was ready to shake up and perhaps shake off “Old Yale.” Nonetheless, some of the proponents of the new meritocratic approach, including Sterling Professor of History C. Van Woodward and Chaplain at Yale University William Sloan Coffin, Jr., expressed reservations that Clark might be too much on the side of the old approach. The appetite for change was in the air.37\n\nClark assumed the deanship in July 1965, notably after the various official pronouncements about not “lowering standards” to admit more black students. Clark himself had been silent on the issue, but his views quickly solidified. Race riots had torn through several American cities in the summer of 1964. Malcolm X was assassinated in January 1965. President Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act on August 6 of the same year, and the five-day Watts Riot ensued in less than a week. Brewster was ahead of the curve, declaring in June 1964 that the “effort to cure racial injustice” would require “institutional symbols of white privilege to let it be known that they share this cause.”38 Presumably Yale was one such symbol of “white privilege.”\n\nIn these circumstances, Clark decided that a new definition of “merit” was in order. In Karabel’s account:\n\nThe Admissions Office acknowledged that a candidate’s academic profile was profoundly influenced by the opportunities that had been available to him. By 1965-1966, the first year of the Clark era, the Admissions Committee made it standard procedure—at least for African Americans—to “seriously consider the possibility that SAT scores might reflect cultural deprivation rather than lack of intelligence.”\n\nCoupled with this new recognition of the social context was a willingness to undertake “risks” that had been unacceptable a few years earlier. 39\n\nClark had inherited a few preliminary efforts in this direction. Dean Howe had felt sufficient pressure in 1961 to increase black enrollment that he hired Charles McCarthy (Class of 1960) to forge relationships with several inner-city high schools “known to enroll. . . academically talented black students.” This step did not pass unnoticed. Yale’s inner-city initiative had caught the attention of other Ivy League schools. According to Karabel, at a 1962 meeting of Ivy League officers, figures from the other schools asked Yale officials to share their contacts. These requests led to a joint initiative called the Cooperative Program for Educational Opportunity. All eight Ivy League schools and the Seven Sisters participated. But the first year of McCarthy’s recruitment program yielded only a small pool of black freshmen for Yale. Only six matriculated at the university in 1962.40\n\nIn principle, Yale sought to uphold academic standards while admitting black students who lacked the scholastic qualifications and perhaps also the intellectual merit to thrive in the university. This simply meant that black applicants were held to lower standards than other applicants, but the difference was covered over with rhetorical obfuscation. The tension between the elitist goal of maintaining high standards and the egalitarian goal of attempting to engineer racial equality played out in the form of high-minded declarations by the Admission Policy Advisory Board which saw no reason to exclude blacks from admission for failing to meet “the usual quantitative measures of academic achievement.”41 The failure was put down exclusively to these students’ “inferior preparation,”42 which was conceived as something that Yale could remedy once the students were enrolled.\n\nBenjamin Williams had applied five years too soon.\n\nBlack Power: The Emergence of Neo-Segregation at Yale\n\nNot long after Yale implemented its new admissions standard, black students who had benefited from Inky Clark’s policy change began to gather among themselves. On November 8, 1964, Yale’s black students organized the Yale Discussion Group, an exclusively black social club. By 1967, that organization had evolved into the Black Student Alliance at Yale (BSAY).43\n\nFounder Dick Tolbert ’66 told Yale Daily News writer Michael Rosenhouse in a 1967 interview that the idea emerged in the weeks after Yale hosted “Soul Week,” an event comprised of discussion sessions and a segregated dance. Tolbert said that Yale’s blacks planned “soul week” apprehensively for fear that it might “look like self-imposed segregation.” But the students, he added, enjoyed their newfound sense of solidarity. “It turned out,” said Tolbert, that “[black] people simply enjoyed being around other blacks.”44\n\nShortly after Soul Week, Tolbert recruited black students to form a club in which “blacks could get together and exchange ideas.” In the past, he said, black students at Yale “would never walk across campus with each other” lest they offend their white peers. But in the late 1950s, black activists such as “James Baldwin and Malcolm X” broke with race-blind philosophy and extolled the virtues of racial pride. “Black is good,” they said, and for Yale’s black students this fostered “pride in [their] blackness” and the will to form intra-racial friendships without inhibition.48\n\nMalcolm X’s black separatist ideology influenced BSAY’s formation. Like Malcolm X, Tolbert rejected the idea of an American “melting pot” that encouraged assimilation by turning minorities into “hardcore white Anglo-Saxon Protestants.” Blacks, he said, “don’t want a melting pot,” but rather a salad bowl. Tolbert wanted ethnic identity and pride similar to that enjoyed by the “Jewish, Irish, Italian and Polish sections of town.” The Black Student Alliance, he said, bestowed a sense of “rootedness” on its members that other ethnic groups took for granted. The BSAY, he continued, had the additional benefit of fulfilling white demands that blacks help themselves, but he resented that whites hypocritically now opposed separatism. “Now that we [separated], they’re against it,” he told the Yale Daily News.49\n\nTolbert declared “black power” the sole means by which blacks would improve their material and spiritual condition. Black power meant “proportional representation,” the freedom to “run [our] own retail shops,” and equal access to housing, although “new militants would much sooner move in with their fellow Negroes than whites.” Rosenhouse concluded the interview by extending an olive branch of support to the blacks’ new militancy, Tolbert explained blacks’ identitarian longings in a softer tone:\n\n“You know,” he said, “When we say ‘whites get out,’ we don’t mean we can’t work with you; we’re saying you’re blocking our path when we want to help blacks develop themselves and their pride.50\n\nNo sooner had Yale sought to achieve racial integration via vigorous efforts to recruit black students than the students themselves began to resist integration. In fact, black resistance towards and resentment of integration had a long history before Yale committed itself to Clark’s new admissions policy. Black separatism and exclusivity had roots in the post-Civil War South and began to flourish in the form of mass movements beginning in the 1920s. This history of black separatism was not hidden or obscure, but it went entirely unnoticed and unremarked by the Ivy League advocates for increased black admissions. They saw themselves as answering the social injustices of black poverty, white racism, and inner city unrest by ushering in a new age of racial integration. The students they recruited to enact this vision of a new social order, however, very quickly took up a strand of black identitarian thought and group allegiance that ran directly against the integrationist ideals.\n\nBlack Student Special Recruitment Begins\n\nAt the beginning of the fall 1968–1969 academic year, a mob of \"militant blacks marched directly” to President Kingman Brewster Jr.’s house and demanded that “Yale increase the number of blacks to be admitted that year.” Brewster met the protesters face to face and assured them that “their cause was his cause”; he agreed to another round of negotiations.51\n\nOn February 5, 1969, the Yale Daily News reported that representatives from the Black Student Alliance at Yale met with school officials to propose that 12 percent of the next freshmen be black.52 They also proposed a budget to pay for BSAY members to fan out across the country to recruit minority students. President Brewster allocated $3,000 for the trips.53 Inky Clark favored the 12 percent quota, but Brewster rejected it.54\n\nIn an open letter to Yale students, Brewster endorsed the university's “special efforts” to recruit black students but declined to “promise . . . achieving any target of admitting students who, in the eyes of the Admissions Committee, would not be likely to meet Yale's academic requirements.”55 The renewed efforts to recruit inner-city blacks yielded 130 applicants.56 BSAY said success would depend on how many black students actually matriculated.57 It was holding out for a quota.\n\nBSAY also demanded the right to send application forms to black students of its own choosing, regardless of Yale’s standards and despite that their “candidates had not themselves requested an application.”58 BSAY’s idea, it seems, was to create a pool of black students whom BSAY could encourage, control, and lobby for. The administration vetoed this part of BSAY’s proposal also. As a compromise, President Brewster offered to extend the normal New Year’s application deadline into late February, thereby averting what Karabel called “the threat of disruption.” Karabel characterized BSAY's actions as “disruptive,” which is a mild way to describe BSAY’s tactics, which included posting a mob outside a college president’s home. BSAY’s tactics worked. In the fall of 1969, 120 black men and 35 women were offered admission to the college. Ninety-six accepted admission. That was eight percent of the freshman class, up from two percent in 1965.59\n\nThe Urge to Do Something\n\nThe racial turmoil of the late 1960s penetrated Yale’s campus and contributed to the college’s pliability in the face of BSAY’s demands. Between BSAY’s 1968 meeting with Dean Clark and President Brewster’s $3,000 recruiting grant, on April 4, 1968, James Earl Ray Jr. assassinated Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Riots ensued in the District of Columbia, Chicago, Baltimore, Kansas City, Detroit, New York, Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Trenton, Wilmington, and Louisville.\n\nBy the time public order was restored, several major colleges and universities publicly pledged to enroll more black students. These pledges trailed the smoke of burning cities. Colleges imagined that they could calm racial animosity and cure the wrathful indignation of a whole generation by admitting more underqualified black students. The pledges themselves were typically framed, as a New York Times editorial put it, “to aid the education of Negroes in the slain civil rights leader’s memory.”60\n\nStanford pledged $1 million to “double the enrollment of Negro students”; Harvard announced a $50,000 initiative to train black college graduates for “teaching and administration”; New York University pledged to raise Negro enrollment to 2,800—1,000 more than their then-current black enrollment—and to appropriate $1 million in scholarships for poor black students. The New York Times article, however, warned against imposing “dangerous” ethnic quotas, which would be “a mixed blessing in the battle for true equality.”61\n\nAlthough Yale University rejected BSAY’s demand for a twelve percent ethnic quota, between 1965 and 1969 admissions officials increased blacks’ portion of its freshmen class from two to eight percent.62 To achieve this, Inky Clark admitted “high-risk” black students.\n\nThe New York Times prediction that ethnic quotas, or at the least, racial preferences would stymie racial equality came true. Yale’s “reformed” admission standards led to poor academic performance among many of the students admitted under these standards, and poor performance led to high drop out rates.63 Equality proved elusive.\n\nAccording to Karabel, “of the blacks who entered Yale in 1966, 35 percent did not return after their freshman year; though how many left in subsequent years is unknown.”64 Karabel argues that, if Brewster and Clark aimed at the creation of black leadership, they had been successful. But a 35-percent attrition rate testified that Yale had failed to enroll students who could thrive in Yale’s rigorous liberal arts curriculum. This prompted racial preference advocates to revise their goals. Getting more black students enrolled at Yale meant little if many of those students proved incapable of the academic performance needed to succeed.\n\nOne possible answer was to lower the standards of performance needed to graduate for those students who were most “at risk.” To admit openly that standards would have to sink, however, would be to insult the student beneficiaries of the program; further, it would concede the criticism that the university had rushed into racial preferences without due attention to the likely consequences. What the proponents needed were ways to lower the standards that could be presented as something else. Their answer was to devise new academic tracks designed to accommodate students who found the existing tracks too difficult.\n\nThe pretense could be maintained that the new “studies” programs were as rigorous as the traditional programs, though they were plainly designed as options for students who could not handle the demands of traditional academic subjects. This view as was expressed by faculty members at several colleges where black studies took hold. According to The New York Times, those rushing to charter black studies programs ignored professors who feared that the track would be an “easy option for students more interested in diplomas than erudition.”65\n\nOrganizing Discontent\n\nThe Black Student Alliance at Yale soon demanded control of Yale’s initiatives to recruit black students. In February 1968, BSAY representatives met with Yale administrators to express their “dismay at the inefficiency of Yale’s efforts to recruit African Americans.”66 BSAY leaders alleged that, even under Yale’s reformed admissions criteria, the “process isn’t turning up or isn’t admitting qualified black students.”67 The next month, BSAY boycotted Yale’s classes in a demonstration that reportedly included “ninety percent of Yale’s Negro undergraduates.”68 The students expressed their “alienation from Yale and anger at the treatment routinely meted out to black people in” New Haven. The boycott was BSAY’s first public articulation of grievances against Yale and its alleged complicity in the plight of the black poor. In a New York Times article, \"Negro Group Boycotts Yale Classes,\" Yale officials declined to comment on the boycott but assured readers that it had engaged in negotiations with BSAY. The students, a spokesman said, were “intelligent, articulate and reasonable.”69\n\nYale quelled BSAY’s frustration by approving an initiative under which Yale’s black students visited “approximately 1,200 schools in 1968,” a venture that led to 43 new enrollees that fall.70 The appointment of recent Yale graduate and BSAY member Paul B. Jones (’68) as assistant to the dean of undergraduate affairs that June was an additional attempt to pacify BSAY and illustrated the Ivy League trend of quelling identitarian anger by creating jobs for black alumni.71 Jones intimated that his race was “a factor” in Yale’s decision to hire him. But his predecessor, John A. Wilkinson, denied that Jones’ race accorded special significance to his selection. “That [Jones] is black,” said Wilkinson, “is just gratuitous.”72 The 21-year-old earned the job because he was “a natural.”73\n\nThe claims about the number of schools visited and Jones’s qualifications sound inflated, but Yale was plainly attempting to placate its newly organized and grievance minded minority students.\n\nTrouble emerged elsewhere on campus. In December 1968, six of the seven black students enrolled in Yale’s Drama School attempted to cancel a production of Sam Shepard’s play Operation Sidewinder.74 The protesters refused to comment directly to The New York Times’ Sam Zolotow. Dr. John Clark, a Yale Medical School fellow, spoke on their behalf.75 According to Clark, the students felt that Operation Sidewinder portrayed its black militant characters as stereotypes. He claimed that Shepard depicted the militants as feckless and dependent on whites. The protesters also complained that Yale’s Drama School neglected the “needs of black students”; that its slate of shows featured no black playwrights or directors; that blacks were not represented on the script selection committee; and that the school had no black instructors.76\n\nDrama School Dean Robert Brustein reached out to the New York Times to break the news that Shepard had canceled the play “against the will and advice of the school administration.” The Drama School’s committee selected the play without anticipating controversy, and Shepard was disturbed by the air of contention that surrounded the production. Shepard added that he resented the politicization of his work, which was caused by “bitterness between the black students and faculty.”77 The cancellation of the Operation Sidewinder is one of the first cases of censorship resulting from black student protest at an Ivy League school.\n\nThe controversy over Shepard’s play reflected the growing struggle between black students and the university over its “lily-white” curriculum.78\n\nThe Origins of Black Studies at Yale\n\nIn December 1968, the Yale Daily News reported that the school had approved a “new major in African American Studies” centered on the “experiences, conditions and origins of black Americans.”79\n\nThe creation of this major came near the beginning of a crush of such programs around the country. San Francisco State University is generally—but wrongly—credited as the first to create a black studies program, in 1968. San Francisco State had, in fact, set up a non-accredited program that year, but the Yale College Faculty Committee in December 1968 unanimously approved the creation of the “Afro-American Studies Major,” thus making Yale the first the college in the United States to accredit such a major.80 Dozens soon followed. Bowdoin College, as recounted in NAS’s study What Does Bowdoin Teach?, created such a program in 1969. The idea spread quickly. Between 1969 and 1973, around 600 such programs and departments were created at American colleges and universities.81 Yale was an early adopter, but not an originator of the idea.\n\nIn November 1967 BSAY began campaigning for an Afro-American Studies major as part of its meetings with the Yale administration on how to recruit more black students.82 In February 1968, President Brewster responded by establishing the African American Study Group to draft “a proposal for a divisional major in Afro-American studies.”83 Provost Charles H. Taylor, three faculty members, and four black students—Donald Ogilvie ’68, Armistead Robinson ’68, Craig Foster ’69, and Ray Nunn ’69—were appointed.84 Appointing students to a committee to consider a major curricular innovation appears to have been unprecedented in Yale’s history.85\n\nThe committee was chaired by political scientist Robert Dahl, who specialized in the theory of democratic pluralism. His academic writing emphasized the concept of “power” (as opposed to lawful authority) and the fragmentation of power in the United States among competing interest groups. His most noted work was a study of political power in New Haven, Who Governs? Democracy and Power in an American City (1961). Brewster’s appointment of Dahl to lead the committee was a plain signal of Brewster’s intent to grant BSAY’s demand for an Afro-American Studies Program. Presumably Brewster did not create the program outright because of opposition among many in the Yale faculty and alumni who warned that the program would dilute Yale’s academic standards. Brewster sought the cover of a committee that included several high-profile faculty members, albeit faculty members who could be relied on to deliver the “right answer.”\n\nDahl would serve this role again a few years later when Brewster sought to win support for Yale becoming co-ed. Yale admitted women in fall 1969, but in small numbers. In spring 1970, students and alumni staged a protest to demand that Yale drastically increase the number of women admitted. Brewster conceded in principle but then appointed a committee headed by Dahl, “the Study Group on Yale College,” which was charged with re-imagining “every aspect of Yale College.”86 This second Dahl committee, however, became a target for criticism by blacks, who ironically ignored the 1968 Dahl committee’s focus on black grievance:\n\nDirector of African American Studies Roy S. Bryce-Laporte wrote to the president [Brewster] that he was shocked by the “invisibility of Blacks …whether as members of the Committee or as a crucial component for consideration.” For Bryce-Laporte, this perceived slight was especially galling, given that Brewster had directed the Study Group to focus on the plight of female students and had appointed his “Director of Coeducation” to Dahl’s committee. Brewster uncharacteristically exposed himself to criticism in the arena of racial politics by explicitly focusing on the needs of women over other minorities. That he did so spoke to importance of the Study Group as a vehicle for resolving the issue of Yale’s gender ratio.87\n\nOther faculty members on the African American Study Group were Howard Lamar, William Kessen, and Charles H. Taylor. Lamar was a professor of American history who specialized in the history of the American frontier, Westward expansion and Native Americans. His books, including Dakota Territory and The Far Southwest, were notable for their emphasis on territorial politics. Years later he would serve as acting president of Yale (1992-1993).\n\nKessen, a professor of psychology, was a child psychologist who researched the behavior of infants before they could speak. He is noted for his relativistic view of child care, and his assertions that modern child-care in America emerged from the bourgeois division between work and family.\n\nTaylor, Yale’s provost, was a scholar who specialized in the poetry of Percy Bysshe Shelley and had been briefly a professor of English, where he taught a single course on Shakespeare before becoming a full-time administrator at Yale in 1963. At “Black Studies in the University,” a symposium held at Yale, May 11-12, 1968, and sponsored by the Ford Foundation, Taylor declared:\n\nOur society, our education, suffer from white racism. This racism is both conscious and unconscious—much of it unconscious, but nevertheless real…What we are faced with then in our black students’ protest is not simply, in some respects not even chiefly, their proper demand to know more about themselves, about their heritage and their tradition, but rather their consciousness of how important it is for American society, for us, the white majority, to know a lot more about them. We need this knowledge to attack not only conscious prejudice, which is easy to identify, but to overcome unconscious discrimination, that simple lack of awareness, the ignorance from which we all suffer in white America. 88\n\nIn short, the committee chaired by Dahl comprised four black activist students, three faculty who appeared ideologically predisposed to favor the activists’ demands, and the provost, who had gone on record at the May symposium, fulsomely supporting the creation of a black studies program. The committee seemed highly unlikely to provide a balanced consideration of the pros and cons of the issue. For that matter, Dahl had also spoken at the May symposium, and it could have surprised no one when the committee issued its recommendations in December 1968 that Yale establish a black studies program.89 Brewster’s appointment of the committee was plainly intended to give him political cover with faculty members and alumni who opposed the new order.\n\nSurprised or not, Yale alumni were not universally pleased. A new organization, Lux et Veritas, Incorporated (LEVI) formed in May 1969, objecting to Brewster’s wide-ranging concessions to black activists and calling for reform.\n\nThe Amplification of Racial Discontent, 1969\n\nThe seemingly settled debate over the creation of a black studies program at Yale did not mollify BSAY or other activists who were engaged with the cause of black grievance. Student protests against the Vietnam War and in favor of admitting more women students raged in 1969. The Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) appears to have first become active at Yale that year, and was initially focused only on protesting the Vietnam War. But they were not the only angry Yale students.\n\nOn May 19, 1969 Bobby Seale, the Chairman of the National Black Panther Party (NBPP), a violent revolutionary black identitarian organization,90 addressed the Yale student body in an event sponsored by the Black Arts Theatre of New Haven and the Black Arts Students at Yale. Before an audience of 700, Seale espoused the Panthers’ ten-point program for black liberation. Panthers did not read “textbooks about ‘Yankee Doodle Socialism,’” he said; they “fight capitalism with socialism, racism with solidarity.” 91\n\nThe speech contained separate messages for whites and blacks. Seale accused Yale's white students of being “a bunch of jackass racists,” and bid black audience members to “do something niggers, if you only spit: stop jiving yourselves, brothers.”92 His remarks concluded with an assertion that appeared to refer to events taking place a few miles away at the Panthers’ New Haven headquarters. He said, “We don’t care what color he is. If we catch him brutalizing any kind of people, we will kill him.”93\n\nAs it happened, on May 18, the day before Seale’s speech, Black Panthers in New Haven kidnapped one of their own, Alex Rackley, and staged a “trial” in the basement of their New Haven headquarters. Over the next two days, they tortured and ultimately killed Rackley, and on May 21 dumped his body in the Coginchaug River near Middletown.\n\nPolice quickly identified eight New Haven Black Panthers as suspects and arrested them on May 23. Some other suspects escaped to other cities or Canada, and a nationwide manhunt ensued. Eventually Seale was implicated, arrested, and extradited from Chicago. But that was months later.\n\nIn the meantime, Yale was having other troubles. During the week of June 9, 1969, black and Hispanic students distributed flyers asking “Why has Yale not gone up in smoke? See the A and A [Art and Architecture] building.”94\n\nYale did not have to wait long for the smoke. On June 14, campus officials awoke to a fire on the top two floors (the fourth and fifth) of the School of Art and Architecture, which gutted the facility and caused an estimated $500,000 in damage. Fire Chief Michael J Sweeney thought the cause was arson.95 No one was arrested and Yale proceeded to bury the incident.\n\nThe flyers and the fire were the culmination of a months-long campaign by black students in which they attempted to hijack admissions to the City Planning program. Declaring themselves an “experiment in participatory democracy,” the protesting students circumvented the school’s official admissions process by sending out letters of admission to twelve minority students whom the school itself had declined to admit. They received aid from two faculty members, the chairman of City Planning, Christopher Tunnard, and Assistant Dean Louis S. DeLuca. When the dean of the School of Art and Architecture strongly objected, President Brewster intervened and fired Tunnard and DeLuca.96\n\nBrewster wrote to all of the students who had been officially admitted—there were eight—telling them not to come. His stated reason was that the department “might not continue in its present form.” He presumably didn’t know of the coming fire. Brewster’s actions, far from mollifying the students, intensified their fury. Disgruntled Art and Architecture faculty members issued a statement protesting Brewster’s intervention and demanding that the school become “more relevant to the social concerns of the students.” The flyers asking, “Why has Yale not gone up in smoke?” and the fire that ripped through the top two floors of the Arts and Architecture building followed.97\n\nFive Yale students were identified as having distributed the flyers. None of them were Arts and Architecture students. “One member of the group declared that their intentions were the opposite of inciting violence,” and explained that the fire was “an extremely unfortunate coincidence.”98\n\nJuice\n\nIn October, Yale dining hall manager John Lewis fired waitress Colia Williams after she threw a glass of juice in bursary captain John Meyers’ face. She said Meyers had jostled her and otherwise harassed her. Two of her co-workers, however, said Williams was a “crummy worker.” According to the Yale Daily News, “the principal issue in her case is apparently whether she was a ‘slow’ or uncooperative worker.”99\n\nThe incident soon became a cause célèbre for students. The Yale Students for a Democratic Society printed a leaflet saying “she was fighting against ‘speed-up’ and racism in the Yale dining halls.”100 The SDS staged a protest in the basement of Wright Hall, refusing to leave until Ms. Williams was re-hired. President Brewster happened to be on vacation in the Caribbean at the moment, and it was left to Provost Taylor and Brewster’s aide Sam Chauncey to figure out how to handle the forty-five students occupying the basement. Taking a different track than Brewster might have, they suspended the students, who still refused to leave. The occupation finally dispersed after Yale agreed to rehire Williams.101\n\nThe dining hall occupation, though framed as an anti-racism protest, seemed to draw little if any attention from Yale’s black activists. That may have been because the Black Panther controversy was heating up. Brewster himself was much more concerned with the delicate balances among Yale’s radicalized black students, their white allies, the Panthers, and the black community in New Haven. In the meantime, the efforts to organize the new Afro-American Studies Major proceeded.\n\nBlack Studies at Yale: Anticipations\n\nPrior to President Brewster’s February 1968 appointment of the African American Study Group, the Yale administration had shown no interest in creating an African American Studies major. The idea itself was novel in American higher education as a whole when BSAY students enunciated it as one of their goals in 1967. “The major,” said Craig Foster, one of the four BSAY students Brewster appointed to the African American Study Group, “mostly came from us.” He said that “most of the groundwork and drafting is our work.”102 BSAY “wouldn’t be satisfied if we didn’t think it was good.”103 The program that emerged from those discussions would be “interdisciplinary,” i.e., it would “intersect” with already established disciplines. A consortium of twenty-one courses would be taught throughout the university.104 , 105\n\nBSAY argued that the major would make Yale’s curriculum more “relevant” to black students.106 “Relevance” was a key word in the political vocabulary of campus radicals at the time. It was also used, for example, by the students who attempted to hijack the admissions to the Urban Planning program before someone set fire to the Arts and Architecture building. “Relevance” was a vague concept, but it was symbolic of a broader movement away from the traditional understanding of liberal arts as the font of essential wisdom toward a more relativistic view. In the highly politicized atmosphere of the 1960s, of what use, or “relevance,” was the literature of the Greeks or the Renaissance if the civilization they helped create could result in a legacy of such injustice? Relevance pointed to a shift in priorities; it meant emphasizing contemporary social issues and diminishing academic attention to history, philosophy, and social theory except when these fields were directly concerned with race, poverty, or injustice.107\n\nWhen Brewster accepted the recommendation of the African American Study Group to create the new major, he appointed anthropology professor Sidney W. Mintz to oversee the next steps, which included drawing in professors from various academic departments.108\n\nProvost Charles Taylor said that BSAY’s case for African American Studies was “especially persuasive” on account of their argument that “it is educationally essential for all Yale students to … enlarge their understanding of the black experience.” BSAY leaders insisted on the intellectual integrity of African American Studies and recommended that students couple the major with a “discipline such as history or economics.”109 In later years, student activists added East Asian, Latino, and South Asian-Americans to the list of American racial groups in need of their own stand-alone academic departments or programs.\n\nProfessor Dahl, who led the committee that launched the proposal, insisted that the new major wasn’t designed exclusively for black students. He hoped that white students would also pursue the major, and said he would be “terribly disappointed if they didn’t.” Still, Nathaniel Hare, the special coordinator of the San Francisco State University's black studies program, expressed his doubts to the Yale Daily News when a reporter asked him about the merits of the new curriculum. In his experience students had expected a “mere blackening up of white courses.” Any programs, he said, structurally built to rehabilitate students by emphasizing identitarianism were “doomed inevitably to failure.” 110\n\nThe debate over African American Studies quickly gave birth to the conceit that any who opposed the novel field were reactionaries who deserved to be ignored. Afro-American Studies was treated by its proponents as beyond reproach. Craig Foster gave voice to this defense. When a Yale Daily News reporter asked him if the major was explicitly for black students, he took offense. “Is Latin American Studies for Latin Americans [when] Yale is 98 percent white?” Without question, he declared, more whites than blacks would register for the program. Committee member William Kessen stated that African American studies would foster “personal contact with black culture,” the establishment of which offered our “only hope of solving racial problems.” White students too would benefit from the “lifting the veil of supreme naiveté with which they greeted most race problems.”111\n\nBlack students had their own reasons for supporting the program. BSAY founder Armstead Robinson (’69) said many of Yale’s black students are “disillusioned with courses here.”112 A “black educator” quoted by the Yale Daily News explained that black students:\n\nRead white literature, study white families, analyze white music, survey white civilizations, examine white cultures, probe white psychology. In a word, the college curriculum is white-culture based. 113\n\nAustin Clarke, a Barbadian novelist who was then a visiting professor at Yale, denied that “white culture is the only thing worth studying or imitating.”114 He added that a time would come when “everything black will be powerful and therefore beautiful.”115 Yale jumped at the chance to fulfill that wish and scheduled the program to start in the fall semester of 1969.116\n\nDahl predicted that “a great many [colleges] will imitate or be influenced by [the program].” Yale history Professor Robert Winks imagined that Yale would deemphasize its traditional curriculum in favor of more “culturally-based courses in the future.” He also expressed his wish for Yale to replace “documented facts” with the “oral traditions of black Americans.”117\n\nWilliam Borders, the author of the first New York Times reports about “diversity” at Wesleyan University, broke the news of Yale’s new major on December 13, 1968. Borders interviewed Dahl, who responded to critics’ suspicion of the program’s intellectual rigor and ideological basis by insisting that the fledgling major was “educationally sound, and that’s all that counts.”118 Addressing concerns that the involvement of activist students in the major’s development compromised its academic legitimacy, he asserted that he was “certainly not embarrassed that what [Yale] came up with is something people want.”119\n\nDahl asserted Yale’s commitment to augmenting the major with additional courses and intent to hire more experts in the field. As soon as Yale found someone qualified to teach “the sociology of the slums, the politics of poverty and a comparative history of slavery,” Dahl said, he would be hired.120\n\nAmong the other colleges and universities that weighed the addition of a Black Studies major in 1969 were Dartmouth, Williams, Bowdoin, and Cornell, each of which issued a report detailing black students’ grievances and demands. In June of 1968, Harvard University offered its first two-semester course in the subject, “The Afro-American Experience,” and pledged to explore the addition of an Afro-American Studies concentration. Harvard’s course began with the “African background and the Negro experience in American History through 1945.” A lecture series hosted by the John F. Kennedy School of Government supplemented students’ in-class instruction with “a series of films and television tapes on the subject.”121\n\nIn a June article, The New York Times noted the dubious quality of black studies programs at less reputable schools, but added that the idea had gained traction nevertheless. Though the Times conceded that black studies did not preclude “straight non-propagandistic, scholarly” instruction, black students often downplayed the scholarship and emphasized its “therapeutic” benefits instead.122\n\nYale Daily News writer James Sargent Jr., ’71, quoted historian Roger Butterfield saying blacks resented traditional history’s ignorance of “[the black man’s] presence” by “treating him as an appendage to American history rather than an integral part of it.”123 The New York Times argued that black studies risked having a curriculum that emphasized blacks’ “heroic past,” but that “[omitted] less glorious chapters.”124\n\nThe rise of Black Studies was not greeted with enthusiasm by all black leaders. At a panel in January 1969, Executive Director of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) Roy Wilkins, described the Black Studies movement as a regrettable development in black politics. “We have suffered too many heartaches and shed too many tears and too much blood in fighting the evil of racial segregation to return in 1969 to the lonely and dispiriting confines of its demeaning prison,” he said.125 Wilkins targeted white administrators for his message, whom he charged with creating illegal “Jim Crow schools.”126 Dr. Nathaniel Hare, founder of San Francisco State’s Department of Ethnic Studies, responded to Wilkins by dismissing him as a reactionary who “should be given a scroll and retired … like old race horses and prizefighters.”127\n\nThe diametrically opposed views of Wilkins and Hare on Black Studies capture the underlying divergence between the integrationist and separatist camps within the black community.\n\nA letter to the editor in The New York Times two days after Wilkins’s remarks indicated that integrationists of his mold were losing sway with the black public. The writer, Warner B. Wims, president of the Union Theological Seminary’s Black Caucus, equated Wilkins’s ideological camp with the “plantation system [that] violated the solidarity of African Americans,” and noted that blacks’ “most treacherous opponents have come from their own people.” The letter is an early example of the denunciation of black integrationists as race traitors. Black separatists like Wims denied that “separation and discrimination” were “inherently evil.” This position contradicted the Brown v. Board of Education decision, which held that segregated institutions are pernicious because they deprive blacks of the opportunity to thrive in established institutions. Separate, according to the Supreme Court, is never equal. Chief Justice Earl Warren’s opinion did not address the sentiment of blacks such as Wims who believed that separate could be equal if figures such as Wilkins had “faith in the black man’s abilities.” 128\n\nOther Discontents\n\nBSAY’s activism inspired other ethnic groups. Like black students, Asian-American students formed an ethnic social club to seek preferential treatment in undergraduate admissions. In November 1969, the newly founded Asian-American Students Association criticized Yale for not considering the economic disadvantages of Asian-American high schoolers, and that their secondary education was just as poor as that of lower-class blacks.129 The Asian-American Students Association lobbied the administration successfully. By 1971, Yale announced the matriculation of thirty-one Asian-Americans. Other minority groups saw their numbers rise also. Two dozen Mexican Americans and six Puerto Ricans were accepted to the freshman class of 1971. One year later, the existing student groups were joined by Despierta Boricuas (“Wake Up Puerto Ricans”), a Puerto Rican student group.130\n\nThe records for exactly when Despierta Boricuas got started are unclear, but by 1972 it was demanding that Yale concede to it the right to recruit “mainland Puerto Ricans” (i.e. Puerto Ricans from the continental U.S.) without the administration’s help.131 The group wanted Yale to matriculate Puerto Rican students in numbers proportionate to their share of the national population.\n\nDespierta Boricua’s proposal was born out of the group’s consternation that by the spring of 1972 under a dozen mainland Puerto Ricans were attending Yale.132 It pinned this low figure on bureaucratic obstruction in the admissions office, which included a rule stipulating that Despierta Boricua submit its travel itinerary for student-led recruitment trips five weeks in advance. Moreover, it said, admissions officials rejected Despierta Boricua’s input in molding the shape of Yale’s recruitment strategy. The entire process, Despierta Boricua claimed, was “tailored to the needs of the admissions office.”133\n\nDespierta Boricua had more in mind than reforming Yale’s system of minority recruitment. It also aimed to eliminate Yale’s SAT requirements for admission. Despierta Boricua argued that Puerto Rican enrollment could have surged sooner if the mediocre test scores of many Puerto Rican students hadn’t deterred them from applying to Yale.134 Despite the SAT’s power to predict the collegiate performance of the “average Yale applicant,” Despierta Boricua asserted that when it came to minorities “SATs alone are an unreliable measure of a student’s actual potential.” The SATs were particularly pernicious to Puerto Ricans’ aspirations, it claimed, because many Puerto Ricans are bilingual and attended low-performing school districts disproportionately. Both factors, it concluded, singled Puerto Ricans out for SAT-based discrimination.135\n\nDespierta Boricua offered a fix: it asked Yale to pack its admissions committee with Puerto Rican officers “as readers of folders or, as candidate interviewers.” What it sought ultimately was an “an ongoing comprehensive [recruitment] program as opposed to the current piecemeal program” Yale was subsidizing. Until Yale did things its way, Despierta Boricua would doubt Yale’s “commitment to the mainland Puerto Rican.” For Despierta Boricua, a commitment to the mainland Puerto Rican included: hiring Puerto Rican graduate students to assess the applications of Puerto Rican students; a Puerto Rican admissions dean; a policy mandating the referral of incoming Puerto Rican students to Despierta Boricua; and the elimination of a rule that disqualified students from receiving federal loans if they qualified for work study.136\n\nDespierta Boricua eventually took its complaints to the streets. On April 4, 1972, it picketed the Yale Club of New York to protest Yale University’s “conscious or unconscious racism towards Puerto Ricans.” Yale’s allegiance to its admissions standards betrayed its “indifference” to the plight of poor minorities, the protestors charged.137 Nearly two million Puerto Ricans lived in the United States at the time, and 150,000 Puerto Ricans resided in New Haven alone. And yet, under a dozen continent-born Puerto Rican students were enrolled at Yale. President Brewster, they continued, slighted them personally. In contrast to Brewster’s countenancing several rounds of negotiations with the BSAY, he would not negotiate with Despierta Boricua about admissions.138\n\nDespierta Boricua’s protests paid off. On April 17, 1972 the Yale Daily News reported statistical data for Yale’s Class of 1976. From an applicant pool of 2,313 students, Yale selected 1,350 for admission to the college. The most important news was that the number of Puerto Rican students accepted to Yale had more than doubled.139\n\nIn the 1971 admissions cycle, the article reported, Yale had accepted only thirteen Puerto Rican students.140 In 1972, it increased that number to twenty-eight: twenty-two mainlanders and six islanders. The university supplemented its diversity windfall with an overhaul of its hiring practices. Two months after the Yale Daily News reported the demographics of the class of 1976, Yale announced a new associate provost position. The university filled it with linguistics professor Jacqueline Wei Mintz, who was to focus on female and minority recruitment.141\n\nIn October 1972, Yale’s minority groups banded together to propose changes to Yale University’s minority recruitment apparatus, which Yale Daily News reporter Wendy Jones called “haphazard and unstructured.” The students, Jones reported, wanted Yale to use its bureaucratic capacities to impose a sanctioned minority recruitment program. Yale University assented to the changes, which according to Dean of Admissions Worth David would boost minority enrollment by increasing the pool of minority applicants. David added that the new initiative would prioritize quantity over quality. The process, he promised, would not be “a selective one.” In other words, Yale University’s desire to placate minority students led it to double down on “taking risks” with students who might not succeed at Yale.142\n\nRacial integration at Yale University was underway, but Yale discovered that treating individuals differently depending on their presumed racial identity had unexpected costs. Racial tensions on campus did not disappear. Rather they worsened.\n\nThis became clear in the next decade when the academic “mismatch” between white and minority students prompted minority organizations to demand segregated pre-college programs. The initial idea was that these programs would offset deficiencies in minority students’ academic preparation. Despierta Boricuas was Yale’s first minority group to demand a special program.143\n\nPart II. The Black Panther Crisis\n\nWhile the Yale community was struggling with issues of minority student recruitment and the creation of a black studies program, and dealing with the rise of student groups such as the SDS and other radicals opposed to the Vietnam War, a new crisis emerged. The torture and murder of Alex Rackley in May 1969 drew immediate national attention. The State of California granted Bobby Seale’s extradition to Connecticut, January 1, 1970.144 Seale’s arrest and trial ensured that Yale’s black community would play a major part in the events to follow.\n\nThe Black Panthers murdered Rackley because they suspected he was an FBI informant. Although the FBI did stage a successful espionage operation against the Panthers, no evidence has emerged that Rackley was part of it. Panther paranoia fueled by methamphetamines and marijuana sealed Rackley’s fate.145\n\nA few of the gruesome details are needed to give the story its proper weight in Yale’s racial politics.\n\nOn May 18, 1969, Rackley was taken against his will to the Panthers’ New Haven headquarters, which doubled as the home of Panther Warren Kimbro. The “trial” took place in the basement. After being interrogated, Rackley was tied to the bed of Kimbro's seven-year-old daughter to “lay [sic] in his own urine and feces.”146\n\nOver the cour"
