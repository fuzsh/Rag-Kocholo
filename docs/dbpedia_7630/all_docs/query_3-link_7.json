        "text": "Early European influences\n\nThe Spanish and Portuguese brought their Roman Catholic religious music to the colonies. They built modest churches in the mission towns and sumptuous cathedrals in the main urban centres, and they performed and taught the official music of the Roman Catholic rites. Gregorian chant and Spanish sacred polyphony entered the repertory early on. Popular religious music also began to be cultivated very early and exerted strong influence on subsequent folk music. The whole Christian calendar of feasts was introduced and combined with native celebrations. The Indians had a strong ritual musical tradition and adapted Christian religious music very readily. Patron saints and their commemorative days became especially important, and the community fiesta emerged as an essential event through Latin America.\n\nNumerous Catholic devotional songs were translated into Indian languages, and the Iberian medieval church theatre, with its affiliated dances, was introduced to the native populations. For example, Iberian dances of Christians and Moors (danzas de Moros y Cristianos), representing stories of the medieval Crusades, were incorporated into similar dances in Latin America, where the Moors were transformed into native infidels. These were combined with preexisting Indian dances and songs. To the present, numerous dances with religious subjects, such as conversion and resurrection, are an integral part of the folk tradition; examples are the danzas de la Conquista (“dances of the Conquest”) in Mexico and the congados (“dances of the Congo”) of Brazil. These dances continue to incorporate both indigenous and Christian religious elements.\n\nThe Spaniards and the Portuguese also brought numerous genres and styles of secular music from their homelands. Song and dance genres abounded for the main types of life-cycle celebratory observance as well as for all sorts of work and social occasions. Although dance genres of the Iberian Peninsula introduced in the colonies subsequently underwent considerable changes, choreographic traits such as shoe tapping (zapateado), finger snapping, castanet playing, and the use of scarves (danza de pañuelo) were retained in much Latin American folk dancing.\n\nEuropean art music as cultivated in the cathedrals and palaces of Spain and Portugal was introduced in the colonies as early as the 1530s. By the end of the 16th century the Spaniards had established cathedrals in the major cities. They had also founded universities and set up printing presses in the Viceroyalty of New Spain (with Mexico City as the centre) and the Viceroyalty of Peru (with Lima as the centre). Musically, the most active churches during the early colonial period were in Mexico City, Puebla, and Oaxaca (now in Mexico); Cartagena de Indias and Bogotá (now in Colombia); Quito (now in Ecuador); Lima and Cuzco (now in Peru); and La Plata (today Sucre, Bolivia); later Santiago de Cuba (now in Cuba), Caracas (now in Venezuela), Santiago de Chile (now in Chile), Montevideo (now in Uruguay), and Buenos Aires (now in Argentina) became important. In Brazil the Portuguese established convents and churches in Olinda, Recife, Salvador, Rio de Janeiro, and São Paulo. The discovery of gold and precious stones prompted the development of the Minas Gerais area in the 18th century, and churches and fraternal orders were established in Vila Rica (present-day Ouro Prêto), Mariana, São João del Rei, and Arraial do Tejuco (present-day Diamantina).\n\nThe cathedrals became the most important sites of music performance and training. Cathedral chapelmasters composed not only Latin works for church rituals but also Spanish or Portuguese works for celebrations; for example, the polyphonic villancico (a Christmas song genre) became a significant part of their output in some areas. In Mexico City the first 16th-century composer of polyphony was the Spanish-born Hernando Franco, who wrote a Magnificat that reveals control of both the technical and the expressive aspects of contemporary Spanish polyphony. In the next century the Mexican Francisco López Capillas appears to have been the most accomplished and prolific composer of Latin music (especially masses) of his time; the Puebla chapelmaster Juan Gutiérrez de Padilla showed a special talent for composing polychoral pieces, including villancicos. Manuel de Zumaya, an early 18th-century Mexico City chapelmaster, produced the expected Latin music and villancicos in the European Baroque style; he also composed the opera La Parténope, produced at the viceroyal palace in 1711. By the middle of the 18th century, subsequent chapelmasters in Mexico City had enlarged the cathedral orchestra and introduced elements of the current, more homophonic (i.e., primarily chordal) Italian style.\n\nIn the Andean areas, noteworthy composers included perhaps the most significant 16th-century composer in Hispanic America, Gutierre Fernández Hidalgo; the 17th-century Lima chapelmaster Tomás de Torrejón y Velasco, who wrote the first Latin American opera, La púrpura de la rosa (1701; “The Blood of the Rose”); his contemporary Juan de Araujo; and the 18th-century composer José de Orejón y Aparicio.\n\nThe extant colonial repertory of secular music (i.e., functioning in a nonreligious context) is quite limited. Operas and other dramatic representations, as well as instrumental music, were cultivated, but few examples survive. From Mexico, three examples of tablature remain (one for organ, one for vihuela, and one a cittern instruction book). From Valladolid (present-day Morelia, Mexico), there are several pieces of 18th-century instrumental music, including two overtures (sinfonias) for small orchestra, attributed to Antonio Rodil and Antonio Sarrier. In Lima, the Coliseo theatre was especially active during the 18th century under the Italian Bartolomé Massa, some of whose stage music (in the form of the comedia) survives."
