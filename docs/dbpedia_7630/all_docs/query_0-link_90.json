        "text": "For more than three centuries the Sephardic Jewish community of England has added its accent of color, tradition, and a certain aristocratic dignity—sometimes a bit stuffy, some say—to the British scene. MARK RAVEN, drawing upon Albert M. Hyamson’s recently published The Sephardim of England (British Book Centre, 468 pp., $7.50), offers here a description and appreciation of this exotic yet quite British strain in English society and culture.\n\n_____________\n\nOn December 19, 1951, His Royal Highness the Duke of Edinburgh paid a state visit to the Bevis Marks Synagogue of the Sephardi (“Spanish and Portuguese”) Jews of London, to take part in the glittering yet reverent celebration of the two hundred and fiftieth anniversary of its opening. In external form, nothing in the synagogue had changed over these two hundred and fifty years. The great hanging candelabra and sconces of polished brass still held innumerable real candles, throwing their warm glow on the paneling and latticework of another age. The ministers, in their 18th-century top hats, recited the prayers in the strangely nasal accent and the half-Oriental chant handed down to them in a strictly maintained tradition. The congregants still bore many of the same family names—de Mesquita, da Costa, Pinto, Casseres, Mocatta, Carvalho, etc.—common not only when the “new” synagogue was opened in 1701, but when the community had been originally founded in 1663, and indeed even a century earlier, in some cases, when Mariano Jews from Portugal, forced to conceal their religion, had visited England from time to time or lived there, with more or less tacit recognition of their true faith.\n\nCertainly there is a marvelous indestructibility about the London Sephardi community. An empire has risen and grown old; man’s faith and habits in the outer world have felt many shocks and changes; but here nothing has changed. The royal family still gives the community the gracious patronage of an official visit, as Princess Anne (who later became Queen Anne) did in 1685. The leading families of the synagogue are still among the brokers and merchants of the City, with business connections all over the world. Jealous of its tradition, the community still looks up to the Mahamad (board of five executive officers) and the velhos (elders) to conduct the affairs of the synagogue with strict adherence to the ascamot (laws). The same charities for the poorer Sephardim of London still preoccupy the members: the Honen Dalim, Menahem Abelim, Hebrat Yetomot, Hebrat Moalim (succoring the poor, comforting the mourners, society for female orphans, society for circumcisers) still exist. And the same community which once collected funds regularly for cautivos (Sephardim in the Middle East captured by pirates and held for ransom) and terra santa (the needs of Jews in the Holy Land under the Turks) now does the same work by raising money to give to the State of Israel for the rehabilitation and training of Sephardi immigrants.\n\nIs it that nothing has changed, or perhaps that everything has changed—the Sephardim with it, so that they are less a dusty bypath of history, carefully preserved from modern traffic, than a recognizable part of the main route, constantly made over as the years go by? It might be tempting, sometimes, to think of this community as a strangely exotic flower imported from abroad and kept alive by the English climate of tolerance. But this does little justice to the interplay of history between England and the community, so interestingly told in a new book by Albert Hyamson. One is reminded, reading it, how wrong it is to think of the English tradition as overwhelmingly Anglo-Saxon in its inspiration. Nothing could be more “alien” than the Sephardi group, so proud of its foreign names and its outlandish—almost Spanishrespect for an inflexible code. Yet nothing at the same time could be more English. Indeed, the injection by this group of something “alien” into the stream of English life for nearly three hundred years is part of the process which has produced the English character.\n\n_____________\n\nThough the Sephardim came to England at different times and from different places, they were always conscious of an adherence to a separate physical group as much as to a religious sect. It was their family connections in many countries that had made them useful as “intelligencers” to Queen Elizabeth and her ministers in 16th century England. The few Marranos left had been expelled in 1609, but within twenty years the immigration had begun again, considerably before the open readmission of the Jews to England. With England’s trade position in the world growing, Jewish families, skilled in international trade, began to settle in London, coming from the Canary Islands, the West Indies, Amsterdam, and Portugal itself; and a Jewish community of “Portuguese” origin was openly recognized by 1656. Pepys’ visit to their synagogue in 1663 is not the only visit recorded.\n\nThese early settlers were men of means—merchants, financiers, and doctors, for the most part—and their family pride was as strong as their devotion to the Judaism that, in earlier years, they had had to conceal. They were rigidly Orthodox, but even then there was some movement in and out of the community. Sir Augustin Coronel, who had suggested the profitable and momentous marriage of King Charles II to Catherine of Braganza, was baptized before receiving as his reward the honor of knighthood. Later in life, having lost his wealth, he returned to Judaism and was supported by his relatives, the Mendes and da Costa families.\n\nThe early settlers, linked with Portugal, were reinforced by a considerable immigration of Sephardim from Holland after the accession to the English throne of William of Orange and Mary in 1688. In the early 18th-century, Italy provided a new source, some Sephardi families coming from Venice (including the d’Israeli and Treves families), some from Leghorn (including the Montefiores). Another source of Sephardi immigration during that century, especially towards the end, was North Africa, the immigrants to Britain coming by way of Britain’s new outpost, Gibraltar. They were often looked down on at first as Berberiscos (almost as bad as Tudescos, i.e. German Jews), but they produced many names later to be known—Bensusan, Sarfaty, Nahon, to mention a few.\n\nThe Sephardim were already a recognizable element in British life, almost as distinct from their Ashkenazi co-religionists as from the non-Jewish world around them. They made their special contribution to England, as the years went by, both by persisting and by disappearing. In their “persistent” role, with their distinctive names and dignified—some might say snobbish—bearing, they went about their business devoudy, solidly, and tenaciously, while presenting a picture often attractive to Englishmen, that of the well-born foreigner who is deeply identified with England and who has an additional charm because he is never quite the same as an Englishman. In their “disappearing” role, they wove themselves into the English tradition by a process of intermarriage so involved as to suggest that half the British aristocracy has some “Jewish blood” somewhere in its history. Intermarriage is not an unusual phenomenon in Jewish history. The distinctive thing about this intermarriage was that where one group, immensely conscious of its genealogy, married into another proud group, the mingling of streams can be observed over a long distance.\n\n_____________\n\nIt is the story of the families that stayed loyal to the synagogue that is mostly told in Mr. Hyamson’s book, though the reader is invited to enjoy plenty of genealogical asides. It is interesting, for example, to see how a name like Moses Baruch Lousada, owned by a member of the Mahamad in 1663, turns up repeatedly in Anglo-Jewish history, either as held by one branch of Lousadas that remained within the Jewish community and are still active in it, or in the ennobled form of Duke de Losada y Lousada, a tide conferred on a member of the family by the King of Naples in 1759, or in the form of Barrow (Baruch), some Barrows remaining Jewish for a long time, others becoming non-Jews, including a whole dynasty of British generals.\n\nThere are plenty of similar, even more “glamorous,” examples. Among the descendants of Sampson Gideon, a leading financier of the 18th century, were the Irish patriot Robert Erskine Childers, the present Lord Auckland, and a former Duchess of Norfolk. One branch of the famed Mendes family produced the non-Jewish military family of Head, Sit George Head being Commissary-General, and Sir Francis Head, Lieutenant Governor of Upper Canada. The Mendes and da Costa families united in the romantic figure of Kitty Villa Real, whose daughter married Viscount Galway, an ancestor of the Marquess of Crewe. As for the Treves family, which tradition relates to Rashi of Troyes, one member who left the faith—Pellegrin Treves—is the direct ancestor, says Mr. Hyamson, of “an appreciable section of the Roman Catholic aristocracy of England.”\n\n_____________\n\nIt is a familiar pattern to find the clumsiness or inflexibility of the synagogue leading to the first breach, with the departed member, having made his children Christians, turning back at the end to the shelter of his ancestral faith. Sampson Gideon, who saved the credit of the government during the rebellion of 1745 by putting at its disposal a vast sum of money subscribed by his fellow Jews, was a loyal if passive member of the synagogue under the name Rehuel Abudiente, but sent his resignation to the Mahamad when they used his name without his permission in a public statement on naturalization. In a long, furious—and notarized—letter, he wrote: “Tour assuming a power of representing me in point of political or Civil Interest . . . is certainly as little consistent with prudence, as with the Law of Nature, or the law of the Land, and the more so as you knew the matter solicited for to be directly contrary to my declared Sentiments. . . . I hereby declare that I am not, nor will be from henceforth, any Member of your Society or Congregation, by whatever name you may have entered me or distinguished me therein. . . .” The resignation was duly recorded in the minutes of the Mahamad (which, incidentally, were kept in Portuguese until 1819); but when Gideon died, nine years after his resignation, it was found that he had bequeathed a thousand pounds to the synagogue and other legacies to the orphanage and Beth Holim Hospital, asking to be buried with his people.\n\nEven more dramatic in its consequences was the resignation, equally unnecessary, of Isaac d’Israeli, father of Benjamin Disraeli. It had been laid down in the ascamot from the beginning that every yahid (member of the synagogue) was bound to accept any office in the community bestowed on him, and to pay a substantial fine if he refused. This, with other fines for synagogal offences, had become a considerable source of revenue. Isaac d’Israeli, a devoted book-lover who took no more active interest in the synagogue than he did in his father’s business, was informed one day in 1813, to his surprise, that he had been elected Parnas (president). On declining the honor, he was told that the same laws under which he had been elected Parnas provided a fine of forty pounds for refusal to accept. He refused to pay, pointing out that he was quite unfitted for the office and deploring the legalistic approach of the Mahamad: “Even the Government of a small sect can only be safely conducted by enlightened principles. . . . But against all this you are perpetually pleading your existing laws. . . . It is of these obsolete laws that so many complain. They were adapted by fugitives to their particular situation. . . . You have laws to regulate what has ceased to exist. . . .”\n\nYet he hesitated to make a final breach, and even four years later he was willing to pay his finta (regular assessment) if they would stop pressing him for the fine. They refused, and he withdrew. For his children he finally decided on baptism, with the result that there was, in that event, no bar to his son entering Parliament in 1837 and rising to become Prime Minister. But Isaac never lost his attachment to his faith; in 1842, blind and with little strength, he left his house in the country to attend the inauguration of a new synagogue, founded by the “progressive” elements in both the Sephardi and Ashkenazi communities.\n\n_____________\n\nThe foundation of this new synagogue— the West London Synagogue of British (as distinct from Portuguese or German) Jews—was a climactic moment in the history of the Sephardim. The first law of their constitution had laid down in 1663 that no other Sephardi synagogue could be founded in the city of London, under penalty of herem (excommunication) for those attending it. As the residential area moved westward in London from the old city, the movement for a branch synagogue grew in strength, but the conservative elements in the Mahamad continued to resist the proposal, mainly, as they said, because “there is reason to apprehend that their contemplated establishment is to be on principles opposed to the received religious institutions and ordinances of our Nation, that it is not to be subject to ecclesiastical discipline in religious matters and that its promoters are engaged in alterations and abridgements of our established ritual. . . .”\n\nThe split was clearly doctrinal. The seceders—many descended from the earliest Sephardi settlers—were proposing a “reformed” Judaism, while holding, as all seceders do, that they were really only adapting the true spirit of the old tradition to meet modern needs. They went their way, along with Ashkenazi reformers, and were officially excommunicated by the Sephardi and Ashkenazi authorities. The joint rabbinical statement of excommunication said that persons “who do not believe in the Oral Law cannot be permitted to have any communion with an Israelite in any religious or sacred act.” Sir Moses Montefiore, the redoubtable leader of the Sephardim and head of the Board of Jewish Deputies for nearly forty years, refused for some time even to allow members of the seceding synagogue to sit on the Board of Deputies and deal with lay problems of the Jewish community. But time healed the wounds, not by establishing some middle way—a futile procedure in theology— but by allowing the parent synagogue to see that it could still express itself fully, without the need to compromise. When it realized this, the parent became friends with its offspring.\n\nWith reformers peacefully out of the way, the old synagogue seems to have suffered little from any further theological controversies. Many of the old rigidities relaxed.\n\nIntermarriage between Sephardi and Ashkenazi had already been conceded, though earlier it had been heavily frowned on, and the mingling of the leading Jewish families in England became a common occurrence. The synagogue itself founded a “branch” in the west of London that became the center of the community, with the old-city synagogue of Bevis Marks little more than a showpiece. The services became increasingly orderly—an objective of the “reformers”—and tradition received another century of reinforcement. One wonders indeed, reading Mr. Hyamson’s book, whether acute theology, in the form of argumentative conviction, did not disappear too completely. Have the English Sephardim become the antiquarian guardians, “all passion spent,” of a beautiful relic?\n\nCertainly one misses today the excitement that could be generated, as Mr. Hyamson records, in 1703, when the Haham (the leader of the community) was publicly attacked by a member of the synagogue for teaching pantheism in a sermon in which he had stated that “God and Nature are one.” The attacker, Joseph Sarfaty, challenged the Mahamad to submit the case to any Jewish authority anywhere, and offered to pay one hundred pounds if he lost the decision. The members were split into two camps, and at one point the Mahamad had even to appeal to the attorney-general for a ruling as to whether they could on legal grounds refuse synagogal privileges to dissidents. In due course, the religious question was submitted to the Beth Din of Amsterdam, but the ruling was inconclusive. Finally it was put to the revered scholar Rabbi Zevi Ashkenazi of Altona, and a ruling was given in the Haham’s favor.\n\nPassions burn equally fiercely today, but in different guise, so that a history of the contemporary synagogue becomes a social study, and only political questions, it seems, glow with the fervor of theology. Within these limits, the Sephardim of England may claim to be very much alive. They play a leading part in the institutions for Jewish education and study. They have become the central group for a revived World Federation of Sephardim. And in their synagogue, devotion and tradition combine to produce a service that has its own authenticity and beauty.\n\n_____________"
