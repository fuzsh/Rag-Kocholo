Methodological and theoretical advances have been notable in this period of time, with the increasing use of longitudinal and experimental designs allowing for a greater understanding of the predictors and outcomes that relate to SWB, along with the process that underlie these associations. In addition, theories about these processes have become more intricate, as findings reveal that many associations with SWB depend on people’s culture and values and the context in which they live. This review provides an overview of many major areas of research, including the measurement of SWB, the demographic and personality-based predictors of SWB, and process-oriented accounts of individual differences in SWB. In addition, because a major new focus in recent years has been the development of national accounts of subjective well-being, we also review attempts to use SWB measures to guide policy decisions.\n\nSubjective well-being (SWB) reflects an overall evaluation of the quality of a person’s life from her or his own perspective. Interest in the phenomenon is broad, spanning both popular writing and scientific work. Scientific investigations into the topic are interdisciplinary, with research coming from diverse fields including psychology, economics, sociology, philosophy, gerontology, kinesiology, and the health sciences. Thus, as the field has expanded, it has become increasingly difficult to keep abreast of the various empirical and theoretical developments that have emerged. Indeed, , which plots three-year averages for the number of articles that include the term “subjective well-being,” shows the huge growth in the field, with over 170,000 articles that mention the topic published since a major comprehensive review in 1999 (Diener, Suh, Lucas, & Smith, 1999).\n\nAt this point, given the amount of research that exists, a thorough and detailed overview of what we know about SWB, including the strength of support for specific research findings or theoretical models would be impossible. Yet, at the same time, it is useful to reflect on the broad advances that have occurred, to point towards research findings that appear to have reasonable support, and to identify the most fruitful avenues for future research on the topic. The goal of the current review is not to provide a comprehensive overview of all existing research in the field, but to describe several of the most important advances that have occurred in recent years and help clarify what additional research is needed.\n\nDefining Subjective Well-Being\n\nAs the term implies, SWB refers to the extent to which a person believes or feels that his or her life is going well. The descriptor “subjective” serves to define and limit the scope of the construct: SWB researchers are interested in evaluations of the quality of a person’s life from that person’s own perspective. This issue can sometimes cause confusion in the literature because it is tempting to equate subjective well-being with broader forms of well-being, and there are many theories of well-being that are not subjective in nature. For instance, philosophers have frequently proposed various objective-list-based models of well-being, which attempt to specify all the critical ingredients that are required for a person to have a good life (Hurka, 2014). SWB researchers acknowledge that SWB cannot and should not be equated with well-being. Instead, SWB should be thought of as the facet or specific form of well-being that captures how people evaluate their own lives.\n\nYet despite this acknowledgement that SWB is not synonymous with well-being, SWB researchers also point out that there are some clear reasons to study and understand this narrower construct. Indeed, there is even a plausible argument to be made that SWB may be one of the best available proxies for a broader, more canonical form of well-being; and it is the subjective nature of the construct that gives it its power. This is due to the fact that different people likely weight different objective circumstances differently depending on their goals, their values, and even their culture. Presumably, subjective evaluations of quality of life reflect these idiosyncratic reactions to objective life circumstances in ways that alternative approaches (such as the objective-list approach) cannot. Thus, when evaluating the impact of events, interventions, or public-policy decisions on quality of life, subjective evaluations may provide a better mechanism for assessment than alternative, objective approaches. The fact that SWB measures may serve as easily measured proxy for well-being more broadly helps explain the popularity of the construct.\n\nLimiting the construct of SWB in this way also allows for clear differentiation between related, but distinct concepts. For instance, researchers have at times debated the extent to which SWB is distinguishable from the set of constructs subsumed under the term Eudaimonic Well-Being (Keyes, Schmotkin, & Ryff, 2002). Eudaimonic well-being includes such characteristics as a sense of purpose in life and the existence of positive relationships with others. By defining SWB as a person’s subjective evaluation of the quality of his or her own life, it is possible to distinguish between the two sets of constructs. Eudaimonic well-being clearly includes characteristics that are typically assessed using subjective measures (i.e., self-reports). In addition, the specific characteristics subsumed under the umbrella of eudaimonic well-being likely contribute to a good life. However, the specific constructs fall outside of the domain of SWB as we have defined it because they do not refer specifically to a person’s own evaluation of the quality of his or her life. It may turn out that people require strong and healthy relationships to evaluate their life positively, but this does not mean that measures of these relationship variables can be equated with that person’s evaluation of life as a whole. Thus, SWB researchers would not deny the importance of social relationships (or any other variable that eudaimonic-well-being researchers typically assess); instead, they would conceptualize quality of social relationships as a potential predictor of one’s subjective evaluation of life as a whole, rather than as part of the evaluation itself. We believe that this distinction between ingredients of a life lived well and the subjective evaluations of that life are essential, and the terms listed in reflect this distinction (see Diener, Lucas, Schimmack, & Helliwell, 2009; Oishi, 2012 for a more complete discussion)1.\n\nTable 1\n\nConceptDefinitionExample of Measures/ResearchWell-BeingThe most general term covering how well individuals are doing in life, including social, health, material, and subjective dimensions of well-being.See Kitayama & Markus (2000); Searle (2008) for theoretical discussionsPsychological Well-BeingA term that has come to be equated with Eudaimonic Well-Being (see below). Thus, it is often used in a way that does not refer to all possible types of psychological well-being, but only to one form of well-being.Ryff & Keyes (1995); Brown & Ryan (2003)Quality of LifeA term usually referring to a person’s overall life circumstances, including environmental, social, societal, material, and other aspects of their life that would affect how desirable and positive his or her life is.See Hagerty, Cummins, Ferriss, Land, Michalos et al. (2001)Subjective Well-BeingGeneral term referring to the various types of subjective evaluations of one’s life, including both cognitive evaluations and affective feelings.See Diener (1984) for conceptual discussionsLife SatisfactionPeople’s explicit and conscious evaluations of their lives, often based on factors that the individual deems relevant.Diener, Emmons, Larsen, & Griffin (1985); Cantril 1965\n\nChildren & Adolescents:\n\nHuebner, 2004; Gadermann, Guhn, & Zumbo, 2011Domain SatisfactionsNarrower than life satisfaction, domain satisfactions refer to evaluations of various domains in life such as health, work, and relationships.Frisch, Clark, Rouse, Rudd, Paweleck, & Greenstone (2005)\n\nChildren:\n\nHuebner (1994)Positive AffectPositive, pleasant, and desirable emotional feelings and moods.Diener, Wirtz, et al. (2010)Negative AffectNegative, unpleasant, and undesirable emotional feelings and moods.Diener, Wirtz, et al. (2010)Affect BalanceThe preponderance of positive affect over negative affect.Computed by subtracting negative from positive affectHedonic Well-BeingA person’s well-being derived from pleasure, and lowered by pain. Often scholars will include physical pleasures, pleasures of the mind, and emotions.See Kahneman, 1999 for theoretical discussionsEmotional Well-BeingPeople’s positive moods and emotions and low levels of negative moods and emotions, and reflects not only momentary enjoyment, but also movement toward goals that are congruent with a person's motives. In addition, Emotional Well-Being is thought to include resilience after bad events, and the ability to express various emotions that are functional and appropriate to the situation.Brunstein et al. (1998)\n\nFredrickson & Joiner (2002)Experienced Well-BeingA person’s experiences of well-being “on-line,” from moment to moment, often contrasted with Recalled Well-Being and Evaluative Well-Being (see below).Kahneman et al. (2004); Oishi et al., 2004; Schimmack (2003)Recalled Well-BeingHow people recall their feelings of well-being, often during a specific past period of time or episode.Oishi & Sullivan (2006); Robinson & Clore (2002); Scollon et al. (2004); Thomas & Diener (1990)Evaluative Well-BeingPeople’s explicit evaluations and judgments of their lives, including both Life Satisfaction, Domain Satisfactions, and other evaluative judgments about their life.Kahneman & Deaton (2010)Eudaimonic Well-BeingIn contrast to Subjective Well-Being, this refers to well-being defined as desirable psychological characteristics such as meaning and purpose, positive social relationships, mastery, autonomy, virtues, and so forth, which can enhance effective functioning and Subjective Well-Being. Eudaimonic refers to Aristotle’s notions of well-being based on the good functioning person.Butler & Kern (2016); Hills & Argyle (2002); Ryff & Keyes (1995); Deci & Ryan (2008); Diener, Wirtz, Tov, Kim-Prieto, Choi et al. (2009); Su, Diener, Tay, 2014Happy or HappinessThis popular word can be confusing because it means different things in different contexts and to different people. It may mean positive feelings at the moment, long-term life satisfaction, all forms of well-being, or even the causes of subjective well-being. This word is helpful at times communicating with the public, but can be confusing in a scientific context.Lyubomirsky & Lepper (1999)\n\nOnce the domain of SWB is constrained to subjective evaluations of one’s life, it is then possible to consider the diverse ways that that the quality of one’s life can be appraised. At first glance, it may seem that the only way such an evaluation could be obtained is simply by asking respondents to consider the various features of their lives and to provide an explicit judgment about the quality of that life (an approach that is most clearly reflected in self-report measures of global life satisfaction). For instance, the widely used Satisfaction With Life Scale (SWLS; Diener, Emmons, Larson, & Griffin, 1985) asks simple, face-valid questions like “I am satisfied with my life.” However, alternative possibilities exist. For instance, because emotions include an evaluative component, some have argued that people’s emotional experiences may provide evidence as to their overall evaluation of life as a whole (e.g., Kahneman, 1999). Specifically, people whose lives include many desirable features might tend to experience positive emotions as they encounter those desirable features on a moment-to-moment basis. Thus, it is possible to assess SWB by assessing how frequently or intensely people experience a variety of positive and negative emotions such as “happy,” “sad,” “angry,” or “joyful” (Diener, Wirtz, Tov, et al., 2010). Accordingly, one important distinction in the conceptualization of SWB focuses on the contrast between more cognitive, judgment-focused evaluations like life satisfaction and more affective evaluations that are obtained when asking about a person’s typical emotional experience.\n\nA related distinction concerns the timeframe over which these evaluations are made. Kahneman and Riis (2005), in summarizing this distinction, noted that evaluations that occur as a person experiences the conditions of her or his life are different than the more reflective evaluations that that person makes when thinking back on the various features of one’s life as a whole (Some have termed these two ways of evaluating life “experiential” versus “evaluative” measures of SWB). The latter task—evaluating one’s life as a whole or aggregating over emotional experiences from a long time period—may be difficult for respondents to do, which may make these evaluations prone to biases that affect their validity (Kahneman, 1999; Schwarz and Strack, 1999; see below for a more complete discussion). Advocates of the experiential approach argue that in situ reports of emotional experiences avoid many problems that occur with global retrospective evaluations and thus may provide more valid measures of SWB.\n\nBefore describing the specific measurement issues that emerge when assessing these components of SWB, it is important to acknowledge one additional conceptual issue. Although SWB researchers typically emphasize the need for assessing both affective and cognitive components (Busseri & Sadava, 2011), a case could be made that emotional experiences may not provide an optimal measure of overall quality of life (see Diener et al., 2009, for a discussion). Because emotions are multiply determined, it is possible that the emotional experiences that people have do not directly reflect their evaluation of the conditions of their lives. Furthermore, people may differ in the extent to which they value pleasant emotional experiences. For instance, people who achieve high levels of positive emotional experiences through superficial means (e.g., drugs or other meaningless pleasures) may still evaluate their lives negatively because that life lacks meaning or some other fundamental feature. Because both cognitive and affective measures are typically included in broad models of SWB, and because of the theoretical basis for conceptualizing affective responses as moment-to-moment evaluations of life as it is lived (Kahneman, 1999), we focus both on cognitive and affective components in this review. We do, however, acknowledge that future empirical and theoretical work could provide evidence that one component is more central than the other.\n\nMeasuring Subjective Well-Being\n\nA central focus of SWB research over the past few decades is the reliability and validity of measures of SWB (for a review of specific measures, see Pavot, 2018). Because most measures are simple self-reports, considerable research addresses the psychometric properties of these types of assessments. This research consistently shows that existing self-report measures exhibit strong psychometric properties including high internal consistency when multiple-item measures are used; moderately strong test-retest reliability, especially over short periods of time; reasonable convergence with alternative measures (especially those that have also been shown to have high levels of reliability and validity); and theoretically meaningful patterns of associations with other constructs and criteria (see Diener et al., 2009, and Diener, Inglehart, & Tay, 2013, for reviews). There is little debate about the quality of SWB measures when evaluated using these traditional criteria.\n\nResearch also shows that even single-item measures—those measures that are most likely to be used in large-scale panel studies or large-scale efforts by governments to track the well-being of their populations—are strong when it comes to traditional psychometric properties. For instance, Lucas and Donnellan (2012) used longitudinal data from four large panel studies to show that the reliability of single-item life satisfaction measures is moderately high (typically around .70), and Cheung and Lucas (2014) used two large datasets to compare the validity of single-item to multiple-item life satisfaction measures. They found that correlations with relevant criteria were virtually identical across the two types of measures, suggesting that there is little loss of validity when single-item measures are used.\n\nDespite the strength of evidence for the strong psychometric properties of these measures, researchers within and outside of psychology are often (and rightfully) skeptical of self-report methods (Lucas & Baird, 2006), especially as they pertain to the construct of SWB. People may deceive themselves about their own well-being, or they may be unwilling to provide an honest answer to researchers who ask about their well-being. The meaning of the question asked may vary depending on the context in which it is presented, resulting in differing answers in different contexts (Schwarz, 1999). For all of these reasons, much research attention has been aimed at clarifying the extent to which SWB measures behave as the underlying measurement theories predict they should. One approach has been to develop a better understanding about the process underlying self-reported well-being judgments.\n\nProcess Accounts of Global Self-Report SWB Measures\n\nCampbell (1981) was one of the first to critically evaluate the processes involved in constructing well-being judgments. He argued that three assumptions must be met in order for well-being judgments to be meaningful: (a) the experiences that people encounter should add up to global feelings of well-being, (b) these feelings ought to be relatively stable over time (because life circumstances typically change relatively slowly), and (c) people should be able to report these feelings with candor and accuracy. Laboratory studies challenge these assumptions in several ways.\n\nOne of the fundamental issues concerns whether or not people, when asked to evaluate their lives as a whole, are willing and able to conduct a comprehensive search of relevant information in memory, and whether they are then able to aggregate this information and provide a meaningful response. Research shows, for instance, that when asked to evaluate affective experiences over a long period of time, people make judgments too quickly to conduct a thorough search of memory (Robinson & Clore, 2002). The fact that people can make these judgments almost instantaneously suggests that they are not considering all the relevant information that could be used to evaluate the quality of their lives. Perhaps they are recalling a global judgment of their lives stored in memory, but it is also possible that people use heuristics that enable quick judgments but that also may lead to biased reports. Researchers from the judgment-model tradition (e.g., Schwarz & Strack, 1999) investigate these possibilities.\n\nOne explanation for the rapid responses is that respondents do not retrieve relevant episodic memories when making SWB judgments, but instead rely on their immediate affective reaction to these thoughts as a basis for their judgment. The problem, judgment researchers point out, is that if an irrelevant factor influences mood at the time of judgment, this may lead to biased reports of long-term SWB. If a person happens to be in a good mood at the time the response is provided, the respondent may report unusually high levels of life satisfaction as compared to the report he or she would give when in a bad mood. In support of this idea, Schwarz, Strack, and their colleagues published numerous studies showing that life satisfaction judgments can be influenced by factors such as the weather at the time of judgment (Schwarz & Clore, 1983), whether one’s favorite soccer team recently won a game (Schwarz, Strack, Kommer, & Wagner, 1987), and whether one recently experienced a subtle mood induction (Schwarz & Clore, 1983). As Schwarz and Strack (1999) point out, the large size of effects found in these studies (with standardized effect sizes in the range of one to two standard deviations) leads to concerns about the reliability and validity of well-being measures.\n\nThere are two issues that emerge, however, when considering the implications of judgment-model research for the understanding of the reliability and validity of SWB measures. First, as measurement theorists have noted, experimental studies like those cited above, on their own, provide little evidence regarding the validity of the measures themselves (Alwin, 2007). It is possible that the processes identified do influence well-being judgments, but that their effect on validity of surveys is minimal. Thus, one needs directly to assess the effects of mood and other theoretically irrelevant factors on the validity of the measures. Second, although there are now a small number of studies that exhibit mood effects on well-being judgments, almost all have relied on extremely small samples, and few direct replications have been conducted (Yap, Wortman, Anusic, Baker, Scherer, Donnellan & Lucas, in press). Thus, in light of the imprecision of results from studies that rely on small samples, it is unclear whether the effects that have been found are large enough to have practical implications. Indeed, more recent large-sample replication attempts have suggested that mood effects on judgment are generally very small.\n\nFor instance, Lucas and Lawless (2013) examined the effects of weather on life satisfaction judgments in a sample of approximately one million U.S. residents who were assessed in a cross-sectional design over a four-year period. Although Lucas and Lawless did not directly assess mood, the logic of the initial investigation by Schwarz and Clore (1983) was that naturally occurring weather fluctuations would affect mood, which would in turn affect life satisfaction judgments. Although the size of these effects found across a broad range of weather conditions may not be as large as those in the original study (because Schwarz and Clore specifically targeted days that were supposed to be especially nice or especially unpleasant), they should still be detectable given the power of the Lucas and Lawless study. However, Lucas and Lawless found, at best, tiny effects of weather on life satisfaction judgments. Furthermore, in nine separate replication attempts, Yap et al. (in press) found only weak evidence that experimentally manipulated mood (including manipulations based on weather at the time of judgment) influenced life satisfaction judgments. Relatedly, Eid and Diener (2004) directly assessed momentary mood (rather than inferring it from conditions), as well as SWB, and found mood effects on SWB measures to be generally small and inconsistent. This research, when combined with the fact that the original studies used extremely small sample sizes and have not been directly replicated, suggest that the effects of mood are not a strong concern for the reliability and validity of SWB judgments, though more large-sample research on this topic would aid the interpretation of the existing literature.\n\nOther studies from the judgment-model tradition examine additional contextual factors beyond mood that could potentially bias SWB judgments. For instance, in one frequently cited study, Strack, Martin, and Schwarz (1988) tested whether making certain information (in this case one’s dating life) salient before asking respondents for global life satisfaction judgments would make it more likely that that information would be used in the subsequent judgment. They found that the correlation between satisfaction with dating frequency and overall life satisfaction was .66 when dating frequency question was asked first, whereas the correlation was just −.12 when the dating frequency question was asked after the general life satisfaction question. The effect size for this item-order effect was an extremely large d of 1.83, suggesting that the validity of SWB judgments might be compromised by biased judgment processes. As was true with the mood studies, however, these initial investigations relied on extremely small sample sizes, and larger studies have failed to replicate these effects. For instance, in a large meta-analysis on the item-order effect on life satisfaction judgments, Schimmack and Oishi (2005) showed that the item-order effect like those investigated by Strack et al. was quite small (Cohen’s d = .18).\n\nAdditional work is required before item-order effects, and effects identified by judgment-model researchers more broadly, are fully understood. For instance, although Schimmack and Oishi (2005) found that item order effects are typically small in the laboratory, it is clear that occasionally they can be large. Deaton and Stone (2016), for example, used data from the Gallup Daily Poll to show that asking respondents questions about politics right before a global life evaluation question substantially reduced scores on the global evaluation of life. However, it is not clear what the mechanism underlying this effect is because asking a single transition question (i.e., adding “Now thinking about your personal life,”) after the political questions and before the global evaluation virtually eliminated the item-order effect. Thus, it is not clear whether asking questions about politics primed negative information that was later used in the global evaluation, or whether the preceding political questions implied something to respondents about what the survey organizers included when asking the respondents to evaluate their lives as a whole. These distinctions are important because they have implications for how these potentially biasing factors can be prevented. In sum, the studies on how people respond to SWB surveys can reveal important mental processes. At the same time, recent studies reveal that potential biases usually do not seriously threaten the validity of the measures.\n\nAlternatives to Global Self-Reports: Experiential Measures\n\nThe studies reviewed above focus on the ways that irrelevant information (such as mood or aspects of one’s life that a person would not typically weigh heavily had it not been made salient) can affect global judgments of well-being. In addition to this concern, a separate line of research suggests that participants may not aggregate across various experiences in ways that are ideal. For instance, Kahneman, Fredrickson, and their colleagues showed that the summary rating of an overall experience tends to be biased toward the most intense feelings that one experienced during the episode and the feelings that the person experienced at end of the episode. In contrast, the duration of the positive and negative experiences themselves tend to be neglected (Fredrickson & Kahneman, 1993; Kahneman, Fredrickson, Schreiber, & Redelmeier, 1993; Redelmeier & Kahneman, 1996). So even if respondents are relying on accurate information, they may not aggregate that information in a way that is logical or that matches the expectations of those who are conducting the research.\n\nOne intuitively appealing alternative is to take the difficult task of aggregation out of the hands of respondents and to have researchers compute the calculations themselves, based on repeated assessments of momentary mood or satisfaction over the course of an extended period of time. For instance, Kahneman (1999) suggested that even if researchers are skeptical about responses that people give to questions about their affective states, respondents should be able to indicate accurately at any given moment whether they are feeling pleasant or unpleasant. Ratings of precisely how pleasant or unpleasant they feel may be suspect, as people may use these scales in different ways; but even the most skeptical among us may agree that individuals can usually identify whether any particular moment is predominantly good or bad. Thus, according to Kahneman’s proposal, a measure of objective happiness could be obtained by asking people many times over an extended period whether they feel pleasant or unpleasant, and then these recorded responses could be aggregated by the researcher to obtain the percentage of time that someone experiences positive or negative states.\n\nExperience-sampling-based approaches have been used by psychologists for many decades (e.g., Csikszentmihalyi & Larson, 1984). These methods not only allow researchers to capture people’s overall affective experience, they also allow for a closer examination of fluctuations on a moment-to-moment basis, which allows for better insight into the dynamics of SWB over time. Furthermore, although sampling affective experiences on a moment-to-moment basis can be burdensome for participants, methodologists have developed hybrid designs that solve some of these practical problems while retaining many of the benefits of the more intensive sampling approach. For instance, Kahneman, Krueger, Schkade, Schwarz, and Stone (2004) suggested that rather than sampling moments as they happen, respondents could be asked to recreate a recent day of their lives, focusing first on what they did throughout the day and then evaluating the feelings that they experienced while they were engaged in those activities. This Day Reconstruction Method is thought to have many of the same benefits of the more intensive moment sampling methods (which are typically referred to as experience sampling methods or ecological momentary assessment), while reducing the burden on participants.\n\nIt is important to note that although it is possible to articulate reasons why measures that rely on momentary assessment may solve problems that may lead to lower reliability and validity in the global evaluations, it is not necessarily the case that these benefits actually accrue. It is possible that the processes identified by the judgment model do not actually weaken the validity of evaluative measures, or the moment-based experiential methods may have their own weaknesses that counteract their strengths. For instance, it is often only feasible to assess a single day’s experience using the Day Reconstruction Method, and it is not clear how representative one day is for capturing daily experiences over time. It could be that when averaged across a large number of respondents that single randomly chosen days are representative of long-term trends. It is essential that basic psychometric work on both global and experiential measures continue so that researchers can empirically assess the reliability and validity of both types.\n\nThe research that has examined this question suggests that experiential assessments do not have a strong advantage over the more widely criticized global evaluations, at least when the former are aggregated to obtain a single indicator of people’s overall well-being. For instance, studies that use both methods have shown that aggregated experiences of positive emotions are strongly associated with retrospective rating of positive emotions (e.g., r = .76 in the 90-day daily diary study by Barrett, 1997; r = .62 in Study 1, r = .77 in Study 2 of Thomas & Diener, 1990). Furthermore, discrepancies across these approaches may actually support the favorability of global evaluations. Several studies found that retrospective ratings of emotional experiences predict important outcomes such as whether respondents would choose to return to the same vacation spot (Wirtz, Kruger, Scollon, & Diener, 2003) and whether dating couples were still in the same relationship six months later (Oishi & Sullivan, 2006). Other studies show that global evaluations correspond more closely to alternative measures than do experiential methods (Anusic, Lucas, & Donnellan, 2017). Of course, it is also important to note that if the research focus is on how affect and emotions changes over short periods of time, then experiential measures have few viable alternatives. An important goal for future research will be to further clarify how global and experiential measures relate to one another, as well as to important criteria and outcomes.\n\nAdditional Methods of Assessing SWB\n\nAlthough the subjective nature of the construct of SWB pulls for self-report methods, several non-self-report measures of SWB also exist. Such measures complement self-report scales, and converge to some degree with self-report instruments (Sandvik, Diener, and Seidlitz, 1993). For example, Schneider and Schimmack (2009) conducted a meta-analysis of the correlation between self and informant reports, and they found that there is reasonable agreement (r = .42) between these two methods of assessing SWB. Physiological measures, including brain activity (Davidson, 2004) and hormones (Buchanan, al’Absi, & Lovallo, 1999), along with behavioral measures such as the amount of smiling (e.g., Oettingen & Seligman, 1990; Seder & Oishi, 2012) and patterns of online behaviors (Schwartz, Eichstaedt, Kern, Dziurzynski, Agrawal et al., 2013) have also been used to assess SWB. Finally, because happy people think differently than do unhappy people (Robinson & Compton, 2008), it is possible to use behavioral evidence that reflects different cognitive processes as an indicator of SWB. People high in SWB may be able to recall a greater number of positive events from their lives, to make more frequent positive associations to words, be quicker to identify positive stimuli, and more readily endorse positive adjectives as accurate descriptions of themselves.\n\nAlthough cognitive and physiological indicators provide promising alternatives that could potentially address problems associated with self-report methods, it is unlikely that they will be able to replace self-report methods in the near future. First, in regard to cognitive measures, although there are strong reasons to think that happy and unhappy people differ in their cognitive patterns, the theories linking these constructs are currently far from complete. Furthermore, the links between the underlying feelings and judgments of well-being and their cognitive consequences are indirect. Therefore, the cognitive outcomes may be weak indicators of the underlying construct. Similarly, in regard to biological indicators, attempts to map physiological factors to subjective feelings have had mixed success (Ito & Cacioppo, 1999; LeDoux & Armony, 1999). This is likely because there is not a one-to-one correspondence between physiological systems as currently assessed and the subjective evaluations that SWB researchers study. Thus, even though physiological processes are certainly involved in subjective evaluations, at this time these evaluations cannot be reduced to simple physiological signals. Thus, although cognitive and physiological measures will be helpful in developing theories about the processes that underlie SWB judgments, and although these indicators can help validate self-report measures, they are not likely to supplant such measures in the near future.\n\nRecommendations and Conclusions for Measurement\n\nSeveral recommendations regarding the measurement of SWB are now possible. The first (and perhaps least controversial) is that many open questions remain regarding the associations among different SWB measures and the extent to which these measures map on to theoretical expectations; therefore, understanding how the measures relate and how they diverge will continue to be one of the most important goals of research in the area of SWB. Although different camps have emerged that advocate for one set of measures over others, we believe that such advocacy is premature. More research is needed about the strengths, weaknesses, and relative merits of the various approaches to measurement that we have documented in this review.\n\nSecond, because of this uncertainty about the associations among different types of measures, we recommend that, when possible, researchers should include a broad array of measures, including both judgment-focused measures like life satisfaction and more affective measures. If time and resources permit, both global, evaluative measures and more experiential measures can provide unique insights into the SWB of respondents, and thus, both should be considered. Relatedly, alternatives to self-report, including informant reports, cognitive or behavioral measures, and even psychophysiological measures may help address specific methodological concerns about more widely used self-report measures.\n\nFinally, although recent research suggests that context effects such as current mood or specific content that has been made salient rarely have strong effects on SWB judgments, it is wise to consider these potential effects and work to counteract them when possible. For instance, it is often easy enough to keep item order constant across administrations to prevent item-order effects, and many in cases it is possible to include SWB questions at or near the beginning of the survey to avoid any potential contamination effects. As is true with all research, it will likely be safer to ensure that all other conditions are as constant as possible as well, avoiding measuring some groups at times or in conditions that are unusual. And finally, research on the judgment processes that underlie well-being measures should focus less on documenting that problems exist and more on understanding the processes that underlie these effects. The understanding that such investigations would afford could allow researchers to design studies in such a way as to avoid the most pressing problems that exist.\n\nIn many ways, research into the psychometric properties of SWB measures is a model for other fields. Measurement issues are currently, and have long been, one of the most central topics of investigation in the field. Research on the reliability and validity of these measures takes a multi-pronged approach, ranging from traditional classical-test-theory-based strategies (e.g., Diener, Emmons, Larsen, & Griffin, 1985), to item-response theory (e.g., Oishi, 2006), to research into the processes underlying well-being judgments (e.g., Schimmack et al., 2002), and beyond. Various biases or artifacts in SWB measurement have been assessed (e.g., Diener, Sandvik, Pavot, & Gallagher, 1991; Diener, Suh, Smith, & Shao, 1995). A variety of procedures for correcting biases have been proposed, and numerous alternative measurement strategies (including momentary sampling, response-time measures, and physiological measures) have been investigated. To be sure, not all measurement issues have been solved, and additional issues remain to be investigated; but much is known about the measures and the evidence that exists provides an optimistic picture about the quality of measurement in the domain of SWB\n\nPredictors, Correlates, and Causes of SWB\n\nInitial attempts to understand SWB often focused on the objective characteristics that were associated with well-being judgments (see Diener, 1984; Diener et al., 1999; Wilson, 1967; for reviews). If SWB measures capture people’s evaluations of their lives, then presumably the objective features of those lives should predict the evaluations that people make. To be sure, even early well-being researchers acknowledged that people have diverse goals, values, and desires and that different people may perceive the same objective circumstances in different ways; this means that objective circumstances may not explain all the variance in well-being judgments. However, intuition suggests that certain objective circumstances, such as the income that people earn, the health that they have, or even their age, may play a role in how people feel about their lives. In this section, we briefly review the correlates of SWB, focusing first on objective characteristics such as demographic factors and external circumstances and then moving to internal characteristics such as personality traits. Our coverage is brief because earlier reviews have covered this work in considerable detail (e.g., Diener et al., 1999; Eid & Larsen, 2008), and we refer readers to more detailed reviews when possible.\n\nSocial Relationships\n\nOne consistent theme that has emerged in research on subjective well-being is that social relationships play an important role in people’s evaluations of their lives (Argyle, 1999; Myers, 1999). Thus, a central focus of research has been on the extent to which indicators of strong social relationships are associated with SWB. Specifically, considerable research has focused on the links between marital status and SWB, with two early meta-analyses showing consistent associations between the two (Haring-Hidore, Stock, Okun, & Witter, 1985; Wood, Rhodes, & Whelan, 1989).\n\nHowever, subsequent research has examined these associations more closely and at least some of the strong conclusions present in early work must be tempered. For instance, Lucas and Dyrenforth (2006) pointed out that although the association between marital status and SWB is robust, it is relatively small (e.g., a correlation of .14 in the Haring-Hidore et al., 1985 meta-analysis). In addition, research that uses prospective longitudinal data to examine trends in life satisfaction before and after marriage often shows that people quickly adapt to marriage, meaning that their long-term levels of life satisfaction following this event may be little different than they were before the event (Lucas, Clark, Georgellis, & Diener, 2004; Luhmann, Hofmann, Eid, & Lucas, 2012). It appears that at least some of the differences between married and unmarried people may be due to pre-existing differences between those who will get married and those who will not marry or who will get divorced (Lucas, 2005; Stutzer & Frey, 2006). It is important to note, however, that although life satisfaction levels are typically no different long after marriage than they were before marriage, some studies suggest that marriage may be protective against declines that would typically occur among similarly aged single individuals (Anusic, Yap, & Lucas, 2014a, 2014b; Helliwell & Grover, 2014; Yap, Anusic, & Lucas, 2012). Conclusions about the role that marriage plays are further complicated by the fact that the effects of marriage may vary across cultures or over time (e.g. Diener, Gohm, Suh, & Oishi, 2000; Glenn & Weaver, 1988; Lucas & Dyrenforth, 2006).\n\nFurthermore, the effects of marriage may not simply be the opposite of the effects of relationship dissolution, which complicates the interpretation of studies that compare people with many different marital statuses. For instance, research on the longitudinal changes that occur following widowhood is much clearer than research on the changes that occur around marriage: those who become widowed experience substantial declines in SWB, with some degree of slow rebound in the years following the event (Anusic et al., 2014a, 2014b; Lucas et al., 2003; Yap et al., 2012). Research on divorce suggests that happiness improves following divorce, though perhaps not to levels seen during the peak periods of marriage or before (Lucas, 2005; Luhmann et al., 2012). Finally, for most of these events, there are considerable individual differences in the types of changes that occur, and very little research has been conducted to clarify the factors that predict variability in these reactions.\n\nSocial relationship variables have typically been described as the strongest correlates of SWB (Argyle, 1999; Myers, 1999, 2000). These correlations, however, are often based on self-reports of relationship quality (Lucas & Dyrenforth, 2006), which can inflate correlations with self-reported measures of SWB. For instance, people who report that they have a strong network of close social relationships also report having higher levels of subjective well-being, but when more objective measures of the quality and quantity of social relationships are examined, these associations tend to be smaller (often with correlations around .10; see Lucas & Dyrenforth, 2006). It is possible that associations with objective measures are weaker simply because these objective measures do not adequately capture important variance in social relationships. However, it is also possible that correlations between subjective measures of relationship quality and reports of well-being are inflated by shared method variance or the influence of personality characteristics that lead to a broad positive outlook on life.\n\nIncome and Wealth\n\nPerhaps the most intuitive predictor of individual differences in SWB is income and other indicators of financial status. Income might be expected to have a wide-ranging effect on people’s ability to maximize their quality of life, precisely because income itself has the potential to affect so many other life circumstances. In addition to the obvious benefits for material possessions, income can allow people to purchase better health care, more interesting leisure experiences, and many other objective benefits in their lives. Given these intuitive links, it is not surprising that many studies have examined the association between material well-being and SWB. Reviews are available from Argyle and Furnham (1998), Diener and Biswas-Diener (2002), Diener and Oishi (2000), Ng (2013), Stevenson and Wolfers (2013), Weiman, Knabe, and Schob (2015), and Xiao (2014). Notably, more than for perhaps any other predictor, research on the association between income and SWB has relied on large and representative samples, and thus, correlations, which tend to fall in the range of .15 to .25 (Lucas & Schimmack, 2009), have been estimated with a great deal of precision.\n\nThe fact that income and SWB are associated is well-established and not controversial. Yet a number of important questions about the nature of this association remain. For instance, it is not yet clear whether people become satiated with material wealth once they reach a certain level of income. While some evidence supports this idea of declining marginal utility of income (e.g., Clark, Frijters, & Shields, 2008; Diener, Sandvik, Seidlitz, & Diener, 1993; Frey & Stutzer, 2002; Kahneman & Deaton, 2008; Mayraz, Layard, & Nickell, 2008), and perhaps even a decline in well-being among the wealthiest participants in a sample (Jebb, Tay, Diener, & Oishi, 2017), other research suggests that SWB levels continue to be associated with income even among the wealthiest nations or the wealthiest participants in a sample (e.g., Deaton, 2008; Sacks, Stevenson, & Wolfers, 2013; Stevenson & Wolfers, 2013). Part of the discrepancy comes from different treatments of income variables in analyses that are conducted: when raw income is analyzed, there is (as might be expected) relatively strong evidence for curvilinear effects, as the same absolute income is more weakly associated with SWB among higher income respondents than lower income respondents. In contrast, less evidence for satiation and curvilinear effects is found when the log of income is used, which, conceptually, tests whether the same proportional increase in income is associated with the same well-being benefits at all levels of income. Although this analytic issue can explain some of the discrepancies, even after analytic approaches are standardized results sometimes differ, and thus, debate continues about the existence of a satiation point for income and well-being.\n\nA second major debate concerns the extent to which economic growth is associated with increases in well-being within nations over time. In an influential article, Easterlin (1974) argued that although cross-sectional associations between income and SWB are clear (both within and between-countries), dramatic increases in income within nations over time have not led to a corresponding increase in SWB over time. Since the publication of this paper, many studies have investigated this “Easterlin Paradox,” and as with the issue of satiation-points, no resolution has been achieved. For instance, a number of researchers have used over-time cross-national analyses to suggest that economic growth is associated with increases in well-being (e.g., Diener, Kahneman, Tov, & Arora, 2010; Inglehart, Foa, Peterson, & Welzel, 2008; Hagerty & Veenhoven, 2003; Stevenson & Wolfers, 2008; Veenhoven & Hagerty, 2006). In a large and representative sample of nations and individuals, Diener, Tay, and Oishi (2013) found that rising income was associated with both positive affect and life satisfaction. However, there were many nations in which this did not occur because factors such as declining optimism or conflict seemed to swamp the effects of rising income. Thus, although rising national income on average is associated with rising levels of SWB, there are many exceptions. Oishi and Kesebir (2015) analyzed this issue using cross-temporal data from 34 nations. They found that an increase in GDP per capita was indeed associated with an increase in mean life satisfaction when it was not accompanied by growing income inequality during the study period (e.g., in France, Italy, Ireland, Finland, and Japan). In contrast, an increase in GDP per capita was not associated with an increase in mean life satisfaction when it was accompanied by growing income inequality during the study period (e.g., in Austria, Portugal, Belgium, and El Salvador). These findings suggest that it is not economic growth per se that increases residents’ life satisfaction; rather it is the fair distribution of the added national wealth that is critical in order for a nation’s life satisfaction to increase. Oishi and Kesebir concluded that: “Even growth is happy growth, and uneven growth is unhappy growth” (p. 1637). An important topic for future research is to determine how urbanization, changing levels of social capital, rising desires, and stress are associated with how economic growth influences SWB. As more and more high-quality data are obtained from many different nations over time, this question can be addressed more definitively.\n\nA third (and related) question concerns the extent to which the effects of income on SWB are relative or absolute. Brickman and Campbell (1971) hypothesized that people are stuck on a “hedonic treadmill” where they adapt to their current circumstances, which prevents any permanent increases in SWB. According to this perspective, changing conditions have only short-term effects on SWB because people inevitably adapt. A mathematical formulation of this theory was offered by Parducci (1995). Easterlin (1974) explained the previously mentioned “Easterlin Paradox” through these relative-income effects. He proposed that any effects of income result from people’s social comparisons. Research by Luttmer (2005) supports this idea. He showed that, controlling for a person’s own income, those living in poorer neighborhoods were actually happier than people living in richer neighborhoods, perhaps because of social comparison effects. Relatedly, Ferreri-i-Carbonell (2005) found that people’s reference groups’ income was associated with their own their life satisfaction and the negative association with the reference group was equivalent in size to the positive association with one’s own income. However, the reference effects were asymmetric. Those lower than their reference group in income had lower life satisfaction, but there was no boost for those above the reference group. Thus, social comparison might explain why rising income does not lead to increased happiness: As people’s income rise the average rises too, of course, and people on average are no more satisfied than before because they compare with a higher standard.\n\nIn contrast to this perspective, Veenhoven (1991) argued that the effects of income on SWB are absolute, not relative, because income is used to fulfill universal needs. Diener, Tay, and Oishi’s (2013) finding that both the poor and rich report higher SWB in rich countries compared to their counterparts in poor nations suggests that any broad social comparison effects are overridden by factors such as better health care, security, infrastructure, and so forth. Furthermore, in explicit tests of social comparison effects, Diener, Sandvik, Seidlitz, and Diener (1993) did not find significant effects for social comparisons on SWB, and this was replicated by Diener, Tay, and Oishi (2013). It is possible that both relative and absolute effects exist; suggestive evidence comes from a study by Diener, Ng, Harter, and Arora (2010), who reported that both fulfillment of basic needs and the ownership of conveniences such as televisions mediated the relationship between household income and life satisfaction.\n\nA related issue concerns the impact of income inequality on SWB. Given the increasing inequality in many societies in recent years, increased attention has been brought to the possible consequences of these changes. Diener and Oishi (2000) reported that across nations, income equality was not associated with higher SWB, but Oishi, Kesebir, and Diener (2011) did find such a relationship over time in the US. They found that the association between inequality and SWB was particularly strong for poorer respondents, and it was mediated by feelings of unfairness and distrust. Burkhauser, De Neve, and Powdthavee (2015) found that when the top one percent of individuals in terms of income earns a proportionately higher share, that the population life satisfaction declines and negative affect increases. Income inequality also might have very negative effects on happiness in societies where it is high and persistent (Graham, 2008). Alesina, Di Tella, and MacCulloch (2004) found that the SWB of the poor and political liberals more strongly associated with inequality than that of wealthier and conservative individuals, but this pattern was not found in the USA (see however, Napier & Jost, 2008). Relatedly, Cheung and Lucas (in press) found that social comparison effects of income are stronger when income inequality is high. It appears that the effects of objective income inequality may depend on factors such as whether people believe in income mobility in their nation, and whether they believe that inequality is unfair. Importantly, Zyphur, Sarafides, Tay, Connor, Diener, and Pierides (2016) found that greater income equality due to redistribution from government policies largely dampened the negative effects of market inequality on SWB.\n\nResearch on the association between income and SWB is typically motivated by an intuitive lay theory that high levels of income can be used to “buy” higher levels of happiness. In other words, the assumed causal direction goes from income to SWB. Of course, most of the research reviewed above is correlational in nature, and very little of it has features that allow for a sophisticated analysis of causal direction. Yet some research has been conducted that speaks to causality. In a classic (though over-interpreted) study, Brickman, Coates, and Janoff-Bulman (1978) used the occurrence of a relatively random event—a large lottery win—to examine the effects of income change on happiness. They reported that lottery winners were not significantly happier than a comparison group, and concluded that the increase in income did not cause a corresponding change in happiness. However, the study itself included fewer than two-dozen lottery winners, and other larger studies have found that lottery winners are higher in SWB than comparable lottery-ticket purchasers who did not win (Gardner, & Oswald, 2007; Smith & Razzell, 1975). Furthermore, in a longitudinal analysis, Gardner and Oswald (2002) found that SWB rose among those receiving substantial inheritances. These findings suggest that rising income can in fact raise SWB, even over relatively long periods.\n\nIn studies where people have received supplemental income in controlled experiments, the outcomes have been mixed. In the Negative Income Tax studies in the USA (Thoits & Hannan, 1979), participants reported lower SWB after receiving extra income. Haushofer and Shapiro (2015) studied unconditional cash transfers and found that people in a Kenyan village receiving an income supplement had higher SWB, including higher reports of happiness and life satisfaction and lower reports of stress and depression. These patterns were confirmed by reduced cortisol in the recipients, but only in households where females received the transfer. A year after the payments ended the effects on SWB were virtually gone. An unfortunate side-effect of the study is that the life satisfaction of the villagers not receiving payments declined (Haushofer, Reisinger, & Shapiro, 2015).\n\nAdditional cash transfer studies are being coordinated around the world. However, a note of caution is in order regarding the generalizability of the lottery studies and the cash transfer experiments. For one thing, it might be different in terms of feelings of self-esteem and mastery to passively receive money rather than to earn it. For another, people may encounter different issues such as envious neighbors and friends than is encountered when people earn income. Thus, although these studies are strong in terms of inferring causality, they raise questions regarding generalizability.\n\nA final issue that impacts research and theorizing on the links between income and SWB is that this association varies in different contexts. This suggests that there may be no single explanation for the association between the two variables. For example, income losses have a larger effect on SWB than income gains (Boyce, Wood, Banks, Clark, & Brown, 2013). Other research suggests that how people use the money that they have can impact happiness: spending money on others (Dunn, Aknin, & Norton, 2014) and spending money on experiences versus material goods (Dunn & Norton, 2013; Gilovich, Kumar, & Jampol, 2015) are both thought to enhance SWB. There is as of yet, however, only a small literature on how different forms of consumption are related to SWB (see, for example, Stanca & Veenhoven, 2015) and research has not invariably favored experiential over material spending. The line between the two is sometimes blurred, and in some cases material purchases may produce more frequent happiness over time (Nguyen, 2016; Weidman, 2016).\n\nAdditional research suggests that there are individual differences in the associations between income and SWB. Soto and Luhmann (2013) found that personality moderates the effects of income on SWB. For example, neurotic individuals react more strongly to their level of incomes and changes in their incomes. Cheung and Lucas (2015) found that age moderates the association, with middle aged participants showing stronger associations than older or younger participants (possibly because income may not be the best indicator of financial health among the young or the old). Social factors might also alter the influence of money on happiness. For example, Thoits and Hannan (1979) found that those whose incomes were increased in a negative income-tax experiment reported greater distress after the intervention, compared to those who did not receive the payments. Perhaps the money caused stress because neighbors reacted negatively. A parallel finding is that in the lottery winner studies researchers describe some people as losing their friends because of the lottery win, and this could be a negative side effect of winning (Smith & Razzell, 1975). Kahneman and Deaton (2010) uncovered another moderator in that negative life events such as illness and divorce have a much more negative impact on the poor than the rich. Thus, one’s income may interact with life events in terms of influencing SWB.\n\nDespite the complexities involved in the study of income and its association with SWB, several clear conclusions can be drawn, both in terms of what researchers already know and what debates will require more empirical evidence to resolve. First, the association between income and SWB is consistently positive in cross-sectional studies, with small to medium effect sizes within nations and large effect sizes when ecological correlations are examined (e.g., aggregated national income correlated with aggregated SWB). Second, it appears that income is more strongly associated with judgment-focused measures like life satisfaction than it is with more affective measures, though differences in the quality of the measures that are available cannot always be ruled out as an explanation of these differences. Third, although early reviews concluded that people quickly reach a satiation point beyond which increased income is as no longer associated with increased SWB, more recent research with large samples and sophisticated designs has challenged that conclusion; thus, more research is needed to determine whether such a satiation point really exists. Similarly, although considerable research has been conducted to determine whether the effects of income are relative or absolute, and although it seems likely that both types of effects play a role, more research is needed on the relative impact of absolute income and comparison standards. Future research is also needed to clarify whether people adapt to changes in income. Finally, research clearly shows that various factors, including the way that people use their income, along with various individual difference variables, moderate the association between income and SWB. A greater focus on these moderating factors will help clarify the processes that account for this complex and widely studied association.\n\nReligion and SWB\n\nAnother demographic characteristic that is frequently found to be associated with SWB is religiosity. Specifically, studies and reviews generally conclude that religious individuals have higher SWB than the nonreligious (Hackney & Sanders, 2003; Koenig & Larson, 2001). For example, Diener and Clifton (2002) found a small but significant association between religiosity and SWB in broad representative samples. Similarly, Tay, Li, Myers, and Diener (2014) examined the association in multiple large samples from the USA and other nations, and they found that religiosity was consistently associated with higher SWB. Like the association with income, research on religion and SWB has turned to understanding why the association exists and whether there are contextual factors that influence its strength or even direction. In addition, because the construct of religiosity itself is not as concrete or clear as income, some research focuses on whether distinct types of religiosity (e.g., religious beliefs versus religious behavior or specific religious affiliations) are differentially related to SWB.\n\nIn terms of process models, Pargament (2002) noted that there are many potential mediators of religiosity and SWB, including the social support that comes from belonging to a religious community, the sense of meaning that may come with some religious beliefs, and potential benefits from specific behaviors such as prayer or attendance at religious services. Ellison (1991) found that strong religious belief systems appeared to be directly associated with SWB, whereas religious attendance and private devotion appeared to be only indirectly related to SWB through strengthened religious beliefs. Similarly, Colon-Baco (2010) concluded that religious beliefs were a major factor in explaining religion’s association with SWB. However, recent work also raises the possibility that religion helps people in different circumstances for different reasons, and that the effects of religiosity vary by populations and conditions.\n\nRecent findings suggest that religion may only benefit some individuals, and only individuals living in certain circumstances. For example, Diener, Tay, and Myers (2011) found that religion was related to higher SWB across four major religions, but this effect was strong in nations with difficult circumstances such as widespread hunger and low life expectancy. They found that in wealthy nations, religious people did not have higher SWB than less religious people. Hoverd and Sibley (2013) replicated this finding in New Zealand, where they found that people living in deprived neighborhoods had higher SWB if they were religious, but in wealthier neighborhoods both groups were comparable and relatively high in SWB. Along the same lines, Zuckerman, Li, and Diener (2018) suggested that effective government might decrease the popularity of religion when it takes over certain functions such as security that religions have traditionally helped fulfill.\n\nDiener et al. (2011) found that in nations with difficult conditions religious people had higher SWB, and this difference may be due to greater social support, greater respect from others, and higher levels of purpose and meaning. A path model with these three mediators explained the association between religiosity and SWB for all three major types of SWB—life satisfaction, positive feelings, and low negative feelings. The direct paths from religiosity to SWB were small in this model, suggesting that the mediating variables of social support, respect, and meaning together explained most of the effects. In terms of the influence of being respected, Diener et al. found nonreligious people had much higher negative affect than religious individuals if they lived in a highly religious nation, but had lower negative affect if they lived in a nonreligious nation. Religious people in religious nations are respected and fit in, whereas nonreligious people may not be so readily accepted. Diener et al. suggested that this finding might explain why there are differences in religiosity among nations. For example, in Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, 99% of respondents reported that religion is an important part of their lives; in Denmark and Sweden fewer than 20% did so.\n\nConsistent with these ideas, Graham and Crown (2014) found that religion appears to serve different functions for different socioeconomic groups. They write that “the happiest are the most likely to seek social purpose in religion, the poorest are likely to seek social insurance in religion, and the least social are the most likely to seek social time in religion” (p. 1). Chang (2009) found in Taiwan that although religious attendance was associated with higher SWB, the pattern of associations was moderated by Christian versus Eastern religious traditions. Thus, it appears that religiosity is a frequent but not a universal predictor of higher SWB, and its effects and mediators depend to some degree on culture and the life circumstances of respondents.\n\nOther Demographic Factors\n\nAlthough considerable research has focused on social relationships, social scientists have also amassed a large amount of evidence about the extent to which other characteristics are linked with self-reported subjective well-being. For instance, much research has focused on trends in SWB over the lifespan. Although early reviews emphasized that there was not a strong association between the two (e.g., Diener et al., 1999), more recent research often finds a U-shaped pattern from early adulthood through the 60s and 70s (Blanchflower & Oswald, 2008), with happiness levels reaching a low sometime in the 40s. In very old age, life satisfaction again declines (Baird, Lucas, & Donnellan, 2010), and this decline is especially strong as one approaches death (Gerstorf, Ram, Rocke, Lindenberger, & Smith 2008). However, even the basic finding that life satisfaction shows a U-shaped trajectory over the lifespan is not without controversy. Although this pattern is often found when large-sample studies are used, this is not always the case. For instance, Steptoe, Deaton, and Stone (2015) found that in many countries around the world SWB declines linearly with age, and it is only in wealthy Western nations that the U-shaped curve is found. Furthermore, even in these countries, some studies fail to find the U-shaped curve (e.g., Baird et al., 2010). Thus, future research can clarify when and why this age-related pattern occurs.\n\nOther demographic characteristics also show relatively small associations with well-being. For instance, levels of education are typically not strongly associated with self-reported well-being (Michalos, 2008; Witter, Okun, Stock, & Haring, 1984). It is important to note, however, that most investigations into demographic predictors of subjective well-being focus exclusively on the individual-level associations (i.e., between a person’s own education and his or her own well-being). It is also possible to examine the links between population-level characteristics and well-being outcomes. Often, these associations differ depending on the level of analysis. For instance, Lawless and Lucas (2011) examined the predictors of county-level well-being in the United States. In contrast to results at the individual level, county-levels of educational attainment were one of the strongest predictors of aggregate life satisfaction across regions (with aggregate correlations in the range of .40 to .50). More and more studies are examining regional differences, and it is likely that new insights about the characteristics of happy communities will emerge from this work.\n\nConsistent with the small associations between education and SWB, sex differences in SWB are generally small (Diener et al., 1999; Geerling & Diener, 2017). The biggest sex differences tend to be found for affective measures rather than cognitive judgments of life satisfaction. For instance, Geerling and Diener found that 18% of men reported feeling sad the prior day, compared with 23% of women. As is true of many demographic predictors (especially those with small overall effects), the direction of this association may vary across contexts. For instance, Stevenson and Wolfers (2009) presented evidence that once small sex differences in life satisfaction in the United States have grown in recent years. Tesch-Romer, Motel-Klingebiel, and Tomasik (2008) found that the direction of sex differences depended on the nation. In countries with high support for gender equality, greater gender equality in the labor market was associated with smaller gender differences in SWB. In contrast, in nations where citizens did not support gender equality, greater labor market equality was associated with larger differences in SWB between men and women. Similarly, Zuckerman, Li, and Diener (2017) found that for life satisfaction and positive affect, sex differences were largest in nations where conditions had become moderately favorable for women. Sex differences were smaller in traditional societies and in nations where women have made the most progress. However, for negative affect, sex differences were largest in nations that had conditions that were most favorable to women. Thus, it appears that sex differences in SWB are not universal, are often small, and depend on the cultural values and conditions in societies.\n\nHealth\n\nOne life circumstance that might play a prominent role in subjective well-being is a person’s health. Various health conditions—both positive conditions such as physical strength and mobility and negative conditions such as physical disease or injury—have the potential to significantly impact the day-to-day lives of people who experience them. Initial research on the topic of health conditions often concluded that health played only a minor role in well-being judgments (Diener et al., 1999; Okun, Stock, Haring, & Witter, 1984). According to this early research, only self-reports of health were consistently associated with SWB, but this association diminished in size when more objective reports of health were used; suspicion about the value of self-reports often led to the conclusion that the moderate association when self-reports of both constructs were used might be artifactual. However, an alternative possibility is that the objective measures that are often used are simply not good indicators of a person’s overall health. For instance, if researchers ask respondents’ physicians to evaluate the respondents’ health, this measure would not be confounded with the respondents’ own biases and response styles. However, the physicians may not have complete information about all relevant health conditions or understand the impact of these conditions on the respondents’ overall perspective. Thus, it is possible that the discrepancy between relatively “objective” and more subjective measures of health is at least in part due to the possibility that the former may be less valid.\n\nIn addition, it has become clear that the link between health conditions and well-being outcomes is stronger than once thought. For instance, literature reviews often mention the Brickman, Coates, and Janoff-Bulman (1978) study in which patients with spinal cord injuries were compared to lottery winners and a group of controls. The surprising finding from this study—one that seemed to suggest a limited impact of health conditions—was that, according to the authors, the three groups barely differed in their levels of SWB. However, this conclusion was somewhat impressionistic, and by actually calculating effect sizes, Lucas (2007) showed that that the differences between the spinal-cord-injured group and the other two were substantial (with standardized mean differences around .80). Furthermore, other studies have shown that disabling conditions—especially those that are more severe or those that have a strong effect on mobility—are associated with relatively large decrements in SWB (again, see Lucas, 2007, for a discussion and evidence from longitudinal studies). Studies that examine a broader range of health conditions in large, representative samples also show that specific health conditions are associated with the subjective well-being of those who experience them (Steptoe, Deaton, & Stone, 2015). For example, Wikman, Wardle, and Steptoe (2011) found that stroke lowered SWB more than did cancer. Thus, although early reviews often downplayed the role of health in SWB judgments, it has become clear that health conditions can have a major impact on the well-being that people report.\n\nSummary\n\nThe overview presented above shows that considerable research has been conducted that examines the correlation between various components of SWB and a wide range of demographic factors and life circumstances. This research benefits from the fact that many large-scale and wide-ranging surveys include measures of SWB, which means that high quality data are available, and these data can provide an initial picture of who does and does not report high levels of SWB. The evidence reviewed above suggests that high SWB is consistently associated with high levels of income, strong social relationships, and—at least in some contexts—with high levels of religiosity. At the same time, other intuitive predictors of SWB, including gender and education, appear to be less predictive. One limitation of the existing research, and one limitation of our review, however, is that few up-to-date meta-analyses that use modern techniques for addressing publication bias have been conducted to clarify precisely how strong these associations are and how robust the mediators we discussed above really are. Thus, we hope that researchers will take our narrative summary as impetus to conduct comprehensive but targeted meta-analyses of these results.\n\nCulture\n\nThe first three Psychological Bulletin reviews of the SWB literature (Diener, 1984; Diener et al., 1999; Wilson, 1967) paid scant attention to culture. In many ways, this was a critical omission for the field: If a cardinal feature of SWB is that the factors that predict it should vary depending on people’s goals, values, and preferences, the culture should play a major role in SWB, as culture is strongly linked to these goals, values, and preferences. Unfortunately, at the time of these early reviews, few studies had systematically examined the impact that cultural differences have on the predictors of SWB. In contrast, over the last 20 years, cultural differences have become a major focus of research, and considerable research has tackled this important topic. Below, we review the key issues and findings on culture and its links with SWB.\n\nDiffering Conceptions of SWB\n\nAlthough SWB can be defined in relatively simple and straightforward terms, legitimate concerns can be raised about the extent to which the construct itself and its predictors differ across cultures. As noted above, summarizes various definitions of SWB. Even when a relevant term such as happiness is clearly defined, it is worth exploring whether the term used in similar ways across cultures and time (see Oishi & Gilbert, 2016; Uchida & Oishi, 2016, for recent reviews on culture and SWB). Most philosophers and historians agree that the concept of happiness has changed over the years. In antiquity, this concept centered around good luck and fortune, whereas contemporary Americans view happiness as a pleasant experience over which they have control and something that they can actively pursue (Kesebir & Diener, 2008; McMahon, 2006; Oishi, 2012). In short, in ancient Greece happiness was deemed as something beyond human control, determined mostly by luck and the gods. An analysis of historical changes in the dictionary definition of happiness in American English (Webster’s unabridged dictionary) also showed that the early definitions of happiness included the concepts of luck, fortune, or fate (Oishi, Graham, Kesebir, & Galinha, 2013), whereas over time, this usage was deemed archaic. Oishi et al. also collected dictionary definitions of happiness from 30 countries, and found that good luck or fortune was at least partially evident in 24 nations’ definition of happiness (80%). Luck or fortune was completely absent in the U.S., Spain, Argentina, Ecuador, India, and Kenya.\n\nThe prominence of the good fortune definition indicates that the original concept of happiness in American English was very similar to the Greek (eudaimon), German (Glück), French (Bonheur), Chinese (福), and Japanese (幸福) ones. Over time, however, the concept of happiness as something one can pursue gained ascendancy in the U.S. Interestingly, people living in the nation where happiness is not defined as good luck and fortune reported higher levels of happiness than those living in the nation where happiness is defined as good luck and fortune. This suggests that happiness can be pursued and attained to some extent in cultures where happiness is defined as a pleasurable experience.\n\nSimilar to the dictionary analysis above, studies have often found that the content of free associations about happiness differs across cultures. For instance, Lu (2001) found that Americans often mentioned personal achievement and an intense positive emotion (e.g., excitement), whereas Chinese often mentioned spiritual enrichment, harmony, and dialectic relation between happiness and unhappiness (see Schimmack, Oishi, & Diener, 2002 for a large cross-cultural study on this topic). Uchida and Kitayama’s (2009) free association study related to the terms happiness and unhappiness also showed similar differences between Japanese and Americans. Likewise, a content analysis of children’s books showed that American picture books had more characters with a wide smile than Taiwanese picture books (Tsai, Louie, Chen, & Uchida, 2007), suggesting that American concept of positive emotion is more intense than Taiwanese.\n\nA text analysis of Christian and Buddhist classics also revealed the qualitative difference in positive affect (Tsai, Miao, & Seppala, 2007). In Christian texts, high activation positive affect terms such as “rejoice,” “glory,” and “proud” were often mentioned. In contrast, in Buddhist texts, low activation positive affect terms such as “serene,” “calm,” and “peace” were more frequently used. These findings suggest that ideal positive emotional states differ across religions. Consistent with the difference in ideal positive emotions, Christians reported feeling pride more frequently than Buddhists (Kim-Prieto & Diener, 2009). Interestingly, Christian ideals also appear to be different across cultures. For instance, when asked to free associate about Jesus, the majority of Americans mention only positive words such as “benevolence” “awesome” and “excellence,” whereas many Koreans (the majority of Korean participants were Christians) mentioned “suffering,” “sacrifice,” and “pain,” as well as positive words (Oishi, Seol, Koo, & Miao, 2011). Not surprisingly, then, when asked to rate how happy Jesus was, Americans rated Jesus to be happier than Koreans. Consistent with previous research, Americans also reported being more satisfied with their own lives than Koreans, and this difference was partially explained by the differential image of Jesus. Thus, concepts of happiness and ideal positive emotional states seem to be intertwined with actual emotional experiences as well.\n\nMeasurement Equivalence Across Cultures\n\nConsidering the fact that the concept of happiness differs across time and societies, it is not surprising that some items function differently across cultures. For instance, Item Response Theory (IRT) analysis of the Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS, Diener, Emmons, Larsen, & Griffin, 1985) showed that the item that assesses external conditions (“The conditions of my life are excellent”) functioned very similarly between Chinese and Americans, whereas the items that assess the attainment of goals (“So far I have gotten the important things I want in my life”) and affirmation of one’s life (“If I could live my life over, I would change almost nothing”) showed a large difference (Oishi, 2006). Similarly, IRT analysis of the PANAS (Watson et al., 1988) showed that most items functioned differently between Chinese and Americans. “Pride” in particular functioned completely differently between Chinese and Americans (Oishi, 2007; see also Scollon, Diener, Oishi, & Biswas-Diener, 2004). It should be noted, however, that when there is at least one equivalent item, it is possible to “link” and compare two samples by weighing the equivalent item(s) heavier than the nonequivalent items in scoring. In the case of the SWLS, the IRT scoring changed the mean difference between Chinese and Americans from the traditional scoring of taking the sum, going from Cohen’s d from 1.18 to .71.\n\nA similar finding is reported when comparing Americans and Danish’ positive affect; the IRT scoring reduced the mean difference slightly (Biswas-Diener, Vitterso, & Diener, 2010). Interestingly, however, Greenlanders and Norwegians were not different in the mean score of the SWLS when the traditional scoring method was used, whereas Norwegians scored higher than Greenlanders when the IRT scoring method was used (Vitterso, Biswas-Diener, & Diener, 2005). An inspection of Vitterso et al.’s data indicates that this was perhaps due to the fact that the majority of Greenlanders (80.9%) belonged to the latent class in which respondents either randomly responded or used only extreme response categories. At this point, there are few studies that utilized IRT in testing measurement equivalence of SWB scales. IRT and related methods should be used in testing measurement equivalence of SWB in various nations, as they also bring to light important cultural similarities and differences in the concept of SWB.\n\nAn encouraging cross-cultural measurement finding comes from Scollon, Diener, Oishi, and Biswas-Diener (2004), who found that three different measurement methods led to similar relative ordering of five cultures on the mean levels of emotional well-being. However, Scollon, Diener, Oishi, and Diswas-Diener (2005) did find some cultural differences in factor structures of pleasant affect such that pride loaded on the unpleasant affect factor among Japanese and Asian American samples. In addition, Diener, Scollon, Oishi, Dzokoto, and Suh (2000) found a tendency for general positivity in some cultures more than in others, a tendency to rate broad and abstract items higher than narrow and concrete items. The positivity effect was large in Latin cultures and small in Confucian cultures. Using self and informant reports and structural equation model, Kim, Schimmack, and Oishi (2012) showed that European Canadians are more positive than Asian Canadians about the self and others, and this difference in positivity explained the mean difference in self-reported life satisfaction between European and Asian Canadians. More research like Kim et al. is needed to untangle when general positivity or negativity influence SWB scores.\n\nCulture Mean-Level Differences in SWB\n\nA number of studies have examined differences between cultures in SWB. Researchers have found strong differences in life satisfaction between nations, for example, that differ in economic development (e.g., Diener, Kahneman, Tov, & Arora, 2010). A number of studies have found that European and Latin cultures tend to have higher SWB than Pacific-Rim Confucian cultures, especially after income is taken into account (e.g., Diener & Oishi, 2004; Tov & Diener, 2007). One possible reason for lower reported SWB in the Confucian cultures is that there might be less positivity bias there. However, Suh (2007) hypothesized that the low SWB scores in Confucian collectivistic cultures might be due to the context-sensitive nature of self-esteem in them. He suggested that people who are very sensitive to the evaluations of others can be at risk because they do not pursue intrinsically rewarding activities and because they can be quite reactive to the negative evaluations of others.\n\nCulture-Dependent Predictors of SWB\n\nSeveral large international studies found cultural variations in predictors of SWB. A 31-nation college student data set revealed, for instance, that satisfaction with the self was a stronger predictor of life satisfaction in individualist nations such as the U.S. and New Zealand than in collectivist nations such as Bangladesh, Egypt, and Japan (Diener & Diener, 1995). This finding replicated in another large cross-cultural survey from 39 nations (Oishi, Diener, Lucas, & Suh, 1999). Whereas self-esteem was a stronger predictor of life satisfaction in individualist nations than in collectivist nations, several studies showed that emotional support and relationship harmony were predictors of life satisfaction above and beyond self-esteem in Hong Kong (Kwan, Bond, & Singelis, 1997) and Japan (Uchida, Kitayama, Mesquita, Reyes, & Morling, 2008), but not in the U.S. (see Pethtel & Chen, 2010, for similar findings in China). Recent studies clarified one reason for these cross-cultural variations. The relative importance of self-esteem as a predictor of life satisfaction was explained by relational mobility, or the degree to which there are opportunities to acquire new, desirable relationships and sever old, undesirable relationships (Yuki, Sato, Takemura, & Oishi, 2013). Consistent with the previous studies, self-esteem was a stronger predictor of life satisfaction among Americans than among Japanese. This cultural difference was explained by the difference in relational mobility. Americans perceived their environment to be more relationally mobile than Japanese. In a relationally fluid society self-esteem is a more important indicator of life satisfaction than in a relationally fixed society.\n\nEmotional experience is a core aspect of the private self (Baumeister, 1987). Thus, emotional experiences might be more strongly associated with the evaluation of one’s life in societies where the private perspective as opposed to the public perspective is prized. In a large international survey study, scientists indeed showed that the frequency of positive emotion was a better predictor of life satisfaction among individualist nations than among collectivist nations (Suh, Diener, Oishi, & Triandis, 1998; see also Kuppens, Realo, & Diener, 2008; Schimmack, Radhakrishnan, Oishi, Dzokoto, & Ahadi, 2002). Among positive emotions, various studies also showed that pride is a stronger predictor of happiness among Americans, whereas interpersonal positive emotions such as friendly feelings are stronger predictors of happiness among Japanese (e.g., Kitayama, Markus, & Kurokawa, 2000; Kitayama, Mesquita, & Karasawa, 2006). In a daily diary study, self-esteem predicted overall pleasantness of emotional experiences among Americans, whereas social distance and reputation (face loss) concerns were more predictive among Japanese (Mesquita & Karasawa, 2002). Interestingly, Kitayama, Ishii, Imada, Takemura, and Ramaswamy (2006) replicated the earlier fining that pride was not a strong predictor of happiness among Japanese in Kyoto, but found that pride was a strong predictor of happiness among Japanese who grew up in Hokkaido. Hokkaido was a frontier in the late 1800s, where many Japanese soldiers moved. Kitayama et al. argued that Hokkaido Japanese are culturally similar to Americans because they were descendants of pioneers. Combined with Yuki et al. (2013) these findings suggest that the previously observed Japan-US difference in positive emotions (e.g., pride vs. friendly feelings) could be due to historical differences in migration patterns. The U.S. is a nation of immigrants with a frontier spirit (Kitayama, Ishii et al., 2006) and willingness to move (Oishi, 2010), whereas Japan is a nation of relatively few immigrants and migrants (with the exception of Hokkaido), and a largely residentially stable population.\n\nPerson-Culture Fit\n\nThere are two lines of thought about the extent to which person-culture fit influences SWB. One possibility is that certain characteristics are universally associated with higher levels of SWB, whereas a second is that the specific factors that predict well-being vary depending on culture. For instance, self-determination theorists have long argued that individuals who pursue goals for intrinsic reasons are happier than those who do not (Ryan & Deci, 2001; Sheldon, Ryan, Deci, & Kasser, 2004). However, Oishi and Diener (2001) found that Japanese who became more satisfied with their lives over time were those who attained the goals they pursued to please their parents, whereas Americans who became more satisfied with their lives over time were those who attained the goals they pursued for fun and enjoyment. According to the self-determination theorists, these findings do not pose a threat to the universalist claims because these Japanese participants might have pursued goals to please parents for intrinsic or internalized reasons (Sheldon et al., 2004). Thus, the self-determination theory of SWB is at the abstract level of generality: it is not about the self (e.g., self-esteem, pride) versus others (e.g., emotional support, parental approval). Instead, the theory is concerned with the reasons for an action being intrinsic (fun and enjoyment) and internalized reasons (personally important) versus introjected (feel ashamed and guilty otherwise) and external (someone else wants you to do it).\n\nSimilar to the self-determination theorists (Ryan & Deci, 2001; Sheldon et al., 2004), Suh (2007) also proposed a universalist theory of SWB. He suggested that East Asians are on average not as satisfied with their lives as North Americans because East Asians are especially concerned about how others view them. This is a sharp contrast to the person-culture fit theory (e.g., Markus & Kitayama, 2000; Oishi, 2000), which predicts that East Asians who are relationship-oriented are more satisfied with their lives than East Asians who are not. According to Suh, East Asians who are relationally-oriented are no more satisfied with their lives than East Asians who are not.\n\nThere is no clear support for one theory over the other. Instead, there seems to be partial support for both. For instance, consistent with Suh’s (2007) theory, a 39-nation study found that horizontal individualism (e.g., “I enjoy being unique and different from others in many ways”) was generally positively associated with life satisfaction, while vertical collectivism (“I would do what would please my family, even if I detested that activity”) was generally negatively associated with life satisfaction (Oishi, 2000). At the same time, however, consistent with the person-culture fit theory, the degree to which horizontal individualism was associated with life satisfaction was stronger in individualist nations than in collectivist nations (Oishi, 2000). Likewise, a 26-nation study found, consistent with the universalist theory, that extraversion was positively associated with life satisfaction in most nations (Fulmer et al., 2010). However, consistent with the person-culture fit theory, the degree to which extraversion was associated with life satisfaction was stronger in nations where nation-level extraversion (assessed as observer rating) was higher.\n\nIn a nine-nation study, Fulmer et al. found that promotion focus was in general positively associated with self-esteem, but it was more strongly associated with self-esteem in nations where nation-level promotion focus was higher. Likewise, in a large international dataset, Diener, Tay, and Myers (2011) found that religiosity was in general positively associated with SWB. However, the degree to which religiosity was associated with SWB was significantly higher in poor, generally more religious nations than in wealthy, secular nations (see also Li & Bond, 2010). Research by Stavrova and her colleagues suggests that cultural norms exert an influence, affecting the life satisfaction of individuals who conform or do not conform to the norms. For example, in nations where civic virtue is valued, those with this characteristic have higher life satisfaction than those low on it (Stavrova, Schlosser, & Fetchenhauer, 2013), whereas there is no association in nations where the virtue is not highly valued.\n\nIn addition to the person-culture fit studies, there are studies reporting a person-community fit effect on SWB as well. For example, a large internet study in the greater London area (Jokela et al., 2015) found that residents who are high in openness to experiences were more satisfied with their lives if they live in urban areas (where there is more demographic diversity, as well as arts) than those living in the outskirts of the city. Likewise, Republicans are more satisfied with their lives if they live in a Republican district than a Democratic district, whereas liberals are more satisfied with their lives if they live in a Democratic district (Motyl & Oishi, 2016). Furthermore, the person-environment fit effect was explained by sense of belonging. That is, those who live in the area where their personal political ideology matches with the dominant ideology of the community felt more sense of belonging than those who live in the mismatched area. Furthermore, those who live in a mismatched area were more likely to move to an area where their personal ideology matches with the dominant ideology (Motyl, Iyer, Oishi, Trawalter, & Nosek, 2014). In short, the person-culture fit effect on SWB is in part due to sense of belonging. The misfit is likely to induce a sense of alienation, which is detrimental to one’s SWB. At the level of nations, however, there are many sub-cultures and communities where diverse types of values and personalities are allowed (e.g., pious Muslims in China), and many people are often able to find their own niche. That might partly explain why the person-culture fit effect tends to be small, even when statistically significant.\n\nTogether the studies reviewed above show that culture does matter for interpreting research on SWB. Definitions of SWB may vary across cultures, predictors of well-being likely do vary, and together, these sets of findings provide a more nuanced picture of the processes that underlie individual and group differences in the components of SWB. Our review also shows that considerable work is left to be done on the cultural factors that influence SWB. Research using sophisticated methods is needed to clarify the extent to which different definitions or psychometric properties are responsible for observed differences in means and predictors across correlations; and further development regarding theories of cross-cultural differences will be needed to characterize all of the differences that have been found.\n\nPsychological Processes and Theories of SWB\n\nEach of the prior sections presents descriptive findings regarding the predictors of and group-level differences in SWB that have been found. Of course, these descriptive findings provide suggestive evidence regarding the processes that underlie well-being. However, much research has also tackled these process models more specifically. In the next section, we provide a brief overview of the broad range of process models that have been proposed to explain individual and group-level differences in SWB.\n\nPersonality and Genes\n\nIn contrast to the descriptive research on the correlates of SWB, theories that have been developed to explain individual differences in this construct emphasize the psychological processes that result in high or low SWB. One major class of process-level models focuses on the links between personality and SWB judgments (for reviews, see DeNeve & Cooper, 1998; Diener & Lucas, 1999; Lucas & Diener, 2008; Steel, Schmidt, & Shultz, 2008). The role of personality is supported by at least four pieces of evidence. First, as noted in the section on the external correlates, many objective life circumstances correlate only modestly with subjective judgments of subjective well-being. Even after accounting for these external circumstances, there are considerable individual differences in SWB, individual differences that might be accounted for by personality. Second, many studies show that SWB is moderately heritable (Roysamb, Nes, & Vitterso, 2014). Separated twins who grow up in different households have similar levels of SWB (e.g., Lykken & Tellegen, 1996), suggesting that something about their inborn personality has played a role in the well-being they report. Third, SWB is moderately stable, even over very long periods. Again, views about how stable it is have evolved over time. Short-term stability studies suggest that SWB is very stable; but evidence from long-running panel studies suggests that long-term change sometimes does occur (Fujita & Diener, 2005; Lucas & Donnellan, 2007, 2"
