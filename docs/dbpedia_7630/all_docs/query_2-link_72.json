        "meta_description": "In contrast to the preceding chapters, this concluding chapter explores the ways in which IR theory has shaped our image of Germany. It makes the case for an iterative feedback process among country images and theory. On the basis of a quantitative analysis of leading IR works from the 1940s to the present day, it shows that in the post-war era, Germany has been the most frequent national role model for theorists and that Germany has been used in diverse ways by different paradigms. Germanyâ€™s central but changing role in world and European affairs, and the disciplinary prestige of emigre scholars explain the high scholarly interest in the country. Conditions have changed and theoretical interest in Germany has begun to decline.",
