        "text": "The transition to parenting is a challenging milestone, especially for those who undergo this experience at an early age (Wakschlag & Hans, 2000). Compared to non-parenting adolescents, adolescent mothers are more likely to come from lower socioeconomic status (SES) backgrounds and have poorer academic performance (Hoffman & Maynard, 2008). They are also more likely than adult mothers to live in poverty and experience numerous stressful life events (Hoffman & Maynard, 2008). These psychosocial risks contribute to adjustment difficulties in young mothers (Mollborn & Morningstar, 2009). In particular, they experience high levels of depressive symptoms and parenting stress (i.e., stress that results from the demands of being a parent; Abidin, 1992) during the postpartum years (Zeiders, Umaña-Taylor, Updegraff, & Jahromi, 2015; Whitman, Borkowski, Keogh, & Weed, 2001; Reid & Meadows-Oliver, 2007). Notably, Latina adolescents have a substantially higher birthrate than that of any other group in the United States (U.S.; Martin, Hamilton, Osterman, Curtin, & Mathews, 2013), making it especially important to uncover factors that may facilitate their adjustment despite their disadvantaged conditions.\n\nThe general goal of the current study was to investigate developmentally- and culturally- salient factors that can promote the psychological and parenting adjustment of young Latina mothers. Specifically, using a risk and resilience framework (Rutter, 1987), which highlights the importance of the interplay between specific risks and resources that can protect an individual’s adjustment, we examined perceived social support (i.e., social resources that persons perceive to be available to them; Sarason, Sarason, & Pierce, 1990) as a protective factor for the young mothers’ adjustment. The perception of availability of support during stressful situations is thought to reduce stress, enhance psychological well-being, and facilitate adjustment, especially among those parenting under disadvantaged conditions (Thompson, Flood, & Goodwin, 2006; Sarason et al., 1990). We focused on perceived support from romantic partners, a developmentally salient source of support for young mothers. Starting in adolescence, individuals place increasing importance on romantic relationships, and these relationships have strong implications for psychological well-being (Cauce, Mason, Gonzales, Hiraga, & Liu, 1996; Furman & Shaffer, 2003). Moreover, research with adult mothers indicates that partner support is especially protective for adjustment during the postnatal period (Tanner Stapleton et al., 2012).\n\nPartners are also a culturally-salient source of support for young Latina mothers. A relatively large percentage of Latina mothers, and immigrant/Spanish-speaking mothers in particular, are involved in long-term partner relationships during the postpartum years (Contreras, López, Rivera-Mosquera, Raymond-Smith, & Rothstein, 1999; Moore, Florsheim, & Butner, 2007; Reynoso, Felice, & Shragg, 1993; Wasserman, Brunelli, Rauh, & Alvarado, 1994). For example, among mothers participating in the National Early Head Start Research and Evaluation Project when their children were 14 months old, 32% of Latina mothers, 41% of the European American (EA) mothers, and 7% of the African American (AA) mothers were cohabiting with their partners (Eshbaugh, 2006). In a sample of young mothers of predominantly Puerto Rican origin, 52% of the mothers cohabited with a partner Contreras, 2004).\n\nThese relatively high rates for Latina mothers are consistent with familism, a belief system that defines the family as the preeminent socialization agent and emphasizes the importance of solidarity, interdependence, and readily available support within the family group (Cauce & Domenech-Rodriguez, 2002). Early marriages have been historically common in Latin American countries, and in the case of early or unplanned pregnancies, cultural traditions encourage fathers to assume their parental and family responsibilities (Cauce & Domenech-Rodriguez, 2002; García-Coll & Vazquez-Garcia, 1996). Research with adult Latino fathers indicates that fathers who endorse more traditional Latino values demonstrate higher levels of involvement and commitment to their families (Cruz et al., 2011; Glass & Owen, 2010). Latino traditions also place high value on childbearing and the formation of a new family unit, and traditional gender roles emphasize the woman’s role as mother and wife (Cauce & Domenech-Rodriguez, 2002). Consistently, Latina adolescents report more positive attitudes and intentions regarding pregnancy than their non-Latina peers (Abma, Martinez, & Dawson, 2004). There is also some indication that these values influence Latino adolescents’ romantic relationship preferences and choices (Flores, Eyre, & Millstein, 1998; Halgunseth, 2004). Thus, partners represent a developmentally- and culturally-salient source of support for young Latina mothers.\n\nGiven that young mothers are less cognitively and emotionally prepared to parent (Contreras, Narang, Ikhlas, & Teichman, 2002; Whitman et al., 2001) and must do so in a disadvantaged context (Hoffman & Maynard, 2008), support from partners may be especially effective in facilitating the young mothers’ adjustment. Gaining a better understanding of the role of these relationships has clear implications for tailoring prevention efforts that can meet the needs and characteristics of these young mothers. However, little research provides insight into these relationships or whether mothers benefit from the support they may perceive from their partners. Thus, we examined whether perceived partner support played a unique role in facilitating the mothers’ adjustment. In addition, given that cultural values influence expectations regarding family and romantic relationships, and the support that is exchanged within these relationships (Campos, Rojas Perez, & Guardino, 2014; Flores, et al., 1998; Uchida, Kitayama, Mesquita, Reyes, & Morling, 2008), we tested whether the associations between perceived partner support and adjustment varied as a function of the strength of the mothers’ Latino cultural orientation (i.e., degree to which they endorse values and behaviors of the Latino culture; Cuellar, Arnold, & Maldonado, 1995).\n\nSocial Support and Maternal Psychological Adjustment\n\nConsistent with theories of social support (Sarason et al., 1990), research on overall perceived support has generally documented positive relations with the adjustment of young mothers (Grau, Wilson, Weller, Castellanos, & Duran, 2012). For example, larger supportive social networks are related to less depressive symptomatology, greater life satisfaction, and affectively positive and sensitive parenting across ethnic groups (Brown, Harris, Woods, Buman, & Cox, 2012, Contreras, Mangelsdorf, Rhodes, Diener, & Brunson, 1999; Cox et al., 2008).\n\nRomantic relationships, partner support, and adjustment\n\nThe role of support from partners is less clear than the one for overall support. Prior studies focused primarily on EA and AA adolescent mothers and yielded mixed results. Several found partner support was related to better psychological functioning (Edwards, Isarowong, Shiu, Hensin, & Hans, 2012; Gee & Rhodes, 1999; Laghi, Baumgartner, Riccio, Bohr, & Dhayanandhan, 2013). For instance, in samples of AA mothers, perceived partner support was related to lower depressive symptoms (Edwards et al., 2012) and psychological distress, and higher self-esteem (Thompson & Pebbles-Wilkins, 1992). Other studies reported negative or no relations to adjustment (Gee & Rhodes, 2003; Shapiro & Mangelsdorf, 1994; Voight, Hans, & Bernstein, 1996). For example among EA mothers partner support was related to lower parenting skills (Shapiro & Mangersdorf, 1994). Finally, studies have also shown that partners are often a source of conflict and disappointment, which is associated with adjustment difficulties (Gee & Rhodes, 1999).\n\nA few studies examined this relation in samples with representation of Latina mothers. In samples of AA and Caribbean-origin adolescents, maternal report of partner financial support was related to fewer depressive symptoms (Leadbeater & Linares, 1992), and father social support was related to lower levels of power–assertive childrearing attitudes (Brunelli et al., 1995). In a sample of AA and Latina adolescents, maternal report of the quality of their romantic relationship with the child’ father during pregnancy did not predict parenting adjustment (i.e., abuse potential, parenting behaviors), however, decreases in perceived quality across the transition to parenting were associated with higher levels of parenting stress (Florsheim & Smith, 2005; Florsheim, et al., 2003). Satisfaction with father involvement was related to fewer depressive symptoms, but was un-related to parenting stress in another sample of AA and Latina mothers (Fagan & Lee, 2010).\n\nFindings from purely Latino samples have also been mixed. Among Latina adolescent mothers of primarily Puerto Rican origin, greater perceived partner support related to fewer psychological symptoms but not to parenting stress (Contreras, Lopez et al., 1999). In another study based on this same sample, great partner social support was related to the display of less negative affect during mother-child interactions (Contreras, 2004). In a sample of Latina adolescents from different countries of origin, mothers who reported higher levels of partner support displayed less maternal sensitivity; partner support was not related to maternal expressivity (Contreras, Mangelsdorf, et al., 1999). Finally, among Mexican-origin adolescent mothers, perceived support from a significant other was related to higher parenting self-efficacy (Umaña-Taylor, Guimond, Updegrapff, & Jahromi, 2013). In sum, the sparse literature provides some indication that partner support may be protective for young Latina mothers’ psychological adjustment; how it relates to their parenting adjustment is less clear.\n\nThe Role of Latino Cultural Orientation\n\nCultural orientation influences expectations regarding family and romantic relationships and the support that is exchanged within these relationships (Campos et al., 2014; Flores, et al., 1998; Uchida et al., 2008). In the case of the Latino culture, where support from a partner is culturally sanctioned, expected, and valued by mothers (Cauce & Domenech-Rodriguez, 2002), young mothers may be better able to benefit from perceived partner support. Thus, in addition to testing whether perceived partner support was directly associated with adjustment, we examined whether variations in the mothers’ endorsement of a Latino cultural orientation influenced how support related to adjustment.\n\nAlthough the literature on adolescent mothers has not examined this effect, the adult literature offers some support for this prediction. Among adult Latina mothers, perceived social support during pregnancy related to more favorable birth outcomes among foreign-born mothers (proxy for a stronger Latino cultural orientation), but it was not related among U.S.-born mothers. These results suggest that foreign-born mothers were better able to benefit from the support they perceived from their close relationships than U.S.-born mothers (Campos et al., 2008). More generally, a growing literature provides support for the role of culture as moderator of links between various support processes (e.g., provision, perceived support) and adjustment (Barnett, Mortensen, Tilley, & Gonzalez, 2013; Kim, Sherman, & Taylor, 2008; Kitayama, Duffy, & Uchida, 2007; Uchida et al., 2008). Drawing from an independence-interdependence theory of cultural self, Kitayama and colleagues (2007) showed cultural differences in the extent to which individuals benefit from perceived support. For instance, Uchida and collaborators (2008) demonstrated a stronger and direct link between perceived support and well-being among Asian (interdependent culture) than among EA (independent culture) adolescents and adults.\n\nOverview of the Study\n\nIn sum, the goals of this study were twofold. First, given that little is known about the partner relationships of young Latina mothers, we provide descriptive information on these relationships and contextualize this information by examining how the strength of the mothers’ orientation toward the Latino culture related to these characteristics. Given previous findings, we expected that mothers with a stronger Latino cultural orientation would be more likely to be in longer-term and more established relationships (e.g., married, co-residing with partner) than those who reported less engagement with Latino culture.\n\nSecond, the more central goal was to test whether perceived partner support was positively associated with the young mother’s adjustment. We focused on perceived rather than actual social support, as it is a stronger predictor of well-being (Thompson et al., 2006), and assessed adjustment through mothers’ reports of depressive symptoms and parenting stress. These two domains of adjustment are central for mothers’ and children’s adaptation during the first years postpartum (Crnic, & Low, 2002; Goodman et al., 2010), and adolescent mothers are at heightened risk for experiencing these difficulties (Mollborn & Morningstar, 2009). Given that children of adolescent mothers begin to show deficits during the second year of life, and these deficits are related to changes in maternal behavior (Whitman et al., 2001), we studied mothers’ adjustment during the second year postpartum. Examining families beyond the transition to parenting also allowed us to capture relatively established patterns of partner relationships and support provision. Given the wide range of needs and stressors young, low-income mothers face, we examined availability of support across several basic support types that have been commonly studied in the literature (e.g., emotional, tangible; Gee & Rhodes, 2007).\n\nWe hypothesized that higher perceived partner support would relate to fewer depressive symptoms and lower parenting stress, and expected that this effect would be present above and beyond the effect of overall perceived support. Importantly, we expected that this association would be stronger when mothers endorsed a stronger Latino cultural orientation. To more rigorously assess these associations, we considered a number of control variables. First, to assess the unique effect of Latino cultural orientation, above and beyond the effect of American cultural orientation (i.e., orientation toward mainstream American values, behaviors, and traditions; Cuellar et al., 1995) we controlled for the mothers’ engagement in the American culture. Second, because more traditional Latina adolescents are involved in more established partner relationships (e.g., married, cohabitating) than their less traditional peers, we also controlled for relationship characteristics in all analyses.\n\nFinally, given demonstrated links of demographic and contextual characteristics to the psychological and parenting adjustment of adolescent mothers (Mollborn & Dennis, 2012), we controlled for these variables when they showed relations with our adjustment variables. Specifically, we considered maternal age and level of education as proxies for readiness to parent, because readiness is linked to adjustment in adolescent mothers (Whitman et al., 2001), and life stress, because of its known effect on psychological adjustment (Wakschlag & Hans 2000). We also considered maternal work and government assistance status to index mothers’ socio-economic resources given their link to parenting in minority families (García-Coll et al., 1996). However, our sample was relatively homogeneous in regard to socio-economic status, so we did not expect significant associations for economic variables.\n\nDiscussion\n\nThe current study examined the interplay of Latino cultural orientation and perceived partner support in protecting the psychological and parenting adjustment of young, low-income, Puerto Rican mothers during the second year postpartum. We found that most mothers were involved in relatively long-term romantic relationships and perceived their partners as quite supportive. As predicted, perceptions of greater partner support were associated with fewer depressive symptoms and lower parenting stress. Importantly, in the case of parenting stress, maternal cultural orientation influenced how perceived partner support related to the mothers’ adjustment. Specifically, partner support was associated with lower parenting stress only at relatively high levels of Latino cultural orientation. Findings contribute to the literature by identifying a protective factor for the adjustment of young Puerto Rican mothers, an at-risk population that has received little research attention. The study also expands on previous work by highlighting the critical role of culture in shaping social support processes within the partner relationships of these young mothers.\n\nRegarding our goal of describing these relationships, we found that over 70% of the Puerto Rican mothers in the larger sample from which our participants were drawn had a partner, and most (67%) resided with them. This finding corroborated those of other studies showing a substantial proportion of young Latina mothers are engaged in fairly committed relationships during the postpartum years (Contreras, López et al., 1999; Moore et al., 2007). As expected, among mothers with a partner, those with a stronger Latino cultural orientation were more likely to be married, to reside with their partners, and to be in a relationship with her child’s father. These results for Puerto Rican-origin mothers add to prior research showing similar demographic profiles based on acculturation level among primarily Mexican-origin mothers (Reynoso et al., 1993). Together, these findings highlight the role of cultural orientation in shaping the young mothers’ relationship and childrearing context during the first postpartum years.\n\nGiven the importance of the early childrearing environment for children’s long-term development, increasing our knowledge of the influence that partner relationships have on mothers’ adjustment is critical to appropriately tailor interventions for these young families. In our study, perceived partner support emerged as a unique predictor of both fewer depressive symptoms and less parenting stress, after accounting for perceived support from all others in the mothers’ social network. This finding adds to the scant literature pointing to partner support as a resource that can promote the psychological adjustment of young Puerto Rican mothers during the postpartum period (Contreras, Lopez et al., 1999; Leadbeater & Linares, 1992). The unique contribution of partner support is also in line with findings for adult parents, which suggest that during the postpartum years the support mothers perceive from partner support is especially protective for their psychological well-being (Tanner Stapleton et al., 2012).\n\nGiven the high value that Latino culture places on raising children within a romantic relationship and the emphasis on close and supportive family relationships (Cauce & Domenech-Rodriguez, 2002), we expected perceived partner support would have a stronger effect on adjustment when mothers endorsed a stronger Latino cultural orientation. In the case of maternal depressive symptoms, this was not the case. The protective effect of partner support was similar at all levels of maternal cultural orientation. In support to our predictions, cultural orientation did moderate the association between partner support and lower parenting stress. Specifically, perceived partner support was protective for mothers’ parenting stress only when mothers endorsed a relatively strong Latino cultural orientation. For mothers who endorsed a low Latino orientation, their perceptions of partner support were unrelated to their parenting adjustment.\n\nAlthough our data does not speak to the specific mechanisms accounting for the moderating effect of cultural orientation, it is important to note that level of Latino cultural orientation was not correlated with the amount of support they perceived from their partners. Therefore, the positive effect of partner support among the more Latino-oriented mothers was not due to these mothers merely perceiving higher levels of support than the less Latino-oriented mothers. Instead, these mothers appear to have experienced or interpreted similar levels of perceived partner support in ways that benefitted their parenting adjustment.\n\nThese results align with the interpretation that perceived partner support may be more influential when the partner relationship is embedded in a culture that considers the family as the preeminent socialization vehicle and emphasizes the importance of interdependence and warm, supportive relationships among family members (Campos et al., 2008; Cauce & Domenech-Rodriguez, 2002). In this cultural context, the importance of raising children within a romantic relationship may make partner support more valuable or consequential to mothers, especially in regard to their role as mothers. Young mothers who perceive extensive support from their partners may feel validated in their parenting role and more able to cope with the demands of parenting (Mallette, Futris, Brown, & Oshri, 2015). Moreover, both the provision and receipt of support is culturally sanctioned and expected in this cultural context, making it easier for individuals to accept and benefit from perceived support (Kaniasty & Norris, 2000; Uchida et al., 2008). This interpretation is consistent with an emerging literature suggesting that cultural norms regarding relationships influence individuals’ behaviors, expectations, and appraisals of interpersonal experiences, and in turn, the effectiveness of perceived support (Campos et al., 2008; Endo, Heine, & Lehman, 2000; Kim et al., 2008; Uchida et al., 2008).\n\nThe reasons for the differential pattern of associations for depressive symptoms and parenting stress are not clear. However, this pattern may suggest that for the more Latino-oriented mothers, partner support may be more strongly related to the perceptions of themselves in their role as mothers than to their individual adjustment. The pattern of results is also in line with the prior literature which has shown more consistent links for Latina mothers’ individual wellbeing (e.g., depressive symptoms) than for their adjustment to parenting (Contreras, Lopez, et al., 1999; Fagan & Lee, 2010). The inconsistent findings may be due in part to variability of mothers’ cultural orientation across samples, and the fact that past research did not examined culture as a moderator of these associations.\n\nExamination of the plotted interaction for parenting stress revealed a pattern in which the low Latino-oriented mothers reported lower parenting stress than the more Latino-oriented mothers when they perceived low partner support, and at high levels of support, their stress levels were more similar to those of the more Latino oriented mothers. Thus, relative to the more Latino-oriented mothers, the less Latino-oriented mothers do not appear to be at higher risk for parenting stress than their more Latino oriented peers. It may be that these mothers have internal assets or other sources of support that facilitate their parenting adjustment. It may also be that it is the more Latino-oriented mothers’ parenting stress that is heightened by the perceptions of low support from partners. Perceiving low levels of support in a context were support is expected may have an especially detrimental effect for these more Latino-oriented young mothers (Contreras, Lopez, et al., 1999). Studies that examine the role of different assets and sources of support simultaneously are needed to uncover factors that affect the adjustment of young Latina mothers with different cultural orientations.\n\nIn regard to other contextual factors related to mothers’ adjustment, we found that overall network support played a unique protective role. Mothers with greater overall perceived social support reported fewer depressive symptoms and lower parenting stress, above and beyond the effect of partner support and demographic and life stress variables. This finding adds to the small literature linking overall perceived social support to adjustment among Latino parents, which has focused primarily on adult mothers of Mexican origin (Barnett et al., 2013; Cardoso, Padilla, & Sampson, 2010). This result is also in line with prior findings demonstrating a protective effect of overall perceived support on the parenting behaviors of Latina adolescent mothers of primarily Puerto Rican origin (Contreras, Mangerlsdorf et al., 1999). Unfortunately, despite the protective effect of social support, the presence of negative life stress in the young mothers’ life was related to their experience of more depressive symptoms. Thus, stressful life events, which are common among low-income adolescent mothers (Wakschlag & Hans 2000), appear to have strong implications for their adjustment. Uncovering factors that may protect young mothers from life stress is another important goal for future research.\n\nStudy Limitations and Implications\n\nWe relied on a widely-used global measure of Latino cultural orientation that assesses different behavioral and affective components of cultural orientation. However, although this measure was linked to behavioral indicators that are consistent with the endorsement of values associated with familism, it does not measure those specific Latino values (e.g., family member interdependence and solidarity). An important next step for research is to uncover the specific factors that account for the observed moderating effect of Latino cultural orientation. Obtaining the partners’ reports of their cultural orientation and endorsement of Latino values would also provide a more complete characterization of the cultural context in which the partner relationships are embedded. A more in-depth understanding of the values and processes that enable mothers to benefit from their partners’ support would not only inform intervention efforts with this at-risk population, but also further our knowledge of how culture can influence close relationships and the nature and function of the social support processes operating within them. Finally, given that the mothers in our sample were of low-socio-economic-status and of Puerto Rican origin, future studies should examine whether the protective factors we identified for this group of mothers is also relevant for young mothers of other economic or ethnic backgrounds.\n\nOur findings have important implications for intervention. The differential effects of partner support on mothers’ adjustment indicate that programs need to be tailored to the specific needs of Latina mothers with different cultural orientations. Providers also need to be aware that the perceived availability of partner support does not necessarily indicate mothers are directly benefiting from this support, especially for less Latino-oriented mothers. For more Latino-oriented mothers, work could focus on helping couples maintain positive relationships and cope together with the ongoing demands they encounter. More generally, our findings suggest that early screening should include an evaluation of the mothers’ close relationships and social networks, as small or unsupportive networks may place them at risk for psychological and parenting adjustment difficulties. Finally, given that the association between life stress and depressive symptoms persisted even when the effects of social support were accounted for, interventions should also increase the adolescents’ resources and skills to cope with life stress.\n\nThe current study identified perceived partner support as a protective factor for the adjustment of young Puerto Rican mothers; a highly understudied population despite their significant risk for difficult adjustment. The study is also the first empirical investigation to demonstrate that Latino cultural orientation moderates the relations between perceived partner support and the parenting adjustment of young Latina mothers. Findings add to the small, but growing literature demonstrating the need to account for the cultural context in which relationships are embedded in order to appropriately understand the nature and impact that perceived support has on an individual’s adjustment."
