        "text": "Albert Pinkham Ryder (American, 1847 – 1917)\n\nFlying Dutchman\n\nCOMPLETED BY 1887\n\nOIL ON CANVAS MOUNTED ON FIBERBOARD\n\nNumerous 19th century authors popularized the story of a Dutch sea captain who blasphemes by swearing on a relic of the true cross that no storm could defeat him, even if he sailed until Judgment Day. The Devil accepts the challenge, requiring the Dutchman’s son to pursue the phantom ship for years, bearing the relic that will redeem his father. The fall from grace and redemption became central subjects for Ryder’s major canvases. Everything in this painting – centrifugal rhythms, mingled colors, urgent paint handling, narrative of desperation – ascends to a higher key, reflecting Ryder’s greater mastery and the growing intensity of his emotions.\n\nLoan courtesy of the Smithsonian American Art Museum, Gift of John Gellatly\n\nAlbert Pinkham Ryder's Easel\n\nc. LATE 19TH OR EARLY 20TH CENTURY\n\nWOOD\n\nSometime before his death in 1917, Ryder gave his easel to his sole student in New York City, Louise Fitzpatrick. Fitzpatrick, in turn, gave it to her close friend, Flora Evergood, for the use of her son, Philip. Evergood, a Social Realist painter, was strongly influenced by Ryder. Evergood’s widow gave the easel to her caregiver, who gave it to Evergood’s biographer, Dr. Kendall Taylor. From there, it made its way to William Vareika Fine Arts in Newport, and finally, to the New Bedford Whaling Museum, where it resides alongside Ryder’s Landscape. The endpapers of the catalogue accompanying this exhibition are detailed shots of the paint splatter on this easel.\n\nNew Bedford Whaling Museum purchase, 2005.7. Purchased with gifts from William Vareika and the Amy Janes Bare Charitable Trust, Bernard Taradash, Trustee.\n\nAlbert Pinkham Ryder (American, 1847 – 1917)\n\nWeir’s Orchard\n\nCOMPLETED 1885 - 1890\n\nOIL ON CANVAS\n\nPainter J. Alden Weir was among Ryder’s closest friends from their student days in New York throughout their careers. Weir married in 1882 and moved to a large farm near Ridgefield, Connecticut, which became a rural retreat for Ryder, as well as Hassam, Sargent, and Twachtman. At the farm, Ryder could escape the city and renew his deep love of nature.\n\nAfter recuperating there from an illness in 1897, Ryder wrote to Weir, “I have never seen the beauty of spring before.…That eloquent little fruit tree that we looked at together, like a spirit among the more earthly colors, is already losing its fairy blossoms, showing the lesson of life; how alert we must be if we would have its gifts and values.” Weir’s Orchard may commemorate this experience.\n\nLoan courtesy of the Wadsworth Atheneum Museum of Art, Hartford, CT. The Ella Gallup Sumner and Mary Catlin Sumner Collection Fund\n\nAlbert Pinkham Ryder (American, 1847 – 1917)\n\nLandscape\n\nCOMPLETED BY 1870\n\nOIL ON CANVAS\n\nThis early landscape is revolutionary in the way it almost dissolves into abstraction, with large areas of light and shadow balancing the composition of trees bordering a canal. The canvas may have been unprimed, allowing the weave to be visible in areas where thinned paint stains the fabric rather than resting on the surface. Glossy glazes add highlights in some areas. From the beginning, Ryder departed from conventional techniques to explore new ways of using pigments and media, saying he wanted to get his paint “less painty looking.” The first recorded owner of this painting was C.E.S. Wood of Portland, Oregon, who would become the artist’s most sympathetic and inspired supporter. It returned to Ryder’s hometown in 2004 when patrons of the New Bedford Whaling Museum purchased it for the collection.\n\nNew Bedford Whaling Museum purchase, 2005.3\n\nAlbert Pinkham Ryder (American, 1847 – 1917)\n\nNear Litchfield, Connecticut\n\nCOMPLETED BY 1876\n\nOIL ON COMPOSITION BOARD\n\nAn inscription on the back of this small landscape cites the location in Connecticut and year when it was created and adds that it was presented to Charles de Kay, who was then the art critic for the New York Times. This helpfully shows that, even at the beginning of his career, the artist cultivated useful connections and was ambitious for his art to succeed.\n\nRyder’s first paintings were mostly landscapes in a pastoral mood, revealing an artist who revered nature and sought to capture its inner vitality. The free brushwork and fresh colors of Near Litchfield reflect his search for an intensity of expression that he said was “vibrating with the thrill of a new creation.”\n\nThe small size of Ryder’s early paintings cannot obscure his intention to experiment with new approaches and elevate nature into a spiritual realm.\n\nLoan courtesy of the family of Robin B. Martin\n\nAlbert Pinkham Ryder (American, 1847 – 1917)\n\nThe Lovers’ Boat\n\nCOMPLETED BY 1881\n\nOIL ON BOARD\n\nTwo lovers drift through a narrow channel in a sailboat, sheltering under an exotic canopy in the stern. The ghostly glow of a full moon outlines simple forms. This is likely Ryder’s first nocturne, but already he uses novel means to achieve the mystery of dark sky and watery reflections, leaving the panel unpainted in places and allowing warm tones of varnished wood to create a spectral scene. Ryder called attention to the effect in the accompanying poem, saying the boat glides “into the deeper shadows / of sky and land reflected.”\n\nHe exhibited the painting in 1881, when his youthful interest in pastoral landscapes was giving way to a fascination with romantic love as expressed in poetry and literature. His deeply personal vision was coming into focus: “…no two visions are alike, and those who reach the heights have all toiled up the steep mountain by a different route. To each has been revealed a different panorama.”\n\nLoan courtesy of the Smithsonian American Art Museum, Gift of Alastair B. Martin\n\nAlbert Pinkham Ryder (American, 1847 – 1917)\n\nA Country Girl\n\nc. 1903\n\nOIL ON CANVAS\n\nRyder’s increasing preoccupation with romantic love is seen in his mid-career subjects and in his personal life as well. This beguiling simple country girl looks straight at the viewer with an inviting glance, her billowing skirt echoing the sway of the trees and revealing a glimpse of slip. Of the several simple young maidens in Ryder’s oeuvre — many, like Perrette and Little Maid of Acadie inhabiting the realm of literature — this feels most immediate, like a “real-life” girl.\n\nRyder was shy with women, adopting an elaborate courtesy in his rare interactions with them. His mother had worn Quaker dress; he was raised with three brothers and attended a boy’s school; there is no mention of a romantic attachment before he reached forty. So Ryder’s friends were surprised one day to learn that he had found a young girl from the country wandering the streets and brought her home to live in his apartment; the friends discretely spirited her off to the police, leaving Ryder bereft and “love sick.” His clumsiness in courtship was manifested in other ways as his loneliness grew more acute; the question of his sexual orientation was never mentioned.\n\nLoan courtesy of the Collection of the Maier Museum of Art at Randolph College, founded as Randolph-Macon Woman’s College, Lynchburg, VA\n\nAlbert Pinkham Ryder (American, 1847 – 1917)\n\nLandscape with Sheep\n\nc. 1870\n\nOIL ON PANEL\n\nClose observation of these three sheep – their standing and reclining postures and meticulously delineated faces, horns, hooves, and volumetric proportions – shows Ryder to have been an excellent draughtsman. Later legends tried to recast him as an awkward untutored naif, but the early paintings of cows, horses, and sheep belie this.\n\nThe landscape in which these sheep exist, however, lacks any detail; the animals seem almost to hover in an essence of sun-drenched sky and autumnal grasses. His aim was not to engage in narrative, but rather to seize the deeper currents of nature.\n\nLoan courtesy of the Cornell Fine Arts Museum, Gift of Alastair Bradley Martin, 1948.3\n\nAlbert Pinkham Ryder (American, 1847 – 1917)\n\nPastoral Study\n\nc. 1897\n\nOIL ON CANVAS MOUNTED ON FIBERBOARD\n\nPastoral Study is Ryder’s final revisiting of the pastoral landscape that began his career, but now he masterfully elevates the subject to a symbolic level. Lengthening shadows establish an elegiac mood, while two ancient trees, with trunks intertwined like lovers, evoke the passage of years. It is tempting to see Ovid’s story of Baucis and Philemon in this landscape, where an aged couple is turned into an intertwined oak and linden at their deaths. Though there is no record of this meaning, the work is unusually large, a size Ryder usually reserved for biblical or literary subjects.\n\nLoan courtesy of the Smithsonian American Art Museum, Gift of John Gellatly\n\nAlbert Pinkham Ryder (American, 1847 – 1917)\n\nThe Shepherdess\n\nEARLY 1880s\n\nGILDED WOOD\n\nThe subject of an innocent young shepherdess, whose virtue is emblematic of her closeness to nature, was a popular theme in Ryder’s day. By adding antique panpipes and Elizabethan costuming, however, Ryder elevates this traditional scene to the realm of poetry, where swaying trees create a sacred bower and sheep attend to the song.\n\nThe glow of this small wood panel is remarkable, owing to Ryder’s use of gold leaf below the thin paint glazes. He was on a search for a more translucent, gem-like color effect, believing light would penetrate the glazes and reflect off the underlying gold leaf. He once remarked to a friend that all that was left to a modern master was to “improve the medium.”\n\nLoan courtesy of the Brooklyn Museum, Frederick Loeser Fund 14.553\n\nAlbert Pinkham Ryder (American, 1847 – 1917)\n\nSpring\n\nCOMPLETED ABOUT 1879\n\nOIL ON CANVAS\n\nThis painting is key to understanding Ryder’s early success as a modern painter of feeling over form. It was reproduced as an engraving in an 1880 article called “The Younger Painters of America,” after being exhibited in New York the previous year. Comparing the published engraving to the appearance of the work today, we see that nothing has changed, giving us one securely dated early work against which to judge other somewhat similar paintings whose histories are clouded by alterations, deteriorated condition, or insecure dating and attribution. Spring, then, anchors the early pastoral stage of Ryder’s career.\n\nThe image of a woman holding a child and standing near a tree, without narrative or incident, invites a metaphorical reading as emblem of springtime. This leads to an understanding of the delicately leafing trees and lipid golden light suffusing the atmosphere and reflecting off water as the true subject of the work.\n\nRyder achieved his evanescent coloration by using many thin tinted glazes. The paint film along the left edge of the artwork is noticeably thicker than elsewhere, suggesting that the work was stored on its side before the glazes and varnishes had dried.\n\nToledo Museum of Art, Gift of Florence Scott Libbey, 1923.3134\n\nAlbert Pinkham Ryder (1847 – 1917)\n\nBy the Tomb of the Prophet\n\nAFTER 1882\n\nOIL ON PANEL\n\nRyder sampled several different genres and subjects early in his career, painting decorative furniture panels and leather screens, as well as a mirror frame. This is one of a handful of orientalist subjects he created when these “exotic” subjects captured the fancy of the art world, inspired by Delacroix, Gerome, and Tiffany.\n\nA minaret and a pyramid loom over the long wall of a Middle Eastern “old city,” but Ryder seems equally interested in the cluster of horses waiting in the foreground. Once again, he features a white horse, the favorite protagonist of his early paintings.\n\nThe size and format of this small work suggest it is painted on a wooden cigar box lid, which Ryder frequently chose as a support.\n\n5 13/16 × 11 7/16 inches, frame: 15 1/2 × 20 1/2 × 3 3/4 inches\n\nLoan courtesy of the Delaware Art Museum, Acquired through the George I. Speer Bequest, 1968\n\nAlbert Pinkham Ryder (1847 – 1917)\n\nAn Oriental Camp\n\nc. 1875\n\nOIL ON CANVAS\n\nFor decades, aspiring American artists traveled to Italy to draw inspiration from the classical monuments of antiquity. In the 1860s and ‘70s, modern, forward-leaning artists turned away from the rationality of the Greco-Roman tradition, favoring instead the richer colors and more sensual art of North Africa and the Middle East. Although Ryder did not travel to those countries until the early 1880s, he was attracted even earlier to the “exotic” scenes of Arab market places and nomadic traders that were featured in many exhibitions.\n\nAn Oriental Camp summarizes this shift in Ryder’s art, marking him as one of the “modern men.” X-rays reveal that there was originally an imposing classical façade painted at the right of the canvas, now completely overpainted and replaced with mysterious Arab tents dominating the scene. Ryder included a camel and several horses in the scene, with a trader’s head and arm shown just behind the white horse. The thick paint film has deteriorated over the years, but we can still discern the touches of color that dazzled contemporary critics – see the glowing red saddle on the white horse or the rich chestnut coloration of the horse at right.\n\nLoan courtesy of the Mead Art Museum of Amherst College, Amherst, Massachusetts, Gift of George D. Pratt (Class of 1893)\n\nAlbert Pinkham Ryder (1847 – 1917)\n\nUm Campo Oriental\n\ncerca 1875\n\nÓleo sobre tela\n\nDurante décadas, aspirantes a artistas americanos viajaram à Itália para se inspirarem nos monumentos clássicos da antiguidade. Nas décadas de 1860 e 70, artistas modernos e progressistas afastaram-se da racionalidade da tradição greco-romana, preferindo as cores mais ricas e a arte mais sensual do Norte da África e do Oriente Médio. Embora Ryder não tenha viajado para esses países até o início da década de 1880, ele foi atraído ainda antes pelas cenas exóticas dos mercados árabes e comerciantes nómades que eram apresentados em muitas exposições.\n\nUm Campo Oriental resume essa mudança na arte de Ryder, marcando-o como um dos “homens modernos.” Raios-X revelam que havia originalmente uma imponente fachada clássica pintada à direita da tela, agora completamente pintada e substituída por misteriosas tendas árabes dominando a cela. Ryder incluiu um camelo e vários cavalos na cena, com a cabeça e braço de um comerciante mostrados logo atrás do cavalo branco. A espessa película de tinta deteriorou-se ao longo dos anos, mas ainda podemos discernir os toques de cor que deslumbraram os críticos contemporâneos – veja a sela vermelha brilhante no cavalo branco ou a rica coloração castanha do cavalo à direita.\n\nApenas uma vez Ryder retratou uma fachada neoclássica e apenas para desafiar a autoridade da tradição greco-romana que ela representa. O Templo da Mente (Galeria de Arte Albright-Knox, Buffalo) é baseado numa história de Edgar Allen Poe sobre uma mente assombrada por fantasmas.

For this small “lyric of dawn,” he penned a couplet that was inscribed on the frame: “In the morning, ashen-hued, / Came nymphs dancing through the wood.” These whirling nymphs with long hair flying, accompanied by a seated muse, show Ryder moving beyond naturalistic subjects into the realm of the imagination. Elite collectors responded well; this small panel was first owned by New York Times art critic Charles de Kay, and then by Stanford White, an architect and leader of the “American Renaissance.”\n\nOver time, the figures faded and became hard to distinguish from the landscape, so a restorer outlined them for clearer definition.\n\nLoan courtesy of the Smithsonian American Art Museum, Gift of John Gellatly\n\nAlbert Pinkham Ryder (American, 1847 – 1917)\n\nKing Cophetua and the Beggar Maid\n\nCOMPLETED By 1906 or 1907\n\nOIL ON CANVAS MOUNTED ON FIBERBOARD\n\nThe subject of an African king who was bewitched by the beauty of a poor beggar maid began as an Elizabethan ballad and became a popular theme for Shakespeare, Tennyson, and several late Victorian artists. Although Ryder was regarded as a recluse in later life, he was widely traveled, with four trips to Europe and visits to many key museums and collections, and he was well acquainted with modern literature.\n\nRyder often chose subjects that elevated the nobility of true love over material wealth and temporal power, and he gravitated to subjects that united lovers across ethnic as well as class divides.\n\nTechnical studies show that Ryder liked to start an image on a surface that had been previously used. This canvas began with a painting of a large horse oriented as a horizontal image; an early stage of this literary subject included a small cow near the beggar maid, making her a shepherdess. Working and reworking the image, he reduced it to essential features — a mounted nobleman, a graceful maid, each framed against a high hill — and finally arrived at the poses and spatial tensions that evoke the exact moment of enchantment.\n\nLoan courtesy of the Smithsonian American Art Museum, Gift of John Gellatly\n\nAlbert Pinkham Ryder (American, 1847 – 1917)\n\nThe Lorelei\n\nc. 1896 – 1917\n\nOIL ON CANVAS\n\nA singing woman held huge romantic appeal for Ryder, who once is said to have impulsively proposed marriage to a woman singing in a nearby apartment. But the charming singer of several early paintings was transformed into an evil seductress who lured sailors to their deaths in The Lorelei (from a poem by Heinrich Heine). Ryder’s deepening solitude and despair reflects his disappointment in love.\n\nCombining subject, meaning, mood, composition, rhythmic forces, and brushwork into a unified image that expresses an existential truth was never easy for Ryder. After 1897, deteriorating health increasingly compromised his efforts. Around that time, he announced that he had finished The Lorelei, but in fact he continued to rework it until his death in 1917, “fretting and stewing” as he repositioned the “witching maiden” on the jagged rock overlooking sailors below. After his death, the murky paint surface was further disturbed by a restorer.\n\nLoan courtesy of the Smithsonian American Art Museum, Gift of Tulip Tree Foundation\n\nAlbert Pinkham Ryder (1847 – 1917)\n\nThe Grazing Horse\n\nMID-1870s\n\nOIL ON CANVAS\n\nSeveral of Ryder’s early paintings of farm animals were acquired by his dealer, Daniel Cottier, and in 1914 six of these were purchased from Cottier’s widow by the Brooklyn Museum – the first Ryder paintings to enter any museum collection. The museum invited the artist to sign each work on the back of the stretcher, arming authenticity as Ryder forgeries were beginning to emerge. Other collectors followed suit, asking Ryder to endorse their paintings, which he did. In at least a couple of instances, he signed works that are now known forgeries or even tinted photographs, perhaps from a reluctance to embarrass the owners, or because his advancing illness and impaired eyesight left him confused about their authorship. Whether a painting bears Ryder’s signature or not is of no use in determining authenticity.\n\nLoan courtesy of the Brooklyn Museum, Augustus Graham School of Design Fund 14.554\n\nAlbert Pinkham Ryder (American, 1847 – 1917)\n\nPegasus Departing\n\nBY 1901\n\nOIL ON CANVAS MOUNTED ON FIBERBOARD\n\nThe poet on Pegasus is leaving the land of the muses after seeking inspiration for his art. This work has a disturbed surface that betrays its contentious history. Ryder was a notoriously slow producer, laboring sometimes for years on a single image until it was “felt as true.” When collector John Gellatly pestered Ryder to complete this painting for his new salon, the angered artist scarred the painting with a metal comb rather than give it up; the resulting structural problems are revealed in the x-ray of the image. Ryder eventually repainted the image, blurring many forms; at some point, the damaged canvas was transferred to panel.\n\nThe uncertain foreshortening of Pegasus suggests Ryder may have been looking at an illusionistic ceiling painting, perhaps Delacroix’s horse-drawn chariot of Apollo on the ceiling of the Louvre.\n\nLoan courtesy of the Smithsonian American Art Museum, Gift of John Gellatly\n\nAlbert Pinkham Ryder (1847 – 1917)\n\nPegasus\n\nOIL ON WOOD\n\nIn his early career, Ryder preferred horses to any other subject, painting them grazing or standing in stables. He included horses in several subjects even when there was no narrative reason for them. His ambition expanded after he toured European museums. Soon Ryder’s horse took wing and was transformed into Pegasus, the mythical steed who carried the muses to Mount Helicon, the source of poetic inspiration. This tiny but ecstatic panel features the winged Pegasus with two muses, a small cherub, a radiating sun, and a steep cli. It announces a turning point in his art, signaling his immersion in the realm of poetry and myth; his early fascination with nature gives way to the world of the imagination.\n\nLoan courtesy of the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, Smithsonian Institutions, Washington, DC, Gift of the Joseph H.

With this image, Ryder’s early hopeful paintings of lovers takes a tragic turn, as his own hopes for love withered over the years. In one of Ryder’s poems, he wrote of “a wild note of longing.”\n\nMassive swells rise in the foreground, gathering force and thrusting upward, until a giant wave fatally assaults the boat. As if in response, enormous rocky cliffs jut up at an opposing angle and carry the energy into the sky, where dark clouds, haloed by light from an obscured moon, release the tension at the top of the frame. Ryder’s brushwork is a tour-de-force of pigments mixed wet-on-wet that variously create water, rock, and air, leading a New York Times critic to praise his “massive and simple” forms that are all of “one texture … one rich and precious material.”\n\nLoan courtesy of the Smithsonian American Art Museum, Gift of John Gellatly\n\nAlbert Pinkham Ryder (American, 1847 – 1917)\n\nJonah\n\nc. 1885 – 1895\n\nOIL ON CANVAS MOUNTED ON FIBERBOARD\n\nRyder worked for a decade on his greatest masterpiece, finally achieving the ultimate vision of abandonment and redemption that were his most profound subjects. The Old Testament book tells how Jonah defied God’s command and experienced His vengeful wrath; rebuked and repentant, Jonah surrendered entirely to God’s will and was redeemed.\n\nThis large painting unites inspired compositional rhythms and wholly reinvented paint-handling to create a new form of dramatic expression. Ryder knew his approach was revolutionary. “Have you ever seen an inch worm crawl up a leaf or a twig, and then clinging to the very end, revolve in the air, feeling for something to reach something? That’s like me. I am trying to find something out there beyond the place on which I have a footing.”\n\nLoan courtesy of the Smithsonian American Art Museum, Gift of John Gellatly\n\nAlbert Pinkham Ryder (American, 1847 – 1917)\n\nHomeward Bound\n\nc. 1893 – 1894\n\nOIL ON CANVAS ON WOOD\n\nWashington businessman Duncan Phillips lost his beloved older brother during the 1918 flu pandemic. He wrote, “Sorrow all but overwhelmed me. Then I turned to my love of painting for the will to live.” He began collecting and, in 1921, opened the first modern art museum in America as a memorial to his brother.\n\nPhillips was deeply affected by Ryder’s paintings, including this blissful scene of a boat in full sail cruising toward an open horizon under a translucent sky. Ryder painted it while returning from a trip to Europe, which he undertook for the pleasure of an ocean voyage with his friend, Captain John Robinson.\n\nPhillips wrote, “All of Ryder is in the small marine entitled Homeward Bound. … That little boat at the center of the composition, as each of us is at the center of his particular universe, symbolized the soul’s adventure as it traverses the vast, uncharted solitude, travelling toward the unknown.”\n\nLoan courtesy of the Phillips Collection, Washington, DC.

A large wave once rose at left and lifted the stern, contributing to the rhythm, before it was altered by a restorer. The inspired brushwork in waves and sky create a mystical mood; the gravitational pull of the moon orchestrates the energies.\n\nIn early exhibitions, this work was simply called Moonlight; later it was retitled with a line from Coleridge’s “Rime of the Ancient Mariner,” perhaps to reinforce the “sloping” and “dipping” rhythms in the work.\n\nLoan courtesy of the Smithsonian American Art Museum, Gift of John Gellatly\n\nCharles Ephraim Burchfield (1893 – 1967)\n\nNature’s Mystic Spiral\n\n1916\n\nWATERCOLOR AND GRAPHITE ON PAPER\n\nCharles Burchfield’s ecstatic embrace of nature was at its most intense in 1916, when he made hundreds of transcendent, even hallucinatory, watercolors. Of these, Nature’s Mystic Spiral is the most magical, evoking not only Ryder’s sublime moonlit scenes but also Van Gogh’s Starry Night, where dark cypress trees stand as witness to the celestial spectacle.\n\nRyder’s dreamy moonlights inspired many early modernist painters to create their own visionary works. Burchfield, Dove, Hartley, O’Keee, and others used the motif of auras rippling outward from the sun or moon; these powerful waves of energy emanating from a mystical source travel the heavens to reach us in our terrestrial reality, opening a path to a higher spiritual realm.\n\nLoan courtesy of the Wadsworth Atheneum, Bequest of Edward Gorey\n\nThomas Hart Benton (1889 – 1975)\n\nThe Cliffs\n\n1921\n\nOIL ON CANVAS\n\nThe rhythms of the dramatic landscapes on the west end of Benton’s beloved Martha’s Vineyard echo in this dramatic and vibrant view of the seaside cliffs of Chilmark and Aquinnah. The hard edges and contrasts are fixed in a tumult of somehow conflicting yet complimentary patterns, merging sea and land as interwoven in their influence upon one another. This evokes a comparison with Ryder’s later works that reduce elements to their most basic forms of pattern and light.\n\nLoan courtesy of the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, Smithsonian Institutions, Washington, DC, Gift of Joseph H.

Many people were complicit in the deception.\n\nIn 1920, the first biography of Ryder was published by Frederic Fairchild Sherman, including mention of an orientalist painting called Nourmahal, which was listed by title in an 1880 exhibition catalogue but then lost. Sherman forecasted, “When the canvas reappears, as it probably will some day, it will be found to belong with his few masterpieces.” Twelve years later, when art dealer F. Newlin Price published Ryder — a Study of Appreciation, a “newly discovered” self-portrait was the frontispiece; it showed the artist in his studio, and this painting on the wall, identified as the “lost” but now miraculously rediscovered Nourmahal.\n\nThe trap was baited. Metropolitan Museum of Art curator Bryson Burroughs petitioned the Museum’s board to purchase this unusually large “lost masterpiece,” which they did. Numerous other museums and collectors also bought clever forgeries.\n\nIn the 1930s and later, scholar Lloyd Goodrich painstakingly sorted the originals from the innumerable forgeries, much aided by the new diagnostic technique of x-radiography. Sherman had to disavow many of the “found” paintings he had authenticated, and it was revealed that at least two-thirds of the works in Price’s book were forgeries, including the frontispiece Self-Portrait and this elaborately concocted Nourmahal. The sheer extent to which the forgers went to deceive, including also a fake dealer’s stamp and letters of authentication from Ryder’s art school “friends,” indicates the esteem in which Ryder’s art was held.\n\nLent by the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Morris K.

Many have titles referring to the moon, a central feature in many of Ryder’s paintings. Pousette-Dart’s family had a house on Nantucket, and he would have felt close to the sea, which was so much a part of Ryder’s art.\n\nLoan courtesy of The Richard Pousette-Dart Estate\n\nRonald Bladen (1918 – 1988)\n\nTwo Yellow Arms\n\nc. 1957 – 59\n\nOIL ON WOOD PANEL\n\nRonnie Bladen was a West Coast artist, who worked with painters such as Clyfford Still in the 1940s.

Painting was illegal unless it was a frowny type of painting weaponized as critique. No fun there. I kept painting and looking. Walking backwards through art history I slipped and fell on Ryder. The Racetrack was familiar from an elementary school textbook where it was paired with a Dickinson poem. Now I was confronted with everything else — pungent, intimate pictures!

Albert Pinkham Ryder’s work fills that bill. His paintings are power objects, oozing mystery an emotion.\n\nIt has become possible, with new digital capabilities, to photograph color in very low light. In photographing by moonlight one sees that there are real differences in color and atmosphere between specific nights.\n\nRyder was a keen observer of nature, which greatly informed his paintings. A study of Ryder’s nocturnes reveals a level of subtlety that partially explains their quiet magnetism.\n\nAs with Ryder, my work’s basis is the physical world, but more as an evocative interpretation than a literal one.

Ao fotografar ao luar, percebe-se que existem diferenças reais de cor e atmosfera entre noites específicas.\n\nRyder era um observador atento da natureza, o que influenciou muito as suas pinturas. Um estudo dos noturnos de Ryder revela um nível de subtileza que explica parcialmente o seu magnetismo silencioso.\n\nTal como acontece com Ryder, a base do meu trabalho é o mundo físico, mas mais como uma interpretação evocativa do que à letra.

My painter’s mind pictures the isolation of a ship on a vast dark sea and thanks to Ryder I imagine a moon all aglow high overhead.\n\nThis particular painting left out the glow of a moon but I have done plenty of sea paintings with bright white moons. In “Four Masted Full Sail” it is the light of the many stars that give the ship its luminous back light. Perhaps Ryder, who visited the harbor in the city of New York, wasn’t able to see stars because the lamp lights were too bright.\n\nI feel close to his yearning to make something darkly mysterious yet beautiful, something as hopeful as a ship in full sail illuminated by a night sky.\n\nLoan courtesy of Judy and Bruce\n\nKatherine Bradford\n\nVela completa de cuatro mástiles\n\n2013\n\nAcrílico sobre lienzo\n\nDeclaración de la artista:\n\nUn barco fantasmal en el mar por la noche—este es sin duda un gran tema de Albert Pinkham Ryder.

Em “Quatro Mastros Vela Cheia” é a luz de muitas estrelas que dão ao navio a sua luz de fundo luminoso.

He had the sea. He had brooding form and remote light. But he had these elements as a visceral understanding of nature, a primordial nature. It’s like his paintings reach that barely discernible, dimmest edge of knowledge we all recognize. He remains important to me because that is the type of knowledge that has become paramount in my own drawing process. Though he used landscape, mythology, and allegory, it feels as though his subjects served the deeper purpose of an investigation into the human predicament, our confounded situation that never truly evolves. Within a tempestuous use of paint he portrays nature, aloof to our situation, yet so irrefutably tied to us. This resonates with me as an artist looking to memory, nature, and landscape, as a catalyst for drawing.\n\nLoan courtesy of private lender\n\nLois Dodd (b. 1927)\n\nNight Fishing\n\n1993\n\nOIL ON MASONITE;\n\nCloud Formation\n\n2009;\n\nFull Moon With Aura\n\n2017;\n\nMoon With Halo and Clouds\n\n2015;\n\nPale Moon – Streaky Clouds – Pale Sky\n\n2010;\n\nUp Road Night\n\n2012;\n\nWaning Moon and Agitated Clouds\n\n2010;\n\nOIL ON ALUMINUM FLASHING\n\nLois Dodd has long been fascinated by the sky, especially the night sky, an important subject matter for Ryder as well.

About how color can be felt in the modern body.\n\nLike Ryder, I work in small scale. The size of Ryder’s works is something we cannot discount – it showed a way for artists to make meaningful work that does not have to follow the hubristic Modernist macho project of expanding to fill a wall – art that looms over you, art that shouts. Instead, making small scale work can be an act of resistance – against the crass economies of scale, of amassing resources, of projection of power and might. Creating art that does not shout, but listens.\n\nLoan courtesy of Emily Auchincloss"
