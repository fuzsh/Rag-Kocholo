        "text": "Sumário | Versão PDF\n\nPaulo Herkenhoff\n\nTexto original em Inglês\n\nACID. Toxic substance used to produce intense ecstasy among a certain type of graphic artist, leading to dissociation symptoms (from the ideas of print and art), conserva tive aesthetics and an anesthesia of visual effect. It is broadly used in Latin America. Sometimes the graphic technical process is described as “kitchen,” a deprecating and discriminatory use of this word that indicates the domestic place traditionally ascribed to the feminine universe in the region. (See also SEX, DRUGS and ROCK’N ROLL.)\n\nADVERSITY. “Da adversidade vivemos” (Hélio Oiticica) “Of adversity, we live”.\n\nAFRICA. Many Africas were transposed in the diaspora and created many Latin Americans (See SUGAR), in the past and contemporarily. The mode of absorption and conflict in Latin America defined different degrees and types of consciousness, including terminology (See PEARLS). Social conflict resulted from forms of discrimination—like the pop ular classification by colour degrees between ethnic groups and within the group of African descendants. Since Colonial times certain manifestations of art were closed while others were open to Afro-Brazilians. In Brazilian culture, the sensibility of three people, who would call themselves mulattoes, account for: the best baroque sculpture of the Americas (Aleijadinho), the most important composer of the 19th century and musician to the Imperial Chapel (Father Jose Mauricio, Nunes Garcia) and the major writer (Machado de Assis). Personal qualities and the challenges of the social structure are given as factors that led to their accomplishments. On the other hand, in Latin America the ethnic differences (see DIFFERENCE and BRASILIDADE) are not dealt with as simply as in the North American model where society is divided in equal and separate entities built on the ground of the exploited classes. Therefore, in Latin America there is a different standard of exchange and sociability of heritage, whether it is Native, Afro, Spanish, Portuguese, whatever. The country would not tolerate it if a musician like Caetano Veloso were denigrated by an accusation such as “white people who think they’re black” Games Ledbetter). Unless homologation, such assertions would have no social ground. Cuban José Bedia, who has been initiated in Afro-Cuban rites, and Brazilian Cravo Neto, who has not, act under another ethical model, with the identification of the Negroes of Brazil and Cuba, which allows no space to any thought of “use of the Other'' or narrowing or distorting the self-representation of the Other. The Afro-Brazilian cults have created “white” orixas themselves. The word here is the alliance with the Other, since artists are seen as individuals operating with collective symbols and not with individualistic appropriations. Bedia deals with the conflicts and perspectives of the many encounters in the scene of the Americas. One should note that since the Revolution Cuba, under materialist Marxist social organization, has witnessed the richest and most complex art related to the Afro religious heritage. Following the Lam example, others should be mentioned: Manuel Mendive, Ana Mendieta, Bedia, Ricardo Brey, Belkis-Ayon. The photography of Cravo Neto can be like the construction of the orixas, the image being their apparition. Light and the affective gaze of the photographer constrain spirits which inhabit the ancestral body.\n\nAIRPORTS. In the exchange of art they have replaced ships in the business of styles and trends. Time has shortened. It took almost a century of colonization for the setting of the first painters in Ecuador (Bitti, Alesio and Medoro) and Mexico (Simon Pereyns). It took some decades for Pozzo’s ideas on perspective paintings of church roofs to arrive in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil (1737), while they had been used in Portugal since 1710. Impressionism took about twenty years to arrive in Brazil with Castagneto, whereas Expressionism took some ten years to be shown by a Brazilian, Anita Malfatti\n\nin 1917 (See WOMEN). Ships were faster and safer, boats more frequent, trips were cheaper and international exchange more intense. Now ideas travel by airplane and satellite. The speed has changed and when Latin American art is more known (See SECRET) ideas might travel both ways in a more balanced traffic.\n\nAMERICA. A plurivocal geographic denomination of a continent, in honor of the navigator Amerigo Vespucci, who was from Italy, a country which has not been involved with colonization. In the United States, the term has a double meaning: for the nation it stands for their own country G.e., the United States of America). However this has the pragmatic meaning of the western continent, when, under the Monroe Doctrine, the U.S. came to use the Big Stick of interventionism. In Latin America it is a univocal term meaning the New World, whereas the Monroe Doctrine was usually a unilateral application. To leave this clear some call Latin America ``Nuestra America'' (Our America). See LATIN AMERICA.\n\nANARCHISM. In the text “For an Independent, Revolutionary Art'' (1938), Andre Breton and Diego Rivera condemned the Soviet, the fascist and the neutral (“Neither fascist or communist”...) positions regarding art. They argued for a socialist organization of the productive forces together with an anarchist regime of freedom for individual intellectual creation (“Not any authority, not any constric-— tions, not any trace of ruling”). It is said that for tactical reasons Trotsky had his signature substituted for Rivera’s in this text. (See DICTATORSHIP and LIBERTY). The radical attitude of Frida Kahlo might have been formed in her adolescent years at the National Preparatory School when she was leader of the anarchist group “Los Cachuchas'' (1923). Quite often anarchism has served as a preparatory stage to\n\nother engagements with socialism, especially the Communist Party, which was usually created in each country after the initial expansion of anarchism. In Brazil, the work of Hélio Oiticica was based on anarchist fundamentals. His grandfather was the major anarchist leader of Brazil. At the age of fourteen the artist had already read such authors as Nietzsche and through his career he would show a growing awareness of the libertarian character of art (See BANDITS).\n\nANTROPOFAGIA. (see CANNIBALISM)\n\nARGENTINIDAD. “It is a mistake”, says Jorge Luis Borges in referring to the nationalistic demand of local colour in poetry. To deal problematically with the subject, he brings the example of the Koran where in spite of the absence of camels, one would not claim it as not being Arab: “I believe that we, the Argentineans, could resemble Mahomet, we could believe in the possibility of being Argentines without abounding in local colour. (...) The nationalists propose to venerate the capacity of the Argentinean spirit, but they intend to limit the poetical exercise of this spirit to some poor local themes, as if the Argentineans could speak only about villages and “estancias'' and not about the universe” (See EVERYTHING RHETORIC). The Venezuelan critic Rina Carvajal mentions that the Argentinean painter Guillermo Kuitca is not inspired by an autochthonous tradition, but comes within the context of an urban environment that seeks an international aesthetic and a contemporary visual language”. Kuitca, dealing with Western cul ture and history, shares Borges’s concept of problematic Argentinidad beyond the nationalistic fatality and the national mask.\n\nASIA. The Nirvana principle was taken from the Oriental philosophy by Hélio Oiticica in his CRELAZER proposition Csee TOYS), with the Freudian connotations. In the post war period, Zen became a value in criticism (Mario Schemberg) or art (e.g. Mira Schendel). In the seventies, Antonio Dias went to Nepal to work with the lokti fibers technique of papermaking. He developed a social geometry that considers the history and technology of the material, the organization of labour and the inventive results (Artisa social model to approach critically the organization of society and the place of art and artists). See also CHINA and JAPAN.\n\nBACON. Francis Bacon produced bacon all over Latin America. They were artists with a distorted painterly pathology of art as sliced flesh or meat, sometimes). Bacon was the leader for Argentinean Sbernini, Brazilian Siron Franco (1970's), or Venezuelan Alirio Rodriguez.\n\nBANANA. Plant originally from Asia, from the family of the Musaceae. It was introduced in America in the 16th century- In popular culture it has a very broad set of meanings Cerotic, depreciative, etc.). Brazilian Modernism was very dependent on bananas, while 19th century Academicism CAgohstino José da Motta and Estevao Silva) preferred watermelons (See WATERMELON). In one of the very few important paintings that she made in Brazil after returning from New York, Anita Malfatti presents, in her canvas Tropical (€c.1917), a basket of fruits from bananas to pineapple. “It is certainly the first time that the national theme is focussed within modern art in Brazil'', says Malfatti’s biographer Marta Rossetti Batista. Right after his definitive immigration to Brazil (1923), Lasar Segall introduced a joyful impressionistic landscape of a banana plantation with a certain post-cubist special character. In the “Anthropofagia'' of the late twenties (See CANNIBALISM), large banana-tree leaves with vegetal bodies dwell in the anthropophagous native landscape of Tarsila do Amaral Csince A Negra, 1923). These same leaves will appear in Livio Abramo’s early anthropophagous period woodblock prints. In the late sixties, Brazilian Antonio Henrique Amaral, after his Pop departure, slowly moved to a hyperre alistic amplification of bananas which are being submitted to painful operations (like being tied up or hung with string, or cut with forks and knives) as a metaphor for the dark political times of the prevailing dictatorship of torture and murder. The negative symbolism of Latin American countries as “Banana Republics'' Cas a post-Colonial alliance of local corrupt oligarchies, either civilian or military, with foreign interests and presently with United States interventionism) finally finds a morbid yet truthful portrait, in spite of some efforts of modernization in certain societies of the continent.\n\nBANDITS. In the work of Chilean Eugenio Dittborn, the images of bandits with their sombreros are taken as shadows. “Because the Chilean thiewes are the projected shadow of the civic hero with his hat, in a negative way, figuring the policy of the republican unconscious in its agents' ', says critic Justo Pastor Mellado (1992). Brazilian Hélio Oiticica made a box Bólide, “Homage to Cara de Caballo'' (1966) in honour of this bandit and personal friend. He said this work reflects a decisive and ethical moment, “an individual revolt against every social condition. In other words: violence is justified as a means of revolt but never as a means of oppression”. Oiticica is dealing with a repressive society that offers no hope to the dispossessed. Other artists in Brazil like Lygia Pape, Antonio Manuel and Luiz Alphonsus followed the idea of unlawful marginality as an index of social disequilibrium. Years before, the writer Clarice Lispector published her chronicle “Mineirinho” (1964):\n\nIs “Yes, I suppose it is within myself, as one of the representatives of us, where I should search for the reason why it is ailing the death of a malefactor?”.\n\nBAROQUE. The question is not to assert if, but rather how, the baroque has been a source for Latin American culture. Within this how, the question then should be the awareness of meanings and the limits, rather than the common ground of trite superficiality, formalism and imagery. Alejo Carpentier said that it was the generation of the forties CWifredo Lam, Amelia Pelaez, Mariano Rodrigues, Rene Portocarrero) who made the Cuban rediscovery of the baroque, of a potential baroquism in the environment from a stylistic mix into an exuberant vegetation, as in the work of Pelaez. In this sense, such an analysis could be made for most, if not for all, Latin American countries. In the prologue of the 1954 edition of The Universal History of Infamy, Jorge Luis Borges writes, “I would say that the baroque is that style which deliberately exhausts (what it wishes to exhaust) its possibilities and that hinders its own caricature”. Cildo Meireles in “Missao/Missoes, How to Build Cathedrals'' deals with the baroque period, but not\n\nwith the style. He approaches the rhetoric, the ethic and the strategy of baroque and therefore he questions the formalism of modernist baroque and most of the contemporary appropriations. The use of undated material dissolves the historical dating of “Missoes''. It can be either Colonial Baroque) or contemporary (“Postmodern”...), what we can now name as exploitation (See OPACITY and CHINA).\n\nBLINDNESS. “You are blind” (1972) is the provocative inscription on an object by Brazilian Waltercio Caldas. Instead of dealing with physical vision, the artist dislocates his work to the self-awareness of perception. Caldas dislo cates the crisis of perception from the erotic touch in the sculpture, as in a Braille’s standard reading of Brancusi, to the purely phenomenological approach. In 1989, Jorge Luis Borges said in a conference about Xul Solar: “I lost the vision as a spectator of Xul around 1950”. When he was presented, by Argentinian collector Jorge Helft, with a book about oriental art he said: “Splendid, many thanks. Even though blind, I will see it. To be blind is an accident”.\n\nBODY. O corpo é o motor da obra. (The Body is the motor of the work).\n\nBOOKS. “To the foreign blood, the book is aggregated, the ideal immigrant. (...) Whereas in colonial America Spain has conserved the monopoly of ideas in spite of the slow European infiltrations; in republican America, letters and industry come from all great exporter nations'', said the Peruvian Francisco Garcia Calderon (1913). The importance of books can be derived from such entries as PHILOSOPHY and WORDS. Yet when certain cultural artifices are connected with arbitrary ideas, their separation from life assumes the metaphorical image of the book: “No book\n\nCsee KODAK). Yet bread regains the character of condensed energy with Barrio in Brazil (1970). He left groups of loaves, tied with red string in dramatic spots: in landscapes, ona bench by a road, on a mound by a river, etc. Barrio worked with the idea of abandonment as a social strategy of occupation/definition of space. Before, he left bloody packs (reminiscent of corpses left by murderous police) to provoke tension in curious passersby. (See THIRDWORLDLINESS). Argentinian Marta Minujin made an “Obelisk of Sweet Bread” (1979) and the “Tower Bread of James Joyce'' (1980). In the latter case, she used 5,000 breads from Edmond Downes, the bakery mentioned by Joyce in Dubliners. In the former, Minujin recreates the central monument of Buenos Aires and makes it consumable by the inhabitants of her city. The deconstructive character is derived from the politics of material (bread is to be eaten) which conveys a “demystification, which is at the same time a rupture with what is enthroned in the public consciousness-— ness”, says Jorge Glusberg. Still in Argentina, Victor Grippo dealt with the production of this energy by building a brick oven, “The Bread Oven” (1972), with the collaboration ofa peasant, who made the bread and gave it to the public. Grippo articulates the signs of opposition (natural and artificial, urban and rural, etc.). He calls for the homo faber, either in alchemy or industry, in his quest for consciousness. In a continent of dualities, of plenty and scarceness, there is a predominant humanist manner in dealing with the symbol of bread. In his embroidery piece “The Bread” C1991), Leonilson has announced the precious quality of bread as a heart surrounded by words: ruins, temple and fisher of pearls.\n\nCANNIBALISM. The indigenous cultural pattern of cannibalism has provided Brazilian artists and writers of the 20th century with a source for a modern theory of cultural absorption: “Antropofagia'' (= cannibalism). The 1928 “Manifesto Antropofago'' (Cannibalist Manifesto) by poet Oswald de Andrade, taken from the painting Abaporu C1928) by Tarsila do Amaral states that only cannibalism unites Brazilians socially, economically and philosophically. The law of the man-eater indicates an interest in Otherness, unlike the importation of canned consciousness. In this stage of Brazilian modernism, it was no longer enough to update art with the international scene. A national culture would be open to devour any influence, to digest it for new meanings and possibilities. The primitivist model is transformed into a barbarian pattern against the oppressive censorship of civilization. Andrade advocates the permanent transformation of taboo into totem. References to Freud and Surrealism indicate the precedent he finds in Picabia’s cannibalism. In Brazil, the “Antropofagia project” has both historical and Sonic Uupo uy validity. It is a dialectic method which is far deeper than the superficial postmodern principle of image quotations.\n\nCARTOGRAPHIES. Artists in Latin America have used maps as a reference to the controversial social reality, rather than the flag, a conventional and unifying symbol of a nation, subjected to political manipulation. For Borges the map (Cin “Del rigor de la ciencia”) offered the possibility of substituting the failure of rational knowledge for the actuality of adjusting metaphor to reality, whereas Torres Garcia practices the inversion of the map (1936), with the intention of breaking the mirror (see ESPEJISMO) ina return to Latin America’s own values . The perpetuation of Mercator’s topographical conventions and distortions, in a science developed by the Conquest, are not innocent. The maps of Anna Bella Geiger register cultural domination with hegemonies and marginality. The painting of Guillermo Kuitca draws on many sources, from a Russian film (Eisenstein), a German dancer (Bausch) or an English song (The Beatles), overflowing the geographic borders or any boundary between the realms of artistic languages. The maps fix no point as they confirm a transiency of meanings from culture to the fantasmatic. Their function is inverted. It is no longer a description. Kuitca operates the revelation of the irreducible fluidity of the space of doubt and quest, of a world glowingly transitional and challenged by the\n\nawareness of the Otherness. Time is “never finished and is constantly changing” in the work of Kuitca (Rina Carvajal). Kuitca then has the opportunity to transform the map, in the Borges tradition, from the passive possibilities of the mirror into the crystalline action of the prism.\n\nCARNIVAL. “Le Carnaval de Rio est un cachet tout particulier” wrote Edouard Manet in 1849. “Le carnaval se passe d'une manière assez drôle; je m’en suis vu comme tout le monde victime et acteur”. Darius Milhaud arrived in Rio, where he lived for three years, on a Carnival day. Brazilian popular music would inhabit his future compositions. “The Carnival in Rio is the religious happening of the race”, said poeta Oswald de Andrade in his “Manifesto Pau-Brasil” (1924), his first major set of ideas for a theory of Brazilian culture. It was an aesthetic observation with a popular sense of colour. He observed the operatic character of Rio’s carnival, in which “Wagner would submerge”. Rio de Janeiro was the national modernist city for Brazilian artists, writers and musicians, no matter where they lived. It bore evidence of the past (baroque architecture) and the ethnic component in current cultural tradition, provided the tropical setting and the cosmopolitan circulation of ideas, and\n\nwas a national symbol as the country’s capital. Lasar Segall, Tarsila do Amaral, Di Cavalcanti and Oswald Goeldi found in Rio and nowhere else, the plurivocal city. Setting aside iconography as a point of departure, Hélio Oiticica took from the multisensory character of carnival the fundamentals for his art. Leisure and desire, physical structure and visual language, music and dance, body presence and perception, social marginality and tradition were contributions to the character of his art. Contemporary recording Industry and communication technology have imposed changes and challenges to carnival. In Rio de Janeiro, the visual aspect of carnival has been refined and the operatic aspect redefined. Consequently, a new kind of visual artist has appeared: the “carnavalesco”, who defines the plot of a parade and designs the costumes and floats, as conceptual and plastic metteur-en-scène.\n\nCENSORSHIP. See different forms of censorhip in canni balism, COLONIALISM, EROTICISM, TORTURE and WOMEN.\n\nCHANGE. “Change is the essential condition of existence” Lucio Fontana, “Manifiesto Blanco”, Buenos Aires, 1946).\n\nCHE. The revolutionary Che Guevara (1928-1967) was the only Pop symbol created in Latin America, with a world wide circulation as an icon for social utopia (see UTOPIA). Che Guevara recognized the specificity of culture and its passage through individual and subjective levels. Changing people into a New Man was necessary for the new culture of socialism and communism. For Guevara, the sense of cultural change involved the separation of the apparently natural spiritual reproduction, the existing violent circumstances and the conscious creation of new ways to produce, to think and to live. Labour, no longer being a commodity, should become art and game, says Esther Perez. As an icon, the figure of Che Guewara appears, for example, in the work of Cuban Raul Martinez and Brazilians Claudio Tozzi and Antonio Manuel. Guevara was reduced by mass media to one single phrase: “Hay que endurecerse, pero sin perder la ternura jamás”, which ended as a dissolution of his revolutionary thought. Against reducing Che Guevara to a neutralized iconographic image or a single phrase, Brazilian Hélio Oiticica reintroduces the idea of energy in “GUE VALUTA” (Guevara Struggle). This is a“parangolé”, which is a cape neither to be shown nor simply worn, nor is the body to be taken as a passive support of art. It is rather an “in-corporation” Swearing and dancing), an action-structure. The “Parangolés'' dissolves the dissociative idea of art and spectator to let the participant (See OTHER) emerge as a totality of energy and symbolism. The Argentinian Léa Lublin presented in 1962 the object “Ver Claro” (See Clearly - historical myths of fighters for liberty, with windshield wipers). In Lublin’s piece the Cuban Revolution is presented within an historical process, which the narrative character of the work, like a three-dimension-— al comic, allows. Che is not a myth, but a soldier of liberty. “See Clearly” alludes to the Marxist concept of ideology as a super-structural level of reality distortion. The glass, standing as an actual “veil of ideology”, is cleaned like a regular car windshield, as a metaphor of consciousness. a\n\nCHINA. Throughout the century international trade has provided Brazil with the possibility of Chinese influence in both direct and indirect ways, like in furniture. In colonial times, the religious orders Especially the Jesuits and Franciscans) introduced influences such as dragons (Rio de Janeiro) and pagodas (Minas Gerais in baroque sculpture or paintings). In the 20th century, Guignard organized his landscapes of mountains, colonial churches and fog in the manner of the Chinese vertical perspective. Currently, Adriana Varejao includes in her paintings this visual Chinese heritage by using fragments of Chinese porcelain or citations of roll paintings together with the baroque to reconstruct a critical history. In Cuba, painter Wifredo Lam, of African-Chinese origin, has produced a visual thesaurus of the orixas in his work. The strong contribution of Chinese immigration to the formation of Peru, led Francisco Garcia Calderon to propose (1913) the country be called Indian-Afro-Chinese-Iberian people, if the “pro genitory races'' were to be indicated.\n\nCIRCULARITY. See TIME and, for cultural geography, see CONTINENTALISM.\n\nCLASSICISM. In Brazil, the first traces of neoclassicism arrived in the jungle through the hands of the Italian architect Antonio Giuseppe Landi, who arrived in Belém, in the Amazon, in 1750. The Academy of Rio de Janeiro spread neoclassicism with such designs as the architecture of Grandjean de Montigny. The classic mythology can be found in Brazil in the paintings of Leon Palliére Ferreira, or in Chile with sculptor Virginio Arias. The contemporary approach to the classic art of Argentinian Marta Minujin deals with a two-way movement: deconstruction (fragmentation, fall, gravity) and reconstruction (like the “Venus of Cheese”) as a means of disturbing public mythologies. Brazilian Iole de Freitas, with her sheets of metal, touches the classical tradition of sculpture, dealing with “draperie” According to Paulo Venancio), as movement and appearance, or with the structural character of the “robe mouillée” type According to this author). The continuous interest in the myth of Icarus has been subverted in Brazil by painter Katie van Scherpenberg with the use of false perspective and Waltercio Caldas, with the object “The One Who Does Not Fly” (1977), where perception floats between the contradictions of the laws of physics and the aerodynamics of forms. In Brazil, critic Ronaldo Brito has approached the sculpture of Sergio Camargo by noting its “Aristotelian tonus”. These artists encounter a classical ideal in their investigation of perfection and not in search of Socrates’ idea of Beauty. In Latin America, as elsewhere, they do not take perfection as a canon, but rather cudgel this ideal to its boundaries. They clarify its (im)possibilities. They are suspicious of the Measure and of all certainty.\n\nCOCA COLA. In the sixties and seventies Coca Cola wasa negative icon of American imperialism in Latin America and a denial of difference between Latin America and the U.S. Whereas for Warhol, Coca Cola was a Pop symbol of the American liberal democracy, Latin American artists used it as a political symbol of imperialism. In Brazil, in 1970, Cildo Meireles printed in Coca Cola bottles, the motto of the decade “Yankees Go Home'' as a guerrilla intervention in an ideological circuit and process of production. Brazilian artists like Antonio Manuel dealt with the accumulation of empty bottles, by substituting urine for Coca Cola and Anna Bella Geiger situated the bottle in the landscape with trash. With their work they were dealing politically with the symbolic transformation of materiality (see ESCHATOLOGY). In 1992, to commemorate its 50th anniversary in Brazil, Coca Cola commissioned works, including artists from the sixties and seventies for what might have been the first neo-liberal exhibition in Brazil. In his effective “Crushed Coca Cola Bottle Bottled in Another Bottle of Coca Cola '', a visual metalinguistic game, the Uruguayan Luis Camnitzer fills the bottle with the horrifying liquid of crushed glass. Antonio Caro writes the name of his country (Colombia) in the traditional calligraphy of Coca Cola, white letters in a red field. He blends the ideas of Coca/Colombia, pointing out the “traffic” of drugs and sounds: cocaine/Coca Cola in a long history of United States intervention in his country, such as the forced separation of Panama in 1903 to facilitate the construction of the Canal (See COCAINE).\n\nCOCAINE. A fine white crystalline alkaloid powder obtained from the leaves of Erythroxylon coca, a plant farmed in some South American regions. For centuries the Natives from Peru and Bolivia chewed the coca leaves. Cocaine, absorbed by the mucous membrane, has a toxic action on the central nervous system. Among the effects it produces are anesthesia and disappearance of fatigue, increased mental power, euphoria and pleasant auditory or visual hallucinations. Addiction may develop and in some cases it has caused death. The cocaine business is a source of income for broad parts of the population in certain areas. The money from drug dealing is laundered in many ways, including through the art market. Some art sociologists and police reports mention the actual addiction of the art market in countries like Colombia, where the price of certain artists reaches high, fat, round prices, that would not correspond to their place in the international art world (See COCA COLA).\n\nCOLD WAR. Just confront DEPARTMENT OF STATE with ZHDANOVYCH.\n\nCOFFEE. “Depois de se haver fartado de ouro, o mundo teve forma de acticar, mas o açúcar também consumia escravos. O esgotamento das minas foi precedido, de resto, pela devastação das florestas que forneciam combustível nas fornalhas—a Abolição da escravatura, enfim, uma procura mundial crescente orientou São Paulo e seu porto para o café. De amarelo, depois branco, o Ouro se torna negro”. So Claude Lévi-Strauss resumes Brazilian history in Tristes Tropiques (chapter X). It was mostly agricultural capital from coffee that, in general terms, financed Brazilian modernism in Sao Paulo. As a theme, coffee produced comparatively little art: Portinari, Djanari, Malfatti in her decadence. The major translation of muralism and social realism was Portinari’s “Coffee” (1937), first as a canvas and later a decoration on the walls of the building of the Ministry of Education in Rio, a project that involved Le Corbusier, Lucio Costa, Oscar Niemeyer and others. Contemporarily, Oiticica projected the symbolism of coffee to a perceptual game of the senses in “Bolide Saco 2 Olfatico'', where gaze is oriented by smell (see ODOUR).\n\nCOLONIALISM. “Art is no longer an instrument of intellectual domination”, said Hélio Oiticica (1967). It is up to the artist to overcome postcolonialist aesthetics, in spite of the remnants of colonialism in the international circulation of art. Both the exclusion from history and an interpretation that includes references only to European sources are forms of colonialist censorship.\n\nCOLOUR. The undeniable alignment of Latin American artists with the Western history of colour could lead to such clear relationships as Soto or Oiticica with Malevich or Mondrian. Within this tradition (sometimes touching the question of the monochrome) we may still quote the con cretist, constructive or optical choices of colour in Cruz Diez (Venezuela), Negret (Colombia), Weissmann and Carvao (Brazil), among others. A picturesque colour may descriptively derive from reality as in the Mexican painter Rivera or the Colombian sculptor Botero. It can be emblematic, within national conventions and codes of tradition, like the orixas’ heraldic colours in Cuba or Brazil. Archeological colour rules the earthy palette of Brazilian Rego Monteiro, with reference to Amazonian Marajo6 civilization, whereas Andean artists Szyszlo (Peru) and Viteri (Ecuador) articulate historical colour from the fabrics, dolls and other sources in material culture and spiritual symbolism of the Incas and other groups. In Brazil, the purification of the colour system derived from popular culture established an anthropological dimension. It starts with the landscapes of\n\nthe Pau-Brasil period (1924), by Tarsila do Amaral, through the reductive and constructive colour architecture of Alfredo Volpi (1950/1970’s) and the sensory experience of colour as space and materiality in Oiticica (1960's). The harmonious colour compositions of a native naiveté by Tarsila do Amaral and Volpi synthesize a certain rural taste. In other areas, contemporary colour sensibility might call for more bright and strident combinations, as vigorous efforts to guarantee extreme visibility, like the recent work of Delson Uchoa in the Northeast, and Emmanuel Nassar in Amazonia. A crisis of colour finds a moral severity in the almost black and white portraits of Mexican Siqueiros, such as The Proletarian Mother (1930) and Ethnography (1939). Here the extreme scarcity of light and colour induces a\n\npolitical judgment. Ethical severity also impels the wood block prints of Brazilian Goeldi. The anguished light is the presentation of a moral night, melancholic in the urban drama of Rio de Janeiro and naturalistic, yet mythical, in the Amazonian scenario. The painful extreme of tropical light is approached by the opposition of the somber Goeldi to the solar Reveron in a complementary dimension like day and night. The antinomy of light/colour in Reveron’s paintings lays in the scarceness of pictorial matter. The Venezuelan brings the excess of light as an approach to blindness. The experience of visual bewilderment leads the gaze to the possibility of its own nullification.\n\nCOMMUNICATION. In the sixties, two major aspects of the theory of communication were influential to Latin American artists. Roland Barthes, with his contribution of the application of Structuralism to semiology, avoided the aridity of this field. In the studies of communication the influence of Marshall McLuhan also extended to Latin America. The expansion of television in countries like Brazil clashes with rural culture, meets economic marginality and is confronted with underdevelopment (See T.V.). In the sixties, some artists looked towards the traditional “literatura de cordel”, small leaflets illustrated with woodblock prints, that commented on everyday life and conveyed popular mythologies. Brazilian Samico took the graphic model and developed highly constructed images with heraldic and mythic characters. Anna Maria Maiolino used the graphic structure to convey discussions about the feminine condition and the situation of women. Antonio Henrique Amaral referred to the communicative character of the cordel, as a traditional medium to disseminate news and to produce bitter images criticizing military rule. In São Paulo, the studies of semiology in the University were the scholarly counterpart to concrete poetry. Later they were a conceptual background for the work of such artists as Julio Plaza and Regina Silveira, as an illustrative dialogue between theory and action. In Argentina, the problem of communication dealt directly with the role of the artist. The CAYC group Centro de Arte y Comunicación) held its first exhibition in 1972, with thirteen artists (Bedel, Benedit, Glusberg, Grippo, Gonzalez Mir, Marotta, Portillos; later additions were Maler and Testa). The work involved urbanism, his tory, social anthropology, phenomenology of time and materials, political consciousness and freedom. In the context of modern communications, it was understood that “the artist is the link in a chain which is extended above the concentric waves of man’s daily life. The powers which he manipulates maintain him in a position in which he can mold everyday reality (...) through action and thought and to create and transform social context” Gorge Glusberg).\n\nCOMMUNIST PARTY. The Communist Party had multiple, and sometimes clashing influences on the art of Latin America (See ZHDANOV for Mexico, and GRAMSCI). Waldemar Cordeiro, was himself, under the influence of the Italian Communist Party. The ambiguity of political works and the pretensions, moves from the involvement with right-wing populist power (like Niemeyer and Portinari during the Vargas regime in Brazil, or Guayasamin in Ecuador) to the bourgeois decorative work of Carlos Scliar and his action in the sphere of consumption, which in capitalism would be called marketing.\n\nCONSTRUCTIVISM. This term is taken here undera generic character. The idea of a widespread vontade construtiva (constructive will) can be synthetically demon strated. Upon his return to Uruguay, Joaquin Torres-Garcia developed a didactic work at the atelier (Asociación de Arte Constructivo) in Montevideo (1934-40), which was key to the formation (as “voluntary identification\") of the Buenos Aires groups Concreto-Invencion and Madi in the forties, whose artists exhibited in Rio de Janeiro (1953), where they influenced the scene (Ivan Serpa and the future Neoconcretist group Weissmann, Clark, Carvao, Castro, Pape and Oiticica, a student of the former).\n\nCONTINENTALISM. See NATIONALISM.\n\nCRISIS. 1492 sets a dual crisis. A multi-level crisis, from religion to knowledge reached Europe. A Portuguese map (1519) by Lopo Homem creates a southern territorial link\n\nbetween America and Africa, as a last effort to revalidate the Ptolemaic geographic notions. A permanent crisis was set for the natives of the Americas, from cultural survival to life itself. After independence, Paraguay underwent geno cide and strangulation from its neighbours. (See DOLOR, HISTORY and WAR). Brazilian Mario Pedrosa discussed the “Crisis of the Artistic Conditioning” (1966) due to the use of alien cultural roots. Pedrosa added that this crisis of modern art was due to the crisis in the levels of social function and communication (1972) (See POSTMODERN). Argentinian Jorge Romero Brest wrote La Crisis del Arte en Latinoamérica y en el Mundo (1974). He discussed the notions of crisis and development in art and stressed a dialectic contradiction between the order of human needs and the order of artistic demands. Besides the many specific crises that Latin American artists are dealing with, like perception (Waltercio Caldas and Alfred Wenemoser), the critic Nelly Richard points to a fundamental contemporary crisis. The Chilean group CADA (Colectivo de Acciones de Arte - Collective for Art Actions) (Raul Zurita, Diamela Eltit, Juan Castillo, Lotty Rosenfeld and Fernando Balcells) in the postulation of a “discourse of the crisis”, “had learned to mistrust any néw illusion of ‘totalitarian totality’: may we call it either revolutionary utopia, myth or ideology” CNelly Richard) (See UTOPIA).\n\nDANCE. Iconography aside From Tarsila do Amaral to Di Cavalcanti), Carnival (See CARNIVAL) leads Oiticica to the development of “Parangolé ''—structures to be worn and acted. Under the idea of dance and music, lies the project of art of total perception, of full assumption of the senses through the anthropological approach. The recent work of Tole de Freitas is built from the developments of the INWepo concrete project. There, in the past she worked with dance. Hier constructive gestures are movements that develop the sensual presence Of material. This is her point-—of-contact with the Oiticica experience. Freitas’ work should also be related to the investigations of the planar dimension in the work of Lygia Clark, from the two-dimensional picture plane CSuperficies Moduladas) to real space Casulo, Bichos and Obra Mole). The transparent constructive precariousness of her method has no connection with the well-engineered frontality of Frank Stella’s recent work, nor with his ideas of painterly image. Stella’s work is engineering and calculation, whereas Freitas is Open to improvisation and to the surprises of hazard. Freitas is dealing with time as a flow of both labour energy and poetical dialogue between body and mate-— rials, dance and art.\n\nDEATH. A Latin American Museum of Death should first include the “costumbrista” masterpiece of Francisco Oller <El Velorio” C1893). This “grande machine” of death is the wake of a child, in the baquiné tradition of Puerto Rico. Oller himself described the wake: “The mother is holding back her grief C...); she does not weep for fear her tears might wet the wings of this little angel on his flight to heaven. She laughs and offers a drink to the priest, who with eager eyes gazes up at the roast pig whose entry is awaited with enthuSiasm. Inside this room of indigenous structure, children play, dogs romp, lovers embrace and musicians get drunk”. The Mexican social pathology, like the Day of the Dead November 2) has been commented on by Octavio Paz: “Our cult to death is cult to life, the same way as love, which is hunger for life, is desire of death”. The print by Posada was engaged in satirical inversion, within the direct popular lan~— guage of Communication, like The Great Love Pantheon. Posada has included The Intelligent Engraver, his own profession, within The Artistic Purgatory. For Brazilian Goeldi, death is desacralized as it is in Posada, but submitted to silence, Comparable to Munch. Taciturn irony confronts the student with the social and moral Character of death in the work of Ensor. The Nietzschean “death of God” has set the work of Goeldi free from metaphysical afflictions or a “telos” of history. Yet metaphysics and melancholy are restored in the drawings of Brazilianm Ismael Nery, including his own death. The personal “mors certa” burdens an anguished Frida Kahlo. I'm the self-portrait Without Hope C1945), she lies covered with a blanket of cells and is fed from a cornucopia, that provides a bread “calavera” Skull. With Kahlo, the organic and anthropological, in a foreseen death, melt as that celebration of life mentioned by Paz. Death in the continent is now beyond the baroque imagery of passion and martyrdom. The social dimension of death in genocide circumdates La Paraguaya (c. 1880), as an island within an island amidst death, in the painting of the Uruguayan Juan Manuel Blanes. There is a moral rhetoric in this portrait of history (See HISTORY and WAR). Reacting to the Malvinas War, Argentinian Guillermo Kuitca depicts the individual pathos. Intimate recollections of the intense expression of grief, solitude and longing rebel in silence before the announced death; the impotence of the individual confronted by the absurdities of the modern State. Death, in the social struggle of Latin America, has a monument to ethos in the photograph of Manuel Alwares Bravo: Striking Worker Murdered (1934). The body is a fountain generously flowing with the blood of revolt and belief (See RESISTANCE). The death of the Other, dense with psychological implications, is in the chilling and powerful series of drawings. My Dying Mother (1947) by Brazilian Flávio de Carvalho. It is more dramatic than Kollwitz’s drawing The Death of Barlach (1938), in spite of its formal comparability. Kollwitz deals with a corpse, the death consumed. Carvalho’s is a cinematic series of images, where time still flows in terminal agony in the last gestures of life. If David’s The Death of Marat (1793), according to Argan, deals with the passage of the state of being to Nothingness, Carvalho’s depicts the final pulse of life in the eve of Nothingness.\n\nDEPARTMENT OF STATE. The United States Government organ for foreign affairs. According to Aracy Amaral: “It was not by chance that abstract expressionism had a world repercussion after the Second World War. During this period, in the midst of the Cold War, that ten dency was exalted by the painters of the Museum of Modern Art of New York, the traditional right arm of the Department of State in the cultural area”.\n\nDICTATORSHIP. Art dictatorships established aesthetic models as mandatory sources or monopolistic presences following the very pattern of governmental dictatorships.\n\nMost of the time they produced an alliance between the Stalinist aesthetics and right wing governments. They end up as the biggest market phenomena in their countries. Marta Traba mentions that Torres-Garcia has put Uruguayan modern art in the prison of this cold and desiccated idealism, with his ferocious civilist discipline (See CONSTRUCTIVISM). She also says that Guayasamin does to modern painting in Ecuador what the three great muralists had done to modern Mexican painting: “he imposes ter ror and establishes an aesthetical dictatorship, outside of which it seemed impossible to survive”. For Shiffra Goldmann, in the fifties the dense intimate graphic work of José Luis Cuevas represented a reaction against the public aesthetics of the muralists.\n\nDIFFERENCE. “Here I leave murdered distance”, says the Peruvian writer Alberto Hidalgo, “I am urged to declare that Hispanic-Americanism is repugnant to me. This is something false, utopic and mendacious (...) Besides, there is not even a similitude of characters between the Hispanic American countries. (...) The abyss that can be glimpsed between an Argentinean and a Colombian is incommensurable. That all are Spanish descendants, this is the least. The conquerors have imposed the idiom but not the spirit. The predominant ing influence is the land, the haphazard of the tribe with which the crossing was produced. (...) The immigrant from Russia, Italy, Germany, etc. is making or has made the truth ful independence. Within a few years there will be more American children of Russian or Italian descent than the children of Spanish (...)” (1926). Latin America is different. It is an internal difference (countries, regions, groups, individuals) and an external difference. Latin America remains for the West as a reserve of difference——exotic and at the same time “fantasmatic”. Yet, Latin America makes no promise of either staying or even being “Latin American”. A “Latin American” art of Latin America (“the essentially Latin American issues which it raises”, as proposed by Oriana Baddeley and Valerie Fraser) is either a European “fantas matic” construction or Latin American control (See IDEOLOGICAL PATROLLING). However, Latin American art does not confirm this European notion of history, of the “realization of civilization”, which is now Latin America’s, and no longer the modern European man (for this thought I’m indebted to Gianni Vattimo). The search for a single Latin America history can lead to fixed anthropological idealizations and also to the obtuseness of exploitation, internal colonialism and class conflicts, ignoring the variety of historical times (see TIME ) and cultural perspectives(See EVERYTHING).\n\nDISORDER. The source of disorder in Brazil could be found in an initial reference to the flag, with its motto “Order and Progress”. A parallel historical line could be traced with Flávio de Carvalho, Hélio Oiticica and Tunga, representing three different generations. Flavio de Carvalho disrupted the social codes with two performances: a) wearing a hatina procession (1931) and b) wearing a costume for tropical weather, which included a skirt (1956). He provoked both the religious ideological set of values and the masculine role, thus inflicting disorder in two main codes of social stability. Hélio Oiticica defined a level of metaphor between values from the art system and challenges to a social order that reflected an authoritarian regime. He dealt with a concept of “cultural diarrhea”. Favelados and samba school dancers were brought inside the Museum of Modern Art in Rio (1965) as a rupture to the spatial feud of art. In his Bolide Homenagem a Cara-de-Cavalo (1967) a transparent pillow of a vivid pure red pigment becomes a metaphor for the flesh of the bandit as “live mud”, as writer Clarice Lispector named it, for another bandit. (See BANDITS).Contemporarily, Tunga takes art as a model in crisis. His violent poetics is “outside of the formalist model”, dealing with an “inquié tante étrangéte”. Things play “between the real and the irreal, the conscious and the unconscious, the rational and the irrational” (The author is indebted to Catherine David in the development of this entry).\n\nDELODUR. Pain and grief are a root of Latin America since the first rape and murder of the Conquest. The Baroque rhetoric disseminated the edifying example of martyrdom through a hagiography of sorrow and suffering. From early colonization there were signs that this pathological social system was rejected by the Native, such as the Andean Guaman Poma de Ayala (See KNOWLEDGE). No social pain has fallen on any nation of Latin America as much as during the Paraguay War (1865-1870): the population of this country was reduced from 800,000 to 194,000, of which only 14,000 were male, and of those 2,100 were older than 20 years (according to Chiavenatto) (See WAR). The Uruguayan Juan Manual Blanes painted La Paraguaya (c.1880), a heraldic portrait of the defeated in history, who maintained dignity and energy towards the force of life (See HISTORY). The oeuvre of Frida Kahlo intermingles in symbolic autobiography the pain of joy for life, in such paintings as The Two Fridas (1939); abandonment in Self Portrait of Cropped Hair (1940), Henry Ford Hospital (1932) and miscarriage; Self-portrait as a Tehuana (1943), reflecting initiation and death (See MARXISM). In My Birth (1932) she enthones a painting of Mater Dolorosa. In 1970 Brazilian Cildo Meireles provocatively used the actual physical pain of living beings (chickens) to give voice to the silent cry of political prisoners under torture Csee TORTURE).\n\nDOUBTS. “In art, greater confidence is deserved by the works on the doubts of art, more than those on the certitudes of art”, wrote Argentinian Macedonio Fernandez. The contemporary counterpart is in Brazilian artist Waltercio Caldas: “There is a doubt which belongs to clarity”.\n\nDRUGS. See ACID, COCAINE and OPIUM.\n\nDUALITY. Where does the Third World end and the First World begin in this world? (Or vice versa) (See THIRD WORLDNESS). Is Latin American art in alignment with European and North American art? Or is it the setting of a local tradition? The Shakespearean dilemma evolves to “Tupi, or not Tupi, that is the question” (pronounce “to pe”), where the name of this Native people gives Brazilian poet Oswald de Andrade the possibility of condensing ina synthesis the fundamental doubt of national identity at the crossroad of cultures and historical times. (See CANNIBALISM. See also PERVERSIONS OF HISTORY.) Tunga’s installation “Palindrome Incest” (1991) claims to have the structure of the human mind. “I’m trying to annul the terms of exterior and interior, of inconsequential and consequential”, the artist devises (See DISORDER).\n\nDUCHAMP. “Already an old Buenos Aires! 2 months here”, wrote Marcel Duchamp to Walter and Louise Arensberg on November 8, 1918. “There is the smell of peace which is great to breathe (...). I have begun the part on the right side of the Glass (...)”. Latin America can be included within the impact of Western culture for Marcel Duchamp. Yet, no direct influence resulted on Argentine art. In most countries the life and perception of the object, under the Duchamp referent, would produce a long list, with varying levels of problems and results: Colombians Doris and Bernardo Salcedo, Maria Fernanda Cardoso, Brazilians Waldemar Cordeiro, Tunga, Edgard de Souza, Barras, Waltercio Caldas, Guto Lacaz, Jac Leirner, Waleska Soares, Argentinian Roberto Elia, Chileans Gonzalo Dias, Eugenio Dittborn, the early works of Venezuelan Jesus Rafael Soto. The idea of the ready-made was developed in other directions. Hélio Oiticica produced a series of “Topological Ready-Made Landscapes'' (1970). Critic Justo Pastor Mellado deals with the text lowered to the condition of a ready-made—read and made—in the work of Dittborn, according to the formulation of Jean Lancri. Cildo Meireles declares his admiration for Duchamp’s “3 Stoppages\n\nEtalon'' (1913-4). Meireles works in the inaccuracies, mis-perceptions and perplexities of the logics of measurements, as in his installation “Fontes' ' presented at Documenta in Kassel (1992). Cildo Meireles has devised the special approach to “him”: “Duchamp’s contribution today has the merit of forcing the perception of art, not as a perception of artistic objects but as phenomenon of thought”.\n\nENERGY. Spiritual, vital, physical power is at the core of the work of many artists. The physical energy of Latin American art is in the electricity of the kinetic work of Brazilian Palatnik, Argentinian Le Parc or Chilean Castro Cid. Yet it surpasses the formalization of mechanical forces as in Gyula Kosice’s hydro-kinetic sculptures. The importance of these experiments in Latin American history might be a hidden reminiscence in Modernist time of Futurist dreams (See Futurism). Before that, in Buenos Aires, Kosice C“Royi '', 1944) and Diyi Laaff (1946) were producing artic-— ulated Madi sculpture and painting with changeable mechanical structures, manipulated by the public. In Latin America, however, there is an art moved by the energy of another quality. In general terms, Lucio Fontana defined some of these principles: “The new art demands the functioning of all energies of man in creation and interpretation. The Being manifests itself integrally, with the plenitude of its vitality” (Manifesto Blanco). During Brazilian Neoconcretism (1959), the idea was that “the body was the\n\nmotor of the work”, with complex implications on the level of individual perception and potency required by the Louvre de Oiticica, Clark and Pape (See BODY and EROTI CISM). The installation of José Bedia articulates direct mythical archetypes within their ritualistic development. They should be seen as energy, because they are like “qmedicine”, “since their aura is not originated from the self-mystifying intention of the postmodernist ego, but rather from a sacred potency, both undoubtful and alive”, Says critic Osvaldo Sanchez. Another Cuban artist, Ricardo Brey, leaves aside any iconographic, descriptive symbols and reiterative performances of Afro-Cuban rites to work on the idea of a flow of symbolic energy. Argentinian Victor Grippo takes the model of the development of Nature, taking the daily function of potato as food (See ESCHATOLOGY). The potato, being submitted to a pulsator, generates electric energy (0,7 volts each) and they might also sprout. The world is a symbol of man’s potential to produce consciousness. For Latin American men, since the potato is originally from the continent, the work suggests the search of an autochthonous culture, nourished by the energy of symbols.\n\nEROTICISM. A history of eroticism in the art of Brazil has begun to be written. Ivo Mesquita curated the exhibition “Desire in the Academy 1847-1916”(1991). He wrote in the catalogue that that may be because the Brazilian character is not so given to anguish and sublimation, or because sexuality permeates the whole social life of the country, either in the conservatism that attempts to hide it, or in the catharsis of TV soap-operas and Carnival, which liberate and celebrate it; in Brazil an art of erotic Character has never been under privilege. In a masochist continent, as a general circumstance, women had very little space for the overt reference to eroticism. Thus the work of Chilean sculptress Rebeca Matte (1875-1929) gains an additional importance in the circulation of desire. Overt circulation of desire still seems more authorized in the work of males where it is more frequent, as in the work of Leonilson, Kuitca, Davila, Galan, Zenil and Miguel Angel Rojas. Whereas in the drawings of Leonilson they are the subtle revelation of a nostalgia of the Other, in the work of the last four, through certain processes or thematic fields, such as homoeroticism, there is a direct political clash with the Latin American Patriarchy. In another dimension, Lygia Clark dealt with the sensory experience Of touching) involving given objects, which in her work O Corpo éa casa (the body is in the house, 1969). “It is the human being who assures his/her own eroticism”, she writes, and “he/she becomes the object of his/her own sensation”. ESCHATOLOGY. The Discovery found a continent with a great variety of cosmogonies, some of which were very receptive to the unknown Conqueror. The eurocentric Christian character of the Conquest impetuously inscribed a new and tragic destiny for whole societies. The violent process of genocide, catechization and conquest, transformed the Counter-Reformist instrumental character which benefitted colonial projects. Behind this move, there was a confirmation of the historical eschatology. From such a point of view, the Conquest has enticed a permanent eschatological conflict, with the superimposition of a self declared, universal, ultimate destiny for man. Deprived of its theological doctrinaire compromises, a poetic eschatology appeared in Latin America. It dealt with “last things'', with an ultimate destiny. The work of Argentinian Victor Grippo operates the eschatological transmigration of energy from nature (potatoes, a source of energy and probably the major contribution of America to the diet of Europe) into art (a European concept introduced by colonization). The artist reached his radical point when he actually ate an over one-thousand-year-old potato from a pre-Columbian Andean grave. Grippo, within a cosmic perspective, dislocates the pattern of naturalistic eschatology to the level of symbol, breaking a vain, repetitious cycle. In Venezuela, Alfred Wenemoser mixes the ashes of hospital trash with cement to build installations. A complex materiality, under an eschatological transience, is unified as a constructive matter, which, however, can never face its history of pathos. It rather incorporates a conflict of symbolic temperatures of the neutrality of cement and the phantasmatic impregnation of life and death in the ashes. Moving from engineering to architecture, that conflict of materiality finds its final embodiment in the paradoxical spaces that Wenemoser renders to experience in his installations. Brazilian Jac Leirner steals objects from airplanes to set them in a new order under an unexpected logic, as if they lived the search for their final place. A column of piled glasses refers to the “Endless Column” of Brancusi and to the fate of things and art as a Parousia. The organization of soap, perfume bottles and toothpaste tubes, as well as air-sickness bags, deals with the administration of body odours within both aircraft and art. For Leirner art is a “place” for things, as their ultimate destiny with the attainment of a perennial symbolic status, i.e., becoming art, a “last thing” within a system of signs of consumption. Among other Latin American artists dealing with eschatologies, such names should be mentioned: Juan Davila in Chile; Miguel Angel Rojas in Colombia; Barrio, Antonio Manuel and Ivens Machado deal with direct human eschatology; Rosangela Ressno (the semiotic eschatologies of unidentified, found photographic negatives) in Brazil.\n\nTunga deals with a feces-rolling scarab (“rola-bosta”) and perfume, for a project in the Amazonia. “This confrontation has found its just metaphor in the small coleopter, the small scarab, which is necrophagous and coprophagous and produces a sphere which is a kind of a moon around which it develops its gravitation”, says Tunga. “It would be the confrontation between human eschatology and the eschatology of the physis' ', he adds.\n\nESPEJISMO. Spanish term derived from “espejo” (= mirror) to describe that tendency in Latin American culture of reflecting foreign dependency or influence, usually from the hegemonic Northern hemisphere countries. Jorge Luis Borges speaks of the “passive aesthetics” of the mirrors and the active aesthetics of the prism. For a theory of cultural absorption see CANNIBALISM. The trend of “quotations” in art in the eighties distorts the “reflecting” character of many artists.\n\nEVERYTHING. “Everything human is ours”, said the Peruvian Mariatégui (1926). In the prologue of The Book of Imaginary Beings, Borges writes: “the name of this book would justify the inclusion of Prince Hamlet, the point, the line, the surface, the hypercube, all generic words and maybe each one of us and the divinity. On the whole, almost all of the universe”. Elsewhere Borges says that “We may touch all European themes, and to touch them without superstitions (...). I repeat that we should not fear, we should think that the universe is our patrimony and try all themes”. For Borges, Xul Solar lived recreating the Universe. One may now conclude that everything could be a genuine source for art in Latin America, because it has the right to the universe, plus it holds a secret (See SECRET). Borges offers the broadest challenges to the imagination of many artists, be they Argentinians Kuitca, Porter or Bedel) or non-Latin-American (Kosuth). In his Biblioteca de Babel,\n\nBorges deals with a library where we may find that every thing expressible in any language has been printed. One generation after the other has gone through the library in search of the Book. Some called this library Universe.\n\nEXCLUSION. The writing of art history is an exercise in power of exclusion as well as inclusion. Someday, like the history of the defeated proposed by Walter Benjamin, one should write the history of those excluded from the dominant art history. This would include such artists as Gego in Venezuela, Oiticica, Clark, Lygia Pape and Amilcar de Castro in Brazil, or some from the Madi group in Argentina.\n\nEXILE. Uruguay is the country in Latin America where the great synthesis - national, universal, political, or historical - is produced abroad from Modernist Torres-Garcia and Figari to contemporary Gonzalo Fonseca, Camnitzer, Capelan and Gamarra. With his series of prints “From the Uruguayan Torture”, a violent set of metaphors extracted from innocent, daily circumstances which gain iconic meaning, Camnitzer transforms the voluntary exile into a necessary exile.\n\nFALLACY.[1] There is no such thing as the monster called \"the expert in Latin American art\".\n\nFOLKLORE. In Latin-American Modernism Folklore played a major role in the realization of the national project. In 1920, composer Darius Milhaud advised Brazilian composers of the richness of popular and folkloric sources. Heitor Villa-Lobos and Francisco Mignone researched folklore themes like the Argentinian Alberto Ginastera in his early Oeuvre. Tarsila do Amaral has taken the sense of colour in peasant architecture, while Uruguayan Pedro Figari painted the Afro dances of Candombe in his exile. Writers, from Mário de Andrade to Guimarães Rosa listened to the popular voice. Mexican Orozco was critical of certain nationalist relationships between the art of the muralist and folk-art: “Painting in its higher form and painting as a minor folk art differ essentially in this: the former has invariable universal traditions from which no one can separate him... the latter has purely local traditions.” The recourse to folklore became an easy conservative and reductive cross-cultural experience. Against this impoverishment, Hélio Oiticica would warn that the capes ``Parangolés ``''rises since 1964 against the oppressive folklorization using the same material which formerly would be folk-Brazil' '. Yet, Oiticica newer ceased his reference to genuine cultural exchange, as in his transparent Yemanja tent in Eden (1968-9), rich in sensual experiences connected to symbolic meanings. On the political level, critic Nelly Richard observed that the artistic action of CADA, the Chilean group Colectivo de Acciones de Arte, and the Avanzada did not seem as threatening to the dictatorial authorities in the Pinochet regime as popular forms of communicating such as theater and folklore.\n\nFUTURISM. First great door to Modernism in Latin America, perhaps because its direct rhetoric is so clearly connected with the industrialization and modernization of society. Chronology: February 20, 1909: Marinetti publish es the “Futurist Manifesto'' (Le Figaro, Paris); one month later (March 26) Romulo Duran publishes an interview with him Gin Comoedia magazine) and later (November 15, 1909) an article about this new literacy school in Tegucigalpa, Honduras ; less than 45 days after (April 5), Ruben Dario discussed Futurism in Buenos Aires (the poems of Marinetti are “violent, sonorous and wild”) and in the following days Sousa Pinto commented on it in Rio de Janeiro; in August, Mexican Amado Nervo mentions “the iconoclast vanity” of the new literary school; Henrique Soublette in Venezuela July, 1910) and Chilean poet Vicente Huidobro (1914) discuss Marinetti in their countries. 1921 is a curious year. It witnesses a radical rejection and a fruitful adoption of Futurism in the cultural strategies of Latin America. In May, 1921, Borges refers to the passive aesthetics of the mirror and to the active aesthetics of the prism. “In the present literary renovation, Futurism with its exaltation of the cinematic objectivity of our century, represents the passive, tame tendency of submission to the medium”. Yet to the art historian Annatereza Fabris, “Futurism is assumed by Brazilian Modernists in Sao Paulo as a combat weapon, since 19251, due to the negative charge which it contained”.\n\nGEOMETRIES. The many geometries of Latin America include the “Geometria caliente” of Argentinian Torres-— Arguera, “geometría sacra” of Colombian Carlos Rojas, “Afro-minimalism” of Brazilian Emanoel Araujo (named by American critic George Preston, who did not consider the possible allusion to Brazilian Concretism art), social geometry (art environment as a social diagram for the Brazilian Antonio Dias) or the designation “Geometria sensible”, first used by Argentinian critics Aldo Pellegrini and Damian Bayon that is widely employed for the affective approach to geometric rationality as it commonly happens in Latin America. In such cases, Torres-Garcia is the archetype.\n\nGHETTO. Beyond the historical ground and identity (See LATIN AMERICA), the setting of specific space as an authorized territory for the expression and self-representa-— tion of ethnic groups and minorities may end. Exhibitions could become a geopolitical strategy, resulting in prison camps for art. Patronizing appreciation then ascribes intellectual quality to the confines of an artistic ghetto with a calculated ethnic apportionment. The Brazilian artist Tunga has declared, “Geographically I am a Latin American and professionally I am an artist. Because all art belongs to mankind, the attempt to organize thinking about art in geo graphic or geopolitical terms is, at best, a crude approxima-— tion of what art really represents to the human spirit”. Artists like Cildo Meireles, Alfredo Jaar or Juan Davila are engaged in revitalizing and giving voice to the ghetto.\n\nGLOSSARY . This glossary comprises a selection of entries and is necessarily incomplete due to the vastness of the object (See UNIVERSE) and to the universe of references that one single artist can always involve. A second level of incompleteness is in each entry, quite often vast fields in themselves. Therefore most entries are presented in abridged form or with partial examples. This is either due to space limitations or because most entries indicate the possibility of an issue. Hardly any entry would either exhaust the theme as an absolute source or be universal in Latin America. The internal differences have to be considered at this point, even between areas of a single region. Deep social contradictions in a society of class affect art and the question of its neutrality (See NEUTRALITY). There is a plurality of responses besides mere “engagement”. On the other hand, innumerable sources are neither exclusive to Latin America nor even situated within the continent. There is no purity or impurity in the process of enrichment\n\nof experience. Geo Politicizing is a “coarse solution”, as alluded to by Tunga. However, this historical, political, social and cultural territory, in spite of its moving boundaries (See LATIN AMERICA), is a geographical frame of the discussion that is surveyed by History. In technical terms Latin America is a geographic subcontinent of the Western hemisphere, yet it is dealt with here as a cultural continent. Latino-americanidad should not serve the idea of multicul\n\nnaturalism as a policy of compartmentalizing the ethnicities, by separating and dividing the one oppressed in relation to the other oppressed, under the same perspective of devaluation. Multiculturalism should be denounced when it imposes Opacity Over determinant class differences. Cross references serve also to eliminate repetitions. Yet certain fundamental quotations might have been brought in more than one entry, due to the autonomous character of a source. A reiteration of certain paradigmatic names occurs. This is due to the reality that artists, even if not compared, have different qualities and that some are founders of the local tradition of art, or are sustaining positions of radical or unmatched importance. The given examples do not encompass all the possibilities for a certain subject. This glossary was written for The Winnipeg Art Gallery CCanada) in complement to the exhibition “Cartographies'', curated by Ivo Mesquita. However, the text does not discuss exclusively the participating artists in this show. Some\n\nwidely accepted or known terms, like Futurism, are not explained on the assumption that the public is aware of their meaning. This glossary doesn’t intend to be a general theory of the origins of Latin American art. It is intended to address the general public, and less the scholarly or initiated audience. There, the text ends up being a list of the author’s doubts. Sometimes the entries are colleges or converging positions, or they might be the ongoing building of a problematic issue. The entries are then scattered notes on diverse themes in alphabetical order. The author is deeply indebted to Ivo Mesquita, Jon Tupper and to the Winnipeg Art Gallery. The initial commission of a ten-page paper on the theme of sources of Latin American art evolved into this Glossary as an autonomous publication. The author also wishes to allude to the extreme openness of those individuals in accepting a personal way of writing which allows\n\na level of play and implies, in that confession, deep insufficiency, what Theodor Adorno mentions in his Minima Moralia (1994). The author wished a transparent operation with his net of prejudices, intuitions, apprehensions, self corrections, anticipations and exaggerations, as Adorno has appended, which are never clear in the process of production of knowledge. The author did not invent the “UNIVERSE” (See entry), therefore many art critics are purposely quoted in order to denote a network of investigative thought around Latin American culture, which is sometimes very controversial. The limited horizons of the author are also dealt with in the entry BRAZIL and therefore omissions in examples should not be seen necessarily as dis crimination. They conform to the part of the announced incompleteness of this glossary. Counterposing the numerous mentions of Brazilian artists, the specific entry about Brazil somehow hides the country. An initial limitation\n\nresults from the fact that it was originally written in English, when Portuguese is the master language of the author. Hopefully cataloguing a mutable taxonomy in alphabetical order will not send the reader away even if it is an incomplete glossary under a double perspective: if it goes half-way in the recognition of a place it will have accomplished an impossibility in the ever-growing world of cultural exchanges. This glossary is an ongoing project. Published here is a selection of existing entries from a list which now comprises over two hundred and fifty terms. The author hopes to publish an expanded version of this text in the future.\n\nGOLD. Contemporary Latin American art deals with pluralistic gold. In the phenomenology of Italo-Brazilian Mira Schendel, gold is a corporeality in the painterly surface, condensing physical properties, symbolism, light and value. Gold is the alchemical element for the speculative work of Argentinian Victor Grippo. It is necessarily a symbol, not a sign, within the idea of transmutation and a metaphor for the meanings of art. In Percevejo Cerveja Serpente (1980) gold is the strategic game of Cildo Meireles, where the verbs to be (ser) and to see (ver) are drawn to each other in a continuity of sounds and meaning. Tunga has surrounded the Sugar Loaf mountain in Rio de Janeiro with a thin lead ring and from there sprinkles gold powder over the city. As a counterpart, in the headquarters of the commissioning insurance company, he left a torus of lead that also contained gold. This complex work, Toro Economico C1983), with the alchemical metals, poses an incisive political question: is something whose location is known but which can-— not be recovered more secure than something that can be removed but whose location is unknown? In Brazil, in the 18th century colonial past, gold produced an imperfect pearl. (See PEARL and COFFEE).\n\nGRAMSCI. Italian Marxist who studied the organic connections established by intellectuals with the fundamental groups responsible for social production. Gramsci only briefly observed the existence of small groups of traditional intellectuals (clergy and military), attached to rural groups in Latin America. Waldemar Cordeiro, an admirer of Gramsci, organized the Concretismo With Geraldo de Barros, Sacilotto, Lauand, Fiaminghi, Nogueira Lima), the main art movement in Sao Paulo in the 1950 's. Cordeiro himself searched for the Gramscian organic intellectual in civil society in the fast growing and industrialized city of Sao Paulo. Concrete art should aim for objectivity and eliminate every individualistic trace by approaching the logic of industrial production. New theories of communica-— tion and linguistics (See COMMUNICATION) and forms of representation (Nouveau Realism and Pop) led Cordeiro to a revision. The Brazilian dictatorship and social crisis of the 1960’s were other compelling factors. Cordeiro’s “concrete semantic objects'', are his reaction to the failure of all utopias established on a technological basis. Cordeiro, remaining a Gramscian, developed a new utopian synthesis: “In the modern world, the means of production and the communication media should be the same for everyone in all places'' (1965). In Chile, says Justo Mellado, there has been a renewal of painting with José Balmes (See WINNIPEG), which represents positions inspired by the thought of Gramsci, beyond the recommendations of the Latin American Section of the Communist International. The modernizing attitudes of Balmes represents, for Mellado, a meaningful relationship between painting and Marxism.\n\nHESSE, EVA. And also Beuys, Serra, Kieffer, Palermo, Andre, Klein, Manzoni, Kounellis, Bacon, Reinhardt, Newman, Tapiés, Johns, Warhol, Stella, Baselitz, Paladino, Cucchi, Haring, de Kooning and many more are just a few of the post-war references. The “postmodernist” trend of quota tion set the artists free regarding ghosts of influences, references and plagiarism. A world without boundaries, in spite of the challenge of the differentiation within a totalitarian trend, makes no shame in claiming interest in a non-Latin American artist (SEE IDEOLOGICAL PATROLLING). This means neither a denial of specificities and cultural tradition of its own in Latin America, nor an uncritical approach (to anyone from anywhere). There is hardly any difference between a regionalist purity of sources and an interest in Bataille or Klossowski. In one of his many texts, Hélio Oiticica made an appraisal of references (as precedents, differences, parallelisms) between Brazilians and non-Brazilians regarding “The Transition from Colour in the Picture to the Space and the Sense of Constructivity” €1960’s): Kandinsky, Tatlin, Lissitzky, Malevich, Pevsner, Gabo, Mondrian, Klee, Arp, Taeuber-Arp, Schwitters, Calder, Kupka, Magnelli, Jacobsen, David Smith, Brancusi, Picasso, Braque, Gris, Boccioni, Max Bill, Baumeister, Dorazio, Etienne-Martin, Wols, Pollock, Tinguely, Schoffer, Nevelson, Klein, Barre, Bloc, Slesinska, Pasmore, Herbin, Delaunay, Fontana, Albers, Agam, Tomasello, Kobashi, Lardera, Isobe di Teana, Vassarely, de Kooning, Rothko, Tobey (See UNIVERSE). A Puritanism of Latin American sources finds no support in reality. So they are sources and resources, plus Matisse With talc). Brazilian Waltercio Caldas proposed an open art book about Matisse with talc spread on top of the images. The apparent constraints to the vision blossom in the problems of perception—that of a lucid and transparent ontology of opacity.\n\nHISTORY. The Brazilian Cildo Meireles wrote about his work Cruzeiro do Sul: “I want someday all works to be looked at as hallmarks, as remembrances and evocations or real and visible conquests. And whenever listening to the History of this West, people will be listening to fantasmatic legends and fables and allegories. For a people who can transform its History into fantasmatic legends and fables and allegories, that people have a real existence”. (1970). The Uruguayan Juan Manuel Blanes, with his painting Paraguay: Image of Your Desolate Country (c. 1880), the so-called La Paraguaya, is the image of a defeated nation, presented with historical truth, dignity and no self-pity. Blanes, as far as history is concerned, is a painter that anticipates the writing of a “history of the defeated”, as proposed by Walter Benjamin.For the Argentinian artist Luis Felipe Noé the artist is “an instrument of history”. “The artist”, he says, “is not a rebel against history, but one who makes it”.\n\nHISTORY OF ART. See EXCLUSION.\n\nHISTORY OF LATIN AMERICA. The critical understanding of the peripheral situation of Latin America in the age of Late Capitalism, as a contemporary dimension of the colonialist legacy, leads many Latin American artists to an awareness of being agents of history. Within a dialectic praxis we may join the work of such artists as Luis Camnitzer (Uruguay), Gonzalo Dias and Eugenio Dittborn CChile) or Cildo Meireles (Brazil. No neutrality is allowed in their project of deconstructing the opacities of history, where, finally, the oppressed and defeated would have a place.\n\nHISTORY OF LATIN AMERICAN ART. In spite of previous denials (See SECRET), from the continent or abroad, the art of Latin America also substantially nourishes itself\n\nfrom the History of Latin America which is a tradition in its own right and can be observed in constructive art (See CONSTRUCTIVISM). The work of the atelier of Torres— Garcia in Montevideo, Asociación de Arte Constructivo (1934-40) was key to the formation (as voluntary identification) of the Buenos Aires groups and Madi in the 1940's, whose artists exhibited in Rio de Janeiro (1953) and influenced the Brazilian Neo-Concretist artists. The , neocon cretist group CAmilcad de Castro, Clark, Pape, Oiticica, Weissmann) is a reference for the artists of the seventies in Brazil (Cildo Meireles, Antonio Manuel, Iwens Machado, Waltercio Caldas, Tunga, Fajardo, Jose Carvalho, Iole de Freitas) on many levels, such as ferromenology, poetics, aesthetics, philosophy and ethics Cand less in formal aspects). Younger artists (Jac Leirnmer, Fernanda Gomes, Ernesto Neto, Waleska Soares, Frida Baromek) refer to both previous generations as well as to other international art movements. In Brazil, this is a cultural dynamic of transformation of ideas rather than a series of aggressive ruptures.\n\nHORROR VACUI.\n\nICONS. During the sixties two major manichean Pop icons symbolized the politicization of art: Che Guevara was a positive symbol for social utopia, whereas Coca Cola was developed as the negative symbol of imperialism (See CHE, COCA COLA and PAN AMERICANISM). Currently, Frida Kahlo becomes the icon of the Latin American woman and for her effort to break through social constraints. S\n\nIDEOLOGICAL PATROLLING. Constraints and controls of the ideological engagement in art activities. This has been denounced by such artists as Hélio Oiticica, film director Glauber Rocha and composer Caetano Veloso. It may establish such mandatory canons as nationalism, wretched mess, popular themes, third worldliness and a cynical denial of interest in the work of foreign artists (See HESSE). It may take the form of a press boycott or the over-throwing of directors of national institutions for visual art. In its most violent form it attempts “cultural murders'', as defined by Glauber Rocha.\n\nIMPOSSIBILITIES. Viewing the geographic, political or cultural situation, the blind repetition of certain aesthetic positions is practically impractical in Latin America. For instance, Oswald Goeldi, the major Brazilian printmaker, would never insert a romantic primitivism in his expressionism. Goeldi had spent his childhood in the Amazon, where his father had introduced Darwinism in the systematic studies of the region. For Goeldi, nature was removed from edenism and metaphysics. The only possibility was to have it symbolize pathos, as in Munch.\n\nINDO-IBERIAN AMERICA. A term proposed for Latin America in an editorial of the Mexican magazine America Indigena Cvol. XIX; no. 2, April 1959): “The name Latin America can suggest that those who inhabit this great territorial extension are individuals who descend only from the so-called Latin European peoples. (...). We believe in the name Indo-Iberian America, since its inhabitants are descendants both of Indians and of ancestors from the Iberian Peninsula, or rather Spanish and Portuguese”.\n\nINFERIORITY. Art and attitudes can be representations of a feeling which derives from the colonial past. Ocatvio Paz mentions as a Mexican characteristic, “an instinctive distrust regarding our own capacity” that we could extend to other areas. The Brazilian film director Glauber Rocha said that a Brazilian or a Latin American who was educated watching Hollywood has the desire immediately mirrored in the cinema. “There is a great influence of Hollywood in Brazilian cinema, such as the wish for grandeur. From Hollywood we accepted neither its grandeur, nor its development, nor even its sophistication. What we have always refused from Hollywood was its colonialist ideology” (1981).\n\nINSTABILITY. With the social frailties, external exploitation, political corruption and arbitrariness and the continuous transformation of things, an ambiguously fascinating and menacing nature develops as a sense of impermanence. Time promises no continuity. Where things sometimes are apparently stagnant, Hélio Oiticica responded to a process of art as crisis saying that “of adversity we live”. The ideas of the precarious, of instability would pervade Brazilian culture, notes Carlos Zilio, for whom Oiticica operated a “permanent deconstruction and disarticulation of the categories instituted by art, without looking for a resolution or synthesis”. Ibrahim Miranda Ramos takes the specific cosmoconic character of insularity in his native Cuba as the ambiguous movement of a sea algae that both moves and stays. The Island is also a lizard, as an entity endowed with the ability to camouflage itself. In Rio de Janeiro, the sculptor Ivens Machado builds large sculptures with popular construction materials (cement, stones, broken tiles, iron) that become Beings of precarious equilibrium and frail life. Like the shanty houses in the favelas, they seem in imminent collapse. The urgent disaster defines Machado’s work as a diagram of the instability of Brazilian social structure. This conflictive state between precariousness and a wish for stability is also in the sculpture of Frida Baranek. Finally, these two sculptors deal with a fragile social landscape. In an order of more abstract values, the works of Venezuelan Jesus Rafael Soto, says Guy Brett, are metaphors of age-old problems: the relation of the real and the illusory, of chaos and order; at the same time they suggest a new equilibrium beyond a static geometric order. Some of the sculptures of Brazilian Jose Resende confer clarity to this instability. They are structures/circumstances where gravity of superimposed parts meets equilibrium, or where the cold paraffin retains the form. This is the case of a paraffin column that retains the wrinkled form of a piece of leather. The transparency of the method and the range of the risks confer on the work of Resende a rare character of sociability. It is then time to remember Machado de Assis (“Memorias Postumas de Bras Cubas” 1881): “There came an air blast, which wins in efficacy the human calculus, and there goes everything. So runs the fate of men”.\n\nINSULARIZATION. Cities and continents can be insular ized in the international art system. “I play chess alone right now”, wrote Duchamp to the Arensbergs during his sojourn in Buenos Aires (1918/9) as if he were sitting on the desert, Andean landscape. The geographic isolation of Manaus in the jungle and La Paz in the Andes, the boycott of Cuba, the long political, economical and cultural process of suffocation of Paraguay with its neighbours, in the 1870's after the war (See CRISIS and HISTORY) are denotative of the circumstance of exiled societies and groups. However, the island of Cuba has transformed its insularity into a cosmogonic character, like in Brazil where cannibalistic modernism gave a character to cultural exchange. In his painting Visión de la Isla desde lejos (1991), painted abroad, José Bedia depicts the image of an island-man. Cuba is now embodied in a mythical mountain-individual: nature flourishes from his body, labour energy flows in boats, trains, airplanes; life abounds from the archetype. Two Cuban artists, Ibrahim Miranda Ramos and K-cho presented the problems of the historical and contemporary environment. The latter makes maps of Cuba in the form of kites and baskets. There is an Aristotelian character in this transportable space. K-cho’s Cuba is seen as transparent structures and devices for the movements of the imaginary. Ramos’ metamorphoses turn maps of Cuba into archetypal lizards. For Ramos, Cuba has a long history of dictatorship, bribery and lies (See INSTABILITY). The reinforcement of this unstable quality and the spread of incredulity in history have enabled the Lizard-Island to survive as an identity and to dwell in the poet Lezama Lima’s “invisible gardens'' of the “insular night”.\n\nINTERNATIONALISM. See UNIVERSALISM.\n\nINTIMISM. Against the expected excess in Latin American art (like colour, politicization, violence, popular culture, etc.) there is an art of recollection and silence. Xul Solar, with his delicate watercolours, can be considered the most inventive personality of Argentine modernism (See UNIVERSE). Oswald Goeldi, through his drawings and wood block prints, developed in solitude the densest moral por-\n\n‘ trait of the country and the most rigorous career without experiencing decadence as most Brazilian modernists did. Goeldi is now in exile from history, sentenced by historians. The work of Cuevas appeared as the reaffirmation of the possibilities of small size, of concentrated fantasmatic images in opposition to the large images of muralism (See DICTATORSHIP). The nature work of Brazilian Leonilson is a minimal cartography of private encounters Cand disen counters), where the desert is the intimate vastness of solitude, or where the globe can be an imperfect pearl. There are no routes for the revelation of a topography of sentiments, except for the discrete course of the lines. His works are confessions of a silent being, for whom every figure is the ephemeral port of desire. Pleasure and pain are the accidents of this intimate relief. His intimism is disturbed by the discrete tension between a state of innocence and a sharp irony.\n\nJAPAN. The growing Japanese immigration was taken with suspicion by some pioneer Latin-Americanists in the early 20th century. Peruvian Garcia Calderon preached that “The Japanese hegemony would represent for the nations of America a mere titular change. (...). Powerful and traditional, the Japanese civilization would strongly impose itself on the problematic Latin democracy”. Japan’s presence in Latin America displays the best and the worst aspects. During his stay in Rio de Janeiro (1931), Japanese painter Tsougouhara Foujita left many influences including those on Candido Portinari’s portrait paintings of that period. In the early contributions of Japanese artists in Brazil, the work dealt primarily with landscape and portraits. There was a difficulty in embracing nativist themes, yet there was a need for absorption into the national society. Thereby images that were too “foreign”, i.e. clearly of a Japanese character, were avoided. As well as others, there was the artist Takaoka Haminagai. Nippo-Brazilians introduced a new character in the 1950’s and 1960’s with the calligraphic gesture of Manabu Mabe, the silent spaces of Tomie Ohtake and the plurivocal sense of Flavio Shird’s painterly action that connects Japanese calligraphy and memories with Amazonic lianas and French gesturalism. In Brazil we may refer to many other artists (Wakabaiashi, Kusuno, Okumura, and in Argentina to abstractionist Kasuya Sakai). In Brazil, Zen principles are observed in the non-logical character of some works by Mira Schendel. On the negative side, the Peruvian dictatorship of Fujimori completes the wide range of the incorporation of Japanese heritage and descendancy in Latin American identity.\n\nKNOWLEDGE. The native Andean Felipe Guaman Poma de Ayala wrote an 1188-page long illustrated letter between 1585 and 1615 to King Philip III of Spain describing and denouncing the abuses of the Spanish conquest. To write and illustrate, Guaman Poma had to learn Spanish. According to van de Guchte (see her text in the catalogue Guaman Poma de Ayala, The Colonial Art of the Andean Author, New York, 1992), he showed a “huge array of widely dispersed tracts of sixteenth century knowledge”: moral theology, law, geography, and papal and dynastic European history (See RESISTANCE) “Trenches of ideas are worth more than trenches of stones”, said José Marti,a moral designer of Latin America in 1891.\n\nKODAK (provisory entry). With the invention of colour transparency, a consequent hyperrealism was spread in Latin America, as elsewhere. Mannerism, virtue, pseudo elegance fed this kitsch painting. These products, wrapped in eroticism, historical genres (bodegon, vanitas), are soulless seductions. Their main circulation is in the catalogues of auctions for an uninformed Latin American market. The reader who would not consider that as art is entitled to delete the entry from this Glossary as would the author himself.\n\nLABYRINTH. From the North to the extreme South, a continent wanders between the Labyrinth of Solitude and the Labyrinth itself, as if a totality of diverse fragments were a continuum from Paz and Borges. Hélio Oiticica situated himself in a flow of desire: “I aspire to the great labyrinth”. LANDSCAPE. The widely disseminated political character of Latin America has been observed from conceptual art to the theme of the body and landscape genre. This caused a strong impression in non Latin Americans like Oriana << Baddeley and Valerie Fraseft: “(€...) the landscape of Latin America has been and continues to be the scene of bitter tensions, conflicting interests and terrible loss of life”, like in the work of the Uruguayan Gamarra. The dramatic conclusion, derived from history and social structure, should not reduce landscape in Latin America to a scenario of political disputes. Quite often the foreign gaze has difficulties in seeing beyond the exotic and the literary and towards a subtle landscape. Phenomenology, pathos, poetical light, complex sym-— bols and signs, solitude, vastness and the void are the values that would exemplify Venezuelan Reveron, Mexican Dr. Atl, Brazilians Guignard, Goeldi and Tasila do Amaral and more recently Colombians Carlos Rojas and Villamizar. Space loses the monopoly of mere physicality to become a conceptual place of instabilities and strangeness, where sensory experiences can descend to the depths of fantasmatic circulation.\n\n(THE) LAST OF THE MOHICANS. The novel about Indians by the North American writer James Fenimore Cooper (1789- 1851) has been the authorized model for much art and literature in Latin America. A good example is the bronze statue Campolican (1869) by the Chilean sculptor Nicanor Plaza. This Indian shows very few characteristics of his tribe, the “Araucanos'' of Chile. Brazilian Rodolfo Amoedo even painted The Last of the Tamoyos (1883), where the last Indian receives spiritual salvation from a Catholic priest, since there was no survival from genocide.\n\nLATIN AMERICA. A continent of moving boundaries. Some are under dispute (Malvinas versus Falklands). Argentinian Kuitca has interpreted the individual distress and abandonment, the pain and silence which originated in the Malvinas conflict. Other limits are shrinking, especially in the jungle. This results from the Yanomani territories, recently established in areas of what are still “Brazil'' and “Venezuela''. The tension regarding the present territorial rights of Natives has raised the solidarity through art works by artists such as Brazilians Cildo Meirelles, Bene Fonteles and German Lothar Baumgarten.Claudia Andujar has chosen to live among the Yanomamis, to turn her photography into a weapon for their benefit. Other frontiers are expanding Northward: they already comprise 25% of the population of Texas, as territory gained by the means of an “illegal” act (now migration instead of war, as dealt with by Chilean Alfredo Jaar and Uruguayan Luis Camnitzer, respectively) (See WAR). Frida Kahlo, with Self-Portrait on the Border Between Mexico and the United States, is a master geographer defining the limits and differences between two cultural universes, from history to nature, economy and ideology. This glossary is not intended as a geographic phone directory of numerous specific national characterizations such as Argentinidad, Chilenidad, Cubanidad, Guatemalan Dad, Mexicanidad, Peruanidad, etc. (See ARGENTINIDAD, BRASIL, GLOSSARY and MEXICO). LATINO-AMERICANIDAD. Just to turn into a problematic issue what seems to be a univocal question, we may recall the Brazilian critic Ronaldo Brito who speaks of the nostalgia of a pre-logical phase: “It is current for example, for Latino TL American Dad ideology to be marked by a desire to return to some pre-Greek period to recover the telluric forces which were crushed by rationalist European colonization. What can be done with such a simplistic cultural proposal?” (from “Waltercio Caldas Jr. Aparelhos, Rio de Janeiro, L979 p=153).\n\nLIBERTY. This is a synonym for art in Latin America. Analyzing Duchamp, Mexican Octavio Paz concludes that \">The condemnation to see oneself is converted into the liberty of contemplation”. For the Brazilian critic Mario Pedrosa “art is an experimental exercise of freedom.”\n\nLIGHT. Tropical light was introduced in Dutch painting in the century of Rembrandt by Frans Post (1612-1680), who visited Northeastern Brazil during Holland’s domination. Impressionist and Post-impressionist painters travelling to America have also directly experimented with tropical light: Gauguin, Pissarro, Degas and Manet (“je n’ai vu plus belle nature”, Rio de Janeiro, 1849). Ivo Mesquita observes that in Latin American impressionism there was not the mild light of Giverny, but strongly contrasting colours. For the emotional character of light in Oswald Goeldi see PATHOS. Electric light was not a Futurist depiction in Latin America, but an actual plastic value. In the forties Gyula Kosica, of the Argentine Madi group, built sculptures constructed with neon or fluorescent light bulbs, preceding by a number of years the Minimalist work of Dan Flavin. Political light, derived from the ideological unveiling of reality, is the subject Gonzalo Diaz presented in this exhibition. The chiaroscuro of David’s Death of Marat (1793), suggesting the passage of a state of being into nothingness (Argan), is a historical diagram for Diaz and Mellado Protocolo 3 (1984). In “Cartographies'', Diaz presents an installation “Yo soy el Sendero Luminoso, besame mucho”. The fourteen stations of this “Via Sacra'' present arches crowned by golden hammer and sickles that lead to the sentence “I am the Shining Path''. Sentimentalism is substituted for rationalism in these times when capitalism triumphs universally through the totalitarian dissemination of the ideology of “the death of ideology” in neoliberalism. Exploitation is represented in one stuffed coyote sculpture, political action becomes photographic memory and labour represented by an anvil is still the sole presence. The theater of the apparently solved contradictions faces reality, in the presence of a tool, with which human labour produces energy and social tension.\n\nMADNESS. “Mother Madness, crown us with sparks!” (Manifiesto Euforista, Puerto Rico, 1922). The first exhibition of modern art by a Brazilian artist, Anita Malfatti, was criticized in Sao Paulo in 1917 by critics such as Monteiro Lobato, with the dismantling question “paranoia or mystification?”. For him new art could be nothing but abnormal or monstrous like something coming from the madhouse, except that here “such art is sincere, the logical production of brains troubled by the most strange psychoses”. Asa coincidental icon of this cultural conflict, one of the major paintings by Malfatti is A Boba (The Dumb) (1915/16). Right after the Second World War, the Jungian psychoanalyst Nise da Silveira started an extensive program of art therapy in a mental institution in Rio de Janeiro. This led to the creation of the “Museum of the Images of the Unconscious”, now holding over 300,000 drawings connected to the “innumerable states of the Being”. Among the interned, one did paintings of black squares on a white field in constructive rhythms. Silveira had the support of two young artists: Almir Mavignier and Ivan Serpa, both engaged in the early movements of geometric art in Brazil. Mavignier later went to Germany to get involved with the Ulm School of Design and the Zero Group. Serpa, who became the teacher of Hélio Oiticica and Waltercio Caldas, developed his work towards constructive ideas. It is thus important to note that in Rio de Janeiro, the seeds of concretist art and rationalist logic were in a psychiatric hospital. In the late 1960's Brazilian artists dealt extensively with madness as a cultural value in a repressive era of dictatorship, such as Antonio Manuel in his film “Loucura/Cultura” (1973). Cildo Meireles made a “zero cruzeiro” bill, a worthless bank note bearing the image of an Indian and an intern of a psychiatric hospital. This announced the fact that those were two segments to which Brazilian society gave no value at all. In Argentina the fierce dictatorship which employed torture and political murders, was fought by women. They were mothers, wives or sisters of the disappeared ones. They would strike in front of the government house, bearing white shawls on their heads, embroidered with the name of their beloved. Every once in a while, one would loudly cry the name of her missing relative. For their untamed and fearless demands against an all powerful and totalitarian state, they were called “Las Locas” (the crazy ones).\n\nMANIFESTO. Latin America adopted the European modernist strategy of writing manifestos as tactical declarations of principles against conservative force or opponents, or as an effective social means of circulating ideas. Some hundreds of manifestos in all fields from art to music were written on the continent. Manifestoes were intended to give “visibility” to ideas. When art historians take exhibitions and manifestoes as the sole or main historical process, they are distorting the cultural dynamics. (See OPACITY). This unconsciously reflects the Latin American literary tradition in dealing with art. Manifestoes are not the absolute source of art and this produces a shadow (see OPACITY) over isolated artists like the Brazilian Oswald Goeldi, certainly the most rigorous Brazilian spirit in modern art from the 1910’s until his death in 1962. (See INTIMISM). That distortion by national historians leads to“a second wave of opacity with foreign authors quoting the former. They have fallen into the trap of “manifests”,"
