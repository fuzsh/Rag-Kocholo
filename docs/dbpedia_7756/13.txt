ENHelena Romer-Ochenkowska was an author and a journalist, also known from her public and educational activity. She descended from a landed gentry family well-known in Lithuania, studied in Krakow at Łucja Żeleszkiewicz boarding school, then in Ecole Hautes Science Sociales in France. Having returned to her homeland, Helena settled in Vilnius where she worked as an author, journalist and educationalist. She spent the years of WW1 in her family's estate in Karolinow, as well as in Vilnius and in Warsaw where she helped the locals and was involved in actions aimed at regaining independence. After the war she lived in Vilnius where she continued her literary and publishing activity and took part in the public life of the city. After WW2, Helena departed to Poland and settled in Torun where she died on 26th March, 1947. Helena Romer-Ochenkowska left five memoirs which, most probably, were written during WW2 and are now stored in the Manuscript Department of the Wróblewski Library of the Lithuanian Academy of Sciences. The first volume contains the authors reminiscences of her mother and father's families in Karolinow and the neighbouring estates in the late nineteenth century. Other volumes describe the life in the interwar period. The memoirs are an important source for daily life of landed gentry under the rule of the Russian Empire. [From the publication]
