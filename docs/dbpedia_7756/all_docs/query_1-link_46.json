The support of the British Academy over a number of years has enabled me to visit many record offices in Britain, Germany and the Czech Republic. Without this support the research would not have been possible. Encouragement and help has come from many people and it is impossible to give due credit to them all. However, Phil Cottrell has given great encouragement and shared his extensive knowledge of modern Czech economic history. On at least one occasion he directed me to sources I would not have known about otherwise. Understanding the history and cultural background of German-Czechoslovak relations has been a formidable task for an Englishman. Without the help and encouragement of Miroslav and Libuše Chleboun and the many other Czech and Slovak friends, especially colleagues and students at the Obchodný Fakulta of Slezska Univerzità in Karviná in the Czech Republic and the Akademia Vzdelavania in Bratislava, the task would have been impossible. I am grateful to them all. Polish friends, especially Zigmunt Rakowski, have helped me to understand the history of Czech–Polish relations in the politically sensitive part of Northern Moravia and the continued (fortunately muted) tensions there. The other area in which individuals have been crucial to this research has been in archives and museums in the three countries. Many people have been very helpful and have gone out of their way to obtain\n\nCrowhurst_Prelims.indd vi\n\n7/3/2013 3:08:50 PM\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n\nvii\n\nimportant documents.

Approximately six months later German troops occupied the remaining part of Bohemia and Moravia and declared it a German protectorate. Czechoslovakia had existed for little more than 20 years. For many Germans, it was a state that should never have been created. In some ways it was the product of unforeseen circumstances rather than a gradual and inevitable political process. Earlier, in the second half of the nineteenth century, there had been a rise in Czech nationalism, which reflected growing Czech financial power as industry developed. The Czechs built a national theatre, created savings banks and other financial institutions, established large cultural and social societies and demanded a greater share in the government of Bohemia, where Czechs were in a majority. But Czech politicians were not united and the Germans were able to deny them any significant increase in political power. During the First World War, contrary to later Czech claims, Czechs generally served loyally as soldiers in the Austrian army. There were no mass desertions and when Czech prisoners in Russia asked to fight against the Austrians, their request was refused. It was only later, when Tomáš Masaryk visited Russia, that the Czech Legion was formed, but it did not see service in the First World War. However, there were Czechs who fought with distinction in the French and Italian forces and these had helped to raise the political profile of Czechs by the time the war ended.\n\nCrowhurst_Introduction.indd 1\n\n7/1/2013 4:23:51 PM\n\n2\n\nHITLER\n\nAND\n\nCZECHOSLOVAKIA\n\nIN\n\nWWII\n\nEmergence of the Czech state Within the traditional Czech lands of Bohemia and Moravia, Czech politicians demanded autonomy, not independence, during the First World War. It was the decision by US President Wilson to create nation states – the right to self-determination – that significantly changed the situation, though Britain did not want the Austro-Hungarian Empire to collapse. The Emperor of Austria Franz Joseph offered the Czechs autonomy, but he was too late. The first step towards the creation of a Czech and Slovak republic was taken by Czech politicians independently in Prague. When the fighting was coming to an end in October 1918, the Romanian military garrison in Prague returned home. On the 28th the Prague National Council, consisting of representatives of all political parties, proclaimed itself to be the new government. The following day the Slovak representative, Dr V. Šrobár, was appointed a member of the Council. He was a supporter of Tomáš Masaryk, a former Professor of Philosophy at the Czech University in Prague, who had become the leader of the Czechs in exile during the war. Šrobár declared in Turcˇanský Sv. Martin that ‘the Slovak nation is both by language and history a part of a united Czechoslovak nation’. This laid the basis for a single Czech and Slovak state. The Council elected Masaryk as the first President of the democratic Czechoslovak Republic. He returned to Prague on 21 December 1918. But the new state had to wait for official recognition from the Allies and the boundaries had to be decided at Versailles. There, the Czech and Slovak delegations were invited to present their case for defining the new state and the frontiers were established by the treaties of St Germain with Austria (September 1919) and Trianon with Hungary (June 1920). These treaties created the First Czechoslovak Republic and guaranteed the rights of all citizens, including the minority Germans, Hungarians, Poles and Ruthenes (Ukrainians or Little Russians). But the creation of this new, Czech-dominated state roused fierce antagonism among the German population. Not only did they lose their former dominant status, but many felt that they were being unjustly denied the right to self-determination that had been given to others. They thought little of Czechs in general and even less of Slovaks.\n\nCrowhurst_Introduction.indd 2\n\n7/1/2013 4:23:52 PM\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n3\n\nGerman opposition ranged from sadness to indignation. The picture of Emperor Franz Josef that had hung in every school and public office and was a familiar sight to all Germans was replaced by one of Masaryk, who was virtually unknown to them. Many Germans felt so strongly that they tried to join their areas to the adjoining German or Austrian provinces. But this attempt to break away and ignore the treaty of St Germain was crushed by former members of the Czech Legion, who had fought in France and Italy. Many Germans fled and there was some loss of life. The result was that Czechs regarded Germans as politically unreliable and never gave them the full legal rights enjoyed by Czechs and Slovaks. This remained a source of discontent throughout the short history of the First Czechoslovak Republic. It reflected anger on both sides. Austrians demonstrated in Vienna against ‘Czech tyranny’ in 1919.1 The feeling was mutual. The Czech attitude towards Germans was reported by Michael Spencer-Smith, sent to Prague as representative of the Bank of England to negotiate the transfer of the assets of the Anglo-Austrian bank. He wrote: ‘The hatred of the Czechs for the Austrians is intense and colours every thought and action. The Austrians are treated like dirt ...’2 German politicians, reflecting this mood among their compatriots, initially refused to take any part in the political process of creating the new Czechoslovak Republic.\n\nThe industrial development of the new state Although the Republic was riven by deep political divisions, in theory the new state had many economic advantages. It had been given the major part of the industries of the former Austro-Hungarian Empire and had a well-educated and experienced population to exploit them. What proportion of these were German and Czech it is impossible to state with any certainty, for many ambitious Czechs had learnt German and became assimilated into German society as a means of gaining economic and social advantages. There were similar problems over ethnicity in the Slovak lands, where Hungarian had been imposed as the state language and the Slovak language and culture suppressed. What is clear, however, is that in the Sudeten area along the German and Austrian frontiers, there was a wide variety\n\nCrowhurst_Introduction.indd 3\n\n7/1/2013 4:23:52 PM\n\n4\n\nHITLER\n\nAND\n\nCZECHOSLOVAKIA\n\nIN\n\nWWII\n\nof successful industries: coal mining and quarrying, chemical, textile, glass and porcelain, civil and mechanical engineering and musical instrument making. In reality, many of these faced serious difficulties in the new state. In the textile industry, for example, some spinning and weaving mills were now separated because they were in different countries. Some manufacturers had to import raw materials instead of buying them within the former Empire. All faced the difficulty that they could produce more than the new Czechoslovak Republic could consume, and the surplus had to be sold abroad across tariff barriers, which reduced their competitiveness. The new successor states (Austria, Hungary, Romania and Yugoslavia) were anxious to establish their own industries and used tariffs as a way of excluding Czechoslovak competition. The former tariff-free Empire, stretching from West Bohemia to Romania and from southern Poland to the Balkans had disappeared. Many of the workers in these factories facing new competition were Sudeten Germans (Germans living in the western border area of the new state). Unemployment, or the fear of it, increased their antipathy towards the new Czech-dominated government, which appeared to have little interest in their problem.\n\nThe creation of the new Czechoslovak currency The first priority for Alois Rašín, the new finance minister, and the government was to establish Czechoslovak control over the state’s assets. A census of the population and their property was carried out to see what these consisted of. The next step was to isolate the country from the economic uncertainty and inflation in the neighbouring states. The frontier was officially closed to prevent the movement of currency into or out of Czechoslovakia and all banknotes in the country were overprinted. These became the only form of legal money in Czechoslovakia. The next step was to replace these overprinted notes with new ones and fix the exchange rate of the new Czechoslovak crown in relation to other currencies. All this was carried out smoothly and efficiently, though the initial exchange rate was too high. The new currency created economic stability and Sudeten German businessmen and workers were able to see the benefits of\n\nCrowhurst_Introduction.indd 4\n\n7/1/2013 4:23:52 PM\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n5\n\nbelonging to the new state in comparison to the uncertainty elsewhere. As a result, the attitude of the Sudeten German population began to change and their politicians became more willing to take part in Czechoslovak politics.\n\nThe transfer of industrial control The Czechoslovak government also wanted to establish control over the state’s assets, especially its industries. Originally these had been financed by Austrian and Hungarian capital and, until the First World War, Vienna had been the centre of Central European finance. As a result, Viennese banks were major shareholders in Czechoslovak companies, whose head offices were situated in Vienna. Rašín ordered that all head offices of Czechoslovak companies should be moved to Prague and this was followed by the transfer of shares from Vienna to Prague. This was only possible because foreign capital was invested in Czechoslovak companies and banks. The difficulty facing Czechoslovakia was that the Czech banks were not as large as the Viennese. Before the war Prague had been no more than a provincial capital. There were large Czech investments, but they were mainly in savings institutions and not in commercial banks. The largest Czech bank, the Živnostenská banka, was a major investor in Czech industry.3 The second, the Agrární banka, attracted the funds of small agricultural, financial institutions, especially local agricultural companies and credit cooperatives. Others, formed before the First World War, specialised in different areas of business and had been helped by a wave of nationalism in 1903, which had led many Czechs to transfer their investments from German to Czech banks. The Czechoslovak government solved the problem of national control by ordering that branches of Austrian banks in the new Republic should become Czechoslovak institutions and sever their links with the parent banks. The result was that Czechoslovak banking in the interwar period consisted of Czech banks, led by the powerful Živnostenská banka, several Czech-German banks, some German banks and one Anglo-Czech, the Anglo-Czechoslovak Bank (formerly the Czech branches of the Anglo-Austrian Bank).4\n\nCrowhurst_Introduction.indd 5\n\n7/1/2013 4:23:52 PM\n\n6\n\nHITLER\n\nAND\n\nCZECHOSLOVAKIA\n\nIN\n\nWWII\n\nForeign investment in industry The replacement of Viennese by Czechoslovak capital was only possible with large American, French and British investments, some of which were in banks (which owned companies’ shares) and companies. Before the war, Britain, France and Germany had been the major creditor nations in the world, but after 1918 Germany was replaced by France.5 Britain was still the largest investor, but most of British capital went to the British Empire. Comparatively little British finance (8 per cent) went into Europe. On the other hand, more than half of all French investment (60 per cent) was in European business. The USA, also a major financial power after the First World War, also invested considerable sums in Europe – much more than France – but these only amounted to 30 per cent of American overseas investments. But this only tells part of the story. Foreign investment in Czechoslovak business was by no means evenly spread. Some industries were more important economically and strategically. One was mining and metallurgy – coal, iron and steel – and Britain invested far more in this (61 per cent of foreign investments) than any other foreign country (second was France with 15 per cent).6 Closely linked to the iron and steel industry was Škoda, which had been the main armaments industry in the Austro-Hungarian Empire. One of the main Allied concerns at the Versailles peace negotiations was that this should not be owned by Germany or Austria. Immediately after the Versailles Treaty had been signed, the French company Schneider et Cie bought 73 per cent of the shares.7 Thereafter, when more were issued, Schneider bought some of them. Although the French majority holding was never in doubt, it was not clear what proportion the French company owned. French ownership of the majority of the shares did not However, mean that the French dictated commercial policy. The French were content that their control of Škoda, as in other French investments, had prevented it remaining in German hands. This French interest in strategically important industries was not confined to Škoda. One of the other important French investments was in the oil industry, which was becoming more important with the development of motor transport after the First World War.\n\nCrowhurst_Introduction.indd 6\n\n7/1/2013 4:23:52 PM\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n7\n\nThe French bought control of Apollo, an important company that refined Romanian oil.8 Founded in 1895 in Bratislava, the company was Hungarian, with headquarters in Budapest. Apollo bought Romanian oil, transported it by barge via the Danube, refined it at its own refinery in Bratislava and produced paraffin and lubricating oil. These were carried by rail to markets in the main cities and manufacturing centres in the Empire. But by the end of the First World War the company was also beginning to produce petrol. In 1924 the headquarters were moved from Budapest to Prague and the company was registered as Czechoslovak, with a share capital of 7 million Czechoslovak crowns. Finance for this transfer came from France: the Societé Français des Pétroles de Malopolska and the Crédit Générales des Pétroles. Motoring developed in the 1920s in Czechoslovakia: cars were made by Laurin and Klement (later bought by Škoda), CˇKD (Cˇeskomoravské Kolben Dane˘k) and Tatra. These companies also made commercial vehicles. Besides these there were smaller firms such as Aero which made lightweight two-seaters, and others which manufactured rudimentary canvas covered vehicles (cyclocars). Motorcycles were made by Jawa and other small firms. All helped to create a market for petrol and Apollo decided to have its own petrol stations. The firm increased its capital in 1925 to 12 million crowns (60,00 shares) and used the additional shares to merge with a Czechoslovak company which owned petrol stations. French control of Apollo thus gave it an important stake in the Czechoslovak industrial economy. The rest of Czechoslovak industry was dominated by three companies: Vítkovice Mining and Foundry Works in Ostrava, the Mining and Metallurgic Company in Trˇ inec and the Prague Iron company in Kladno. These produced virtually all pig iron, and almost threequarters of steel and rolled products. All were very large conglomerates, owning coal mines, coking plants and related industries. Like other companies in the Austro-Hungarian Empire, they had formed a cartel before the war and continued to dominate the industry during the First Republic, gradually absorbing most of the smaller producers. Their evolution from Austrian to Czechoslovak companies shows how the change took place.\n\nCrowhurst_Introduction.indd 7\n\n7/1/2013 4:23:52 PM\n\n8\n\nHITLER\n\nAND\n\nCZECHOSLOVAKIA\n\nIN\n\nWWII\n\nVítkovice had originally been founded jointly by the Viennese branch of the Rothschilds and the Guttmann brothers, Viennese financiers. After the war, although the shares were still in the same hands, all accounting was done in Paris and the company’s representative was Eugène Rothschild.9 The Viennese branch of the Rothschilds had transferred much of its capital to Paris and it was the Rothschilds rather than the Guttmanns who set the pace of modernisation and increased the company’s efficiency and output. The second firm was the Mining and Metallurgic Company of Trˇinec. This was also situated in the North Moravian coalfield, east of Ostrava. It was an area with a mixed Czech, German and Polish population, in which it was widely believed that Poles formed a majority and which Poland claimed, unsuccessfully, after the First World War.10 It was also an area in which the workers were increasingly attracted to Marxism, and strikes had broken out in 1920. The result was that the value of the shares had declined and German and Austrian shareholders had decided to sell. But because of the size of the company, even the Živnostenská banka had insufficient capital to buy the majority of these shares. In 1920 after lengthy negotiations it was left to the important French iron and steel company, Schneider et Cie-Creusot, to buy a controlling interest.11 The third company in this group, the Prague Iron Company, had originally been the major steel producer before the First World War and was the principal shareholder in the Österreichische Alpina Gesellschaft. In the spring of 1919 the Niederösterreichische Escomte Gesellschaft, the main shareholder, bought the shares of the Alpina company and later, in 1926, transferred a major part (57 per cent) to the German Vereinigte Stahlwerke. Czech control of the company was maintained through directors who represented the Czech Escomte Bank and Credit Institute in Prague, which before nostrification (Czech control) had been part of the Niederösterreichische Escomte Gesellschaft in Vienna, and which retained an important presence on the board.\n\nMajor Czechoslovak companies This industrial expansion was typical of Czechoslovak companies in the 1920s. Škoda was the outstanding example of a company that\n\nCrowhurst_Introduction.indd 8\n\n7/1/2013 4:23:52 PM\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n9\n\nchanged from being an armaments manufacturer to a company with a wide variety of industrial interests.12 The Austrian owner, Karel Škoda, was replaced by Josef Šimonek, who linked the company to the large and influential Czechoslovak Agrarian Party. Many of the managers were also members of this party and the Živnostenská banka was an important shareholder. Schneider Creusot provided financial stability and management expertise to help with reorganisation to reduce the very high production costs. From 1919 Škoda began to design and manufacture locomotives, diesel engines, brewery and sugar refining equipment, agricultural implements and buses (many for relatively undeveloped countries such as Afghanistan, Indonesia and China) and equipment for breweries and sugar refineries. Repayment was spread over a number of years, but financed by foreign (mainly British) loans negotiated by the finance director, Karel Loevenstein, in 1923. In the opinion of one Dutch rating firm, this loan established Škoda as the largest European engineering company. Three years later Loevenstein negotiated an even larger loan – £22.5 million. The second half of the 1920s was a period of intense rivalry between Škoda and Cˇ KD, which produced a similar range of products. There was a serious clash in the mid 1920s when CˇKD claimed that Škoda’s monopoly of supplying arms to the Czechoslovak army enabled it to charge unrealistically high prices and discouraged research. However, this did not end Škoda’s monopoly. In 1928 it signed a new contract with the Ministry of Defence worth 451 million crowns but also promised to build new armaments factories at Dubnica nad Váhom in Slovakia and Adamov near Brno that would be less vulnerable to German attack. In the second half of the 1920s Škoda’s exports rose from just under 690 million crowns in 1926 to 1,638 million crowns in 1930. This reflected a rapid rise in output in 1928−9 which was roughly double that of its rival CˇKD.13 In the 1930s both survived the Depression, mainly by sales of armaments to Romania, Czechoslovakia’s ally in the Little Entente, and payments for earlier sales. As the Depression ended and the threat from Germany increased under Hitler, both companies took an active part in equipping the country for possible war. Both produced tanks, guns, weapons of all types, motor vehicles and other forms of military materiel.\n\nCrowhurst_Introduction.indd 9\n\n7/1/2013 4:23:52 PM\n\n10\n\nHITLER\n\nAND\n\nCZECHOSLOVAKIA\n\nIN\n\nWWII\n\nAnother major Czechoslovak company with a European reputation was the boot and shoe manufacturer Bat’a.14 Whereas Škoda’s success was built on scientific knowledge and engineering experience, Bat’a’s was based initially on village craftsmanship. From humble beginnings, by the end of the First World War this firm had grown into a major manufacturer of boots and shoes. Tomáš Bat’a, the firm’s founder and driving force, had gained first-hand experience of factory production by working in American factories and based his approach to factory production on Taylor’s theory of Scientific Management, using the most modern machinery and methods of manufacture. Workers were trained to perform simple tasks efficiently and quickly and output was governed by the speed of the assembly line. Employees worked as teams and it was in their joint interest to maximise production and maintain a high quality. Under Bat’a’s control, output rose and prices fell, driving many smaller firms out of business. The story of the Bat’a company during the First Republic is one of steady progress. The company expanded to cover all aspects of production from the purchase and preparation of leather and other raw materials to manufacturing and sales. Tomáš Bat’a claimed that he wanted to provide simple, cheap, good quality shoes for the whole world. His factory at Zlín became a large industrial complex which included not only the manufacture of boots and shoes but also the machines with which these were made. But Bat’a was not simply a hard-driving taskmaster. He created a factory town in which all the employees, managers and workers alike were well housed in modern buildings. He also provided a school and college for training workers, a hospital, hotel and leisure facilities. When foreign countries threatened to block imports of his shoes in the 1930s, he established factories there which were largely self-supporting, though linked to the head office at Zlín by a common work ethic and methods of business. He was also unique in insisting that all his employees who worked overseas should respect local customs. But above all, Bat’a created a worldwide, commercial empire. Within Czechoslovakia Bat’a made boots and shoes, motor tyres, machinery, socks and stockings. The company also owned quarries, an advertising agency, a film company, an airline, a shipping company, a company savings scheme and made\n\nCrowhurst_Introduction.indd 10\n\n7/1/2013 4:23:52 PM\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n11\n\nlight aircraft. The company also had a subsidiary, Omnopol. This had originally been created to sell Bat’a products overseas. But it also acted as agent for many small companies that wanted to import and export but could not afford to employ their own staff. The basis of this commercial empire was efficient manufacture and carefully planned marketing. Managers of Bat’a shops who achieved sales above the company targets were well rewarded. Those who failed to meet the targets were penalised. It was said that being a manager of a Bat’a shoe shop ended either with making a man rich or driving him to suicide. But Bat’a himself was a driven man who also took considerable personal risks. When sales fell disastrously in 1932 he cut his prices by half and advertised this reduction widely in a big advertising campaign. Sales soared and he was able to clear stocks that would not have been sold if he had followed the traditional policy of making successive small, piecemeal reductions. But he was forced to reduce production. He laid off 5,000 workers and reduced the wages of the others. Thanks to this, his business survived and although Tomáš Bat’a was killed in an air crash in 1932, the company continued to develop in the same way in the second half of the 1930s. These were the main Czechoslovak companies which were the principal German target for exploitation. None was specifically German or Czech. There was also a wide range of other companies, many medium or small, which represented the range of Czechoslovak industrial strength in the First Republic. They included heavy and light engineering, chemical, glass making and textile companies. The common feature was an ability to innovate and develop beyond their original expertise. They showed a general sense of progress and prosperity, temporarily halted by the Depression, but recovering before the full effect of the Sudeten crisis and the Munich Conference.\n\nSudeten nationalism While this is true of Czech companies, it does not reflect the feeling among Sudeten Germans. In the early years of the First Republic they had been involved in an unsuccessful struggle to maintain their independence of Czech control.15 Although economically life improved after\n\nCrowhurst_Introduction.indd 11\n\n7/1/2013 4:23:52 PM\n\n12\n\nHITLER\n\nAND\n\nCZECHOSLOVAKIA\n\nIN\n\nWWII\n\n1923, there remained a strong nationalist sentiment and the Sudeten German firms did not necessarily share in the economic progress. The nationalist sentiment was expressed, for example, in the Sudetendeutscher Katechismus published in 1923 and which followed a similar ‘catechism’ published in 1919. The author was Erwin Volkmann, a pseudonym for Erich Gierach of Reichenberg (Czech Liberec), who taught at the German University in Prague from 1921 to 1936 and then joined the Nazi Party and went to Munich. He claimed that it was the Germans who had the true historical claim to the Sudeten area, and not the Czechs. The Czechoslovak government was aware of right-wing German attitudes and the danger this posed to the state. In 1927 a law was passed making it a serious crime to do anything that might undermine the unity of the state. Two years later the Nazi Party made its first appearance as the Volkssport, or to give it its full name Verband Volkssport, Nationalsozialistischer Verband für Wandern, Radfahren, Spiel und Sport aller Art. On the surface, this was no more than a sporting club organised by a minor right-wing political party. It was given official recognition – and approval – in April and was based in Fulnek. In reality it was a Nazi SA (Sturmabteilung) organisation that set out to indoctrinate young Sudeten Germans. Among the courses it offered was one on leadership (Führerkurse). This was not a course for potential leaders but one intended to teach the need to be disciplined and obey a strong leader: the Führerprinzip. Volkssport also taught paramilitary subjects: weapons training and map reading as well as a range of physical activities. The sessions were held as Heimatabende, stressing the element of German folk culture. The organisation gradually became more confident and its members began wearing a uniform with swastika armbands and jackboots. It was active in Prague among German students and Joseph Goebbels was invited to speak in February 1930. The banner announcing his visit stated: ‘Achtung hier [ist] Deutschland. Der Nationalsozialismus marschiert. Burschen heraus zur N. S. Woche. Alle Mann [sic] an die Front. [Attention. This is Germany. National Socialism is on the march. Contribute to National Socialist week! Everyone must take an active part]\n\nCrowhurst_Introduction.indd 12\n\n7/1/2013 4:23:52 PM\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n13\n\nThis Nazi activity took place at a time of rising unemployment. Sudeten Germans were alarmed about their economic prospects and there was good reason for this. One example is Josef Kaub’s machine construction and foundry company in Domažlice in West Bohemia, which expanded in 1927 but soon had to begin laying off workers. It did not recover until 1944. In September 1930, the Social Democratic Party and the Gewerkschaftsbund united and held a congress in Prague to publicise the rising economic hardship. Speakers claimed that unemployment among Sudeten Germans was higher than among Czechs. A speaker claimed that in 61 purely Czech districts there were 27,288 unemployed of a total population of 2.8 million. In 41 purely Sudeten German districts there were 27,042 unemployed out of 1.5 million. For the country as a whole unemployment among Czechs was 9 per 1,000 but 18 among Sudeten Germans. There were similar complaints from workers in the chemical, tobacco and clothing industries. This combination of rising unemployment and increasing Nazi activity led the Czechoslovak government to ban members of Volkssport wearing their official uniform. But all that happened was that they began wearing another: blue cap, white shirt and black tie. The cap badge had the monogram VS, which could be reversed to appear as SA. In neighbouring Austria, Nazi activity became more threatening. In 1931 Nazis tried to seize power in Upper Styria and in 1932 a memorial concert was held in Salzburg to commemorate those killed in demonstrations for Sudeten German independence in 1919. Membership of Volkssport increased in Czechoslovakia from 5,000 to 40,000 in 1932 and groups openly sang the Nazi song ‘Die Fahne hoch’ [‘Carry the flag high’].\n\nCzech reaction Finally the Czechoslovak government reached the limits of its tolerance. In September 1932 a group of Sudeten German Nazis in Brno were charged with organising Nazi storm troop groups under the guise of Volkssport and Jungsturm organisations. The trial was intended as a warning. Although the movement was intended to destroy the Czechoslovak state – a crime under the 1927 law – the accused were\n\nCrowhurst_Introduction.indd 13\n\n7/1/2013 4:23:52 PM\n\n14\n\nHITLER\n\nAND\n\nCZECHOSLOVAKIA\n\nIN\n\nWWII\n\nonly given jail sentences of one to three years. But this was followed by the arrest and trial of five Sudeten German parliamentary representatives in January 1933 – an action which was criticised by the Communists who were afraid the same might happen to them (‘We don’t need a trial. Give us bread and work’). This was the start of a concerted attack by the Czechoslovak government on all members of extreme right-wing Sudeten German groups. In June 1932 the government proclaimed a state of emergency with fines of a maximum of 50,000 crowns. Forty-two Sudeten German Nazis from the West Bohemian textile town of Asch – which was suffering extreme hardship in the Depression – were put on trial for attending Nazi meetings in Germany. This was only the beginning. On 19 June the German ambassador in Prague reported to the German Foreign Office that there were 1,300 trials of political activists and 700 were in prison awaiting trial. Sudeten German students at the German University in Prague could not engage in politics. No activity calling for the union of all Germans in one state (gleichgeschaltet) was tolerated and another 98 Reich newspapers had been banned.\n\nOfficial German support for Sudeten Germans This marks the point at which the German Foreign Office began to become actively involved in the activities of the Sudeten German Nazi Party. The German embassy in Prague learnt of many Sudeten Germans in prison awaiting trial. This caused serious economic hardship for all their dependants. When this was reported to Berlin, funds were made available for their support, on Hitler’s orders. But since all participation in this political activity, or even association with it, was illegal, the German diplomats had to be extremely careful to avoid disbursing this money openly and being accused of breaking the law. News of this money began to circulate among the Sudeten German political activists, who appealed to the embassy for help. The correspondence between Koch, the senior German diplomat in Prague, and the Foreign Ministry in Berlin show how the embassy was gradually forced to become the Nazi Party’s representative in Czechoslovakia. Koch disbursed money to the dependants of activists,\n\nCrowhurst_Introduction.indd 14\n\n7/1/2013 4:23:52 PM\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n15\n\npaid back money that had been taken illegally from union funds to pay for legal representation (600,000 crowns for the defence of the union leader Krebs) and eventually became Konrad Henlein’s paymaster as the latter moved towards leadership of the apparently more moderate SdP (Sudeten deutsche Partei). He passed on considerable sums of money for Sudeten German (Nazi) newspapers and for election expenses at a time when Germany was very short of foreign exchange. Koch himself was not a Nazi. But he believed in the German superiority over Czechs and considered that the Sudeten Germans had been harshly treated. This was the situation when Konrad Henlein swept to victory in the 1935 elections with 66 per cent of the Sudeten German votes. He represented apparently moderate Sudeten German opinion and struck a balance between the extreme Nazis and the moderate ‘activists’ who supported the Czech-led government. In reality, Konrad Henlein had received a great deal of financial help from Germany and from right-wing groups in the Sudeten German community. He was also an experienced organiser of mass community sporting activities. From 1935 Konrad Henlein followed a policy of pressing the Czechoslovak government for greater political power for the Sudeten German population but had to hold a balance between his moderate supporters and the extreme Nazis such as his deputy Hans Frank.\n\nHitler’s plans to invade Czechoslovakia By July 1936 Hitler had decided that he could start planning his eastward expansion: a continuation and development of Germany’s eastern policy in the First World War (Drang nach Osten). His Order No. 23 instructed the army to plan an invasion of Czechoslovakia. Hitler realised that Henlein’s pressure on the Czechoslovak government would not be enough to cause its collapse. Konrad Henlein was demanding an improvement in Sudeten German rights; but their status as second-class citizens did not change. There was still widespread discontent. Sudeten Germans considered that they had not been supported during the Depression and felt excluded from the renewed prosperity of Czech companies which were benefiting\n\nCrowhurst_Introduction.indd 15\n\n7/1/2013 4:23:52 PM\n\n16\n\nHITLER\n\nAND\n\nCZECHOSLOVAKIA\n\nIN\n\nWWII\n\nfrom government defence contracts. However, Henlein’s bargaining position was weakened by the continued support given by Sudeten German ‘activist’ (traditional) parties to the Czechoslovak government. These continued to claim to represent Sudeten German interests and the government was prepared to negotiate with them on this basis. The speech by President Beneš at Reichenberg in August 1937 was conciliatory and seemed to show that the government was prepared to make reasonable concessions. Unknown to Beneš, German plans to invade Czechoslovakia had been approved in outline in June. By July they had reached an advanced stage; the military garrison at Dresden would make the main attack. Additional military activity to the west would divide Czechoslovak military forces. These advanced preparations for war encouraged Hitler to hold a meeting with senior German diplomats and military leaders in November. The only record of this, the Hossbach memorandum, has been discussed at length because although it seemed to set out a plan of campaign – an attack on Czechoslovakia and Austria − this is not what actually happened. The main purpose of the November meeting was to prepare senior members of the Foreign Ministry and army for war in the near future, though they believed that war would not come before 1942.\n\nThe Anschluss and Sudeten crisis Early the following year Hitler increased the pressure on Austria for a union with Germany. Hitler had already created the Austrian Legion of Austrian Nazis. These were trained in street fighting by members of the Leibstandarte ‘Adolf Hitler’ and were infiltrated into Austria. The Austrian Chancellor, Schuschnigg, resisted Hitler’s demands and was summoned to the Obersalzburg on 12 February. On his return to Vienna he asked Britain for support and organised a plebiscite on the proposed union. Before this could take place, on 12 March Hitler sent German troops into Austria. Seyss Inquart replaced Schuschnigg and on 14 March Hitler entered Vienna. These events were closely followed by the Sudeten German population. Hitler’s success led the Sudeten German activist parties to ally\n\nCrowhurst_Introduction.indd 16\n\n7/1/2013 4:23:52 PM\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n17\n\nthemselves with Henlein’s SdP. This unleashed a wave of popular feeling among Sudeten Germans, who believed that it would quickly lead to changes in Czechoslovak government policy. The situation is vividly described in a telegram by Eisenlohr, who had replaced Koch as the senior German diplomat in Prague: Following the merger of the German Activist parties with the SdP about 36 meetings of Henlein’s movement with some 500,000 members took place in Sudeten German area on Sunday March 27. Demonstrations naturally overshadowed by happenings in Austria [the Anschluss] and were characterized by very violent outbreaks of enthusiasm on the part of Sudeten German people, who expect complete reshaping of their destiny. In this connection, understand from reliable agent that, for instance, [Nazi] Party flags were hoisted on town hall in Asch, accompanied by pealing of all church bells, during armed demonstration. Out of 34,000 inhabitants of Eger, 25,000 Germans deployed likewise to accompaniment of church bells. Henlein’s movement war standard was hoisted on town hall. Out of 18,000 inhabitants of Saaz, 15,000 Germans marched shouting “One people, one Reich, one Führer.” In Görkau, where Government representatives had forbidden German salute, speaker commenced his speech with “On behalf of you all I salute our Führer and the entire German people with upraised hands.” In locality where formerly Activist or non-party burgomaster went over to Sudeten German Party, this even was symbolised by hoisting German Sudeten Party flag on town hall to accompaniment of church bells. On orders from above Czechoslovak police and gendarmerie showed great restraint. At various places Government representatives were obliged to render military salute to Sudeten German Party flag. Population feel behaviour of police to be helplessness and abdication of civil authority. They reckon on complete volteface after 10 April [probably a reference to the plebiscite on union of Austria with Germany] and possibly even Reich intervention. ... Party leaders of Sudeten German Party have recognised present enthusiastic mood as dangerous.16\n\nCrowhurst_Introduction.indd 17\n\n7/1/2013 4:23:52 PM\n\n18\n\nHITLER\n\nAND\n\nCZECHOSLOVAKIA\n\nIN\n\nWWII\n\nThis was followed by rumours that members of German athletic clubs were being armed and that the former Ordnerdienst, a paramilitary organisation that had formerly protected party meetings, was being re-created. Henlein tried to calm the situation by enlarging the SdP membership and enforcing discipline on members. But tension remained high. The Nazi Party, SA and SS in Austria were circulating rumours along the frontier that German troops would invade Bohemia and Moravia after the plebiscite that Hitler had called for 10 April to approve the Anschluss. It appeared that Sudeten Germans were being asked to prepare fighting units as soon as possible. Henlein reported that uniforms were being made in Krumau (Czech Krumlov) in preparation for the entry of German troops. Women’s organisations were making swastika flags and importing many more illegally. Henlein felt that he was losing control of the situation and was being criticised by students in Prague who considered his policy too moderate. The Czechs responded by arming Czech civilians in the frontier districts, Sokol clubs, Red Guards and the frontier guards. Heavily armed, motorised Czechoslovak units were also formed. War was expected; the Czech Chief of General Staff, Krejcˇi, had remarked to the departing Austrian military attaché, Longin: “We shall probably come to blows.”17 Faced with the threat of war, France restated its support for Czechoslovakia, but this failed to calm the situation in the Sudetenland. On 9 April Henlein’s, deputy, Frank reported that the situation in northern Bohemia was ‘catastrophic and shattering’. Sudeten German opinion was turning against the Czech minority. Dr Eckert, Henlein’s agent, reported that a ‘single shot for Sudeten Germans would suffice to start a blood bath among Czechs’. At the same time, support for Henlein was being weakened by his willingness to negotiate with the Czechoslovak government. Sudeten Germans thought that he had abandoned his demand for autonomy. All he had achieved was a promise to move the elections, which offered to give the SdP greater power at a local level, forward to June. His failure to present a clear political programme was also damaging his reputation abroad. Hitler reconsidered his plans to invade Czechoslovakia. On 21 April\n\nCrowhurst_Introduction.indd 18\n\n7/1/2013 4:23:52 PM\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n19\n\nin discussion with Keitel, chief of staff, he decided to abandon Fall Grün (Case Green), the planned invasion of Czechoslovakia, because of world opinion. He no longer had any confidence that the army could complete the conquest of Czechoslovakia in four days as originally planned. Instead, he decided to foment political unrest and hoped that this would provide an opportunity for intervention in the Sudetenland. The next stage in the crisis was Henlein’s Karlsbad speech on 24 April. Although if accepted, his demands would have breached the Czechoslovak constitution and undermined Czechoslovak democracy, Hitler expected that, like the Austrian ultimatum that precipitated the First World War, Henlein’s demands would be rejected by the Czechoslovak government and provoke war. The German Foreign Ministry was finally informed of the invasion plans and told that mobilisation had already begun. All missions abroad were warned that war could break out. Czechoslovakia also prepared for war. In the May Crisis that followed, Czechoslovakia called up a large part of its army and manned the frontier defences. Mobilisation was carried out swiftly and efficiently. There were also rumours on the 18th and 19th of a German invasion and that four motorised divisions – part of a force of 11 divisions – had been formed north of Bohemia. The British consul in Dresden heard of forces massing in Silesia and northern Austria. There were also stories of Germans being taught Czech and roads from Chemnitz being full of troop convoys.18 These were denied by the German Foreign Ministry. It is possible that German troops had earlier moved from their barracks in Dresden to take up positions near the frontier as part of the planned attack. Hitler and the German army felt that they had to be prepared for war. When the immediate crisis was past and the Czechoslovak government was persuaded to demobilise its forces, British diplomats were sent to the German−Czechoslovak frontier to check whether the rumours had been true. It was hardly surprising that they found no sign of the soldiers. The situation in the summer of 1938 was that Europe had apparently come close to war. British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain tried to discover the causes of the Sudeten complaints by sending Lord\n\nCrowhurst_Introduction.indd 19\n\n7/1/2013 4:23:53 PM\n\n20\n\nHITLER\n\nAND\n\nCZECHOSLOVAKIA\n\nIN\n\nWWII\n\nRunciman to Czechoslovakia, but he was unsuited to the task, failed to understand what was happening and spent most of his free time with Sudeten Germans rather than Czechs. Runciman’s mission had little or no influence on events. In any case Henlein and other Sudeten Germans had already presented their case to Vansittart and other British diplomats and politicians in London and had been able to create the impression that the whole Sudeten population was on the brink of civil war. This marks the final stage of the Sudeten crisis. Believing that only concessions by the Czechoslovak government could avert war and that Hitler’s demands were reasonable, Chamberlain tried to find what concessions Hitler would accept. There followed the two meetings and the Munich Conference, in which Britain and France believed that they had averted war by sacrificing a minor power to a major. So little did Chamberlain really understand about the matter that it was comparatively easy for Hitler to fix the terms of the agreements and set the new frontiers. This effectively destroyed Czechoslovakia as a viable state because it took away the frontier defences and a large part of Czechoslovak industry. It also encouraged Poland to demand the strip of territory north of Ostrava and the exodus of Czechs and anti-Nazi Germans from the Sudetenland was matched by a smaller flow of refugees from the territory seized by Poland. Public outrage in London, a British loan and public donations to the Lord Mayor of London’s appeal to help these refugees marks the end of the First Czechoslovak Republic. It was only a short time before Germany took the remaining part of Bohemia and Moravia, encouraged Slovak demands for independence and began to assimilate the Czech economic and social assets in the preparation for war. The German army already had a good general idea of Czechoslovak industry (major industrial centres and numbers employed) from an earlier report in the 1920s. From the end of March 1939 they were able to seize everything of economic and military importance and the equipment of the Czechoslovak army. The German population of Czechoslovakia, not all of which was in the Sudetenland, expected to be once again in control and were potential allies for Hitler’s plans to exploit the country. Czech weakness – their inability in a crisis to obtain help from their allies the USSR,\n\nCrowhurst_Introduction.indd 20\n\n7/1/2013 4:23:53 PM\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n21\n\nFrance and the Little Entente – suggested that it would be simple to exploit them in any way that Hitler and the German army thought necessary to help in the planned eastward expansion. Thus the scene was set for the final preparations for war on Poland and, later, the USSR.\n\nCrowhurst_Introduction.indd 21\n\n7/1/2013 4:23:53 PM\n\nCHAPTER 1 DEEPENING CR ISIS, THE MUNICH CONFER ENCE AND R EFUGEES\n\nReduced to the bare essentials, Hitler’s policy in the final Czechoslovak crisis of September 1939 and the subsequent dismemberment of what remained of Czechoslovakia was based on no more than bluff. Conditions in the Sudeten German area were never as bad as he claimed, though there was serious hardship and widespread discontent. Events which he claimed were ‘proof’ of Czech hostility were exaggerated or deliberately provoked. Nor was there any real risk of civil war in Czechoslovakia. Equally, there had been discontent in the predominantly Polish area around ‘Teschen’ (Czech Cˇeský Te˘šín, Polish Cieszyn) and ‘Freistadt’ (Czech Karviná-Fryštát) for a long time, but nothing to suggest that the area was in such ferment that a transfer to Poland would solve the matter. The same could be said about the southern border of Slovakia inhabited by a majority of Hungarian speakers or the Ruthene area in the extreme east occupied by people who were ethnically Ukrainian. Yet within six months of the Munich Conference, Czechoslovakia had lost territory to Germany, Poland and Hungary and the remaining Czech lands in Bohemia and Moravia had been seized and renamed the Protectorate. Czechoslovakia had ceased to exist, but without creating the peace and stability that Hitler and German diplomats had claimed would be the result.\n\nCrowhurst_Chapter01.indd 22\n\n7/1/2013 4:22:19 PM\n\nDEEPENING CRISIS\n\n23\n\nEvery move by Hitler was accompanied by violent threats of imminent destruction. He claimed in every case to be acting in the name of peace, trying to find a solution to events that were rapidly falling into chaos. He succeeded partly because he appeared plausible and because he was a unique head of state. Diplomats and politicians had never encountered such a man before in that position. He was the first twentieth-century politician to base his aggressive policy on the simple, Machiavellian thesis that anything was permissible if it was successful. His later policy from March 1939 to the outbreak of the Second World War was no more than a continuation of this. He wanted more living space for Germans. At the same time he was thinking of ways of disposing of (killing) as many of the inhabitants of these lands in Central and Eastern Europe and the USSR that could not be ‘Germanised’. In the case of the Czechs, at the centre of this study, this would have resulted in a ‘solution’ that would have destroyed them as a people, either by starving them or turning them into some form of secondclass ‘German’ people.1 Fortunately for the Czechs, Hitler never had the time or opportunity to complete these plans and put them into effect, though German control of the former Czechoslovakia from 1938 to 1945 caused immense hardship. It also resulted later in the expulsion of virtually all of the Sudeten Germans in an act of revenge. Only those married to Czechs or who were regarded as pro-Czech were allowed to stay and they changed the spelling of their German family name to make them appear ‘Czech’. The German presence in Czechoslovakia disappeared.\n\nPrelude to the Munich Conference By August 1938 Hitler’s plans for invading Czechoslovakia were complete and the army had been persuaded that it could be successful. The Sudeten German political demands had been backed by German writers in Czechoslovakia and Germany, who claimed that the Sudeten Germans had never been treated fairly and that Czechs and Germans had hated each other for centuries. In Berlin, Rudolf Jung’s book, Die Tschechen; Tausend Jahre deutsch-tschechischer Kampf had appeared in 1937 in a second, enlarged, edition. In 1938, as the crisis deepened, there\n\nCrowhurst_Chapter01.indd 23\n\n7/1/2013 4:22:19 PM\n\n24\n\nHITLER\n\nAND\n\nCZECHOSLOVAKIA\n\nIN\n\nWWII\n\nwere attempts to influence British foreign policy and public opinion by articles in The Times, Observer, Daily Mail and Daily Express. To this were added books such as the apparently reasonable pro-Sudeten German book by ‘Diplomaticus’, The Czechs and their Minorities, published in London. The earlier, measured, Czech response to German claims in Josef Chmelarˇ, The German Problem in Czechoslovakia, published in Prague in 1936, had failed to carry equal weight. There were British newspapers that took a pro-Czechoslovak view: Daily Telegraph, Sunday Times, News Chronicle and Daily Herald, besides the important provincial newspapers Manchester Guardian and Yorkshire Post.2 When the Slovak separatists were encouraged to seek independence in 1938, there appeared the strident Should Britain go to war – for Czechoslovakia? published by the Slovak Council in Geneva. This opened with a section headed ‘Why is Czechoslovakia not worthy of being helped?’ which set the tone of the whole book. The earlier, liberal and pro-Czech views of Wickham Steed, former foreign editor of The Times, and Professor Seton-Watson carried no weight because they were out of favour.3 Nor did the report by a group of British students in We saw Czechoslovakia, published in 1938. They declared: ‘Is Czechoslovakia worth defending? To those of us who saw something of its achievements in the past 18 years and felt something of the passion of its people for democracy and social justice, only one answer is possible. We say “Yes.” ’ Toynbee, writing in The Economist in July 1937, had also warned that if Britain ignored events in Central Europe the British would eventually either have to accept German domination of Europe or would have to fight to keep a balance of power. But there were more powerful influences on Chamberlain. Most Conservatives considered that fascism was somehow ‘all right’. The influential Cliveden Set and the 30 peers and 30 MPs in AngloGerman fellowships also influenced him. It was not merely Chamberlain’s ignorance of Czechoslovak affairs and his urgent desire to avoid war that made the crisis from August 1938 so severe. What is clear from the British diplomatic correspondence is that the Foreign Office knew that Hungary and Poland were also pressing demands against Czechoslovakia. This widened the problem by threatening a more general European war. In the case of\n\nCrowhurst_Chapter01.indd 24\n\n7/1/2013 4:22:19 PM\n\nDEEPENING CRISIS\n\n25\n\nHungary, the Versailles settlement had awarded Czechoslovakia land on its Hungarian frontier that was occupied by a majority of Hungarian speakers. Hungarian hopes of regaining this territory had never disappeared, but had been held in check by the Little Entente. Hungarian relations with Romania and Yugoslavia were also in a state of ‘virtually constant tension’.4 During the August 1938 crisis the Hungarians attended a conference of the Little Entente at Bled and in return for a promise of non-violence were given assurances that the condition of the Hungarian minority would be improved, though this promise was never ratified.5 There were also German–Hungarian discussions at Kiel, where Hitler promised Upper Slovakia to Hungary if the two countries jointly attacked Czechoslovakia. But Hungary was worried about possible action by the Little Entente in the event of a German– Czechoslovak war.6 The German view was that Yugoslavia would remain neutral but the Hungarian army was still relatively weak and the government preferred a peaceful solution. This crisis in August, accompanied by Czechoslovak mobilisation, made the British government anxious to try and find a solution to the problem that was not only about the Sudeten Germans but also the other minorities as well. Liddell Hart, writing to Anthony Eden on 10 September, offered an analysis of a possible German–Czech war to help the government form its policy. He stressed British military weakness (inadequate anti-aircraft defence) and the likelihood that Germany would attack Czechoslovakia from Austria, between Brno and Bratislava.7 He thought that Germany might initially make rapid progress there. But he felt it would be unable to conquer the whole country quickly. The Czech army was capable of putting up a prolonged resistance, provided the Germans did not have total control of the air. The only help that the French could offer was to tie down German forces on the Maginot Line. Nor could Russia offer any more assistance. Its army was unbelievably slow, though it might invade East Prussia, if given permission by Latvia and Lithuania to enter their territory. The central problem would be how to remove the German forces if the initial stage of the war came to a halt. This might be done by economic pressure, and by demoralising the German troops.\n\nCrowhurst_Chapter01.indd 25\n\n7/1/2013 4:22:19 PM\n\n26\n\nHITLER\n\nAND\n\nCZECHOSLOVAKIA\n\nIN\n\nWWII\n\nThis was a serious attempt to provide the government, via Eden, with a realistic military assessment of the situation. However, it had one serious weakness. It assumed that the German army had a battle plan to invade Czechoslovakia from Austria. This was unlikely. The Anschluss had taken place little more than a year earlier. No battle plan would have been made before then unless Hitler was working to a timetable that made the seizure of Austria a first step. There was no evidence for that. Nor was it likely that the German military planners would have had time to make a detailed invasion plan between the Anschluss and the August 1938 crisis. A further weakness was that any invasion from that part of Austria would require large numbers of troops and all their equipment, including tanks, to be moved by rail from Germany. The build up and initial manoeuvres to test the battle plan would alert foreign diplomats and the Czech army, which could take defensive measures. There was also a line of bunkers and defence posts to protect the southern frontier. It was much easier for Germany to plan an invasion based on the existing military base at Dresden. Even in that case, however, rumours about the initial troop manoeuvres reached foreign diplomats and the Czechs, who had time to prepare their defence. A plebiscite seemed to offer a way out of this dangerous situation. It had become Henlein’s chief demand, and therefore might solve the problem. But, as the Foreign Office memorandum of 11 September showed, opinions were mixed about whether it might prove a longterm solution.8 The Foreign Office opinion was that, in any case, Britain had a moral and legal obligation to prevent aggression, especially since Britain would quickly be drawn into any general war. Alternatively, the races could be separated: ‘No one wants to compel a person to stay in a state to which they are not loyal’. But if a plebiscite were held to establish popular choice, it needed law and order to guarantee that the results were fair. Also, if Germany were to take the territory after the plebiscite, a four-power conference would be needed to provide stability and give people time to leave. There was also the problem of German treatment of the Jews and the risk that the Czechs would resist and ‘go down fighting’. This would be the first stage of dismembering Czechoslovakia. It was a perceptive assessment of the situation and was borne out by results.\n\nCrowhurst_Chapter01.indd 26\n\n7/1/2013 4:22:19 PM\n\nDEEPENING CRISIS\n\n27\n\nHungarian and Polish demands Discontent among the Hungarian population of Slovakia also formed part of this crisis. On 14 September, the Hungarian Chargé d’Affaires in Prague asked what the British attitude was towards the treatment of these people.9 The message was passed to the Foreign Office in London. In reply, Vansittart told the Hungarian ambassador that any concessions offered to the Sudeten Germans should also automatically be given to other minorities.10 The Hungarian government moved quickly to exploit this. The Times had carried an article on 7 September on the possibility of the Sudeten Germans being given a plebiscite. On 15 September the British ambassador in Budapest, Sir G. Knox, was told by the Hungarian foreign minister that if the Sudeten Germans were given a plebiscite, Hungary would demand the same for its minority in Slovakia.11 The same day, Chamberlain had his first meeting with Hitler at Berchtesgaden. Hitler appeared reasonable. He knew that he would not be able to invade Czechoslovakia before 1 October and in the meantime was concerned to keep up the pressure on the Sudeten German issue. Chamberlain, for his part, made his position as an arbitrator clear: ‘In principle I had nothing to say against the separation of the Sudeten Germans from the rest of Czechoslovakia, provided that the practical difficulties could be overcome.’12 However, far from easing the tension as Chamberlain had hoped, Hitler continued to raise his demands. In Czechoslovakia many expected war to break out. Sudeten Germans had no definite information about what was happening. Czech newspapers were heavily censored, no German newspapers could be imported and German information was regarded, correctly, as propaganda. Radios and telephones had been confiscated and all contact with the outside world was broken. To give one example of conditions in the Sudetenland, the German population of the textile town of Fleissen in West Bohemia were fleeing to Germany, terrified by stories of Germans being hunted and beaten by Czechs.13 Factories, shops and businesses were closed and the town was deserted. There was a feeling of helplessness and that war was inevitable. The Czechs were equally tense.\n\nCrowhurst_Chapter01.indd 27\n\n7/1/2013 4:22:19 PM\n\n28\n\nHITLER\n\nAND\n\nCZECHOSLOVAKIA\n\nIN\n\nWWII\n\nPoland used this crisis to press its claim regarding the Polish minority in the Cieszyn–Cˇeský Te˘šín area in north Moravia. The Polish government, like Hitler and the Hungarians, claimed the Poles were being persecuted. On 16 September, Kennard, the British ambassador in Warsaw, reported that the Polish government was considering sending a note to the British, French and Czechoslovak governments demanding self-determination for the Polish minority.14 The same day he also reported that if any concessions were given to the Sudeten Germans, the Polish government would demand the same for its people. When the Hungarian government learnt of this it demanded the same. Following the large increase in the military budget – which took the army above the limits imposed by the Treaty of Trianon − the Hungarian government was able to back its demands with the threat of military force.15 But it was initially very cautious and although there was a partial Hungarian mobilisation, this was not announced officially. While Hungary was cautious, Poland was more aggressive. On 19 September Knox reported from Budapest that the Polish and Hungarian governments were working together. The Poles had announced that if any Sudeten territory was transferred to Germany, Poland would seize ‘Teschen’ (Cˇeský Te˘šín – the Czech half of the former town of Teschen, divided by the River Olša).16 The frontier was only lightly defended at this point and lacked the elaborate system of bunkers that had been built elsewhere on the German and Hungarian frontiers.17 Poland backed this campaign of intimidation with an aggressive anti-Czech press campaign, and increased its forces on the frontier. The reason for this, as Kennard made clear in his report from Warsaw, was that it appeared that Britain and France were about to sacrifice Czechoslovakia. In that case, Poland would seize ‘Teschen’ and Britain would be faced with a fait accompli.18 The same day, Knox sent a Hungarian note that proposed to unite the Hungarians in Czechoslovakia with ‘their mother country’ and asked for British support. Meanwhile, Poland continued to raise the political pressure. Kennard reported a rumour that the Poles were considering sending a note to Czechoslovakia demanding a revision of the frontier along ethnographic lines. This had originally been agreed by the Polish and\n\nCrowhurst_Chapter01.indd 28\n\n7/1/2013 4:22:19 PM\n\nDEEPENING CRISIS\n\n29\n\nCzech National Councils on 5 November 1918, but was never carried out. Polish demands were backed by further demonstrations of a build-up of troops in Kraków, though the Poles insisted that force would only be used as a last resort. Similarly, the Hungarians claimed that military reinforcements sent to the Slovak frontier were merely defensive, matching the Czech troops already there. The Czechoslovak government, recognising Hungarian weakness, had not hesitated to strengthen its eastern frontier.\n\nFrench and British policy While pressure had been mounting on Czechoslovakia to make concessions to Hungary and Poland, France and Britain had been considering their own policy. Chamberlain believed that the Sudeten Germans should not be offered a plebiscite, because Hungary and Poland would also demand one for their minorities. The Czechoslovak ambassador in London, Jan Masaryk, also opposed giving the Sudeten Germans a plebiscite, though for different reasons.19 In his view the [Czech] population would not agree to it. He also claimed that ‘the areas in question have formed a territorial and economic part of the historical lands of Bohemia for a thousand years. If they, by hook or by crook, were attached to Germany, nothing would stand in the way of German expansion through East and South East Europe.’ Ignoring this sound advice, Chamberlain proposed transferring Sudeten German territory to Germany. Some found the proposal deeply offensive. Colin Coote, writing to Eden on 20 September called it: ... a squalid scuttle. It is surely analogous in many points to the affair which caused your resignation ... You said there must be a settlement by agreement. This is a sacrifice of the method of negotiation and a surrender to a naked threat. You said ... that there must be no breach of our solidarity with France. This plan means bitter recriminations with France, leading to a dissolution of this solidarity. Already the rubber stamps which exist to supply Mr Chamberlain with a Cabinet are explaining that they were forced to surrender because France would not fight ... there\n\nCrowhurst_Chapter01.indd 29\n\n7/1/2013 4:22:19 PM\n\n30\n\nHITLER\n\nAND\n\nCZECHOSLOVAKIA\n\nIN\n\nWWII\n\nseems to be no limit whatever to the Nazi policy of blackmail. Personally I was not in the least concerned to keep the Sudetens within Czechoslovakia, but most deeply concerned with the method by which any change in their status was effected.20 Not surprisingly, the French initially resisted this proposal to transfer the Sudetenland to Germany. They were unwilling to abandon their Czech allies and were promised support by the USSR. But eventually they bowed to British pressure, on condition that the remaining part of Czechoslovakia would be guaranteed by Britain and France. This was the plan put to Beneš. On 20 September he rejected it, but was forced to accept the following day when it became clear that this was an ultimatum. If he had continued to reject the proposal, Britain and France claimed they would not have been responsible for the outcome. Unwillingly he accepted and the government fell. Chamberlain paid a second visit to Hitler, at Godesberg, to put the plan to him, but Hitler now raised the stakes. He refused to accept the Anglo-French proposal, claimed that Sudeten Germans were being massacred and insisted that German troops should be sent at once to protect them. This sequence of events is now so well known that it is hard to realise that at the time few ordinary people had much idea of what was really going on. The Western press described events (both fact and fiction) and the public in Britain, France and elsewhere were made aware of the serious nature of the crisis. They also knew that Chamberlain was being forced to make concessions in the interests of what he regarded as world peace. For the ordinary Czech living far away from the Sudetenland, life was no doubt very different. The Sudeten German complaints were not new. Few can have realised how close the country was to being dismembered. The atmosphere is described most vividly in Mark Slouka’s novel The Visible World, based on the experiences of his Czech parents in Czechoslovakia in this period. Hanuš, a Czech former inmate of the Mauthausen concentration camp, who returned from there a cripple, describes the events after the war to a 12-year-old boy. “This is what I’m trying to say to you: For a long, long time, nothing happens. And then it does.\n\nCrowhurst_Chapter01.indd 30\n\n7/1/2013 4:22:19 PM\n\nDEEPENING CRISIS\n\n31\n\nIn a place called Berchtesgaden, a tall Englishman with a white moustache named Chamberlain unfolds himself from a limousine. Arguments are made. Tea is sipped. Important men stab their fingers at the polished table. ‘Sie müssen ... Wir werden ... Etwas Tee, mein Herr?’ In Bad Godesburg this Englishman smoothes his hair with his right hand and says. ‘I take your point, Herr Ribbentrop. And yet, if I may ... we feel that ... in the matter of ... Can I take that as your final position? And it comes to pass.” Mr Hanuš smiled. “Berchtesgaden. Bad Godesberg. Berlin. All those Bs’. But you look around ... Nothing has happened.”21 But in Prague a new Czechoslovak government was formed under General Syrovy who ordered mobilisation.22 The August crisis had severely strained the existing Czechoslovak system of coalitions and the new government was intended to provide a stronger foundation for resisting German pressure. The cabinet consisted of specialists and individuals representing national institutions. They included the Mayor of Prague, Dr Zenkl and Dr Butovsky, head of the patriotic Sokol organisation. Political parties were excluded, minimising the influence of Henlein’s SdP and party rivalry. A separate committee was formed to include political representatives, but the members were former ministers who accepted the Anglo-French proposals for the Sudetenland. Their role was purely advisory. Having formed a new government, President Beneš invited the Slovak People’s Party for talks. The appointment of the new government calmed Czech fears but demonstrations continued in Hungary and Poland, each of which continued to move troops towards the frontier. Faced with Poland’s determination to get ‘Teschen’ and British and French support for Polish demands, the Czechoslovak government finally agreed to cede ‘Teschen’ provided assurances of friendly cooperation were given in return.23 Hungary, on the other hand, was only given British assurances that its claims would ‘receive consideration at the appropriate moment’.24 Britain and France were more concerned about their reply to Hitler than dealing with Hungary. What ultimately swayed both Britain and\n\nCrowhurst_Chapter01.indd 31\n\n7/1/2013 4:22:19 PM\n\n32\n\nHITLER\n\nAND\n\nCZECHOSLOVAKIA\n\nIN\n\nWWII\n\nFrance was the apparent military strength of Germany and their own perceived weakness. Britain had begun to rearm and in at least two ways Czechoslovakia was helping Britain and should in turn have been supported. One was the Anglo-Czech cooperation between the Royal Small Arms Factory at Enfield Lock and Škoda. This was the development of a British version of the Czech Lehky Kulomet [light machine gun] ZB vz30 which became known as the Bren Gun – the standard British infantry light machine gun of the Second World War.25 The other was armour plate supplied to the Admiralty by the Vítkovice steel works. In April a British technical expert, W. S. Walker of the steel company Firth, Brown & Co., was sent to Vítkovice to supervise a secret Admiralty order.26 This was followed on 31 May by a report that a British draftsman, C. C. Bachelor, would also be sent there. Following a conference at Vítkovice in April 1938, the Admiralty had expressed an interest in buying about 3,000 tons of plate, which may have been in addition to the earlier secret contract that Walker and Bachelor were supervising.27 On 28 September Newton sent a telegram from the British Legation in Prague to say that 200 tons of armour plates were ready to be delivered and suggested that they should be sent to Britain via the Polish port of Gdynia.28 The Czech authorities had agreed to facilitate this export and Newton suggested that Poland be contacted to make the necessary arrangements. Both these items required continued Czech cooperation and should have ensured that Czechoslovakia received fair treatment, at least from Britain.\n\nThe Munich Conference But neither Britain nor France felt that they were prepared to fight for what they considered a distant country that neither knew nor cared much about. France had hoped an alliance with Czechoslovakia would help protect against a resurgent Germany, not the other way round. Chamberlain wanted to avoid the horrors of another major war and had been informed in Cabinet that the British army was still weak, though rearmament had begun. If he had realised that his action in giving way to Hitler would have allowed Hitler to equip another 11 infantry divisions with modern weapons after March 1939, he might\n\nCrowhurst_Chapter01.indd 32\n\n7/1/2013 4:22:19 PM\n\nDEEPENING CRISIS\n\n33\n\nhave thought twice before accepting Mussolini’s suggestion. As it was, the proposal for a conference at Munich on 29 September was accepted and was greeted with relief by public opinion. At Munich Mussolini presented Britain and France with proposals that had been decided by Hitler in advance, but which Hitler pretended he had not seen. He welcomed them as a solution to the Sudeten problem. The discussions, which lasted for a total of 13 hours, resulted in an agreement to transfer areas occupied by a majority of German speakers to Germany in stages. The transfer was to begin on 1 October and be completed by 10 October. The four powers also called on the Czechoslovak government to settle its differences with Hungary and Poland as soon as possible. The negotiations were finally finished early on the morning of 29 September and the Czech representatives received a copy at 2 a.m. The first official information given to the Czech government was a letter from Hencke, the German Chargé d’Affaires in Prague, to the Czechoslovak Minister of Foreign Affairs at 6.20 a.m. on 30 September.29 This enclosed the text of the agreement that had been made by the four powers and invited the Czechoslovak government to send a representative and a military expert to a meeting of the International Commission. It assumed that the Czechoslovak government would accept the terms. The first meeting of the International Commission was to be held at 5 p.m. the same day, at the German Foreign Ministry. It provided virtually no opportunity for the International Commission to discuss the arrangements for the transfer, which was to begin the following day. The Czechoslovak government was also given very little time to reply. It was the Italian ambassador who was given the task of seeing the Czechoslovak president or ‘some other high Czechoslovak official’, urging him to accept the Munich Agreement and avoid any incidents during the transfer of territory.30 At about noon the principal Italian, French and British diplomats met Krofta, the Czech Foreign Minister, who told them bluntly: ‘The President and the Government submit to the conditions of the Munich Agreement which has come into being without Czechoslovakia and against her’. When the French ambassador tried to offer condolences, he was cut short: ‘We have been forced into this situation; now everything is at an end; today it is our turn, tomorrow it will be the turn of others.’ When\n\nCrowhurst_Chapter01.indd 33\n\n7/1/2013 4:22:19 PM\n\n34\n\nHITLER\n\nAND\n\nCZECHOSLOVAKIA\n\nIN\n\nWWII\n\nthe British representative said, with some difficulty, that Chamberlain had ‘done his utmost’ he received the same reply. At 12.50 p.m. Hencke was informed that Mastný, the Czechoslovak ambassador in Berlin, and General Husárek of the general staff, would fly to Berlin. They reached the German Foreign Ministry in time to attend the second part of the session. By then the commission, which had begun the meeting at 5.30 p.m., had already agreed to appoint a sub-committee to handle the evacuation of Zone I (which consisted of territory with at least 90 per cent German speakers). The commission had also agreed that the supervision of the Czech evacuation and German occupation would be left to German and Czech liaison officers. This removed the matter from international control and left it in German hands. The other main issue, the defining of the areas in which a plebiscite should be held, was also left to a sub-committee. The Czech representatives were not invited to speak and the meeting lasted less than four hours. At no other time in history has a state been destroyed so quickly. It is easy to condemn Chamberlain. Immediately after the war there was considerable discussion about the causes of Munich. The French historian Étienne Mantoux, writing in 1946, summed up the general sense of postwar frustration: In the dismal days of September 1938, when the best hearts were rent between a sense of honour and a love of peace, the life and liberty of Czechoslovakia weighed very little against the heavy pressure of the ‘guilt complex’ [of Versailles]. After all, was it not only a question of frontiers? The perils of the future lay not in frontiers or sovereignties, but in food, coal and transport.31 That sums up historical opinion after the war. In Prague, after the Munich Conference, Krofta tried to get the Germans to end anti-Czech propaganda and his deputy asked for details of the imprisonment and ill-treatment in Germany of an important Czech Foreign Ministry official. Both Krofta and his deputy stressed that this made it difficult for the Czechoslovak government to carry out the Munich Agreement. It was also the Czech wish that the agreement would herald a new era in Czech–German relations ‘now that all points of friction, including,\n\nCrowhurst_Chapter01.indd 34\n\n7/1/2013 4:22:20 PM\n\nDEEPENING CRISIS\n\n35\n\nfor all practical purposes, the Russian pact, had been removed by the Munich Agreement’. The Czechs wished for coexistence between the ‘great [German] and the small Czech people, inspired by mutual respect’.32 Hencke expressed similar views and asked for all Reich nationals to be released from prison as a gesture of goodwill.\n\nRenewed Polish and Hungarian demands The Polish government also renewed its pressure. About midnight on 30 September Poland demanded the transfer of the area of Teschen and Freistadt, and a plebiscite in the surrounding area, to be agreed by 2 October.33 Its tone was peremptory and a summary was sent by the British legation in Prague to the Foreign Office. The language is similar to that used by Hitler and offered ample opportunity for further disputes on points of detail. The main points were: 1. The Czechoslovak [plan] is entirely insufficient and dilatory and [the] Polish Government can no longer have faith in declarations of [the] Czechoslovak Government. 2. [The] Polish Government therefore make[s] [the]following categorical demands: (a) Evacuation of a certain defined area within 24 hours as from mid-day October 1. (b) The cession of [the] remainder of [the] districts of Teschen Frysztat within ten days starting from the same date. (c) Public utilities and communications in evacuated areas to be left intact and defensive works to be disarmed. (d) [The] Question of plebiscite in other areas to be subsequently agreed between the two Governments with the possible participation of third parties. (e) Persons of Polish tongue born in [the] districts of Teschen Frysztat to be immediately released from military service and all political prisoners of Polish origin to be released. (f) A reply accepting or rejecting demands [is] to be given by midday October 1. Should [this] reply not be forthcoming or contain\n\nCrowhurst_Chapter01.indd 35\n\n7/1/2013 4:22:20 PM\n\n36\n\nHITLER\n\nAND\n\nCZECHOSLOVAKIA\n\nIN\n\nWWII\n\na refusal [the] Polish Government will hold [the] Czechoslovak Government solely responsible for the consequences.34 Beneš had appealed to Britain for support against these Polish demands. He had pointed out that if the Polish claim was met, it would not only take important coalmines but would also cut rail communications between the Czech and Slovak lands. But after Munich, such hopes of support were in vain and on 1 October Beneš accepted the Polish ultimatum.35 The same day Morton, the British military attaché in Prague, informed Major General Ismay at the Committee of Imperial Defence that the Czechs had offered to sell arms to Britain.36 Although these were a different calibre to the standard British weapons, Morton warned: ‘If the four Power agreement involves the Czechs handing them to the Germans, it will be necessary to keep a close watch on what happens to them. If they are not used to strengthen German defence forces, the Germans may endeavour to sell them to countries already armed with weapons of a similar type [i.e. Romania, Yugoslavia], obtaining thereby further political and economic advantages. Or the weapons may be used in Spain, China, Palestine etc [Palestine was a British mandated territory].’ This perceptive and important comment was apparently ignored, with disastrous consequences for the subsequent war. At the same time that Beneš was forced to accept the Anglo-French terms, the Hungarians made a similar claim for self-determination for Slovaks and Ruthenes.37 But for Britain and France, the immediate crisis was over. The Sudeten question had been settled, the transfer of land would take place under international supervision and the future of the remainder of the state was guaranteed. They also assumed that the Hungarian and Polish problems would also be solved quickly and peacefully. The four powers had agreed a framework for carrying out the Munich Agreement that on the surface appeared reasonable. It provided for international supervision of the handover of territory. Census returns were available to establish the proportions of German and Czech speakers. Property in these territories was to be handed over intact and no damage would be done to public utilities. A moratorium was imposed which prevented companies with branches in the Sudetenland transferring goods from there to the Czech area.38 The Czechs were to be\n\nCrowhurst_Chapter01.indd 36\n\n7/1/2013 4:22:20 PM\n\nDEEPENING CRISIS\n\n37\n\nallowed to remove weapons, ammunition and artillery from their defensive system, which were in the first two zones.39 There was to be provision for exchange of individuals and families who might wish to change from one ethnic area to another. Also, the rights of any Sudeten Germans who continued to live outside the new German territory would be protected. Many of the arrangements would take time to put into practice. It was also agreed that soldiers from Britain, France and Italy would supervise the transfer of territory. But almost immediately questions were raised which invalidated the proposals: should these be regular soldiers or reservists? Should they be armed? What powers would they have? It was suggested that the British contingent would consist of members of the British Legion, but they were not suitable for this role. Instead, the British wanted to send regular troops. Italians proposed to use reservists. It was also difficult to agree whether they should be armed. This was only one problem. Another was the appointment of observers for the plebiscite, for which the Saar plebiscite was to be the model, and which would be held before the end of November.40 Each issue had to be agreed between the four powers and by the Czechoslovak government. To simplify matters and try to make progress, sub-committees were created to deal with specific matters and these reported back to the main committee, of which the chairman was the German Foreign Minister. On the very first day, 1 October, the commission realised that the Czechs would not have enough time to remove guns and ammunition from the former frontier defences.41 On 2 October the French agreed with the Czechs that they should be given extra time: 15 days to remove the heavy guns and ammunition.42 The same day, Hitler told the German members of the commission his plans for plebiscites.43 The demand for these had always formed part of his strategy for seizing the Sudetenland and he made it clear that he intended to take full advantage of this concession.\n\nTransfer of territory Where there was a large German majority, the area in which a plebiscite would be held should be enlarged to include surrounding territory. The Germans hoped they would get that as well. Hitler was prepared to\n\nCrowhurst_Chapter01.indd 37\n\n7/1/2013 4:22:20 PM\n\n38\n\nHITLER\n\nAND\n\nCZECHOSLOVAKIA\n\nIN\n\nWWII\n\nexchange small German language enclaves for similar Czech ones. He would insist, however, that the area between Zwittau and Silesia – the whole northern frontier territory – would become German. The result of the proposed plebiscites would leave 300,000 Germans in Czechoslovakia. Of these, 140,000 would be in Slovakia and the Ruthene area, 30,000 of which would be in Pressburg (Slovak Bratislava), 18,000 in the language enclave of Iglau in Moravia, about 40,000 in Prague, 50,000 in Brno and the remainder in other small language islands. The Germans also wanted to have a plebiscite in Mährisch-Ostrau (the Moravian part, south of the River Ostravice, of the industrial city of Ostrava). Hitler believed that the majority of the population were Polish speaking (termed locally Slonzaks) and pro-German, and that there was also many Germans.44 Success in this plebiscite would give Hitler control of one of the main Czechoslovak steel producers, the important Vítkovice works. These were important details, but they were ignored by British diplomats. British public opinion had welcomed Chamberlain’s claim to have achieved ‘peace in our time’ and avoid war. They were unaware of the way the agreement had been manipulated by the Germans. One of those who supported the agreement was Sir Roger Lumley, Governor of Bombay, who ‘praised the courage of Chamberlain to avoid war’.45 He believed that it was right that Chamberlain had saved the lives of 10 million or so by sacrificing ‘under pressure and threats’ the minorities in Czechoslovakia, which would not have been worth a war. He also believed that if Britain did declare war, it would be better to do it when the country was better prepared. Meanwhile, it appeared that the first stage of the transfer was going smoothly. In the predominantly German areas, the German soldiers were apparently given a warm welcome. Troops marched along streets lined with Nazi banners and crowds lining the streets giving the Nazi salute.46 It was the same in the countryside, where smiling, relaxed German soldiers were welcomed as liberators from Czech oppression.47 But these pictures were intended as propaganda. As one Sudeten, Eric Pasold, who had become by then a British citizen, wrote later: It was with a heavy heart that I followed the advance of the German troops, read about border incidents, and looked at the\n\nCrowhurst_Chapter01.indd 38\n\n7/1/2013 4:22:20 PM\n\nDEEPENING CRISIS\n\n39\n\nphotographs of so many familiar places. There was a picture of the barrier being raised at the frontier at Wildenau to let Hitler’s army enter, of the main street at Asch lined with cheering men, women and children, of the historic market square at Eger packed with people giving the Nazi salute, and of swastika flags everywhere. Yet I knew that the hearts of thousands of Sudetenlanders were as heavy as mine, in spite of the photographs in The Times which told a story of nothing but jubilation and flowers for the Führer and his soldiers.48 Hitler had already made preparations for absorbing the Sudeten territory into the Nazi state. On 1 October Hitler issued an order appointing Henlein as Reichskommissar for the Sudeten territory.49 His main responsibility was the full incorporation [Aufbau] of the area into the German Reich. But Henlein did not have supreme power in the Sudetenland. This was reserved for the military commander of the occupying forces who held the title Oberbefehlshaber des Heeresgruppen.50 This person had three tasks: the arrest of named political figures, the issue of new (German Reich) laws, and the appointment of officials to enforce the new legal arrangements. Germans quickly put their own interpretation on the Munich Agreement. It had been agreed at Munich that the Czechs would be allowed to remove weapons and equipment from the defences, and they had been given extra time to do this. But when Czech soldiers began to remove concrete anti-tank ‘hedgehogs’ on 3 October they were stopped by the Germans.51 Hitler had already decided that he would not wait for international approval of the transfer, as agreed at Munich, but would immediately incorporate the Sudetenland into Germany. One result was that Ernst Woermann, Director of the Political Department, refused to accept a British proposal that there should be international control of the transfer. On 3 October, the International Commission gave way and agreed that the neutral zone separating the German and Czech troops would be supervised by Czech police until German troops arrived. The commission also noted that a fight had broken out between Germans after the occupation; Nazis were taking revenge on their opponents. When Polish troops entered the Teschen area, Hungary demanded\n\nCrowhurst_Chapter01.indd 39\n\n7/1/2013 4:22:20 PM\n\n40\n\nHITLER\n\nAND\n\nCZECHOSLOVAKIA\n\nIN\n\nWWII\n\nthat talks on the Hungarian minority should begin three days later, on 6 October. Henke, reporting from Prague, said that the Hungarians wanted Slovakia to be independent of Prague so that they could take control of that and Ruthene lands, but were opposed by Italy.52 Poland, with an interest in small Polish minority groups in northern Slovakia, wanted Slovakia to be independent. There were also Slovak demands for independence from Czechoslovakia. The question of plebiscites – a matter of interest to Hungary and Poland as well as Germany – was taken a stage further on 4 October. Germany proposed that the 1918 statistics should be used and where there was a 51 per cent German majority, the area should go to Germany. The Czechs opposed this very strongly and it was only after several hours’ discussion that a French compromise was accepted: that the statistics of 1910 and 1921 were to be compared and an average taken. It was rapidly becoming clear, however, that the four powers were not going to let Czech opposition delay the process. The next day, 5 October, the four powers agreed the line of the new frontier, which German troops would reach by 10 October. Their decision was based on population statistics of 1918, and they agreed the figure of 51 per cent German as forming the majority population.53 The Czechs argued against this, because it would give Germany control of a much larger area and cut important Czech road and rail communications. It would also leave Czech groups in German territory. To overcome the problem of minority groups, the Germans suggested exchanging populations ‘as soon as possible’. The Munich Agreement had specified that people would have the right to move within six months and a German–Czech commission would consider the matter. A memorandum by Weizsäcker, the State Secretary, shows that Germany was using international support to defeat Czech opposition. Referring to Czech territory that he wanted for Germany, Weizsäcker wrote: ... it was just at that very point that there could be no tampering with the frontier line on the part of the Germans. Trifling deviations from the strict ethnographical determination of the zones to be transferred without a plebiscite were of course contemplated in the Munich Agreement in certain exceptional cases.\n\nCrowhurst_Chapter01.indd 40\n\n7/1/2013 4:22:20 PM\n\nDEEPENING CRISIS\n\n41\n\nFor the place under discussion, however, no amendment could be considered. The Italian representative then made the following proposal. In order to meet the anxiety of the Czech delegates regarding the cutting of certain railway lines which would be absorbed into German-occupied territory, these railway lines should be crossed as late as possible – but naturally within the time limit fixed for 10 October. The Czech and German authorities should also get in touch with each other at once, to regulate this through traffic, also for the period after German occupation. The German delegate urged the Czechs to deliver their answer to the proposal of the four powers immediately, if possible in the course of the evening but at the latest by midday on 6 October [the following day]. The difficulties entailed by a delay in this answer were obvious – the entry of the troops on 6 October was imminent. The Czech representatives were then, at a suitable moment, confronted with the protocol of the session of midday on the 5th, which the four powers had already agreed on and were committed to.54 The episode demonstrates the way that Hitler was able to take the parts of the Sudetenland that he wanted for strategic or economic reasons. The Germans were able to produce maps that showed, or claimed to show, authentic records of ethnic distribution. Neither Henderson, the British ambassador, nor François-Poncet, the French ambassador, had any idea whether these were accurate when they signed the protocol. By the time the British government realised what had happened and reprimanded Henderson, it was too late. What both ambassadors wanted was a smooth transfer of territory that would restore cordial international relations. Hitler had stated that this was his last territorial demand. When the Czechs pointed to the effects of these proposals on the Czechoslovak economy, Attolico, the Italian ambassador, pretended to play the role of honest broker. The end result was never in doubt. German dominance was emphasised by the peremptory refusal to make any serious concession and by the German demand for immediate agreement. The same day, Hungary renewed its pressure on the Czech government by claiming that Hungarians were\n\nCrowhurst_Chapter01.indd 41\n\n7/1/2013 4:22:20 PM\n\n42\n\nHITLER\n\nAND\n\nCZECHOSLOVAKIA\n\nIN\n\nWWII\n\nstill being persecuted. The Czech reply was to propose starting negotiations on 15 October, by which time the Sudeten transfer would have been completed. Encouraged by Czech weakness, Slovak separatists also increased their demands for independence. The executive committee of the HSL met on 5 October at Žilina and the Populists and all other Slovak parties except for the Social Democrats agreed to pursue the Populist demand for autonomy. This envisaged the transfer of power to a Slovak autonomous government of five ministers, who were to be appointed by Tiso, the vice-president of the Populist Party. The Prague government was forced to give way and Tiso was appointed minister for Slovak administration on 6 October. What had formerly been Czechoslovakia now became Czecho-slovakia, a federal state.\n\nResignation of Beneš These events made it impossible for Beneš to remain as President. His policy of cooperation with Britain and France and his support for the League of Nations had totally failed to protect Czechoslovakia. It was announced on 6 October that he would resign.

The immediate result was the appointment of\n\nCrowhurst_Chapter01.indd 42\n\n7/1/2013 4:22:20 PM\n\nDEEPENING CRISIS\n\n43\n\na new Foreign Minister, Chvalkovsky, who epitomised the new Czech subservience to Germany. His first request was that Germany should guarantee the new Czechoslovak state, but he was informed that this would not be done until all outstanding questions had been settled. One concerned the Hungarian minority. Hungary tried to exploit Czechoslovakia’s weakness, appealing again for German support and claiming that Hitler had promised Pressburg (Slovak Bratislava) to Hungary. This new Hungarian demand created problems for Hitler. His dream of expansion eastward assumed that both the Czech and Slovak lands would become German puppet states. Hungary had recently announced a large military budget and had designs on the whole of Slovakia and the Ruthene area. If Hungary got these, it would block German eastward expansion. There was also the danger, from Hitler’s point of view, that if Hungary gained the Ruthene territory it would have a common frontier with Poland. There had already been sign"
