        "text": "Mobile diagnostic imaging provider medneo UK has been acquired by private markets manager CVC for an undisclosed sum through its infrastructure strategy platform, CVC DIF.\n\nMedneo UK, which specialises in providing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) to UK National Health Service (NHS) trusts and healthcare providers, was established in 2018. Its parent company is Berlin-headquartered medneo Group, which was founded in 2011 and also has operations in Germany and Switzerland.\n\nWith a fleet of more than 20 mobile scanning vehicles and a centre in West London, medneo UK provides MRI and CT imaging services to more than 130,000 patients per year.\n\nAccording to a financial statement for the year ended 31 December 2023, medneo UK’s 2023 revenue climbed by over 18% in 2022 to almost £19m.\n\nUnder the acquisition, which CVC said will support the next phase of medneo UK’s growth, current medneo UK CEO Andy Spellman will stay on in his role.\n\n“With CVC DIF’s support, we will be able to expand our services to serve even more patients whilst maintaining our focus on exemplary patient and customer care,” commented Spellman.\n\nCVC DIF was established last year after CVC acquired Amsterdam-headquartered DIF for an undisclosed sum.\n\nCVC DIF partner and CIF investments head William Jansonius said CVC’s role in supporting medneo UK’s growth would include providing further investment to expand its fleet of scanners.\n\nOther healthcare entities in CVC’s investment portfolio include New Jersey-headquartered pharmaceutical company Alvogen and France’s Cooper Consumer Health.\n\nAccording to GlobalData, the UK’s diagnostic imaging market was valued at around $900m in 2023. Growing at a CAGR of 4.7%, it is projected to reach a valuation of almost $1.5bn by 2033."
