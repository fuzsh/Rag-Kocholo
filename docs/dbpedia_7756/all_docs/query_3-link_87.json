        "text": "By Scott Williams\n\nThe Journal Times\n\nWATERFORD, Wis. — The director of the village’s ambulance services has resigned after being notified that the Wisconsin Department of Health Services is revoking his paramedic license.\n\nThomas Nehring was appointed EMS director after village leaders in May split the fire department into two departments — one for fire protection and one for ambulance services.\n\nNehring, 36, had served as a captain and assistant chief at the Waterford Fire Department before becoming EMS director.\n\nDHS said Nehring’s conviction on child endangerment charges last November in Ohio made the revocation “necessary to protect the public health, safety, or welfare.”\n\n“Your conviction for endangering a child displays a willingness to risk the health and safety of individuals under your care,” wrote Natalie Easterday, the state’s director of emergency health care. “Endangering the safety of individuals under your care is incompatible with the duties of an EMS professional.”\n\nNehring was charged in October 2023 with child endangerment, defined in Ohio law as “creating a substantial risk to a child’s health or safety.” The misdemeanor charge is punishable by up to six months in jail.\n\nAccording to the Williams County Sheriff’s Office, the incident happened Aug. 11, 2023, while Nehring and his family were returning from Vermont to Wisconsin.\n\nWhile driving through Ohio, a child in the back seat of the vehicle reportedly was misbehaving and Nehring was accused of using duct tape to subdue the child.\n\nNehring’s wife reportedly became upset and took photos, which later were obtained by police.\n\nNehring pleaded no contest and was found guilty last November in Bryan Municipal Court. He was sentenced to 90 days in jail and fined $350, although a judge stayed the jail sentence for two years on the condition that Nehring not re-offend.\n\nAccording to DHS, Nehring should have disclosed the conviction within 48 hours, but he did not report it until May 2024.\n\nJerry Biggart, chairman of the state’s EMS Advisory Board, said license revocations for criminal conduct are common, especially if the conduct involves a “vulnerable” population, such as children.\n\nNehring could not be reached for comment.\n\nVillage Administrator Zeke Jackson declined to comment except to confirm that Nehring had resigned and had been replaced as EMS director.\n\n“I will not be taking questions on the topic,” Jackson said.\n\nAccording to DHS, Nehring has until Aug. 15 to file an appeal of license revocation."
