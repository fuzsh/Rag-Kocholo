This book will take you across continental Europe offering an introduction to each of the festival stages that have illuminated the works of William Shakespeare over the last seventy or so years. You will travel across the length and breadth of the continent: from the (mostly) balmy south to the (often) chilly north, from the planes of central Spain, to the Rhodope Mountains of southwest Bulgaria, to the sea-swept Baltic settings of Gdańsk and of ‘Hamlet’s’ castle in Helsingør, Denmark. You will see the widest imaginable variety of theatrical and artistic offering on a range of stages, from castles, parks and historic theatres to black box spaces, streets and bars. You will hear the works of Shakespeare spoken in many European tongues and in languages from far beyond the continent’s borders. In short, you have here an analytical map for a Shakespearean Grand Tour. Unlike its eighteenth-century antecedent, this Grand Tour is not devoted to the consumption of ancient and enduring monuments of lost cultures and empires. Rather it is a Grand Tour of the exquisitely ephemeral, a journey to sample fashions, trends\n\n2\n\nSHAKESPEARE ON EUROPEAN FESTIVAL STAGES\n\nFIGURE 1.1 A map of European Shakespeare festivals in 2020.\n\nand innovations in theatre-making as mediated through the lingua franca of live Shakespearean performance. Preparations for this book began some years ago when, noting the relative paucity of literature on European Shakespeare festivals, the editors held a sequence of seminars on the theme in Paris, Montpellier, Worcester and elsewhere, often at the biennial conferences of the European Shakespeare Research Association (ESRA). These seminars were rich and stimulating in their own right, but also enabled us to identify the resident experts on each of the fourteen festivals featured in this book and commission the following chapters. These chapters are written by scholars who have long-standing relationships with their respective festivals, sometimes as critics or dramaturges or advisors. They write with insight, expertise and local knowledge. A researcher in live arts is first and foremost a lover of performance, although fascinated spectating and distanced analysis may a priori seem two stances that are difficult to reconcile. The spectator’s pleasure sets off the researcher’s desire to work on the performance, which means overcoming fascination (or at least suspending it) to adopt a critical distance. The paradox is certainly one of the difficulties the\n\nAN INTRODUCTION\n\n3\n\nresearcher in performance studies must learn to deal with. In some cases, the spectator’s frustration may turn out to be the researcher’s good fortune. Failure to fulfil the spectator’s desire and meet his or her expectations can provide an analytic counterpoint to study the creative process at work in a theatrical performance. These dialectics between proximity and distance, love and alienation, play out in the following pages. Equally, given the anti-festive pandemic context in which the book was completed, a year of loss and longing and theatre closures, it is perhaps unsurprising that our authors err more towards celebration than critique. For much of its recent history, the continent of Europe has been preoccupied with the fraught challenge of forging a peaceable consensus in the wake of the catastrophic first half of the twentieth century. Such a cooperative understanding – especially in the context of the growth of what we now call the European Union – depended on the identification and ratification of shared norms, values and definitions. In an analogous spirit of norm-setting and transparency, we will use this introduction to define each of the keywords in the book’s title and in doing so offer previews of the places to which each chapter will take us.\n\nShakespeare When faced with the challenge to define ‘Shakespeare’ in a previous work on European Shakespeare, Balz Engler asked ‘Does the term refer to a person, to a set of printed texts, to a cultural icon, to a theatrical tradition, or to a combination of all of these?’ (2003: 27). The ‘Shakespeare’ in the following pages has little to do with the historical person and everything to do with the ways in which the printed texts ascribed to that person have been theatrically staged in European festivals devoted in part or in whole to those works. Writing in the same volume as Engler at the turn of the millennium, Angel-Luis Pujante and Ton Hoenselaars described a long historical shift of critical perspective – a shift that their own work greatly encouraged – that had served effectively to decentre what they called ‘English Shakespeare’. After this shift, ‘it was no longer necessary to regard translations or foreign Shakespeare performances as adaptations or fallings off from the native stock’; Shakespeare was\n\n4\n\nSHAKESPEARE ON EUROPEAN FESTIVAL STAGES\n\nrather ‘a quarry for a pan-European lexis or collection of myths’ (2003: 24). It is notable that contributors to this book do not refer with any frequency to the UK or Great Britain. The Shakespeare found here is both pan-European and post-English, a truly globalized phenomenon, floating across cultures and largely untethered to its point of origin. The works have been performed and celebrated for so many decades and even centuries in these continental European locations that the nationality of the author appears to have become almost irrelevant. One of the editors is here reminded of an informal conversation they had with Carlos Cedran, an eminent theatremaker in Cuba: ‘Shakespeare isn’t English; Shakespeare is theatre.’ Across continental Europe ‘Shakespeare’ also acts as a relatively uncomplicated, post-national umbrella under which to gather theatre-makers from different countries and cultures. As you will also see in the following chapters, ‘Shakespeare’making happens differently from festival to festival. In the case of the Four Castles Shakespeare Festival in Prague, Brno, Ostrava and Bratislava, ‘Shakespeare’ signifies native, open-air productions performed in Czech and sometimes Slovak translations. In the cases of the festivals at Gyula (Hungary), Gdańsk (Poland), Craiova (Romania) and Neuss (Germany), ‘Shakespeare’ signifies a range of international, polyglot productions often curated according to a theme or focused on multiple versions of the same text. At the Almagro Festival in central Spain, ‘Shakespeare’ is not the raison d’être for the festival and indeed is barely mentioned on the festival website, so ‘Shakespeare’ means one playwright among many in the European (but specifically Iberian) ‘Golden Age’. In the small village of Patalenitsa in Bulgaria, ‘Shakespeare’ means community theatre made for and mostly by the residents of this remarkable location. In southern France, at festivals in Avignon, Nice and Montpellier, ‘Shakespeare’ has long connoted a humanist model for an inclusive, democratic theatre, a catalyst for social cohesion, ‘a theatre that trusts in man’, according to Roland Barthes (1954: 430–1).\n\nShakespeare/European As Tony Judt points out, Europe isn’t really a geographic continent, ‘just a subcontinental annexe to Asia’ (2005: xiii). Our focus is\n\nAN INTRODUCTION\n\n5\n\non Shakespeare festivals based on this subcontinental land mass. There is no place for the UK or its variety of Shakespeare festivals in this definition of ‘European’, although British practitioners and companies do figure in the history of some of the continental festivals featured here. It might be tempting to view our choice to exclude the UK through the prism of Brexit: if a slim majority of UK citizens voted in 2016 to take the UK ‘out’ of Europe, who are we to deny the will of the people (or those people of their particular Anglo-nationalist Will)? More pertinently, though, we felt that a single chapter on Shakespeare festivals in the UK could offer only a superficial account, ranging, as it would have to do, from David Garrick’s Stratford Jubilee to the present day. Furthermore, this book is structured chronologically and this would have meant opening with the UK chapter, thus setting exactly the wrong tone for a book that wishes to decentre ‘English Shakespeare’. Geopolitics and theatre history ask a common question: ‘Who’s in and who’s out?’ In selecting our festivals, we have tried to include every major extant festival at the time of writing. Some smaller, shorter festivals have not made the cut. These include the Bitola Shakespeare Festival (Macedonia) and Shakespeare in Catalonia, both of which run for roughly one week and are – at the time of writing – either still in an embryonic stage of development or (in the case of Shakespeare in Catalonia, 2003–15) apparently suspended or defunct. Shakespeare in Turkey and the Armenian Shakespeare Festival are both of great interest but perhaps belong to a book more closely focused on Shakespeare production and reception in Eurasia. We considered a chapter on the Dubrovnik Festival (founded 1950) which, although not a Shakespearean festival per se, has had a tendency to stage Hamlet in Lovrjenac Castle in fits and bursts over the last seventy years. As Ivan Lupić writes, ‘It is as if the Festival gets tired of Hamlet, but cannot live without Hamlet’ (2014). In the event, this book covers nearly every active member festival of the European Shakespeare Festivals Network, which was founded in 2010 in order to help festivals ‘exchange information and experience, participate in common projects, and mutually inspire each other for future ventures’ (‘ESFN’ 2021). Although the ESFN currently contains two UK institutions, the York Shakespeare Festival and Shakespeare’s Globe (the latter of which is not really a ‘festival’, given its year-round activities), the vast majority of members are based in Continental Europe, and the contents of this book reflects that preponderance.\n\n6\n\nSHAKESPEARE ON EUROPEAN FESTIVAL STAGES\n\nShakespeare/European/Festival In a fascinating chapter in The Cambridge Companion to International Theatre Festivals, Ric Knowles describes a range of non-European Indigenous festivals as valuable ‘alternative origin [stories]’ that might help us to ‘consider festivals as sites of exchange rather than the commodification of cultures … as being grounded in the land and in Indigenous knowledge systems rather than in the deterritorializing and decontextualizing programming practices of most contemporary Western festivals’ (2020: 72). ‘Indigenous “festivals”’, Knowles suggests, ‘have always been about learning how to share territory and resources – how to live together “in a good way”’ (73). Such small-scale, localized festivals do indeed offer an attractive model for the future, especially in the present contexts of the climate emergency and global pandemic. But ‘living together “in a good way”’ is not something Europeans have been very good at for most of the last few centuries and what we might call the European Festival Model is clearly a response to that grim fact. As Erika Fischer-Lichte has argued, Wagner’s Bayreuth Festival was conceived in the wake of the failed proto-democratic revolution of 1848/9. The later and equally influential model of the Salzburg Festival can only be understood in the context of the First World War with its co-founder Max Reinhardt viewing the Festival as ‘a peace mission’ and as a ‘place of pilgrimage … for the innumerable people who long to be redeemed through art following the bloody atrocities’ (2020: 89). The number of Europeans who accepted the peace mission offered at Salzburg was wholly insufficient to prevent another war, after which a ruined continent in need of physical and moral reconstruction chose to put its faith in planning, which Tony Judt has described as ‘the unofficial religion of postwar Europe’ (2005: 66f.). The postwar creation of welfare states meant planned housing, education, health care and transport by interventionist governments, but it also meant planned culture, with the rise of international festivals in particular as one component of the premeditated manufacture of civility. One of the chief architects of postwar Europe, Jean Monnet, reflected: ‘Si c’était à refaire, je commencerais par la culture’ (qtd in Judt 2005: 701), implying that culture might have been even more central to continental\n\nAN INTRODUCTION\n\n7\n\nreconstruction than it was. And yet it did indeed play a major role in shaping a post-nationalist vision of an imagined community. As Karen Zaiontz has argued: International festivals attempted to repair and, to a certain extent, repress the image of the nation as a generator of far-right populism. The emphasis on ‘masterpieces’ was an attempt to swerve towards more official, elite forms of nationalism, which also made claims to universalism, and away from the kind of populist nationalism that defined territorial sovereignty in terms of ethnic purity. (Zaiontz 2020: 15) Of the festivals featured in this book, only the Avignon Festival and the ‘Festivo Shakespeariano’ in Verona date from this immediate postwar period, but many still share the model of reparative festivity and its logic of benevolent cultural exchange. The resistance to the cult of ‘ethnic purity’, for example, was very clearly an impetus for many post-1989 festivals: the Craiova Shakespeare Festival has always embraced Romanian-, Hungarian- and German-speaking theatres from across Romania, while the Shakespeare Festival in (bilingual) Gdańsk often hosts productions from, for example, Lithuania and Germany that draw attention to the city’s complex and richly ‘impure’ pasts. While embracing difference, however, these and other festivals also gesture towards a proto-utopian humanism, one in which, as Hugh Grady has written: Shakespeare is presented as a democratic, international, universally available, free good that takes its place in and for an imagined community. Such a community consists of social beings untrammelled by inequality or social conflict, taking pleasure in universal narratives that affirm the desired continuity of love and courage as a means to a happier world. (2001: 26) Along with Avignon, the key example here is Edinburgh International Festival, also founded in the aftermath of the Second World War, in August 1947, only a few weeks before the Avignon Festival and with a production of the very same play by\n\n8\n\nSHAKESPEARE ON EUROPEAN FESTIVAL STAGES\n\nShakespeare: Richard II. In October 2006, Jonathan Mills, the newly appointed director of the Edinburgh International Festival, gave the Sir William Gillies Lecture at the Royal Scottish Academy and reflected that: The Edinburgh International Festival owes its origins to the urgent imperative to rebuild a sense of community in a continent that had been torn apart by the tragedy of World War II; to restore faith, to heal the heartache of shattered lives through music, opera, drama, dance, literature, painting; to pick up the fragments of a civilisation shaken to its core by the atrocities of Leningrad or Auschwitz. In the words of John Falconer, Lord Provost at the time, it was to be a festival whose ambition was to ‘embrace the world’. (‘EIF’ 2014) This optimistic vision of the healing and peace-making capacity of culture is hardwired into the ethos of festivity and continues to underwrite the philosophy of Shakespeare festival-makers across Europe. In advertising their 2019 season, Ilina Chorevska and Ivan Jerchikj, the artistic directors of the Bitola Shakespeare Festival in Macedonia, invited their audiences to: Imagine the world and humanity came to an end, all our civilization, as we know it today […] it’s supposed [i.e. ‘we suggest’] that it could be rebuilt and reconstructed solely based on the works of William Shakespeare. (Chorevska and Jerchikj 2019) As with Western Europe after the Second World War, so with the former Soviet bloc of Central and Eastern Europe after the collapse of the Soviet Empire in the late 1980s and early 1990s. It is striking that almost half the festivals featured in this book are based in former Soviet bloc countries. Here the paradigmatic case is that of president-playwright Vaclav Havel in Czechoslovakia in 1990. As we learn in Filip Krajník and Eva Kyselová’s chapter, one of Havel’s first acts on becoming president was to commission Shakespearean performances in the grounds of Prague Castle as part of a wider agenda to reform the civic foundations of a fledgling democracy. In his memoir Disturbing the Peace, Havel wrote:\n\nAN INTRODUCTION\n\n9\n\ntheatre doesn’t have to be just a factory for the production of plays or, if you like, a mechanical sum of its plays, directors, actors, ticket-sellers, auditoriums and audiences; it must be something more: a living spiritual and intellectual focus, a place for social self-awareness, a vanishing point where all the lines of force of the age meet, a seismograph of the times, a space, an area of freedom, an instrument of human liberation. (1991: 40) Krajník and Kyselová link the formation of the Four Castles Shakespeare Festival in the Czech and Slovak republics with a wider ‘espousal of Western culture’, towards which both republics pivoted after the fall of Communism (see Chapter 4). Although not necessarily conscious of Havel’s initiation of what would become the Four Castles Shakespeare Festival, other festivals would emerge in many parts of formerly Soviet Europe: in Craiova (Romania) in 1994, in Gdańsk (Poland) in 1997, in Patalenitsa (Bulgaria) in 1999, in Gyula (Hungary) in 2005 and in Indija (Serbia) in 2014, each of which festivals has a chapter in this book. Boika Sokolova has written of how, under Communism, Shakespearean theatre provided ‘a privately darkened emotional space’ that made political dissent possible (qtd by Pujante and Hoenselaars 2003: 21). These festivals have, in their varied ways, brought Shakespeare’s works out into the light, making them vehicles for – inter alia – an opening of borders and reconnection with a cross-national network of theatre-makers, a celebration of local, regional and national excellence, and (not insignificantly) a pretext for restorative joy. If, according to Dennis Kennedy, Shakespeare was part of a ‘cultural Marshall plan’ in Western Europe after the Second World War (1993: 81), Shakespearean production in Central and Eastern Europe during the Cold War also points at the playwright’s enlistment as a ‘cold warrior’ (Kennedy 2003). In the context of the emergence of multiple Central and Eastern European Shakespeare festivals, it is also possible to think about Shakespeare as a post-cold warrior. But then again, history is restless and cosmopolitanism is not inevitable: witness the rise in the 2010s and since of populist and nationalist governments in Hungary and Poland. It may or may not be indicative of a less open future that, as Ágnes Matuska and Júlia Paraizs note in their chapter, the 2020 programme of the international Shakespeare Festival at Gyula was to be a ‘Hungarian Shakespeare edition’ showing only Hungarian-language productions.\n\n10\n\nSHAKESPEARE ON EUROPEAN FESTIVAL STAGES\n\nShakespeare/European/Festival/ Stages Finally, we would like to introduce the types of stages featured in this book. Given the widely discussed ways in which festivals in general exceed the architectural limits of any given theatre/s and radiate outwards in the process known as ‘festivalization’, it makes sense to think of ‘stages’ and ‘places’ as locked in a relationship that can be symbiotic and/or dialectical. The visibility and impact of a given festival will vary depending on the size of its location. Some of the festivals in this book – for example, those in Rome, Verona, Prague and Nice – take place in cities with large populations, widespread, year-round artistic provision and a well-established tourist industry. This is not untypical. Marjana Johansson has observed that of the 715 arts festivals belonging to the ‘Europe for Festival – Festivals for Europe’ association, thirty-seven list only ‘theatre’ as a keyword, and ‘of the thirty-seven festivals, only three are held in cities or towns with fewer than 50,000 inhabitants’ (2020: 63). It is striking, then, that five of the Shakespeare festivals in this book take place in towns or cities with fewer than fifty thousand inhabitants, namely: Almagro (pop. 9,000), Gyula (pop. 32,000), Patalenitsa (pop. 1,300), Helsingør/Elsinore (pop. 47,000) and Indija (also pop. c. 47,000). Thus Shakespeare festivals are disproportionately likely to occur in a small- to medium-sized town when compared with theatre festivals in general, doubtless because the magnetic pull of the Shakespeare brand can survive relocation to an otherwise small and/or overlooked town or city (just as it has in the United States at ‘destination’ festivals in Cedar City, Utah, or Ashland, Oregon). The case of ‘Shakespeare in Catalonia’ might be instructive, a festival which began in the small town of Santa Susanna in the Maresme region of Catalonia, moved to Mataró, the capital of the region, then finally relocated to Barcelona for what appear to have been its last two editions in 2013 and 2015. Reading across this volume, it is notable that most festivals are synonymous with one or more pre-existing historical spaces. Only two of these are ‘genuine’ and bespoke classical or early modern theatrical spaces: the Teatro Romano, Verona, and the Corral de Comedias in Almagro, built in 1628, and rediscovered and restored in the 1950s. The most common extra-theatrical stage setting for\n\nAN INTRODUCTION\n\n11\n\nEuropean Shakespeare festivals is that of the castle, whether in Prague, Brno, Bratislava, Ostrava, Gyula or Helsingørg. Even if the relevant castle burned down in the nineteenth century and was since rebuilt – as at Ostrava and Bratislava – the contemporary, restored version retains an early modern patina and affect. To these examples, we might add the Villa Stanković, home to the Itaka Shakespeare Festival, which although built in 1930 is sited on the footprint of a Roman villa and was modelled on medieval Serbian castles. When Americans see an empty park, they tend to fill it with Shakespeare; for continental Europeans, the equivalent appears to be a castle. Here, again, a defining influence would appear to be Avignon, a medieval city whose various historic buildings and monuments – most notably the Palais des Papes – are repurposed as theatrical venues each summer. The effects of staging Shakespeare against historic backdrops are complex. On the one hand, such settings can suggest or even enforce a sense of dislocation from the here and now to an essentialized pastness. As Hamilakis and Yalouri write: Ancient monuments … provide the most powerful currency of [a] specific site of symbolic capital, due to their materiality, visibility (especially in case of prominent architectural monuments), authenticity, age and sense of timelessness … They [are] instrumental in constructing a topos, that [is] at the same time within history and outside it. A topos structured by specific temporality: a monumental time distinct from the ‘social’ experiential time of everyday life. (1999: 125–6) The same might also be said of some of the pseudo-historical spaces analysed in this book, imitation theatres like the Silvano Toti Globe in Rome or the Neuss Globe in Germany. The spectacularly remodelled Shakespeare Theatre Gdańsk, while technically sophisticated and highly flexible in its various configurations, also firmly gestures backwards, to the playing space that hosted visiting troupes of English actors to the influential Hanseatic merchant city in the seventeenth century. Given the preponderance of such historical and pseudo-historical spaces in European Shakespeare festivals, one might expect a tendency towards conservative, nostalgic or ‘traditional’ spectacles.\n\n12\n\nSHAKESPEARE ON EUROPEAN FESTIVAL STAGES\n\nIn fact, though, these festival stages host a great variety of aesthetic practices and trends, up to and including the types of post-dramatic productions routinely seen in non-festive settings in, for example, well-subsidized regional theatres in Germany. In interculturally experimental productions such as Arianne Mnouchkine’s Richard II (1982) at Avignon, or Ong Keng Sen’s Search: Hamlet (2002) at Elsinore, the creative team clearly pushed back against the layered weights of architectural and theatrical history in ways that were both playful and profound. It is also the case that these ‘official’ festival sites are often counterpointed by ‘off’ or ‘fringe’ festivals. A festival is a complex form in itself since it is a ‘meta-event’, that is, a macro-event ‘encompassing a series of single events that are linked by various factors’ (qtd in Hauptfleisch et al. 2007: 6). Such a form becomes even more complex when festivals interact with fringe festivals (Almagro, Avignon, Craiova, Gdańsk) or come to embed micro-festivals within their structure (Le Printemps des comédiens in Montpellier, which frames Le Printemps des collégiens, a Shakespeare school festival, or Shake-Nice! which hosts another school festival, ShakeFreestyle). Whereas some festivals focus on one specific venue, others owe their complex morphology to the proliferation of venues in the city (Craiova, Montpellier, Nice), on its outskirts and even in the neighbouring towns and villages (the Tricity of which Gdańsk is part, or the ways in which the Avignon festival radiates across the city’s suburbs and outlying conurbations).\n\nConclusion The challenges of putting together a book of this type mimic the challenges of the European political project in miniature. As editors, we were anxious to strike a balance between standardization and self-determination, especially as this is the first volume that brings together Shakespeare on festival stages across Europe. Thus, all of the chapters are consistent in offering information about the foundation, location, repertoire and ethos of the featured festival. But how that information is structured and conveyed differs from chapter to chapter and according to what cultural and theatrical work ‘Shakespeare’ performs in each individual instance. Many\n\nAN INTRODUCTION\n\n13\n\ncontributors choose to focus on symptomatic productions or editions of their festival. Anne Sophie Refskou’s chapter offers two case studies of very different site-specific Hamlets to analyse the haunted space that is Elsinore. Ágnes Matuska and Júlia Paraizs focus on three pivotal moments in the history of the Gyula Shakespeare Festival in order to delineate its local, European and global dimensions. Other writers take a deep historical perspective, setting the foundation of their festival within the longue durée of their nation’s relationship to Shakespeare. As Filip Krajník and Eva Kyselová note in their chapter, ‘as for many other European peoples, Shakespeare holds the status of a national author and the history of productions of Shakespeare’s works in the Czech lands closely follows the trajectory of Czech cultural (and, by extension, social and political) history’. Similarly, Vanessa Schormann argues that the long history of German appreciation and adulation of Shakespeare helps explain the advent of the Neuss Globe and the phenomenon she describes as ‘Globolatry’, the celebratory fetish of Shakespeare’s theatre. Both stances are recognizable in the International Shakespeare Festival in Craiova, whose evolution from a venue for theatrical celebration and exchange to a locus of Shakespeare-making – for the stage, as well as in translation, in criticism and in the classroom – Nicoleta Cinpoeş charts in terms of the festival’s agency in cultural policy, civic regeneration and social inclusion. Other chapters plunge us, evocatively and experientially, into the present day: both Boika Sokolova and Kirilka Stavreva (on Bulgaria) and Alexandra Portmann (on Serbia) begin their chapters with accounts of the landscape through which the Shakespearean tourist moves to reach their destination, a reminder that a festival will alter our mood and shift our perspective long before we become official spectators. Finally, two of the book’s chapters employ a comparative methodology: Florence March surveys the Shakespeare-rich region of southern France and unpicks the artistic and philosophical strands that link quite different festivals in Avignon, Nice and Montpellier. Across the Mediterranean, in Italy, Lisanna Calvi and Maddalena Pennacchia invite us to compare and contrast the Festival Shakespeariano in Verona and the summer season of the Silvano Toti Globe in Rome and the dialogues that take place between these events and the cities that host them. Whatever their narrative and analytical approach, all of the authors in this volume are united in their desire to share their\n\n14\n\nSHAKESPEARE ON EUROPEAN FESTIVAL STAGES\n\nsubject with a new audience, to put their festival on the map. While many Shakespeare festivals in the English-speaking world have become tourist shrines in their own right and have been the focus of sustained critical attention and regular reviewing; European Shakespeare festivals are, comparatively, a more recent addition to the global circuit and have been relatively untouched by Shakespeare studies. We hope that this book will help embed them in the cartography of contemporary performance. This book was completed while much of the European continent was under lockdown. Just as in Shakespeare’s time, theatres have been closed for a year and festivals have been either cancelled, postponed or have sought to use digital technologies to reach their spectators. In the current sanitary, economic, social and cultural crisis, European festivals reassert the idea that Shakespeare is a common language and a means symbolically to (re)open the borders. By celebrating Shakespeare on European festival stages, we celebrate a humanist, democratic, inclusive model of theatre-making. In the specific, global context of the Covid-19 crisis in which it is issued, this book not only aims to fill a knowledge gap in the history of European festivals – and that of world Shakespeare festivals – it also reasserts the crucial role of live arts in post-traumatic reconstruction and resilience. These festive qualities of optimism, ingenuity and perseverance were all embodied in the life and work of Professor Jerzy Limon, founder of the Gdańsk Shakespeare Festival, to whose cherished memory we dedicate this book.\n\nReferences Barthes, Roland ([1954] 1993), ‘Pour une définition du théâtre populaire [For a definition of theatre for all]’, in Œuvres complètes, ed.

These words rounded off the statement issued by Montpellier’s international arts festival to announce the cancellation of its 34th edition in June 2020 as a consequence of the Covid-19 pandemic. For the second time in its history, swallows did not herald the actors’ spring, the literal translation for the festival’s name: Le Printemps des comédiens. It was not long before the Avignon summer festival followed in its tracks. 2020 also marked a non-event year for the Shakespeare festival in Nice, Shake-Nice!, which came to an end as its founder Irina Brook left the Riviera after resigning from her position at the head of the National Theatre. This chapter focuses on the three southern France festivals founded in Avignon, Montpellier and Nice, respectively in 1947, 1987 and 2015. In such a context, physical distancing measures induced the Avignon and the Montpellier festivals to imagine new modes of sharing. Le Printemps des comédiens launched a web radio which, for ten weeks throughout the first lockdown period, broadcast play\n\n18\n\nSHAKESPEARE ON EUROPEAN FESTIVAL STAGES\n\nreadings by actors, spectators’ memories of previous festival editions, academic commentaries and a weekly Shakespeare chronicle.1 The symbolic timing of Radio Printemps, which stopped on the eve of the festival’s planned opening date, showed that it was not so much meant to replace the event as to support the community of theatre professionals and spectators hard hit by the crisis, to help them make sense of the festival’s absence rather than try and fill the gap it created. Theatre must keep quiet, Printemps’ director Jean Varela argued, as the time had come for mourning and the pandemic had made so many ‘Antigone families’.2 Not only did the metatheatrical reference to Sophocles’ tragedy stress the festival’s solidarity with families prevented from burying their dead due to sanitary restrictions, it also suggested that this was the moment to reflect on the vital importance of theatre in society. Avignon proposed a four-pronged answer to the crisis. In July, during the customary three-week period of the festival, ‘A Dream of Avignon’ consisted in rebroadcasting filmed productions from previous years both on French television and in the Honour Court of the medieval Popes’ Palace, the cradle and emblematic place of the event, in front of a limited audience of two hundred. At the same time, the OFF festival organized a cycle of play readings. The third answer was postponed to autumn, when seven of the productions that had been cancelled were rescheduled for ‘A Week of Arts in Avignon’, thus reviving the very first edition of the festival launched under this name by Jean Vilar in September 1947. The idea was to foreground the original – in all senses of the term – dimension of a reflective event, meant to combine retrospective and prospective dynamics, and avoid the derogatory notion of a ‘mini-festival’ which might be viewed as a ‘consolation prize’.3 Meant to be an alternative response to the cancellation of the summer festival, the 2020 ‘Week of Arts’ ironically fell under the scope of new sanitary measures to counter the onslaught of the second pandemic wave. They first imposed evening curfew hours, the start time of all shows having to be moved forward by three hours, soon followed by a new nationwide lockdown which curtailed the festival by two days. Yet, as a further step in this resilient process – surviving, adapting, rebounding and strengthening – and in keeping with its festival’s twofold specificity as laboratory and showcase for the performing arts, Avignon held a National Festivals Forum to assert\n\nSHAPING DEMOCRATIC FESTIVALS IN SOUTHERN FRANCE 19\n\nthe importance of festivals in the French cultural landscape, both at artistic and economic levels,4 and to help redesign the political pact with local and state authorities. A dark year for festivals, 2020 has paradoxically highlighted the reparative and transformational potential of democratic festivals in Avignon, Montpellier and, retrospectively, Nice, all three of them envisaged as a public service to the population. The absence of Shake-Nice! acted as a ghostly reminder of its cohesive and healing role in the wake of the 2015 and 2016 devastating terrorist attacks in Paris and Nice, the Riviera city being again the stage of a tragic act of terrorism in October 2020. Le Printemps and Shake-Nice! were both built on the model of the Avignon Festival, which originated in the traumatic aftermath of the Second World War as a contribution to national reconstruction, a response to the urgent imperative to restore France’s dignity and rebuild a sense of community. Cultural producers in Montpellier and Nice availed themselves of the legacy of Avignon’s founder, Vilar, who believed in the power of arts and culture to heal, nurture and transform. It is no coincidence, then, that Shakespeare’s humanist drama and theatre for all people inform the structure and programmes of the three festivals, as well as their political and artistic ethos. This chapter purposes to further explore the nature and function of Shakespeare’s seminal role in the origins of the Avignon and the Montpellier festivals, whose focus, unlike that of Shake-Nice!, is not exclusively Shakespearean; his continued presence in what have become the main two French arts festivals; and the emergence and impact of the first international Shakespeare festival in France, however short-lived it was. (The independent Avignon OFF and Montpellier’s fringe festival, Warm Up, which shows exclusively local companies’ work in progress, are not part of this study.) Shakespeare’s involvement in the foundation, history and ethos of the festivals under survey will be approached along three lines: mapping Shakespeare’s presence in southern France festivals; festivalizing Shakespeare through the case studies of three plays (Richard II, A Midsummer Night’s Dream and The Tempest) and their emblematic fortune on the Avignon, Montpellier and Nice festival stages; ‘Shakespearizing’ southern France festivals by shifting the focus from corpus to festivals as multifaceted events in which Shakespeare qualifies as a necessary but not sufficient condition.\n\n20\n\nSHAKESPEARE ON EUROPEAN FESTIVAL STAGES\n\nMapping Shakespeare’s presence in southern France festivals Shakespeare’s presence in Avignon, Montpellier and Nice derives from the implementation of postwar cultural policies and individual initiatives, all of which aimed to make theatre accessible to all. Vilar thus became one of the leaders of the decentralization policy launched under the Fourth Republic in 1946 to export theatre outside the capital city into the entire country, at a time when culture was considered as a catalyst for national reconstruction and a factor of social cohesion (Wehle 1974: 65). For ‘A Week of Arts in Avignon’ in 1947, he commissioned concerts of early modern music, an exhibition of contemporary paintings and sculptures and the productions of three plays never performed before in France: Richard II by Shakespeare, L’Histoire de Tobie et de Sara by contemporary French author Paul Claudel and La Terrasse de midi, a rewriting of Hamlet by Maurice Clavel, a young French dramatist at the beginning of his career. The programme foregrounded three features that would, from then on, define the identity of the festival: Vilar’s intention to promote cultural heritage as well as contemporary creation; the experimental dimension of a festival envisaged as a laboratory as much as a showcase for the performing arts; the founding presence of Shakespeare as a facilitator to address these goals. The Avignon Festival was thus born under the joint auspices of Richard II and Hamlet, from two Shakespearean productions directed by Vilar himself (March 2018). Incidentally, another production of Richard II had already initiated the Edinburgh International Festival in August 1947, a few weeks before Vilar’s premiered in the Honour Court of the Popes’ Palace. Right from the first edition of the festival, Shakespeare was a catalyst for new texts, whether translations or rewritings. Performed in a heritage site, in a postwar context when the government could not afford to support the decentralization policy by building new venues, Shakespeare became associated with the development of site-specific theatre in Avignon, from which derived new aesthetics. Vilar’s minimalist staging of the prison scene – a few props, a red robe, three shafts of light that carved out Richard’s cell in the darkness, and the lament of a violin (Wehle 1981: 110) – thus established the so-called ‘aesthetic of the three stools’ (Guignebert 1953), which both enhanced the actors’ art and relied on the spectator’s capacity for imagination.\n\nSHAPING DEMOCRATIC FESTIVALS IN SOUTHERN FRANCE 21\n\nFrom then on, Shakespeare has been the most frequently performed author in Avignon. Through the years, the festival has spread over the city, venues have multiplied and the independent OFF festival founded in 1966 by André Benedetto has taken to the streets. The ‘city festival’ has given rise to a ‘festival city’ (Johansson 2020: 54) where Shakespeare’s presence crystallized both as a result and an agency of the decentralization policy: a major actor of the centrifugal movement from Paris, Shakespeare led to a centripetal dynamic in Avignon, which in turn inspired other initiatives along the French Mediterranean coast. Although Le Printemps was launched in Montpellier in 1987, its roots can be traced back to 1958 when André Crocq, a pioneer of popular education and youth instruction in a professional corps established by the government at the end of the Second World War, organized the first drama summer school of a long series in Pézenas, known as Molière’s town, near Montpellier. Ironically hinging on A Midsummer Night’s Dream, a comedy by the British – not the French – champion of democratic theatre, the summer school met with such success that Jean Bène, the President of the Conseil départemental de l’Hérault – the Council of the Hérault district of which Montpellier and Pézenas are part – commissioned Crocq to set up and run the Centre Culturel du Languedoc (Languedoc Cultural Centre). After Crocq’s death in 1980, the Conseil départemental pursued its policy of ‘cultural solidarity’ (Archives: 2102W/100) by founding Le Printemps, whose editions have foregrounded Shakespeare as a common thread and have featured A Midsummer Night’s Dream more often than any other play. Four decades after ‘A Week of Arts in Avignon’, Le Printemps enforced the decentralization policy on a local scale, in the Hérault district. The shows programmed in Montpellier toured in twenty of its surrounding towns and villages, until the costs occasioned were judged to be prohibitive. Yet, over the past few years, at the instigation of its director Jean Varela, the festival has been progressively reviving the tradition in neighbouring towns. Also heir to French postwar cultural policies, Shake-Nice! was launched by Irina Brook, with the support of Peter Brook, in January 2015, shortly after she was appointed the head of the National Theatre in Nice (TNN), one of the thirty-eight state-funded theatres established in the aftermath of the Liberation as part of the decentralization policy and whose mission it is to address wide local audiences. ShakeNice! took place every year for three weeks in January and February, except for its fifth and last edition in 2019 which was moved to April,\n\n22\n\nSHAKESPEARE ON EUROPEAN FESTIVAL STAGES\n\nthe month that marks both the birth and death of Shakespeare, as a symbolic obituary of the festival and a hope for its revival. Brook’s Shakespeare festival allowed her to export the theatre outside the TNN’s institutional building, implementing decentralization at the scale of the city. In 2015, Le Tour complet du cœur (a complete picture of the heart) opened the festival’s first edition; this one-man show, inspired by the (more or less) complete works of Shakespeare, was performed under a marquee tent on the esplanade in front of the playhouse. The title of the production, the nomadism associated with the tent, the position of the esplanade overlooking the city, all symbolically ushered in Brook’s plan to reorganize the theatregoing community by bringing together spectators with heterogeneous backgrounds, so as to provide a mirror image of Nice’s socio-cultural diversity and bridge the gap between the disparate areas of the city (March et al. 2016). All three festivals succeeded in fostering local, national and international dynamics. Shake-Nice! immediately joined the European Shakespeare Festivals Network founded in 2010 to encourage artistic and educational collaborations. Le Printemps has recently developed a strategic partnership with China. In the medieval city of Avignon, Shakespeare played a key role not only in the creation of the festival but, since his theatre connected tangible and intangible heritage through site-specific productions, in defining it as a ‘destination festival’ (Engle et al. 1995: 17) for audiences from France and abroad. From decentralized theatre to international festivals, Shakespeare acted as an incentive to cross boundaries and open borders. How has Shakespeare’s presence thematically and structurally informed each of the festivals under study? What kind of dialogue has his theatre entertained with other dramatic corpora in Avignon and Montpellier?\n\nFestivalizing Shakespeare: three case studies While Shakespeare occupies a prominent place in Montpellier, the other cornerstone of the festival is Molière, the French seventeenthcentury man of the theatre who spent several years in Languedoc\n\nSHAPING DEMOCRATIC FESTIVALS IN SOUTHERN FRANCE 23\n\nand to whom the very first edition of Le Printemps was dedicated. Shakespeare and Molière are the two pillars on which Le Printemps has always rested to promote art theatre for all. No French playwright can claim to rival Shakespeare in Avignon. Racine was never a favourite under Vilar’s leadership of the festival, for his classical tragedies were not deemed to address an all-inclusive audience. Racine thus had to wait until 1975 to make his official entry in the Honour Court of the Papal Palace, four years after Vilar’s death. In 1953, a crisis pitted Vilar against the organizing committee of the festival in charge of the budget, which pressed him for a Racine production in the Honour Court of the Popes’ Palace. Vilar resigned from his function and when called back by the Mayor of Avignon, he retaliated by staging Macbeth in 1954. The opposition of these two emblematic figures of the theatre crystallized the debate on the nature of democratic theatre, as if in a parody of Stendhal’s essay on Racine et Shakespeare (1823) in which the early modern playwright was championed over the French tragedian. Shakespeare’s encounter with Avignon, and particularly the Honour Court, was such a triumph in 1947 that Vilar’s production of Richard II was programmed again in 1948, 1949 and 1953, alongside his adaptation of the two parts of Henry IV in 1950. Pressured to turn the Avignon Festival into a Shakespeare festival, Vilar resisted the temptation for fear of turning Shakespeare into a business, a ‘guaranteed income’, a ‘share capital’ (Vilar 1971: 95–7): I immediately opposed it … and I was right. As a matter of fact, those in favour of a Shakespeare festival understood later on and approved of my decision. We should not give in to the temptation. The whole spirit of Avignon was at stake. We had to evolve right from the beginning. If we had become a Shakespeare festival, Avignon would never have become what it is, even though we had done a good job. This way, we were able to perform his plays without risking sclerosis. (Roy 1987: 66) For Vilar, democratic theatre and Shakespeare’s theatre should meet but not merge in Avignon. He aimed to implement a theatre for all people inspired by the Elizabethan model and to imagine new ways of staging the British poet’s plays in heritage sites. He wanted Avignon to be the place where classical and contemporary\n\n24\n\nSHAKESPEARE ON EUROPEAN FESTIVAL STAGES\n\nrepertoires and stage practices came into contact and rubbed elbows. In this regard, the philosophy behind the non-Shakespeare festivals of Avignon and Montpellier did not clash with Brook’s commitment to Shakespeare in Nice. Whereas the Avignon and the Montpellier festivals are independent cultural events, Shake-Nice! was embedded in the middle of the National Theatre season running from September to June. As a consequence, Shakespeare became prominent in an otherwise diversified programme. The Shakespeare festival thus interacted with a variety of repertoires, artistic forms and events, which were part of the same overall project, even though they were slightly shifted in time. Shakespeare has been programmed in forty-five editions of the Avignon Festival out of seventy-five, including the cancelled ones in 2003 and 2020, and twenty-four of his plays have been performed. The histories and tragedies are favourites, for their epic dimension adapts particularly well to the historic medieval buildings that are turned into places of performance during the festival. The Elizabethan and his contemporaries were present in twenty-three editions of Le Printemps out of thirty-four, including the cancelled ones in 2014 and 2020. Fourteen plays by Shakespeare have been performed in Montpellier, striking a balance between histories, tragedies, comedies and romance plays, and in 2016 the festival hosted After Shakespeare, a thirteen-hour marathon production of the complete – although abridged – plays and the result of an academic interdisciplinary project of University Paul-Valéry initiated by the Institute for Research in the Renaissance, the Classical Age and the Enlightenment (IRCL) to mark the 400th anniversary of Shakespeare’s death. The first edition of Shake-Nice! also provided festival-goers with an overview of Shakespeare’s (more or less) complete works in a four-hour solo performance, Le Tour complet du cœur. Three plays in particular hold special significance for the festivals under study: Richard II for Avignon, A Midsummer Night’s Dream for Le Printemps and The Tempest for Shake-Nice! Historically linked to the origins of the festivals, these founding plays enjoy a specific status due to the way they have continued to inform them over the years. One may wonder how Shakespeare’s historical drama, which is frequently said to present a patriotically English – and sometimes decidedly anti-French – view of history could become a vector of French national reconstruction. As this collection\n\nSHAPING DEMOCRATIC FESTIVALS IN SOUTHERN FRANCE 25\n\nof essays shows, after the Second World War Shakespeare was used, not only in France but across Europe, to explore a diversity of national political contexts. Vilar found in the Elizabethan ‘theatre of a nation’ (Helgerson 1992: 197–8) an essential reference to invent a French civic theatre that would ensure social cohesion through the construction of a collective memory and the critical appropriation of History. His choice of Richard II, which initiates two tetralogies dramatizing more than a century of civil war and closing on the advent of a new dynasty, seemed particularly appropriate to the first edition of the Avignon Festival, which bore the promise of a renewal and encouraged faith in the future. After Richard II, Vilar staged the two parts of Henry IV in Avignon in 1950. And just like Firmin Gémier, who had founded the French Shakespeare Society in 1919 to strengthen the alliance between France and Britain in the aftermath of the First World War, Vilar placed his own project of national reconstruction in a broader context of Anglo-French cooperation. In this respect, the ambivalent role assumed by France in Richard II epitomizes the history of its complex relations with Britain. While the play’s action takes place during the Hundred Years’ War, France is also dramatized as a refuge for exiles, such as Bolingbroke or the French-born Queen herself (March 2018: 60–1). Vilar’s intention to experiment with new forms of theatre in Avignon also accounted for his production of Richard II, never staged in France before and for which he commissioned a new translation by Jean-Louis Curtis. The history play helped him negotiate with the Honour Court of the Popes’ Palace, a UNESCO World Heritage Centre that had never yet been used as a place of performance. The play’s epic dimension appropriately matched the monumentality of the venue. The timeline of the dramatic action coincided with the time when the medieval palace was erected – the fourteenth century. Fraught with rituals and ceremonies, the play also served Vilar’s intention to ritualize the theatre, as it was in Ancient times. Eventually, Vilar’s minimalist aesthetic, which relied on the spectator’s capacity for imagination, left its mark on the festival. The encounter of Richard II with the Honour Court in 1947 thus established the ideological and aesthetic foundations of the Avignon festival meant to promote civic theatre and to be a laboratory as well as a ritualized festive event. Two later productions of the history play staged in the Honour Court, respectively by Ariane Mnouchkine in 1982 and Jean-Baptiste Sastre in 2010, experienced\n\n26\n\nSHAKESPEARE ON EUROPEAN FESTIVAL STAGES\n\ncontrasting fortunes. Mnouchkine radically defamiliarized both play and venue culturally and geographically, submitting them to Asian influences through references to Kabuki, Noh and Bunraku, thus avoiding direct comparison with Vilar’s founding gesture in 1947 while upholding his festival’s experimental vocation. By contrast, Sastre’s Richard II provided an occasion for reviving the memory of Vilar’s mythical production, in effect turning Avignon into a museum or high altar against its founder’s intentions, thus failing to measure up to the festival-goers’ most demanding expectations (March 2010). Over the years, Richard II has become the play against which the Vilarian project for Avignon is regularly assessed (March 2015: 88–90). In the same way as Richard II has become emblematic of the Avignon Festival, the comedy of A Midsummer Night’s Dream seems to contain Le Printemps in a nutshell. Productions and adaptations of the play were programmed in 1995, 1997, 2000, 2003, 2007, 2011 and 2017. Performed every several years in Montpellier’s Domaine d’O, the park hosting the festival, it is tightly interwoven with its history, reflecting on its evolution while simultaneously reasserting its morphological and ideological constants. Not only does the play dramatize the fundamentals of a theatre for all people that has been at the core of a voluntarist socio-cultural policy in the Hérault district since 1958, but the night action in a wood near Athens also mirrors the conditions of performance in the woods of Montpellier. Composed on a special occasion – perhaps for an aristocratic wedding – and involving interactions between the aristocracy, the gentry and a company of craftsmen, A Midsummer Night’s Dream crystallizes the vision of theatre as festive celebration, which restores the link between man and nature, and generates social cohesion. The play within the play reasserts the importance of a pact of performance relying on the curiosity and critical sense of committed spectators in a theatre that, at Le Printemps, is meant to raise questions as much as to cause aesthetic emotion. It is no coincidence that Crocq chose this comedy for his first summer school in Pézenas in 1958. The free performances given by the trainees in a park, Parc Sans Souci, for the town’s inhabitants constituted another example of democratic theatre. The craftmen’s scenes, in which Shakespeare obliquely acknowledged his debt to amateur theatre while keeping it at a distance through parody, ironically reflected on Crocq’s pioneering\n\nSHAPING DEMOCRATIC FESTIVALS IN SOUTHERN FRANCE 27\n\nwork in popular education and then on the Montpellier festival dedicated to actors (The Actors’ Spring), of which they were both a figuration and a disfiguration. Following in the footsteps of Crocq, Le Printemps in partnership with the IRCL at University Paul-Valéry and six schools in Montpellier launched in 2016 an educational programme on ‘Shakespeare and Citizenship’ in which A Midsummer Night’s Dream is given a central place. The craftmen’s plot, which dramatizes the production of a play by amateur actors, from the first rehearsal to the premiere, implements one of the cardinal values attached to the notion of citizenship: solidarity, meaning the capacity for building a common project, without which there can be no society.5 Significantly, the first edition of Shake-Nice! was launched under the auspices of Tempête!, an adaptation of The Tempest by Irina Brook’s company. The name of the show extended the metaphor already contained in the name of the festival since Brook wished to shake Nice through Shakespeare. Even the exclamation mark punctuating it was one more sign of its symbolic relevance to the festival. Brook’s reading of the opening scene was particularly interesting. Whereas in Shakespeare’s text Prospero creates a storm at sea for Miranda and the spectator, Brook displaced it from stage to audience. Prospero pointed binoculars at the auditorium, commenting upon the storm as if it was actually taking place there, so that it was the spectators’ own imagination that conjured up the storm, in keeping with the prologue’s recommendations in Henry V. The audience’s commitment to shake things up in the context of the show could not but symbolically apply to the festival itself, celebrating their appropriation of Brook’s project for Nice. Badges to be worn by festival-goers carried the quotation ‘we are such stuff as dreams are made on’ (Tem 4.1.156–7). Symbols of inclusion, they contributed to the sense of belonging to the festival’s community, as well as highlighting the necessity for commitment inside and outside the playhouse and the need to awaken one’s capacity for dreaming. To some extent, Brook’s Tempête! could be viewed as a mise en abyme of Shake-Nice! (March et al. 2016). Festivalizing Shakespeare in southern France means much more than celebrating a great dramatist who has taken on mythic status. Viewed as a model to promote art theatre for all, Shakespeare is a catalyst for creativity, a factor of social cohesion and a vector of emancipation. His potential for transformational power has\n\n28\n\nSHAKESPEARE ON EUROPEAN FESTIVAL STAGES\n\nshaped the artistic and socio-political projects of the Avignon, the Montpellier and the Nice festivals.\n\n‘Shakespearizing’ southern France festivals Many of the projects of democratic theatre which developed in Europe in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries relied on Shakespeare.6 For Dennis Kennedy, Shakespeare qualifies as a ‘cultural Marshall Plan’ in Western Europe (2009: 81) and as a ‘cold warrior’ in Central and Eastern Europe (2003), the latter point indebted to the thesis developed by Jan Kott in Shakespeare Our Contemporary (1964). Shakespeare’s name is thus to be understood in a broad sense: it designates not only the man or the playwright, but a certain idea of the theatre, a certain relationship to the spectator and beyond, to the city and society. This model informed the festivals under study along two main lines: an audience-inclusive ethos and a collaborative relationship with the audience. Aiming at social cohesion through cultural action, the Avignon, Montpellier and Nice festivals target a widely diversified audience in terms of geographical distribution, social classes and age groups. All three festivals thus implemented the decentralization policy on a different scale. In France the phrase théâtre populaire covers a wide range of definitions and lends itself to polymorphous interpretations. Firmin Gémier’s ‘collective theatre’ addressed the lower classes (Caune 1999: 74); Jacques Copeau’s ritualized theatre, which called for national regeneration, only reached a limited audience; JeanPaul Sartre’s activist theatre targeted the working classes. Vilar, who systematically referred to Shakespeare when theorizing popular theatre, embraced the meaning it had back in the Renaissance as a synonym of ‘universal theatre’ (1953: 1–2) or just ‘theatre’ (1975: 188). His theatre for all people meant to engage with large and socially mixed audiences everywhere in France: The word [popular] may please or displease; be understood this or that way … It means I have the duty to provide for all people, from the storekeeper in Suresnes to the high-ranking magistrate, from the manual labourer in Puteaux to the stockbroker, from\n\nSHAPING DEMOCRATIC FESTIVALS IN SOUTHERN FRANCE 29\n\nthe postman in a rural area to the academic, a great pleasure of which they should never have been deprived. (1975: 178) In comparison, Gémier’s discourse proved much more socially selective: When I put on a Shakespeare play, I say to the Shakespeareans: ‘I do not put on Shakespeare’s plays for you, as you know them so well. Stay at home! Read Shakespeare by the fireplace! Do not come here. I play Shakespeare for taxi drivers, cloakroom attendants and my cook’. (2008: 210–11) Both Le Printemps and Shake-Nice! adopted the Vilarian perspective. The ‘cultural solidarity’ policy enforced in the Hérault district is based on three main principles: developing the theatre as a service to the population in Hérault; bringing art and the theatre to under-served territories; providing all people with a diversified cultural offer (Archives: 2102W/100). Shake-Nice! developed partnerships with the local Emmaus Community and the Malongo coffee factory.7 The Avignon Festival has pursued Vilar’s enterprise by making theatre accessible to the inmates of the local prison (March 2020). All three festivals also emphasize generational diversity. Their policy goes much beyond offering reduced-price tickets to students and the unemployed. Vilar favoured the participation of young spectators in his festival. The Ceméa, a national movement for the development of education methods based on cultural action founded in 1937, was and still is very active in Avignon. Le Printemps des collégiens, a Shakespeare school festival whose name echoes Le Printemps des comédiens in which it is embedded, launched its first edition in 2016. Brook also implemented a parallel school festival in Nice and its conurbations: Shake Free Style. These innovative educational projects aim to give the students an opportunity to discover Shakespeare through an experience of individual and social empowerment, as well as to rejuvenate today’s festival audiences and build tomorrow’s. To get a better chance of achieving social diversity, the Avignon and the Montpellier festivals provide large venues that can accommodate\n\n30\n\nSHAKESPEARE ON EUROPEAN FESTIVAL STAGES\n\nwide audiences: the Honour Court of the Popes’ Palace in Avignon can fit two thousand spectators, whereas the Amphithéâtre d’O and the Théâtre Jean-Claude Carrière in Montpellier have seating capacities of respectively 1,800 and 1,200. Transcending geographical, socio-economic and generational divisions to address all people, the Avignon, the Montpellier and the Nice festivals thus define themselves as inclusive, on the model of Shakespeare’s theatre. For Brook, quoting Vilar: ‘The Art of the theatre takes on full significance when it succeeds in bringing people together’.8 Vilar contended that Shakespeare’s texts are at the crossroads of popular and elite cultural traditions and may therefore be appropriated by all types of audiences through performance and contemporary translations. Following his successful production of Richard II, Vilar wrote that ‘people from the lower classes who go to the theatre always understand Shakespeare, even though it is such or such a history play based on fourteenth-century English history’ (Wehle 1981: 100). Statistics corroborate his statement.9 The tremendous success of Thomas Jolly’s eighteen-hour production of the three parts of Henry VI for the 2014 edition of the Avignon Festival in particular, twenty years after Stuart Seide’s triumphant marathon production of the same trilogy in Montpellier and Avignon, provide further evidence that Vilar was right. To enable spectators to access demanding repertoires, democratic festivals challenge their curiosity. Vilar’s administrator, Paul Puaux, claimed: ‘Avignon should be like a construction site where everyone can see theatre in the making’ (1983: 68). Such festivals also create opportunities for the sharing of experience and debate with the artists. For Vilar, ‘Avignon is the quest for a place for reflection, for debate and … hope’ (Puaux 1983: 67). Shakespeare is thus envisaged not as a final objective but as a facilitator to access, beyond his plays, the complex art of the theatre. Through Shakespeare, festivals of art theatre for all enforce a specific pact of performance with festivalgoers, which involves a reevaluation of space and time, as well as the nature of their commitment. In Avignon, Vilar reinvented the relationship between stage and audience, to encourage a pact of performance inspired by Ancient Greek and Elizabethan theatres – that is, based on direct address to large audiences in open-air venues – so as to magnify the sense of togetherness in a society sorely afflicted by the war. Vilar’s project questioned the architectural and aesthetic codes of the Italian\n\nSHAPING DEMOCRATIC FESTIVALS IN SOUTHERN FRANCE 31\n\nplayhouse which divide instead of bringing together. Firmin Gémier, the founder of the Shakespeare Society in France in 1916 and of the Théâtre National Populaire in 1920, had already argued that after the First World War had gathered all social classes in the trenches, performing in Italian playhouses, in which the vertical distribution of the audience mirrors and reinforces the social hierarchy, was no longer relevant (2008: 67). In the same way, the imaginary fourth wall dividing stage from audience had to be broken. For obvious economic reasons in postwar years, Vilar had to turn to a place that was not initially designed as a theatre, although it was highly theatrical – but in the bad sense of the term, as he immediately became aware of. Too pregnant with history, the medieval Honour Court posed a challenge to performance, opposing monument to movement and permanence to transience. The playwright who helped him negotiate with the bare stone was Shakespeare, ‘the best friend of the Popes’ Palace’ (Faivre d’Arcier 2007: 21–2) and ‘the factotum of the Honour Court’ (Thibaudat 1985). The open-air courtyard surrounded by walls is reminiscent of the inclusive shape of the Shakespearean ‘wooden O’ – a resemblance that was deliberately emphasized from 1982 to 2002 with the audience surrounding the stage on three sides and two galleries being erected and furnished with wooden benches. The ‘wooden O’ is also echoed in Montpellier’s Domaine d’O and its synecdochally named venues Théâtre d’O and Amphithéâtre d’O, as well as in the circular seventeenth-century Grand Bassin and the circus rings and tents scattered across the park which recall both the arenas of the Elizabethan playhouses and the popular tradition behind the festival. Festivals also involve a reevaluation of time: time grafted upon time when the Avignon Festival contaminates the city, turning it into a huge theatre for three weeks; ‘time out of time’ (Falassi 1987) when the Printemps, confined to the ovoid-shaped Domaine d’O, forms a sort of bubble within the city. The festival-goer’s experience extends before and after the shows, through conference talks, debates and exhibitions that accompany them in their discovery of demanding texts in performance. The specific morphology of festivals thus entails a reevaluation of the spectator’s role through their physical, intellectual and emotional commitment. In Avignon and Montpellier, most performances take place in the open, unsheltered from bad weather, so that the spectators’ commitment is physical, making them stand in complete solidarity\n\n32\n\nSHAKESPEARE ON EUROPEAN FESTIVAL STAGES\n\nwith the artists, just as in Shakespeare’s time. The following humorous comment on a night performance of an adaptation of Richard III by Dan Jemmett for the Printemps, in the 2012 golden book of the companies,10 epitomizes a not-uncommon situation in either festival: ‘Thank you for your reception, your kind + helpful technicians and above all for the thunder, lightning and rain – special effects that were well beyond our budget.’ In his famous prologue to Henry V, Shakespeare gives the terms of a pact of performance based on the spectator’s imagination and his capacity to decode and reencode the sign system produced on stage. Drawing on the model of the committed spectator of Elizabethan public playhouses who actively cooperated in the show, Vilar and his heirs in Avignon, Montpellier and Nice rely on a ‘participating spectator’ (Vilar 1991: 93) whose powerful imagination goes together with his capacity for critical analysis. The O that designates the different places of performance in Montpellier metaphorically signals an empty space, a hole that needs to be filled in by the festival-goer. In a similar way, Roland Barthes wrote about the Honour Court of the Popes’ Palace in Avignon: ‘The place required that the spectator be treated not as an immature child whose food you should pre-chew, but as an adult who is given the show to make’ (1993: 395). The successive directors of all three festivals believed that the driving force behind the spectators’ commitment was their curiosity, their capacity for wonder, their faculty to question themselves, push the boundaries of what they knew so as to explore new territories, confront their opinions with those of the festival-goers around them – in short, run the risk of being unsettled, destabilized, decentred. The Avignon, the Montpellier and the Nice festivals constantly evidence Barthes’ statement that ‘popular theatre trusts in man’ (1993: 431). Shakespeare’s ethical presence guarantees the humanist tradition at the root of these festivals. The ritual programming of Shakespearean productions in southern France festivals goes much beyond a homage paid to a monument of classic literature. A tutelar figure, a source of inspiration and a measure of their evolution, Shakespeare informs them structurally, aesthetically and ethically. Anything but museums, the Avignon, the Montpellier and the Nice festivals aim, or aimed, on different scales, to be open laboratories that show theatre in the making and generate new modes of spectating, while simultaneously celebrating the festive, joyful nature of theatre as a medium. In keeping with the Elizabethan tradition of a theatre for all people he encapsulates,\n\nSHAPING DEMOCRATIC FESTIVALS IN SOUTHERN FRANCE 33\n\nthey view Shakespeare as an inclusive author, who fosters dialogue with other dramatic corpora, a ‘founder of discursivity’ for ‘[he] ha[s] created a possibility for something else than [his] discourse, yet something belonging to what [he] founded’ (Foucault 1991: 114). Vilar’s attempt to implement a theatre for all has often been called a utopia (Puaux 1983; Loyer 1997). Yet his ‘theatre for all … whose artistic concerns must first be civic and social, while aiming at quality’ (qtd in Loyer 1997: 98) rather seems to qualify as a heterotopia, that is, an ‘enacted utopia’, taking place here and now in ‘the mode of the festival’, a ‘counter-site’ opening up critical, discursive perspectives (Foucault ([1984] 1986: 24, 26). If, for Foucault, theatre is heterotopic by nature, the Avignon, Montpellier and Nice democratic festivals provide specific ‘locations in which cultural and political meanings can be produced spatially’ (Tompkins 2014: 1). Originating in national and local cultural policies, they define themselves as laboratories for aesthetic and sociopolitical alternatives. Endowed with transformative potential, they implement a political theatre that resonates with the actual world and establishes a relationship with audiences that may continue when they leave a venue. Thus engaged politically and aesthetically, southern France festivals are consistent with Tompkins’ definition of heterotopic theatre that ‘offers a model for (re)fashioning the present and the future’ (2014: 6–7).\n\nNotes 1 Web radio PCM, https://soundcloud.com/printemps-des-comediens (accessed 2 December 2020). 2 Radio news, France Inter, 8 April 2020, 7.30 am: https://www. franceinter.fr/emissions/le-journal-de-7h30?p=4 (accessed 2 December 2020).

In 2015, the TNN team went to meet the members of the community to speak about Tempête! (Tempest!), the latest production of Irina Brook’s company. In 2016, the Emmaus Community came to the TNN to attend two shows in the festival: Shake, adapted from Twelfth Night by Dan Jemmett, and Cupidon est malade (Cupid is sick), a rewriting of A Midsummer Night’s Dream directed by Jean Bellorini. In the same way, the TNN also regularly decentralized theatre performances at the Malongo coffee factory where, for instance, they performed Tempête! in 2017. 8 TNN programme for the 2014/5 season, p. 1. 9 Richard II, Macbeth and A Midsummer Night’s Dream were performed 186 times between 1947 and 1959 and attracted 363,946 spectators. 10 The non-inventoried archives of Le Printemps des comédiens include companies’ and spectators’ golden books, in which artists and audiences are invited to leave a record of their experience of the festival. The uniqueness and value of this device, which participates in building the memory of Le Printemps, cannot be better illustrated than by the following anecdote: in 2020, a theatre enthusiast living in Lyon found in a secondhand bookshop the companies’ 2000–1 golden book, which had been stolen years before; she bought it and returned it to the festival where it belonged.
