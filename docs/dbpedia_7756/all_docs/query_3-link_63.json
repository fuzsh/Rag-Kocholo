        "text": "Field visit to Colombia\n\nIn April 2023, Helena travelled to Colombia with UNHCR, where she met with indigenous Wounaan people in Chocó and Venezuelan refugees in Quibdo. Helena was reunited with Maribeth Palacios Lopez, a refugee and single mother whom she had first met eight years prior. The reunion was incredibly emotional; Helena listened to Maribeth recount her suffering as the impacts of COVID-19 and climate change hit her community hard.\n\nHelena also met with trans activist María Victoria, who risks her life daily in Colombia to teach local communities about the lives of transgender people and how they are affected by displacement. The pair formed an instant connection.\n\nOn her return home, Helena appealed to the public: \"I hope you join me in showing solidarity for Maribeth, and all the forcibly displaced people worldwide who are looking for safety and hope away from home.\""
