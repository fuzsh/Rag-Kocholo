(The actual number of alternate names is nearer 9,000, since many places have or had more than one such name.) For the purposes of this record, an alternate name is one that bears or bore an ofﬁcial or at least a semiofﬁcial status, rather than being simply a nickname or a colloquial abbreviation. An alternate name may be a respelling, as when a name is restored to a correct form from a corrupt original, or it may even be in a completely different language, as when one country is occupied or conquered by another, a fate that historically befell many European states. Not all name changes are the result of hostilities. Sometimes settlers in virgin territory ﬁnd it hard to decide on a suitable name for their place of settlement. There are thus places in the United States that have undergone more than one change of name, such as Glen Ellyn, Illinois, which ﬁnally arrived at its present name after a run of six successive earlier names. The choice of a new name for a place may be politically motivated, as the hundreds of towns and villages renamed in the former Soviet Union. Here two birds were often killed with one stone, since an undesirable or politically incorrect name could be abolished and replaced with a new politically correct one, which often as not bore no relationship to the earlier name. In some cases, a new name was\n\nnot even associated with the place in question. Many Soviet places were simply given a generally Communist name, typically with the element Krasno-, “red,” to reﬂect the new regime, while others were renamed for Lenin or Stalin without any local connection with these leaders. Some such renamings remain on the map today, almost 20 years after the demise of the Soviet state. Ideological renaming of this kind was not conﬁned to the USSR, and some towns elsewhere in the Socialist bloc took on new names, such as Hungary’s Dunaújváros, which for a decade was Sztálinváros, or the former East Germany’s Chemnitz, which for almost forty years was on the map as Karl-Marx-Stadt. There were few such renamings in Poland, a country recast with German placenames during World War II, but from 1946 to 1992 the city of Podgorica in the former Yugoslavia honored the republic’s ﬁrst president as Titograd. In countries of central and eastern Europe such as these, a new name was often based on a previous name, which was either adapted to the succeeding new language or where possible translated into it. Thus the Slovakian town of Nové Mesto nad Váhom, with a name meaning “new town on the Váh,” for the river on which it lies, was earlier known by the Hungarian name Vágújhely and German name Waag-Neustadt, with “new town” translated into the superseding language and the form of the river name accommodated to it. Many places around the world have roots that go deep into history, with an original\n\n1\n\nIntroduction name in a now extinct language. Names of biblical origin are often of this type, as are the numerous places in the Roman Empire with Latin names. Such names, marked “Roman” in the present book rather than “Latin,” in turn are often of earlier origin, dating back several centuries BC to a defunct language such as ancient Greek or Phoenician. The Roman names of places in France are thus often GalloRoman, and based on Gaulish, a Celtic language. In countries with a colonial heritage there can be a complete change of language, with a native name replaced by a European one, itself in more recent times either reverting to its indigenous original or assuming a new native form. Not many European names remain today on the map of Africa, although English names are still a signiﬁcant presence in countries such as Australia and New Zealand, despite the prevalence of native names, here respectively Aboriginal and Maori. An analogous situation exists in the United States and Canada, where names of European origin in languages such as English, French, and Spanish remain widespread on the map amongst the numerous Indian names. In South America, and especially Latin America, Spanish and Portuguese names are visibly in evidence today as replacements for historical Indian names. It goes without saying, of course, that not all European placenames in countries with a colonial past are substitutions for native names, as a good number of such names are those of newly-founded settlements. In many countries today more than one language is spoken, so that places ofﬁcially bear two names. Thus, places in Belgium often bear both French and Flemish names, while places in Ireland are known by an English name and an Irish and places in Wales by an English name and a Welsh. In Belgium, the ofﬁcial form of the name is usually French in the south and Flemish in the north and east, while in Ireland the Irish and English names\n\n2 exist in tandem, but with English usually being the ofﬁcial form. (Irish equivalents for names in Northern Ireland exist but are generally not ofﬁcial. They are included in the dictionary, however. In this respect, care is needed in differentiating between “northern Ireland,” in the Irish Republic, and “Northern Ireland,” as part of the United Kingdom.) In Wales, English still mostly predominates, but the Welsh names are invariably used in Welshlanguage texts, as in the media and ofﬁcial legislation. Most places in Scotland have equivalent Gaelic names (listed in Edward Dwelly’s Illustrated Gaelic-English Dictionary) but in regular use retain the English forms of their names. An exception is the Gaelic-speaking Western Isles, where the town of Stornoway now ofﬁcially appears on maps in its Gaelic guise of Steornabagh, as do most villages and natural features, including the islands themselves. (Many of these names are not actually Gaelic in origin but Scandinavian, so that the Gaelic form is simply a respelling. Stornoway itself is one such.) In the Basque Country of northern Spain and southwestern France, places are now often known by their Basque names in addition to, or instead of, their respective Spanish or French names. A similar situation applies in Brittany, northwestern France, where Breton names are often bracketed with their French equivalents, while in Catalonia, northeastern Spain, Catalan names are now regularly given pride of place on the map, in acknowledgment of the region’s status as an autonomous community. In Switzerland some places have as many as four different forms of name in each of the country’s ofﬁcial languages, French, German, Italian, and Romansh, this last being the local language. For the purposes of this dictionary, alternate current names are often not simply variant spellings but distinctively different. Thus, the name of La Guajira, a department of northeastern Colombia, is also spelled La Goajira and La Goagira, but these are basically one\n\n3 and the same name, not signiﬁcant alternates. The same goes for names that are essentially a shorter version of an original much longer name. In such cases the present name is exactly the same as the main part of the historical name, so is not a true alternate. Many colonial Spanish and Portuguese names in the Americas began life as an impressive religious dedication, incorporating a saint’s name, but today only the basic name or word remains. Such are Argentina’s San Pedro de Jujuy, now usually San Pedro, Uruguay’s Santo Domingo de Soriano, now Soriano, and Brazil’s São Miguel de Jucurutu, now normally Jucurutu. Names of this type are generally absent from the dictionary. But where an earlier lengthy name has now been superseded by a different shorter one, they duly feature. Brazil’s Santo Antônio de Leverger has a name previously shortened to Leverger and before that Santo Antônio, but it originated as Santo Antônio do Rio Abaixo. Its name has thus changed and is therefore included. Where a well-known name in one of these two languages has an interesting origin, however, it is generally included. A famous example is California’s Los Angeles, which began life as El Pueblo de la Reyna de Los Angeles on a river that the Spanish christened Porciúncula in honor of Nuestra Señora la Reyna de los Angeles de Porciúncula, “Our Lady the Queen of Angels of the Little Portion.” Today the city’s name has reduced even further to a colloquial LA. A broad range of places have abandoned a colonial name in favor of an indigenous one, from towns and cities in Africa, such as Harare, formerly Salisbury, and Lubumbashi, formerly Élisabethville, to South Paciﬁc islands such as Fatu Hiva, formerly Magdalena Island, and Nanumanga, formerly Hudson Island. In such cases, however ofﬁcial and publicly promoted the name change, the old name often continues in general use alongside the new. If the inhabitants of a place, or those familiar with it, have long known it by a particular name which is then replaced by another, a sit-\n\nIntroduction uation is created in which alternate names become current, sometimes for years, and certainly long enough to feature on maps and in gazetteers, even if the old name is regarded as secondary and is printed in parenthesis. Some atlases retain the old name for the physical or geographic map of a region, giving the new name in the political map. Thus, Philip’s Great World Atlas (see Select Bibliography, p. 255) shows the location of the New Hebrides in its physical map of Australia and Oceania, but names the island republic Vanuatu in the corresponding political map. The traditional English spelling of wellknown names also persists in general use, even in the media and works of reference. Thus, The Times Style and Usage Guide, published in 2003, recommends such spellings as Dunkirk, Gothenburg, and Lyons, as well as the conventionally accepted Brussels, Cologne, and Venice, while the 11th edition of The Chambers Dictionary, published as recently as 2008, described the World War I Western Front as a belt of land running from the Belgian coast “through Rheims to Verdun.” Not surprisingly, the anomalous situation forms a recurring topic of discussion in the press. Entries in the dictionary give the current name, location, and description of the place followed by its one or more present or past alternate names, preceded by qualifying words such as “formerly,” “conventional,” “originally,” and in the case of former names by a date, where known, of the relevant name change. Names beginning with a numeral are located alphabetically as if the numeral were spelled out in the language concerned. Thus, 26 Bakinskikh Kommunarov, imeni is located between Duzkend and Dvigatel’stroy since the numeral represents Russian dvadtsat’ shest’, “twenty-six.” The same applied to names containing a numeral other than as the ﬁrst word. Thus, Pio IX is located between Pionersky and Piotrków Trybunalski, since the (Roman) numeral represents Portuguese nono, “ninth.” The geographical location of a place is\n\nIntroduction usually given as a “compass” indication in the country concerned, as “eastern France,” “northwestern Turkey,” “southern Russia.” In extensive English-speaking countries such as the United States, Canada, and Australia, the place is additionally located by state, province, or other administrative region. It should be noted that the “compass” indication is that of the place in the country, rather than that of the administrative region, although the two may coincide. For example, Cambridge Bay is in northern Canada in the territory of Nunavut, while Cape Dorset, also in Nunavut, is in northeastern Canada. The disparity occurs because Nunavut itself is a large region. Where the named region is smaller, as one of the northeastern states of the USA, the geographical location will tally with that of the place within the country as a whole. Thus Lackawanna, in the northeastern state of New York, is in the northeast of the United States, but San Diego, in the western state of California, the third-largest state in the country, is more precisely in the southwest of the United States rather than simply in the west of the country. In cases where places of identical name are located in the same geographical section of a country and are not otherwise distinguished by administrative region, a more exact pin-pointing is given by means of “near” and the name of a local town or city. This typically occurs in Russia, where for example there are two places Donskoye in the western part of the country, one near Kaliningrad, the other near Lipetsk. (Administrative regions are not given in non–English-speaking countries, even in extensive lands such as Russia, as these may be of little signiﬁcance to the general Englishspeaking reader, who in this particular case would need to “place” the oblasti of Kaliningrad and Lipetsk, named for their respective capitals.) It should be observed that former names in eastern Russia identiﬁed as Japanese are almost exclusively in the southern half of the Kamchatka peninsula and the\n\n4 southern Kuril Islands, territory which passed to Japan following the Russo-Japanese War of 1904–05. Where the name includes a generic term such as “Islands” or “Mt.” this is not repeated in the description, so that for example Bonin Islands and McKinley, Mt. simply have their respective locations (“western Paciﬁc,” “Alaska, northwestern United States”). The designations “village,” “town,” and “city” do not denote ofﬁcial status but deﬁne a place in terms of approximate size of population, so that “village” denotes a small community with under 3,000 residents, “town” a larger settlement with up to 20,000 inhabitants, and “city” a center with a population greater than this. Similarly, status titles such as “capital” or “center of government” are not used, although countries that are republics are designated as such. In the main part of the entry, a date preceded by the word “to” indicates either that an original name was current up to or through that date or else that the name was in use over an unspeciﬁed period some time before the stated year. It should be noticed that the dates run in reverse chronological order, with the most recent former name given ﬁrst and the earliest last. Thus Dearborn, Michigan, was formerly known as Dearbornville; then before that Pekin; then before that Bucklin; and ultimately, as its original name, Ten Eyck. Where a name was current over two separate historical periods, however, the dates run chronologically. Thus, Beijing (formerly Peking) was known as Peiping from 1368 to 1403 and again from 1928 to 1949, and these two periods are given in normal sequence. In a few cases, where a name switches more than once from one language to another, the recurring name is repeated for sake of clarity. Thus, the city of Cahul in Moldova, known when in the Soviet Union by the Russian name Kagul, bore its present Romanian name from 1919 to 1940, its Russian name before that from 1878 to 1918, its Romanian name before that from 1856 to 1878,\n\n5 and its Russian name before that from 1812 to 1856. The entry thus reads: 1919–1940 Romanian Cahul, 1878–1918 Russian Kagul, 1868–1878 Romanian Cahul, 1812–1856 Russian Kagul. The dates themselves are frequently a signiﬁcant pointer to historical events, especially in Europe. Thus, 1809 was the year when Sweden ceded Finland to Russia, resulting in wholesale renaming, while the recurring date 1878 marks the Congress of Berlin at the end of the Russo-Turkish War, following an era during which the declining Ottoman Empire fought a series of wars with Poland, Austria, and Russia. That year saw the establishment of Bulgaria as an autonomous principality and the beginning of that country’s abandonment of the Turkish placenames that had hitherto existed. The wholesale bulgarization of such names, however, did not take place until 1934, following the installation of Kimon Georgiev as prime minister and the “national restoration” policy of his dictatorial regime. Dates relating to World War I (1914–18) and World War II (1939–45) usually involve the invasion and occupation of one country by another or, conversely, a peace treaty ending hostilities and establishing a new territorial order. Poland, for example, was occupied by Germany in both world wars and invaded by Soviet armies during the latter. The language names “German,” “Polish,” and “Russian,” among others, appear regularly over this period. As stated, not all new names were created as a result of war or oppressive hegemony, and in several instances a renaming marked the achievement of autonomy. Greenland, still today an integral part of the Danish realm, changed most of its names from Danish to Greenlandic when the island was granted home rule in 1979, and many of the towns and cities in northeastern South Africa abandoned their Afrikaans or English names in favor of African ones from the 1990s. In northern\n\nIntroduction Canada, English names were largely replaced by Inuit (Eskimo) ones following the creation of the territory of Nunavut in 1999 from the eastern region of the Northwest Territories. In eastern Europe and central Asia new names appeared in most of the former Soviet republics as they celebrated independence in or soon after 1991, the year that brought the collapse of the Soviet Union as a whole. Placenames in the USSR usually became known to the world in their Russian forms, even where the local language was not even Slavonic. In such cases, the Russian forms are given in round brackets (parentheses). Names in a local language differing from the accepted English form of the name are by contrast given in square brackets. Thus the country called by the English Latvia is known to the Latvians as Latvija (in square brackets), was known to the Russians when in the Soviet Union as Latviya (in round brackets), and when under German rule was named Lettland (unbracketed). Former Russian names are mostly given for places in countries speaking a language closely allied to Russian, as particularly Ukraine and Belarus. In these countries there may thus be little difference between the names in the respective languages, and they will require careful distinction. As a matter of linguistic precision, it should be noted that an apostrophe in a Russian name represents a soft sign, a character (denoting palatalization of the preceding consonant) often omitted in transcription. But in Ukrainian and Belorussian the apostrophe is an integral part of the orthography, and should properly never be omitted. In the present book, the apostrophe thus appears in names in all three languages. A special situation applies to alternate placenames in China, where names have two forms. The traditional way of romanizing Chinese names is the so-called Wade-Giles system, devised in the mid–19th century by two British scholars, Thomas Wade and Herbert Giles. Distinguished by its use of hyphens and\n\nIntroduction apostrophes, the latter denoting aspiration in consonants, it produced such names as Heilung-chiang, Liao-ning, Nan-ch’ang, and Ch’inghai. This contrasts with the prevalent Pinyin (literally, “spell sound”) system, adopted from 1956 and now ofﬁcially prescribed for Englishspeaking countries. Examples of Pinyin names with their Wade-Giles equivalents are Changzhi (Ch’ang-chih), Guiyang (Kuei-yang), Nantong (Nan-t’ung), and Xiantan (Hsiang-t’an). The name for China itself is Zhongguo or Zhonghua in Pinyin, Chung-kuo or Chung-hua in Wade-Giles. The present book uses Pinyin, but for its particular purpose does not treat the two forms of names as alternates. Such pairs could alone make up a gazetteer of their own. This does not mean that Chinese names are altogether excluded, since some have traditional English forms (as Nanking for Nanjung) and others, as elsewhere, have historical forms (as Nanning, formerly Yongning). Several entries have appended comments. The purpose of such additions is either to provide information regarding the circumstances of a name change or to explain the origin or meaning of a name where this is relevant to such a change. Sometimes an important event such as a battle or treaty has resulted in the historical survival of an earlier name, and in such cases the key facts are provided. The battle of Eylau in the Napoleonic Wars was thus waged near the Russian village now known as Bagrationovsk, and that of Königgrätz, in the Austro-Prussian War, around the Czech town now named Hradec Králové. A key feature of the dictionary is the cross-references. These necessarily outnumber the main entries, since as stated some\n\n6 places have more than one present or past alternate name. Names mentioned in an entry’s appended comment are also cross-referenced. Since language plays a signiﬁcant role in alternate names, Appendix I, p. 235, lists a selection of names of well-known places in languages other than English, if only because modern atlases, maps, and gazetteers give preference to the local name of a place, rather than its traditional English form. As explained in the preamble to this Appendix, the languages chosen for this purpose belong to different linguistic families. Appendix II, p. 246, is devoted to a special category of alternate names, as a selection of ﬁctional names of places, meaning not ﬁctional places, but real places known in literature by ﬁctional names. The names of the authors in whose work or works these names appear are also given. In a few noteworthy cases, a place has ofﬁcially adopted its ﬁctional name, either by a name change or by adding the literary name to its real name. Thus Oliver Goldsmith’s “Sweet Auburn! loveliest village of the plain” gave not only the name of the village in Ireland but also the names of several Auburns in the United States. In France, the town of Illiers added Combray, Marcel Proust’s name for it, to become Illiers-Combray. The Select Bibliography that closes the dictionary (p. 255) lists works directly related to alternate placenames, from discursive studies to modern and historical gazetteers and atlases.
