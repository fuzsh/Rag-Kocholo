        "text": "The scattered settlement landscape is a specific type of cultural landscape with a relatively low degree of transformation of the original natural landscape. Herein, we present reflections on the concept of cultural landscape in general and the specifics of a scattered settlement cultural landscape. Further, we use the example of the natural background and the cultural and political context of the Hrušov village to analyse the development of a cultural landscape with a large system of scattered settlements. Unlike most other scattered settlements inhabited by immigrants, the Hrušov scattered settlement was colonised by original local people. Analysis at this locality shows that they occur more frequently on less dissected plains despite their greater distance from the centre. The morphology of the terrain also determines the shape and character of the road network in these settlements, and their presence for long distances along roads influences the number and character of morpholog...\n\nV září 2014 byl v katastru Nimyčnyj poblíž obce Bohdan Rakhivského regionu Zakarpatské oblasti Ukrajiny náhodně objeven místním pastýřem J. Retyaznykom meč z konce 13.–14. století. Tento typ zbraně je velmi vzácný jak pro region Horního Potisí, tak i pro středovýchodní Evropu jako celek. K určení nálezu byly použity typologická schémata E. Oakeshotta, M. Aleksića, A. Geibiga, Z.-K. Pintera a M. Šercerové. Výsledky analýzy konstrukce meče poskytly doplňující informace pro posouzení vývoje sečných zbraní ve středověku. A sword dated to the second half of the 13th century – the beginning of the 14th century was accidentally found by local shepherd Yuriy Retyaznyk in September 2014 in the Nimychnyy cadastral zone, close to the village of Bohdan in the Rakhiv district of Zakarpats&#39;ka oblast, Ukraine. This type of weapon is quite rare both in the Upper Tisza region and Central-Eastern Europe. Typological schemes of E. Oakeshott, M. Aleksić, A. Geibig, Z.-K. Pinter and M. Šercerova wer...\n\nA re-catholization of Ung county was inextricably linked to Jesuit mission in a particular region. The arrival of Jesuit to the Ung county was connected to an effort of the Drugeths to re-catholicize as well as to the history of education in that region. Our attention was focused on relations with Jesuit arrival to Uzhgorod and onto their mission in that region as well as other localities where they operated. Since the history of the Drugeths´ residency is primarily connected to a residency in Humenne, based on this we mapped the relation between Humenné residency and Ung county. In the conclusion we add information about the erigation of Uzhgorod´s college. We finish the whole study with the transcript of the document about the erigation of the college in Uzhgorod, which is a clear proof that the college was not transferred from Humenne but it was a newly opened school. Key words: Ung county, Jesuits, Recatholization, the Drugeths, Uzhgorod."
