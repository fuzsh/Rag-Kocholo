This document discusses the destruction of libraries and archives throughout the 20th century. It notes that war, particularly World Wars I and II, caused considerable losses as numerous libraries and archives were destroyed or damaged in bombings and fires. Natural disasters also contributed to losses, as treasures are destroyed each year by fires, floods, and weather events. The document attempts to compile a list of major disasters that have destroyed or damaged libraries and archives during the century. Its aim is to raise awareness of the loss of invaluable documentary heritage and the urgent need to safeguard collections around the world.",
