        "text": "According to the charter issued by Andrew, Bishop of Eger, the Košice burghers were exempted from jurisdiction of Archdeacon of Abaujvár in 1290. Circumstances connected to its origin and then comparison with other charters containing similar privilege seem to be essential factors leading to better understanding of the source. Hereby a very detailed analysis of the text might say more to explain its meaning. Therefore, the cognoscible context of exemptions with the examination of circumstances leading to the issuance of the charter in 1290, along with consideration of the words written in the text, encourage the opinion that the burghers of Košice had been exempted from jurisdiction of Abaujvár ś Archdeacon even before. The Bishop ś charter seems to be only a confirmation of the right allowed earlier, which was a common phenomenon in the towns (or in the communities of guests) of the Hungarian Kingdom.\n\nThe study presents the possibilities and framework for cooperation between towns in Hungary through the operation of the Town League of Upper Hungary. The cooperation of towns in the Kingdom of Hungary happened primarily through regional relations. At first, the basis for cooperation was provided by common economic interests, but this area broadened considerably in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. After the battle of Mohács (1526), the towns of Hungary became full members of the Hungarian Estates. The Kingdom of Hungary, which was part of the Habsburg Monarchy, gained considerable autonomy in internal politics. This was based on a compromise with the Habsburg rulers to ensure protection against the Ottoman Empire. The free royal towns were the least influential members of this country that had strong Estates. Nevertheless, cooperation between the towns became nationwide. The diets provided the forum for all free royal towns in the country to represent their common interests in a coordinated way. There are traces of this nationwide cooperation as early as the mid-sixteenth century, but it was from the early seventeenth century that it was the strongest. The reason was that in those decades state taxes were becoming heavier and more burdensome for towns. This nationwide cooperation was not only manifested in the field of taxation, but from the first quarter of the seventeenth century onwards, it increasingly extended to religious matters. In the background, there was the increasing recatholization of the Habsburg Monarchy. In this special matter, close links were forged also with the otherwise strongly anti-urban lower nobility. Cooperation between towns worked well, despite the fact that the dominance of Košice (Kassa, Kaschau) clearly influenced the issues that the League members jointly raised. Indeed, the presence of the army, military burdens and denominational issues were most prominent in Košice, the center of the region. The guild association, which determined the internal trade and industrial policy of cities, contributed most to the dominance of Košice craftsmen and merchants in the regional economy. There were significant economic conflicts between Košice and other towns, such as Levoča (Lőcse), Bardejov (Bártfa), Prešov (Eperjes), Sabinov (Kisszeben, Zeben), and Kežmarok (Késmárk). However, the union of towns was also beneficial for the smaller towns, as on their own they would have been unable to represent their interests so effectively.\n\nT he region we survey geographically belongs to the great hungarian plain, more precisely to its eastern section. it is bordered to the north by the Mureş river, on the eastern side by the Carpathians, to the west by the Tisza river and to the south by the Bârzava river. historically, in the Modern era it was called the Banat of Timiş (Temescher Banat, in german). in the late Middle ages, the time-frame we investigate, this part of the Kingdom of hungary was characterized by a low urban network, with only a few towns, being predominantly composed of market towns and villages 1. historian erik Fügedi has already underlined the positive role of the presence of an estate administration center for the development of a settlement 2. andrás Kubinyi, on the other hand, admitted also the opposite: the authority of a landlord would have had a restrictive influence over the self-administration of the market towns he owned 3. The jurisdictional role the landlord fulfilled in the litigations of the inhabitants and his intervention, as a patron, into matters of the church administration, for example (appointment of priests, benefit of the tithe), could be such negative aspects. according to the survey of Kubinyi, 90% of 15 th century noble residences were to be found near urban settlements, or at least the use of the term oppidum designating the residence settlements becomes more frequent during the 15 th century. The role of residential and administrative center of both royal and noble seat settlements is nevertheless taken into consideration in Kubinyi's centrality analyses. lately, szabolcs gulyás, in his study on the relation of noble residences and thus of administrative centers and market towns from the northeastern part of medieval hungary stressed the fact that a pattern does not exist in what the interaction between settlement development and residence founding is concerned 4. The development of market towns in the region of the hungarian plain presents certain particularities derived from the geographical, and thus also from the economic character of the region. it is mostly a rural landscape, focused in consequence on agricultural production. The smaller area within the plain of the Timiş river, due to its zsuzsanna KoPEczny"
