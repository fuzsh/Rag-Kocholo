        "text": "Praise for KATHERINE VAZ\n\n\"It is precisely Katherine Vaz's capacity to fill apparently normal surroundings with monsters,\n\nprophets and moonlight; it is her unabashed mysteriousness and mysticism which make\n\nFado & Other Stories exciting as the best of literature and as exhilerating as a journey\n\ninto an unguessed-at and astonishing country.\" ~ Thomas Keneally\n\n\"An intermittently explosive, persistent lyricism buoys up these stories of family, sex, flowers,\n\nmoney, history, loss and identity that take place in the Portuguese communities of the mainland\n\nUnited States, Hawaii, Azores, and Madeira.\"\n\n~ April Bernard, screening judge for the Drue Heinz Literature Prize, 1997\n\n\"Saudade is a rich celebration of language, of the senses, of the emotions. Every page\n\nbrims with invention and vitality. Clara, the visionary heroine, journeys through a fully realized,\n\nintensely felt, and yet magical world of longing and eros, of solitude and union, of loss and redemption,\n\nof darkness and light. Katherine Vaz has made a memorable debut.\" ~ Gwyneth Cravens\n\nKATHERINE VAZ has worked as an Associate Professor of English at the University of California-Davis. Her short fiction has appeared in over a dozen literary quarterlies, including Triquarterly, Gettysburg Review, The American Voice, Nimrod, Other Voices and Kalliope. She writes nonfiction pieces occasionally for the Boston Globe, and her chapter on baptism will appear in Signatures of Grace (Dutton, Spring, 2000), a collection which also includes works by Mary Gordon, Andre Dubus, Paul Mariani and Patricia Hampl.\n\nVaz is a member of Authors Guild, PEN/America, the Luso-American Education Foundation and PALCUS (Portuguese American Leadership Council of the U.S.).\n\nIn boiling down a single definition for magical realism, Katherine Vaz likes to start with \"Carpentier's notion of marvelous reality -- fiction's search for the extraordinary within the ordinary world to create a vision that elevates everything out of the mundane.\"\n\nVaz's stories show much insight into this design. For example, in the story, \"The Remains of Princess Kaiulani's Garden,\" the daughter of a laundress spends much of the story trying to assert her position in the world. What could be more ordinary in the life of any dreaming young girl assigned to tasks of menial labor? Consider her hands. Too large and awkward for playing the beautiful ukulele her father strums for the king, they scrub, starch and iron blessings into the garments she washes. But you'll find this isn't the real secret to the story, or the limit to its magic.\n\n\"This literary tradition seems particularly willing to elicit the invisible within the visible world,\" Vaz says of magical realism, \"to view them as a single entity.\"\n\nWe couldn't agree more. The everyday details inside her stories sketch the vibrant outlines of voluptuous, aching miracles at which nobody looks twice.\n\nmargin home | contents | links | reading list | marginalia | contributors | staff | guidelines | kudos | subscriptions | contact us"
