Later she worked for The Wall Street Journal, where she covered crises in the the Middle East, Africa, and the Balkans.\n\nShe was awarded the Pulitzer Prize in fiction in 2006 for her novel March. Her first novel, Year of Wonders, is an international bestseller, and People of the Book is a New York Times bestseller translated into 20 languages. She is also the author of the nonfiction works Nine Parts of Desire and Foreign Correspondence.\n\nBrooks married author Tony Horwitz in Tourette-sur-Loup, France, in 1984. They have two sons– Nathaniel and Bizuayehu–and two dogs. They divide their time between homes in Martha’s Vineyard, Massachusetts, and Sydney, Australia.\n\nRead the full press release\n\nRead a March 2007 Interview with Geraldine Brooks\n\n“I was in the slammer in a town in Nigeria and I didn’t know how long I was going to be kept in detention,” she says. “And I had one of those oops-I-forgot-to-get-pregnant-moments. When they released me after only three days, I came home and greeted my husband with renewed enthusiasm and our son was born the following year.”\n\nShe didn’t want to travel the world on long, open-ended assignments anymore. A history buff, she first turned to non-fiction writing. Brooks had always been intrigued by the story of a village in England during the 1660s whose inhabitants decided to quarantine themselves when the Bubonic Plague arrived from London rather than flee and spread the disease.\n\n“I thought that was such a remarkable self-sacrificing decision and a remarkable example of a town coming to a difficult consensus,” she says.\n\nBut when Brooks dug in to explore that story, she found numerous holes in the historical record. The only way to do it, she says, was through fiction. The result was Year of Wonders: A Novel of the Plague in 2001.\n\nHer next historical novel, March, plunged readers into the Civil War. She plucked her protagonist, March, from Louisa May Alcott’s Little Women. March won the 2006 Pulitzer Prize.\n\n“I just love to find these stories in the past where there are missing pieces in the record that you have to use your imagination to fill.”\n\nBrooks says she thinks the themes fiction deals with can have a role toward advancing peace.\n\n“There’s a wonderful anthology by my fellow countryman Peter Singer, who’s now an ethicist at Princeton University, called The Moral of the Story,” she says. “It looks at excerpts from works in which ethical questions are explored. I think that fiction is a wonderful place to really take the probe into the human heart and why we behave as we do, ethically and unethically.”\n\nAs a girl, Brooks was raised Catholic; yet she was obsessed with the history of the Jewish people.\n\n“My mother was from an Irish-Catholic family and I went to Catholic school with the big hats and gloves and school uniforms,” she says. “But my father wasn’t a religious man.\n\nHis religion, if you like, was leftist politics. And he had served in what was then Palestine during World War II.”\n\nEnthralled with the romance of the Zionist pioneers and the kibbutz movement, her father became an ardent socialist Zionist. During the Six-Day War, the family followed the news closely and looked at the maps in the newspapers.\n\n“He’d been to some of the kibbutzim that were being shelled,” she says. “And he talked about the children’s houses and the shelters. And so that gripped my childish imagination.”\n\nBrooks says she read everything she could get her hands on about Jewish history. In high school, her senior project was on the Suez crisis.\n\n“When I was in graduate school, I met Tony Horwitz and at that point, I have to admit that I didn’t know Horwitz was a Jewish name,” she says. “I fell in love with him and later on found out that he was indeed Jewish. And when we decided to get married, there was no way I wanted to be the end of that line of history. And so I decided that I would convert to the faith so that our kids could be Jewish.”\n\nJudaism influenced the topic of her most recent novel, People of the Book. Brooks says she was intrigued by the history of the Sarajevo Haggadah, created in 14th-century Spain and saved over the centuries by “various unlikely rescuers, some of whom were Muslim and one of whom was Catholic, and the story of why these people risked their lives in some cases to save a Jewish book.”\n\nThe illuminated Haggadah survived the four-year siege of Sarajevo during the Bosnian War. Today, it is on permanent display at the National Museum of Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n\n“It’s a tremendous honor for me to get this award and tremendously meaningful because when I was a journalist, I covered the conflict in the Balkans,” Brooks says. “What happened in Dayton — everybody says, well it’s not a perfect peace. Well, when is peace ever perfect? But I know from being there during the war and after the war that what happened in Dayton achieved so much on the ground in terms of the way people are able to go about their lives.”\n\n— Interviewed by Marshall Weiss,\n\nThe Dayton Jewish Observer\n\nHurricane Katrina ravaged the Gulf Coast in the late summer of 2005, causing what is generally described as the worst natural disaster in American history. But that phrase was never quite accurate—not because the disaster wasn’t “the worst,” but because it wasn’t entirely natural. Katrina and its aftermath gave rise to some of the finest journalistic investigation and writing that the country has seen in decades. We now understand the extent to which human error left New Orleans vulnerable in the first place. We know that the response to the disaster by the federal and state authorities was both inadequate and, where it existed at all, deeply flawed. And we know that the tragedy in New Orleans was heightened by the behavior of many individuals acting alone—some of it criminal, some of it ignorant, some of it merely selfish, and some of it backed by the power of a badge.\n\nBut we also know that the catastrophe gave us moments of redemptive power and enduring grace — moments in which individuals somehow transcended the tragedy of their circumstances and stood squarely for the most fundamental human values. In his book Zeitoun, Dave Eggers tells the story of one such man, Abdulrahman Zeitoun, a Syrian-born contractor who happens to be Muslim, and who lives in New Orleans to this day with his American-born wife, Kathy, and his five children. The arc of the story is, in a sense, simple. As Katrina hit and the waters began to rise, Zeitoun’s family was evacuated to safety. He himself remained behind to help in any way he could — because he felt he simply must. In an old canoe, Zeitoun paddled around the neighborhood. He saved an old woman who had been in the water for an entire day. He paddled on, saving other people. To still others he brought supplies of food and water. And then, suddenly, without warning, in a house he himself owned, he was arrested by a SWAT team and held incommunicado on suspicion of being a looter, perhaps even a terrorist. Months elapse before Zeitoun is released, and before his family reunited.\n\nSo: a simple arc. But the story is by no means simple. Or to put it another way, it is as simple as any profound exploration of human character and motivation; as simple as any study of human courage; as simple as any investigation of an ordinary individual confronted with forces, natural and man-made, that threaten to turn his world upside down. Eggers unfolds the story in prose that is calm, clean, utterly restrained — the book offers a master class in creative nonfiction, and a reminder that the highest art is achieved when the artistry seems to disappear. Zeitoun is that rare thing, a book that is destined to be both loved and taught, and a book with the potential to being change to our lives, one stroke of the paddle at a time.\n\n– Cullen Murphy, 2010 finalist judge\n\nEditor at Large of Vanity Fair\n\n2008 Nonfiction runner-up for Are We Rome?\n\nJustine Hardy has been a journalist for twenty-one years, many of those spent covering South Asia. She is the author of five books ranging in subject from war to Hindi film: The Ochre Border, 1995, was about the reopening of the Tibetan frontier-lands. Her second Scoop-Wallah, 1999, was the story of her time on an Indian newspaper in Delhi. It was short-listed for the Thomas Cook/Daily Telegraph Travel Book Award 2000 and serialised on BBC Radio 4. Goat: A Story of Kashmir and Notting Hill, 2000, was an inside look at life in Kashmir and Notting Hill, two places drawn together by the latter’s obsession with the fine pashmina weave of the Kashmir Valley. This was also serialised on BBC Radio 4. Bollywood Boy, 2002, was a bestseller in which the Hindi film industry was the vehicle for a closer look at the obsession with fame as it crept West to East, as well as a closer look at the darker side of an industry pumping out high-octane escapism for an audience of over a billion. The Wonder House, 2005, is a novel set in Kashmir against the background of the conflict, and based on Justine’s experience of frontline coverage, time spent in militant training camps, and amongst the extremists. It was short-listed for the Author’s Club best first novel in 2006. Her books have been translated into nine languages including Hindi and Serbian.\n\nJustine writes for The Financial Times. She also freelances for The Times, various Condé Nast magazines such as Vanity Fair and Traveler, as well as other publications.\n\nAs a documentary maker and presenter she started at Channel 4 in 1996 on BAFTA-nominated series Urban Jungle. She has worked on several BBC strands in India for both BBC and BBC World. Justine was a presenter on Travel TV for four years. Her most recent work was as a co-presenter with Jerry Hall on a series about Eastern philosophy’s journey West for BBC.\n\nJustine is a director of the NGO in India that she wrote about in Goat. Development Research and Action Group sets up schools in slum areas of Delhi that have been over-looked by the bigger international agencies, usually because of the problems of slum politics. After the earthquake in Kashmir in October 2005 Justine was involved in setting up an NGO with some Kashmiri friends in The Valley. The Kashmir Welfare Trust is building homes, schools and medical centres in some of the worst effected areas, as well as moving into conflict mediation. In England Justine is part of New Bridge, a foundation working on the rehabilitation of life sentence prisoners before release.\n\nJustine has been studying Eastern philosophy and yoga all through her adult life. She teaches yoga and philosophy in the UK and in India, both in Delhi and in the schools that The Kashmir Welfare Trust has in The Valley.\n\nIn the Valley of Mist is a brilliant work of the mind and the heart. Combining an uncompromising sense of how complex the world is, and a near-Chekhovian ability to show us our foibles and to evince our great, often indecorous, passions, Justine Hardy’s poetic book about the Kashmir Valley— and the terrible human cost of the dislocations there — is a paean to the great and difficult work of building friendships between the author and the Dar family, between an Englishwoman and a Muslim family, and the near-inassimilable legacy of loss that ceaseless war and ceaseless destruction exacts on a beautiful land and its inhabitants. It is a book about people who want the best for their children and who know, first-hand, the dangers of a rising fundamentalism. And it is a book that makes us understand — in evocative, human-centered prose — that those who so frighten us are also frightened. And it is a book written by a woman, with a rich eye for detail and a lovely sense of the alliterative; a woman, with a British sense of a woman’s agency, who, understandably, finds much in the Kashmir Valley to be distasteful in its treatment of women. And it is a book, judicious as always, that provides us with the full measure of the Kasmiri woman’s sense of herself — of her interiority — which differs markedly from Hardy’s conception. There are no easy categorizations in Hardy’s work. There are only, as Hardy writes, “the stories… from inside their world” (my italics).\n\nAt the end of the Second World War, the scholar Oscar Williams, in a very pithy introduction to his anthology of British and American poetry, wrote: “In this difficult time, it is only the human heart that may prove provident enough to outweigh the atomic bomb.” And in no small sense, Justine Hardy’s book is just as provocatively situated, for the Kashmir Valley is the locus of great political shifts and currents, ideologies of religious fundamentalism and competing nationalisms, desires for self-determination and regional superiority, great upswellings of amassed hurts and distorted dreams, and the contested domain of two competing nuclear powers — India and Pakistan. And yet it is also one of the most beautiful places on the face of the planet, which Hardy describes in writing as lyrical as it is trenchant.\n\nAlthough In the Valley of Mist is the story of the Dar family — and Hardy’s evolving friendship with them and their beautiful valley — it is just as demonstrably the narrative of how one apprehends difference, during great cultural and political upheaval. The author is a long-term visitor to the Kashmir Valley, where she grew up as a young girl, at first appreciating as a young person does, the great pageantry of the life about her. As a self-conscious adolescent, she witnesses a young boy kill a goat for a religious festival, Bakra Eid. Hardy quickly comprehends the boy’s reticence — he does not want to kill the animal. And yet in that moment of shared commiseration, we confront the great divide that experience, religion, and history provide. In many ways, this book is the chronicle of such weighty moments of connection and miss-connection.\n\nStill, time and time again, Hardy startles us with her ability to empathize with the voiceless. Her description of how the poor become easy conscripts for terrorism is chilling in its veracity. Her description of the village of Kunan Poshpura, where Indian solders allegedly raped the entire female population, and where the women are in a state of psychic and social pariahdom, is horrific.\n\nIn the Valley of Mist, Hardy reminds us that all true human connection depends on a reverence for human experience, which cannot be denied. A British woman and a Muslim man can find moments of solidarity, but only if it is based on mutual respect and mutual acknowledgement of what is ultimately untranslatable in human affairs. As Hardy writes about her friend Mohammad Dar, with whom she has shared much: “We work together. There are gaps, cultural voids that we fall into, sentences left unfinished, times when we have to turn away from each other.” And yet, thank goodness, there are also times when, “He lets me catch up and we talk about things that are needed for the school. Sometimes he asks [my] advice about something.” Such small, fledgling moments of trust, such small openings for comity, Justine Hardy reminds us, are at the center of the world’s calculus.\n\nIn this dark time, when the fate of the planet may in fact depend on such hard-won moments of interconnection, Hardy’s book becomes revelatory. There is little of the romantic in this — Hardy is too clear-eyed. But like Anton Chekhov, or the great African American writer James Baldwin, Justine Hardy realizes that self-knowledge is the first step in the knowledge of others, that although we may lie to ourselves about the world, the world is under no obligation to lie for us. As Justine Hardy underscores in her magnificent book, and in her great philanthropic work in the Kashmir Valley, true intercultural cooperation can only be forged — slowly, with great judiciousness, and with great humility. In this ever-dangerous world, with its ever-increasing manifold dangers, we had best listen to her.\n\n– Kenneth McClane\n\n2010 finalist judge\n\nCornell University\n\nis the W.E.B.

He has served on the Board of Trustees of Adelphi University, and on the Board of Directors of the Tompkins County Library Foundation, the Constance Saltonstall Foundation for the Arts, the New York Council for the Humanities, and the Tompkins County Community Foundation, where he was a Founding Board Member.\n\nIf you ask Nick Clooney what he does for a living, he will tell you he is a reporter. That is true, but hardly exhaustive.\n\nAs a television newsman, Nick has been reporter, anchor, managing editor and news director in Lexington, Cincinnati, Salt Lake City, Buffalo and Los Angeles.\n\nAs a columnist, Nick has, since 1989, contributed three columns a week to the Cincinnati and Kentucky Post dealing with subjects as varied as politics, travel, music and American history. Some of his articles and op-ed pieces have appeared in newspapers around the country, including the Los Angeles Times and the Salt lake Tribune.\n\nAs an author, he has published three books, including The Movies That Changed Us in 2002.\n\nBut the curiosity that drove Nick to a life as a reporter, also led him to explore other areas of interest. He hosted talk shows in Cincinnati and Columbus and music programs on radio. For five years he was a writer and daily on-air spokesman for American Movie Classic cable channel. Now, he is a writer, producer and host for American Life cable channel. His Moments that Changed Usprogram explores the intersection of a person and an important moment in our history. Guests have included John Glenn, Walter Cronkite, Diahann Carroll and Steve Wozniak.\n\nNick began working on radio full time when he was 17, in his hometown of Maysville, Kentucky.\n\nIn addition to his continuing broadcasting career, Nick has been a speaker, master of ceremonies or panelist of more than 3,000 events coast-to-coast.\n\nNick has accumulated a number of awards and honors over the years, including an Emmy for commentary and three Emmy nominations for his work on American Movie Classics. In December 1998, he received an honorary Doctorate of Fine Arts from Northern Kentucky University. In 2000, he received the President’s Medal from Thomas More College, and was inducted into the Cincinnati Journalism Hall of Fame. In 2001, Nick was inducted into the Kentucky Journalism Hall of Fame. In 2005, he was inducted into the Ohio Television Hall of Fame. In May 2007, Nick received an honorary Doctor of Letters from the University of Kentucky and was the commencement speaker, a task he has undertaken at 31 other schools over the years.\n\nNick is married to Nina Warren of Perryville, Kentucky, who is a writer, inventor and TV host. Their oldest child, Ada, also a writer, is the mother of the World’s Only Grandchildren, Allison and Nick. The Clooney’s younger child, George, is an Oscar-winning actor, producer, writer and director in films.\n\nIn April of 2006, Nick and his son George went to the Sudan and Chad to report on the ongoing genocide in the region of Darfur. Since their return, both have traveled extensively as advocates for a peaceful solution to the crisis. George has spoken at the United Nations and has traveled to China and Egypt. He continues to hold fundraisers, while Nick has made more than 75 speeches at schools, churches, and town meetings. The pair has also made a documentary, Journey to Darfur, which has been shown internationally.\n\nIn the early 1970s, Nick and Nina decided to establish a permanent home from which they could travel according to the demands of their peripatetic profession. They moved to the beautiful river town of Augusta, Kentucky. Both of their children graduated from tiny Augusta High School. Eventually, other members of the family found their way to Augusta, including Nick’s famous sister, Rosemary Clooney. After her death in 2002, Rosemary’s home became a museum honoring her career.\n\nAdvancing years sometimes dictate a slow-down in professional activity. Someone forgot to tell Nick. He is currently the “distinguished journalist in residence” at the American University in Washington D.C. through the partnership between the school and the Newseum, a 250,000-square-foot museum in Washington dedicated to news. He’ll teach opinion writing this fall and a spring course based on his 2002 book, Movies That Changed Us."
