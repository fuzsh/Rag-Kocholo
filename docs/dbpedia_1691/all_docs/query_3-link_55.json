She holds a PhD from Columbia U and has taught in the MFA programs at Columbia and the New School. Her poetry and prose have won multiple awards and she lectures widely.\n\nAcross Fiction, Nonfiction, and Poetry good writing doesn't always have the pop it needs to get noticed. This is a four session course where we will talk about four techniques to deliver that bright crackle and how to use them: Repetition, conversation, sharp sensory notes, and internal reaction. I'll give you my take on those and share some examples from great writing. The class is designed to be a fun intellectual and artistic adventure. Aside from what I have planned for us each meeting, there will be room for questions about any of my books or publishing experiences. I have won and judged literary prizes and will discuss that as well. Throughout the course I will give you opportunities to send me work for response and possibilities to share with the class. Writers will do, and possibly share, some in class writing.\n\nWorkshop Highlights:\n\nWriters will gain a variety of ways to create thrills, chills, fears, and tears in their writing\n\nWriters will learn about what wakes up editors, judges, and readers\n\nClasses will be made up of short peppy lectures, much conversation, and some fun short writing\n\nThere will be chances for writers to send me some work for personal response.\n\n2 partial scholarships available.

As the writer Arundhati Roy says, there is no such thing as the voiceless, only those who are purposely silenced. Over the course of two sessions, I will introduce you to literary and political writing on Palestine that has formed my understanding on the subject. We will read and discuss non-fiction texts and essays by Raja Shehadeh, Suad Amiry, Mohammed el Kurd, Omar Barghouti, and Isabella Hammad among other writers. No prior knowledge on the subject is required and all age groups are welcome. You will receive reading packs and we will have time for questions. You can take one session or both. We hope to have guest speakers that will be announced closer to the time.\n\nWorkshop Highlights:\n\nDeep dive into non-fiction writing on Palestine\n\nGuest speakers\n\nReading pack that will serve as an important resource\n\nScholarships are available.

Their debut novel, Let Me Explain You, was selected as New York Times Editors Choice in 2015, and their work has appeared in The New York Times Book Review, Electric Literature, BOMB, Lithub, The Believer, McSweeney’s, Oprah Daily, and elsewhere. Annie has presented \"Flash & Furious: Creative Nonfiction Bursts\" at the Disquiet International Literary Program in Lisbon and at the Lighthouse Writers Workshop in Denver.\n\nThere may be no more potent form than short Creative Nonfiction, which “the writer’s experience of the world makes small and large at the same time.” Our excursions into short Creative Nonfiction ask us how real, how raw, how precise and unforgettable we can get in 2,000 words or less. What story or stories are you ready to excavate? What worlds exist within you, what discoveries might you make among your compatriots? How can you invite others to join you? In this generative workshop, we invoke the authorial stance of the lived experience to build intimacy with the reader, engaging in a friendship that—in the words of Philip Lopate—“is based on identification, understanding, testiness, and companionship” & “confides everything from gossip to wisdom.” And we do it all in a little over a page.\n\nParticipants of all levels working across all genres are welcome to join the party! This workshop is designed for participants who want to play, as well as for those hoping to walk away with a draft towards publication. Our last session, if enrollment permits, will be devoted to one-on-one mini conferences.\n\nWorkshop Highlights:\n\nOur generative workshop offers scaffolded writing prompts, mentor texts, collaborative exercises, and opportunities for sharing\n\nOur last session, if enrollment permits, will be devoted to one-on-one mini conferences.\n\nThere are full scholarships available for a BiPoC writer and for a writer living with disability. For more information, please contact Kate Mabus, kate@theshipmanagency.com.\n\n1 Session: Sunday, August 25\n\n1:00-4:00pm ET\n\nKyle Dillon Hertz\n\nThis craft course is led by Kyle Dillon Hertz, author of The Lookback Window, which was longlisted for the VCU Cabell First Novelist Prize, and was a New York Times Editors' Choice. Vanity Fair named The Lookback Window one of the best novels of 2023. His work can be found in Esquire, Freeman’s, Time, and elsewhere. He received his MFA from NYU and a residency from Yaddo. He teaches at The New School.\n\nIn this seminar, we will examine the myriad appearances of intimacy in fiction. What are all the different ways that writers have used intimacy to create a profound sense of being? When we write, we want to reach the reader, and we do this through exploring the opposing forces of mind and body in literature. Through characters thinking, touching, wanting, fighting one another. So how do the greats do this? And how can we use as many of these techniques in our work as possible? We will examine passages from Patricia Highsmith's Carol, Raven Leilani's Luster, and Andrew Holleran's The Beauty of Men, among other writers.\n\nWorkshop Highlights:\n\nWriters will leave the class with numerous methods of intimacy. We will look at twenty different examples of such literary techniques, and you will be able to apply them to your own work.\n\nWriters will look closely at the work of Raven Leilani, Patricia Highsmith, and Andrew Holleran.\n\nWriters will have a chance to think about their own work and have a q&a about it at the end of class.\n\n2 full and 2 half scholarships available.

At such times, a well-written artist statement can go a long way to make you stand out from the pack. In this session, we’ll discuss the key components that every personal statement and statement of purpose should include, as well as holistic, big-picture considerations for making your application as strong as can be. A necessary and practical workshop for writers looking to apply for fellowships, residencies, MFA programs, and grants. You will be provided with resources, examples, strategies, and tips that will ensure your applications are taken seriously.\n\nWorkshop Highlights:\n\nParticipants will learn about the types of residencies, conferences, creative writing programs, and fellowships that exist.\n\nParticipants will learn about tools for locating different programs and strategies for becoming an attractive applicant.\n\nParticipants will learn what elements must be included in applicant statements, and will receive sample statements and tips for avoiding common writing sample errors.\n\n2 full scholarships available.

They previously wrote Vulture's Best Sex I've Ever Read Column. Their work appears in The New York Times, New York Times Magazine, GQ, The Cut, The Atlantic, and elsewhere.\n\nEvery couple months, someone online asks a predictable question: What is the point of including sex scenes in books and TV and movies? Normally, these questions are asked in bad faith. They’re meant to manufacture engagement. But beneath the clickbait is a serious question for art: Why is it sometimes necessary to include sex in a narrative? The truth is, many books would be improved if stripped of their poorly-written sex scenes. However, when a sex scene succeeds, it can serve as one of the most profound and memorable passages in a book. The best sex scenes don’t merely capture the physicality of the moment, they reveal characters’ unspoken longings, they make readers laugh, and, on the best occasions, they’re as engaging as the act itself.\n\nIn this class, we will read work from writers like Imogen Binnie, Raven Leilani, Bryan Washington, Garth Greenwell, K. Patrick, and others to deepen our understanding of how sex scenes work to develop character, heighten tension, and advance plot in fiction. The course will be split into three sessions. Each session will focus on a particular aspect of sex writing: 1. The Anticipation (Desire) 2. The Act 3. The Aftermath. Students will also complete short craft exercises.\n\nWorkshop Highlights:\n\nDeepen your understanding of what makes a sex scene successful\n\nLearn why sex scenes are often necessary in fiction\n\nWrite your own sex scene(s) using craft elements from class\n\n2 full scholarships available. To apply, please send a brief statement (fewer than 300 words) detailing how your work would benefit from a scholarship to kate@theshipmanagency.com by August 15.\n\n3 Sessions: Sunday, September 29, October 6, October 13\n\n3:00-5:00pm ET\n\nAyşegül Savaş\n\nAyşegül Savaş is the author of three critically acclaimed novels, as well as a work of non-fiction,The Wilderness, which will be published in October, 2025. Her short story collection, Long Distance, is forthcoming from Bloomsbury. Her stories appear regularly in the New Yorker and have also been published in The Paris Review, Granta, The Yale Review, among others. She has taught creative writing at the Sorbonne, and lives in Paris.\n\nAre you daunted by the idea of plot? Do you feel stuck once you have set up the landscape and characters of your fictional world? Plot, for some writers, can be the most challenging pat of finishing a short story or novel, but this difficulty may be alleviated by shifting the focus of the narrative drive. In this seminar, we will consider plot as a time structure rather than a series of events we must invent to keep the story going. In each session, we will examine the plot structures of several fictional works and discuss how their internal clocks create a sense of momentum. We will also look at different types of time structures (linear, looping, repeating...) Most importantly, we will discuss how these different forms can organically dictate the content of a fictional work.\n\nWorkshop Highlights:\n\nGain confidence in your ability to create plot\n\nGain familiarity with analyzing a work's structure\n\nThink about time structures in your own writing.\n\n1 full and 1 partial scholarship available. For information, please contact Kate Mabus, kate@theshipmanagency.com\n\n26 Sessions: every other Tuesday, October 1, 2024-September 23, 2025\n\n6:00-8:30pm ET\n\nHilary Leichter\n\n12 students, payment plans available. Note: This is an application-based workshop. Please do not register until you been accepted into the course.\n\nHilary Leichter is the author of the novels Temporary and Terrace Story. She has been a finalist for The Center for Fiction First Novel Prize, the New York Public Library Young Lions Fiction Prize, and her work in Harper's Magazine won the 2021 National Magazine Award in Fiction. Terrace Story was named a best book of 2023 by Time Magazine, The New Yorker, The LA Times, Publishers Weekly, and other publications. She teaches at Columbia University, where she is the Assistant Director of Undergraduate Studies for Creative Writing.\n\nAre you working on a book and you’re not exactly sure how to talk about it? Do you occasionally call it a “thing” or a “thingy”? Is it not quite a Bildungsroman, almost a family epic, and sort of a novel-in-stories? Is it nearly speculative, or casually satirical, but also earnest and realist? Is it experimental, but does it also sound like your favorite Modernist writers? When people ask you to describe it, do you break into a cold sweat and start grasping for words that aren’t quite right? Who are these people, asking you to describe your book thingy? Rude! Don’t worry: it’s none of their business. The thing about using tired language, trends, and buzzwords to talk about your art is that you’ll end up writing something you can describe. And what’s the point of that? If you can easily describe your novel before it’s written, why do you need to write it in the first place? You'll find the right shelf for your book when it's done.\n\nIn this year-long novel generator, you’ll take your book from its earliest stages and push it toward a full manuscript. We will resist the overdetermination of our work, and resist describing what does not yet exist, instead allowing your projects to teach you what they are, and how they want to be written. Bi-weekly workshops will include generative craft talks and engagement with texts that challenge, expand, and evolve the form.\n\nWorkshop Highlights:\n\nMeet editors, agents, and industry professionals\n\nBenefit from one-on-one meetings with the instructor\n\nMake significant progress on their novels before the end of the year\n\nTo apply, please send a writing sample of approximately five double-spaced pages from the novel-in-progress you hope to workshop in this class, along with a short statement (250 words) telling me about the project. Just a few short sentences—any longer than that, and I’m afraid we’ll unmake what hasn’t even been made. Don’t worry—whatever your book is or isn’t, it’s none of my business. Please submit all materials to kate@theshipmanagency.com by Monday, September 2 to be considered for the course.\n\n1 full scholarship available. For information, and to learn about payment plans, please contact Kate Mabus, kate@theshipmanagency.com\n\n4 Sessions: Tuesdays, October 1, 8, 15, 22\n\n8:00-9:30pm ET\n\nSunil Yapa\n\n10 students\n\nSunil is the author of the best-selling novel Your Heart is a Muscle the Size of a Fist, called “fast-paced and unflinching” by the New Yorker, a “genuine tour-de-force,” by the Seattle Times, and was a finalist for the Pen Faulkner Award. Sunil is an experienced teacher, having taught at The University of Nevada Lake Tahoe, The Center for Fiction, and with Pam Houston’s Writing by Writers. He holds a MFA in fiction from the CUNY Hunter MFA in NYC where he worked with Colum McCann and Peter Carey. He also holds a tv writing certificate from UCLA TV & FILM and has written extensively in fiction, non-fiction, and screenplays.\n\nGreat stories make us care; they take us on a rollercoaster of emotion. Yet often as writers we get stuck—poignant character studies without movement, or, a series of random plot moments. How can we bring them together into a story that is as emotionally satisfying as it is gripping?\n\nUsing films, tv series, and novels— from Finding Nemo to Ferrante, Breaking Bad to Moonlight—we will break down techniques to tell a story whose heart is a character’s deepest needs, contradictions, vulnerabilities, and secrets. My goal as a novelist and screenwriter is to give you screenwriting tools adapted for the novel so that you can break through on your project. Class includes watching two movies per week, one seminar meeting a week; a manuscript in progress is encouraged but not required.\n\nTopics:\n\nWeek 1: You Can’t Always Get What You Want….\n\nWeek 2: Contradiction, Vulnerability, Secrets\n\nWeek 3: Every Story is a Love Story\n\nWeek 4: Hollywood Bullsh*t Demystified\n\nWorkshop Highlights:\n\nWatch and dissect 8 films (or long form TV)\n\nLearn character-driven storytelling secrets\n\nBreak through on your project in progress\n\n2 partial scholarships available. For information, please contact Kate Mabus, kate@theshipmanagency.com\n\n1 Session: Monday, October 21\n\n7:30-9:30pm ET\n\nEmma Copley Eisenberg\n\nEmma Copley Eisenberg is the author of the 2024 national bestselling novel Housemates, as well as the nonfiction book The Third Rainbow Girl (Hachette, 2020), which was a New York Times Notable Book and Editor's Choice as well as nominated for a Lambda Award, an Edgar Award, and an Anthony Award. Her third book, Fat Swim, a collection of short stories, will be published in 2026. Her short fiction has appeared in Granta, McSweeney’s, VQR, American Short Fiction, and other publications, and she is the recipient of fellowships, grants and residencies from Yaddo, Bread Loaf, the Tin House Summer Workshop, the Millay Colony, the Robert Rauschenberg Foundation, and the Elizabeth George Foundation.\n\nCalled \"one of the truly original voices of American fiction in the later twentieth century\" by The New Yorker, Grace Paley (1922-2007) is at once a giant in the literary canon and gigantically forgotten. This may be because she didn't publish novels but instead \"only\" short stories, essays, and reportage, and \"only\" three collections. But without Paley there would be no George Saunders and perhaps no Miranda July or ZZ Packer or T Kira Madden; Paley's humor and innovative dialogue and knack for compression rewired American letters. Further, Paley's committed activism against apartheid, Zionism, and fascism make her \"a rare example of a writer deeply engaged with the world\" (Jewish Women's Archive).\n\nWhat can we learn from Paley in 2024? How is the craft of dialogue, character, and scene profoundly connected to the work of justice? How can anti-Zionist Jewish writers and all writers of conscience be inspired by her indefatigable energy for writing and for change? In this seminar, we’ll discuss two short stories and one essay by Paley. We’ll examine her craft moves, her inventiveness with language, her use of dialogue and voice, as well as the structure of her polemics to see how Paley's tools might help us identify and expand the possibilities of our own work.\n\nWorkshop Highlights:\n\nA fun and joyful study of the craft hallmarks and artistic vision of Grace Paley\n\nA deeper understanding of how humor, voice, and justice can enrich our short fiction\n\nThe seminar will also include a Q&A.\n\n1 full and 2 half scholarships available. For information, please contact Kate Mabus, kate@theshipmanagency.com\n\n1 Session: Saturday, November 2\n\n12:00-3:00pm ET\n\nLaura Warrell\n\n20 students\n\nLaura Warrell is the author of Sweet, Soft, Plenty Rhythm, a finalist for the PEN/Faulkner Award for Fiction and the Barnes & Noble Discover Prize, and long-listed for the Andrew Carnegie Medal for Excellence in Fiction. Her writing has appeared in the Los Angeles Times, the New York Times, Lit Hub, Los Angeles Review of Books, Huffington Post, and other publications. Laura has attended residencies at the Bread Loaf Writers’ Conference and the Tin House Writer’s Workshop. She lives in Los Angeles and teaches at the low-residency MFA program at Pacific University.\n\nFiction hinges on conflict and few elements of a story create more conflict than a powerful antagonist. But what if we want to write antagonists who are not only strong adversaries for our characters, but who are also plain villains (and perhaps even problematic ones)? Do we need to humanize them? If so, how do we do it without justifying their bad actions? In this generative fiction class, we’ll discuss these questions and look at examples of characters in stories and novels who might challenge or even offend our sensibilities yet still manage to capture our attention. We’ll explore how authors use dialogue, backstory, plotting, and specific detail to strike a balance between understanding and reproach, evenhandedness and accountability. Generative exercises will help us identify our characters’ motivations so we can empathize and ultimately write them in ways that make readers want to follow their journeys. There is no workshop component to this class, but there will be opportunities to share your work. There will be time for Q&A. My goal is for writers to leave the seminar with the tools to create rich, full-fledged characters and the confidence to put them on the page.\n\nWorkshop Highlights:\n\nGain a deeper understanding of what makes your antagonist tick\n\nLearn strategies to flesh out antagonists that feel authentic and distinctive\n\nWrite at least one scene that reveals something new about your antagonist (and may even make it into your manuscript)\n\n1 full and 1 partial scholarship available. For information, please contact Kate Mabus, kate@theshipmanagency.com\n\n1 Session: Sunday, December 1\n\n1:00-4:00pm ET\n\nKyle Dillon Hertz\n\nKyle Dillon Hertz is the author of The Lookback Window, a New York Times Editors’ Choice. Vanity Fair named The Lookback Window one of the best novels of 2023. His work can be found in Esquire, Freeman’s, Time, and elsewhere. He received his MFA from NYU and a residency from Yaddo. He teaches at The New School.\n\nIn this class, we will explore the ways to transform real-life trauma into complex art. When I was writing The Lookback Window, I wanted my novel to be as funny as it was dark and shocking and violent. I wanted to write about the violent trauma from my own life and make it read how I experienced it in the real world, which meant it needed to be multifaceted. In this class, we will look at the various methods writers use to turn real-life trauma into art that is sad, horny, funny, angry, etc...\n\nI've always rejected the idea that a book about trauma must simply be sad or the cliche victim to survivor narrative. That's not how most people experience the world, and that doesn't often make the best art. So we will look at many different examples from different writers to free ourselves.\n\nWorkshop Highlights:\n\nWriters will have multiple examples of different ways to turn real-life trauma into narrative art\n\nWriters will have exercises to help facilitate voice and story according to the different examples we have\n\nWriters will have a chance to do a q&a during the class to make sure all their questions are answered. Writing about trauma is hard, especially when it is your own, and this class will make sure to leave time for everyone to be heard\n\n2 full and 2 partial scholarships available. For information, please contact Kate Mabus, kate@theshipmanagency.com\n\n1 Session: Saturday, September 14\n\n1:00-3:00pm ET\n\nAnna Clark\n\nAnna Clark is the author of The Poisoned City, which won the Hillman Prize and the Rachel Carson book award. It was named one of the year's best books by the Washington Post, the San Francisco Chronicle, Audible, the New York Public Library, Kirkus, and others. She's an investigative journalist with ProPublica and a faculty member in Alma College's MFA program in creative writing. She edited A Detroit Anthology, wrote a small book of literary history, and was a Fulbright fellow in creative writing.\n\nWhat do you do with pages of promising prose that still feels ... off? When you sit down to revise, what do you actually, literally do? We'll get into it. In this class on how to find your way to \"best words, best order,\" expect an array of specific and substantive ideas for self-editing. Whether you're a longtime writer looking for new ways to give your work a jolt, or you're newly feeling your way through the writing process, this session is for you. Revision is a radical practice. It invites us to see not only our words but ourselves with bracing clarity; to embrace the tumultuousness of change; and to be brave enough to tell the truth. It can even be fun. Let's go forth.\n\nWorkshop Highlights:\n\nHow to catch your unconscious writing tics\n\n\"Small\" changes that make a huge impact\n\nHow to summon a spirit of creative play when you're staring down the same pages for months, or years\n\n3 full scholarships are available on a first come first serve basis. For information, please contact Kate Mabus, kate@theshipmanagency.com\n\nUpdate: All scholarships have been claimed.\n\n2 Sessions: Saturdays, September 14 and 21\n\n4:00-7:00pm ET\n\nStephen Kuusisto\n\n10 Students\n\nJoin blind poet and memoirist Stephen Kuusisto as he talks about what it means to be a “literary listener.” He is the author of the memoirs Have Dog, Will Travel: A Poet’s Journey; Planet of the Blind (a New York Times “Notable Book of the Year”), Eavesdropping: A Memoir of Blindness and Listening, and of the poetry collections Only Bread, Only Light; Letters to Borges; and Old Horse, What is to Be Done? He travels and lectures widely on human rights, disability, literature, and the advantages of guide dogs and human-animal relationships.\n\nKuusisto writes: “Starting in the 1920’s creative writers turned to the image as the means for conveying immediacy in literature. The idea was to be as clear as news photos. These talks will instead focus on sound as a tool of the imagination. Igor Stravinsky said: “Hearing has no merit. A duck hears also.” Our goal is to explore the art of active listening. “ We’ll explore opera arias, steamboat whistles, the chance music of what happens around us, conversations overheard, the sound of a baseball cracking off a bat, water coursing, Chet Baker’s trumpet, Beethoven’s old piano—in short talk about stretching our ears. The aim is to promote great listening, literary invention, and yes, fun. Session One: “Who Are the Great Literary Listeners?” Kuusisto talks about literary listening: why is it different from just hearing things? From John Keats to Tillie Olson, from Hemingway to Toni Morrison the best writers have had a true felicity for deep listening and have conveyed it in their work. One outcome is that you’ll appreciate the auditory imagination when reading. Session Two: The Practice of Active Listening” Kuusisto provides exercises (many drawn from his own life of blind travel) that will sharpen the skills of anyone who wants to not only listen with attention, but also put that experience into writing.\n\nWorkshop Highlights:\n\nEmerge with a sharper sense of sound in the world(s) around them\n\nGain a clearer sense of how to incorporate sound into their own writing\n\n3 full scholarships available. For information, please contact Kate Mabus, kate@theshipmanagency.com\n\n8 Sessions: Saturdays, September 21-November 9\n\n1:00-3:00pm ET\n\nGreg Mania\n\n10 students\n\nThis generator is taught by Greg Mania, author of the memoir, Born to Be Public, which has been named a best book of 2020 by NPR, O, The Oprah Magazine, Electric Literature, The Brooklyn Rail, Largehearted Boy, and was a 2020 Goodreads Choice Award Nominee for Best Humor. He is currently working on his next memoir, How Do You Take Those All at Once?: Notes on Fibromyalgia, Fatigue, and Other Foibles of the Flesh, and Save Our Serotonin: An Illustrated Guide for The Modern and Mentally Ill.\n\nSo, you have an idea for a book. Maybe you even already wrote it! Either way, you are ready for the next step. Does the thought of writing a book proposal for your nonfiction project make you want to light no fewer than 14 lavender-scented candles and lie in the dark for three days straight? You’re not alone! But after having written three book proposals, I promise you it’s not as daunting as it seems.\n\nIn order to demystify this seemingly overwhelming task, I’m thrilled to offer the Book Proposal Generator. Beginning with an overview of the anatomy of the book proposal by looking at several different examples, this generator will be broken up into eight weekly sessions. Each week, we will be discussing and going over one element of the book proposal in detail. At the end of each session, students will be assigned to complete a draft of the section discussed, which is to be handed in the following Friday, no later than 8 p.m. Students will receive peer and instructor feedback in class the following day, after which the next section of the book proposal will discussed and assigned to complete for the following week. By the final session, each student will have a complete book proposal, and will be ready to take the next step on the path to publication.\n\nWorkshop Highlights:\n\nStudents will receive several different examples of proposals that have successfully sold to use as reference when working on their own.\n\nStudents will receive extensive individual feedback on their own proposals from course instructor that will be emailed to them each week.\n\nEach student will leave this course with a complete book proposal, ready to take the next step on the path to publication.\n\n1 full and 1 partial scholarship available. Please contact Kate Mabus, kate@theshipmanagency.com\n\n1 Session: Thursday, November 14\n\n7:00 pm-8:30 pm ET\n\nSonia Shah\n\nThis workshop is led by Sonia Shah, an investigative science journalist, 2024 Guggenheim fellow, and author of critically acclaimed and prize-winning books on science, human-animal relations, and international politics. A former judge for the National Book Awards, Sonia is currently at work on her seventh book, Special: The Rise and Fall of a Beastly Idea, winner of a Whiting creative non-fiction grant and forthcoming from Bloomsbury in 2025.

Her work has been translated into a dozen languages and has been recognized by a National Book Critics Circle Award, a Guggenheim Fellowship, a New America Fellowship, and a 21st Century Award from the Chicago Public Library. She is currently at work on a collection of essays about how private property has shaped our world.\n\n“My ongoing education as a writer has always depended, more than anything else, on returning again and again to certain essays that yield new lessons on every visitation. In this four-part course, we will read eight of these essays together, and each week I will guide us through a close study of two works -- an older work from the 20th century and a newer work from the 21st century.\n\nAs we explore the intricacies of these works, I will model my own process for learning from other writers while explaining, line-by-line, what I see these writers doing on the page, and how they’re responding inventively to the pressures and problems presented by their work. The intent of all this is to not to admire other writers from afar, but to dig in with a fork and directly feed our own work.”\n\nEach class session will include time for us to discuss how the essays we’ve read might inform our own writing and several prompts for producing new writing will be provided at the end of each session. This is essentially a course on the internal mechanics of the essay. We’ll take apart some engines to see how other writers power their vehicles, all in service to better understanding the fundamentals of our own artistry.\n\nSession 1: “At the Dam,” Joan Didion and “What I Learned in Avalanche School,” Heidi Julavits\n\nSession 2: “Equal in Paris,” James Baldwin and “1979,” Aminatta Forna\n\nSession 3: “Kinds of Water,” Anne Carson and “The Querent,” Alex Chee\n\nSession 4: “Parade March from ‘That Creaturely World’” Albert Goldbarth and “Bad English,” Cathy Park Hong\n\nA limited number of scholarships are available. To inquire, please contact Kate Mabus, kate@theshipmanagency.com\n\nI am a poet with three published poetry collections and have been working one-on-one with writers for over five years, including consulting as faculty on collections from students at Randolph College, the Jack Kerouac Disembodied School of Poetics, UC Riverside, and NYU. My accolades include a Pulitzer nomination, the 2017 National Poetry Series, a Dorothy Sargent Rosenberg Poetry Fellowship through the Poetry Foundation, and more. I have an MFA from the University of Arizona as well as an MA in English Literature from UC Irvine and currently teach poetry as part of Randolph College’s Low-Residency MFA program\n\nI believe in providing in-depth generative feedback. In our manuscript consultation, I will work to give a sense of how I’m reading the manuscript, what excites me, but above all what I believe could be emphasized, expanded, focused in on, and written through. This will include a combination of suggested edits, expansions, generative prompts, reordering, and/or reading recommendations.\n\nThis will typically take the form of an email exchange followed by a close-reading. Depending on manuscript length, reading will take between two to four hours. I will write and provide detailed notes throughout this process. In addition to the notes, we’ll meet virtually for a discussion of the work, preferably two hours. As I charge by the hour, however, this process is quite flexible, and I am willing to work with what works best for you.\n\n“I am a poet turned first-time memoirist, and Kavita was the perfect reader for my manuscript. Her attention to narrative structure, flow and focus, and sensory detail helped sharpen my scenes and chapters. For an Asian American coming-of-age narrative set in the turbulent ‘60s, Kavita’s experience and craft recommendations on weaving together social issues with the personal were particularly valuable.\" - Jeffrey Thomas Leong, student\n\nMy manuscript consultation is based on an examination of how a work balances the craft of writing with the substance of conscience, the personal and the political. These guiding principles are ones that I've culled through my fifteen years working for social change and ten years writing about it, including in my recent book Craft and Conscience: How to Write About Social Change. As the creator of the Writing with Conscience class which I've offered through The Shipman Agency, I'm inspired by helping more writers to be writers of conscience.I offer two types of manuscript consultations:\n\n1) Stand Alone Manuscripts - Essays, Articles, Op Eds, Stories. Sliding scale starting at $150 based on length/word count. This includes substantive summary feedback about what is working well and suggestions for improvement as well as line edits.\n\n2) Book Manuscripts - Draft manuscripts for book length works. Sliding scale starting at $500 depending on the length of work. I will provide summary feedback on how the manuscript hangs together as a cohesive whole, respond to the narrative flow and narrative elements, whether the desired themes are coming through, and whether there is a balance between personal and political themes. This also includes a 20 minute post feedback consultation via phone/zoom to discuss any questions.\n\nI have taught poetry workshops and advised poetry thesis manuscripts for the past decade at Princeton University, as well as in the MFA programs at NYU and Columbia, along with guest workshops in graduate and community programs around the country. I have seen manuscripts through from rough drafts, extensive revision, and into publication. I have published four of my own books of poems including Days & Days (Knopf, 2019) and the forthcoming Pacific Power & Light (Knopf, 2024). Many of my poems have appeared in The New Yorker and elsewhere.\n\nThis consultation includes an initial hour-long meeting and conversation about what you imagine your book to be, where it comes from and where you would like it to go. What are your concerns about the work, and what are you most excited about. With these things in mind I will closely read the book and provide both holistic notes as well as suggesting line edits and possible developments and alternatives, including ordering of the manuscript and “writing into the corners” of the book. I will send you these edits and ideas and then we will meet a second time to discuss them, as well as publication possibilities, and strategies for creating new work in the future.\n\nI look forward to working with you!\n\nShort stories, Personal Essays, Memoir\n\nYou: Are not mainstream in your outlook. Your vision is wide, and you are moved to write a work that has deep resonance for your community, your environment, your country, your world. Your story could be intimate and personal or complex and global or all these things. You are a literary writer who has worked on your project using all the tools at your disposal. You want a discerning reader who can evaluate your work using a fresh lens based not only on what you have already created but where you might take it. I have taught for decades in the US and abroad and published collections of stories, and essays, and novels. I have also published poetry and worked as a freelance journalist. I meet writers where they are, with regard for who they are as people, what has moved them to write, and with a view to helping them go further. I help writers to lean into the emotional truths that underlie their writing, to draw on their strengths, and to develop under-utilized aspects of their repertoire.\n\nI begin by talking with you about your project in an initial meeting to assess what you are trying to do, and what would be most useful to you as a writer. Following that, we would work out a series of meetings that would suit your project. Because of the intensely personal nature of creative writing, I choose to work with students whose project/ethics resonate with my own and whom I know I can help in the long term. Please submit a work sample of ten pages to cheyenne@theshipmanagency.com in advance so I can determine fit. If it is a go but your circumstances make the fee prohibitive, let’s talk and see if there is a way to negotiate a compromise that is mutually respectful.\n\nManuscript Feedback/Fiction & Memoir: If you have a completed manuscript where the structure is fairly straightforward, and you want feedback on the project, send me the first 50 pages double spaced in 12 pt font, and a synopsis. I will review your work and return it with a comprehensive assessment of the project. This process, including an initial conversation via phone or zoom, and a follow-up call, will take 6 hours. You also have the option of requesting an entire manuscript review up to 200 pages, which would be a 20 hour engagement including the initial call and two one hour follow up calls.\n\nCoaching: This is for those of you who want to excerpt stand-alone sections from a manuscript to send to journals and seek guidance on both the piece and the submissions, and for those who have a handful of stories or essays but need help shaping a manuscript. We will read your work aloud over zoom once a week, pausing along the way for comments regarding language and craft. We can get through a minimum of ten pages an hour. The process is best utilized with a longer time commitment over several months. The work we do together provides you with built-in deadlines, and the format gives you a cumulative benefit as you shape your project.\n\nPlease note: upfront payment is for first hour; number of hours and final cost to be discussed after registration.\n\nAll Genres\n\nI'm the NYT-bestselling author of eight books in a variety of genres, most recently Beowulf: A New Translation, and The Mere Wife. My reimagining of Vergil's Aeneid into a full-cast musical for Audible came out in 2023. I've taught at Sarah Lawrence and Bennington College, and as well as teaching dozens of masterclasses and workshops at universities around the world. For the Shipman Agency Workroom, I've taught workshops on finding your voice, adapting the classics into contemporary work, and editing yourself, among others. Over the twenty years or so since I sold my first book, I've often consulted with writers (some of whose names you'd know!), helping them develop projects from ideas to actualities, line-editing drafts, and giving intricate editorial feedback. I've done everything from full novel responses to inspiration sessions in which a writer tells me what they find intriguing, and we develop it together. Many people who've worked with me have felt that I helped equip them with the inspiration to begin believing in their projects. I want you to get what you need to go deeper in your work, and I'll help you find the right tools. That's my natural inclination no matter what the project.\n\nMy consultations are pretty flexible for that reason. I'm happy to work with people who don't have manuscripts yet, as long as they have a sense of something they're dreaming of writing, and some work samples so I can tell if we'll be a good fit. If you don't have a manuscript yet, we'll have a couple of video sessions to begin plotting a course, with research suggestions, creative brainstorming, and discussions of your personal map of inspirations. We'll make a plan that suits your workstyle. Typically, I meet on Zoom with writers twice a month in an ongoing development scenario, but we can work out a plan depending on what your project is - smaller projects, like short stories, may be more suited for written feedback.\n\nI charge hourly because I want you to have the flexibility to choose the engagement - and because I'm available to work on many different kinds of projects, in a variety of different ways.\n\nAs a writer, I have experience in almost every corner of a storymaking career, whether it's nonfiction, fiction, scripts, translation, memoir, poetry - I've done it all. If I wasn't a writer for a living, I'd be an editor, because I love editing just as much as I love writing.\n\nMy style is both empathetic and pragmatic. I'll tell you what's great, what's wobbly, and what's not working - along with questions and suggestions for how to craft the piece you want to craft.\n\nRickey Laurentiis is offering tutorials and consultantships in the poem, the manuscript & the syllabus.\n\nRickey Laurentiis is a poet who was raised in New Orleans, Louisiana, to study light. Their debut book, Boy with Thorn, won the Cave Canem Poetry Prize, the Levis Reading Prize, and was a finalist for the Kate Tufts Discovery Award. As a curator and art writer, they have work with a number of institutions including The Andy Warhol Museum, the Carnegie Museum of Art, John Hopkins Archaeological Museum, and the the Museum of Modern Art in New York. Their next book is Death of the First Idea, coming froom Knopf in 2025. Literary honors include fellowships from the Lannan Literary Foundation, the National Endowment for the Arts, the Poetry Foundation, the Whiting Foundation, and the Center for African American Poetry and Poetics at the University of Pittsburgh. Friends call her Riis.\n\nIn private consultantships, I will work one-one-one in periods of an hour or more in three subjects: individual tutorials concerning packets of poems (no more than 15 pages of work) & full consultantships on the poetry manuscript (no more than 60 pages of work) and writing syllabi (including poetry, fiction and nonfiction courses). In my tutorials and consultantships, I aim to listen carefully; to hear what lives under the ask towards what’s best for the piece of writing at hand or the course being developed. I want the tutor or client to leave feeling restored to their assignment as writer, and with specific tactics to apply to their writing in its general improvement, and specific strategies to apply in the classroom.\n\nTutorials, 1 hour, $150\n\nConsultantships 1.5hr or more, starting at $500\n\nFiction, Nonfiction\n\nSarah Manguso is the author of nine books of fiction, nonfiction, and poetry. Her books are frequently described as crossing, blurring, or reinventing genres.\n\nShe has taught creative writing for more than twenty years, both privately and at various institutions of higher learning, and she would welcome the opportunity to work with you on a manuscript of fiction or nonfiction.\n\nTo receive an estimate, please register and pay the initial $250 for one hour of work. Sarah will provide notes and line edits on the first few pages of your manuscript, along with an estimate for the full job.\n\nHer rate is $250/hr, and her minimum fee is $1250.\n\nSarah’s fee includes detailed line edits and notes on all aspects of the work, which will be provided via Track Changes. Sarah will then be available for a discussion via phone or Zoom.\n\nPlease note that upfront payment is for one hour of work plus preparation of an estimate for the full project. Additional hours will be invoiced and paid after registration.\n\nAX (Ana) Mina\n\nAs a nonfiction writer, you have great ideas. How do you get the word out and build a platform? I offer coaching as a tool to help you refine your ideas, communicate them effectively and find the right people to support your work.\n\nYou have great thoughts to share — how do you communicate them crisply and precisely for public consumption? Think of thought leadership as a layer that supercharges your communications efforts. Building from my experience developing communications strategy, we’ll develop a custom strategy for getting the word out there about your work and your best ideas.\n\nEvery writing client has different needs, and we’ll work on a toolkit that will help you take action on bringing your ikigai, or life’s purpose, into fruition through guided exercises on a tool called Quenza and ongoing coaching sessions. Here’s an example of some of the tools we can explore together:\n\nBrainstorming and ideation sessions — start with your idea, no matter how rough, and let’s refine it through active feedback and idea generation\n\nWorking through creative blocks, using creative strategy and ideation, meditation, yoga, tarot and somatic wellness practices (I’m a certified trauma-informed yoga teacher with training in secular mindfulness)\n\nGetting the word out: Public speaking skills, and telling the story of yourself and your work\n\nLeadership and management skills, whether for those leading creative communities and mission-driven organizations or those running their own business.\n\nClarifying your core values and mission as a writer (i.e., your ikigai)\n\nCoaching is a partnership, and I’m happy to take a first 30 minute call for free to determine two things: (1) how we vibe together as people and creative and (2) whether there’s a fit with what you’re looking for and where I can help. If we mutually agree to move forward, we’ll develop a coaching package that works for you — whether that’s finding your ikigai, developing your platform or something more custom. We can also do ad hoc, ongoing coaching to help you work through creative blocks.\n\nSessions are a sliding scale of $125-200 for up to 75 minutes (with a suggested rate of $150), and a 5 pack is available for $500 - 800 (20% discount).\n\nThis manuscript consultation is intended to find the essential strengths of your project—the places where the writing comes alive—and identify the aspects of your novel-in-progress that give you joy. From here, we will discuss ways to complete the book, bring out its inherent qualities, and to follow your own voice in the process.\n\nAfter an initial one-hour conversation, where we discuss your vision and the areas you would like to tackle, I will read the manuscript and offer a detailed editorial letter, notes throughout the manuscript, and 5-10 pages of in-depth line edits. In my letter, I will focus on plot elements, character development, structure, and voice. We will meet again for an hour-long call to discuss my notes and come up with a revision plan that feels manageable and right for the book.\n\nI will also offer guidance about querying agents, and the editorial process.\n\nI have led novel writing workshops as well as individual consultations for the past five years and love to collaborate with writers to find the unique qualities of their projects and help them finish their books with enthusiasm (and patience!)\n\nWriters work alone and in the dark. The process of crafting a piece of writing that generates meaning and emotion, a work capable of nothing less than dreaming the reader into a world entirely of the writer’s making, is a daunting task. For as vast and mysterious as the levers of the writer’s imagination may be, the only tools at the writer’s disposal are paltry. Something to write with and something to write on. The only other thing the writer requires is a reader. Someone to witness the work and offer feedback. Inevitably, regardless of the quality of that feedback, the writer is dissatisfied. The writer suspects and rightly so, that there are issues. There are always issues, and the writer, regardless of how skilled they may be, cannot see them. They know this, and it’s maddening. Sometimes the issues are related to craft. The structure isn’t helping the story tell itself. The pacing is out of whack. The point of view is fuzzy. Other times the problem isn’t on the page but in the writer themselves. They don’t what the story is or why they’re telling it. They can’t recognize what is most alive in their work. If you find yourself in such a place, I offer my help. For years I have been helping writers in just this way. Helping them to locate the beating heart in their stories and strategize solutions for revision that work in the direction of their strengths.\n\nYou have several options.\n\nOption1.\n\nYou receive notes on the text: (queries, comments and suggested edits) an editorial letter and an hour-long conference via Zoom/FaceTime/telephone to discuss the work’s strengths and weaknesses, big picture issues and avenues to pursue in revision. $450\n\nOption 2.\n\nYou receive an editorial letter, and an hour-long conference via Zoom/FaceTime/telephone to discuss the work’s strengths and weaknesses, big picture issues and avenues to pursue in revision. $350\n\nOption 3.\n\nYour manuscript is returned to you with margin notes and an editorial letter addressing matters of craft. $250.\n\nOption 4.\n\nAn hour-long conference via Zoom/FaceTime/telephone to discuss the work’s strengths and weaknesses, big picture issues and avenues to pursue in revision. $250\n\nMy rates are based on twenty, double-spaced, twelve-point type pages, or $250 an hour for longer works.\n\n$250/hour\n\nWriters have less editorial time with their in-house editors than ever. Many agents are great with the deal but simply aren't editors. Where is a writer to turn?\n\nFor thirty years I've worked with literary writers in various capacities but my great love has been the deep dive into a manuscript with them. While I always keep an eye toward what a reader might think, I maintain deep respect for the integrity of work that is formally challenging, based in vernacular, or otherwise considered non-traditional. I will work with literary writers in both fiction and non-fiction.\n\nWe'd begin, ideally, with the review of a complete manuscript though writers \"in process\" are welcome to set up other arrangements. You'll receive notes with a focus on how the draft as a whole works rather than the nitty gritty of a line edit. We'll then set a schedule for the rewrite and can review in sections or as a whole. The second draft may be the place we agree to do a line edit. Ideally, the response to that draft allows us to look at ahead at publishing possibilities.\n\nHaving worked \"inside\" the industry, I will provide counsel on next steps when we're done i.e. referrals can be made to agents; we can work together on an excerpt for a magazine or journal. Ongoing coaching and career consultation can be provided whether you're an editorial client or not. Non-editorial clients must commit to a minimum number of hours to be determined.\n\nFees are $250 per hour for both editorial and career consultation services. Writers must commit to a minimum number of hours, to be determined. Accommodations made for monthly retainer clients.\n\nPlease note: upfront payment is for first hour; number of hours and final cost to be discussed after registration.\n\nMeredith Talusan\n\nI accept students on an ongoing basis for private editorial and writing career consultations. As someone with a fiction MFA degree from Cornell and who has published memoir, personal essay, and criticism, and is currently working on a novel, I am uniquely qualified to address a range of prose writing concerns that are specific to the individual writer. I was also the founding executive editor of them., Condé Nast's LGBTQ+ platform, and have an extensive network of contacts across the media and publishing industries. I am always happy to connect former students to industry professionals when I feel that their projects are ready, and have successfully done so for a number of former students.\n\nI only work with people who I feel I can substantially help, so please provide a work sample of up to 15 pages for review. The fee for a complete manuscript review and 2 hour-long editorial feedback sessions is $1,200 for projects up to 60k words and $1,500 for those up to 90k words.\n\nI am deeply committed to giving people from historically marginalized groups more access to writing and publishing channels. If you are from a marginalized community and can't afford my fee, I would charge on a sliding scale of $750-$1,200 depending on the length of the project and the financial status of the student.\n\nPlease note: initial payment isn’t final fee; final fees will be discussed after registration. The balance will be invoiced separately.\n\n“Greg’s approach to teaching and mentorship is representative of who he is as a whole: thoughtful, compassionate, insightful, honest, and humorous. I’ve benefited from one-on-one sessions with him and have also taken part in a seminar that he led. In each setting, Greg excelled at providing his students with the individualized counsel that an aspiring writer can only hope for. He provides equal parts praise, guidance, and compassionate critique in a way that encourages his students to harness and unleash their own creative prowess.\"\n\n- Clay Klaus-Wade\n\n\"Greg is a fantastic teacher. He is encouraging, specific in his teachings and an effective communicator. He clearly loves to teach and to share his knowledge. He always involves the student and simultaneously emboldens the student to craft their own style. He creates a safe space for each student to ask questions, to test their own theories and assumptions.\"\n\n- Buffy Shutt\n\nHi! Thanks for your interest in learning with me. A little bit about myself: I am the author of the memoir, Born to Be Public, which has been named a best book of 2020 by NPR, O, The Oprah Magazine, Electric Literature, The Brooklyn Rail, Largehearted Boy, and was a 2020 Goodreads Choice Award Nominee for Best Humor. I am currently working on my next memoir, Not a Wonderland: Dispatches From a Body That's Trying to Kill Me, and Save Our Serotonin: An Illustrated Guide for the Modern and Mentally Ill.\n\nMy teaching philosophy is pretty simple: If you care about your story, someone else will, too. My job—and joy—is to help my students hone their craft by looking inward. Because only by looking inward can you learn to write about the way you move through the world. I'm not here to teach as much as I am to hold up a mirror and help you mine your reflection for the things you might not have noticed before or hadn't thought to consider in one way or another—all of the things that make up the fabric of your being, the things that should be radically honored both on and off the page.\n\nThis consultation will begin with an initial hour-long meeting and conversation about your work-in-progress. I want to hear about why you started writing your project, and where you imagine it going. I want to know why your project matters to you. We will also discuss any concerns or challenges you face, as well as what you want to achieve by the time you finish your final draft.\n\nFollowing our conversation, I will then give line-by-line edits, along with detailed editorial notes on your work-in-progress. This can include a nonfiction manuscript, book proposal, book chapters, query letter, essay(s), article(s), work samples, or any other form of nonfiction prose.\n\nPrice breakdown: $200 flat fee for the first 20 pages (12-point Times New Roman font, double-spaced, and one-inch margins), and $3 for every page after that.\n\nA la carte option: For a manuscript consultation that includes a letter with detailed editorial feedback, but no line-by-line edits, the flat fee is $150 for the first 20 pages (12-point Times New Roman font, double-spaced, and one-inch margins), and $3 for every page after that.\n\nPlease note: Payment is for the initial flat fee. Additional page fees to be determined and invoiced separately.\n\nI look forward to working—and learning—with you!"
