The world of these stories is Portuguese-American, redolent of incense and spices, resonant with ritual and prayer, immersed in the California culture of freeway and commerce. Packed with lyrical prose and vivid detail, acclaimed writer Katherine Vaz conjures a captivating blend of Old World heritage and New World culture to explore the links between families, friends, strangers, and their world. From the threat of a serial killer as the background for a young girl’s first brush with death to the fallout of a modern-day visitation from the Virgin Mary; from an AIDS-stricken squatter refusing to vacate an empty Lisbon home to a mother’s yearlong struggle with the death of her synesthetic daughter, these deft stories make their world ours.\n\nhttp://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0803217900/?tag=2022091-20\n\nMariana\n\n(This novel is based upon the true story of Mariana Alcofo...)\n\nThis novel is based upon the true story of Mariana Alcoforado, sent to a convent during Portugal's revolt against Spain in the seventeenth century, where she conducts an all-consuming love affair with a French cavalry officer. After being abandoned, she writes him a series of passionate love letters--translated and included here--that become famous throughout Europe during her lifetime, and thereafter. Artists from the poet Rilke and the novelist Stendhal to the painters Matisse and Modigliani have made her one of the world's great romantic icons.\n\nhttp://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0970765290/?tag=2022091-20\n\nMariana\n\n(This novel is based upon the true story of Mariana Alcofo...)\n\nThis novel is based upon the true story of Mariana Alcoforado, sent to a convent during Portugal's revolt against Spain in the seventeenth century, where she conducts an all-consuming love affair with a French cavalry officer.
