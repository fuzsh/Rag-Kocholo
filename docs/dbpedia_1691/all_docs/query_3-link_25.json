Literally, what propels the narrative? My latest novel, What A Mother Knows, is a textbook example of the importance of narrative drive in today’s fiction marketplace.\n\nIn this article I’d like to talk about three techniques that turned my novel from a work of literature sitting on the shelf to a real page-turner that sold to a major publisher. Those techniques are:\n\n1. Figuring out the right genres through which to tell the story\n\n2. Breaking the story down into a scene list so that each scene is necessary and builds on the scenes that came before\n\n3. Sequencing the reveals so the story picks up speed as it approaches the end\n\nWhat A Mother Knows started out as a literary masterpiece – or so I thought. I wrote it twenty pages at a time for my thesis project when I earned my MFA. The story is about a woman who wakes up from a deadly car accident only to find she is accused of murder and her daughter, the only one who knows what happened, is gone. It was fun playing with the prose, and the lead character was a very different person before and after the accident. So I devised two story lines that alternated between past and present until they met up at the end.\n\nThe result was dark and angsty with fun flips of point of view, and I loved it. But my writer friends had trouble remembering the details from one storyline to the next. My agent wasn’t overwhelmed with it either. So I put it aside to write a quick commercial novel, Wife Goes On, which I sold from the outline along with a screenplay on the same concept. But I couldn’t let go of this story. So I decided to rewrite it with intense narrative drive to make it more exciting and more accessible to readers and publishers – a marriage of commercial and literary fiction.\n\nThe first technique was figuring out the right genres with which to tell the story, since genre has more effect on narrative drive than any other decision you make. There are a lot of elements that tell you the best genres for your particular story, but the first one I look for is the desire line of the hero. My hero’s main goal was to uncover a mystery: this woman was desperate to find her daughter and to discover what really happened that fateful day. That meant my novel was primarily a detective story. She also had everything to risk, which made it a thriller. And the story was set within the family, which added family drama as well.\n\nTime for the wrecking ball. I started by smashing the story apart to make a new scene list, because the scene list is the clearest view of the architecture of the story. With the scene list, the bones of the novel are not hidden behind description and dialogue.\n\nThen I put the scenes in the proper structural order. The main story had to be a present time page-turner of a woman relentlessly chasing her goal. I combined past scenes that had the same character having a revelation and used flashbacks only to help the character take action in the present. By reordering, combining, and eliminating scenes that didn’t support the goal, the story got stronger. Each character’s motivation was clearer, so the plot got thicker.\n\nBut there was still one more step to accomplish. Especially in a detective story, the revelations need to build and come at a progressively faster pace. So I constructed a revelation sequence, a list of every reveal in the story. I was able to change the order of revelations so they got bigger and came faster. Boom, boom, boom!\n\nI thought I was all done. But making the sale always has detours where you have to be able to adjust. My agent loved the new story but asked me to develop the medical and legal themes. So I revised it again. Sure enough, my agent sold the book.\n\nBut my new editor asked me to take out 100 pages. Of course, you can’t just lop off 100 pages of a tightly woven tale, so I went back to the wrecking ball and broke it down, scene by scene, one more time. Again, I made a list of the revelations, to make sure the narrative drive was as intense as it could be. The editor loved the book.\n\nWriters are fond of saying, “Writing is rewriting.” Wrong. Writing is rewriting with a plan, and that plan is all about increasing narrative drive. Ask any book agent; it’s what sells your novel."
