        "text": "The bride wore white. The groom wore Kermit the Frog.\n\nThe smiling face of the green amphibian dotted Christopher Bennett Cerf’s tie, as he stood next to Katherine Anne Vaz while their marriage rite was read to them in the leaf-strewn garden behind the townhouse they share on the Upper East Side of Manhattan.\n\nAs each word was pronounced, Mr. Cerf’s smile seemed to inch wider, competing with the Muppet’s for biggest grin. Next to him Ms. Vaz listened intently as their friend, the former editor and publisher of The Nation magazine Victor Navasky, led the ceremony with the assistance of Emily Jane Goodman, a former justice of State Supreme Court in Manhattan. As the proceedings moved along, the bride’s patchwork, tea-length wedding dress swayed slightly in the breeze.\n\n“Christopher asked me to be funny,” said Mr. Navasky, who had been ordained by the Church of Spiritual Humanism previously to officiate his daughter’s wedding. “Katherine asked me to be serious,” he said. “Sounds to me like they are already married.”\n\nThe Sunday morning ceremony was the culmination of a relationship built on fun, as filled with jokes, pranks and humor as are the bookshelves in their home on East 62nd Street.\n\nThough neither has children, their library, in which the guests clustered before the ceremony outdoors, could be the envy of any toddler: filled with picture books featuring creatures like the rapscallion Cat in the Hat and the benevolent Big Bird.\n\nMr. Cerf, 73, is a son of the late Bennett Cerf, a founder of the publishing company Random House, which counted Theodor Seuss Geisel, better known as Dr. Seuss, as an early star author, and where the younger Mr. Cerf began his career working as an editor. His mother, Phyllis Cerf Wagner, worked closely with Mr. Geisel, but not always easily. In her obituary in The New York Times, Mr. Cerf said: “They had some disagreements which were memorable. They were both perfectionists and would argue about every comma that went on the page.”\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
