You can click the genres below to jump to the section or simply keep scrolling.\n\nChildren’s and Middle Grade books\n\nYA & NA fiction\n\nAdult fiction\n\nComics and Graphic Novels\n\nShort Stories / Flash Fiction\n\nAnthologies\n\nMislabeled as deaf characters\n\nTo Be Read List\n\nNote: This post will be updated as I read more books with deaf characters. Every book can easily be bumped up or down by a better representation. Make sure to subscribe for updates!\n\nNote 2: I do not rank poetry, plays, or baby books here. I do not rank stories whose deaf characters are animals, such as bats, dogs, cats, etc. Humanoid aliens or humanoid mythical creatures (e.g., centaurs or fairies) are okay. I do not rank stories and fanfics posted on sites (e.g., Wattpad and Ao3).\n\nThose of you who have been following me know that I, Leigh Ann, am deaf. Always have been and always will be! In May 2022 I earned a Master’s in Deaf Studies at Gallaudet University, where my thesis was analyzing representations of deafness in Marvel comics.\n\nBefore I get into my ranking, I want to make a few things clear:\n\nI only rank stories I have read in full.\n\nI am not ranking these stories based on plot or themes, but on the representation of deafness based on my own understandings (from firsthand experiences, stories written/recounted by other deaf individuals, and academic literature). No need to tell me that another deaf person has a different opinion. We are not required to share opinions.\n\nJust because a title ranks low on the list doesn’t necessarily mean the representation is bad; it may just be that the deaf character is in the background, so there’s not much to judge. In other words, how much “screentime” does the deaf character get?\n\nIf you are interested in reading any of these stories, please be aware that some of them may include triggering content such as violent acts (bullying, murder, etc.) and/or discrimination against marginalized-identity characters, which are very real concerns for many of us.\n\nTo be perfectly candid, I do not like the majority of the books on this list. You can find my rants and reviews on Goodreads, since I’m linking most titles to their Goodreads page. But my goal is to get past personality and plot to get at the representation itself: How well does the author reflect physiological and social realities of deafness? What message about the deafness are they trying to get across, if any?\n\nThis list includes human[oid] deaf characters no matter how brief their appearance or small their role in the story. If a deaf character explicitly appears—meaning that the author makes sure the reader somehow knows this character is deaf—I’ll include the story in the rank.\n\nIn these works of fiction there will be deaf characters who sign and those who don’t; those who lipread and those who don’t; those who use assistive hearing technology and those who don’t. There are also characters who identify as culturally Deaf, and others who may use identities such as deaf, hearing impaired, hard of hearing, and deaf-mute (this last term is in older/historical and non-American novels). These are all valid identities, and the author/characters’ identity preferences do not affect how I rank the book (unless it is used incorrectly, such as a contemporary American author using “deaf-mute”).\n\nThe key here is authenticity. For deaf-identifying authors, that’s simple enough. They write what they know. But for hearing authors, I am also judging their acknowledgment (or lack thereof) of deaf sensitivity readers or advisers. Did they do their research? Some hearing authors make it more obvious than others whether they incorporate feedback.\n\nNow, without further ado, let’s get into the ranking.\n\nChildren’s and Middle Grade Books\n\n1. Show Me a Sign by Ann Clare LeZotte (2020)\n\nWritten by a Deaf librarian, this middle grade historical fiction is set on Martha’s Vineyard. It was once a thriving deaf community, thanks to genetics. The white colonists inhabiting this island developed their own language, much of which merged later with French Sign Language to become what is today known as American Sign Language (ASL). Historically, people like Alexander Graham Bell believed that the deafness on Martha’s Vineyard was caused by something in the soil or water (which somehow didn’t affect everyone, regardless of race, age, or gender). Scientists ran experiments on the land and its deaf inhabitants, which is also what happens in this novel: an entitled young man shows up to “discover” the cause of the prevalent deafness—and kidnaps the narrator, a young deaf girl. This is a great slice of history that shows disability is a social construct.\n\n2. A Handful of Spells by Kimberley A. Shaw (2013)\n\nThis book by a hard of hearing author is the deafie version of Harry Potter, starring 11 year old witch Cait, who is hard of hearing. Overall, the descriptions of Cait’s hearing and the assistive hearing technology are accurate. I do discuss a couple of things I wish had been address in more detail in my Goodreads review. It’s a cute story, and I enjoyed it.\n\n3. Apple Is My Sign by Mary Riskind (1981)\n\nRiskind, a child of deaf adults (CODA), writes multiple complex characters (deaf and hearing) who have growth. We get a historical glimpse into a boy’s life at home with a deaf family as well as what it’s like for him at a deaf institute/school.\n\n4. Wonderstruck by Brian Selznick (2011)\n\nSelznick’s brother was born deaf in one ear, and provided insights for the main character Ben. Drs. Carol Padden and Tom Humphries were sensitivity readers, in addition to the author taking interviews, feedback, etc. from other deaf people and visiting museums and reading up on histories. So I’m happy to say that I did not spot any inaccuracies as far as deafness went in this middle grade book! Also interesting is the decision to tell Ben’s stories in prose and Rose’s story in pictures. I was skeptical at first, but it works out very well.\n\n5. Song for a Whale by Lynne Kelly (2019)\n\nWritten by an ASL interpreter, this middle grade novel centers Iris, a deaf girl who is moved to a mainstream (hearing) school where she is linguistically and socially isolated. The interesting part of this novel is that Iris comes from a deaf family: her grandparents are deaf. In science class, Iris learns about a lonely whale and determines that she will play him a song he can hear. Accompanied by her grandmother, she sets out on her mission. I’ve written a book recommendation for this, which you can read here.\n\n6. You Don’t Know Everything, Jilly P! by Alex Gino (2018)\n\nWhat I really appreciate about this middle grade book is the candidness of the hearing author, who is a grandchild of Deaf adults. It’s a real rarity that I read a book with a deaf character and don’t find anything to criticize. Gino approached this story very carefully and respectfully. Although they chose to center a white hearing girl, the Black Deaf character, Derek, is very realistic. The other deaf character, Emma, is an infant and doesn’t really do much—so, like a baby, yeah?—but we do get a time skip epilog that shows a toddler Emma being very communicative and innovative!\n\n7. Hurt Go Happy by Ginny Rorby (2006)\n\nThis middle grade book by a hearing author who did her research and had a sensitivity reader portrays Joey, a young deaf girl who befriends a signing chimpanzee and kicks off her journey into Deafhood. Overall, this is a good representation of a deaf character, although it is confusing at a few points, which I detail in my Goodreads review.\n\n8. Max and the Millions by Ross Montgomery (2018)\n\nThis fantasy features a deaf boy named Max, who wears bilateral hearing aids. Montgomery had consultants and sensitivity readers, so Max is overall an excellent deaf representation, minus my issue with the hearing aids. My Goodreads review goes into details.\n\n9. Hello, Universe by Erin Entrada Kelly (2017)\n\nAll in all, this representation of an 11 year old mainstreamed deaf girl named Valencia is cute and accurate to the deaf experience. It definitely helps that the hearing author worked with Gina Oliva for this novel. My only complaint is that Valencia’s POV is written in first person, whereas the hearing characters are all written in third.\n\n10. Feathers by Jacqueline Woodson (2007)\n\nThis children’s book shows us, through the eyes of a Black hearing girl named Frannie, how communities intersect and impact each other. The deaf character is Frannie’s older brother Sean, who is intelligent, independent, and funny. Read an interview with the author here!\n\n11. The Unbeatable Squirrel Girl: Squirrel Meets World by Shannon Hale and Dean Hale (2017)\n\nThis quirky middle grade Marvel title features Ana Sofía Arcos Romero, a mainstreamed ninth grader who wears bilateral hearing aids. She educates Doreen (and the reader) on lipreading and signed language throughout the book. But it’s not perfect. If you’re interested in the issues I took with this novel, check my Goodreads review for details.\n\n12. The Orange Houses by Paul Griffin (2009)\n\nWritten by a presumably hearing author, this novel features a Black deaf girl named Tamika (Mik). She was deafened by meningitis at age five, and diagnosed with moderately severe hearing loss, or “halfway to sound.” Overall, Griffin showcases a lot of technical knowledge, but misses details that would bring the deaf experience to life. Details in my Goodreads review.\n\n13. The Mermaid’s Three Wisdoms by Jane Yolen (1978)\n\nHere’s a fairy tale by a hearing author. She acknowledges several deaf persons for their help in representing Jess. In this story we have two protagonists: Jess, a deaf girl, and Melusina, a mermaid. Mermaids have no speech apparatus, having evolved with no need of it, so they developed a signed language. Jess, who is understandably angry at the world and rejects all languages (spoken and signed) because she doesn’t have full access, rescues Melusina when she is banished from her home. Yolen does well in showing the cultural differences in the two signed languages and how the girls try to navigate towards a common understanding. Jess and Melusina begin to learn one another’s language. At the end of the story, we have a very explicit Deaf Gain message: If Jess hadn’t been deaf, she wouldn’t have learned sign language, and therefore would have been unable to communicate with Melusina. It doesn’t hold up logically (in that hearing people can also sign), but the representation is fairly accurate throughout, and given the year of its publication, very positive.\n\n14. A Season of Change by Lois L. Hodge (1987)\n\nThis children’s book by an author with Usher Syndrome follows an orally raised deaf girl. It’s not necessarily the representation I had a problem with, as it is fairly accurate, but rather lesson of the character. Check my Goodreads review for details.\n\n15. Six by M. M. Vaughan (2015)\n\nThis middle grade sci-fi mystery novel by a hearing author portrays Emma, a deaf 10 year old with a bent toward social justice. Emma was born with a damaged auditory nerve, so she’s never heard a sound. The communication in this novel really points to the linguistic repertoire of this character. Emma signs (ASL and BSL), lipreads, reads and writes English, and projects her thoughts telepathically. Although this is definitely one of the better representations I’ve seen, it’s not perfect! Check out my Goodreads review for details.\n\n16. Ruby Lu, Empress of Everything by Lenore Look (2006)\n\nDeafened at four from head trauma, Flying Duck, who is now about 8 years old, can speak and lipread Cantonese as well as some English, and signs Chinese Sign Language. Not much English, even though she’s now mainstreamed in the US with no accommodations. No wonder she’s failing! Flying Duck actually doesn’t feature very much in the book. My Goodreads review goes into more detail.\n\n17. The Ship of the Dead (Magnus Chase and the Gods of Asgard #3) by Rick Riordan (2017)\n\nThis is book three of the trilogy, and the best of the three. Riordan proves that it is never too late to improve. He finally got some feedback on this and put some effort into writing not only Hearth, but also how the other characters interact with Hearth. For details, refer to my Goodreads review.\n\n18. The Tale of Despereaux by Kate DiCamillo (2008)\n\nThis children’s fantasy novel shows a very realistic description of gradual hearing loss as a result of abuse, but as the story goes on, DiCamillo loses the thread, and Mig’s deafness becomes increasingly unbelievable. For more details, here’s my Goodreads review.\n\n19. Jessi’s Secret Language (The Baby-Sitter’s Club #16) by Ann M. Martin (1996)\n\nFirst of all, although the white hearing author terms the signed language used throughout this book Ameslan (an older term for ASL), the characters are actually using sim-commed SEE (Signed Exact English)—but even having noted that, some sign descriptions are way off/nonexistent. This story isn’t about the deaf boy, Matt, but about the narrator, Jessi, who co-opts Ameslan and spreads it to the neighboring hearing children as a secret code that they use to be mean to one another, then turns around and puts together a special interpreted ballet for a select few deaf children so the hearing readers get their dose of inspoporn. For an explanation for this cynicism, head on over to my Goodreads essay—the first time I actually ran out of characters!\n\n20. The Hammer of Thor (Magnus Chase and the Gods of Asgard #2) by Rick Riordan (2016)\n\nThis is book two of the trilogy, and is only marginally better than the first. The signing is still awful, and the inconsistent speaking-then-signing-then-speaking to the deaf character is grating. Refer to my Goodreads review for details.\n\n21. The Sword of Summer (Magnus Chase and the Gods of Asgard #1) by Rick Riordan (2015)\n\nThis is book one of the trilogy, and the worst of the three. Riordan’s “ASL” is beyond atrocious, and the way he writes, through Magnus’s narrations of Hearth, can even get downright offensive. As there is too much to hash out here, refer to my Goodreads review for details.\n\n22. Of Sound Mind by Jean Ferris (2001)\n\nThis book makes clear why Ferris didn’t cut it as an audiologist. She fundamentally misunderstands how deaf people and deaf families live, from use of technologies like TTYs and television captions, to signed language and bilingualism, to family dynamics. I go into depth in my Goodreads review.\n\n23. The Guardian’s Code by T.S. Valmond (2018)\n\nThis fantasy/sci-fi story follows Zehra, the first congenitally deaf mermaid, and her journey to becoming a guardian. Unfortunately, the worldbuilding is so weak that I do not believe Zehra could possibly exist as she does. My Goodreads rant has all the details.\n\n24. Dovey Coe by Frances O’Roark Dowell (2000)\n\nThis deaf character, 13 year old Amos, participates in what I call the illusion of inclusion. He can apparently understand everything happening around him, but does not have the ability to actually express himself—his sister just assumes she knows what he is thinking and feeling. Overall, a messy representation. My Goodreads review goes more in depth.\n\n25. A Single Light by Maia Wojciechowska (1968)\n\nThis entire book, written for children, is nothing but ableist tripe, offensive stereotypes, and inspiration porn, so unsurprisingly it has won the Newbery Medal. I was disgusted for the entire read. My Goodreads review contains details on why it’s not worth reading this book.\n\n26. Sidekicked by John David Anderson (2013)\n\nA hearing author really did this deaf character dirty. Eric Ito, deaf since birth, seems to have super speed and is an expert in martial arts, though it’s unclear what exactly he does. His real power, however, should be lipreading. This deaf boy is attending a mainstream school, apparently with no interpreter despite the fact that he only signs, and is literally not included in his team’s conversations (though the author tries to play it off like he’s included). The author also doesn’t even try to make the signing realistic. For more details on why this representation is so poorly done, check out my Goodreads review. It’s also worth noting that Eric rarely appears in the story.\n\n27. The Ghost Next Door by R. L. Stine (1993)\n\nMrs. Anderson is a sort of blink-and-you’ll-miss-it character. She hides her deafness so as not to be pitied, and she can apparently pass as hearing through lipreading—an incredible feat for a totally deaf person who has only been deaf for a couple of years. Incredible, as in it, doesn’t add up. Not much else to say!\n\n28. The Loser’s Guide to Life and Love by Ann Edwards Cannon (2008)\n\nAbout 3/4th of the way through this story, Ed gets punched in the ear, which rapidly goes deaf. There’s no mention of it improving, but also no mention of continued issues like pain or difficulty hearing or understanding.\n\nYA and NA\n\n1. True Biz by Sara Nović (2022)\n\nThis novel, written by a deaf author who uses cochlear implants, features a variety of perspectives, sensory orientations, and languages. It’s written in a way that isn’t a deaf protagonist teaching a hearing protagonist and leading them by the hand as many stories are, so that’s refreshing. A hearing reader will learn alongside Charlie, and a deaf reader will nod sagely along, their language and culture affirmed. True Biz is a teaching tool, but it’s not overbearing or intrusive.\n\n2. Deeplight by Frances Hardinge (2019)\n\nThis dark fantasy YA story is written by a hearing author, but the deaf representation is so well-done that if I hadn’t checked, I might have believed Hardinge were deaf. This is because Hardinge had tons of help from the Young People’s Advisory Board of the National Deaf Children’s Society. In Deeplight, all kinds of deaf people appear—though all, to my knowledge, are late-deafened. (This means that they grew up hearing, and became deaf later.) In this book, there are signing deaf (with each island having its own dialect), and non-signing deaf who communicate in writing. Some lipread, like Selphin. None are really main characters, although Selphin has a large and important role, but they are very visible and highly respected throughout the story. In short, this book normalizes and even celebrates deafness.\n\n3. The Words in My Hands by Asphyxia (2020)\n\nA visually stunning novel written and illustrated by a Deaf author. Taking place in a dystopian future where starvation is a risk, a high school student blooms as she discovers her Deaf identity, falls in love, and brings her community together to plant a garden. No complaints!\n\n4. The Sign for Home by Blair Fell (2022)\n\nWritten by an ASL interpreter who did his research, this drama features a DeafBlind character, Arlo, a refreshingly excellent representation. Fell also makes an interesting narrative choice by writing Arlo’s parts in 2nd POV (using “you” rather than “he” or “I”).\n\n5. The Silence Between Us by Alison Gervais (2019)\n\nThis book is for a YA audience, and written by a Hard of Hearing author, who represents the experiences of a deaf girl in mainstream (hearing) school. Through her character Maya, Gervais very realistically shows how deaf people might navigate a hearing environment and react to barriers and discrimination in and out of school. The emotions and reactions throughout the novel are very authentic. I will say that Gervais’ choice to gloss reduces the ASL to broken English, which is highly unfortunate. I’m fluent in English and ASL, and I found the gloss difficult to understand because it is divorced from the context of its grammar. From the reviews by hearing people it seems most readers do not have a problem with it, but I worry how non-signing readers are forming understandings of ASL based on this glossed dialog.\n\nNote: This novel also includes a boy with Cystic Fibrosis (CF), but this character fails to pass the dog replacement test. You can replace Connor with a dog, and it does not impact the story in a meaningful way. Essentially, Connor is included as a plot device, and the narrative surrounding him is very inspiration porn-heavy.\n\n6. Sugaring Off by Gillian French (2022)\n\nThere’s no mention of the author being deaf or of having sensitivity readers. But either Owl’s deafness is based off herself or someone the author knows or she really did her research. Color me impressed. The only thing that really stood out was Owl’s unrealistic ability to speechread 100% of speech whenever she wanted to. Details in my Goodreads review.\n\n7. Andromeda Klein by Frank Portman (2009)\n\nOverall, this is a fairly accurate portrayal of a high school girl with deafness caused by osteogenesis imperfecta. There are a few issues with Portman taking the “mishearing” things too far, and some inconsistencies with how Andromeda understands music. My Goodreads review has more detail on these points.\n\n8. This Is Kind of an Epic Love Story by Kacen Callender (2018)\n\nThis hearing author writes a YA romance that casts Oliver, deaf since ten years old, in the role of the love interest. Oliver can’t lipread to save his life, which is highly refreshing given the number of deaf characters who can read everything they see. Callender also chooses to describe signs rather than translate or gloss them, but it was a little difficult to follow at times. Overall, an accurate and respectful representation.\n\n9. Rules for Vanishing by Kate Alice Marshall (2019)\n\nThis surrealist YA horror/thriller is written by a hearing author, whose deaf character Jeremy (of the jock variety) wears hearing aids. I didn’t see any misrepresentation during my reading of this. This is also one of the few deaf characters I like personality-wise, so that’s a plus. My Goodreads review discusses a little more in-depth about what I liked.\n\n10. A Quiet Kind of Thunder by Sara Barnard (2017)\n\nOverall, this representation of a deaf character is patchy. The hearing author of this YA thanks two sensitivity readers (one BSL interpreter, one deaf reader) for Deaf culture and BSL, and another person for their “handy” puns, but as I read this book, I kept getting the sense that Barnard doesn’t “get it.” My Goodreads review explains in detail.\n\n11. Beauty Queens by Libba Bray (2011)\n\nOverall, well done, with a few hiccups here and there. The deaf character is Sosie, who identifies as hearing impaired and uses a signed language (ASL? Signed English? Not clear.) I wish there had been a bit more depth to Sosie’s character, but I do appreciate the effort to not only get the deafness aspect right, but to give her a personality other than “deaf.” I go into detail in my Goodreads review.\n\n12. Waiting for a Sign by Etsy Schachter (2014)\n\nThis is a literary fiction book by a hearing author who worked for three years as a secretary at the Massachusetts State Association of the Deaf. She thanks quite a lot of readers for their help, but it’s not clear whether they are deaf. The narrator is a hearing girl, a sibling of a deaf adult (SODA), with a hearing savior complex. This book is a little odd and disjointed because the author wanted to write two stories at the same time, but as far the deaf representation goes, I feel a little…meh. The deaf representation is through a hearing girl’s perspective, so although she intellectually understands some of the issues, she doesn’t understand them emotionally. In fact, none of the issues surrounding the treatment of deaf characters in this novel are ever resolved, or even critically examined. I have to link my Goodreads review to explain my visceral reaction to it. The representation isn’t necessarily bad; it just feels icky often because it’s colored by a hearing writer’s ignorance.\n\n13. You’re Welcome, Universe by Whitney Gardner (2017)\n\nAnother YA novel, this one by a hearing author who mentions several deaf sensitivity readers—and yet the book has quite a few inaccuracies. (Principals of deaf schools actually aren’t required to sign fluently, and I can’t name a single deaf person who feels the shitty caption devices at cinemas are a superpower. Yikes.) Despite the mistakes in representation, the reason this ranks higher than some is because it has a lot more representation. There are several deaf characters, including the protagonist, her friend, and her two mothers. For the most part, the representation is authentic, but it would have been nice if these characters were more fleshed out.\n\n14. Invincible Summer by Hannah Moskowitz (2011)\n\nHere’s a YA literary fiction. This hearing author hopes to make the Deaf communities of Washington, D.C. and Providence, R.I. proud with this representation of a six-year-old deaf boy named Gideon, but I admit it definitely triggered me. You could probably tell from my ranting Goodreads review. The novel is from the perspective of a SODA, who doesn’t seem to realize or care about Gideon’s needs or wants, which unfortunately is very common. As far as the deaf representation goes, this is pretty accurate: a deaf child literally just existing in a family that does not want to communicate.\n\n15. 27 Hours by Tristina Wright (2017)\n\nThis hearing author writes a pretty accurate Deaf character in this YA novel about colonizers “discovering” the indigenous are intelligent and cultured. Nyx has rechargeable hearing aids, gets sensory fatigue when straining to hear even with her hearing aids, and she signs with her abuela, who is also Deaf (they use a mix of ASL and home signs). There are a few problems with the representation, such as her love interest Dahlia being a poor signer at the beginning of the novel and within a few hours becoming an expert interpreter.\n\nNote: I would feel remiss if I didn’t inform potential readers of the serious problems with this novel. Aimal’s review touches on important themes, such as racism and colonialism, and discusses them in-depth without any major spoilers. Please consider reading it before picking up the book.\n\n16. St. Nacho’s by Z.A. Maxfield (2008)\n\nAll in all, this representation of a deaf gay character wasn’t bad, but there are some poorly written places in this gay erotica novel. My biggest complaint is that it’s not clear where the author’s [mis]understanding of deafness aligns with the narrator’s. Check out my Goodreads review for details.\n\n17. Talk Under Water by Kathryn Lomer (2015)\n\nA YA instalove story by a hearing author who cites multiple resources and deaf advisers, and yet can’t write a fleshed-out or dynamic deaf character. Although the physiological and social realities are fairly accurate, Summer (a teen deaf girl) is stagnant and boring. She exists so that the hearing character, Will, can learn and grow into a hearing savior figure. For a detailed discussion, see my Goodreads review.\n\n18. The Academy by Katie Sise (2018)\n\nThe hearing author had an audiologist who could answer questions about technical details but not a reader who could provide authentic identity and experience insights, and it shows. The cochlear implants are portrayed as curative devices that turn the deaf character, Jack, into a hearing character. More details in my Goodreads review.\n\n19. Little & Lion by Brandy Colbert (2017)\n\nWritten by a hearing author, this YA novel features a very diverse cast of characters–BIPOC, LGBTQIA+, disabled, etc. Emil Choi is not a main character, though he is a love interest to the narrator. He has Ménière’s disease, which makes him late-deafened, and he identifies as hard of hearing. He unabashedly wears hearing aids, and has been wearing them since a few months before the start of the novel. All of this is fantastic! Except the author seems to be confused about how hearing aids are worn and used. For specifics, check out my Goodreads review discussing them.\n\n20. Speechless by Adam P. Schmitt (2018)\n\nThis bildungsroman book, written by a hearing author with no mention of sensitivity readers, is an okay representation of a deaf character, Sofia (who’s 9 years old during the “present” of the storyline). She’s not featured much, but the author makes sure we are aware of her deafness whenever she shows up. I’ve noticed that Schmitt has an unfortunate tendency to infantilize Sofia. For specifics, check out my Goodreads review.\n\n21. Halloween Party (Fear Street #8) by R. L. Stine (1990)\n\nHere we have a YA thriller. Stine, a hearing author, writes a deaf teen named Niki. Unfortunately, her nickname is “Funny Face,” and it’s all the worse because we have no context or explanation for this. I can’t help but think a sensitivity reader would have been able to point this out to him. The representation itself is a bit muddy—Stine claims Niki is “nearly deaf,” but she seems to be totally deaf. For specifics, check out my Goodreads review.\n\n22. The Making of Yolanda la Bruja by Lorraine Avila (2023)\n\nThis is another one of those novels where I’m almost positive the deaf character started off as a hearing character, but then the author made a last-minute decision to make them deaf and went back and smooshed in some references to deafness. That is to say, Yolanda’s deafness has zero effect on how she navigates life, because she has magical cochlear implants that make her hearing. My Goodreads essay delves into the details.\n\n23. Dragonswood (Wilde Island Chronicles #2) by Janet Lee Carey (2013)\n\nWritten by a presumably hearing author who doesn’t mention any sensitivity readers, this fantasy YA novel features a half-deaf narrator named Tess. Her left ear, puckered like a cauliflower, is profoundly deaf from multiple beatings. And yet she still seems to hear better than hearing people, and the author makes this deaf ear hear magical fey voices—inexplicably, considering hearing people are just able to straight up hear these voices in their totally functional ears. For details, see my Goodreads review. But overall, Tess’s deafness is rarely referenced, and she behaves as a hearing person throughout the novel.\n\nNote: This book also features Tanya, a burn survivor, who uses an illusion spell to hide the scars and appear unblemished. She’s mortified when her “secret” scars are revealed by a mirror. Unfortunately, Tanya hides away, and we don’t see her again.\n\n24. Soundless by Richelle Mead (2015)\n\nWritten by a hearing author with no sign of deaf sensitivity readers, this fantasy YA’s representation is pretty messy. Although there are several accurate instances (such as deaf people being surprised about what things make noises, and attempts to communicate with non-signers), the overall message I got from reading this is that deaf people cannot fight for or save themselves, and literally need a hearing savior to bring divine intervention. I also have tons of questions that really highlight and challenge the author’s ableism, such as her assumption that deafblind people are completely helpless and without communication. To see these questions and more issues I point out, check out my Goodreads review.\n\nNote: The white author is writing exclusively Asian characters. Since I know little about this issue, I will defer to the Asian community’s judgement of the novel. Many people comment on the “Chinese inspiration” in the one-star reviews.\n\nAdult fiction\n\n1. Islay by Douglas Bullard (1985)\n\nWritten by a deaf author, Islay is intentionally written as a burlesque, populated with deaf characters derived from stereotypes. Note that Bullard transliterates ASL, rather than translates or glosses. I found it easy to read and understand, but it might be difficult for English users.\n\n2. Mickey’s Harvest by Howard Leslie Terry (2015)\n\nNote: The deaf author wrote this between 1917 and 1922, and it was published posthumously in 2015. You can read it free on Manifold.\n\nBest I can describe this as is a deaf Roaring Twenties Huckleberry Finn. The story follows Mickey, who loses his hearing after a prolonged illness brought on by a shipwreck that left him orphaned and exposed on the sea for days, and how he became immersed in deaf culture and traveled the U.S. meeting other deaf people.\n\n3. Apparitions by Adam Pottle (2023)\n\nThis horror novel, written by a Deaf author, is based on true stories. Pottle explores themes of language deprivation and familial/institutional violence against deaf people. The best part is that the deaf characters in this work are no more or less complicated and im/moral than the hearing characters.\n\n4. Four Days in Michigan by Philip Zazove (2010)\n\nAn instalove story featuring a deaf Jewish woman who educates her hearing love interest (and by extension the reader) all about 1940s deaf culture. This book is written to teach hearing readers about deaf culture, so as a deaf reader it was hard to get through. I didn’t like the story or the characters, though. Check out my Goodreads review for details.\n\n5. The Deaf Heart by Willy Conley (2015)\n\nThis story follows Max, first white deaf man to be accepted into a biological photography program at Galveston. The deafness itself is handled well and is very accurate, which makes sense because the author is deaf. My issues are with the racism and misogyny throughout the novel. Check out my Goodreads review for details, as well as Davy’s, who agreed with me four years before I read it.\n\n6. Deafening by Frances Itani (2003)\n\nThis book, a historical fiction written by the descendent of a Deaf woman, is extensively researched. The author even claims she learned ASL to write it. Grania, the deaf protagonist, is well-written as far as representation goes, and she is rooted in history. I had to take off some points because there are some things that challenge my suspension of disbelief, and the story is divided between Grania and a hearing man. If you’re interested in my talking points on this representation, check out my Goodreads review.\n\n7. Sister and Brother by Agneta Pleijel (2010), translated by Harald Hille (2018)\n\nWritten by a hearing descendent of the famous deaf painter, Albert Berg (the Swedish one, not the Indiana one who coached football at Gallaudet University), this historical fiction examines the lives of both Albert and his younger hearing sister Helena. There’s a lot about this that is realistic and sad, especially about how deaf people were treated. My Goodreads review contains a few examples, but they could be considered spoilers.\n\n8. The Acupuncture Murders by Dwight Steward (1973)\n\nGoing into this, I had such low expectations for the story and the representation that I found myself shocked by how well done it is. What we’ve got here is basically a deaf Sherlock Holmes, and the deafness aspect is fairly accurate. I can find no information on the author, so I can only assume it is a pen name. Check out my Goodreads review for more.\n\n9. What Willow Says by Lynn Buckle (2021)\n\nWritten by a deaf author, this story follows a deaf child (8) and grandmother (58) who struggle to communicate, told through a series of lyrical journal entries. The granddaughter can lipread, read/write, and sign Irish Sign Language. My Goodreads review touches on what I felt was lacking as far as ISL, but otherwise this is an excellent representation.\n\n10. A Notorious Vow (The Four Hundred #3) by Joanna Shupe (2018)\n\nThis historical romance by a hearing author does pretty well with representing a late-deafened man who lives a semi-reclusive life. He doesn’t belong in the hearing world because of discrimination, but also feels he doesn’t belong in the deaf community because he’s late-deafened (which is admittedly odd, since late-deafness wasn’t uncommon back then, but I guess Shupe didn’t want to write in a bunch of other deaf characters). Shupe also acknowledges the help of a CODA and ASL interpreter in writing Oliver. There is some clear confusion about the differences between French Sign Language and American Sign Language, for which I had to deduct points. For specifics, check out my Goodreads review.\n\n11. Bird-Eyes by Madelyn Arnold (1988)\n\nI haven’t been able to find any author info, but I assume Arnold is hearing because the hearing narrator tends to wax poetic about Anna’s deafness. Overall, the representation is fairly accurate and respectful, showing the realities of Anna’s circumstances in an Illinois psych ward in 1964 and the abuse she receives at the hands of medical professionals. I touch on a few points in my Goodreads review.\n\n12. Cane River by Lalita Tademy (2002)\n\nThis is a deeply researched historical fiction set in antebellum Louisiana, where French was the main language. The deaf character is an enslaved woman named Palmire, an older sister of one of the main characters. Although she is not a main character, Palmire makes several appearances and is referenced many times throughout the novel, and I spot no inaccuracies.\n\n13. Dark Pines by Will Dean (2018)\n\nOverall, this thriller is a good, if wishy-washy, representation of an oral deaf woman who uses hearing aids. A lot of it is super accurate, especially the technical and mundane details surrounding the aids themselves, but some things strike me as off or unrealistic. I discuss several points in my Goodreads review.\n\n14. The Sharp Teeth of Love by Doris Betts (1997)\n\nThe deaf rep in this adult literary book is inconsistent, all over the place, and often not well done at all. For details on where the author went wrong (every other page), check out my Goodreads review.\n\n15. Butterflies in November by Auður Ava Ólafsdóttir (2004), translated by Brian FitzGibbon (2013)\n\nThis is a literary fiction about a young, unlucky woman who wins the lottery and goes on a road trip. And she gets roped into taking her friend’s deaf son along for the ride. If Ólafsdóttir mentioned any deaf advisers or sensitivity readers, it wasn’t included in my translation. I also must admit that I don’t know anything about deaf culture in Iceland, so I can’t say anything about that. I will say this: the child in the novel, Tumi, wears hearing aids (which never seem to run out of batteries), signs, and speaks. He’s not really an involved character, and actually, he’s a plot device to bring the protagonist and her love interest together in the end. He doesn’t appear much, despite being with the protagonist for the majority of the novel, and he also doesn’t do much or say much. I’m not sure that Tumi passes the dog replacement test, either.\n\n16. Star Trek: Troublesome Minds by Dave Galanter (2009)\n\nI won’t say you need to be a Star Trek fan (aka a Trekkie) to enjoy this story, but I am willing to be corrected by anyone who has never seen the show and proceeds to not understand or enjoy the book. Anyway, Galanter worked at Gallaudet University for five years, so he does have an understanding of deaf culture and signing. This story is about a telepathic race who call themselves Isitri. They have evolved with no speech apparatus, but they can use signs to communicate with non-telepaths. Some Isitri are born deaf, but it is a non-issue for a telepathic people, of course. The Isitri have a wrist device that translates their signs, which unfortunately smacks of those horrible signing gloves, but fit right in with the Star Trek universe. I did like that the universal translator needed time to figure out grammar, so we first see the signed grammar—almost like a gloss—and then over time it is translated into Standard [English]. Only one character in the novel is explicitly deaf (Meshu), and she is obviously unable to lipread or communicate effectively with non-telepaths. It’s not badly done; there’s just not much representation to rate here.\n\n17. The Canterbury Tales by Geoffrey Chaucer (1392), translated by Gerald J. Davis (2016)\n\nIn this classic collection of Middle English literature, the deaf character (named either Alice or Alison) tells a short personal experience narrative that includes much domestic violence. Her fifth husband, Jenkin, struck her in the head and deafened her in one ear. She is noted to be very boisterous, though this may just be her personality and not because she cannot hear well.\n\n18. Beyond Paradise by Elizabeth Doyle (2003)\n\nA historical romance novel with a strong female lead and pirates? And one of those pirates is deaf? Bring it! This novel, written by a hearing author without sensitivity readers, was great! Until it wasn’t. Jacques is an excellent (spot-on, actually) representation of a hard of hearing character. He’s multilingual, can lipread in the right lighting and if the speaker is facing him, and rejects pity, among other things. But the author inexplicably decided to make a dramatic reveal that he’s not hard of hearing, but (gasp!) completely deaf since birth, and no mention of any kind of oral education or speech therapy. Now it doesn’t make sense he can lipread one-hundred percent of three spoken languages, and have complete control over his voice’s volume, tone, and pronunciation. For everything wrong with this novel’s representation, see my Goodreads rant. If you read this book, I recommend just ignoring the reveal. Continuing to read him as hard of hearing more or less worked for me.\n\n19. Sons of Blackbird Mountain by Joanne Bischof (2018)\n\nThe hearing author of this mawkish and inspoporny historical romance a stereotypical white Christian woman’s conception of deaf people, despite all the research she did for the time and area (1890s, Appalachia). I detail why I didn’t like it in my Goodreads review.\n\n20. The Hunchback of Notre-Dame by Victor Hugo (1831)\n\nOverall, Hugo was thoughtful and accurate in writing his deaf character. Quasimodo and his behaviors fit into the context of this world, and he has a personality and agency. Like most of the characters, Quasimodo is acerbic and violent. He is clearly a product of this society and isn’t special and naive/innocent on account of his disabilities. My Goodreads review discusses him more in-depth.\n\n21. Aquarium by Yaara Shehori (2021), translated by Todd Hasak-Lowy (2022)\n\nThis is a stream of consciousness novel with very flowery, metaphorical, and abstract writing. The story is told by two sisters, daughters of deaf parents. The big plot twist—spoiler alert—is that the younger daughter is hearing, not deaf. As far as the deaf rep goes, the number one biggest problem is inconsistency in identity/voice. Shehori wants to show the fluidity of identity, but she could have done that while being respectful and accurate to the deaf experience and culture, which she wasn’t, even though she claims to have had help from interpreters and deaf association members. For everything wrong with this novel, check out my Goodreads essay.\n\n22. A Spoonful of Sugar by Kate Hardy (2017)\n\nStacey identifies as hearing impaired and wears in-the-canal hearing aids. She communicates through speech and speechreads in noisier environments. I’m assuming she has a mild deafness. The author is deaf, but it seems she didn’t put a lot of effort into portraying the deaf experience accurately. I go into detail in my Goodreads review.\n\n23. The Hidden by Brian Fairchild (2021)\n\nOverall, not the worse deaf rep I’ve read, but it is extremely clear that a cultural outsider wrote it. The main issues are the signed language(s), which are never named/differentiated (e.g., American Sign Language vs Zambian Sign Language), and name signs, which are treated as code names or military call signs. I discuss the details in my Goodreads review.\n\n24. The Waters by Bonnie Jo Campbell (2023)\n\nAnother surprise deaf rep! I was pleased to discover that this deaf character is well-done. Hermine is losing her hearing as she grows older. She doesn’t get much screen time, but what we do get is great. I share a few details in my Goodreads review.\n\n25. Morality Play by Barry Unsworth (1996)\n\nFor a historical fiction predicated on the wrongful imprisonment of a deaf woman for the murder of a boy, Jane features very little. There is one dynamic scene with her, and a brief reappearance at the end. While I was glad to see that Jane has a personality and intelligence, I was less ecstatic that her story is filtered through hearing men’s at every turn. My Goodreads review has more information, including the well-written sign descriptions.\n\n26. Maybe Someday by Colleen Hoover (2014)\n\nThis deaf-hearing romance went on for way too long, and became increasingly ableist and inspoporny. At some points Ridge, the deaf character, is a good representation, and it’s all making sense, but then are little bits that completely throw me off. It probably doesn’t help that I have spent so much time trying to filter through Sydney’s super cringey ableism, curiosity, and assumptions. My Goodreads review goes over the details.\n\n27. The Long Silence of Mario Salviati by Etienne van Heerden (2000)\n\nWhile the ableist and infantilizing ways the other characters treat Mario, the deaf (and later deafblind) character, may be accurate, this is overall a poor representation, especially given the context (historical realities) of the story. My Goodreads review has the details.\n\n28. The Parrot’s Theorem by Denis Guedj (1998), translated by Frank Wynne (2001)\n\nThis book is a math course in a burlesque, most of which I enjoyed except for the absolutely atrocious deaf representation. I am almost positive that in the first draft of this book, 11-year-old Max was not deaf. The author went back in a subsequent draft and just peppered in some overhanded metaphors and references to deafness as a gimmick. Check out my Goodreads review for details.\n\n29. The Quality of Silence by Rosamund Lupton (2015)\n\nFor a novel written by a person who has experienced childhood deafness, I found all the audism and inaccuracies in this mystery/thriller super disappointing. Every time the author made a wild or inaccurate claim about deafness, lipreading, tech, and signed language, I wanted to scream and tear the paperback in half. For details, here’s the obligatory Goodreads rant.\n\n30. Apathy and Other Small Victories by Paul Neilan (2006)\n\nBearing in mind that this is a satire and that the ableism in particular is revved up, this book featuring two deaf characters who impact the plot (Marlene and her husband Brian) is definitely not the worst deaf representation. In fact, it’s pretty okay, for the most part. I mostly dislike Shane, a middle school bully trapped in the body of a grown man who almost exclusively mocks disabled people and women. My Goodreads review details some of the issues.\n\n31. Other Nature by Stephanie A. Smith (1995)\n\nI really hated this, largely because Smith is metaphorizing and mythologizing disability and being heavy-handed with the eugenics rhetoric even while trying to couch the novel in mystery. There are several deaf characters, all children, but only one is really featured. Smith’s treatment of him is sickening. Refer to my Goodreads review for details, though I wouldn’t recommend it.\n\n32. The Silence by Tim Lebbon (2016)\n\nI really struggled with whether this was better or worse than Barbarian’s Touch. The only thing that saved this author was that he didn’t make his deaf character out to be helpless. Anyway, Lebbon has clearly never even seen a signing deaf person in his life, and he makes no mention of sensitivity readers. There’s honestly a lot to unpack, so see my Goodreads rant for everything wrong with this novel’s representation of a deaf character.\n\n33. The Stand by Stephen King (1990 expanded edition)\n\nOverall, this horror/thriller was a torturous read, and King provides an exceedingly poor representation of a deaf character. Nick is totally deaf, but can speechread 100% of everything, and is inexplicably congenitally mute as well. For details, check out my Goodreads review.\n\n34. Resident Evil: Retribution by John Shirley (2012)\n\nThis official novelization of the 2012 film has tons of issues with the deaf representation. Overall, the deaf character (seven-year-old Becky) would have been much better off dying in the beginning because it started off okay, then plummeted downhill the longer the story went on. For details, check my Goodreads review.\n\n35. Barbarian’s Touch: A SciFi Alien Romance (Book 7 of Ice Planet Barbarians) by Ruby Dixon (2016)\n\nThis is an adult fiction (erotica) book by a hearing author who clearly did zero research about deafness and cochlear implants, despite the main character being a deaf woman with cochlear implants. It’s so bad that I’m not going to even bother saying anything here. If you want to know everything wrong with Dixon’s portrayal, see my Goodreads review/essay. (A friend has let me know that Lila does, in fact, have her hearing cured in a med lab later because she wants to hear her baby’s laugh.)\n\n36. The Japanese Lover by Isabel Allende (2015)\n\nOnce again, Allende has surprised me by including a deaf character. Lillian, Alma’s aunt, is hard of hearing, and becomes more deaf with age. I’m not a fan of the magical realist flair where Lillian practically becomes psychic in order to avoid having to struggle with listening, but overall I didn’t see anything egregious. She’s a minor character and appears fleetingly throughout the novel.\n\n37. Dies the Fire by S. M. Stirling (2004)\n\nOverall, definitely not the worst deaf representation I’ve seen. But it was disappointing to me personally since I can see how much research Stirling put into things like country living. Unfortunately, we have another instance of the Echo Effect. Eilir reads lips well—perfectly, actually—in English and Gaelic, even during group conversations. She also doesn’t appear very much in the novel. I go into more details about her speechreading and signing in my Goodreads review.\n\n38. Death on the Nile by Agatha Christie (1937)\n\nChristie presents a highly realistic portrayal of a woman beginning to lose her hearing with age. She only appears briefly throughout the novel, hence the lower ranking.\n\n39. Ancestors by Chenjerai Hove (1996)\n\nWritten by a Zimbabwean hearing author, this deaf character (Miriro) is rife with stereotypes. Ultimately, there really wasn’t much point to Miriro except as a “pure” ancestor figure that serves to question the status quo. She also barely appeared. My Goodreads review goes into some detail.\n\n40. A Long Petal of the Sea by Isabel Allende (2020)\n\nThis historical novel features a very brief appearance of a deafened man from Asturias, injured in the Spanish Civil War. His companions joke that they can’t get rid of him because he’s an expert shooter, yet treat him with “clumsy tenderness…as if he were a backward child.” Notably, the hearing characters are given names and voices, while this youth is not. (To be clear, this is in no way, shape or form the worst deaf rep; it’s just so blink-and-you’ll-miss-it.)\n\nComics and Graphic Novels\n\n1. Mooncakes by Suzanne Walker and Wendy Xu (2019)\n\nThis graphic novel is a super cute urban fantasy, with LGBTQ rep, Asian American rep, and deaf rep. We have a hard of hearing character who wears bilateral blue aids (with high visibility!). I don’t see anything unrealistic about this representation, which is highly refreshing.\n\n2. Hawkeye (2012) #19, 22 by Matt Fraction and David Aja (2015)\n\nMarvel comics are in the running! Clint Barton (aka Hawkeye) is canonically deaf since 1983, though you wouldn’t know it from the way writers keep erasing that part of his identity. This particular run ranks so highly because of Fraction and Aja’s innovative use of ASL and speech bubbles in their comics. It’s a brilliant way to give the reader a taste of Hawkeye’s experience as a deaf person because there are no translations. We know only what he knows. Fraction and Aja both seem to be hearing, and they don’t acknowledge any sensitivity readers or advisers, so I’m genuinely curious as to how they pulled this off. In #22, which follows up events from #15 (in which a clown stabs him in the ears) and #19 (aka the “deaf issue”), Hawkeye beats up some Bratva, gets beat up himself, and finally gets a pair of bulky purple hearing aids. Fun stuff!\n\nNote: This issue also includes Clint’s brother, Barney, who is injured in the same fight as Clint. Barney uses a wheelchair, and the issue goes on to highlight inaccessible and hostile architecture. The disability representations in this comic are particularly nuanced and great for analysis, which is what several academics have already undertaken.\n\n3. Jessi’s Secret Language adapted by Chan Chau (2022)\n\nOverall, this graphic adaptation immensely improves on the original, which I’ve previously reviewed and ranked. There are still some weaknesses, as I discuss in my Goodreads review, but I think these are a result of trying to remain faithful to the source text. It can be hard to strike a balance.\n\n4. ひだまりが聴こえる (I Hear the Sunspot) series by Yuki Fumino (2014), English release (2017)\n\nAlthough this manga series is definitely a hearing savior story, it’s full of insights that would serve as inspiration or revelation for hearing readers. Deaf readers would generally already be aware of most of the info and identities presented here. Check out my Goodreads review for more info.\n\n5. Iron Man: Sounds Effects by Marc Sumerak (2014)\n\nYou can read this comic online for free here. Okay, so the hearing author of this Marvel comic issue had a lot of help from the Children’s Hearing Institute. In Sound Effects, we have two deaf superheroes: Dr. Pedro Perez (aka Blue Ear), and Samantha Farrell (aka Sapheara). My biggest issue is that both of them actually seem to hear better than hearing people. It’s not that their superpowers make them hear better. It’s the hearing aid and cochlear implant technology, specifically–which is factually incorrect. I take issue with other things, so if you’re at all interested in seeing a critique through a Deaf Studies lens, check out my rewrite project here.\n\n6. West Coast Avengers (2018) #1 – 10 by Kelly Thompson and Stefano Caselli, Daniele di Nicuolo, Gang Hyuk Lim, Moy R. (2018)\n\nIn this series, Hawkeye wears his bulky, purple, behind-the-ear aid, but it keeps disappearing and reappearing! And, for the first time, Kate signs Signed Exact English (SEE) to Hawkeye.\n\n7. Hawkeye vs. Deadpool (2014) #0 – 4 by Gerry Dugan and Matteo Lolli (2014)\n\nThis is the fan-favorite comic series where people keep claiming that Deadpool is “fluent” in ASL, even though he literally only knows two signs. (It’s his plus-sized Black bestie, Eleanor, who is fluent in ASL and has an extended signed conversation with Hawkeye.) Unfortunately, as far as Hawkeye’s deafness goes, the writing is inconsistent. Sometimes he can hear without lipreading, and other times he is totally dependent on lipreading, and his hearing aid disappears. Not as bad as it could be, but still disappointing.\n\n8. Hawkeye (2016) #13 – 16 by Kelly Thompson and Leonardo Romero (2017)\n\nHawkeye joins Kate in LA to figure out who is trying to kill him. We’ve got hearing aid visibility, for the most part, though sometimes it disappears or is flesh-colored. At one point, Hawkeye’s aid is broken in battle, and he switches to a backup behind-the-ear aid, suggesting creators don’t know that there are different types of aids for a reason. Sometimes he struggles to communicate, and sometimes not, so the representation is a little messy.\n\n9. Captain Marvel (2019) #2 – 5 by Kelly Thompson and Carmen Carnero (2019)\n\nOne of the best representations of Echo out there, but rife with inconsistencies and small mistakes (as are all other series featuring her). In this series, Echo wears an expression of intense concentration as she lipreads, and Hazmat even signs a little ASL with her. At the very end, Echo is shown with a cell phone-like device that has a flash alert—an excellent real-world touch.\n\n10. All-New Hawkeye (2015) #1 – 6 by Jeff Lemire and Ramón Pérez (2015)\n\nNote: this is “season” 2 of ANH. 20 years after the events of the previous volume, Hawkeye still uses hearing aids. Kate mentions that it is possible to have his hearing “cured,” but he rejects the “Pym-plant” technology (which I’m assuming is analogous to cochlear implants). The series cuts back and forth between the present and future. His hearing aids are often visible, but sometimes flesh-colored rather than purple.\n\n11. Moon Knight (2010) #2 – 10 by Brian Michael Bendis and Alex Maleev (2011)\n\nEcho is working undercover in some kind of prostitution-espionage ring, and blows her cover when she has to save Moon Knight. We see more ableist language, but this is hardly surprising given the ableism throughout Marvel Comics in general. For the first (and only) time, Echo is shown using TTY, and throughout the series she has to remind characters constantly that she needs to speechread them to understand, although writers/artists fail in this a couple of times. Despite that, this is one of the better and more consistent representations of Echo out there.\n\n12. Match Point! by Maddie Gallegos (2023)\n\nIn this middle grade graphic novel, the deaf character is Erika, who is really into racquetball and is Rosie’s rival/frenemy. She is very outgoing, and communicates via text/messenger and ASL. No mention of sensitivity reader, but Erika’s brief appearances are always well-portrayed.\n\n13. Hawkeye (1983) by Mark Gruenwald (1983)\n\nIt’s the O.G. Hawkeye, y’all. The representation of his deafness is not bad. It’s a bit lower on the list because he becomes deaf in the last few pages of the final issue, so there’s not much there to begin with.\n\n14. M.F.K.: Book One by Nilah Magruder (2017)\n\nThis middle grade fantasy graphic novel features a protagonist with an assistive listening device. The extent of her deafness is unclear, but I do speculate on it in my Goodreads review. Overall, there’s not much depth to this representation by a hearing creator.\n\n15. Black Widow (2020) #1 – 5, 12 by Kelly Thompson and Elena Casagrande (2020)\n\nThere is hearing aid visibility in this series, but it is strange that Hawkeye would remove his aid to put an earpiece radio in, and switch them out. (There’s also a mistake where he is still communicating via the radio, but he is wearing his aid, but they seem to retcon this by making his device a hearing aid and radio in one.) A nice touch is that his aid loops all the way around the shell of his ear for extra stability, since he does parkour and gets knocked around a lot.\n\nNote: There’s more to this series but I haven’t read it yet.\n\n16. Hawkeye: Freefall (2020) #1 – 6 by Matthew Rosenberg and Otto Schmidt (2020)\n\nIn this series (which happens to be one of my favorites), the hearing aid visibility is inconsistent. Although Hawkeye seems to miss cues and misunderstand people speaking around him, he does not have issues with communicating through intercoms or listening to voice recordings, which is odd.\n\n17. Daredevil (1998), #9 – 15, 51 – 55 by Glenn Herdling, Gregg Schigiel, David Mack, Joe Quesada, Jimmy Palmiotti, Rob Haynes, David Ross (1999)\n\nThis series features a ton of ableist rhetoric in general, not just for deafness but also for blindness and for speech and learning disabilities, among other things. We get Maya Lopez (aka Echo)’s backstory, which is that none of the white medical professionals realized she was deaf and placed her in an institution for children with developmental disabilities (though of course the word they use is the r-slur). The writers also demonstrate their ignorance of how real deaf people use technology at several points, having Echo be unable to decipher the “secrets of the telephone” despite VRS and TTY having been fairly mainstream since the 1970s.\n\n18. All-New Hawkeye (2015) #1 – 5 by Jeff Lemire and Ramón Pérez (2015)\n\nNote: this is “season” 1 of ANH. This series follows Fraction and Aja’s retcon of Hawkeye’s hearing, having him experience childhood deafness. As an adult, Hawkeye wears in-canal hearing aids (provided by Tony Stark) that also function as long-range communication devices. Unfortunately, when Hawkeye takes out his aid he is unable to hear anything at all, and with it in he can hear whispers—which isn’t how hearing aids work.\n\n19. New Avengers (2004) #11 – 13, 27 – 34, 36 – 39, 48 by Brian Michael Bendis, David Finch, Leinil Francis Yu, Marko Djurdjevic, David Mack (2005)\n\nMaya Lopez appears as both Ronin and Echo in this series, although she is unconscious for several issues. We start off strong with the deaf representation, with Maya texting/emailing people, not responding to masked characters, etc. But after she regains consciousness and rejoins the fight, the writers start to lose the thread of her deafness. She responds to masked characters, is able to understand and respond to other characters during all-out melees, and so on. Even when she does ask for clarification or repeats, her teammates respond condescendingly to her (#36 in particular). In one fight, she seems to get in the way of her teammates, when this is something that has never happened before, and seems to be written solely to help justify erasing her from the narrative.\n\n20. Captain America (2018) #9, 12, 14-16 by Ta-Nehisi Coates and Adam Kubert (2019)\n\nEcho is a member of the Daughters of Liberty, and she does participate in conversations to a small extent, although it’s not clear how well she’s following the discussion with everyone riffing off one another. She takes out a bunch of men who have been partially incapacitated already by a noise that doesn’t affect her, but in the next couple of issues she disappears from the narrative entirely.\n\n21. Daredevil (2015) #21, #599 – 600 by Charles Soule and Goran Sudzuka (2017)\n\nIn this series, Daredevil isn’t allowed to touch/harm the baddies he’s trying to put away, so brings in Echo. He shadow punches, and Echo replicates his movements in real-time, punishing the bad guys at his behest. Despite this badass moment, she’s not a central character throughout the rest of her appearances.\n\nNote: This series is part of the All-New, All-Different Marvel arc.\n\n22. Generation X #3 by Christina Strain (2017)\n\nThis hearing writer gives us a comic book issue featuring a deafblind character named Face. To me, this is the best representation of Face out there…Which says a lot about how poorly this character is treated. This comic suggests independence: Face is found unconscious and alone in Central Park—how did he get there? He must have been taking a walk when he was attacked. This demonstrates the reality that deafblind people do in fact have lives. His classmates bring him back to the school infirmary and discuss reading his memory. Quentin says, “He’s blind, deaf, and mute. I’d get as much out of his pitch-black mindscape as I get talking to you. Nothing.” (Boom, roasted.) They assume here that Face is unable to record memories in an accessible format. When Face wakes up, Strain also demonstrates that he is able to communicate effectively by tapping Morse Code, and can understand it being tapped back on his hand. It would have been nice, though, if they had interacted with him more instead of getting the information from him and leaving him alone.\n\nFun Fact: Thomas Alva Edison (you may know him as the “inventor” of the lightbulb) was deaf, and one of his friends, Miller Hutchinson, would often tap Morse Code on Edison’s knee to help him follow along during meetings. (Source: Edmund Morris’ 2019 biography Edison.)\n\n23. New Mutants #17 – 19, 25, 28, 33, 44, 49 – 50 by Dan Abnett and Andy Lanning (2009)\n\nThese comic book writers and artists apparently tried their best with this representation of a deafblind character. Face (real name unknown) has the power to explode objects with his mind. Unfortunately, before he learned to control it, he accidentally blew off the front of his own head, resulting in the lack of four senses (hearing, sight, taste, and smell). Since then, he is completely isolated because no one bothers to communicate with him. His “team” literally puts him on a leash and uses him for his powers, directing him on where to aim the explosions by tapping Morse Code on his head until the New Mutants rescue him. A telepath named Karma is able to communicate with him directly, but when she is not there (which is most of the time), Face just sits around looking pretty. They don’t even bother to teach him any methods of communication like ProTactile or writing, though that’s not really surprising considering they haven’t given him a real name, either!\n\n24. Avengers/Invaders (2008) #2, 4 – 8 by Jim Krueger, Alex Ross & Steve Sadowski (2008)\n\nIn this series, Maya has a small role despite her being on the team. She is mocked in this series—specifically, Spider-Man covers her eyes, cutting off her ability to communicate effectively. Later, after Echo is able to take out the villain D’Spayre, Dr. Strange commends the fact that she literally saved all of them by saying her “inadequacies” and “infirmities” (i.e., her deafness) are reasons to “rejoice” rather than “despair.” Even though Maya has never, not once, been despairing about her deafness.\n\n25. Secret Invasion (2008) #1 – 3, 5 – 6, 8 by Brian Michael Bendis and Leinil Francis Yu (2008)\n\nThe Skrulls are taking over, and Echo, still a member of the team, is helping to stop them…sort of. She’s very much a background character in this series, only appearing in panels here and there.\n\n26. Avengers: No Road Home (2019) #3, 9 by Mark Waid, Jim Zub, Al Ewing, Paco Medina (2019)\n\nIn this series, there’s no indication of Hawkeye’s deafness until issue #3, when Hulk references his “hearing loss” being the least of his worries, and again in #9, when Euphoria asks Hawkeye his deepest desire.\n\n27. West Coast Avengers (1985) #1 – 5 by Steve Englehart and Al Milgrom (1985)\n\nThe writers of this series seem to keep forgetting Hawkeye is deaf. They started out strong—Hawkeye and Mockingbird are making out on the couch when the doorbell rings, which Hawkeye doesn’t hear. But in general, there is no indication that he is deaf at all, except a few quips from The Thing here and there. By issue #6, there are no longer any references to his deafness.\n\n28. Marvel’s Voices: Indigenous Voices (2020) #1 by Darcie Little Badger, Taboo, B. Earl, Weshoyot Alvitre, David Cutler (2020)\n\nThis short comic features Echo being tricked into helping Loki fight a god on another planet. We also see Echo with a smartphone, showing her text messages, though it is broken during a fight and she tosses it in the trash. Carol signs briefly to her, but it’s more about showing off than communicating effectively. Unfortunately, while this story starts off well, the writers quickly lose the thread of Echo’s deafness: She is able to communicate perfectly with aliens (no mention of different mouth shapes or accents), and responds to people speaking behind her.\n\n29. Avengers (1963) #239 by Roger Stern and Al Milgrom (1984)\n\nIt’s the Avengers on Late Night with David Letterman! Not a dated reference at all. Following the events of Hawkeye (1983) #4, Hawkeye rejoins the Avengers team. He and Mockingbird make repeated references to his “slight hearing loss” and how he is “a little hard of hearing,” despite the fact that he is shown to be unable to hear or understand voices at all. Much of this is exaggerated by Stern for perceived humorous effect, so I’ve got to dock points.\n\n30. Captain America (1968) #310 – 11 by Mark Gruenwald and Paul Neary (1985)\n\nAfter much self-debate, I have decided to include the original two appearances of Gustav Kruger (aka Rattler). In his Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe, Gruenwald notes that Rattler is 80% deaf in both ears and wears hearing aids, though this is never made explicit in the series. In issues #310 and #311, the Serpent Society are obviously providing accommodations to someone: talking points printed on brochures; sitting in semi-circles; etc. Rattler is shown taking advantage of these, and has a look/posture of intense concentration during meetings.\n\n31. Daredevil #285 – 289 by Ann Nocenti (1964)\n\nI’m not saying this is the worst representation of a deaf character I’ve ever seen. I’m just saying that in this comic series, the hearing writer devotes a single line referencing Nyla Skin’s deafness: “I’m pretty deaf myself. You know—too much rock’n’roll.” The entire five issues in which Nyla appears do not allude to her deafness in any way, shape, or form.\n\n32. World War Hulk (2007) #2 – 3 by Greg Pak and John Romita Jr (2007)\n\nAlthough Echo appears and interacts with hearing characters in these comic issues, there is no mention or indication of her deafness at all.\n\nShort Stories / Flash Fiction\n\n1. “Feast” by Ross Showalter (2022)\n\nWritten by a deaf author, this short story actually brought me to tears—the anxiety the hearing aid-wearing narrator feels as the only deaf person at the party is potent, relatable: “Every party was a feast of sound and mouths and consumption, nothing for me to hold on to.” Click the title link to read this story!\n\n2. “Of Silence and Slow Time” by Karawynn Long (1995)\n\nThis short story is set in a dystopic future where all embryos undergo gene testing to find those with genes for disabilities and force replacement therapy. The deaf main character, Marina, enlists the help of Jeff in ensuring her baby is born deaf. The signed dialog is transliterated (as opposed to translated or glossed), and Marina uses an “interpreter,” more accurately a transcriber, a machine that renders speech to text. The descriptions of speechreading are very accurate.\n\n3. “Reconstructing Cleider Rodman” by Alice Terry (1921)\n\nWritten by a deaf author, this short story encapsulates the concept of deaf-same and found family, resisting the oralist narrative of “restoration to [hearing] society” and instead emphasizing a restoration to happiness. Irene, a deaf woman, runs into an apparently homeless veteran, Cleider, who was deafened in the first world war. Cleider, who tried and failed to lipread, runs away from home after his family and friends refuse to learn signs with him. Irene takes him into her family as a brother.\n\n4. “Dolly’s Sweetheart” by Douglas Tilden (1899)\n\nWritten by a deaf author, this story features different signing systems such as the Rochester method. A young man called Glyde begins to learn sign language from several church-going young ladies, and he tells them to keep secret their engagements. He’s courting multiple women at once, you see. The preacher tells Glyde’s father, who explodes and forces his son to marry the first young woman in order to protect her reputation. It’s a whole thing.\n\n5. “The Message of the Rosary” by Alice Nicholson (1921)\n\nWritten by a deaf author, this story features Dorothy Worth, a deafened Gallaudet student who speaks. Her parents are supportive of her deaf identity, but are non-signing. In Florida, she has a chance encounter with Floyd, a deaf oral real estate agent (he attended Gallaudet and does sign, but his family doesn’t), and here we have the instalove trope. But both assume the other is hearing even when they chat with one another and socialize. It’s pretty funny and has a happy ending!\n\n6. “Dummy” by Howard T Hofsteater (1930)\n\nWritten by a deaf author, this sad story features a deaf man called Dummy (in reference to his muteness), who is best friends with his neighbor, Miriam, a young hearing woman. Miriam and Dummy created a system of home signs, which his younger brother also picked up. Every year they go pick walnuts together, but not this year. Mysteriously, Dummy is told to come back later with his family. The story follows Dummy as he tries to puzzle this out. To the reader it is obvious that the big event is Miriam’s wedding, but since this takes place in a different time and Dummy has never been away from home for more than two days in all his 23 years, it is fairly realistic that Dummy doesn’t understand what’s happening.\n\n7. “Jerry and Clarinda” by W. Henry Bishop (c. 1888)\n\nBishop has clearly done his homework in writing this short story with two deaf characters, but I can find no biographical info about how he came to this info. There are very accurate portrayals throughout of how deaf people communicate (through signs and writing, including a demonstration of deaf written grammar). Interestingly, Bishop also shows his awareness of the deaf community’s opinions on deaf-deaf marriage.\n\nUpdate: Thanks to David Sachs for letting me know that Bishop taught at the New-York Institution for the Instruction of the Deaf and Dumb from 1885 to 1888—explaining how he gets it so accurate!\n\n8. “The Limner” by Julian Barnes (2008)\n\nWritten by a hearing author, the narrator, Wadsworth, is a deaf painter who is offended by a client who keeps trying to speak to him. Wadsworth cannot lipread or speak intelligibly, and gesturing with hearing people is often a humiliating guessing game, so he usually writes back and forth instead. Deaf gain: “Wadsworth did not see that speaking was in itself a promoter of virtue. His own advantages were only two: that he could represent on canvas those who spoke, and could silently perceive their meaning. It would have been foolish to give away this second advantage.”\n\n9. “Chasm” by Ross Showalter (2022)\n\nCalvin has recently moved to his parents’ house between graduating Deaf school and attending Gallaudet University and pretends to go to church youth group (at parents’ behest). He actually sits alone at a diner for two hours rather than struggle with signing-impaired people. He wears hearing aids and signs, and it seems only his father knows how to at least fingerspell. The story takes a sharp, sinister turn.\n\n10. “Laurens Beecher, Christian” by Alice T. Terry (1915)\n\nWritten by a deaf author, this short story features deaf ten-year-old Benny, deafened at two from meningitis, on a camping trip with his oral English teacher. Despite the fact that he hardly speaks, Quiz boasts that while other teachers over four years could not make progress with him, he has. Prof Platt is dubious as he can see in Benny’s eyes “a state of undeveloped intellect.” (As in he has been taught nothing even though he is capable of learning.) Benny ends up getting lost in the woods, where a legislator on vacation finds him and realizes he has the power and a “Christian duty” to help deaf children. After personally investigating oral and signing schools, Beecher practically singlehandedly bans oral schools in the state. It’s a very idealistic story that heroicizes white hearing men, but the point of this story is to stroke egos and persuade legislators to ban oralism.\n\n11. “Little Changes, Little Child” by Ross Showalter (2020)\n\nA hearing father muses about his deaf son, who attends the deaf institute in Texas, and the family’s home life. His wife, Martha, had been called into work and couldn’t come with John to pick up their son Aaron for the summer. John has been practicing ASL. He enters the gym, full of raucous children, and checks in with the principal, who then goes to retrieve Aaron for him from the mass. At first he doesn’t recognize Aaron (it’s been 5 months), and he can’t keep up with Aaron’s signing. Ends on a sad note.\n\n12. “Love Conquers All” by Lawrence Newman (1944)\n\nWritten by a deaf author, this short story chronicles the changing perspectives a deaf-hearing family, particularly of Mrs. Marlowe, the hearing mother of a deaf daughter, Jean, who marries a deaf man named Eric. Her despair and pity of their deafness, and her intense desire for abled grandchildren, soon turn to insatiable love and devotion. While all three want baby Anthony to be hearing, he is deaf.\n\n13. “The Youngest Miss Piper” by Bret Harte (c. 1903)\n\nA short story by a hearing author, which I personally enjoyed! You can read it by clicking the title above. The narrator starts off by trying to explain to the reader why not many people like Miss Delaware Piper, and dismisses many potential reasons, including a “slight deafness.” She advocates for herself: She alludes to her “deaf ear,” and tells people to speak louder or come closer. The only person she can understand with no problem is Thomas Sparrell, a man with a disabled leg, which essentially causes a sensation when it comes out that they are lovers. Del speaks a bit differently from other characters too—what comes across as a Southern dialect can easily be construed as a “deaf accent.”\n\n14. “A Kind of Murder” by Hugh Pentecost (1962)\n\nA sad short story by a hearing author, which you can read by clicking the title above. This representation is pretty well-written. The deaf character, Mr. Warren, has “pleasant but flat voice,” and is painfully unable to discipline his students. The boys immediately discern he’s deaf, and decide to make Mr. Warren’s life hell, ultimately costing him his job.\n\n15. “Mumu” by Ivan S. Turgenev (1884)\n\nA hearing man wrote this short story, which you can read free by clicking the above title. There are a few discrepancies, but the descriptions in this story are mostly ambiguous enough that we can read this as an accurate representation. Gerasim is a very tall deaf man, taken from his rural village to work as a serf in the city for an old lady. The other servants communicate with him through “signs.” (Signs probably means gestures rather than signed language, but it’s not very clear.) They make repeated references to Gerasim as a devil/beast/creature, wild man of the woods, and monster of the steppes. Overall, it’s an okay representation, but the message comes across to me as deaf people can’t have companionship.\n\n16. “Fairer than the Sun” by Juozas Grušas (1958)\n\nThis short story features a deaf lumberjack, Adam, who is infantilized by the author and bullied by his hearing peers. There’s a lot of self-pitying from Adam, who is probably the best lumberjack of all the men. He seems to have some residual hearing, responding to some men who yell in his ear, and he speaks rather than signs/gestures.\n\n17. “A New England Prophet” by Mary E. Wilkins (1894)\n\nThis short story ridicules the romanticized idea that God speaks or acts through a deaf person. A family comes to believe that Lonny, the fourteen year old deaf boy who was never taught signs nor speech, is receiving revelations from God when he starts to draw religious symbols. Most townspeople also believe Lonny’s drawings are prophetic because they can’t fathom the idea that he has seen such drawings in books before and is representing them with the encouragement of their rapt attention and reactions. Lonny is just an intelligent child with good art skills who yearns for attention.\n\n18. “God’s Fool” by Mary Roberts Rinehart (1919)\n\nThis is a story of forgiveness and washing away sins. Elizabeth (a young woman worshiped by the deaf character, called Dummy) needs to replace her burned away skin with Dummy’s, because as a supposedly perpetual child “unable to reason,” he is incapable of sin. He also initiates the reunion of Elizabeth and her ex-lover Jerry by physically joining their hands, as though in mock matrimony. Dummy serves as the intermediary of God–he is the titular “God’s Fool.” The nurses muse about his ability to magically know things. “So many things he should have known the Dummy never learned; so many things he knew that he seemed never to have learned!” This is to reinforce that God is working through him. Dummy has no other purpose or personality, except that he does odd jobs at the hospital like polish brass and walk the superintendent’s dog to earn his 3 meals a day.\n\n19. “Chickamauga” by Ambrose Bierce (1891)\n\nThis short story features a 6-year-old deaf-mute son of a poor planter and war veteran. He gets lost one night in the woods and sleeps through a skirmish with musket fire and screams. Waking up, he wanders and sees hundreds of injured/maimed white men crawling along the ground, and watches and laughs because he doesn’t understand, and in fact begins to lead this procession before finding his way home. Bierce notes that the boy can gesture and howl “like a devil.”\n\n20. “Deaf and Blind” by Lara Vapnyar (2017)\n\nClick the title above to read this short fiction for free on The New Yorker. This hearing author writes the story of a young girl meeting a deafblind man named Sasha for the first time. It’s not a bad representation, but it is fairly brief and somewhat superficial, and we don’t get a lot of information aside from Sasha’s backstory. The narrator’s grandparents, particularly her grandfather, make a big deal out of Sasha’s deafblindness. They have questions like, “How can you be both deaf and blind?” and “Is he neat with the toilet?” When Olga and Sasha come to dinner, the narrator even turns down a skiing trip with her absent father for the novelty of meeting a deafblind man. I have a couple of questions myself: 1) How did Olga learn tactile sign? And 2) In the end, Sasha and Olga marry. When Olga dies young, Sasha remarries within a year to another woman who left her husband for him. What is the message here? That women fall heads over heels for him because it’s certain a deafblind man loves you for you, rather than for your looks/voice?\n\n21. “Dolphins” by Ross Showalter (2019)\n\nRanked low because it’s very short. The narrator wears hearing aids. They are drinking and flirting with a friend while a documentary on dolphins plays.\n\n22. “Joth Countryman Retires” by MacKinlay Kantor (c. 1925)\n\nJoth, a man in his eighties who has become deaf with age, is a fife player in the fife and drum corps. Whereas his band is playing one song, he plays an entirely different song–but can he not hear the drums are playing a different rhythm? If he can hear someone yelling at him, surely he can hear a drum right beside him. In the end, Joth admits to his band that he’s getting a “little hard of hearing” (although everyone in town already knew that of course) and tells them to write to him, not shout. A cute story with a relatable ending, though the deafness itself is superficially handled and doesn’t make much sense in context.\n\n23. “Water Through Our Hands” by Ross Showalter (2019)\n\nMaya, a Coda ASL interpreter, is hired to interpret for deaf student at a local university. The two deaf students in this story aren’t particularly active, and while Maya’s memories of her deaf mother are more prominent, deaf characters don’t feature centrally here.\n\n24. “Song for the Deaf” by John Henry Fleming (2014)\n\nThis is the last story in the short story collection “Songs for the Deaf.” It features Marietta, a deaf woman who is the object of two men’s desires. She’s barely in the story, only having any kind of agency or personality at the very end. I go into a bit more detail in my Goodreads review.\n\n25. “Deaf, Dumb and Blind” by H.P. Lovecraft and C.M. Eddy Jr. (1925)\n\nYou can read this short horror by clicking on the title above. These authors create the debonair author Richard Blake, who has been deaf, blind, mute, and paraplegic for six years, having been injured in World War I. But the thing is, they never actually present him (living) to the reader. He’s living in a haunted house with his manservant/caretaker/interpreter, who goes mad and leaves him there! When Dobbs doesn’t come at his summons, Blake assumes his bell is broken and pounds on the table instead. Then he starts to get worried and begins to write on his typewriter to distract himself. He ends up recording the sensations he experiences: vibrations, smells, someone’s presence—and about this “hellish thing [that] had defied those shattered senses of sight and sound and penetrated so disastrously to the delicate intelligence that brooded in external darkness and silence.” In short, the beings are able to make him hear and see them before they kill them.\n\n26. “A Clean, Well-Lighted Place” by Ernest Hemingway (1961)\n\nHemingway is a hearing author writing this short story, but the deaf character is not the focus. Rather, the focus is on the attitudes of two men. An old deaf man, about 80 years old, is drinking alone as the waiters gossip and complain about him. The waiter who serves him insults him as he pours his brandy: “You should have killed yourself last week.” The old man doesn’t hear him, of course, and thanks him for the service. When the old man asks for another brandy, the waiter goes to him: “Finished,” he said, speaking with that omission of syntax stupid people employ when talking to drunken people or foreigners. “No more tonight. Close now.” The old man pays and leaves, and the waiters get back to talking and closing up. You can read this by clicking on the title above.\n\n27. “The Deaf-Mute” by Guy de Maupassant (1903)\n\nThe deaf character, Gargan, appears very briefly, but one of the hearing characters tells a story about him that takes up the bulk of the story. The story is written as an epistolary by the narrator, who is writing to his friends in Paris to explain why he’s not back from hunting. Gargan is a shepherd who can speechread a bit and gestures. Only his master Picot is able to fully understand his gestures, and Gargan can fully understand only Picot. When he goes to court, Picot served as interpreter as Gargan pantomimes what happened.\n\n28. “Night Moves” by Ross Showalter (2020)\n\nThe narrator of this short story is a hearing psychologist who met a young deaf man (who wears hearing aids) at an informal ASL class at the gay bar. When they start dating, he promises to learn ASL for this young man, who starts teaching him but is impatient with his slow progress. After the breakup, the narrator has trouble sleeping and often wakes to find his hands forming signs he barely uses/knows, moving of their own accord.\n\n29. “The Stars Above” by Katharine Duckett (2018)\n\nAlibek is deaf in his right ear and sometimes misses whistled cues. He and the narrator Jack apparently use a hodgepodge of languages (Russian-Kazakh-English-“sign language”), but it’s not clear whether they’re using any specific SL or if the author means gestures (which are not SL). Jack “signs a promise with [his] fingers,” which suggests a manual alphabet (fingerspelling) rather than actually signing. The author seems to be using SL to suggest intimacy rather than communication, which I strongly dislike.\n\n30. “Beethoven’s Ninth” by N. J. Haus (2023)\n\nNarrated by a pianist who is teaching Lydia, a young mute woman, this short story features a deaf character who is a “mysterious” new neighbor. He only appears in glimpses and hearsay, and the narrator never interacts with him. Deafness is used as a plot twist, the grand reveal surrounding the mystery of the new neighbor who is a virtuoso pianist. The man, Thomas, went deaf at 32, and it’s not clear how old he is now or when he learned ASL. It seems more like an instalove (supposedly heartwarming) story, with the two disabled characters bonding over their shared language in an inaccessible community.\n\n31. “El sátiro sordo” by Rubén Darío (2020)\n\nNote: I read this in Spanish. You can copy + paste the story from the linked title into Google translate if you need to.\n\nMade deaf as a punishment for surprising the god Apollo, Satyr doesn’t let the fact that he can’t understand the others’ speech or hear warnings of danger stop him from having fun. He has two advisers: a lark and a donkey, who make decisions on his behalf. Since he can no longer hear the lark, Satyr takes cues only from donkey, who can nod/shake its head. But the author conflates deafness with muteness, for once he is deafened Satyr stops speaking entirely. There seems to be a metaphor for deafness as stubbornness and refusal to listen, as he rudely sends away Orpheus, a famed musician who asks Satyr for hospitality.\n\n32. “Death is Deaf” by Cliff Campbell (1942)\n\nThe deaf character, Eckland, is a speechreading bank teller who thwarts a heist. Big Sid comes up with a gun behind and speaks softly that it’s a stick up; Eckland doesn’t respond. He spots Sid’s partner with a gun across the lobby. Sid warns against hitting the alarm, but Eckland goes for it. Eckland doesn’t actually have any dialog, but we do learn that he has goals, he reacts realistically, etc.\n\n33. “The Loves of Lady Purple” by Angela Carter (1974)\n\nThis story has a few brief glimpses of a deaf teen boy, the nephew of a virtuoso puppeteer. They, and presumably the mute girl they pick up along the way, converse in a signed language, “punctuated by soft, wordless grunts and whistles.” The boy mostly does setting up and tear-down jobs, though he also works some of puppets, as he is the apprentice.\n\n33. “Tinnitus” by Ross Showalter (2021)\n\nA very short story featuring a narrator who wears hearing aids and can hear car engines with/without them, even over the tinnitus that plagues him.\n\n34. “The Deaf Man of Kensington” in Bohemian Days: Three American Tales by George Alfred Townsend (1879)\n\nThis one was admittedly disappointing. The excellently portrayed profoundly deaf character turns out to have been hearing. The only reason it appears on this list is because he was temporarily deaf at one point. He just continues to feign deafness for years until he uses it as a “gotcha” in court.\n\n35. “Gargoyle” by Edwina Stanton Babcock (1922)\n\nWritten by a hearing author, this short story features a boy called “Gargoyle” (his actual name is John), whom I assume may have Goldenhar Syndrome, just from the description of his “grotesque face and figure.” I’m confused about whether John is deaf, and having read this three times I still haven’t figured it out. At one point, the doctor takes John away with him to discuss his condition and the possibility of schooling with another doctor. The doctor sends an update saying John can now speak, although he doesn’t know any words. So it’s clear he’s receiving oral training. An unknown amount of time passes, and the doctor brings John home. He cautions everyone against references to his “former condition.” John now speaks perfectly, and there is no mention of him lipreading, though he responds when spoken to, and he’s noted to be “listening” later on. John and Mrs. Strang have a conversation, and John asks her to confirm whether everyone thought he was “deaf and dumb” until he was twelve years old. Mrs. Strang admits that they knew he did not speak, but they were never sure that he could not hear—a bit strange, since it would be obvious if he could hear by whether he responded to auditory stimuli. John casually wishes he had not been educated because it made him forget what he knew before. You can read this by clicking the title above. (If you figure out whether or not he’s deaf, let me know!)\n\n36. “The Sounds of Early Morning” in The Miniature Wife: And Other Stories by Manuel Gonzales (2013)\n\nThe author is clearly trying to do something metaphorical with sound-as-weapon and deaf-as-protection, but it’s completely lost on me because nothing about how the sound affects people makes any sense. Details in my Goodreads review.\n\n37. “The Shaman Painting” by Tong-ni Kim (1974), translated by John Holstein (2009)\n\nThis short literary piece, written by a hearing man, recounts how a shaman is so determined to restore her daughter’s hearing that she essentially drowns herself. The daughter has apparently been deaf and non-vocal for years, and is wasting away. Very brief appearance, not a lot of information about her, and she seems to miraculously recover. You can read this online by clicking the above title.\n\nAnthologies\n\n1. Tripping the Tale Fantastic, edited by Christopher Jon Heuer (2017)\n\nI have no complaints about these stories containing deaf characters. Why would I, when all these stories are by deaf or hard of hearing authors?\n\nTitles with explicitly deaf characters are:\n\n“The Meaning, not the Words” by Kristen Ringman\n\n“The Ear” by Willy Conley\n\n“Family Dog” by Raymond Luczak\n\n“The Vibrating Mouth” by John Lee Clark\n\n“The Job” by Maverick Smith\n\n“The Climax” by Tonya Maria Stremlau\n\n“In the Haunted Darkness” by Michael R. Collins\n\n“Spirit Box” by Kristen Harmon\n\n“Understanding” by Kelsey M. Young\n\n“Online Dating” by Daniel Crosby\n\nOther titles metaphorize deafness, such as “Hearing Aid” by David Langford and “Rui’s Story” by Bobby Cox and Joanne Yee.\n\n2. Deaf Culture Fairy Tales by Roz Rosen (2017)\n\nWritten by a Deaf author, this collection of reimagined tales each feature at least one deaf character. As the title suggests, the characters are not merely deaf, they are culturally deaf (specifically Western deaf cultured). The lessons in each tale may not come across clearly to those unversed in deaf history, politics, and culture, but these stories can be a fun way to dive into these issues in a classroom setting or be read alongside nonfiction texts pertaining to deaf lives.\n\n3. Deaf American Prose (1980–2010), edited by Kristen Harmon and Jennifer L. Nelson (2012)\n\nAgain, no complaints. This anthology includes 48 (mostly fiction) stories. Some stories are POV deaf or hearing, some are excerpts from larger stories, etc. There’s a real variety. Some stories have triggering content, including use of the r-slur.\n\nMy personal favorites: “Whispering with Cranes” by Pamela Wright and “Dandelion” by Allison Polk. Check out the Table of Contents here!\n\nNote: “Nympholepsy,” “Goodbye, My Valentine,” and “The Influence of the Spanish Inquisition on Colonial Europe” do not have explicitly deaf characters.\n\n4. The Deaf Way II Anthology, edited by Tonya M. Stremlau (2002)\n\nThis is a collection of various works by deaf authors, including poetry, essays, and short stories. What’s not to love? The seven short stories featuring deaf characters are:\n\n“Listening for the Same Thing” by Christopher Jon Heuer;\n\n“Borrowed Time” by Carl Wayne Denney;\n\n“Yet: Jack Can Hear!” by Douglas Bullard;\n\n“How to Become a Backstabber” and “Depths of the River” by Raymond Luczak;\n\n“Every Man Must Fall” by Willy Conley (excerpted from The Deaf Heart, already ranked on this list); and\n\n“A Nice Romantic Dinner” by Tonya Marie Stremlau.\n\n5. No Walls of Stone, edited by Jill Jepson (1992)\n\nThis anthology contains a variety of deaf lit, mostly poems and one play. There are a few short stories with deaf characters:\n\n“On the Seawall” – excerpted from The Deaf Heart (full novel ranked on this list).\n\n“The Finer Things” – a deaf gay man meets a hearing gay man who shows him the art world.\n\n“Inner Ears” – a girl with hearing loss tries to pass as hearing: “I cheat, lie, guess, bluff, and piece clues together.”\n\n“To Your Health” – a hearing impaired character obsessed with researching a cure.\n\n“Christmas Cheer” – dinner table syndrome at family gathering, outside looking in; narrator fights this framework, instead working with family to plan around hearing loss to ensure she can participate.\n\nMislabeled as deaf characters\n\nI keep coming across lists of books and reviews that claim certain books feature deaf characters, when it’s not the case. Even scholars have made the mistake of conflating muteness with deafness! So I decided to add this section in the hopes that others don’t pick up a book without a deaf character when they did in fact want a deaf character.\n\n“The Christmas Present” by Richmal Crompton (1922)\n\nI definitely feel cheated after reading this short humorous story. The Crewe’s hereditary deafness is faked. Starting with Mary’s great-grandmother, the women in this family mysteriously become deaf in middle age, much to their husbands’ frustration. But they’re pretending to be deaf to get some peace and quiet. (Relatable, but come on.) Honestly, I saw it coming since it’s not subtle at all, but it was still disappointing. You can read this for free by clicking the title above.\n\nKindred by Octavia E. Butler (1979)\n\nCarrie is mute, not deaf. It’s made explicit several times throughout the novel that she can hear and understand.\n\nArcher’s Voice by Mia Sheridan (2014)\n\nArcher is mute, not deaf. The protagonist has a deaf father, but it’s my understanding that he never appears in the story, and is only mentioned to justify her knowledge of signed language.\n\nWhat the Deaf-Mute Heard by G.D. Gearino (1996)\n\nThe main character, Sammy, pretends to be deaf and mute throughout the novel.\n\nUpcoming Books to be Ranked (alphabetized by title)\n\nUnderlined titles are ones I have on my reading list, and which will be added to the ranking as soon as I’ve read and reviewed them. Which book(s) are you most excited to see ranked? Let me know and I’ll prioritize it. (If you’re the author, please consider providing me a copy!)\n\nDid I miss any fiction books, comics/graphic novels, or short stories with a deaf character? Drop the title in a comment below so I can add it to my list! (Yes, I also look at manga, and novelizations of films. No, I do not rank poetry, plays, baby books, books with deaf animals—bats, dogs, cats, etc., or online stories/fanfics.) You can give me titles in other languages. Although I can only read English and Spanish, I also have the patience to wait for translations.\n\nAlso, thanks to Dr. Sharon Pajka, whose blog Deaf Characters in Adolescent Literature I wish I knew about when I started this in 2021-ish! I also must express gratitude to Jonathan Miller, who compiled an annotated bibliography of deaf characters in literature in 1992.\n\n2 Fuzzy 2 Serious by Shannon and Dean Hale (2019)\n\n10 Steps to Girlfriend Status by Cynthia T.
