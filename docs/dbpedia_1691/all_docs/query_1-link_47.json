Sharp emotional focus offsets the blur afflicting people who 'wisp into memory' and jump from Puerto Rico to Bed Stuy to Lisbon to Chicago. The threat to Black lives staggers the souls of characters - and of readers. 'Tears on Tap' is a masterpiece, and the touching final stories blend with kaleidoscopic power, where intense love can rupture by the next page. But old lovers also seek one another out for a last gaze before they go blind, and the jewel-like 'Slip' offers a dazzling response to the pain of loss and solitude.\"\n\nVisitors also looked at these authors"
