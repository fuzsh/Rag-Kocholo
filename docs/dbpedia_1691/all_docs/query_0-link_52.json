This epic saga confirms her as one of our best writers.” —Maaza Mengiste, author of The Shadow King, shortlisted for the 2020 Booker Prize\n\n\"Since the publication of her first novel, Saudade, Katherine Vaz has stood out as a Portuguese American writer uniquely capable of expressing the inchoate longing of the Portuguese soul. Now, with Above the Salt, she becomes the pre-eminent voice of those of us who are part of the vast Portuguese diaspora with this visionary, immigrants' tale told through her rueful, hallucinogenic prose.\" —Michael Rezendes, Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative journalist"
