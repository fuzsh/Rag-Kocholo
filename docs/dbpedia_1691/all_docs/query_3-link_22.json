Each offers only a glimpse of a journey that a novel might actually take. But a collection of linked stories transforms the impact of the genre. The multiple takes - on a theme, a set of characters, or a place - invite us to draw links, to reassess with each new story what came before, to watch the individual glimpses coalesce into a view.\n\nKatherine Vaz achieves this broader scope in Fado and Other Stories, a first collection that won the 1997 Drue Heinz Literature Prize. Each tale revolves around the lives of Portuguese characters, most of them immigrants living in the United States; together, the tales reveal a vision of Portuguese culture. Vaz, a native Californian who teaches English at the University of California, Davis, is herself of Portuguese descent, and judging by her work, she is clearly immersed in exploring her heritage.\n\nVaz seems particularly interested in two aspects of the culture, saudade and the fado. Her first novel was in fact titled Saudade (St. Martin's, 1994), a Portuguese word which, the book tells us, is considered untranslatable but which means, by one definition, \"Yearning so intense for those who are missing, or for vanished times or places, that their absence is the most profound presence in one's life. A state of being, rather than merely a sentiment.\"\n\nIn this book, Vaz turns to the fados, the Portuguese songs of fate and longing, which, as one character observes, \"remind us that without love we will die, that the oceans are salty because the Portuguese have shed so many tears on their beaches for those they will never hold again.\" Throughout the stories, references to the fados recur. There are Coimbra-style fados, which are sung by men, and a kind called fados corridos, or running fados, because the \"melody could not be bothered to stay contented in one place for very long.\" But though there are merry fados, the ones most present here are the grieving fados, which often suggest \"what a bursting heart would sound like, if the sound could be magnified.\"\n\nYearning and fate permeate these stories, which themselves become fados of a kind. There is great variety, though, to the longings, which seem at different times obsessions, passions, consuming desires. In \"Original Sin,\" Miranda, in Castroville, California - where the artichoke is king - burn for revenge on the priest who talked her dying mother into donating the family land to the church. In \"Fado,\" Dona Xica Adelhina Costa, a widow in Lodi, longs to have her married son, brain-damaged in an accident, healed. A former soldier longs to undo the violence done to an African woman by fellow soldiers while he looked on; and a dentist desires only the young lover whose departure he dreads. The awareness of the transience of joy, a poignant aspect of Portuguese longing, is expressed in the title story by the narrator, Rosa, who recalls a childhood scene of herself sitting on the porch, holding her father's hand, as \"the first time I already missed someone I still had.\"\n\nVaz writes a dense, intricate prose well-suited to her metaphorical stories, all of which offer arresting imagery, interesting observations and inventiveness, but many of which do not entirely succeed. The inventiveness, which draws upon magic realism, is often the problem. Can a story really be too inventive? Well, yes, if the inventiveness seems mere contrivance, inserted for effect. \"The Journey of the Eyeball,\" for example, which is, as it says, a journey of an eyeball, seemed to me grotesque. The changing size of a young girl's hands does nothing to enliven one labored story, while the sudden animation of a man's nail clippings intrudes on another.\n\nYet within the context of the fado, even the weaker tales in the collection take on a larger dimension which serves them well. And those stories that do succeed work wonderfully. In my favorite, \"Undressing the Vanity Dolls,\" Vaz offers a moving tale of death, infused with the language of flowers. In \"My Hunt for King Sebastiao\" she unveils the Portuguese view of life through a young man's journey to the Azores, his father's homeland. \"Portuguese fatalism gravitates to the absolute,\" the young man, Dean, tells us before leaving California. \"In this brand of fatalism, there is a grand event allotted to each person - only one, with every other major event a consequence of that - and from this grand event will spring that person's lasting description.\" At this point, Dean believes he knows his father's grand event and that his own lies far in the future. But his journey will reconfigure what he knows. In these two stories, narrative, prose and tone are characteristically heightened, but they do not seem forced. Thoroughly involving as fiction, they also yield insight into an intriguing worldview.\n\nThe stories in Lisa Lenzo's Within the Lighted City, which won the 1997 John Simmons Short Fiction Award sponsored by the University of Iowa Press, are also - mostly - interconnected: all but two of the nine tales in this very slender volume revolve around the Zito family, in particular Annie, the only girl among five children and the narrator of almost all the tales. Set in Detroit, the stories open in 1967, when Annie is eleven years old, and move forward at several-year intervals to cover twenty years. In a broad sense, each story focuses on a point of vulnerability - for Annie or family members - though the kinds of safety and danger vary.\n\nThe earliest two stories bring to the fore the dangers of Detroit itself, as seen through the eyes of a young girl. In \"Burning,\" which takes place during the riots of 1967, Annie doubly comes of age, simultaneously beginning to menstruate and discovering that her doctor father, whom she took for granted would keep her \"safe from any sort of harm,\" won't be able to do that. In \"Self-Defense,\" which takes place after Annie, now seventeen, has been attacked by a group of forty black girls, she studies karate, only to come up against her own limitations and the realization that she will never be able to defend herself \"to the last degree.\"\n\nIn the later stories, Annie and her brothers deal with the vulnerability of the body: one brother loses his legs, Annie loses a baby, and another brother, in a violent symbolic act, annihilates the addict part of himself. In the title story, which concludes the sequence, a Christmas reunion of the entire family conveys the comforts family closeness can provide and the comforts it can't, as Annie at the age of 31, divorced and unpartnered, reflects on her oneness.\n\nIn each of these stories, Lenzo creates scenes that reveal situations with clarity. In \"Burning,\" amid the riots, Annie's liberal father confronts the cops in defense of an innocent black youngster who in turn glares at his defender with hatred. In \"The End of the Crackhead,\" as her brother burns, in effigy, the addict that he was, Annie, like her young daughter, feels that the burning figure \"is actually screaming, and not became of some unnamed agony, but with a greater and more immediate terror. because it can feel and hear the surrounding fire and knows it will be burned alive.\"\n\nSuch scenes are vivid, if sometimes too explicit. And yet the collection as a whole feels flat. When I finished reading it, I felt that something had failed to happen. Curiously, even the stories I had liked seemed, in retrospect, diminished.\n\nThe problem, I think, is that while these stories reveal situations, they do not reveal individual lives. Throughout, family members remain shadowy - even, most significantly, Annie herself. Lenzo offers no insight into Annie's brother's addiction or her father's affair, into Annie's divorce or what she wants in life beyond a partner. In the final story, when Annie says her mother has a \"genius IQ,\" it comes as a surprise since the mother has said nothing brilliant in any of the stories, and actually has said almost nothing at all. In fact, the tales convey little sense of the mother's relationship with her only daughter. This absence of character, perhaps not so glaring in a single story, becomes crucial in a collection like this. Why, after all, does Lenzo return to this family if not to chronicle their lives in some complexity over time?\n\nIt seems to me that once stories are linked, the connections not only make a broader scope possible, they demand it. If Vaz focuses all her stories on Portuguese characters and refers frequently to the fado, it would be odd if she spoke about these characters only as individuals with no ethnic context. If Lenzo focuses seven stories on a family, she leads us to expect that the sequence will provide more depth than a single story would allow. When it does not, even stories that might succeed singly fail to satisfy within the context of the whole, which becomes somewhat less than the sum of its parts."
