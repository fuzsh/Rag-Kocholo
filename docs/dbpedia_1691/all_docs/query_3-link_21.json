Not only was Obama the first non-white President; he was also a figure whose origins lay at the edge of, and beyond, the geographical boundaries of the country. Born in Hawaii—the newest state and one far removed from continental North America—Obama came from a region unfamiliar to most Americans, unless they had spent vacations there; the son of a Kenyan father and white American mother, he was a reminder of America’s origins as a nation of immigrants, but also an anomaly in a country where the overwhelming majority of African Americans are descendants of slaves. Moreover, Obama spent four years of his childhood in Jakarta, Indonesia, experiencing a life very different from the norms of the United States. In other ways, however, Obama’s biography enacts a familiar myth: the rise from a ‘broken’ home with an absent father, success in high school (interrupted by moments of crisis featuring alcohol and illicit drug use), through an education at Columbia and then Harvard Law School, to triumph in local Chicago politics and finally the Presidency epitomises the myth—if not the actuality—of the American Dream. While the road to the White House has been tougher for some than for others, with Abraham Lincoln and Bill Clinton possibly coming closest to being antecedents of Obama’s path, even the scions of wealthy, well connected families, such as George and George W. Bush, have always highlighted their populist roots in their political campaigns. Of course, Obama’s election by no means signifies the end of racism in America: jails remain disproportionately occupied by African American males, economic inequalities continue to be marked along ethnic lines and even as distinguished an African American as Harvard professor Henry Louis Gates, Jr. has, in 2009, been a victim of arrest apparently based on racial profiling as he attempted to enter his own home. And yet, in the past thirty or forty years, there have\n\nbeen a series of pronounced shifts in academic approaches to racial, ethnic and gender issues, that have called attention to the multitudinous voices constituting what Walt Whitman famously called a ‘teeming nation of nations’. For present purposes, our focus will remain on the literature and literary criticism of the period running from, roughly, the early 1970s to the present. Until then, the literary canon had been constructed around a body of white, largely male, New Yorkers and New Englanders, most notably the figures of F. O. Matthiessen’s American Renaissance (1941) and Henry James (‘The Master’). In the Twentieth Century the scope widened to include mid-Westerners such as F. Scott Fitzgerald and Ernest Hemingway, and, post-World War Two, Jewish American novelists including Saul Bellow, E. L. Doctorow and Philip Roth, who were placed alongside perpetuators of a more ‘traditional’ American literature such as John Updike, and the new voices of what would eventually be labelled ‘postmodernism’, such as Thomas Pynchon and, slightly later, Don DiLillo. While there is no doubt that Nineteenth Century writers—most notably, Whitman, Herman Melville and Mark Twain—had recognised the multicultural possibilities of America, it is the era we are concerned with in this series that changed the way the country viewed and narrated itself in literature, with multicultural fictions that often combined critical and commercial success. Doctorow’s Ragtime (1975) famously interweaves the stories of three families to rewrite the history and parody the mythology of the United States. The opening pages of the novel rapidly move from a turn-of-the-century world that seems straight out of Henry James or Edith Wharton to a sudden realization of the plurality of American life: That was the style, that was the way people lived. Women were stouter then. They visited the fleet carrying white parasols. Everyone wore white in summer. Tennis racquets were hefty and the racquet faces elliptical. There was a lot of sexual fainting. There were no Negroes. There were no immigrants. … In New York City the papers were full of the shooting of the\n\nReinaldo Francisco Silva famous architect Stanford White by Harry K. Thaw, eccentric scion of a coke and railroad fortune. Harry K. Thaw was the husband of Evelyn Nesbit, the celebrated beauty who had once been Stanford White’s mistress. The shooting took place in the roof garden of the Madison Square Garden on 26th Street, a spectacular block-long building of yellow brick and terra cotta that White himself had designed in the Sevillian style. It was the opening night of a revue entitled Mamzelle Champagne, and as the chorus sang and danced the eccentric scion wearing on this summer night a straw boater and heavy black coat pulled out a pistol and shot the famous architect three times in the head. On the roof. There were screams. Evelyn fainted. She had been a well-known artist’s model at the age of fifteen. Her underclothes were white. Her husband habitually whipped her. She happened once to meet Emma Goldman, the revolutionary. Goldman lashed her with her tongue. Apparently there were Negroes. There were immigrants. E. L. Doctorow, Ragtime (1975)\n\nAmong the many strengths of Doctorow’s novel is its ability to highlight the way that an intermingling of disparate voices—immigrant, African American and ‘white’—is at the heart of American creativity, whilst the book provides constant reminders both of the power of national mythologies such as Benjamin Franklin’s rags to riches narrative, and of just how hard it is to sustain principled opposition to this narrative in the face of the financial inducements and social opportunities offered to a few individuals. The transformation of the East European immigrant Tateh, defined by his socialism, devotion to his family and to apparently unshakable faith in core moral values into the Baron Ashkenazy, creator of movies depicting an implausibly harmonious (and immensely popular) multi-ethnic gang of American children finally reiterates Doctorow’s insistence that history has always been told by the masters, but also his belief that—by 1975—there was the possibility of other histories emerging. At least within the academic community, Doctorow was probably correct: while studies of Hawthorne, Melville and James most certainly did not disappear, they were joined by a growing corpus of\n\nPortuguese American Literature scholarship that insisted that yes, ‘there were Negroes [or ‘African Americans’]. There were immigrants.’ Books such as Jane Tompkins’s Sensational Designs (1986), Michael J. Denning’s Mechanic Accents (1987) and Russell J. Reising’s The Unusable Past (1987) assimilated and developed the work of earlier multicultural critics such as Annette Kolodny and Richard Slotkin to challenge the assertions underpinning the construction of the American canon and demand spaces for works by women novelists and the writings of African Americans and immigrants. And while the literary value of literature did at times seem to disappear from the interminable canon wars of the 1980s and 1990s (though not in the books cited above), the theoretical battles that quite often really did split departments into highly antagonistic factions in the late-Twentieth Century do seem to have resulted in a Twenty-First Century critical culture in which a return to stress on the literariness of literature lives alongside the general embrace of the fact that writing the canon is not the preserve of Ivy League white males. At the same time as the work of critics such as Tompkins and Reising recovered the long-marginalised presence of writings by women and African Americans, new generations of American writers from a plentitude of ethnic and class positions have assumed pivotal places in contemporary American literature. While there seems to be no doubt that Toni Morrison is the best known—and one of the most highly acclaimed—of these voices, she is but one figure in a literary marketplace that increasingly problematises the notion of what American literature is and the kinds of critical tools required to discuss it in any meaningful fashion. The focus on the ‘playful’, experimental postmodernism of the 1960s and 1970s has been replaced by (or, at least, joined by) a return to the search for the authentic experience of narratives of migration (both to and from the United States), of the precarious balancing of assimilation to a dominant culture and the desire to retain a culture of one’s own, and of the eternal questioning of what it means to be an ‘American’. In an increasingly ‘globalised’ community, these narratives are now as often recounted by writers from North Africa or China as by those from Eastern Europe, but most retain a faith—at some level—in the mythological prom-\n\n10 Reinaldo Francisco Silva ises of the United States that seem to have been brought to life by Barack Obama. To listen to the taxi drivers of Boston, or Austin, or San Francisco, or Denver is to hear life stories—if not quite novels— that are at once strikingly different in the details of war zones fled and disillusionment with the ‘old’ country, and an innate faith in the possibilities of a world still almost as new as that first viewed by Fitzgerald’s Dutch sailors at the end of The Great Gatsby (1925). And while contemporary American literature is as often marked by a disenchantment with the nation that can be traced through most of the nation’s literary history, this is accompanied by the sense of possibility that is heard so often in the voices of ‘ordinary’ Americans, but also by the recognition that—post-9/11—the United States is as vulnerable to external forces as are the nations left behind. The enormous diversity of American literatures currently being created ensures that a series called ‘Approaches to Contemporary American Literature’ is bound to be both eclectic and inconsistent. There is no longer even the possibility—or the desire—to create a master narrative able to ‘contain’ (to return once more to Whitman) the multitudinous voices that constitute a ‘national’ narrative. Indeed, recent approaches to the Trans- or Post-national condition would rightly question the enduring legitimacy of such a concept. This means that the series makes no claims to unfurl organically, beneath any but the broadest of themes. Books studying the emergence and development of particular hyphenated American groups are accompanied by those looking at genre, or at single authors. To study the world we live in requires tools and methodologies that may differ from those used to approach the texts of the past. What unites the books in this series is their contribution to our understanding of the here and now.\n\nChristopher Gair and Aliki Varvogli\n\nChapter One Locating the Portuguese within the Body of Emergent American Literatures Portuguese American literature written in English by American writers of Portuguese descent cannot claim a long tradition yet. Compared to similar writings focusing on other ethnic minorities in the United States of America—African American, Native American, Asian American or Latino(a)/Chicano(a) American—those dealing with the Portuguese contribution to American culture and literature emerged mostly during the last two decades of the previous century. The fact that the number of Portuguese American voices—Thomas Braga, Julian Silva, Charles Reis Felix, Frank Gaspar, and Katherine Vaz—is still quite small compared to those of other ethnic backgrounds, needs to be considered alongside the fact that not much criticism has yet been published on them. To my knowledge, Vamberto Freitas and Adelaide Batista have written about Katherine Vaz’s novel Saudade, and Alice Clemente published an article on Frank Gaspar in the Portuguese American Journal Gávea-Brown. And even though I have touched upon this issue in a previous book, Representations of the Portuguese in American Literature, and in several articles published in American journals and encyclopaedias, a full-scale, booklength analysis of this ethnic minority is long overdue. The contributions of the Portuguese to American society, economy, culture, and literature cannot remain overlooked much longer. With these writers, Portuguese American literature has come of age and does not have much in common with the earlier immigrant voices who wrote mostly in Portuguese about how America shaped them, puzzled them or even frustrated their expectations, and this, of course, for an audience back in Portugal. While this book attempts to explore the richness inherent in this field of study, it also aims at contributing to America’s understanding of its ethnic minorities—in this particular case, the Portuguese—so as to understand how much they have given\n\n12 Reinaldo Francisco Silva of themselves even though Anglos ignored or downplayed these matters in the past. Misrepresentation and negative stereotyping of the Portuguese were the dominant keywords in my first book; in this one, ethnic pride and the celebration of one’s roots shall replace these. As I have shown in Representations of the Portuguese in American Literature, Portuguese fictional characters created by native-born American writers have been negatively stereotyped. They have been depicted as bloodthirsty, mysterious and unpredictable, lustful and vicious. This book seeks to understand not how others viewed the Portuguese, but rather how the Portuguese themselves related to their ancestry. By discussing key works of poetry and fiction, I shall analyze how the Portuguese have tried to come to terms with the way in which the margins have shaped them. Chapter One offers some insight on whether the current body of Portuguese American literature compares—or not—in bulk with writings produced by writers from other ethnic backgrounds. Are some of these writings an artless reflection of immigrant nostalgia or, instead, pieces of immigrant literature written in Portuguese? Is contemporary Portuguese American literature slightly beyond an embryonic stage—as Francis Rogers, Leo Pap, Nancy Baden, and Onésimo Almeida claimed more than two decades ago—or has it already come of age? And do such voices as Katherine Vaz and Frank Gaspar really wish to be lumped into the “ethnic writer” category or just simply be considered American writers? Chapter Two focuses on three voices born in Portugal, but living in the United States, and who, among other issues, captured the cultural clash between Portuguese and American values—not in English, but in their native Portuguese. While José Rodrigues Miguéis wrote mostly short stories set in Manhattan focusing on how American consumerism and individualism negatively shaped some Portuguese immigrants, Jorge de Sena’s poems satirize American stereotypes of a sexual and puritanical nature. Onésimo Almeida, instead, has found in essay-writing (later shaped into books) an outlet to diagnose— sometimes lampooning as in Ah! Mònim dum Corisco—Portuguese immigrant life in Portuguese American communities in the USA. Chapter Three aims at analyzing Alfred Lewis as a transitional\n\nPortuguese American Literature 13 figure located somewhere between the voices discussed in chapters one and two and those in chapters four and five. By tracing his development in his earlier pieces, Home is an Island and Aguarelas Florentinas e Outras Poesias (which, in one way or another, hark back to the old country) to Sixty Acres and a Barn and some poems in Aguarelas, we notice a gradual immersion in American life and a cutting of ties with the Old World. Chapter Four focuses on a few lesser-known American voices of Portuguese descent who write in English about life in a particular Portuguese American community. Possibly the only American writer of Portuguese descent who has thoroughly explored the feelings of shame in one’s ancestral Portuguese roots and the consequences this brings is Julian Silva in his novel, The Gunnysack Castle (1981), which was recently published in Distant Music along with The Death of Mae Ramos by the University of Massachusetts, Dartmouth. The themes Thomas Braga explores in some of the poems composing Portingales range from matters related to ethnicity, the celebration of Portuguese American heroes, and how specific Portuguese values and traditions are kept alive within a dominant Anglo culture. Charles Reis Felix’s Through a Portagee Gate revolves around Charley and his father and is rendered both as autobiography and biography. In my view the Portuguese American version of Richard Rodriguez’s Hunger of Memory, this book captures the saga of Charley, the son of a blue-collar worker, who yearned for an education and had to learn how to grapple with the mainstream and the ethnic pull at school and at home, respectively. This book was followed up by Da Gama, Cary Grant, and the Election of 1934. Both offer a wide range of materials for those wishing to study the changes in New Bedford, Massachusetts, in the course of the twentieth-century, in a time when the Portuguese were a dominant group there. Finally, Chapter Five argues that Portuguese American literature has come of age. Critically acclaimed writers Frank Gaspar and Katherine Vaz are fully accommodated to the mainstream but have found in their Portuguese heritage themes worth pondering. While the number of poems focusing on Gaspar’s childhood or juvenile recollections of Provincetown, Massachusetts, are not abundant in\n\n14 Reinaldo Francisco Silva The Holyoke, they are even scarcer in his subsequent volumes of poems, Mass for the Grace of a Happy Death and A Field Guide to the Heavens. Some poems in these award-winning volumes focus on the role of Portuguese sailors in the New England whaling industry, while others focus on the ethnic garden or food and how these rituals are a means to preserve ethnic identity. In his novel, Leaving Pico, Gaspar probes deeper into his ancestral culture through Josie and his grandfather, John Joseph. Vaz, in turn, has tapped Portuguese anticlericalism and the confrontation between Old and New World values, embodied in the characters of Father Teo Eiras and Clara, to create her fictional premiere, Saudade. In Mariana she elaborates on a classical love story in Portuguese literature featuring a nun who has fallen in love with—and who spends most of her time writing letters to—a French officer. In Fado & Other Stories at least three stories focus on the saga of the Portuguese in California’s dairy industry and Hawaii’s pineapple and sugar cane plantations. The character of Dean in the story “My Hunt for King Sebastião” substantiates the “redeeming” features that Alice Clemente has noted in third generation Portuguese Americans—Gaspar and Vaz—in the sense that some of their writings are replete with “ethnic signs” (to paraphrase William Boelhower). As Portuguese American writers, Vaz and Gaspar have kicked open the door to mainstream American literature and are widely read and appreciated in America and abroad. At this stage, however, Portuguese American literature cannot compare in bulk with other emergent contemporary American literatures. Portugal is a small country and for the last five centuries—since the Age of the Discoveries in the sixteenth century—a few million individuals migrated to its former colonies in Africa and Brazil. During the twentieth century, others settled in a few West European countries, South Africa and Australia as well. But the Portuguese population in North America—the United States and Canada—has never reached the million mark. In the United States, the Portuguese have traditionally settled in southeastern New England, metropolitan New York, and New Jersey as well as in central California. During the last third of the nineteenth century, many Portuguese settled in Hawaii. It is during this period that the mass movement of the Portuguese\n\nPortuguese American Literature 15 into the United States took place, even though a smaller influx had made its way there from the early sixteenth to the mid-nineteenth century. This exodus was first triggered by the whaling industry in New England and later by the job opportunities in the local textile industry. In New England and in the Mid-Atlantic states, most of these ethnics were mill and construction workers, but in California they prospered in the dairy industry and in intensive farming. Those who went to Hawaii worked in the sugar and pineapple plantations. Most Portuguese came from the Azores and Madeira islands; others arrived from the Cape Verde islands, a Portuguese colony in Western Africa that became an independent nation after the democratic revolution in Portugal on April 25, 1974. The Continentals hailing from mainland Portugal followed them and arrived in greater numbers about a half-century later. The earlier Portuguese immigrants who arrived before World War I were predominantly illiterate and generally of peasant background. After the restrictive immigration acts of the early 1920s, Portuguese immigration to the United States waned. Since the late 1950s, the influx of Portuguese immigrants has increased, especially into southeastern New England and the Mid-Atlantic states. These were generally literate and not exclusively from a rural background as in the past. Several scholars have noted that these conditions and patterns of immigration influenced the literary output of Portuguese American writers. Compared to other ethnic literatures in the United States, Portuguese American literature can still be defined as a relatively young literature. Most of the writings pertaining to the first group of immigrants are written in a simple, unadorned style. These writings appeared in the mid 1930s and often reflect the educational level of their authors. They tend to focus on the immigrant experience. Whereas some emphasise how much they miss the Azores and its simple ways of life, others prefer to ponder their new American experience. When discussing patterns of Portuguese immigration to the United States, Nancy T. Baden notes that “in the first period, the term ‘immigrant’ is appropriate, but with the more sophisticated recent writers we find people able to enter the established ethnic community, observe, participate, and even criticize the life of the Luso-American\n\n16 Reinaldo Francisco Silva enclave and yet, simultaneously maintain their connections with the homeland” (23–24). Such is the case with the writings of Onésimo Teotónio Almeida, which appeal both to a Portuguese American audience and to audiences in continental Portugal and the Azores. The first group would include, for example, an immigrant versifier as Guilherme Silveira da Glória. He was born on the island of Pico in the Azores in 1863. Formerly a priest, he settled in Sacramento, California, and founded a Portuguese-language newspaper, A Liberdade. He published Poesias (1935) and Harpejos (1940). Some of the poems in the former collection reflect an excessive admiration for Salazar’s nationalism and right-wing dictatorship (1926–74). Arthur Vieira Ávila was born in 1888 on the island of Pico and also migrated to California. He was active in Portuguese-language journalism on the West Coast and ran a radio program. Both volumes of poetry, Desafio Radiofónico and Rimas de um Imigrante, which he collected in 1961, a year before his death, reflect his broadcasting activity, his sentimentality, and his Portuguese patriotism. Father José Reinaldo Matos, born in the North of continental Portugal in 1925, migrated to the United States in 1967 and settled in Cambridge, Massachusetts. His poems, which are more sophisticated than most by the two previous writers, reflect not only his religious fervour to the point of resembling prayers, but his nostalgia and longing for his native land. José Joaquim Baptista Brites was born in 1945 in a village in the centre of continental Portugal. He migrated to the United States in 1970 after having worked as a jet mechanic for the Portuguese national airline, and settled in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. The poems in Poemas sem Poesia focus on universal themes and are written in Portuguese. This volume includes pieces dealing with the immigrant’s experience, but do not paint the dreamland Portugal that we often encounter in poems written by the previous poets. While some of them depict reality, namely the colonial war in GuinéBissau, Angola, and Mozambique, they also touch upon the defects in the New World. Unlike contemporary American voices writing in English about their roots and Portuguese ethnicity, Brites, like Sena and Miguéis, tends to criticize aspects of American life and ways whereas voices such as Vaz, Gaspar, and Felix are fully accommo-\n\nPortuguese American Literature 17 dated to the mainstream. This volume was followed up by Imigramar (1984). According to Francis Rogers, Elvira Osorio Roll’s novel Hawaii’s Kohala Breezes (1964) is “the single most important piece of United States-Portuguese ethnic literature” (417). Roll was born in Honolulu in 1888 and became a schoolteacher. She also wrote Background: A Novel of Hawaii, which only incidentally touches upon the Portuguese in Hawaii. For Rogers, the former is the very first work focusing on American issues, and not Portuguese as in those by her predecessors. The primary importance of this book lies in the Damus family’s insistence that the Portuguese are white, that is, Caucasian, while focusing on a girl of Portuguese descent who has fallen in love with a haole, a white Anglo, and who must overcome interethnic tensions. Immigrant autobiographies written in English are Laurinda C. Andrade’s The Open Door (1968) and Lawrence Oliver’s Never Backward (1972). Andrade was born on the island of Terceira in 1899. A self-reliant, independent woman, she arrived in America in 1917, one month after the United States entered World War I. She settled in New Bedford, Massachusetts and for a while worked in the textile industry. While combating tuberculosis and using her determination and strong religious faith, she became a schoolteacher. She entered New Bedford High School in 1924 and in 1931 earned her baccalaureate from Brown University’s Pembroke College. She followed it with a Master’s from Columbia University. In 1942, she introduced bilingual education in the New Bedford public schools. Never Backward, focuses on the story of a poor, unschooled immigrant boy born on the island of Pico in 1887 who migrated to the United States in 1903. Oliver’s autobiography focuses on how he acquired an education and became a successful businessman and a leader in the Portuguese community in San Diego, California. From his house on Point Loma he had a full view of the bay first revealed to Europe in the sixteenth century by Cabrillo [João Rodrigues Cabrilho], a Portuguese navigator sailing for the Spanish crown. Although this chapter centers on ethnic pride and the celebration of one’s ancestry, John Dos Passos is an exception because he did not take any pride in his Portuguese background. Dos Passos was\n\n18 Reinaldo Francisco Silva ashamed of his ethnic background as represented by his paternal grandfather, a shoemaker who had been born on the island of Madeira. His Portuguese background was an encumbrance, something shameful which he wanted to conceal. As Monteiro has written: Dos Passos, who was one-quarter Portuguese, had identity problems from the beginning. He was born out of wedlock and even though his father later married his mother, the marriage did not take place until the boy was fifteen. Indeed, until 1912, the boy, employing his mother’s surname, was known as John Rodrigo Madison and he knew his father only as his “guardian,” and as his mother’s sometime companion. (193–94)\n\nThese feelings of shame increased when he “became aware at some point that he was one-quarter Portuguese, a fact that was magnified dramatically when he acquired his new, Portuguese surname shortly before entering Harvard College.” At Harvard, “in his sophomore year, Dos Passos elected to study Spanish even though Portuguese was also available and … immediately after graduation … sailed off to Europe to pursue his studies, not in Lisbon, but at the Centro de Estudios Historicos in Madrid.” Even the chiding of the Spanish philosopher Miguel de Unamuno that he “ought to be ashamed at not knowing Portuguese” failed to spark his interest in the language. The problem, of course, was that Dos Passos was living in the heyday of racial segregation, in a country whose official discourse reiterated the virtues of assimilation. Dos Passos was evidently uneasy about being (his words) “‘a quarter-Dago,’” for “that was considered somewhat disreputable in those days.” In electing to study Spanish, Monteiro further argues that Dos Passos “was symbolically rejecting his Portuguese heritage” (193–94). Monteiro has also noted that Dos Passos may have been inhibited from writing about Portugal and its people because of the politics of the day and his opposition to the Fascist government led by Salazar. Dos Passos’s “Portuguese ancestry was more of an encumbrance to be suffered quietly than a proud heritage worthy of proclamation” (196). Leo Pap, in his article, “Portuguese-American Literature,” is not sure whether he should include Dos Passos in his list of Portuguese writings even if:\n\nPortuguese American Literature 19 In his later years … Dos Passos manifested a strong interest (not atypical of second-or third-generation ethnics) in his one-fourth Portuguese descent. In 1969, one year before his death, he published The Portugal Story: Three Centuries of Exploration and Discovery, an overall history of Portugal for the general public. (192)\n\nDos Passos reacted in such a way because the period when he came of age as an important figure in American literature (during most of the first half of the twentieth-century) instilled into people’s minds the virtues of assimilation. It is no surprise that individuals with qualms about their ancestry would attempt to comply with this norm. John Dos Passos was undoubtedly shaped by this ideology and he seems never to have questioned it. The history book of his later career, however, is a reflection of his recognition and acceptance of Otherness, which was only possible thanks to the Civil Rights movement of the time. Dos Passos’s late ethnic awareness has opened the doors to his inclusion in the “Redeeming” or third generation, which Alice Clemente regards as being composed by those “who seek to reclaim their ethnicity at the same time that they retain their place in the dominant society” (25). John Dos Passos and John Phillip Sousa, a writer and a composer, are the two central figures in American culture who are exceptions rather than the norm in respect of their reaction to their Portuguese ethnic background. Back then, publicly upholding one’s ethnic background was an obstacle to breaking into the Anglo cultural mainstream. Both men stand as symbols of ethnically dispossessed people due to the pressures mainstream American culture placed on its nonAnglo citizens, especially on those with artistic yearnings. More recent writers have not disregarded their ethnic background. They have seen in their heritage a richness worth writing about. Such is the case of the writers whose works will be discussed in the following chapters. They have found in their status as hybrid or hyphenated Americans experiences worth pondering. And it is writers such as these—not most of the mainstream, native-born writers I have discussed in Representations of the Portuguese in American Literature—who can best write about their ancestral culture. These\n\n20 Reinaldo Francisco Silva Portuguese or Portuguese American voices are the ones who can best uncover and give shape to life in Portuguese American communities. Instead of peripheral observers, they are intensely absorbed in the realities in the immigrant communities. Instead of sketchy renditions, these writers’ accounts are replete with Portuguese American themes. That is why we should recall Mary Dearborn’s insight on this matter. She believes that the ethnic and cultural “outsider can best represent what it means to exist within American culture” and that the “literature by and about those who seem to be on the edges of American culture can perhaps best represent what happens within that culture” (4–5). Moreover, Dearborn is saying that we must look into the margins since what we will encounter there is, in essence, American culture. In my view, such an argument was unheard of in the days when American culture was synonymous with WASP culture. In his foreword to William Boelhower’s, Through a Glass Darkly: Ethnic Semiosis in American Literature, Werner Sollors, too, claims that “ethnic writing is American writing,” not a separate category (3). Misrepresentation of ethnic minorities, contemporary scholars contend, has been a feature of Anglo-American literature. This has been a common practice in the United States and, as postcolonial theorists such as Edward Said and Frantz Fanon have noted, a trait which does not only belong to colonialism, but also a reality in societies where minority cultures have co-existed with the dominant, mainstream culture. The urge to speak out is one of the most distinctive traits of contemporary ethnic literature in the United States—and this also applies to Portuguese American writers. Portuguese American themes can no longer remain unaddressed. In my view, Anglo-American literature has gradually lost its power to dominate after, say, the middle of the twentieth-century. Tired of dealing with mainstream white culture, bell hooks maintains that within “commodity culture, ethnicity becomes spice, seasoning that can liven up” this “dull dish” (21). On this issue, Spivak demands that “ethnics speak for themselves” (40). In this book, my goal is to show that Portuguese American voices have also felt this need in their writings. Before moving on to the analysis of individual writers and the texts\n\nPortuguese American Literature 21 where the Portuguese are seen grappling with what for them look like a whole new set of cultural and social challenges, while, at the same time, holding on to their native culture, we should dwell briefly on an important matter. Is there a body of Portuguese American literature with similar importance to, let us say, African American literature, Chicano/a literature, Jewish American literature, Native American literature, or even Asian American literature? Can the writers in America with a Portuguese background claim a similar recognition to, for example, that held by Toni Morrison, Rudolfo Anaya, Philip Roth, Louise Erdrich, or Maxine Hong Kingston, to name a few? Or are the voices and texts that we shall examine further in this book an artless reflection of immigrant nostalgia and homesickness? Or even examples of immigrant literature written in Portuguese? Have the writings about the Portuguese experience within American culture reached the same level of development and maturity as those by the writers just alluded to? These are exactly the issues I will focus on in the next few pages. It is simply impossible to embark on a serious discussion of what this book proposes to accomplish without a preliminary statement on the nature of the texts and voices which have written them. In other words, we need to set a framework for the field and show the ways in which it is different from other bodies of ethnic writing. In an essay titled “A Literatura Emigrante Portuguesa na Califórnia” (“Portuguese Immigrant Literature in California”), published in 1983, Eduardo Mayone Dias points out that “the body of writings with a Portuguese sensitivity written on American soil is still not much beyond an embryonic stage.” Moreover, if one were to compare these writings to other ethnic literatures, Portuguese Americans have not yet achieved “the quality of the fictional literature produced by the second generation … encounter[ed] …— among many others—the so-called Italian-American or Mexican-American groups” (my translation; 470–71). This quote may answer some of the questions raised in the previous page, but the state of Portuguese American literature today is not the same as Dias outlined it two decades ago. In an interview conducted by Nancy T. Baden and now recorded in the transcript with the title “A Literatura Luso-Americana: Que\n\n22 Reinaldo Francisco Silva Futuro?—Uma Mesa Redonda” (“The Future of Portuguese-American Literature: A Round Table Discussion”), published in 1981, one of her interviewees, Onésimo T. Almeida, when asked about the possibility of the emergence of a Portuguese American ethnic literature, observed that there “may come into existence a literature written in the English language, but in that case it shall certainly accommodate itself within the canons of American literature. Ethnic, at least.” Almeida goes on to note of: such a potential literature written in the English language and focusing on the Portuguese immigrant experience, that it shall either have to achieve such a good literary quality to claim its right in belonging to the American literary canon or that it shall have to settle for the status of a body of minor works with merely some sociological, historical, and ethnographic value (my translation; 26).\n\nIn another essay, “The Contribution by Americans of Portuguese Descent to the U.S. Literary Scene,” published in 1978, Francis M. Rogers defines ethnic literature as: a literature of maturity. Almost by definition, ethnic literature normally has to be written by immigrants resident here for many years and by descendants born here. The ethnic literature of Americans of Portuguese descent and birth forms part of American literature, not of Portuguese literature. It treats American problems, not Portuguese problems. (425)\n\nAt the time of Rogers’ definition, there was not much written about and by the Portuguese in the English language; that is, most of what had been written about the Portuguese experience in the United States was in the Portuguese language. As noted earlier, compared to other ethnic groups, the Portuguese have not been living in America as long and in such substantial numbers as other ethnic minorities, but they, too, would witness the emergence of their own writings in English as has been the case in the past few years. Such a relatively short period of Portuguese settlement in the United States, however, is not the foremost reason for an overall lack of Portuguese American ethnic literature. Eduardo M.\n\nPortuguese American Literature 23 Dias, also interviewed by Baden, has pointed out in his discussion of Portuguese emigration to America at the end of the nineteenth century and at the beginning of the twentieth century that: Statistics prove … that eighty percent of the Portuguese population at that time was illiterate…. Because of the overall rural nature of our immigrants, the pragmatical, utilitarian inclinations that even nowadays our immigrants evince, it does not surprise me that there is a certain disdain … for cultural manifestations. (Quoted in Duarte 26–29)\n\nIn most Portuguese communities, he has noticed “a lot of hostility, at many levels, towards any activity of a cultural nature.” To illustrate his point, he recalls a story told by one of his students, who was collecting information on folklore and, one day … knocked on the door of an old woman and asked her if she knew any folk tales. The woman almost slammed the door on his face, saying this to him: “Why don’t you go and find a job, young man?! Put stories aside!” (My translation; quoted in Duarte 29–30).\n\nIn “Portuguese-American Literature: Does it Exist?,” published in 1979, Nancy Baden lists a few additional reasons for the scarcity of Portuguese American fiction and this by way of responding to what Rogers said on this matter. In this essay, Baden raises a pertinent issue: The next question for the study of the Portuguese-American contribution is why so little and why so late? … Indeed, the Portuguese have been here for over a century, enough time to have produced a more developed literature. In looking to causal factors, Rogers points to the relative smallness of the community and the general lack of education.\n\nFor Baden, the scarcity of Portuguese American writings is due to patterns of settlement since: the Portuguese have not been concentrated in the ghetto - like situation in which one lives exclusively the “ethnic” experience as have blacks, Puerto Ricans, and Chicanos. In addition, with the exception of the Cape Verdeans, most of the immigrants have\n\n24 Reinaldo Francisco Silva been light-skinned and have melted into the general population and been absorbed as other European groups have been. (27)\n\nThis quote stresses the rapid assimilation of the Portuguese into the mainstream except in the case of Capeverdeans, who thus gave a skewed visibility to what Portuguese as a group would be. Unlike, for example, the Hispanics, most Portuguese have not wished to be classified as “unmeltable,” thus refraining from identifying with a group that would fall in that category due to “American racism.” In the article cited earlier, Rogers even suggests that any creative or artistic impulses the Portuguese may have harboured were stifled if not completely crushed by the fear of exclusion. In other words, Portuguese artists and writers may have shied away from expressing themselves because of the: deleterious effect on the Portuguese immigrants and their descendants of American racism, of a tendency of the past especially prevalent in New England to note that most Cape Verdeans were of mixed African-European origin or were black while yet of Portuguese nationality and to conclude that all Portuguese were nonwhite and ipso facto inferior. This noting was not merely oral but very often expressed in writing in works of American literature. (427)\n\nOne may argue that this is not a justification for a given writer to stop writing, but the truth is that, for example, Dos Passos was well aware of the encumbrance his ethnic background represented to him. He was writing in a time when America’s rhetoric reiterated the benefits of assimilation. In addition, the smallness of the receiving audience for authentic ethnic experience was discouraging for any writer in his circumstances, to say the least. In “Portuguese-American Literature,” Leo Pap notices a few glimmers of hope for this emerging ethnic literature, one which might eventually become more elaborate after having, like other ethnic literatures, completed the cycle of development. At the very end of his study, Pap concludes that: Much of the material cited, the greater part written in Portuguese rather than in English, does reflect the typical immigrant expe-\n\nPortuguese American Literature 25 rience, often nostalgically harking back to Portugal, but just as often revealing a growing concern with and for America. (195)\n\nIn a more recent article, “Duas Décadas de Literatura LusoAmericana: Um Balanço (1978–1998)” (“Two Decades of Portuguese American Literature: An Assessment (1978–1998),” (1998), Onésimo T. Almeida argues that during this period, “little or nothing has changed during practically these two decades, in the overall scenario regarding the main issues raised in [Baden’s article] what concerns the existence, status, and future of Portuguese-American literature” (my translation; 327). I do not agree with this view even if Almeida notes some of the earlier work of Thomas Braga, Frank Gaspar, and Katherine Vaz—without any attempt at analyzing it either. Moreover, much changed in the three years following the publication of this article. The number of participants, papers, and readings by Portuguese American voices during the conference, “Portuguese-American Literature: The First One-Hundred Years,” held at Yale University, April 14–15, 2001 is, in my opinion, evidence of such a change. What these various opinions show is that Portuguese American ethnic literature is only slightly beyond an embryonic stage, still undergoing a process of development. The sample of authors assembled for discussion in this book, however, is intended to dispute this. While all of these writers show a concern for what it means to be a Portuguese living at the margins of the American mainstream, they do not necessarily choose the same language to convey this matter. Whereas a few writers resort to the Portuguese language, others elect both Portuguese and English, while still others exclusively use the English language. What this reflects is a gradual, steady movement towards a truly ethnic fiction in the English language in America. In other words, I would argue that the poems of writers like Thomas Braga and Frank Gaspar as well as the fiction of Julian Silva, Gaspar, Katherine Vaz, and Charles Reis Felix are far more ethnic than the immigrant writings in Portuguese of writers like José Rodrigues Miguéis, Jorge de Sena, and Onésimo T. Almeida. The writings of Silva, Braga, Gaspar, Vaz, and Felix are examples of ethnicity in American literature as defined by the traits constituting such a mode of writing. What all these voices have in common is their sense of\n\n26 Reinaldo Francisco Silva puzzlement, fascination, and frustration when reacting to the culture of their country of adoption or birth: the United States of America. Furthermore, instead of sketchy, superficial renditions of what lies beneath the skin of a Portuguese individual, with these writers, at least, we get a first-hand account of Portuguese people, their ways, and culture. These writers—not those analyzed in most of Representations of the Portuguese in American Literature—are the ones I find knowledgeable in terms of how they have dealt with Portuguese American matters.\n\nChapter Two America Through the Eyes of the Educated Immigrant: José Rodrigues Miguéis, Jorge de Sena and Onésimo T. Almeida This chapter focuses on three Portuguese authors living in the United States who, among other issues, captured the cultural clash between Portuguese and American values—not in English, but in their native Portuguese. Although prolific, their writings on this particular theme are often short. Providing a detailed analysis of Miguéis’s short stories, Sena’s small poems or even Almeida’s one or two page essays is an unrewarding task because these materials do not have the breadth of a novel written by, say, Julian Silva, Charles Felix, Katherine Vaz or even Frank Gaspar. José Rodrigues Miguéis (1901–80) is a man who writes about how the United States has shaped the way of thinking of its Portuguese immigrants. In his stories dealing with the cultural clash between Portuguese and American values, Miguéis has placed his continental Portuguese characters within an American setting, mostly in New York City. Although Miguéis spent most of his life in the United States, he has written in Portuguese and, in so doing, he has guaranteed that his writings have been practically unnoticed by American readers. In “Portuguese-American Literature” (1983), Leo Pap notes why Miguéis was more attached to the Portuguese language and why he chose to remain on the periphery, even though he spent more than half of his life away from Portugal. The writings of Miguéis dealing with Portuguese immigrant life in America are all in the form of short stories. While most of them are based on real occurrences, a few are only lightly fictionalized. Written in a simple and objective style, most stories express a big concern for social justice and are imbued with a certain sadness, while denouncing human exploitation\n\n28 Reinaldo Francisco Silva (192–93). While he received little recognition in the past in Portugal due to his political views during the Salazar régime, such is not the case today. In his foreword to the American edition of Steerage and Ten Other Stories, George Monteiro has even gone as far as to compare Miguéis to Steinbeck, such was their concern for social issues (14–15). Most prominent of these are the conflicts between the proletariat and the industrial/rural tycoons, matters which Miguéis explores in some of his short stories. Having lived for so many years in the United States, Miguéis was familiar with the works of most renowned American voices of his time, and in particular with Steinbeck. Like Steinbeck, he denounced social injustices and the plight of the socially dispossessed. And even though he was exploring some of these issues in America, Miguéis was engaged in a transatlantic dialogue with the Portuguese writers of his generation—especially those belonging to the neo-realismo (new realism) movement such as Soeiro Pereira Gomes and Alves Redol, who wrote about the exploitation of peasants, factory workers, and fishermen in such works as Gaibéus and Esteiros. Miguéis’s novel, O Pão Não Cai do Céu, published posthumously in 1981, is a case in point. Onésimo T. Almeida has also argued that Miguéis did not write for an American audience, a decision which destroyed the possibility of his fiction being more widely known in American literary circles. According to Almeida, practically “all the references to America and to the theme of immigration in the works of Miguéis are addressed to his reading public in Portugal” (my translation; quoted in Duarte 24). The comments Eduardo Mayone Dias makes on these particular writings further stress the cultural and psychological shock any Portuguese immigrant experiences on American soil. Dias points out that some of Miguéis’ fiction deals with the “theme of enchantment—or disappointment—with the new environment” (my translation; 217). In the stories analyzed in the following pages, my aim is to assess the ways in which Miguéis’s fiction dealing with the Portuguese American experience criticizes how some of these immigrants reacted to American culture and ways. Miguéis wishes to denounce American materialism and the consumerism which has\n\nPortuguese American Literature 29 produced grotesque and unpleasant individuals who now spend their time scorning their ethnic background and country of origin. “Gente da Terceira Classe” (“Steerage”) is, for example, a vivid substantiation of these attitudes. Basically, it is a story (more appropriately, a travel log of 1935) that describes the voyage from Lisbon to the United States, via Southampton, and the horrifying conditions Portuguese and Spanish emigrants have to endure since they cannot afford a first- or second-class ticket. The story, however, is more than a mere description of the conditions on board these transatlantic ships. Miguéis wants it to stand as an example of his concern for the changes experienced by some Portuguese in America. As the following quote indicates, he is shocked to learn that their misappropriations of specific American cultural values have shaped these immigrants into materialistic, arrogant, and disdainful individuals, especially towards their own compatriots. The manner in which he conveys this belief is through the story’s narrator, specifically through his attitude towards the Portuguese nouveaux-riches produced by America. Here are a few concrete examples of the people Miguéis finds completely distasteful: They belong to that category of people who talk only about land, boundaries, crops, leases, rents, agreements; and they talk about electrification and improvement, which one of them calls “improvimentos,” a Luso-Americanism. They are loquacious, emphatic, even like those fly-by-night Ph.D.s (they are aping them, surely), especially when, in a Portuguese tongue corrupted by poor American English, they praise the material greatness of their adopted country, because they are ignorant of any of that country’s other virtues, or the progress they have just come upon in their mother country (168).\n\nOr the other one who is: returning now to Massachusetts, full of himself, ready to accumulate more “dolas” so that he can buy more land, to fill out his “prop’ties,” evict the poor, rival the powerful, dazzle them, put up a “modern” house that will wreak havoc with the character of his village. He is the very type of the poor man who was born to be a rich man, or of the rich man who was born by mistake; he\n\n30 Reinaldo Francisco Silva is of the essence of that mediocrity which aspires to power. He is surely the president or secretary of some club or communal society, where these licensed swindlers gather together herds of poor fools the better to talk to them of Camões, whom they’ve never read, and to reach into their pockets. A greedy, furtive, shifty yokel, he is the very opposite of the bucolic rustic of legendry. His obsequious eyes weigh out all of nature in inventories and shares; his soul is made up of scraps of property and bits of land. (170)\n\nMiguéis concludes his analysis of the abhorrence he feels for such grotesque figures shaped by American materialism in the following manner: Looking at these people, I sometimes wonder, in anguish, if the People exist, if they actually exist. All that in them which was originally crude and boorish has been aggravated and accentuated in the brutal ambience they encountered; and they gained nothing of the spiritual values that America had to offer them. How much longer will the simple and deprived people continue to confuse civilization with the purely material values of acquisition? When will they learn that, without spiritual values, without principles, everything else is chaos? (172)\n\nAlthough there are well-known and vilified types in Portuguese society, this is a story about Portuguese immigrants in America. In the nineteen thirties, their villages of origin were lacking in the material resources that awaited them in America. Miguéis continues more or less in the same vein in the story titled “Pouca Sorte com Barbeiros” (“Not Much Luck with Barbers”), especially when the narrator confesses why he decided to sail to America, even though, at the time, he was not impressed with its image in Portugal, either: At the time, America had a horrible reputation in Portugal: a land of gangsters, of racketeers, of unscrupulous politicians. Only the pioneers like me dared to face that desert of the Spirit, where violence, fraud, and corruption ruled, and where the immigrants became beast-like, sunk in an orgy of material satisfactions (109).\n\nPortuguese American Literature 31 As both a literary and sociological piece, this story captures the tumultuous years while Prohibition was taking hold and further emphasizes Miguéis’ view of how America’s materialism changes the illinformed immigrant. In “O Cosme de Riba-Douro” (“Cosme”), we get another view of America as seen through the eyes of an illegal Portuguese immigrant residing in Manhattan, who is willing to die for freedom, democracy, and America in World War II. What is also worth noticing is his perception of America and his sense of frustration when realizing that America, after all, was not the El Dorado he had initially thought it to be. Such a view was, perhaps, conveyed by the flashy, nouveaux-riche immigrants when they returned from the United States. He has learned that it is only through hard work and determination that immigrants can make their American dream come true: One day I heard someone talking about America. Gold was so plentiful one could trip over it, food was abundant, the work was easy, and the workers rode everywhere in automobiles. It was enough to make a saint’s mouth water. I couldn’t sleep a wink that night. I couldn’t get that image out of my head. I didn’t have a moment’s rest from then on until I left home. But I waited years. Gold is something I’ve never seen here. It’s well guarded. Work, certainly, on the highways and bridges (57).\n\nIn this story, America, after all, is neither El Dorado nor the land of opportunities, especially since the Great Depression which brought about many social problems, as Cosme has come to realize: Don’t think that abundance is the only thing I like about this land: That’s important, but it’s not everything. I don’t close my eyes to what’s going on around me. I know there are lines of unemployed persons waiting for a cup of soup or coffee, rackets, dirty politics, and all the rest. There’s all that and more. That’s America (58).\n\nPerhaps in no other short story is Miguéis’ criticism of social injustices in America as bitter as is the case in “Bowery ’64,” a story published in 1983 in O Espelho Poliédrico. Here, he openly criticizes American politicians for allowing the gap between the rich and the\n\n32 Reinaldo Francisco Silva poor to become so wide. Monteiro’s comparison between Miguéis and John Steinbeck is justified since Steinbeck, too, used his fiction not only to denounce but also explore the unfair situations in American society in such works as In Dubious Battle, Cannery Row or even The Grapes of Wrath. Miguéis, like Steinbeck, used literature and artistic creation to expose social injustices in America, perpetuating a fin-de-siècle school of writing initiated by muckraking journalists, which listed influential voices such as those of Upton Sinclair. Miguéis simply cannot understand how such a rich and powerful country allows such striking contrasts between its citizens, especially in New York City, the world’s financial capital. His view is that Americans dislike what they perceive as too liberal or Marxist social demands. In other words, many Americans dislike egalitarian or leveling legislation or even programmes of social welfare for all. When it comes to social programmes, Miguéis, however, views America as an insensitive country, especially in its disdain towards the world of trade unions, the collective contract, minimum wage, the work schedule, double pay, pension plans, unemployment benefits, sick pay or disability, the guarantees and benefits that other men, through daring and much sacrifice – often paying with their own freedom and lives—somehow—managed to conquer for the exploited and oppressed.\n\nThis “collectivism,” Miguéis further notes, goes against their nature, it invades their own privacy and restricts their personal freedom, in essence, their Anglo-Saxon pride. They do not want to be considered as the protégés of Society and do not wish that it protect them as a mother …. They prefer to believe and claim that they live as free people and die freely than depend on the Government, Welfare or a Trade Union which, in their view, exploit them and take their initiatives away from them (211; my translation).\n\nIn this passage, Miguéis is referring to the period in America around the Great Depression, before the social programmes implemented by President Roosevelt, and he is endorsing what most Americans would consider as Marxist ideology. Moreover, Miguéis is horrified with\n\nPortuguese American Literature 33 the notion that such a powerful and rich country allows millions and millions of its citizens to live below the poverty-line, completely at the mercy of the indifferent few who prey upon them. In the context of such a harsh reality, one cannot even imagine the poor, illiterate, and politically-disenfranchised Portuguese immigrant actively demonstrating for the implementation of these social programmes when they were denied to the American-born. The result would, inevitably, be like the one we witness in Edward McSorley’s novel, The Young McDermott (1949). Most of the Portuguese fictional characters Miguéis has created in his Manhattan settings have come to understand that resignation is their only means of coping with this situation. The narrators in these stories, which Leo Pap considers as “only thinly fictionalized” (193) are, in my view, often the voices through which Miguéis reacts and even questions some of the beliefs endorsed by the prevailing capitalist work ethic. What these stories further stress is that such an educated immigrant as Miguéis does not relinquish his right to criticize what he finds problematic in his country of adoption. Unlike Miguéis, Jorge de Sena (1919–78) was not only a writer, but also a literary critic and a scholar who taught, at first, at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, and, afterwards, at the University of California, Santa Barbara. They both chose to write about America in Portuguese. In the case of Sena, his impressions of America have been collected in Sequências, published posthumously by his wife, Mécia de Sena. In this volume are collected the poems about Brazil (a country he went to for asylum and of which he also became a citizen prior to emigrating to the United States) and his “American” poems in a section titled, “América, América, I Love You.” Onésimo Almeida has noted that Sena’s contacts with the Portuguese communities in America were minimal and superficial. This is mostly because of the distance between these communities and the campuses where he had taught. “In the light of all these circumstances,” Almeida notes, “it is no surprise that Jorge de Sena did not have many opportunities to really get to know the Portuguese communities in America. His sporadic appearances in conferences or Portuguese festivities were insufficient for him to penetrate into the immigrant’s\n\n34 Reinaldo Francisco Silva milieu” (L(USA)lândia—a Décima Ilha 199). In addition, Almeida questions Sena’s immersion in American society, noting that his poems in the sequence, “América, América, I Love You” tend to be superficial, naïve, and weak. An important name in contemporary Portuguese literature, Sena, Almeida observes as he paraphrases the classical Roman poet Terence, belongs to a group of “gods of poetry” who have also written “poems of clay” (L(USA)lândia 207). In an interview conducted by Eugénio Lisboa, Sena reiterates his point of view regarding the ideal Portuguese immigrant in America— or any other country—in that he or she should delve into American society and ways and, as much as possible, refrain from interacting with other Portuguese immigrants or even Portuguese Americans. These Portuguese immigrants, Sena states, should be forbidden from engaging in “collective sardine barbecues, cooking codfish with such patriotic fervor, or eagerly exchanging with one another the latest news from the Chiado” in Lisbon (417; my translation). This quote emphasizes his aloofness from Portuguese contacts in America, but, as his poems in this sequence also show, his immersion in American society was not as profound as he wished it to be. Francisco Cota Fagundes has noted that “the majority of Sena’s poems about emigration—as opposed to those about exile—are poems characterized as belonging to the spectator phase” (208; my translation). In my view, this is a correct assessment of Sena’s poems about America even if he does not problematize the issues he raises in these pieces. On the one hand, I aim at focusing on Sena’s “American” poems so as to note the ways in which an educated Portuguese immigrant reacted to American culture and ways, offering, so to speak, the other side of the debate which the writers discussed in chapters two through five of Representations of the Portuguese in American Literature did not make available. On the other hand, it is possible to argue that in Sena’s poems we witness the ways in which a Portuguese writer sees Americans in general. In many of these, for example, Sena satirizes the stereotypes surrounding American attitudes towards sexuality and how its puritanical heritage has shaped them. In addition, in some of these, Sena also aims at showing the liberal side of America, namely sexual promiscuity, homosexuality, and America’s attraction\n\nPortuguese American Literature 35 for the naked body. These are aspects which Sena updates, but which are already present in Walt Whitman’s Leaves of Grass, especially in the “Calamus” and “Children of Adam” sections. Sena’s poems dealing with sexuality are his way of portraying the conservative and liberal sides of a country of excesses and antagonisms. The poem, “O Culto da Virgindade” (“The Cult of Virginity”), which I quote in full, supports both trends: That one already screwed with all the guys. But the first one who arrives, after being seduced, will never know for sure if she, excited, in triumphal despair, will scream for help (my translation 107).\n\nThe liberal side of American sexual mores is further reflected in such poems as, “As Peúgas” (“The Pair of Socks”), which deals with the theme of homosexuality in that one of the female guests, who had forgotten her pack of cigarettes, returns to the host’s house, to find him and another guest, stretched naked, on the carpet. She steps back, aghast. “Pelo Buraco Aberto Pacientemente” (“The Glory Hole”) uncovers masculine voyeurism and anonymous gay sex. On the other side of the spectrum, the poem “Marido e Mulher” (“Husband and Wife”) portrays a newly-married couple, who having purchased a special pillow and sex manual, engage in sexual intercourse. The wife’s mother, who disliked her son-in-law, steps into their room, and calls the police. The poem ends with the male subject being sentenced to two years’ treatment in a psychiatric institution for having viciously attempted against “his wife’s virtue” (my translation; 99). What is intriguing about some of these poems, Fagundes notes, is that they are largely based on what he views as “impressions which had not been witnessed, that is, these are circumstantial poems without any circumstance, in that they stem from well-known American stereotypes, especially those related to or with a puritanical tendency” (my translation 212). The other poems in this section satirize aspects of American life, culture, and society. The poem, “O Direito Sagrado” (“The Sacred Right”) attacks the sacrosanct belief in private property. The male\n\n36 Reinaldo Francisco Silva subject in this poem is so obsessed with protecting his property and the wildlife in it from trespassers that he goes as far as to place deadly traps around it. Over time, children, hunters, and incautious lovers are killed. He is never convicted. This poem further stresses how some Americans evince a pathological love for animals and animal rights at the expense of human beings. The poem, “Ser Tratado Pelo Nome” (“On a First-Name Basis”) criticizes how certain Americans informally treat each other on a first-name basis and in a friendly manner. Friendships which had lasted for years suddenly end when someone has to relocate to another part of the country, most of the time, without a good-bye or address where he or she may be reached. While many poems criticize America’s conspicuous consumption, the poem “Doença Urgente” (“Sudden Illness”) criticizes how most hospitals in America do not admit a given patient without financial guarantees or insurance coverage. As noted earlier, it is possible to see in these poems a poetic voice which is not well immersed in American reality since several of these pieces have evolved from stereotypes and generalizations about American ways and life. None or very few of these poems seem to come from personal, first-hand experience. Some of the occurrences alluded to in these poems look as if they, over time, had been clipped by Sena from newspapers and, afterwards, caricatured and satirized. Although they try to flesh out a few aspects which are quintessentially American (obsession with private property and trespassing), these pieces do not strike me as possessing any references to or descriptions of real people or situations. In my view, they do not amount to more than generalizations without an individualized, human face. Or, to bring my analysis of Sena’s “American” poems to a close, in what ways do these generalizations and stereotypes reflect what Fagundes diagnoses when asking himself about how much of the motivation and themes in these spectator poems are actually imbued with a sense of alienation on the part of the poetic subject, an alienation which comes about from the pathological condition social psychologists often refer to as a cultural clash. (My translation 214)\n\n“América, América, I Love You” leads us on a trip through the eccen-\n\nPortuguese American Literature 37 tricities and excesses in American life as seen by Sena, an educated and well-travelled man, but it also conveys to us how his professed love for America was ironic and caustic. A first-generation immigrant, dry academic who remained at the margins of mainstream American culture, Sena’s peripheral, marginal status enabled him to criticize America—if not in English, at least in the Portuguese language for a Portuguese audience back home. Onésimo Teotónio Almeida was born in 1946 on the island of São Miguel (St. Michael), in the Azores. He was educated in the Azores, Lisbon, and the United States and is currently on the faculty of Brown University. An enthusiast for Portuguese bilingual programmes on the East Coast, he was aware of the problems affecting the Portuguese communities. He is credited with having initiated Gávea-Brown, a bilingual journal of Portuguese American letters and studies. His first volume of essays, Da Vida Quotidiana na LUSAlândia, was published in Portugal in 1975. Originally a series of articles published between January 1973 and April 1975 for the Portuguese Times of New Bedford, Massachusetts, these pieces reflect on specific occurrences in Portugal, the United States, as well as in a few Portuguese communities—especially in New England. While offering an acute analysis of Portuguese immigrant life, these short pieces capture the ambiance in Portugal before and after the democratic revolution of April 25, 1974. Living and writing in democratic America, a nation keen on freedom of speech, enabled him freely to criticize Salazar’s dictatorship, its politics of terror perpetuated by the secret police, the PIDE, and the régime’s financing of the colonial war in Africa. While the democratic revolution was underway, Almeida’s pieces successfully captured the mood of anxiety and expectation evinced by most Portuguese immigrants in America as they sensed another totalitarian régime—communism—emerge in their native country. Witnessing from afar the movement for independence in the Azores, these immigrants poignantly came to the realization that the world they left behind was slowly disintegrating. On the American front, Almeida criticizes the war in Vietnam, the Nixon administration and its Watergate scandal, and notes how the energy crisis of 1973 affected the US economy and the sacrosanct mobility of most Americans. In another section,\n\n38 Reinaldo Francisco Silva Almeida shows how these immigrants’ uncritical ways in America were a by-product of fascist politics experienced in Portugal prior to emigrating to the USA; their perseverance and hard work when trying to secure the economic conditions for survival; their resilience when coping with economic exploitation at the workplace; and their inability to fight for better working conditions. Prompted by the dizzying political changes after the democratic revolution, issues centering on life in the Portuguese communities in America were not as paramount to him as the changes sweeping through Portugal. Ah! Mònim dum Corisco (1978) contains a series of sketches focusing on the immigrant experience in the United States, more specifically in LUSAlândia, a word coined by Almeida in the work discussed above. In his acute analysis of this community’s adaptation to life in a new environment, the author highlights these immigrants’ speech patterns and how they blend or coin new words—which are neither Portuguese nor English—and that only they understand. Almeida goes on to satirize the cultural gap between a returning immigrant family on vacation in the Azores and another one who has never left. Another sketch criticizes the Portuguese bilingual programmes taught by second- and third-generation teachers of Portuguese descent whose mastery of Portuguese is weak. Another one satirizes the controversy surrounding the Dighton rock, on the margins of Taunton River, in Massachusetts, allegedly discovered, as Dr. Luciano Silva notes, in 1511 by a Portuguese navigator, Miguel Corte-Real. In yet another sketch, the play lampoons Francis Rogers’s book, Americans of Portuguese Descent: A Lesson in Differentiation (1974) so as to discredit the author’s eagerness to attribute Portuguese ancestry to Peter Francisco, a hero in the American Revolution, when very little was known about his past and country of origin. With a profusion of sketches replete with sexual innuendoes, the play ridicules the makeshift ways and attitudes of several Portuguese individuals as is the case in the episode with the Portuguese immigrant who was caught speeding on the highway and how he managed to avoid a ticket due to the language barrier. This work is structured along the conventions of the popular Portuguese teatro de revista, a mixture of popular theatre and the contemporary musical review. These performances in the\n\nPortuguese American Literature 39 Lisbon theatre neighbourhood, the Parque Mayer, abound with social and political criticism. In Ah! Mònim dum Corisco the author applies this framework to a Portuguese American reality. A selection of tales from (Sapa)teia Americana (1983) was recently published in English as Tales From the Tenth Island (2006). The original work in Portuguese contains twenty stories while the English title, which contains a selection of the best stories, includes only eight. Compared to Almeida’s previous titles, these stories also reflect on the immigrant experience in America, but are heavily fictionalized. “Friday, Holy Friday” focuses on the character of Mateus Queimado (or old Silva), a hard working man who, through time, amassed a substantial amount of money and real estate but, in the end, learns that there is no point in a life of toil, of living for payday on Friday afternoons. Even if he has travelled to Hawaii, the Azores, and Florida, there is something missing in America and he does not know exactly what it is. Whether the response lies in his feelings of uprootedness, alienation, or impersonal relationships typical of such a consumeristic society as the United States, the story does not specify. Perhaps, for old Silva it might be a combination of these three. In “The Daily Grind” António regrets not having pursued his education and, like most Portuguese immigrants, succumbs to a life of toil. As an underpaid, blue-collar worker, over the years he learns that he is subject to the whims of his employers and cannot complain. “Brief Trilogy” introduces three different types of immigrants and how they view their country of birth. The first set includes a couple who return to the Azores after a life of toil in America. They will miss the paycheck on Friday afternoons and will return to the USA each year to renew their green card so as to maintain their resident alien status. In their view, it is better to be cautious since the political and economic situation back home was unstable after the revolution. The second type will settle for a trip to the Azores every year since their children do not wish to return. Moreover, they felt that there was a lot of political instability in Portugal. The last one does not wish to return since his compatriots refuse to bow down to such nouveauxriche and flashy immigrants as he. “The Imperfect Subjunctive” poignantly focuses on Luisa’s recur-\n\n40 Reinaldo Francisco Silva rent nightmares—especially when her teacher asks her and her classmates to write freely about the issue of abortion. Her Catholic upbringing and conservative family, who do not know she is pregnant, make things even more difficult for her. She does not wish to pursue a life of toil in the local factory like her mother and sister, but she is also aware of the stigma associated with single motherhood. Possibly the best story in this collection, “Adriano(s),” focuses on the eponymous hero’s desire for upward mobility in America and his rejection of his Portuguese roots. His parents and the local community priest believe he is hanging out with bad company and possibly using drugs. His American college friends and his teachers, in contrast, admire his entrepreneurship and pushy ways. His teachers not only regret that his parents force him to give them whatever money he earns in his part-time job, but also his dropping out of school at the age of sixteen. In my view, the message conveyed in this story is that if ethnic minorities desire further integration within the mainstream, one’s ties with the ancestral culture must be loosened—or discarded altogether. In the particular case of the Portuguese, this has been accomplished in only two or three generations. Remaining within the bounds of Portuguese ways, most have learned, would cripple such integration. Adriano cannot settle for a life of drudgery in the local factory or construction company since he knows that America has a lot more to offer to the entrepreneuring and insightful mind. (Sapa)teia Americana takes us on a tour into the heart of a Portuguese American community while inviting us to plunge deep into the soul and mentality of many Portuguese immigrants from a few decades ago. In this work, Almeida also invites the Portuguese American communities to look at themselves critically while he gently pokes fun at them. In most of these stories, they can take a good look at themselves and ascertain whether the image projected on this fictional mirror fits them well or not. In L(USA)lândia—a Décima Ilha (1987), Almeida defines L(USA)land as a portion of Portugal surrounded by America and notes that the articles composing this work were published in newspapers and magazines between 1975 and 1985. As in his previous works, this one, too, focuses on life in the Portuguese communities.\n\nPortuguese American Literature 41 In this collection, it is as if Almeida adopted an Emersonian role, urging Portuguese immigrants in the United States to reflect on their situation—that of unquestioning hardworkers and tax payers, but politically disenfranchised. In his view, they should drop their divisiveness, organize themselves, and come together as a group to fight for their rights in their workplaces. Moreover, they should apply for U.S. citizenship through naturalization so as to become eligible to vote. Afterwards, they can have a say in local and national politics. Instead of huddling together in ghettoes, they should learn to communicate in English and build bridges with the mainstream. Compared to his previous titles, in this work Almeida plunges even deeper into Portuguese American life. He wishes to highlight the contributions of several Portuguese Americans to American culture and society. Examples of these would include, for example, José Rodrigues Miguéis and Jorge de Sena. The list would include the Abbé Corrêa da Serra, a close friend of Thomas Jefferson and other politicians of the eighteenth-century. He was an instrumental man of the Enlightenment who offered advice and helped to draft the Neutrality Law of 1793. Another unacknowledged American writer of Portuguese descent is Ron Goulart, a prolific writer of science fiction who published more than a hundred titles, and whose father came from Faial. Almeida also narrates a few controversial occurrences involving a few Portuguese in New England, namely the Big Dan’s gang rape case, which shocked America, and the episode involving the Portuguese community of Fall River, Massachusetts, and the local Herald News. In this work, Almeida assigns less space to Portugal and concentrates heavily on Portuguese American reality. In Rio Atlântico (1997), Almeida argues that the Atlantic has become more and more like a river flowing between Europe and America. For the inhabitants of L(USA)land, Portugal is now much closer and more present in their lives thanks to the mass media, computers, the internet, and TAP, the Portuguese airline. Although a few articles in this volume were written as far back as 1978, most belong to the period between 1992 and 1995 and were written for the Lisbon daily newspaper, Diário de Notícias. When analyzing the events pertaining to the American side of the “river,” so to speak, Almeida crit-\n\n42 Reinaldo Francisco Silva icizes Reagonomics politics, Reagan’s support for El Salvador, the economic hardship experienced during the Bush (Senior) administration, Clinton’s inauguration, political correctness, and the conflicting attitudes towards African Americans by liberal and conservative politicians and intellectuals. In the section focusing on the other side of the “river,” Almeida criticizes the stressful lives of most inhabitants of Lisbon, the speeding habits on Portuguese highways, the patronizing and snobbish ways of Portuguese academics, and the lingering inferiority complex most Portuguese evince towards foreigners—especially those from richer Western countries. With full membership privileges in the European Union, Almeida devotes a few pieces to the on-going debate in Portugal on national identity and how to preserve the Portuguese language and culture within this new multicultural framework. In the section focusing on the interaction between the two sides of the “river,” Almeida reflects on the meaning of a deadline in both cultures; the Portuguese ancestry of William Madison Wood, a nineteenth-century industrial tycoon from Pawtucket, Rhode Island; the effects of the Americanization of life in Portugal; the desire for better opportunities for Portuguese American youth through education; and the challenges and difficulties imposed by a multicultural society such as the USA vs. cultural homogeneity in Portugal, the writer’s country of birth. In these works, Almeida successfully captures the on-going transatlantic dialogue and comes across as a keen observer of how the Portuguese adapted or rebelled against their environment in America. Along with Miguéis and Sena, the three voices discussed in this chapter tried to strike a balance between connecting with their ancestral land and culture through writing while focusing more and more on Portuguese American reality. Coming to terms with the fact that returning to Portugal was no longer a pressing issue to them, they found in Portuguese American life an outlet for expression.\n\nChapter Three Alfred Lewis as a Writer of Transition Compared to the works discussed in the foregoing chapters and those in chapters five and six, the themes Alfred Lewis [Alfredo Luís] (1902–77) analyzes in his writings are, indeed, transitional. From a voice profoundly centered on the Azores in Home Is an Island (1951) and, to some extent, in Aguarelas Florentinas e Outras Poesias (1986), Sixty Acres and a Barn (2005) deals with America and how Portuguese American farmers have contributed to California’s dairy industry and farming. Instead of another nostalgic immigrant voice learning to come to terms with a new life in America, Lewis’s writings reflect a growing desire for his roots to become more and more implanted on American soil and he, as much as possible, to live the American way of life. The subtle criticism directed at mainstream values in Aguarelas Florentinas e Outras Poesias has received little or no attention. Scholars such as Donald Warrin and Eduardo Dias, for example, have been attracted by other themes in Lewis’s poetry. Warrin writes that “Lewis’s poetry deals with many topics, both Portuguese and American, but at the core of his work has always been the immigrant experience” (217). To be more precise, Warrin and Dias have paid particular attention to those poems where Lewis expresses nostalgia for his island of birth, Flores, his despair upon realizing that he would never return there, his strong attachment to nature, the simplicity of his life in Los Banos, California, farming in the San Joaquin valley and, more importantly, his connectedness with his native culture. In a country such as the United States which, in the past, seldom acknowledged the contributions of its ethnic minorities, Lewis writes to remind himself that his native culture also had a glorious past. More importantly, in the culturally barren immigrant environment surrounding him, he needs to tap his ancestral culture for the spiritual sustenance he does not encounter in his fellow countrymen. But\n\n44 Reinaldo Francisco Silva Lewis was not a highly educated man. According to [Nancy] Baden, the works of Lewis tend to be “written in a simple, unadorned style— a reflection of the educational level and views” of those writers she classifies as belonging to “the first group of immigrants whose works began to appear in the mid 1930s.” Miguéis and Sena belong to a later wave of Portuguese emigration to the United States. In addition, Baden views the writings of Lewis and those writers who emigrated to America in the first decades of the twentieth-century as centering on “the immigrant experience, some electing to focus on the Azorean homeland and others choosing to reflect upon the new American experience” (18). Of these, Lewis’s poetic writings lean more towards issues related to his native culture and land. Lewis only wrote a few poems that assess Portuguese experience within American culture, but it is exactly these writings, reflecting his puzzlement about the mainstream culture, that particularly interest me here. Although Lewis may have channelled most of his poetic energy into poems imbued with nostalgia for his homeland, the irony is that as a man he was firmly established on American soil, and was even the embodiment of the American success story, given his professional activity in the insurance and real estate businesses. The more he wrote about how much he missed his native islands, the more he realized he could not really adapt to life there should he choose to return. If his Portuguese side was stronger than his American one, such was not the case with Julian Silva, Thomas Braga, Frank Gaspar, Katherine Vaz, and Charles Reis Felix. Lewis was born on Portuguese soil and lived there until the age of nineteen or twenty. Inevitably, such a background provided him with feelings and experiences he could later use. Lewis still remains an unknown figure in America even if his autobiographical novel Home Is an Island, written in English, was accepted for publication as long ago as 1951 by the prestigious Random House publishers. For an American audience of the 1950s keen on “exotic” cultures and weary of World War II, Home Is an Island catered to a need. As a whole, this text focuses on Lewis’s life prior to emigrating to the U.S.A. and I am more interested in analyzing the ways in which American values and culture shaped him or his writings than on how\n\nPortuguese American Literature 45 a minor culture challenges the dominant one. Although the rhetoric in these poems is not one that reflects issues centering on ethnicity and assimilation, that is, poems structured around a margin vs. mainstream dialectic, such a framework can, nonetheless, be applied to the verse in the following analysis. Aguarelas Florentinas expresses how much America affected him and his compatriots as well as what he thinks about his country of adoption. In “Cemetery,” Lewis recollects a childhood experience when he and a group of boys were returning from Sunday school and happened to pass by the village graveyard. At the time, the undertaker was busy digging a new grave. The boys, however, simply stood there in awe as he disappeared Into his own crevass Until the sound of rotten planks reached us And up came the awful shower —Tibias , ribs, an empty skull— Tainted by the smell of moths. “Time to remove old Calafona,” Our friend, the digger said, heavy with thoughts. “Seven years dead; came back with sacks Of gold, bought a cow and fed the village. A vow to Our Lady. Laughed, winked at the girls. Grew fat and died one day. That’s the way it is, when you’re old.” (52–53)\n\n“Calafona” is the name Azoreans traditionally ascribe to the Portuguese immigrants who settled in California. This particular “Calafona” embodies the mentality of most senior-citizen immigrants, especially in their desire to return to their native country to die after having secured a sound financial position for themselves and their children. In addition, this poem indirectly touches upon a recurrent theme in Lewis’s poetry and fiction, namely his realization that America “devours” these immigrants’ vigour and youth. When they return to the Azores after a life of toil in America, they are not more than food for worms. This is the price one must pay when emigrating. But while America kept this “Calafona’s” youth, he earned\n\n46 Reinaldo Francisco Silva a decent livelihood there, whereas if he had remained in the Azores, he would have struggled to survive. While the boys do not grasp this message, as a mature man reminiscing about this episode in this poem, Lewis reflects on the opportunities America offered him and his countrymen. The voice in “Carta” (”Letter”) longs for the day he will return to his island of birth. He anticipates all the things he will say to his friends and the people he will meet once again. But after so many years, he is no longer the same individual that he was. Lewis suggests that American consumerism has changed him into a different man. He now has his personal belongings to show off, stories of events in America to tell, and a word or two of English to impress the villagers. The poem, however, ends with the poetic voice coming to terms with his foolishness and the realization that he is no longer the humble person he once was: “Since I am now an ‘Americano’,/The story changes a lot, because instead of being humane/I shall seem more beast-like” (my translation; 164). In this poem, Lewis regrets that for many Portuguese immigrants, the whole paradigm of going to America has not produced anything spiritually and culturally positive when, in fact, America has many wholesome values to offer. But, again, it is unlikely that they would ever pick up on, for example, the values propounded by Benjamin Franklin in his Autobiography, namely his scheme for moral perfection, the value of a good education, and how these pre-requisites are essential for a meaningful life in America where one’s American Dream can come true if the cards are played right. Some of these flashy, materialistic, and ignorant immigrants are the opposite of what Franklin had envisioned for a successful and meaningful life. In “Exílio” (“Exile”), Lewis expresses his nostalgia for his native country because life in America is not easy and the type of work he and other immigrants must endure is alienating and back-breaking. The poem contrasts the simple and joyful way of life on the Azores and the hardships immigrants must endure in America, where life is compared to a prison: In this cruel exile on this dismal land, With no beauty, on this lifeless, cold place,\n\nPortuguese American Literature 47 How painful it is to live here!\n\nIn contrast, the poetic voice longs for those moments of joy he had experienced as a youth back home when he exclaims: Oh joyful Sundays, afternoons full of happiness! ‘If wishes, my dear heart, do not set you ablaze, Why don’t you burn with nostalgia and love? (My translation; 247)\n\nHis poems in Portuguese are not first-rate work. Ranging from the elementary education he received prior to emigrating to the U.S.A., to the poems’ popular appeal, the language he uses is simple and his themes cater to an audience seeking comfort and identification with someone who is also nostalgic and sad, experiences which are common to most Portuguese immigrants. Poems such as “Aventura: Vietname” (“Adventure: Vietnam”), “Massacre,” and “Vietnam: Three Poems” show how much Lewis is interested in the political and social affairs of his country of adoption. The pointlessness and bloodshed of the Vietnam War are matters which he wishes to comment on: Now it was peaceful, one morning Even before daylight he found himself Above the clouds, moving home – That bit of green and white – Under the mountain shadows. Gone were the sound of guns The smell of caked blood. Children, half naked, begging to live The old in bundles, wanting to die. To him alerted by computer Somewhere in Washington Alive, a decoration or two, Will his dead follow in parade Stumps, instead of pointing fingers, In silent accusation?\n\n48 Reinaldo Francisco Silva\n\nWhen will his past become A fading dream, and his sleep Be an easy friend at night? (340)\n\nIn this poem, titled “Returnee”, as much as in his other poems about Vietnam, the veteran never finds inner peace because Lewis wishes to express his disagreement with such a war as well as highlight America’s guilty conscience in the entire affair. Of all the poems where Lewis is “speaking” to mainstream America, “Bicentennial: A Portuguese Salute” is the one where he celebrates the Portuguese contribution to the grandeur of the United States. Whether it was the Azorean sailors on Nantucket or New Bedford whaling-ships, factory workers in New England textile mills, construction workers, dairymen in California, or even the sugar and pineapple plantation farmers in Hawaii, the nameless thousands who do not appear in the annals of American culture, the Portuguese, Lewis affirms, could also proudly exhibit their heritage through a few famous men. In this poem, Lewis believes it is impossible to think of American culture without the heroism of Peter Francisco during the American Revolution, the music of John Phillip Sousa, or even the novels of John Dos Passos. In this poem, as well as in a few by Braga—discussed later—the rhetoric centering on ethnic pride is a by-product of the 1970s, a time in America when it became socially acceptable to applaud ethnic minorities and acknowledge their contributions to America. It is worth quoting a few representative stanzas since they highlight the love of most Portuguese immigrants for their country of adoption, expressed through hard work and determination: We came in various ways: arrived as whalers We who knew the sea and its green riches Tempted by sea-captains, freedom, much food Youth spent at sea, chiefs’ daughters, warm fleshed Wanting us to love them under the palms. …\n\nPortuguese American Literature 49 We came in many ways: became a part Of you: we joined you in thought; gave our bodies In that never-ending struggle to conquer The still untamed soil; many tracts of it. As Portuguese-Americans became Fishers, gold miners, owners of dairies Orchards of fruit, in rows, tingling our taste. … And so, together, all of us as one Proud of you, proud of our own land Recalling still the deeds of our fathers In continents far, our monuments Representing our struggles and conquests Salute you with pride and satisfaction You, who have taken us, who have adopted All of us, as your sons, to do us proud By our honest toil and dedication. Americans, all of us, we join you As one to say aloud with pride, Mãezinha, dear, Happy Birthday. (348–50)\n\nCompared to the focus on Portuguese issues in Home Is an Island and in most of the poems in Aguarelas Florentinas e Outras Poesias, the poem under review tries to establish a transatlantic bridge between the values the Portuguese brought with them to America and the celebration of their contributions to America—the land where they wish to stay, work, and are proud of. Lewis’s novel, Sixty Acres and a Barn, was completed in the years before the author’s death in 1977. Its posthumous publication in 2005, however, changes our perception of this writer’s work and much of what I have noted when referring to Home Is an Island and Aguarelas Florentinas e Outras Poesias. While these titles are saturated with feelings of nostalgia and homesickness for the Azores, in Sixty Acres and a Barn these have been greatly subdued. In this novel we are immersed in the agrarian world of California’s dairy industry, which was operated mostly by Portuguese immigrants. In this compelling\n\n50 Reinaldo Francisco Silva piece of fiction prefaced by Donald Warrin and reviewed by Frank Gaspar and George Monteiro (Home Is an Island received praise from the San Francisco Chronicle, the Chicago Sunday Tribune, and the New York Times Book Review), the Franklinian values of hard work, frugality, and entrepreneurship come to life in the character of Tomé Madruga, who, in the course of a half century, becomes the living embodiment of the Horatio Alger success story. Madruga’s lonely plight ends when he begins to do good to those who also wish to help themselves—as is the case with his hard-working employee and protégé, Luís Sarmento. Sixty Acres and a Barn recycles the classical love story where Winter (José Linhares) marries Spring (Ana Linhares) and the former is cuckolded by the young and good-looking Luís Sarmento. This young couple’s out-of-wedlock romance and Ana’s pregnancy is a pivotal occurrence because it brings to the fore the cultural clash between some of the values of the Old and New Worlds. Since Sixty Acres and a Barn is an essentially American novel, this episode further stresses the author’s willingness in getting rid of the Old World mentality and ways professed by the community’s Portuguese women, who os"
