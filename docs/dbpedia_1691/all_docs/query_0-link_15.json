        "text": "Hi Everyone!\n\nWelcome to Let’s Deconstruct a Story! This month I’m talking to Katherine Vaz about her wonderful story, “Our Lady of the Artichokes.” Please read the story (below) before tuning into the podcast available on Apple, Spotify, or wherever you get your podcasts.\n\nAlso, please check out the link to her fantastic new novel Above the Salt which I read and adored. Sometimes I really wish this was also a podcast about novels, but we do offer a brief preview of the book during our discussion. Purchase options available below.\n\nNext month I’ll be talking to Jai Chakrabarti about his story, “A Small Sacrifice for an Enormous Happiness,” which is available here. If you have any questions for Jai, feel free to contact me and I will pass them along.\n\nHave a wonderful holiday season. I’ll be reaching out in two weeks with some end of the year recommendations and then we’ll see you on January 1st for Jai Chakrabarti.\n\nCheers!\n\nKelly\n\nBio:\n\nKatherine Vaz, a former Briggs-Copeland Fellow in Fiction at Harvard, Fellow of the Radcliffe Institute, and a National Endowment for the Arts recipient, has published two novels, SAUDADE and MARIANA.
