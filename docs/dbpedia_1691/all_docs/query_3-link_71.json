The course aims to provide you with a knowledge of the most important empirical data about these histories and to confront you the impact some of the developments made on human life as well as the difficulties we confront trying to study them\n\nFall 2024: HIST UN1002\n\nCourse Number Section/Call Number Times/Location Instructor Points Enrollment HIST 1002 001/10335 T Th 4:10pm - 5:25pm\n\n703 Hamilton Hall Marc Van De Mieroop 4.00 23/35\n\nHIST UN1010 ANCIENT GREEK HIST, 800-146 BC. 4.00 points.\n\nA review of the history of the Greek world from the beginnings of Greek archaic culture around 800 B.C. through the classical and hellenistic periods to the definitive Roman conquest in 146 B.C. with concentration on political history, but attention also to social and cultural developments.Field(s): ANC\n\nFall 2024: HIST UN1010\n\nCourse Number Section/Call Number Times/Location Instructor Points Enrollment HIST 1010 001/10331 T Th 11:40am - 12:55pm\n\n602 Hamilton Hall Richard Billows 4.00 61/70\n\nHIST UN1071 History of Christianity from the Origins to the Reformation. 4.00 points.\n\nChristianity is a one-semester introduction to the history of classical forms of Christianity, The Church and society in western Europe from its origins to the 16th century Reformation, with emphasis on Western developments (early Christianity, persecutions, heresies, monasticism, Crusades, popular piety, cults of saints, mendicants, universities, civic religion, mysticism, papal authority, Pre-reformation and Reformation), including its interactive dimensions with Islam, Judaism, distant Eastern worlds, and Global contexts\n\nFall 2024: HIST UN1071\n\nCourse Number Section/Call Number Times/Location Instructor Points Enrollment HIST 1071 001/14937 T Th 11:40am - 12:55pm\n\n333 Uris Hall Benedicte Sere 4.00 35/35\n\nHIST BC1401 INTRODUCTION TO AMERICAN HISTORY TO 1865. 4.00 points.\n\nThemes include Native and colonial cultures and politics, the evolution of American political and economic institutions, relationships between religious and social movements, and connecting ideologies of race and gender with larger processes such as enslavement, dispossession, and industrialization\n\nFall 2024: HIST BC1401\n\nCourse Number Section/Call Number Times/Location Instructor Points Enrollment HIST 1401 001/00025 M W 2:40pm - 3:55pm\n\n323 Milbank Hall Andrew Lipman 4.00 55/70\n\nHIST UN1786 History of the City in Latin America. 4.00 points.\n\nThis course covers the historical development of cities in Latin America. Readings, lectures, and discussion sections will examine the concentration of people in commercial and political centers from the beginnings of European colonization in the fifteenth century to the present day and will introduce contrasting approaches to the study of urban culture, politics, society, and the built environment. Central themes include the reciprocal relationships between growing urban areas and the countryside; changing power dynamics in modern Latin America, especially as they impacted the lives of cities’ nonelite majority populations; the legalities and politics of urban space; planned versus unplanned cities and the rise of informal economies; the way changing legal and political rights regimes have affected urban life; and the constant tension between tradition and progress through which urban society was formed.

Its soldiers wrote themselves into the annals of military history. But it was also a place where war was discussed, conceptualized and criticized with unparalleled vigor. Nowhere did the extreme violence of the seventeenth century and the early twentieth century leave a deeper mark than on Germany. Today, as we enter the twenty-first century, Germany is the nation that has perhaps come closest to drawing a final, concluding line under its military history. This course will chart the rise and fall of modern militarism in Germany. For those interested in military history per se, this course will not hold back from discussing battles, soldiers and weapons. But it will also offer an introduction to German history more generally. And through the German example we will address questions in political philosophy that haunted modern European history and continue to haunt America today. How is state violence justified? How can it be regulated and controlled? What is its future?\n\nSpring 2024: HIST UN2305\n\nCourse Number Section/Call Number Times/Location Instructor Points Enrollment HIST 2305 001/11686 M W 2:40pm - 3:55pm\n\n517 Hamilton Hall Adam Tooze 4.00 61/70\n\nFall 2024: HIST UN2305\n\nCourse Number Section/Call Number Times/Location Instructor Points Enrollment HIST 2305 001/11267 M W 2:40pm - 3:55pm\n\nRen Kraft Center Adam Tooze 4.00 68/70\n\nHIST BC2321 COLONIAL ENCOUNTERS. 3.00 points.\n\nExamines the shaping of European cultural identity through encounters with non-European cultures from 1500 to the post-colonial era.

Environmental history is the study of the relationship between nature and society over time. It deals with the material environment, cultural and scientific understandings of nature, and the politics of socio-economic use of natural resources. The class combines the study of classic texts that were foundational to the field with modern case studies from all over the world. It addresses questions of global relevance, such as: how did the environment shape human history? How did humans shape the natural environment? How are power relations of class, race and gender embedded in the environment we live in? The class welcomes students from the natural and social sciences, as well as the humanities. The goal of the course is to understand how the relationship between environment and society in history led to the current climate crisis\n\nFall 2024: HIST BC2385\n\nCourse Number Section/Call Number Times/Location Instructor Points Enrollment HIST 2385 001/00166 T Th 4:10pm - 5:25pm\n\n504 Diana Center Angelo Caglioti 3.00 70/70\n\nHIST UN2432 U.S. ERA OF CIVIL WAR ＆ RECON. 4.00 points.\n\nIt is difficult to exaggerate the significance of the American Civil War as an event in the making of the modern United States and, indeed, of the western world. Indeed the American Civil War and Reconstruction introduced a whole series of dilemmas that are still with us. What is the legacy of slavery in U.S. history and contemporary life? What is the proper balance of power between the states and the central government? Who is entitled to citizenship in the United States? What do freedom and equality mean in concrete terms? This course surveys the history of the Civil War and Reconstruction in all of its aspects. It focuses on the causes of the war in the divergent development of northern and southern states; the prosecution of the war and all that it involved, including the process of slave emancipation; and the contentious process of reconstructing the re-united states in the aftermath of Union victory. The course includes the military history of the conflict, but ranges far beyond it to take the measure of the social and political changes the war unleashed. It focuses on the Confederacy as well as the Union, on women as well as men, and on enslaved black people as well as free white people. It takes the measure of large scale historical change while trying to grasp the experience of those human beings who lived through it\n\nFall 2024: HIST UN2432\n\nCourse Number Section/Call Number Times/Location Instructor Points Enrollment HIST 2432 001/10480 M W 11:40am - 12:55pm\n\n142 Uris Hall Stephanie McCurry 4.00 71/90\n\nHIST BC2440 INTRO AFRICAN-AMERCN HISTORY. 3.00 points.\n\nMajor themes in African-American History: slave trade, slavery, resistance, segregation, the New Negro, Civil Rights, Black Power, challenges and manifestations of the contemporary Color Line.General Education Requirement: Historical Studies (HIS)\n\nFall 2024: HIST BC2440\n\nCourse Number Section/Call Number Times/Location Instructor Points Enrollment HIST 2440 001/00245 M W 1:10pm - 2:25pm\n\n409 Barnard Hall Celia Naylor 3.00 30/30\n\nHIST UN2523 HEALTH INEQUALITY: MODERN US. 4.00 points.\n\nThrough assigned readings and a group research project, students will gain familiarity with a range of historical and social science problems at the intersection of ethnic/racial/sexual formations, technological networks, and health politics since the turn of the twentieth century.

There are no required qualifications for enrollment, although students will find the material more accessible if they have had previous coursework experience in United States history, pre-health professional (pre-med, pre-nursing, or pre-public health), African-American Studies, Women and Gender Studies, Ethnic Studies, or American Studies\n\nFall 2024: HIST UN2523\n\nCourse Number Section/Call Number Times/Location Instructor Points Enrollment HIST 2523 001/10486 M W 10:10am - 11:25am\n\n702 Hamilton Hall Samuel Roberts 4.00 53/70\n\nHIST UN2535 HIST OF THE CITY OF NEW YORK. 4.00 points.\n\nFall 2024: HIST UN2535\n\nCourse Number Section/Call Number Times/Location Instructor Points Enrollment HIST 2535 001/10483 T Th 11:40am - 12:55pm\n\n402 Chandler Kimberly Phillips-Fein 4.00 90/90 HIST 2535 AU1/19416 T Th 11:40am - 12:55pm\n\nOthr Other Kimberly Phillips-Fein 4.00 0/10\n\nHIST UN2587 SPORT＆SOCIETY IN THE AMERICAS. 4.00 points.\n\nThis course explores the ways organized sport constitutes and disrupts dominant understandings of nation, race, gender, and sexuality throughout the Americas. Working from the notion that sport is “more than a game,” the class will examine the social, cultural and political impact of sports in a variety of hemispheric American contexts from the 19th century until the present. While our primary geographic focus will be the United States, Brazil, and the Caribbean, the thrust of the course encourages students to consider sports in local, national, and transnational contexts. The guiding questions of the course are: What is the relationship between sport and society? How does sport inform political transformations within and across national borders? How does sport reinforce and/or challenge social hierarchies? Can sport provide alternative visions of the self and community? Throughout the semester we will examine such topics as: the continuing political struggles surrounding the staging of mega-events such as the Olympics and World Cup, the role of professional baseball in the rise and fall of Jim Crow segregation, the impact of football on the evolution of masculine identities in the U.S., the impact of tennis on the Second-Wave feminist movement, and the role of sports in the growth of modern American cities. Course materials include works by historians, sociologists, social theorists, and journalists who have also been key contributors to the burgeoning field of sports studies. Thus, the course has three objectives: 1) To deepen our understanding of the relationship between sport and society 2) To encourage students to examine the sporting world beyond the frame of the nation-state 3) To consider the promises and challenges of sport as a site of social theory and knowledge production\n\nFall 2024: HIST UN2587\n\nCourse Number Section/Call Number Times/Location Instructor Points Enrollment HIST 2587 001/10476 T Th 10:10am - 11:25am\n\n702 Hamilton Hall Frank Guridy 4.00 54/70\n\nHIST UN2611 JEWS ＆ JUDAISM IN ANTIQUITY. 4.00 points.\n\nPrerequisites: Students must also enroll in required discussion section.\n\nField(s): ANC\n\nFall 2024: HIST UN2611\n\nCourse Number Section/Call Number Times/Location Instructor Points Enrollment HIST 2611 001/10333 M W 8:40am - 9:55am\n\n304 Hamilton Hall Seth Schwartz 4.00 24/35 HIST 2611 AU1/18834 M W 8:40am - 9:55am\n\nOthr Other Seth Schwartz 4.00 0/3\n\nHIST UN2618 The Modern Caribbean. 4 points.\n\nCC/GS/SEAS: Partial Fulfillment of Global Core Requirement\n\nThis lecture course examines the social, cultural, and political history of the islands of the Caribbean Sea and the coastal regions of Central and South America that collectively form the Caribbean region, from Amerindian settlement, through the era of European imperialism and African enslavement, to the period of socialist revolution and independence. The course will examine historical trajectories of colonialism, slavery, and labor regimes; post-emancipation experiences and migration; radical insurgencies and anti-colonial movements; and intersections of race, culture, and neocolonialism.

It understands the Cold War as a complex and multi-layered conflict, which not only pitted two superpowers—the United States and the Soviet Union—against one another, but also two ideologies—capitalism and socialism—whose appeal cut across societies. In Latin America, the idea of socialist revolution attracted a diverse set of actors (workers, students, intellectuals, politicians, etc.) and posed a significant challenge to both capitalism and United States hegemony. We will probe what the Cold War meant to people across the region, paying particular attention to revolutionary and counterrevolutionary events in Guatemala, Cuba, Chile, and Nicaragua, all the while examining the diplomatic and cultural battles for the hearts and minds of Latin Americans\n\nFall 2024: HIST UN2671\n\nCourse Number Section/Call Number Times/Location Instructor Points Enrollment HIST 2671 001/17647 T Th 1:10pm - 2:25pm\n\n304 Hamilton Hall Alfonso Salgado 4.00 12/35\n\nHIST UN2719 HISTORY OF THE MOD MIDDLE EAST. 4.00 points.\n\nThis course will cover the history of the Middle East from the 18th century until the present, examining the region ranging from Morocco to Iran and including the Ottoman Empire.

It asks how gender and sexuality have shaped key historical developments, from African kingdoms and empires to postcolonial states, from colonial conquest to movements for independence, from indigenous healing practices to biomedicine, from slavery to the modern forms of work. It will also explore the history of different sexualities and gender identities on the continent. A key objective is to extend the historical study of gender and sexual identity in Africa beyond ‘women’s history’ to understand gender as encompassing all people in society and their relationships, whether domestic or public.\n\nFall 2024: HSWM UN2761\n\nCourse Number Section/Call Number Times/Location Instructor Points Enrollment HSWM 2761 001/10337 T Th 10:10am - 11:25am\n\n717 Hamilton Hall Rhiannon Stephens 4.00 71/70\n\nHSME UN2810 HISTORY OF SOUTH ASIA I. 4.00 points.\n\nCC/GS/SEAS: Partial Fulfillment of Global Core Requirement\n\nGraduate students must register for HIST G6998 version of this course.\n\nThis survey lecture course will provide students with a broad overview of the history of South Asia as a region - focusing on key political, cultural and social developments over more than two millennia. The readings include both primary sources (in translation) and secondary works. Our key concerns will be the political, cultural and theological encounters of varied communities, the growth of cities and urban spaces, networks of trade and migrations and the development of both local and cosmopolitan cultures across Southern Asia. The survey will begin with early dynasties of the classical period and then turn to the subsequent formation of various Perso-Turkic polities, including the development and growth of hybrid political cultures such as those of Vijayanagar and the Mughals. The course also touches on Indic spiritual and literary traditions such as Sufi and Bhakti movements. Near the end of our course, we will look forward towards the establishment of European trading companies and accompanying colonial powers\n\nHIST UN2851 Making Modern Korea. 4.00 points.\n\nThis course explores Korea’s history from the late nineteenth century to the present with a particular focus on caste/class, gender, war and industrialization. Using primary and secondary texts as well as documentary film and literary ephemera, the seminar analyses such topics as the relationship between imperialism and rebellions in the nineteenth century; the uneven experience of Japanese colonial rule; Korea’s early feminist movement; how North Korea became a communist society; the deep scars of the Korean War; cultures of industrialism in South and North Korea; counter-cultural movements in 1970s, 1980s and 1990s South Korea; and contemporary challenges facing the peninsula.

This course is an introductory dive into the interplay between science, technology, health, environment, and society. By offering deep historical and contemporary perspectives, this course equips students with skills essential to critically exploring not only longstanding questions about the world but also urgent issues of our time. Unsettling Science will provide students with the critical and methodological tools to think creatively about local and global challenges and develop interventions. To do so, the course focuses on a series of fundamental questions that underpin the study of science and society from a variety of perspectives\n\nFall 2024: HIST UN2972\n\nCourse Number Section/Call Number Times/Location Instructor Points Enrollment HIST 2972 001/14525 T Th 4:10pm - 5:25pm\n\n333 Uris Hall Madisson Whitman 4.00 40/40\n\nHIST UN2978 Science and Pseudoscience: Alchemy to AI. 4.00 points.\n\nDuring the 2020 US presidential election and the years of the COVID-19 pandemic, science and “scientific truths” were fiercely contested. This course provides a historical perspective on the issues at stake. The course begins with an historical account of how areas of natural knowledge, such as astrology, alchemy, and “natural magic,” which were central components of an educated person’s view of the world in early modern Europe, became marginalized, while a new philosophy of nature (what we would now call empirical science) came to dominate the discourse of rationality. Historical developments examined in this course out of which this new understanding of nature emerged include the rise of the centralized state, religious reform, and European expansion. The course uses this historical account to show how science and pseudoscience developed in tandem in the period from 1400 to 1800. This historical account equips students to examine contemporary issues of expertise, the social construction of science, pluralism in science, certainty and uncertainty in science, as well as critical engagement with contemporary technologies\n\nFall 2024: HIST UN2978\n\nCourse Number Section/Call Number Times/Location Instructor Points Enrollment HIST 2978 001/10345 T Th 2:40pm - 3:55pm\n\nRen Kraft Center Pamela Smith, Madisson Whitman 4.00 49/70\n\nHIST UN3009 Cities and Slavery in the Atlantic World. 4 points.\n\nAlthough African slavery in the Americas is most often associated with rural life and agricultural production, cities were crucial sites in the history of slavery. This undergraduate seminar explores the intertwined histories of urbanization and slavery in the Atlantic world from the sixteenth to the twentieth centuries.\n\nReadings and discussions will touch on slavery’s impact on such European centers as Nantes, Liverpool, London, and Seville and on African cities but will concentrate on the “New World,” eventually coming to focus on the places where slavery lasted long enough to intersect with the beginnings of urban modernity and industrialization: Cuba and especially Brazil. We will end the semester reading and reflecting on the lasting legacies of African slavery in the cities of the Atlantic world after abolition, considering both slavery’s memorialization on and erasure from the urban landscape.\n\nFall 2024: HIST UN3009\n\nCourse Number Section/Call Number Times/Location Instructor Points Enrollment HIST 3009 001/13524 W 4:10pm - 6:00pm\n\n302 Fayerweather Amy Chazkel 4 15/14\n\nHIST UN3023 Mobility and Identity in the Roman World. 4.00 points.\n\nThis course considers how identity increased, limited, controlled, or otherwise shaped the mobility of individuals and groups in the Roman world, including women, slaves, freedpeople, and diaspora communities. We will identify the structures that produced differences in mobility and consider how such groups understood and represented themselves in a variety of media as possessing a specific, shared identity and community.

We will ask how have people become citizens and under what authority has that citizenship been granted? What are the historic barriers to citizenship and how have they shifted over time? What major questions remain unanswered by Congress and the Supreme Court regarding the rights of migrants to attain and retain American citizenship?\n\nFall 2024: HIST UN3030\n\nCourse Number Section/Call Number Times/Location Instructor Points Enrollment HIST 3030 001/14140 Th 12:10pm - 2:00pm\n\n311 Fayerweather Jessica Lee 4.00 0/13\n\nHIST BC3327 CONSUMER CULTURE IN MOD EUROPE. 3.00 points.\n\nPrerequisites: Permission of the instructor.

How did water shape human and environmental histories around the globe? On one hand, oceans and rivers affected the characteristics and resources of different civilizations. Throughout history, every community depended on access to water resources, developed local practices of water management, and produced cultural and scientific understandings of “water.” On the other hand, human attempts at regulating water flows aimed at controlling life itself, as water is essential for life. Hydro-power, before being a renewable source energy, required exerting political power over humans and nature alike. Grounded in the interdisciplinary approach of the environmental humanities, this class will explore the politics of water management thanks to a wide range of case studies. Starting with the first environmental history of the Mediterranean in the early modern period, we will focus on the last two centuries to examine the roots of the current environmental crisis. By following the politics of water flows, the class will introduce students to key themes in global environmental history, such as the role of geography, climate, race, energy, labor, technology, cities, animals, diseases, and empires in the transformation of human societies. Finally, the class provides foundational historical knowledge to understand the importance of water in contemporary debates about environmental justice and climate change\n\nFall 2024: HIST BC3379\n\nCourse Number Section/Call Number Times/Location Instructor Points Enrollment HIST 3379 001/00249 W 10:10am - 12:00pm\n\n111 Milstein Center Angelo Caglioti 4.00 16/15\n\nHIST UN3418 The Carceral United States. 4.00 points.\n\nExamination of the development of U.S. carceral systems and logics from the late 18th century through the present.

We will cover Socialism and the Ku Klux Klan in the early twentieth century; the Communist Party and right-wing populists of the 1930s; the civil rights movement, black power, and white resistance, 1950s-1960s; the rise of the New Left and the New Right in the 1960s; the Women's liberation movement and the Christian right of the 1970s; and finally, free-market conservatism, neoliberalism, white nationalism and the Trump era. We will explore the organizational, ideological and social history of these political mobilizations. The class explores grass-roots social movements and their relationship to “mainstream” and electoral politics. We will pay special attention to the ways that ideas and mobilizations that are sometimes deemed extreme have in fact helped to shape the broader political spectrum. Throughout the semester, we will reflect on the present political dilemmas of our country in light of the history that we study\n\nSpring 2024: HIST UN3571\n\nCourse Number Section/Call Number Times/Location Instructor Points Enrollment HIST 3571 JE1/21364 Th 12:00pm - 3:00pm\n\nOthr Other Noah Remnick 4.00 16/16 HIST 3571 JE2/21365 W 6:00pm - 8:30pm\n\nOthr Other Noah Remnick 4.00 13/16\n\nFall 2024: HIST UN3571\n\nCourse Number Section/Call Number Times/Location Instructor Points Enrollment HIST 3571 001/10485 Th 2:10pm - 4:00pm\n\n302 Fayerweather Kimberly Phillips-Fein 4.00 13/13\n\nHIST UN3712 African Climate and History. 4.00 points.\n\nThis course examines how Africa’s climate has changed in the past and with what consequences for the people living on the continent. It looks at the scope, duration and intensity of past climate events and their impacts, while using these historical climate events to teach fundamental climate concepts. Central to the course is the human experience of these events and the diversity of their responses. The major question underpinning this course is, therefore, how have people responded to past climate events, whether short-term, decadal or longer in scope? This question is predicated on the complexity of human society and moves away from the binary of collapse vs. resilience that dominates much thinking about the impact of climate changes on past societies. This framing recognizes the significance of climate for food production and collection, as well as trade and cosmologies. It does not take climate to be the determining factor in history. Rather it foregrounds the myriad ways people acted in the face of, for example, multi-decadal below average rainfall or long periods of more reliable precipitation\n\nFall 2024: HIST UN3712\n\nCourse Number Section/Call Number Times/Location Instructor Points Enrollment HIST 3712 001/10338 Th 2:10pm - 4:00pm\n\n301m Fayerweather Jason Smerdon, Rhiannon Stephens 4.00 12/13\n\nHIST GU4218 The Black Sea in History. 4 points.\n\nWe are used to thinking of history in national terms, or at least in reference to major civilizations (“Western civilization,” “Near Eastern civilization,” etc.). In “real life,” however, interactions among people, linguistic communities, and cultures frequently cut across political divisions. Water – rivers, streams, seas – is often an invitation to settlement, commerce, and conquest. This course offers a look (inspired in part by Fernand Braudel's Mediterranean) at a body of water – the Black Sea – and the lands around it, in sweeping historical perspective. Focus is on those moments when the various civilizations and empires that originated and flourished around the Black Sea met and intersected in friendship or in enmity. We will look at ancient civilizations, Greek colonization, Byzantine-Slav interactions, the period of Ottoman dominance, Russian-Turkish rivalry, and decolonization and wars in the 19th and 20th centuries. We hope that we will be able to pay particular attention to questions of ecology, language, religion, and cultural interaction throughout.\n\nFall 2024: HIST GU4218\n\nCourse Number Section/Call Number Times/Location Instructor Points Enrollment HIST 4218 001/12914 W 2:10pm - 4:00pm\n\n302 Fayerweather Taylor Zajicek 4 15/13\n\nHIST GU4363 Pascal and the Modern Self. 4.00 points.\n\nThis seminar will focus particularly on Pascal’s humanistic case for religious faith as a response to Montaigne’s skeptical portrayal of the self.

This tutorial will offer students a deep dive not only into the historical depths of the Stalin era but into the gloriously complex historiographical debates that surround it. Some of the questions that will animate the readings, writings, and discussions that students will engage in are as follows: Did Stalin depart from or represent a continuation of the policies introduced by his predecessor Vladimir Lenin? Did he rule in a totalitarian fashion or in ways comparable to other twentieth century regimes? Were his policies destructive or possibly productive? And perhaps most boggling of all: why did no one resist Stalinist rule?\n\nFall 2024: HIST GU4389\n\nCourse Number Section/Call Number Times/Location Instructor Points Enrollment HIST 4389 001/10531 M 2:10pm - 4:00pm\n\n311 Fayerweather Yana Skorobogatov 4.00 11/13\n\nHIST GU4518 Research Seminar: Columbia and Slavery. 4 points.\n\nIn this course, students will write original, independent papers of around 25 pages, based on research in both primary and secondary sources, on an aspect of the relationship between Columbia College and its colonial predecessor King's College, with the institution of slavery.\n\nFall 2024: HIST GU4518\n\nCourse Number Section/Call Number Times/Location Instructor Points Enrollment HIST 4518 001/10482 W 4:10pm - 6:00pm\n\n311 Fayerweather Stephanie McCurry 4 11/13\n\nHIST GU4681 The Nahuas Through Their Sources. 4.00 points.\n\nThis seminar aims to give a basic knowledge of the history, society, and culture of the Nahuas, one of the main Indigenous groups of Mexico, during the early period, 16th-18th centuries. The Nahuas left a vast and varied corpus of documents written in Nahuatl, a language still in use today. In each class, we will be reading a different set of documents available both in Nahuatl and in English translation and analyze them together to get an understanding of the Nahua world from within. To help us in this analysis, we will be reading also academic works by experts in the field of Indigenous history of early Latin America. Thanks to a collaboration with Eduardo de la Cruz, director of IDIEZ (Instituto de Docencia e Investigación Etnológica de Zacatecas) and a native-speaker instructor of Nahuatl, we will have the possibility to learn how Nahuatl is spoken today and how Indigenous people read their own primary sources from the past.

Its structure is shaped mainly by thematic considerations in a notable chronological fashion. The meetings amount to a series of “cuts” through the topic and cover themes such as the paper revolution, authorship, scribal culture, technologies of book production, readers and their notes, libraries and book collections, or textual as well as extra-textual components of manuscripts. Over the semester, we will study key material, textual, and visual elements of Islamic book culture spanning many centuries and continents, and visit major historiographical questions on the millennium-long history of Islamic manuscript tradition before the widespread adoption of print technology\n\nFall 2024: HIST GU4743\n\nCourse Number Section/Call Number Times/Location Instructor Points Enrollment HIST 4743 001/10404 Th 10:10am - 12:00pm\n\n302 Fayerweather Tunc Sen 4.00 3/13\n\nHIST GU4962 Making and Knowing in Early Modern Europe: Hands-On History. 4.00 points.\n\nThis course introduces undergraduate and graduate students to the materials, techniques, contexts, and meanings of skilled craft and artistic practices in early modern Europe (1350-1750), in order to reflect upon a series of topics, including craft knowledge and artisanal epistemology; the intersections between craft and science; and questions of historical methodology in reconstructing the material world of the past. The course will be run as a “Laboratory Seminar,” with discussions of primary and secondary materials, as well as hands-on work in a laboratory. The first semester long course to use the published Edition of Fr. 640 as its focus, it will test the use of the Edition in a higher education classroom to inform the development of the Companion.

HIST. 4.00 points.\n\nThis is a hands-on, project-driven, Laboratory Seminar that explores the frontiers of historical analysis in the information age. It harnesses the exponential growth in information resulting from the digitization of older materials and the explosion of “born digital” electronic records. Machine learning and natural language processing make it possible to answer traditional research questions with greater rigor, and tackle new kinds of projects that would once have been deemed impracticable. At the same time, scholars now have many more ways to communicate with one another and the broader public, and it is becoming both easier – and more necessary – to collaborate across disciplines. This course will create a laboratory organized around a common group of databases in 20th century international history. Students will begin by learning about earlier methodological transformations in literary, cultural, and historical analysis, and consider whether and how the “digital turn” might turn out differently. They will then explore new tools and techniques, including named-entity recognition, text classification, topic modeling, geographic information systems, social and citation network analysis, and data visualization. As we turn to specific projects, you will be able to either write a traditional history paper or try an alternative project, either working alone or as part of a team. Papers will entail applying one or more of the digital tools to a specific historical literature/debate or a novel historical topic. Projects might include assembling and “cleaning” a large dataset of documents, prototyping a new tool, launching a web-based exhibit, or drafting a grant application. You will be encouraged to seek out additional training as necessary, conduct experiments, and design ambitious projects that might extend beyond the life of the course. The seminar will meet every week, and start with a discussion of the readings. The second hour will be devoted to training in new tools for historical research, as well as individual and small group work. Students will also be encouraged to attend weekly lab meetings, and that will be a requirement of those undertaking alternative projects. The course is open to students with no training in statistics or computer programming, and no knowledge of international history. But all participants should be open to learning both historical and computational research skills, such as the critical reading of primary source documents and oral history interviewing on the one hand, and scraping websites, querying databases, and using data visualization tools on the other\n\nHIST UN1020 The Romans and Their World. 4 points.\n\nThis course examines the history of the Roman Empire from the formation of the Roman monarchy in 753 BCE to the collapse of the Western Empire in 476 CE. At the heart of the class is a single question: how did the Roman Empire come to be, and why did it last for so long? We will trace the rise and fall of the Republic, the extension of its power beyond Italy, and the spread of Christianity. Epic poetry, annalistic accounts, coins, papyri, inscriptions, and sculpture will illuminate major figures like Cleopatra, and features of daily life like Roman law and religion. The destructive mechanics by which Rome sustained itself--war, slavery, and environmental degradation--will receive attention, too, with the aim of producing a holistic understanding this empire.

After a century of European colonization Native peoples east of the Mississippi River Valley formed a political confederation aimed at preserving Native sovereignty. This Native confederacy emerged as a dominant force during the Seven Years War, the American Revolution, and the War of 1812. At times Native political interests aligned with the French and British Empires, but remained in opposition to the expansion of Anglo-American colonial settlements into Indian country. This course is designed to engage literature and epistemology surrounding these New World conflicts as a means of the colonial and post-colonial past in North America. We will explore the emergence of intersecting indigenous and European national identities tied to the social construction of space and race. In this course I will ask you to re-think American history by situating North America as a Native space, a place that was occupied and controlled by indigenous peoples. You will be asked to imagine a North America that was indigenous and adaptive, and not necessarily destined to be absorbed by European settler colonies. Accordingly, this course we will explore the intersections of European colonial settlement and Euro-American national expansion, alongside of the emergence of indigenous social formations that dominated the western interior until the middle of the 19th century. This course is intended to be a broad history of Indigenous North America during a tumultuous period, but close attention will be given to use and analysis of primary source evidence. Similarly, we will explore the necessity of using multiple genres of textual evidence – archival documents, oral history, material artifacts, etc., -- when studying indigenous history\n\nSpring 2024: HIST UN1512\n\nCourse Number Section/Call Number Times/Location Instructor Points Enrollment HIST 1512 001/11676 T Th 1:10pm - 2:25pm\n\n303 Hamilton Hall Michael Witgen 4.00 17/35\n\nHIST BC1760 INTRO AFRICAN HIST:1700-PRESNT. 4.00 points.\n\nSurvey of African history from the 18th century to the contemporary period.

As a result, environmental history places at center stage a wide range of previously overlooked historical actors such as plants, animals, and diseases. Moreover, by locating nature within human history, environmental history encourages its practitioners to rethink some of the fundamental categories through which our understanding of the natural world is expressed: wilderness and civilization, wild and tame, natural and artificial. For those interested in the study of ethnicity, environmental history casts into particularly sharp relief the ways in which the natural world can serve both to undermine and to reinforce the divisions within human societies. Although all human beings share profound biological similarities, they have nonetheless enjoyed unequal access to natural resources and to healthy environments—differences that have all-too-frequently been justified by depicting such conditions as “natural.”\n\nSpring 2024: HIST UN2222\n\nCourse Number Section/Call Number Times/Location Instructor Points Enrollment HIST 2222 001/11628 T Th 10:10am - 11:25am\n\n517 Hamilton Hall Karl Jacoby 4.00 39/70 HIST 2222 AU1/18961 T Th 10:10am - 11:25am\n\nOthr Other Karl Jacoby 4.00 5/5\n\nHIST UN2305 WAR IN GERMANY 1618-2018. 4.00 points.\n\nFor much of modern history Germany was Europe’s battlefield. Its soldiers wrote themselves into the annals of military history. But it was also a place where war was discussed, conceptualized and criticized with unparalleled vigor. Nowhere did the extreme violence of the seventeenth century and the early twentieth century leave a deeper mark than on Germany. Today, as we enter the twenty-first century, Germany is the nation that has perhaps come closest to drawing a final, concluding line under its military history. This course will chart the rise and fall of modern militarism in Germany. For those interested in military history per se, this course will not hold back from discussing battles, soldiers and weapons. But it will also offer an introduction to German history more generally. And through the German example we will address questions in political philosophy that haunted modern European history and continue to haunt America today. How is state violence justified? How can it be regulated and controlled? What is its future?\n\nSpring 2024: HIST UN2305\n\nCourse Number Section/Call Number Times/Location Instructor Points Enrollment HIST 2305 001/11686 M W 2:40pm - 3:55pm\n\n517 Hamilton Hall Adam Tooze 4.00 61/70\n\nFall 2024: HIST UN2305\n\nCourse Number Section/Call Number Times/Location Instructor Points Enrollment HIST 2305 001/11267 M W 2:40pm - 3:55pm\n\nRen Kraft Center Adam Tooze 4.00 68/70\n\nHIST UN2342 Britain, Ireland and Empire, 1789-1901. 4.00 points.\n\nNineteenth-century Britain has traditionally been portrayed as the dominant power in the world of its time: one that forged a path towards various kinds of ‘modernity’ at home, while ruthlessly subjugating and exploiting the peoples subject to its colonial empire. In this course, we will take a sceptical look at these claims. How coherent a political entity was ‘Britain’—a monarchy composed of at least four distinct and fractious nations, presiding over a scattered empire of trade, conquest and settlement? Who in Britain really benefited from the prosperity made possible by the dramatic industrial and imperial expansion that characterised the period? What forms of freedom, and what kinds of social control, were made possible by Victorian ideologies of ‘liberal’ government and laissez-faire economics? Why were British elites so often uncertain and divided when it came to questions of imperial rule—especially in Ireland, the oldest and nearest dependency of the empire? In the course of asking these questions, we will of course be learning about the history of Britain itself, alongside the parts of the world it interacted with during the nineteenth century: something that, thanks to a wealth of primary sources (many of them now online) and a strong tradition of sophisticated historiography, will be a highly rewarding intellectual experience. We will also, however, be learning and thinking about other things—the histories of capitalism, religion, gender, empire, fossil fuels, migration, agriculture, slavery and political ideology, among others—that are of a much more general, and contemporary relevance. We do not have to buy into simplistic narratives of nineteenth-century Britain’s importance or distinctiveness to recognize it as an interesting place for thinking through some of the central problems of global history and modern politics\n\nSpring 2024: HIST UN2342\n\nCourse Number Section/Call Number Times/Location Instructor Points Enrollment HIST 2342 001/11584 T Th 2:40pm - 3:55pm\n\n303 Hamilton Hall James Stafford 4.00 21/35 HIST 2342 AU1/18962 T Th 2:40pm - 3:55pm\n\nOthr Other James Stafford 4.00 3/3\n\nHIST BC2380 HISTORY OF FOOD IN EUROPE. 3.00 points.\n\nPrerequisites: Previous course in history strongly recommended.\n\nPrerequisites: Previous course in history strongly recommended.

It begins with the emergence of “Hollywood” as an industry and a place in the wake of WWI and ends with the rise of the so-called ‘New Hollywood’ in the 1970s and its treatment of the 1960s and the Vietnam War. For much of this period, Hollywood’s films were not protected free speech, making movies and stars peculiarly reflective of, and vulnerable to, changes in broader cultural and political dynamics. Students will become familiar with Hollywood’s institutional history over this half-century in order to understand the forces, both internal and external, that have shaped the presentation of what Americans do and don’t see on screens and to become skilled interpreters of American history at the movies\n\nSpring 2024: HIST UN2565\n\nCourse Number Section/Call Number Times/Location Instructor Points Enrollment HIST 2565 001/11603 T Th 2:40pm - 3:55pm\n\n702 Hamilton Hall Hilary-Anne Hallett 4.00 51/70\n\nHIST UN2661 LATIN AMERICAN CIVILIZATION II. 4.00 points.\n\nCC/GS/SEAS: Partial Fulfillment of Global Core Requirement\n\nThis course explores major themes in Latin American history from the independence period (ca 1810) to the present. We will hone in on Latin Americas “chronic” problems of social inequality, political polarization, authoritarianism, incomplete democratization, and troubled memory politics. The course covers economic, social, and cultural histories, and gives special weight to the transnational aspects of Latin American ideological struggles – from its dependency on Western capital to its ideological “inner Cold War” – and the way they influenced the subaltern strata of society. The section discussions are a crucial component of the course, and will focus on assigned historiography. While the lecture centers on constructing a cogent meta-narrative for Latin America’s modern era, in the section we will explore not only the historical “facts,” but will instead ask: how do historians know what they know about the past? What sources and analytic methods do they use to write history? And what ethical dilemmas do they confront when narrating politically-sensitive topics?\n\nSpring 2024: HIST UN2661\n\nCourse Number Section/Call Number Times/Location Instructor Points Enrollment HIST 2661 001/11504 M W 10:10am - 11:25am\n\n501 Northwest Corner Alfonso Salgado 4.00 85/105\n\nHIST UN2679 Atlantic Slave Trade. 4.00-4.50 points.\n\nThe history of human trafficking in the Atlantic world from the first European slaving expeditions in the late fifteenth century down to the final forced crossings in the era of the U.S. Civil War.

The underlying assumptions are that disease, and the ways we define disease, are simultaneously reflections of social and cultural values, as well as important factors in shaping those values. Also, it is maintained that the environments that we build determine the ways we live and die. The dread infectious and acute diseases in the nineteenth century, the chronic, degenerative conditions of the twentieth and the new, vaguely understood conditions rooted in a changing chemical and human-made environment are emblematic of the societies we created. Among the questions that will be addressed are: How does the health status of Americans reflect and shape our history? How do ideas about health reflect broader attitudes and values in American history and culture? How does the American experience with pain, disability, and disease affect our actions and lives? What are the responsibilities of the state and of the individual in preserving health? How have American institutions--from hospitals to unions to insurance companies--been shaped by changing longevity, experience with disability and death?\n\nHIST UN2987 Technology and US Politics. 4 points.\n\nThe course investigates the relation between politics and technology in the Unites States during the twentieth century. Following the telegraph, radio, the mainframe computer, the internet, and online platforms, the course asks how have Americans conceptualized the relation between technological developments and democratic ideals starting in the late nineteenth century? Are new technologies forms of control or of liberation? Do they enhance or curtail free speech? Has the public sphere been strengthened or weakened by new communication technologies? What has been the rule of government regulation in the adoption of these technologies? Students will be introduced to basic ideas and methodologies in the history of technology, while focusing on the relation between politics of technology.\n\nSpring 2024: HIST UN2987\n\nCourse Number Section/Call Number Times/Location Instructor Points Enrollment HIST 2987 001/11664 T Th 10:10am - 11:25am\n\nRen Kraft Center Alma Steingart 4 51/70\n\nHIST UN3120 Censorship and Freedom of Expression in Early Modern Europe. 4 points.\n\nIn this course we will examine theoretical and historical developments that framed the notions of censorship and free expression in early modern Europe. In the last two decades, the role of censorship has become one of the significant elements in discussions of early modern culture. The history of printing and of the book, of the rise national-political cultures and their projections of control, religious wars and denominational schisms are some of the factors that intensified debate over the free circulation of ideas and speech. Indexes, Inquisition, Star Chamber, book burnings and beheadings have been the subjects of an ever growing body of scholarship.

Yet housing, and its legal, social and political meanings and struggles around its distribution, possession and safety, is a concept that can only be fully understood as a historical phenomenon. In the industrializing and urbanizing world, the concept of “housing” emerged at the intersection of questions of property rights, the study of urban problems, and the legal and cultural distinctions between public and private spheres. Throughout the world, the provision of shelter for urban populations has been at the center of urban crises and conflicts, as well as their solutions. This course will examine the deep history of urban segregation, fights for healthy and safe housing, and scholarly and policy debates about the “planet of slums.” The course’s geographic scope is global, using both comparative and transnational approaches, and we will explore the connections between local and global movements and historical processes. Through a historically-oriented but interdisciplinary set of readings, students in this class will become familiar with the terms of debates about the right to shelter as a social, political and legal problem in the modern (nineteenth- and twentieth-century) world. We will explore how history provides a unique view on how the question of housing is a social justice issue connected to other ones like mass incarceration and the destruction wrought by wars, famines, and intergenerational racial, ethnic and class inequalities.

Dissecting key achievements in these areas from across the twentieth century, we shall explore intellectual and cultural contributions from East Central Europe to discussions of wider relevance. We shall also consider how the specific forms of creativity in this diverse region may be connected to and embedded in broader European and global trends\n\nSpring 2024: HIST UN3264\n\nCourse Number Section/Call Number Times/Location Instructor Points Enrollment HIST 3264 001/11968 T 10:10am - 12:00pm\n\n707 Hamilton Hall Ferenc Laczo 4.00 8/14\n\nHIST UN3268 The Critique of Curiosity. 4 points.\n\n“All persons desire to know,” Aristotle declared in his Metaphysics. But given that not all desires are good ones, the question naturally arises whether curiosity is. In the era of modern science and education, we tend to take this for granted. But for centuries – also well before Aristotle – people have concluded just the opposite. Their reasons have been various: religious, psychological, philosophical, pragmatic. In this junior seminar we will examine select thinkers in the stream of Western thought that has questioned the value of curiosity and, more fundamentally, of knowledge itself.\n\nSpring 2024: HIST UN3268\n\nCourse Number Section/Call Number Times/Location Instructor Points Enrollment HIST 3268 001/14860 Th 10:10am - 12:00pm\n\n402 International Affairs Bldg Mark Lilla 4 7/11\n\nHIST UN3274 Collapse: The Fall and Afterlife of the Soviet Union, Gorbachev to Putin. 4.00 points.\n\nOn Christmas Day 1991, Mikhail Gorbachev ended two things: his tenure as President of the Soviet Union, and the Soviet Union itself. The following day, Boris Yeltsin entered office as the first president of the Russian Federation, and without delay, began to institute radical economic and social reforms. Under his watch, the country privatized national industry, cut the state budget, and courted foreign multinational businesses. The world most commonly used to describe Russia in the early 1990s is “disappear”: money, jobs, food, and people. The very things that Soviet-style socialism had committed itself to providing for started to vanish as a result of invisible and market forces. At the same time as they were being told to welcome the approaching era of capitalist abundance, ordinary Russians were scrambling to cope with and recover from all that appeared to be suddenly and permanently missing from their pay stubs, kitchen tables, and family photographs. This course will explore what emerged in the spaces left empty after Soviet-style socialism’s demise. The course will be divided into three parts. The first part of the semester will examine the origins of the Soviet Union’s collapse and its breakup into fifteen successor states. Who was Mikhail Gorbachev, and why did the reforms instituted as part of glasnost and perestroika fail to revitalize the Soviet system? How did citizens - elites and average people alike - from Russia, the Soviet republics, and satellite states witness the collapse, and how did they manage the immediate transition to capitalism? The second part of the semester will survey the political, economic, and social processes that followed the collapse. How did former Soviet citizens reintegrate themselves in the new economies, political movements, and social structures that emerged in the Russian Federation under Yeltsin? In what ways did privatization and the arrival of foreign capital shape labor practices, consumer habits, the natural and built environment, and forms of cultural expression? What forms did nationalist movements in the former republics and and Warsaw Pact countries take? Finally, the third part of the course will focus on Putin’s ascendancy to the presidency and its consequences for Russian citizens at home and Russia’s image abroad. We will consider the role that memory and myth play in the formation of a “United Russian” consciousness, the costs and benefits of life in Putin’s Russia, and the transformation of the international system under Vladimir Vladimirovich. By semester’s end, students will have acquired the content and analytical literacy to place present-day Russia in its specific historical context and identify multiple sources of causation that may help explain Russia’s transition from socialism to capitalism to Putinism during the past quarter century\n\nSpring 2024: HIST UN3274\n\nCourse Number Section/Call Number Times/Location Instructor Points Enrollment HIST 3274 001/14736 W 4:10pm - 6:00pm\n\n610 Lewisohn Hall Yana Skorobogatov 4.00 12/14\n\nHIST UN3437 CORP BEHAVIOR ＆ PUBLIC HEALTH. 4.00 points.\n\nPriority given to majors and concentrators, seniors, and juniors.\n\nIn the decades since the publication of Silent Spring and the rise of the environmental movement, public awareness of the impact of industrial products on human health has grown enormously. There is growing concern over BPA, lead, PCBs, asbestos, and synthetic materials that make up the world around us. This course will focus on environmental history, industrial and labor history as well as on how twentieth century consumer culture shapes popular and professional understanding of disease. Throughout the term the class will trace the historical transformation of the origins of disease through primary sources such as documents gathered in lawsuits, and medical and public health literature. Students will be asked to evaluate historical debates about the causes of modern epidemics of cancer, heart disease, lead poisoning, asbestos-related illnesses and other chronic conditions. They will also consider where responsibility for these new concerns lies, particularly as they have emerged in law suits. Together, we will explore the rise of modern environmental movement in the last 75 years\n\nSpring 2024: HIST UN3437\n\nCourse Number Section/Call Number Times/Location Instructor Points Enrollment HIST 3437 001/11661 W 8:10am - 10:00am\n\n302 Fayerweather David Rosner 4.00 14/15\n\nHIST UN3501 Indians and Empires in North America. 4.00 points.\n\nIn this course you will be asked to re-think American history. That is, we will approach the history of America as a continental history. This will require that we think of North America as a New World space, a place that was inhabited and occupied by indigenous peoples, and then remade by the arrival and settlement of Europeans. You will be asked to imagine a North America that was indigenous and adaptive, as well as colonial and Euro-American. This approach to the study of North American history is designed to challenge the epistemology and literature of the history of colonization and American expansion, which displaces Native peoples from the central narrative of American history by placing them at the physical margins of colonial and national development. Instead we will explore the intersection and integration of indigenous and Euro-American national identity and national space in North America and trace their co-evolution from first contact through the early nineteenth century\n\nSpring 2024: HIST UN3501\n\nCourse Number Section/Call Number Times/Location Instructor Points Enrollment HIST 3501 001/14731 W 4:10pm - 6:00pm\n\n402 International Affairs Bldg Michael Witgen 4.00 10/15\n\nHIST UN3517 The Historical Imagination in Caribbean Literature. 4.00 points.\n\nCaribbean literature offers complicated and vivid portrayals of the Caribbean’s past, and grapples with difficult histories lived by its people that compromised colonial archives can only partially capture. Literary works far exceed the limited narratives of Caribbean history by imagining entire worlds that official documents could never contain, rich selves, cultures and communities built by many generations of Caribbean people. This course is aimed at bringing forth a broader understanding of Caribbean history by examining a body of creative works by feminist and womanist writers that continuously remain attuned to the complexities of the past, which are either underrepresented or absent in the record. Chosen literary texts will also be paired with historical works that will illuminate and contextualize the multiple themes with which these Caribbean authors frequently engage, including slavery, and colonialism, racism and colorism, migration and immigration, gender and sexuality, poverty and globalization. From these pairings, students will explore both the divergences and alignments in how writers and historians approach the work of retelling the past, and will acquire reading and writing skills that will foster thoughtful critical analysis of the ever-changing contours of the Caribbean’s history\n\nSpring 2024: HIST UN3517\n\nCourse Number Section/Call Number Times/Location Instructor Points Enrollment HIST 3517 001/11646 W 2:10pm - 4:00pm\n\n302 Fayerweather Natasha Lightfoot 4.00 6/15\n\nHIST UN3564 Dancing New York City in the 20th Century. 4.00 points.\n\nThe 20th century saw New York City emerge as an artistic and economic capital on the world stage. Although these trends are often considered separately, the history of dance in NYC demonstrates their interrelations. This seminar will interweave the history of New York City with the history of dance across the twentieth century. It will use the work of dancers, choreographers, and critics to illuminate social, political, and cultural trends in New York’s urban life. Topics include dance in working-class leisure, dance as cultural activism during the Popular Front and Black Arts eras, immigration and assimilation in NYC, and the impact of urban renewal on communities and the performing arts. No prior experience with dance is necessary; this course welcomes all students interested in cultural history, urban history, and intellectual history. Through reading and viewing assignments, class discussion and activities, and written assessments, students in this course will learn to analyze movement, write clearly and vividly about dance performance, conduct primary source research, and assess the role of the performing arts within the New York cityscape\n\nSpring 2024: HIST UN3564\n\nCourse Number Section/Call Number Times/Location Instructor Points Enrollment HIST 3564 001/11625 M 2:10pm - 4:00pm\n\n302 Fayerweather Emily Hawk 4.00 15/15\n\nHIST BC3598 Black Left Feminism and Anti-Colonial Liberation Move. 4.00 points.\n\nThis course examines the theory and practice of transnational Black feminism in a context of radical anti-colonial movements.

This mass urbanization not only created new demographic centers of world Jewry, but also fundamentally transformed Jewish political and cultural life. In this course, we shall analyze primary source material, literary accounts as well as secondary sources as we examine the Jewish encounter with the city, and see how Jewish culture was shaped by and helped to shape urban culture. We shall compare Jewish life in six cities spanning from Eastern Europe to the United States and consider how Jews’ concerns molded the urban economy, urban politics, and cosmopolitan culture. We shall also consider the ways in which urbanization changed everyday Jewish life. What impact did it have on Jewish economic and religious life? What role did gender and class play in molding the experiences of Jews in different cities scattered throughout the world?\n\nSpring 2024: HIST UN3604\n\nCourse Number Section/Call Number Times/Location Instructor Points Enrollment HIST 3604 001/11644 M 2:10pm - 4:00pm\n\n328 Uris Hall Rebecca Kobrin 4 12/20\n\nHIST UN3726 The Crucible of Nations: Race, Migration, and the Modern Mediterranean. 4.00 points.\n\nThis course is an historical introduction to the study of race and migration in the modern Mediterranean with a particular focus on histories from Africa and the Middle East. We will explore the fundamental migration events that have shaped Mediterranean history, including global settler movements, enslavement and forced migration, partitions and population transfers, and contemporary refugee crises. Building on Mediterranean history, we will discuss how race and migration shaped successive border regimes and competing world orders from 19th century to the present. Analyzing a diverse array of primary sources from legal texts, government reports, and maps to film, poetry, and visual arts, we will pursue answers to questions such as: What are the legal, social, and political structures which govern international migration? What laws, ideas, and affects construct political borders? What happens to those who breach them? How do the legacies of racial slavery, settler colonialism, and ethno-nationalism unsettle the borders of contemporary Mediterranean?\n\nSpring 2024: HIST UN3726\n\nCourse Number Section/Call Number Times/Location Instructor Points Enrollment HIST 3726 001/15034 T 2:10pm - 4:00pm\n\n401 Hamilton Hall Hatice Polat 4.00 5/15\n\nHIST UN3741 American Commercial and Business Interests in Turkey Until the 1960s. 4.00 points.\n\nThis course provides a comprehensive exploration of the American commercial and business interests in the Ottoman Empire and its successor, Turkey, from the beginning of the relations in the early 19th century until the 1960s. Through a multidisciplinary approach, students will also examine the diplomatic, economic, and cultural factors that shaped the relationship between the United States and Turkey during this period. In addition to the state-level relations, personal accounts of the Americans settled in Turkey will be highly consulted. The course begins by delving into the historical context of American-Ottoman relations, highlighting key events and developments that generally influenced commercial and business interactions. Students will gain insights into the diplomatic efforts, trade agreements, private initiatives, and cultural exchanges that fostered economic ties between the two countries in changing periods. Throughout the course, students will critically analyze primary and secondary sources, engage in discussions, and prepare a research paper to deepen their understanding of the topic\n\nSpring 2024: HIST UN3741\n\nCourse Number Section/Call Number Times/Location Instructor Points Enrollment HIST 3741 001/14732 W 2:10pm - 4:00pm\n\n253 International Affairs Bldg Murat Iplikci 4.00 6/15\n\nHIST BC3770 African Communities in New York, 1900 to the Present. 4.00 points.\n\nThis class explores the history of voluntary migrations from Africa to the United States over the course of the 20th century. This course is designed as a historical research seminar that is open to students with prior coursework in African Studies, Africana Studies, Race and Ethnic Studies, or History. Thematically the course dwells at a point of intersection between African history, Black History, and Immigration History. As part of the Barnard Engages curriculum, this class is collaboratively designed with the Harlem-based non-profit organization, African Communities Together. The aim of this course is to support the mission of ACT by producing a historically grounded digital advocacy project. The mission of ACT is to empower immigrants from Africa and their families to integrate socially, advance economically, and engage civically. To advance this mission, ACT must confront the reality that in the current political moment new legal, political, and social barriers are being erected to the integration, advancement, and engagement of African immigrants on a daily basis. As immigrants, as Black people, as Africans, and often as women, low-income people, LGBT people, and Muslims, African immigrants experience multiple intersecting forms of marginalization. Now more than ever, it is critical that African immigrants be empowered to tell their own stories—not just of persecution and suffering, but of resilience and resistance\n\nSpring 2024: HIST BC3770\n\nCourse Number Section/Call Number Times/Location Instructor Points Enrollment HIST 3770 001/00247 M 2:10pm - 4:00pm\n\n308 Diana Center Abosede George 4.00 10/15\n\nHIST UN3798 Fighting Inequality: Struggles for Economic Justice in the Global South. 4.00 points.\n\nThis seminar explores the history of economic justice in the “Global South,” with a particular focus on African movements for anti-colonialism and economic redistribution. It interrogates the concept of the “Global South” and analyzes the ways activists, political figures and thinkers fought for economic justice. The class starts with a focus on economic theories of redistribution. It then analyzes how slavery and emancipation, as well as capitalism and colonialism shaped 19th century hierarchies and struggles for economic and political rights. The second half of the course focuses on colonial exploitation and anticolonial struggles for economic sovereignty in the 20th century. The course ends with a study of postcolonial and early 21st century movements for economic sovereignty and demands for reparations and redistribution\n\nSpring 2024: HIST UN3798\n\nCourse Number Section/Call Number Times/Location Instructor Points Enrollment HIST 3798 001/14738 W 2:10pm - 4:00pm\n\n602 Northwest Corner Thomas Zuber 4.00 8/16\n\nHIST BC3823 RACE/RACISM/ANTIRACISM: STUDIES IN GLOBAL THOUGHT. 4.00 points.\n\nRACE/RACISM/ANTIRACISM: STUDIES IN GLOBAL THOUGHT Recent protests against racial violence erupting across the United States have demanded that the United States address systemic injustice entrenched in its national history. The Black Lives Matter movement has extended still further, inciting communities across the globe to raise their voices against discrimination and inequality. Rather than viewing the United States— and the north Atlantic, more generally— through an exceptionalist lens, this seminar draws on the strong transnational resonance of the Black Lives Matter movement and the compelling responses of global communities across distinct demographics and colonial histories to decenter the historical origins of race thinking and provincialize its conceptual centrality as a first step in understanding its reach and relevance as a global signifier of “difference” today. How might we develop critical studies of race and racism that are truly global and extend beyond the historical experience of the North Atlantic, and North America in particular? Might we consider the concept history of race, commonly associated with the Atlantic World and plantation slavery as a form of historical difference proximate to other practices of social hierarchy and distinction across the modern world? How can scholarship that addresses questions of black vitality, fugitivity and Afropessimism engage productively and rigorously with questions of colonial servitude and postcolonial sovereignty that emanates from anticaste thought, ideas of Islamic universality, Pan-Africanism, or heterodox Marxisms? An exercise in comparative thinking, this seminar will function as an interstitial home for intellectual engagements in both the Global South and North, excavating linkages between injustices perpetrated through divisions of race, caste, and minority status, as well as the conceptual innovations born from struggles against them. We are explicitly focused on the relationship between worldmaking and concept formation. Questions of historical comparison and conceptual convergence are important. So, too the forms of sociopolitical solidarity and political utopias that have arisen as a consequence of struggles against enslavement and imperialism. Every seminar session will open with a twenty-minute discussion about political and social historical contexts. However, this is a course focused on the close and careful reading of ideas and concepts in a manner similar to courses in the history of ideas and/or political thought\n\nSpring 2024: HIST BC3823\n\nCourse Number Section/Call Number Times/Location Instructor Points Enrollment HIST 3823 001/00250 T 4:10pm - 6:00pm\n\n308 Diana Center Anupama Rao 4.00 12/15\n\nHIST UN3839 SENIOR THESIS SEMINAR. 4.00 points.\n\nA year-long course for outstanding senior majors who want to conduct research in primary sources on a topic of their choice in any aspect of history, and to write a senior thesis possibly leading toward departmental honors.

It is open to all alumni of that class, from Fall 2023 or earlier. The goal of this research seminar is to craft a “virtual textbook” that gathers materials for each session of The Black Sea in History and posts them to a student-designed site. The primary “pull” of this class is that upper-level undergraduates, MA students, and PhD students will write (at least) one research article that will be published on the site. The site will serve as a textbook for future iterations of The Black Sea in History, and, while we will have a complete version by the end of the semester, future students will also be able to contribute. BSVT will be publicly accessible, so not limite"
