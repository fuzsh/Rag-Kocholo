November 9, 1799 is an early candidate since that is when Napoleon seized power in France. Hoping to ease the difficulty, historians date by isolated wars. They disarticulate the Napoleonic Wars in a linear series:\n\nWar of the Second Coalition 1798-1802\n\nWar of the Third Coalition 1805\n\nWar of the Fourth Coalition 1806-7\n\nWar of the Fifth Coalition 1809\n\nWar of the Sixth Coalition 1812-14\n\nWar of the Seventh Coalition 1815\n\nThe successive numerical coordinates for the Coalitions offer regularity, but that regularity is undercut by the shifting make-up of that Coalition (sometimes Prussia was in, sometimes not; sometimes Russia, sometimes not) and by the discontinuity and ambiguity of the dates.\n\nArticles"
