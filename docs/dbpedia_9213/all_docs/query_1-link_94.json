        "text": "Bratislava, Slovakia - Planning your trip\n\nBratislava is the capital and largest city in Slovakia. Every visitor will be surprised by the history of this medieval city, which dates back two thousand years when its territory was fortified and settled by the Celts and Romans. Because the city survived the Celts, the Romans, the Kingdom of Hungary, the Austro-Hungarian Empire and Soviet domination it's easy to fall in love with its Old Town, filled with stunning historical monuments including some weird bronze figures. Have you heard about Čumil? The famous sculpture it's only one of the attractions surrounded by stylish local stores, great cafes and fun bars spread out everywhere. In addition, you will be surprised by the mix of old and new. While the city has castles and the peculiar UFO Bridge, Bratislava is also the wealthiest and economically most important region in Slovakia, several multinational companies have their headquarters over there, which attracts a diversity of professionals and students giving the city vibrancy and dynamism. From the peculiar UFO Bridge to Bratislava Castle, this incredibly city has it all.\n\nTransport in Bratislava - After arriving in Bratislava, the most convenient ways to visit the city are:\n\n1. Bratislava CARD, which includes free admission to museums and galleries, free walking tour, unlimited use of public transport and other discounts.\n\n2. Hop-on Hop-off tours. The famous red bus includes different prices and tours around the city where visitors can explore the most popular sightseeings while listening to audio commentary about the passing monuments in their language. The Blue Church and Bratislava Castle are included.\n\n3. Explore by yourself. Of course, you can buy single tickets in the bus stations to visit the city by yourself. I confess I don't find it easy to understand. Credit card is accepted in the machines. Visit Bratislava offer several options of tours with local guides which are interesting options to customize your trip.\n\nBe aware there is zero tolerance for alcohol.\n\nIf your question is: Is Bratislava worth Visiting? The answer is YES!\n\nBratislava is the only one European capital city, which borders with two other countries – Hungary and Austria. The smallest capitals of Europe (more than 50x smaller than New York City), is located just an hour from Vienna – 60km far away from Austria capital. The city is compact and easily accessible on foot.\n\nBratislava is known for its rich history that dates back more than two thousand years. With a medieval ambiance, the city has a rich historical past, delicious cuisine, and an undeniable charm. In addition, Bratislava offers a variety of free attractions and you can easily book a tour bus in the downtown area to visit the top places around the city in a 45 min to 2h tour. Taking a day trip from Vienna is a very plausible option. Visitors can leave Vienna in the morning, see most sights in the beautiful Bratislava during the day and be back before bedtime. There are several options to travel by train or bus (with fares around 5 Euros each way) and there is no immigration to cross the border. It’s a great day trip to add in your Eurotrip.\n\n1. Explore the old town on a day trip to Bratislava – Bratislava is the only capital worldwide sharing borders with two countries, Austria and Hungary. The close proximity of the Slovak capital makes visiting Vienna and Budapest great ideas for day trips from or to Bratislava. If you have limited time to visit the city, make sure to go direct to the Old Town where most places to see and thinks to do are concentrated, from there it’s easy to find out how to book a guide or a bus to visit the top attractions around the city.\n\n2. Take pictures with the famous Čumil – Bratislava is known for its weird bronze figures. Walking around the Old Town, you’ll discover all of them.\n\nČumil, which the Slovak word actually means “watcher” is the most famous of them. There are a couple of theories about his name. Maybe he’s trying to get a look under the ladies’ skirts or perhaps he’s a typical communist-era worker who works little and watches a lot? Or maybe he’s resting after a hard day’s work cleaning the sewer. Either way, this sympathetic man is the most photographed sculptures around the town. Paparazzi, Schöner Náci, and Napoleon’s Soldier are other ones you may take a look.\n\nPassport and Visa – Slovakia is a party to the Schengen Agreement. This means that most people may enter Slovakia for up to 90 days for tourist or business purposes without a visa.\n\nCurrency – Euros €. Slovakia joined the European Union in 2004 and adopted the euro on 1 January 2009. Exchange rate of former Slovak crown (Sk) was 1 € = 30.1260 Sk.\n\nLanguage – Slovak is the official language of the Slovak Republic. The most widely spoken foreign languages are English, German, Russian, Hungarian, Polish, Roma and French.\n\nTax Free – If you have permanent residence in a non-EU country, you are eligible for tax free shopping with minimum purchase amount of 100.00 EUR.\n\nTipping – There is no strict rule about tipping in Slovakia. Ten percent of the total is more than enough. When handing your waiter the money, tell him how much you’d like to pay, not how much you’d like to receive back in change. Do the same if paying by credit card, or just leave the tip in cash.\n\nPopulation – The current population of Slovakia is 5.6M. Bratislava is the capital and the country’s largest city by population, although it is one of the smallest capitals in Europe. The estimated population is around 427,000.\n\nElectrical Power – 220-volt AC, 50Hz power supply with two-pin continental plugs. Same as in majority of other European countries.\n\nEconomy – The Bratislava Region is the wealthiest and economically most important region in Slovakia. The majority of governmental institutions, as well as many subsidiaries of multinational companies have their headquarters in Bratislava. Most population works in the service sector, mainly composed of trade, banking, IT, telecommunication industry and tourism."
