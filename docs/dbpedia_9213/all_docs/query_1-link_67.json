        "text": "1. Bratislavský hrad: A Royal Treat\n\nSituated directly above the Danube river at the heart of the Bratislava, the Bratislavsky hrad stands as the sole castle of Slovakia's capital. For centuries, it has been one of the city's dominant features, mainly because of its impressive size, architecture, and location. Enjoy spectacular views of Austria, Bratislava, and even Hungary when skies are clear from the castle's prime location high on a hill of the Little Carpathinans mountain range, where the city is located. When the sun is shining, enjoy a slow walk in the green gardens of the Bratislava Castle with the Gothic-constructed walls and foliage providing the perfect blend of nature and man-made beauty.\n\n2. Televízna veža na Kamzíku: The Ultimate TV Tower\n\nSpread across 1,434 ft (437m) of land on the Kamzík hill in Bratislava, the Televízna vea na Kamzíku (Kamzík TV Tower) is a transmission tower that measures exactly 196 meters. Designed by five architects and constructed in 1975, this impressive structure overlooks the city and the observation deck provides great views of the Czech Republic, Hungary, and Austria. Its panorama restaurant Altitude allows visitors to enjoy scrumptious Mediterranean cuisine as they experience the 360-degreee view from the comfort of their seats.\n\n3. Slavín War Memorial: Proof of Liberation\n\nClearly visible from the country's capital, the Slavin War Memorial is a military cemetery and memorial monument established in 1960 in honor of the soldiers who died in the line of duty during the last weeks of World War II. Pay tribute to the 6,845 fallen soldiers who rest in this cemetery, which hosts a mix of individual and mixed graves. Situated in a rich villa quarter, its location is a sight to behold, offering breathtaking views of the city from all angles.\n\n4. Modrý kostolík: Beauty Covered in Blue\n\nBuilt between 1909 and 1913, the Modrý kostolík stands tall on the eastern side of Bratislava. Its mosaics, blue-gazed roof, façade, and majolicas earned it the name The Little Blue Church, but it was actually originally painted in pastel colors, only to be redone in blue in the decades to come. Witness the Hungarian Secessionist-inspired beauty of this Catholic church come to life as it blends in seamlessly with the blue skies on a clear day. The altarpiece depicting St. Elizabeth in the interior of the church will leave you feeling as if you've stepped through the gates of heaven.\n\n5. UFO Bridge: A Whole New World\n\nStretching 1,413ft (430.8m) over the Danube in Bratislava, the UFO Bridge (Popularly referred to as 'Most SNP') is the earth's only cable-stayed bridge to have one cable-stayed plane and one pylon. Its construction took place between 1967 and 1972 and it officially opened on August 26, 1972. In the east pillar, the elevator will take you up to a flying-saucer-like structure at the pylon's peak, housing a restaurant with a crystal clear view of the entire city."
