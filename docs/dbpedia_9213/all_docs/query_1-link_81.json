        "text": "Bratislava, Slovakia\n\nHank Schrader, USMA '71, Europe Destination & Europe River Cruise Expert\n\nAnne Schrader, Certified Travel Counselor & Certified Luxury Cruise Specialist\n\nwww.dreamdestinations.com\n\nOf the 4 countries on an upper Danube route, probably the least known country is Slovakia. It was once a part of the Hapsburg Empire, then part of Czechoslovakia, and finally became independent in 1989.\n\nBratislava’s city limits actually share the borders of Austria and Hungary..\n\nSo, let’s explore together and learn about Bratislava and its key sights.\n\nBratislava Castle-- The massive Bratislava Castle is located on a hill that has been populated as early as in the Stone Age. The Celts built a fortified stronghold here in the 1st century BC. The Romans, the Germans, the Slavs, the Hungarians and the Austrians have ruled the area in the later centuries. Bratislava Castle became the residence of the Hungarian Kings and was repeatedly rebuilt in various styles.\n\nThe most famous residence of the castle was Maria Theresa, who used the castle as her official seat to rule the Kingdom of Hungary.\n\nFrom the exterior, it looks like a square with 4 turrets at the corners, but inside it has irregular shapes, gardens, and other buildings other than the castle. Again, even the turrets are deceiving. 3 are attached to the roof, while only the turret on the southwest corner is an actual turret. The actual turret is 47 meter tall (over 141 feet).\n\nThis famous landmark almost did not survive after it burned down in 1811. It lay in ruins until 1953, when reconstruction began.\n\nToday it houses the exhibition of the Slovak National Museum and serves as a state function venue. The museum entrance fee is currently 10 Euros. Many river cruise companies offer hikes up to the castle as part of their active wellness offerings.\n\nAs Bratislava became the capital of the Hungarian Kingdom in the 16th century, the Cathedral was the coronation place for Hungarian Emperors. There were 11 Hungarian Kings and 8 queens crowned here between 1563 and 1830.\n\nOn the top of the church tower, some 85 meters (280 feet) above ground, there is a 1 m high copy of the Hungarian royal crown that weighs 300 kilograms.\n\nMichael's Gate is the only surviving gate of the former walled city of Bratislava. Medieval Bratislava was entered through four gates, and Michael’s Gate is the northern entrance.\n\nThe 3 other gates were Vydrica (the western gate), the Laurinc (the eastern gate) and the fisherman’s gate, which was added to the original gate system.\n\nNot only was it an entrance to the city, but it also served as the watchtower of the original city fortifications. Over 50 meters high, the tower was built in the early 14th century, and was rebuilt many times since its original construction.\n\nAs it is no longer needed as a watchtower, it now serves as a museum and has a collection of medieval arms and town fortification on display. The tower also offers a stunning view of the city for just a few euros.\n\nThe following 2 pictures are about the Laurinc Gate that was built in the 14th century. The gate was demolished by the order of Maria Theresa, as the walls of the city were limiting growth of the town. It did not have a tower on top of the gate.\n\nDuring the communist era, after first being used by the Council of Commissioner (a quasi-government of Slovakia), the palace was used as an activity center for Bratislava schoolchildren, known as the “House of Pioneers and Youth”.\n\nAfter its reconstruction in 1996, the Grassalkovich Palace became the residence of the Slovak Republic's president. Its excellent garden is now a public park.\n\nChatam Sofer Memorial--The Jewish community has always played an important role in the life of the city. Although the historical Jewish quarter under Bratislava Castle was destroyed, the most significant Jewish funerary shrine and place of religious worship still can be found in the Castle Hil.\n\nThere is a preserved part of original Jewish Cemetery with graves of rabbis including the famous Bratislava rabbi Chatam Sofer, the most important figure in the history of Jews in Bratislava.\n\nThe Blue Church (its proper name is Church of St. Elizabeth) is very different from the old town portion of Bratislava. It is an Art Noveau style that was built in 1913.\n\nAccording to the Bratislava tourist office website, the blue church is a popular place for wedding and baptisms.\n\nThere is actually a sad story behind the inspiration for the greeter statue, but no one knows for certain the truth of this story. While there are various versions of the story, the greeter went mad at the loss of a woman he loved. The story becomes clouded here—did she not respond, was his lady deported by the Nazis in WW II to a concentration camp? The greeter, berefted with grief, is said to have dressed each day in tails and offer flowers to all the ladies he encountered wandering the old town square area.\n\nThe UFO Bridge, as it is popularly known, has an observation deck that looks like it came from outer space. The bridge is 95 meters tall (285 feet tall).\n\nOur Final Thoughts\n\nIt is a wonderful thing to visit the former iron curtain countries and learn more about them. Bratislava is a blending of the old and new and until recently been ruled by kings and queens and later under communist domination. This is an upbeat, thriving country eager to put its past domination as only a history lesson and they look to a bright future.\n\nWe hope you enjoyed this report and learned something about this country.\n\nWe are travel experts, ocean and river cruise specialists, and Europe destination experts.
