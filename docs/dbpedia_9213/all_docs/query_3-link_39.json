        "text": "Hungary is a country of musicians and of music lovers. Among these, we should mention Franz Liszt, Bela Bartok, and Zoltan Kodaly. Franz Liszt, the son of a steward to Prince Esterhazy, was born in Doborjan, Hungary in 1811. He took his first piano lessons with his father. A brilliant musician, he studied composition in Vienna with Antonio Salieri, and the piano with Karl Czerny. From 1823 to 1835, he came to Paris to perfect his musical education and made the acquaintance of Chopin, Hugo, Lamartine, Berlioz, and Heine. Between 1839 and 1847, he performed throughout Europe and achieved a level of fame never equalled by any performer before him. In 1847, he ended his career under the influence of the Russian Princess Carloyne Sayn Wittgenstein. Liszt became cantor at the court of the Grand Duchy of Weimar until 1861. He then settled in Rome where he took holy orders. He died during the Bayreuth Festival in 1886. As both a pianist and conductor, Liszt created a musical academy in Budapest where he taught. A great connoisseur of Hungarian folklore, he leaves us no less than 19 Hungarian rhapsodies.\n\nFrantz Liszt Â© Hungarian National Tourist Office"
