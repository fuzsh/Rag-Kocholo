        "text": "For Europe:\n\nPortugal: Maybe Porto should they never got Lisbon, not sure there would even be a Portugal if it is reduced to just the County of Portugal, but it's an alternative.\n\nSpain: Lisbon (if united Iberia), Toledo, Cordoba, Barcelona... depends how it forms).\n\nFrance: ...Laon? Paris was already very important since the Caroligian times, can't see an alternative tbh.\n\nEngland: Winchester, Tamworth (Mercia supreme) or York (Northumbria supreme).\n\nNetherlands: Brussel if an unified Benelux or the aforementioned The Hague.\n\nGermany: Aachen, Speyer, Frankfurt, Worms, Nuremberg, Mainz, Vienna or Prague.\n\nItaly: Rome is pretty much a given, if Italy don't own it maybe Florence, Milan or Pavia.\n\nPoland: Krakow.\n\nNorway: Bergen was kinda prominent in the Middle Ages, but the current location of Oslo is more strategic IMO.\n\nScotland: Stirling and Scone, in case it never gets Lothian\n\nHungary: Pozsony or Székesfehérvar.\n\nRussia: Novgorod, Vladimir or Kiev.\n\nBulgaria: Tyrnovo.\n\nFor the Americas:\n\nUSA: Pretty much anywhere, building a capital from the ground was the best outcome.\n\nBrazil: Rio de Janeiro (as it was) or Salvador (capital during the earlier colonial era)\n\nArgentina: Rosario if the civil wars don't favors Buenos Aires, though its location is perfect for a capital.\n\nFor Asia/The Middle East:\n\nTurkey: Konya\n\nSyria: Beirut, Antioch or even Jerusalem\n\nPersia: Ctesiphon or Isfahan, maybe Fars.\n\nIndia: Vijayanagara, Mysore, Maharasthra... getting India unified by itself has too many possibilities.\n\nJapan: Kyoto.\n\nVietnam: Saigon\n\nRun out of ideas.\n\nMaking Paris not the capital of France would probably either require a POD back in Late Antiquity or alternatively WWIII.\n\nFor England, London is such a massively strategic location that it seems difficult to change it. I mean, maybe Winchester stays capital of England while London becomes the commercial heart? Canterbury? York?\n\nRussia (not Kievan Rus) could have any city on the Golden Ring. It's mainly because of one skilled leader (Ivan Kalita) that Moscow ever got the momentum going on unifying Russia thanks to Ivan being able to convince the Russian Orthodox Patriarch to move to Moscow. Tver seems most likely, but in theory, it could have been any of those cities.\n\nPoland's another interesting one--there's always Krakow, but Krakow is extremely close to the German states. Gniezno is possibly the best, since it had great historical significance and is also the center of the Polish church. There's also Płock, which was the capital of the same Duchy of Masovia that founded Warsaw.\n\nGermany could have so many alternate capitals, but the best is probably Frankfurt. If West Germany had moved the capital there instead of Bonn (a real possibility), there's no real reason they would've ever moved it back to Berlin.\n\nPersia: Ctesiphon or Isfahan, maybe Fars.\n\nIsfahan is apparently very high in the consideration for the Iranian government's plans to move the capital from Tehran, so it won't be alternate much longer. I'd suspect Shiraz in Fars province is likely up there too. Speaking of Persia, Qom is a very noteworthy city that could have served as a Persian capital at some point in history (it almost did toward the end of the Qajar period thanks to Russian activities near Tehran).\n\nWell if the Germans win ww2, it potentially remains Vichy. If the Germans win ww1, maybe France loses Paris, idk how bad German demands would be.\n\nIt seems like Hitler wanted to restore the Holy Roman Empire's borders in terms of concessions, so the Vichy government will move back to Paris for legitimacy's sake. WWI Germany was far less ambitious in their demand for border adjustments, and definitely wouldn't include Paris.\n\nThis is a good topic. I will try to cover the more important European countries.\n\nRussia: Its pretty easy to get another capital than Moscow, as what became the Grand Dukes of Moscow were originally the Grand Dukes of Vladimir, with the capital of course of Vladimir. You really just have to get the Mongols destroy a different set of cities. Depending on what happens with the Mongols, the capital could wind up being Kiev after all. Novgorod, the runner up in the unify Russia contest, could have won instead. And of course the Communists could have just kept it at Petograd/ St. Petersburg.\n\nFrance: Very unlikely to be anything other than Paris, as it was the Dukes of France/ Counts of Paris who essentially created France as it exists in the first place. The best POD is no French revolution, and the Court stays at Versailles, and if they wind up with an assembly after all but keep their heads, the assembly is at Versailles as well. Otherwise you have to do something like maintain the Merovingian dynasty and have them settle in someplace like Reims.\n\nEngland: Even more unlikely to have a different capital than with France. London is the first place where you can cross the Thames after landing from the Continent. It was the capital for the Romans as well. It is always going to be the largest and most important city in England regardless. Though technically, the capital was never in the City of London, Westminster was a separate place until the creation of Greater London.\n\nGermany: Have the place united by anyone other than the Hohenollerns. One obvious POD is that the 1848 Parliament succeeds in uniting Gemrany and the capital stays in Frankfurt. As late as 1990, there was some sentiment for keeping it in Bonn. If the Cold War doesn't end and the DDR contines to exist, tha capital of Federal Republic stays in Bonn.\n\nItaly: If the Papal States survive or in some other way don't get absorbed into either the Kingdom or the Republic of Italy, then the capital is in Florence\n\nSpain: Easy to change because it was Filipe II who picked Madrid, and he could have picked pretty much any other location.\n\nPoland: Krakow is the obvious alternative\n\nTurkey: Istanbul is the obvious alternative\n\nSmaller places: Ireland (Armagh), Scotland (Dunbarton), Norway (Bergen), Belgium (Antwerp), Netherlands (Utrecht), Lithuania (Kaunas), Switzerland (Zurich), Hungary (Estzergom), Serbia (Nis), Bulgaria (Trnovo), Greece (Naiplion). For countries not listed, I can't see plausible alternatives to their OTL capitals"
