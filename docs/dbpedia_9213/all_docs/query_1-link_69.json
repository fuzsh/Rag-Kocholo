        "text": "Sitting atop a hill in the capital of Slovakia, the Bratislava castle is one of the city’s most important landmarks.\n\nBratislava Castle History\n\nIt was first mentioned as Preslava castle in 907 and for a long time was known by this name (or Pressburg in German). By the year 1000, under King Stephen I of Hungary, the castle was an important one for the Kingdom of Hungary. It helped defend the kingdom in many battles against Bohemian and German attackers between the 10th and 13th centuries. The Bratislava castle was also one of the few ones to defend itself successfully against the Mongol invasion of 1241.\n\nIn 1536, the Pressburg castle became the seat of the Kingdom of Hungary after present-day Hungary was conquered by the Turks. Between 1552 and 1784 the holy crown of Hungary was hosted in this castle.\n\nStarting in the 18th century, the castle gradually lost its importance. In 1811 a huge accidental fire destroyed it. For much of the 19th century, the castle continued to deteriorate and parts of it were sold as construction material. There were many plans to turn the place into government buildings but after World War II it was restored to its last known state. Restoration work started in 1957 and it was partially re-opened in 1968, but different types of works around the castle were continuously made.\n\nVisit Bratislava Castle\n\nBratislava castle sits atop a hill and it is easy to spot from almost any point of the Slovakian capital. It is easily reachable on foot from the historical center and the area is well-signaled.\n\nBratislava Castle Map"
