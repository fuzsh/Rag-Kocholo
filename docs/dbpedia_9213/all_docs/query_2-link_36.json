        "text": "By waytoadventure\n\nIn Europe, Resources\n\nOver the course of history inspiring nicknames have been attributed to manyof Europe’s great cities. The City of Love, The White City, The City of Light, The Eternal City, the Pearl of the Adriatic, The City of Spires, and many more. Which are your favouries?\n\nFor a shortened version, skip to the bottom of this article.\n\nThe Granite City\n\nAberdeen, Scotland\n\nGrey granite has been quarried and used as the principal construction material in Aberdeen for over 300 years. Almost all public buildings in Aberdeen are constructed from granite, including The Marischal College which is the second largest granite building in the world.\n\nIn addition to Aberdeen’s landmark buildings, the city uses granite for everything from paving, curb, and building stones, to prominent public monuments, including a public fountain made of fourteen different granites.\n\nVenice of the North\n\nAmsterdam, Netherlands\n\nAmsterdam, the capital of the Netherlands, has more than 100 kilometers canals, most of which were dug during the 1600s. The canals incorporate 90 islands and over 1500 bridges. The city has been compared to Venice for many years, eventually gaining the nickname “Venice of the North”. In 2010, the canals of Amsterdam were listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\n\nCity of the Violet Crown\n\nAthens, Greece\n\nIn classical literature, Athens was sometimes referred to as the “City of the Violet Crown”. This nickname was first recorded by Pindar (518–438 BC), an Ancient Greek poet from Thebes. Pindar gave much praise to Athens, calling it among other epithets: “the Glorious City”, “Bulwark of Hellas”, and “City of Sunlit Splendour”. Athens is located in Attica, a region characterised by its low humidity, which often has a lot of dust in the air. This makes for spectacular sunsets with hues of purple and violet, with the sun sometimes setting into a purple haze.\n\nCity of Counts\n\nBarcelona, Spain\n\nThe County of Barcelona was created by Charlemagne in 801, after having conquered the region and partitioned it into various counties. The successive Counts of Barcelona extended their influence through marriage, alliances and treaties, eventually acquiring the other Catalan counties.\n\nIn 1137, the County of Barcelona formed a dynastic union with the Kingdom of Aragon, known as the Crown of Aragon, with the marriage of Queen Petronilla of Aragon and Count Raymond Berenguer IV of Barcelona. Ramon Berenguer IV died in 1162, and Petronilla abdicated in 1164, allowing their son Alfonso II to become the first King of Aragon and Count of Barcelona. The title of Count of Barcelona eventually merged with the Spanish crown.\n\nThe Grey City\n\nBerlin, Germany\n\nBerlin is both the capital and largest city of Germany. The earliest settlements in the area date from the 1100s, with 1237 considered the founding date of the city. Berlin quickly became one of the most prominent cities in Germany, and in 1701 became the capital of Prussia and later the German Empire. During World War II, 50% of the city was destroyed and following the war Germany and Berlin alike were split into four zones of occupation. The Berlin Wall fell in 1989, with the reunification of Germany occurring the following year. Today Berlin is considered one of the cultural capitals of Europe.\n\nThe nickname, the gray city, while ambiguous – is believed to allude to the severely damaged city and its subsequent reconstruction, at the loss of its former architectural heritage.\n\n“When I came to the city that I hadn’t seen for years, I stopped. The huge city had fallen to its knees like a gray giant, the roofs were on the ground floor. A forest of ruins surrounded the wanderer. […] The city was silent. “ – Günter Weisenborn, 1945\n\nCity of a Thousand Trades\n\nBirmingham, England\n\nThe Industrial Revolution began in the 1760s and Birmingham quickly became the most prominent industrial city in England. In 1791, Birmingham was hailed as the “first manufacturing town in the world”. The city produced exceptional advances in science, technology, and economic development, with numerous innovations that laid the foundations of modern industry. Birmingham had thousands of small workshops, drawing the most highly skilled trades people from all over the country. Today, Birmingham is the second largest city in the United Kingdom.\n\nThe Fat One, The Red One\n\nBologna, Italy\n\nBologna is the capital and largest city of the Emilia-Romagna region in Northern Italy. The city and region alike, is renowned for its cuisine. The most famous specialities that originate from this area are Bolognese sauce, prosciutto, mortadella, and Parmigiano-Reggiano. This has earned Bologna the nickname of “la grassa” (the fat).\n\nAnother nickname attributed to the city is “la rossa” (the red). This is a reference to the colour of the bricks of the buildings in the historic city centre. The name later became assosiated with the communist ideology which was supported by the majority of the population following World War II.\n\nCity of Wine\n\nBordeaux, France\n\nWine was introduced to the Bordeaux region by the Romans around 100AD and has remained in continuous production since. The Bordeaux region has a ideal climate for growing grape vines and over the centuries became world-renowned for its wine. Today Bordeaux has over 6700 wine producers.\n\nBeauty on the Danube, Little Big City\n\nBratislava, Slovakia\n\nBratislava is a capital of Slovakia, located on Danube river at a tripoint with Austria and Hungary.\n\nEarly settlements existed in the area around Bratislava since the iron age, with Celts having had established a fortified town on the site by 150BC. Between 100-400AD, the Danube River acted as a border between the Roman Empire, on the southern side, and the Barbaricum (German tribes), on the northern side. Slavs began arriving to the area between the 400-500s. By the 900s, the town became known as Pressburg (German and English) / Pozsony (Hungarian) / Prešporok (Slovak).\n\nPressburg was absorbed into the Kingdom of Hungary in the 1000s, and developed into an important economic and administrative centre on the kingdom’s frontier. Its strategic position made it the site of frequent attacks and battles, but also brought it economic development and high political status. Pressburg was granted town privileges in 1291 and declared a free royal town in 1405. The Kingdom of Hungary was defeated by the Ottoman Empire in the Battle of Mohács in 1526 and the kingdom was subsequent partitioned and Hungary became a part of the Habsburg Monarchy. The Ottomans soon besieged Pressburg and Vienna too, but failed to conquer them. In 1536, as a consequence of Ottoman advances, the Hungarian capital was transfered to Pressburg from Buda (which was captured in 1541). In 1848, as a result of the decline of the Ottoman Empire and its influence on the region, Pest replaced Pressburg as the capital of Hungary (the cities of Buda, Pest, and Óbuda would unite into Budapest in 1873). The Habsburg Monarchy united in 1867 and became the Austro-Hungarian Empire. In 1918, following World War I, the Austro-Hungarian Empire collapsed.\n\nIn October 1918, the new state of Czechoslovakia was declared, and in 1919 Pressburg was officially renamed Bratislava. In 1938, Czechoslovakia was occupied by Nazi Germany, and in 1945 by the Soviet Union. In 1948, Czechoslovakia came under Communist rule and became a satellite state of the Soviet Union.\n\nIn November 1989, the Velvet Revolution began with demonstrations against communist rule. By the end of November, without any violence, the Communist party relinquish power. In December 1989, a non-communist government was appointed and in June 1990 Czechoslovakia held its first democratic elections since 1946. In 1993, Czechoslovakia peacefully split into two countries – Czech Republic and Slovakia – in what became known as the Velvet Divorce. Bratislava became capital of the newly independent Slovakia.\n\nToday, Bratislava is a city of approximately 500,000 and receives over a million tourists a year.\n\nCapital of Europe\n\nBrussels,
