        "text": "Why go to Bratislava?\n\nIs it even worth it?\n\nThe bare and run down vibe of the city often fails to impress people visiting Bratislava, after glamorous Prague or Vienna. Just a stone away from the later, Bratislava offers a very different picture of European history and struggles. I loved my day in Bratislava and highly recommend a day trip from Vienna to Bratislava. This post will take you through a concise history of Bratislava, why it is different, why should you go there, how to reach there, and things you must see in Bratislava in one day.\n\nIs Bratislava worth visiting?\n\nBratislava is not your classical European city. It offers a view into its not so glorious past. Past that is not limited to its grand cathedrals and pretty medieval streets but something more real, darker. Czechoslovakia was part of the Eastern Bloc behind the Iron Curtain and here you can sneak peek into the life under- and post-communist times. While the country is flourishing now, the remnants of their past are deeply embedded in the streets, buildings, and the vibe of the city. Even the slogan of their tourism board is ‘The city where you find real-life’.\n\nThis article contains some affiliate links. If you buy something using those links, I get a small commission, without any additional cost to you.\n\nFun fact: Bratislava has been the capital of two different countries and cultures. Apart from being the capital of Slovakia right now, Bratislava was also the capital of the Habsburg empire for nearly 300 years.\n\nIs one day enough in Bratislava?\n\nYes and No! Can one day ever be enough to experience the essence of a place? To live like locals? One week? One month? One year? There is no answer to this question.\n\nBut for people like us, who have a full-time job and have limited time to travel, we don’t have many options. Be it Milan or Munich, we can’t afford week-long holidays, given the time restrictions. We need to find the balance and try to get the most out of the opportunity.\n\nThat is why I prepared this Bratislava itinerary: to maximize the experience, even in limited time.\n\nIf you want to see the true essence of Bratislava in one day, I highly recommend the post-communism tour from Authentic Slovakia. The guides are amazing and took me through the dark history of Bratislava. I didn’t know much about Slovakia or Bratislava before this tour. They took us around in their Skoda and showed us the historical and cultural aspects of Bratislava. I would not have understood why Bratislava is so different without them. A big shout out to them!\n\nIdentity crisis\n\nNestled between the tourist magnets Vienna, Prague, and Budapest, Bratislava hasn’t been able to attract the same number of visitors. In fact, it has struggled with identity issues itself.\n\nIt has been renamed multiple times: from Wratislaburgum, Brezezburg, Bresburg, Bosonium, Poson, Istropolis, Posonium Pressburg, Pozsony, Pressburg, Wilson city to Bratislava.\n\nFun fact: Pick the odd one out? Yes, Wilson city feels a bit out of the place, doesn’t it? In 1918, Bratislava was almost called Wilson city. American President Woodrow Wilson supported their independent state of Czechoslovakia and to show their gratitude, they renamed Bratislava to Wilson city. The name didn’t stick and in 1919, it was called Bratislava where brat means brother, and slava means glory.\n\nI love fun facts about countries. Have you read the coolest fun facts about Iceland? From Viking claps to Icelandic horses to their cool Instagram account from the Icelandic Police! And of course, the incest-stopping app!\n\nThis makes it embarrassing that another US president, George W Bush could not distinguish between Slovakia and Slovenia. He told a Slovak journalist about his meeting with his country’s prime minister when we actually met Slovenia’s prime minister.\n\nIn a summit named after the capital, Bratislava Summit 2005, CNN and US Today failed to even mark Bratislava correctly on the map. Yes, the summit was called Bratislava Summit and the reporting new channel still didn’t know where it is.\n\nThe On and off relationship with the Czech Republic didn’t help either.\n\nFun fact: You know a united front for two countries is doomed when they can’t agree on what to call this front. The official name of Czechoslovakia during the last years of communist rule was the ‘Czechoslovak Socialist Republic’. After the Velvet Revolution, the President announced that the word ‘Socialist’ would be dropped from the country’s official name, and the ‘Czechoslovak Republic’ was suggested. However, Slovak politicians didn’t agree and felt this disregards Slovakia’s equal stature, and demanded that the country’s name be spelled with a hyphen, ‘Czecho-Slovak Republic’. Czech politicians did not like this. This wasn’t the biggest reason why countries split, but it clearly showed the struggle of power between the two.\n\nBratislava and history\n\nBratislava’s history is more turbulent and traumatized than that of most other countries in the region. But it did have its moments.\n\nWhen Ottoman forces started overpowering Hungary in 1536, The capital of the Habsburg empire was moved from Buda to Bratislava. This was the golden era for Bratislava, which was called Pressburg at that time. It became a coronation town and the seat of the royals, the nobles, and all major organizations and offices.\n\nBratislava further flourished during the 18th-century reign of Queen Maria Theresa and became the largest and most important town in then Hungary. New palaces, monasteries, and streets were built, and the city was the center of the social and cultural life of the region. All the prominent artists like Mozart, Joseph Haydn, and Beethoven used to perform there.\n\nBut this did not last for long.\n\nThe city started to lose its importance under the reign of Maria Theresa’s son Joseph II. Crown jewels were taken to Vienna to strengthen the relations between Austria and Hungary. Many central offices and nobility subsequently moved to Buda.\n\nBratislava was declared the capital of the first independent Slovak Republic on March 14, 1939. Peace didn’t last for long as the new state quickly fell under Nazi influence and the new Slovak government deported most of Bratislava’s approximately 15,000 Jews.\n\nBratislava was bombarded by the Allies, occupied by German troops in 1944, and eventually taken by the Soviet troops in April 1945. After the Communist Party seized power in Czechoslovakia in February 1948, the city became part of the Eastern Bloc. The city expanded, and the population grew significantly, becoming 90% Slovak. Large residential areas consisting of high-rise prefabricated panel buildings, such as those in the Petržalka borough, were built to fulfill the increasing demands.\n\nIn 1993, the city became the capital of the newly formed Slovak Republic following the Velvet Divorce. The same year, the federal republic of Czechoslovakia separated into the Czech Republic and Slovakia. It is also known as the Velvet Divorce.\n\nIf you admire cities with history, where every corner and turn shows you the historical significance of the city, you will love Thessaloniki, the underrated gem in Greece!\n\nThings to see in Bratislava in one day\n\nTo have the best experience from the city, follow the following ‘Bratislava itinerary’\n\nFreedom Square\n\nIt is the big square in the city surrounded by the main government offices and university buildings. In the center of the square, you will find a stainless steel fountain in the shape of the linden tree flower, which is also the national flower. The fountain doesn’t work and is due for renovation for a while now. There used to be a statue of Gottwald, the first communist President of Czechoslovakia. The statue was destroyed after the velvet revolution in 1989.\n\nSocialist architecture remnants\n\nAfter World War II, many people didn’t have a place to live. More people were called in from villages for meeting the requirements of the heavy industrialization of the city. This forced urbanization needed people to be accommodated easily and quickly. And hence the socialist prefabricated blocks came into the picture. These blocks were made in factories and the units are transported and assembled on-site to form the complete building. Sounds insane, right? Since these buildings were created to provide the basic necessities of running water and electricity, no importance was given to the style and design of the buildings. They were gray and dull, very stereotypical of the communist architecture.\n\nThe first prefab building in Slovakia is in Bratislava, not very far from the Freedom square, which was created in just three months. It houses 36 apartments in one building and is still in use. It is now protected under UNESCO heritage, which means the facade will remain the same to protect the outside panel.\n\nSoviet memorial Slavín\n\nA Soviet war memorial crowns the Slavin hill and is dedicated to the 6845 red army soldiers who lost their lives in the battle for Slovakia. They are buried here in six mass graves and 317 individual graves. A 37m tall column has a 7m soldier raising a flag and crushing a swastika. The hill also gives a nice view of the city and the first impressions of Petržalka, the real-life Legoland.\n\nPetržalka\n\nThis concrete jungle is full of prefabricated buildings. It the most densely populated area in central Europe with about one-third of Bratislava living there. These socialist buildings were dull and greyish for a long time until recently when the locals accepted and transformed them. This housing project is now upgraded, stylish, and brightly colored. In fact so brightly colored, that locals call them the lego houses.\n\nRadio building\n\nThe inverted pyramid is another well-known architecture from communist-era. To say that this building is unique, would be an understatement. It was listed on the Daily Telegraph’s list of the 30 ugliest buildings in the world.\n\nInside the controversial exteriors lies the best concert and recording studios in Slovakia. You can find one of the largest organs in Central Europe featuring 6,300 pipes here. The hall has excellent acoustics for recording and is mounted on springs that are used as an acoustic damper to prevent vibration and echo. While tourists and locals agree on how weird this building is, as long as it serves its purpose, I don’t mind.\n\nBratislava Castle and Castle District\n\nWhile most of the people consider the castle a must-do when in Bratislava, I did not feel like going to the Bratislava castle in my limited time. From outside, it is famous for looking like an inverted bedframe. Though, what I did find interesting in this area were the intriguing stories our guide told us about former communist leaders and other posh residences in this area. I would recommend this as part of the post-communism tour, otherwise, feel free to skip it. There is a sightseeing bus tour available that includes a visit to the castle if you are interested.\n\nFormer Iron Curtain area\n\nBratislava is at the border of Slovakia and Austria. While Austria was in the western Bloc of the iron curtain, Slovakia was in the Eastern Bloc. This means the iron curtain was running very close to Bratislava itself. Certain sections have been reconstructed for tourism purposes. It is deeply unsettling to think of how it was impossible for people to cross those borders, on which we were just casually strolling. This wasn’t centuries ago, this was in our lifetime! The iron curtains were demolished the same year I was born. There are many people living in the middle of Bratislava who lived through it.\n\nUFO and MOST SNP\n\nThis UFO-like structure is one of the biggest highlights in Bratislava. This controversial bridge created news for more than its unique architecture. Creating this bridge required destructing more than 200 hundred buildings and demolishing about two-thirds of Bratislava’s old town and the Jewish quarters. You can go up to the UFO observation deck for good views of the city.\n\nMichael’s gate and Old town\n\nA bit further away from the stark architecture, Michael’s gate is as close it gets to the traditional European old town. It is one of the oldest buildings in Bratislava and the only gate out of four that survived since medieval times. You can go up the tower to have a nice view of the old town. Right under the gate, there is a golden circle, known as Kilometer Zero, and it marks the distances from Bratislava to 29 other capitals.\n\nQuirky statues\n\nAnother unique thing you will find in Bratislava is a bunch of quirky statues and fountains. The most popular is the one where Cumil has been looking up skirts from his manhole cover since 1997. One of the city’s most Instagrammed places!\n\nBlue Church\n\nThe Church of St. Elizabeth is more commonly known as the Blue Church, well because it is blue. It is unlike any other church I have ever see. Everything from the façade, mosaics, majolicas, and the roof is blue. When we visited it, we didn’t find it open. So we had to just do with the picture from outside.\n\nRecommendations\n\nI highly recommend taking the post-communist tour from Authentic Slovakia. The classic tour is 2 hours long but there are several variations available. The tour will cover most of the Bratislava attractions I listed above. I would have not have liked Bratislava if not for these guys. They are really good at their job and take you through the ups and downs of Bratislava.\n\nTo make the experience more enriched, they take you in an old classic Skoda from the 1970s. I took this tour in 2016 and I still remember all the crazy facts and stories from our passionate tour guide. If there is one thing you do in Bratislava, take this tour!\n\nCheck out this video from their Facebook page, that they created during the Corona lockdown. Very informative and it will give you a feel of what the tour is about!\n\nHow to reach Bratislava\n\nBratislava sits right at the strategic meeting point of three countries: Austria, Slovakia, and Hungary. In fact, it is one of the only capitals in the world that is so close to the neighboring countries. It is just 16km to Hungary border and a short walk from the city center to Austria.\n\nGiven this location, it played a deeply vital role in the mighty Habsburg empire in the past. Now this location makes it perfect for a day trip from Vienna. Alternatively, you can have a stopover here when traveling from Prague to Budapest, as we did.\n\nThe airport is 9 km northeast of the city but is not a big airport. Given the limited flight schedules, most people fly to Vienna and then take a one-hour bus transfer to Bratislava.\n\nVienna to Bratislava\n\nThe Austrian capital is just an hour away from Bratislava, making it an ideal day trip. It takes about an hour to reach by train or bus. Book tickets here! You can even take a ferry that takes 1 hour and 30 minutes. You can even take a cruise over the Danube.\n\nPrague to Bratislava\n\nIt takes about 4 hours by train to reach from Prague to Bratislava. The bus could be a bit cheaper but takes about 5 hours.

For your convenience, I have researched some of the best-reviewed hotels in Bratislava:\n\nThis lovely hotel has a perfect location in the old town. Most of the rooms overlook the Danube or the old town. It has a heated indoor pool, a Finnish sauna, a steam bath and a Gault Millau credited french restaurant on site! How cool is that!\n\nThis apartment hotel is quite spacious and comfortable. It has a great location. Even though it is an apartment, breakfast is offered, at a place five minutes away.\n\nThis luxurioushotel has grand rooms, spa, and hot tub. It offers a great breakfast and is close to everything in the old town,\n\nEven though I was only there for a day, Bratislava had a lot to offer in such a short time. I will highly recommend you to visit Bratislava but with an open perspective. Every street in Bratislava is a real-life museum, showcasing its scars from the battle. Think about the history of the city, what it has gone through, and what it represents. Not many places in the world allow a peek into their dark past. Bratislava does and it should not be punished for the same.\n\nPin it for later!"
