        "text": "By Gemma Tedaldi | Published: 7th June 2020 | Updated: 4th January 2024\n\nFull of quaint old towns, local food and sightseeing galore, day trips from Bratislava are something else. During our European road trip, we ended up visiting three cities in three days thanks to taking day trips from Bratislava, to these wonderful locations:\n\nüìç Sopron in Hungary\n\nüìç Vienna in Austria\n\nüìç Podersdorf am See in Austria\n\nIt might seem like a lot, but they are actually all within an hour‚Äôs drive of each other and if you don‚Äôt mind hiring a car and crossing a few borders then it is well worth it. Driving in this part of Europe is another reason that these day trips are the perfect way to explore. We drove through valleys full of wind turbines and landscapes of sunflower fields as far as the eye could see all before getting to our city destinations.\n\nSo, if this sounds like something for you then here is how to spend three days in three cities on a series of day trips from Bratislava. (You could make any of these destinations your base but day trips from Bratislava are perfect due to how easy it is to get from location to location via road or rail). Bratislava should be on your radar!\n\nPlanning Your Trip? Use our favourite travel resources below:\n\nAccommodation: We recommend Booking.com\n\nRental Car: We recommend Rentalcars.com\n\nFlights: We recommend Kiwi.com\n\nTours: We recommend Get Your Guide\n\nBratislava, Slovakia\n\nThis capital city may be one of the smaller capitals in Europe but is well worth a visit if you are nearby, as it is only an hour from both Sopron & Vienna. With a magnificent castle sat atop a hill overlooking the entire city, a quaint old town filled with colourful buildings and statues and a UFO bridge of all things! Wandering around the city was something we could have spent days doing but even just a short day stop made us fall for this city.\n\nGetting to Bratislava\n\nBratislava is really easy to get to via air, car or train. By air you want to fly into Bratislava airport, a 20-minute car ride to Bratislava city centre, or 45 minutes by public transport. The main train station in Bratislava is Bratislava Hlavna.\n\nBy car, the E65 and E58 skirt around the city centre, and the 9, 2 and A6 come from Austria and Hungary. If arriving by car, beware of parking close to the river as most of these are run by hotels and will charge you a lot more than you are expecting!\n\nGetting around Bratislava\n\nBratislava is only a very small city so you can easily get around it on foot. There is a short uphill walk to the castle and its gardens, but other than that it is all relatively flat apart from the bumpy cobbles!\n\nSights to see in Bratislava\n\nWander around the restored Bratislava Castle and gardens. There is also a wonderful little restaurant hidden within the grounds of the castle which is the perfect place to stop for a bite to eat with views out over the city below.\n\nThe 18th century Old Town is not only pedestrian-only but full to the brim with cafes and bars. It is also home to Michael‚Äôs City Gate and the famous statues of Bratislava. See if you can find them all! Whilst in the Old Town don‚Äôt miss out on walking along Hviezdoslav Square, with its beautiful water features, sculptures and immense history.\n\nMost SNP, also known as the UFO Bridge, is one of the most unusual sights to see in the somewhat historic-looking city! Crossing over the River Danube and one of the most visited tourist destinations in the country, head up there if you want 360 views of the surroundings.\n\nFood and drink to try in Bratislava\n\nYou can‚Äôt visit Bratislava and not try the national dish of Slovakia, Bryndzov√© Halu≈°ky. This mix of mini dumplings with goats‚Äô cheese and bacon is delicious! Especially paired with a bowl of the local goulash. Wash this all down with some of the many craft beers they have in the city and some fresh iced tea.\n\nPlanning your own day trips from Bratislava? Make sure you check out our Travelling Tedaldi Amazon Store Travel Guides for all your guidebooks and maps. (We‚Äôve done the hard work for you and linked all the things we used to plan our trip!)\n\nDay trips from Bratislava to Hungary ‚Äì Sopron\n\nSopron is a small city in Hungary located on the Austrian border. This cute little city on the very western edge of Hungary has a Fire Tower with stunning views over the old town, (is it just us or do all European cities have an ‚ÄòOld Town‚Äô?), and a lovely oval-shaped historical centre. We needed to spend more time here but parking being limited we didn‚Äôt have very long!\n\nGetting to Sopron\n\nFrom Bratislava, the easiest way to get to Sopron is by road which takes 1.5 hours via the A6 through some beautiful Austrian roads. By train it takes on average 2.5 hours and also goes through Austria via Vienna. If you want to start in Sopron and fly in from elsewhere then the nearest airport is actually Vienna Airport 48km away.\n\nParking is extremely limited in the city centre, we ended up down a random residential street and paying by parking meter rather than in a car park, which can be very expensive if you don‚Äôt speak the language‚Ä¶ We know from experience!\n\nGetting around Sopron\n\nAgain, as with most European cities, the easiest way to get around is on foot. This city is also really small so you can easily walk around the main loop of it in an hour.\n\nSights to see in Sopron\n\nThe main attraction in the city by far is the medieval Fire Tower to the north of the historical centre, with its 200 steps to the top balcony and wonderful views out over the city. Wander the side streets including V√°rfals√©t√°ny taking in the colourful buildings and overall, much quieter vibe than most European cities. Be sure to stop at the F≈ë t√©r Square and the Soproni Nagyboldogasszony templom, also called Goat Church too‚Ä¶ Yes, you read that correctly!\n\nFood and drink to try in Sopron\n\nAnything with paprika. The Hungarians love a bit of paprika as it can grow wild in and around the city, and it shows in the food! We opted for the local Chicken Paprikash with a glass of Soproni to go with it.\n\nDay trips from Bratislava to Austria ‚Äì Vienna\n\nThis beautiful city, the largest in Austria, has long been on our list of places to visit with its baroque architecture, famous coffee houses and of course, its incredible cathedral! With many famous names that have shaped the city to what it is today, (think Mozart, Beethoven and Freud), it really is somewhere that you can‚Äôt help but love.\n\nGetting to Vienna\n\nBy road from Bratislava, it takes 1 hour via the A6 and A4. By train from Bratislava, it also takes roughly 1 hour. Or if you want to make your base in Vienna, you can fly into Vienna Airport. We didn‚Äôt park in the city centre as we found it much easier to park in the surrounding area and take the tram in.\n\nGetting around Vienna\n\nVienna is the largest of the cities on this day trips from Bratislava list and as such you might want to utilise the public transport system to get around. We mixed it up between walking and hopping on the tram so you can see more of the city. You can get tickets from Weiner Linien either online or at ticket offices / machines near the transport stops for 24, 48 and 72 hours for 8 euros, 14.10 euros and 17.10 euros each. Just make sure you stamp your ticket before boarding the tram, bus or underground railway!\n\nSights to see in Vienna\n\nSt Stephens Cathedral is by far the most well-known landmark in Vienna. You can climb to the top and experience the expansive 360 views over the city alongside the wonderful colourful tiled roof. If you think it looks tall from the ground, you should try getting up there!\n\nVienna is also rather well known for its imperial places such as The Hofburg and Sch√∂nbrunn. These grand stately residences are not only highly-ranking tourist attractions but beautiful examples of Austrian Baroque architecture. If you are a fan of the artist Hundertwasser, then you must visit the Kunsthaus & Hundertwasserhaus buildings and the area in between.\n\nThere is also an artist walk joining them including works from Klimt as well as local artists. This area of the city has a much different vibe from the heart of Vienna, but it is well worth a visit.\n\nFood and drink to try in Vienna\n\nIf you have a sweet tooth or a love of strudel or coffee, then you have to stop by Caf√© Central Coffee House for traditional Viennese coffee and a slice of apple strudel. Not only is the food delicious but the building itself is stunning too. If savoury is more your thing, then be sure to try some of the local sausages served with sauerkraut, wiener schnitzel and a good old Austrian beer!\n\nDay trips from Bratislava to Austria ‚Äì Podersdorf am See\n\nLake Neusiedl is also a beautiful stop, even though it‚Äôs not a city. We actually stayed camping on the shores of Lake Neusidel in Neusiedler See National Park for a night as it was that lovely, plus it was much cheaper than staying in one of the cities nearby. Both in Hungary and Austria, it‚Äôs a great place to relax after a day‚Äôs exploring.\n\nGetting to Podersdorf am See\n\nFrom Bratislava, it is on average 2.5 hours via public transport or only 45 minutes by road via the A6. The drive to the lake is one of the most beautiful routes, through small villages, past vineyard after vineyard and out along the largest lake in Austria.\n\nGetting around Podersdorf am See\n\nThe shore around Lake Neusiedl is brimming with walking routes, cycling trails and places to hire little boats, plus quite a few friendly local birds too! As the largest lake in Central Europe that doesn‚Äôt flow into the sea, you will easily be able to spend a day just exploring the area from the shore.\n\nSights to see in Podersdorf am See\n\nAdmittedly there isn‚Äôt a massive amount of sightseeing to do around Lake Neusiedl and Podersdorf am See, but there are a few things you can‚Äôt miss, one of which being the Podersdorf Lighthouse. This 12m tall lighthouse, is most definitely one of the most beautiful land-locked lighthouses there is! Overlooking the lake, it can be seen from every direction due to the flat surrounding land, so is quite a draw for both users of the water as well as those on land.\n\nTalking of the land, the area around the lake is also a UNESCO World Heritage Site with two national parks, Neusiedler See-Seewinkel and Fert≈ë-Hans√°g, meaning that this area is also one stunning place to explore.\n\nDue to its shallow depth, (roughly 1.5m), the lake is also a great place to go kitesurfing and windsurfing and has become one of the most popular places for lots of Austrians and Hungarians alike to take to the water. From April through to the end of summer competitions take place so either get in the water yourself or watch all the action unfold from the shore!\n\nDay trips from Bratislava FAQs\n\nWhere is Bratislava?\n\nBratislava is located on the western edge of Slovakia, a landlocked country, (from the Czech Republic, Poland, Ukraine, Hungary and Austria!), in Central Europe. Bratislava is somewhat of a hidden gem in Europe. Many people travel through the area going to the big cities of Vienna or Budapest and often miss out on this quaint place.\n\nIs Bratislava worth visiting?\n\nAs the capital of Slovakia, set along the River Danube, with a beautiful historic 18th-century core, surrounded by mountains, hiking trails and vineyards, yes Bratislava is most definitely worth visiting. Plus, there is a reconstructed castle that overlooks the old city centre, as well as a UFO, come lookout tower perched on top of one of the main bridges into the city. What more could you want?\n\nIs a day trip from Bratislava to Vienna worth it?\n\n100% yes! Bratislava is in a great location for taking day trips, being close to the border with Hungary and Austria. It is also not far from the border with the Czech Republic so another great place to visit. Getting to Vienna, in particular, couldn‚Äôt be easier by car or public transport, (it‚Äôs roughly one hour away), so it is one of the best options for a day trip from Bratislava.\n\nConclusion: Day trips from Bratislava\n\nSo, here is our suggestions for day trips from Bratislava. Is there anything better than basing yourself in one location and exploring the surrounding area for days on end?\n\nFancy some more European day trips or city breaks? Why not head to Paris or Prague for a weekend? We spent a wonderful time in both during the spring and although it was colder than if we had visited in the summer, the cities were still just as stunning to explore and with fewer tourists!\n\nGemma Tedaldi\n\nGemma is the owner and author of The Travelling Tedaldi, a travel blog helping travellers to discover the best road trips and travel itineraries throughout the UK and Europe.
