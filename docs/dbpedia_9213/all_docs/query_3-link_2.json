        "text": "Hungary traces its history back to the Magyars, an alliance of semi-nomadic tribes from southern Russia and the Black Sea coast that arrived in the region in the ninth Century.\n\nAfter centuries as a powerful medieval kingdom, Hungary was part of the Ottoman and then Habsburg empires from the 16th Century onwards, emerging as an independent country again after World War One.\n\nAfter decades under Communist rule, Hungary's status as a liberal democracy and member of the European Union has been questioned by the increasingly authoritarian actions of populist right-wing Prime Minister Viktor Orban.\n\nA landlocked country, Hungary is home to Lake Balaton, the largest in central Europe, and to a large number of spa towns and hot springs.\n\nThe former head of the constitutional court, TamÃ¡s Sulyok, was elected as president in February 2024, following the resignation of Katalin NovÃ¡k after she pardoned a man convicted of helping to cover up sexual abuse in a children's home.\n\nNovÃ¡k, a close ally of conservative Prime Minister Viktor Orban, resigned a week after news of her presidential pardon was reported by local media. Protests calling for her to step down had been growing in Hungary.\n\nJudit Varga, the former minister of justice who approved the pardon, also resigned from her new role leading the June 2024 European elections campaign for Prime Minister Viktor Orban's ruling Fidesz party.\n\nIn 2022, NovÃ¡k became the first woman to hold the largely ceremonial role of Hungarian president.\n\nThe double resignation of its two most prominent female politicians was seen as a serious setback for Mr Orban and his party.\n\nPrime minister: Viktor Orban\n\nViktor Orban has concentrated an unprecedented amount of power in his hands while alarming other EU leaders with his brand of nationalist populism.\n\nHe has described his goal for Hungary as creating an \"illiberal state\", and argues that authoritarian systems like those in China, Turkey and Russia are a more appropriate model than Western liberal democracies.\n\nOrban has been in power continuously since 2010. he has transformed Hungary into what the European Parliament has denounced as a \"hybrid regime of electoral autocracy\". He appears uncertain how to describe his own invention, trying both \"illiberal democracy\" and \"Christian liberty\".\n\nHe has repeatedly clashed with European Union colleagues on migration and the war in Ukraine.\n\nSome key dates in Hungary's modern history:\n\n1867 - Hungary becomes equal partner in Austro-Hungarian Empire.\n\n1918 - Austro-Hungarian Empire is broken up at the end of World War One.\n\n1920 - Under the Treaty of Trianon, Entente powers award more than two-thirds of Hungarian territory to Czechoslovakia, Romania and Yugoslavia, leaving a third of Hungarian speakers living outside the country.\n\n1920s-1930s - Admiral Horthy's rule is characterised by bitter resentment at loss of Hungarian territories, becomes progressively more reactionary and more closely allied with Nazi Germany.\n\n1941-1945 - Hungary fights on the side of Nazi Germany in World War Two, losing a large part of its army in Russia. The Germans occupy Hungary in in 1944 after Hungary seeks an armistice. Hundreds of thousands of Jews and gypsies are deported to death camps."
