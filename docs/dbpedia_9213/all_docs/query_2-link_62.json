        "meta_description": "Budapest - Magyars, Jews, Germans: The capital is almost 10 times larger than Hungary’s next largest city. The rise of population has been phenomenal: its rate of increase from about 100,000 in the 1840s to 1,000,000 in 1918, for example, far outstripped that of London during the same period. Natural population growth has never been a factor in this expansion. Rather, more die in the city than are born there, the result of a never-ending migration of people from villages and towns to the capital. By the late 20th century, however, the rate of growth had slowed, and the population had begun to shift from",

        "text": "Commerce and industry\n\nIn the past, all roads converged on Buda, and its market was always famous. By the 19th century, however, commerce had shifted to Pest; its wealthy merchants dominated Hungary’s agricultural market, and its banks (by 1900 more than 100) controlled 60 percent of the country’s bank capital. Commerce is still concentrated in Pest’s Belváros, including the major banks, most of the foreign trading companies, the state travel agency (Idegenforgalmi, Beszerzési, Utazási és Szállítási R.T., or IBUSZ), and the best shops. To help mitigate the growing imbalance in consumer services, large shopping centres were built in Óbuda, Lágymányos, Újpest, Zugló, and elsewhere. The national economic reforms introduced since 1968 created a private sector in retailing and in service industries. Both the public and the private sectors have benefited from the increasingly important tourist industry.\n\nIn the last quarter of the 19th century, the city—which possessed neither local raw materials of any sort nor even skilled workers (they had to be imported from Austria and Moravia)—was transformed from a commercial base to the country’s most prominent industrial centre. Except for a few engineering factories, manufacturing was at first limited to the processing of raw materials, particularly food, and huge grain mills were built on the Danube. Primary-metal and engineering works (especially for agricultural machinery and ships) and munitions and electronics factories soon followed. Automobiles have been produced since 1905, but light industries grew fast only after World War I. Possessing the bulk of the country’s industrial production and by 1938 about three-fifths of its factory workers, Budapest strangled the economic growth of all of Hungary’s other towns. The city’s location on the Danube and especially the construction of the rigidly centralized Hungarian railways, which had preceded the growth of industry, were instrumental in this dominance. The influx of foreign capital, channeled through the large banks and through the government, and the control of large factories by leading Budapest banks reinforced the centralizing role played by the transport system. The loss of two-thirds of Hungary’s territory in 1918 and the directives of a centrally planned economy that existed from 1945 until the late 1980s exacerbated the hypertrophy of Budapest in relation to the rest of the country, although by 1969 the capital’s share of the country’s industrial workforce had been reduced to about one-half. More than half the factory workers in Budapest are employed in heavy industry; the rest are divided between light industry and food processing.\n\nBy the second decade of the 21st century, Budapest had transformed into one of the world’s fastest-developing urban economies. It had become an important centre of finance, banking, and commerce, as well as the focus of significant foreign direct investment. It was also an important hub of research and development. Not surprisingly, the majority of the country’s large software companies call Budapest home.\n\nTransportation\n\nTransportation has been the key to Budapest’s rapid expansion. A famous crossing point on the Danube where highways have always converged, it has become the hub of the country’s trunk roads and main railway lines, all of which radiate from the capital. It has also developed Hungary’s largest bus terminal as well as its largest commercial airport, Budapest Ferenc Liszt International Airport. Csepel Free Port, downstream from the city centre on Csepel Island, handles international freight cargo on the Danube and is equipped to handle container traffic. The head office of the international Danube Commission is in Budapest. Of the capital’s eight bridges, the oldest and best-known is the Széchenyi Chain Bridge (Széchenyi Lánchíd), built in the 1840s and named for the 19th-century Hungarian reformer István Széchenyi.\n\nHorse-drawn trams were introduced in 1866, and, after the first electric tramways were built in 1887, they soon expanded into a large network. The trams and buses (the latter introduced in 1915) met local transport needs before the 1940s, but they could not cope with the rapid growth of traffic after World War II. Yet, despite the congestion caused by the colossal expansion in the use of the private automobile and the reduction in the number of tramcars, city transport has once more become efficient. The Metro, a subway system constructed primarily in the 1970s, operates four lines, including one that runs under the river and connects Buda to Pest; it is a showpiece that is clean, fast, and (like the city’s buses and old-fashioned rattling trams) absurdly cheap.\n\nThe hills of Buda, with their pleasant wooded paths, can be reached easily from the town either by an old cog railway, bus, or a chairlift that takes sightseers to the top of János Hill, which, at 1,729 feet (527 metres) above sea level, is the highest point in Budapest. The Children’s Railway (Gyermekvasút), which winds through the hills, is managed largely by children."
