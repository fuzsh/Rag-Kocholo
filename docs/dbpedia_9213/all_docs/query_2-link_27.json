        "text": "We were happily minding our business in Bucharest, Romania, where we were ‘living’ for a month in a studio rented off Airbnb (use our link and get up to $40 off your first stay!). Our time in Bucharest was intentional and multi-purpose, as we were able to get some much needed time to work, spent time outside of Schengen, and we got to experience and explore a new country and city.\n\nDuring our regular activities, we’re always on the lookout for house sits that look interesting, and one day we found one that looked perfect! It was in Vienna, Austria were we’d have the privilege of looking after a home in the center of Josefstadt (basically Old Vienna, city center), and caring for two cats and a small dog. We talked with the homeowners, got all of the details squared away, were selected, and were thrilled to be able to put the house sit on our calendar.\n\nThe best part about our traveling style is that it’s flexible. We keep our time available so we can jump on opportunities that appeal to us. Vienna was certainly a place we wanted to visit, and the animals looked adorable, so we of course had to take advantage of the house sit.\n\nThe next step was figuring out how we'd get from Bucharest to Vienna. We thought, the easy way to get to Vienna was to fly, right? Unfortunately, no. It was on the pricey side to fly directly to Vienna on the date we needed (over $240 per person). So, long story short (read the longer story here), we found that a 90 minute bus ride from Bratislava to Vienna was only €1 per person (yes, you read that right, only €1!).\n\nSo you might be asking, how did we get from Bucharest to Bratislava? Simple, we flew from Cluj-Napoca, Romania to Bratislava, Slovakia for only $20 US dollars for both us! Yes, you read that right, it was 80 RON or $20.01 (the conversion during our visit) including fees and taxes to fly from Cluj-Napoca to Bratislava! And, if you’re up on your Romanian geography, the next logical question is, how did we get from Bucharest to Cluj-Napoca? Well of course, we took a train ride from Sighisoara, where since we were there we had to spend a couple of days sightseeing and enjoying the UNESCO World Heritage Site of one of the best-preserved citadels in Romania. Naturally you now must be asking, so how did we end up in Sighisoara? Well, by taking a fantastic Transylvanian train ride from Sibiu, Romania of course!\n\nIf you’re still following along, you may be wondering how in the world we ended up in Sibiu, over 170 miles north of Bucharest. Well, here’s a question for you.\n\nWe certainly would, and did! So, from Bucharest Airport we rented a car (by the way, it was our first time driving in nearly eight months!) and drove the amazing Transfagarasan Highway, of which we must admit we were both so excited to do that we took turns driving so that we could both have bragging rights. Finally, at the end of the drive we spent a night at an Airbnb in Sibiu, and then caught our Transylvanian train to Sighisoara.\n\nAnd Now, Let’s Recap\n\nThe dominoes fell in place when we were offered a house sit in Vienna, Austria and the plane tickets were more than we wanted to spend to fly direct into Vienna, of course if time was of the essence we would have simply paid the airfare. But instead, we left Bucharest on a once in a lifetime road trip on the Transfagarasan Highway, spent the night in Sibiu, took a train the next morning to Sighisoara (where we lived it up like tourists for a couple of days), and finally we took a train to Cluj-Napoca (where we spent the night), before waking up before dawn to catch a plane to Bratislava. From there, we’d be taking a €1 (about $2.40 US dollars for both of us) bus ride to our house sit in Vienna. It made sense to us, and besides, it was an ‘excuse’ to visit another country…\n\nWhat To Do Now, That We’re in Bratislava?\n\nWell, it seemed only logical, that rather than arrive and immediately leave a cool new city in a country we’d never been in before, we should stay a couple of days! So, we booked a hotel night (with points at the DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Bratislava) and an Airbnb night in town and started exploring!\n\nIf you know us at all though, you’re well aware that we don’t just show up in a new city without a game plan. As we usually do, we did plenty of research ahead of time, exploring maps and recommendations all over the internet to come up with the best ever, must see list of things to do in Bratislava. It’s our goal to see everything, from the most visited tourist places to the hidden gems even locals don’t always know about. So, to possibly make your research on sightseeing in Bratislava (and other destinations) easier, we’ve kept our maps with all of the information we gathered (accurate at the time of our sightseeing). Finding hours, prices, and general information can sometimes be challenging, so we’ve tried to include these details on our maps and provide appropriate links below. And finally, not every attraction is suitable for every visitor, but the copywriters and marketing departments for the destinations sure make it sound like it. How many times have you read “Great for kids and adults alike” and shown up at the venue to wonder why anyone over 20 years-old without kids would go out of their way to be there? Below we’ve included our itinerary with tips, impressions, and our takeaways on each place that, when combined with the official attraction information and website, may help you decide if it’s a destination for your travel adventure or not.\n\nThe map above is inclusive of everything we saw and did in Bratislava. However, we want to highlight some of our favorite attractions. Naturally, we’ve included the most famous attractions, the ones that you’ll find in every ‘must see’ list, but we’ve also included the hidden gems, the off the beaten path places, and the destinations that you don’t come across in every blog and article about Bratislava. Hopefully, you’ll love them as much as we did!\n\nMust See Attractions in Bratislava\n\nMichael's Gate\n\nLike many cities across Europe that date back centuries, Bratislava was once fortressed with city walls and ancient gates. Only the North gate, of the four original gates, remains standing, and today it isn’t just a gate to photograph and walk through, it also houses the Museum of Arms. The church that this gate was named after, which stood outside the town walls and in front of the gate, no longer stands, however it lives on in its name, St. Michael. The gate was built at the beginning of the 14th century, but looks the way it does today because of a Baroque style reconstruction in 1758 that changed the overall shape of the building and added the statue of St. Michael slaying the Dragon to the top. It’s hard to imagine it in the present day, but at its glory, Michael’s Gate, was part of a large, two wall fortification plan that was closed off by a moat and a drawbridge. The tower stands 51 meters (167 feet) tall, has seven floors, and can be climbed by visitors to the sixth floor viewing deck for a fantastic view of the city. To go to the top, you’ll need to enter through the arms museum, which can be found by looking for the replica cannon on the street. When you pass through the bottom of the gate, be sure to look down where you’ll see a large brass ring laid into the cobblestone. It’s called Kilometer Zero, because if you look closely, you’ll see the markings where it shows the distance to 29 other capitals around the world.\n\nSt. Martin's Cathedral, Bratislava\n\nSt. Martin’s Cathedral, consecrated in 1452, is a centerpiece of the city and considered a National Cultural Monument since 2002. It was originally built into the fortification walls and became the coronation church of the Kingdom of Hungary between 1563 and 1830, hosting 19 coronations, the first being that of Maximillian II, as well as Maria Theresa in 1741. It’s one of the most popular tourist destinations and has also been visited by the Pope.\n\nAs you explore Bratislava, you won’t be able to miss the 85 meter (278 feet) tall tower of this church, as it dominates the skyline. The tower you see today was built after the destruction of the original Baroque style tower by a fire in 1833. Commemorating the cathedrals importance as a coronation church, it’s present Neo Gothic form is topped with a gilded cushion bearing a copy of the Hungarian Crown, the Crown of St. Stephen, which weighs over 330 pounds, and between the pillow and the crown contains 18 pounds of gold. It's easy to see why the cathedral is such an integral part of the city, because as we visited other sites within Old Town, the tower of the church always appeared to be ‘just around the corner’.\n\nSo, when it was finally time to go see it, and we rounded the corner and had this beautiful Gothic cathedral in front of us, it was a satisfying walk to the entrance, as our curiosity had been building all morning. Inside we found a beautiful church, designed in the traditional crucifix shape with high, arched ceilings. As the cathedral is dedicated to St. Martin, when visiting, be sure to take a look at the statue of the saint on the altar. Before completing your visit, be sure to find the small entrance and stairs down to the crypt, entrance is €2. It’s most interesting, since the church was originally built over a cemetery and several other churches. Today it’s an archaeological area, as the total number of crypts and size of the catacombs isn’t known. As a visitor, two of the crypts are open to visit.\n\nBratislava Castle\n\nThe Bratislava Castle is in the center of the city, atop a hill and on the banks of the Danube River. It can be seen from all parts of the city and the grounds themselves offer views of the entire city, and on a good, clear day, views of neighboring Austria and Hungary. It’s the number one tourist attraction in the city and for good reason.\n\nThe site where the castle sits is quite a strategic one, being at a passage between the Carpathians and the Alps, as well as at a ford to cross the Danube River. While the castle itself dates back to the 9th century, the land has been inhabited since prehistoric times, followed by the Celts and Romans between 450 BCE and 4000 CE. The castle is closely connected with the nearby St. Martins Cathedral, as it was the place for Hungarian Coronations. The castle, through different reigns, has undergone many reconstructions and style changes. In recent times, the castle has become a National Cultural Monument and was rebuilt in 1960, after it was left in ruins for over a century after a fire destroyed it in 1811.\n\nPresidential Palace (Grassalkovich Palace)\n\nBeing a tourist in Bratislava and visiting the Grassalkovich Palace is like a tourist in the United States visiting the White House. It’s currently the seat of the President of Slovakia, but it originally was built in 1760 as a Rococo style summer palace for the chairman of the Hungarian Royal Chamber and adviser to Empress Maria Theresa. It’s elegance and grace quickly made it a sought-after venue for elite social events. It wasn’t until 1996 that the palace was transformed into the seat of Slovakia’s president. However, when visiting it’s unlikely you’ll get a chance to see the president, as he doesn’t actually live here.\n\nThe palace is located on the north edge of Old Town and is in the busy public square, Hodžovo Námestie. When you arrive at the square and walk through the courtyard, you’ll probably first notice the fountain with the large sphere, representing Earth and symbolizing freedom. The palace is guarded by the Palace Guards, and while we weren’t there at the right time, we’ve heard that visitors can watch the ceremonial changing of the guards at 12 noon or 1 pm (we’ve heard both times, so we’re not entirely sure, but figured we’d include both possibilities). Unfortunately, the palace isn’t open to visitors and you’ll be stuck peering through the ornate black and gold wrought iron fence."
