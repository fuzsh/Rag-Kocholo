        "meta_description": "This colored copperplate view of Bratislava (Posonium in Latin, known as Pressburg during the period of the Austrian and Austro-Hungarian Empire) is the oldest and best-known popular depiction of the city. The creator of this edited copy of the print was the German master Franz Hogenberg (1535-90). At the time the print was made, Bratislava was the capital of Hungary and was also a coronation city of the Habsburg rulers. The view depicts the Danube River, dominated by Bratislava Castle, which was a seat of the Hungarian part of the Habsburg monarchy until 1780. An interesting note in the upper-right part of the view mentions Wolfgang Lazius (1514-65), who was an important Hungarian humanist and cartographer and the author of the second oldest map of Hungary (1556). In 1593 this view was used in the book Civitates orbis terrarum. Liber quartus urbium praecipuarum totius mundi (The cities of the world. The fourth book of the principal cities of the world), published in Cologne by Georg Braun and Franz Hogenberg.",
