        "text": "The following lists show the administrative divisions of the lands belonging to the Hungarian crown (1000–1920) at selected points of time. The names are given in the main official language used in the Kingdom at the times in question.\n\nFor details on the functioning and development of the counties and some other administrative divisions see Counties of the Kingdom of Hungary.\n\nThis article does not show all states of administrative divisions that existed throughout the centuries, only the major ones. Especially for the medieval period, various sources often give slightly different divisions. Also, the lists of the individual points of time stem from different sources so that the first-level categorization is not necessarily compatible over time.\n\nAround 1074, the whole Kingdom of Hungary consisted of some 45–50 counties. The existence of many of them is disputed for this time period.\n\nThe following castles are assumed to have been seats of frontier counties (marchiae, határispánságok), it is probable that other castles were such seats as well (ordered from the north to the south):\n\nin present-day Slovakia: Bratislava (at that time: Bresburc/ Preslawaspurch/Poson), Hlohovec (at that time: Golguc/Golgoc), Trenčín (at that time: Treinchen), Beckov (at that time: Blundus), Nitra (at that time: Nitria), Šintava (at that time: Sempte), Gemer Castle (at that time: Gomur), Zemplin Castle (at that time: Zemněn, Zemlyn)\n\nin present-day Ukraine: Uzhhorod (Ungvár), Borsova\n\nin present-day Hungary: Moson Castle, Sopron, Novum Castrum (Hungarian at that time: Újvár), Borsod Castle, Vasvár, Karakó (near Jánosháza), Zalavár (called Kolon at that time)\n\npresent-day Romania: Dobaca (Hungarian: Doboka), Alba Iulia (Hungarian: Gyulafehérvár), Cluj-Napoca (Hungarian: Kolozsvár), Satu Mare (Hungarian: Szatmárnémeti), Timișoara (Hungarian: Temesvár), Turda (Hungarian: Torda)\n\npresent-day Croatia: Vukovar (Hungarian: Valkóvár)\n\npresent-day Serbia: Belgrade (Hungarian at that time: Fehérvár), Stara Palanka (Hungarian: Haram (Krassó)), Kovin (Hungarian: Kéve)\n\nIn the late 14th and in the 15th century there were around 70 counties, out of which 7(?) under the voivodship of Transylvania (in present-day Romania), 7 under the banate of Slavonia (mainly in present-day Slavonia and Croatia), and the rest forming Hungary proper (mainly present-day Hungary and Slovakia, with 10 counties entirely and 11 partially in present-day Slovakia.\n\nHalasszék (a sedes)\n\nJászság\n\nKolbázszék (a sedes)\n\nKunság\n\nProvincia XXIV oppidorum terrae Scepusiensis (in 1412, thirteen of the towns were pawned to Poland and kept a special status)\n\nAranyensis sedes (Hungarian:Aranyosszék)\n\nCsikiensis sedes (Csíkszék)\n\nGiergiensis sedes (Gyergyószék)\n\nKászonszék (a sedes; Casin in Romanian)\n\nKesdiensis sedes (Kézdiszék)\n\nMarusiensis sedes (Marosszék)\n\nOrbai sedes (Orbaiszék)\n\nSepsiensis sedes (Sepsiszék)\n\nUdvarhelyensis sedes (Udvarhelyszék)\n\nTheir number was changing (the mining towns were largely situated in the Upper Lands – present-day Slovakia)\n\nIn the 16th century, the Kingdom was so gravely impacted by Ottoman conquest that its territory was reduced to almost a third of its previous size. By 1541, the remaining part was renamed Royal Hungary and ruled by the Habsburgs.\n\nIn 1547, Royal Hungary was divided for military and partly also administrative purposes in two captaincies-general (Hungarian: főkapitányságok, Slovak: hlavné kapitanáty):\n\nCisdanubia (largely present-day Slovakia)\n\nTransdanubia (the remaining Royal Hungary).\n\nLater on, these captaincies were further subdivided.\n\nIn 1553 and 1578, southern and southeastern regions were split off into the Military Frontier and were de facto no longer part of the Kingdom.\n\nAlso, after 1606 there were the following captaincies-general:\n\nCaptaincy of Upper Hungary (eastern Slovakia and adjacent northeastern present-day Hungary, part of present-day northern Romania and part of Carpathian Ruthenia, created 1563)\n\nCaptaincy of Lower Hungary (western and central Slovakia, created 1563)\n\nCaptaincy of Győr (territories between Lake Balaton and river Danube)\n\nCaptaincy of Kanizsa (western Hungary)\n\nCaptaincy of Croatia (western Croatia)\n\nCaptaincy of Slavonia (northern Croatia)\n\nNote that many of the counties ceased to exist during the Turkish occupation (app. 1541 – 1699/1718). For administrative divisions on the Turkish territory see Ottoman Empire.\n\nAfter the defeat of the Turks there were some 70 counties in the whole Kingdom of Hungary again. After the final defeat of the Turks in 1718, the three southern counties Temesiensis, Torontaliensis and Krassovinsis created the special administrative district Banatus Temesiensis (Hungarian: Temesi Bánság). This district was dissolved again in 1779, but its southernmost part remained part of the Military Frontier (Confiniaria militaria) till the late 19th century.\n\nThe following list does not show Transylvania. The \"districtus\" is only a traditional formal division. Note that some of the previous counties, e. g. the Zarandiensis, were part of Transylvania at this time.\n\n(a) Districtus Cis-Danubianus (13):\n\nArvensis\n\nBacsensis\n\nBarsiensis\n\nHonthiensis\n\nLyptoviensis\n\nNitriensis\n\nNeogradiensis\n\nPesthiensis\n\nPosoniensis\n\nStrigoniensis\n\nTrenchiniensis\n\nTurocziensis\n\nZoliensis\n\n(b) Districtus Trans-Danubianus (11):\n\nAlbensis\n\nBaranyiensis\n\nCastriferrei\n\nComaromiensis\n\nJauriensis\n\nMosoniensis,\n\nSimigiensis\n\nSoproniensis\n\nTolnensis\n\nVesprimiensis\n\nSzaladiensis\n\n(c) Districtus Cis-Tybiscanus (10):\n\nAbaujvariensis\n\nBereghiensis\n\nBorsodiensis\n\nGömöriensis\n\nHevesiensis et Szolnok mediocris\n\nSarosiensis\n\nScepusiensis\n\nTornensis\n\nUnghvariensis\n\nZempliniensis\n\n(d) Districtus Trans-Tibiscanus (12):\n\nAradiensis\n\nBekesiensis\n\nBihariensis\n\nCsanadiensis\n\nCsongradiensis\n\nKrassovinsis\n\nMaramarosiensis\n\nSzabolcsensis\n\nSzathmariensis\n\nTemesiensis\n\nTorontaliensis\n\nUgotgensis\n\n(e) Counties between the Drava and Sava (after the defeat of the Turks around 1700, they were considered part of Croatia-Slavonia):\n\nPoseganus\n\nSirmiensis\n\nVerovitiensis/Vukovariensis\n\nThese were privileged territories, which were totally exempt from the county system.\n\nDistrictus Jazygum et Cumanum (Hungarian: Jászkunság / Jászkun kerület)\n\nOppida sedecim Scepusiensia - since 1772, before 1772 the towns were pawned to Poland and had another special status\n\nOppida privilegiata Hajdonicalia (Hungarian: Hajdúság) – since the 17th century\n\nTheir number was changing\n\nFor details see Comitatus (Kingdom of Hungary)\n\nDuring this period, the Kingdom of Croatia (with Međimurje), Kingdom of Slavonia, and the Voivodeship of Serbia and Banatus Temesiensis (Szerb vajdaság és Temesi bánság) were separated from the Kingdom of Hungary and directly subordinated to Vienna (Austria). The remaining territory of the Kingdom of Hungary (which did not include Transylvania at that time) was divided into 5 Districts. These Districts were divided into counties, whose traditional territories were modified in 1850 and 1853; several of the traditional counties were merged or partitioned. The official language during this period was German. The districts and counties were:[1]\n\nPest-Ofen[a]\n\nPest-Pilis.[a] The northern part of the former Pest-Pilis-Solt County, including all of the former county of Pilis.[b]\n\nPest-Solt.[a] The southern part of Pest-Pilis-Solt, including all of the former region of Solt.[c]\n\nStuhlweißenburg (Székesfehérvár; former Fejér County under the name of its capital Stuhlweißenburg)\n\nGran (Esztergom).

Western part around Elek attached to Békes-Csanad in 1853.\n\nCsanad (1849–53)\n\nBekes (1849–53)\n\nBékes-Csanad (1853–60).[3] Included the former territories of Békes and Csanad as well as the area around Elek which had previously belonged to Arad county (including a salient (panhandle) of formerly Arad territory which lay between Békes and Csanad).\n\nOber-Bihar (Upper/Over Bihar, 1850–53)\n\nUnter-Bihar (Lower/Under Bihar, 1850–53)\n\nSüd-Bihar (South Bihar, 1853–60).[2]: V Former southern territory of Bihar (mostly delineated by the Berettyó/Barcău river and associated canals).[i]\n\nNord-Bihar (North Bihar, 1853–60).[2]: V Former northern territory of Bihar (mostly delineated by the Berettyó/Barcău river and associated canals), as well as the former Hajdúság and former western parts of Szabolcs County.[j]\n\nSzatmar\n\nSzabolcz\n\nSzabolcz mit den Haiduken-Städten (Szabolcz with the Hajdú cities; 1849–53). The Hajdúság and western parts of Szabolcz were attached to Nord-Bihar 1853.\n\nIn October 1860, the Districts were abolished and the pre-1848 counties were restored.\n\nFrom 1867 the administrative and political divisions of the lands belonging to the Hungarian crown (Kingdom of Hungary) were significantly remodelled. In 1868 Transylvania was definitely reunited with Hungary proper, and the town and district of Fiume (Rijeka) declared autonomous. In 1873 part of the Military Frontier was united with Hungary proper and part with Croatia-Slavonia. Hungary proper, according to ancient usage, was generally divided into four great divisions or circles, and Transylvania up to 1876 was regarded as the fifth.\n\nIn 1876 a general system of counties was introduced. According to this division Hungary proper was divided into seven statistical regions having no administrative functions, of which Transylvania formed one.\n\nThe following administrative divisions existed between 1886 and 1920:\n\nIn the following, the key in the brackets gives the capital towns around 1910 first (note however that the capitals were usually changing throughout the centuries) and then the abbreviation for the country in which the territory is situated today:\n\nThe Kingdom of Hungary was divided into the following 71 counties:\n\n(a) On the left bank of the Danube:\n\nÁrva County (Alsókubin, SK, PL)\n\nBars County (Aranyosmarót, SK)\n\nEsztergom County (Esztergom, SK, HU)\n\nHont County (Ipolyság, SK, HU)\n\nLiptó County (Liptószentmiklós, SK)\n\nNógrád County (Balassagyarmat, SK, HU)\n\nNyitra County (Nyitra, SK)\n\nPozsony County (Pozsony, SK, HU)\n\nTrencsén County (Trencsén, SK)\n\nTuróc County (Turócszentmárton, SK)\n\nZólyom County (Besztercebánya, SK)\n\n(b) On the right bank of the Danube:\n\nBaranya County (Pécs, HU, HR)\n\nFejér County (Székesfehérvár, HU)\n\nGyőr County (Győr, HU, SK)\n\nKomárom County (Komárom, SK, HU)\n\nMoson County (Mosonmagyaróvár, HU, AT, SK)\n\nSomogy County (Kaposvár, HU)\n\nSopron County (Sopron, HU, AT)\n\nTolna County (Szekszárd, HU)\n\nVas County (Szombathely, HU, AT, SI)\n\nVeszprém County (Veszprém, HU)\n\nZala County (Zalaegerszeg, HU, HR, SI)\n\n(c) Between the Danube and Tisza:\n\nBács-Bodrog County (Zombor, HU, SR)\n\nCsongrád County (Szentes, HU, SR)\n\nHeves County (Eger, HU)\n\nJász-Nagykun-Szolnok County (Szolnok, HU)\n\nPest-Pilis-Solt-Kiskun County (Budapest, HU)\n\n(d) On the right bank of the Tisza:\n\nAbaúj-Torna County (Kassa, SK, HU) Note: formed in 1881 from the counties of Abaúj County and Torna County.\n\nBereg County (Beregszász, UA, HU)\n\nBorsod County (Miskolc, HU)\n\nGömör és Kis-Hont County (Rimaszombat, SK, HU)\n\nSáros County (Eperjes, SK)\n\nSzepes County (Lőcse, SK, PL)\n\nUng County (Ungvár, UA, SK, HU)\n\nZemplén County (Sátoraljaújhely, SK, HU)\n\n(e) On the left bank of the Tisza:\n\nBékés County (Gyula, HU)\n\nBihar County (Nagyvárad, RO, HU)\n\nHajdú County (Debrecen, HU)\n\nMáramaros County (Máramarossziget, UA, RO)\n\nSzabolcs County (Nyíregyháza, HU, UA)\n\nSzatmár County (Nagykároly, RO, HU)\n\nSzilágy County (Zilah, RO)\n\nUgocsa County (Nagyszőllős, UA, RO)\n\n(f) Between the Tisza and the Maros:\n\nArad County (Arad, RO, HU)\n\nCsanád County (Makó, HU, RO)\n\nKrassó-Szörény County (Lugos, RO) Note: formed in 1880 from the counties of Krassó County and Szörény County.\n\nTemes County (Temesvár, RO, SR)\n\nTorontál County (Nagybecskerek, SR, RO, HU)\n\n(g) Királyhágón túl (i.e. \"over the royal pass through the mountains\", roughly equal to Transylvania, all in present-day Romania):\n\nAlsó-Fehér County (Nagyenyed)\n\nBeszterce-Naszód County (Beszterce)\n\nBrassó County (Brassó)\n\nCsík County (Csíkszereda)\n\nFogaras County (Fogaras)\n\nHáromszék County (Sepsiszentgyörgy)\n\nHunyad County (Déva)\n\nKis-Küküllő County (Dicsőszentmárton)\n\nKolozs County (Kolozsvár)\n\nMaros-Torda County (Marosvásárhely)\n\nNagy-Küküllő County (Segesvár)\n\nSzeben County (Nagyszeben)\n\nSzolnok-Doboka County (Dés)\n\nTorda-Aranyos County (Torda)\n\nUdvarhely County (Székelyudvarhely)\n\nKingdom of Croatia and Slavonia was divided into eight counties (all, except for most of Syrmia, in present-day Croatia):\n\nBjelovar-Križevci (Bjelovar, HR)\n\nLika-Krbava (Gospić, HR)\n\nModruš-Rijeka (Ogulin, HR)\n\nPožega (Požega, HR)\n\nSyrmia (Vukovar, HR, SR)\n\nVaraždin (Varaždin, HR)\n\nVirovitica (Osijek, HR)\n\nZagreb (Zagreb, HR)\n\nThe following 30 Hungarian towns had municipal rights:\n\nHungary proper had twenty-six urban counties or towns with municipal rights.
