        "text": "10 capitals round trip\n\nThis is the ultimate round trip for those who wish to spend their holiday on seeing as many countries and cultures as possible without spending a fortune. The trip includes 10 capitals in southeastern Europe. As all the cities have well connected international airports nearby you can start the trip in any of the cities, hence you can let the cheapest flight decide where you start your budget round trip 🙂\n\nHere is a summary of the 9-day schedule:\n\nDay 1 – Prague\n\nDay 2 – Bratislava and Budapest\n\nDay 3 – Budapest\n\nDay 4 – Belgrade\n\nDay 5 – Skopje and Podgorica\n\nDay 6 – Podgorica and Sarajevo\n\nDay 7 – Sarajevo and Zagreb\n\nDay 8 – Zagreb and Ljubljana\n\nDay 9 – Vienna\n\nDoing the trip in 9 days is at the limit of what is possible when travelling on budget, if you have more time at your disposal, like e.g. 14 days, you would of course, be able to see much more of the respective cities and countries, for each day on the tour we have added a suggestion for additional sights and cities to see, in case you do a prolonged version of the round trip.\n\nAt the end of the post, we have made a budget, roughly showing the cost of the trip.\n\nDay 1: Prague\n\nFirst stop on the round trip is Prague, from the Václav Havel airport is takes you about 30 min to 1 hour to get to any part of the city. As Prague really has a lot to offer you should plan an overnight here, for the purpose of the continuous travel it would be wise to pick some accommodation in some area from where you can easily reach the main train station or the Florence bus station either on foot or by metro. Here are the top five things to see in Prague:\n\nPrague castle (Hradčany) and the St. Vitus Cathedral, absolutely the most amazing sight in town!\n\nCharles Bridge, world famous bridge over the Vltava river.\n\nVyšehrad (Upper castle)\n\nWenceslas Square\n\nOld town square\n\nIn general, spend as much time as possible walking around (or use the tram) in the old town area, there are so many beautiful squares, museums and buildings to see on both side of the river Vltava.\n\nNOTE: The Prague astronomical clock at the old town square is something you should for sure see, but in many guides “The hourly Walk of the Apostles” is recommended as a must see, however, believe me I’ve been there and done that, it’s nothing you need to spend valuable time waiting for.\n\nProlonged trip Czech Republic: Visit the cities Karlovy Vary, Olomouc and Plzen and also the 4 Czech National parks, Krkonose, Podyji, Sumava and Ceske Svycarsko are something to consider.\n\nGetting around in Prague: Metro, tram and city buses, 30 min ticket ~ 1 Euro, 24 hour ticket ~ 4 Euro. You also have sightseeing buses (Hop on – Hop off) and old timers which are fairly expensive.\n\nAccommodation: In May hostel a bed is available from about 10 Euro, in July / August from about 20 Euro.\n\nPrice level in Czech Republic: Big Mac Index 2.91 (US 5.06)\n\nCurrency: Češka kruna – CZK (Use ATM or exchange at the official tourist office in the center of town)\n\nFrom Prague you should continue your trip to Bratislava. As you will not be staying overnight in Bratislava you should plan to leave Prague fairly early. You have the following travel options available.\n\nBus from the Florenc bus station to Bratislava which costs around 15 Euro (Travel time about 4 hours 30 minutes)\n\nTrain from main train station to Bratislava train station, price from 25 Euro (Travel time about 4 hours)\n\nDay 2: Bratislava & Budapest\n\nRegardless whether you arrive by train or by bus to Bratislava first thing to do upon arrival is to store your luggage, both the Mlynské Nivy Bus terminal and the main train station have luggage storage office, once you fixed that part you are ready to explore Bratislava. From both bus and train station you have city buses towards center of town. In Bratislava the top five things to see are the following:\n\nDevin Castle, great view on the city\n\nBratislava Castle\n\nOld Town square with the old town Hall\n\nSt. Michael’s Street and St. Michael’s Gate\n\nPrimatial Palace in Bratislava\n\nIn addition to these sights you have several interesting museums and old churches, and just walking around in the small streets of the old part is something to recommend.\n\nProlonged trip Slovakia: Visit the cities Banska Stiavnica, Bardejov (both on UNESCO heritage list), Košice, Levoca, make sure to see the Spis Castle and the Dobsinska Ice Cave (Both on UNESCO Heritage List). If you like visiting great nature spots, Slovakia has an impressive 9 national parks, the most popular being Tatra National Park and the Paradise National Park.\n\nGetting around in Bratislava: tram and city buses, 30 min ticket 0.90 EUR, 24 hour ticket 3.5 Euro.\n\nAccommodation: In May hostel a bed is available from about 10 Euro, in July / August from about 15 Euro.\n\nPrice level in Slovakia: IMF World Economic Outlook Database $0.54 ($1.00 US)\n\nCurrency: Euro – EUR\n\nOnce you are finished seeing the center of Bratislava, it time to move to the next destination on the round trip which is Budapest, between the two capitals you have the following travel options:\n\nBus from Bratislava to Budapest which cost about 10-15 Euro (Travel time about 2.5 to 3 hours)\n\nTrain from Bratislava Main Railway Station to Budapest Keleti pu. railway station, price from 25 Euro (Travel time around 3 hours)\n\nNOTE: As it is a bit of hassle moving between the bus station and the train station in Bratislava, I would recommend that you take transport towards Budapest, from where you stored your luggage, also pay attention to closing time of the luggage storage. (should be 9pm, but double checking will not harm). Make sure to pre-book accommodation in Budapest where you will arrive late.\n\nDay 3: Budapest\n\nAfter a good night sleep it is time to explore Budapest, but before you head to the center of town, you should bring your luggage to either the Keleti Train Station or the Népliget Bus terminal, depending on weather you will continue from Budapest to Belgrade by train or bus in the evening. Both the bus and the railway station can easily be reached by Metro.\n\nNOTE: Alternatively you can also leave your luggage at the Budapest Luggage Storage, Régi posta utca 7-9.\n\nIf you plan well, you should have about 10-12 hours to see Budapest, which is not enough if you wish to see all sights, museums and historical buildings, but you should for sure be able to see all the top sights, my favorite sights are the following five:\n\nCastle Hill / Buda Castle (UNESCO heritage site)\n\nParliament Buildings and Crown Jewels\n\nHeroes’ Square and the Millennium Monument\n\nSt. Stephen’s Basilica\n\nFisherman’s Bastion\n\nProlonged trip Hungary: Visit the cities Village of Hollókő and Pécs and Pannonhalma Abbey in Gyor, caves Aggtelek and Domica as well as the national parks Hortobágy, Aggtelek National Park and the Lake Neusiedl, all sights and cities included in the UNESCO Heritage list.\n\nGetting around in Budapest: Metro, tram, trolleys, city buses and boats, single ticket from about 1 Euro, 24 hour ticket 5.5 Euro. You also have sightseeing buses (Hop on – Hop off) as an alternative!\n\nAccommodation: In May hostel a bed is available from about 5 Euro, in July / August from about 10 Euro.\n\nPrice level in Hungary: Big Mac Index 3.05 (US 5.06)\n\nCurrency: Hungarian Forint – HUF\n\nAs mentioned above, the next step on your round trip is Belgrade which conveniently can be reached by overnight bus or overnight train.\n\nOvernight bus from Budapest main bus terminal to Belgrade costs about 25 Euro and has a travel time of about 6 hours.\n\nOvernight train from Budapest Keleti to the main railway station in Belgrade, price from about 15 Euro, travel time around 7 hours.\n\nDay 4: Belgrade\n\nOnce you arrive in Belgrade, you should leave your luggage at the storage facilities at the BAS bus station or the railway station (Located next to each other), luggage storage should be open from 6am, once that is done, grab some breakfast, e.g at the Mcdonalds at the Slavija Square which is 1 km walk from the train station or a few stops by tram.\n\nAs you will spend the whole day in Belgrade, you have plenty of time to explore the city, here are the things you should not miss out on:\n\nBelgrade fortress\n\nFortress Kalemegdan\n\nSkadarlija (the heart of the old town)\n\nSt. Michael’s Cathedral\n\nSt. Sava Temple (Hram Svetog Save)\n\nProlonged trip Serbia: Visit the cities, Novi Sad, Nis and one or more of the 8 Serbian UNESCO heritage sites, Studenci Monastery, Sopocani, Stari Ras, Visoki Decani, Patriarchate of Pec, Our Lady of Ljevis, Gracanica Monastery and Stecak. Also the five National parks, Tara, Derdap, Kopaonik, Fruska Gora and Sar Mountain are something to consider when staying longer in Serbia.\n\nGetting around in Belgrade: Tram, trolleys, city buses, single ticket from about 0.40 € (40 RSD), 24 hour ticket 2.5 € (280 RSH).\n\nAccommodation: In May hostel a bed is available from about 5 Euro, in July / August from about 10 Euro.\n\nPrice level in Serbia: No index prices, but it is quite cheap compared to US or western Europe.\n\nCurrency: Serbian Dinar – RSD\n\nIn the evening (after 8pm) you should leave Belgrade and travel towards Skopje in Macedonia, the travel options are:\n\nOvernight bus from Belgrade from main bus terminal is available from about 20 Euro, travel time with bus is about 7-8 hours.\n\nOvernight train from Belgrade’s main railway station you can take the Balkan Express train to Skopje railway station, price from about 20 Euro, travel time around 9 hours.\n\nDay 5: Skopje & Podgorica\n\nAround 6am – 8am in the morning you should arrive to Skopje, as the railway and bus station are located next to each other you will in either case leave your at the bus / train station and in the neighborhood you also have plenty of options to get some breakfast. If you feel like needing a shower probably best option is to rent a hostel bed, although you will not be sleeping in Skopje.\n\nSkopje, despite being less known, as a tourist destination actually has quite a few interesting sights and city parts which are worthwhile seeing, here are some of the most popular:\n\nOld Bazaar\n\nMacedonia Square, Plostad Makedonija\n\nMother Teresa Memorial House\n\nStone Bridge (Mehmed II)\n\nHolocaust Memorial Center\n\nFortress Kale\n\nIn addition to these sights, there are numerous museums and historical buildings which you could add to the list.\n\nProlonged trip Macedonia: Visit the Lake Ohrid and the region around it which is a UNESCO Natural and Cultural Heritage site, also the 3 Macedonian National parks Pelister, Mavrovo and Galicica are something to consider.\n\nGetting around in Skopje: city buses, single ticket from about 0.50 € (30. MKD), interesting is that lots of the busses are london double decker style, so if you catch a seat on the upper level, you have a “sightseeing” included in the bus fair.\n\nAccommodation: In May hostel a bed is available from about 5 Euro, in July / August from about 7 Euro.\n\nPrice level in Macedonia: Global property guide, cost of living index 0.35 $ (US 1.00$)\n\nCurrency: Macedonian Denar – MKD\n\nFrom Skopje you will be travelling by bus to Podgorica in Montenegro, for this trip you basically have two options, either you can leave in the afternoon and sleep in Podgorica, or you can take an overnight bus between the cities. Train is not an option when travelling between these cities.\n\nDay 6: Podgorica & Sarajevo\n\nDue to its fairly small size Podgorica is not a honeypot when it comes to sight, so you might not want to spend too much time here, what you should see are the Millennium Bridge, Saborni Hram Hristovog Vaskrsenja and the Clock Tower, as this would not take that long, you can consider to take a bus to Budva which is 1 hour 30 min from Podgorica, here you will find a beautiful old town and a fortress which is worthwhile seeing, in the early evening hours you will have to head back to Podgorica to catch the overnight bus towards Sarajevo, alternative to that plan is to leave Podgorica early afternoon and then sleep in Sarajevo.\n\nProlonged trip Montenegro: Visit the cities Budva, Kotor (UNESCO), Ulcinj, Herceg Novi, Bar and Tivat, also the Stećci Medieval Tombstone Graveyards which was recently accepted as at UNESCO Heritage site is something to consider, for those who prefer wonderful nature, there are 5 national parks, Biogradska Gora, Lovcen, Lake Skadar, Prokletije and National park Durmitor which is a UNESCO Heritage site.\n\nGetting around in Podgorica: city buses, single ticket from about 0.40 €.\n\nAccommodation: In May hostel a bed is available from about 8 Euro, in July / August from about 12 Euro.\n\nPrice level in Podgorica: Global property guide, cost of living index 0.40 $ (US 1.00$)\n\nCurrency: Euro €\n\nDay 7: Sarajevo & Zagreb\n\nThe first morning task in Sarajevo is to leave your luggage at the bus or train station which are located next to each other.
