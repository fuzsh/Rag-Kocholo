It offers its visitors alluring mix of tourist activities, unique food and great history, yet it is often overlooked by international visitors, who wander around Central Europe. It is usually Poland, Czech Republic, Hungary and Austria that appear on their itineraries and if they visit Slovakia, it is only the capital Bratislava that they come to see only for one day. best things to do in Slovakia\n\nSlovakia offers such a wide array of activities and I am sure it will surprise you. It is my home, and although I moved away several years ago, I am always thrilled to come back and explore it over and over again. In this article I’ll give you some top tips what to do here and reasons why you should give Slovakia a chance during your next Europe trip.\n\nGeneral Travel Information\n\nCurrency\n\nEuro\n\nLanguage\n\nSlovak Language, but you should be able to communicate in English or German.\n\nVisa\n\nSlovakia is a member state of the European Union, so you need the Schengen visa to be able to enter the country (if you, of course, travel from outside the EU).\n\nTransport\n\nThe easiest way to get around is by car.

In comparison to other European capitals, Bratislava is quite small and walkable in one day, especially the Old Town which is the most charming part of the city. Here are some spots not to miss when wandering around\n\nBratislava Castle\n\nthe castle is the pride of Bratislava sitting on a hill overlooking the city. Unfortunately the castle is not open to public, but you can visit the baroque gardens and enjoy some really spectacular views on Danube River and rest of the city.\n\nBlue Church\n\nthis art novena church in baby blue color looks like from a fairy tale and it is also featured in Mini Europe Park in Brussels.\n\nSt.Martin's Cathedral\n\nGothic cathedral in the city center.\n\nMichael's Gate\n\nFormer Medieval entrance to the city\n\nThe Main Square (Hlavné Námestie)\n\nNumerous historical landmarks with beautiful views of Bratislava old town from Old Town hall tower ( Stara Radnica).\n\nThe UFO Tower and Observation Deck\n\nbelongs to the World Federation of Great Towers and it offers the best panoramic views over the old town, Bratislava Castle and Danube River. You can enjoy a cocktail or a nice meal in the restaurant while waiting for the sunset, the more adventurous ones can try 85 m high sky-walk.\n\nHike in High Tatras\n\nHigh Tatra Mountains are our national pride and a true hiking paradise for all outdoors enthusiasts. The first visitors started to come here in the 16th century in search for leisure and relax in nature. Today, High Tatras National Park has something for everyone – from easy walks for families, to multi-days tracks, when you sleep in wooden mountain lodges on bunk beds with complete strangers. The villages nearby offer accommodation for all budgets and the locals can best help you, which hike would be the most suitable for you.\n\nMost popular hikes in High Tatras:\n\nEASY WALKS\n\nMEDIUM DIFFICULTY\n\nFOR SKILLED HIKERS\n\nEASY WALKS\n\nHike to Popradské Pleso Lake – about 10 km long but the terrain is mostly flat\n\nFrom Štrbské Pleso Lake to Skok waterfall – about 11 km long\n\nMEDIUM DIFFICULTY\n\n14,5 km long hike to Sliezsky Dom Lodge when you are passing by several mountain lakes\n\n13,8 km hike to the lodge nearby Zelené Pleso Lake\n\nFOR SKILLED HIKERS\n\nHike to Rysy in 2499 metres height\n\nHike to Gerlach Mountain – the highest peak of Slovakia which is 2654 metres tall (the trek takes approximately 9 hours)\n\nIf hiking is not really your cup of tea, High Tatras offer an array of different activities to enjoy, for example Aqua Parks Tatralandia and Bešeňová, museum of illusions Tricklandia, cable car to the top of Lomnický Štít Mountain, Zoo Kontakt where you can pet animals etc.\n\nMarvel inside breathtaking caves\n\nSlovakia is truly beautiful on the surface but the real gems are hiding underground. There are actually over 7 thousand caves within Slovakia and 13 of them are open to public. Most of these remarkable caves are located in Slovak Karst National Park and they are listed in UNESCO World Heritage Sites. To mention a few best things to do in Slovakia\n\nOchtinská Aragonite Cave\n\nis one of the three caves in the world with such a rich natural decorations of aragonite – the two others are located in Mexico and Argentina.\n\nDobšinská Ice Cave\n\nis covered in ice all year round and is rated as one of the most remarkable ice caves in the world. Ondrej Nepela, famous Slovak figure skater and an Olympic winner from 1972, used to train in this cave! Today the cave is national protected area so ice skating is not possible anymore.\n\nDomica\n\nis part of the 25 km long cave system, which ends up in Hungary. When the underground waters are high enough, you can sail in small motor-less boats on an underground river all the way to Hungarian cave Baradla.\n\nDemänovská Cave of Liberty\n\nis part of the longest cave system in Slovakia and is also the most visited cave because of its rich natural limestone decorations.\n\nSoak in hot springs\n\nSlovakia is very rich in natural water resources. It is second only to Austria in largest natural freshwater supplies and you can find here more than 1500 officially registered natural springs. You can buy many different types of mineral water which it literally flows from our taps as well (good quality water is something I really miss overseas). Apart from the drinking water, many of the springs are used as thermal spas with healing effects. Here are some of the most popular and beneficial ones:\n\nPodhájska\n\nHot springs that have more beneficial waters than Dead Sea.\n\nSklenné Teplice\n\nfor everyone who likes the water particularly hot.\n\nPiešťany\n\nSlovakias best know SPA town.\n\nBojnice\n\nbesides good quality spa, the town of Bojnice has also a charming castle and a ZOO located right in the city center.\n\nBardejov\n\non the east of Slovakia. Bardejov is lovely historical town with unique architecture\n\nFor the full information about all the spas in Slovakia head to link HERE.\n\nVisit old villages with traditional architecture\n\nThere are quite a few picturesque villages in Slovakia where you will feel like you stepped back in time, but Vlkolínec and Čičmany are both like straight from a fairy tale. You will find here small wooden houses from 13th-14th century that are built solely in architecture style typical for their region. Vlkolínec is part of UNESCO Natural Heritage Site, set on the mountain backdrop surrounded by meadows and Čičmany villages looks like they are made of ginger bread, with typical folk drawings on them. best things to do in Slovakia\n\nTry typical Slovak cuisine\n\nSlovak cuisine has been influenced by surrounding countries over the history when we used to be the part of the Austrian-Hungarian Kingdom. However, Slovak people always took a special twist on the local cuisine and created dishes typical for their region. If you are all about healthy diet, you probably won’t find anything suitable, because Slovak food is quite heavy, very hearty, but above all super delicious!\n\nWhen travelling to Slovakia, you have to try our national dish which we are very proud of. It’s called bryndzové halušky and it is kind of gnocchi with sheep cheese and bacon. Among other significant dishes to try, I would like to mention:\n\nCreamy garlic soup served in bread (Slovak bread is the best!),\n\nSavory potato pancakes lokše that you eat with sour cabbage and roasted goose or duck,\n\nSweet steamed buns buchty filled with jam, walnuts or poppy seeds,\n\nPirohy that are similar to Polish pierogi but in Slovakia they are often eaten sweet,\n\nGoulash soup made outdoors over open fire,\n\nChimney cake from Skalica (trdelník) – you can find this type of chimney cake in other countries but Slovak city Skalica actually has patent for the recipe,\n\nCabbage soup – it’s a staple Christmas dish in many households, but can be eaten all year round.\n\nThese are just couple of my favorites, but there are many amazing local foods in Slovakia. best things to do in Slovakia\n\nVisit other historic cities full of architectural treasures\n\nOld city centers of Slovak towns are architectural gems. They are often hundreds years old, their streets are paved with cobble stones and the old buildings are breathing with history. In summer, cafes and restaurants open their terraces outside so you can enjoy the relaxing vibe while sipping on iced coffee or cocktail. Here are some cities in central and eastern Slovakia that I always like to visit:\n\nBanská Štiavnica – is a popular getaway for many Slovak people. The whole city centre is UNESCO World Heritage listed with many hidden beautiful alleyways and you can also find here the world’s only Epicentre of Love. The whole idea behind this unique place came from the love poem ‘Marína’ by Slovak author Andrej Sládkovič published in 1846. With its 2910 lines, it is the longest love poem in the world. Even though the love of Marína and Andrej didn’t find their happy-ending, you can save your love here forever in the unique archive of love with mirror floors and verses of the poem on the walls.\n\nLevoča – another UNESCO Heritage listed town with the highest Gothic altar in the world located in the Basilica of St. Jacob.\n\nKremnica – small, well-preserved medieval town with long mining history located in central Slovakia.\n\nBanská Bystrica – biggest city in central Slovakia. It is an old mining town with long history. You can visit here Museum of Slovak National Uprising full of memoires of WW II.\n\nKošice – second biggest city in Slovakia (after Bratislava) located on the east of the country. It is famous for its beautiful Cathedral of St. Elizabeth and the oldest marathon in Europe (second oldest in the world) being held here non-stop every year on the first Sunday in October since 1924.\n\nExplore beautiful medevial castles\n\nSlovakia has the highest number of castles and chateaux per capita! You can find here about 180 castles and 425 chateaux. These numbers are quite impressive when you consider how small my country is. I don’t know a person who would visit all of them, moreover, some of them are just ruins, but here are few majestic castles that deserve your attention:\n\nSpišský Castle – is the largest fortified castle in Central Europe and no trip to Slovakia is complete without wandering around this magnificent complex from the 12th century. You can climb up its walls to see the views wide and far, or visit the dungeons where medieval torture chambres used to be.\n\nOrava Castle – was built on high rocks overlooking the Orava region. It was featured in many traditional Slovak movies and fairy tales.\n\nTrenčiansky Castle – magnificent castle from 10th century, one of the largest in Central Europe.\n\nBojnický Castle – the most beautiful castle in Slovakia that reminds of Cinderella’s castle from Disney movies.\n\nČervený Kameň Castle – not only the cellars under this castle create the largest underground complex in Central Europe, but also the oldest pharmacy was established here in 1649. This is my favorite castle in Slovakia, only about an hour drive from Bratislava. There’s a lovely park surrounding it and you can also visit a birds of prey show with eagles, hawks, ravens etc. best things to do in Slovakia\n\nTry some local beers and wines\n\nBesides the delicious cuisine, Slovakia also takes pride to be home to some world-class wineries and breweries. The tradition of wine making in Slovakia dates back 3000 years and today there are six main wine regions that are worth every wine lover’s attention. I grew up near the vineyards of Malokarpatská, or Lesser Carpathian Wine Region in southwestern part of Slovakia (it spreads between cities Bratislava and Trnava). Every year in September there are many wine festivals taking place in smaller cities of this region.

The wine festivals last all weekend and they are usually happening right in the streets!\n\nIf you consider yourself more of a beer person, there are quite a few microbreweries around Slovakia making refreshing beers. I would highly recommend visiting brewery Erb in Banská Štiavnica, which was also mentioned in Lonely Planet’s Global Beer Tour publication.
