        "text": "Bratislava is the capital of Slovakia. With a population of about 475,503, it is one of the smaller capitals of Europe but still the country's largest city. The greater metropolitan area is home to more than 800,000 people. Bratislava is in southwestern Slovakia, occupying both banks of the River Danube and the left bank of the River Morava. Bordering Austria and Hungary, it is the only national capital that borders two sovereign states.\n\nThe city's history has been strongly influenced by people of different nations and religions. It was the coronation site and legislative center of the Kingdom of Hungary from 1536 to 1783, and has been home to many Slovak, Hungarian and German historical figures."
