        "text": "However, despite the defeat of 1849, the revolution is seen as a key point in Hungary's history as it marks the beginning of an idea that defined the course of the modern-day Hungary as well. The Austrian Empire never regained its former political and military strength and by 1867 the duality of the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy was established, giving more autonomy to the Kingdom of Hungary than ever before during the Habsburg reign.\n\nAs you see, March 15 became the symbol of the independent, modern Hungary throughout the years which means that every year we honour the anniversary with specific traditions and customs. One of the most iconic ways to mark the day is wearing a special, tricolour badge: on March 15 people pin a rosette (“kokárda” in Hungarian) on their coats containing red, white and green ribbons, the colours of the Hungarian flag. These are sometimes hand-crafted but every other store has them during these days. The national flag is also hoisted on almost every building, on residential, public or private alike."
