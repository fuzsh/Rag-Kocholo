        "text": "Any modern atlas or encyclopedia will inform us that Bratislava is the capital of the Slovak Republic, the center of Slovak political and cultural life. But before World War I—or even toward the end of it in 1918—it was far from clear that the city could or should be defined as “Slovak,” to say nothing of a “Slovak capital”; that it was to belong to the future state of Czechoslovakia; or that it was to be called Bratislava. This essay will describe the processes that led to these outcomes, and how a name shift became a crucial instrument in the “Slovakization” of the city. In focusing also on the ways local and central actors responded to these political and symbolic transformations, I hope to shed new light on the complexity of collective identifications and allegiances, and on the significance of renaming as a catalyst for processes of nationalization in Central Europe in the early decades of the twentieth century.\n\n6 Majtán, Milan, “Ján Kollár, Pavol Jozef Šafárik a Štúrovci—a názov Bratislava” (Ján Kollár, Pavol Jozef Šafárik and the Štúr circle—and the name Bratislava), Slovenská archivistika (Slovak archival studies) 31, no. 2 (1996): 48–60Google Scholar. It would be misleading to interpret these initiatives as a focused policy for the “Slovakization” of Pressburg. For Kollár and Šafárik (the former by pure myth-making, the latter in a more scholarly discourse), the etymological Slavicizing of place names all over Europe served the overarching purpose of equipping the Slavs with a glorious past, establishing them as equal to the Germans. See Pynsent, Robert B., Questions of Identity: Czech and Slovak Ideas of Nationality and Personality (Budapest, 1994), 46–72Google Scholar. This “etymological aggressiveness” also characterized the Czech national revival (to which Kollár and Šafárik significantly contributed). Toponymy and etymology in general were crucial instruments in the creation of a Czech/Slavic world in a geographical sense, in the emerging “territorializing” of the idea of a Czech/Slavic national community; Macura, Vladimír, Znamení zrodu (The signs of the birth), rev. and exp. ed. (Jinočany, 1995), 53–56.Google Scholar\n\n11 In the key Slovak political declarations of 1848 and 1861, references to the state are mostly indirect. The most explicit passage is found in the so-called Vienna Memorandum of 6 December 1861: “[T]he Hungarian Slovaks created an independent state even before the immigration of the Magyars to Hungary and had a gratifying level of culture.” Such reasoning primarily served as arguments in the spirit of natural law that the Slovaks were the autochthonous nation of the region and hence equipped with primogenitary rights. The memorandum is reprinted in Dokumenty slovenskej národnej identity a štátnosti (Documents of Slovak national identity and statehood), 2 vols. (Bratislava, 1998), 1:344.Google Scholar\n\nThe fall of Great Moravia was eventually associated with the name Bratislava in a poem by Bulla, Juraj Zvestoň, “Žalmy tatranského Slovana”Google Scholar (Psalms of a Tatra Slav), published in 1860 in the almanac Lipa (The linden) and set to music soon afterwards: “Bratislava, Bratislava,/tam zapadla Slávov sláva,/tam pohanské hordy sa vztekaly,/Slávsku chasu dorúbaly./Ozvena naša je:/Bratislava, Bratislava,/tam zasvitne Slávov sláva,/ked' slovenské hroby sa otvoria,/a nový život nám utvoria” (Bratislava, Bratislava,/there the glory of the Slavs fell,/there the heathen hordes raged,/cut down the Slavic village youth./Our response is:/Bratislava, Bratislava/there the glory of the Slavs will shine/when the Slovak graves open/and create a new life for us). The poem refers to a battle near today's Bratislava in 907, where a Bavarian(!) army supporting the collapsing Moravian state was defeated by the Magyars.\n\n14 The first calls for autonomous political organs and for the recognition of a Slovak territory were presented in the Demands of the Slovak Nation issued in Liptovský Svätý Mikuláš on 10 May 1848, and in an Appeal to the Emperor of 19 March 1849. As independent political activities in Austria were again permitted after 1860, Slovak representatives formulated their demands in a memorandum, issued in Turčianský Svätý Martin on 7 June 1861, and in a memorandum to the emperor, issued in Vienna on 6 December 1861. The latter memorandum contained a very detailed proposal for the territorial and organizational structure of the Upper Hungarian Slovak District, including the first specific suggestion of a Slovak capital: Banská Bystrica in central Slovakia (full texts of all mentioned documents in Dokumenty slovenskej národnej identity, vol. 1, esp. 349).\n\n21 In this text, addressed to a major foreign decision maker, the Slovaks are bluntly said to be Czechs, and it is claimed (without or against evidence) that they strive for independence and accept the program of unification with Bohemia. A major part of the memorandum is devoted to proving that the new state will be big enough to survive, which again points to the strategic advantages of incorporating Slovakia. A Czech translation of the document is found in Beneš, Edvard, Světová válka a naše revoluce (The world war and our revolution), vol. 3, Dokumenty (Documents) (Prague, 1935), 237–56.Google Scholar\n\nThe idea of a corridor was possibly of Croatian origin, but Masaryk had already propagated it in December 1914, according to Beneš's summary of his account of his anti-Austrian program. Masaryk first suggested negotiating the corridor with the Slovenes, “then to prepare ethnographic maps,” that is, to find additional evidence for the project's legitimacy. See Beneš, , Dokumenty, 3–9, esp. 5Google Scholar. In his 1915 memorandum to Grey, Masaryk admitted that the corridor's population was mostly German, though with Serbo-Croat minorities. The corridor kept popping up in Masaryk's and Beneš's correspondence and memoranda until the summer of 1919.\n\n23 See Švorc, Peter, “Slováci v Amerike a vývin myšlienky česko-slovenskej štátnosri” (The Slovaks in America and the evolution of the idea of Czecho-Slovak statehood), Sborník k dějinám 19. a 20. století 13 (1993): 115–29Google Scholar; Minár, Imrich, Americkí Slováci a Slovensko 1880–1980 (The American Slovaks and Slovakia, 1880–1980) (Bratislava, 1994), 96–128, 193–208Google Scholar; Pekník, Miroslav, “Názory na riešenie slovenskej otázky za prvej svetovej vojny a počatky smerovania slovenskej politiky k vzniku Česko-Slovenska” (Opinions on the solution of the Slovak question during World War I and the beginnings of the orientation of Slovak politics toward the creation of Czecho-Slovakia), in Miroslav Pekník a kolektív, Pohl'ady na slovenskú politiku (Views on Slovak Politics) (Bratislava, 2000), 89–95 and 101–9Google Scholar; Hadler, Frank, “Die Herausbildung der tschechischslowakischen Zusammenarbeit im Exil während des Ersten Weltkrieges,” in Der Erste Weltkrieg, ed. Mommsen et al., 81–92Google Scholar. Masaryk's correspondence with the representatives of the American Slovaks (and with Beneš about them) is very interesting. His usage of “we” and “they” reveals that Masaryk thought of himself as a Czech (and not as the “Czechoslovak” he turned into after 1918), while there were severe limits to how far he would let the Slovaks influence his plans for the future of the country; see numerous examples of this in Hadler, , Weg von Österreich!Google Scholar\n\n28 See Hronský, Marián, “Obsadenie Bratislavy čs. vojskom na rozhraní rokov 1918–1919 a postoje mestského obyvatel'stva” (The occupation of Bratislava by the Czechoslovak army around New Year 1918–1919 and the attitude of the city's inhabitants), in Armáda, město, spoločnost' od 15. storočia do roku 1918 (Army, city, society from the fifteenth century until 1918), ed. Dangl, Vojtech and Varga, János J. (Bratislava, 2002)Google Scholar, for a very detailed account of the occupation.\n\nIn a memoir of the Czechoslovak occupation/liberation of Slovakia, Lt. Col. František Bartoš gave a wonderful account of the problems involved: “What was the order from Prague? Occupy Slovakia—no more and no less. Surely an enviable freedom, which first of all forced us to stake out our operational goals ourselves. So we took Slovakia in the size in which our patriot Kálal had dreamt of it and professor Niederle scientifically analyzed it.… [T]here is one thing I should not forget here, which may perhaps appear a trifle to any layman, but which has an enormous importance for every warfare, for even the smallest leader and which we missed: a map of Slovakia.” Quoted in Hronský, Marián, Boj o Slovensko a Trianon 1918–1920 (The struggle for Slovakia and Trianon 1918–1920) (Bratislava, 1998), 132.Google Scholar\n\n30 Author's retranslation of the Czech version of the interview. The reference to “Bratislava delegations” (delegací bratislavských) is undoubtedly a mistake. In January 1919, Masaryk did not yet use the term, which would also have made no sense to a British readership. Elsewhere the Czech text has Prěpurk. Masaryk, T. G., Cesta demokracie. Soubor projevů za republiky (The road of democracy: A collection of speeches from the time of the republic), vol. 1, 1918–1920 (Prague, 1939), 66Google Scholar. In the interview with the Deli Hirlap, Masaryk bordered on cynicism: “[W]hat concerns Pressburg, it basically belongs as little to you as to us, it is after all a German city. In spite of this we have more right to it than you do, as its surroundings are Slovak. We need the Danube” (ibid., 69–70). This passage then found its way into the Pressburg Slovak Robotnické noviny (Workers' newspaper) on 14 January. The article is printed in Horváth, Vladimír, Rákoš, Elemír, and Watzka, Jozef, eds., Bratislava, hlavné mesto Slovenska. Pripojenie Bratislavy k československej republike roku 1918–1919. Dokumenty (Bratislava, capital of Slovakia: The attachment of Bratislava to the Czechoslovak Republic 1918–1919. Documents) (Bratislava, 1977), 202.Google Scholar\n\nMasaryk offered the same key arguments for wanting the city—“Presburg proč chceme” (Why we want Pressburg)—in a letter to Beneš of 5 January 1919, making it clear that ethnographic arguments alone would be counterproductive; printed in Šolle, Zdeněk, Masaryk a Beneš ve svých dopisech z doby pařížských mírových jednání v roce 1919 (Masaryk and BeneŠ in their letters from the time of the Paris peace conferences in 1919), vol. 2 (Prague, 1994), 148Google Scholar. In January and February 1919, the Czechoslovak government prepared eleven memoranda for the peace conference, explaining the Czechoslovak demands. In the second memorandum, on the territorial demands of the Czechoslovak Republic, one finds the following description of Pressburg: “First of all, the city of Pressburg (Presbourg in the French original) itself has a special position. The majority of the population is indisputably German, although the city is on Hungarian territory. The Slovaks are in the minority compared to the Magyars and the Germans. But all suburbs and the surrounding countryside are Slovak. The city was for centuries a Slovak city. It has always been regarded as the capital of Slovakia.” Quoted from Raschhofer, Hermann, Die tschechoslowakischen Denkschriften für die Friedenskonferenz von Paris 1919/1920 (Berlin, 1937), 52Google Scholar. Still, in Paris, when asked in February 1919 by representatives of the Great Powers about the ethnic composition of Pressburg, Beneš replied, “Presbourg est une ville entièrement slovaque” (Pressburg is a totally Slovak city). Quoted in Romsics, , “Beneš and the Border,” 100.Google Scholar\n\n31 Salner, Peter, “Premenovanie mesta ako katalyzátor vzt'ahov medzi obyvatel'mi (Pozsony/Pressburg versus Bratislava)”Google Scholar (The renaming of the city as a catalyst in the relations between the inhabitants [Pozsony/Pressburg versus Bratislava]), in Slova města (Words of the city), Cahiers du CEFRES No. 18, ed. Uherek, Zdeněk and Bazac-Billaud, Laurent (Prague, 2000), 136–37Google Scholar. Salner writes here: “Without much hesitation or moral reservations the autochthonous inhabitants [of Bratislava] sacrificed their ethnic affiliation on the altar of the ever new and constantly changing values of the present powers that be. But they consistently persevered in their positive relations to the environment in which they had their roots.” The sudden regime change of 1918 thus led to mass conversions in declared nationality all over Slovakia, though less so in Bratislava than elsewhere. Compared with the 1910 census, the number of people declaring themselves to be Magyars fell from the extraordinary 30.3 percent in 1919 to 3.7 percent in Trnava, from 35.5 to 3.7 percent in Trenčín, from 52.8 to 17.7 percent in Nitra, and from 33.9 to 28.9 percent in Bratislava. Data from L'ubomír Lipták, “Elitenwechsel in der bürgerlichen Gesellschaft der Slowakei im ersten Drittel des 20. Jahrhunderts, ,” in Bürgertum und bürgerliche Gesellschaft in der Slowakei 1900–1939, ed. Mannová, Elena (Bratislava, 1997), 76.Google Scholar\n\n67 This was, as Lipták has convincingly shown, a long and in some ways still incomplete process, happening simultaneously with the establishment after 1920 of an understanding of “Slovakia” as a firmly defined territory. The national elites in Martin and elsewhere were skeptical of the choice of a city at the margin of this new territory, with a non-Slovak majority, and without any unequivocally Slovak past. Also, in strict terms the capital of Slovakia, as of all Czechoslovakia, was Prague. This fact and the centralism characterizing both interwar Czechoslovakia and the Communist regime (even after the federalization of the state in 1968, which made Bratislava the capital of the Slovak Socialist Republic) further hampered the establishment of Bratislava as the unconditional Slovak national center.
