        "text": "The first Jews living in what is today Hungarian territory were inhabitants of the Roman province of Pannonia and settled there in the 2nd century of the Common Era. Pannonia dispatched three legions to Judea in order to put an end to Bar Kochba's Jewish uprising from 132–135 C.E. The victorious troops brought Jewish slaves to Aquincum (today the northwestern part of Budapest) and Savaria (Szombathely). Apart from the slaves, Jewish merchants from Rome are also assumed to have travelled to Pannonia.\n\nWritten documents from the time of the formation of the Hungarian state prove the existence of Jewish communities. All of Hungary's medieval kings later endorsed the Jewish charter, which Béla IV had published in 1251. Despite the monarchy's protection, the nobles and church in Hungary still enacted numerous antisemitic laws against the Jewish population. In 1349, Jews were expelled from Hungary as a consequence of the Black Death, but they were able to return in 1364.\n\nLarge numbers of Jews moved to the growing Hungarian cities in the 15th century. The first \"historical communities\" there were formed at that time in Buda, Esztergom, Sopron, Tata, and Óbuda. After the annexation of Hungary by the Ottoman Turks in 1541, Jews in that country were able to practice their religion and participate actively in commerce. With an influx of Jewish immigration from Sephardim from Asia Minor, Buda became one of the major Jewish communities in the Ottoman Empire. Jews also settled in the city of Kecskemet in central Hungary.\n\nAfter Hungary became part of the Habsburg Empire in the late 17th century, Jews were subjected to anti-Semitic persecution and were prohibited from living in the major cities. Nevertheless, there was an influx of Jews from Poland and Moravia, and the Hungarian Jewish population grew from 11,600 in 1735 to 20,000 in 1769. Conditions for Hungarian Jews significantly improved during Joseph II's rule as Holy Roman Emperor (1740–1791) and as ruler of the Habsburg domains (1780–1791). The Emperor's 1782 Edict of Toleration, which granted Jews and followers of other minority religions more religious freedom, was the pinnacle of this advancement. By 1787, the Jewish population of Hungary had increased to around 81,000.\n\nThe 19th century was a time of assimilation and emancipation for many Hungarian Jews, who were granted increased civil rights. A small number of wealthy, urban families were the main representatives of Hungarian Jewry during that period. However, in the 1830s, poorer eastern European Jews began moving to the country in greater numbers. Many Hungarian Jews took part in the 1848–49 revolution, and their social and economic standing rose.\n\nIn 1867, Hungarian Jews were fully emancipated and were granted the same political and civil rights as their Christian compatriots. During that time, Jews were active in Hungarian commercial, financial, and cultural life. Religiously, this same period saw the birth of Reform Judaism in Hungary, with Hungarian used as the primary language for religious services in Reform synagogues.\n\nThe liberal atmosphere of the late 19th century led to assimilation, and, at the turn of the century, many Jews chose Hungarian or German spouses or had their children baptized as Christians. In successive years, Jews made enormous contributions to the development of Hungarian culture, science, and industry and played a particularly outstanding role in Hungarian sports. For example, in the first five Olympic Games, Jews accounted for five out of the nine gold medals awarded to Hungarian athletes. Even though the Shoah and the departure of survivors had severely reduced the Jewish population, Jews continued to make up over 20% of Hungarian gold medals from 1960 to 1972.\n\nIn terms of economic development, the Manfred Weiss Works, named for its Jewish founder, became the largest machine and ammunition factory in Hungary. The company eventually employed tens of thousands of workers at its vast plant in Csepel, Budapest, and exported its products all over the world.\n\nAfter the defeat and dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian Empire in World War I, Hungarian Jewry—including many members of the Orthodox and Chassidic communities—suddenly found themselves living within the borders of Czechoslovakia, Romania, or Yugoslavia. In 1919, when the short-lived Hungarian Soviet Republic (in which Hungarian Communists of Jewish origin were depicted as a foreign menace) collapsed, a period of \"White Terror\" ensued, during which some 3,000 Jews were murdered.\n\nIn the 1920s, the situation became more stable, but by the late 1930s, the first of a series of antisemitic laws was enacted, restricting the socioeconomic activities of Jews in Hungary.\n\nAccording to a 1941 census, 6.2 percent of the Hungarian population of 13,644,000, i.e., 846,000, were considered Jewish according to the racial laws in place at that time. Of these, 725,000 were classified as Jewish according to their religious affiliation: 184,000 in Budapest, 217,000 in the provinces that existed before 1938, and a total of 324,000 in the areas that were taken from neighboring nations and placed in Northern Transylvania, Carpatho-Ruthenia, southern Slovakia, and Bácska.\n\nLarge-scale deportation to the Nazi death camps began after German troops occupied Hungary in March 1944, but even though deportations began so late in the war, they were carried out with frightening speed. Up to 600,000 Jews from \"Greater Hungary\" perished in the Shoah.\n\nAfter the war, some 200 Jewish communities were reconstituted, but most dwindled rapidly due to migration to Budapest and emigration from the country. In 1946, anti-Jewish sentiment led to the pogroms in Kunmadaras, Miskolc, and elsewhere. Communist rule resulted in the closure of many Jewish institutions and the arrest of Jewish activists. Many Jews were expelled from Budapest but later allowed to return.\n\nDuring the 1956 uprising against Communist rule, 20,000 Jews opted to leave the country. However, the situation of Hungarian Jews began to improve in the late 1950s. The community was allowed to reestablish links with the Jewish world, and with the collapse of Communism, all restrictions on ties with Israel were also lifted.\n\nSince the fall of Communism, the Hungarian Jewish community has been active and committed religiously and culturally. Budapest has a Jewish Museum as well as a Jewish community center, theaters, bands, choirs, and a dance ensemble.\n\nFollowing the break-up of the Austro-Hungarian Empire and the short-lived 1919 Socialist-Communist regime in Hungary under the leadership of the Communist Bela Kun, Hungary was led for 24 years by a conservative authoritarian government under Admiral Miklos Horthy. Horthy himself considered himself an antisemite and was quoted as saying, “I have considered it intolerable that here in Hungary everything—every factory, bank, large fortune, business, theater, press, commerce, etc.—should be in Jewish hands, and that the Jew should be the image reflected of Hungary, especially abroad.” Still, Hungarian Jewry lived in relative security through the 1920s and most of the 1930s.\n\nBetween 1938 and 1941, Hungary’s Jewish population grew to an estimated 825,000, including some 100,000 converts to Christianity, as the result of Hungary’s annexation, with German and Italian support, of southern Slovakia and Subcarpathian Rus from Czechoslovakia in, respectively, 1938 and 1939, northern Transylvania from Romania in 1940, and the Backa region from what had been Yugoslavia in 1941. Between 1938 and 1941, the Horthy regime also enacted racial laws modelled on Germany’s Nuremberg Laws that reversed the emancipated status Hungarian Jews had enjoyed since 1867.\n\nAt the beginning of World War II, Jews were barred from serving in the Hungarian military, but male Jews were conscripted into forced labor battalions where they were subjected to such harsh treatment and conditions that 27,000 are estimated to have died prior to the German occupation of Hungary in March of 1944.\n\nIn 1941, the Hungarian government deported 20,000 non-Hungarian Jews to German-occupied Ukraine, where they were shot by the paramilitary SS Einsatzgruppen. The following year, Hungarian soldiers murdered some 3,000 Jews and Serbs in the formerly Yugoslav city of Novy Sad. However, the Horthy regime refused to hand Hungarian Jews over to the Nazis until March 1944, when Germany took over control of Hungary.\n\nIn April of 1944, approximately 500,000 Jews living outside of Budapest were forced to live in designated cities. Then, in less than two months beginning in mid-May of 1944, around 440,000 Jews were deported from Hungary to Auschwitz-Birkenau on more than 145 trains in what was the most effective and efficient such operation of the Holocaust. The vast majority of these Jews, around 320,000, were murdered immediately upon arrival at the death camp. In Budapest, meanwhile, the capital's Jewish population was herded into a ghetto and terrorized by Hungarian Arrow Cross gangs that murdered Jewish men, women, and children indiscriminately. Many Budapest Jews were taken to Germany on death marches, on which large numbers of them perished.\n\nIn the late spring and early summer of 1944, Gilel (or Hilel) Storch, the head of the Swedish Section of the World Jewish Congress, devised and financed a plan for a Swedish diplomat to undertake a rescue mission. With the support of the Swedish government and the US War Refugees Board, Raoul Wallenberg was recruited to travel to Budapest, where he provided certificates of protection and forged documents that saved the lives of thousands of Jews. Giorgio Perlasca, an Italian, and Carl Lutz, a Swiss diplomat posing as a Spanish official, carried out similar rescue missions in Budapest.\n\nOnly around 255,000 Jews, less than one-third of the 825,000 who had lived within enlarged Hungary in March of 1944, survived the Holocaust. Following negotiations with the Hungarian government in 1997, a law was passed establishing a restitution fund to compensate Hungarian Jews for a part of the value of assets seized from them during the Holocaust."
