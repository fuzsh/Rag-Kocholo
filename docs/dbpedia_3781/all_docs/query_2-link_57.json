        "text": "On the second day of the US president's visit to the Middle East, the reasons for the trip are preoccupying Israeli commentators, with one speculating that Mr Obama is playing for time because he does not know how to deal with the Iranian and Syrian problems.\n\nPalestinian and Arab writers are also largely pessimistic about the visit, with the Israeli Arab daily, Al-Ittihad, suggesting that Mr Obama's speech proves that the Palestinian cause has slipped to the bottom of the US agenda.\n\nNotwithstanding, a commentator in the daily Al-Ayyam believes his fellow Palestinians should not greet Mr Obama by throwing shoes at him.\n\nThe visit comes at a time when the United States is withdrawing from its deep involvement in the Middle East... Meanwhile, Obama has no answer to the Iranian problem, or to the disintegration of Syria... So he's playing for time by whispering sweet nothings of unconditional love and support into the ears of the Israeli people.\n\nLiving in a world in which there are those who have not exactly accepted our right or legitimacy to be here, having the most powerful man in the world come and give us a public bear hug is very important... he said the US had Israel's back. And that is a significant difference from when the two leaders first met in the White House four years ago.\n\nObama's speech, which was full of admiration for Netanyahu and his aggressive policy... expressed what America expects from the Israeli government: to fulfil its role in protecting US imperialist interests in the region. Both Israeli and American priorities are now clear; the emphasis on Iran and the situation in Syria place the Palestinian cause and the Israeli occupation at the bottom of their agenda.\n\nWe do not want anything from our guest but to examine the scene well. It doesn't require much effort to understand the truth behind it that it is not in line with truth, justice and beauty. It will remain unchanged as long as the occupation keeps dominating it with its darkness and injustice.\n\nWe do not think that US President Barack Obama is visiting the region for tourism and to enjoy seeing the churches of Bethlehem and Jerusalem... It is difficult to conclusively judge this tour and its outcome. But, what we can conclude is that it is a tour that is possibly aimed to prepare for war, whether against Iran or to overthrow the Syrian regime, or both.\n\nDespite the wide dreams of Palestinians and Arabs after the famous speech by Obama at Cairo University in 2009, these hopes have gradually evaporated until it almost reached the complete absence of the US from the Middle East peace process... Obama came to the region to improve his image in the eyes of the Jews of the Hebrew state; and not, as analysts say, for the sake of the region's peace."
