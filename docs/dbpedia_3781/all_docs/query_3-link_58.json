        "text": "RB Leipzig have confirmed the capture of 19-year-old attacker Antonio Nusa from Jupiler Pro League side Club Brugge.\n\nNusa, who was of interest to several Premier League sides in the January transfer window, has signed a five-year deal with the Bundesliga outfit.\n\nThe Norwegian made 46 appearances in all competitions last season, scoring four goals and helping the Blauw-Zwart to a 19th league title.\n\nHe takes the number seven shirt vacated by Dani Olmo following his reported £51m transfer to Barcelona after his impressive showings at Euro 2024.\n\nNusa is the second signing made by Die Roten Bullen from the Belgian top flight, with goalkeeper Maarten Vandevoordt arriving from Genk earlier in the window.\n\n\"I'm just incredibly proud to be at RB Leipzig and in the Bundesliga now. The club showed me a clear vision and a clear path, which totally convinced me,\" Nusa said.\n\n\"It's a big step for me, of course – but I'm ready for it. RB Leipzig has developed into one of the top clubs in Europe and is above all one of the top addresses for young players.\n\n\"It's just an outstanding feeling to be able to play there in front of over 45,000 fans in a few days.\"\n\nJulian Araujo has completed a permanent transfer to Bournemouth from Barcelona, the Cherries confirmed on Tuesday.\n\nAraujo, who spent last season on loan with La Liga side Las Palmas, arrives at the Vitality Stadium on a five-year deal for an undisclosed fee.\n\nThe 23-year-old failed to make a senior appearance for Barcelona after joining from La Galaxy last year, despite having made 98 MLS appearances.\n\nAraujo has also been capped 13 times by Mexico since his debut in 2021, but missed their group stage exit at this year's Copa America with a hamstring problem.\n\nHe missed 13 games during the league season through injury or suspension, with his impact on the Las Palmas squad felt in his absence.\n\nThe Spanish side managed to win just three games when Araujo was not in the side, while also scoring more goals (18) when he was in the right-back position.\n\nAraujo will also offer Andoni Iraola another attacking full-back option alongside Max Aarons, with his 11 successful crosses only bettered by Sergi Cardona (16) and Sandro Ramirez (24) in the Las Palmas side last season.\n\nChief Executive Neill Blake said of the transfer: “Julian is someone who we have tracked for a while now and we’re delighted to bring him to AFC Bournemouth.\n\n“He’s a young player with high potential and we’re pleased to have beaten lots of competition for his signature.\n\n“We believe that we have all the tools here for Julián to build on the quality he already has and we really look forward to welcoming him to Vitality Stadium.”\n\nHe becomes the Cherries' fifth senior summer signing and follows Dean Huijsen, Luis Sinisterra, Enes Unal and Alex Paulsen to the south coast.\n\nWayne Rooney described himself as \"angry\" after watching his Plymouth Argyle side begin their Championship campaign with a meek 4-0 defeat at Sheffield Wednesday.\n\nRooney's first competitive game at the helm was one to forget as Wednesday ran riot at Hillsborough, with Jamal Lowe, Josh Windass and Michael Smith among the scorers.\n\nThe Manchester United and England great has now recorded just two wins in his last 16 Championship games in charge of Birmingham City and Plymouth, drawing four and losing 10.\n\nSpeaking to Sky Sports in the aftermath of Sunday's defeat, he hit out at his players for failing to do the basics against a well-drilled Wednesday side.\n\n\"The scoreline was deserved. We conceded four goals from four crosses. The basics of the game were not there,\" Rooney said.\n\n\"We didn't take the ball well enough or handle the crowd. We allowed them to get a foothold in the game, and we let it run out and conceded two more goals.\n\n\"I'm disappointed and angry, because that's not the performance I wanted to see. We spoke about their threats from crosses.\n\n\"We spoke about Barry Bannan and we let him run the game and didn't get close enough to him. That wasn't acceptable.\n\n\"The players have to earn a right to play. You can lose football games, that happens, but there's a way you want to see your players run, work and tackle.\n\n\"We've had a lot of fans come a long way, and the performance we've given wasn't good enough. We have to make sure that doesn't happen again.\"\n\nWednesday racked up 30 shots totalling a huge 4.85 expected goals (xG) in Sunday's game, with 24 of those efforts coming from inside the Plymouth area.\n\nPlymouth, meanwhile, amassed just five attempts worth 0.31 xG, hitting the target once and only recording eight touches inside their hosts' box."
