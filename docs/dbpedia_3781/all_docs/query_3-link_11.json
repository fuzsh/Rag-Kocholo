        "text": "JEDDAH: Al-Ittihad have signed French-born Algerian international midfielder Houssem Aouar on a four-year contract.\n\nAouar joins from Roma, where he scored four goals in 16 appearances last season.\n\nThe 26-year-old midfielder previously played for hometown club Lyon in France’s Ligue 1, scoring 30 goals in seven seasons.\n\nThe signing ceremony took place at the team’s training camp in Alicante, Spain on Tuesday.\n\nThe event was officiated by the club’s CEO, Domingos Oliveira, and witnessed by sporting director Ramon Planes, following Aouar’s successful medical examination this morning.\n\nDomingos Oliveira expressed his warm welcome to Aouar, noting that this move marks a significant new chapter in Aouar’s career. He emphasized that Aouar will contribute significantly alongside his teammates to achieving the high standards and results anticipated by the club’s fans and supporters.\n\nOliveira highlighted that Aouar’s signing aligns with the team’s technical requirements for a player possessing specific qualities that enhance the squad. This strategy is based on the technical needs identified by the sports committee and reviewed by the coach.\n\nHoussem Aouar shared his enthusiasm about joining Al-Ittihad Club, recognizing its rich history, passionate fan base, distinguished players, and experienced coaching staff. He is motivated to deliver his best performance to represent the club and bring joy to its supporters.\n\nMANILA: Filipino gymnast Carlos Yulo, who won two gold medals in the Paris Olympics, flew home to a hero’s welcome Tuesday with a planned national tribute by the president and donors pledging more than $1 million worth of cash and gifts, including a resort house and free lunch buffets for life.\n\nThe 24-year-old’s wins in the men’s floor exercise and vault were the largest victory ever by a Filipino athlete since the Philippines joined the Games a century ago. Two Filipino boxers, Nesthy Petecio and Aira Villegas, won bronze medals in women’s boxing in Paris.\n\nThe euphoria over Yulo’s wins has provided a respite for a nation long ridden with poverty, deep divisions and conflicts.\n\n“Filipinos all over the world stood united, cheering and rooting for you,” Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. said after Yulo, fondly called Caloy by friends, captured his second Olympic gold. “No words can express how proud we are of you, Caloy. You have achieved GOLD for the Philippines, not once, but twice!”\n\nArriving in Manila, Yulo and the other Filipino athletes who participated in the Olympics were welcomed by flag-waving admirers who yelled his name, reached out for handshakes and took selfies. The athletes were met by their families before proceeding to the Malacanang palace, where Marcos would honor them with medals and cash gifts, officials said.\n\nCash and gifts pledged by the government, business tycoons and leading Philippine corporations for Yulo, including a condominium unit and a resort house south of Manila, would amount to more than 58 million pesos ($1 million). Prominent companies offered free pizzas, ice cream and lunch and dinner buffets for life.\n\nFilipino boxing legend Manny Pacquiao, who rose to global fame for winning titles in eight different weight classes and for his rags-to-riches life story, promised to reward Yulo with an unspecified amount of cash.\n\nA celebratory parade for Yulo and the other athletes on Wednesday along Manila’s main streets is expected to draw thousands of people. It will pass near a poor community where he grew up and first trained in gymnastics with his siblings in a public gym, where a coach first noticed the impressive skills of the then-7-year-old.\n\n“I’ll welcome him with a hug and we’ll jump together in joy,” Rodrigo Frisco, a 74-year-old relative, told The Associated Press in the neighborhood where the gold medalist has become a poster boy for hope. “Who would believe that these narrow alleys and small houses would produce a champion?”\n\nWeightlifter Hidilyn Diaz clinched the first-ever Olympic gold for the Philippines in Tokyo in 2021.\n\nRIYADH: Adidas has kicked off its partnership with Al-Nassr Football Club with the launch of the team’s new home jersey for the 2024-2025 season, ahead of the Saudi Super Cup clash with Al-Taawoun on Wednesday.\n\nThe new shirt features the club’s iconic yellow base with blue details and includes the slogan “Nassr runs in my blood.” It also has the palm tree and crossed-swords emblem, paying homage to Saudi Arabian culture.\n\nThe club’s CEO Guido Fienga said: “Al-Nassr is very proud to launch this new kit with adidas, a collaboration that not only pays homage to the rich history and legacy of our club but also showcases Al-Nassr as a global brand.\n\n“This kit embodies our dedication to excellence and our vision for the future, uniting our loyal fans worldwide.”\n\nThe new kits were unveiled with a film that pays tribute to the history of Al-Nassr and their fanbase, with a homage to legendary players known as the “The Golden Trio.”\n\nThe film features Cristiano Ronaldo, Marcelo Brozovic, Abdulrahman Ghareeb, Abdulelah Al-Amri, and Otavio Monteiro, along with the team’s women players Aseel Ahmed, Clara Luvanga and Lina Boussaha.\n\nThe film was shot in various locations around Riyadh and includes subtle references to the Kingdom’s footballing history.\n\nRIYADH: Victories for XSET in Fortnite, Xiao Hai for KSG in Street Fighter 6, and Wolves Esports in Teamfight Tactics saw each of the new champions enter the Esports World Cup Club Championship standings.\n\nThe three teams earned 1,000 points each to enter in joint sixth place. Saudi Arabia’s Team Falcons — who have 4,160 points — retain their lead at the top with just two weeks of competition remaining.\n\nKorean powerhouses T1, defeated 3-1 in the Teamfight Tactics final by their Chinese opponents, are in second spot after picking up 600 runners-up points to add to the 1,000 from their League of Legends triumph. Team Liquid, based in the Netherlands, are third on 1,485 points.\n\nThe world’s largest gaming and esports festival, which has a record-breaking industry prize pool of $60m, saw a total of $2.5 million presented to competitors at Boulevard Riyadh City during the sixth week of competition.\n\nStreet Fighter 6, held at the Qiddiyah Arena within the SEF Arena, saw Chinese player Xiao Hai weep with joy as he accepted the trophy and $300,000 from the tournament’s $1m prize fund.\n\nIn an all-American Fortnite final at the Amazon Arena, XSET beat Exceed 4-2 to lift the top prize of $400,000. Elsewhere, Wolves Esports claimed the main prize of $200,000 from the Teamfight Tactics $500,000 pool at the stc Arena.\n\nThe seventh week of EWC competition begins on Wednesday with StarCraft II. Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III and EA Sports FC 24 start on Thursday.\n\nALGIERS, Algeria: Olympic boxing champion Imane Khelif returned home to a warm welcome Monday as Algerians rallied around her in the face of international scrutiny and misconceptions about her sex.\n\nThe Algerian gold medalist in women’s welterweight boxing flew back to the gas-rich North African nation’s capital Monday afternoon along with other Olympic medalists, including gymnast Kaylia Nemour and runner Djamel Sedjati.\n\nThey were greeted in Algiers by Minister of Youth and Sports Abderrahmane Hammad and were scheduled to meet President Abdelmadjid Tebboune later this week, according to APS, the nation’s public press service.\n\n“It’s a dream I had for eight years,” Khelif said of her gold medal performance. “We did our best to represent Algeria.”\n\nKhelif became a top storyline of the 2024 Paris Olympic Games after Italian boxer Angela Carini withdrew 46 seconds into their matchup, wept and refused to shake Khelif’s hand, saying she had never been hit so hard by a punch. Afterward, scrutiny toward Khelif exploded as people — including world leaders and celebrities — questioned her eligibility or falsely claimed she was a man.\n\nAlgerians vigorously defended Khelif amid uninformed speculation about her sex, which they interpreted as a byproduct of racism. They loudly made their presence known both in Paris and Algeria, where the gold medal fight was broadcast in public squares throughout the country.\n\nSedjati, the bronze medalist in the men’s 800 meters, said Nemour and Khelif’s success would “give a boost to women’s sports in our country.”\n\nTORONTO: Jessica Pegula, the No. 3 seed and the sixth-ranked WTA Tour player, defended her National Bank Open women’s singles title by defeating Amanda Anisimova 6-3, 2-6, 6-1 in Monday’s all-American final.\n\nPegula, from nearby Buffalo, New York, won last year’s National Bank Open in Montreal and improved her all-time record at the Canadian tennis championship to 17-2 in picking up the sixth tournament victory of her career.\n\nAnisimova, who entered the week ranked No. 132 in the world as she continues her comeback after stepping away from the game for a mental health break, beat three top-20 players in Toronto, including No. 3 Aryna Sabalenka in the quarterfinals.\n\nMonday’s showdown marked just the second time the final of a WTA 1000 event — one step below the sport’s four Grand Slams — has featured two Americans since the format was first introduced in 2009, with the only other instance coming in 2016 when Serena Williams defeated Madison Keys in Rome.\n\nPegula, who improved to 3-0 against Anisimova after also topping her on clay earlier this season, beat Liudmila Samsonova in last year’s final.\n\nThe 30-year-old picked up a break in the first game and led 5-3 when Anisimova double-faulted to go down a set.\n\nAnisimova trailed love-40 in the second set before battling back to hold and then broke Pegula to go up 2-1 following a long rally.\n\nThe 22-year-old former French Open semifinalist then pushed ahead 5-2 with another break when Pegula committed a double fault before holding serve to hand Pegula her first dropped set of the tournament.\n\nMonday marked the first time two American women have played for Canada’s national championship since Serena Williams defeated Jennifer Capriati in 2001.\n\nPegula is the first player to register 10 consecutive wins in women’s singles at the Canadian Open since Serena Williams put up 14 wins from 2011 to 2014."
