        "text": "Maybe because he was only a year into a 5 year contract? I’m not that clued up with how that factors into what fees a club can command. Still mental though.\n\nAlso, what a thoroughly disturbing video.\n\nPossibly JR, granted I watch nothing of them outside a Rangers game and while he’s chipped in with a few goals there was far better players in their team.\n\nVery murky, Celtic are part of some sort of City Group FFP laundering shenanigans\n\nNext move will be Celtic signing City 2nd string / squad players for £10m fees - washing City's cash for them\n\n(They have previous for this - this is how the Arzani, Patrick Roberts etc deals were set up)\n\nThere was also a centre half and the deal was a bit fishy. Liewell Jnr and Snr have their dirty fingers all over it.\n\nMate, they’ve doubled their money after 12 months even taking that into account.\n\nIt’s what we need to be doing rather than letting players walk out the door for free.\n\nI hate those cunts but let’s not make up shite when they’re doing what we want to do.\n\nLike I mentioned above see Bassey and Patterson. We made more profit on both of those players than they just have.\n\nGranted it was ridiculous letting Morelos and Kent go for free but we're nowhere as bad at this as is being made out.\n\nBe interesting to see if they use most of the Jota money to buy a City fringe/youth player at a vastly inflated price.\n\nThey've been linked with the youth player Borges by coincidence over the last few days.\n\nIf something like this happens Uefa should be all over it pronto.\n\nI wonder how 'money washing' works?\n\nWhat do the City group have to do with it? Is it not the Saudi government that is funding all these deals to enhance the league?\n\nThe City group have their claws into a number of European clubs already I'd be surprised if it wasn't the same in the middle east especially with all the oil money and corruption over there.\n\nJust seems rather strange that a wee fud like Jota with no international caps is getting paid £50,000 a week more than the average Manchester City player who are the best club side in the world at the minute.\n\nIf money goes directly from the middle east to Celtic then to City it's got dodgy written all over it.\n\nThe City group have their claws into a number of European clubs already I'd be surprised if it wasn't the same in the middle east especially with all the oil money and corruption over there.\n\nJust seems rather strange that a wee fud like Jota with no international caps is getting paid £50,000 a week more than the average Manchester City player who are the best club side in the world at the minute.\n\nIf money goes directly from the middle east to Celtic then to City it's got dodgy written all over it.\n\nI think you are looking for conspiracies when there isn’t any tbh.\n\nThe city group is made up of folk from Abu Dhabi, USA and China.\n\nThe City group have their claws into a number of European clubs already I'd be surprised if it wasn't the same in the middle east especially with all the oil money and corruption over there.\n\nJust seems rather strange that a wee fud like Jota with no international caps is getting paid £50,000 a week more than the average Manchester City player who are the best club side in the world at the minute.\n\nIf money goes directly from the middle east to Celtic then to City it's got dodgy written all over it.\n\nThere's definitely something very dodgy there imo. We know that FIFA will do %^*& all about it because they're part of the whole corrupt cabal.\n\nThe only way corruption of this kind could be brought into the public glare imo would be investigative reporting from the kind of journalists who released the Panama Papers. The International Consortium of Investigative Journalists are the folk who dug that stuff up.\n\nUnfortunately they'll have far bigger fish to fry so this shit will all continue on unimpeded. The authorities certainly won't be asking any questions.\n\nMate, they’ve doubled their money after 12 months even taking that into account.\n\nIt’s what we need to be doing rather than letting players walk out the door for free.\n\nI hate those cunts but let’s not make up shite when they’re doing what we want to do.\n\nThis morning news from the piggery another of their Japanese imports signed up for four years. The guy will never see out his contact. It’s transfer money\n\nCan't find that anywhere online.\n\nJust figured it is, maybe I'm wrong, it makes sense though.\n\nJota is the joker card in the video, know that because he's the only one with the name written, as a joker would traditionally have. 'Joker' in Arabic when referring to the card is 'jukar', pronounced as Jota in their accent. Google translate 'joker card' and click the voice option and you'll hear it, even with a computer voice.\n\nJust figured it is, maybe I'm wrong, it makes sense though.\n\nJota is the joker card in the video, know that because he's the only one with the name written, as a joker would traditionally have.
