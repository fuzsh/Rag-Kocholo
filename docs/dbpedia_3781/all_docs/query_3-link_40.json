        "text": "After a summer of speculation over Manchester City legend Kevin De Bruyne, it appears that the Belgian international is set to remain at the club for the 24/25 season. A new report indicates that Al-Ittihad has withdrawn from the race to sign the midfielder. With the 24/25 season only weeks away that is welcome news for the Premier League champions.\n\nJournalist Rudy Galleti has reported via X that Al-Ittihad has withdrawn from the race to sign De Bruyne this summer. Galetti further reports that Al-Ittihad considers the demands from Manchester City to sign De Bruyne to be too high. Furthermore, Galetti adds that with De Bruyne only having a year to run on his contract has also played a factor in Al-Ittihad’s decision.\n\nManchester City legend Kevin De Bruyne looks set for a key role with Pep Guardiola’s side once again next season.\n\nIt would now appear that Kevin De Bruyne is set to play a key role for Manchester City next season. Based on Rudy Galleti’s new report there doesn’t appear to be any suitors left to sign De Bruyne this summer. That is fantastic news for the world champions. De Bruyne will have a key role to play next season as Manchester City chase silverware on multiple fronts next season. Despite getting on in age De Bruyne is still a bonafide match-winner for Pep Guardiola’s side. That was evident during the 23/24 season and there is no reason why De Bruyne can’t carry that form into next season.\n\nRudy Galleti’s report also links up with Pep Guardiola’s comments earlier this week. Before Manchester City’s friendly against Barcelona the City manager was asked about De Bruyne’s future. He told the media: “The club informed me that they didn’t have an offer. I don’t know what will happen but I want him to stay. He was here before I arrived. He is the eldest (longest-serving) player here. It happened with David for example and other players, he has the credit to decide his future himself. What he has done for us is massive so he can decide. The information I have now is he will stay.”\n\nIt now appears that Pep Guardiola and Manchester City fans will get their wish and that Kevin De Bruyne will remain at the club for next season. The time will come when the Manchester City legend will depart the club. As Pep Guardiola said earlier this week De Bruyne has more than earned the right to decide how and when he leaves a club he helped guide to an era of unprecedented success. Based on Galetti’s new report that possibility is at least another season away."
