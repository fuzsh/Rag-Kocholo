        "text": "Commission caps\n\nFor life insurance products with a savings component, Peter Hodgins of Clyde & Co said different caps apply to the saving and protection elements:\n\n• For the saving component, a cap of 4.5 per cent of the annualised premium per year (which may not exceed 90 per cent of the annualised premium over the policy term).\n\n• On the protection component, there is a cap of 10 per cent of the annualised premium per year (which may not exceed 160 per cent of the annualised premium over the policy term).\n\n• Indemnity commission, the amount of commission that can be advanced to a product salesperson, can be 50 per cent of the annualised premium for the first year or 50 per cent of the total commissions on the policy calculated.\n\n• The remaining commission after deduction of the indemnity commission is paid equally over the premium payment term.\n\n• For pure protection products, which only offer a life insurance component, the maximum commission will be 10 per cent of the annualised premium multiplied by the length of the policy in years.\n\nDisclosure\n\nCustomers must now be provided with a full illustration of the product they are buying to ensure they understand the potential returns on savings products as well as the effects of any charges. There is also a “free-look” period of 30 days, where insurers must provide a full refund if the buyer wishes to cancel the policy.\n\n“The illustration should provide for at least two scenarios to illustrate the performance of the product,” said Mr Hodgins. “All illustrations are required to be signed by the customer.”\n\nAnother illustration must outline surrender charges to ensure they understand the costs of exiting a fixed-term product early.\n\nIllustrations must also be kept updatedand insurers must provide information on the top five investment funds available annually, including at least five years' performance data.\n\n“This may be segregated based on the risk appetite of the customer (in which case, the top five funds for each segment must be provided),” said Mr Hodgins.\n\nProduct providers must also disclose the ratio of protection benefit to savings benefits. If a protection benefit ratio is less than 10 per cent \"the product must carry a warning stating that it has limited or no protection benefit\" Mr Hodgins added."
