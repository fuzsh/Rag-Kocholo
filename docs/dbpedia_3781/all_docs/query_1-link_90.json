        "text": "Benzema has left Real Madrid after 14 years\n\nAl-Ittihad move has finally been confirmed\n\nForward set to battle it out with Ronaldo for titles\n\nWHAT HAPPENED? Benzema has long been linked with a big-money move to the Middle East and said farewell to Real Madrid on Tuesday. He has now been unveiled as an Al-Ittihad player. The France international is understood to have signed a two-year contract with an option for a further year, which is set to pocket him a staggering €200 million (£172m/$213m) per season.\n\nTHE BIGGER PICTURE: For the majority of the season, Benzema had been expected to extend his Madrid contract, which expires this summer. However, in the end he opted to follow former team-mate Cristiano Ronaldo to Saudi Arabia, with the pair poised to battle it out for the title next season.\n\nWHAT THEY SAID: \"I am excited to see you in Jeddah,\" Benzema said in a video posted on Al-Ittihad's social media channels. \"Al-Ittihad is a new challenge for me. It's a good league and there are many good players. Cristiano Ronaldo is already here, he is a friend who shows that Saudi Arabia is starting to get ahead and I am here to win as I did in Europe.\"\n\nIN A VIDEO:"
