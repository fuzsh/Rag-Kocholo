        "text": "Scorers: Diaby 25', 47'\n\nMoussa Diaby continued his strong start to life with Al-Ittihad as he scored twice to condemn Serie A champions Inter to pre-season defeat.\n\nThe French winger, who arrived from Aston Villa this summer, had already opened his account for the Saudi side in a defeat to Sevilla, but netted either side of half-time against the Nerazzurri to help his side emerge victorious in the U-power Stadium.\n\nSimone Inzaghi named a strong Inter side for the clash, including Niccolo Barella, Hakan Calhanoglu and Federico DiMarco for the penultimate game of his side's pre-season campaign.\n\nBut despite dominating the ball in the early stages, misses from the Inter forwards meant that they couldn't find a breakthrough and they were punished by a clinical Diaby, who grabbed his first goal just before the half hour mark.\n\nRunning beyond Inter's backline, the Frenchman provided a clinical low finish from a tight angle to hand his side the lead.\n\nJust after half time, he struck again, burying the rebound after an Ahmed Al Ghamdi effort was parried out by Yann Sommer.\n\nInter continued to be wasteful, firing off seven efforts in response but failing to hit the target once in the second half as they looked a yard off the pace ahead of the Serie A season kicking off in 10 days time.\n\nA bad evening was compounded by an injury to Stefan de Vrij in the final minutes of the game, which left the Serie A champions down to 10 men and sweating on his fitness for their next game."
