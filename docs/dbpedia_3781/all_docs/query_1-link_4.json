Its slogan was, “In the name of the Arabs we live, and in the name of the Arabs we die”. The owner and editor-in-chief of the newspaper was Salim 'Abd al-Rahman al-Hajj Ibrahim, a leader of the national movement and a supporter of the Arab revolution. Al-Ittihad Al-'Arabi continued to publish until 1927, when it stopped publishing due to the economic crisis that hit the country at the time."
