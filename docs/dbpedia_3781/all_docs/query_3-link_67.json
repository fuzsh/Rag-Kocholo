        "text": "David Alaba has been dealing with fitness issues this season\n\nDavid Alaba has had a challenging season thus far. The Austrian had been expected to take the lead in leading Real Madrid’s defence when Eder Militao suffered a major knee injury at the beginning of the season, but he has gone the other way.\n\nThis season, Alaba has been responsible for multiple goals, which has raised doubts about his starting position. After a marked performance improvement, Antonio Rudiger may be the clear choice to be Militao’s long-term partner when the German player returns.\n\nThis could indicate that Real Madrid is looking to offload Alaba, and the defender has an asking price of €60 million, according to Sport. Al Ittihad, Juventus, and Manchester United are all showing interest in it.\n\nAlaba’s exit would make it easy for Real Madrid to acquire a younger centre-back, who has been connected to the team over the next several years. A sale might be thwarted, though, since the 31-year-old has little interest in leaving the club at this time.\n\nDespite his struggles with fitness lately, Alaba has made ten games across all competitions. He has returned for the team’s previous two league matches against Barcelona and Sevilla.\n\nTop four players with most goals in 2023\n\nList of unwanted records Manchester United have broken under Erik ten Hag this season\n\nUEFA Champions League 2024-25 new group stage format: Explained\n\nReal Madrid’s all-time top 10 goalscorers in Champions League history\n\nAFCON 2023: List of all host cities & venue\n\nBallon d’Or 2024: Ranking the top five favourites as of December 2023\n\nThe Austrian’s contract at Bernabeu is set to expire in three more years, but there has been fresh talk over his future, with Saudi Arabian teams reportedly expressing interest.\n\nAccording to the source, there were some reservations about Alaba’s displays this season. However, Los Blancos, who also have Antonio Rudiger and Eder Militao, have three excellent centre-backs competing for two spots.\n\nThe deal for reserve player Alaba ends in the summer of 2026. It is still to be seen if a team makes a strong bid to acquire the Real Madrid player.\n\nMeanwhile, Los Blancos have been connected to several young defenders. Malick Thiaw (22) of AC Milan and Ousmane Diomande (19) are both rumoured to be on the Spanish powerhouses’ radars, but Thiaw is supposedly keen on sticking with the Serie A powerhouses for the time being."
