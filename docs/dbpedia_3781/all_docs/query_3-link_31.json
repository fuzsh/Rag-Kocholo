        "text": "An Al-Ittihad player appeared to be whipped by a fan following his side's defeat Al-Hilal in the Saudi Super Cup final.\n\nAl-Hilal lifted the trophy after beating their rivals 4-1 thanks to a brace from former Barcelona forward Malcom and goals from Salem Aldawasari and Nasser Aldawasari. Abderrazak Hamdallah was on target for Al-Ittihad, but the forward was on the receiving end of one fan's anger after the game.\n\nAs Al-Hilal celebrated their victory, Hamdallah was targeted by the supporter and responded by squirting water from his water bottle in the man's direction. The fan then remarkably pulled out a whip and swung it at the forward.\n\nHamdallah's teammates quickly rushed over to intervene, while another fan dragged the man with the whip away before security got involved. Hamdallah has been at Al-Ittihad since 2021, having signed from fellow Saudi club Al-Nassr after stints in Norway, China and Qatar.\n\nAl-Hilal, meanwhile, are in with a chance of lifting an unprecedented four trophies this season with Jorge Jesus' side 12 points clear at the top of the Saudi Pro League and also in the semi-finals of the Asian Champions League and the Saudi King's Cup.\n\nReflecting on their Saudi Super Cup win, Malcom said: \"It was a difficult game and I am very happy to score two goals. We are also happy to collect our first title of the season but we are chasing more trophies.\"\n\nTheir victory in the final came just three days after a dramatic semi-final clash against Al-Nassr, which saw Cristiano Ronaldo sent off in a 2-1 win for Al-Hilal. Ronaldo was shown a red card after appearing to elbow Ali Al-Bulayhi, with Jesus suggesting the 39-year-old's actions were down to the fact he is \"not used to losing\".\n\n\"Ronaldo is one of the most important players in the world and an example for many,\" Jesus told reporters after the game. \"But he's not used to losing in his career, so it is natural for him to lose his head when he loses, as well as for him to lose emotional and mental focus in defeats.\n\n\"It's not easy to play against [Kalidou] Koulibaly and Al-Bulayhi, they are the best central defenders in Saudi football. I'm not going to take credit away from Ronaldo, he's still very strong, he always has been and will continue to be the most important player in the world, he's an example and a model.\""
