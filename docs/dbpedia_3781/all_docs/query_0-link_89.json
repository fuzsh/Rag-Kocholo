        "text": "The bell tolls for Arabic print news. As the COVID-19 pandemic washes over the Middle East, Arab daily newspapers suffer curfews, collapsing ad income, and bans on print publication.\n\nFor newspapers that were already struggling for relevance in a media landscape shaped by authoritarian rule and rapid digitalization, the pandemic may prove the last straw. In the words of one Iraqi journalist, “The corona pandemic has completed the war on daily print news that was begun by online journalism.”\n\nThe decline of print news marks a major transition in the Arab media landscape—a shift underway in the rest of the world, too. It is not primarily a political shift, but it will have political effects.\n\nAlthough its political and economic conditions vary greatly from one country to the next, Arab print media has by and large been no less monitored and controlled than radio and television. Whether under direct state ownership or subtle state pressure, newspapers have often functioned as megaphones for the Arab world’s ruling elites. The dearth of independent, critical journalism with political clout is a major part of the explanation for the weakness of Arab print news. Put simply, it’s hard to keep readers interested in a product that, at the end of the day, doesn’t matter to their lives.\n\nEven so, Arab newspapers deserve attention—not merely for their role or lack thereof in politics, but also as forums for the discussion of local culture, literature, and history, and for having played nation-building roles in a region filled with young, postcolonial states. And nostalgia aside, the decline of the printed press and the rise of digital media signal a fundamental change in the interplay between information and political mobilization. The full impact of this change is only beginning to become clear, but humanity’s headlong dive into online politics is both transformative and profoundly destabilizing, as evidenced by events as disparate as the 2011 Arab uprisings, Brexit, and the election of Donald Trump.\n\nBased on interviews with Arab journalists and academics and on a survey of recent reporting in Arabic-language media, this report looks at the state of the printed press in the Arab world and the impact of COVID-19.\n\nJournalism without Press Freedom\n\nBeing an Arab journalist was never easy or free of risk, in a region often described as the least democratic part of the world. Most Arab newspapers have always operated under the thumb of autocratic regimes, although conditions have differed from country to country and, of course, over time.\n\nIn the 2020 edition of its yearly rating of global press freedom, Reporters Without Borders awarded Tunisia the best score of any Arab nation, which still meant a mediocre seventy-second place in the world. From there, it was a steep drop down to the super-repressive regimes that crowd the bottom ranks of the list, such as Saudi Arabia (170) and Syria (174).\n\nArab nations in the RSF press freedom ranking (2019–2020) (1: Norway. 180: North Korea.) Tunisia 72 Mauritania 97 Lebanon 102 Kuwait 109 Jordan 128 Qatar 130 United Arab Emirates 131 Morocco/Western Sahara 133 Oman 135 Palestine 137 Algeria 146 Sudan 159 Iraq 162 Libya 164 Egypt 166 Yemen 167 Bahrain 169 Saudi Arabia 170 Syria 174 Source: “Index Details: Data of Press Freedom Ranking 2020,” Reporters Without Borders (RSF), https://rsf.org/en/ranking_table.\n\nArab governments typically publish one or more state-owned daily newspapers, which, in the most flagrantly authoritarian nations, can look and read like Soviet propaganda sheets. Examples of this sad genre include the Syrian Ministry of Information’s two national dailies, Al-Thawra and Tishreen, and the semi-governmental Al-Ba’ath. All three are drab, un-journalistic compilations of government propaganda, which have remained in circulation only because they are supported by the state and distributed to government offices. “People used to buy them for the crosswords or to clean the windshields of their car,” recalled Syrian freelance journalist Rajaai Bourhan.\n\nEgypt, where the state publishes no less than four print dailies, offers an example of a government-run newspaper of greater stature: the nation’s flagship daily Al-Ahram. Although it is unswervingly loyal to Egypt’s rulers, Al-Ahram’s nearly 150-year history has made it into something of a national institution—a chronicler of Egyptian history as much as it is a purveyor of regime politics. Between 1957 and 1974, the influential political journalist Mohammed Hassanein Heikal (1923–2016) served as Al-Ahram’s editor in chief, and over the years it has published many of Egypt’s greatest minds, such as the pioneering public intellectual Taha Hussein (1889–1973) and Naguib Mahfouz (1911–2006), the Nobel Prize-winning author.\n\nBut although Egypt helped pioneer the Arab newspaper business, it is now a decidedly hostile environment for independent journalism. The lively, critically minded press that grew in the last decade of President Hosni Mubarak’s rule and flowered after the 2011 Arab uprisings was smothered by President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi’s 2013 coup d’état. Most of Egypt’s media now marches in lockstep with the government, or self-censors to avoid trouble in a climate of intolerant, paranoid nationalism. If a newspaper fails to demonstrate the expected obsequiousness, the state is always ready to intervene. In 2018, for example, a court seized the private Cairo daily Al Mesryoon and transferred editorial control to Akhbar el-Yom, a state-run newspaper.\n\nTo be sure, flickers of independence remain in Egyptian media. But if citizens are looking for meaningful, critical investigations of their government’s conduct, they must turn away from print and go online—for example, to Mada Masr, a small journalists’ collective whose daredevil muckraking has triggered repeated police raids, including the detention of its editor in chief on May 17.\n\nDemocratic Tunisia stands in sharp contrast to authoritarian black holes like Syria, Egypt, and Saudi Arabia, but several other Arab nations also offer a significant measure of free expression. Algeria, Iraq, Kuwait, Lebanon, Mauritania, and Morocco are home to a variety of media outlets, including newspapers that can challenge each other and, to some extent, their governments. While these papers are sometimes mere mouthpieces of political parties or sectoral elites, competitive special interests can still produce meaningful diversity in reporting.\n\nHowever, even in these countries, freedom of expression is curtailed, and journalism can be a dangerous career choice. There is trouble in store for Algerian journalists who get in the way of their country’s corrupt military elite, or for Moroccans who dare criticize King Mohammed VI or Morocco’s occupation of Western Sahara. Religion also tends to be a very touchy subject across the region. Irreverent discussions of Islam are not just frowned upon but often also legally prosecutable and at risk of a violent public backlash.\n\nConflicts, too, can threaten the freedom of the press and, even more, undermine the practical viability of print publishing. Yemen’s once surprisingly vital news press has been decimated by violence and repression in recent years. Although Syria managed to keep progovernment dailies on the newsstands until the COVID-19 crisis, most attempts to launch print publications in rebel-held areas have fizzled. In Libya, new publications mushroomed after the ouster of Muammar Qaddafi in 2011, but the ensuing chaos has dramatically weakened the printed press.\n\nThe Pan-Arab Dailies\n\nAlthough there are numerous spoken dialects of Arabic, not all of which translate smoothly from one region to the next, language continues to unite the Arab world in meaningful ways. A standardized form of literary Arabic is used all over the region in official settings and in the media, and it continues to be read, written, understood, and to some degree spoken from Mauritania to Oman, and from Syria to Sudan. As a result, Arabic-language newspapers have the potential to attract readers from several countries, as long as they can weave their way past the accompanying financial, logistical, and political hurdles.\n\nSince the late 1970s, a handful of Arabic-language newspapers have set up shop in London, establishing the city as an unlikely hub in Middle Eastern journalism. Expat publicists from Lebanon or the Palestinian refugee diaspora often spearheaded the creation of these newspapers, but they mostly had to rely on wealthy oil regimes for funding. That, of course, has left its mark on their politics.\n\nThe first regional daily to begin publishing in London was Al-Arab, founded in 1977 by a former Libyan minister of information, Ahmed Salihin al-Houni. Given its origins and that it tended to “reflect official Libyan views,” the paper was, in the first decades of its existence, widely assumed to be funded by Qaddafi’s regime. The current leadership includes Mohammed al-Houni, the founder’s son, and Heitham al-Zubeidi, an Iraqi. Exactly who funds Al-Arab these days is unclear, but the paper’s fervent support for the United Arab Emirates might provide clues.\n\nAl-Arab may have been first on the London scene, but it was always small fry compared to the two most important pan-Arab newspapers: Asharq Al-Awsat and Al-Hayat, both of which have been generously bankrolled by Saudi royalty.\n\nEasy to spot on newspaper racks for its emerald-green cover, Asharq Al-Awsat has reportedly enjoyed the greatest circulation figures of all the pan-Arab dailies, and it is printed each day in fourteen cities on four continents. Launched in London in 1978, it is owned by the Saudi Research and Marketing Group (SRMG), a Riyadh-based media conglomerate that controls several other publications, such as the English-language Arab News. From the start, SRMG has been under the effective control of Saudi Arabia’s current king, Salman bin Abdulaziz, and his family, including Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. Three other sons of the king—the princes Ahmed, Faisal, and Turki bin Salman—have served as SRMG chairmen over the years.\n\nFor its part, Al-Hayat answered to Prince Khaled bin Sultan, the son of Saudi Arabia’s late minister of defense, Sultan bin Abdulaziz (1928–2011). While its circulation figures may have been less than those of Asharq Al-Awsat, Al-Hayat also long enjoyed a powerful presence on the pan-Arab media scene, and was arguably the more prestigious of the two papers.\n\nSaudi Arabia’s rival, Qatar, exerts great influence through Al Jazeera, a Doha-based satellite television network started in the mid-1990s, but it historically held a much smaller stake in print media. In recent years, that has changed.\n\nIt was reportedly Qatari moneymen who stepped in to save Al-Quds Al-Arabi in 2013. Launched under Palestinian leadership in 1989, this populist-nationalist daily struggled financially for years as it waged a lonely press insurgency against its Saudi-backed competitors. The Palestine Liberation Organization, Sudan, Iraq, “independently wealthy Palestinians,” and Qatar were all rumored to have offered support during its first decade, though the paper’s “threadbare” editorial operation hinted at a lack of consistent patronage. The 2013 rescue operation allegedly came at the cost of editorial control, and it triggered the resignation of Al-Quds Al-Arabi’s pugnacious editor in chief, Abdel Bari Atwan.\n\nQatar’s financial muscle was also behind the 2014 launch of Al-Araby Al-Jadeed, a rare new investment in the newspaper world spearheaded by the Doha-based Palestinian intellectual Azmi Bishara. It is also headquartered in London.\n\nAlthough the London-based dailies were, at their peak, widely read by Arab intellectual and political elites, none of the papers ever achieved a mass circulation remotely comparable to top Western newspapers.\n\nAlthough the London-based dailies were, at their peak, widely read by Arab intellectual and political elites, none of the papers ever achieved a mass circulation remotely comparable to the major U.S., British, or French newspapers. In 2003, William Rugh estimated that Asharq Al-Awsat likely sold no more than 60,000 copies all over the world, trailed by Al-Hayat at 40,000 and by Al-Quds Al-Arabi and Al-Arab at 15,000 and 10,000, respectively. By way of comparison, The New York Times sold more than 1.13 million copies on an average weekday in 2003–4. A separate estimate published by the Arab Reform Bulletin in 2004 arrived at higher numbers for Asharq Al-Awsat (close to 235,000) and Al-Hayat (160,000–170,000), yet these figures paled in comparison with the Arab world’s top national dailies, such as Egypt’s Al-Ahram (900,000), Algeria’s El Khabar (400,000), and the Khartoum-based Al-Sudani (305,000).\n\nNoha Mellor, a professor of media at the University of Bedfordshire, wrote in an email that the pan-Arab papers’ self-reported circulation figures have always been unreliable and exaggerated, especially given that “such papers usually sell in limited numbers in individual Arab countries, where local papers tend to be more popular.” However, she noted that the London dailies have nevertheless remained valuable to their funders over the years, since “the pan-Arab media market (whether print or television) is one important tool in the regional rivalry.”\n\nA Changing Media Environment\n\nFor the better part of the past two decades, print news has been in decline in the Arab world, just as it has been elsewhere. While that is in large part due to global technological shifts, such as the rise of television, satellite broadcasts, and then online publishing, some of it also has to do with how authoritarian rule has stunted the development of Arab journalism.\n\nArab newspapers had “essentially lost credibility” with their readers around the turn of the century “because they were seen to be either propaganda arms of the government or propaganda arms of political groups,” said Rami G. Khouri, a Jordanian-Palestinian professor of journalism at the American University of Beirut. “They continued to publish—like Al-Hayat, Asharq Al-Awsat, An-Nahar, Al-Ahram, whatever, all over the region—but they were just a shadow of their former selves.”\n\nThe rise of satellite television and digitalization then dealt further blows to the printed press, by peeling away readers and advertising revenue.\n\nFor example, Oxford Business Group, a research and consultancy firm, has estimated that Saudi Arabia’s national print market revenues peaked at $506.8 million in 2006. Ten years later, that sum had fallen to $205.9 million. Circulation figures also seem to have declined dramatically. In July 2019, the Saudi national distribution company decided to stop newspaper sales in several of the kingdom’s provinces, arguing that it was no longer economically viable.\n\nPolling by the Doha branch of Northwestern University has shown that in 2013, 42 percent of interviewees in seven Arab countries said they regularly read a newspaper, but in 2019 that number had dropped to 16 percent. In 2019, 68 percent of respondents were reading news online, and 60 percent found news on social media. The polling data also made clear that the region’s acculturation to free online and television media has been quick and thorough, subverting the economic basis of independent, self-funding news reporting. Of those questioned in 2019, only 8–15 percent said they would consider paying for journalism in any medium whatsoever.\n\n“The printed press in the Arab world is suffering just like everywhere in the world,” wrote Monalisa Freiha, an associate editor with Lebanon’s An-Nahar, in a text message:\n\nIn Egypt, the leading newspaper Al-Ahram is going through difficult times, as well as Al Ra’i in Jordan, since advertisers are more inclined to use online platforms for their ads. In the Gulf, Twitter is becoming the main source of information. As for Lebanon, the problem is bigger, since the newspapers are not financed by the state, and with the economic crisis the papers are shutting their publication one after another. The digitalization as well as the economic crisis are putting the printed press in the Arab world in front of an existential threat.\n\nAlthough most Arab print newspapers are also published on the Internet, few if any have successfully monetized online publication through subscriptions and paywalls. Reasons may include having too few readers who are willing or able to pay, as well as the absence of a tradition of home subscriptions that could carry over to online publishing. But the most important reason is likely the crushing competition from state-funded media outlets, which pump out an overwhelming flow of free-to-access news and entertainment. The state-backed outlets would never lock their material behind paywalls, since they do not operate on commercial terms—they don’t seek maximum profit, but rather maximum dissemination of their politics.\n\nThe Withering of the Lebanese Press\n\nBeirut, the traditional capital of Arab journalism, has long prided itself on its freewheeling press, even if that pluralism was always, to some extent, subverted by the influence of foreign money and political groups. Over the past few years, however, a rapidly growing number of Lebanese dailies have succumbed to hardening economic conditions.\n\nOn New Year’s Eve 2016, the influential leftist-nationalist daily As-Safir finally folded after years of economic trouble. Once supported by Libyan money, As-Safir had more recently fought over a dwindling readership with Al-Akhbar, a better-funded Hezbollah-friendly daily launched in 2006. An attempt in 2017 by former As-Safir staffers to revive an older title, Al-Ittihad, cratered within a few months. In 2018 came the demise of Al-Anwar, a newspaper that had, in its heyday, served as the voice of Lebanon’s Nasserist movement. As Al-Anwar folded, the Lebanese newspaper editors’ syndicate cried out for urgent action: “Saving print journalism means saving the image of a Lebanon of civilization, built on a legacy of freedom.”\n\nUnfortunately, the Lebanese government was sliding toward bankruptcy even before the pandemic struck, and it was in no position to offer economic support to newspapers. Instead, the closures have continued, and in 2019 the Saudi-allied Hariri family was forced to close its daily, Al-Mustaqbal. More newspaper deaths are to be expected: ominously, the right-leaning An-Nahar, Lebanon’s oldest newspaper, has been unable to pay its staff for months on end.\n\nBreaking the pattern, a new daily called Nidaa Al-Watan was launched in 2019 by the businessman Michel Mecattaf, who is close to the right-wing Christian Kataeb Party. Given that the new paper seemed like an obvious riposte to the growing clout of the Iran-friendly Al-Akhbar, it triggered rumors that Mecattaf was backed by Saudi or Emirati funding. While the launch of Nidaa al-Watan points to the continued relevance of print media to the political class, it is also a reminder of how completely the press is in thrall to politics.\n\nSign up for updates.\n\nThe Death of Al-Hayat\n\nNo single event has spelled out Arab print journalism’s problems as clearly as the death of Al-Hayat. The whimpering end of this influential regional daily in 2018–19 demonstrates that even major players are unable to cope with the media’s financial and technological transformation. However, politics also had a hand in Al-Hayat’s demise.\n\nVeteran publicist Kamal Mroue founded Al-Hayat in Beirut in 1946 and edited it until he was assassinated twenty years later, possibly on orders from Gamal Abdel Nasser’s regime in Cairo. The paper was forced to cease publication in 1976 when civil war raged in Lebanon. In 1986, the founder’s son, Jamil Mroue, and Jihad al-Khazen, a well-known Palestinian-Lebanese journalist, relaunched Al-Hayat in London. In its new incarnation, Al-Hayat operated as a regional publication backed by Prince Khaled bin Sultan of Saudi Arabia.\n\nAl-Hayat was able to operate more than twenty bureaus and correspondents across the Middle East and North Africa, while reportedly running a $10 million annual deficit and losing its owners some $160 million between 1986 and 2002.\n\nThanks to regular cash infusions from the prince and other Saudi investors, Al-Hayat was able to operate more than twenty bureaus and correspondents across the Middle East and North Africa, while reportedly running a $10 million annual deficit and losing its owners some $160 million between 1986 and 2002. Though it wasn’t without critics, the new Al-Hayat quickly established itself as one of the Arab world’s most influential press voices: “a favorite of Arab intellectuals throughout the region” with “the most influential cultural pages anywhere in the Arab world.” It featured a reasonably diverse cast of pundits, but the main thrust of its politics was to promote Saudi interests. Over time, that side of Al-Hayat’s mission grew at the expense of both news and views, and in 2005 the paper established a separate Riyadh edition to better access the Saudi market. However, even if Al-Hayat claimed lower circulation figures than then-prince Salman’s Asharq Al-Awsat, it was widely seen as the more prestigious, intellectual brand of the two Saudi-backed international papers.\n\nHowever, the rise of online media wore down Al-Hayat like it did other newspapers—and then came trouble in Saudi Arabia. After inheriting the throne in 2015, King Salman immediately started to promote his son Mohammed, who was elevated to crown prince in 2017. The new crown prince began to put pressure on potential rivals, and, around that time, funding for Al-Hayat appears to have dried up. Given the state of the media market more generally, the paper couldn’t continue on commercial terms.\n\nThe first signs that something was seriously awry at Al-Hayat came in late 2016, when the paper began to hemorrhage staff. Notably, editor in chief Ghassan Charbel moved to take up the same position at Asharq Al-Awsat, which, given its links to the Salman branch of the House of Saud, was unlikely to face trouble with funding. In 2018, Al-Hayat suspended its print edition and closed its offices in London, Cairo, Dubai, and Beirut. Salaries went unpaid, prompting strikes among the employees. In autumn 2019, Al-Hayat finally stopped updating its website, and in early March 2020 its editor in chief, Saud al-Rayyes, announced that he had given up hope of reviving the paper. But by then, the demise of this once-prestigious regional daily elicited barely a shrug from the Arab public—that’s how little it had come to matter. Al-Hayat had already long ago lost the credibility and stature it enjoyed in its earlier years, and its readers had drifted off to new forms of media, such as satellite television and online news.\n\nBeyond Print\n\nWith Arab print newspapers long in decline, other types of media have risen to take their place, both as journalistic institutions and as government mouthpieces. Today, the Arab public is fed news and views by a bewildering variety of online sites. Some of the better-funded and more serious online operations remain attached to print newspapers or to satellite television networks, but, just as in the United States or Europe, the public’s news intake is increasingly filtered through social media.\n\nPrint media retains one important advantage. “When you work for print media, you know that what you write cannot be changed once the newspaper is published,” said Ibrahim Hamidi, a senior diplomatic editor at Asharq Al-Awsat. “When you write online, it’s different—you can make updates and fix errors gradually.” The ephemeral quality of online text may have contributed to what Hamidi said is a lingering sense in the region that print publications carry more credibility than online-only news. Indeed, the prestige that comes from being a real newspaper seems to have dissuaded some publishers from ditching economically burdensome print editions, even when their core strategy is to seek success online.\n\nThe prestige that comes from being a real newspaper seems to have dissuaded some publishers from ditching economically burdensome print editions, even when their core strategy is to seek success online.\n\nHowever, the main hub of the Arab world’s evolving information ecosystem is the regional satellite television channels. Large, lavishly funded, and technologically advanced, they offer round-the-clock broadcasts and professionally edited news websites—all of it, of course, free of charge to the audience. It is these television channels and their websites that now function as the primary mouthpieces of governments and powerful elites in the Middle East.\n\nOn the pan-Arab television scene, Qatar is represented by Al Jazeera and a newer channel, Al Araby, while Saudi Arabia’s views are promoted by Al Arabiya and its sister channel Al-Hadath. Non-Arab nations, too, have invested in Arabic-language satellite television: Russia, Turkey, the United States, France, the United Kingdom, and Iran all run their own state-funded, free-to-view Arabic news channels.\n\nPrint media may still be prestigious and have some advantages when it comes to credibility, but it is now largely unviable without political funding. And since the pan-Arab television networks reach vastly bigger audiences than the printed press, interest in funding loss-making legacy media is fading fast among regional political elites. Even those Arab governments that are most invested in publishing official print newspapers have started to write them off as financially unsustainable—Egypt, for example, plans to phase out state funding for its government-run newspapers by 2025.\n\nThe COVID-19 Effect\n\nIn its weakened, withering state, the Arab world’s printed press is poorly equipped to cope with the impact of COVID-19.\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) has warned that the pandemic could have a devastating impact in the Middle East and North Africa, where underdeveloped healthcare systems and dysfunctional bureaucracies struggle to cope with the needs of vulnerable populations. In the refugee camps of Iraq, Libya, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen, self-isolating is as difficult as regularly washing your hands with hot water and soap.\n\nIn response to the spread of the virus, Arab nations have imposed a host of restrictions, including, in some cases, hard lockdowns and curfews that make newspaper sales virtually impossible; the effect is to drive the last remaining print readers online.\n\nGovernments have also been tempted to use the opportunity to restrict press freedom, with, for example, Algeria issuing a new law against “fake news.” The COVID-19 crisis “reminds me of 9/11, how some governments used the attacks to crack down,” Hamidi said.\n\nIn addition, advertising income has evaporated all over the region. According to Abdelmohsen Salameh, the head of Al-Ahram’s administrative council, the pandemic has slashed 75 percent of Egypt’s ad market. The situation is probably just as grim in other countries, and, as Mellor noted, “Arab governments would not be expected to prioritize aiding or bailing out media institutions.”\n\nIn mid-March, Jordan took the unprecedented step of banning the printing of newspapers entirely, ordering the local press to carry on through online reporting. The decision quickly inspired copycat bans in other Arab nations, whose leaders were just as eager to show that they took COVID-19 seriously. Before the end of the month, print media had been shut down in areas of Syria under the control of President Bashar al-Assad and in the part of southern Yemen that is ruled by the government of President Abdu Rabbu Mansour Hadi. Bans on print media were also issued in Oman, Morocco, and, to an extent, in the Emirates.\n\nThe official reason, as Syria’s Ministry of Information put it, was a fear that “paper is one of the surfaces that can transport the virus.” In fact, WHO has not recommended stopping print publications, and the measure seems virtually unheard of outside the Middle East. But stopping print news was nevertheless an attractive choice for these governments: it was a highly visible, demonstrative action against the virus, and it was cheap—in fact, shedding unprofitable print editions of state-run papers may have helped cut costs.\n\nGiven that COVID-19 will remain a threat to public health indefinitely, or until a vaccine can be found, it is unclear how long these draconian measures can remain in place. By early May, the curfews imposed across Arab nations were being abandoned as their devastating impact on the economy had become apparent, but no government had yet decided to lift a print ban.\n\n“It’s hard to see [print dailies in the countries where they were stopped] return as they were before,” Khouri said. “The economics of physically printing and distributing newspapers is getting really difficult,” he added. “These papers were dying anyway.”\n\nArab journalists interviewed for this report agreed, painting a bleak, almost hopeless future for print media.\n\n“The corona pandemic came to strangle journalists and has confronted them with a new, immediate threat, namely the loss of their jobs due to a major interruption of print sales,” wrote Firas al-Shoufi, a reporter with Lebanon’s Al-Akhbar, in a text message. “This problem may end the life of print journalism after the changes wrought by digital media.”\n\n“The pandemic has pushed print media to the brink.”\n\nVeteran Jordanian journalist and political commentator Osama Al Sharif agrees. “The pandemic has pushed print media to the brink,” he wrote in a text message. “Unable to sell print copies, print media has lost its last connection with readers. Now hundreds of journalists face a dire future, not getting paid as newspapers may go bankrupt. The government is trying to propose solutions. But financial help will not work. Print journalism cannot be saved and we are looking at a world where print is gone.”\n\nIn the longer run, the death of print journalism may have been impossible to avoid, but its inevitability does not make it any less significant.\n\nThe disappearance of this peculiar medium, which has for so long been intimately bound up with the conduct and deliberation of politics, also signifies the rise of new forms of mass communication. Politics is moving into a pseudo-anarchic online environment that is in fact powerfully structured by opaque algorithms and ideological clustering on social media.\n\nAs countless media scholars have argued, the transition to online media, which is already well advanced, is a sea change in human communication no less transformative or disruptive than past revolutions in media technology: book printing, newspapers, radio, television. The importance of this change has become common knowledge, but its unpredictable impacts—from the Arab uprisings to the election of Donald Trump—continue to surprise and shock. For the Arab world, as for the rest of humanity, the political, economic, and social effects of the information revolution are only beginning to be felt.\n\nThe transformation of the Arab media landscape may be especially quick and comprehensive because of the region’s particular combination of authoritarianism, economic patronage, and linguistic unity. Satellite television networks, online publications, and social media all appeared on the scene within a short span of time and gathered momentum quickly, amid radical political change in the years from the U.S. invasion of Iraq until the Arab uprisings. The new Arab media has been able to speedily eclipse a uniquely vulnerable print media sphere, which proved unable to adapt by diversifying its platforms—as many legacy publications elsewhere have done.\n\nYet for all its particularities, the structural similarities between print media in the Middle East and other parts of the world are more salient. In watching the terminal decline of the Arab printed press, the West should realize that when it comes to the changing media environment, the Middle East isn’t behind the curve, but ahead of it."
