        "text": "It all started with Cristiano Ronaldo.\n\nThe Portuguese football superstar moved to Al Nassr from Manchester United in January, setting off what appears to be a trend.\n\nSeveral big-name players have since followed on his footsteps, ditching top European leagues for the sunnier – and wealthier – climes of the Saudi Pro League.\n\nHere are some of the most eye-catching deals by clubs in the kingdom during this transfer window:\n\nKarim Benzema: Real Madrid to Al Ittihad\n\nThe 35-year-old left Real Madrid in the summer on a free transfer as the club’s second-highest goalscorer and top assist provider.\n\nThe five-time UEFA Champions League winner and current Ballon d’Or holder signed a two-year contract, with the option to extend for a third, with the reigning Saudi Pro League champions that is reportedly worth $213m per season.\n\nNeymar: PSG to Al Hilal\n\nAl Hilal has agreed to a reported 90 million euros ($98m) transfer fee with Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) for the Brazilian superstar Neymar. The amount would be a record for the Saudi Pro League in its spending spree on high-end football talent.\n\nNeymar has been offered a two-year contract that is expected to pay the 31-year-old an annual salary of about $100m – around half of Ronaldo’s reported salary.\n\nN’Golo Kante: Chelsea to Al Ittihad\n\nKante will join his compatriot Benzema in Jeddah where reports suggest he will earn $109.8m per year after joining Al Ittihad for three years on a free transfer.\n\nThe 32-year-old picked up both Premier League and Champions League trophies during his seven-season stint with Chelsea.\n\nJota: Celtic to Al Ittihad\n\nThe 24-year-old winger from Portugal has been a standout player over two seasons for the Scottish giants.\n\nHe joined Al Ittihad on a three-year contract with Scottish media reporting the transfer fee was $31.73m.\n\nRuben Neves: Wolverhampton Wanderers to Al Hilal\n\nThe Portuguese midfielder, at 26 years old, is one of the first established names to have moved to the Saudi league at the prime of their career.\n\nHe joined Al Hilal on a three-year deal for a reported $60m.\n\nJordan Henderson: Liverpool to Al-Ettifaq\n\nHenderson, 33, signed with Al-Ettifaq on July 27, after the club successfully lured former teammate and Liverpool legend Steven Gerrard to join as manager.\n\nThe England international was captain of Liverpool when the club won the Premier League and Champions League titles. He will reportedly earn 700,000 pounds ($900,000) per week.\n\nKalidou Koulibaly, Chelsea to Al Hilal\n\nThe Senegalese defender will join Neves in Riyadh on a three-year deal after a solitary season at Stamford Bridge.\n\nBritish media reported the transfer fee was about $21.6m.\n\nSergej Milinkovic-Savic, Lazio to Al Hilal\n\nThe 28-year-old Serbian has signed a contract with Al Hilal until 2026.\n\nItalian media reported that Al Hilal would pay about $44.5m for the highly rated midfielder.\n\nEdouard Mendy, Chelsea to Al Ahli\n\nThe Senegalese goalkeeper will travel to Jeddah on a three-year deal after three seasons at Stamford Bridge.\n\nBritish media reported the Saudi club would pay about $20.24m for the 31-year-old.\n\nRoberto Firmino: Liverpool to Al Ahli\n\nThe 31-year-old Brazilian forward has joined Al Ahli on a free transfer after eight illustrious seasons with Liverpool, in which he won the Champions League in 2019 and the Premier League in 2020.\n\nRiyad Mahrez: Manchester City to Al Ahli\n\nThe two clubs have come to an agreement for the transfer of the Algerian international on a three-year contract for a reported $38.5m.\n\nThe 32-year-old will move to Jeddah after a treble-winning season with Manchester City.\n\nFabinho: Liverpool to Al-Ittihad\n\nFabinho has moved for a reported 40 million pounds ($51.5m) to end his five-year stay at Liverpool, which he joined from Monaco.\n\nThe 29-year-old Fabinho made 219 appearances for Liverpool and helped the club win the Champions League in 2019 and the Premier League a year later.\n\nSadio Mane: Bayern Munich to Al Nassr\n\nMane has signed a four-year contract, Al-Nassr added on messaging platform X, formerly known as Twitter.\n\nFinancial details were not disclosed but media reports said the Saudis paid 40 million euros ($43.85m) for the 31-year-old who had two more years left on his Bayern contract.\n\nMarcelo Brozovic: Inter Milan to Al Nassr\n\nThe 30-year-old Croatian midfielder international has signed a three-year deal.\n\nItalian media said the transfer fee was $19.6m.\n\nSeko Fofana: Lens to Al Nassr\n\nThe 28-year-old Ivory Coast midfielder has joined Al Nassr on a three-year deal.\n\nFrench media said the transfer fee was about $28.1m.\n\nAlex Telles: Manchester United to Al Nassr\n\nThe Brazilian defender is set for a reunion with former United teammate Ronaldo after 50 appearances for the Reds.\n\nLast season, he won the Europa League with Sevilla during a loan spell with the Spanish club.\n\nTelles signed a contract until 2025 and media reports suggested United would receive about $7.71m for the deal."
