Al-Ittihad al-'Arabi (The Arab Union) was a political and literary daily newspaper that was first issued in 1925. It was the first newspaper to be released in Tulkarem. Its slogan was, “In the name of the Arabs we live, and in the name of the Arabs we die”. The owner and editor-in-chief of the newspaper was Salim 'Abd al-Rahman al-Hajj Ibrahim, a leader of the national movement and a supporter of the Arab revolution. Al-Ittihad Al-'Arabi continued to publish until 1927, when it stopped publishing due to the economic crisis that hit the country at the time.
