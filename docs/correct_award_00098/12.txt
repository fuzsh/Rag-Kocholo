Work

Mikhail Sholokhov’s work Tikhii Don (1940) (And Quiet Flows the Don) took 14 years to complete. It became the most-read work of Soviet fiction and was heralded as a powerful example of socialist realism. Sholokhov was deeply interested in human destinies played against the background of the transformations and troubles in Russia. His other major work in the Don cycle, Podnyataya Tselina (Virgin Soil Upturned), took 27 years to finish.
