        "text": "Mikhail Sholokhov won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1965 after numerous nominations. At the time of his award, And Quiet Flows the Don was the most widely-read book in Soviet literature. He won the Stalin Prize in 1941 and he was one of Stalin's favourite writers. Maxim Gorky said that it \"can only be compared with Tolstoy's War and Peace\".\n\nIn fact, And Quiet Flows the Don has not worn well. It describes the suffering of the fiercely independent Don Cossacks in southern Russia and Ukraine in the First World War, the Revolution, and the Civil War. Perhaps the Nobel committee presented Sholokhov with his award to build bridges with the Soviet Union after choosing Boris Pasternak, and his novel Doctor Zhivago in 1958. Subsequently Sholokhov has been eclipsed by Pasternak and Solzhenitsyn as chroniclers of the agony of the Russian people under Communism. Vasily Grossman's Life and Fate and Stalingrad are far superior. Mikhail Bulgakov's short novel The White Guard is a wonderful description of the Russian Civil War in Ukraine.\n\nThere is a lyric side to Sholokhov's prose. In Russian, his descriptions of the steppes of Ukraine must be marvellous. But unlike other great Russian novelists, he was uncritically Communist and has no depth of thought. Even Grossman, who was also a Communist and a favourite of Stalin, was open to transcendence to some degree; Sholokhov's characters are inspired by ideology, lust or rage. Religion is not criticised in the novel; it simply has no place at all in Sholokhov's universe. There are a few passages of boilerplate Stalinism in the book, which excuse the slaughter of supporters of the Czar because they are enemies of the proletariat.\n\nThe central plot device is the anti-hero's attachment to two women, his neighbour's wife and his own wife -- so in the first volume sexual content occurs fairly often although there are no vivid or pornographic scenes. There are some brutal scenes of wife-beating. The cruelty and violence on both sides, the Reds and the Whites, are appalling. (Unfortunately, this is historical fact; Sholokhov ignored the worst of the atrocities.)\n\nA word on the translation. The history of the text is disputed. Solzhenitsyn and others have claimed that Sholokhov plagiarised much of the novel. The first English translation, by Stephen Garry (which I read), leaves out about half of the last book.\n\nIn short, And Quiet Flows the Don is an interesting historical document. But as a picture of the agony of Russia from 1914 to 1924, it has been superseded."
