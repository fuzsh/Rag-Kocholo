        "text": "Havoc In Its Third Year by Ronan Bennett (2004)\n\nThis superbly driven narrative benefits from Bennett's comprehensive knowledge of 17th-century England and had me gripped from beginning to end. It is, however, the subtle way in which parallels are drawn with today that makes the novel worthy of inclusion in such a list.\n\nJohn Shields, Wilmslow\n\nA Journal of the Plague Year by Daniel Defoe (1722)\n\nI first read this account of the great plague of London in 2001 during the foot-and-mouth crisis, which may have heightened my appreciation of it. The narrator is \"HF\", possibly Defoe's uncle. His original intention is to flee London, but various obstacles prevent this, which he takes as a sign from God to stay, witness the events and warn future generations. He roams the streets recording the progress of the disease, and the death and despair it leaves in its wake. While believing that only a spiritual transformation will prevent the plague's return, he does record how good local government, science and medicine can alleviate its effects.\n\nJeremy Hayes, Snodland, Kent\n\nAnd Quiet Flows the Don by Mikhail Sholokhov (1934)\n\nSholokhov was a member of the Supreme Soviet under Stalin, which makes it all the more remarkable that he could produce a novel encompassing the period of the first world war, the Russian revolution and civil war with relative even-handedness. The mundanity, feuds and adulteries of everyday Cossack life and the tedium of military life are set against the bewildering drama of great national political intrigues and events. The characters' motivations are explored and explained as they are swept up in the inevitability of change like horses carried away by the great, silent river at the heart of the story. Sholokhov won the 1965 Nobel prize primarily because of this magnificent, epic novel.\n\nSteve Whittaker, Blandford Forum\n\nThe Sea and Poison by Shusaku Endo (1958)\n\nThis dark, claustrophobic, creepy novel deserves a place on your list. It is the ultimate indictment of militarism and one of the very few works by Japanese artists that portray the spiritual death of a society devoted to war.\n\nKevin Monahan, Kanazawa, Japan\n\nThis brilliantly constructed novel tells an abhorrent tale of football hooliganism, young male anger and friendship, while also capturing the depth and psychology of a rich vein of British culture often ignored in literature. By choosing as the story's narrator Tommy Johnson, a perceptive man who knows he's really a bit too sharp for the thuggery he enjoys, King allows his writing to dazzle with its analysis, its pace and its pull-no-punches-kicks-or-headbutts realism.\n\nDamon Lambert, Yalding, Kent\n\nThe Octopus by Frank Norris (1901)\n\nThe Octopus of the title is the thinly disguised Southern Pacific Railroad, part of the First Transcontinental, the dominant owner of California land and politicians for a good half-century after its completion in 1869. In the novel, the Octopus uses its dominance to strangle its opponents, by manipulating the leaseholds of their ranches and the freight rates of the wheat that is their principal crop. A railroad agent is drowned in a cargo of wheat, and rancher Derrick is ruined when the railroad bribes his lawyer son. Shelgrim, the railroad president, explains that what happens is a matter of economic forces, and the law of supply and demand. Marx could not have put it more succinctly.\n\nLeslie Bell, North Ferriby, East Yorkshire\n\nJoseph Knight by James Robertson (2003)\n\nRobertson takes us on a journey from the fields of Culloden to the plantations in Jamaica and finally to the coal mines of Fife. Spanning the years 1746-1803, the novel captures the true nature of what it felt like to be taken from Africa across the \"Black Atlantic\", worked half to death in the Caribbean and finally deposited in a cold, inhospitable Scotland. Along the way, Robertson skilfully weaves Boswell, Johnson, Robert Burns and Toussaint L'Ouverture into the story. The final chapter set among the colliers of Fife reveals the true relationship between master and slave. It is a book that will stay with me for ever.\n\nAndy Aitken, Ayrshire\n\nPersepolis by Marjane Satrapi (2003)\n\nGoing through puberty in a theocratic police state sounds like a black farce, but for Satrapi - and millions of other Iranians - it actually happened, and is still happening. Satrapi combines adolescent concerns about sex, drugs and peer hierarchy with a story of a society hammered by revolution and war. Drawn in beautiful and somehow expressive monochrome, Satrapi's graphic novel entwines the political with the personal to create a marvellous study in human defiance. There's a glorious moment when a state policeman tells Satrapi to stop running - because her \"behind makes movements that are ... obscene!\" \"Well, then,\" roars Satrapi, \"don't look at my ass!\"\n\nMax Dunbar, Manchester\n\nDownriver by Iain Sinclair (1991)\n\nI found it unbelievable that England's foremost contemporary novelist, Iain Sinclair, appeared to have fallen off the edge of this bookshelf. Sinclair is not simply the writer of the most fantastically hard-edged prose sentences, full of extraordinary imagery and rhythms, nor is he just a writer who has informed the culture of the 1990s and 2000s through his range of interests. He is the writer who has best anatomised the society of the UK in the late 20th century and the subsequent years. Downriver is a masterpiece that goes beyond the surface realism of Thatcherite society.\n\nLeigh Hughes, Saltash, Cornwall\n\nWhen Memory Dies by A Sivanandan (1997)\n\nThe subtle and shifting lens masterfully manipulated by A Sivanandan in this three-generational novel about Sri Lanka allows for a focus on both personal and national tragedy. It is lyrical, wise and sorrowful for a country's lost loveliness.\n\nFrances Webber, London\n\nFame Is the Spur by Howard Spring (1940)\n\nEvocatively set in northern England, Fame Is the Spur takes Labour pioneer Hamer Shawcross from his youthful connection with Peterloo, through the early days of the labour movement and the socialists who formed his views and sustained his career, to the final outcome of his ambition as Viscount Shawcross of Handforth. When, at the age of 16, I began to be involved in the Liberal party, my mother made me read this book as a warning on how politicians can be seduced away from principles. It has hovered over me ever since.\n\nMichael Meadowcroft, Leeds\n\nSostiene Pereira by Tabucchi (1994)"
