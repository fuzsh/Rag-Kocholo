        "text": "#6\n\nP6302585.JPG\n\nMikhail Sholokhov: Time and Fate\n\n#5\n\nThe historical and literary exhibition “Mikhail Sholokhov: Time and Fate” tells the story of the difficult creative career and life journey of the famous writer, and the complex fate of his books.\n\nThe exhibition is housed in seven halls of a two-story building that was constructed in 1913 for the stanitsa government. Later, it was included in the State Museum-Reserve which was established to commemorate the writer and social activist Mikhail Aleksandrovich Sholokhov, who was twice awarded the title of Hero of Socialist Labor and won the State Lenin Prize and the Nobel Prize.\n\nThe collection includes manuscripts and books, photographs and letters, documents, and works of visual art. The writer’s personal belongings are of particular interest.\n\nThe exhibition also features artefacts of his period which were widely used by the writer’s contemporaries and the characters of his books.\n\nThe presented items provide detailed and valuable insight into the atmosphere of Sholokhov’s classic works, allow the visitors to experience that time as it was, and to get into the spirit of the Don Cossack community.\n\nExhibits are marked with AR stickers for identification purposes.\n\n#7\n\nMinistry of Culture of the Russian Federation\n\nread morehide"
