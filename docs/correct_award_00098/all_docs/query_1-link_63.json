        "text": "An epic novel of love, war and revolution from Mikhail Sholokhov, winner of the Nobel Prize in Literature\n\nOne of the most important Russian masterpieces of the 20th century, And Quiet Flows the Don is an epic novel depicting the lives and struggles of Don Cossacks during the First World War, the Russian Revolution and the Civil War. The story follows the Cossack Gregor Melekhov, a tragic hero who first supports the Whites, then the Reds, and finally joins nationalist guerrillas in their conflict with the Red Army. A riveting portrait of an era, And Quiet Flows the Don explores the complicated choices people have to make when they live in the midst of a revolution.\n\nMikhail Sholokhov (Author)\n\nMikhail Aleksandrovich Sholokhov (1905-1984) was born in Russia in the land of the Cossacks. During the Russian civil war he fought on the side of the revolutionaries, and in 1922 he moved to Moscow to become a journalist. In 1926, Sholokhov began writing And Quiet Flows the Don, and he published the first volume in 1928. Three more volumes followed with the last one published in 1940. In 1965 he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature “for the artistic power and integrity with which, in his epic of the Don, he has given expression to a historic phase in the life of the Russian people”."
