        "text": "Museum Collection\n\nA “Nobel Prize” Photo of Sholokhov\n\nIn the December of 1965 M.A. Sholokhov was awarded the Nobel Prize in literature “in recognition of his artistic powers and his integrity as creator of an epic on the historic years of the Russian people”. The State M.A. Sholokhov Museum-Reserve keeps many objects connected with this great event. Among them there is a picture made by a Don camera-man and film director Leon Borisovich Mazrukho.\n\nLeon Borisovich Mazrukho (1908-1979) as a photocorrespondent accompanied the writer in his travelling to Sweden. Mikhail Aleksandrovich personally selected people to accompany him in his trip and Mazrukho was one of the delegation.\n\nIn the picture Mikhail Alexandrovich is in the Colden Hall of the Stockholm Town Hall before the beginning of the Nobel Prize investiture ceremony.\n\nHe is wearing an elegant black evening dress and a snow white shirt. The photograph seems “animate” to suggest seeing the moment Mikhail Aleksandrovich would touch his shirt collar, finish smoking his cigarette, observe the photos hung on the wall and go to receive the deserved award.\n\nLeon Mazrukho met with Sholokhov many times in official circumstances as well as in everyday life, at rest, he knew the writer well. Owing to the skill of the photo artist the viewer experiences presence, the image of great writer becomes closer to us."
