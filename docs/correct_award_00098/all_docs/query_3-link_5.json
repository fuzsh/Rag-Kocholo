        "text": "(1905–84). The Soviet novelist Mikhail Sholokhov won the Nobel prize for literature in 1965 for his realistic portrayals of Cossack life in the Don River region of Russia. His chief work, published from 1928 to 1940, has been translated into English as And Quiet Flows the Don (1934) and The Don Flows Home to the Sea (1940).\n\nMikhail Aleksandrovich Sholokhov was born in Veshenskaya, Russia, on May 24 (May 11 according to the calendar in use at the time), 1905. At age 15 he joined the Red Army, which was then fighting a civil war to assure the triumph of Communism. After the war and two years in Moscow, he returned home to his beloved Don River area. He had written his first book, Tales of the Don, at 17. He began his major novel in 1925. It is an unbiased depiction of the struggle of the Cossacks against the Communist armed forces. It became the most widely read novel in the nation and was praised as an example of socialist realism. The novel was awarded the Stalin prize in 1941.\n\nSholokhov’s second large novel was 28 years in preparation. It has been translated in two parts as Virgin Soil Upturned (1935, published as Seeds of Tomorrow in the United States) and Harvest of the Don (1960). His They Fought for Their Country (1942) is a heroic novel of the Soviet struggle against the German invasion of World War II.\n\nSome have accused Sholokhov of plagiarism, citing his youth and inexperience at the time of the publication of his first book. They claim the original was done by the Cossack writer Fëdor Kryukov, who died in 1920. They also note that Sholokhov’s later books did not compare in quality with the great first novel. Sholokhov died in Veshenskaya on Feb. 21, 1984."
