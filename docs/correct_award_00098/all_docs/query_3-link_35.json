Mikhail Aleksandrovich Sholokhov (24 May [O.S. 11 May] 1905 - 21 February 1984) was a Russian novelist and winner of the 1965 Nobel Prize in Literature. He is known for writing about life and fate of Don Cossacks during the Russian Revolution, the civil war and the period of collectivization, primarily in his most famous novel, And Quiet Flows the Don. In 1959 he accompanied Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev on a trip to Europe and the United States. He became a member of the CPSU Central Committee in 1961, Academician of the USSR Academy of Sciences in 1939, and was a member of the USSR Supreme Soviet. He was twice awarded the title of Hero of Socialist Labor, and later became vice president of the Union of Soviet Writers. Sudba Cheloveka, 1956-1957 - Fate of a Man. A film version, Destiny of a Man, directed by Sergei Bondarchuk and starring Sergei Bondarchuk, Pavlik Boriskin, Zinaida Kirienko, Pavel Volkov, Yuri Avelin, and K. Alekseev, was produced in 1959. The Kukryniksy were three caricaturists/cartoonists in the USSR with a recognizable style. \"Kukryniksy\" is a collective name, which is derived from the names of three caricaturists (Mikhail Kupriyanov, 1903-1991), Porfiri Krylov (1902-1990), and Nikolai Sokolov (1903-2000) who had met at VKhUTEMAS, a Moscow art school, in the early 1920s. The three began drawing caricatures under the joint signature in 1924. They became nationally famous in the 1930s after the rise of fascism, drawing for Krokodil, the Moscow satirical paper. They received international recognition for their attacks on Adolf Hitler, Benito Mussolini, Heinrich Himmler, Joseph Goebbels, and Francisco Franco. During the Second World War they established the TASS Windows for political cartoons and posters. After the end of the Second World War they continued to depict politics in their series Cold War (1945â\"1980s). They illustrated a number of books, including Sholokhov, Ilf and Petrov's, Nikolay Gogol, Mikhail Saltykov-Shchedrin, Anton Chekhov, Maxim Gorky, Nikolai Leskov, Miguel de Cervantes. The Kukryniksy are also authors of Socialist Realism-style paintings concerned with historical, political and propaganda topics. All three were awarded the honorary title of People's Artist of the USSR (1958). They were also recipients of other awards. There are more than a thousand works of the Kukryniksy in the collection of Alexandre Garese, which have been restored. \"Fate of a Man\" is a short story written by Soviet Russian writer Mikhail Sholokhov in 1956. With the outbreak of the Great Patriotic War, the truck driver Andrey Sokolov has to leave for army and part with his family. In the first months of the war, he gets wounded and is captured by Nazis. In captivity, he experiences all the burdens of a concentration camp. Due to his courage he showed to camp's chief when he refuses to drink with him to victory of Nazi arms, he avoids his execution and, finally, runs from Nazis. In a short vacation in his hometown, Sokolov finds out that his beloved wife Irina and both of their daughters were killed during the bombing. He immediately returns to the front, unable to stay in his native town any more. The only relative Andrey still has is his son, who serves as an officer in the army. Right on Victory Day, Andrey receives news that his son was killed on the last day of the war. After the war, lonely Andrei Sokolov doesn't return to his town and works somewhere else. He meets a little boy Vanya, who was left an orphan. His mother died and his father missed in action. Sokolov tells the boy that he is his father, and this gives the boy (and himself) a hope for a new life. The plot of the story is based on real events. In the spring of 1946, on hunting Sholokhov met a man who told him this story. Sholokhov was stricken and said: \"I'll write a short story about this, I surely will.\" Ten years later, after reading some short stories by Hemingway and Remarque, Sholokhov wrote \"The Fate of a Man\" in seven days. Presumed First Edition, First printing (1 of 30,000)."
