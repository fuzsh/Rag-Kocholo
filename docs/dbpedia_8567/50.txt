Santosh Shukla, who became a household name with his stint in Bigg Boss and the film Jai Ho, is celebrating his birthday today (2 June). Like every other actor we thought Santosh would be partying hard. But he has chosen to spend the day meaningfully, sharing moments with kids from an orphanage. It is well known that Santosh idealises Salman Khan and the suggestion of celebrating birthday with kids came from the Bhai of Bollywood. Says Santosh, “Yes, Salman bhai called me last night to wish me and told me spend the day with orphanage kids from Lokhandwala. I took cakes and gifts for these kids. It was really amazing. But the best thing is that it’s finally raining in Mumbai, so God must also be celebrating my birthday (smiles).” Who was the first to wish you? “My mom and dad were the first ones to wish me and I am really missing them.” Have you ever done anything naughty on your birthday? “Yes, back in school days there was my tuition teacher who happened to be very strict and I was not that great in studies. One day on my birthday I forgot to solve Maths sums and he hit me badly. So to take revenge I later gifted him a wrapped sweet box with garbage inside (laughs). Luckily, he got to know that it was my birthday so instead of further showering his wrath, laughed off the entire incident.” Santosh… we wish you lot of luck and success!
