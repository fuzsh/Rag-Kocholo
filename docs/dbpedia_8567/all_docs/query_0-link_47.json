        "text": "From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\nMohammed Rafi (24 December 1924 – 31 July 1980) was an Indian recording artist who is considered by many to be one of the greatest Indian playback singers of the Hindi film industry.[1] In his lifetime, he was awarded the National Film Award, Best National Singer Award and six Filmfare Awards. In 1967, he was honoured with the Padma Shri award by the Government of India.[2] His singing career spanned about 35 years. Rafi is noted for his ability to sing songs of different moods and varieties:[3] They ranged from classical numbers to patriotic songs, sad lamentations to highly romantic numbers, qawwalis to ghazals and bhajans. He is best known for romantic and duet songs and, as a playback singer, his ability to mould his voice to the persona of the actor lip-synching the song.[4]\n\nRafi is primarily noted for his songs in Hindustani, over which he had a strong command. He sang in other Indian languages including Assamese, Konkani, Bhojpuri, Oriya, Punjabi, Bengali, Marathi, Sindhi, Kannada, Gujarati, Telugu, Maghi, Maithili and Urdu. He also recorded a few songs in English, Persian, Spanish and Dutch. From available figures, Rafi sang 4,516 Hindi film songs, 112 non-Hindi film songs, and 328 private (non-film) songs from 1945 to 1980.\n\nMohammed Rafi was the fifth youngest of six brothers. The sixth youngest Mohammad Siddique is still alive and lives in Lahore, Pakistan in their ancestral house. His father was Hajji Ali Mohammad. The family originally belonged to Kotla Sultan Singh, a village near present-day Amritsar in Punjab, India.[5] Rafi, whose nickname was Pheeko, began singing by imitating the chants of a fakir in the streets of Bhati gate Lahore where his family lived.[5] Rafi's father moved to Lahore in the 1920s. His elder brother, Mohammad Deen, had a friend, Abdul Hameed, (future brother-in-law), who recognised the talent in Rafi in Lahore and encouraged him to sing. Abdul Hameed later convinced the family elders to let Rafi move to Mumbai; he accompanied him in 1944.\n\nRafi learnt classical music from Ustad Bade Ghulam Ali Khan, Ustad Abdul Wahid Khan, Pandit Jiwan Lal Mattoo and Firoze Nizami.[6][7] His first public performance came at the age of 13, when he sang in Lahore featuring K. L. Saigal.[6] In 1941, Rafi, under Shyam Sundar, made his debut in Lahore as a playback singer in the duet \"Soniye Nee, Heeriye Nee\" with Zeenat Begum in the Punjabi film Gul Baloch (released in 1944).[8] In that same year, Rafi was invited by All India Radio Lahore station to sing for them.[9]\n\nHe made his Hindi film debut in Gaon Ki Gori in 1945.[4]\n\nBombay (1944 to 1947)[edit]\n\nIn 1944, Rafi moved to Bombay. He and Hameed Sahab rented a ten-by-ten-foot room in the crowded downtown Bhendi Bazar area. Poet Tanvir Naqvi introduced him to film producers including Abdur Rashid Kardar, Mehboob Khan and actor-director Nazeer.[10] Shyam Sunder was in Mumbai and provided the opportunity to Rafi to sing a duet with GM Durrani, \"Aji dil ho qaabu mein to dildar ki aisi taisi...,\" for Gaon Ki Gori, which became Rafi’s first recorded song in a Hindi film. Other songs followed.[11]\n\nRafi's first song with Naushad was \"Hindustan Ke Hum Hain\" with Shyam Kumar, Alauddin and others, from A. R. Kardar's Pehle Aap (1944). Around the same time, Rafi recorded another song for the 1945 film Gaon Ki Gori, \"Aji Dil Ho Kaaboo Mein\". He considered this song his first Hindi language song.[9]\n\nRafi appeared in two movies. In 1945, he appeared on the screen for the song \"Tera Jalwa Jis Ne Dekha\" in the film Laila Majnu.[9] He sang a number of songs for Naushad as part of the chorus, including \"Mere Sapnon Ki Rani, Roohi Roohi\" with K. L. Saigal from the film Shahjahan (1946). Rafi sang \"Tera Khilona Toota Balak\" from Mehboob Khan's Anmol Ghadi (1946) and a duet with Noor Jehan in the 1947 film Jugnu, \"Yahan Badla Wafa Ka\".[12] After partition, Rafi decided to stay back in India and had the rest of his family flown to Mumbai. Noor Jehan migrated to Pakistan and made a pair with playback singer Ahmed Rushdi.\n\nIn 1949, Rafi was given solo songs by music directors such as Naushad (Chandni Raat, Dillagi and Dulari) Shyam Sunder (Bazaar) and Husnalal Bhagatram (Meena Bazaar).\n\nRafi was influenced by the singers of that time like K. L Saigal and, most notably, by G. M. Durrani on whose style he based his singing. He sang with his idol in some of the songs such as \"Humko Hanste Dekh Zamana Jalta Hai\" (Hum Sab Chor Hain, 1956)[13] and \"Khabar Kisi Ko Nahiin, Woh Kidhar Dekhte\" (Beqasoor, 1950),[14] etc.\n\nIn 1948, after the assassination of Mahatma Gandhi, the team of Husanlal Bhagatram-Rajendra Krishan-Rafi had overnight created the song \"Suno Suno Ae Duniyawalon, Bapuji Ki Amar Kahani\".[11] He was invited by the Indian Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, to sing at his house. In 1948, Rafi received a silver medal from Jawaharlal Nehru on Indian Independence Day.\n\nRecording career in the 1950s and 1960s[edit]\n\nSee also: List of songs by Mohammed Rafi\n\nIn his early career, Rafi associated with many contemporary music directors, most notably Naushad Ali. In the late 1950s and 1960s, he worked with other composers of the era such as O. P. Nayyar, Shankar Jaikishan, S.D. Burman and Roshan.\n\nAssociation with Naushad\n\nAs per Naushad, Rafi came to him with a letter of recommendation from Naushad's father.[15] Rafi’s first song for Naushad was \"Hindustan Ke Hum Hain\" (\"We belong to Hindustan\") for the film Pehle Aap in 1944. The first song for the duo was the soundtrack of the movie Anmol Ghadi (1946). Before Rafi, Naushad’s favorite singer was Talat Mahmood. Once Naushad found Talat smoking during a recording. He was annoyed and hired Rafi to sing all the songs of the movie Baiju Bawra.[12]\n\nRafi's association with Naushad helped the former establish himself as one of the most prominent playback singers in Hindi cinema.[9] Songs from Baiju Bawra (1952) like \"O duniya ke rakhwale\" and \"Man tarpat hari darshan ko aaj\" furthered Rafi's credentials.[8] Rafi ended up singing a total of 149 songs (81 of them solo) for Naushad.[16]\n\nIn the 1960 film Mughal-E-Azam, Mohammed Rafi sang \"Ae Mohabbat Zindabad\", composed by Naushad, with a chorus of 100 singers.[citation needed]\n\nAssociation with S D Burman\n\nS. D. Burman patronized Rafi as the singing voice of Dev Anand and Guru Dutt.[17] Rafi worked with Burman in movies like Pyaasa (1957), Kaagaz Ke Phool (1959), Tere Ghar Ke Samne (1963), Guide (1965), Aradhana (1969), and Abhimaan (1973). S. D. Burman was also another music director besides Naushad who used Rafi prolifically to sing for most of his songs.\n\nAssociation with Shankar-Jaikishan\n\nRafi's partnership with Shankar Jaikishan was among the most famous and successful in the Hindi film industry. Under Shankar-Jaikishan, Rafi produced some of his songs for actors like Shammi Kapoor and Rajendra Kumar. Out of six Filmfare awards, Rafi won three for S-J songs — \"Teri Pyari Pyari Surat Ko\", \"Baharon Phool Barsao\", and \"Dil Ke Jharokhe Mein\". The song \"Yahoo! Chahe Koi Mujhe Junglee Kahe\" was sung by Rafi, only to be matched a fast-paced orchestra and a composition by Shankar Jaikishan. S-J made Rafi give playback for Kishore Kumar in the film Shararat (\"Ajab hai daastan teri yeh zindagi\"). Rafi sang a total of 341 numbers (216 solo) for Shankar-Jaikishan.[16] Among the films of this combination are Basant Bahar, Professor, Junglee, Suraj, Brahmachari, An Evening in Paris, Dil Tera Deewana, Yakeen, Prince, Love in Tokyo, Beti Bete, Dil Ek Mandir, Dil Apna Aur Preet Parai, Gaban and Jab Pyar Kisi Se Hota Hai.\n\nAssociation with Ravi\n\nRafi got his first Filmfare Award for the title song of Chaudhvin Ka Chand (1960), composed by Ravi. He got National Award for the song \"Babul Ki Duaen Leti Ja\" from the film Neel Kamal (1968), also composed by Ravi. Rafi wept during the recording of this song. He admitted this in his interview to the BBC in 1977.[18]\n\nRavi and Rafi produced several other songs in the films China Town (1962), Kaajal (1965), and Do Badan (1966).\n\nAssociation with Madan Mohan\n\nMadan Mohan was another composer whose favorite singer was Rafi. Rafi's first solo with Madan Mohan in Ankhen (1950) was \"Hum Ishq Mein Barbad Hain Barbad Rahenge\".[9] They teamed up to produce many songs including \"Teri Aankhon Ke Siva\", \"Yeh Duniya Yeh Mehfil\" and \"Tum Jo Mil Gaye Ho\".\n\nAssociation with O. P. Nayyar\n\nRafi and O. P. Nayyar (OP) created music in the 1950s and 1960s. O. P. Nayyar was once quoted as saying \"If there had been no Mohd. Rafi, there would have been no O. P. Nayyar\".[19] He and Rafi created many songs together including \"Yeh Hai Bombay Meri Jaan\". He got Rafi to sing for singer-actor Kishore Kumar – \"Man Mora Baawara\" for the movie Raagini. Later, Rafi sang for Kishore Kumar in movies such as Baaghi, Shehzaada and Shararat. O. P. Nayyar used Rafi and Asha Bhosle for most of his songs. The team created many songs in early 1950s and 1960s for movies such as Naya Daur (1957), Tumsa Nahin Dekha (1957), and Kashmir Ki Kali (1964). Rafi sang a total of 197 numbers (56 solo) for Nayyar.[20] The songs \"Jawaaniyan yeh mast mast\" and the title song \"Yun to humne lakh hansee dekhe hain, tumsa nahin dekha\" of the film Tumsa Nahin Dekha were hits. They were followed by songs like \"Taareef karoon kya uski jisne tumhe banaya\" from Kashmir ki Kali.[21]\n\nRafi and OP had a fallout during the recording for movie \"Sawan ki Ghata\". As disclosed by OP during one of his interviews; Rafi reported late to the recording stating that he was stuck in Shankar Jaikishan's recording. OP then stated that from now on he too did not have the time for Rafi and cancelled the recording. They did not work together for the next 3 years.[22]\n\nAssociation with Laxmikant-Pyarelal\n\nThe composer duo Laxmikant-Pyarelal (L-P) patronized Rafi as one of their singers, right from their very first song by him from the film, Chaila Babu-1967. Rafi honoured the affection and commitment of the duo by accepting no payment for the song \"Tere pyaar ne mujhe gham diya\" . Rafi and L-P won the Filmfare Awards for the song \"Chahoonga Main Tujhe Saanjh Savere\" from Dosti (1964). Rafi rendered the maximum number of songs for the music director duo Laxmikant-Pyarelal: 369 numbers (186 solo) for L-P.[16]\n\nOnce, when composer Nisar Bazmi (who had migrated to Pakistan) didn’t have enough money to pay him, Rafi charged a fee of one rupee and sang for him. He also helped producers financially. As Laxmikant (of the Laxmikant-Pyarelal duo) once observed – “He always gave without thinking of the returns”.[23]\n\nBetween 1950 and 1970, Rafi was the most sought after singer in the Hindi Film industry.[24] He sang for many male stars in Hindi films.[25] In 1965, he was honoured by the Government of India with the Padma Sri award. Rafi recorded two Hindi songs in English on 7\" release in 1968. He also sang a song in Creole while on his visit to Mauritius in the late 1960s.[6] Rafi recorded two English albums as well. One of them is Pop Hits.\n\nAssociation with his Contemporary Singers\n\nRafi associated with several of his contemporaries, singing duets with them and sometimes for them (as in case of Kishore Kumar who was also an actor). Rafi sang the maximum number of duets with Asha Bhonsle (female), Manna Dey (male) and Lata Mangeshkar (female).\n\nIn the song \"Humko Tumse Ho Gaya Hai Pyaar Kya Karein\" (Amar, Akbar, Anthony), Mohd Rafi sang with Kishore Kumar, Lata Mangeshkar and Mukesh,the most legendary singers in Bollywood - all in one song. This was probably the only time that all of them rendered their voices for one song.[26]\n\nSinging career in other languages\n\nRafi sang several hit songs in Chris Perry's Konkani album Golden Hits with Lorna Cordeiro.[27]\n\nRoyalty issue[edit]\n\nIn 1962-1963, the popular female playback singer Lata Mangeshkar raised the issue of playback singers' share in the royalties. Recognizing Rafi's position as the leading male playback singer, she wanted him to back her in demanding a half-share from the 5 percent song royalty that the film's producer conceded to select composers. Lata's contention was that, there was no way producers and music directors could deny this singing duo, the royalty. Rafi stated that his claim on the filmmaker ended with his being paid his agreed fee for the song. After that, if the film proved a hit, the filmmaker was welcome to keep the Gramco (HMV) royalty he earned from it. If it did not prove to be a hit, argued Rafi, that he had already been paid the same fees for his song; so later the situation is resolved. Rafi stated that it is the producer who bets the money and the composer who creates the song, so his claim to the contribution of the song is compensated when the fees are paid. Lata viewed his stand as a stumbling block on the royalty issue and stated that it is because of the singer's name also that the records get sold. This difference of opinion subsequently led to differences between the two. During the recording of \"Tasveer Teri Dil Mein\" (Maya, 1961), Lata argued with Rafi over a certain passage of the song. Rafi felt belittled, as music director Salil Chowdhury sided with Lata. The situation worsened when Lata declared that she would no longer sing with Rafi. Rafi stated that he was only so keen to sing with Lata as she was with him.[28][29] The music director Jaikishan later negotiated a reconciliation between the two.[30]\n\nEarly 1970s[edit]\n\nIn early 1970s, Rafi recorded fewer songs. At the same period Kishore Kumar's popularity increased due to the songs he sang for the film Aradhana.[28][31] The music for Aradhana was composed by S. D. Burman, and he had used Rafi as the male playback voice for the first two recorded duets, \"Baaghon Mein Bahaar Hai\" and \"Gunguna Rahen Hain Bhanwre\".[17] After these two recordings, S. D. Burman fell ill and his son and assistant, R.D. Burman, took over the recordings. R. D. Burman got Kishore Kumar to sing the solos \"Roop Tera Mastana\" and \"Mere Sapnon Ki Rani\".\n\nDuring 1971-1973, Rafi's musical output decreased; however, he did sing several songs.[32] Some of Rafi's songs of the early 1970s were with music directors like Laxmikant-Pyarelal, Madan Mohan, R.D. Burman and S. D. Burman. These include \"Tum Mujhe Yun Bhula Na Paoge\" (a signature song of Rafi in 1971) from Pagla Kahin Ka, \"Yeh Duniya Yeh Mehfil\" from Heer Ranjha (1970), \"Jhilmil Sitaron ka\" from Jeevan Mrityu (a duet with Lata Mangeshkar, 1970), \"Gulabi Aankhen\" from The Train (1970), \"Yeh Jo Chilman Hain\" and \"Itna to Yaad Hain Mujhe\" from Mehboob Ki Mehndi (1971), \"Mera Mann Tera Pyasa\" Gambler, \"Chalo Dildar Chalo\" from 1972 released Pakeezah, \"Chura Liya Hain Tumne\" from Yaadon Ki Baarat (a duet with Asha Bhosle, 1973), \"Na tu Zameen Ke liye\" from 1973 released Dilip Kumar movie Dastan, \"Tum Jo Mil Gaye Ho\" from Hanste Zakhm (1973), \"teri bindiya re\", from Abhimaan (1973) and \"Aaj Mausam Bada Beimaan Hai\" from Loafer (1973.)\n\nLater years[edit]\n\nRafi made a comeback as a leading singer in 1974. That year, he won the Film World magazine Best Singer Award for the song \"Teree Galiyon Mein Na Rakhenge Qadam Aaj Ke Baad\" (Hawas, 1974) composed by Usha Khanna.[16]\n\nIn 1977, he won both Filmfare Award and the National Award for the song \"Kya Hua Tera Wada\" from the movie Hum Kisise Kum Naheen, composed by R.D. Burman.[17] Rafi sang for Rishi Kapoor in films like Laila Majnu (for which music was given by two composers Madan Mohan, and after his death by Jaidev), Amar Akbar Anthony (1977), Sargam (1979) and Karz (1980). The qawwali \"Pardah Hai Pardah\" from Amar Akbar Anthony (1977) was a superhit. Rafi's notable renderings in the late 1970s and early 1980s include Bairaag (1976), Laila Majnu (1976), Apnapan (1978), Suhaag (1979), Qurbani, Dostana (1980), The Burning Train (1980), Naseeb (1981), Abdullah (1980), Shaan (1980), Asha (1980), Aap To Aise Na The (1980), and Zamane Ko Dikhana Hai (1982).\n\nIn December 1979, Rafi recorded six songs for the Hindi remake of Dilip Sen's Bengali superhit Sorry Madam; the film was never completed due to a personal tragedy in Dilip Sen's life. These songs, written by Kafeel Aazar and composed by Chitragupta, were released digitally in December 2009 by the label Silk Road under the title \"The Last Songs\". The physical album was released only in India by Universal.\n\nGuinness World Records controversy[edit]\n\nDuring his last years, Rafi was involved in a controversy over Lata Mangeshkar's entry in the Guinness Book of World Records. In a letter dated 11 June 1977 to the Guinness Book of World Records, Rafi had challenged the claim that Lata Mangeshkar has recorded the maximum number of songs (\"not less than 25,000\" according to Guinness). After receiving a reply from Guinness, in a letter dated 20 November 1979, he wrote, \"I am disappointed that my request for a reassessment vis-a-vis Ms Mangeshkar's reported world record has gone unheeded.\"[26] In an interview to BBC recorded in November 1977, Rafi claimed to have sung 25,000 to 26,000 songs till then.[19]\n\nAfter Rafi's death, in its 1984 edition, the Guinness Book of World Records gave Lata Mangeshkar's name for the \"Most Recordings\" and stated, \"Mohammad Rafi (d 1 August 1980) [sic] claimed to have recorded 28,000 songs in 11 Indian languages between 1944 and April 1980.\"[33] According to the available figures, Rafi has sung 4,516 Hindi film songs, 112 non-Hindi film songs, and 328 private (non-film) songs from 1945 to 1980.[33] The Guinness Book entries for Rafi and Lata were removed in 1991.[34] In 2011, Lata's sister Asha Bhosle was given the title.[35]\n\nDeath[edit]\n\nRafi died at 10:50 p.m. on 31 July 1980, following a heart attack.[36] His last song was \"Shaam phir kyun udaas hai dost\" (Aas Paas), which he had recorded with Laxmikant-Pyarelal a few hours before his death.[26][37]\n\nRafi was buried at the Juhu Muslim cemetery.[38] His was one of the biggest funeral processions Mumbai had ever witnessed, with over 10,000 people attending.[39][40]\n\nIn 2010, his tomb was demolished to make space for new burials. Fans of Mohammed Rafi who visit his tomb twice a year to mark his birth and death anniversary use the coconut tree nearest to his grave as a marker.[41]\n\nLegacy[edit]\n\nSingers like Shabbir Kumar, Mohammed Aziz and, more recently, Sonu Nigam, made their names by adopting Rafi's style.[42]\n\nOn 22 September 2007, a shrine to Rafi designed by artist Tasawar Bashir was unveiled on Fazeley Street, Birmingham, UK. Bashir is hoping that Rafi will attain sainthood as a result.[43][44] The Padma Shri Mohammed Rafi Chowk in the Bandra suburb of Mumbai and Pune (extending MG Road) is named after Rafi.[45]\n\nIn the summer of 2008, the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra released a double CD titled Rafi Resurrected comprising 16 songs by Rafi. Bollywood playback singer Sonu Nigam provided the vocals for this project and toured with the CBSO in July 2008 at venues including the English National Opera in London, Manchester's Apollo Theatre and Symphony Hall, Birmingham.[46]\n\nIn June 2010, Rafi along with Lata Mangeshkar was voted the most popular playback singer in the Outlook Music Poll, conducted by Outlook magazine.[47] The same poll voted \"Man re, tu kahe na Dheer Dhare\" (Chitralekha, 1964), sung by Rafi as the #1 song.[48] Three songs were tied for the #2 place: Two were sung by Rafi. The songs were \"Tere Mere Sapne Ab Ek Rang Hain\" (Guide, 1965) and \"Din Dhal Jaye, hai raat na jaye\" (Guide, 1965). This poll was published in Outlook. The jury included people in the Indian music industry: Abhijeet, Adesh Srivastava, Alisha Chinai, Anu Malik, Ehsaan, Gulzar, Hariharan, Himesh Reshammiya, Jatin, Javed Akhtar, Kailash Kher, Kavita Krishnamurthy, Khayyam, Kumar Sanu, Lalit, Loy, Mahalaxmi Iyer, Mahendra Kapoor, Manna Dey, Prasoon Joshi, Rajesh Roshan, Sadhna Sargam, Sameer, Sandesh Shandilya, Shaan, Shankar, Shantanu Moitra, Shreya Ghoshal, Sonu Nigam and Talat Aziz.[49]\n\nIn an article in Times of India, Rafi is described as \"a versatile singer, who could render classical, rock and roll, indeed any kind of song with ease, he was Hindi film's, favourite male voice through the 1950s and 1960s\". Music director Rajesh Roshan, who composed some of the songs with Rafi, remembers him as \"a warm-hearted simple person with no ego\".[50]\n\nThere have been appeals [51] to the Government of India to honour the singer, posthumously, with the Bharat Ratna (India's Highest Civilian Award)[11]\n\nClassical and playback singer Manna Dey, who was also a contemporary of Rafi said, \"Rafi and I could sing everything, and he was such a gentleman. He was a better singer than me, and I will say this - that no one came even close to him! He deserved everything he got! We had a great understanding and it was never about one-upmanship\".[52][53] Veteran actor Shammi Kapoor said, \"I am incomplete without Mohammad Rafi. I used to often go for the recording of my song, which was sung by Mohammad Rafi, only because I used to like telling him how I would perform on this song on screen so that he can sing it that way. Even he liked my involvement\".[54]\n\nOver 9,000 musical tributes were organized in July 2011 commemorating the 31st anniversary of the singer's death.[55] A documentary about Rafi’s life is under production by the Films Division of India.[56]\n\nRafi's Baharon Phool Barsao was voted the most popular Hindi song in a BBC Asia Network poll commemorating 100 years of Hindi Cinema.[57] In a CNN-IBN survey in 2013, he was voted the greatest voice of Hindi Cinema.[58]\n\nPopular culture[edit]\n\nMohammed Rafi Academy was launched in Mumbai on 31 July 2010 on the 30th anniversary of the singer's death, started by his son Sahid Rafi to impart training in Indian classical and contemporary music.[59][60]\n\nAfter his death, seven Hindi movies were dedicated to Mohd Rafi: Allah Rakha, Mard, Coolie, Desh-Premee, Naseeb, Aas-Paas and Heeralal-Pannalal.[citation needed]\n\nRafi is one of the recording artists mentioned in the 1997 hit British alternative rock song \"Brimful of Asha\" by Cornershop.\n\nRafi's song from the film Gumnaam (1965), \"Jaan Pehechan Ho\", was used on the soundtrack of Ghost World (2001). The film opens with the lead character dancing around in her bedroom to a video of Gumnaam.[61] The song has also been used for Heineken's 2011 \"The Date\" commercial.[62][63]\n\nHis \"Aaj Mausam Bada Beiman Hai\" is featured in the 2001 film Monsoon Wedding.[64] His song \"Mera Man Tera Pyasa\" (Gambler, 1970) has been used as one of the soundtracks in the Jim Carrey-Kate Winslet starrer Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (2004). This song is played in the background in Kate Winslet's character's home while the lead pair are having a drink (at approximately 00.11.14 runtime).[65]\n\nPersonal life[edit]\n\nRafi married twice; his first marriage was to his cousin; Bashira[66] and took place in his ancestral village.[67] The marriage ended when his first wife refused to live in India following the killing of her parents during the riots of Partition of India and moved to Lahore, Pakistan.[68]\n\nRafi had four sons and three daughters. He was very much a family man, following a recording-room, to home and to recording-room itinerary. He rarely attended film parties, did not smoke or drink, was religious, and was considered a humble man.[69] He used to perform his riyaz (musical practice) regularly. His only indulgences were playing carom, badminton, and flying kites.[11]\n\n197,440 items / 1,619,963 views\n\nThis was shot at the audio launch of Mumbai 118 , Aditya and I are Facebook friends we had met years back through Mr Umesh Mehra of Eagle Films..and than connected on cyberspace.\n\nAditya invited me for the audio launch of his film I was skeptical as I walk barefeet , so I told Aditya he said just come with your smile I took my camera instead.\n\nAditya Raj Kapoor is a very humble down to earth human being he visited my house to see my grand daughter 3 year old Marziya Shakir worlds youngest street photographer who shoots on the Nikon D 80.\n\nAditya Raj Kapoor lost his father the doyen rocking star of the film Industry Mr Shammi Kapoor Saab..on 14 Aug 2011 , he was being treated at Breach Candy for a chest infection but die due to renal failure.\n\nHe was cremated at Banganga Walkeshwar on 15 Aug 2011..\n\nAbout Shammi Kapoor\n\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\nShammi Kapoor (born Shamsher Raj Kapoor; 21 October 1931[3] – 14 August 2011) was an Indian film actor and director.

He received the Filmfare Best Actor Award in 1968 for his performance in Brahmachari and Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actor for Vidhaata in 1982.\n\nHe was given the name Shamsher Raj Kapoor at his birth in Mumbai to film and theatre actor Prithviraj Kapoor and Ramsarni Mehra. Shammi was the second of the three sons born to Prithviraj (the other two being Raj Kapoor and Shashi Kapoor), both successful Bollywood actors. Though born in Mumbai, he spent a major portion of his childhood in Kolkata, where his father was involved with New Theatres Studios, acting in films. It was in Kolkata that he did his Montessory and Kindergarten. After coming back to Mumbai, he first went to St. Joseph's Convent (Wadala) and then, to Don Bosco School. He finished his matric schooling from New Era School at Hughes Road.\n\nShammi Kapoor had a short stint at Ruia College, in Matunga, Mumbai, after which he joined his father’s theatrical company \"Prithvi Theatres\". He entered the cinema world in 1948, as a junior artiste, at a salary of Rs. 50 per month, stayed with Prithvi Theatres for the next four years and collected his last paycheck, Rs. 300, in 1952. He made his debut in Bollywood in the year 1953, when the film Jeevan Jyoti was released. It was directed by Mahesh Kaul and Chand Usmani was Kapoor’s first heroine.\n\nKapoor started out with serious roles but with Filmistan's Nasir Hussain directed Tumsa Nahin Dekha (1957) opposite Ameeta and Dil Deke Dekho (1959) with Asha Parekh, he attained the image of a light-hearted, stylish playboy. Tall, athletic, lively, fair complexioned, green-eyed and with handsome features, Shammi was a heartthrob, and his good looks and physique complemented his image. Both the films were debut films of the respective actresses Ameeta and Asha Parekh and both went on to be big hits and are regarded as classics.\n\nWith Junglee (1961) his new image was cemented and his subsequent films were all in this genre. He particularly chose Mohammed Rafi as his playback voice. In his early career in fifties, he had often played second fiddle to established heroines like Madhubala in films such as Rail Ka Dibba (1953) and Naqab, \"Laila Majnu\" with Nutan, \"Thokar\" with Shyama and \"Hum Sab Chor Hain\" with Nalini Jaiwant none of them clicked at box office. But producers after 1960 apart from the actresses from southern India, loved pairing Shammi with new heroines, three of them became huge stars in their own right in Hindi films: Asha Parekh, Saira Banu, and Sharmila Tagore.[4] Of all his heroines, he said that Sharmila Tagore, Rajshree, and Asha Parekh were easy to work with.[5] Sharmila Tagore and Saira Banu made their Bollywood debuts with Shammi Kapoor in ‘Kashmir Ki Kali’ and ‘Junglee’ respectively[6] He and Asha Parekh were paired together in four films, the most successful being besides debut film of Asha Parekh, the murder mystery Teesri Manzil (1966) and romantic film Jawan Mohabbat.\n\nIn the early fifties he accepted serious roles in women oriented films like Shama Parwana (1954), comedy flick Mem Sahib (1956) and thrillers like Chor Bazar (1954), which were all successful at box office and in tragic love story Mirza Sahiban (1957) (a box office flop), but did not gain recognition and fame among the masses. Other than the above hits, he had fifteen films as flops to his credit till 1957. The other hits in late fifties included Mujrim(1958), Char Dil Char Rahen, Raat Ke Raahi (1959).His performances in K A Abbas' Char Dil Char Raahein (1959) and Kidar Sharma's Rangeen Raatein (1956) were also noteworthy but remained underfeted.[7] It was only after triple success of Tumsa Nahi Dekha (1957), Ujala and Dil Dil Deke Deko (both 1959), that he became popular with the audience and became a star. In the first half of the 1960s, Kapoor was seen in successful films like College Girl, Basant, Singapore, Boy Friend, Professor, Dil Tera Diwana, Vallah Kya Baat Hai, Pyar Kiya To Darna Kya, China Town, Kashmir Ki Kali, Bluff Master, Janwar and Rajkumar. Although nominated before, in 1968, he received the first Filmfare Best Actor award of his career for the film Bramhachari.He made a unique place for himself in the industry as he was the only dancing hero in Hindi Films from the late fifties till early seventies.Saira Banu said in an interview \"At the time when Dilip sahab, Raj Kapoor and Dev Anand ruled the industry, it was Shammi Kapoor who created a niche for himself with his unique dance moves. He used to say he didn't know how to dance but he would just listen to the music and feel it. He was the only 'dancing hero' at that time.\"[8]He used to compose dancing steps by himself in the songs picturised on him and never needed a choreographer.This earned him the name of Elvis Presley of India.[9]\n\nHis pairing opposite Southern heroines were always a success at the box office. He delivered hits opposite B. Saroja Devi like Pyaar Kiya To Darna Kya and Preet Na Jane Reet, with Padmini gave Singapore (1960 film), opposite Vyjayanthimala had hits like College Girl and Prince (1969 film). In the sixties his successful run continued untill new romantic incon Rajesh Khanna entered the scene in 1969.[10] However Shammi did have commercial successes in late sixties, like Budtameez and Sachaai with Sadhana, Latt Saheb with Nutan and Tumse Achha Kaun Hai with Babita.\n\nIn the 1970s, Kapoor’s weight problem proved an obstacle in his path of success and ended his career as a romantic hero as his films started failing. His last hit film, in which he played the lead role, was Andaz (1971). With time, he moved to character roles and acted in films like Zameer, Hero, Vidhaata, Hukumat, Batwara, Tahalka, Chamatkar, Namak and Prem Granth. In 1974, he\n\ndonned the hat of a director and made Manoranjan in 1974 and Bundal Baaz (1976). However, both the films failed to create magic at the box office though were critically acclaimed and have a cult fan following over the years. His last appearance as a character actor was in the delayed 2006 film, Sandwich and in early 2011, he decided to act with his grand-nephew Ranbir Kapoor, the grandson of his brother Raj Kapoor.\n\nShammi turned into a successful supporting actor in the 70's, playing Saira Banu's father in Zameer (1974), when he had been her leading man a decade earlier in Junglee (1961) and Bluff Master (1964) and playing Amitabh Bachchan's foster father in Parvarish. He also directed Manoranjan (1974), a movie inspired from Irma La Douce and in which he played a supporting role himself and Bundal Baaz (1976) starring Rajesh Khanna, but neither were successful commercially though got critical acclaims and were hailed as classics and to be ahead of its time. In the 1980s and 1990s, he continued to play supporting roles in many films and won a Filmfare Best Supporting Actor Award for his performance in Vidhaata (1982).He got the opportunity to do some films in other languages such as Bengali and Tamil in the nineties. He did a social melodrama serial called \"Chattan\" aired in Zee TV for more than a year in 90's. He eventually cut down on film appearances by the late 1990s and early 2000s and made his appearances in the 1999 Salman Khan and Urmila Matondkar starring Jaanam Samjha Karo, 2002 release Waah! Tera Kya Kehna and delayed 2006 release Sandwich. He made his last appearance in Imtiaz Ali's directorial venture Rockstar co-starring his grand-nephew Ranbir Kapoor, the grandson of his brother Raj Kapoor.\n\nFilm director Shakti Samanta directed Shammi Kapoor in six hit films like Singapore, Pagla Kahin Ka, China Town, Kashmir Ki Kali, An Evening In Paris and Jaane Anjane and quoted in an interview “I found Shammi to be a thoroughly good man. Even in his heydays, he was humble.\"[11]\n\nShammi Kapoor, in 1953, dated Nadia Gamal, a belly dancer from Cairo.[12] Shammi quoted in an interview that \"We met in Ceylon and we were in love. Somehow things did not work out and she went back to Cairo.\"[13] Shammi Kapoor met Geeta Bali in 1955, during the shooting of the film 'Rangeen Raaten', where he was the leading actor and she played a cameo. Geeta Bali was well established heroine, popular star at this point of time and Shammi had not tasted any success. They fell in love during the outdoor stints of the movie at Ranikhet, an ancient Army based hill-station in the Kumaon region, but since she was a year older to him and had acted with his elder brother in \"Bawren Nain\" and his father in \"Anand Math\", they were sceptical. Four months after they first met, they married at Banganga Temples, near Napean Sea Road of Mumbai with Hari Walia as the sole witness. They informed their parents only after their marriage. Geeta Bali also did cameo in Shammi starrer Mujrim(1958). They were paired together in Miss Coca Cola, a box office dud and Coffee House. After thier mairrage Geeta Bali acted in 14 films and retired from film industry.Geeta Nali's last film as the lead heroine in a film was Jab Se Tumhe Dekha Hai opposite Pradeep Kumar, in which Shammi Kapoor and Shashi Kapoor made special appearances.\n\nShammi and Geeta lived a life of bliss in the coming years. They had a son, Aditya Raj Kapoor, on 1 July 1956, at Shirodkar's Hospital, Mumbai, a year after they were married. Five years later, in 1961, they had a daughter, Kanchan.\n\nTragedy struck in 1965, during the filming of Teesri Manzil. Geeta died of small pox, leaving Shammi with two small children.\n\nIn 1969, he married Neela Devi Gohil from the former royal family of Bhavnagar in Gujarat. He was gaining weight rather significantly now and this ended his career as a romantic hero in the early 1970s. Andaz (1971) was one of his last hits.\n\nShammi Kapoor was the founder and chairman of Internet Users Community of India (IUCI). He had also played a major role in setting up internet organisations like the Ethical Hackers Association. Kapoor also maintained a website dedicated to the 'Kapoor family’. [14]\n\nIn 2006, he told interviewers that he underwent dialysis three times a week. Irrepressible even then, this punishing regimen has failed to depress him. Rather, he said that he was thankful to God for giving him so much.\n\nHe died of renal failure around 5:15am on 14 August 2011 at Mumbai's Breach Candy hospital, where he was undergoing treatment for chest infection.[3].\n\n251,941 items / 2,068,496 views\n\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\nLakshmi puja is a Hindu ritual performed during Diwali, the festival of lights. According to tradition people would put small oil lamps outside their homes on Diwali and hope Lakshmi will come to bless them.\n\nGoddess Lakshmi is worshipped by those who wish to acquire or to preserve wealth. It is believed that Lakshmi (wealth) goes only to those houses which are clean and where the people are hardworking. She does not visit the places which are unclean/dirty or where the people are lazy.\n\nIn the Sri Vaishnava philosophy however, Sri (Lakshmi) is honoured as the \"Iswarigm sarva bhootanam\" i.e. the Supreme goddess and not just the goddess of wealth. This is an important distinction between Sri Vaishnavism and other materialistic philosophies.\n\nThe third day of the festival of Diwali is the most important day of Lakshmi-puja and is entirely devoted to the propitiation of Goddess Lakshmi. On this very day sun enters his second course and passes Libra which is represented by the balance or scale. Hence, this design of Libra is believed to have suggested the balancing of account books and their closing. Despite the fact that this day falls on an amavasya day it is regarded as the most auspicious.\n\nThe day of Lakshmi-Puja falls on the dark night of Amavasya. The strains of joyous sounds of bells and drums float from the temples as man is invoking Goddess Lakshmi in a wondrous holy \"pouring-in\" of his heart. All of a sudden that impenetrable darkness is pierced by innumerable rays of light for just a moment and the next moment a blaze of light descends down to earth from heaven as golden-footed Deep-Lakshmi alights on earth in all her celestial glory amidst chantings of Vedic hymns.\n\nA sublime light of knowledge dawns upon humanity and this self enlightenment is expressed through the twinkling lamps that illuminate the palaces of thewealthy as well as the lowly abodes of the poor. It is believed that on this day Lakshmi walks through the green fields and loiters through the bye-lanes and showers her blessings on man for plenty and prosperity.\n\nAfter Lakshmi Puja, lamps are lit all over the house\n\nLakshmi Puja, or the worship of the goddess of wealth, is the main event on Diwali in North and West India. It is extremely important to keep the house spotlessly clean and pure on Diwali. Goddess Lakshmi likes cleanliness, and she will visit the cleanest house first. This is also the reason why the broom is worshiped on this day with offerings of haldi and kumkum (turmeric and vermilion). Lamps are lit in the evening to welcome the goddess. They are believed to light up Her path.\n\nLakshmi Puja consists of a combined puja of five deities: Ganesha is worshiped at the beginning of every auspicious act as Vighneshvara; Goddess Lakshmi is worshiped in her three forms - Mahalakshmi (the goddess of wealth and money), Mahasaraswati (the goddess of books and learning), and Mahakali; Kuber (the treasurer of the gods) is also worshiped.\n\nLakshmi Puja for 2012 falls on Tuesday, 13th November.\n\nInitially the house must be cleaned, and a Rangoli is drawn at the doorstep in order to welcome Goddess Lakshmi.\n\nThe Puja requires the following elements:\n\n[edit]The Ritual Elements\n\nSilver and Gold coins\n\nTen Betel Nuts (Supari)\n\nUncooked Rice\n\nFive Paan or Mango leaves\n\nA Coconut\n\nWater in a small pot (a \"Lota\")\n\nRed vermillon (\"Kumkum\") for applying the tilak\n\nOil Lamps (\"Diyas\")\n\nHoli-type colored powders\n\nIndian sweets (Mithai)\n\nCamphor\n\nIncense sticks (Agarbatti)\n\nDry fruits (almonds, cashews)\n\nA Thali\n\nRose or other flower petals\n\nRaksha Sutra* A new notebook\n\nPanchamrita\n\nA piece of red cloth for putting the puja items\n\nGhee to light the lamps\n\nRose water\n\nWater\n\nIcons of:\n\nGanesha\n\nSaraswati\n\nLakshmi\n\nNarayana\n\nSteps of Lakshmi Puja Spread a new cloth on a raised platform: Place a handful of grains in the center and, on this, place a kalash (pitcher) made of gold, silver, copper, or terracotta. Fill three-fourth of the kalash with water and place a betel nut, a flower, a coin, and some rice grains in it. Arrange five kinds of leaves or mango leaves in the kalash. Place a small dish on the kalash and fill it with rice grains. Draw a lotus with turmeric powder ( haldi ) over the rice grains and place the idol of goddess Lakshmi over it, along with coins.\n\nPlace the idol of Ganesha: In front of the kalash, on the right (South-West direction), place the idol of Ganesha. Also place ink and books related to your business or occupation on the platform. Light a lamp and begin the puja by offering haldi, kumkum, and flowers to the platform on which the kalash is placed. Then offer haldi, kumkum, and flowers to the water that is to be used for the puja. Invoke the river goddesses to be part of this water.\n\nInvoke goddess: Lakshmi by reciting the Vedic mantras addressed to her. One can also recite the mantras mentioned in the Puranas or simply take some flowers in your hands, close your eyes, and think of goddess Lakshmi being showered with gold coins by two elephants standing on either side of Her and chant Her name. Then offer the flowers to the idol.\n\nPlace the idol of Lakshmi: Place the idol of Lakshmi in a plate and bathe it with water, panchamrit (a mixture of milk, curd, ghee or clarified butter, honey, and sugar) and then with water containing some gold ornament or a pearl. Wipe the idol clean and place it back on the kalash. Alternately, you can just sprinkle water and panchamrit on the idol with a flower.\n\nOfferings: Offer sandal paste, saffron paste, perfume ( itr ), haldi, kumkum, abeer, and gulal to the goddess. Offer a garland of cotton beads to the goddess. Offer flowers, especially the marigold flowers and leaves of Bel (wood apple tree). Light an incense stick and dhoop. Make an offering of sweets, coconut, fruits, and tambul. Make an offering of puffed rice and batasha. Pour some puffed rice, batasha, coriander seeds, and cumin seeds over the idol. Safe where you keep money and jewelry; Worship this safe as a symbol of Lord Kuber.\n\nAarti: Finally, perform the aarti for goddess Lakshmi. Always remember that She abhors loud noise. So the aarti should be accompanied only by a small bell. Do not clap hands, as is the practice when performing aarti for other gods. A peaceful and sublime atmosphere should prevail during the diwali day pujan. Do not light crackers while the puja is on or immediately after it.\n\n[edit]Offering Prayers to Goddess Lakshmi\n\n[May need English translation] not available\n\nOm Jai Laxmi Mata, Maiya Jai Laxmi Mata,\n\nTumko nis din sevat, Maiya ji ko nis din sevat\n\nHari Vishnu Data\n\nOm Jai Laxmi Mata (Repeat above verse)\n\nUma Ramaa Brahmaani, Tum hi Jag Mata,Maiya Tum hi Jag Mata,\n\nSurya Chandra Ma dhyaavat, Surya Chandra Ma dhyaavat\n\nNaarad Rishi gaata.\n\nOm Jai Laxmi Mata.\n\nDurga Roop Niranjani, Sukh Sampati Data, Maiya Sukh Sampati Data\n\nJo koyee tumko dhyaavat, Jo koyee tumko dhyaavat\n\nRidhi Sidhi dhan paataa\n\nOm Jai Laxmi Mata.\n\nTum Pataalani Nivasini, Tum hi Shubh Data, Maiya tum hi Shubh Data\n\nKarma Prabhaav Prakaashini, Karma Prabhaav Prakaashini\n\nBhuv Niddhi ke praata\n\nOm Jai Laxmi Mata\n\nJis ghar tum rehti teh, sab sath goon aataa, Maiya sab sath goon aataa,\n\nSaab sambhav hojata jataa, Saab sambhav hojata jataa\n\nMan naheen ghabraataa.\n\nOm Jai Laxmi Mata\n\nTum Bin Yaghya na hote, vaastra na ho paata, Maiya vaastra na ho paata,\n\nKhana paan ka vaibhav, Khana paan ka vaibhav\n\nSab tumse aata\n\nOm Jai Laxmi Mata\n\nShubh Goon Mandir sunder, shero da di jaata, Maiya shero da di jaata\n\nRatna chaturdashi tum bin, Ratna chaturdashi tum bin\n\nKoi nahi paata\n\nOm Jai Laxmi Mata.\n\nMaha Laxmiji ki Aarti, jo koi nar gaata, Maiya jo koi nar gaata,\n\nPur aananda samata, Pur aananda samata,\n\nPaap utar jaata\n\nOm Jai Laxmi Mata.\n\nOm Jai Laxmi Mata, Maiya Jai Laxmi Mata,\n\nTumko nis din sevat, maiya ji ko nis din sevat\n\nHari Vishnu Data\n\nOm Jai Laxmi Mata (Repeat above verse)\n\nThe famous afghan artist, singer, TV host, director & Martial arts champion\n\nThe first host of “Who wants to be Millionaire” TV game show in Afghanistan.\n\nAryan Khan who is basically from Afghanistan is an actor, singer, model, a former master in Martial arts (Taekwondo) champion and Lollywood (Pakistan film industry) actor!\n\nAryan Khan, a famous Afghan artist whit his beautiful voice and ability in cinema field has demonstrated much competence in different arts.
