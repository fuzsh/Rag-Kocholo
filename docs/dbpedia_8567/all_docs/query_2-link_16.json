However the latest update is that the two have patched up. And if the rumour mills are to be believed then the producer of the show Sunil Agnihotri is responsible for getting the actors together. A source informs, “Raja is known for being short-tempered and his co-actor Santosh Shukla also couldn’t maintain his calm and an argument snowballed into an ugly spat a few days ago. The actors have been working together on the sets of Kahani Chandrakanta Ki for a few months now and they have been good friends and also shared the same make up room. However, during an outdoor shoot just one make up room was available and Santosh was busy getting his make up done. He received a phone call and walked out of the room, in the meantime Raja walked in and asked for his make up to be done. However, Santosh was back and he was surprised to see Raja there. This is when he asked Raja to get his make up done later as his scene was to be shot later. This lead to an argument between the two which turned into an ugly spat and they stopped talking to each other.” “However, the two have now sorted out their differences and they are back to being friends and the peacemaker was none other than producer Sunil Agnihotri.” We spoke to Santosh who confirmed the news and said, “We are all humans and we have issues. I have never had any complaint against Raja but that day we just got into an argument, and thanks to Sunil ji we are friends once again.” Raja denied the whole incident and said, “I am not Santosh’s friend, it’s just that we work on the same show but we hardly have any shots together. As far as the rumours are concerned, they are not right. People just take advantage of my name because I don’t react to such things.”\n\nLike\n\n0\n\nLove\n\n0\n\nHaha\n\n0\n\nYay\n\n0\n\nWow\n\n0\n\nSad\n\n0\n\nAngry\n\n0\n\nSubscribe Here"
