R. Murugadoss\n\nMusic by Songs:\n\nSajid-Wajid\n\nDevi Sri Prasad\n\nAmal Malik\n\nBackground Score:\n\nSandeep Shirodkar Cinematography Santosh Thundiyil Editing by Harsh Tiwari\n\nSalman Khan is back after Ek Tha Tiger and what do we have this time? It’s actually an extended version of him. Jai Ho is about an ex army officer Jai Aghniotri who is a gem of a person with a violent streak. Why the violent streak? Because he is petrified and irritated with the country’s situation. He wants to change the country’s situation. More or less, he wants it to change. So, he starts a chain. That chain states: “Thank you mat boliye, instead 3 logon ki madad (help) kijiye aur un teen logon ko boliye, ki vo bhi aisa karen. Karke dekhiye, acha lagta hai.”\n\nWe know our country, right? We commit to any and almost everything but when we should actually do it, we back out. This is what happens over here. People start making excuses. Eventually, Jai is dazzled by this. Specially after so many tragic events! A disabled girl committed suicide because no one agreed to help her write her exam, one little girl who’s begging on the road…she gets bullied by a man and her father is busy playing cards, as she is forced into this hideous activity. After that he finds a baby, stolen by a beggar. All these incidents affect him a lot and he is totally confused and worried. Why can’t other people see all this? He often questions himself.\n\nTHIS IS THE REALITY! THIS HAPPENS EVERYWHERE (IN INDIA, OF COURSE) BUT ARE WE BOTHERED? NO!\n\nSalman Khan has always been criticised, people say that he does senseless cinema and his films are pointless. Some said the same thing, even after watching Jai Ho. Specially the critics.(I am a freelance critic myself but not like the others)\n\nJai Ho may not be cinematic, it may not have the best music but it has a beautiful soul. It unintentionally shows us the real India.\n\nIf corruption in this country won’t stop, this is exactly how we’ll have to deal with the country. We will have to fight for our own rights. We look at disabled people, we look at beggars (specially the kids) and we express grief. We pity them. WHY? Is pitying everything? Why can’t we stand up and help them? Help them live their lives with pride and equality.\n\nTeen logon ki help karen, doesn’t mean that you should just help three people. It’s a way of saying that help AT LEAST 3 people.\n\nCalculate it! 3 people, then 3 and then 3 more, etc etc! It will change this country for sure. For a better India, for a better environment, implement these ideas!\n\nSalman Khan recently said that he’s a below average actor. I’d like to disagree with him. He is the most honest actor we have in this industry. He didn’t play a character, he felt it. He was natural and delightful. When he cried, for the first time he had this natural streak in him. As if, he’s crying because this actually happened to him. When he shouted and smashed the goons, it felt as if he is taking out his real frustration. (He had expressed that in an interview, after the Nirbhaya case) Salman Khan’s screen presence is WOW and after a long time, he is back in shape and that is how a star looks. His shirtless scene has its suspense but it ends up seeking a crazy applause. After a long time, specially in a multiplex…I experienced the craziness where people whistled for him, hooted for him, kids started dancing when his song came up and started shouting “Maaro Maaro” when he slammed those goons.\n\nNow that’s a Superstar!\n\nDaisy Shah makes an impressive debut. She is a fabulous dancer, no doubt. But she can act too, couldn’t explore it that much over here but there is certainly some spark in her. She is really cute. Tabu, as always she is a treat to watch. The finest actress we have ever produced. Sana Khan didn’t have much scope but whatever she had, she did it quite convincingly. Same goes for Santosh Shukla. Mukul Dev is brilliant. I thought he was better than Danny sir. But even Danny sir did a good job. Mohnish Bahl is soothing and the rest, they are good in their respective bit.\n\nSpecial mention: Naman Jain, as Salman’s nephew…he is IMPECCABLE. His comedy timing is BANG ON and he is surely gonna go a long way. He is versatile as we’ve seen him in Bombay Talkies where he played a boy who wanted to be Sheila. He is certainly the highlight of Jai Ho, after Salman of course.\n\nSecondly, Sudesh Lahiri in his typical Lahiri avtar. He is just too funny.\n\nThe music is disappointing as Sajid-Wajid are stuck somewhere in the past. I don’t know why. Same tunes again and again. Amal Malik and Armaan Malik, their songs: Tumko Toh Aana Hi Tha, Love You Till The End and Jai Jai Jai Jai Ho, they save the album. Upcoming talents!\n\nThough the background score is amazing. Kudos to that! The cinematography is beautiful and Sohail Khan has also done a decent job as the director.\n\nOverall, Jai Ho is a problem solver for us if we understand the sentiments of this film. Being rich and famous, it isn’t that tough. But being human? It’s the toughest of them all. If we learn something from this and implement that, we will end up becoming better human beings for sure.\n\nCRITICAL RATING: 3/5\n\nFAN RATING: INFINITY\n\nCast: Madhuri Dixit (Begum Para), Arshad Warsi (Razzaakh Hussain alias Babban), Naseeruddin Shah (Ifthekhar alias Khalujan), Huma Qureshi (Muniya), Vijay Raaz (Jaan Mohammad), Manoj Pahwa (Nawab Italwa) and Salman Shahid (Mushtaq)\n\nDirector: Abhishek Chaubey\n\nStory: Darab Farooqui\n\nScreenplay: Abhishek Chaubey, Vishal Bhardwaj and Gulzar\n\nCinematography: Setu\n\nEditing: A. Sreekar Prasad\n\nMusic and Dialogues: Vishal Bhardwaj\n\nSometimes we don’t have enough words to describe the beauty of certain things and Dedh Ishqiya is undoubtedly the film that comes under this category. It mesmerises you throughout.\n\nIn 2010, Ishqiya created a different kind of a rage for itself. From the songs to the performances to the chemistries between Vidya Balan and Naseer Saab to the brawny dialogues. It had it all.\n\nAfter 3 years, Babban and Khalujan are back and the opening scene is hilarious. Salman Shahid’s voice is unconventional and too good, it just adds to the “Gilli” scene.\n\nCut to, Babban and Khalu’s new robbery which somehow fell flat as they are caught but they try to escape from there. Khalu is suddenly missing along with the necklace and Babban’s certainly in trouble, but soon he finds out that Khalujan is in Mahmudabad, as he has gone there posing as a nawab, at a poetry contest. It is a mushaira organized by Begum Para (Madhuri Dixit) , the widowed Begum of The Nawab Of Mahmudabad as per the wishes of her deceased husband.The winner would win the Swayamwar and in turn become the Nawab of Mahmudabad. However, Jaan Mohammad (Vijay Raaz) who is actually an MLA-gangster has his eyes on the reign. The story has a lot of thrill along with impeccable comedy and there’s a delightful surprise in the end. Though some scenes do seem a bit stretched but overall, it’s a clear winner.\n\nThe scene where Jaan Mohammad’s gang tries to threaten away Khalu-Babban and both the parties are reluctant to give up. The reluctancy lasted all night and finally is interrupted by the sharp notes of a school assembly singing Hum ko mann ki shakti dena.\n\nKILLER!\n\nThe dialogues, once again! BANG ON. People like me, don’t really understand Urdu but the way it has been narrated, it gives you the idea of what the person wants to convey. (And, of course subtitles are also there)\n\nThe music is peaceful and soothing. Horn Ok Please by Honey Singh and Sukhwinder Singh is decent, Dil Ka Mizaaj Ishqiya by Rahat Fateh Ali Khan, it’s probably the best song of the album. (Rahat saab, after all) Zabaan Jale, again by Rahat saab! Beautiful! Jagaave Saari Raina and Hamari Atariya by Rekha Bhardwaj, songs that touch your heart. Rekha ji’s voice: Nightingale and last but not the least Kya Hoga by Jazim Sharma, Master Saleem, Shahid Maliya and Jamal Akbar, it’s one of the best qawwali’s in recent times. The entire album is a treat. Classical Indian Music, THUMBS UP!\n\nPerformances? Each and every actor is perfect. Arshad Warsi is one of the most underrated actors, we have and once again, he proves his worth. His comic timing is beyond perfection. Naseer saab is so elegant and classy that you learn, every time you watch him on screen. Arshad and Naseer saab are Babban and Khalujaan. Period!\n\nMadhuri Dixit’s comeback is as beautiful as her gorgeous and astonishing eyes. She’s perfect for the role and nobody else could have played Begum Para. Nobody! And Madhuri’s dance in the end, oh my god! No one can dance like her, no one can give those expressions. Be it a 5 year old, or a 14 year old or a 25 year old or even a 60 year old, we all are in awe of you Madhuri.\n\nHuma Qureshi, as usual she’s bang on. Her diction or ‘talafus’ is so perfect and expressions, well… she is probably the best we have (current generation).\n\nVijay Raaz, what can one say about this man? He always gets inside the character and this time he’s loutishly funny. Unforgettable! Jaan Mohammad!\n\nManoj Pahwa’s decent and Salman Shahid leaves a mark.\n\nSPECIAL MENTION- GULZAR SAAB’S LYRICS AND POETRY. WHAT A WRITER!\n\nOverall, Dedh Ishqiya is the perfect new year gift for cinema lovers like me and yes, Bollywood has the capability. Dedh Ishqiya is one prime example. We constantly say that Bollywood has nothing new, except the raunchy dialogues but that’s not true. Such films don’t earn money and that’s why such filmmakers don’t get distributors and producers, so please! WATCH IT, you won’t regret spending your money on this one.\n\nRATING- 4/5\n\nCast: Himansh Kohli, Serah Singh, Rakul Preet Singh, Nicole Faria, Dev Sharma, Shreyas Pardi, Deepti Naval, Gulshan Grover\n\nWriter and Director: Divya Khosla Kumar\n\nScreenplay: Divya Khosla Kumar, Sanjeev Dutta\n\nMusic: Pritam, Mithoon, Yo Yo Honey Singh and Dr. Arko Pravo Mukherjee\n\nLyricists: Irshad Kamil, Amitabh Bhattacharya\n\nEditor: Aarif Sheikh\n\nCinematography: Sameer Arya\n\nDialogues: Sanjeev Dutta\n\nDivya Khosla Kumar marks her debut with ‘Yaariyan’ and whenever she is asked about the film, she confidently gives this answer:\n\n“When I decided to direct a film, I thought a film on the youth would be a great idea. I could pack in every Bollywood ingredient into this story, be it action, romance, masti and more. However, Yaariyan is not mere candy floss; it has a soul and a message. We have tried making the film in a real way. It is a feel good entertainer.”\n\n(Courtesy: Gulf News)\n\nSo after the trailer came out, it caught our attention. Didn’t it? Specially after such an amazing and soothing album, it really got all of us interested in watching Yaariyan. We haven’t had good youth based films in the past, for instance: Gippi. Yaariyan could have been a cult film if it made any sense. It disappoints throughout.\n\nIf this was the real way, I wonder what would have happened if they made it in an unreal way?\n\nThe college is in Sikkim and we hardly see any locals? Okay, let’s start from the beginning as it’s made in a real way.\n\nCollege going boys are not so horny all the time, specially for a kiss. Nowadays, 50-60% of the teenagers have their first kiss before entering college. (And those who don’t, they don’t behave like sex maniacs)\n\nLakshya (Himansh Kohli) disregards his mother and detests his father, as he had given up on himself for the country.\n\n(Old-school) We see him running on the roof top, yes! We’ve seen that in Main Hoon Na.\n\nThe difference? That was Shahrukh and no one can ever look like him. Then, Lakshya struggles to get his first kiss and he’s caught by his principal (Gulshan Grover), predictable stuff. Then he screws up the college play and hence, their principal decides to pick him as the captain of the college team which will compete with an Australian college in order to save their plot in Sikkim. (Hahaha! The plot will make you wonder why you came inside the theatre)\n\nAnd finally, the lead heroine enters- Saloni (Rakul Preet Singh). Another typical filmy entry, as she falls on him and blah blah. She is the geek and with time, she turns into the college hottie. (Who can tell miss Khosla that Bollywood has evolved over the years and all this, it’s just become really old school?)\n\nThe girls have a pyjama party in their hostel and the boys are invited for it. (Another haha moment) It’s a reputed college and that’s the security level over there? Boys can enter the girls hostel at any particular time and stay over night? Laugh out loud.\n\nI can’t write much about the plot because I’m still confused about it.\n\nHimansh Kohli looks like a wannabe and acts like a wannabe, he is good in the emotional scenes. That’s it!\n\nNicole Faria (Jia), she has nothing to do as the director has just kept her for the booby-ness. YES! She has just flaunted and flaunted, nothing else.\n\nDev Sharma (Neil) and Shreyas Pardi (Pardi), both of them are really decent as they don’t have much scope.\n\nSerah Malik (Jenny) looks HOT but again, the director has just focused on her legs and her lips as she’s always sucking a lollipop. (Divya ma’am, that’s not the only way to make someone look hot)\n\nRakul Preet Singh, she is the highlight of the film as she is the only one who can actually “act,” amongst the youngsters I mean. Even though, she doesn’t have A LOT to do, she strikes gold. She’s fresh, she has the intensity and she’s definitely here to stay.\n\nDeepti Naval, Gulshan Grover and Smita Jaykar, all the superlative actors are wasted over here.\n\nJatin Suri (Debu), he has a cameo but he is amazing. He is powerful and I’m sure he has bright future.\n\nThe best scene is the entire film: When Debu’s dying and he is talking about his mother. It’ll get some tears for sure. (The only ‘real’ moment in the film)\n\nThough the entire film is full of spoilers, I’d still like to point out a few:-\n\nOur Indian students and Deepti Naval, they keep conversing in Hindi. (With the Australians, of course) Plus the Australian reciprocates to the dialogue with facial expressions. How did he even understand that? (Hahaha)\n\nLakshya wins the competition in the end, as he turns into some weird superhero and from nowhere, he comes and throws the flag inside the flag holder. (Too much logic? Ehh?)\n\nThe Swayamwar! Why would a girl keep a swayamwar, just to make her boyfriend jealous? STUPIDITY!\n\nThe kiss! It grosses you out. The spit exchange is clearly visible and it’s GROSS. (Incase, Khosla ma’am thought it’s sensuous, no…it’s not.)\n\nAustralians steal our song and in 5 minutes, the band is ready with a full fledged song on Maa and it goes on and on. So much so that after 2 minutes, it is night. WOW!\n\nThe best thing about Yaariyan is it’s music, so save money and listen to the songs. Go watch Dedh Ishqiya instead. That’s a masterpiece!\n\nRATING- 1/5\n\nAbdul Rashid Salim Salman Khan, born on 27th December’1965, the man who’s father created a rage as a scriptwriter, the man who has seen it all, the man who has gone through so many turbulences in life but never complaint about it. He turns 48 today and still looks better than most of us. Some people have been talking crap about him, calling him “budha” and “biased,” I pity such people because they completely forget that he is the one who started the gym factor in India. What will he get by being biased? He has everything, supporting these people it won’t get him anything. He says what he feels, he sticks to his words. Obviously if he’s attached to someone’s family, he can’t be shouting and yelling at them publicly. If we would have been in a similar situation, we would have done the same thing. But, he did point out their mistakes. (Yes, I am talking about Armaan Kohli and Tanisha Mukherjee) He went inside the house as well but most of all, I blame the Bigg Boss team as they have used Salman’s name in a cheap manner, to gain TRP’s. They edited out stuff in such a way that made Salman look bad. He was never against Kushal Tandon, (The man who’s full off arrogance) Salman corrected him because he somehow cared about him but what did Kushal do in return? He made faces and spoke rudely but still, Salman didn’t do anything.\n\nKushal got evicted, people blamed Salman? LOL? If Salman had control over all this, Rajat Rawail would have won this show irrespective of his weird and sissy behaviour. I wish people had the brains to understand this man who has a golden heart.\n\nPeople call him a criminal, a murder? Oh really? It was his driver who was driving the car, it wasn’t him. Anyway, that’s another issue and we have no right to talk about that. It’s his life. People call him a woman-beater? His ex said it an interview that he’s never raised his hand, then why so much of crap? If you do that, it is normal. If Salman does that, it’s an issue? He’s a normal human being, he doesn’t like to live like a star. He still lives where he used to live earlier, even after earning so much. He still goes out cycling, which star does that? Plus, he’s not just a star, he’s a superstar. Which superstar would give his personal examples on a public platform, that too, to strangers? He has said it a zillion times: “I am not a good actor. I do what I feel I can do and I’ve just been lucky. For me, being a good human being is more important than being a good actor. The day I won’t have this stardom and I’ll be able to survive, that day I’ll consider myself as something.”\n\nHe has been a godfather to so many people but he’s never taken credit for that. Be it Sajid Wajid, Himesh Reshamiya, Hrithik Roshan, Katrina Kaif, Sonakshi Sinha, Arjun Kapoor, Mahek Chahal, Daisy Shah, Sana Khan, Santosh Shukla, Zarine Khan, Sneha Ullal, Ashmit Patel, Pulkit Samrat, Athiya Shetty, Suraj Pancholi and the list is never-ending\n\nThis man is the best and no one can ever be like him. I love him more than the world. On Koffee With Karan, when Mr. Salim Khan was speaking, Salman kept quiet and heard him speak rather than interrupting in between, that shows the amount of respect he has for him, till date. If I could be, even 1% of what he actually is, my life would have a meaning and I’ll have a successful life for sure.\n\nHAPPY BIRTHDAY SALMAN KHAN, YOU MIGHT OR MIGHT NOT SEE THIS BUT YOU’RE THE BEST AND I’M YOUR BIGGEST FANNNNN. NOT BECAUSE YOU’RE A SUPERSTAR AND YOU GIVE BLOCKBUSTERS, BUT FOR THE PERSON YOU ARE.\n\nLOVE YOU SO MUCH SIR.\n\nMAY GOD BLESS YOU WITH NEVER-ENDING SUCCESS AND HAPPINESS.\n\nJAI HO & KICK- CHECK.\n\n😀 😀 😀 😀 😀 😀\n\nStory, screenplay and direction: Vijay Krishna Acharya.\n\nProduced by: Aditya Chopra.\n\nStarring: Aamir Khan, Abhishek Bachchan, Uday Chopra, Katrina Kaif, Jackie Shroff and Siddharth Nigam.\n\nMusic: Pritam, Julius Packiam.\n\nBackground Score: Julius Packiam.\n\nCinematography: Sudeep Chatterjee.\n\nEditing– Ritesh Soni.\n\nRomance, comedy, action, thrillers and etc etc. Filmmaking has a lot of genres. The Dhoom series, it’s actually a combo meal for the viewers, as it nearly had all these elements in it.\n\nIn 2004, we saw how YRF came up with this unique idea of making a film on bikers and it had John Abraham, who was playing the villain. Everybody thought it would fail at the box office and it won’t last but, it actually created a rage amongst the youngsters and gave us “John- The Actor.” People said that it’s an Indian version of Joseph Kahn’s Torque but still, it did quite well and people enjoyed the characters.\n\nIn 2006, Dhoom 2 released and broke all the records, becoming a huge blockbuster. Clearly, the hotness quotient went to another level, as we had Hrithik Roshan, Aishwarya Rai Bachchan and Bipasha Basu in this one. Dhoom 2 belonged to Hrithik and the sheer conviction, it just took it to another level.\n\nSo, there was a lot speculations about the 3rd instalment and after 7 long years, YRF came out with D:3. This time, Vijay Krishna Acharya (who wrote the first 2 instalments) stepped into the shoes of Sanjay Gadhvi (who directed ‘Dhoom and Dhoom2) and guess what? We have Aamir Khan as the villain. Since, the Dhoom franchise has always been about style and sex appeal along with a determined performance, many people doubted Aamir’s ability. There were direct comparisons between Hrithik and Aamir. The movie wasn’t promoted that much by Aamir and YRF but still, it generated curiosity amongst all of us.\n\nDhoom 3 begins with the introduction of Sahir played by Siddharth Nigam (Young Sahir). His introduction is old-school but kick-ass. It had something about it and the film started off on a high note. Then came our very own Jaggu Dada, i.e Jackie Shroff (Iqbal, Sahir’s father) and his screen presence along with the voiceovers, it was a treat.\n\nThe western bank of Chicago lent money to Iqbal Khan so that he could save his circus but they decided to close down the circus as he wasn’t able to repay the loan. The scene where Sahir pleads with Anderson not to shut down his father’s circus as he and his father would soon be able to turn the corner: It had so much of emotions attached to it and Siddharth Nigam nailed that one.\n\nBut Iqbal Khan’s presentation before the bankers and Sahir’s pleas don’t help. Iqbal Khan commits suicide in front of Anderson, leaving Sahir devastated and full off vengeance.\n\nThe next shot, Aamir’s introduction. The camera work and Aamir’s diction, it has so much of depth that it would move anyone who’s crazy about cinema and the art of filmmaking. Sahir wants revenge and he certainly decides to rob all the branches of the same bank. The first robbery is disappointing and it’s easy to guess that it’s been done with the help of VFX. Nevertheless, the introduction of Jay and Ali (Abhishek Bachchan and Uday Chopra) is okay-ish. Thanks to Uday, you’ll have a smile on your face but overall, the introduction is disappointing. Same goes for Aliya (Katrina Kaif).\n\nVijay wasted a lot of time on the introduction of the characters and he could have saved a lot of time by cutting it short.\n\nThe plot has been inspired by “The Prestige” and if you have seen it, then you might find Dhoom 3 a bit boring and people who haven’t, I’m sure you’ll enjoy the chase and the thrill.\n\nThe screenplay is a bit dull as the film loses pace in between and make you wonder, what exactly is happening?\n\nBut the fact is that, Dhoom 3 is Aamir Khan’s show. Why should you watch this film? It’s because of him.\n\nThe dedication and the urge to play Sahir and Samar, you need guts to that. Samar is Sahir’s autistic twin brother about whom I won’t talk much. Both the characters are poles apart, the only similarities are: They are twins, they are criminals and both of them are gymnasts. Hats off to Aamir! He makes you believe that he is Samar, he makes you believe that he is Sahir. The scene where Samar realises that he’s lonely and he realises that he is what he is, because of Sahir: Perfectly executed. Aamir is bang on.\n\nAbhishek Bachchan is one of the most underrated actors we have and he certainly deserves acknowledgement for this one.\n\nHe is really soothing and decent as Jay. I don’t know why people make fun of Uday Chopra because he always delivers a decent performance, specially as Ali. Uday manages to crack you up with his one liners and stupid English.\n\nHe deserves some credit as he’s from such a big family and developing this “ghaati diction” it surely is something great.\n\nWhereas, Katrina Kaif is wasted. She looks hotter than Esha Deol, Aishwarya Rai Bachchan and Bipasha Basu. But sadly, her role in not dignified. How did she fall for Samar? All of a sudden? When she actually used to hit on Sahir. In the end, we see that she handles “The Great Indian Circus.” Why does she? She suddenly surrendered her life to Samar? Really messed up.\n\nBut she looks hot and dances sensuously. Aishwarya had a better role in Dhoom 2 and obviously, the chemistry between Hrithik and Aishwarya was way better than Katrina and Aamir’s chemistry. But anyway, the actual chemistry is between Sahir and Samar.\n\nSo, Aamir Khan manages to play both the characters to perfection and makes you believe that Sahir and Samar are two different people, even though they are portrayed by the same man.\n\nThe cinematography by Sudeep Chatterjee is sorcerous and it just raised the bar for all our cinematographers. Now, that’s camerawork, seriously! The editing by Ritesh Soni is quite a disappointment, he could have edited it and made it compact.\n\nMusic by Pritam’s good, not top notch but soothing to the ears. Specially Malang, which is the most expensive song of Bollywood.\n\nSiddharth Mahadevan and Shilpa Rao- Their voices are divine. But, visually this song will drive you insane.\n\nSudeep Chatterjee deserves a thunderous applause for Malang. He has shot it with so much of grace and perfection that it’ll teach a lot of aspiring filmmakers and cinematographers about certain aspects of filmmaking. It’s the WOW song.\n\nKamli, sung by Sunidhi’s good but not that amazing, whereas Katrina looks HOT in the song and dances beautifully. Thumbs up.\n\nAamir’s dedication towards his work, it needs no introduction right? The tap dance is obviously not perfect but it is certainly quite amazing to see him take the initiative and deliver it with ease. He looks stunning and the music is bang on.\n\nMy personal favourite: Bande hain hum uske, sung by Shivam Mahadevan and Anish Sharma, it’s the most beautiful composition along with the most innocent and loveable vocals. It’ll leave you with some tears in your eyes.\n\nOn the whole, Dhoom 3 is an Aamir Khan film as the others don’t have much to do. The story and the screenplay could have been a lot better. The highlight about the chase sequences: The camerawork.\n\nDhoom 3 is not about stylish and hot thieves, this time it’s about emotions. Father-son emotions and brotherhood. It does bring about the emotion inside you. I just wish Vijay Acharya had written it with a lot more ‘sense’ but nevertheless, it is a one time watch for sure. Some people might not agree with me but it deserves to be watched: For Aamir Khan and for Sudeep Chatterjee’s brilliant camerawork.\n\nIf people enjoyed Chennai Express and Krrish 3, then Dhoom 3 certainly won’t disappoint you.\n\nRATING- 3/5\n\nCast: Saif Ali Khan, Sonakshi Sinha, Jimmy Shergill, Raj Babbar, Ravi Kishen, Gulshan Grover, Chunky Pandey\n\nSpecial Appearance : Mahi Gill and Vidyut Jamwal\n\nStory and Screenplay: Tigmanshu Dhulia and Amaresh Misra\n\nDialogues: Tigmanshu Dhulia\n\nMusic and Background Score: Sajid Wajid\n\nTamanche Pe Disco: RDB, Nindy Kaur and Raftaar\n\nTalking about Tigmanshu Dhulia, he is a really intelligent man. The man who wrote the impeccable “Dil Se” and bloomed into this industry. In 2011, when he came out with Sahib Biwi Aur Gangster, he immediately received an extremely positive response from the critics. But after the much awaited Paan Singh Tomar, tables turned and Dhulia got his first box office hit. (As saheb biwi was a moderate success)\n\nDhulia showcased his talent in front of the camera when he played Ramadhir Singh in Gangs Of Wasseypur. That just proves the quality of this man. Doesn’t it?\n\nSince our country follows this weird tradition of not accepting critically acclaimed films, Dhulia decided to make a hardcore commercial film. That is how Bullet Raja, came into the picture.\n\nOne line story: Raja Misra, who’s a “good” dacoit drives a bullet. Hence, the title of the film is Bullet Raja.\n\nRaja Misra, played by Saif Ali Khan belongs to a Brahmin family and his introduction is ‘kick-ass.’ He crashes a wedding to save himself from a few goons and befriends Rudra, played by Jimmy Shergill .They connect instantly due to their similar nature and outlook. As Rudra insists Raja to get along with the woman (Mahi Gill) who danced along with them. The situation changes due to an unexpected attack by their rivals with the help of Rudra’s own family member Lallan(Chunky Pandey).\n\nThis outraged the situation as Rudra’s uncle is put to death by Lallan and the gang. Unwilling to get into dacoity and the world full of blood, Raja and Rudra decide to take their revenge and that is how they get into this business. Unlike other commercial films, the revengeful scenes are not dragged out here. They find their enemies and thrive them to death immediately. Though, there is a lot of spark in between the revenge…as, Raja is always cracking his one liners which are inevitable funny.\n\nRaja and Rudra get the support of the senior Minister Ram Babu Shukla (Raj Babbar) as they prove their worth to him by hilariously killing a stupid minister. This unconvincingly creates yet another rivalry between R-R (Raja and Rudra) and Sumer Yadav (Ravi Kishan) who earlier worked with Shukla.\n\nShukla sent the duo to a meeting where a rich and arrogant Marwari businessman Bajaj (Gulshan Grover) insults them and scorches their ego. They kidnap him in an awkward situation where he is busy fooling a bengali girl Mitali (Sonakshi Sinha) who is an aspiring actress and that’s how Raja meets her. He falls for her immediately and somehow their opaque love story begins.\n\nI’ll halt the story right here because it anyway has nothing extravagant about it; as it is pretty much predictable and stretchy but there is a good doze of action in the end. Thanks to the inspector (Vidyut Jamwal)\n\nBullet Raja disappoints overall as I expected a lot more from Tigmanshu Dhulia. The film loses pace and creates a lot of confusion in between. Sonakshi Sinha wasn’t even required in the film as her character seemed forced and anyway, she’s again doing what she did in Rowdy, Once Upon A Time and Dabangg. Sonakshi, you have talent. We saw it in Lootera. PLEASE! DO SOMETHING ELSE.\n\nThe love story between Raja and Mitali is so confusing that I was literally scratching my head off, wondering how it all started?\n\nAnother disappointed was the background score. Sajid-Wajid used Dabangg’s score and dismantled it a little and used it again over here.\n\nPlus, the music is not engaging as well. Tamanche Pe Disco is the best song of the album (that too is by RDB not Sajid-Wajid) and the other good song is the title song.\n\nAnother confusing thing: Raja, Rudra and Mitali decide to explore Mumbai and suddenly, they end up dancing on Tamanche Pe Disco.\n\n*CONFUSION*\n\nI still feel, Dhulia must have created something better than this as the entire film seemed disjointed and I am sure, that happened because of some terrible editing. You could easily make out that different-different scenes have been put together. Scene 1 and Scene 10 together, you can imagine the chaos now.\n\nSaif is charming even in this rugged look and he delivers an outstanding performance. Jimmy Shergill is pleasing to the eyes and the chemistry Saif and Jimmy share, it’s too die for. The action is believable and it never really goes over the top. Another thing that I’d like to mention: Mahi Gill doesn’t have much to do over here and she’s not even a great dancer, but her expressions in the song are killer and I’m sure she is going to generate a lot of whistles in UP. She leaves a mark with everything that she does.\n\nSaif Ali Khan, Jimmy Shergill, Vidyut Jamwal’s action (even though he was wasted in the entire film) and Tigmanshu Dhulia’s brilliantly put together dialogues. Watch Bullet Raja, just for these 4 things.\n\nIt is average.\n\nSome of the astonishing dialogues are listed below. They might seem plain right now; but the dialogue delivery and the timing is pitch perfect.\n\n“Uttar Pradesh ki rajneeti mein koi khaas nahi hota, jo jaan deta hai wahi khaas hota hai”\n\n“Padhe likhe bakait aaj kal milte kahaan hain”\n\n“Tum koi mamooli sipahi nahi ho, tum ho political commando”\n\n“Dharmik mamlo mein mujhe ashleelta bilkul bhi pasand nahi hai”\n\n“Jahan na pahonche bailgaadi wahan pahonche Marwari”\n\n“Hamare yahan badla lene ki parampara hai koi corporate culture nahi jo agle deal me nuksaan adjust kar lein”\n\n“Rajneeti aur vaishyavriti bahot prachin peshe hain, dono ka kaam shaanti banaye rakhna hai”\n\nMy personal favourite: “Jab hum aayenge toh garmi thodi badh jayegi, pata chal hi jayega”\n\nLegendary- “Brahman bhukha toh Sudama, samjha toh Chanakya aur rootha toh Ravaan”\n\nRATING- 2.5/5\n\nAs a child, I still remember how we were literally told to revive the speeches by famous personalities. More or less, the politicians who used their weird expressions and voice modulations to get some weight to what they were saying. Unaware of the actual meanings, most of us would just mug up everything and add those weird expressions to our words and then deliver the speech and VOILA, we would get good grades in our school assignments or we would get the 1st prize at some competition.\n\nToday, after Sir Tendulkar delivered his farewell speech…I realised what actually a speech is.\n\nA speech is not about being loud or being technical about your words…it’s about how you exactly feel and I realised this after SRT, who avoided the flamboyant vocabulary and stuck to his simplicity and emotions, started speaking.\n\nThe man who’s got nearly all the records to his name, that cricket has ever seen. The man who’s been a part of this game since the past 29 years. The man who came back strong after a terrifying Tennis Elbow injury. That man is loved by the UNIVERSE, not just his own country. We witnessed that after, he received a guard of honour from the Windies and after Darren Sammy spoke at the presentation ceremony.\n\nHe has everything and still, he is immensely grounded. That clearly shows how beautifully he has been raised.\n\nHe misses his father till date and still raises up his bat, in his memory. We could see the excitement in his eyes, when he spoke about his mother. We could see the love he had in his eyes for his kids and his wife. We could even sense the amount of grief he had for his ex-manager. These are all ‘REAL’ emotions. You usually don’t see public figures talk like that.\n\nWe all know that he’s not a normal human being and he’s really very special but after he spoke about his journey and after he mentioned each and every person who played an important role in this journey, it was clear that, the person who is doing the talking is a middle class Indian who is a real superhero for the country and is a family man. He has his feet on the ground whereas he can easily pull down the sky because of the superlative talent that he is blessed with. Not the talent of this beautiful game but the talent of making people fall in love with the game and him.\n\nAnd after he touched and prayed on the pitch…RESPECT for him, increased a zillion times more.\n\nThank you for inspiring me and the entire world. You are a living legend, you are GOD for all the cricket lovers and you aren’t retiring. You are just moving ahead, onto the next phase of your life.\n\nYou’ll never fade away because you are immortal sir, you are immortal.\n\n#SRT200\n\n#ThankYouSachin\n\n#SACHINSACHINSACHIN\n\nMay you always stay blessed, may you stay healthy forever….\n\nthe world is gonna love you throughout…be it today…be it tomorrow.\n\nyour innings are gonna overpower each and every sorrow…\n\nSachin Tendulkar is going to live on, even if there is no tomorrow.\n\nFor those, who missed out on SRT’s farewell speech-\n\nSachin Tendulkar: “All my friends, settle down let me talk,I’ll get more and more emotional .” The crowd does berserk out there. “My life between 22 yards in the 24 years, it ‘s hard to believe that it ‘s coming to an end. I would like to thank all the people who have helped me in my life to get here. I have a list in my hand , please forgive me if I miss out on a few names. First , my father, hepassed away in 1999 .

If I had not done that , I would have been a lesser cricketer . The most important one in 1991 , I met my wife Anjali. I know she was a doctor . When we decided to make it a family, she said, you continue with your cricket and I’ll take care of the family .Without that I think I couldn’t have played so much cricket . Thank you for all that you’ve done and it is the best partnership I’ve had in my life . Then Sara and Arjun are two precious diamonds in my life .Daughter is 16 and son is 14, time has flown by .

I believe in you and all the best for your future . Thanks to all the doctors, physios,without your special efforts , I couldn’t have been fit. I don’ t know how you all kept me in good shape. My dear friend , late Mark Mascerenhas, my first manager . Without him I couldn ‘ thave achieved all this. All those sponsorship deals etc. . thanks for your support . I miss you. My manager Vinod Naidu, he ‘s more like my family. He’s given me so much time leaving his family to work with him. In the school days when I played well , the media backed be a lot .
