        "text": "Submitted by TellychakkarTeam on Sat, 01/25/2014 - 13:34\n\nLast year’s Bigg Boss contestant Santosh Shukla, who made a mark in the Colors popular show with his entertaining acts and flirty nature, is today a happy man with him playing an important role in Salman Khan’s latest venture Jai Ho that hit the silver screens yesterday. “The response that the film is receiving is giving me such a great high that I can’t even express my excitement. We are getting a superb feedback and all thanks to Salman bhai. What a magnificent premiere we had in Dubai. Right now too the crowd is going mad cheering us all; it’s one crazy moment,” quipped an excited Santosh as he came out of Juhu’s Chandan theatre after watching the film yesterday (24 January). Talking about his character Santosh averred, “People might have known from the promos that I am playing a negative character. Here I must add that it’s a very interesting character. And I have added my inputs having discussed the same with Sohail (Khan) bhai; there’s a bit of comedy in it and a lot of variation. Also my character will turn from negative to a positive one and become heroic in the climax. It was definitely a dream debut for me and I am thankful to Salman and Sohail Bhai for giving me this opportunity.” “Also the industry has welcomed me with open hearts as I have just been approached for the Arjun Kapoor-starrer Tevar for which I will go for the narration soon. Also at the premiere, Preity Zinta came up to me and said, ‘You have arrived’- that was the best compliment for me. Also Salman bhai, in his interviews mentioned that my role was one of the best. So it’s a tremendous feeling at the moment,” the actor added sporting a broad smile. Santosh was also seen promoting Jai Ho in a big way through his social networking profiles. When asked whether he was given the task to do so, he laughed and said, “Well it is my first film and I was too excited. So it was just my way of sharing my feelings with all. And to top it all, Salman bhai jokingly told me ‘lage raho’ with my promotion, so why should I have stopped.” So is he expecting the film to break all records? “Yaar, honestly neither am I bothered nor do I want to get into the business perspective. But obviously I am confident that the film will do well and I just hope the message that we want to give out to the people is well accepted and followed by the masses,” concluded Santosh with a loud Jai Ho!\n\nLike\n\n0\n\nLove\n\n0\n\nHaha\n\n0\n\nYay\n\n0\n\nWow\n\n0\n\nSad\n\n0\n\nAngry\n\n0\n\nSubscribe Here"
