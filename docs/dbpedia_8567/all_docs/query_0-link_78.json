Another? Physics mown down in a blaze of speeding car tires or exploding motors. Vin Diesel growling something. A giant threat to our heroes that can only be faced in demolition derby fashion and, yes, FAMILY again. The new look at Fast X has screeched in\n\nHaving fought off worries about franchise fatigue (Fast 9 didnât hit at the box office quite as well as some of its predecessors) and behind-the-scenes drama (veteran director Justin Lin departed the movie after 10 days of shooting), Fast X is being described as the beginning of the end of the road, since the 11th main movie is the big finale for the franchise. Assuming you believe thatâ¦\n\nSo what's the story this time? Official synopsis time!\n\nOver many missions and against impossible odds, Dom Toretto (Diesel) and his family have outsmarted, out-nerved and outdriven every foe in their path. Now, they confront the most lethal opponent theyâve ever faced: A terrifying threat emerging from the shadows of the past whoâs fueled by blood revenge, and who is determined to shatter this family and destroy everything â and everyone â that Dom loves, forever.\n\nIn 2011âs Fast & Furious 5: Rio Heist, Dom and his crew took out nefarious Brazilian drug kingpin Hernan Reyes and decapitated his empire on a bridge in Rio De Janeiro. What they didnât know was that Reyesâ son, Dante (Jason Momoa), witnessed it all and has spent the last 12 years masterminding a plan to make Dom pay the ultimate price.\n\nDanteâs plot will scatter Domâs family from Los Angeles to the catacombs of Rome, from Brazil to London and from Portugal to Antarctica. New allies will be forged, and old enemies will resurface. But everything changes when Dom discovers that his own 8-year-old son Brian (Leo Abelo Perry) is the ultimate target of Danteâs vengeance.\n\nThe regulars are joined by the likes of Brie Larson, Daniela Melchior, Alan Ritchson and Rita Moreno, and Universal are clearly happy with the job that incoming director Louis Leterrier was able to achieve, as he's returning for the next one.\n\nFast X is due in cinemas on 19 May. FAMILY.\n\nAvinash Tripathi honored with Maharashtra Dream Achievers Award\n\nNEW DELHI:MMNN: 19 April 2023"
