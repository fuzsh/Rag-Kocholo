        "text": "Indian actor Salman Khan might have had enough of the media probing about his marriage; he finally decided to make an announcement and put all the enthusiastic journalists at peace.\n\nThe actor said he will consider tying the knot only after he receives verdict of Jodhpur and Mumbai courts in the blackbuck and vehicle mishap cases against him.\n\nAlmost in every press conference and interviews, the 46-year-old actor has been hounded with questions about his marriage.\n\nBeing one of the most wanted actors in the industry, his never ending bachelorhood has been making headlines for a long time now.\n\nRecently during India TV's show 'Aap Ki Adalat' Salman said, \"I will think about marrying only after the courts give their verdicts. If the verdicts go against me, I will marry only after coming out of jail.\"\n\nSalman is fighting a case in Jodhpur court in the killing of a blackbuck during the shooting of 'Hum Saath Saath Hain' in 1999 and another in Mumbai court for the vehicle mishap incident in 2002, which resulted in the death of a person.\n\nSalman continued joking, \"I hope to be acquitted in both cases, but if I marry before the verdicts, will it be fair? Suppose, if there is a turn of events and I am sent to jail, and my wife has to come with our child to meet me in jail. Will it be fair?\"\n\nBut Salman confessed during another TV interview 'Frankly Speaking' that he gets irritated when probed about his marriage again and again.\n\n\"The way people ask me with certain intention is irritating. It's my marriage, my problem. What do people have to do with my marriage? Will they get any profit out of it? I don't think so. If there's anyone getting profit out of my marriage it will be only me\".\n\nHis ever growing list of female \"good friends\" is also not helping his cause of playing down the marriage issue.\n\nEven after being linked with some of the most beautiful women in the industry over the span of 24 years Salman managed to keep his single status intact.\n\nSince his break up with actress Katrina Kaif, Salman has not been linked any other actress.\n\nFor the past couple of years Salman's career has been sky rocketing with one box office hit after another.\n\nHis latest 'Dabangg 2' which released this weekend has been doing steady business. Four months back 'Ek Tha Tiger' almost crossed the much hyped Rs 200 crore (INR) mark.\n\nSalman is considered the most bankable actor in Bollywood and his schedule is choc-o-block.\n\nAs for marriage, the actor shows very little genuine interest in settling down.\n\nConsidering his court case has been going on for the last 13 years it might be another few years before we get to meet Mrs Salman Khan.\n\nMUST READ:\n\nBigg Boss Season 6: Tearful and heartfelt Christmas surprise\n\nNach Baliye 5: Sania Mirza, Shoaib to reveal their love story\n\nIs Salman Khan Bollywoodâ€™s answer to ultimate superhero - Rajinikanth?\n\nSalman Khan's gift to Bigg Boss contestant Santosh Shukla"
