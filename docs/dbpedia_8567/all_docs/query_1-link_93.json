        "text": "Biography\n\nShukla was born in Lucknow into a family that was not related to film industry. She was interested in films right from her childhood and completed her graduation from the Christ Church College, Lucknow. Upon graduation, she decided to join the Film and Television Institute of India (FTII) to do a course in cinematography, which she felt was an ideal platform to express her \"creativity\". Her family was supportive of her decision. Shukla's diploma film at the FTII was premiered at the competition section of the Camerimage film festival. Upon completing her course at the FTII, she joined Santosh Sivan as an apprentice and went on to assist him in various films including two Hollywood productions – The Mistress of Spices and Before the Rains. She was the second unit camerawoman for Mani Ratnam's Tamil–Hindi bilingual films Raavan and Raavanan (2010). She got a break as an independent cinematographer through Kutty Srank, a Malayalam film directed by Shaji N. Karun. The film had the distinction of being the first in Malayalam to be shot by a woman cinematographer. Shukla's work fetched her the Best Cinematography at the 57th National Film Awards in 2010. She was the first female to be awarded in the category. After Kutty Srank, she joined with Santosh Sivan for Urumi, a period drama.\n\nDirector\n\nHappy Mother's Day, a feature film by Children’s Film Society India (CFSI) (2015)\n\nCinematographer\n\nKutty Srank (2010)\n\nCamera and Electrical Department or Second Unit Department\n\nAnandabhadram (2005) - Malayalam\n\nThe Mistress of Spices (film) (2005) - Hindi/English\n\nBefore the Rains (2007) - English /Malayalam\n\nPrarambha (2007)-Kannada\n\nTahaan (2008)-Hindi\n\nRaavan (2010)-Hindi/Tamil\n\nUrumi (film) (2010)-Malayalam\n\nPehla Sitara (delayed)\n\nNational\n\nNational Film Award for Best Cinematography\n\n2010 - Kutty Srank (Malayalam) – Best Cinematography\n\nInternational\n\nNominated:\n\nGolden Tadpole for Best Cinematography, Camerimage\n\n2004 – Pre-Mortem – Golden Tadpole for Best Cinematography, Camerimage"
