I am a very short tempered person but I somehow controlled myself. I depicted my real self in the show,\" Santosh said.\n\nThe Chandrakanta star was known in the house for entertaining the inmates with his soulful Bollywood numbers and during his stay he had started liking co-contestant Aashka Goradia. But soon, he got upset with her and was also seen discussing about Aashka's \"changing behaviour\" towards him with others.\n\n\"I was very close to Aashka and really liked her. When we were staying in the mud house, she came across as a friendly person. But the moment we entered to this house, she changed herself. I came to know from other contestants that she was saying bad things about me. I tried to talk to her but she didn't. So, I decided I will never speak with her in my life,\" he added.\n\nSantosh is now planning to take a break from TV and after spending some time with his parents, he will start shooting his debut film Balwinder Singh Famous Ho Gaya with singers Mika and Shaan."
