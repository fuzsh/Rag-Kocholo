        "text": "Govinda\n\nWe all enjoy watching movies. Movies have been our biggest source of entertainment for the past several decades. Around the world, thousands of movies are released every year. Today there are many film industries in the world and, if we talk about the top film industry in the world, then the name of Bollywood will come. Hindi cinema is one of the most important and well-known entertainment industries.\n\nMany actors have become very famous in the history of Bollywood. Many actors in Bollywood have made people laugh and win their hearts with their comic timing. Today in this article, we will talk about a Bollywood actor who has made millions of people crazy with his acting, dance, and comedy. In this article, we will talk about superstar Govinda.\n\nAbout\n\nBollywood actor Govinda is thought to be one of the most successful actors in Bollywood history. Govinda is not just an actor, but he is also a former politician, producer, dancer, and comedian. In the 1990s, Govinda was one of Bollywood's most popular actors, and there was a time in Bollywood when everyone wanted to cast Govinda in their films.\n\nGovinda is a well-known Bollywood dancer. There is hardly anyone who has not been impressed by Govinda's dance and comedy. The way Govinda dances and acts makes him stand out from the rest of the Bollywood actors. Govinda is also known by many other names, such as Raja Babu, Chi-Chi, Virar ka Chokra, Hero No. 1. By an online poll conducted by BBC News Online in June 1999, he was ranked tenth in the greatest star of the last thousand years. In simple words, Govinda is one of the most famous movie stars in history.\n\nEary Life\n\nEveryone knows Govinda today, but very few people know his full name. Govind Arun Ahuja is Govinda's full name. He was born On December 21, 1963, and in the year 2022, Govinda will be 59 years old. Govinda was born in Virar (Bombay), Maharashtra, and for this reason, he is also known as Virar Ka Chokra.\n\nNirmala Devi Ahuja was his mother, and Arun Kumar Ahuja was his father. Arun Kumar Ahuja was an actor who has appeared in several films. Govinda's father was also a film producer and actor. And Govinda's mother, Nirmala Devi, also known as Nirmala Arun, was a vocalist and Bollywood actress. Arun Kumar Ahuja and Nirmala Devi have five children, out of which 3 daughters (Kamini Khanna, Pushpa Ahuja Anand, Padma Sharma) and 2 sons (Kriti Kumar, Govinda) are included. Govinda's brother Kriti Kumar is also an actor, producer, director, and singer. Govinda was the youngest of five siblings, and due to this, he was given the name \"Chi-Chi,\" which means \"little finger\" in Punjabi. Govinda is considered one of Bollywood's most successful and famous actors.\n\nStarting Career\n\nGovinda, after completing a degree in Bachelor of Commerce from Annasaheb Vartak College, Vasai decided to do a job. But Govinda failed to get a good job. After this, his father advised him to work in Bollywood or the film industry. It is said that after watching Mithun Chakraborty's film, Disco Dancer Govinda decided to act in the film.\n\nHe went to many places and gave auditions for works in films and serials, then Govinda was offered the role of Abhimanyu in the very popular serial Mahabharata. But Govinda refused to do this role because he got the chance to do the lead role in a Bollywood film.\n\nFilm Career\n\nGovinda's first Bollywood movie was Ilzaam which was released in 1986, and it was a hit movie. In his first film, Govinda shares a screen with a legend in the Bollywood industry like Sashi Kapoor and Shatrughan Sinha. But Govinda's first film as a lead actor was Tan Badan, and this movie was also released in 1986. Govinda's film Love 86 made him an overnight star.\n\nAnd from then till now, Govinda has worked in more than 165 films. Most of Govinda's films are super hits and are liked by many people. Hero No. 1, Coolie No. 1, Raja Babu, Partner, Aankhen, Dulhe Raja, Shola Aur Shabnam, Awaargi are some best movies of Govinda. Apart from this, Govinda also appeared as a judge in the reality show Dance India Dance Super Moms Season 2 of the television world in 2014.\n\nWhen Govinda started working in Hindi cinema, that era was of action and romance films. There was no such comedy hero in Bollywood who could play the lead role in films. But when Govinda started acting in Hindi films, he brought the humorous era back into existence. It would not be wrong to say that Govinda is not only excellent in comedy but also in dance and drama.\n\nPolitical career\n\nGovinda is not only a successful actor, but he is also a politician. In 2004, the Indian National Congress party fielded Govinda to contest the Lok Sabha elections from North Mumbai, and Govinda won this election by more than 50000 votes. But after this, Govinda never contested the election again. Many people say that Govinda's entry into politics was a wrong decision.\n\nMarriage and Children\n\nOn March 11, 1987, he married Sunita Ahuja, and it is said that this marriage was kept secret for four years from the rest of the people. Sunita and Govinda Ahuja have two children, one daughter, and one son.\n\nGovinda is a very good actor, father, and husband. Tina Ahuja is his daughter's name, and Yashvardhan Ahuja is his son's name. Tina Ahuja is also an actress, and her first film is Second Hand Husband, which was released in 2015. And his son Yashvardhan Ahuja is also going to debut in Bollywood soon. He began his career under Sajid Nadiadwala as an assistant director.\n\nNet worth, Car collection, Houses\n\nBollywood Actor Govinda is a name in the film world who has entertained the audience with his many super hit films. Govinda is also known for his luxurious lifestyle, apart from his superb acting. Even though Govinda does not appear in many films these days, he still earns crores of rupees every year.\n\nAccording to a report, Today, Govinda has assets of more than 150 crores, and he earns about 15-20 crores rupees every year. He has also invested in several properties in the real estate market. He lives with his family in one of his bungalows in Juhu. The price of this bungalow is also in crores. Govinda also has a bungalow on Madh Island.\n\nGovinda's charge for movies is 5-6 crore rupees, and for brand endorsements, he charges Rs. 1-2 Crore. Expensive cars like Mercedes, Mitsubishi Lancer, Ford Endeavor, Maruti Zen, BMW, etc., are included in Govinda's car collection. And he also has expensive bikes like Ducati, whose price is close to 8 lakhs rupees.\n\nControversy Related to Govinda\n\nAlthough Govinda has always ruled in people's hearts, there was a time when he, too, had to face a lot of criticism. During the shooting of Money Hai Toh Honey Hai in 2008, Govinda had slapped a man named Santosh Rai. After this, Santosh Rai filed a complaint of assault and crime against Govinda in Borivali Magistrate Court, Mumbai. But this court did not convict Govinda in this case. And after this, Santosh Rai took this matter to the Supreme Court. And then, the Supreme Court ordered Govinda to settle this matter with Santosh Rai out of the court within two weeks.\n\nAwards and Achievements\n\nIn 1995, he received the Special Jury Award for the film Coolie No. 1.\n\nFor the films like Saajan Chale Sasural and Haseena Maan Jaayegi, he also won the Filmfare Award due to his superb acting.\n\nHe has also received the IFFAAward for the movie Partner and Jodi No 1. Apart from this, Govinda has won many other awards.\n\nBased on a BBC News Online pollconducted in 1999, he was ranked tenth greatest stage star of all time.\n\nConclusion\n\nToday, Govinda is one of the most successful actors in Bollywood. He is such an artist who can easily do any role, and the way he dances, hardly any other Bollywood actor can dance like him. Govinda plays all kinds of roles with ease. But Govinda got real popularity from a comedy movie. His film makes people laugh a lot. Due to the amazing acting of Govinda, he has a lot of fan following. Govinda is not only popular in India but also abroad."
