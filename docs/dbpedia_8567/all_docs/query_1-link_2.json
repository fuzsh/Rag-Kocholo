Let there be Victory) is a 2014 Indian Hindi-language political action drama film directed by Sohail Khan, who also produced the film under the banner Sohail Khan Productions and co-produced by Sunil Lulla under Eros International, which distributed the film. It is an official remake of the Telugu film Stalin, which is also inspired by the American-drama film Pay It Forward.[4] The film stars Salman Khan, Tabu, Daisy Shah, Danny Denzongpa, Sana Khan and Aditya Pancholi, while Sunil Shetty, and Genelia D'Souza make cameo appearances.\n\nJai Ho was released on 24 January 2014, during the Republic Day weekend, and received mixed reviews from critics. The film grossed ₹195 crore (US$23 million) at the box office, becoming the sixth highest-grossing Bollywood film of 2014.[5][6]\n\nPlot\n\n[edit]\n\nJai Agnihotri, a short-tempered INA Major, gets suspended after he ignored orders from his superiors by rescuing a group of children from terrorists. After this incident, Jai moves in with his mother and sister, Geeta. One day, Jai is unable to help Suman, a physically disabled girl, take an examination, while her brother is stuck in a traffic jam. A depressed Suman commits suicide. Jai gets disturbed by the incident, where he creates a help-three-people concept, which would encourage citizens to help each other and would foster kindness and a sense of community among the citizens. Each day, citizens are to help three people and these three people will in turn help three more people and so on.\n\nOn one occasion for one of his daily good deeds, Jai loses his temper and beats a rich man as he had injured a child beggar. In an act of revenge, the rich man calls some henchmen to kidnap Geeta and her friend Rinky. Jai saves Geeta and Rinky, but injures one of the captors in the process, who happens to be the henchman of MLA Patil, the son-in-law of Home Minister Dashrath Singh, who gets enraged about Jai injuring Patil's henchmen. Dashrath tells Patil to avenge this injury by kidnapping Jai's nephew Kabir, but Jai kills Patil in the process. Meanwhile, CM Ashok Pradhan learns about Jai's help-three-people concept after his own life is saved by a schoolgirl. Ashok intervenes in the dispute between Dashrath and Jai in order to end their fight, but Dashrath does not appreciate it and attempts to kill Ashok.\n\nHowever, Jai is able to save Ashok and admits him to the hospital. Dashrath spreads rumours that Jai attempted to assassinate Ashok. Meanwhile, Dashrath's son and his henchmen attack Jai, who later kills Dashrath's son, but Jai gets severely injured after getting stabbed by Patil's widow Kavita. Kavitha gets stabbed and dies. A rickshaw driver and Jai's former colleague Arjun Kaul together help Jai get to the hospital. While Jai is at the hospital, Ashok recovers and reveals Dashrath's involvement in the attempted murder. An enraged crowd beats Dashrath to near death after hearing the truth. Jai recovers and emerges from the hospital, where he finds thousands of people waiting for him. Jai thanks them all for implementing his helping concept.\n\nCast\n\n[edit]\n\nSalman Khan as Jai Agnihotri\n\nTabu as Geeta Agnihotri Khanna\n\nDaisy Shah as Rinky Shah\n\nDanny Denzongpa as Home Minister Dashrath Singh\n\nAditya Pancholi as Inspector Dilip Kadam\n\nMahesh Manjrekar as Babban\n\nSharad Kapoor as Inspector Imran Siddiqui\n\nMukul Dev as Shrikant Patil\n\nHaroon Qazi as Vijayant Singh\n\nNadira Babbar as Sulochna Agnihotri\n\nPulkit Samrat as Abhay Rajput\n\nMohnish Bahl as Chief Minister Ashok Pradhan\n\nSana Khan as Kavita Singh Patil\n\nResham Tipnis as Meghna Shah\n\nAshmit Patel as Sumit Mohile\n\nYash Tonk as Babu\n\nMahesh Thakur as Rehaan Khanna\n\nNaman Jain as Kabir Khanna\n\nTulip Joshi as Anjali D’Souza\n\nVarun Badola as Ronnie D'Souza\n\nBruna Abdullah as Anne Rosselline\n\nSudesh Lehri as Pandit Kaushal Chand Sharma\n\nSantosh Shukla as Manik Singh\n\nJeetu Verma as Subhash Prasad Agashe\n\nVatsal Sheth as Harjeet\n\nNauheed Cyrusi as Simran\n\nVikas Bhalla as Rohan Sharma\n\nRaju Mavani as Rajkishan Gupta\n\nGuest appearances\n\nSuniel Shetty as Captain Arjun Kaul\n\nGenelia D'Souza as Suman Sharma\n\nProduction\n\n[edit]\n\nDevelopment\n\n[edit]\n\nIn late 2012, Sohail Khan announced he planned to remake the Telugu film Stalin starring Chiranjeevi Konidela and Trisha Krishna.[7][8] Khan originally titled the remake Mental, but by the time the film was released, it had been re-titled Jai Ho.[citation needed]\n\nFilming\n\n[edit]\n\nShooting for the film was set to begin 27 February 2013 but was postponed until late March. There were rumors that the film would be released in 3D, but Sohail Khan was cited stating, \"First, let me complete my film in the normal format. Then I'll take a call\".[9]\n\nMarketing\n\n[edit]\n\nSalman Khan unveiled the first look poster of Jai Ho on 6 December 2013. The poster consisted of images of thousands of fans digitally merged to create one portrait of Khan. Khan's fans designed this poster.[10][11][12][13] The makers unveiled the film's official teaser on 13 December 2013.[14] The official trailer of the film was released on 3 January 2014.[15]\n\nReception\n\n[edit]\n\nCritical response\n\n[edit]\n\nIndia Today gave Jai Ho a 3 out of 5 and commented that it was a rip off of Ek Tha Tiger with mindless action.[16] Anupama Chopra gave the movie a 2.5 out of 5, stating, Jai Ho was more of a cartoon than a film.[17]\n\nRaja Sen of Rediff gave the film 2 out of 5 stars and said, Khan, Bollywood's real-life answer to Derek Zoolander, does his thing like only he can. And the crowd responds. Sitting in a single-screen theatre, the air was filled with shrill, thrilled whistles as soon as the censor certificate hit the screen. The first glimpse of Khan – via braceleted wrist – had the crowd in paroxysms.\"[18] Rajeev Masand of CNN-IBN gave 2 stars out of 5, commenting \"To be honest, very little stays with you when you leave the cinema, aside from the unpleasant aftertaste that comes from being shamelessly manipulated.\"[19]\n\nTaran Adarsh gave it 4.5 stars out of 5 and called it a \"noble, well-intentioned message narrated in an entertaining format\".[20]\n\nBox office\n\n[edit]\n\nJai Ho was released on around 3900 screens in India and 650 screens in overseas.[21] The domestic and overseas theatrical rights were sold for ₹1.1 billion ($16 million).[22] Jai Ho spent around ₹40 crore ($5.9 million) on the production of the film.[23] The film cost around ₹650 million ($9.6 million) total with the cost of marketing and prints added, but this number still does not include Khan's remuneration.[24][25] The satellite rights were sold for ₹50 crore ($7.4 million), and music rights were also sold for ₹12 crore ($1.8 million).\n\nJai Ho suffered losses from piracy.
