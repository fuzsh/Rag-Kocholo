        "text": "Prabh Deep gets introspective with his latest release Pandemic\n\nTeam Radio City\n\nNew Delhi-based rapper Prabh Deep, hailed as India's most fearless rapper, has always been vocal and outspoken about the issues that matter through his slick verses.\n\nAmidst the COVID 19 outbreak that has gripped the nation with the Prime Minister announcing a 21-day lockdown, Prabh Deep has digitally released his latest single, 'Pandemic' through Azadi Records.\n\nThrough the song, Prabh Deep asks us to look into how our greed has taken a toll on mankind and how the disease is nature's way of reminding us to mend our ways before it's too late.\n\nProduced by the rapper with visuals by Anurag Sharma, the song is now available on the official YouTube channel of the artist.\n\nHome > Freedom > Discover > > Swadesi infuses the Mahabharata narrative in the official music video of Jung\n\nSwadesi infuses the Mahabharata narrative in the official music video of Jung\n\nTeam Radio City\n\nHip-hop collective Swadesi is out with the music video of their latest single 'Jung' from their debut album, 'Chetavni'.\n\nA Graphic India Production, the music video uses the narrative of the famous Kurukshetra battle of 18 days from the Mahabharata, to highlight how our society and the world at large are waging wars to fulfil their own selfish purposes.\n\nIn a press release, the band echoes this thought, Our nation and the world we live in is always forced to fight against each other, for natural resources, power etc. Friends, co-workers, and relationships often fall prey to such mind-filled wars amongst each other. What we fail to realise is the ones who instigate wars are all on one side, creating wars to keep the people controlled by them and making them fight against each other. It highlights the fact the people who fight wars are the losers and the ones who instigate them walk away unscathed.'\n\nTeaming up with producer Naar, the theme of the video has been created by Grant Morrison.\n\nThe debut album is now streaming worldwide.\n\nHome > Freedom > Discover > > The Yellow Diary offers a soulful twist to Rab Raakha alongwith Akasa\n\nThe Yellow Diary offers a soulful twist to Rab Raakha alongwith Akasa\n\nTeam Radio City\n\nHindi Alt rock band The Yellow Diary had a great start to 2020. It started with the release of their immensely loved single, 'Rab Raakha', which has been streaming across all platforms to overwhelming fan love and reception. The band even went on a multi-city tour across India to promote their song.\n\nNow, with social anxiety and emotions on the lowside with the nation-wide lockdown in motion, the band decided to release a brand new version of the song, titled, 'Dhoondti Firaan', in collaboration with pop princess Akasa.\n\nThe treatment may differ but the sentiment remains. That no matter where we are, we must believe that someone above us all is watching over us. The song fills us with hope and compassion and makes us look forward to better days ahead.\n\nOn her collaboration with the band, Akasa comments, 'I have always been an admirer of The Yellow Diary's songs, 'Rab Raakha', of course, is my favourite. I am very excited to be collaborating with such a talented band. 'Dhoondti Firaan' will definitely fill hearts with positivity and light, which is the need of the hour.\"\n\n'Dhoondti Firaan' is now available across all leading streaming platforms.\n\nHome > Freedom > Discover > > City Life by Raghav Meattle is an easy, reflective reminder about an unforgiving rat race\n\nCity Life by Raghav Meattle is an easy, reflective reminder about an unforgiving rat race\n\nTeam Radio City\n\nIf the lockdown has left you weary and worried, then singer-songwriter Raghav Meattle's latest single is the comfort blanket you need to slip into for solace.\n\nPaying an ode to the monotony and mundanity that follows the lives of the young and reckless in the city of dreams, Raghav's 'City Life' makes for easy listening with its thoughtful verses and plaintive yet liberating melody.\n\nThe music video of the song dropped on YouTube last week, which has been shot on a good, old Kodak 8 MM film by Abhimanyu Sengupta. Directed and edited by Rajdip Ray, who first spotted Meattle rendering an exclusive preview of the song on Abish Mathew's 'Son of Abish', the video captures the nostalgia and the old-world charm of Mumbai seeped within the hustle and bustle of an everyday routine.\n\n'City Life' also marks Meattle's collaboration with indie music's biggest talents on board including Karun Kannampilly and Jason D'Souza from The Koniac Net on drums and guitars respectively, bass by Nishant Nagar, mixed by producer Zain Calcuttawala and mastered by Skyharbor's guitarist Keshav Dhar.\n\nFollowing up the success of his debut album 'Songs from a Matchbox' in 2018, to his recent collaboration with Vernon Noronha on 'Dream Sandwich' in 2019, Raghav has released 'City Life' while also dabbling in his day-job as head of marketing for the music label, Big Bang Music.\n\nThe song is now available on YouTube and across major music streaming platforms.\n\nHome > Freedom > Discover > > Pratika Prabhune releases the easy electronic single, To The High with Daira's Piyush Kapoor\n\nPratika Prabhune releases the easy electronic single, To The High with Daira's Piyush Kapoor\n\nTeam Radio City\n\nFor many familiar with the Indian independent music scene, Pratika Prabhune is a name synonymous with everything home-grown and self-made.
