        "text": "I met Mr Danny Denzongpa first time during the making of Boxer 1982 directed by Mr Raj N Sippy .. and from that day till the present it has been a very long journey ,, and I learnt my trade , the sartorial architecture understanding the Art of creating new looks from him ,, be it China Gate Barsaat Army Hum Khuda Gawah Pukar Agneepath .. Luck Jai Ho Baby Bang Bang and so many others ,,\n\nDannyji is one of the most gifted and human person , his hospitality is the finest in all Bollywood ,, whatever I am today as a person , as a couturier I owe it to Dannyji, I followed his advise , and he was there at my sons weddings ,, and recently I was at Chautha of Mr Madan Arora who was with Mr Danny for almost 40 years ..his passing away hit us all ,, Madanji was a great humanbeing too ,,,and helped me out with the most difficult situations ,,I miss him terribly ,,\n\nAnd Mr Danny is a fiercely private person he hates the Internet ,, is not on Facebook or Twitter ,, Once I told him someone was successfully impersonating him on Twitter ,, I am on Twitter since 2008 ,, I took his permission and reprimanded the guy who was actually a hardcore Dannyji fan.. he deleted his account as I tagged Twitter India too.\n\nNow I hope to be connected with his son Rinzing Denzongpa too once he hits the silverscreen\n\nabout mr danny\n\nDanny Denzongpa (Nepali: डेनी डेन्जोङ्पा, Hindi: डैनी डेन्जोंगपा, Tamil: டேனி டென்சோங்பா, Telugu: డానీ డెంజోంగ్ప; born 25 February 1948) is an Indian actor of Sikkimese-Bhutia descent, working in Bollywood films though he has also appeared in several Kollywood, Tollywood and Kollywood films as well. He has acted in around 190 Hindi films since 1971. He has also starred in some international projects, the most famous being Seven Years in Tibet where he acted alongside Hollywood actor Brad Pitt. In 2003, Denzongpa was awarded the Padma Shree, India's fourth highest civilian honour. Denzongpa is noted for his villainous and character roles.\n\nEarly life and education[edit]\n\nDanny was born to a Buddhist family in the Yuksom, Sikkim[2] (the 22nd state of India since 1975) where he had his early schooling, and thereafter completed his schooling from Birla Vidya Mandir and St. Joseph's College, Darjeeling, in 1964. Denzongpa's love of horses and horse riding began at an early age, as his family was into horse breeding.\n\nHe nursed an ambition to join the Indian Army and won the Best Cadet award from West Bengal and participated in the Republic Day parade. In an interview to The Times of India newspaper, he said that he had qualified for prestigious Armed Forces Medical College, Pune but withdrew admission to join Film and Television Institute of India (FTII), Pune. He decided to change his name to a simpler sounding \"Danny\" as his original name was tough to be pronounced by other students. The name has stuck since.[3]\n\nFilm and singing career[edit]\n\nDuring his early film career, Danny used to practice learning Hindi by talking to the ocean.\n\nHe started out with B-grade movies such as B.R. Ishara's Zaroorat in 1971(released in 1972), and had positive role in Mere Apne(1971). He had his first major negative role which he played in B.R.Chopra's 'Dhundh'(1973), a role which showed his power to emote. He got his major break in Gulzar's Mere Apne and later in B R Chopra's Dhund where he played a crippled and frustrated husband. Danny, in the 1970s period was increasingly open to do versatile roles but chose to do more positive roles. It is said Danny was the first choice to play the iconic role of Gabbar Singh in the film Sholay. However since he was away on the shoot of Feroz Khan film Dharmatma, eventually Gabbar's role went to Amjad Khan. He played more positive roles in commercially successful critically acclaimed films like Chor Machaye Shor, 36 Ghante, Fakira, Sangram(1976), Kalicharan, Kala Sona and Devata(1978).\n\nDanny's film career spans more than 4 decades. After his performance in the film Devata (1978) he started getting more significant lengthy roles. He was simultaneously part of big budget movies like Aashiq Hoon Baharon Ka, Paapi, Bandish, The Burning Train and Chunoti in negative roles.\n\nIn the early 1980 period, he had thought of quitting films. He said in an interview, when asked why he decided to direct a film, \"I remember in 80′s I was so fed up of the films I was doing. Those days every villain was a dacoit and I remember going on the sets where an actor called Tiwari was my henchmen and my den was a cave with lanterns. Next day I went on another set and I saw Tiwari again as my henchman, and the same lanterns. I asked myself what was I doing? I left Mumbai. I did lot of trekking and did not do films for a couple of years. I told NN Sippy about a script that I had in mind. and he asked me to direct. I made Phir Wohi Raat with Rajesh Khanna and my then girlfriend Kim.\" [4] After the success of his directorial debut, he received offers to act as the hero again in the films like Bulundi and Hum Se Badkar Kaun in 1981, which became successful. He played double role in the film Bulundi. However, most of the subsequent films of Danny between 1981-83 were not successful. Hence Danny started accepting supporting roles, often playing a character quite elder to his real age. He played Kumar Gaurav’s father in law in Love Story(1981) and Mithu Chakrabothy’s father in Boxer(1984). He started increasingly getting offers to play the negative character in Hindi films, post success of films Phir Wahi Raat, Jeeo Aur Jeene Do and Dharm Aur Qanoon. He then went on to play the roles of the villain many times since 1984. Since 1984 and through the 1990s, Danny mainly featured as the lead negative character opposite all the leading actors of those times such as Rajesh Khanna, Dharmendra, Jeetendra, Mithun Chakraborty, Vinod Khanna, Anil Kapoor and Sunny Deol.\n\nHis most applauded negative characters are in Dharm Aur Qanoon (1984) as SP Karan, Kanoon Kya Karega (1984) as Raghuvir Singh, Andar Baahar (1984) as Shera, Oonche Log (1985) as Thakur Maan Singh, Aandhi Toofan (1986), Bhagwaan Dada (1986) as Gangwaa, Agneepath (1990) as Kancha Cheena, Hum (1991) as Bakhtawar, Ghatak: Lethal as Kaatya, Krantiveer (1994) as Chatur Singh , Pukar (2000) as Abhrush and Indian as Shankar Singhania. He was pitted against Pran in the film Sanam Bewafa and 1942:A Love Story. His command over the Hindi language came in handy in films such as Sawan Kumar's Sanam Bewafa and Mukul Anand's Khuda Gawah.\n\nAt a time, when he was increasingly doing negative lead roles, Rajkumar Santoshi cast him as the positive role in China Gate(1998). In the early 2000s, Danny gave stellar performances in movies such as Asoka and 16 December (2002). Some of the antihero roles he played were an unscrupulous politician, corrupt policeman, traitor, and mingy landlord.He has also starred in some international projects, the most famous being Seven Years in Tibet where he acted alongside Hollywood actor Brad Pitt.\n\nDanny in the early 2003 decided to take a break from films as he wanted to do different but strong roles, even if it was a negative character. He appeared in only 10 films between 2003-2009.\n\nHe is an accomplished singer having sung with Lata Mangeshkar, Mohammed Rafi and Asha Bhosle, three stalwarts of Indian music. He has released Nepalese songs and has sung for Nepalese movies. His two most famous songs recorded in the 1970s but still hit are \"Chiso Chiso Hawama\" (\"In the cool air\") and \"Manko kura lai bandhi narakha...\"(\"Do not keep the words of the heart tied\"). He is also a painter, a writer and a sculptor.\n\nHe wrote and acted in the Nepali film Saino which was super hit. His nephew Ugyen Chhopel directed it. He has sung its title song and a duet with Deepa Narayan, wife of Udit Narayan. Later, this film was made in Hindi as Ajnabi as a telefilm for Doordarshan. He has sung a Nepali duet with Asha Bhosle, \"Aage aage topai ko gola pachhi pachhi machinegun barara\". R.D.Burman composed the song -Sang Mere Nikle The Sajan from the film Phir Wohi Raat - after getting inspired from melody of the Nepali folk song sung by Danny 'Aage Aage Topaiko Gola'. His all-Nepali songs are hits and people like them even today: \"Hiun vanda chiso, Aago vanda taato...\" (\"Colder than snow, hotter than fire..\"), \"Naachana hoi maichyan hau nachana\"' (\"Dance o lovely girl\"), \"Jhimkai deu pareli manma bajchha mitho murali...\" (\"Please blink your eyes and sweet sound of flute plays in the heart), \"Rato rani phulay ghai sanja ma \"etc. are his few hit numbers. He gained popularity as a singer in the period 1975-1990 especially in places like Nepal, Darjeeling, Sikkim and Assam.\n\nHe then made a strong comeback as the villain with his role in Enthiran.He made his debut in the Tamil films with Enthiran, co-starring Rajinikanth and Aishwarya Rai in the leads. Denzongpa played the antagonist role of Bohra, a prominent scientist who transforms Chitti (played by Rajinikanth) into an evil robot. He then started playing villain in big budget movies like Jai Ho (2014) co-starring Salman Khan, Bang Bang (2014) co-starring Hrithik Roshan.\n\nPersonal life[edit]\n\nDanny, who married Gawa Denzongpa, a Sikkimese princess and niece of the last chogyal from her hometown of Gangtok, currently resides in Juhu in Mumbai. Since the 2003, he has become more selective of the roles he plays.In the movies he chooses, he works on his own terms. His brother owns a bouj and beer factory in Melli, Sikkim.\n\nHonours[edit]\n\nYear From Award Won/Honored\n\n2003 Government of India Padma Shri Honoured\n\nAwards[edit]\n\nYear From Award Film Won\n\n1979 Filmfare Awards Filmfare Best Supporting Actor Award Devata No\n\n1985 Filmfare Awards Filmfare Best Supporting Actor Award Kanoon Kya Karega No\n\n1990 Filmfare Awards Filmfare Best Supporting Actor Award Agneepath No\n\n1992 Filmfare Awards Filmfare Best Supporting Actor Award Sanam Bewafa Yes\n\n1992 Filmfare Awards Filmfare Best Villain Award Hum No\n\n1994 Filmfare Awards Filmfare Best Supporting Actor Award Khuda Gawah Yes\n\n1995 Filmfare Awards Filmfare Best Villain Award Krantiveer No\n\n1995 Filmfare Awards Filmfare Best Villain Award Vijaypath No\n\n1996 Filmfare Awards Filmfare Best Villain Award Barsaat No\n\n1997 Filmfare Awards Filmfare Best Villain Award Ghatak No\n\nAs director[edit]\n\nYear Film Director\n\n1980 Phir Wahi Raat Yes\n\nUnknown Ram Yes\n\n[icon] This section requires expansion.

In 1967, he was honoured with the Padma Shri award by the Government of India.[2] His singing career spanned about 35 years. Rafi is noted for his ability to sing songs of different moods and varieties:[3] They ranged from classical numbers to patriotic songs, sad lamentations to highly romantic numbers, qawwalis to ghazals and bhajans. He is best known for romantic and duet songs and, as a playback singer, his ability to mould his voice to the persona of the actor lip-synching the song.[4]\n\nRafi is primarily noted for his songs in Hindustani, over which he had a strong command. He sang in other Indian languages including Assamese, Konkani, Bhojpuri, Oriya, Punjabi, Bengali, Marathi, Sindhi, Kannada, Gujarati, Telugu, Maghi, Maithili and Urdu. He also recorded a few songs in English, Persian, Spanish and Dutch. From available figures, Rafi sang 4,516 Hindi film songs, 112 non-Hindi film songs, and 328 private (non-film) songs from 1945 to 1980.\n\nMohammed Rafi was the fifth youngest of six brothers. The sixth youngest Mohammad Siddique is still alive and lives in Lahore, Pakistan in their ancestral house. His father was Hajji Ali Mohammad. The family originally belonged to Kotla Sultan Singh, a village near present-day Amritsar in Punjab, India.[5] Rafi, whose nickname was Pheeko, began singing by imitating the chants of a fakir in the streets of Bhati gate Lahore where his family lived.[5] Rafi's father moved to Lahore in the 1920s. His elder brother, Mohammad Deen, had a friend, Abdul Hameed, (future brother-in-law), who recognised the talent in Rafi in Lahore and encouraged him to sing. Abdul Hameed later convinced the family elders to let Rafi move to Mumbai; he accompanied him in 1944.\n\nRafi learnt classical music from Ustad Bade Ghulam Ali Khan, Ustad Abdul Wahid Khan, Pandit Jiwan Lal Mattoo and Firoze Nizami.[6][7] His first public performance came at the age of 13, when he sang in Lahore featuring K. L. Saigal.[6] In 1941, Rafi, under Shyam Sundar, made his debut in Lahore as a playback singer in the duet \"Soniye Nee, Heeriye Nee\" with Zeenat Begum in the Punjabi film Gul Baloch (released in 1944).[8] In that same year, Rafi was invited by All India Radio Lahore station to sing for them.[9]\n\nHe made his Hindi film debut in Gaon Ki Gori in 1945.[4]\n\nBombay (1944 to 1947)[edit]\n\nIn 1944, Rafi moved to Bombay. He and Hameed Sahab rented a ten-by-ten-foot room in the crowded downtown Bhendi Bazar area. Poet Tanvir Naqvi introduced him to film producers including Abdur Rashid Kardar, Mehboob Khan and actor-director Nazeer.[10] Shyam Sunder was in Mumbai and provided the opportunity to Rafi to sing a duet with GM Durrani, \"Aji dil ho qaabu mein to dildar ki aisi taisi...,\" for Gaon Ki Gori, which became Rafi’s first recorded song in a Hindi film. Other songs followed.[11]\n\nRafi's first song with Naushad was \"Hindustan Ke Hum Hain\" with Shyam Kumar, Alauddin and others, from A. R. Kardar's Pehle Aap (1944). Around the same time, Rafi recorded another song for the 1945 film Gaon Ki Gori, \"Aji Dil Ho Kaaboo Mein\". He considered this song his first Hindi language song.[9]\n\nRafi appeared in two movies. In 1945, he appeared on the screen for the song \"Tera Jalwa Jis Ne Dekha\" in the film Laila Majnu.[9] He sang a number of songs for Naushad as part of the chorus, including \"Mere Sapnon Ki Rani, Roohi Roohi\" with K. L. Saigal from the film Shahjahan (1946). Rafi sang \"Tera Khilona Toota Balak\" from Mehboob Khan's Anmol Ghadi (1946) and a duet with Noor Jehan in the 1947 film Jugnu, \"Yahan Badla Wafa Ka\".[12] After partition, Rafi decided to stay back in India and had the rest of his family flown to Mumbai. Noor Jehan migrated to Pakistan and made a pair with playback singer Ahmed Rushdi.\n\nIn 1949, Rafi was given solo songs by music directors such as Naushad (Chandni Raat, Dillagi and Dulari) Shyam Sunder (Bazaar) and Husnalal Bhagatram (Meena Bazaar).\n\nRafi was influenced by the singers of that time like K. L Saigal and, most notably, by G. M. Durrani on whose style he based his singing. He sang with his idol in some of the songs such as \"Humko Hanste Dekh Zamana Jalta Hai\" (Hum Sab Chor Hain, 1956)[13] and \"Khabar Kisi Ko Nahiin, Woh Kidhar Dekhte\" (Beqasoor, 1950),[14] etc.\n\nIn 1948, after the assassination of Mahatma Gandhi, the team of Husanlal Bhagatram-Rajendra Krishan-Rafi had overnight created the song \"Suno Suno Ae Duniyawalon, Bapuji Ki Amar Kahani\".[11] He was invited by the Indian Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, to sing at his house. In 1948, Rafi received a silver medal from Jawaharlal Nehru on Indian Independence Day.\n\nRecording career in the 1950s and 1960s[edit]\n\nSee also: List of songs by Mohammed Rafi\n\nIn his early career, Rafi associated with many contemporary music directors, most notably Naushad Ali. In the late 1950s and 1960s, he worked with other composers of the era such as O. P. Nayyar, Shankar Jaikishan, S.D. Burman and Roshan.\n\nAssociation with Naushad\n\nAs per Naushad, Rafi came to him with a letter of recommendation from Naushad's father.[15] Rafi’s first song for Naushad was \"Hindustan Ke Hum Hain\" (\"We belong to Hindustan\") for the film Pehle Aap in 1944. The first song for the duo was the soundtrack of the movie Anmol Ghadi (1946). Before Rafi, Naushad’s favorite singer was Talat Mahmood. Once Naushad found Talat smoking during a recording. He was annoyed and hired Rafi to sing all the songs of the movie Baiju Bawra.[12]\n\nRafi's association with Naushad helped the former establish himself as one of the most prominent playback singers in Hindi cinema.[9] Songs from Baiju Bawra (1952) like \"O duniya ke rakhwale\" and \"Man tarpat hari darshan ko aaj\" furthered Rafi's credentials.[8] Rafi ended up singing a total of 149 songs (81 of them solo) for Naushad.[16]\n\nIn the 1960 film Mughal-E-Azam, Mohammed Rafi sang \"Ae Mohabbat Zindabad\", composed by Naushad, with a chorus of 100 singers.[citation needed]\n\nAssociation with S D Burman\n\nS. D. Burman patronized Rafi as the singing voice of Dev Anand and Guru Dutt.[17] Rafi worked with Burman in movies like Pyaasa (1957), Kaagaz Ke Phool (1959), Tere Ghar Ke Samne (1963), Guide (1965), Aradhana (1969), and Abhimaan (1973). S. D. Burman was also another music director besides Naushad who used Rafi prolifically to sing for most of his songs.\n\nAssociation with Shankar-Jaikishan\n\nRafi's partnership with Shankar Jaikishan was among the most famous and successful in the Hindi film industry. Under Shankar-Jaikishan, Rafi produced some of his songs for actors like Shammi Kapoor and Rajendra Kumar. Out of six Filmfare awards, Rafi won three for S-J songs — \"Teri Pyari Pyari Surat Ko\", \"Baharon Phool Barsao\", and \"Dil Ke Jharokhe Mein\". The song \"Yahoo! Chahe Koi Mujhe Junglee Kahe\" was sung by Rafi, only to be matched a fast-paced orchestra and a composition by Shankar Jaikishan. S-J made Rafi give playback for Kishore Kumar in the film Shararat (\"Ajab hai daastan teri yeh zindagi\"). Rafi sang a total of 341 numbers (216 solo) for Shankar-Jaikishan.[16] Among the films of this combination are Basant Bahar, Professor, Junglee, Suraj, Brahmachari, An Evening in Paris, Dil Tera Deewana, Yakeen, Prince, Love in Tokyo, Beti Bete, Dil Ek Mandir, Dil Apna Aur Preet Parai, Gaban and Jab Pyar Kisi Se Hota Hai.\n\nAssociation with Ravi\n\nRafi got his first Filmfare Award for the title song of Chaudhvin Ka Chand (1960), composed by Ravi. He got National Award for the song \"Babul Ki Duaen Leti Ja\" from the film Neel Kamal (1968), also composed by Ravi. Rafi wept during the recording of this song. He admitted this in his interview to the BBC in 1977.[18]\n\nRavi and Rafi produced several other songs in the films China Town (1962), Kaajal (1965), and Do Badan (1966).\n\nAssociation with Madan Mohan\n\nMadan Mohan was another composer whose favorite singer was Rafi. Rafi's first solo with Madan Mohan in Ankhen (1950) was \"Hum Ishq Mein Barbad Hain Barbad Rahenge\".[9] They teamed up to produce many songs including \"Teri Aankhon Ke Siva\", \"Yeh Duniya Yeh Mehfil\" and \"Tum Jo Mil Gaye Ho\".\n\nAssociation with O. P. Nayyar\n\nRafi and O. P. Nayyar (OP) created music in the 1950s and 1960s. O. P. Nayyar was once quoted as saying \"If there had been no Mohd. Rafi, there would have been no O. P. Nayyar\".[19] He and Rafi created many songs together including \"Yeh Hai Bombay Meri Jaan\". He got Rafi to sing for singer-actor Kishore Kumar – \"Man Mora Baawara\" for the movie Raagini. Later, Rafi sang for Kishore Kumar in movies such as Baaghi, Shehzaada and Shararat. O. P. Nayyar used Rafi and Asha Bhosle for most of his songs. The team created many songs in early 1950s and 1960s for movies such as Naya Daur (1957), Tumsa Nahin Dekha (1957), and Kashmir Ki Kali (1964). Rafi sang a total of 197 numbers (56 solo) for Nayyar.[20] The songs \"Jawaaniyan yeh mast mast\" and the title song \"Yun to humne lakh hansee dekhe hain, tumsa nahin dekha\" of the film Tumsa Nahin Dekha were hits. They were followed by songs like \"Taareef karoon kya uski jisne tumhe banaya\" from Kashmir ki Kali.[21]\n\nRafi and OP had a fallout during the recording for movie \"Sawan ki Ghata\". As disclosed by OP during one of his interviews; Rafi reported late to the recording stating that he was stuck in Shankar Jaikishan's recording. OP then stated that from now on he too did not have the time for Rafi and cancelled the recording. They did not work together for the next 3 years.[22]\n\nAssociation with Laxmikant-Pyarelal\n\nThe composer duo Laxmikant-Pyarelal (L-P) patronized Rafi as one of their singers, right from their very first song by him from the film, Chaila Babu-1967. Rafi honoured the affection and commitment of the duo by accepting no payment for the song \"Tere pyaar ne mujhe gham diya\" . Rafi and L-P won the Filmfare Awards for the song \"Chahoonga Main Tujhe Saanjh Savere\" from Dosti (1964). Rafi rendered the maximum number of songs for the music director duo Laxmikant-Pyarelal: 369 numbers (186 solo) for L-P.[16]\n\nOnce, when composer Nisar Bazmi (who had migrated to Pakistan) didn’t have enough money to pay him, Rafi charged a fee of one rupee and sang for him. He also helped producers financially. As Laxmikant (of the Laxmikant-Pyarelal duo) once observed – “He always gave without thinking of the returns”.[23]\n\nBetween 1950 and 1970, Rafi was the most sought after singer in the Hindi Film industry.[24] He sang for many male stars in Hindi films.[25] In 1965, he was honoured by the Government of India with the Padma Sri award. Rafi recorded two Hindi songs in English on 7\" release in 1968. He also sang a song in Creole while on his visit to Mauritius in the late 1960s.[6] Rafi recorded two English albums as well. One of them is Pop Hits.\n\nAssociation with his Contemporary Singers\n\nRafi associated with several of his contemporaries, singing duets with them and sometimes for them (as in case of Kishore Kumar who was also an actor). Rafi sang the maximum number of duets with Asha Bhonsle (female), Manna Dey (male) and Lata Mangeshkar (female).\n\nIn the song \"Humko Tumse Ho Gaya Hai Pyaar Kya Karein\" (Amar, Akbar, Anthony), Mohd Rafi sang with Kishore Kumar, Lata Mangeshkar and Mukesh,the most legendary singers in Bollywood - all in one song. This was probably the only time that all of them rendered their voices for one song.[26]\n\nSinging career in other languages\n\nRafi sang several hit songs in Chris Perry's Konkani album Golden Hits with Lorna Cordeiro.[27]\n\nRoyalty issue[edit]\n\nIn 1962-1963, the popular female playback singer Lata Mangeshkar raised the issue of playback singers' share in the royalties. Recognizing Rafi's position as the leading male playback singer, she wanted him to back her in demanding a half-share from the 5 percent song royalty that the film's producer conceded to select composers. Lata's contention was that, there was no way producers and music directors could deny this singing duo, the royalty. Rafi stated that his claim on the filmmaker ended with his being paid his agreed fee for the song. After that, if the film proved a hit, the filmmaker was welcome to keep the Gramco (HMV) royalty he earned from it. If it did not prove to be a hit, argued Rafi, that he had already been paid the same fees for his song; so later the situation is resolved. Rafi stated that it is the producer who bets the money and the composer who creates the song, so his claim to the contribution of the song is compensated when the fees are paid. Lata viewed his stand as a stumbling block on the royalty issue and stated that it is because of the singer's name also that the records get sold. This difference of opinion subsequently led to differences between the two. During the recording of \"Tasveer Teri Dil Mein\" (Maya, 1961), Lata argued with Rafi over a certain passage of the song. Rafi felt belittled, as music director Salil Chowdhury sided with Lata. The situation worsened when Lata declared that she would no longer sing with Rafi. Rafi stated that he was only so keen to sing with Lata as she was with him.[28][29] The music director Jaikishan later negotiated a reconciliation between the two.[30]\n\nEarly 1970s[edit]\n\nIn early 1970s, Rafi recorded fewer songs. At the same period Kishore Kumar's popularity increased due to the songs he sang for the film Aradhana.[28][31] The music for Aradhana was composed by S. D. Burman, and he had used Rafi as the male playback voice for the first two recorded duets, \"Baaghon Mein Bahaar Hai\" and \"Gunguna Rahen Hain Bhanwre\".[17] After these two recordings, S. D. Burman fell ill and his son and assistant, R.D. Burman, took over the recordings. R. D. Burman got Kishore Kumar to sing the solos \"Roop Tera Mastana\" and \"Mere Sapnon Ki Rani\".\n\nDuring 1971-1973, Rafi's musical output decreased; however, he did sing several songs.[32] Some of Rafi's songs of the early 1970s were with music directors like Laxmikant-Pyarelal, Madan Mohan, R.D. Burman and S. D. Burman. These include \"Tum Mujhe Yun Bhula Na Paoge\" (a signature song of Rafi in 1971) from Pagla Kahin Ka, \"Yeh Duniya Yeh Mehfil\" from Heer Ranjha (1970), \"Jhilmil Sitaron ka\" from Jeevan Mrityu (a duet with Lata Mangeshkar, 1970), \"Gulabi Aankhen\" from The Train (1970), \"Yeh Jo Chilman Hain\" and \"Itna to Yaad Hain Mujhe\" from Mehboob Ki Mehndi (1971), \"Mera Mann Tera Pyasa\" Gambler, \"Chalo Dildar Chalo\" from 1972 released Pakeezah, \"Chura Liya Hain Tumne\" from Yaadon Ki Baarat (a duet with Asha Bhosle, 1973), \"Na tu Zameen Ke liye\" from 1973 released Dilip Kumar movie Dastan, \"Tum Jo Mil Gaye Ho\" from Hanste Zakhm (1973), \"teri bindiya re\", from Abhimaan (1973) and \"Aaj Mausam Bada Beimaan Hai\" from Loafer (1973.)\n\nLater years[edit]\n\nRafi made a comeback as a leading singer in 1974. That year, he won the Film World magazine Best Singer Award for the song \"Teree Galiyon Mein Na Rakhenge Qadam Aaj Ke Baad\" (Hawas, 1974) composed by Usha Khanna.[16]\n\nIn 1977, he won both Filmfare Award and the National Award for the song \"Kya Hua Tera Wada\" from the movie Hum Kisise Kum Naheen, composed by R.D. Burman.[17] Rafi sang for Rishi Kapoor in films like Laila Majnu (for which music was given by two composers Madan Mohan, and after his death by Jaidev), Amar Akbar Anthony (1977), Sargam (1979) and Karz (1980). The qawwali \"Pardah Hai Pardah\" from Amar Akbar Anthony (1977) was a superhit. Rafi's notable renderings in the late 1970s and early 1980s include Bairaag (1976), Laila Majnu (1976), Apnapan (1978), Suhaag (1979), Qurbani, Dostana (1980), The Burning Train (1980), Naseeb (1981), Abdullah (1980), Shaan (1980), Asha (1980), Aap To Aise Na The (1980), and Zamane Ko Dikhana Hai (1982).\n\nIn December 1979, Rafi recorded six songs for the Hindi remake of Dilip Sen's Bengali superhit Sorry Madam; the film was never completed due to a personal tragedy in Dilip Sen's life. These songs, written by Kafeel Aazar and composed by Chitragupta, were released digitally in December 2009 by the label Silk Road under the title \"The Last Songs\". The physical album was released only in India by Universal.\n\nGuinness World Records controversy[edit]\n\nDuring his last years, Rafi was involved in a controversy over Lata Mangeshkar's entry in the Guinness Book of World Records. In a letter dated 11 June 1977 to the Guinness Book of World Records, Rafi had challenged the claim that Lata Mangeshkar has recorded the maximum number of songs (\"not less than 25,000\" according to Guinness). After receiving a reply from Guinness, in a letter dated 20 November 1979, he wrote, \"I am disappointed that my request for a reassessment vis-a-vis Ms Mangeshkar's reported world record has gone unheeded.\"[26] In an interview to BBC recorded in November 1977, Rafi claimed to have sung 25,000 to 26,000 songs till then.[19]\n\nAfter Rafi's death, in its 1984 edition, the Guinness Book of World Records gave Lata Mangeshkar's name for the \"Most Recordings\" and stated, \"Mohammad Rafi (d 1 August 1980) [sic] claimed to have recorded 28,000 songs in 11 Indian languages between 1944 and April 1980.\"[33] According to the available figures, Rafi has sung 4,516 Hindi film songs, 112 non-Hindi film songs, and 328 private (non-film) songs from 1945 to 1980.[33] The Guinness Book entries for Rafi and Lata were removed in 1991.[34] In 2011, Lata's sister Asha Bhosle was given the title.[35]\n\nDeath[edit]\n\nRafi died at 10:50 p.m. on 31 July 1980, following a heart attack.[36] His last song was \"Shaam phir kyun udaas hai dost\" (Aas Paas), which he had recorded with Laxmikant-Pyarelal a few hours before his death.[26][37]\n\nRafi was buried at the Juhu Muslim cemetery.[38] His was one of the biggest funeral processions Mumbai had ever witnessed, with over 10,000 people attending.[39][40]\n\nIn 2010, his tomb was demolished to make space for new burials. Fans of Mohammed Rafi who visit his tomb twice a year to mark his birth and death anniversary use the coconut tree nearest to his grave as a marker.[41]\n\nLegacy[edit]\n\nSingers like Shabbir Kumar, Mohammed Aziz and, more recently, Sonu Nigam, made their names by adopting Rafi's style.[42]\n\nOn 22 September 2007, a shrine to Rafi designed by artist Tasawar Bashir was unveiled on Fazeley Street, Birmingham, UK. Bashir is hoping that Rafi will attain sainthood as a result.[43][44] The Padma Shri Mohammed Rafi Chowk in the Bandra suburb of Mumbai and Pune (extending MG Road) is named after Rafi.[45]\n\nIn the summer of 2008, the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra released a double CD titled Rafi Resurrected comprising 16 songs by Rafi. Bollywood playback singer Sonu Nigam provided the vocals for this project and toured with the CBSO in July 2008 at venues including the English National Opera in London, Manchester's Apollo Theatre and Symphony Hall, Birmingham.[46]\n\nIn June 2010, Rafi along with Lata Mangeshkar was voted the most popular playback singer in the Outlook Music Poll, conducted by Outlook magazine.[47] The same poll voted \"Man re, tu kahe na Dheer Dhare\" (Chitralekha, 1964), sung by Rafi as the #1 song.[48] Three songs were tied for the #2 place: Two were sung by Rafi. The songs were \"Tere Mere Sapne Ab Ek Rang Hain\" (Guide, 1965) and \"Din Dhal Jaye, hai raat na jaye\" (Guide, 1965). This poll was published in Outlook. The jury included people in the Indian music industry: Abhijeet, Adesh Srivastava, Alisha Chinai, Anu Malik, Ehsaan, Gulzar, Hariharan, Himesh Reshammiya, Jatin, Javed Akhtar, Kailash Kher, Kavita Krishnamurthy, Khayyam, Kumar Sanu, Lalit, Loy, Mahalaxmi Iyer, Mahendra Kapoor, Manna Dey, Prasoon Joshi, Rajesh Roshan, Sadhna Sargam, Sameer, Sandesh Shandilya, Shaan, Shankar, Shantanu Moitra, Shreya Ghoshal, Sonu Nigam and Talat Aziz.[49]\n\nIn an article in Times of India, Rafi is described as \"a versatile singer, who could render classical, rock and roll, indeed any kind of song with ease, he was Hindi film's, favourite male voice through the 1950s and 1960s\". Music director Rajesh Roshan, who composed some of the songs with Rafi, remembers him as \"a warm-hearted simple person with no ego\".[50]\n\nThere have been appeals [51] to the Government of India to honour the singer, posthumously, with the Bharat Ratna (India's Highest Civilian Award)[11]\n\nClassical and playback singer Manna Dey, who was also a contemporary of Rafi said, \"Rafi and I could sing everything, and he was such a gentleman. He was a better singer than me, and I will say this - that no one came even close to him! He deserved everything he got! We had a great understanding and it was never about one-upmanship\".[52][53] Veteran actor Shammi Kapoor said, \"I am incomplete without Mohammad Rafi. I used to often go for the recording of my song, which was sung by Mohammad Rafi, only because I used to like telling him how I would perform on this song on screen so that he can sing it that way. Even he liked my involvement\".[54]\n\nOver 9,000 musical tributes were organized in July 2011 commemorating the 31st anniversary of the singer's death.[55] A documentary about Rafi’s life is under production by the Films Division of India.[56]\n\nRafi's Baharon Phool Barsao was voted the most popular Hindi song in a BBC Asia Network poll commemorating 100 years of Hindi Cinema.[57] In a CNN-IBN survey in 2013, he was voted the greatest voice of Hindi Cinema.[58]\n\nPopular culture[edit]\n\nMohammed Rafi Academy was launched in Mumbai on 31 July 2010 on the 30th anniversary of the singer's death, started by his son Sahid Rafi to impart training in Indian classical and contemporary music.[59][60]\n\nAfter his death, seven Hindi movies were dedicated to Mohd Rafi: Allah Rakha, Mard, Coolie, Desh-Premee, Naseeb, Aas-Paas and Heeralal-Pannalal.[citation needed]\n\nRafi is one of the recording artists mentioned in the 1997 hit British alternative rock song \"Brimful of Asha\" by Cornershop.\n\nRafi's song from the film Gumnaam (1965), \"Jaan Pehechan Ho\", was used on the soundtrack of Ghost World (2001). The film opens with the lead character dancing around in her bedroom to a video of Gumnaam.[61] The song has also been used for Heineken's 2011 \"The Date\" commercial.[62][63]\n\nHis \"Aaj Mausam Bada Beiman Hai\" is featured in the 2001 film Monsoon Wedding.[64] His song \"Mera Man Tera Pyasa\" (Gambler, 1970) has been used as one of the soundtracks in the Jim Carrey-Kate Winslet starrer Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (2004). This song is played in the background in Kate Winslet's character's home while the lead pair are having a drink (at approximately 00.11.14 runtime).[65]\n\nPersonal life[edit]\n\nRafi married twice; his first marriage was to his cousin; Bashira[66] and took place in his ancestral village.[67] The marriage ended when his first wife refused to live in India following the killing of her parents during the riots of Partition of India and moved to Lahore, Pakistan.[68]\n\nRafi had four sons and three daughters. He was very much a family man, following a recording-room, to home and to recording-room itinerary. He rarely attended film parties, did not smoke or drink, was religious, and was considered a humble man.[69] He used to perform his riyaz (musical practice) regularly. His only indulgences were playing carom, badminton, and flying kites.[11]\n\nPrem Chopra (Devanagari: प्रेम चोपड़ा) (born September 23, 1935)is an actor in Hindi and Punjabi films. He has acted in 320 films over a span of over 50 years. He has a soft spoken diction despite being a villain in most films.\n\nPrem Chopra, the third of six children of Ranbirlal and Rooprani Chopra,a Punjabi Hindu family, was born on 23 September 1935, in Lahore.[1][2] He was third of six children. After the partition of India, his family moved to Shimla, where he was brought up.[1] His father desired that Prem be a doctor or an Indian Administrative Services officer.[3]\n\nPrem Chopra completed his schooling and college from Shimla after his father who was a government servant got transferred to there.[4]He graduated from Punjab University.[2] He took part in college dramatics enthusiastically.At his father's insistence he completed his graduation and then came to Mumbai.[3]Soon after he did his debut film, his mother was detected with mouth cancer and she died leaving his then nine-year-old sister Anju to be looked after by his father and his four other brothers.The brothers had given warning to their respective wives that only if their sister is happy would they be happy and Prem considers his sister as his first daughter.[5] Noted writer-director Lekh Tandon brought the proposal of Uma for mairrage to Prem. Uma was the younger sister of the siblings Krishna Kapoor, Prem Nath and Rajendranath.[3] The couple have three daughters, Rakita, Punita and Prerna Chopra.[6] Rakita, is married to film publicity designer Rahul Nanda. Punita owns a pre-school called Wind Chimes in Bandra, suburban Mumbai, and is married to singer and television actor, Vikas Bhalla.Prerna, is married to Bollywood actor Sharman Joshi.[7]He currently resides in a duplex apartment in Pali Hill, Bandra in Mumbai.[3]\n\nHis relation with two of his 4 brothers got estranged in late 1980's.Prem Chopra had bought a bunglow in 1980 in Delhi, which was jointly owned by him and his father and where his father and his one brothers used to stay there.Prem had got his brother a job in Delhi and made him stay at this bunglow. But his father, a day before his death, was made to sign a will favouring one of his brothers, taking away Prem's rights in the bunglow.[5]Later an income tax raid happened in that same house and his brother said in the raid that Prem had gifted them the bunglow and so the house still is in name of Prem Chopra.[5] Prem had two other houses in Mumbai also, which were sold off cheaply by his other brothers without telling him as they needed the money.[5]\n\nEarly Career 1961-67[edit]\n\nIt was in Shimla that Prem Chopra developed an interest in acting as he had begun to take part in quite a few plays in his college days. Despite facing stiff opposition from his parents, he managed to come to Mumbai to pursue his dream of acting in Bollywood films.[4] In his initial days he stayed he stayed at various guest-houses in Colaba, Mumbai.[3]He started visiting film studios to display his portfolio and the response was not encouraging.[8] While Prem was in Times of India, he looked after circulation of paper in Bengal, Orissa and Bihar and was required to tour 20 days a month. Prem used to cut his touring time by calling the agents to come and meet him at the station itself so that he could quickly return and this way a tour that would normally take 20 days would get completed in 12 and he would spend the rest of the time going from one studio to the other.[5] While travelling by the suburban train one day, a stranger accosted him and asked if he was interested in joining films. Chopra nodded in agreement and went with that stranger to Ranjit Studios where the producers of Chaudhari Karnail Singh were in search of a hero.[8] Jagjit Sethi, a Punjabi producer, gave him the break as Jabeen's hero in Chaudhary Karnail Singh, a Punjabli film. His debut film was a Hindu-Muslim romantic love story set against the backdrop of Indo-Pak partition and it turned out to be a big hit and the film even won the National award.[3] He was paid Rs 2500 for his debut film.[8] The movie took almost three years to complete. In order to survive in the fast life of Mumbai, he took up a job with The Times of India while trying to gain a foothold in the film industry. During his stint with the Times of India, he worked in Punjabi films including Sapani and Hindi films such as Woh Kaun Thi, Shaheed, Main Shaadi Karne Chala and Teesri Manzil.[2]Prem did not consider acting as a full time profession in the early 60's and he kept trying to get roles for him in films due to his passion for acting.Among his early films he played Sukhdev in Shaheed, one of his rare positive leading roles. Prem had done 4 movies before Woh Kaun Thi, a box-office hit of 1964, had released.It was on sets of Woh Kaun Thi which had Manoj Kumar as lead hero where Prem met Manoj for the very first time. Manoj offered Prem a positive role in Shaheed, for which Manoj was the presenter. It was during the shooting of Main Shadi Karne Chala that someone suggested that he become a villain.[8] He continued working with TOI, when already he was part of box-office hits like Nishan,Sikandar E Azam in 1965 and Sagaai, Mera Saaya in 1966. After Teesri Manzil and Upkaar, he was flooded with films as a villain. After Upkaar in 1967, he left The Times of India to concentrate solely on acting.[1]\n\n1969-1994[edit]\n\nHe has since 1967 been a leading villain in Hindi films and his peak period as main villain in Hindi films was from 1967-1994. In 70's he got plum roles as a villain often with Sujith Kumar and Ranjeet. In few films he played secondary villain to villainous characters of Ajit, Madan Puri, Pran, Jeevan in 70's and 80;s and to Amrish Puri and Amjad Khan's in the late 80's. In the critically acclaimed comedy film Hulchul (1971), played the lead hero in this suspense thriller and was not a villain. He played the main lead in 1970 box-office hit small budget comedy film Samaj Ko Badal Dalo as lead hero and was paired opposite Tamil actresses Kanchana and Shardha. The song sung by Rafi and picturised on Prem Chopra -Tum Apni Saheli Ko Itna Bata Do Ki Usse Koi Pyar Karne Laga Hai from this 1970 film and the song Rah Mein Kaliya - a song sung by Kishore Kumar and performed on-screen by Prem Chopra in the film Nafrat(1973), a box-office flop in 1973, continues to be popular. The dialogue \" Prem naam hai mera, Prem Chopra\" (My name is Prem, Prem Chopra) from the film Bobby has been very popular. Another famous Prem Chopra dialogue is from film Souten - \"Main wo bala hoon jo sheshay se pathar ko todtee hai\" which closely translates to \"I am that trouble which crushes stones with glass\".He was the regular in villanious role in the films with Rajesh Khanna in the lead role from 1969-1991 from Doli(1969) till Ghar Parivaar(1991). The duo of Prem and Rajesh Khanna acted in 19 films together and had 15 of them as box office hits and were very close friends in real life till Khanna's death. Prem quoted in an interview \"Rajesh Khanna and I were considered a lucky pair and distributors used to tell Rajesh Khanna that we don't care who your heroine is, all we want to know is whether Prem Chopra is in the film.\"[9] He also mouthed dialogues in the song Aaj Pila Dey Saathi Apni sung by Mahnedra Kapoor from the film Doli(1969).He also mouthed dialogs in the song Lo Mera Pyar Lelo from Nafrat in 1973 with Asha Bhosle and Kab Se Ye Dil Hai Pyaasa from Mera Muqaddar in 1988.\n\n1995-present[edit]\n\nAfter 1995, he appeared as a villain in very few films. He took up positive character roles from 1996 and started getting more positive roles from 2005.His screen space got reduced in the films after 2005.\n\nHe had a good career spanning 50 years and was popular for villain roles in Bollywood.Prem Chopra regards his best roles were in Shaheed (1965), Upkaar (1967), Purab Aur Pashchim, Do Raaste (1969), Kati Patang (1970),Do Anjaane (1976),Jaadu Tona (1977), Kala Sona, Dostana (1980), Kranti (1981), Phool Bane Angaarey (1991),Bewaffa Se Waffa.[10][9][11][12]He regards his best performances in positive roles came in Sikander-e-Azam, Kunwari, Shaheed, Jaadu Tona, Prem Pratiggya,Chori Chori Chupke Chupke.[9] He quoted in an interview \"Although I came to be a hero, my films as a leading man flopped. Which was good in a way because a whole new world opened in front of me. There were so many more roles I could do. When I established myself as a villain it could continue for years.\"[9]\n\nAwards[edit]\n\n1976 - Filmfare Best Supporting Actor Award for his role in Do Anjaane\n\n2004 - Legend of Indian Cinema Award at Atlantic City [13][dead link]\n\nAmongst other awards won the Giants[clarification needed] honoured him with the \"Lifetime Achievement Award\".
