He begins to take on Gandhi’s pacifist principles, but is no ordinary Gandhian, believing he is the reincarnation of the Mahatma itself. In the process Gadhvi attracts more and more followers, but also enemies seeking to bring him down, including hired-gun, Omkar, who has been tasked with suppressing the swelling anger against the establishment by shattering Gadhvi’s delusion and crushing his core beliefs. Gaurav Bakshi’s debut feature is a sharp social and political satire that plays out like a thriller where the audience is left guessing about who Gadhvi really is and if he is actually Gandhi’s reincarnation.\n\nPlease note there are no adverts before festival screenings so we encourage you to arrive in good time.\n\nQ&A with Director, Gaurav Bakshi\n\n72 Miles - Ek Pravas (72 Miles - A Journey)\n\nLIFF Festival Screening: 2013\n\nDirector: Rajeev Patil\n\nStarring: Smita Tambe, Chinmay Sant, Chinmay Kambli, Sharvani Solaskar, Isha Mane.\n\nRun time: 96 mins | Certificate: 12A | Year: 2013\n\nLanguage: Marathi with English subtitles | Country: India\n\nAshok, a 13-year-old boy in 1970s India, is sent away to a borstal boarding school for disciplinary reasons cannot cope with the harsh rigours of the establishment and runs way.

He approaches the reigning superstar Arun Chatterjee (played by real-life super-hero Prasenjit Chatterjee) with the proposal.\n\nMuch to his surprise the movie-god agrees to fund the film and be its lead. Shubhobroto celebrates with his live-in girlfriend and budding actress Srinandita (Sen) and he drafts her in to play the film’s female lead.

It also gives Tashi a chance to consider whether he wants to settle down to a suburban marriage with his nice airhostess and Mummy and Daddy in-laws, or take a bite of the wild side. Expect rickshaw chases, upset stomachs and of course, a riot of mix-ups and chases, with unsuspecting English tourists ducking for cover.\n\nEXPERIMENTA INDIA - LIFF @ THE TATE MODERN\n\nLIFF Festival Screening: 2012\n\n|\n\nEXPERIMENTA INDIA – LIFF @ THE TATE MODERN\n\nAlongside the commercial cinema of narrative and spectacle in India, there has always been another practice call it avant-garde, experimental, or artists’ film and video.

This film reflects the subconscious of migrant workers against an urban landscape in metamorphosis. As they carry their stories in and out of many cities, the cities bear witness to these fragments.

Drama unfolds via dreams, appearances of djinns and disappearances of women. The shrine becomes a space for expressions of longing and transgression. The film invites the viewer to a fantastical world, where fear and desire is experienced through dreams and ‘afflictions of air’. The shrine is a space where performance becomes the only rule of engagement, and one can begin to think about the possibilities that ‘insanity’ produces.\n\nGandu & Gandu Circus\n\nLIFF Festival Screening: 2012\n\nDirector: Q.\n\nStarring: Anurbata Basu, Joyraj Bhattacharya, Rituparna Sen\n\nRun time: 89 mins | Certificate: 18 | Year: 2010\n\nLanguage: Bengali with English subtitles | Country: India\n\nIndia’s most radical director Q delivers a tour de force, which has excited festivals around the world.

He is unexpectedly thrown into the bigger circus of life where he has to now juggle between his role as a father and that of a performer, all without a safety net. Facing a crisis of confidence as an artist, he must now brave the odds for one last shot at the sparkling lights of show business. He loses a little of himself in a world that has little space for dreams. Along the journey he realises that to do what he wants, he’ll do what he has to do. Kumud Mishra, known for his roles in Bollywood blockbusters like Rockstar and Airlift, delivers the performance of his life as Charlie, blending pathos and comedy into a bravura package. This is one of those rare films that will have you wiping a tear while at the same time grinning broadly.\n\nSahjan Kooner: dankEconogy1_ALIENVillage\n\nLIFF Festival Screening: 2023\n\n|\n\n12-5pm Weds – Sat, until 16 December 2023\n\nPerformance 7pm Fri 3 November.\n\nIncidental Artist, Sahjan Kooner, welcomes you to a multi-stranded project – exhibition, video, games, sculpture, sound – exploring themes of the village and all they encompass. The village was born in North India, it was later reborn as a vessel. It will visit many sites in the future.

It will have visitations on Earth. The sites of the visits will be evolving and sprawling transformations of architectures, educations, performances, smells, technologies and world making exercises.\n\nThis a space to conjure another set of polyphonic futures, where we gather together to experience the reverberations of time and space. Come and discover the traces of love, longing and possibility that make life possible and realise that we can work together to make another end of the world possible – one that houses all of us.\n\ndankEconogy1_ALIENVillage is a speculative commons.

Shekhar Kapur trained as a chartered accountant in London at the behest of his parents, but later bucked middle- class tradition by becoming an actor in Mumbai with the film Jaan Hazir Hai (1975). Switching to a directorial role Shekhar came to prominence with films like Masoom (1983) and his greatest Indian hit Mr India (1987), one of the most-loved Bollywood films of all time, with Amrish Puri as the timeless villain Mogambo! Unlike most other successful Indian directors who have remained fixed within the Bollywood canon, Shekhar jumped into the global frame with Channel Four’s hit film Bandit Queen (1994), introducing Seema Biswas to the world as a groundbreaking female desperado. Kapur continues to work tirelessly in film and television from Bollywood to LA.\n\nShekhar Kapur will be presented with the Sun Mark Ltd LIFF Icon Award© for his outstanding contribution to cinema.\n\nShongram (Struggle) | World Premiere\n\nLIFF Festival Screening: 2014\n\nDirector: Munsur Ali\n\nStarring: Anupam Kher, Asia Argento, Amaan Reza, Dilruba Yasmeen Ruhee.\n\nRun time: 103 mins | Certificate: 15 | Year: 2014\n\nLanguage: Bangla with English subtitles | Country: Bangladesh / UK\n\nIn this powerful romantic drama set during the 1971 liberation struggle of Bangladesh, a London reporter interviews a British Bengali on his deathbed, where four decades later, Karim is able to recall and finally share his past. We are transported to 1971, when Bangladesh was still East Pakistan and a young Karim (a Muslim) is in love with a beautiful Asha (a Hindu). Their peaceful village life is suddenly interrupted by war and Karim must grow up fast to survive in an era where mass killings and abduction was common. He must also carry out his duty to his people and seek revenge before he can finally search for Asha, who has gone missing. Bangladesh’s stunning vistas are captured as never seen before and act as a counterpoint to the brutal horrors of war. Profound, potent and poignant, the emotional swoop of this mesmerising film will enthral, entertain and educate in equal measure.\n\nShukno Lanka (Dry Red Chillies)\n\nLIFF Festival Screening: 2011\n\nDirector: Gaurav Pandey\n\nStarring: Mithun Chakraborty, Sabyasachi Chakraborty\n\nRun time: 110 mins | Certificate: 18 | Year: 2010\n\nLanguage: Hindi | Country: India\n\nIt may be a surprise to some that actor Mithun Chakraborty, Bollywood’s original Disco Dancer, is also a fine performer with some serious acting chops, having won the coveted Best Actor gong at India’s National Film Awards twice and Best Supporting Actor once. Here, he plays a veteran, bit-part actor Chinu Nandy, in the commercial Bengali film industry (aka Tollywood).\n\nNandy has resigned himself to lesser roles in the shadows of younger and less talented heroes, but gets the shock of his life when an award-winning director Joy Sundar Sen (Sabyasachi) decides to cast him as the lead in his next big film. Nandy feels distinctly uncomfortable with his return to the spotlight, but supported by his wife, musters his energy for his greatest performance.\n\nThis well scripted tale manages the triple feats of humorously skewering Tollywood practices, lampooning pretentious art-house filmmakers, but above all celebrating the pleasures of a happy marriage and growing old with your partner. This is a film that will leave you with a tear in your eye and a smile on your lips.\n\nSulemani Keeda (Writers) | European Premiere\n\nLIFF Festival Screening: 2014\n\nDirector: Amit V Masurkar\n\nStarring: Naveen Kasturia, Mayank Tewari, Aditi Vasudev.\n\nRun time: 89 mins | Certificate: 15 | Year: 2014\n\nLanguage: Hindi with English subtitles | Country: India / US\n\nTwo struggling writers dare to dream big and try to peddle their screenplay in Bollywood. Perennially hungry and horny, they lie, drink, hit on unsuspecting girls in bookshops and attend poetry readings where they read their vulgar verses. Things look bright when they meet a bizarre wannabe auteur who wants to make a film inspired by Tarkovsky and commissions them to come up with a script idea. When one of the writers falls in love with a woman who is leaving India in a matter of days, he is faced with a choice – whether to co-write a film he doesn’t believe in or woo the girl he has fallen in love with. This racy romp through the filmi underbelly of suburban Mumbai is also richly populated with a host of Bollywood celebrities in cameos, playing themselves. We’re not telling you who they are – come and find out for yourselves!\n\nThe Pink Shirt\n\nLIFF Festival Screening: 2023\n\nDirector: Kashif Nisar\n\nStarring: Sajal Aly, Wahaj Ali\n\nRun time: 95 mins | Certificate: 12A | Year: 2023\n\nLanguage: English, Urdu with English Subtitles | Country: Pakistan, India\n\nIn a special presentation, the London Indian Film Festival is bringing the first three episodes of Zee Zindagi Original drama The Pink Shirt to the big screen.

Patwardhan initially follows activists, rationalists and dissenters Narendra Dabholkar and Govind Pansare and then broadens his gaze to look at questions of communism, caste and freedom of speech. What Patwardhan depicts is not pretty, portraying as it does India’s rapid march towards being a right wing nation where free speech is muzzled by any means necessary, including murder. A riveting and sobering film that will inform, agitate and frustrate in equal measure, Reason is a must watch, and is perhaps the most important film to emerge from India in recent years.\n\nPlease remember there are no adverts before festival screenings so we encourage you to arrive in good time.\n\nQ&A with Director, Anand Patwardhan\n\nWidow of Silence\n\nLIFF Festival Screening: 2019\n\nDirector: Praveen Morchhale\n\nStarring: Shilpa Marwaha, Ajay Chourey, Bilal Ahmad\n\nRun time: 85 mins | Certificate: 15 | Year: 2018\n\nLanguage: Urdu with English subtitles | Country: India\n\nLife for half-widows in Kashmir can be dire, with many hurdles to cross to maintain even a routine existence.

With her life in limbo, unable to either re-marry, or settle her considerable financial debt without a death certificate, a conniving government official looks to take advantage, forcing Aasia to make difficult decisions to overcome her absurd plight.
