        "text": "This essay explores the past and present complexities of filmmaking in Pakistan with reference to the articles in this dossier. Its conceptualisation of ‘Pakistani cinema’ tackles the problem of categorising and studying ‘national’ industries too strictly with the official languages of South Asian nation-states, in particular common sense pairings that tie Indian cinema exclusively to Hindi films, Pakistani to Urdu and Bangladeshi to Bengali. At the same time, I tentatively explore national specificities through regional comparisons of form and content. With respect to recent excitement within the media about a ‘New Wave’ and multiplex exhibition, the essay identifies an elitist South Asian value system which privileges middle-class cinematic ideals and fetishizes certain technologies as pathways to ‘progress’ within the media and urban planning. I conclude with a summary of the argument and by noting several other possible avenues that might be fruitfully explored in future research.\n\nThis paper investigates the impulses, motives and conditions that are positively associated and problems, hurdles and concerns that are the obstacles in the resurgence of 21st century Pakistani film industry. It also gauges the priorities and concerns of young moviegoers and compares with the priorities and concerns of our young generation of filmmakers. To achieve this end we employed both qualitative and quantitative research methodologies and came up with following results that Pakistan's screen to film production ratio is one of the best in the world. It is vehemently in search of its distinctive identity and plays, sometimes immaturely, with different genres are evidence to it. We see a visible drift from conventional Indo Pak Masala genre to social drama, physical reality, war movies and Wuxia.\n\n‘Art does not go global because its creator is consciously working towards a worldwide impact.’ It ought to be straightforward to present a description of the ‘world’s biggest film industry’, but Indian film scholars find it difficult to come to terms with its diversity and seeming contradictions. The biggest single mistake that non-Indian commentators make is to assume that ‘Indian Film Industry ’ is the same thing as Indian Cinema. It is not. The Indian film industry is always changing and as traditional cinemas close in the South and more multiplexes open, there may be a shift towards main stream Hindi films. But the South is building multiplexes too and it is worth noting that Hollywood distributors have started to release films in India dubbed into several languages. India's various popular cinemas are not all alike, and the differences among them are not restricted to language. They address different identities; the language communities sometimes transcend national boundaries, as when Tamil cinema is followed avidly in Malaysia. \"Bollywood\" is a recent, global appellation, but mainstream Hindi cinema tried to address national concerns even under colonial rule. When the English-spoken media in India clamour for a better quality of cinema, what they desire is a cinema that is forged in the Western tradition of storytelling and narrative. Key words: Globalization, Indian Films, economy, social impact, global themes, audience in transition.\n\nThe main aim of this research paper is to study the recent transformation in south Indian film industry. A case study approach is used in this research paper to analyze the recent transformations. This research considers the Pan India movies like Bahubali- The beginning, Bahubali-The conclusion, KGF-I, KGF-2 and Ponniyin Selvan-I and their impact on Indian film industry. The above mentioned movies totally transform the way of outlook regarding the undermining of regional south Indian film industry. Those selected movies not only gets highest box office collection but also transformed the film making methods belongs to south Indian film industry. Because of this biggest transformation a steady competition and challenges arises between the dominant film industries like Bollywood, Kollywood as well as Telugu film industry. This healthy competition between these dominant film industries of India gives many more opportunities to explore worldwide market. Those films have strong heroism as well as strong hero portrayal. The hero portrayal of those films strongly supports the heroism science. Films like KGF-1, and KGF-2 entirely challenges the conventional portrayal of hero characterization. Even though more violent scenes are present in those movies, the logical behind the actions of those film’s protagonist characters are well explained without any questions. The identity searching of the main characters are well defined in those movies. Movies like KGF series, Bahubali-1, Bahubali-2, Ponniyin Selvan-I set a new standards to south Indian film industry. Bahubali series sets a new record in box office collection throughout the world. The visual effects shots, and animation portions of the Bahubali series of movies expanses the possibilities of imaginations and filmmaking styles. The films like KGF-1 and KGF-2 entirely changes the portrayal of hero characterization."
