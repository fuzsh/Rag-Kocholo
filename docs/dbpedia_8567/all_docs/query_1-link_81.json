Ravi stayed with his family in Jaunpur till he was seventeen years old and helped his family with farming on their ancestral land. While giving an interview, Ravi talked about it and said,\n\nI stayed in Jaunpur for seven years and was simply not interested in studying. We just had some land on which we would do farming and were very poor. We lived in a mud house and could not even afford a sari for my mother on Diwali. I hated the thought of not being in Mumbai and felt I would either die or turn mad or become a goonda.”\n\nTo help his family financially, Ravi used to work as a newspaper seller as a child in Jaunpur.\n\nRavi met his wife Preeti when he was studying in class 11.\n\nWhile growing up in Jaunpur, he would play the role of Sita in the Ramleela; however, his father didn’t like this, and he didn’t want him to pursue a career in acting.\n\nIn an interview, Ravi talked about his troubled relationship with his father and said that his father even wanted to kill him, and when he turned 17, his mother gave him Rs. 500 and asked him to run away from home to pursue his dream of becoming an actor in Mumbai. Ravi said,\n\nMy father was beating me very badly and he was hammering me. He wanted to kill me and my mother was aware that her husband is capable of killing me and he will not hesitate because priests have less emotions. So she said ‘bhaag jao.’”\n\nHis debut film ‘Pitambar’ was a B-grade for which he was paid Rs. 5000. While giving an interview, Ravi said,\n\nI ran away from home to come to Mumbai. I then stayed in our old 10×12 sq ft place and met an old friend Hriday Shetty, who introduced me to a filmmaker. I got my first B-grade film Pitambar and made my first 5000.
