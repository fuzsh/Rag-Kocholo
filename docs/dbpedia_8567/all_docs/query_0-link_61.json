On September 8, actor Rhea Chakraborty was arrested in connection with Rajputs death and was recently granted bail after nearly a month since her arrest.\n\nCelebrities Urge Public to Stay Calm as Mumbai Faces Major Power Outage\n\nAs Mumbai faced a massive power outage on Monday, affecting nearly 50 lakh homes and operational businesses, celebrities from the Hindi film industry on Twitter urged people to maintain calm.\n\nPower supply was later gradually restored.\n\nReacting to the incident, veteran actor Amitabh Bachchan tweeted: “T 3688 – Entire city in power outage .. somehow managing this message .. keep calm all shall be well ..”\n\nAnnouncing that internet dongles were working, he wrote: “T 368 – ..

Missed you #MumbaiPowerFailure,” wrote The Lunchbox actor Nimrat Kaur, while actor Nikita Dutta wrote: “Power cut and 9 percent phone battery. What fun!”\n\nOn Monday morning, Mumbai was brought to a standstill after power went off across the city. The Indian Express reported that suburban train services were shut down for nearly two hours, forcing commuters to switch to other modes of transport. Water supply was impacted at the city’s suburbs. The Bombay High Court had to postpone hearings, while traffic signals stopped functioning.\n\nAccording to Maharashtra’s power minister Nitin Raut, electricity supply was interrupted around 10 am due to maintenance and repair work at Maharashtra State Electricity Transmission Company’s 400 kv Kalwa-Padgha Centre.\n\nIn a tweet, he explained that the power outages in Thane, Palghar and Navi Mumbai were caused because the Kalwa-Padgha transmission line tripped.\n\nSatyameva Jayate 2: Santosh Shukla to Play Antagonist\n\nActor Santosh Shukla will be seen playing the role of an antagonist in John Abraham‘s Satyameva Jayate 2 directed by Milap Zaveri.\n\nThe Times of India reported that Shukla, who was last seen in Salman Khan’s Jai Ho, will be seen next in the sequel to the 2018 film Satyameva Jayate.\n\nThe sequel will feature Abraham and Divya Khosla Kumar in lead roles, along with Manoj Bajpayee, Daya Shankar Pandey and Nora Fatehi in supporting roles.\n\n“This film is special, because it reminds me of all the movies I have grown up watching in the ’90s. I love that decade, especially the music created at the time. It is also synonymous with quintessential masala films, which were a treat to watch at single screens. I still remember when there was euphoria around a popular dialogue or action sequence, people would throw coins at the screen. We hardly make such films now, because filmmakers, today, have a rather realistic approach towards cinema. But thank god for Milap Zaveri, he doesn’t let you forget the classic ’90s-style cinema,” Shukla told E Times.\n\nTalking about his prep for the film, he said: “I have learnt martial arts and have become quite flexible and athletic now. I have also experimented with my looks. I am sporting short hair and a dense beard in the film.”\n\nThe first look poster of the film was released last October.\n\nThe sequel was slated to release on October 2, 2020. It was delayed due to the Covid-19 pandemic and the consequent lockdown.

The trailer should be deleted from YouTube and the censor board should ensure that this film is not released.”\n\nOn November 27, 2019, the veterinarian was abducted by four people from a toll plaza on Outer Ring Road in Cyberabad limits. A day later, her charred body was found at an underpass in Shadnagar. On December 6, the Cyberabad police, gunned down the four accused after they allegedly attempted to flee during a reconstruction of the crime scene.\n\n“He has cast an actor who looks like my daughter, everything about the movie looks like it is about the incident, and despite this, he is saying it is about Disha which means a ‘path’. Do people believe that? He should tell us what the truth is,” the girl’s father told The New Minute.\n\nThe family had recently moved the Telangana High Court, seeking a ban on the film’s release. They told the court that it was highly improper to release the movie when a judicial commission by the Supreme Court was still inquiring into the case. The High Court then passed an order asking the Central government counsel to expeditiously resolve the representation, if any, made by the petitioner.\n\nResponding to the case filed by the family, Varma tweeted on October 10 that the film’s story was “fictional” and based upon “many cases”.\n\nThe trailer of Disha Encounter released on September 25.

In response, Santhosh tweeted a photograph from the sets of Bharathiraja’s Tik Tik Tik (1991). The photo features actor Kamal Haasan surrounded by bikini-clad women.\n\nTweeting the photo, Santhosh wrote on October 8: “With all due respect to him. Tik Tik Tik movie in 1981 la idha paathu koosadha kannu, ippo koosirucho…? (your eyes didn’t shy away from this image but they are being bothered now?).” The tweet was later taken down.\n\nSanthosh tweeted a statement later on Sunday stating that his response was made in the heat of the moment. “I did it in a hurry without realising what I was doing. It was only after that I felt in my heart that I should not have done it. I now regret what I tweeted.”\n\nPraising the veteran filmmaker, Santhosh wrote: “Bharathiraja is one of the oldest filmmakers in Tamil Cinema Industry. Many are working now in the hope of at least doing one per cent of the accomplishments he has achieved. Bharathiraja has been and is still a role model for many filmmakers.”\n\nHe promised Bharathiraja that he would ensure that future promotions of Irandam Kuththu would be made family-friendly.\n\nBharathiraja had earlier condemned the film for its offensive content in a letter. “We should not permit films that spoil culture. Aren’t there enough rapes, child rapes that we have witnessed? People should realise these kinds of films only do bad to society,” he wrote.\n\nIn an interview with Galatta on October 9, Santhosh had responded to Bharathiraja’s condemnation and said that it was wrong to connect rape cases with cinema. “A maker of a high-end bike brand is not going to stop manufacturing those vehicles just because a person may steal or kill to buy it. Likewise, it is wrong to connect adult comedy films with rapes and vulgarity. Instead of blaming an evil on something, we must learn how to live without committing the evil. Just like how we are taught not to steal and kill, our education system must also teach us not to rape,” he said.\n\nFollowing Bharathiraja’s condemnation, Panangattu Padai Katch’s leader A Hari Nadar filed a police complaint on October 9 against the makers of Irandam Kuththu, requesting action be taken against them.\n\nPopular bike racer Alisha Abdullah had requested a ban on the film.\n\nIrandam Kuththu is the sequel to 2018 film Iruttu Arayil Murattu Kuthu directed by Santhosh P Jayakumar.

Glad to be working with @SitharaEnts again,” she wrote.\n\nNarudi Brathuku Natana, touted to be a crime comedy, is being directed by Vimal Krishna and bankrolled by Naga Vamsi under the Sithara Entertainment production banner.\n\nSiddhu and Shraddha have previously worked in Krishna and His Leela, directed by Ravikanth Perepu.

With the reopening of cinema halls around the corner, these talks now seem imminent.\n\nRecently, the Telugu film industry decided on a mandatory 20% reduction in remunerations for all artists and technicians. Exception from this pay cut had been made for artists who charge Rs 20,000 per day, a statement from the Movie Artistes Association and the Active Telugu Film Producers’ Guild said. Confirming that there was some resistance from actors, some members of the Kerala Film Producers Association recently told The Times of India that 75% of the industry’s stars have finally agreed to take a pay cut.\n\nIn the Hindi film industry, Shahid Kapoor has reportedly volunteered to slash his fees by a massive Rs 8 crore and has settled for Rs 25 crore as his remuneration for his upcoming Hindi remake of Jersey.\n\nPay cuts, however, is still a thorny subject, say pan-industry producers.\n\n“We can’t enforce it, all we can do is request. We need to pay everyone according to the agreements. In the case of my film, talks are still on regarding the pay cut but no one has agreed yet because the pandemic has affected one and all,” said film producer G Dhananjayan, who has produced films such as Kaatrin Mozhi, Kanden Kadhalai and is awaiting the release of Kabadadaari.\n\nThe film producer said that he has suffered losses worth nearly Rs 1 crore due to delay in filming caused by the lockdown. Speaking about whether pay cuts would help, he said: “If the pay cut is agreed upon, the loss could be made up a bit and it will be a partially good release for me. I am hoping that it happens.”\n\nSR Prabhu of Dream Warrior Pictures, who is bankrolling Karthi’s Sulthan, says it is a delicate issue but the industry has to find a middle ground. “It is a suggestion that nobody can mandate. In the past, several technicians and artists have come forward during normal times and reduced their remuneration. Maybe as advice, it can come from an association and we are working on that. Other industries have already announced the same because they have an active association there. Here, there are some issues in the actor’s association and the producer’s council also is undergoing changes,” he said.\n\nSpeaking to Silverscreen India; Mukesh R Mehta, of E4 Entertainment and Varmaa producer, said: “This may help people who are out of work. Some artists will agree to taking a pay cut depending on their relationship with the producer. One thing is for sure that the cost of shoots will go up to implement Covid-19 guidelines. So how does one recover the money? Any association can only set down rules but what’s the guarantee that if the 20% pay cut is successful, an actor will still get the same number of projects or that shoots will start?”\n\nRequesting anonymity, a producer whose film is almost complete, told Silverscreen India that the decision needs to be taken by the industry or the people concerned should meet and solve the issue in private.\n\nOthers confirmed that actors and technicians were being asked to accept a pay cut but they haven’t been able to make a final decision.\n\nThe picture, however, is not that grim.\n\nVijay Antony had announced a 25% pay cut for three of his upcoming films- Tamizharasan, Agni Siragugal, and Khaki. Actors and directors like Harish Kalyan, Mahat, Hari, and R Ajay Gnanamuthu, had also put out statements saying they were either taking pay cuts or ready to take the same. Fahadh Faasil and Mahesh Narayanan, who recently delivered the hit Malayalam film C U Soon, donated Rs 10 lakh from the profit generated by the project to the Film Employees Federation of Kerala. B Unnikrishnan, general secretary of FEFKA, took to social media and thanked the two for this gesture.\n\nSumanth Kumar Happy With First Cut of Kapatadhaari, Says Producer\n\nThe first cut of Kapatadhaari was screened for actor Sumanth Kumar who have given a positive feedback, producer G Dhananjayan announced on social media\n\nTalking to Silverscreen India, Dhananjayan said: “We are ready with the Telugu film Kapatadhaari and it was screened for Sumanth and his team at Hyderabad. We wanted his opinion and he said he is happy with the outcome especially with the screenplay and the background music. We made the film with a lot of passion and are now looking forward to completing all the business activity.”\n\nWhen asked about the tentative release date of the film, he said that the team was looking for a Diwali release. The poster of the film was released by Naga Chaitanya, portraying Sumanth as a traffic cop.\n\nThe film features an ensemble cast of Nasser, Nandita Swetha, Jayaprakash, Vennela Kishore, Suman Ranganath, and Sampath. It is produced by G Dhananjayan under Creative Entertainers and Distributors and the music is composed by Simon K King. Rasamathi has handled the cinematography.\n\nThe film is simultaneously being released in Tamil, and will have Sibiraj reprising the lead role. Helmed by Pradeep Krishnamoorthy, the film has Nandita Swetha playing the female lead. Suman Ranganathan, Nasser, and Jayaprakash will play key roles in the Tamil version too. The films are remakes of hit Kannada film Kaavaludaari, with Anant Nag playing the lead role.\n\nProducer Dhananjayan has reiterated that the team will release both the films after the first or second week of re-opening of theatres. He had previously talked about losing almost Rs 1 crore due to the lockdown and halt in shooting. Both the films have wrapped up their shooting and are in the last stages of few formalities.\n\nApart from Kapatadhaari, Sumanth will reportedly reprise the lead role in the Telugu remake of Malayalam film Padayottam. An official confirmation on the same is awaited.\n\nActors Nimisha Sajayan, Srinda Ashab, Saniya Iyappan Join #RefuseTheAbuse\n\nActors Nimisha Sajayan, Srinda Ashab and Saniya Iyappan have joined the new anti-cyber abuse campaign #RefuseTheAbuse, spearheaded by Women in Cinema Collective (WCC).\n\nThe campaign aims to make cyber spaces safe and free of abuse and harassments. Many Malayalam actors have come forward and joined the campaign.\n\nIn a video posted by WCC and actor Geetu Mohandas, one of the founding members of WCC, Nimisha called out those who write hate comments on other’s posts. “Your pleasure or time pass may be causing a lot of mental distress to the person at the other end. It’s possible they have the same problems in life as you,” she said.\n\nSaniya pointed out that most of the hateful comments she receives is about her choice of clothes. She asked, “Isn’t it my choice to wear what I want?”\n\n“My way of doing things, my preferences-these are my own. I have not appointed anyone to make judgements on this,” Srinda said.\n\nThe #RefuseTheAbuse campaign was inaugurated with a video of actor Anna Ben, in which she shared her experience of cyber-bullying. She spoke about how she had faced trolls but later discovered that the majority of hate comments came from fake accounts. “What we need to remember is that these activities reflect on their insecurities and fears and character and not on us or the victim,” she said.\n\n“WCC seeks to highlight the cultural aspect of cyber abuse as it has a long-standing impact on society. Through the campaign WCC seeks to urge all stakeholders of the film industry and society at large to find solutions to this growing menace and exhorts every individual to refuse allowing the abuse to happen. WCC believes it is time to speak up and are gathering voices who want to say their piece,” WCC had said in a statement on October 6.\n\nWCC was conceived after the arrest of actor Dileep in 2017 for allegedly conspiring the abduction and assault of a popular Malayalam actor. Within weeks after the assault, women artists from Malayalam film industry, including Rima Kallingal, Parvathy Thiruvothu, Geetu Mohandas, Padmapriya Janakiraman, Revathi, director Anjali Menon, editor Beena Paul and many others came in support of the survivor and formed the collective.\n\nIrandam Kuththu: Police Complaint Filed Against Film Makers\n\nA police complaint has been filed against the makers of Irandam Kuththu after veteran director Bharathiraja condemned the upcoming adult horror-comedy film.\n\nPanangattu Padai Katchi leader A Hari Nadar issued a statement against the movie and filed an online complaint against the filmmakers with the Tamil Nadu police on Friday.\n\nTaking to his social media account, Nadar posted a strongly-worded statement, in which he said that the dialogues in Irandam Kuthu were laden with double meaning, including, the film’s title.\n\nHe accused the filmmakers and actors for having created the film just for money without taking into account about ruining the minds of youngsters and Tamil culture. “I request for the soon-to-be-released Irandam Kuththu to be immediately banned. I also request the police to take legal action and arrest the movie’s director Santhosh P Jayakumar as well as the actors and others involved with the film,” Nadar wrote.\n\nNadar referenced the Central Board of Film Certification which has clearly mentioned the rules and regulations on how a film should be made. He pointed out that Irandam Kuththu has violated these rules.\n\nEarlier, Bharathiraja too had slammed the filmmakers and had said that cinema has been used to achieve huge feats including, breaking religious and caste barriers and empower women. He clarified that while cinema can talk about different cultures and ways of life, it cannot be a place for explicit content. “We should not permit films that spoil culture. Aren’t there enough rapes, child rapes that we have witnessed? People should realise these kinds of films only do bad to society,” he wrote.\n\nIrandam Kuththu is the sequel to the 2018 film Iruttu Arayil Murattu Kuthu by Santhosh P Jayakumar. The sequel stars Santosh P Jayakumar, Daniel Annie Pope, Karishma Kaul, Akriti Singh and Motta Rajendran.\n\nRana Daggubati’s Hiranyakashyap’s Shooting Stalled\n\nActor Rana Daggubati‘s upcoming film Hiranykashyap‘s shooting has been stalled, announced its director Gunasekhar on Twitter on Thursday.\n\n“Amidst this global pandemic, despite ‘Hiranyakshyap‘ pre-production work completed, the massive scale shoot will take off later than anticipated and in the meantime I’ve embarked on another film,” he wrote.\n\nGunasekhar then went on to release the poster of his next film Shaakuntalam, a mythical love story. The poster showcased the illustration of a woman sitting on a rock by the water. He said,”Presenting to you a whimsical ‘Tale of Love’ from the Adi Parva of the Mahabharata..”\n\nHiranyakashyap was announced nearly three years ago and was bankrolled by Rana’s father Suresh Babu.\n\nThe actor, in an interview with Mid-Day last year, had said that the film would begin shoot mid-2020. He had also given some insight into the film’s shooting and the pre-production work.\n\nRana mentioned that they were building virtual reality sets and visuals were being made like those seen in video games. The film’s crew had collaborated with a 3D scanning company,whose specialty is medical technology. He said that this was probably the first time it was happening in India. Rana had also added that the film would go on floors in eight months.\n\nThe lockdown caused due to the Covid-19 pandemic, which had brought the industry to a standstill, has also stalled the shoot of the film.\n\nThe Baahubali actor is awaiting the release of his upcoming film Virata Parvam, co-starring Nandita Das, Priyamani and Sai Pallavi.\n\nVirata Parvam would mark Das’s return to the Telugu film industry.
