She worked with the latter on her debut film, Dil Se.., which was released in 1998.

Preity shared that she had fallen sick after dancing in the rain, and the cinematographer made sure to make her eat the right food. Recalling the incident, Preity added:\n\n“While we were shooting in Kerala, the song had a little light rain. You don't really see the rain, but it was there. So in the four days there, my bones were hurting in the rain, I had a fever, and I wasn't feeling well. Santosh came and got me rasam and all the food, and said, ‘Why don’t you eat this? It's hot.' He was really sweet and took care of me.”\n\nDon’t Miss: Aishwarya Rai Hosts A Midnight B'Day Celebration For Her Mom, Brinda Rai, Abhishek Bachchan Skips It\n\nadvertisement\n\nPreity Zinta’s previous Cannes appearances\n\nPreity made her Cannes debut in 2006 when she attended the premieres of the films, The Wind That Shakes The Barley and Paris, Je T'aime.
