If this article appears in other sites without the knowledge and consent of the web administrator of atulsongaday.me, then it is piracy of the copyright content of atulsongaday.me and is a punishable offence under the existing laws.\n\nBlog Day :\n\n5817 Post No. : 18353\n\nToday’s song is from the film Bhakta Kabir-1942.\n\nFor the last two months’ period, I was very busy. First it was my ill health during which I spent a few days in Hospital also. After that I started doing my routine work. Then there was one company’s Board meeting which, being one of the Directors, I had to prepare and attend. After that I resumed my writing work and then some visitors came last week. Ms. Nupur Mitra, daughter of the legendary singer Jagmohan Sursagar came with her team-as per our plan- in connection with her forthcoming book on Jagmohan.\n\nPrior to that, she had requested for some information and cross checking about his songs. That work had kept me busy for 7-8 days. Working with authors for their books is not new to me. Earlier I had the experience with Dr. Surjit singh ji, Biren kothari ji,Yasir Abbasi ji, Ranjan Sain and other half a dozen authors. Then there was Sheo Khetan ji for whom I had been busy for the last about two years, while he published 7 books. In between Shishir Krishna Sharma ji needs me for his work on YouTube Videos on old time artistes. Dr.Anup Phadke often needs information for his Blog. In addition to all this I am quite active on social media like Whatsapp and FaceBook. Replying to HFM queries on Emails eats away a lot of time, as it requires collecting data from different sources. Further, living alone takes up a lot of time in household management.\n\nAll in all, I have kept many of my personal work items pending for want of time. I thank God that at the age of 84 years, he keeps me busier than most retired persons I know ! This keeps me updated on the knowledge front too, as I have to refer to several books etc and make notes. In a way, staying all alone proves to be a boon for me because atleast I am not disturbing anyone’s routines due to my busy schedule.\n\nThe latest work programme for Jagmohan’s songs actually reminded me of several songs by him in Hindi films, on which I can (and I will) write posts on the Blog. In this process I found some new songs which I did not know about. It was a bonus for my work. It also helped me revise and refresh my own information.\n\nLast month end my third book came out. However I am only a co-author of that book on Sheo ji’s insistence, as I had provided him a lot of information for these books.Next month end my 4th book will be published, again co-authored with Sheo ji. But this time my direct contribution is fifty-fifty.\n\nToday’s song of Jagmohan is a rare coincidence. There were only two musicians from Bengal who were honoured with the title of ” Sur Sagar”. One was ofcourse Jagmohan. The other was, the Music Director of today’s film Himangshu Dutt. His name is not very well known among Hindi film lovers. He has done only 2 films in Hindi, but in Bengal his name was very famous and respected.\n\nHimangshu Dutta ( 1908 – 15 November 1944) was a Bengali music director. Amongst several contemporary legendary composers of his time as Rabindranath Tagore, Kazi Nazrul Islam, and Atulprasad Sen, Dutta is renowned for his unique and melodious composition of music. Songs composed by him are usually known as “Himangshu Dutta-er Gaan” (songs of Himangshu Dutta). The Saraswat Samaj of Dhaka awarded him the title ‘Surasagar’ (Sea of Music) for his contribution to Bengali music. He himself was an accomplished singer as well.\n\nHimangshu Dutta was born in Comilla (now in Bangladesh) in 1908, to Jogendrachandra Dutta and Nirada Devi. He was the fifth child of the couple. After receiving primary and secondary education at Comilla and passing the entrance examination from Comilla Zilla School in 1924, he came to Kolkata and joined Presidency College to get the ISC degree. He received his bachelor degree from Vidyasagar College under Calcutta University.\n\nJogendra Chandra was very fond of music and many eminent musicians of Comilla used to visit his house in a regular manner. This not only helped child Himangshu to listen to quality classical music at his very young age but also to get closer to various forms of music like Dhrupad, Khayal, Ghazal, Lokogiti, and other various local music forms of Comilla.\n\nHimangshu Dutta’s mother was also a noted singer of that time and she used to sing Rabindrasangeet to her sons and daughters. Himangshu Dutta received the first lessons of music from his mother.\n\nHimangshu Dutta learned Dhrupad from Acharya Shyamacharan Dutta and Bhajan from Ustad Khasru Miya, and Pandit Khitimohan Sensashtri. He also received training on classical music from his elder brother Shachindra Dutta.\n\nBefore reaching his teenage years, Himangshu Dutta started singing Brahma Sangeet and Bhajan in different local functions at Comilla.\n\nIn 1922 Himangshu Dutta composed music for a song whose lyric was written by his classmate Subodh Purkayastha. Himangshu sang the song at a function of his school. The duo, Himangshu and Subodh, later gave the Bengali audience a vast number of super-hit songs.\n\nIn 1923 Rabindranath Tagore visited Comilla and the young boy sang Rabindrasangeet in a public function in front of Rabindranath Tagore. Rabindranath appreciated it very much.\n\nBeside having a deep interest in music composition, Himangshu Dutta was an avid notation writer from a very young age. He wrote notations for various musicians including Atulprasad Sen and Rabindranath Tagore. Maestros like Pankaj Kumar Mullick also mentioned this in his writing.\n\nIn 1928, Himangshu met singer Dr. Sudhamadhab Dutta. Next year, Dr. Dutta sang two songs composed by Himangshu at All India Radio, Kolkata. This is possibly the first occurrence at which a Bengali audience got the taste of Himangshu Dutta over the radio. From this point onwards, Sudhamadhab continued singing “Himangshu Dutta-er Gaan”, broadcast by All India Radio every Sunday.\n\nIn the year 1931 Gramophone Company of India released the first record based on the composition of Himangshu Dutta. The artist was Haripada Roy. In the same year, the company also published another record from its HMV division where Sati Devi (Ashok Kumar’s sister) was the singer, and Himangshu emerged as a star in the history of so-called modern Bengali songs.\n\nHimangshu started using both Indian classical music and western harmony to bring a complete new type of music in the history of Bengali music composition. Beside composing music for basic Bengali, Ghazal, and Ragapradhan, he also composed music for a number of Bengali as well as Hindi film songs. In 1934, he entered the world of film industry through the film “Taruni”. In the next ten years he worked as a composer in many Bengali as well as Hindi films.\n\nHis compositions for songs like “”Boroshar Megh Name”, “Bidayer Sesh Bani”, “Birohini Chiro Birohini”, “Jodi Dokhina Pobon Ashiya”, “Rater Deule Jage”, and many others will remain as favourites to the audience of Bengali songs forever. As per HFGK, he gave music to only 2 Hindi films. Bhakta Kabir-1942 and Bhaichara-1943, composing 26 songs.\n\nHimangshu Dutta died on 15 November 1944 at the age of 36.\n\nIndia is a Multi racial, multilingual and Multi religions country. It is not only one of the largest Democracies in the world, but also the largest Secular state in the world, where people from different faiths have been living together since centuries.\n\nMany saints and religious leaders have played a significant role in keeping the mixed population of India as One Unit, when it was needed the most. A majority of Hindus, ruled by a minority Muslim Mughals was a natural cause for social divisions, but Saints like Kabir, Surdas, Tulsidas, Ramdas, Tukaram, Ramanand, Narsi Mehta, Purandar das,namdev, Guru Nanak Dev, Eknath, Bhakta Pundarikar, Rohidas, Mrutyunjaya and many such noble souls, did an excellent job of maintaining harmony amongst peoples of different faiths.\n\nKabir was born near Kashi (Varanasi) to a Bramhin widow, who deserted him, for fear of social boycott. He was found and brought up by a Muslim weaver couple-Niru and Naima. Vaishnava Saint Ramanand accepted him as his disciple. Unlike some other saints, Kabir did not become a Sadhu or a Fakir, but he married and led a normal life earning from his Loom works. He had 1 son and 1 daughter also.\n\nKabir campaigned against social discrimination and economic exploitation. He vehemently opposed dogmas in Hinduism and islam. His language was straight from the heart, using common vernacular words, which appealed to the masses. He was against Murti-puja and believed in Bhakti and Sufi ideas. He was an illiterate person. His poems and Dohas were heard ,noted and written by his followers. His works are included in the Guru Granth Sahib of the Sikhs also. His dohas were in Awadhi, Brij and Bhojpuri languages. Through his philosophies, he spread the message of unity during his times. For him Ram and Rahim were the same.\n\nWhile the authentic period of kabir is 1440 to 1518, there are popular legends about him living for 120 years and after death, his body turning into Flowers.\n\nMore than anything else Kabir is remembered for the courage of his convictions. He was a religious reformer who slashed down the orthodox bigotism of Hindus and Muslims alike. He denounced with a touch of satire, the whole apparatus of piety of the temple and the mosque, the idol and the holy water scriptures and the priests, labelling them as cults that vainly tried to replace Reality with Ritual. And thus it was that while courting bitterness from the accepted monopolists of Faith, he tried to eliminate the bitterness that then existed between Hindu and Muslims of that day. The life story of Kabir is surrounded by numerous contradictory legends, on which reliance cannot be placed. It is therefore not to be expected that any one version of his life could satisfy all such sections of people who claim to know anything about him.\n\nFilm Bhakt Kabir-1942 was made by Unity productions, Calcutta. It was directed by Rameshwar Sharma. The songs were by Pt.Shiv kumar Sharma. There were 4 songs based on Kabir’s work. Incidentally, this was the First film of Bharat Bhushan as a lead actor. Earlier he had acted in Chitralekha-1941. Of course the film Bhakta Kabir did not give any name or fame to Bharat Bhushan and he had to wait for another 10 years till the film Baiju Bawra-1952 made him very famous. The others in the cast were, Mehtab, Mazhar Khan, Padma Devi N A Ansari and few othe Bangla artistes.\n\nLet us now listen to the Raam Bhajan sung by one Sursagar (Jagmohan), under the baton of another Sursagar(Himangshu Dutt) ! Enjoy this 82 year old bhajan….\n\nSong- Raam naam mukh bol (Bhakt Kabir)(1942) Singer- Jagmohan Sursagar aka Jaganmoy Mitra, Lyricist- Pt.

One was made and released in 1955 and the other was made in 1994 (released in 1998). There was also the movie The Light : Swami Vivekanand in 2013. It was made in Hindi, Bangla, Tamil and English. There were movies in Telugu and of course in Bangla also. Today’s film was made by Amar Mullick Production. It was produced by actress Bharati Devi (Amar Mullick’s wife) and Phani Mullick (Amar’s brother). The film was directed by Amar Mullick himself. The film was made simultaneously in Bangla and Hindi. All artistes were from Bengal. The Music Director was Rai Chand Boral.\n\nThis film was made in Hindi and Bengali at the same time and for Hindi version the Dialogues were by Pandit Bhushan. The entire film was in pure Hindi and partly this was a minus point for the film. Even in Bengali,people complained that,very old and pure Bengali language was used.\n\nI had seen this movie,as I was and am an admirer of this great soul.\n\nThe main role of Swami Vivekanand was done by Ajit Prakash and his mother’s role was done by Bharati Devi. She had played a major role in Narendra’s life before he became Vivekanand. Ramkrishna Paramhans’s role was played by Manoranjan Bhattacharya.\n\nIn the film, major events of Vivekanand’s life were covered like, his early years,meeting with Ramkrishna,his turn around to Bhakti marg,going to America with help from Maharaja of Khetri,his famous speech at the Parliament of Religions,Chicago in 1893,visit to London,Bhagini Nivedita’s induction,few speeches and his Maha Nirvan on 4-7-1902.\n\nThere were 2 lyricists,Shankar Sen and Tandon Jodhpuri. I feel it was not a movie for entertainment but for bringing Vivekanand’s life to common people to inspire them.\n\nRight from childhood I have been a devotee of Shiv ji. Maybe because of my father and our stay in Kashi for 2 years – very close to Vishveshwar Mandir. In later years, a big Shiv Temple was constructed, by our family, within the huge compound next to our Bungalow, in Hyderabad. Due to all these sanskars, I got interested in religion and started reading books about Hindu Dharma.\n\nOver the years, after knowing deeply about other major religions like Christianity, Islam, Buddhism, Jainism etc, I realised that Hindu Religion is unique. One may wonder what is so unique ? The simple answer is the elasticity of the Hindu religion. In other religions there is one God, one Holy book and strict rules of adherence. Hindu religion has the freedom to everyone about how to worship or be religious. There is no hard and fast rule or compulsion about any adherence to the methods or systems.\n\nOne has the freedom to choose his own form of God – Vishnu, Bramha or Shiva or any other God or Goddess like Laxmi, Parvati or Sarswati. There are hundreds of different forms of these Gods to suit all places and communities.In addition, almost every family has its own “Kul Devta” to worship. There are 10 Avatars of Vishnu, 12 Jyotirlingas of Shiva and every major place in India has its own temple of an exclusive form of God to worship. Gods are different for every caste and community and every Hindu bows to the variety of Gods wherever he goes and finds one.\n\nIt is said that there are 33 Koti Gods. This 33 Koti can mean Crores or Types. As per Shiv Puran, there are 33 types of Gods as follows….\n\n12 Adityas (Anshuman, Aryaman,Indra, Twashta, Dhatu, Parjanya, Pusha, Bhag, Mitra, Varuna, Vivasna and Vishnu)\n\n8 Vasus (Aap, Dhruva, Soma, Dhar, Anil, Anal, Pratyusha and Prabhasa)\n\n11 Rudras ( Shambhu, Pinaki, Girish, Sthanu, Bhargav, Bhav, Sadashiv, Shiva, Hara, Sharva and kapali)\n\n1 Indradev and\n\n1 Prajapati or Bramhadev.\n\nNow tell me which religion in this world gives so much liberty to choose one’s own form of God ? And the most important factor is that the Supreme Head of the Universe is One for all and all these are different forms of Him. There are 18 Puranas, 4 Vedas, Ramayan, Mahabharat and Geeta which describe the stories and knowledge from Mythology and also teach how to do Bhakti, in simple language. There is no compulsion of any Karmakand or a type of Bhakti one can do. There are 9 types of / ways of doing Bhakti, called Nava Vidha Bhakti….\n\n1.Shravan – like Raja Parikshit\n\n2. Keertan – Like Tyagraja\n\n3. Smaran – like Bhakta Prahlad\n\n4. Paad seva – Like Laxmi\n\n5. Archana – also called Pooja\n\n6. Vandana – Sashtang Namaskar\n\n7. Daasya – like Hanuman\n\n8. Sakhya – like Arjun and\n\n9. Atma Nivedan – like Meerabai\n\nOne can choose the method convenient to him. Saints and Godmen in various periods kept on reviving the sagging religion with their Bhajans and deeds. In fact during the foreign invasions on Bharat, it was the saints in the Bhakti-Movement, who kept the religion alive. One such great soul was Swami Vivekanand, who crossed “the seven seas” to propagate Hindu dharma and awaken the sleeping people of India.\n\nAll this has made the Hindus highly tolerant and respectful of all Religions. Lord Shrikrishna said in Geeta ” All religions are different roads to reach me (The Supreme God) “. This is how, for the last hundreds of years, India has survived with so many religions, different cultures and languages, castes and sub castes. Major religions like Hindu, Muslim, Sikh, Christianity, Buddha, Jain and smaller religions like Jews, Parsis, Bahais etc have lived peacefully, in general, in Bharat. This is the greatness of Hinduism.\n\nMaha Shivaratri is the festival in which it is believed that Shiv ji and Maa Parvati got married in the Midnight. A complete fast is observed for the whole day and Shiv Bhajans are recited. Here is one such Bhajan from the film Swami Vivekanand-1955. It is sung by Mohd. Rafi in this film. Let us enjoy this….\n\nSong-Hey Shivshambho hey Tripuraaree (Swaami Vivekananda)(1955) Singer- Mohd.

In the aftermath of the partition, he had landed in Hindi film industry mainly for the betterment of his financial conditions apart from creative contributions to the extent possible. But once he knew the realities that the film writers have no much freedom, Rajendra Singh Bedi turned producer-director in Hindi films to fulfil his creative desire.\n\nRajinder Singh Bedi (01/09/1915 – 11/11/1984), one of the greatest Urdu fiction writers, was born in Sialkot (now in Pakistan) to a Khatri Sikh father and a Brahmin Hindu mother. His father was Postmaster in one of the post offices in Lahore. During his childhood, his mother used to tell him stories from Ramayan and Geeta while his father would apprise him of the nuances from Guru Granth Sahib. His father was also an avid reader. All these inputs from his parents created interest in Rajinder Singh Bedi in story writing and readings. He started writing short stories in his teens and got published in local magazines.\n\nRajinder Singh Bedi completed his matriculation from Lahore in Urdu and joined the college. However, when he had completed intermediate, his mother died of T.B. So, Rajinder had to discontinue his college studies. After couple of years, his father also passed away. To take care of the family, he joined the post office as a clerk. Side by side, he worked part time in AIR, Lahore as a script writer and contributed his short stories in Urdu magazine, ‘Adabi Duniya’. One of his radio plays staged on AIR, Lahore was ‘Naql-e-Makaani’ (1944) which he later made a film, ‘Dastak’ (1970).\n\nOn the eve of the partition, Rajinder Singh Bedi migrated to India along with his wife and two children. After spending few days in Shimla and Delhi, he got a job as a director of the newly set up Radio Kashmir’s Jammu station in in the later part of 1947. During that period, Radio Pakistan used to broadcast anti-India propaganda. To counter the propaganda, Rajinder Singh Bedi started a radio programme called ‘Sirf 5 minutes’ in which he broadcasted the rebuttals to the Pakistani propaganda written by him. Due to political changes that had taken place in Jammu & Kashmir, he resigned from his job sometime in 1948.\n\nLeaving his family in Jammu, Rajinder Singh Bedi moved to Bombay (Mumbai) where his contemporaries in Lahore – Upendra Nath Ashq, Krishna Chander, Sahir Ludhianvi etc had already moved to Mumbai for better opportunity. Initially, he stayed with his brother-in-law in Mumbai for few days. A common friend introduced him to D D Kashyap, the producer-director who was aware of his writing capability. He employed him in his production company as a screenplay-dialogue writer at a monthly salary of Rs,1000/- with a flexibility of working outside the banner in spare time. He took a rental house in Seven Bungalows at Versova and brought his family from Jammu.\n\nRajinder Singh Bedi debuted as a dialogue writer in Kashyap Production’s ‘Badi Bahen’ (1949) which became a box office hit. This was followed by ‘Aaram’ (1951), ‘Do Sitaare’ (1951), ‘Naya Ghar’ (1953) etc. He also worked for the other film productions in fims like ‘Daagh’ (1952), ‘Mirza Ghalib’ (1954) ‘Devdas’ (1955), ‘Madhumati’ (1958) etc. He was actively associated with Hrishikesh Mukherjee as a dialogue writer in his films such as ‘Musaafir’ (1957), Anuradha’ (1960), “Mem Didi’ (1961), ‘Anupama’ (1966), ‘Bibi Aur Makaan’ (1966), Satyakaam’ (1969), ‘Abhimaan’ (1973) etc. Most of these films were box office hits. However, Rajinder Singh Bedi did not get much of the financial benefit from the success of his films.\n\nRajinder Singh Bedi also grew as a literary personality. He was associated with Progressive Writers Association (PWA). He wrote 72 short stories, a couple of plays and novellas in the span of about 5 decades of his literary pursuits. In 1965, he was awarded the Sahitya Academy Award for his novella, ‘EK Chadar Maili Si’, Padma Shri in 1972 and the Ghalib Award in 1978.\n\nSometime in the mid-1950s, Rajinder Singh Bedi felt that writing for films was at the cost of compromising the literary values. He decided to produce the film based on one of his published short stories. He formed a film production company named ‘Cine Cooperatives’ in partnership with Hrishikesh Mukherjee, Balraj Sahni, Geeta Bali, Amar Kumar and Homi Sethna and produced his first film, ‘Garam Coat’ (1955) directed by Amar Kumar. The film failed at the box office. However, Rajinder Singh Bedi got the Filmfare Award for the Best Story of the film.\n\nLater, Cine Cooperative produced one more film, ‘Laal Batti’ (1957) which also failed at the box office. His next venture of film was ‘Rangoli’ (1962 which he produced in partnership with his friend, Amar Kumar. This film also failed at the box office. He now turned director with a Punjabi film, ‘Rano’ (1965, shelved) based on his novella, ‘Ek Chaadar Maili Si’. The film was produced by Geeta Bali with herself and Dharmendra in lead roles. However, with the sudden death of Geeta Bali in January 1965, the film was shelved. Thereafter, Rajinder Singh Bedi never attempted to make a film based on this novella during his lifetime.\n\nRajinder Singh Bedi produced and directed ‘Dastak’ (1970) which was based on his radio play, ‘Naql-e-Makaani’ staged on AIR, Lahore in 1944. The film was critically acclaimed. The film won the National Film Awards for the Best Actor (Sanjeev Kumar), the Best Actress (Rehana Sultan), the Best Music Director (Madan Mohan).\n\nFollowing the success of ‘Dastak’ (1970), Rajinder Singh Bedi produced and directed ‘Phaagun’ (1973) and ‘Nawab Sahib’ (1976) which failed at the box office. In the process of film production, Rajinder Singh Bedi had lost a lot of money requiring him to mortgage his house. His last film as a producer-director was ‘Aankhin Dekhi’ (1978) which was supposed to be an off-beat film. Though completed and censor certified, the film remained unreleased because Rajinder Singh Bedi suffered from a paralysis attack, confining him to the bed. He had no one to rely on the spade work to be done for the release of the film. His wife had already passed away.\n\nThis was the beginning of calamities in his life. His son, Narender Bedi, a successful film director with films like ‘Bandhan’ (1969), Jawaani Diwaani’ (1972), ‘Raffoo Chakkar’ (1974), ‘Benaam’ (1974) ‘Sanam Teri Kasam’ (1982) etc, suddenly passed away in October 1982 at the age of 45. After this, Rajinder Singh Bedi lost interest in his life. He never recovered from series of shocks and his illness. He lost eyesight in one eye. At a later stage, he was diagnosed with cancer which became the cause of his death on November 11, 1984.\n\nIn his memory, the Punjab Government has constituted the Rajendra Singh Bedi Award for Urdu Literature.\n\nHis grandsons, Rajat Bedi and Manek Bedi are actors in Hindi films. His granddaughter, Ila Bedi-Dutta debuted as a screenplay writer with ‘Agneepath’ (2011). On the eve of Rajinder Singh Bedi’s birth centenary in 2015, his grandchildren produced TV Serial, ‘Laajwanti’, (2015) based on his short story by the same name. In 2006, Kavita Chaudhary had already made a telefilm, ‘Laajwanti’ (2006) on the same story.\n\n‘Phaagun’ (1973) was Rajinder Singh Bedi’s second Hindi film as a producer-director-writer. The film starred Waheeda Rahman, Jaya Bahaduri, Vijay Arora, Om Prakash, Jagdev, Raj Rani, Narbada Shankar, V Gopal, Suman Sinha etc. Dharmendra made a guest appearance in the role of Waheeda Rahman’s husband.\n\nThe story of the film in nutshell is :-\n\non the holi festival day, Shanta’s (Waheeda Rahman) husband, Gopal (Dharmendra) leaves the house never to return due to some misunderstanding with his wife who is pregnant. A girl, Santosh (Jaya Bhaduri) is born. She grows up, completes her college and marries Dr Suman (Vijay Arora), an orphan who was in her college and has become a doctor. After marriage, both stay with Shanta. But the mother is so much obsessed with her daughter that she interferes in their personal life making difficult for the daughter and the son-in-law. It becomes a psychological case for Shanta when she momentarily starts seeing Gopal in her son-in-law. This troubles her and she starts feeling guilty. Shanta pleads with her daughter and son-in-law to get her reunited with her husband. Dr Suman tells the problems to his boss, Dr Effendi (Om Prakash) who promises him that he would find out the whereabouts of Gopal. In the meanwhile, due to some arguments with her son-in-law on the holi festival day, Shanta leaves her house only to see Dr Effendi accompanied by an aged Gopal walking towards her house in the midst of holi revellers. She and her family get united with her husband.\n\nThe film had six songs. Four songs written by Majrooh Sultanpuri and one traditional thumri have been covered in the Blog. All the songs were set to music by S D Burman. I am presenting the sixth and the last song, a Meera bhajan, ‘mero to Girdhar gopal dusro na koi’ rendered by Usha Mangeshkar. The song is picturised on Waheeda Rahman. Jaya Bhaduri and Vijay Arora join her in prayer.\n\nThe background to the song is that Waheeda Rahman sees her daughter and son-in-law in each other’s arms. Momentarily, she imagines herself in place of her daughter, Jaya Bhaduri in the arms of her son-in-law. Feeling guilty and as a penance for her sinful imagination, she goes to the pooja room and begins praying with Meerabai’s bhajan.\n\nNote: For writing the profile of Rajinder Singh Bedi, I have mainly relied on the article on Rajinder Singh Bedi by his granddaughter, Nischint Bhatnagar on the eve of his birth centenary, and the Audio lectures on him by one of his close friends, Padma Sachdev at Sahitya Akademy, New Delhi.

It is one of the most popular and common pooja that is performed in all over India, except 2-3 states. Satyanarayan is NOT an Avatar of Lord Shri Vishnu. It is just another form of Vishnu.\n\nLord Shrikrishna has clarified what is an Avatar in the IV chapter, in the Bhagwatgeeta, stanzas 7 and 8 like this….\n\n“Yada Yada Hi Dharmasya\n\nGlanirva Bhavathi Bharatha,\n\nAbhyuthanam Adharmaysya\n\nTadatmanam Srijami Aham’.\n\nBhagavad Gita (Chapter IV-7)\n\nPraritranaya Sadhunam\n\nVinashaya Cha Dushkritam\n\nDharamasansthapnaya\n\nSambhavami Yuge-Yuge.”\n\nBhagavat Gita (Chapter IV-8). Its translation would be thus….\n\n“Whenever there is decay\n\nof righteousness O! Bharatha\n\nAnd a rise of unrighteousness\n\nthen I manifest Myself!”\n\n“For the protection of the good,\n\nFor the destruc­tion of the wicked and\n\nfor the establishment of righteousness,\n\nI am born in every age.”\n\nIn the film Prabhu ki Maya-1955, Hemant kumar has sung a Bhajan in which this is expressed poetically in Hindi thus…\n\nJab jab hota nash Dharm ka,\n\naur paap badh jaata hai,\n\ntab lete Avatar Prabhu\n\nyeh Vishva shanti paata hai.\n\nIn case of Satyanarayan, its Pooja procedure is explained in Skand Puran, Reva kand, by Sut Puranik to Shaunak Muni and other Rishis in Nimishkaranya, when they set out to do a 1000 year Yadnya for the benefit of Humanity.\n\nFilm Pahapooja-1954 was directed by Shanti Kumar. The film had 3 MDs – Avinash Vyas (4 songs), Shankar rao Vyas (3 songs) and Manna Dey (2 songs). For these 9 songs as many as 7 singers were used – Rafi, Amirbai, Talat mahmood, Geeta Dutt, Manna Dey, Pinakin Shah and Tara. The cast of the film consisted of Ratnamala, Amirbai,Shashi kapoor (sr.), Anant Marathe, Sabita Chatterjee, Ahavale and many others, includin 2 Guest artistes- Prem Adib and Murad.\n\nThe entire film was based on the most popular Satyanarayan Katha. The story is…\n\nThis story consists of a childless merchant and his adventures. There was a wise king named Ulkamuk. He had a pious and beautiful wife. He would go to the temple daily and would give charity to the Brahmins. One day near the banks of river Madhushala, where they were performing Lord Sri Satyanarayana’s vratham, a wealthy merchant was passing by. He anchored his boat, went to the king and asked him, “Oh King, please let me know the details about the vratham you are performing with such devotion”. The king replied that he was performing Lord Satyanarayana Swami’s vratham. He said that one who performs this vratham will gain worldly pleasures and attain salvation. The merchant with much eagerness asked him the details stating that, “Oh King, I would like to know the details as I am childless and would like to perform this vratham”. The king gladly gave the entire details about the vratham and its vidhanam.\n\nAfter acquiring the entire details of the vratham, the merchant and his wife decided to perform the fast if they get a child. Sometime later his wife Lilavati became pregnant and she delivered a girl who they named Kalavati. The merchant’s wife Lilavati reminded him about his promise to keep the fast and perform the vratham. The merchant postponed it saying that he would do so when the daughter grows and is ready to be married. The merchant told his wife that during the time of Kalawati’s wedding it would be easy to do the fast because at the moment he was busy in his business. So saying he left for his business trip to various villages.\n\nKalawati grew up to be a beautiful girl. When the merchant saw his daughter was of marriageable age; he called the match-maker and requested him to search for an ideal match for his daughter. Hearing the merchant’s request, the match-maker reached Kanchan Nagar. From there, he brought the proposal of a young handsome boy. Agreeing to the proposal and after speaking to the boy’s parents, Kalavati’s marriage was performed with much fanfare and religious ceremonies & rituals. All this while and even at this time of his daughter’s wedding the merchant forgot about the promise to perform the Satyanarayana vratham. So the Lord decided to remind the merchant about his promise.\n\nThe merchant, after a few days, left for his business trip with his son-in-law by boat. They anchored their boat in a beautiful village, named Ratanpur ruled by King Chandraketu. One day, the thieves robbed the wealth of the king. After robbing they went and stayed at the same place where the merchant was staying. Seeing the guards following them, they left the entire loot near the merchant and then hid themselves. When the guards reached the merchant’s place, they saw all the king’s wealth beside the merchant and his son-in-law. Thinking them to be robbers, they arrested them and brought them before the king stating that they were responsible for the theft. The king, without giving any chance of explaining their case ordered both be confined to behind bars. Even their wealth was confiscated by the king.\n\nWhile at the merchant’s house, the thieves robbed their entire wealth. This left his wife and daughter to beg for their daily bread. One day while begging for food, Kalawati reached a Brahmin’s house. At that time the Brahmin and his family were performing Lord Satyanarayana’s puja. After listening to the prayer and taking the prasadam, she left for home. By the time she reached home it was already dark.\n\nLeelawati was worried. She asked her daughter Kalawati why it took her so much time to come home. Kalawati replied, “Oh Mother, today I was at a Brahmin’s house where they were performing Lord Satyanarayana’s vratham.” On hearing this, Leelawati recollected the long pending promise by her husband and narrated it to her daughter. She soon began the preparations for the Lord Satyanarayana vratham. She did the fast & prayed and asked the Lord for forgiveness. She prayed that her husband and her son-in-law return home safely.\n\nLord Satyanarayana was pleased with the prayer and the fast. One day, he told King Chandraketu in his dream, “Oh King, You must release the merchant and his son-in-law as they are not the robbers. Return their wealth and set them free. If you do not do so, your kingdom will be destroyed.” In the morning, the king called the people in his court and told them about the dream.\n\nThe people agreed that the merchant and his son-in-law should be released by the king. The king asked the guards to bring the prisoners, returned all their belongings and set them free. The king told them that due to their wrongdoings, they had to undergo this suffering, but now there was nothing to fear & they could go back home. They bowed down to the king & left for home.\n\nThe merchant prayed first and then gave some wealth to the Brahmins before starting his journey home. When they went a little further, Lord Satyanarayana wanted to test them. He disguised as an old man and went up to the merchant. The Lord asked, “What is in your boat, give me little from there.” The merchant, in arrogance and pride, replied, “Oh Old man, we have nothing in our boat except hay and leaves.” On hearing such harsh words from the merchant, the Lord said, “Your words shall be true”. So saying, he went from there and sat on the bank of the river.\n\nWhen the Lord went away, the boat started to rise higher in the water. The merchant was surprised at this. He went to check inside the boat. To his shock he saw that his boat which was filled with his wealth now contains only leaves and hay. Seeing this he fainted. When he came to his senses, he said “How could this happen?” His son-in-law meanwhile told him, “Do not cry over this. All has happened because you spoke harshly to the old man and lied to him. Still, nothing is lost. You could go back to him and ask him for his forgiveness. He may set everything right.”\n\nThe merchant, after hearing the words of his son-in-law, went in search of the old man. He bowed down before him and with respect said, “Oh Lord, please forgive me for the words I have spoken.” So saying, he bowed down with tears of sorrow in his eyes. When the Lord saw the merchant in his state of sorrow and crying for forgiveness, he said, “Oh foolish person, due to your deeds, you have seen all this sorrow & suffering.”\n\nOn hearing the merchant’s words filled with bhakti, the Lord was happy & he turned the boat full of wealth. When the merchant mounted his boat and saw it full with wealth again, he thanked the Lord & said, “With Lord Satyanarayana’s grace, my wish is fulfilled. When I reach home, I will do his prayer & fast”, so saying he left for his home.\n\nWhen the merchant saw that his home-town Ratanpur is nearing, he sent a messenger in advance, to his house to inform his wife & daughter of his arrival. The messenger, on reaching the merchant’s house, bowed down to the merchant’s wife & gave them the most awaited news that the merchant & his son-in-law have reached Ratanpur.\n\nLeelawati had just finished doing her Satyanarayana Puja meanwhile. She told her daughter to finish doing the prayer and then come & receive her husband & her father. Kalawati finished doing her puja quickly & without taking the prasadam left to meet her husband. The Lord got angry at her for this, and so he drowned her husband with the boat. When Kalawati did not see her husband; she was shocked and she fainted on the floor.\n\nOn seeing his daughter and the sudden disappearance of the boat, the merchant was shocked. He prayed to Lord Satyanarayana, asked him for his forgiveness and prayed to the Lord to take them out of this difficulty. The Lord said to the merchant, “Oh merchant, your daughter, in a hurry to meet her husband has left my prasadam. When she goes back and takes the prasad with due respect, only then will she see her husband.” On hearing this, Kalawati ran home, ate the prasad, offered respects to Lord Satyanarayana and came back to meet her husband. When the merchant saw this, he was very happy.\n\nThe merchant then performed Lord Satyanarayana’s vratha with his family every month from then onwards. They all gained the pleasures of life and after their death they got the ultimate gift of ‘Moksha’ (Salvation – Liberation from the cycle of life and death).\n\nThe main role in this film was done by Anant Marathe. Anant Marathe aka Anant kumar was the brother of actor and famous singer Ram Marathe. I was searching for his information for quite some time. My search ended when I found an article written by his son about his father.\n\nAnant Marathe was born on 24-11- 1936. In a career that spanned over 50 years, he was a witness to many changes and upheavals in the Hindi film industry. Born in Pune, in a family that was doing well for itself, he had three brothers and two sisters. Losing his father at the tender age of four, he was forced to give up education and begin work, to fend for his family. In the process the family left Pune and came to Mumbai, the city that fed every soul.\n\nThe world of films, those days, was not an industry. It was just like a 9 to 5 job in an office. Anant Marathe, with his innocent looks, expressive eyes and inborn confidence, was chosen by Master Vinayak, to play a role as a child artiste in a hindi film, Chhayaa. In this film he played the role of a son, who for his own selfish means is used by his father, ( played by Late Shri Chandra Mohan).\n\nThe real breakthrough came when he was called for an audition at Prabhat Studios, the most distinguished film company of those days. This 1943-44 film was ‘ Ramshastri’, in which he was to play the part of Chhota (young) Ramshastri. Ramshastri Prabhune was the Supreme Judge of the Peshwa dynasty and known for his supreme judgement. Once he was selected for the role, his grooming as an actor really began. In the storyline, Chhota Ramshastri was depicted as a boy who hates to study and loves to play all day long. He would swim, roam about with his pet dog and enjoy life. For this role Anant marathe was made to learn swimming even though he was scared of water! He could not get along with the puppy dog, even though it was supposed to be his pet. And to top it all, after shooting, the swimming and the sequences with the dog were edited from the film! The song, ‘Don ghadicha daav, yala jeevan aise naav” sung by him was very popular at that time. He received an award for his performance as Ramshastri from Bengal Film Journalists Association as the best supporting actor of the year. This film was screened in a number of National and International film festivals.\n\nFilm industry in South India was very active in the early 50’s. Anant Marathe acted in a number of films produced by the South Indian film studios, namely AVM, Gemini studios etc. Shri Chettiar of AVM was planning a socio-mythological film on the life of a famous saint. The lead role was played by Shahu Modak. The film in general was devotional and to bring in an interesting element, a comic character was created, in the form of the saint’s shishya ( pupil ). This role was offered to Anant Marathe and he displayed histrionics that astonished everybody on the sets.\n\nThe Director who groomed the great showman Raj Kapoor was Kidar Sharma and Anant Marathe had the privilege to work in one of his films, this time as a villain! The film was Hamaari Yaad Aayegi. This film also launched Tanuja, who would be known as a talented actress in the coming years. Anant Marathe played the role of a character called Pyarelaal, a very deceiving name for a villain! He is a suave character, moving about in the company of elite people but behind the cute face there is a monster of sorts, a wolf in sheep’s clothes. Anant Marathe, with his charming smile was very stunning, not only in his looks but in every move. Kidar Sharma was known to reward any actor who performed a great scene with a 4 anna coin, known as chavanni in those days. A chavanni earned for a great shot was like an achievement. And Anant Marathe earned many, which he cherished till the end.\n\nHis journey as an actor continued with great flourish. Since he could speak Marathi and Hindi fluently, he received offers from both Marathi and Hindi films. He was truly a bi-lingual actor.\n\nManoj Kumar was inspired by the life of Bhagat Singh, the great sikh patriot from Punjab and was planning a film on his life. Manoj Kumar and Prem Chopra were to play the roles of Bhagat Singh and Sukhdev respectively but casting for Raajguru, the third freedom fighter was still to be done, as Manoj Kumar wasn’t happy with the short-listed few, to play the role. Manoj Kumar heard about Anant Marathe, who had acted in many hindi and marathi films. Anant Marathe was asked to come over and meet Mnoj Kumar. One look at him and he had found his Raajguru! The experience of working in a truly patriotic film, that too with a thespian like Pran who played a cameo in Shaheed, was a very inspiring experience for him. Incidentally Pran did not charge a single rupee for this role! Shaheed brought a wave of patriotism in the audience, they cheered and loved their heroes. The real mother of Bhagat Singh was felicitated at the premiere of this film at Delhi. She was moved by the performances of every actor in the film. What’s more, a special screening was arranged for the then Prime Minister of India, Late Shri Lal Bahadur Shastri, who praised the film and awarded certificates of honour to all the actors.\n\nAnant Marathe acted in over 250 Hindi and Marathi films, out of which 71 films are Hindi. he also sang 5 songs in 5 Hindi films.When he made his foray in Hindi films, he was not very fluent in Hindi so he took lessons from a tutor who taught him the nuances of Hindi, thus improving the pronunciations so he could speak the language flawlessly. He also learnt English to give his persona the required sparkle, so important for a lead hero. He had to give up formal schooling due to circumstances that prevailed and may be he made up for it in this manner.\n\nSome of the films he acted in are, Bhakta Bilwamangal (Durga Khote), Bhakta Gopalbhaiya (Amir Kanataki), Geeta (Chandra Mohan, Durga Khote), Gokul ( Kamla Kotnis, Sapru), Jivacha Sakha (Durga Khote, Sulochana), Malti Madhav (Durga khote, Baby Shakuntala), Nanda Kumar ((Durga Khote), Sant Janabai (Hirabai Badodekar), Seeta Swayamvar (Durga khote, Baby Shakuntala), Jawaee Majha Bhala, Choravar Mor, Bhintila Kaan Astaat, Shri Krishna Darshan ( (Durga khote, Usha Kiran), Sampoona Ramayan, Bharat Milaap and many more.\n\nIn “Barkhaa”, he played the role of a doctor opposite Nanda. The song, “ Ek raat mein do-do chaand khile…” became an instant hit. “Bada bhai”, a film starring late Ajit, had him playing Ajit’s younger brother with Amita as the female lead. In “Sanskaar” also he played the lead role opposite Amita. He acted in some Gujrati films also.\n\nIn the early stages acting was like a job for him but soon it became a passion. All these years, while he worked in front of the camera as an actor, he learnt the finer details of film making, by observing, making mental notes. He had a flair for writing. In fact, he was a habitual diary writer. He wrote poems for small children and later they were published in the form of a book. He had a good voice and was planning to be a singer but destiny had something else in store for him, a career in acting.\n\nHe wielded the megaphone in 1974, for a Marathi film named “Sonarana Tochala Kaan”, starring comedian and an intense actor Nilu Phule in lead role with Usha Chavan as the female lead. It was inspired by a Hollywood caper with famous comedian, Bob Hope in lead. The film was a huge success all over Maharashtra. Soon he was set to direct a film in Hindi. After a detailed script was worked out by him, the producer backed out. Losing hope but not the spirit, he turned a new leaf and began work on his next project, once again in Marathi. The name of the film was “ Bijlee”, meaning lightning.\n\nRangat-Sangat Pratishthan, founded by the wife of late Shri Shahu Modak conferred the Manus puraskaar, an award on him for life-time achievement. The name for this award, for obvious reason is Manus (meaning human), a film by this name had Shahu Modak in a memorable role as a Havildaar.\n\nAnant Marathe lived a contented life. Having worked in films from the age of 8 took its toll on him and he passed away on 1-12- 2002.(Thanks to http://www.writewrong.wordpress.com, muVyz, HFGK, and my notes).\n\nLet us now enjoy the song by Manna Dey under his own Baton….\n\nSong- Bhagwan bhagat tere tujhko bula rahe hain (Mahapooja)(1954) Singer- Manna Dey, Lyricist- Ramesh Gupta, MD-Manna Dey\n\nLyrics\n\nbhagwaaa aa aaa aan\n\no o o\n\nbhagwaan bhagat tere\n\nbhagwaan bhagat tere\n\ntujhko bula rahe hain aen\n\nbhagwaan bhagat tere\n\ntujhko bula rahe hain\n\nbarson se tu kasauti\n\nkarta raha hai jinki\n\nab tujhko chhod Mohan\n\njaayen wo sharan kiski\n\ndukhiyaare bhookhe pyaase\n\naansoo baha rahe hain\n\nbhagwaan bhagat tere\n\nsoona pada hai madhuban n\n\nsoona pada hai madhuban\n\ngauyen pukaarti hain\n\ngokul ki kunj galiyaan\n\ntujhko nihaartin hain\n\nwo gop baal gwaale\n\ngun tere gaa rahe hain\n\nbhagwaan bhagat tere\n\nek baar phir se aaja aa\n\naaja aa\n\naaja aa aa aa aa aa aa\n\nek baar phir se aaja\n\nmurli madhur baja ja aa\n\njeevan ke taar Mohan\n\nek baar jhanjhana jaa aa\n\nsun’ne ko gyaan geeta\n\nhum tilmila rahe hain\n\nbhagwaan bhagat tere\n\ntujhko bula rahe hain aen\n\nbhagwan bhagat tere\n\nThis article is written by Peevesie’s mom, a fellow enthusiast of Hindi movie music and a contributor to this blog.

At that time I didn’t know what the phrase “shree ganesh karein” meant. As time passed, I learnt that it meant a new-start for any activity or venture by seeking the blessings of your God and elders. I know for sure that followers of Islam say “Bismillah” at similar situations. I think it is a very Indian practise. I know of students who used to write some holy symbols on top of every page of their answer sheets at the time of important examinations. ( I have heard that the various education boards have prohibited this recently, don’t know if this is being implemented. 🙂 )\n\nSo, today happens to be the chaturthi of the Shukla paksha in the month of Bhadrapad; by the Vikrama Samvat calendar. By the panchangs followed in the South of India, the day was trutheeya till 12.39p.m. & then Chaturthi has set in. Don’t know if that is the reason South Indians are celebrating Ganesh/ Vinayaka Chaturthi today.\n\nSince morning I have been receiving Ganpati Bappa Morya & Happy Ganesh Chaturthi messages. Then there are messages of Hartalika Teej. This is one festival about which I have no knowledge. Never heard of it. So I googled. This is what I have understood.\n\n“Teej (Nepali: तीज) literally meaning the “third” denoting the third day after the new moon when the monsoon begins as per the Hindu calendar. It is a combined name for 3 Hindu festivals primarily dedicated to Hindu deities – the mother goddess Parvati and her male consort Lord Shiva. The festival is mainly celebrated by married women & unmarried girls mostly in North India and Nepal to wish for the long life of their husband or future husband and to welcome the arrival of monsoon season with the singing, swings, dancing, enjoyment, prayer rituals and often fast. “Teej” is a generic name referring to the three types of Teej festivals – ‘Haryali Teej’ on the third day after new moon of the Shravana month, ‘Kajari Teej’ 15 days later, and ‘Hartalika Teej’ another 15 days later. The ‘Haryali Teej’ (literally meaning the “green teej”), also known as the ‘Sindhara Teej’, ‘Chhoti Teej’, ‘Shravana Teej’ or ‘Sawan Teej’, falls on the third day after new moon of the Shravana month, marking the day when Lord Shiva consented to goddess Parvati’s wish to marry him. Celebrations by married women, who visit their parental home includes preparing swings on which they then swing and sing happy Teej songs. The ‘Kajari Teej’ (literally meaning the “dark teej”), also known as the ‘Badi Teej’, is celebrated 15 days after the “Haryali Teej” during the dark (waxing crescent) phase of the moon. The ‘Hartalika Teej’ (literally a composite word of “Harat” and “Aalika” meaning “a woman’s kidnap with her consent by her female friends”), falls one lunar month after the “Haryali Teej” on the third day after new moon in the month of Bhadrapada which usually falls a day before the Ganesh Chaturthi. This teej marks the occasion when Parvati encouraged her friends to kidnap her to escape the marriage with Lord Vishnu after her father Himalaya wanted to give her hand in marriage to him. It is celebrated by married women who observe the “nirjala vrata”” (water-less fast) for the long life of their husband.”\n\nThat explains what I saw yesterday. I shall explain that here too. Bangalore has a sizeable number of Nepalese who work in beauty parlours, homes as maids etc. I am sure there are many of them working in the I.T. industry too. Yesterday, my maid took a day off, “teej hai madam.”. Then I saw the whole brigade of them dressed in their best sarees (most of them being Red), with lots of sindoor on their ‘maang’ & I was wondering about the customs related with the festival. It seems they give more importance to “Teej” vis-a-viz Ganesh Chaturthi.\n\nI would like to include a little note about the day for us, my family to be precise. We don’t get the Bappa (idol) home but do a pooja to the in-house Ganesha idol. We don’t have any fasting or feasting but normally don’t eat anything till the pooja is done. The main prasad we make is steamed Modak in sweet & savoury variations. It seems my husband’s grandma used to fast on Ganesh Chaturthi (don’t recall if she used to have the various prasad that was there) which she ended on the next day called Rishi Panchami.\n\nBut whatever be the method of worshipping the Elephant-headed god he is the one who is worshipped before the start of any venture.\n\n“ādi-pūjyaṃ gaṇādhyakṣhaṃ, umā-putraṃ vināyakam”\n\nThe Blog has just touched a new century. Actually, it has reached a new 1000. Let us wish for new centuries & thousands. All the best to Atulji & his trusted lieutenant Sudhirji. The milestone has come on a festival day.\n\nLet us have a song worshipping the Vignaharta, Vigneswara, Ekdanta, Gauriputra- and all the other names by which he is addressed.\n\nThe song is a traditional prayer song from the 2005 release “Viruddh”. The singing voice is of Shankar Mahadevan. The song plays at the start of the film which was directed by Mahesh Manjrekar & produced by A. B. Corp. Ltd in association with Satyajeet Movies. The cast was lead by Amitabh Bachchan with Sharmila Tagore playing his wife. John Abraham was his son whose love-interest was Anusha Dandekar. Then there were Sanjay Dutt, Prem Chopra, Sachin Khedekar, Viju Khote, Sharat Saxena, Shivaji Satam, Amitabh Dayal etc. playing important characters. The song starts in John Abraham’s voice where he is giving a background about his father.\n\n(Note: I don’t think the video that I found on YouTube is as it appears in the film, but it gives us a run-through the film)\n\nJai Shree Ganeshaya Namah.\n\nGanpati Bappa Moraya\n\nSong-Shree Ganesh dheemahi (Virudhh)(2005) Singer-Shankar Mahadevan, MD-Ajay Atul\n\nChorus\n\nLyrics\n\nhmmm hmm hmmm hmm\n\naa aa aa aa aa aa aa\n\ngananayakay ganadaivataya ganadhyakshay dheemahi\n\ngun shariray gun manditay guneshanay dheemahi\n\ngunaditay gunadhishay guna pravishtay dheemahi\n\nekadantay vakratunday gauri tanaya dheemahi\n\ngajeshanay bhalchandray shree ganeshay dheemahi\n\nekadantay vakratunday gauri tanaya dheemahi\n\ngajeshanay bhalchandray shree ganeshay dheemahi\n\naa aa aa aa aa\n\naa aa aa a aa aa\n\naa aa aa aa aa\n\ngaanachaturay gaanapranay gaanantaratmane gaanotsukhay\n\ngaanamattaya gaannott sukh mana se\n\nguru pujitaaya, guru daivataaya, guru kulasthaine\n\nguru vikramaya, guiyy pravaraya gurave guna gurave\n\ngurudaitya kalakchhetre, guru dharma sada radhyay\n\nguru putra paritraatre guru paakhand khand khay\n\ngeet saaray, geet tatvaay geet gotraay dheemahi\n\ngoodh gulfay, gandh mattay gojay praday dheemahi\n\ngunaditay gunaadhishay gun pravishtay dheemahi\n\nekadantay vakratunday gauri tanaya dheemahi\n\ngajeshanay bhalchandray shree ganeshay dheemahi\n\nekadantay vakratunday gauri tanaya dheemahi\n\ngajeshaanay bhaalchandray shree ganeshay dheemahi\n\ngandharv rajay gandhay gandharv gana shravan pranaime\n\ngaadha anuragay granthaay geetay grantarth tanmaiye\n\ngurili gunavate ganapataye\n\ngranth geetay granth geyay grantha taratmane\n\ngeet leenaay geeta shrayay\n\ngeetvaadya patve, dhyeya charitaaya gaay gavaray\n\ngandharvaprikrupe\n\ngaayakadhina vighraahayagangajal pranayavate\n\ngauri stanamadhaya\n\ngauri hridaynandanaya\n\ngaur bhaanu sutaay\n\ngauri ganeshwaraaya\n\ngauri pranyay gauri pravanay\n\ngaur bhaavay dheemahi\n\nosahastray gowardhanay gopgopaay dheemahi\n\ngunaaditaay gunadhishaay gun pravishtaay dheemahi\n\nekadantay vakratunday gauri tanaya dheemahi\n\ngajeshanay bhaalchandray shree ganeshaay dheemahi\n\nekadantay vakratundaay gauri tanaya dheemahi\n\ngajeshanay bhalchandray shree ganeshaya dheemahi\n\naa aa aaa\n\naa aa aa aa\n\naa aa aa aa\n\naa aa aa aa\n\nThis article is written by Sudhir, a fellow enthusiast of Hindi movie music and a contributor to this blog.

The centenary anniversary of Mukeh has just passed. Today is the five thousand five hundred and fortieth day of publication of this blog. A little while back, earlier today, we had the 16 million, 48 thousand and seven hundredth visitor, to come visit this part of the virtual universe, maybe looking for a specific song, or information or lyrics. We are now a standard benchmark in the online world.\n\nAnd we bring to you today, the 18 thousandth post being added this incredible library.\n\nIs time real? Is there this invisible milieu that stretches forever in all directions? Or this is just an awareness that progressively witnesses a changing world around us? Is there a changing, decaying entity with in us, which actually experiences this awareness and generates a perception of a flow? And we name this time.\n\nI do not recall where was I on the 19th July of 2008. Must have been a normal day, and a normal flow of experiences. Wonder what others may recall for that day. I am sure Atul ji and Raja ji will surely recall. For they were the doers of setting in motion, this phenomenon. Nothing grandiose was on the horizon. Just that an engineer with Railways, with a penchant for music of Hindi films, wanted to start writing about that music. All in a very humble way.\n\nThe expectations may not even have materialized in Atul ji’s mind. Maybe a thousand posts, for a thousand songs, and then to move on to a new endeavor. Maybe something more about cricket. Or may be, another thousand songs, kind of the total Hindi film universe that was inside Atul ji’s mind.\n\nMaybe what Atul ji also did not realize at that time. His humble initiation of this effort, would soon take on a life of its own. Ah yes, it did. And it slowly, imperceptibly transformed into this amazing wonderment on the internet – the ASAD phenomenon.\n\nPeople recognize it now, they talk about it. The mention of ASAD in certain type of gatherings sounds normal. Everyday nearly three thousand people will visit here. That makes it an average of 120 visits per hour, and so on and so forth – the math can be extrapolated in so many diverse ways.\n\nThe phenomenon is in the making. It is generating a history of its own. The richness of information that is being compiled everyday provides many views into the ASAD universe. Maybe, maybe, in some future, this blog will be a subject of research and analysis.\n\nThe table below provides a very simple view into the progression of the thousandth milestones over the past years.\n\nMilestone Song Title Film and Year Date and Day Blog Day 1000 Piya Ham Saat Mulk Ka Paani Lootmaar 1980 30-Mar-09 Mon 255 2000 Dhakdhak Karti Chali Jeewan Ki Rail Re Dilruba 1950 27-Sep-09 Sun 436 3000 Maa Mujhe Apne Aanchal Mein Chhupaa Le Chhota Bhai 1966 20-Sep-10 Mon 794 4000 Kyaa Se Kyaa Ho Gayaa Bewafaa Tere Pyaar Mein Guide 1965 13-Jun-11 Mon 1,060 5000 Hamen To Loot Liyaa Mil Ke Husn Waalon Ne Al Hi Laal 1958 13-Nov-11 Sun 1,213 6000 Geet Kitne Gaa Chuki Hoon NFS – Asha Bhosle 1960 23-May-12 Wed 1,405 7000 Falak Se Utre Zameen Pe Taare NFS – Mohammed Rafi 1960s 13-Nov-12 Tue 1,579 8000 Beautiful Baby Of Bombay Ek Phool Chaar Kaante 1960 28-Apr-13 Sun 1,745 9000 Ankhiyan Sang Ankhiyaan Laagi Aaj Badaa Aadmi 1961 13-Nov-13 Wed 1,944 10000 Phul Rahin Belariyaan Dolen Trapped 1931 20-Jul-14 Sun 2,193 11000 Kaam Ki Dhun Mein Hain Rawaan Gyaarah Hazaar Ladkiyaan 1962 31-Mar-15 Tue 2,447 12000 Door Desh Se Aane Waale. . .

Not ignored, but also not celebrated as we do now. For example, the thousandth song, while acknowledging the milestone, was in fact a short write up, and just two comments – from Lalitha ji and Raja ji.\n\nA similar handling of the two thousandth post. Acknowledge the milestone, the write up maybe a little longer than the one for the first thousandth, and three people commented.\n\nThings started to become more interesting with the third thousandth milestone. It was a long post, written by Raja ji. Eight people commented on the post, out of which 4 were simply requests for an English translation of the lyrics. But the write up is really great.\n\nWith the fourth thousandth post, we step into the space of real serious writing, accompanied by serious discussions and comments. The write up is classic. [Raja ji – where are you, missing your presence on the blog for a long time now]. Ten people commented – and real serious discussions in comments too, with multiple back and forth conversations.\n\nBy the time we arrive at the fifth thousandth post, the pattern is now set in seriousness. The search and choice of the song, and the write up itself, discussion in comments – everything has now become a considerable enterprise.\n\nBeyond that, the search for songs has become a major effort. The attempt is to bring on board songs with a dramatic uniqueness, and a quality of rarity associated with it. Let us come to the song for today’s eighteenth thousandth post.\n\nThe centenary celebration for Mukesh has just happened some weeks back. A back and forth conversation has been happening between Mahesh ji and myself, apropos this song – when to uncover this and when to post.\n\nThe song being presented today is in a category of rarity all of its own. In a manner of speaking this song is simply one of its kind. As far as I have been able to ascertain, there is no other song of this type. Yes, it is a Mukesh song. And the remarkable feature of this song – it also has the voice of Nitin Mukesh. As far as I could search and confirm, this is the only song that contains the voices of this father son singer duo. This makes it special, as well as rare.\n\nThe aspect of rarity is really a uniqueness of this song, and also the reason that it has remained away from limelight since its creation more than 53 years ago. It was created and recorded but it did not appear in the movie. The producer/director of the movie made a decision not to include it in the film. And the next misfortune that befell this song is that it never got published on a gramophone or a vinyl record. In essence, this song was lost to the outside world, for good.\n\nWell almost. It most probably survived on a spool tape after it was recorded. It never got forwarded to the gramophone company to be published. It would have been part of some original planning sheets for the songs of the film. When the decision was made to exclude it, then it got excluded even from the booklet and other publicity material prepared for the film. And so, except for some very secluded existence, this song was obliterated from view of the known world.\n\nWe get the first inkling of its existence when the Surat based film historian and die hard Mukesh fan Shri Harish Raghuvanshi ji listed it in the updated and enlarged 2nd edition of the Mukesh Geet Kosh, which he pubished recently in 2020. There were murmurs heard earlier about the possibility of a song containing the voice of this father son duo, but nothing proven ever came to light.\n\nAnd even so, in the 2nd edition of the Mukesh Geet Kosh, Harish ji identifies and lists this song at number 978, he still does not identify two major features of this song. First, he has included this song in the non-film songs section of the book. Secondly, the name of Nitin Mukesh is not listed as one of the singers. For that matter, the name of Sushma Shreshtha is also not listed. However, a foot note is added for good measure, which says that based on available information, this song was created by Kalyanji Anandji for the 1970 film ‘Ghar Ghar Ki Kahani’, and that it was excluded from the film.\n\nThe actual song itself makes it first appearance online a little over five years ago. There is YouTube channel by the name ‘Pavan Tanay’. The owner of this channel uploaded this song on 28 November, 2017. All good so far. A kind hearted gentleman who brings forth one of the rarest treasures of HFM, and puts it on his channel without much fanfare.\n\nBut in doing this favor to the world, he also created an exacerbating problem for all. He provides completely erroneous information about the antecedents of this song. He links this song to the 1982 film ‘Hum Sab Ek hain’, with MD’s name given as Khayyam, and the lyricist’s name given as Jaan Nisar Akhtar.\n\n[Author’s Note: This post was planned to be done yesterday. But then this spin on the correct credits of this song took away practically my entire day in trying to resolve this confusion. Mahesh ji has been part of that multi pronged effort of mine yesterday.]\n\nI have this song in my collection for a while now. It was given to me by another dear friend and collector of Hindi films and songs, Ahsaan Qasim, who is based in Hapur, near Delhi. So when Mahesh ji sent me the link from the ‘Pavan Tanay’ channel some days back, and I viewed it now just as part of the preparation for this post – it felt like a googly bowled at me.\n\nSo more research started. The first discovery was that yes there is a film by a similar name in 1982, listed in the Geet Kosh volume 6. I say similar, because the correct name of the film is ‘Hum Ek Hain’, and not ‘Hum Sab Ek Hain’. That actually pointed us towards the fact that this ‘Pavan Tanay’ channel could well be full of erroneous information. Mahesh ji then confirmed this thought with his message that yes, the channel contains a lot of erroneous info.\n\nBut still, the confirmations had to be done. So I was in back and forth conversation with many friends, including Zafar Bhai (who in turn tried to get confirmation from RMIM group of which he is a member), Ahsaan Bhai, Mahesh ji, Vishkarma ji, Bakhshish ji, Javed Bhai and others.\n\nAs I checked the Geet Kosh volume 6, the entry listed for this film is completely blank except for the name of the production company and censor details. It is obvious that Hamraaz ji could not also find any additional info, other than what he may have extracted from the censor data. But ‘Pavan Tanay’ upload did point us in the direction of Khayyam. I recalled that Vishwas Nerurkar ji of Bombay has published the filmography and sonography of Khayyam in book form. I then also initiated conversation with him, to confirm. His response was quite clear. Yes the film of 1982 does have music by Khayyam, lyrics by Jaan Nisar Akhtar. But this song is definitely not from that film. He pointed me towards the entry of this film in his book, where two songs are listed. One is a solo in the voice of Mukesh and the second is duet in the voice of Mukesh and Jagjeet Kaur. This four singer song is definitely not from that film.\n\nThat settled one part of the controversy. Mahesh ji also pointed out that there is another film from 1969 with the same title ‘Hum Ek Hain’, which is listed in the Geet Kosh volume 4. But that film has music by Usha Khanna, and so it does not stand in contention with the credits for this song. Mahesh ji then also dug out two Wikipedia pages. One page is for Nitin Mukesh. It has this song listed in the list of songs that Nitin Mukesh has sung with other singers. The second Wikipedia page is for the 1970 film ‘Ghar Ghar Ki Kahani’. This page also, thankfully lists this song.\n\nSo after much ado (really about nothing – Shakespeare would have been delighted), we agreed to decide in favor of ‘Ghar Ghar Ki Kahani’. It was well past midnight by the time I firmed up this conclusion and decided to go ahead with the post. And as they say – man proposes, fatigue disposes, my writing energy lasted till about 2 am and then I crashed. I wrote to Atul ji that this post will have to wait for the next day, i.e. today, 17th September, 2023, the 5540th day on the blog calendar.\n\nAh yes, I should have noted this earlier. Although Harish ji’s Mukesh Geet Kosh is silent about the two additional singers, other than Mukesh and Asha Bhosle, the identity has been established and confirmed by listening to the song, and conferring with other knowledgeable friends who have confirmed that the song does have the voices of Nitin Mukesh and Sushma Shreshtha.\n\nThose who have seen the 1970 film ‘Ghar Ghar Ki Kahani’, will recall. The film is a very traditional family drama. The main family has five members, Balraj Sahni and Nirupa Roy as the upright and honest parents, and three children Ravi, Roopa and Raja (roles played respectively by Mahesh Kumar, Baby Sonia (aka Neetu Singh) and Master Ripple). This song sounds like a prayer that the family sings together at Pooja time in their home. Given the cast of actors, and without having a video to support my statements, I would say that Mukesh gives playback to Balraj Sahni, Asha Bhosle gives playback to Nirupa Roy, and Nitin Mukesh and Sushma Shreshtha are giving payback to the child characters Ravi and Roopa.\n\nNitin Mukesh is born on 27 June, 1950. At the time of recording of this song, he would have completed his 19th year, and would have been in his 20th year. Sushma Shreshtha is born in the year 1960, and would have been just 9 or 10 years old at the time of recording. These ages sound quite right as we listen to these two voices in the second antaraa of this song. That can be considered another piece of evidence in favor of this song being from a 1970 film and not a 1982 film.\n\nQuite an adventure it was – a lot of time spent just because some folks are not careful about the information that they attach to their uploads. At first I was thinking of using the ‘Pavan Tanay’ link for the post, but then decided against it. I then uploaded the song from my own collection, with the correct and complete information.\n\nSo we bring this 18,000th offering to this blog. Celebrations delayed by a day, but then what is a day, and what is an era – the feeling of the self inside me is still the same as it was way back in 2010, when I first joined this bandwagon. Nothing has changed. There is music everyday. And that is all that matters. It will be 19 soon, and then 20. And the bandwagon trundles along, along behind the banjaara with a musical instrument on his back, crossing basti basti parvat parvat, without a pause, without a change of pace.\n\nAnd the music plays on. . .\n\nLet the winds blow\n\nLet the rivers flow\n\nLet the sun and stars\n\nTraverse the skies as they may\n\nLet the music play on\n\nLet the music play on\n\nTime is a figment of imagination\n\nAnd age is just a number\n\nLet the music play on\n\nLet the music play on\n\nye hansta hua karvaan zindagi ka na poochho chala hai kidhar\n\ntamanna hai ye saath chalte rahen hum na beete kabhi ye safar\n\nSong – Hey Re Dayamay, Apni Daya Se (Ghar Ghar Ki Kahani) (1970) Singer – Mukesh, Asha Bhosle, Nitin Mukesh, Sushma Shreshtha, Lyrics – [Unattributed], MD – Kalyanji Anandji\n\nNitin Mukesh + Sushma Shreshtha\n\nAll in Chorus\n\nLyrics\n\nhey re dayamay\n\napni daya se\n\nhey re dayamay\n\napni daya se\n\nsachchaai ki shakti do\n\nsab kuchh tum ne hum ko diya hai\n\nbas ek apni bhakti do\n\nhey re dayamay\n\nnaam tera is ghar mein goonje\n\nhey giridhar giridhaari\n\nhey giridhar giridhaari\n\nsada phale phoole is jag mein\n\nye nanhi phulwaari\n\nbhav saagar se\n\npaar kare jo\n\nprem ki aisi kashti do\n\nsab kuchh tum ne ham ko diya hai\n\nbas ek apni bhakti do\n\nhey re dayamay\n\ntum bhi maakhan chor ho mohan\n\ntum bhi maakhan chor ho mohan\n\nhum hain bal gopal re\n\nhum hain bal gopal re\n\nhum se koi bhool jo ho to\n\nkarna kshama nandlal re\n\napne kul ki shaan baney hum\n\naisi hum ko shakti do\n\nsab kuchh tum ne ham ko diya hai\n\nbas ek apni bhakti do\n\nhey re dayamay\n\ndukh mein hum ko dheeraj dena\n\nsukh mein na abhimaan ho\n\nsukh mein na abhimaan ho\n\naisi daya karo hum pe dayaalu\n\nsukh dukh ek samaan ho\n\nteri khushi mein khush rahen hum\n\naisi hum ko shakti do\n\nsab kuchh tum ne ham ko diya hai\n\nbas ek apni bhakti do\n\nhey re dayamay\n\n————————————————\n\nHindi script lyrics (Provided by Sudhir)\n\n————————————————\n\nहे रे दयामय\n\nअपनी दया से\n\nहे रे दयामय\n\nअपनी दया से\n\nसच्चाई की शक्ति दो\n\nसब कुछ तुम ने हम को दिया है\n\nबस एक अपनी भक्ति दो\n\nहे रे दयामय\n\nनाम तेरा इस घर में गूँजे\n\nहे गिरधर गिरधारी\n\nहे गिरधर गिरधारी\n\nसदा फले फूले इस जग में\n\nये नन्ही फुलवारी\n\nभाव सागर से पार करे जो\n\nप्रेम की ऐसी कश्ती दो\n\nसब कुछ तुम ने हम को दिया है\n\nबस एक अपनी भक्ति दो\n\nहे रे दयामय\n\nतुम भी माखन चोर हो\n\nतुम भी माखन चोर हो\n\nहम हैं बाल गोपाल रे\n\nहम हैं बाल गोपाल रे\n\nहम से कोई भूल जो हो तो\n\nकरना क्षमा नन्दलाल रे\n\nअपने कुल की शान बने हम\n\nऐसी हमको शक्ति दो\n\nसब कुछ तुम ने हम को दिया है\n\nबस एक अपनी भक्ति दो\n\nहे रे दयामय\n\nदुख में हमको धीरज देना\n\nसुख में ना अभिमान हो\n\nसुख में ना अभिमान हो\n\nऐसी दया करो हम पे दयालु\n\nसुख दुख एक समान हो\n\nतेरी खुशी में खुश रहे हम\n\nऐसी हमको शक्ति दो\n\nसब कुछ तुम ने हम को दिया है\n\nबस एक अपनी भक्ति दो\n\nहे रे दयामय\n\nThis article is written by Sadanand Kamath, a fellow enthusiast of Hindi movie music and a regular contributor to this blog.

Let the flute recital of Lord Krishna bring the melody in everyone’s life. On this happy occasion, I have taken up for discussion in this article, a 3-D Animated film, ‘Krishna Aur Kans’ (2012) which was released in August 2012 around Krishna Janmashtami day.\n\nThe film simultaneously made in Hindi, English, Tamil, and Telugu was produced by Reliance Animation and was directed by Vikram Veturi. Kamlesh Pandey wrote the screenplay and dialogues. Vikram Veturi has been working with Reliance Animation as a Creative Director for the past 12 years. He has directed many award-winning animation films. His recent works as Director are ‘Little Singham’ for Discovery Kids India, and ‘Golmaal Junior’ for Nickelodeon India.\n\nBeing an animation film, ‘Krishna Aur Kans’ (2012) has no star cast. However, there were as many ‘voice cast’ for as many animation characters in the film. They included many well-known actors and voice-over artists. They were Manoj Bajpayee (for Nand), Juhi Chawla (Yashoda), Meghna Erande (Bal Krishna), Prachi Save (Grown-up Krishna), Rajshri Nath (Radha), Om Puri (Kans), Sachin Pilgaonkar (Vasudev), Supriya Pilgaonkar (Devki), Soniya Nair (Balram), AK Hangal (Ugrasen), Anupam Kher (Gargacharya), Ninad Kamat (Narad), Mukesh Khanna (Akroor) etc. Harish Bhimani was the narrator.\n\nThe largest numbers of crew for the film were those who were associated with Animation and Visual Effects. The target audience for the film was mainly kids though the film would also appeal to adults who would have accompanied children.\n\nThe story covered in the Animated film is well known as most of us would have read the story in our childhood. The broad sequence of the story in the film starts from the atrocities of Prince Kans, and the marriage of Devki with Vasudev. However, they are immediately put in the jail as soon as Kans hears the celestial announcement that the 8th child of his sister, Devki would end the tyranny of Kans. The next in sequence is the birth of the 8th child of Devki who is secretly taken to Gokul and given on adoption to Yashoda and Nand who have their own son, Balaram. Next is the parts of Krishna leela and the killing of demons, Bakasur, Trinavarta and Putna who were sent by Kans to kill Bal Krishna. The film ends with Bal Krishna killing Kans in duel with him in the stadium in front of a large crowd who hails Krishna for ending the tyranny of Kans.\n\nI have watched a few animation films on TV channels like ‘Jungle Book’, ‘Doraemon’, the older ‘Tom and Jerry’ series. After watching ‘Krishna Aur Kans’ (2012), I feel that the quality of animation is comparable to those listed above. The slick screenplay has ensured that there are no dull moments while watching the film. Each of the main animation characters in the film has given a feel of their respective mood to the audience. For example, Kans looks a real tyrant. Ugrasen gives a feel of a helpless father of Kans. The birth of Krishna and his arrival at Gokul have been nicely depicted in animation characters in the rejoicing mood. Bal Krishna shows a look of innocence while caught in wrongdoings. The entire animated characters including Yashoda, Nand, Radha and gopis display gloomy faces when Krishna is leaving Vrindavan. The various moods in the scenes are well captured in animation.\n\nDespite the film being widely distributed all over India and getting tax exemptions in some states, the film was a box office disaster according to Box Office Report.\n\nThe film has 9 songs and one vedic chanting. All 9 songs have been written by Swanand Kirkire which have been set to music by Shantanu Moitra. On the occasion of Krishna Janmashtami today, I am presenting the first song, “Aayega Koi Aayega, Jag Mein Chhaa Jaayega” from the film to appear on the Blog.

In fact, film titles are more of a culprit than the people working in films, because the incidence of repetitions is several times more in film titles. A field where the Same Name film is made in 7 different years is more dangerous than the same names of artistes, which may not be more than 3 or 4 operating in the same period to cause confusion. That is the reason a film should not be mentioned without its year in which it is censored/ released to avoid confusion.\n\nLike many other films of SNC, today’s film Patit Paawan was also made twice. The first such film was made in 1933. When you hear the word ‘Patit Paawan’, you automatically complete the phrase with ” Sitaram”. The word Patit Paawan is associated with Shri Ram. This is based on a story that Ahilya, who was the wife of Rishi Gautam,was very beautiful and was cheated by Indra Dev. Smitten by her beauty, he comes disguised as Rishi Gautam, her husband and has a good time with her. When the real Rishi Gautam comes to know about it, he is so furious that he curses Ahilya and turns her into a stone and she would have to remain in that state till Sri Ram’s feet touched her when she would regain her human form. After a few years, Lord Shri Ram comes that way and his foot touches the stone and thereby frees Ahilya from the curse and she regains her human form. Thus, a Patit (the fallen one) is made Paawan (is purified), hence the name Patit Paawan for Shri Ram.\n\nHowever, today’s film story is not about Ahilya, but it is about a devotee called Nama. More about it later. The story of Ahilya was made into a film “Patit Paawan ” aka Ahilya Uddhar”,in 1933. In this film Durga Khote was Ahilya, P.Jairaj was Indra and Krishnarao Gorey was Rishi Gautam. There is a very funny episode about this film.\n\nPaidi Jairaj or P. Jairaj ( 28-9-1909 to 11-8-2000 ) was a very handsome and well built young man, when he joined films. After doing 11 silent films, he did his first Talkie, “Shikari” in 1932. It was produced by a Hyderabad based company-Eastern Films, acted in 170 films and went on to receive the Phalke award and Padma Bhushan in 1980.\n\nIn the early phase of Talkie films, there used to be, on average 15 to 20 songs in every film. It was compulsory for every Hero and Heroine to sing their own songs live( playback came in 1935 and became common in 38-39 only). To help the non-singer actors, studios used to keep trained classical experts. Otherwise also most Music Directors in those days were classical singers themselves.\n\nThus, Jairaj too was expected to sing songs. He did not like singing, because he was horrible at singing. The Music Director of the film Patit paawan-33 was Prof.B.R.Deodhar, who was a classical singer himself. (Later on he established a musical school). He was determined to make Jairaj sing a song. Finally a song was recorded and filmed-“prem magan sakhi”. Jairaj had sung it so badly that the song was removed from the film from the second show itself. Jairaj is probably the only Hero of those days who never sang in films. Even as a lip syncer of songs (after playback singing became the norm),Jairaj has sung less than 20 songs on screen despite acting in nearly 170 movies!\n\nFilm Patit Paawan (1955) was made by D.K.Films, owned by actor Sapru and his actress wife Hemavati. It had music by Jamaal Sen and the cast was Sapru, Sulochana, lalita Pawar, Sulochana Chaterjee, Hemavati, Ulhas, Vinod kumar, Jeevan, Dar Kashmiri and many others. The film was directed by Vasant Painter. Some readers may remember the early cinema producer and director Baburao Painter, but Vasant painter was not at all a famous name.\n\nVasant Anandrao Painter was born in a village near Kolhapur on 13-8- 1913. His father Anandrao, along with cousin Baburao Painter wanted to make films. Anandrao had bought a second hand Projector, which he turned into a Camera and shot a short film also. Unfortunately, Anandrao Mistry or Anandrao Painter died suddenly on 22-10-1915.Vasant Painter was only a 2 year old baby at that time. Baburao Painter went on to become the famous founder of Marathi films in the Silent Era.\n\nBy the time Vasant became 16 year old,the Silent film era was in full swing and many films were made in Kolhapur, Poona and Bombay. He had a liking for painting,so he picked up poster painting work,first in Maharashtra Film company and later in Prabhat film company when it was started in Kolhapur. Actually Damle and Fatelal were keen on helping him as he was the son of Anandrao, from whom they had learnt so many things. They called him to work in Prabhat. He did all jobs,including assisting in cinematography and direction.\n\nHis first break came when he was 33 year old. He got an opportunity to direct Prabhat’s film ” Gokul”-46 and later on ” Seedha Raasta”-47. After V.Shantaram had left Prabhat to start his own Rajkamal,Vasnt painter remained in Prabhat loyally, so he got the reward. Prabhat decided to make the film “Namdev” and Vasant was selected as a director. The cast was fixed and other arrangements done, but due to financial reasons the film was cancelled. Anyway, he got another opportunity. Actress Kamala Kotnis had floated a production company,Kamala Chitra Ltd..She invited Painter to direct her film,’Sati Ahilya’-49. Snehal Bhatkar was the MD.\n\nPainter directed ‘ Bhishma Pratidnya ‘-1950. This was,probably, the only Mythological film Nargis had acted in, with Shahu Modak. His other films were, Murliwala-51, Devyani-52, Sajni-56, Patit paawan-55, Gokul ka chor-59, Pyar ki jeet-62 . Meanwhile he was producing and directing several Marathi films too. He won 9 awards,including the prestigious ” V.Shantaram Award”.\n\nVasant Painter died on 31-5-2006,leaving behind him 6 daughters and 1 son.\n\nThe cast of this film was very interesting. There was Sulochana (Latkar) and Sulochana (Chaterjee), Baby Uma and Uma Devi, a couple – Sapru and Hemavati and a sibling pair of Jeevan and Dar Kashmiri. There was also an old time Silent film hero Ganpat rao Bakre and an old time singer actor Parshuram. Baby Naaz (later a heroine in few B and C grade films and a Dubbing artiste for actress Sridevi’s initial films) as well as Master Vinod Kumar (later Hero Vinod Mehra). The producer of this film was Hemavati.\n\nHemavati. Hardly anyone knows who this actress was. She had done an important role of Mohini-the Club Dancer,a time pass love of Ashok kumar in the film-Sangram-50. Normal sources will not give any information on Hemavati,but for our readers,here is some information on her. Hemavati was a Marathi actress and an active worker of I.P.T.A. in Bombay.She was also a regular actress of Prithvi Theatres and had acted as the Heroine of Raj kapoor in the drama ‘Deevar’.\n\nAt IPTA, she met actor aspirant D K Sapru and they fell in love with each other. They got married in 1948. By that time she had acted in ‘Ghar ghar ki kahani’-47 with Nayampally,Jail Yatra-47,with Raj Kapoor,Mohan-47,with Dev Anand and a few other films.\n\nAfter marriage, she completed Sangram-50, with Ashok Kumar and stopped working in films to raise a family. She had 3 children. Preeti Saproo became a Punjabi film actress. Tej Sapru acted in Hindi films and TV. Reema married Rakeshnath and became a successful screenplay writer of popular films.\n\nHemavati’s last film,however, was “Patit Pawan”-55,which she also produced for her husband. She died on 10-4-2005.\n\nNow let us have a look at the film’s story……\n\nThe story of the film was built around Dama Shetty,who lived happily in a village with his wife Guniya,son Nama and daughter in law Raji. His son was married in his childhood only. Dama shetty was a very pious and good person who helped the needy. He was respected in nearby villages too. However Nama was opposite to him. He only played all day and never believed in God. Dama used to scold him so that he would improve. Instead,one day Nama ran away to the jungle to avoid father’s admonishments every day. He was found by a dacoit’s gang. Many years passed and now Nama was a famous and dreaded Dacoit. His wife was hoping that someday Nama would come back.\n\nOne day Raji came across Nama the dacoit. By now Dama Shetty had died. She told her about father’s death and gave him a lot of advice to give up bad life and worship God. Nama’s mind changed and he decided to reform himself. He felt that he was the cause of father’s death. Nama gave up everything and started worshipping God.However the village purohit Parshuram Bhagwat did not believe him and banned his entry into the temple. Nama stayed outside and prayed. That year there was a terrible famine in the area. Nama decided to ask God’s help by fasting and he started his jaap and fasted till he almost became a dying person.\n\nSeeing his devotion God was pleased and it started raining heavily. Soon the villages prospered again and Nama the Patit (the fallen one) became Paawan (purified).\n\nToday’s song is sung by Mohd. Rafi and Lata Mangeshkar.\n\nSong-Jiski laagi lagan Bhagwaan mein (Patit Paawan)(1955) Singers- Mohd.
