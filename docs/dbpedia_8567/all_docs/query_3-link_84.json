While one one hand, the freedom fighters had the independence struggle figured out , men like Hari Das haven't a clue how to deal with the situation in a nation they had fought hard to win back. The irony of the proceedings makes for black comedy, heart wrenching drama and a shocking denouement where even the toughest of freedom fighters return disillusioned.\n\nAbout the Director: Ananth Mahadevan is a screenwriter, actor and director of Hindi, Marathi films and television serials in India.
