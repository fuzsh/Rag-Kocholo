        "text": "One by Two : Urban Diaries\n\nOne by Two has two parallel stories running side by side (many times literally shown by split screen). Amit Sharma (Abhay Deol) who works as a project manager in an IT company. He is recently dumped by his girl friend Radhika (Geetika Tyagi) who moves on in life with her new boy friend Ranjan Sadanah (Diwakar Pundir), who is a dance reality show producer. But Amit does not move on and wants Rahika back in his life. Amits’s colleagues and friends Anika (Preetika Chawla) and Mihir (Tahir Bhasin) always try to get him out of this idea.\n\nIn parallel happens the story of Samara Patel (Preeti Desai). She is a western dancer who is in casual relationship with her dance group leader Jonathan (Yudhishtir Urs). She too breaks up with him when he ditches her as lead dancer of the group and selects someone else. She lives with her mother Kalpana (Lillete Dubey) who is an alcoholic and needs Samara to take care of her. However, after Samara lives the dance group and decides to participate in Dance Reality show “Dance Wars”, Kalpana keeps her motivated.\n\nWhen Amit knows that his ex Girlfriend Radhika’s boyfriend Ranjan is producer of “Dance Wars”, he makes a plan to hack into the voting system of the show and rig the results to make deserving candidates losers and vice versa. By doing this he wants to reduce the TRP of the show which can result is getting Ranjan hacked. He thinks this way Radhika can come back to his life.\n\nAmit hacks the system with his friends and due to that Samara, who is supposed to win, looses the show. Show TRP decline and Amit succeeds in getting Ranjan out of the show. However, Radhika rejects him again saying he is the most boring person she has ever meet. However, she herself comes back to him to accept her after he becomes famous due to a coincidence.\n\nWhat that coincidence is? How Amit becomes famous? What happens Samara? Do they ever meet? You can know all this when you watch the movie. The question is, shall we watch it?\n\nThis story and screenplay by Devika Bhagat is like urban diaries of 2 different persons who live in a city and happen to cross each others life many times without actually knowing it. The screenplay has many sub plots like that of Amit’s Mother Meenu (Rati Aghnihotri) trying to get him married with a plum Shishika (Yashika Dhillon), Samara’s father’s (Anish Trivedi) behaviour with her mother. Then that of a B Boying Dancer Bunty (Netrapal He-Ra Singh) who meets Samara on Dance Wars and that of Amit’s poet uncle ACP Dhawan (Darshan Jariwala), etc. These sub plots does not help take the story forward. The main stories strictly run parallel and the lead actors do not actually meet each other for a lot longer bit that you would expect. So we can only assume that Devika only wanted to show urban diaries of two people. The film has an open ending or scope of sequel (which shall not be made). Devika has also written the dialogs with Manoj Tapadia, which does to help in the film anyways.\n\nDevika again takes the mantle as Director of the film and do not show much potential here too. Rather than the main story, Devika somewhat succeeds in portraying the relationships of Amit and his friends, Amit and his mother, Amit and his Uncle, Amit and his arranged marriage would be bride, etc. Barring that the movie is a drag and convoluted tale of urban people which is not narrated in an entertaining manner. Editor Shan Mohammed despite excelling in technically weaving the two stories together, could not save the film as the writer and Director was unsure of what she wanted to say.\n\nCinematography by Sameer Arya is glossy and glamourous. Production Design by Mustafa Stationwala is good. I must applaud the attention to detail in using ubuntu desktop on the computer screens (considering Amit manages forums and is a hacker). Music by Shankar Ehsaan Loy is average without any chartbusters. Choreography by Ashley Lobo is frustratingly bad considering dance and dance acts form major portion of the film. It is a total lost chance in that department.\n\nThe best part in the film is brilliant performances by the supporting cast like Rati Agnihotri, Darshan Jariwala, Lillete Dubey, Yashika Dhillon, Tahir Bhasin and Preetika Chawala. Abhay Deol’s earnest effort could not salvage the film as he does not get to show any other expression than boredom in most part of the film (which is induced in the audience too). Preeti Desai as Samara does not impress at all. She is said to be trained dancer but does not get to show her skills due to shoddy choreography. Overall casting by Panchami Ghavri is a hit and miss case. Great example of Miss case is B Boy Netrapal He-Ra Singh as Bunty.\n\nOverall it is a yawn inducing movie which makes us “pakawoed” like Abhay Deol is in the movie.\n\nRating :\n\nRecommendation : If you want to sleep, why to buy ticket and go to theatre. SKIP!\n\nOne by Two : Movie Review by Prashen H. Kyawal\n\n↧\n\n↧\n\nHasee Toh Phasee : Movie Review by Prashen H. Kyawal\n\nNagpur Today : Nagpur News\n\nHasee Toh Phasee : Quirky and Weird Fun\n\nDirector: Vinil Mathew\n\nScreenplay: Vinil Mathew\n\nProducers: Vikas Bahl, Hiroo Johar, Anurag Kashyap, Karan Johar\n\nCast : Parineeti Chopra , Sidharth Malhotra, Nikhil Bharadwaj, Adah Sharma\n\nThese are exciting times in Hindi Film Industry. While formula films (mostly remakes of South Indian Films) are making moolah at the box office, small budget offbeat films or films with unusual characters are also doing good business. This is not only leading to new combinations of lead pairs but also forcing people from different schools of film making come together to make films which can satisfy the new age audience. Be it a Rowdy Rathore produced by Sanjay Leela Bhansali or this movie in review today which is produced by people with diverse sensibilities like Anurag Kashyap, Vikramaditya Motwane and the mainstream hit machine Karan Johar, such strange joint ventures are being successful.\n\nHasee Toh Phasee brings together so different producers as it is film with main stream romantic comedy genre with characters and treatment of non-mainstream movies. It does have the Love-Engagement-Marriage time duration at the backdrop like every Karan Johar movie but it is sans the grandeur and razzmatazz which Dharma Production is famous for. It also have quirky characters like Anurag Kashyap movies. So it will be interesting to see how box office responds to such a mix.\n\nThe story is about 2 unique individuals in two different families. Individuals who are like square pegs in round holes. They do not fit in the usual format and formula of their families. Meeta (Pariniti Chopra) is a genius and rebellious girl who is condemned by her extended family except her father for not being the usual Indian girl type material. Similarly Nikhil (Sidharth Malhotra) is a similar boy who does not fit in formula of his IAS, IPS and IRS aspirant family. He is caring, committed and hard working but just does not know what he wants to do. At a her elder sister’s marriage ceremony, Nikhil meets Meeta while she is running away from home. Though through they strike chord with each other, Meeta runs away and at the same ceremony Nikhil falls in love with her another sister Karishma (Adah Sharma).\n\nAfter 7 years, Karishma and Nikhil get engaged but she puts a condition in front of Nikhil that he must start a business and get a big contract before their marriage day. To get that contract, Nikhil requires 5 Crores. Meanwhile, Meeta also gets back but as she is ousted by her family, Karishma can not take her home. So she entrusts Nikhil to take care of Meeta’s stay. In this process, Nikhil gets entangled in the complicated maze in which Meeta lives. While he suffers every time he helps her, he enjoys taking care of her and both realise that they are made for each other. What happens next is a fun story with whacky but lovable characters.\n\nThe scenarios of lead pairs falling in love while being in the process of marrying someone else they used to love has been played several times on Indian screen in last 15-17 years. The trend was started by SRK’s movies in which he inevitably happened to love girls who are in love with someone else or getting married to someone else. Then Imtiyaz Ali also has expertise in making his characters go through such mess. However, what makes Hasee to Phasee endearing is the treatment and characterisation.\n\nStory and Screenplay of the film is credited to Harshvardhan Kulkarni. The screenplay and characterisation has many unique and out of the box situations, but still the cohesive mix is not that complete. Harshwardhan Kulkari has also written the dialogs along with Anurag Kashyap, Purva Naresh and Director Vinil Matthew. Dialogs are witty and funny and successful in keeping the smile on your face throughout the film.\n\nDirector Vinil Matthew does impress in his debut film. With his editor Shweta Venkat, he is able to keep good pace and commendable that the movies is of breezy 140 min duration. Still many times, it feels the story isn’t moving forward. Barring few such glitches, he has done a good debut. He has handled the situations well and extracted good performances from the ensemble cast.\n\nSometimes people strive for their whole life to get a break in movies. Often, artists keep working hard to polish their skills. And then there are some chosen ones who has talent as a God gift and are picked from wherever they are to be in movies. Pariniti Chopra is such a God gifted talent who was focused and happy in her studies and then career, but destiny picked her and landed her a 3 film deal with India’s top production house, Yash Raj Films.\n\nThis film belongs to Pariniti and she impresses with the display of twin personalities the character has. One quirky, perky, whacky, weird but gullible Meeta after having medical pills. Another of a wise, honest and caring person that she is originally when not on medicine. She can’t control her bladder, she steals sweats and tooth pastes, she makes intimidating and scary faces and she also makes us believe that she can be the intelligent and genius scientist obsessed by her passion for research. She absolutely enthrals audience with her range of acting and this is her by far the best performance. After this movie, she can not go unnoticed. This movie will open up the world for her for more powerful women centric films.\n\nSiddharth Malhotra ably supports Parinita with his controlled demeanour and committed lover act. However, that’s about it. Other actors which leave an impression are Manoj Joshi (Meeta’s Dad) and Sharat Saxena (Nikhil’s Dad). Adah Sharma does decent job too. Another actor I would like to mention is the one who plays the Indian Idol aspirant Annu Malik fan. He has a good amount of screen time and does full justice to it.\n\nMusic of the film is good with the song ‘Zehnaseeb’ having a longer shelf life. ‘Drama queen’ and ‘Punjabi wedding song’ are flavour of the season. I like the hook line of ‘Sheke it like Shammi’ too. Remo D’souza, Bosco-Caesar and Ahmed Khan is apt but nothing to take home there. Cinematography by Sanu Varughese is pleasant. He has succeeded in not making the film too glossy and keep it somewhat real to protect the soul of the film.\n\nProduction values are top notch though Karan may have had to control himself to not go beyond the story premise and make the film grand and larger than life. It makes better business sense too.\n\nOverall, it is a fun and clean film after many days which you can watch with whole family.\n\nRecommendation : This should be your bet this weekend if you like popcorn entertainment. Nothing great but a decent and fun time pass.\n\nShow Time :\n\nCinemax Eternity Mall – eternity mall, variety square, sitabudi, Nagpur\n\n9:30‎ – ‎11:00am‎ – ‎12:30‎ – ‎1:15‎ – ‎2:00‎ – ‎3:30‎ – ‎5:00‎ – ‎6:30‎ …Pvr Empress City Mall – empress city mall, opposite raman science centre gandhi sagar lake, Nagpur\n\n‎9:30‎ – ‎10:25am‎ – ‎12:30‎ – ‎1:30‎ – ‎3:00‎ – ‎3:30‎ – ‎4:30‎ – ‎6:30‎ …Smruti Cinema Nagpur – residency road sadar, nagpur, Nagpur\n\n‎12:30‎ – ‎3:30‎ – ‎6:30‎ – ‎9:25pm‎Jaya Shree – near lohapool, cotton market, subhash road, Nagpur\n\n‎12:30‎ – ‎3:30‎ – ‎6:30‎ – ‎9:30pm‎Inox Tuli Mall – kamptee road, nagpur, Nagpur\n\n‎9:50‎ – ‎11:15am‎ – ‎12:45‎ – ‎2:00‎ – ‎3:40‎ – ‎4:50‎ – ‎6:35‎ – ‎7:40‎ …\n\nHasee Toh Phasee : Movie Review by Prashen H. Kyawal\n\n↧\n\nGunday : Movie Review by Prashen H. Kyawal\n\nNagpur Today : Nagpur News\n\nGunday : Bollywood Masala Fry\n\nDirector: Ali Abbas Zafar\n\nMusic composed by: Sohail Sen\n\nProduction company: Yash Raj Films\n\nCast: Priyanka Chopra, Ranveer Singh,Arjun Kapoor\n\nIn search of angry young man or the typical macho hero, Bollywood is exploring lawless belt of the country (UP, Bihar) for stories of Police officers (Dubangg, Rowdy Rathor), Thief and Gangsters (Rowdy Rathor, Bullet Raja, Boss) and travelling back in time (Once upon a Time in Mumbai, Shootout at Wadala). While doing so they are educating audience on illegal drug trade, smuggling, gun trade, etc. Another illegal trade was brought to forth by Anurag Kashyap in Gangs of Wasseypur though it can not be called a typical Bollywood masala film. Ali Abbas Zafar seems to be inspired from it and used this illegal coal business backdrop and back in time retro formula while writing this week’s release “Gunday”\n\nGunday is a story of 2 kids, Bikram (master Darshan Gujar) and Bala (master Jayesh Kardak), who were orphaned during Bangladesh war. They face a lot of atrocities in relief camp there. So they run to Culcutta hiding in a coal wagon or railway. After trying to make an honest living by working hard at small restaurants, they’re forced to fight for their rights and snatch it. They do it by stealing coal from railway wagons. In few years, as they grow up, Bikram (Ranveer Singh) and Bala (Arjun Kapoor) build their empire by having presence in all business through their muscle power and become kings of Calcutta.\n\nA big twist in their life comes after government bestows ACP Satyajit Sarkar (Irrfan Khan), the responsibility of cleaning Calcutta from the menace of Bikram and Bala. He warns them about being under his vigilance always and advises them to refrain from any illegal activities. Second twist, but somewhat beautiful, comes in the life of these two goons in the name of Nandita (Priyanka Chopra), a cabaret dancer. They both fall in love with her and agree to try and woo her one by one alternatively. They agree that they will be ok with whoever Nandita chooses as her lover. What happens next is the story which has more twists and turns topped with lots of Drama and action.\n\nAli Abbas Zafar is credited for Story, Screenplay, Dialogs and Direction. So it is a one man show on the story telling part of the movie. He has used all the formulas and cliches but tried to present them in a gripping manner with a big canvas. He gets us intrigued in the story telling and keeps us hooked by the characterisation and performances he extracted from his lead cast. However, this grip is lost few times throughout the movie and you can find yourself checking your cellphone notifications. Another issue which hurts this movie is lack of a strong villain and interesting peripheral characters. Due to this, you feel like you are watching a 3-4 character movie while the canvas is that of a big budget multi-starrer. This makes us feel suffocated like we are in a coal mine. There are many such loopholes in the screenplay which mars the whole experience. But still, Ali Abbas Zafar makes up for it via stylish presentation and few good dialogs.\n\nAli Abbas Zafar must be praised for the way he has raised questions over the system which gives birth to such Goons without being preachy. He has 2-3 directors shots in the movie like the flying of pigeon when Bikram and Bala fights, and the empty train at the end, etc. He sure has good potential and we can expect better products from him in future.\n\nEditor Rameshwar S. Bhagat must be applauded for handling so much content effectively. Cinematography by Aseem Mishra gives it the larger than life as well as the retro feel as per the demand of the script. Production Designer Rajat Poddar with Art Director Kailash Sahu has been given free hand by Yash Raj Films and he has done justice the freedom by giving high quality output. However, the dummy train in few scenes is looks DUMMY. And the scene when Arjun Kapoor Blows a warehouse has not come out well.\n\nCostume Design by Subarna Ray Chaudhari also stands out and we can not forget the outfit with red heart shaped mark on it. It adds to the outwardly and raucous behaviour by the illiterate heroes. Stunts by Sham Kaushal are good but could’ve been better. Music by Sohail Sen is average barring ‘Tune maari entriyaan’ and will be soon forgotten.\n\nCasting Director Shanoo Sharma again hit bulls eye in casting of this movie. The child actors who played Bikram (master Darshan Gujar) and Bala (master Jayesh Kardak) done a marvelous job. Pankaj Tripathi in a small role of Lateef who gets these kids in the world of crime made an impression. Jameel Khan (as Satyajit Sarkar’s colleague) did not get much scope, but Anant Sharma (as Himanshu) makes his presence felt. Again the problem is none of the peripheral characters are explored fully which could’ve improved this movie a lot.\n\nHighlight of this movie is performances by its lead cast i.e. Ranveer Singh, Arjun Kapoor, Priyanka Chopra and Irrfan Khan. While Ranveer and Priyanka steals the show, Arjun Kapoor equally does good. While Irrfan Khan does is best, he is not backed by the writer properly. Ranveer infuses energy on the screen and Priyanka oozes glamour every time she is there. The chemistry between Ranveer-Arjun, Ranveer-Priyanka, Arjun-Priyanka and between all 3 is outstanding.\n\nOverall, “Gunday” is a good masala movie with good performances and larger than life story telling. It is a clean film and can be watched with family and kids.\n\nRecommendation: The day you watch “Gunday” will be a good day. Do watch it.\n\nShow timing :\n\nSmruti Cinema Nagpur – residency road sadar, nagpur, Nagpur, India\n\n‎12:30‎ – ‎3:30‎ – ‎6:30‎ – ‎9:25pm‎\n\nPvr Empress City Mall – empress city mall, opposite raman science centre gandhi sagar lake, Nagpur, India\n\n‎3:10‎ – ‎4:10‎ – ‎5:20‎ – ‎6:20‎ – ‎7:20‎ – ‎8:30‎ – ‎9:30‎ – ‎10:30pm‎\n\nCinemax Eternity Mall – eternity mall, variety square, sitabudi, Nagpur, India\n\n‎10:15am‎ – ‎12:10‎ – ‎1:25‎ – ‎3:20‎ – ‎6:30‎ – ‎7:35‎ – ‎9:40‎ – ‎10:45pm‎\n\nJaya Shree – near lohapool, cotton market, subhash road, Nagpur, India\n\n‎12:30‎ – ‎3:30‎ – ‎6:30‎ – ‎9:30pm‎\n\nRajvilas Cinema – nagpur mahal, Nagpur, India\n\n‎12:30‎ – ‎3:30‎ – ‎6:30‎ – ‎9:30pm‎\n\nPanch Sheel – wardha road, Nagpur, India\n\n‎12:30‎ – ‎3:30‎ – ‎6:30‎ – ‎9:30pm‎\n\nInox Tuli Mall – kamptee road, nagpur, Nagpur, India\n\n‎1:00‎ – ‎2:25‎ – ‎3:10‎ – ‎4:05‎ – ‎6:15‎ – ‎7:10‎ – ‎9:20‎ – ‎10:15pm‎\n\nInox Poonam Mall – poonam mall, Nagpur, India\n\n‎1:00‎ – ‎3:10‎ – ‎4:05‎ – ‎6:15‎ – ‎7:10‎ – ‎8:30‎ – ‎9:20‎ – ‎10:15pm‎\n\nGunday : Movie Review by Prashen H. Kyawal\n\n↧\n\nHighway : Movie Review by Prashen H. Kyawal\n\nNagpur Today : Nagpur News\n\nHighway : A road less traveled\n\nStar Cast: Alia Bhatt, Randeep Hooda\n\nDirector: Imtiaz Ali\n\nImtiyaz Ali is one of the most important directors in today’s Hindi Film Industry. His incredible success in recent past has created a fan follower which expects mushy love stories with melodious songs from him. With his humble beginning from “Socha Na Tha” which launched Abhay Deol, Imtiyaz tasted success in his second film “Jab We Met” which helped Kareena Kapoor to erase “POO” from public’s memory and replace it with “Geet”. Imtiyaz’s formula of new age romance with the protagonists being confused about whether they are in love or not continued with his subsequent movies “Love Aaj Kal” and “Rockstar” (though Rockstar had a huge canvas apart from that). Another element of his movies is journey. The characters are either on run or in a journey in most part of the movie. In his new movie “Highway”, these 2 elements are still there. It is an unusual love story as well as it has a lot of travel across length and breadth of north India.\n\nImtiyaz Ali is credited for Story, Screenplay, Dialogues and Direction of “Highway”. As per his interview this story has been with him since 12 years when he made half hour episode for a television serial “Rishtey” in 1999. He thought of many ways of telling this story considering it via multiple genres including big action film. Finally, Imtiyaz settled on telling this story sans anything else and stuck to the journey of his protagonists and finding themselves on the way. It’s a coming-of-age movie.\n\nThe story is based on a thin premise that a girl who is kidnapped finds freedom in the captivity. Veera Tripathi (Alia Bhat) is city girl from very influential and rich family who has never been real open world. Even their travels, the family stays in hotels only. Veera has a craving for the road and open air. She insists her fiancée for a long drive on which she gets kidnapped by Mahabir Bhati (Randeep Hooda). But she feels free in this captivity and eventually falls in love with him. The story is not about what happens next but how things happen and the overall experience the Director creates for us.\n\nThe story is interesting and but screenplay could have been better. Though the movie keeps the audience interested, it does not entertain them per say. Few more scenes of cameraderie and fun on the way could have solved that purpose. Even a little more details of Mahabir’s backstory could have provided the much needed drama.\n\nThough the screenplay lacks in happening and entertaining content, Director Imtiyaz Ali makes up for it by the experience he creates for the audience. The film moves across 6 states, many unseen locations and breath taking landscapes. With his cinematographer Anil Mehta, Imtiyaz takes us through a journey unforgettable. While doing so, he also makes a strong statement on all that is wrong in the society without even showing any of that visually. All trough the movie, he makes us think how far we have came away from the beautiful world that has been created for us by the All-mighty. He not shows how cut off we are from real world out of the city but also gives hint of how the side effects of civilisation is creating a rich-poor divide which is giving birth to many oppressors. It also throws light on how even the well heeled too are suffocated under the pretence of today’s society and how there are dangerous criminals hidden within regular public. Take a bow Mr. Director for this.\n\nA. R. Rahman and Imitiyaz Ali created magic in “Rockstar” which raised the expectations about this film’s music a lot. Though the music is good, the Rahman-Imtiyaz Ali combo fails to give multiple hit songs. Also, as the film has less things happening on screen, lack of many good songs is felt drastically. This is the second part where film is lacking.\n\nPerformance wise this is an Alia Bhat film all the way. She breathe the character and brings it alive on screen. Randeep Hooda impresses with his top notch performance too. However he gets very little significant to do than watch Alia from distance. Other actors playing roles of Aadoo (Durgesh Kumar), Tonk (Pradeep Nagar), Goru (Saharsha Kumar Shukla) does perfect justice to their job.\n\nOverall, “Highway” is a very well made and very important film of our era. It shall be India’s entry to Oscars this year.\n\nRating and Recommendation:\n\n“Highway” is a complicated film to review. It’s hard to rate. Rather it shall not be rated because it is not just a film but is an experience. It needs to be experienced and felt. And if I may say, only a few can feel it. So everyone who look for quality cinema which is unique and different, do go for this movie.\n\nHighway : Movie Review by Prashen H. Kyawal\n\n↧\n\nDhoom 3 : Movie Review by Prashen H. Kyawal\n\nMy CMS\n\nDhoom 3 : Prestigious Dhoom\n\nCast :Aamir Khan (Sahir), Katrina Kaif (Aaliya), Abhishek Bachchan (ACP Jai Dixit) ,Uday Chopra (Ali Akbar Fateh Khan), Tabrett Bethell\n\nDirector: Vijay Krishna Acharya\n\nMusic composed by: Pritam Chakraborty\n\nProducer: Aditya Chopra\n\nCinematography: Sudeep Chatterjee\n\nDhoom is most successful movie series in India and Dhoom 3 is most awaited film of 2013. Dhoom series has a great unique format where the villain is bigger than heroes. Where the villain is the main attraction of the movie. I am not sure if there is any other such mainstream commercial movie series with such format. Even if Abhishek Bachchan can claim any number of times that Dhoom series is chronicles of Jai and Ali and they are the heroes of the movie, people throng the theatres to watch the villain.\n\nDhoom 1 was sort of kinder to Abhishek Bachchan and Uday Chopra as they got equal footage too John Abraham’s character which was more popular because it was author backed. With Dhoom 2 having Hrithik Roshan and Aishwarya Rai as thieves the game became tougher. Hrithik took the movie to an unprecedented level which seem hard to be break into. He completely shadowed Jai and Ali whose roles got smaller. AB Junior intact got a lot of flak at that time for looking lethargic and somewhat fat in front of Hrithik.\n\nThis time, with Amir Khan playing the thief, the film gets as bigger as it can get. Amir Khan, knowns as the perfectionist of Hindi Film Industry, is known for his sense of script. This time, though heavily “inspired” from hollywood flick “The Prestige”, the screenplay by Vijay Krishna Acharya is good and hence Amir must have accepted the film. He is credited as Victor Acharya for this movie (is victor the alter ego of Vijay?).\n\nVijay is associated with Dhoom series from start. He is the writer behind all Dhoom movies. Dhoom 3 is a totally focused screenplay which is centred around the story of the thief. Hence, Jai and Ali gets much lesser roles. In fact, it also chucks away typical romantic track even after having lead actress like Katrina Kaif. Though it does make the movie taught, it also makes it dry as it lacks in comic and romantic entertainment. The script has good twists and turns. Vijay is also credited for dialogues which are apt.\n\nVijay Krishna Acharya gets credited with same name as Director. His much hyped Tashan fall flat at the box office but he did show some spark for style and action. With Dhoom 3, he gets already successful formula which has lot of scope for both. Being on home ground and supported with best technicians and star cast, he does his job remarkably. With the help of his editor Ritesh Soni, he keeps the pace of the movie fast and keeps audience hooked to the story. The way he delivers the twists in the movie is remarkable. He is extremely successful in presenting the story of the thief but fails in making Jai and Ali track work for it. In fact, he keeps very less chance for romance too (as it is the demand of the script too). If he could have some how managed to boast those areas too, it would have been a complete entertainer. Still a big round of applause to live unto the stupendous expectations from the movie.\n\nDhoom 3 is blessed with A list start cast and supporting actors. Most screen time is dedicated to Amir Khan (as Sahir) and he proves that he is the BEST. Though he lacks in physical presentation of the character (as compared to Hrithik or even John), he makes for it by his incredible acting talent. He is successful in impressing the audience again. Abhishek Bachchan (as Jai) is as his usual self. Uday Chopra (as Ali) does not have much scope due to very less screen time and no support from writer this time. We do not even remember him after the movie. Katrina Kaif is at her best form but is wasted again due to very less screen time. But she is best in whatever screen time she gets. I wish she had more meaty role. Jackie Shroff impresses in his small role. Tabrett Bethell who is Chicago police woman is a mis cast. She has ample screen time which is wasted.\n\nSpecial mention for the child artist Siddharth Nigam who comes second or as close to Amir Khan. He must get all the awards for child actor for this year. What a heart warming performance by him. He is a kid to watch for.\n\nProduction by Aditya Chopra is of international standard and Cinematographer Sudeep Chatterjee takes full advantage of it and delivers stunning visuals. Action by Conrad Palmisano and Sham Kaushal is top notch. Music by Pritam Chakraborty and Julius Packiam lacks good songs which can last. Aditya Chopra lacks the ear for music which his father Yashiji had. He needs to hire Mahesh Bhat for this department. Choreography by Vaibhavi Merchant and Dien Perry is good. Katrina sizzles in her dances like liquid electricity (as described in the movie itself).\n\nHow can one talk about Dhoom without talking about bikes? I saved this best bit for last. Amir Khan gets a better bike than bat pod which is a convertible to many useful functions other than just being a bike. Do lookout for it. I would have loved Jai and Ali playing more with their bikes too however they just get to ride them (Don’t know why Jai gets an entry with Auto)\n\nIn summary, Dhoom 3 delivers the promise and is a good family entertainment for this weekend. There can not be a better film to end the year. Go end it with DHOOM.\n\nRecommendation : Watch it for Amir, his bike and for everything Dhoom stands for. Do not forget to suspend your belief before entering the cinema hall. And yes, this movie can be watched with whole family (which is hard to say about most movies coming now a days)\n\nAlso, do watch hollywood movie “The Prestige” on DVD after you watch this movie any time you can. It is a movie which must not be missed.\n\nDhoom 3 : Movie Review by Prashen H. Kyawal\n\n↧\n\n↧\n\nCalling Mr. Joe B Carvalho : Movie Review by Prashen H. Kyawal\n\nMy CMS\n\nCalling Mr. Joe B Carvalho : Cartoon Physics\n\nThey say rightfully that “Public sab janti hai”. When I entered the multiplex parking for the morning show, there was almost no vehicles parked. When I entered the cinema hall, I was only 1 person joined by another soon. Later it turned out that we both are film reviewers and thus the auditorium technically has no real audience who come just to watch the movie.\n\nFor me Arshad Warsi and Javed Jaffrey are actors with great comic timing and I will always have good feeling about any film which have both in it. However, I do not know what made them sign this project written by Arshad Sayyad and Directed by Samir Tewari.\n\nThe film is a supposed to be a spoof on detective movies. However, even a spoof needs a plot line. And obviously this film does not have it. International criminal Carlos (Javed Jaffrey) is hired by General Kopa Kabana (Snehal Dabi) to stop the marriage of his love interest Gehna (Geeta Basra). At the same time Detective Joe B. Carvalho (a pun intended to sound like Jo bhi karvalo) is hired by Khurana (Shakti Kapoor) to get his daughter Neena (Karishma Kotak) back home who ran away with Ramlal. M. K. (Vijay Raaz) who is unhappy to not get the supari by Kopa Kabana is eager to kill Carlos. However, due to some situations, Joe is considered to be Carlos. Then the film is supposed to be comedy of errors but fails in execution. There is also a love track between Joe and Shantipriya (Soha Ali Khan) who is an inspector on duty to catch Carlos.\n\nDirector Samir Tewari tries to improvise the scenes with hot shot style humour. The characters do something or other which affects some other part of the scene unintentionally to cause laughter. Or the characters have cartoon style physics where they fall, shrink, fly, etc like in Tom & Jerry. I do had laughs at few ones however most fail even to move any smile muscle. The movie has content enough for 30-50 min film which is stretched to a feature length.\n\nOn performance side, Arshad Warsi is wasted. Javed Jaffrey does his work honestly but do not get enough traction later in the story. Soha Ali Khan is ineffective. Likewise Joe, she can’t seduce audience also. Vijay Raz, Shakti Kapoor, Ranjit are as usual. Geeta Basra and Karishma are sidekick eye candy.\n\nTechnically the film is adequate.\n\nOverall, there is nothing you take home at then end of the movie.\n\nRecommendation :Public already knows that they need to skip this movie. So keep it that way. Maybe you can revisit “Sholey” in 2D or 3D as per your choice. That will be better choice for this weekend.\n\nCalling Mr. Joe B Carvalho : Movie Review by Prashen H. Kyawal\n\n↧\n\nYaariyan : Movie Review by Prashen H. Kyawal\n\nMy CMS\n\nYaariyan : The Kiss Quest\n\nYouth is biggest consumer in India. Age of this nation is reducing day by day. A large number of youngsters are below 20. Also many in their teenage are forming major chunk of population. It is evident from the teenage crowd flocking to the theatres that there’s a good market for teenage flicks if released professionally. With the muscle of T-series behind it, Yaariyan did succeed in creation of pre-release buzz for the movie. With the help of chart buster music, it is successful in getting its audience to the theatre.\n\nA good movie needs great marketing to get the theatre seats filled initially but it is the content of the movie which keeps it filled for 1-2 weeks which actually helps in doing good business. It will be interesting to see if Yaariyan is able to achieve it over coming days because it has very less to offer and that to for a niche section i.e. teenagers. If this movie still does great business, then we can conclude that the teenage market is worth targeting (perhaps with better content) in future.\n\nYaariyan focuses on teenage “hormonal locha” which the makers think keeps them on the hunt for physical pleasures from the opposite sex. As the lead male character Lakshya (Himansh Kohli) is in quest for kissing his current girlfriend Jenny (Serah Singh), he and his group gets punished (?) to protect the college from being take over by the australians. Is it sounding as weird while reading as it is to me while writing? The principal of the collage, Jimmy sir (Gulshan Grover) gives even more absurd justification for his choice. So this group of good for nothings fight for the cause with multiple sources of motivation by mother (Smita Jaykar), Mausi (Deepti Naval), Friend Debu and girlfriend Saloni (Rakul Preet Singh) given time to time.\n\nCredit for Story, Screenplay and Direction is given to Divya Khosla Kumar who is family member of the producers. It is her debut film. She seems inspired by multiple teenage flicks and tried to pull best out of them and put in this movie to create a cocktail which unfortunately fails in taste. She brings in instances from real life like australians beating Indian student and also tries to flavour the recipe with patriotism. While doing all this, it is also a coming of age story where the reluctant protagonist realises the importance of being man of substance. However, the movie fails to be so.\n\nIt is said that there are very less female directors in film industry. When a female director wields megaphone, we expect female characters treated with more dignity than their male counterparts. However, from the first scene to the last, Divya never misses a chance to show cleavages from top angle and bikini clad legs from low angle. Apart from 3 glamour girls, Jenny (Serah Singh), Jannet (Evelyn Sharma) and Jiya (Necole Faria) as students who do not leave a chance to shed cloths, there are 2 female teachers. They are shown as flirty in a cheap way, dropping their saree pallu in every frame. If that’s supposed to be funny, I do not subscribe to that kind of humour. Sorry.\n\nTo give credit to Divya, the screenplay has few engaging moments, even if cliched or formulaic, at times it works. Also the film has difficult scenes like mounting biking, mountain climbing, etc which takes hard work in execution. So we can say it is a good debut by her as director. I doubt if we can expect any better from her in future.\n\nFilm is technically strong. It has a great cinematography by Sameer Arya. He shows Sikkim and Australia in its all natural beauty. Production value of the film is top notch. Editing by Parameswaran and Aarif Sheikh could have been better if they had made it more tighter and fluid. The biggest strong point on which this film relies is Music. Songs by Pritam, Mithoon, Yo Yo Honey Singh, Arko Pravo Mukherjee, are already busting the charts. With T-Series at the helm of the affairs, music has to be the best. And it is.\n\nThe film is a candy floss, coming of age, romantic musical in an imaginary college (in reality, it can’t exist) which works with teenage audience.\n\nRecommendation : Skip it unless you are a teenager with “hormonal loch”\n\nYaariyan : Movie Review by Prashen H. Kyawal\n\n↧\n\nDedh Ishqiya : Movie Review by Prashen H. Kyawal\n\nMy CMS\n\nDedh Ishqiya : Classy work in massy mix\n\nDirector: Abhishek Chaubey\n\nMusic composed by: Vishal Bharadwaj\n\nCostume design: Payal Saluja\n\nProducers: Raman Maroo, Vishal Bharadwaj\n\nCast : Madhuri Dixit (Shahi Begum), Huma Qureshi (Munira Aslam Zia), Arshad Warsi (Babban Hussain), Naseeruddin Shah (Khalujaan), Vijay Raaz (Jaan Mohammad)\n\nA movie shall make you positively wonder about the incredible talents of its makers. It shall spellbind you, transcend you beyond limitations of reality or just simply make you happy. Dedh Ishqiya is one such film….. you come out of theatre happily with satisfaction of watching a good movie. A feeling which can only match with the satisfaction one gets after reading a good book.\n\nVishal Bhardwaj’s name will be written in golden words in history of Indian Cinema. After his debut in the film industry as a music director in “Maachis”, Vishal is donning many hats and successfully worked as Director, Producer, Writer, Dialog Writer and of course Music Director. Not only that, his affection with literature and quality storytelling bring a different level of sense and sensibilities to Indian cinema. This versatile artist came out with “Ishqiya” in 2010 as Writer, Composer and Producer. Abhishek Chaubey directed the film for him. The same team has now brought to you the sequel “Dedh Ishqiya”. They promise that this film will be “dedh guna” better than earlier in every aspect.\n\nIn most my reviews, I have to complain about lack of story and bad screenplay. Thanks to the writer Darab Farooqui who came up with a brilliant Story for the loveable characters Khalujan (Naseeruddin Shah) and Babban (Arshad Warsi) in this sequel. Their story continues ahead from last film. They steal an expensive piece of jewellery but while being chased by police, they depart from each other. As the jewellery is with Khalujan, Babban goes post to pole to find him. Finally he sees him as an aspirant attending swayamwar of Begum Para (Madhuri Dixit). After little conflicts, Babban and Khalujan are reconciled. Major reason behind this is the newly Babban’s developed interest in Munia (Huma Qureshi) who is companion of the Begum.\n\nKhalu has Jaan Muhammad (Vijay Razz) as his main competitor in the swayamwar. He is also trying to woo the Begum with memorised shayari by Noor Mohammad Italvi (Manoj Pahwa) whom he kidnaps for this same purpose. What happens after this an interesting story with many twists and turns presented with humour.\n\nVishal Bhardwaj’s strong connect and love with literature is reaffirmed with this film. He either creates an adaptation or pays homage to some or other great literary work. A little research about this movie brought to my knowledge that it pays homage to a controversial short story “Lihaaf” written by Ismat Chugtai in 1941. There’s also a reference to it in a dialog using the word “Lihaaf”. Not only that he uses shayari of DR. Bashir Badr throughout all the mushayara scenes in the movie. So the film is definitely a lavish buffet of literary references and usage by Bhardwaj.\n\nAbhishek Chaubey and Vishal Bhardwaj’s Screenplay is taught and fluid. It’s not very fast but it matches with the tone and atmosphere of the movie. When a movie is strong on paper and in writing, it always shows on screen. It makes a huge difference in the movie watching experience. It’s like a perfectly cooked recipe by a known chef which we can savour with full confidence. With this delicious main course, witty dialogs by Vishal Bhardwaj serves like tangy, spicy side dishes. However, many may find the dialogs difficult to understand even though subtitles are given (I would have preferred subtitles in hindi).\n\nVishal Bhardwaj seats back and lets Abhishek Chaubey take the reins. And he does not disappoint. There are many moments in the movie where you can say it is a “Director’s Scene” which does not happen very often now a days. It is incredible the way he handles conflict sequences. Even in those situations, he fuses the tension and makes audience laugh. Another noticeable thing is he handles different tracks carefully and they all helps get the story forward in a natural flow. Vishal Bhardwaj always sets his film’s atmosphere in lawless hindi belt of the nation. Here, Abhishek Chaubey brings like the lukhnawi nawabiyat on screen. Being fully in control as the captain of the ship, he scores full marks.\n\nStill, the film is not as effective as the first one in terms of “kahani me twist”. May be because we know the format of the movie now, one can guess what is going to happen so the twists (barring one which takes the film in a different realm) are little less effective. Another front where it lacks than first movie is raw and zany sexuality. However, these are small things which does not mar the experience of the movie.\n\nOn the performances side, this film is a treat. With veterans like Naseeruddin Shah, diva like Madhuri Dixit , master of comic timing and dialogue delivery Arshad Warsi, powerful actor like Vijay Raaz on board, Dedh Ishqiya is like a demonstration of master acting. All these 4 actors give top notch performance. Madhuri is so gelled in the movie that she looks like she is living Begum Para. Watch out the scene where Muniya comes and hugs her from behind and Begum senses something different in her. The nuances shown by each actors are marvellous. Matching with these actors, others like Huma Qureshi, Manoj Pahwa, Salman Shahid (Mushtaq), Bhakti Deshpande (as young Begum Para), Fareed Ahmed (as Rafiq), Ravi Gossain (as Liyaqat), John Vijay (as the police officer), etc also deliver excellent work. Even unknown actors (notice the tailor and his hakim father) in small roles leave impression on audience. Honey Trehan must be applauded for his work as Casting Director. This is film deserves a full star for performances only.\n\nEditing by A. Shreekar Prasad is on the spot. Cinematography by Satyajit Pande along with Production design by Subrata Chakraborty and Amit Ray is successful in creating both the rustic rural atmosphere and falling nawabi ambience. It sets the mood of the films and transports the audience into the story. Music by Vishal Bhardwaj is not as good as earlier film still “Hamari Atariya Pe” is doing well in charts. In a Madhuri film, one can not skip a mention for choreography. Choreography by Pt. Birju Maharaj’s choreography in the ‘Jagaave saari raina’ song and Remo D’souza’s in the ‘Humri atariya’ is excellent.\n\nOn the whole, Dedh Ishqiya is a case where the sequel is better than first film. It is fine wine and delicate cuisine served finesse and style. It needs to be savoured in same way.\n\nRecommendation : Highly recommended for lovers of quality cinema who love nuanced performances, strong writing, intelligent direction and overall satisfaction of watching a good film. If you look for these kind of things in cinema, go for it. It’s humorous, entertaining and satiating otherwise too. Do watch this film.\n\nDedh Ishqiya : Movie Review by Prashen H.

Kyawal\n\nMy CMS\n\nMiss Lovely: Retrospective on C grade movie industry\n\nDirector: Ashim Ahluwalia\n\nStory by: Ashim Ahluwalia\n\nCast: Nawazuddin Siddiqui, Niharika Singh, Anil George\n\nScreenplay: Ashim Ahluwalia, Uttam Sirur\n\nThere is mainstream commercial cinema which seldom is good on all aspects. There is quality cinema which entertains or engages too. Then there’s a cinema reflects real life as is sans any dramatisation or spicing up. Such cinema is generally popular in art film lovers, film scholars and festival circuit regulars. Miss Lovely comes from that orbit. Generally such movies do not reach from their orbit to earth of mass release. But times have changed and all types of cinema is getting wider release. Though with a delay, this film got a release. It is a good sign but I am not sure if such movies can ever enjoy patronage like other types of cinema enjoy. That eventually makes it harder to get released.\n\nMiss Lovely is a story which brings to us the dark by-lanes of this shiny glamours film industry. It is about the C grade film industry of 80s. The audience of such films expected much more than titillation when they paid for their tickets based on their view developed from the posters and text lines on them in local ads by exhibitors. To keep them satisfied and hooked, such notorious exhibitors used to add after market reels of porn scenes into the movie. This way they guaranteed repeated and devoted audience and everyone in the supply chain is happy (the way, a character in this movie says “Maine kaha tha na, sabko khush kar dunga”). While theatre owners opted for such dubious ways to ensure business, investors were interested in easy access to sex it offered.\n\nStory of this film by Ashim Ahluwalia, is rumoured to be based on Ramsey Brothers. Though the film scene shown do resemble the films by Ramsey’s in that era, I do not think it is about their life experiences. Story is definitely has a different background and subject does offer novelty.\n\nThe story is about 2 brothers with elder one, Vicky (Anil George) being the alpha male going for hunt and having big ambitions. But for achieving those, he has not calms use any wrong methods. While enjoying the benefits of casting couch himself, he rubs shoulders with horny investors who are more interested in skin taste than screen test. Younger brother Sonu (Nawazuddin Siddiqui), who is reluctantly following orders by his brother with frequent protests which are ignored and crushed ferociously. Sonu is wants a cleaner life and dreams about directing a mainstream romantic film “Miss Lovely”. He falls in love with pinky (Niharika Singh) while dreaming to cast her as his heroine. To achieve this he follows some unscrupulous ways which lands not only him but the entire gang in trouble.\n\nScreen play credits are shared by Ashim Ahluwalia and Uttam Sirur. The screen play is on the line of the treatment planned for this movie. Even though it uniqueness does keep audience interested in what next, it does not keep them glued to the screen. It does not sweep us emotionally nor delivers the story with dash of entertainment. It it successful in affecting us but the emotion it generates is disgust. It does make you unstable but does not give the fulfilment of watching a good film. It also does not give reasons or proper flow so sometimes makes it harder to understand the ongoings. It does have few highs but lows are more and persistent. So a mixed job done on screenplay here.\n\nAshim Ahluwalia again in Directors chair, is clear about how he wants to treat the film. He goes about it without compromise and is able to recreate reality as is on screen. He uses lifelike pace and holds camera in many shots for a lot longer than normal. He is able to create the atmosphere with all its dinginess and cringeworthy reality. He is unabashed and fearless in his vision and execution. From the first frame in projector room to the tiny box in the climax where a blue film is being shot on video, every detailing is taken care to recreate the world of C grade film industry and its even lower grade fraternity. However, the world is unwelcoming, disgusting and disturbing. Though the director is successful in generating these emotions in you as audience, I do not think if it is good cinema or not. Though credit must be given where due. A big applause for the Director to stick to his vision and make the film, the way he wanted to make. However, the editing again by him only could have been better. There are few places where we do not get link of why and what is happening. Though we are amused, we are not connected or involved in the movie. That’s what makes it unrecommendable.\n\nWhile we talk about atmosphere and feel of the movie, let’s mention that production design by Tabasheer Zutshi is spot on. Be it the jungle set or horror movie scene or the cabaret dance set, it is as realistic as possible. Art Director Dhanya Pilo shall be given credit for it. Casting by Sharad Kalawar is perfect.\n\nMost cast of the film is unknown except Nawazuddin but everyone has given good realistic performance. It is a tailor made role for Nawazuddin who does it with full sincerity and honesty. He plays the unhappy, good hearted Sonu convincingly. Anil George as his elder brother is excellent too. Niharika Singh as pinky/saloni/pooja is ok. Every other actor has done justice to their roles.\n\nSo “Miss Lovely” is an art house film which disturbs and unsettles you but does not give a feeling of watching a good film.\n\nRatings:\n\nRecommendation : I will not recommend this movie to anyone except art house and festival cinema lovers. It may be different and realistic, but I will not spend my money on its tickets.\n\nShowtimes for Nagpur, Maharashtra\n\nPvr Empress City Mall – empress city mall, opposite raman science centre gandhi sagar lake, Nagpur, India\n\n‎8:10pm‎\n\nCinemax Eternity Mall – eternity mall, variety square, sitabudi, Nagpur, India\n\n‎5:45pm‎\n\nInox Tuli Mall – kamptee road, nagpur, Nagpur, India\n\n‎10:50am‎ – ‎5:05pm‎\n\nInox Poonam Mall – poonam mall, Nagpur, India\n\n‎11:05am‎ – ‎7:50pm‎\n\nMiss Lovely: Movie Review by Prashen H. Kyawal\n\n↧\n\n↧\n\nJai Ho : Movie Review by Prashen H. Kyawal\n\nMy CMS\n\nJai Ho: Violent Aam Aadmi\n\nDirector: Sohail Khan\n\nLanguage: Hindi\n\nProduction company: Sohail Khan Productions\n\nCast: Salman Khan\n\nMusic composed by: Devi Sri Prasad, Sajid-Wajid\n\nSalman Khan films are critic proof. Whatever critic says, still his movies will by default do 100cr+ business. He is a star who can do anything on screen and his fans will still cheer for him. I think he specially chooses such films which do not require to stress brain even a bit. However, this time, Salman has came out a film with a message. A message which can make the society better if followed with sincerity, honesty and compassion.\n\nJai Ho is a remake of Chiranjeevi starer South Indian Film Stalin written hence the story credit is given to A. R. Murugadoss. Story is is good at the idea level but it seems that no one bothered to develop it to its full potential. Dilip Shukla has written the screenplay and dialogues. He has done whatever he could with the undeveloped story. The film gradually grows on you till interval and raises expectation. Later, it goes down without lack of content. A beautiful idea is wasted because it is half baked and not fully exploited. Another problem I have is with comic scenes which mostly revolves around the child actor in the film. He has some cringeworthy dialogs (which his well educated father-mother ignores under the pretence of he being naughty). It seems that now a days comedy can not be written without going below the belt and special without mentioning undergarments.\n\nThe Story is about Jai Agnihotri (Salman Khan), who lives with his mom (Nadira Babbar) happily. Though his mother is angry with his sister Riya Agnihotri (Tabu) for marring against her will, Jai enjoys good relations with his Sister and Brother-in-law, Rehan (Mahesh Thakur). He’s specially fond of their son Kabir (Master Naman Jain). He generally spends time with them like aam urban aadmi by going to amusement parks, multiplexes, etc. With so much time together, he also falls in love with a girl, Rinky (Daisy Shah) who is his sister’s neighbour. While doing all this, Jai who is good soul, keeps trying to help people in distress all the time. Once he helps a girl (who saves a girl from some roughs in a club) caught by goons. When her family wants to thank him, he gets an idea and requests them to help 3 other people instead of saying thanks. This idea pics up and spreads. Jai keeps on doing good things where he confronts with many baddies in town. One such incidence involves him in fight with the son (Mukul Dev) of home minister (Vikas Bhalla) who then kidnaps Jai’s nephew, Rehan. While Jai saves Rehan, he kills home minister’s son. In all this confrontation, how Jai gets out of danger due to his own chain of good deeds is the story of this film.\n\nDirector Sohail Khan has done better job than his earlier films. He is able to keep good pace of the narrative. Even though the songs appear at wrong times and film gets slow and diverted at many places, overall he keeps audience interest alive till interval. Post interval he is paralysed due to lack of content and film gets dull. Swift Film Editing by Ashish Amrute is also not able to save the movie post interval.\n\nProduction value of the film is top notch. With most portions being shot at Ramoji Film City, Production Design by Sabu Cyril is ok. Cinematography by Santosh Thundhiiayil is pleasing. Casting by Mukesh Chhabra is epic due to access to all and any star actors in the industry. Action sequences (Anl Arasukumar, K. Ravi Varma and Dave Judge) are very well done. They can be gory for the week hearted and small kids (film has U/A certificate).\n\nMusic by Sajid-Wajid, Devi Sri Prasad and Amal Malik could not give any block buster song which is generally a main crowd puller in a Salman film. Still, ‘Photocopy’, ‘Baaki sab first class hai’ are foot tapping and ‘Tere naina’ may be on radio for a lot longer time period. Choreography by Remo D’Souza, Radhika Rao and Vinay Sapru, Shaikh Jani Basha, Mudassar Khan and Shabina Khan is excellent and Salman has danced his heart out in those songs.\n\nJai Ho is a star studded film with Salman Khan in almost each frame. But there are many small roles for which well known actors/stars are used. Being a Salman Khan film, no one must have dared to say no to the role offered to them. Everyone has done good job in their roles. Only complain I have is with Genelia D’Souza who plays helpless handicapped girl without both four arms. Why on earth she accepted this role?\n\nThe new lead actress, Daisy Shah, making debut through this big film who is apparently a Salman Khan find is good at dancing but totally zero at acting. Thankfully he does not have much role in the movie.\n\nSalman Khan is in full form in this movie and sizzles on screen every time he is there. He is able to get a lot of applause from his fans in the cinema hall. The “being animal” part in his character came out properly but isn’t utilised fully. He did to go over the top (may be because the role is already over the top) nor he sleep walked through the role (as he does many times). Salman is backbone of this movie and this movie is much better treat for his fan following than many other recent one like Ready and Ek tha tiger. I would not hesitate to say it has more repeat value than those.\n\nThe film has many loopholes and cinematic liberty is used till it is abused (For example, Sunil Shetty who is Jai’s friend since army days, bangs a car in middle of city road with an army TANK). Being a remake of South Indian film, it has the typical south masala which can kill anyone who expects some substance from cinema. Overall, it is an out an out action packed entertainer which you must not watch if you take cinema too seriously.\n\nRecommendation : Sallu Bhai ki film hai… Mai kuchh bhi bologna, aap dekhoge hi. Masala film lovers will watch the film because they love it. The ones who do not like such potboilers, but love movies, will still watch it to make fun of it. For others who really want to see ONLY good quality cinema, I have one word… skip!\n\nEveryone else will watch it anyways.\n\nJai Ho showtimes for Nagpur\n\nCinemax Eternity Mall – eternity mall, variety square, sitabudi, Nagpur, India\n\n‎9:00‎ – ‎9:45‎ – ‎10:15am‎ – ‎12:45‎ – ‎1:15‎ – ‎2:45‎ – ‎3:45‎ – ‎4:15‎ …\n\nRaj Talkies – Nagpur, India\n\n‎12:00‎ – ‎3:00‎ – ‎6:00‎ – ‎9:00pm‎\n\nPvr Empress City Mall – empress city mall, opposite raman science centre gandhi sagar lake, Nagpur, India\n\n‎9:00‎ – ‎9:30‎ – ‎10:00‎ – ‎11:00am‎ – ‎12:00‎ – ‎12:30‎ – ‎1:00‎ – ‎2:10‎ …\n\nJanki Theatre – near bank of maharashtra, sitabuldi, Nagpur, India\n\n‎12:30‎ – ‎3:30‎ – ‎6:30‎ – ‎9:30pm‎\n\nRajvilas Cinema – nagpur mahal, Nagpur, India\n\n‎12:30‎ – ‎3:30‎ – ‎6:30‎ – ‎9:30pm‎\n\nLiberty – residency rd nr bishop ground, sadar, Nagpur, India\n\n‎12:30‎ – ‎3:30‎ – ‎6:30‎ – ‎9:30pm‎\n\nAlankar – north ambazari road, dharampeth, Nagpur, India\n\n‎12:30‎ – ‎3:30‎ – ‎6:30‎ – ‎9:30pm‎\n\nPanch Sheel – wardha road, Nagpur, India\n\n‎12:30‎ – ‎3:30‎ – ‎6:30‎ – ‎9:30pm‎\n\nJai Ho : Movie Review by Prashen H. Kyawal\n\n↧\n\nOne by Two : Movie Review by Prashen H. Kyawal\n\nMy CMS\n\nOne by Two : Urban Diaries\n\nOne by Two has two parallel stories running side by side (many times literally shown by split screen). Amit Sharma (Abhay Deol) who works as a project manager in an IT company. He is recently dumped by his girl friend Radhika (Geetika Tyagi) who moves on in life with her new boy friend Ranjan Sadanah (Diwakar Pundir), who is a dance reality show producer. But Amit does not move on and wants Rahika back in his life. Amits’s colleagues and friends Anika (Preetika Chawla) and Mihir (Tahir Bhasin) always try to get him out of this idea.\n\nIn parallel happens the story of Samara Patel (Preeti Desai). She is a western dancer who is in casual relationship with her dance group leader Jonathan (Yudhishtir Urs). She too breaks up with him when he ditches her as lead dancer of the group and selects someone else. She lives with her mother Kalpana (Lillete Dubey) who is an alcoholic and needs Samara to take care of her. However, after Samara lives the dance group and decides to participate in Dance Reality show “Dance Wars”, Kalpana keeps her motivated.\n\nWhen Amit knows that his ex Girlfriend Radhika’s boyfriend Ranjan is producer of “Dance Wars”, he makes a plan to hack into the voting system of the show and rig the results to make deserving candidates losers and vice versa. By doing this he wants to reduce the TRP of the show which can result is getting Ranjan hacked. He thinks this way Radhika can come back to his life.\n\nAmit hacks the system with his friends and due to that Samara, who is supposed to win, looses the show. Show TRP decline and Amit succeeds in getting Ranjan out of the show. However, Radhika rejects him again saying he is the most boring person she has ever meet. However, she herself comes back to him to accept her after he becomes famous due to a coincidence.\n\nWhat that coincidence is? How Amit becomes famous? What happens Samara? Do they ever meet? You can know all this when you watch the movie. The question is, shall we watch it?\n\nThis story and screenplay by Devika Bhagat is like urban diaries of 2 different persons who live in a city and happen to cross each others life many times without actually knowing it. The screenplay has many sub plots like that of Amit’s Mother Meenu (Rati Aghnihotri) trying to get him married with a plum Shishika (Yashika Dhillon), Samara’s father’s (Anish Trivedi) behaviour with her mother. Then that of a B Boying Dancer Bunty (Netrapal He-Ra Singh) who meets Samara on Dance Wars and that of Amit’s poet uncle ACP Dhawan (Darshan Jariwala), etc. These sub plots does not help take the story forward. The main stories strictly run parallel and the lead actors do not actually meet each other for a lot longer bit that you would expect. So we can only assume that Devika only wanted to show urban diaries of two people. The film has an open ending or scope of sequel (which shall not be made). Devika has also written the dialogs with Manoj Tapadia, which does to help in the film anyways.\n\nDevika again takes the mantle as Director of the film and do not show much potential here too. Rather than the main story, Devika somewhat succeeds in portraying the relationships of Amit and his friends, Amit and his mother, Amit and his Uncle, Amit and his arranged marriage would be bride, etc. Barring that the movie is a drag and convoluted tale of urban people which is not narrated in an entertaining manner. Editor Shan Mohammed despite excelling in technically weaving the two stories together, could not save the film as the writer and Director was unsure of what she wanted to say.\n\nCinematography by Sameer Arya is glossy and glamourous. Production Design by Mustafa Stationwala is good. I must applaud the attention to detail in using ubuntu desktop on the computer screens (considering Amit manages forums and is a hacker). Music by Shankar Ehsaan Loy is average without any chartbusters. Choreography by Ashley Lobo is frustratingly bad considering dance and dance acts form major portion of the film. It is a total lost chance in that department.\n\nThe best part in the film is brilliant performances by the supporting cast like Rati Agnihotri, Darshan Jariwala, Lillete Dubey, Yashika Dhillon, Tahir Bhasin and Preetika Chawala. Abhay Deol’s earnest effort could not salvage the film as he does not get to show any other expression than boredom in most part of the film (which is induced in the audience too). Preeti Desai as Samara does not impress at all. She is said to be trained dancer but does not get to show her skills due to shoddy choreography. Overall casting by Panchami Ghavri is a hit and miss case. Great example of Miss case is B Boy Netrapal He-Ra Singh as Bunty.\n\nOverall it is a yawn inducing movie which makes us “pakawoed” like Abhay Deol is in the movie.\n\nRating :\n\nRecommendation : If you want to sleep, why to buy ticket and go to theatre. SKIP!\n\nOne by Two : Movie Review by Prashen H. Kyawal\n\n↧\n\nHasee Toh Phasee : Movie Review by Prashen H. Kyawal\n\nMy CMS\n\nHasee Toh Phasee : Quirky and Weird Fun\n\nDirector: Vinil Mathew\n\nScreenplay: Vinil Mathew\n\nProducers: Vikas Bahl, Hiroo Johar, Anurag Kashyap, Karan Johar\n\nCast : Parineeti Chopra , Sidharth Malhotra, Nikhil Bharadwaj, Adah Sharma\n\nThese are exciting times in Hindi Film Industry. While formula films (mostly remakes of South Indian Films) are making moolah at the box office, small budget offbeat films or films with unusual characters are also doing good business. This is not only leading to new combinations of lead pairs but also forcing people from different schools of film making come together to make films which can satisfy the new age audience. Be it a Rowdy Rathore produced by Sanjay Leela Bhansali or this movie in review today which is produced by people with diverse sensibilities like Anurag Kashyap, Vikramaditya Motwane and the mainstream hit machine Karan Johar, such strange joint ventures are being successful.\n\nHasee Toh Phasee brings together so different producers as it is film with main stream romantic comedy genre with characters and treatment of non-mainstream movies. It does have the Love-Engagement-Marriage time duration at the backdrop like every Karan Johar movie but it is sans the grandeur and razzmatazz which Dharma Production is famous for. It also have quirky characters like Anurag Kashyap movies. So it will be interesting to see how box office responds to such a mix.\n\nThe story is about 2 unique individuals in two different families. Individuals who are like square pegs in round holes. They do not fit in the usual format and formula of their families. Meeta (Pariniti Chopra) is a genius and rebellious girl who is condemned by her extended family except her father for not being the usual Indian girl type material. Similarly Nikhil (Sidharth Malhotra) is a similar boy who does not fit in formula of his IAS, IPS and IRS aspirant family. He is caring, committed and hard working but just does not know what he wants to do. At a her elder sister’s marriage ceremony, Nikhil meets Meeta while she is running away from home. Though through they strike chord with each other, Meeta runs away and at the same ceremony Nikhil falls in love with her another sister Karishma (Adah Sharma).\n\nAfter 7 years, Karishma and Nikhil get engaged but she puts a condition in front of Nikhil that he must start a business and get a big contract before their marriage day. To get that contract, Nikhil requires 5 Crores. Meanwhile, Meeta also gets back but as she is ousted by her family, Karishma can not take her home. So she entrusts Nikhil to take care of Meeta’s stay. In this process, Nikhil gets entangled in the complicated maze in which Meeta lives. While he suffers every time he helps her, he enjoys taking care of her and both realise that they are made for each other. What happens next is a fun story with whacky but lovable characters.\n\nThe scenarios of lead pairs falling in love while being in the process of marrying someone else they used to love has been played several times on Indian screen in last 15-17 years. The trend was started by SRK’s movies in which he inevitably happened to love girls who are in love with someone else or getting married to someone else. Then Imtiyaz Ali also has expertise in making his characters go through such mess. However, what makes Hasee to Phasee endearing is the treatment and characterisation.\n\nStory and Screenplay of the film is credited to Harshvardhan Kulkarni. The screenplay and characterisation has many unique and out of the box situations, but still the cohesive mix is not that complete. Harshwardhan Kulkari has also written the dialogs along with Anurag Kashyap, Purva Naresh and Director Vinil Matthew. Dialogs are witty and funny and successful in keeping the smile on your face throughout the film.\n\nDirector Vinil Matthew does impress in his debut film. With his editor Shweta Venkat, he is able to keep good pace and commendable that the movies is of breezy 140 min duration. Still many times, it feels the story isn’t moving forward. Barring few such glitches, he has done a good debut. He has handled the situations well and extracted good performances from the ensemble cast.\n\nSometimes people strive for their whole life to get a break in movies. Often, artists keep working hard to polish their skills. And then there are some chosen ones who has talent as a God gift and are picked from wherever they are to be in movies. Pariniti Chopra is such a God gifted talent who was focused and happy in her studies and then career, but destiny picked her and landed her a 3 film deal with India’s top production house, Yash Raj Films.\n\nThis film belongs to Pariniti and she impresses with the display of twin personalities the character has. One quirky, perky, whacky, weird but gullible Meeta after having medical pills. Another of a wise, honest and caring person that she is originally when not on medicine. She can’t control her bladder, she steals sweats and tooth pastes, she makes intimidating and scary faces and she also makes us believe that she can be the intelligent and genius scientist obsessed by her passion for research. She absolutely enthrals audience with her range of acting and this is her by far the best performance. After this movie, she can not go unnoticed. This movie will open up the world for her for more powerful women centric films.\n\nSiddharth Malhotra ably supports Parinita with his controlled demeanour and committed lover act. However, that’s about it. Other actors which leave an impression are Manoj Joshi (Meeta’s Dad) and Sharat Saxena (Nikhil’s Dad). Adah Sharma does decent job too. Another actor I would like to mention is the one who plays the Indian Idol aspirant Annu Malik fan. He has a good amount of screen time and does full justice to it.\n\nMusic of the film is good with the song ‘Zehnaseeb’ having a longer shelf life. ‘Drama queen’ and ‘Punjabi wedding song’ are flavour of the season. I like the hook line of ‘Sheke it like Shammi’ too. Remo D’souza, Bosco-Caesar and Ahmed Khan is apt but nothing to take home there. Cinematography by Sanu Varughese is pleasant. He has succeeded in not making the film too glossy and keep it somewhat real to protect the soul of the film.\n\nProduction values are top notch though Karan may have had to control himself to not go beyond the story premise and make the film grand and larger than life. It makes better business sense too.\n\nOverall, it is a fun and clean film after many days which you can watch with whole family.\n\nRecommendation : This should be your bet this weekend if you like popcorn entertainment. Nothing great but a decent and fun time pass.\n\nShow Time :\n\nCinemax Eternity Mall – eternity mall, variety square, sitabudi, Nagpur\n\n9:30‎ – ‎11:00am‎ – ‎12:30‎ – ‎1:15‎ – ‎2:00‎ – ‎3:30‎ – ‎5:00‎ – ‎6:30‎ …Pvr Empress City Mall – empress city mall, opposite raman science centre gandhi sagar lake, Nagpur\n\n‎9:30‎ – ‎10:25am‎ – ‎12:30‎ – ‎1:30‎ – ‎3:00‎ – ‎3:30‎ – ‎4:30‎ – ‎6:30‎ …Smruti Cinema Nagpur – residency road sadar, nagpur, Nagpur\n\n‎12:30‎ – ‎3:30‎ – ‎6:30‎ – ‎9:25pm‎Jaya Shree – near lohapool, cotton market, subhash road, Nagpur\n\n‎12:30‎ – ‎3:30‎ – ‎6:30‎ – ‎9:30pm‎Inox Tuli Mall – kamptee road, nagpur, Nagpur\n\n‎9:50‎ – ‎11:15am‎ – ‎12:45‎ – ‎2:00‎ – ‎3:40‎ – ‎4:50‎ – ‎6:35‎ – ‎7:40‎ …\n\nHasee Toh Phasee : Movie Review by Prashen H. Kyawal\n\n↧\n\nGunday : Movie Review by Prashen H. Kyawal\n\nMy CMS\n\nGunday : Bollywood Masala Fry\n\nDirector: Ali Abbas Zafar\n\nMusic composed by: Sohail Sen\n\nProduction company: Yash Raj Films\n\nCast: Priyanka Chopra, Ranveer Singh,Arjun Kapoor\n\nIn search of angry young man or the typical macho hero, Bollywood is exploring lawless belt of the country (UP, Bihar) for stories of Police officers (Dubangg, Rowdy Rathor), Thief and Gangsters (Rowdy Rathor, Bullet Raja, Boss) and travelling back in time (Once upon a Time in Mumbai, Shootout at Wadala). While doing so they are educating audience on illegal drug trade, smuggling, gun trade, etc. Another illegal trade was brought to forth by Anurag Kashyap in Gangs of Wasseypur though it can not be called a typical Bollywood masala film. Ali Abbas Zafar seems to be inspired from it and used this illegal coal business backdrop and back in time retro formula while writing this week’s release “Gunday”\n\nGunday is a story of 2 kids, Bikram (master Darshan Gujar) and Bala (master Jayesh Kardak), who were orphaned during Bangladesh war. They face a lot of atrocities in relief camp there. So they run to Culcutta hiding in a coal wagon or railway. After trying to make an honest living by working hard at small restaurants, they’re forced to fight for their rights and snatch it. They do it by stealing coal from railway wagons. In few years, as they grow up, Bikram (Ranveer Singh) and Bala (Arjun Kapoor) build their empire by having presence in all business through their muscle power and become kings of Calcutta.\n\nA big twist in their life comes after government bestows ACP Satyajit Sarkar (Irrfan Khan), the responsibility of cleaning Calcutta from the menace of Bikram and Bala. He warns them about being under his vigilance always and advises them to refrain from any illegal activities. Second twist, but somewhat beautiful, comes in the life of these two goons in the name of Nandita (Priyanka Chopra), a cabaret dancer. They both fall in love with her and agree to try and woo her one by one alternatively. They agree that they will be ok with whoever Nandita chooses as her lover. What happens next is the story which has more twists and turns topped with lots of Drama and action.\n\nAli Abbas Zafar is credited for Story, Screenplay, Dialogs and Direction. So it is a one man show on the story telling part of the movie. He has used all the formulas and cliches but tried to present them in a gripping manner with a big canvas. He gets us intrigued in the story telling and keeps us hooked by the characterisation and performances he extracted from his lead cast. However, this grip is lost few times throughout the movie and you can find yourself checking your cellphone notifications. Another issue which hurts this movie is lack of a strong villain and interesting peripheral characters. Due to this, you feel like you are watching a 3-4 character movie while the canvas is that of a big budget multi-starrer. This makes us feel suffocated like we are in a coal mine. There are many such loopholes in the screenplay which mars the whole experience. But still, Ali Abbas Zafar makes up for it via stylish presentation and few good dialogs.\n\nAli Abbas Zafar must be praised for the way he has raised questions over the system which gives birth to such Goons without being preachy. He has 2-3 directors shots in the movie like the flying of pigeon when Bikram and Bala fights, and the empty train at the end, etc. He sure has good potential and we can expect better products from him in future.\n\nEditor Rameshwar S. Bhagat must be applauded for handling so much content effectively. Cinematography by Aseem Mishra gives it the larger than life as well as the retro feel as per the demand of the script. Production Designer Rajat Poddar with Art Director Kailash Sahu has been given free hand by Yash Raj Films and he has done justice the freedom by giving high quality output. However, the dummy train in few scenes is looks DUMMY. And the scene when Arjun Kapoor Blows a warehouse has not come out well.\n\nCostume Design by Subarna Ray Chaudhari also stands out and we can not forget the outfit with red heart shaped mark on it. It adds to the outwardly and raucous behaviour by the illiterate heroes. Stunts by Sham Kaushal are good but could’ve been better. Music by Sohail Sen is average barring ‘Tune maari entriyaan’ and will be soon forgotten.\n\nCasting Director Shanoo Sharma again hit bulls eye in casting of this movie. The child actors who played Bikram (master Darshan Gujar) and Bala (master Jayesh Kardak) done a marvelous job. Pankaj Tripathi in a small role of Lateef who gets these kids in the world of crime made an impression. Jameel Khan (as Satyajit Sarkar’s colleague) did not get much scope, but Anant Sharma (as Himanshu) makes his presence felt. Again the problem is none of the peripheral characters are explored fully which could’ve improved this movie a lot.\n\nHighlight of this movie is performances by its lead cast i.e. Ranveer Singh, Arjun Kapoor, Priyanka Chopra and Irrfan Khan. While Ranveer and Priyanka steals the show, Arjun Kapoor equally does good. While Irrfan Khan does is best, he is not backed by the writer properly. Ranveer infuses energy on the screen and Priyanka oozes glamour every time she is there. The chemistry between Ranveer-Arjun, Ranveer-Priyanka, Arjun-Priyanka and between all 3 is outstanding.\n\nOverall, “Gunday” is a good masala movie with good performances and larger than life story telling.

Kyawal\n\n↧\n\n↧\n\nHighway : Movie Review by Prashen H. Kyawal\n\nMy CMS\n\nHighway : A road less traveled\n\nStar Cast: Alia Bhatt, Randeep Hooda\n\nDirector: Imtiaz Ali\n\nImtiyaz Ali is one of the most important directors in today’s Hindi Film Industry. His incredible success in recent past has created a fan follower which expects mushy love stories with melodious songs from him. With his humble beginning from “Socha Na Tha” which launched Abhay Deol, Imtiyaz tasted success in his second film “Jab We Met” which helped Kareena Kapoor to erase “POO” from public’s memory and replace it with “Geet”. Imtiyaz’s formula of new age romance with the protagonists being confused about whether they are in love or not continued with his subsequent movies “Love Aaj Kal” and “Rockstar” (though Rockstar had a huge canvas apart from that). Another element of his movies is journey. The characters are either on run or in a journey in most part of the movie. In his new movie “Highway”, these 2 elements are still there. It is an unusual love story as well as it has a lot of travel across length and breadth of north India.\n\nImtiyaz Ali is credited for Story, Screenplay, Dialogues and Direction of “Highway”. As per his interview this story has been with him since 12 years when he made half hour episode for a television serial “Rishtey” in 1999. He thought of many ways of telling this story considering it via multiple genres including big action film. Finally, Imtiyaz settled on telling this story sans anything else and stuck to the journey of his protagonists and finding themselves on the way. It’s a coming-of-age movie.\n\nThe story is based on a thin premise that a girl who is kidnapped finds freedom in the captivity. Veera Tripathi (Alia Bhat) is city girl from very influential and rich family who has never been real open world. Even their travels, the family stays in hotels only. Veera has a craving for the road and open air. She insists her fiancée for a long drive on which she gets kidnapped by Mahabir Bhati (Randeep Hooda). But she feels free in this captivity and eventually falls in love with him. The story is not about what happens next but how things happen and the overall experience the Director creates for us.\n\nThe story is interesting and but screenplay could have been better. Though the movie keeps the audience interested, it does not entertain them per say. Few more scenes of cameraderie and fun on the way could have solved that purpose. Even a little more details of Mahabir’s backstory could have provided the much needed drama.\n\nThough the screenplay lacks in happening and entertaining content, Director Imtiyaz Ali makes up for it by the experience he creates for the audience. The film moves across 6 states, many unseen locations and breath taking landscapes. With his cinematographer Anil Mehta, Imtiyaz takes us through a journey unforgettable. While doing so, he also makes a strong statement on all that is wrong in the society without even showing any of that visually. All trough the movie, he makes us think how far we have came away from the beautiful world that has been created for us by the All-mighty. He not shows how cut off we are from real world out of the city but also gives hint of how the side effects of civilisation is creating a rich-poor divide which is giving birth to many oppressors. It also throws light on how even the well heeled too are suffocated under the pretence of today’s society and how there are dangerous criminals hidden within regular public. Take a bow Mr. Director for this.\n\nA. R. Rahman and Imitiyaz Ali created magic in “Rockstar” which raised the expectations about this film’s music a lot. Though the music is good, the Rahman-Imtiyaz Ali combo fails to give multiple hit songs. Also, as the film has less things happening on screen, lack of many good songs is felt drastically. This is the second part where film is lacking.\n\nPerformance wise this is an Alia Bhat film all the way. She breathe the character and brings it alive on screen. Randeep Hooda impresses with his top notch performance too. However he gets very little significant to do than watch Alia from distance. Other actors playing roles of Aadoo (Durgesh Kumar), Tonk (Pradeep Nagar), Goru (Saharsha Kumar Shukla) does perfect justice to their job.\n\nOverall, “Highway” is a very well made and very important film of our era. It shall be India’s entry to Oscars this year.\n\nRating and Recommendation:\n\n“Highway” is a complicated film to review. It’s hard to rate. Rather it shall not be rated because it is not just a film but is an experience. It needs to be experienced and felt. And if I may say, only a few can feel it. So everyone who look for quality cinema which is unique and different, do go for this movie.\n\nHighway : Movie Review by Prashen H. Kyawal\n\n↧\n\nShadi ke Side Effects : Movie Review by Prashen H. Kyawal\n\nNagpur Today : Nagpur News\n\nShadi ke Side Effects : sequel ke side effects\n\nFew are sequel movies are better or even as good as its first instalment. “Pyar ke Side Effects” was a very high quality product which is an example of good urban love story in Bollywood. It also was one of the first movie to start trend of unique and unusual pairing of lead actor and actress. Pairing of the mallika of a Bombshell image, Mallika Sherawat with the crusader of cinema of substance, Rahul Bose, created ripples at that time. They both did justice to their roles and along with the script, direction and music, that filmedwas a great success.\n\nThe producers of the original movie “Pritish Nandi Communications” aka PNC, this time joined hands with Balaji Motion Pictures to come up with sequel for the earlier blockbuster. This time the actors are even bigger i.e. Farhan Akhtar and Vidya Balan play Sid and Trisha. Sid and Trisha has rocking chemistry and love story which happily gets converted into marriage. They both are enjoying their youthful and promising life and are looking forward to next steps in their careers. But destiny has some other plans and they get the news that they are going to be parents. Sid really tries hard to take care of Trisha and be an understanding husband. However, once the baby girl “Mili” arrives, their life changes drastically. Sid starts missing the happy-go-lucky, fun loving Trisha who turns into a nutcase taking care of her baby. Her perspective totally changes and she sees life only from Mili’s angle. Sid gets fade up and shares his problem with Trisha’s brother-in-law Ranvir (Ram Kapoor). Ranvir gives him a weird but effective solution which brings back happiness in Sid’s Life. What happens after that shall be watched on screen.\n\nThe story is simple and sweet like the 1st Film. However, what made “Pyar ke side Effects” fun was the screenplay, characterisation and overall treatment. Saket Chaudhary who had written and directed the earlier film, has come up with this story in collaboration with Zeenat Lakhani. He has also penned the screenplay with her and Arshad Shayed who has also taken care of Dialogues. Smart, Witty Humour which does not make you laugh your guts out but keeps a continuous smile on your face, was the strength of PKSE. With a 3 people team, SKSE failed to achieve that level but still keeps the audience interested.\n\nSaket has made his earlier film lively by a sharp, urban and stylish presentation of it. This time, he has failed to keep that innovation in the narrative. A small story has been stretched to 2 hr 25 min. A crisp 2 hr duration would have been much better for the movie. Having said that, he is able to keep the on screen proceedings interesting with sprinkling of humour which makes the film a good once a watch.\n\nPerformance wise Farhan Akhtar delivers what is required out of him. He is loveable as loyal husband who also wants to live his youthful life as it was before being a parent. However, as per his on screen life, audience too get to very less of Vidya as the story is written completely from Sid’s Point of view. In a way, does it prove that the writers did not find anything interesting in a woman’s life when she is engrossed in early development of her child? Vidya does her job couldn’t leave a mark. In fact, there is not much to take away in both lead actors role in this film.\n\nBest part of the movie is Manav (Vir Das) who adds some masala to the movie. Ram Kapoor impresses with his controlled performance. Purab Kohli as Shekhar is apt. After long, we get to see Gautami Kapoor as Ranvir’s wife. Most cute and lovely baby actors are baby Anushka Gavad, baby Mahi Bhanushali, baby Aayra Mehta, baby Angel Fernandes, baby Pranjal Parab and baby Hetavi Bhanushali who play Mili’s character in different ages.\n\nMusic by Pritam misses the mark this time. Barring ‘Harry’s not a brahmachari’ and ‘Tauba main vyah karke pachhtaya’, not other song lingers in our mind. Manoj Lobo and Rishi Punjabi has done good work in cinematography. Production quality is top notch.\n\nOverall, it is a good film which couldn’t be a great film.\n\nRating :\n\nRecommendation : It is a clean film to watch with whole family. If you are a movie buff who can’t miss a movie, do watch it. Though a little bit stretched, you will enjoy it.But if you are the kind demanding every worth of the penny, prefer to watch it on Cable/DVD.\n\nDirected by Saket Chaudhary\n\nProduced by Ekta Kapoor, Shobha Kapoor & Pritish Nandy\n\nWritten by Saket Chaudhary\n\nStarring : Farhan Akhtar, Vidya Balan, Ram Kapoor & Vir Das\n\nMusic by Pritam\n\nShowtimes\n\nPvr Empress City Mall\n\nempress city mall, opposite raman science centre gandhi sagar lake, Nagpur\n\n9:00 10:00 10:55am 12:00 1:00 2:00 3:00 4:00 5:00 6:00 7:00 8:00 9:05 10:05 11:00pm\n\nCinemax Eternity Mall\n\neternity mall, variety square, sitabudi, Nagpur\n\n9:30 10:15 11:00am 12:30 2:00 3:30 5:00 6:30 8:00 9:30 11:00pm\n\nJaya Shree\n\nnear lohapool, cotton market, subhash road, Nagpur\n\n12:30 3:30 6:30 9:30pm\n\nRajvilas Cinema\n\nnagpur mahal, Nagpur\n\n12:30 3:30 6:30 9:30pm\n\nInox Tuli Mall\n\nkamptee road, nagpur, Nagpur\n\n9:30 10:30am 12:30 1:30 2:20 3:30 4:30 6:30 7:30 8:30 9:30 10:30pm\n\nInox Poonam Mall\n\npoonam mall, Nagpur\n\n9:00 10:15am 12:00 1:15 3:00 4:15 6:00 7:15 9:00 10:15pm\n\nShadi ke Side Effects : Movie Review by Prashen H. Kyawal\n\n↧\n\nGulaab Gang : Movie Review by Prashen H. Kyawal\n\nNagpur Today : Nagpur News\n\nGulaab Gang : Commercial Masala Potboiler\n\nDirector: Soumik Sen\n\nProducer: Anubhav Sinha\n\nMusic composed by: Soumik Sen\n\nScreenplay: Amitosh Nagpal, Soumik Sen\n\nCast : Madhuri Dixit (Rajjo),Juhi Chawla (Sumitra Devi),Sumitra Devi,Tannishtha Chatterjee,Priyanka Bose (Sandhya),Sandhya,Divya Jagdale\n\nIn the past, a lot of films were based on subject of small villages being exploited by local politicians. Recently too Bollywood is scouting for similar stories in quest of a hero-villain drama which is lacking in civilised urban setting. But barring few exceptions, these are all male oriented films. Gulab Gang is one such rare movie where the hero of the movie is female. Not only that, she does everything like singing, dancing, fighting like any other hero.\n\nBeing inspired from the story of Gulabi Gang but not a biographic, Gulaab Gang is an out and out commercial product but with a strong message about women empowerment and need to stand against everything that is wrong. Earlier it was said that the film is based on Sampat Pal’s life, but the creators denied this, saying that he is inspired by to her work but the movie is not based on her life.\n\nStory, Screenplay, Direction is by Soumik Sen who debuts as Director with this movie. He has also written the Dialogues with Amitosh Nagpal. Apart from that, he has not only composed the music of the film but also written and composed a song “Teri Jai Ho”. Uff, I am exhausted even while writing this.\n\nThe story of Gulaab Gang does not dwell much on how Rajjo (Madhuri Dixit) who is eager to get educated, starts an ashram for abused women who are thrown out of house by husbands, raped by sex mongers or ousted by society for any other reason. They wear pink saris produced by themselves and hence are fondly called as “Gulaab Gang”. Rajjo is ably supported by her sub-ordinates Mahie (Divya Jagdale) and Sandhya (Priyanka Bose). The story of Gulaab Gang starts from the incidence where the gang has to intervene to get electricity back to the village which was cut by an officer (Atul Srivastava) willing to extract bribe from the villagers. Then it shows various such events like supporting a woman, Kajri (Tannishtha Chatterjee) after being thrown out of home, rescuing of trucks with stolen grocery from ration stores, etc.\n\nHowever, the story picks up after Sumitra Devi (Juhi Chawala) enters the scene. She is supposed to marry her sister with Arun Shankar who is son of the local politician Pawan Shankar (Joginder Singh) who is her party candidate from that area. However, Pawan Shankar’s son Arun Shankar (Sudev Nair) rapes Fiza (Tanvi Rao). On Sumitra Devi’s visit to Pawan Shankar about the marriage proposal, Rajjo gatecrashes and makes her aware of the misdeed of Arun. Contrary to Rajjo’s expectation, Sumitra takes Pawan’s Side and offers her compensation for the rape of Fiza. What happens next forms the tussle between Rajjo and Sumitra Devi.\n\nWhile the first of the movie forms activities of Gulaab Gang as mentioned above, the second half is about its struggle when Rajjo decides to enter in politics. The story does not have highs and lows and moves at same level. The screen play repeats the similar scenes of Gangs intervention in different kind of injustice and then a song and dance sequence (which I feel was totally unnecessary but the Director could not keep away himself from it as he is the music composer and Madhuri is known for her moves). However, Director Soumik Sen makes up for it by powerful taking of the scenes and powerful editing by Cheragh Todiwala. A film which could’ve been easily an art house cinema is turned into a commercial masala potboiler by the Director. I am happy that he does not pretend to be making an art house cinema and does what he feels. Nonetheless, he does good job in his debut as Director. Can expect more powerful commercial cinema from him if he gets better scripts and music (maybe by hiring different experts for that)\n\nMusic by Soumik Sen is ok but the songs are hindrance in the narration. I think the songs will grow on you with multiple listening but does not help in the movie. Lyrics (Neha Saraf, Soumik Sen and Shreya Narayan) is hard to understand due to rural flair. Choreography by Saroj Khan is ok. Makes it more drab and dull. Cinematography by Alphonse Roy is great. Action by Parvez Shaikh and Feroz are good. Though if Soumik had shown a bit of physical training of the Gang, the action would have been more believable.\n\nThe movie is watchable due to strong performances by not only the leading ladies but also by the supporting cast too. Madhuri essays the powerful role with ease and displays varied emotions effortlessly. Watch her when her face lits up with the mention of a promise to build school. Watch her when she gets unexpected reply from Juhi when she complains about the rape. Watch her in her fights. She did full justice to the role. I only did not like the sequences in which she breaks into a song every now and then. It was totally uncalled for. Juhi Chawala portrays the villainous Sumitra Devi remarkably. She is pure evil whenever she comes on screen. Though her character is diluted when she’s shown seating like a Don in party office with her supporters and when she leads the attack at the climax and wields a machine gun. She is shown clever enough to keep out of picture while dealing with all the dirty work, then why would she get her hands soaked in blood? I understand that the Director clearly wanted to play to the galleries but now even the single screen first row audience too can not digest such irregularities. Juhi sure will be nominated and may win few awards for best actor in negative role category.\n\nThough everyone from the supporting cast done their job perfectly, a special mention is due for Divya Jagdale and Priyanka Bose who plays left and right hand of Rajjo. Soumik Sen must be applauded for extracting great performances by the cast. It is also a job well done by casting director Prashant Singh.\n\nOverall, Gulaab Gang is an out an out commercial movie which has underlining message of women empowerment, need for education and eradication of corruption from society. I request you to wait and watch the complete end titles which pays tributes to women who are making difference in some or the other way.\n\nRecommendation: Do watch it for the story it brings on screen and for the message it has. People expecting art house cinema must refrain from the movie.\n\nPrashen H. Kyawal\n\nGulaab Gang : Movie Review by Prashen H. Kyawal\n\n↧\n\nQueen : Movie Review by Prashen H. Kyawal\n\nNagpur Today : Nagpur News\n\nQueen : Delightful piece of Art and Entertainment\n\nDirector: Vikas Bahl\n\nCast: Kangna Ranaut, Lisa Haydon and Rajkummar Rao\n\nCritics do not critique a movie because they like them. Contrary, they do it because they love movies. We want every movie to be good and get affected severely by it not turning out good. We know movie making is most expensive art and we want the privileged ones who can make them to know the feedback on their creations for betterment in future. Seldom a movie comes which we want to applaud wholeheartedly and enjoy it just as an audience.\n\n“Queen” is one such movie. And is another product by big corporate meeting quality cinema creators. After the successful collaboration of mainstream with quality cinema in “Hasee to Phasee”, Anurag Kashyap and Vikramaditya Motwane join hands with Viacom 18 for “Queen”. They again prove that love for cinema coupled with good production and distribution strength can do wonders both at quality of cinema as well as box office.\n\nWritten by Vikas Bahl, Chaitally Parmar and Parveez Sheikh, “Queen” is a coming of age, travel movie. Judging from promo, I predicted it could be a mix of themes from “Cocktail” (a Stranded Girl in an unknown country) and “English-Vinglish” (A woman is liberated by the ways in new country and yes, impresses via culinary skills). My prediction is proven true but good news is, the makers have made the movie even better.\n\nThe story is about traditionally raised Rajouri Girl, Rani who is called Queen (Kangana Ranaut) by her fiancee Vijay (Rajkumar Rao). On the day of her marriage, Vijay breaks up with her leaving her shattered. The already low on confidence Rani decides to use her Honeymoon Tickets and travel as planned earlier, albeit alone (as she says “Main apane honeymoon pe akeli aayi hun”). In her hotel, she befriends with Vijayalakshmi (Lisa Haydon) who is a Hot single mother with Indian genes from her father’s side. Vijaya shows her around paris and helps her gain enough confidence to travel to Amsterdam alone. In Amsterdam, Rani stays in hostel where she shares room with 3 male room mates Oleksander (Mish Boyko), Taka (Jeffrey Ho) and Tim (Guitobh Joseph). She also meets Marcello (Marco Canadea) who is Chef and owns a restaurant. Marcello gets angry with Rani for not liking her food. Later they befriend each other at a cooking competition.\n\nWhile Rani is having all these life altering experiences and discovering new things about the world, life and herself, Vijay gets back interest in her after seeing her picture in modern outfit which she sends to him by mistake. He tries to find her across Paris and Amsterdam when she does not pick his calls.\n\nWhat happens with Vijay and Rani? Do they get back again?\n\nGenerally I do not tell story of the movie so elaborately. But as you can see there is not much twists and turns in the story which needs to be hidden. The magic of this film is in the Screenplay, Dialogues and Direction. It is a travel film which needs to be experienced and to have fun with.\n\nAll 3 writers deserves applause for writing somewhat unique story and an exemplary screenplay. Small comic/drama events and detailed characterisation (do notice Chintu, Rani’s brother), of each role makes this movie enjoyable throughout its length. This again underlines the fact that not only the roles of the lead actors but the surrounding characters are equally important for a good movie. And all this is supported in equally good strength by the Dialogue writers (Anvita Dutt and Kangana Ranaut).\n\nEven though the screenplay is strong, Director Vikas Bahl does not only rely on it. He takes it even further and demonstrates remarkable skills is bring real life fun on celluloid. Slice of life films and travel films are by default hard to make. It is hard to recreate the moments one lives through that travel. But Vikas Bahl proves that Cinema is a Director’s Medium and serves his audience with an enjoyable fair. Notice the scenes when Rani dances teasing the taxi driver outside the dance club or when she skypes with her parents who are having power outage at home, the shot where Oleksander puts beer in his “Golgappe” aka paanipuri, etc.\n\nHis editing team Abhijit Kokate and Anurag Kashyap gives him powerful support with perfect editing. I feel special proud to mention that Abhijit Kokate is our own Nagpuri Boy. I see him going places after this movie. More power to you, Abhijit.\n\nMusic and Background score by Amit Trivedi is great. The song “London Thumkada” is already on charts. The remixed version of “Hungama Ho gaya” will make you feel like dancing with Rani. Thought other songs could have been better. Bosco-Caesar have choreographed the songs according to the characterisation. Cinematography in a travel film is very important and here Bobby Singh and Siddharth Diwan did excellent job at it.\n\nHaving talked about all technical departments, last but not the least is performances by the actors and this movie belongs to Kangana Ranaut. Kangana is as important to this movie as the Director itself. She lends sincerity, innocence, vulnerability to Rani and lives her life on screen. She gets under the skin of the character and makes the audience forget whatever different images she had in past. And boy, what a body of work Kangana has. From the depressed, alcoholic urban girls in Gangster, Woh Lamhe, Metro and Fashion to Retro gangster wife in Once Upon a Time in Mumbai to the outwardly and strong bride in Tanu Weds Manu, she has done different characters effectively. However, this film will put her in league of top actresses who can carry female centric films.\n\nEqually good as Kangana is Lisa Haydon who essays the role of free-spirited VijayaLaxmi. Rajkumar Rao as Vijay does justice to his role. Master Chinmaya Agarwal does good job as Chintu. All other actors lend equal good support to the movie, however we need to mention Marco Canadea who gives the screen a different shine whenever he there.\n\nIf we get to discuss the shortcomings of the movie, we will find few like story does not having much graph or feeling stuck on the travel/party scenes. Barring such few niggles, the movie is near perfect. Initially, I thought the Director should have opted for subtitles for the foreign languages but then I understood it was to make audience feel the trouble Rani going through in a Foreign Country.\n\nOverall, “Queen” is lite, entertaining and subtly gives a message that not all we feel bad is bad unless we go there and experience it. It gives you chance to experience the life of a backpacker, from your comfy chair, with all the fun and troubles in it. What more can we ask for?\n\nRecommendation: Go watch this movie. You will feel happy, lite and optimistic.\n\nNote: While you enjoy this movie about troubles and fun of the privileged ones living in city, who c"
