        "text": "'1983' - Malayalam Movie Review\n\nCrew\n\nDirected by Abrid Shine\n\nProduced by Shamsudheen\n\nScreenplay, Dialogues Abrid Shine, Bipin Chandran\n\nMusic by Gopi Sunder\n\nCinematography Pradeesh Varma\n\nEditing by Manoj\n\nStudio Shams Films\n\nDistributed by LJ Films (India) / PJ Entertainments (Europe)\n\nRelease dates 31 Jan 2014\n\nCountry India\n\nLanguage Malayalam\n\nCast\n\nNivin Pauly as Rameshan\n\nAnoop Menon as Vijay Menon\n\nNikki Galrani as Manjula\n\nSrinda Ashab\n\nJacob Gregory\n\nJoy Mathew\n\nRajeev Pillai\n\nSaiju Kurup\n\nAju Varghese\n\nTini Tom\n\nShine Tom Chacko\n\nHollywood releases at least 2/3 sports based movies every year. Even though India is a country obsessed with Cricket, Football etc we rarely get to see movie based on sports and sports men. '1983' is an offering from Mollywood, to the cricket frenzy nation, as a celebration of the sport.\n\n'1983' tells the story of Rameshan, from a 10 year old boy who witness Kapil's Devils winning the coveted world cup trophy at the Mecca of cricket in 1983, to a 40 year middle aged husband/father. Rameshan lives, breathes, eats, sleeps cricket and wanted to play for India. But fate had different plans for him as each of his dream comes crumbling down. Even though he movies own in life with each and every single turn in his life cricket forms a part directly or indirectly. The events that follows in Rameshan's life forms the rest of the story.\n\nThe first half mainly deals with Rameshan, his friends, cricket and of course Sachin, which is all fun and entertaining with some exciting moments and good one liners. Second half shifts to the sweet-harsh realities of life and has more of a serious tone. It shifts focus for a short period of time and lags here and there. But was able to end the movie convincingly, in a good manner and to send every viewer home happy.\n\nIts hard to believe that this is Abrid Shine's debut movie, he has done an outstanding job directing the movie as perfect entertainer, especially in the initial half. For his story, Abrid co-wrote the film with Bipin Chandran & the writing is very good. The charm, fun and excitement of road side/school ground cricket was well presented on celluloid. The film is not just confined to cricket and its excitement, but also tells a good story. It gives a message and takes everyone down their memory lanes.\n\nMusic & Re Recording by Gopi Sundar was also good, a good comeback by him after being of color in he past few outings. Cinematography was superb, editing was better, but a crisp 2nd half could have done more good towards the totality of the film. Art department also deserves special applause.\n\nNivin Pauly got his career best role and he was able to do justice to it. Srindaa Ashaab was excellent, Jacob Gregory rocked & Saiju Kurup was good. Rest of the cast also did good job. Nikki Galrani was okay in the acting front, but lip sync/dubbing was average.\n\n\"If Cricket is a religion then Sachin is God\"\n\nThe film is dedicated to the most loved and respected Cricketer in the entire world. It begins with Sachin's farewell speech which made the entire nation weep. The film also can be summed up by a quote by Sachin “Enjoy the game, chase your dreams, because dreams do come true”. Its not just applicable to Cricket, but people aspiring to enter any field.\n\nIts an enlightening, emotional, entertaining journey dedicated by a group of Sachin fans to the legend, and the cricket hungry nation\n\nRating: 3.75/5\n\nVerdict: Very Good\n\nLast Word: Must Must Must Watch for fans of Sachin & Cricket\n\nBhaiyya [Yevadu Malayalam Dub] - Movie Review\n\nCrew\n\nDirected by Vamsi Paidipally\n\nProduced by Dil Raju\n\nWritten by Vamsi Paidipally, Abburi Ravi\n\nScreenplay by Vamsi Paidipally\n\nStory by Vakkantham Vamsi\n\nMusic by Devi Sri Prasad\n\nCinematography Shyam K. Naidu\n\nStudio Sri Venkateswara Creations\n\nDistributed by Percy Pictures\n\nRelease dates 31 January 2014\n\nCast\n\nRam Charan Teja as Satya / Ram / Charan\n\nShruti Haasan as Manju\n\nAmy Jackson as Shruthi\n\nAllu Arjun as Satya (Cameo)\n\nKajal Aggarwal as Deepthi (Cameo)\n\nSai Kumar as Dharma\n\nRahul Dev as Dheeru Bhai\n\nKota Srinivasa Rao\n\nShashank as Shashank\n\nJayasudha\n\nBrahmanandam\n\nBhayya deals with story of Satya & Charan. Satya & Deepthi, who are madly in love with each other, while trying to escape from the hands of a local don gets brutally injured by his henchman. Even though Deepthi gets killed Satya survives, but with severe burn injuries. Doctors order skin grafting to save Sathya and he gets the face of an unknown who died on the same day. After few months getting recovered from the injuries Sathya comes back for revenge. How he takes on the bad guys, whose face is Sathya currently donning, what's his story, forms the rest of film.\n\nEven though its a typical Telugu mass masala revenge story its the writing that makes the film a good entertainer. The film has elemnts inspired from films like 'face Off' 'Thirupachi' etc. The intelligent scripting coupled with racy narration is the biggest plus of Bhayya. The way Sathya draws out the villains and gets his revenge is interestingly done. Even though its falls to the usual track in the 2nd half its in the later half that we get few of the most powerful & emotionally charged scenes and dialogues in the movie. The film is a much better entertainer than Raccha & Nayak IMO.\n\nLogic seems missing here and there, but since its a crime to watch Mass Masala films with brain,that topic can be left alone tagged 'Cinematic Liberty'. Thank fully over the top action sequences has been limited to a greater extent. The violence, glamor quotient also doesn't go over board.\n\nRam Charan delivers efficiently what was required of him - Dancing, bashing up goons, mouthing punch dialogues etc. Jaya Sudha gets a powerful role, even though mainly limited to 2nd half. Allu Arjun fans will be disappointed as he hardly there for 15 mins, even though every single poster had him with prominence.[Still don't know why the film was titled Bhaiyya My Brother] Among the heroines its Kajal, who comes in a short role, that impresses, Shruthi & Amy were limited to usual glam dolls. Rest of the cast did their jobs okay.\n\nDirection & writing were good. Usual revenge story told/presented in an entertaining manner. Songs except the first one were average. Background score was good. Cinematography was efficient and editing was crisp.\n\nIn all Bhaiyya has 'everything' you expect from a Telugu mass entertainer.\n\nRating: 3/5\n\nVerdict: Good\n\nLast Word: Would have loved a bit more of Allu Arjun\n\nMannar Mathai Speaking 2 - Malayalam Movie Review\n\nDirected by Mamas\n\nProduced by Siby Thottupuram, Joby Mundamattom\n\nMusic by Rahul Raj\n\nStudio SJM Entertainment.\n\nRelease dates 24th January, 2014\n\nCountry India\n\nLanguage Malayalam\n\nCast\n\nInnocent as Mannar Mathai\n\nMukesh as Gopalakrishnan\n\nSaikumar as Balakrishnan\n\nVijayaraghavan as Ramji Rao\n\nBiju Menon as Mahendra Varma\n\nJanardhanan as Garvasees Aashan\n\nIndrans as Ponnappan\n\nPriyanka as Shakunthala\n\nShammi Thilakan\n\nAparna Gopinath\n\nAkshitha\n\nKalabhavan Shajon\n\nMannar Mathai Speaking 2 deals with another episode in the lives of Ma-Go-Ba [Mathai, Gopapalakrishnan & Balakrishnan]. The 3 after events from MMS have moved on in their lives & are now running 'Urvashi Travels'. Even though the bid adieu to their passion theater(Drama), Mathai still has the heart of a thespian drama artist who wants to get on stage for one final time to celebrate 25th anniversary of 'Urvashi Theaters'. That's when few characters in the past, along with a couple of new, enters their lives with fresh set of troubles. How the 3 tackle them, like the other 2 movies, forms the rest of the story.\n\nRRS, MMS are regarded as comedy classics, with everyone remembering most of the iconic scenes & dialogues from both the movies, quite evident from the response of people whenever such scenes were shown in between. So a sequel to those movies will be having expectations, but the experiences of most of the sequels that came in recently in Mollywood were not good, except 2 Hari Har Nagar, & MMS 2 manages to squece right in between.\n\nMMS 2 is a decent entertainer that isn't boring or lagging. If you go without any expectations it can be a pleasure ride. The film doesn't boast of a unique story or narration, it just sticks to the basic idea of sequels to make some quick bucks, but unlike many others this one manages to entertain, thanks to the charm of the characters.They have brought in almost al the important characters in previous 2 possibly that they could possibly do [missing were Mamukoya, Harisree Asokan etc]. The film is better than most of the so 'called' comedies that Mollywood churn out every year. It has got quite good, double meaning free, laughs.\n\nIts Innocent who shines through out, who looks also pretty same. Even though Mukesh & Sai Kumar has grown much as actors and psychically, the charm and fun is till there. Both villains of previous movies Ramji Rao & Mahendra Varma gets quirky twists, which were well done IMO.\n\nSongs are disappointing, BG was okay. Camera Editing were efficient. Direction was average, Scripting was intelligent, in the sense that without anything out of the box a decent entertainer was churned out. Liked the way scenes of Cochin Haneefa, Machan Varghese & Kaduvakulam Anto were used as a tribute to them, even though would have liked a 'remembrance' in the titles.\n\nWatch it to have some nice time and see the loved characters once again on screen\n\nRating 2.75/5\n\nVerdict: Above Average\n\nLast Word: Decent Comedy Entertainer, with no New Gen elements\n\nJai HO - Exclusive Movie Review\n\nThursday, January 23, 2014\n\nJAI HO : Exclusive Movie Review\n\nProduced by Sohail Khan / Sunil Lulla\n\nDirected by Sohail Khan\n\nWritten by A R Murugadoss\n\nScreenplay by Dilip Shukla\n\nMusic by Sajid-Wajid/Devi Sri Prasad/Amal Malik\n\nStars: Salman Khan, Tabu, Danny Denzongpa, Daisy Shah, Pulkit Samrat, Ashmit Patel & Mahesh Manjrekar\n\nMovie Review by Sree Prasad Nair\n\nTheater – Al Wahda Cinemas, Abu Dhabi, UAE\n\n23/01/2014 – 9.30pm\n\nJai Ho is one of the most anticipated film of 2014, Thanks to Salman Khan's absence on screen last year. Infact 2013 is the only year without no Salman Khan film in his 25+years career.The actor's last film Dabangg2 released on December 21, 2013. Eventhough the film was striclty average, still it collected a huge 150+cr at the box office. Well that's the impact of the star. He is undoubtedly going through the best phase of his career. All of his last 5 films were 130cr+ plus blockbusters at the box office. Salman will be aiming for his 6th blockbuster in a row with Jai Ho.\n\nJai Ho is directed by Salman's brother Sohail Khan. Salman Khan resurrect his brother Arbaaz Khan's career with Dabangg2 and he's repeating the same for his younger brother with Jai Ho. Jai Ho stars Salman Khan, Tabu, Danny Denzongpa, Daisy Shah, Pulkit Samrat, Ashmit Patel & Mahesh Manjrekar with Genelia D'Souza and Suniel Shetty playing cameos in the film. Jai Ho is a remake of 2006 Hit Telugu film, Stalin.\n\nSTORY\n\nThe only mission in Jai's (Salman Khan's) life is to help others and make the world a better place. It turns out that Jai served as a Major in the Indian Army. Although a war hero, he had quit the army when he disobeys his boss during a terrorist operation. His family includes mother as well as his sister (Tabu), who is not on talking terms with their mother since she got married against her mother's wishes.\n\nJai helps a physically challenged girl (Genelia) to write her Intermediate examination. One day there is no one to write on her behalf and she commits suicide. Her suicide disturbs him. Then he plans a chain system. The theme works on a principle that everyone should help others and in return they should not seek a mere gratitude but tell those who get the help to help three more, with a condition that those who get help from them should also demand the same. Jai thinks that this chain will develop helping attitude among the people. But, to his dismay, Jai finds that the chain did not work.\n\nOn one occasion, Jai bashes a rich boy, who injured a beggar. This goes in chain reaction and the rich boy employs some goons to attack Jai. As Jai disappears from the scene, the goons take away Jai's sister and her friend(played by Daisy Shah). Jai reaches the spot and hacks the hand of one goon. That goon happens to be the henchman of an MLA (Mukul Dev) who is also the son-in-law of Home Minister (Danny Denzongpa). The Home Minister takes it as a prestige issue and tries to eliminate Jai but loses his son in the process.\n\nWhen the Chief Minister intervenes to bring in a negotiation, the Home Minister plans to kill him and implicate Jai in the murder. Finally the truth prevails and the Chief Minister returns to the hospital to visit Jai, that the help three people concept was his brainchild, which saved him from death in the form of a school girl. Jai comes to know that his \"help three people\" concept worked well and the same theme saved his life in the form of auto driver (Mahesh Manjrekar).\n\nPositives\n\nJai Ho is a Total Salmania All The Way! Infact way better than his Bodyguard, Ek Tha Tiger & Dabangg2 avatars. Reviewing a Salman Khan is no use as the star is critic proof and darling of bollywood box office. Salman Khan as Jai is his most powerful role after the Radhe Mohan of Tere Naam & Chulbul Pandey of Dabangg. Jai Ho belongs to him, who scorches and roars on the screen every time he displays the manic anger. The introduction of Salman Khan is spell-binding, followed by superb choreographed 'Baaki First Class' song. The last 20minutes just before the interval was rocking. Salman Khan once again proved that he is unbeatable when it comes to action. The whole second half is an example. A PAISA VASOOL\n\nPERFORMANCE!\n\nAnother positive of the film is Tabu and she was very convincing as Salman's sister. The young kid, Master Naman Jain is outstanding as Salman's Nephew. He contributes enormously to some of the best moments of the film, just like his role in Chillar Party. His one liners are first rate.Danny Denzongpa is good. Pulkit Samrat is confident and proficient.\n\nDebutant Daisy Shah is stricly ok. Salman Khan real life friends Ashmit Patel, Mahesh Manjrekar, Aditya Pancholi, Mohnish Bahl are good. Raj Babbar's wife Nadira Babbar as Salman's mother is funny and lovable.\n\nBaaki Sab First Class Hai song is already a chartuster, with superb choreography. Dialogues are very good and action sequences were brilliantly executed especially during the introduction scene of salman Khan.\n\nNegatives\n\nThe music is a huge let down. Salman Khan films are always famous for hit songs. But this time pretty average songs. First 3 songs were poorly filmed and placed at the wrong time.Few action sequences are over the top especially at the climax without any logic.\n\nUnfortunately Salman's chemistry with Daisy Shah is simply not working. No scope for romantic angle between them. Daisy Shah's introduction scene/dance/song was unnecessary. Her performance was quite bad in the first half with terrible expressions.\n\nTalented stars like Genelia D'souza and Suniel Shetty were wasted in poor cameos. Also for Sana Khan. The first half of the film was boring (except the last 20mins). Direction by Sohail Khan is as expected very bad.\n\nBut like I mentioned earlier \"Salman Khan is bigger than any script or critic or star rating. His name is enough to rake in big money at the box office.\n\nOn the whole, Jai Ho is a DHAMAAL entertainer with SALMANIA all the way. Film is all releasing on huge 5000 screens which means 100crore will be crossed within 3-4 days. An opening day number of 26-30 crore is easily on the cards. For me Jai Ho will easily become Salman Khan's biggest blockbcuter till date and easily cross the 200crore mark. Just like Salman's roar in the film, A ROARING BLOCKBUSTER!\n\nP:S: Direction Kharaab Hai, Salman Khan First Class Hai!!!!\n\nVerdict - 2014's First 200 crore Blockbuster is here...\n\nRating - 3/5 A ROARING BLOCKBUSTER!!!\n\nThis Reviewer can be contacted on Twitter : @i_spn : https://twitter.com/i_spn\n\nSalala Mobiles - Exclusive Malayalam Movie Review\n\nCrew\n\nDirected by Sharath A. Haridaasan\n\nProduced by Anto Joseph\n\nBanner Anto Joseph Film Company\n\nWritten by Sharath A. Haridaasan\n\nMusic by Gopi Sunder\n\nCinematography Satheesh M Kurup\n\nDistributed by Aan Mega Media\n\nRelease dates 23 January 2014\n\nCountry India\n\nLanguage Malayalam\n\nCast\n\nDulquer Salmaan as Afsal\n\nNazriya Nazim as Shahana\n\nSanthanam as Alakarsami\n\nJacob Gregory as Benoy\n\nSiddique\n\nGeetha\n\nNarayanankutty\n\nJanardanan\n\nMamukkoya\n\nJose\n\nTini Tom\n\nRaveendran\n\nSalala Mobiles tells the love story of Afsal & Sahaana coming from families who are at the extreme ends, economically. Afsal runs a mobile shop named 'Salala Mobiles' setup with the help of his uncle & Shahana visits the shop regularly to recharge her mobile. At the very first sight of Shahana, Afsal fell head over heels in Love . The story gets a small twist with the entry of Alakarsamy, a tech freak who develops a special kind of app which change the course of their lives.\n\nSalala Mobiles is your usual rich girl poor boy Rom-Com + Family drama. But had it sticked to that genre the film would have atleast been passed as a breezy time pass entertainer. Instead the writer (who is also the director) added plots and sub plots which are not only confusing but irritating at many parts. Even though promoted as Rom-Com the film has very few of both, or at least the viewer feels that way thanks to the inconsistent writing and shoddy narration.\n\nThe first half is comparatively watchable, the second half completely goes down the barrel and the movie ends suddenly with an unconvincing climax.\n\nDulquer Salmaan was okay as Afsal but we have seen quite a few of similar roles from the actor and it is high time that he chose something different, these kind of roles have become sort of cake walk for him. Imagine the horror of heroine getting sidelined in a ROm-Com, thats the fate of Nazriya in Salala. Even in the few scenes got, she just had to look good. Being a Santhanam fan, really felt this houldn't have been his debut film/role in Mollywood, even though he was good. Gregory provided the comic relief, writer tried to cash in on the ABCD duo and it worked, one of the quite few reliefs the film offered. Rest of the 'too many' cast did what they just had to do, nothing significant.\n\nSharath's debut as a director could gave us only a half baked product, thanks to the script written by himself (His previous script was Jayaraj's 'Rain Rain Come Again', which ended up a disaster)\n\nExcept the title song other tracks didn't quite live upto the expectations, Gopi Sundar disappointed in that aspect but did okay job with background score. Cinematography was good, specially the songs. Editing was decent.\n\nSalala Mobiles offers nothing much, except may be for the die hard fans. The combo of Dulquer-Nazriya will help the film to take a huge opening but after that matters looks tough for the film.\n\nRating: A very generous 2.5/5\n\nVerdict: 'Average'\n\nLast Word: This Number won't be reachable for long, so fans better rush to theaters before it goes out of coverage area."
