        "text": "There have been various movies based on patriotism but this film is different, we are talking about the upcoming film Khatoon which will depict the love story of a valiant 1962 Indo-China war Indian soldier. The protagonist Santosh Shukla of Jai Ho fame is making his debut as main lead in this movie.\n\nThe new find Rewati Chetri will play his love interest. It’s set during the then Chinese occupied Tawang (Arunachal Pradesh) and the plot focuses on some fateful arrangements that make the two war enemies have a raging love affair.\n\nSantosh has sported a new look, he had first gone bald and now he has grown slight hair for getting into the skin of the Indian Army Officer’s character. He has thoroughly researched on subjects related to what actually happened during the Indo China War.\n\nThe much awaited movie Khatoon is going on floors now in Manali and during this current period we are also witnessing heightened tensions between India and China. Khatoon is Produced by Anita Agarwal and Utkarash Agarwal and is Directed by Ram Ramesh Sharma. It will release in 2018.\n\nIt has been a custom for Bollywood actors and filmmakers to seek the blessings of the Lord Ganesha at Siddhivinayak Mandir before commencing their work for a movie. Similarly, Santosh Shukla, the protagonist of this 1962 Indo China war based movie Khatoon went to Siddhivinayak temple at Prabhadevi, Mumbai along with the beautiful female lead Rewati Chetri and the Cast and Crew to offer their prayers to God and seek his divine blessings!\n\nIt was indeed a welcome sight to see Santosh, Rewati and the Khatoon team at the Siddhivinayak temple in devotional spirit and surrendering to the Almighty before they left for Manali !"
