Ten years after this, everyone is occupied and turn busy. Rishabh (Sumeet Vyas) proposes Kalindi and all the Veeres meet for her wedding. The rest of Veere Di Wedding is all about how their lives changed and what happens next. Watch Veere Di Wedding to know about the rest. Analysis : Veere Di Wedding has its moments but it only appeals and connects with a few sections who went through the stage. But the film has been completely entertaining and has a huge dose of adult stuff. The songs have been a treat to watch and Veere Di Wedding has a decent first half which has been completely focused on the gala gang and their noise. Veere Di Wedding has some genuine fun that happens between the girls. The second half of Veere Di Wedding turns emotional and discusses about the challenges with the dose of entertainment coming down. With four parallel tracks running, the director has been confused at times and there have been several unwanted episodes during the second half. Some of the episodes look thoroughly entertaining and engaging but soon the film dips down. On the whole, Veere Di Wedding has its moments but will appeal to a small section of audience. Final Word: Veere Di Wedding is a gala ride by a bunch of girls but it will appeal to a limited set of audience. Kareena Kapoor has been brilliant.

Veere Di Wedding 2.75/5\n\n22. 22 WWW.CINESPRINT.COM | JULY 2018 EVIEW BOLLYWOOD Story : Race 3 is all about the family of Shamsher Singh (Anil Kapoor). There are some internal disputes between Shamsher’s step son Sikandar (Salman Khan) and twin children Sanjana (Daisy Shah) & Suraj (Saqib Saleem). It is during this time Yash (Bobby Deol) makes his presence as Sikandar's body guard and Jessica (Jacqueline Fernandez) as his girlfriend. Going with the conflicts, Shamsher takes up a deal and the rest of Race 3 is all about what happens next. Watch the film to know about the entire story. Analysis : Race 3 looks packed with a bunch of actors all around but it lacks the much needed basic plot. The film's director Remo D'Souza managed to copy the formula of Race with high voltage action stunts and stylish cars, but he missed a strong conflict point. The first half has been so bad and boring that every episode has been predictable. Too many songs turn barriers and they spoil the seriousness of the movie. The entire first half is a boring feast and seems stretched enough. The second half of Race 3 too misses the expectations by miles and leaves the audience in huge disappointment. The action episodes have been outstanding and are the major highlights of the film. The cinematography has been a treat to watch and the pre-climax episodes will leave the audience confusing. The climax has been pale and the second half of Race 3 is a huge disappointment. Final Word: After Jai Ho and Tubelight, Salman Khan gets a break for his success streak through Race 3. A film that lacks interesting plot and meaningful execution. After Jai Ho and Tubelight, Salman Khan gets a break for his success streak through Race 3.

Sudheer Babu and Aditi Rao Hydari are a treat to watch. Sammohanam 2.75/5 Story : Sammohanam is the story of Vijay (Sudheer Babu) who dreams of getting his first book published and is a children book writer. When Vijay has no good thoughts about films, his father (Naresh) is a movie buff and he rents a lavish villa for film shoots. It is during this time, Vijay meets Sameera Rathod (Aditi Rao Hydari) who is an upcoming actress. He turns a Telugu coach for Sameera and they bond well as time passes. In a shocking move, Sameera rejects Vijay and the rest of Sammohanam is about the past of the actress and what happens next. Analysis : Sammohanam has a decent first half which narrates about the lead characters and their behavior. Naresh’s comic timing is a treat to watch and he has been outstanding. The songs are a treat to watch and they have been placed well. The on screen romance between Sudheer Babu and Aditi Rao Hydari is a treat and the first half of Sammohanam looks good and passable. The slow pace is the only barrier and this may not go well with some of the audience. The film turns completely emotional during the second half and rattles down in pace. The flashback episodes have been well narrated but the film lacks a strong conflict point and it dips down as it nears completion. The pre-climax episodes have been based completely on entertainment and the climax episodes have simple. It is the performances and the music that keeps the second half of Sammohanam alive. Final Word: Sammohanam is a feel good romantic entertainer which goes on a snail pace because of which it may not appeal to everyone. Sudheer Babu and Aditi Rao Hydari are a treat to watch.\n\n26. 26 WWW.CINESPRINT.COM | JULY 2018 EVIEW TOLLYWOOD Story : Ee Nagaraniki Emaindi is the story of Vivek (Vishwak Sen), Karthik (Sushanth Reddy), Kaushik (Abhinav Gomatam) and Upendra (Venkatesh Kakumanu) who are aspiring youngsters and childhood buddies.

The rest of the film is how they make it big and what happens next forms the story of Ee Nagaraniki Emaindi. Watch the film to know about the real story. Analysis : Ee Nagaraniki Emaindi has a decent first half which has been based on entertainment mostly. With a thin plot, Tharun Bhascker made sure he reaches the urban youth. With funny one-liners and lot of English, Ee Nagaraniki Emaindi will not appeal to front seaters. The songs have been boring and the interval episodes look interesting. On the whole, the first half of Ee Nagaraniki Emaindi is not a letdown but it should have been better. The second half of Ee Nagaraniki Emaindi has been filled with a bunch of unwanted episodes that spoils the flavour of the film. The songs too make the audience irritating and it is the entertainment and the funny one-liners that save the film. The performances by the lead actors has been a fresh breath for the audience. The climax of Ee Nagaraniki Emaindi looks interesting and the film ends up on a decent note. Final Word: Ee Nagaraniki Emaindi will have a limited appeal because of the genre that has been tipped with urban entertainment. Second half has been slow paced and boring indeed.

Beauty With Brain Malayalam actress Anupama Parameshwaran has been busy with several movies. After back to back hits, the actress raced to the top slot. Her next film Tej: I Love You featuring Sai Dharam Tej and Anupama Parameshwaran is hitting the screens on July 6th. A Karunakaran is the director and KS Rama Rao is the producer. Anupama Parameshwaran 33 WWW.CINESPRINT.COM | JULY 2018\n\n34. Exclusive Interview Here is a candid interview of Anupama Parameshwaran: How are you sustaining the competition in Tollywood? Competition is a must in every field. This is when the best in you comes out. I am aware of all the heroines and what work they are doing. I closely follow them and performances like Keerthy Suresh in 'Mahanati', Aditi Rao in 'Sammohanam' inspire me heavily. I learn from them and try to do my best. Were you upset when you were kicked out of 'Rangasthalam'? Yes! a bit. I couldn't do the film for several reasons and now that I have seen the film, I feel that no one except Samantha would have done the role of Rama Lakshmi better than her. She was in another space in the film and I am happy that the role went to her. Describe your role in 'Tej I Love U'? This is the first time that I am doing such a hot-tempered role. I try to dominate everyone in the film and it has been a learning experience to portray such new roles. The way Karunakaran sketched my character was good and I couldn't say no to it. You can say that everyone will see a new version of me this film. Can we see you in glamorous roles? As of now, everyone wants to see me only in the girl next door roles. I am game to do glamour roles and am very confident that I can carry out myself in a very glamorous way without looking vulgar. Only the directors need to approach me with such roles. A word about Sai Dharam Tej? He is a very down to earth and hardworking person. I had a tough time dancing with him in this film. He is so flawless and this type of commercial dances was new to me. But somehow, I managed with the help of my choreographers. Looks like you have caught a good grip on Telugu. How did that happen? I have by the grace of God. The moment I found out that I am going to be here in Telugu cinema for some time now, I made sure that I learned the language well. Also, my first director Trivikram garu helped me a lot during the making of 'A Aa'. Are you game for cameos? What's there in doing special roles. An actor just needs a powerful scene to showcase their talent. I always feel that If you manage to do your role well, you will automatically be noticed by all.

This sector indicates creative projects and you may have some. Please try to go an extra mile in performing in these; otherwise, you may have some rework. Please give extra care in own ventures as well. You may get opportunities to work with children and youth groups. SCORPIO Mars will be in a slowdown mode during this entire month. This planet will be moving through the sector for home, family, ancestors, parents and ancestral property. You have to be very practical in dealing with your family matters, because Mars is not in a comfortable mode. So, you have to be very careful with your family matters and personal life. SAGITTARIUS Mars, the planet of courage and energy will be in a slowdown mode for the entire month. This move will trigger the sector for short trips, short courses, training, siblings, media, technology, electronics, and writing. Whenever any planet is in a slowdown mode, then there will be a lot of rework. You will have some projects from communication and media related domains. Please cross check everything before final submission. AQUARIUS Mars, the warrior of the zodiac will be in a slowdown mode for the entire month and it will impact your personal life and happiness. Whenever a planet moves in a slowdown mode, then you will have to do a retrospect. You may visit your past and analyze your actions. This may be not an easy phase, but for retrospect and analysis, this is going to be a best time. 151 WWW.CINESPRINT.COM | JULY 2018\n\n152.
