        "text": "Did qawwali die with Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan and the Sabri brothers?\n\nThe melodious voice became clearer as I walked towards the shrine. And just as I started up the stairs separating the dust of the polluted world from the spiritual atmosphere of the place, the lyrics became discernible as well,\n\n“Tajdar-e-Haram, O Nigah-e-Karam...” (King of the Haram, look upon us with mercy...)\n\nAs strong as commentary can ever be, this poetry has always inspired reverence in faulted souls. [caption id=\"\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"503\"] Not more than a decade ago traditional qawwali was still thriving and the best place to listen to qawwalis was not a privately organised concert but these very publically hosted urs. Photo: Badar Chaudhary[/caption] And yet, something was amiss this time. Although not exactly a connoisseur myself, I was still able to tell that the singers trying to emulate the ‘Princes of Qawwals’ – the Sabri brothers – were amateurs who lacked the necessary schooling. A place that had been frequented by Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan while he was alive and then by his nephew, Rahat Fateh Ali Khan for many years since, had to make do with these local makeshift kinds who would most likely be delivering mail or undertaking similar jobs in the morning. [embed width=\"620\"]http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x150xyo_nusrat-fateh-ali-khan-sochta-hoon-ke-woh-kitne-masoom-they_music[/embed] Disappointment engulfed me as it had on multiple occasions before this also, followed by nostalgia setting in for the days not more than a decade ago when this genre was still thriving and the best place to listen to qawwalis was not a privately organised concert but these very publically hosted urs. [caption id=\"\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"600\"] Crowd gathers at the shrine of Kalyam Shareef. Photo: Badar Chaudhary[/caption] Similar to the educational standards and the economy, the culture of the country has also become hostage to the quickly diffusing society, which espouses all that it can of western norms and Arab prejudices. That two such distinctive creeds are the cause behind the downfall for the conventional qawwali is surprising but such is the story of Pakistan. The modernists – holding on to the complexes of a colonised nation – have become disillusioned with their own music while the conservatives – deeming everything Arab as ‘Islamic’ – have embraced all that this culture has to offer. The movement towards a more literal interpretation of Islam and the contrasting globalisation which reeks of western values and principles have simultaneously chipped away at the identity and core values of Pakistan. Qawwali is also such a casualty. The transition from a rural to an urbanised society rendered a majority incapable of enjoying the simple pleasures of life. The pace of life quickened. Much like the shift from Test cricket to T20s and the reduction in the length of movies, the qawwalis were shortened to satiate the fluctuating tastes. This was followed by an influx of western rock and pop which slowly started pervading the market. And as it happened, in spite of the aesthetic appeal of the traditional qawwalis, with the exception of a few names, the genre could never achieve commercial success. And thus the metamorphoses began. The fusion in itself would not have been detrimental to the interests of the genre but the neglectful attitude that followed was. Thus, the ‘modern’ version of the qawwali was introduced which gelled together flawless voices with guitars and pianos to attract the majority. Understandably, it was an instant success. Trained musicians immediately embraced the change and began to produce music which was very different from their own. Slowly, these money-making ventures became the sole aspiration and hence, the descent of traditional qawwali commenced. [embed width=\"620\"]http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x14kept_nusrat-fateh-ali-khan-tum-ek-gorakh-dhanda-ho_music[/embed] Since this ‘modern’ music allowed for imperfections in the voice to be covered, along came untrained singers to take up the genre for monetary gains. Traditionalists who took up the cause had failed to address the fact that although people still listened to Gorakh Dhanda and Sochta Hoon Ke Woh Kitnay Masoom The by Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan even decades later, not many are aware of his efforts with Michael Brooks – such as Intoxicated, Sweet Pain and Crest. https://soundcloud.com/qasim-m-dogar/ustad-nusrat-fateh-ali-khan-4 This should have served as a caveat to the changing times that despite the commercial success of such efforts, this novel music was ephemeral. [embed width=\"620\"]http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x15c8ju_intoxicated-nusrat-fateh-ali-khan-and-michael-brook-night-songs_music[/embed] But it did not. And if there were any hope alive owing to the few and far in-between who held onto the traditional qawwali for its association with Sufism and being a potent expression of love for God, it was to be dismissed by the precipitous growth of ‘religious’ scholars propagating the orthodox Arab interpretation of Islam. [caption id=\"\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"416\"] Our culture has also become hostage to the quickly diffusing society, which espouses all that it can of western norms and Arab prejudices. Photo: Badar Chaudhary[/caption] A majority of hitherto uneducated and gullible souls were convinced beyond reparation that what they had been doing all their lives was strictly forbidden in the very religion that they yearned to serve. https://soundcloud.com/qasim-m-dogar/ustad-nusrat-fateh-ali-khan-1 This was the last nail in the coffin. It is thus, that the qawwals – well-trained in the art and associated with the traditional version of the genre – are diminishing by the day. In a country mired in a multitude of more serious problems, conventional qawwali is silently dying away. Incidentally there does exist a ministry of heritage. However, there is no commotion in the concerned quarters to make any efforts to salvage this age-old tradition. I wonder if the incumbent minister, Pervaiz Rasheed, has more important businesses to attend to.\n\n↧\n\n↧\n\nKarri Pakora: Finger lickin’ good, literally!\n\nKarriis loved in almost every household in Pakistan. But the cooking procedure can intimidate even the most well seasoned and skilled cooks. I learnt how to make it whilstwatching my mother cookit in her kitchen. But my love for karri goes back to my barri ammi’s (maternal grandmother) cooking skills and generosity. In her house, the rule was simple. Karri was never cooked in medium or moderate quantity. It was always cooked as if 30 people were coming over for dinner. Bari Ammi would send a bowl each to all her friends and relatives living close by. Hence, her karri was not just loved because it was delicious but because she would remember everyone around her while cooking it. It is strange how such insignificant observations shape a young mind. Till date I have never cooked it for myself alone. I have always made enough for it to be shared with my friends too. Therefore, cooking karri is more like a religious ritual to me than cooking a procedure-intensive dish. This recipe was a challenge for me to compile as I am used to cooking karri in larger quantities only. It took a bit of an effort to scale it down even though it’s a very simple dish to make. The cooking procedure is broken down into two parts. The trick is to finish making the gravy first and add the pakoras later. But the cooking preparation should be done before hand so there isn’t a long gap between cooking the gravy and adding the pakoras to it because the curry gets thicker as it cools down. You need to ensure the pakoras are added before the gravy cools down and thickens. So here we go: For the gravy you will need the following ingredients: Chickpea flour (Baisan) – 1 cup Yogurt – 500 grams Oil – ½ cup Onion – 3 medium-sized (chopped) Tomatoes – 3 to 4 medium sized Ginger/Garlic paste – 1 tbsp Cumin (zeera) – ½ tsp Dried red chillies – 2 to 3 Green chillies – 1 to 2 Curry leaves – 4 to 6 fresh ones or 3 to 4 dry ones Salt – 1 tsp (adjust it according to taste) Chilli powder – 1 tbsp Turmeric – ½ tsp Water – 3 cups [caption id=\"\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"553\"] Photo: Ambreen Malik[/caption] Method: 1) In a blender/liquidiser, pour 500 grams of yogurt, two cups of water and one cup of chickpea flour. Blend it. This is the mixture for the gravy. [caption id=\"\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"320\"] Photo: Ambreen Malik[/caption] 2) In a blender, add the tomatoes and green chillies, blend to make a purée. [caption id=\"\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"363\"] Photo: Ambreen Malik[/caption] 3) Heat some oil in a cooking pot. Now add the chopped onions and let them brown. 4) As the onions turn brown, add the ginger/garlic paste, cumin and dried red chillies. [caption id=\"\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"320\"] Photo: Ambreen Malik[/caption] 5) As soon as the ginger/garlic paste turns golden, add the tomato purée, salt, red chilli powder and turmeric. 6) Now cook this mixture till the tomatoes are well done and the oil separates on the sides. [caption id=\"\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"320\"] Photo: Ambreen Malik[/caption] 7) Add the blended yogurt and chickpea mixture into the cooking pot. 8) Pay attention to the smell. It will smell like raw chickpea flour for around 10 minutes. Keep stirring continuously as the flour can burn from the bottom. The gravy needs to boil for at least 30 minutes on medium flame before the raw smell disappears. [caption id=\"\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"320\"] Photo: Ambreen Malik[/caption] 9) Add the remaining one cup of water (or more if it’s too dry) to the mixture as it boils. You will notice that the gravy’s consistency will start to change similar to a hot custard. It should cover the back of the spoon with a thin film. [caption id=\"\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"320\"] Photo: Ambreen Malik[/caption] 10) Now leave the gravy on low flame on your stove and cover it with a lid. It should stay hot but not boil as the water will vaporise. It’s time to make the pakoras. Ingredients: Chickpea flour (Baisan) – 1 cup Baking powder – 1 tsp Cumin seed (zeera) – 1 tsp (crushed in a pastel mortar) Dried coriander seeds – 1 tbp (crushed in a pastel mortar) Onion – 1 small-sized (chopped) Salt – 1 tsp Crushed red chillies – ½ tsp (adjust if you want pakoras to be spicy) Fresh coriander – handful (chopped) Fresh mint – handful (chopped) Green chillies – 1 tsp (finely chopped) Water – half cup Oil for deep frying the pakoras. [caption id=\"\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"320\"] Photo: Ambreen Malik[/caption] Method: We have all made pakoras a million times in our kitchen. This is no different. The tricky part of the karri is already done. 1) Put a wok/frying pan on the stove with plenty of oil for deep frying. The oil must be hot before the batter hits it. 2) In a bowl, add the chickpea flour, baking powder, salt, crushed red chillies, cumin seeds and crushed coriander seeds. [caption id=\"\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"320\"] Photo: Ambreen Malik[/caption] 3) Slowly add water and whisk the batter. The consistency should be thick. Be careful with the water. Make sure you add less water because when you add the onion later, the water from the fresh onions will add on to the batter. 4) Once it is mixed, add onions, green chillies, coriander and mint. Mix thoroughly. [caption id=\"\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"320\"] Photo: Ambreen Malik[/caption] 5) Make the pakoras as soon as the batter is mixed. Keep the oil really hot. If the batter is left to sit, it will thin out and the pakoras will turn out flat and hard. 6) Spoon the mixture in hot oil one by one and make them golden brown on both sides. 7) Remove from the oil and drain them on a kitchen paper. Put them in the hot gravy immediately. Mix and cover the pot. [caption id=\"\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"320\"] Photo: Ambreen Malik[/caption] 8) Fry the next batch of pakoras and add them to the gravy the same way. 9) Leave the pakoras in the gravy for 15-20 minutes before dishing the karri out. The pakoras will absorb the liquid from the gravy and will become softer. [caption id=\"\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"320\"] Photo: Ambreen Malik[/caption] 10) Pour the dish in a large bowl and add a tarka with onions, cumin seeds and oil. Add fresh green chillies, mint and coriander for garnishing. [caption id=\"\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"653\"] Photo: Ambreen Malik[/caption] I usually find myself making a second round of batter for pakoras as the company around me usually gulps down half of the first batch before they can be added into the gravy. So make another batch of fresh batter and fry some more pakoras. I love eating karri with boiled basmati or regular rice as it becomes a wholesome meal. But if you prefer to have it with roti, that’ll be great as well. I must confess though, for me, the fun of eating karri is to roll my sleeves up, put a big helping of karri on a substantial heap of rice and digging in my fingers. The idea of finger lickin’ good is actually true! Give it a try! Enjoy this simple recipe for some delicious yet simple karri!

The name was eventually finalised as ‘Jai Ho’. [embed width=\"620\"]http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x18f85y_jai-ho-hd-hindi-movie-teaser-trailer-2014-salman-khan-video-dailymotion_shortfilms[/embed] The movie is a remake of the movie Stalin, a Tollywood film inspired by Pay It Forward (2000). The movie has a lot to offer to the common man, the ‘aam janta’ as they call it. It has drama, action, romance, comedy, weird songs, Salman Khan’s very own dancing style and, of course, Bollywood masala. [caption id=\"\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"501\"] Salman Khan and Daisy Shah. Photo: Reuters[/caption] Jai Ho revolves around Jai Agnihotri (Salman Khan), an ex-army officer who was court-martialled because of his bravery and for not following the orders of his superior-in-command Major Arjun (Sunil Shetty). Jai runs a motor garage and with his friends Babu (Yash Tonk) and Sumit (Ashmit Patel) helps the aam janta (common people) by saving them from the atyachaar (tyranny) of bad people. Accidently, Jai comes across the malicious politician Dashrat Singh (Danny Denzongpa) and his family of pitiless power-driven scoundrels (Mukul Dev, Sana Khan and Haroon Qazi). The rest is the cliché story of good winning over the evil. [caption id=\"\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"456\"] (Left to right) Naman Jain, Salman Khan, Sana Khan, Ashmit Patel and Yash Tonk. Photo: Reuters[/caption] The best thing about Jai Ho is that it has a cast which the viewers see after a hiatus. Even for brief roles, some big names of their times have been casted such as Sharad Kapoor, Mukul Dev, Aditya Pancholi, Nauheed Cyrusi, Vikas Bhalla, Tulip Joshi, Genelia Deshmukh, and Sameer Khakar along with Tabu, all of whom have been blessed with roles after a long gap. [caption id=\"\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"500\"] Tabu[/caption] After watching Jai Ho, one can easily understand that there is no one other than Salman Khan who can step effortlessly into the shoes of Sunny Deol. It won’t be wrong to call Salman a ‘Muslim Sher’ just the way Deol is referred to as ‘Punjaab Da Sher’ (Lion of Punjab). The action sequences shown in the movie are larger than life – the way Salman bhai flies, fights, twists and turns goons in the air can only be matched with the class that Deol or South Indian movies have. [caption id=\"\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"500\"] Salman Khan[/caption] Jai Ho offers a moral lesson too, ‘do good to three people in your life and ask them to pass on the kindness’. As far as the performances are concerned, this, like all of Khan’s movies, is a Salman Khan enterprise. He fights likes a tiger and roars like a lion, which at times sounded quite funny as well. But if you are a die-hard fan of Salman bhai, you would agree that something of similar idiocy, if performed by anyone else, would have been the reason for embarrassment and boredom in cinema halls. [caption id=\"\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"401\"] Salman Khan. Photo: Reuters[/caption] Tabu is, as always, composed, effective and effortless. She sparks wherever the high voltage scenes demanded the flash. Danny is perfect in his character and leaves an impact. Daisy Shah dances really well and looks gorgeously sexy in all the songs. [caption id=\"\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"415\"] Daisy Shah and Salman Khan. Photo: Reuters[/caption] Nadira Babbar (SalmanKhan’s mom) overacts and is very loud. On the other hand, there is not much to Aditya Panscholi’s role but he has a strong screen presence and his expressions are worth noticing. Dev and Qazi’s debuts are remarkable. Sameer Khakhar has returned to the screen after a very long time and truly gives a noteworthy performance. He should be given more roles, given the fact that Parinda was one of his finest movies. Naman Jain, who plays the role of Khan’s nephew, has a natural talent to act. This is his fourth movie, after Chillar Party, Raanjhana and Bombay Talkies, and he is simply a sweetheart. [caption id=\"\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"348\"] Salman Khan and Naman Jain. Photo: Reuters[/caption] Santosh Shukla (Manik) leaves a mark on the audience as well. Sudesh Lahiri manages to bring smiles on audiences’ faces whereas Pulkit Samrat adds freshness and delivers a very calculated performance. If you are planning to watch this movie, then leave your brain and thinking capabilities at home. You will be going to watch a movie with a lot of dhishoom and dhamakas, over the top (literally) fight sequences, flying bikes and mostly one man beating up the entire nation. Jai Ho is literally a new-age version of One Man Army and just a tribute to Deol’s Dhhai Kilo Ka Haath. In my opinion, this movie deserves a three out of five rating purely on the basis of performances, Salman-power and certain emotional scenes.\n\n↧\n\n10 awkward moments we have all been through\n\nWe aren’t perfect. We cannot always make witty remarks and indulge in interesting conversations all the time. All of us make the one off faux pas – tell someone they have bad body odour or say things jokingly only to have the other person offended. Sounds familiar? This happens all the time. If it weren’t for it, then you and I would be the only two people living a monotonous life. Being social animals, we can’t possibly avoid interaction. We will do things that are embarrassing or things that will put us in awkward positions. There are guidebooks and rules for such social etiquettes. But even if we memorise them by heart, we will not be able to dance to its tunes every day. There are so many of them that it is difficult to be on the right track. And sometimes, it’s just downright impossible. So here I am, not as an answer to your prayers but to tell you that there is basically no safe exit for such frivolities. Not even a memory eraser to help you get a clean slate… sigh. So rather than whining and feeling ashamed of things, let’s all understand that awkward is the new regular and we have to survive it. The thing you all need to understand and realise is that we will survive it and will laugh about it in the years to come. For now, lets’ just go down memory lane and recall the awkwardness. So here’s a list of the 10 most awkward moments we have all been through at least once in our lives. 1) When you try to make someone laugh... and fail miserably We were standing watching the end of a boring ceremony. It was out of the blue that I decided to share a joke to lighten the moment. I read the joke a few days back and it was still fresh in my mind, at least that’s what I thought. So I began. The joke went on for two minutes until I came to the punch line and then I waited for my friend to laugh at the joke. All she said was\n\n“That’s your joke?”\n\n[caption id=\"\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"500\"] Source: Blogspot[/caption] 2) Waving at a friend who doesn’t see you It’s alright. It has happened to everyone. With me it doesn’t end here. People other than my friends wave back at me and then I have to clarify that I wasn’t waving at them. People usually end up giving me a deadly look as if I’ve offended them. Am I offending them though? It’s just a wave, I promise! [caption id=\"\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"500\"] Source: Mrwgifs[/caption] 3) Pulling the push door and pushing the pull door It’s ok if you’re with your friends and they see you trying to comprehend the door signs. However, it gets really awkward when you keep on pushing the pull door for your teacher or other random people out of courtesy. [caption id=\"\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"500\"] Source: Tumblr[/caption] 4) Send the wrong text to the wrong person Yup, we’ve all definitely been there. It all starts with when you’re texting your BFF about how rude this shrewd, obnoxious, snob one of your classmates’ is and how you’d like to choke her only to realise that you’ve sent the text to that obnoxious classmate by mistake. Awkward doesn’t even begin to explain it. [caption id=\"\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"480\"] Source: Cinemagram[/caption] 5) Hugging and air-kissing is the new handshake All of us have old relatives we don’t want to hug or kiss for whatever reasons. But all your attempts are futile when you go for a handshake and they pull you for the hug instead, long ones I might add. I guess there’s a lot of love to go around. [caption id=\"\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"500\"] Source: Giphy.com[/caption] 6) While grocery shopping, you ask the salesperson the price of some product. Only to realise that he or she is just another customer like you. Awkwaaard! [caption id=\"\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"500\"] Source: Giphy.com[/caption] 7) When someone watches you write your old email address on your Facebook login page Pure embarrassment takes over, especially when it’s something like: - cutie_sweetness@xyz.com - rocker768@xyz.com - u&me4eva@xyz.com - lovebunny@xyz.com [caption id=\"\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"490\"] Source: mrwgifs.com[/caption] Or when you thought it was cool to spell your name with ‘x’ instead of a ‘z’ or ‘3’ instead of an ‘e’. *face palm* [caption id=\"\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"225\"] Source: Tumblr[/caption] 8) Sleeping in the office during work hours During my second week of a new job, I decided to get some shut eye for a bit. Just to rest my eyes, I swear. I must’ve been really tired though, because my boss had to tap my table thrice to wake me up. Luckily, he understood how everyone, including himself I’m sure, has these days and decided not to kick me or fire me. [caption id=\"\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"500\"] Source: Mrwgifs[/caption] 9) When people think you are your mom’s older sister One day, I decided to accompany my paternal aunt, who looks very young as compared to her age, to one of her friend’s wedding. The friend’s father, during the introduction, thought I was my aunt’s older sister. Yeah right! [caption id=\"\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"500\"] Source: Wordpress[/caption] I have also been on the giving end of this. One time, I assumed my friend’s mother was her grandmother, by mistake of course, and you can imagine how offended she must’ve been and how bad I must’ve felt. I didn’t even know how to apologise to my friend and her mother. [caption id=\"\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"500\"] Source: Goodreads.com[/caption] 10) Riding a qinchi and being stuck in the traffic jam This doesn’t need explaining at all. For those who don’t know what a qinchi is, it’s a type of a rickshaw attached to a motorcycle, where passengers sometimes sit with their backs towards the driver. [caption id=\"\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"500\"] Source: Wifflegif.com[/caption] I’m sure most of us have been through half or almost all of the above mentioned never-to-be-remembered-again moments. But I’m sure all of us cracked up while remembering all the things we did and all the awkward moments survived. I hope your trip down memory lane was as entertaining for you as it was for me.\n\n↧\n\nKarachi Burns Road: The Holy Grail for foodies\n\nThe waiter picked up my Naan. He saw my quizzical expression and said,\n\n“It’s not hot anymore. I am getting you a fresh one.”\n\nThen he comes back and asks in a solicitous whisper if I am enjoying myself. With such courtliness, how could I not? This Michelin star service was not at an exorbitantly priced restaurant. No, the setting of this delightful exchange was Waheed Nihari at Karachi’s Burns Road a.k.a. food paradise. Ernest Hemingway called Paris a moveable feast – in the same vein, Karachi is an immovable feast and Burns Road the location. The food capital of Pakistan is reputed to be Lahore. I beg to differ. Lahore has her temptations but Karachi’s place in gastronomic heaven is firm with her culinary repertoire running the gamut from Paye to pizza and ravioli to Rabri. To enlighten those who have not embarked on the food pilgrimage or haven’t gone outside their comfort zone, Burns Road is a street in the heart of the old part of Karachi and is famous for its traditional (read mouth-watering) food items such as Nihari, Haleem, Kebabs, fried fish and desserts such as Rabri and traditional drinks such as Lassi. If you take the road from the Urdu Bazaar and turn to the traffic light at the far end, you’ll enter the Holy Grail for foodies. During the day the road looks like any other main road with buses spewing smoke and pedestrians choking the sidewalks. But come night and the street metamorphoses into a cornucopia of savoury and sweet, awash in garish neon signs advertising the delectable offerings of each eating place. [caption id=\"\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"600\"] Photo: Sibtain Naqvi[/caption] It is serious eating here, with no fancy presentations or garnishes, just honest, good food that lures the eater into a bacchanal of gluttony. My first experience was no light hearted affair but a complete immersion in the victuals on offer. While perusing the various places, even the most casual observer will notice the predominance of restaurants that hark back to the city of Delhi. You can hear the echoes of Chandi Chawk and Nizammuddin and, in fact, I found more than a passing resemblance between a Nihari place here and the famous Karim restaurant in Delhi. According to senior denizens of the area, many people who migrated from Delhi to Karachi preferred to live on Burns Road.\n\n“In the 1950s, the newly migrated people were looking for dishes that were famous in Delhi and the shopkeepers of that time not only adapted the names and reproduced recipes of Delhi’s traditional fare but also decided to include the name Delhi while naming their shops to conjure an effect,” said Abbas Raza, an elderly resident of Burns Road.\n\nBefore partition, Rizwan’s grandfather was running a sweets shop near Jama Masjid Delhi and today he owns an establishment that is now known as Delhi Darbar Sweets. Many shops, including Rizwan’s, that opened in the late 1950s and early 1960s are still going strong and it is a testament to their popularity that even at four in the morning I have to get past a traffic jam to get some Nihari for my Sehri in Ramzan. [caption id=\"\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"600\"] Photo: Sibtain Naqvi[/caption] Waheed’s Nihari is probably the best known place and one bite of the hot, gelatinous concoction will make it clear why it is so. Perhaps the cleanliness of the floor might deter some, but do not be alarmed since the plates are incontestably clean. The ambience resonates with that of the fictional Weatherbury Inn from Thomas Hardy’s Far From the Madding Crowd, where the drinking cups are described in much the same vein. The rough hewn patrons mix happily with the affluent who are here partly because of nostalgia of student days but mostly drawn in by the siren call of the Nihari and the butter fried Kebabs. Opposite Waheed are two of the many gems in this treasure house, namely the Gulab Jamun maker and the fried fish seller. Names are withheld at their request but even I felt that the hot, deep fried treats should really be kept a secret. You can choose your fish and have it cut any way you desire. A slow dip in the searing oil, a sound of frying that’s music to my stomach, a squeeze of lemon, a pinch of spices and you will have your taste buds dancing in no time. The fish is fresh from the morning catch and the taste is enough to make the English swear off their bland version. [caption id=\"\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"402\"] Photo: Sibtain Naqvi[/caption] If Nihari or fish is not your thing then perhaps you will opt for the other import from across the border, Haleem. Mazedar Haleem, the city’s most famous Haleem seller, is head quartered here, as is Karachi Haleem. These people are no mere mortals but magicians who take the humble pulses, toss in a bit of meat and some spices and create a stew fit for a monarch and healthy to boot. Haleem was probably created to debunk the theory that anything hedonistic is bad for your health. You can even get it canned to send to your loved ones abroad or store it as rations for nuclear fallout. Even being encased in a lead bunker isn’t so bad if the canned supplies last so I usually have a few pounds of canned stuff lying around the house. Moving from the Delhi foodstuffs you come to the relative newcomer from the north, the Sajji. The meat, usually chicken or mutton, is minimally spiced and slowly cooked over a fire, then cut up and sprinkled with masala and lemon juice. Agha Sajji House and Al-Sajjad Sajji are two prominent places. The roaring fires and meat laden spits do whet your appetite and the droves of people munching away prove it to be so. [caption id=\"\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"600\"] Photo: Sibtain Naqvi[/caption] Burns Road caters to a variety of tastes, so capricious epicures need not worry. If snacks are what you are looking for then look no further than Fresco Sweets, famous for its Dahi Phulki which balances sweet and tart perfectly and the Phulkis seemingly made out of sunbeams and angel mist – so light that they can almost be inhaled in but with a burst of flavour that hits you and keeps lulling away long after you have had your fill. Burns Road is also host to some of the city’s famous sweet places too. Delhi Rabri House proves that Nihari and Haleem are not the only things the Delhites were adept at, for the Rabri here is sinfully good. Kulfi, ice cream, Faluda, and sweet milk are all on offer and awfully good too, but it’s the Rabri that brings in the customers. I was told that the maker has been making the same creamy stuff for over thirty years with no intention of stopping soon. Amen to that! [caption id=\"\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"600\"] Photo: Sibtain Naqvi[/caption] After sampling Karhai, Nihari, Sajji or Haleem many want to pass over the rich desserts and move on to something refreshing to wash down the good stuff. The Punjab Lassi House has been doing that for over a quarter of a century. The Lassi slips down your throat, singing the songs of the Punjab and erasing the after effects of spicy food. [caption id=\"\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"600\"] Photo: Sibtain Naqvi[/caption] In summer, it is a godsend and banishes the heat demons just as effectively. Sweet, salty or churned with a crumbling Perha sweetmeat, the Lassi here is the benchmark for the rest, the highpoint of any dairy drink. Burns Road’s position as the dowager empress of the food world is firmly entrenched. There are other places in different parts of Karachi and the country which have great food and firm clientele. But if there is one spot that throws down the gauntlet and stands apart, it’s this magical street of sumptuous, succulent treats.\n\n↧\n\n↧\n\nDo you know where ‘chai’ came from?\n\nThe food we eat today is influenced by several cultures. I learned this after reading the highly informative book called Curry: A tale of Cooks and Conquerors by Lizzie Collingham. The historical references in this book are elaborate and provide an insight into our cuisine. Take spices for instance. Isn’t it almost impossible to fathom the idea of Pakistani and Indian cuisine without the use of different types of spices? But before the Portuguese entered Goa, our part of the world had never seen a chilli. And when the Europeans travelled to India, their aim was to increase trade, but as a result of this trade, new ingredients were introduced and our eating habits changed forever. The Mughal Empire also had a great impact on the food that we eat today. The Mughals believed in dining lavishly. They paid their cooks a handsome amount of money and gave them the freedom to experiment. Mughlai cuisine itself was heavily influenced by Persian cuisine. Mughlai pulao Pulao was a dish very dear to the Mughals. The pulao is a dish made with rice, aromatic spices and meat. It is said that the pulao inspired the Italians to make the risotto and the Spanish to make the paella. Moreover, a pulao is the perfect way to gauge the quality of ingredients used by the chef. Ideally the rice should be fragrant and separated while the aromatic spices used should not overpower the natural flavour of the Basmati rice. [caption id=\"\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"600\"] Photo: File[/caption] While making a pulao, I prefer to use tough cuts of mutton attached to the bone because the tough cuts add their own flavour and the bones make a rich stock. In addition, I get to eat the bone marrow while feasting on my pulao. What more could one ask for? Akbari biryani During Emperor Akbar’s rule, innovation in the Mughal kitchens was at an all-time high. Spices were being used in varying quantities and different ways by the cooks to create something new. This gave birth to the culinary heavyweight – the biryani. Biryani took its inspiration from the pulao. The cooks used the new spices available due to the advent of the Portuguese to make an even more aromatic and spicy rice dish and hence, the biryani came into being. While the pulao is cooked in one pot, biryani must be layered and steamed before serving. Biryani was created in Delhi and proved to be the perfect example of a cuisine moving forward. Mughlai cuisine was brought to the southern parts of the Indian subcontinent when Emperor Shah Jehan took over Hyderabad. Since the level of spices used in the south was substantially higher as compared to in the north, biryani from southern India was sharper and spicier to the taste. Aurangzebi fruit punch Ever wondered where the refreshing fruit punch came from? Emperor Aurangzeb would serve beverages to the British officials who visited him and these beverages would be a blend of spices, fruits, sugar and arrack. [caption id=\"\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"600\"] Photo: File[/caption] Although the ingredients would vary due to seasonality and availability, the drink would consist of five ingredients in most cases. The British picked up on the word ‘paanch’, which is Hindi or Urdu for the number five. Due to differences in pronunciation, this cocktail eventually came to be known as punch in the western world. Tale of the mighty shami kebabs Some of these culinary innovations have truly humorous origins. Take Nawab Asafud Daulah, for instance. He is the reason why we have shami kebabs today. The nawab lost his teeth and hence, was unable to chew his food. His cooks were instructed to prepare something delicious but which required no chewing and this gave birth to our beloved shami kebab. [caption id=\"\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"600\"] Photo: File[/caption] Rumour has it that Asafud Daulah ate so many shami kebabs that he was unable to mount his horse due to obesity. So, now every time you are served shami kebabs, you can imagine a fat nawab falling off his horse! Finger-licking curry or karhi? Even the term ‘curry’ was introduced by the Portuguese and the British. The Portuguese picked up the term from South India where the Tamil word for a dish prepared by sautéing meat or vegetables is known as ‘kari’. The Portuguese reconfigured the word to ‘caree’ and eventually it evolved into our well-known curry. We have separate names for all our cuisines such as korma, salan, karhai. However, the British categorised all dishes that were served with a spicy sauce or gravy as ‘curry’. [caption id=\"\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"600\"] Photo: File[/caption] I remember when I heard the word ‘curry’ for the first time, my mind automatically went to the dish known as karri. Karri is made with yogurt and chickpea flour. Once the gravy is ready, fried pakoras are added to it which adds a layer of texture to the dish. [caption id=\"\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"600\"] Photo: File[/caption] Tantalising tea Although the British were not able to change much of our eating habits they had one contribution that has become deeply rooted in our culture – tea. It is hard to imagine a day without tea in our part of the world. Tea is more than just a beverage for our people; it has a social significance in our culture. Although not a regular tea-drinker myself, I know a number of people who are quite serious about their tea. In fact, a friend of mine has a specialised tea cabinet with different types of teas for different times of the day! [caption id=\"\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"600\"] Photo: Reuters[/caption] However, the subcontinent did not welcome tea with open arms initially. It took the British years to make tea popular in the Indian subcontinent. Tea arrived in India with the arrival of the industrial world. A Tea Association was established which helped to market the product to the Indian population. The Tea Association would tour the country and teach people the correct method of making tea. However, tea vendors did not bother much about these methods and made their tea with plenty of milk and sugar. As tea became increasingly popular, people began to experiment with it and this gave birth to the different types of teas, especially masala chai (spiced tea). My friends often make fun of me when I tell them these random facts. I have even been told that I have a ‘fun fact’ tone. But I believe that it is good to know about our cuisine and culture. After all, the food we eat with such relish today has taken a long journey and to celebrate our cuisine we must appreciate the food we eat today and continue the process of culinary innovation. Most importantly, we should share our rich cuisine with people whom we care about.

In fact, the likes of Inside Llewyn Davis are something that we have not seen from them since Fargo, released almost 20 years ago in 1996. [embed width=\"620\"]http://vimeo.com/67545464[/embed] Why did the Coen Brothers feel the need to go back to the basics of storytelling and small-scale production? Whatever their reason was, they have managed to produce a marvellous rendition of the 60s American country music scene when every folk musician was trying to make his mark during the early years of country music boom. But this film is not exactly about that. Inside Llewyn Davis is about being inside the mind of the folk singer, Llewyn Davis (Oscar Isaac). It depicts the melancholy of a musician who cannot catch a break in life and boy, does he have problems! Llewyn was originally part of a duo act but after his partner’s recent suicide, he is now flying solo. The film starts off with him singing in a local bar. He then crashes at the house of his friend, Professor Gorfein because he has nowhere else to go. He wakes up in the morning and seems to be running late for an appointment with his agent and due to his negligence, the professor’s marmalade cat runs out of the house. Such is the life of a struggling artist. [caption id=\"\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"600\"] Llewyn finds out that his friend’s girlfriend, Jean, is pregnant with his child. Photo: Facebook page (https://www.facebook.com/InsideLlewynDavis)[/caption] As the day wears on, Llewyn finds out that his friend’s girlfriend, Jean (Carey Mulligan), is pregnant with his child. Obviously, she does not want her current boyfriend, Jim (Justin Timberlake), to know about any of this. They discuss the situation over a cup of coffee and she asks him for money to finance the abortion. It is quite evident that Jean hates her life and does not think much of Llewyn either. In fact, her description runs something like this,\n\n“I’m the careerist and you’re the loser.”\n\nAs the story progresses, we go deeper into the psyche of Llewyn Davis as his actions and observations turns his journey into a living nightmare. [caption id=\"\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"600\"] Llewyn Davis travels to Chicago to meet the record producer Bud Grossman to convince him to produce his music. Photo: Facebook page (https://www.facebook.com/InsideLlewynDavis)[/caption] Inside Llewyn Davis revisits themes which were examined earlier in Coen Brothers’ previous film O Brother, Where Art Thou? in 2000. Although a very loose adaptation of Homer’s The Odyssey, Llewyn also travels through a psychological journey which is wonderfully constructed of narrow corridors, claustrophobic apartments and empty stage rooms. The filtered sunlight, bleak winter atmosphere and grim cinematography of Bruno Delbonnel capture the essence of Coen Brothers’ writing and dark humour perfectly. Even though Roger Deakins is the duo’s preferred cinematographer, Delbonnel has done an excellent job nonetheless. The film is an absurd yet fantastic look into Llewyn Davis’ psyche that has this special talent of annoying everyone he comes into contact with – co-workers, friends and family. There is no doubt that Llewyn is a deplorable character but not to the extent of annoying the audience. Once or twice, we even get to witness his frustrations with the world he lives in. But the audience is left with the impression that perhaps, on some level, he also deserves it. It is quite evident that we’re not supposed to love him but neither can we stop empathising with him. Llewyn is kind of an oddity that one cannot fully read or explain. Unlike other films by the Coen Brothers, no blood gets spilled in this one but you may relate to this film much more than to any of their earlier work. Like A Serious Man, Inside Llewyn Davis does not let style take over substance. It is very persistent in making the audience understand why ambitions are just arbitrary entities which can probably never fully be realised in the world we live in. Oscar Isaac is a wonderful new recruit who not only played the depressed singer and songwriter with authenticity but also sang some of the songs for the film’s soundtrack. [caption id=\"\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"600\"] Oscar Isaac played the depressed singer and songwriter with authenticity. Photo: Facebook page (https://www.facebook.com/InsideLlewynDavis)[/caption] The music is obviously an integral part of Llewyn’s character as well as the subject of the film. Songs like ‘Please Mr. Kennedy’ (co-written and performed by Justin Timberlake) and ‘Fare Thee Well’ take up massive amount of charm of the story itself. Most of the folk songs have been recorded live and consisted mostly of covers from old folk songs. All the other characters also displayed great performances all around. The lack of coherent three-act structure in the film is also interesting and helps to meticulously blend the flare of negligence from the society and the hardships of an eternal walk. Overall, the story flowed like a long, nightmarish road trip that the audience doesn’t necessarily need to question; instead it feels compelled to follow the path and hope that it leads to an emotionally secure place. Inside Llewyn Davis is a brilliant psychological voyage into the mind of a character who is flawed but with whom you can sympathise and root for. And after watching the film, one feels a strange sense of accomplishment– as if the melancholic tune of the music and images linger on inside you – waiting for you to run the Llewyn Davis mile by yourself in the dark, empty streets of New York.\n\n↧\n\n10 ‘argh’ moments with a Pakistani tailor\n\nYou’re a Pakistani and you’ve never made a trip to thetailor? I find that hard to believe. Whether it’s a job interview or a high school farewell party, tailors are the ones who can make every little occasion of a typical Pakistani woman’s life either completely miserable or an absolute fairytale. You stand in front of a full-length mirror and study your newly stitched dress like a hawk. You look at the loose side fittings and feel aghast. The long, loosely dangling sleeves feel out of place. You swear to yourself that the deep neck you see in your reflection was never your choice. The ill-fitted chooridar seems like it’s on its way to growing into a palazzo. You stand there for an hour – praying, cursing, contemplating and hoping for a miracle with your eyes closed. You hope that once you open them your dress will look beautiful, fit like a glove and be just like you imagined it to be. But when you open your eyes, what you see is your tiny self, drowning in an oversized sack. You can ask any Pakistani woman about adventures with their tailors and trust me you will find that each one of them has a story or two to tell. They are all the same heart-breaking narratives of tailors destroying beautiful, expensive dress material and eventually being the primary reason of a special occasion being completely ruined. So here, ladies, I have recalled 10 moments that we have all been through with our beloved tailors: 1) The LOL moment You have just dropped off your favourite unstitched jora at the tailor’s and have an unexplainable feeling of accomplishment wash over you. You explained every little detail with the utmost patience and intricacy, and you think, ‘everything will turn out just fine now’. Here, unfortunately, is where the LOL (Laugh Out Loud) moment steps in. My advice: Save up every ounce of energy you can spare. You will need it along with a whole new level of patience and sanity when he calls you to pick up the outfit. If nothing else, just laugh out loud - it happens to be the only thing you can do. 2) Copy cats? Nope. You think you can pick out designs from a flashy, glossy magazine and expect your tailor to put up a replica of the dress you picked? Aww, that’s really cute. Copying even the simplest of designs will be met by this expression, [caption id=\"\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"300\"] Source: mrwgifs.com[/caption] And these comments,\n\n“Baji, ye tu bohat muskil hai. Mein apko Kareena jesa design batata hun!” (Madam, this one is really hard. Let me know show a Kareena-like design!) “Baji, aap ye kia tasweer le ati he itni mehnat se? Aese kapray silay silai he le lia karen!” (Madam, why do you bring such pictures with so much effort? You can get clothes like this ready-made!) “Baji, apko aise design ki kia zaroorat hai? Aap tu wese bhi burkha pehnti hein!” (Madam, we do you need such designs? You wear a burka anyway!)\n\n3) Bargaining with the tailor? Ha! So you successfully bargained the cost of stitching and are relieved to have finally brought the price down to what you deem is acceptable. A feeling of triumph engulfs you. Yes! This is it, this is my day. Well, don’t start celebrating just yet because your tailor has other plans up his sleeve. You know how you are not supposed to tell the cook that the food tastes horrible for fear of him/her somehow corrupt the contents of your plate? Well, it’s pretty much the same rule with Pakistani tailors. Now that you bargained, you are in for a treat. He will make sure that every penny you save is well spent on the daily trips you will have to make in order to pick you dress up. You will keep hoping that today your dress will be ready... [caption id=\"\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"500\"] Source: mrwgifs.com[/caption] Remember: He, pretty much, always has the upper-hand. 4) Creativity at its best! Pakistani tailors have a special quality, an innate belief that they are the world’s top designers. They have this zest for creativity which they are keen to show. They do this by converting shirt cloth into a shalwar and stitch the shalwar cloth into a shirt. They love doing this every time and take pride in this unique creativity.

They will play around with your dress, design it without your permission and when you breathe fire at them, all they can say is,\n\n“Meri baji itna acha design koi bana hi nai sakta. Poora kapra khil gaya hae isse!” (My madam, no one can make such a nice design. The entire outfit has bloomed!) “Meri behan ap zara isko pehan kar bahar nikalana.

The whole of Karachi will be in traffic jam, I swear!)\n\n[caption id=\"\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"380\"] Source: mrwgifs.com[/caption] 6) Still waiting... Getting ready to pick your dress up from the tailor’s because he said it’ll be ready today? Sweetheart, sit back down, make yourself a hot cup of tea and enjoy life. These tailors live on their own planet where the clock works 10-15 days slower than ours. You might as well save that fuel from a useless roundtrip to the tailor and back. You will return empty-handed... again. [caption id=\"\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"478\"] Source: mrwgifs.com[/caption] 7) The inevitable end-product So you don’t believe your eyes when you see your dress ready and hanging at the tailor’s shop? Trust me, don’t trust your eyes. You’ll know why once you try it on at home and then run to the shop to kill your tailor for the wrong fitting. [caption id=\"\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"500\"] Source: Giphy[/caption] 8) Reverse psychology 101 When your tailor is not sure about the design, he’ll say things like,\n\n“Baji, meri manay tu yeh design banwa lein, apkay design se zayada acha lagay ga!” (Madam, take my advice get this design made instead, this will look much nicer than the design you chose!)\n\nTrust your guts on this one because he is mostly definitely telling you that he isn’t getting a word of what the hell you’re trying to explain or has no clue on how to make it. So if you want to spare yourself the heartache, tears and tantrums, either quit the design or the tailor. It’s not going to work out. [caption id=\"\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"269\"] Source: Giphy[/caption] 9) What outfit? You don’t want to end up on their bad side, don’t be too bossy or too dominating with your tailor. Chances are you might annoy him a great deal and you will be the only one suffering when he beats about the bush every time you ask him when your dress will be ready. Any question will be met by a calm\n\n“Abhi toh tayaar nahi hai baji, kal aana” (It isn’t ready today, madam. Come tomorrow)\n\nOr, if worse comes to worst, your outfit will be a complete mess and when you question him you will get a taut reply saying,\n\n“Baji, aap hi ne kaha tha aisa banao. Aur mujhe nahi pata” (Madam, you were the one who asked for it, I don’t know anything else)\n\n[caption id=\"\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"500\"] Source: mrwgifs.com[/caption] 10) Be thorough and specific about your details Make sure you make him pen down every little detail pertaining to your outfit. You may have mentioned that the fabric needs to be shrunk before being stitched, but do not, for the love of God, assume that he will remember that! The only thing he remembers is that he has to stitch your dress. If you have given little trinkets to add to it, just remember to write it all down; he will forget. Don’t assume he will shrink it, put on laces, lining etcetera on his own. Make sure you give him every detail in written to avoid making your tailor trips any longer or more frequent. And then maybe, just maybe, one day, he will surprise you and make you feel like the princess you are- savour that moment- it only comes once in a blue moon! [caption id=\"\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"475\"] Source: mrwgifs.com[/caption] I do admit though, not every tailor is all that bad but if you’re a Pakistani woman who loves designing her own clothes and wants a something different to wear, then you might have a tailor story or two to share with your friends over a cup of tea. We all do!\n\n↧\n\nValentine’s Day is about family, love and chocolate truffles!\n\nIt is natural that things that seem important to us in our teens do not really appeal to us as much two decades later. That’s the case with me and Valentine’s Day. Back in the day, hormones were raging, but now you find yourself raging at your own teen kids. Our parents seemed to do everything wrong and now you try your level best, just as your parents once did, to convince your child that you are right. In those days, going out alone with friends was an absolute must and now it’s an absolute security risk. Back then, Valentine’s Day was spent in anticipation and basking in roses, now it’s spent in exhaustion and kids’ school runs. To me, the celebrations surrounding St Valentine’s Day seem magnanimously pompous and perplexing at the same time. The time, effort and money spent on pleasing a loved one on this day alone, and not any other, is as unimaginable as little cupid aiming the arrow at your heart. It is not like I don’t wish my friends, family, relatives and my Mr a very happy Valentine’s Day but over the last few years, as age, grey hair and wisdom (or so I think) has increased, I feel myself failing to associate the expression of love with this single day. However, celebrate we must. So, why not as a family? And so, I decided to replace the usual roses, teddies and chocolates with Valentine’s truffles instead. And that too made by my kids. They decided to replay Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory in the living room – rolling the cold chocolate ganache in their soft squidgy hands, dropping the rounded (well, almost rounded) decadent chocolate balls on the parchment paper, licking off the melted bittersweet chocolate from their hands, sneaking a bite of the creamy bits and laughing in delight. Chocolate, laughter and love - isn’t that what Valentine’s Day is all about anyway? [caption id=\"\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"300\"] Rolling the ganache. Photo: Saadia Tariq[/caption] This was by far the best Valentine moment for me. They are messy but simple to make, scrumptious and divinely sweet. [caption id=\"\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"617\"] Having fun with chocolate. Photo: Saadia Tariq[/caption] Here is how we did it: Ingredients (makes about 12) Bittersweet chocolate – 220 grams Heavy cream – 120 ml Vanilla essence – ½ tsp Swirl around toppings Coloured sprinkles, icing sugar, cocoa and shredded coconut (I used pink sprinkles, chocolate sprinkles and icing sugar). Method\n\nMelt the chocolate and cream over a bain marie (container filled with hot water used for cooking delicate foods like custards to create gentle and uniform heat around the food).\n\nMix in the vanilla essence. Once all melted, stir thoroughly with a spatula and let cool.\n\nOnce cool, refrigerate for a minimum of one hour.\n\nLine a baking sheet with parchment paper.\n\nOnce the ganache becomes solid, scoop it out in your hands (clean ones please) and quickly shape them into golf-sized balls.\n\nPut them on the baking sheet and once all done put the baking sheet in the refrigerator again.\n\nPut generous amounts of your favourite swirly toppings in small bowls.\n\nCoat the truffles with the toppings generously and refrigerate them in an airtight container until ready to devour.\n\nThey will keep for a week, unless of course, you have children (also known as, chocolate monsters) in the house! Enjoy and a very happy Valentine’s Day to you!\n\n↧\n\n↧\n\n48 Laws of Power: A con man’s guide to the big bad world\n\nWhen I first read Robert Greene’s 48 Laws of Power, I found it difficult to decide whether the writer was being pragmatic or just plain evil. Take these two ‘Laws of Power’, discover each man’s thumbscrew (Law 33) and pose as a friend, work as a spy (Law 14). The wickedness of what Greene is suggesting will shock some, while others will appreciate the practicality of the book. Greene himself has said that he does not consider himself a genius, just a realist. In an interview with Dorian Lynskey of The Guardian for an article, he said,\n\n“I believe I described a reality that no other book tried to describe… I went to an extreme for literary purposes because I felt all the self-help books out there were so gooey and Pollyanna-ish and nauseating. It was making me angry.”\n\nThe book is not just for politicians or power players. It contains useful, albeit rather twisted, advice that anybody in any profession can use to get the best out of the system they live in. The book is basically a self-help guide. It’s a bit like the book ‘How to Make Friends and Influence People’. In the context of the book, ‘power’ means better pay, better treatment by your peers and better social standing. It takes the political tactics and tricks that famous politicians and businessmen used to become successful and condenses them into 48 laws or principles that anybody can use to get more ‘power’. It’s not entirely moral because it includes statements such as\n\n“Court attention at all costs,” “Have no attachments.”\n\nIt tells its readers to lie and cheat their way to success. In simple words it’s a con man’s guide. I grabbed it at the bookstore because its cover and its first few pages were so striking that it stood out. I’ll be honest, I read it more for entertainment purposes than for its advice because it has some good stories to tell. Some of the book’s ideas did blow me away though, simply because I noticed how many people actually used them in real life. In chapter four of the book, he talks about the fourth law – always speak less than necessary. He says,\n\n“When you are trying to impress people with words, the more you say, the more common you appear and the less in control. Even if you are saying something banal, it will seem original if you make it vague, open-ended and sphinx-like. Powerful people impress and intimidate by saying less. The more you say, the more likely you are to say something foolish.”\n\nGreene does not explain the laws using abstract ideas or concepts from political science. He mentions basic principles of human nature and tells stories of real people and their rise to or fall from power. The examples Greene gives range from political leaders such as Alexander the Great and Otto von Bismark to businessmen such as P T Barnum and the Medici Banking family. The public’s reaction to the book has largely been positive. It has high ratings on Goodreads and Barnes and Noble. Articles praising the book have been published in Forbes, The Los Angeles Times and other prominent publications. It sold over a million copies in the United States. Popular rappers such as 50 Cent, Jay Z and Kanye West have mentioned it as a personal inspiration. According to The New York Times, it is one of the most widely read books amongst American prison inmates. Like everything that is consumer-based, the book is not without its criticism. Kirkus Reviews published a scathing review and management guru Jeffrey Pfeffer, a professor at Stanford University, slammed the book on CNN. Criticism revolves around the fact that the book frequently contradicts itself and does not offer research-based evidence to support its ideas. It relies on historical records instead, whose accuracy is uncertain. Should you read the book? Well, yes and no. On one hand, it contains some sound advice about the workings of political power and is a cut above most of the self-help literature in the market. On the other hand, the book encourages people to lie, be deceptive and cheat through life.\n\n“The best deceivers… cultivate an air of honesty in one area to disguise their dishonesty in others. Honesty is merely another decoy in their arsenal of weapons.”\n\nIn the long term, this would mean alienating people and having no real friends. Personally, I believe the book deserves respect purely for its boldness and usefulness in certain situations. However, I do not agree with all of its ideas. Basing my life on principles such as ‘get others to do the work for you but always take the credit’ and ‘keep others in suspended terror: cultivate an air of unpredictability’ would earn me too many enemies for my taste. So if you are interested in a self-help book that can tell you how you can earn greater power (read ‘popularity, privileges, greater pay’) in whatever organisation you work in and have no qualms about making some enemies in the process, this book is for you. If you are beyond all of that and believe in simple hard work, and a positive attitude or if you have inherited all the power and money you need and do not want any more, do not pick this book up yet, it definitely isn’t for you.\n\n↧\n\nSuffering from lethargy? Here are 5 tips to get your lazy bum outta bed\n\nWhen a reporter asked Pope John Paul XXIII how many people worked at the Vatican, he replied,\n\n“No more than half of them.”\n\nWhen I look around, I agree with his statement. In fact, he could have said one fourth of them or may be even one tenth of them because many people go to work but only a few actually do the work. We live in an age where we need to run with the clock – mere crawling or walking is not sufficient. However, practically speaking, a feeling of drowsiness and inertia during working hours while feeling fresh and energetic during sleeping hours is a headache for many. Fortunately, there are ways to tackle this enigma. 1. Early to bed, early to rise [caption id=\"\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"566\"] Photo: Reuters[/caption] Medical research has proved that the ideal time to sleep is while it is dark outside as it collaborates with the innate mechanism of the body. Sleeping during the day deteriorates memory, results in weight gain, decreases working capacity, leads to depression and boosts the aging process. A healthy and active body requires sleep for anything between seven to nine hours. And if you sleep early, you wake up fresh. 2. Water works [caption id=\"\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"600\"] Photo: File[/caption] Dehydration alters the thinking capacity of the human mind and adequate hydration is indispensable for proper brain activity. It is usually said that drinking one to two litres of water every day is vital but the fact is that each kilogram of your body needs 0.03 litres of water. Simply multiply 0.03 with your body weight in kilograms and find out how much you have to drink every day. This can be increased in summers since the water loss is higher. 3. Eat your heart out? No! Choose fruits and vegetables over fast food and fried dishes. This can prevent various diseases – laziness being at the top of the list. Learn to listen to the demands of your body and ignore the cravings of your heart. Overeating never helped anyone and can lead to serious ailments. 4. Jog your mind and body! [caption id=\"\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"578\"] Photo: Reuters[/caption] A brisk walk or jogging for at least 30 minutes a day is perfect, especially if you can’t go to the gym or do not have more time. In any case, a walk in the fresh air is always better than indoor treadmills or gyms since it refreshes the mind and body. Cast aside your personal and professional worries and go out for a walk. It will definitely improve the quality and quantity of your work. 5. Don't... light up your life unnecessarily? [caption id=\"\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"600\"] Photo: Reuters[/caption] According to a study, the human body is attuned to its environment. This is why children sleep at night and wake up in the morning. But as our exposure to artificial lights from laptops and televisions increases, the body gets used to the artificial lights and we tend to sleep during the day while staying up at night. So, put your mobile aside and indulge in a healthy hobby like reading, which will relax your mind rather than stimulate it further. Live healthy, live active and don’t waste yourself. Cheers for a healthy life!\n\n↧\n\n9 reasons you should watch The Big Bang Theory!\n\nAlthough it has become somewhat of a fashion to criticise mainstream things and the same is also true for The Big Bang Theory, we must not forget that it is called ‘mainstream’ for some reason. You’ve got to agree… they were given an unlikable subject and they turned it into something hilariously appreciable. If you still haven’t seen the show (and you better have a good excuse for that), here are nine of the most compelling reasons I thought of for you to watch The Big Bang Theory. 1. Doctor Sheldon Cooper, Bazinga! Doctor Sheldon Cooper, a theoretical physicist and the King of Nerds, is the favourite character for most viewers. His character is considered to be one of the key reasons behind the sustained success of the show which is well into its seventh season. Sheldon finds it troubling to keep up with social codes of conduct. He’s also hysterically horrible at understanding sarcasm and humour although unintentionally, he makes use of these social norms rather often. A classic was season four’s episode The 21 Second Excitation when Sheldon kept insisting that the other guys get ready to watch the Indiana Jones movie with an additional footage of 21 seconds and Howard, one of the main characters, sarcastically said,\n\n“You know, if we miss it, we’ll have the fun of listening to Sheldon whine about it for the rest of our lives.”\n\nAnd Sheldon, completely missing the sarcasm as usual, innocently replied,\n\n“See? Howard’s on my side.”\n\n[embed width=\"620\"]http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x1clpi1_the-big-bang-theory-sheldon-s-inability-to-understand-sarcasm_fun [/embed] Another thing that makes Sheldon’s performance enjoyable is his firm disbelief in irrational practices while he still does things that are somewhat superstitious. For example, the ‘Sheldon spot’ on the couch which he doesn’t allow anyone else to sit on because as he says,\n\n“This seat is ideally located both in relation to the heat source in the winter and a cross breeze in the summer. It faces the television at an angle that is neither direct so that it would not discourage conversations nor at an angle that would cause a parallax distortion.”\n\nAnd of course, who can forget his knocking thrice on someone’s door while calling out their name? The audience realised the extent of this particular superstition when Penny – his neighbour – opened the door after the second knock in one episode. This made Sheldon so uncomfortable that he knocked on the frame of the open door saying “Penny” in a relatively low voice – just to complete his ‘count of three’. [embed width=\"620\"]http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x1clq4s_sheldon-funny-knocking_fun [/embed] 2. Leonard’s experiments and his surprising love-life Doctor Leonard Hofstadter is an experimental physicist and Sheldon’s roommate. He has had a difficult childhood since his mother was an unaffectionate, distanced parent who preferred to analyse Leonard’s behaviour – being a psychiatrist and neuro-scientist – than nurture him. [caption id=\"\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"450\"] Photo: Official Facebook page (https://www.facebook.com/TheBigBangTheory)[/caption] His expertise lies in the area of Applied Physics. He’s shown executing a number of scientific experiments using state-of-the-art equipment in the laboratory. One of my favourite moments from the show is when he shows Penny, who also happens to be his girlfriend (by some weird twist of fate since she is an attractive, popular girl while he is a certified geek) some of the latest experiments in physics including the Holographic Principle using a laser in the lab. [embed width=\"620\"]http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x1cloen_the-big-bang-theory-leonard-performing-science-experiments_fun [/embed] 3. Howard Joe Wolowitz – the only non-PhD Howard - the third member of the foursome – has somewhat of an unpleasant relationship with his ‘never-seen’ but ‘always audible’mother. His relationship with his mother is so intensely disturbing that in one episode when Sheldon asked him to do something nice so that he would go to Jewish heaven, Howard replied,\n\n“Have you met my mother? I live in Jewish hell!” [caption id=\"\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"569\"] Photo: Official Facebook page (https://www.facebook.com/TheBigBangTheory)[/caption]\n\nHis favourite dream is that he’s a ladies’ man. He is also the only member of the geek gang who does not have a doctorate degree and hence, he often has to face mockery over his incompetency in this regard, especially from Sheldon, who leaves no stone unturned in ridiculing him. Although he doesn’t have a PhD, he is an aerospace engineer and has had the rare opportunity to visit the International Space Station. Howard also imitates Stephen Hawking’s robotic voice very accurately, sending the audience into fits of laughter throughout the series. 4. Rajesh Koothrappali’s selective mutism Koothrapali can’t talk to women without being drunk. To counter that, every time he has something to say to a woman, he whispers in Howard’s ear, this gives many people the impression that the two are involved in a gay relationship - this offends both Koothrappali and Wolowitz. The way Raj’s parents interrogate him regarding the dubious nature of their relationship is also quite entertaining. In the current season’s episodes, however, he has managed to overcome his nerves and has conversations with women without needing to drink. [caption id=\"\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"600\"] Photo: Official Facebook page (https://www.facebook.com/TheBigBangTheory)[/caption] His characteristic Indian accent and his failure to understand the American life style also adds to the show’s humour. [embed width=\"620\"]http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x1clyrl_the-big-bang-theory-leonard-s-mother-inquiring-about-raj-howard-relation-raj-s-selective-mutism_fun [/embed] 5. A Penny for your thoughts? Penny is Sheldon and Leonard’s cute, bubbly neighbour and Leonard has had the hots for her since the day she moved in. She plays an unsuccessful actress who is stuck being a waitress at the Cheesecake Factory, while pursuing her dream of making it big in Hollywood. [embed width=\"620\"]http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x1clqqk_the-big-bang-theory-penny-learns-physics-from-sheldon_fun [/embed] Her adorable looks and amusing dialogue delivery keeps viewers hooked, especially her love-hate relationship with Sheldon. [caption id=\"\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"575\"] Photo: Official Facebook page (https://www.facebook.com/TheBigBangTheory)[/caption] 6. Knowledge with fun The inspiration for the show came from two real-life geeky computer programmers. However, instead of being limited to computer jargon and concepts only, The Big Bang Theory includes natural sciences, particularly physics. This allowed the producers to encompass subjects about literally the entire universe including biology, cosmology, chemistry, mathematics, computer science, history, geography, linguistics and other topics of general knowledge. Even the title soundtrack which begins with Our Whole Universe was in a hot dense state…says a lot about the show’s content. [embed width=\"620\"]http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xesdj3_the-big-bang-theory-acilis-sarkisi_shortfilms[/embed] The show is a great source of knowledge, information and even inspiration for people of all age groups; and that too in a fun way. Before this show, I didn’t think physics could be fun either. 7. Something for everyone Although a show of geeks, The Big Bang Theory is not specifically for geeks and can be enjoyed by people from all backgrounds and with varied interests, making it currently one of the most popular shows on air. There is an eclectic diversity of jokes from scientific jokes to mainstream puns. Add to this the expressions and dialogue deliveries of all the characters and I can guarantee an evening of endless laughter. 8. Calling all comic fans! There’s even something for comic and gaming fans on The Big Bang Theory. All four nerds – Sheldon, Leonard, Howard and Raj – are fond of comic books, movies, characters and games. There are extensive references to the comic world, especially superheroes like Batman, Hulk, Spider Man, Wonder Woman, Spock, Yoda, The Flash and others. [caption id=\"\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"403\"] Photo: Official Facebook page (https://www.facebook.com/TheBigBangTheory)[/caption] The characters are also shown to be obsessed with sci-fi movies, particularly Star Trek and Star Wars. [embed width=\"620\"]http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x1cm2j2_the-big-bang-theory-star-trek-costumes-shooting-tragedy_fun[/embed] The characters are die-hard gamers as well and Wednesday night is Halo night – always. Most of the games they play are based on comic characters. 9. Technically sound script The Big Bang Theory is not just another geeky comedy show. The effort put in the content, characters and script is apparent and it is this splendid combination that makes the show such a success. The dialogues written for Sheldon specifically deserve a standing ovation – not to mention his superb, dead-pan delivery of those dialogues. The detailing that has gone into the show can be gauged by the fact that it has an official science advisor – David Saltzberg from the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) – who reviews the script for technicalities and makes any corrections necessary before the recording. The ingeniously penned script is one of the key reasons I watch the show and the writers’ technique and efforts are worth praising. All in all, after a long, hard day at work I look forward to crashing on the couch and watching my four geeky friends and their hilarious antics. I can think of no better way to unwind. All you really need to enjoy this show is a sense of humour, watch it (if you still haven’t) and I’m sure you will agree with me!\n\n↧\n\nSunday mornings with aloo ke parathay and chai!\n\nSavouryaloo walay parathayand hot, sweet, milky tea have an unbreakable connection to winter in my head. The reason could be growing up in Pakistan; that’s how it used to be in our house. Waking up late on Sunday morning meant it was too late for breakfast and too early for lunch. But the rumbling tummy could not be ignored. And so, chilly, winter Sunday mornings called for potato-stuffed buttered parathas for brunch served with shami kebabs or Pakistani style spicy omelettes. In my mother’s household all parathas were prepared either with home-churned white butter or with homemade desi ghee (clarified butter). As a little girl I remember watching my nani (maternal grandmother) prepare butter at home quite frequently. Half of the butter was made in to ghee for later use while the fresh white butter was kept for immediate use. I loved devouring fresh rotis with a knob of freshly churned butter spread on them. The leftover buttermilk (lassi) was used to make karri pakora for lunch the same day. Nothing went to waste. I made some potato-stuffed parathas for brunch this weekend and served them with homemade shami kebabs and mint chutney. And then I thought, why not share some good old Pakistani brunch happiness with the rest of the world? So, here goes… I use a griddle or a tawa for making the parathas. Ingredients for the dough: Wheat flour – 2 cups Salt – ½ tsp Oil – 2 tbsps Water – enough to knead the dough Kneading the dough\n\nThe dough will make around 16 small dough balls to make eightparathas.\n\nKnead the dough with hand or in a machine and use water as needed.\n\nLet the dough rest for an hour before rolling out the parathas.\n\n[caption id=\"\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"450\"] Photo: Ambreen Malik[/caption] Ingredients for the potato filling: Potatoes – 1 ½ kgs, boiled and peeled Oil – 3 tbsp Onions – 2 medium, thinly chopped Fresh green chillies – 2 medium, thinly chopped Fresh coriander – 1 cup, chopped Fresh mint – 1 cup, chopped Roasted cumin seeds – 2 tsp heaped Roasted coriander seeds – 3 tsp heaped, crushed in sil batta (pestle mortar) Anaar dana powder (dried pomegranate powder) or aam choor powder (dried mango powder) – 2 tsp Crushed red chillies – 1 tsp (adjust to taste if you like it spicier) Salt – 1 ½ tsp heaped (adjust to taste) Butter – 200 grams melted [caption id=\"\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"450\"] Photo: Ambreen Malik[/caption] Method:\n\nIn a frying pan, take three tablespoons oil and fry the chopped onions till translucent. Do not brown. Remove on a paper napkin and let them cool down.\n\nMash the potatoes and add all the spices, cooked onions and herbs. Mix and set aside for an hour.\n\nPut the griddle on the stove on the highest heat.\n\nMake 16 balls of the dough; two balls will make one paratha.\n\nRoll out two dough balls into round flat bread at a time. [caption id=\"\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"450\"] Photo: Ambreen Malik[/caption]\n\nRemove any excess flour from them.\n\nPut three to four heaped tablespoons of the mashed potato mixture on one rolled out dough. Use your finger tips to spread the mixture evenly, leaving about half an inch from the edges.\n\n[caption id=\"\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"450\"] Photo: Ambreen Malik[/caption] 8. Place the second rolled-out flat bread dough on top of the stuffed one. You can lightly wet the edges of the stuffed dough by dipping your fingers in water. This helps the flat bread on top to stick to the bottom one firmly, ensuring it does not open as it is cooked and flipped on the griddle. [caption id=\"\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"450\"] Photo: Ambreen Malik[/caption] 9. Press the two rolled out flat breads dough together firmly with your hands. Use a rolling pin to flatten them. The paratha will increase in size as you roll it. 10. Gently lift it in your hands and shed off any excess flour. Flip it on the hot griddle on the highest heat. [caption id=\"\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"450\"] Photo: Ambreen Malik[/caption] 11. Spoon around two to three tablespoons of melted butter on the top side and spread it. Wait for about a minute before flipping it over. [caption id=\"\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"450\"] Photo: Ambreen Malik[/caption] 12. Butter the other side the same way and cook both sides till the paratha gets a beautiful golden brown colour, is crisp to the touch and the edges are completely cooked. Reduce the heat as you cook or the butter will burn and your kitchen will be filed with smoke. 13. Remove the paratha from the griddle and onto a paper napkin. Cut it into four pieces if you want and serve hot with chutney and tea. [caption id=\"\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"450\"] Photo: Ambreen Malik[/caption] It may seem like an effort but trust me, watching your family wipe their plates until the last crumb is gone, will be well worth it! Note: Wipe the griddle with a paper napkin after making each paratha.

I kept looking for Heer Ranjha in Rockstar and derived multiple interpretations from the coffee mugs of Love Aaj Kal. And then came Highway – an invitation card to find layer upon layer of symbols. Although a film that sounds like just another love story based on Stockholm Syndrome from a distance, Highway has a lot more to offer when you come closer; a lot more substance, a lot more feel. And definitely something a lot more important than a mere love story. The question is, is it even a love story in the first place? The answer is no. Spoiler alert – the characters of the film are not in love and they never fall in love. Mahabir Bhati (Randeep Hooda) does not kidnap Veera Tripathi (Alia Bhatt); she only comes in his way. And then they embark on a journey of self-discovery through different states of the ‘real’ India. [embed width=\"620\"]http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x18hmkt_highway-hd-hindi-movie-trailer-2014-alia-bhatt-randeep-hooda_shortfilms[/embed] When stopped by cops at a checkpoint, Veera hides. When Mahabir literally hands her over to the police, she flees as if she was the criminal. Why is she confused? Why is he handing her to the police? Highway offers you all the possibilities of the way you want to look at the relationship of Veera and Mahabir. Childhood trauma and parent figures Mahabir is like the father that Veera never had. He teaches her discipline when she runs away by saying,\n\n“Khud gayee hai tou wapas bhi khud aaye gi.” (She has gone herself; she will come back herself too.)\n\nAnd then, when she does come back, she asks for his permission the next morning before coming out of the room. He tells her to wear appropriate clothing, without showing any sign of chauvinism in his order. He buys her new clothes and gets worried when she climbs a tree – just like a concerned father. On the other hand, Veera is like Mahabir’s mother whom he has left far behind. She talks to him in a ‘baby voice’ when he cries, sings him lullabies, plays with his hair when he sleeps in her lap and cooks for him. Her motherly instincts soar to the next level when she orders him to go see his real mother one day and he actually agrees to this order from his ‘mother-figure’. [caption id=\"\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"600\"] Photo: Official Facebook page (https://www.facebook.com/HighwayTheFilm)[/caption] Journey of self-discovery Some might take Highway as a story of the evolution of two people. Mahabir is the catalyst of change that Veera needed in her life. He shows her a world she has never seen before – a world with mountains and open spaces – unlike her world where she used to feel claustrophobic. She is similar to Heer in Rockstar who wanted to see the world differently or like Agent Sterling in Silence of the Lambs who needed Hannibal Lectar to come out of her shell. Veera, too, is a catalyst of change for Mahabir who had burnt all his boats. But Veera has a calming effect on him and as the story progresses, we see him smiling and looking increasingly free of the burdens he had been carrying on his shoulders and in his heart. It is obvious that she helps the tempest inside him to subside and he becomes a calmer soul. [caption id=\"\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"600\"] Photo: Official Facebook page (https://www.facebook.com/HighwayTheFilm)[/caption] Friends forever There may be some who may see Highway as a ‘buddy movie’ where Veera becomes Mahabir’s buddy. Mahabir, a typical Imtiaz Ali hero, is confused and has no idea what he wants in life. Abhay Deol, Shahid Kapoor, Ranbir Kapoor and Saif Ali Khan, all have been directionless ‘Imtiaz Ali heroes’, until inadvertently, their female counterparts ‘show them the light’. Mahabir is no different. In the beginning of the movie, he tells his gang leader that he is a dog and will die a dog’s death and then he succumbs himself to fate. Veera, on the other hand, makes it clear to Mahabir that she has no intention of marrying him or having babies. Even when he wraps his shawl around her or when she lies down on top of him to sleep, there is nothing sexual about it. Alia Bhatt is only 20-years-old but she has given the performance of a lifetime in Highway, her second film. There are several scenes where she performs like a pro. Her monologues about talking too much, her run in the desert, her narration of her turmoil, her transformation and not to forget the climax where she quite literally steals the show. [caption id=\"\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"600\"] Photo: Official Facebook page (https://www.facebook.com/HighwayTheFilm)[/caption] This film has been the biggest break for Randeep Hooda as well. This is a film where his talent will not only be seen but appreciated and this is something he deserves. The way he crumbles in the scene when Alia cooks for him is phenomenal. His hesitation and eagerness, his firmness and shyness are a work of absolute brilliance. [caption id=\"\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"453\"] Photo: Official Facebook page (https://www.facebook.com/HighwayTheFilm)[/caption] Imtiaz Ali has quite literally created a world of wonders in Highway. He steers the way you want to look at the film and his messages are symbolic as always. In the scene when Veera hides from the cops, he warns the audience that if it is logic and sense they are looking for, they can leave. Alternatively, they can stay and like Veera, enjoy the fairy tale. Through her family, he symbolises real Bollywood masala cinema that wants to maintain the status quo and does not accept change; the cinema that is happy with Jai Ho and Gunday. And then he thrusts an important point into the audiences’ face without any warning. As Veera narrates her story to Mahabir, he stops eating as he listens to her and the audience also becomes uncomfortable in their seats and stop munching on their popcorn. And then he plays it sadistically smart when Mahabir narrates his story with Veera not even there. Veera never finds out why he was the way he was and her edginess is felt by the audience as well. Although Imtiaz could have shortened the length of some sequences, spiced up the side characters and avoided the post-card ending of young Mahabir and Veera running around, these are minor complaints for an otherwise spellbinding experience. By the end of the film, I was deeply satisfied with my journey on this highway. Even the air outside the theatre felt fresher. This is Imtiaz Ali’s brand of Indian cinema. When the film ends, you will be confused whether you liked it or not. But by the next morning, you will start liking the film and by the end of the week, it will become your favourite and you will want to see it again and again.\n\n↧\n\nGunday: A macho masala from the 70s\n\nDirector cum writer, Ali Abbas Zafar waited a couple of years after the release of his debut ‘Mere Brother Ki Dulhan’, a comedy hit of 2011, to entice filmgoers with an action packed crime thriller. This time, Zafar has replaced the genre of a light romantic comedy with a nice mash-up of 70s’ action films to present the perfect commercial movie –Gunday. [embed width=\"620\"]http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x18dlgu_gunday-hd-hindi-movie-official-theatrical-trailer-2014_shortfilms[/embed] If you are a fan of Amitabh Bachchan, particularly of his angry, young man image and classics like Sholay, Don and Kala Pathar, then Gunday is a big treat for you. It’s all about action, double-dealing, revenge tangled with friendship, deceit, romance and betrayal. The film starts with ace actor Irrfan Khan’s opening narration about the fictional story of two refugees, set in the backdrop of the 1971 war between Pakistan and India.\n\n“Bangladesh is born as Pakistan surrenders on December 16 at the end of the India-Pakistan war. It also gave birth to two young orphans; Bikram and Bala. Fighting for survival, they clung to each other and escaped to Calcutta.”\n\nThe storyline further traces the strong ‘bromantic’ bond between Bikram (Ranveer Singh) and Bala (Arjun Kapoor), who became gun carriers as kids and eventually end up becoming Calcutta’s leading coal mafia. They are also shown to be involved in every act of notoriety taking place in the black market during the 80s. [caption id=\"\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"600\"] Source: IMDb[/caption] Both, however, fall head over heels in love with Nandita (Priyanka Chopra), a cabaret dancer who jeopardises their corrupt activities ultimately weakening their childhood friendship. [caption id=\"\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"602\"] Source: IMDb[/caption] Assistant Commissioner of Police (ACP) Satyajeet Sarkar (Irrfan Khan), is a rogue cop who sets out on a mission to catch Bikram and Bala. He is desperately in search for evidence with which he can finally convict them. [caption id=\"\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"602\"] Source: IMDb[/caption] The rest is a story encircled around disloyalty, weakness, aggression and deception. [caption id=\"\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"602\"] Source: IMDb[/caption] The chemistry between the lead actors Singh and Kapoor is flawless. Like the previous two hits, Lootera and Ram-Leela, Singh appears comfortable in his new role and develops an energetic bond with Kapoor. With his quirky style, he maintains to be a confident performer. In my opinion, it is evident that Bollywood has found another great star in the form of Ranveer Singh. [caption id=\"\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"602\"] Source: IMDb[/caption] From Ishaqzade to Gunday, Kapoor has played a turbulent, rustic, angry young man. With his signature scornful smile and facial fuzz, Kapoor did his best to turn the role of Bala into an energetic one but was unable to fulfil the gap in certain areas. For instance, I felt that Bala lacked the agony and sorrow required in the second half of the film. [caption id=\"\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"602\"] Source: IMDb[/caption] Priyanka Chopra, attired in multihued saris looks as beautiful as the typical Yash Chopra female lead usually is. She appears as a sensational dancer and a forthright woman in her pivotal role. [caption id=\"\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"602\"] Source: IMDb[/caption] Irrfan Khan’s spontaneous dialogue delivery and expressions when portraying a larger-than-life heroic role are exceptional, leaving a lasting impression. The music composer, Sohail Sen, produced high tempo and energetic foot-tapping tunes with heavy beats coupled. But if you are a fan of romantic songs, such as ‘Zehnaseeb’ (Hasee Toh Phasee), ‘Ankahee’ or ‘Shikayatein’ (Lootera), then Gunday’s music will not appeal to you. [caption id=\"\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"602\"] Source: IMDb[/caption] Zafar’s Gunday has been packaged in just the right manner but the content is just not up to the mark. The artistic appeal could have been increased if a little more effort was put into the direction. As a matter of fact, the story is neither electrifying nor awe-inspiring for the avid filmgoers. Although it is not badly written, the criss-cross of the characters is quite predictable as majority of the audience has already witnessed such twists in typical macho masala films of the 70s and 80s era. [caption id=\"\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"602\"] Source: IMDb[/caption] The highlights of the movie are Singh and Kapoor’s superb chemistry, Khan’s crafty acting skills and the exceptional cinematography. Overall, it is an enjoyable treat for those moviegoers who love to watch loud, action and drama packed and romance filled movies with crispy dialogues and ‘Asalaame Ishqum’ type songs; all in two and a half hours. [embed width=\"620\"]http://vimeo.com/85367211[/embed] In my opinion, Gunday deserves a rating of 2.5 out of 5, solely based on Singh, Kapoor and Khan’s performance.\n\n↧\n\nOscars 2014: ‘Her’ deserves the Best Picture award\n\nIn an era of re-boots ,superhero franchises and weak attempts at capturing the ‘essence’ of classics , very few films stand out as being relevant to the complexities and issues of the modern world . This year's Oscar season crop has seen some improvement when it comes to directors and actors, old and new, engaging in challenging and thought provoking roles and issues. [embed width=\"620\"]http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x136ni7_her-trailer-for-her_shortfilms[/embed] While most people hotly debate whether Leonardo DiCaprio's Oscar drought will end , whether the McConaissance movement will gain a major boost or whether Christian Bale has finally cracked the code to completely control body weight and mass , the modest underdog ‘Her’ seems poised to make waves at the big event . And very rightly so. While the sci-fi genre is usually frowned upon by the academy, Spike Jonze presents a pretty strong case in this complex drama-romance about computer-human interaction. In fact, given the way the world is progressing, this just might be the most important film for the future. [caption id=\"\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"608\"] Source: IMDb[/caption] Set in 2025 , the movie focuses on Theodore Twombly (Joaquin Phoenix) , an introverted and slightly awkward greeting card composer , who is still reeling from the effects of a painful separation. Theodore lives a seemingly dull life until he discovers a new and remarkable operating system (OS), Samantha (Scarlett Johansson). Intrigued by this creation, he starts spending increasing amounts of time with her and eventually opens up to Samantha. Samantha, in turn, is equally intrigued, and as if on cue, the two fall in love. [caption id=\"\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"608\"] Source: IMDb[/caption] The latter part of the movie traces their relationship over time and how they deal with the problems that arise out of such a liaison. [caption id=\"\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"600\"] Source: IMDb[/caption] The movie is remarkably very different from others of the same genre. On one hand, it shows a very practical and realistic aspect of relationships while on the other hand, it is a chilling prophecy of what could happen. Samantha is basically a much more enhanced version of the current Siri, while most of the other technological innovations in the movie either exist in their most rudimentary forms or are proposed achievable targets for major companies. While a Samantha OS replica may never be brought into existence, we are not far from the world portrayed in the movie. Both Phoenix and Johansson deserve high praises for their performance. Known for his intense and controversial roles, Phoenix displays a softer side as a lonely, dazed and idealistic dreamer who only comes fully alive when he interacts with a computer. [caption id=\"\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"608\"] Source: IMDb[/caption] Johansson’s portrayal as Samantha makes you forget that she is indeed simply an OS .The dialogue and the chemistry between the two leads is flawless, as the relationship progresses at a natural and almost dreamlike pace. [caption id=\"\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"602\"] Source: IMDb[/caption] The cinematography, score and scene execution and progression is perfectly in sync with each other. [caption id=\"\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"602\"] Source: IMDb[/caption] Her marks Jonze's solo screenwriting debut and is nomination for an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay. In total, the film is nominated for five awards at the Oscars 2014. Surprisingly, neither Phoenix nor Johansson have been nominated for an award. The film is currently playing in selected cinemas across Pakistan and due to the slightly controversial nature, is intended for a mature audience.\n\n↧\n\nLost in translation: 12 signs you’re new to Pakistani culture\n\nRecently moving from Canada, where I’ve lived practically my entire life, to Pakistan, I’ve had to do a lot of learning. Here are few of the things I have learnt since coming to Pakistan: 1) My mother-in-law asked me to clean char maghaz. [caption id=\"\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"320\"] Source: Reactiongifs[/caption] I was relieved to learn that I was supposed to clean seeds and not four animal brains. 2) There is no uncle by the name of ‘lal baig’. [caption id=\"\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"500\"] Source: Reactiongifs[/caption] 3) Don’t’ wear bronzer in Pakistan; rather than getting compliments on a healthy glow, aunties will recommend Fair and Lovely. [caption id=\"\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"225\"] Source: Reactiongifs[/caption] 4) Chukandar (beets) and chuchandar (mole) are very different. You should have seen the look on my husband face when I said I put chuchandar in the curry. [caption id=\"\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"500\"] Source: Reactiongifs[/caption] 5) The concept of not littering is practically non-existent. After carrying an empty can for 20 minutes in search of a trash can, I was forced to throw it where my flat disposes trash, in a pile behind the building. [caption id=\"\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"370\"] Source: Reactiongifs[/caption] 6) You will get many evil stares if you call a Zuhljina a horse. [caption id=\"\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"245\"] Source: Reactiongifs[/caption] 7) While we are on the topic horses, there is a difference between gora (foreigner) and ghora (horse). To my dismay, it was people who were visiting the office from a foreign embassy, not a bunch of horses. [caption id=\"\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"319\"] Source: Reactiongifs[/caption] 8) Green smoothies are unheard of – nobody makes spinach smoothies. [caption id=\"\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"499\"] Source: Reactiongifs[/caption] 9) Milk can be stored in the pantry, it never goes sour! Is it even milk…? [caption id=\"\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"320\"] Source: Reactiongifs[/caption] 10) No matter how loose ones clothes are or the hijab on my head, I am not modestly dressed unless I carry a dupatta; yet it does not matter if it’s net or completely sheer. [caption id=\"\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"500\"] Source: Reactiongifs[/caption] 11) Flagyl, the pill for stomach problems of all kinds, is my best friend. [caption id=\"\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"500\"] Source: Reactiongifs[/caption] 12) Bharay huweh tindeh is the most uselessly annoying dish to prepare in the world.\n\nChop the tindeh,\n\nPeel the tindeh,\n\nScoop out the insides,\n\nCook the inside goop,\n\nRefill the tindeh with the inside goop,\n\nFind the other half of the tindeh and place it on top of the filled one,\n\nTie up the tindeh with string and cook it again.\n\nRemove the string before serving?\n\n[caption id=\"\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"160\"] Source: Reactiongifs[/caption] In the end, it’s still just tindeh. Six months after, I flipped over my life; single-to-married, Toronto-to-Karachi, I think I’m finally beginning to get the hang of things – well, mostly. With Punjabi and Sindhi speaking in-laws, and a brother-in-law who is an Urdu Professor and shaayer (poet), I think it might take me just a little more time before I can analyse the works of Mirza Ghalib and Allama Iqbal. Have you guys ever been lost in translation? Let me know about your mix-ups!\n\n↧\n\n↧\n\nHouse of Cards: Calling all political junkies\n\nHouse of Cardsis an American political thriller drama series produced by Netflix, originally based upon a BBC series of the same name. The main premise of the show is set in present day Washington DC. It chronicles the political life and upheavals in corridors of power of the main protagonist of the series, Frank Underwood (Kevin Spacey). [embed width=\"620\"]http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x1bwvd1_house-of-cards-season-2-political-promo-vo-hd_shortfilms[/embed] Frank Underwood, the main character, is without a shadow of doubt the life and force behind the show. He is equipped with a typical southern accent, sensibilities and mannerisms, cowboy-ish charm and a shrewd, cunning demeanour in his arsenal as he begins his journey in season one as an experienced democrat and House Majority Whip in Congress. [caption id=\"\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"603\"] Photo: IMDb[/caption] He vows to take vengeance, after being passed over for the office of the secretary of state, on all of those who undermined him and thus his diabolical conquest begins. It is quite addictive and mesmerising, for the lack of a better word, to see Frank politicking and manoeuvring his way in the highest of echelons of power with such seamless ease and Machiavellian cunningness. One can’t help but to draw an outright parallel between his political strategies and the Machiavellian doctrine, as he is callously ruthless in his endeavours to satiate his thirst for more power in the most powerful city in the world, Washington. While keeping all the potential spoilers at bay, suffice it to say, he succeeds to a great degree in his cause.
