        "text": "What is it all about?\n\n`Jai Ho' Salman Khan - The Box Office King, Messiah, the Darling of the Masses is back and this time he is serious and demands a change. `Jai Ho' is Salman Khan's best after the industry's most `Wanted' single screen revolution.\n\nThis inspirational, issue-driven drama staged with perfection to be played for the masses gallery will prove intensely moving to mass viewers while Salman Khan's fans all over will make it prestigious thanks to B-Town's most popular best in recent times non stop continue chants of `Jai Ho' tremendous success at Box office are guaranteed.\n\nThe Story\n\nCompelling and particularly encouraging for a Bollywood viewer and an Indian as a general A.R. Murugadoss pens his own 2006 Telugu money spinner `Stalin' starring Chiranjeevi to satisfaction which took a leaf from Hollywood film 'Pay It Forward' starring Kevin Spacey, Helen Hunt and Haley Joel Osment.\n\nEx Army Man Jai (Salman Khan) is fighting a solitary war against corruption and injustice. Honest and incorruptible, he has made it his mission to help as many people as he can. His mantra is quite simple - help somebody and then request that person to lend a helping hand to somebody else - thus forming an ever-growing circle of people helping each other.\n\nIn a strange twist of fate, he finds himself pitted against a powerful politician (Danny Denzongpa) and his vile family. Jai, who is an ex-army officer, will not shy away from a battle, however bloody it may get and firmly believes that you do not have to wear a uniform to serve your country. As the politician unleashes his violent goons on braveheart Jai, Geeta (Tabu), Jai's sister, realises the horrific consequences this can have on her brother and the rest of their family.\n\nShe persuades a reluctant Jai to make peace with the politician. But when this leads to humiliation being heaped on him, Jai loses his cool and declares all out war. It is an unequal war - on side side is the politician with his numerous henchmen and on the other side is Jai - all alone. However, unknown to Jai, a silent revolution has already begun. The voiceless public, he has helped in the past, is gathering force. It finally has a voice and this voice cannot and will not be silenced.\n\nWhat to look out for?\n\nUnbelievable!! This is out of the way and outstandingly done by Sohail Khan. Picture this - a massy Salman Khan starrer roars with ethos of a Rajkumar Hirani movie. Superb!!! The sheer powers of Salman Khan make it believable. Affecting and effective at the same time.\n\nA.R. Murugadoss steeps it deep in Bollywood pride and never forgets a single ingredient required to satisfy those entertainment hungry souls. It's a Salman Khan starrer so it's clean, unadulterated for family audiences. The structure of timely zigzag of emotion, action, comedy, dance, romance is handled with care for the audience.\n\nSalman Khan: He is coming after a year and must say no regrets in fact after 'Jai Ho' Salman's stardom is going to swell tremendously. The B-Town's most popular in one word is at his `Best' `Superb', `Towering' `Outstanding' `Above All' this box office Phenomenon has excelled himself in this film and given is fans moments after moments to worship and cheer. Be his entry, his first encounter with Danny (mind blowing - this is the reason why we love our bollywood), the chase to rescue his nephew and of course the angry roar to chew his opponents apart. In simple words `Bhai' literally chews the screen. \"Kha Gaya\" or \"Cha Gaya\" as the industry puts it in its lingo. Heavily entertaining as satisfying both for hardcores and core. A one man industry truly reminds the good old days of Big B when he was the ultimate. Salman Khan is a never ending phenomenon in 'Jai Ho'.\n\nThe return of Tabu is warm. Genelia Deshmukh is brilliant in a very emotive role. Nadira Babbar is fantastic. Pulkit Samrat leaves a mark. 'Chiller Party' sensation Naman Jain is excellent. Suniel Shetty is adequate. Mahesh Manjrekar leaves his mark. Aditya Pancholi, Mohnish Bahl, Sharad Kapoor, Mahesh Thakur, Mukul Dev, Ashmit Patel, Yash Tonk, Varun Badola, Vatsal Sheth, Tulip Joshi, Haroon Qazi and Sudesh Lehri - all do fine job. Santosh Shukla makes an impressive debut. Once popular TV actor (Khopadi of Kundan Shah from Nukkad) plays an alcoholic and is fantastic again. In spite of having such a long list of supporting cast Sohail Khan deserves praise for giving them significance in the proceedings.\n\nIt's always a treat to watch Danny Denzongpa who is just brilliant.\n\nLast but not the least Daisy Shah makes charming debut and moves her feet very well. Stunts by Anal Arasu, Dave Judge and Ravi Varma are exceptional. Technically slick with sharp editing by Ashish Amrute and pleasant cinematography by Santosh Thundiiayil.\n\nWhat not?\n\nSajid, Wajid and Amal Mallik music is below par. Cynics will argue the logics behind all the proceedings.\n\nConclusion: `Jai Ho' is Salman Khan and massy Bollywood entertainer's biggest celebration. It's not just entertainment to the core, it's also a message of your soul having Saman Khan in his best dramatic, action, emotionally and commercially satisfying moments, if we not count his iconic `Dabangg' avatar. Watch it for any of the three reasons - 1) If you love Salman, 2) If you love Bollywood, 3) Or if you are a good Indian."
