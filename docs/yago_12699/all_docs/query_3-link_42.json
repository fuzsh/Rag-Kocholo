        "text": "photo & text by nacrowe\n\nit feels sometimes when navigating through MUSIC WEBSITES or the comments sections of YOUTUBE videos, MUSIC BLOGS or posts on SOCIAL MEDIA that the online world is just TOXIC. there seems to be a fixation with being AGGRESSIVE and CONFRONTATIONAL with one's opinion rather than THOUGHTFUL, CONSIDERED or COMPASSIONATE. with WEBSITES there sometimes seems to be an embedded incentive to come off ELITIST and EXCLUSIONARY because of their access and role as a gatekeeper to the opinions and thoughts of ARTISTS and MUSICIANS.\n\nwhat i love about the WIKIPEDIA: FACT OR FICTION web series by ONLINE MUSIC MAGAZINE LOUDWIRE is not the fact that it confronts MODERN METAL, ALTERNATIVE ROCK and PUNK ROCK royalty from the likes of SLAYER, PANTERA, INCUBUS, RAGE AGAINST THE MACHINE, LAMB OF GOD, BAD RELIGION, WHITE ZOMBIE, KISS, METALLICA, AVENGED SEVENFOLD, SLIPKNOT and CANNIBAL CORPSE with their (more-than-often INCORRECT) group-sourced online WIKIPEDIA biographies, it is the fact that host GRAHAM HARTMANN is so EVEN-KEELED about the whole endeavor. too often an INTERVIEW SHOW like this will have a host that is attempting to make the whole thing about them and how KNOWLEDGABLE or COOL they are projecting themselves in the effective afterglow of the TALENT (for which the audience is tuning in for), which is more than a little GRATING and PATRONIZING as a viewer. it is easy to identify with HARTMANN as he is treating the talent like REGULAR people and thus humanizes them in the process. its refreshing how little of that actually goes on in the MUSIC PRESS, which seems keen on building up or tearing down the public profiles of prominent MUSICIANS and their work. that or being part of a TRANSPARENT PROMOTIONAL APPARATUS to the DETRIMENT of the FANBASE. i enjoy watching and rewatching these past episodes because of HARTMANN and his ability to not act as an industry cog, instead being an AWARE MUSIC JOURNALIST / EVERYDAY FAN that most MUSIC ENTHUSIASTS can see in themselves.\n\nat least i can.\n\nWIKIPEDIA: FACT OR FICTION has expanded in recent years into the worlds of PROFESSIONAL WRESTLING and ACTORS, along with MUSICIANS, but at the center of it all is still HARTMANN and his ability to make this promotional vehicle seem less showbiz and a bit more DOWN-TO-EARTH and FUN. most definitely worth checking out.\n\nphoto & text by nacrowe\n\ni always felt that INCUBUS was playing a different game than their supposed peers in the METAL community. S.C.I.E.N.C.E. (review linked HERE) was definitely rooted in the SPASTIC RHYTHMIC and TEXTURAL juxtapositions made famous by MR. BUNGLE and the SPATIAL otherworldly explorations of ANDY SUMMERS and more than a little FELA KUTI, but their follow-up MAKE YOURSELF (EPIC, 1999) really put that altogether in a POTENT hybrid mix that continues to defy easy explanation. just goes to show that the first two times i've seen INCUBUS live were in 2000 at OZZFEST (with tour-mates PANTERA, SOULFLY and QUEENS OF THE STONE AGE) and in 2001 at MOBY's short-lived but eclectic AREA:ONE festival (which also featured OUTKAST and JURASSIC 5). and they fit in seamlessly at both, which is pretty INCREDIBLE.\n\nas i wrote about when discussing S.C.I.E.N.C.E. (EPIC, 1997), the POETIC BUDDHIST-leaning, COMPASSIONATE lyricism of BRANDON BOYD is perfectly coupled by the TEXTUAL dexterity of guitarist MIKE EINZIGER and his deep love of all things PHASER, DELAY and PITCHSHIFTING-related pedal-wise. INCUBUS has a very VERSATILE and highly MELODIC yet INFECTIOUS sound that really found an audience with the tracks of MAKE YOURSELF, including the singles \"DRIVE,\" \"STELLAR\" and \"PARDON ME.\" for me the standout tracks include the likes of \"THE WARMTH,\" \"PRIVILEGE,\" \"CONSEQUENCE,\" \"WHEN IT COMES\" and \"NOWHERE FAST\" which all harness a PLAYFUL use of PITCHSHIFTING effects and INCLUSIVE lyrics that deal with coming to terms with your own deficiencies. the result are songs that feel quite INTIMATE and AUTHENTIC, which is probably why this band was such a staple during my late teens and early twenties.\n\nfast forward 20 years and my cousin and a friend are working security at a recent seaside music festival in ASBURY PARK that INCUBUS is headlining. my cousin was tasked with checking passes near the stage and didnt recognize the DJ since he'd gotten a haircut (like more than a decade before). the dude didnt break a sweat and was totally COOL about it, even laughing with my cousin at his own changed appearance and seemed to go out of his way to not make my cousin feel bad. its part of the CHARM of the band that they are DECENT, HONORABLE people who care more about their fans and pet issues like the ENVIRONMENT and SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT (most of which is run through their longstanding MAKE YOURSELF FOUNDATION) than being \"rock stars.\" i was happy to hear they didnt big-time my cousin minutes before a major gig. not being caught up in their own fame seems pretty PUNK ROCK and in keeping with a general DIY ETHOS in a way. it also coincides with their public image from afar, which is that they seem like UNAFFECTED, GROUNDED, CHILL dudes.\n\n​\n\nPITCHSHIFTING is required listening in my estimation, irrespective of whether you are a fan of turn-of-the-millennium ALTERNATIVE ROCK or not. INCUBUS at this point in their career were on an INSPIRED songwriting hot streak and sounded like no other band before or since. well worth checking out.\n\nphoto manipulation & text by nacrowe\n\ncelebrated both for his work as singer / lyricist / songwriter with 90s ALTERNATIVE ROCK veterans INCUBUS as well as his published efforts as a gifted VISUAL ARTIST, it is not hyperbole to state that BRANDON BOYD very much is a modern-day renaissance man. but i think what has often been criminally overlooked is his solo material as well as his side project / collaboration with producer BRENDAN O'BRIEN in SONS OF THE SEA.\n\nto my ears BOYD's solo work is less adorned and more direct in both concept and orchestration than his work with INCUBUS, which is renowned for its INVENTIVE ORCHESTRATION and use of LUSH, COLORFUL SOUNDSCAPES. both projects showcase a poet with EASTERN PHILOSOPHICAL leanings concerned with our connection to EACH OTHER, our ENVIRONMENT and OURSELVES. SAME MESSAGE from a DIFFERENT MUSICAL PERSPECTIVE.\n\nthe solo work of BRANDON BOYD is compelling and well worth investigating and checking out, irrespective of whether or not you are a fan of INCUBUS.​"
