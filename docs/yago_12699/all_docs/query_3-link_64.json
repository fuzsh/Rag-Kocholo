        "text": "Argentine cinema history begins with the first film exhibition with a motion picture of the Lumiére’s, that took place on July 18, 1896. In 1894 the kinetoscope had already made its arrival and, by early 1896, a kinetoscope concessionaire had tried public projections with a device of his own invention.\n\nArticle of the guest columnist, Paraná Sendros for surdelsur.com\n\nThe Silent Film\n\nIn 1898, Dr. Alejandro Posadas initiated surgical cinema by shooting his own surgeries.\n\nIn 1900, the first theaters specially intended for movie projections and the first filmed news reports appeared.\n\nAfter that, it is worth mentioning the essays of sound film in 1907.\n\nThe first fiction movie with professional actors, La revolución de mayo (May Revolution, 1910).\n\nThe first feature-length film, Amalia (1914).\n\nAlso in 1917, Emilia Saleny was the first woman film director in Latin America, with her film El pañuelo de Clarita.\n\nIncluding melodramas, thrillers, comedies and movies with countryside subjects, during the silent film period over 200 movies were shot, the most outstanding ones being those with a tango climate by Agustín Ferreyra. However, a true industry was never organized and the films were never properly preserved.\n\nThe Sound Film\n\nSoon, these and other companies produced 30 films per year which they exported to Latin America; especially, Libertad Lamarque’s melodramas, Sandrini’s comic films and later, also Niní Marshall’s.\n\nIn 1938 there were already 29 filming galleries, although with a still precarious equipment.\n\nTop filmmakers up to 1940\n\nThe main filmmakers were the prolific Moglia Barth. The more promising and skillful Manuel Romero with: La Muchachada de a bordo (Boys on Board, 1936); La muchacha del circo (The Circus Girl, 1937) and Fuera de la ley (Outlaw, 1937) thriller forbidden in New York; y La vida es un tango (Life is a Tango, 1939), among others.\n\nThe rigorous Mario Soffici, the script-writer of Prisioneros de la tierra (Prisoners of the Land, 1939), -according to surveys, the best Argentine movie-, of other social dramas and also some comedies.\n\nThe suburban poet Leopoldo Torres Ríos author of La vuelta al nido (Back to the Nest, 1938), Pelota de trapo (Cloth Ball, 1948) and Aquello que amamos (What we love, 1959).\n\nThe rhetoric but effective Luis César Amadori filmmaker of Dios se lo pague (God Reward You, 1947) and Almafuerte (1949).\n\nThe creator of bourgeois comedies, Francisco Mugica, in Así es la vida (Such is Life, 1939) and Los martes, orquídeas (Tuesdays, Orchids, 1941).\n\nAlso the more refined Daniel Tynaire, Luis Saslavsky, Alberto de Zavalía and Carlos Borcosque.\n\nShortly afterwards, Carlos Hugo Christensen with dramas and erotic comedies in Safo (1943) and El ángel desnudo (The Naked Angel, 1946), the comedy directors Luis Bayón Herrera and Carlos Schlieper, and the epic cinema director Lucas Demare with: La guerra gaucha (The Gaucho War, 1942) and Su mejor alumno (His Best Pupil, 1944) also made their appearances.\n\nKeys to the cinema of the ’40s\n\nThree key events in the 1940s were: First, the formation of the Artistas Argentinos Asociados, cooperative, with a large part of the “intelligentzia” of the period. Secondly, the crisis for the lack of virgin film (as a consequence of Argentine neutrality during the Second World War) and since 1944. And in third place the increasing state intervention.\n\nEventually, this would lead to forms of censorship, blacklists, discretionary distribution of virgin film and favorable credits which only benefited occasional businessmen.\n\nThe second part of this report describes the main milestones of the Argentine Cinema from 1945 to 1995, with the great figures of the 50s, the creativity of the generation of ’60, and the time for revenge of Argentine cinema.\n\nReferences:\n\nAll graphic material in this report is edited digitally.
