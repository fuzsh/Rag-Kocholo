        "text": "This paper reviews the rapidly changing archaeology conducted in the central Andes over the last 5–7 years. Descriptive work remains at the core of much research. At a theoretical level, foreign archaeologists are more fully using historical concepts particular to the Andes, while Andean archaeologists are drawing selectively from processual and post-processual approaches. Advances in understanding cultural historical developments are reviewed chronologically, with an emphasis on politics, social formation, ideology, settlement patterns, and economics. The article concludes by examining environment and subsistence, technology and society, and gender.\n\nThis volume contains the following articles, research reports, and obituaries: \"Earl Henry Lubensky (March 31, 1921 - May 1, 2009)\" by Deborah M.

On the basis of this, various researchers have proposed that these remains signalled the arrival of highland populations in northern Chile, thus triggering off a Formative transition towards social complexity. However, many coastal desertic Chilean tumuli are associated with cemeteries of shaft tombs which pre-date – and seem to be the predecessors of – these structures. In this sense, our research focuses on the role of local societies, for as well as mortuary traditions and ceremonies we have identified ceramic, textile and iconographic traditions which are indigenous to the Tarapacá region, and which highlight the importance of the trade networks that ran through the area and connected the coast with the Pampa del Tamarugal. In the current paper we present a general study of these indicators, addressing the issue of burgeoning complexity in Northern Chile as an internalised process, focusing on ceremonial dynamics as regulators of access to lands and resources.\n\nThis volume contains the following articles, research reports, and obituaries: \"Betty Jane Meggers (December 5, 1921-July 2, 2012)\" by Monica Barnes; \"Reminiscences of a Stalwart Adversary\" by Robert L.
