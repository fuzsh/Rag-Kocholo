        "text": "Spectrum of cloacal exstrophy.\n\nPubMed\n\nPhillips, Timothy M\n\n2011-05-01\n\nCloacal exstrophy, one of the most severe congenital anomalies compatible with life, occurs in up to 1 in 200,000 lives births. The condition affects nearly every major organ system with severe neurologic, skeletal, gastrointestinal, and genitourinary ramifications. With increased understanding of the anatomy and embryology combined with refinements in prenatal diagnosis and postnatal care, there is now near-universal survival of patients with cloacal exstrophy. Functional and cosmetic outcomes have improved with modifications in surgical technique. However, debate continues regarding the issue of gender identity, and long-term data are still accruing with respect to the best strategy for management. Despite the extensive malformations noted, many patients have gone on to live fruitful lives.

Owners reported intermittent tenesmus in 2 of the tortoises. Physical examinations revealed no clinically important abnormalities in the tortoises. Cloacal calculi were diagnosed on the basis of radiography and cloacoscopy in all 3 tortoises. One tortoise had another calculus in the urinary bladder. Tortoises were anesthetized, and cloacal calculi were removed by use of a cutting burr (plain-fissure cutting burr and a soft tissue protector mounted to a dental handpiece that had a low-speed motor and a straight nose cone) and warm water irrigation with endoscopic guidance. Complete removal of calculus fragments was achieved by use of forceps and irrigation. In 1 tortoise, removal of the cloacal calculus was staged (2 separate procedures). In another tortoise, a second cloacal calculus (which had been located in the urinary bladder during the first examination) was successfully removed 25 days after removal of the first calculus. All 3 tortoises recovered uneventfully, and serious complications secondary to removal of the cloacal calculi were not detected. Cloacoscopy combined with the use of a low-speed dental drill and warm water irrigation should be considered a simple, safe, and nontraumatic treatment option for removal of obstructive cloacal calculi in tortoises.\n\nCloacal morphology of Nothura maculosa (Temminck, 1815), Aves tinamiformes.\n\nPubMed\n\nde Oliveira, C A; Mahecha, G A\n\n1996-10-01\n\nCloacae of male Nothura maculosa (spotted tinamous) were dissected and studied with routine histological and histochemical techniques. In the cloaca of this species the following cranio-caudally oriented regions can be recognized: the coprodeum, the urodeum and the proctodeum, separated by the coprourodeal and the uroproctodeal folds respectively. The coprodeum is an abrupt dilatation of the rectum which receives the ureters, contrary to other birds in which they open into the urodeum. The urodeum is the smallest compartment of the cloaca. Its wall presents the paracloacal vascular bodies and the ductus deferens receptacles which open into the ejaculatory fossa through a pair of papillae. The ejaculatory fossa forms the ventral floor of the urodeum and is characterized by the presence of a secretory epithelium and a lamina propria showing rich vascularization. The proctodeum is connected to the exterior through the cloacal opening and ventrally it presents the phallic structures and the proctodeal lamella. Its dorsolateral wall forms the cloacal bursa, its mucosa shows morphological variations depending on the degree of regression. Enclosing the uroproctodeal wall are the cloacal sphincter muscle and the skin.\n\nThe ultimate challenge of cloacal exstrophy.\n\nPubMed\n\nSchober, Justine M; Carmichael, Polly A; Hines, Melissa; Ransley, Philip G\n\n2002-01-01\n\nOur review addresses the various system abnormalities associated with cloacal exstrophy and revisits the question of gender assignment. Gender assignment decisions and psychological aspects of gender issues have become the \"ultimate challenge.\" Exploration of gender identity, gender role behavior and sexual orientation has just begun. A comprehensive literature review was performed with all world literature regarding the current management of cloacal exstrophy. Research focused on management principles, outcomes and documentation of concurrent anomalies. We also describe original research evaluating gender identity in our own series of patients raised as girls to illustrate the challenge of treatment and augment the available literature, which is scant. Abnormalities of the vertebral column ranged from hemivertebra to myelomeningocele. With magnetic resonance imaging, the incidence of spinal dysraphism approached 100% and cord tethering was also more frequently recognized. For children with the short bowel syndrome, advances in antibiotic usage, and parenteral and enteral nutrition have increased the survival rate and reduced morbidity. A neurological component has been recognized for bladder function, bladder neck continence, lower extremity function and erectile capacity. Mitrofanoff-type reconstruction with bladder neck closure and continent catheterizable stoma dramatically increased continence. Diminutive or absent penis has been documented in 30% of males, and no documentation of paternity exists. The majority of females have bicornuate uterus. However, ovaries and tubes were generally normal. No reports of proven fertility exist. The strategy and timing of surgery relating to gender assignment remain controversial. A desperate need exists for research focusing on gender development and quality of life. Until that time, a cautious watchful approach may be most appropriate as our patients with cloacal exstrophy mature into adulthood.\n\nThe phylogenetic distribution, anatomy and histology of the post-cloacal bones and adnexa of geckos.\n\nPubMed\n\nRussell, Anthony P; Vickaryous, Matthew K; Bauer, Aaron M\n\n2016-02-01\n\nPost-cloacal bones of gekkotans may be present as a single (medial) pair, two pairs (medial and lateral), or may be lacking. We, herein, demonstrate that the presence of a single medial pair is the ancestral condition for the Gekkota, that the lateral pair is of sporadic occurrence within and between families, except for the Eublepharidae where it is universal, and that absence is also of sporadic occurrence except for the Sphaerodactylidae where it is the ancestral condition. Adult male Tokay geckos (Gekko gecko) possess only the medial pair of bones, and these exhibit a regionally-specific expression of woven, fibrolamellar, and lamellar bone, and an enclosed medullary cavity. Females and small juvenile males lack bony elements but exhibit a conspicuous band of dense connective tissue located about the anterior and lateral margins of the cloacal sacs. As males grow and attain sexual maturity, the medial post-cloacal bones condense in this band of dense connective tissue, and are thus shown to be dermal ossifications, similar to osteoderms but with muscular associations (although this is also known for crocodylians). Based upon ontogenetic data we set forth a scenario to explain the loss of the medial post-cloacal bones in various lineages. Differential staining of the cloacal sacs failed to reveal any specialized glandular structures. Investigation of the post-cloacal spurs shows them to be associated with cellular connective tissue of a type similar to that found in the vicinity of the medial post-cloacal bones. This suggests that the lateral post-cloacal bones may also be dermal bones, but histological evidence is needed to corroborate this.

Birds comprise an important model for studying sexually transmitted microbes because their cloaca provides a potential for both gastrointestinal pathogens and endosymbionts to become incorporated into ejaculates. We experimentally demonstrate in a wild population of kittiwakes (Rissa tridactyla) that bacteria are transmitted during copulation and affect the composition and diversity of female bacterial communities. We used an anti-insemination device attached to males in combination with a molecular technique (automated ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis) that describes bacterial communities. After inseminations were experimentally blocked, the cloacal communities of mates became increasingly dissimilar. Moreover, female cloacal diversity decreased and the extinction of mate-shared bacteria increased, indicating that female cloacal assemblages revert to their pre-copulatory state and that the cloaca comprises a resilient microbial ecosystem.\n\nCloacal Prolapse in Raptors: Review of 16 Cases.\n\nPubMed\n\nDutton, Thomas A G; Forbes, Neil A; Carrasco, Daniel Calvo\n\n2016-06-01\n\nSixteen cases of cloacal prolapse in raptors were reviewed in this study. Colonic prolapse was the most common presentation (56% of cases). Red-tailed hawks ( Buteo jamaicensis ) were overrepresented, comprising 66% of colonic prolapse cases. In cases of colonic prolapse, postsurgical stricture formation was a commonly identified complication after resection and anastomosis of the colon. A novel technique was used in 2 cases of colonic prolapse, in which sterile, semirigid rubber tubing was placed in the distal colon and removed per-cloaca at the end of the procedure; this facilitated a secure, fluid-tight anastomosis while maintaining sufficient intestinal lumen. Oviductal prolapse (31% of cases) was associated with the most guarded prognosis (40% treatment success). Cloacoliths were treated successfully in 2 birds (13% of cases) by minimally invasive per-cloacal manual removal.\n\nVariations in the photoperiodic cloacal response of Japanese quail: association with testes weight and feather color\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nOishi, T.; Konishi, T.\n\n1983-04-01\n\nThe size of the cloacal gland was found to be a reliable indicator of testicular activity of Japanese quail. Six experiments were performed to examine the effects of alternating long and short photoperiod on the size of the cloacal gland of male Japanese quail. Three types of photoperiodic cloacal responses were distinguished. Type I birds became refractory to short photoperiods after they had experienced 5 weeks or more of short days. They maintained large cloacal glands under subsequent condition of alternating long and short photoperiod. Type II birds were intermediate types I and III birds did not become refractory tomoreÂ Â» short photoperiods after experiencing 5 weeks or more of short days. The cloacal glands responded to conditions of alternating long and short photoperiods with increases or decreases in size. Feather color on the throat was found to correspond to the type of cloacal response. Type I birds had brick-red throat feathers. Type II birds had white feathers intermingled with brick-red feathers. Type III had white throat feathers. The percentages of types I, II, and III observed in the experimental population was 67, 18, and 15%, respectively. Type III birds were used to study the effects of blinding on the cloacal response to short photoperiod. Five out of eight blinded type III birds did not lose the responsiveness to short photoperiod. These results are consistent with the view that extraocular photoreceptors participate in the photoperiodic gonadal response of Japanese quail.Â«Â less\n\nMeasuring the gut microbiome in birds: Comparison of faecal and cloacal sampling.\n\nPubMed\n\nVidevall, Elin; Strandh, Maria; Engelbrecht, Anel; Cloete, Schalk; Cornwallis, Charlie K\n\n2018-05-01\n\nThe gut microbiomes of birds and other animals are increasingly being studied in ecological and evolutionary contexts. Numerous studies on birds and reptiles have made inferences about gut microbiota using cloacal sampling; however, it is not known whether the bacterial community of the cloaca provides an accurate representation of the gut microbiome. We examined the accuracy with which cloacal swabs and faecal samples measure the microbiota in three different parts of the gastrointestinal tract (ileum, caecum, and colon) using a case study on juvenile ostriches, Struthio camelus, and high-throughput 16S rRNA sequencing. We found that faeces were significantly better than cloacal swabs in representing the bacterial community of the colon. Cloacal samples had a higher abundance of Gammaproteobacteria and fewer Clostridia relative to the gut and faecal samples. However, both faecal and cloacal samples were poor representatives of the microbial communities in the caecum and ileum. Furthermore, the accuracy of each sampling method in measuring the abundance of different bacterial taxa was highly variable: Bacteroidetes was the most highly correlated phylum between all three gut sections and both methods, whereas Actinobacteria, for example, was only strongly correlated between faecal and colon samples. Based on our results, we recommend sampling faeces, whenever possible, as this sample type provides the most accurate assessment of the colon microbiome. The fact that neither sampling technique accurately portrayed the bacterial community of the ileum nor the caecum illustrates the difficulty in noninvasively monitoring gut bacteria located further up in the gastrointestinal tract. These results have important implications for the interpretation of avian gut microbiome studies.

It represents one of the most challenging reconstructive endeavors faced by pediatric surgeons and urologists. Aside from the genitourinary defects, there are other associated anomalies of the gastrointestinal, musculoskeletal and neurological systems that require a multidisciplinary approach when counseling anxious parents. We present a video of a patient with cloacal exstrophy treated with 21 days of life. Surgery consisted of separation and tubularization of the cecal plate from the exstrophied bladder halves and colostomy construction. The bladder was closed primarily and umbilical scar reconstructed and used for ureteral and cistostomy drainage. A urethral catheter was used to guide bladder neck tubularization. A final epispadic penis was obtained and planned for further repair in a second step. The patient had an initial uneventful postoperative course and immediate outcome was excellent. The bladder healed nicely but patient presented with abdominal distension in the 5th day of postoperative setting requiring parenteral nutrition. The distal colon persisted with lower diameter although non obstructive, but causing difficulty for fecal progression. Continuous colostomy dilatation and irrigation were required. Approximating the bladder halves in the midline at birth and primary bladder closure is a viable option, intestinal transit may be a issue of concern in the early postoperative follow-up.\n\nCommunicating with parents with full disclosure: a case of cloacal extrophy with genital ambiguity.\n\nPubMed\n\nMyers, Catherine; Lee, Peter A\n\n2004-03-01\n\nFull disclosure and complete involvement of parents in decisions concerning assignment of sex and genital surgery must be part of medical care for children presenting with findings consistent with disorders of intersex. Intersex most commonly involves disorders of steroidogenesis or gonadal function, but may include multiple cloacal anomalies, such as presented here. To describe full disclosure of medical findings, by a multi-disciplinary medical team, as they became available over a period of weeks, in an infant originally assigned male, but eventually assigned female. An infant born at 24 weeks of gestation, after prenatal ultrasound showing distended bladder, ascites, and bilateral hydroureters, found to have an imperforate anus and a tubular structure appearing as a thin penis, without palpable corpora. Events concerning this case are discussed in relation to full disclosure of medical information to parents, guidelines for management of intersex, and the diagnosis (cloacal anomaly, cloacal extrophy, ano-rectal anomalies or uro-rectal septum malformation sequence). Full disclosure with involvement of parents with medical decisions is not only mandated currently, but also can be an effective approach in intersex care.\n\nEffect of cloacal plugging on microbial recovery from partially processed broilers.\n\nPubMed\n\nMusgrove, M T; Cason, J A; Fletcher, D L; Stern, N J; Cox, N A; Bailey, J S\n\n1997-03-01\n\nExperiments were performed to test the contribution of bacteria contained in the intestinal tract of broilers at the beginning of processing to counts on the exterior of modified New York-dressed carcasses. Thirty-two birds were processed for each of seven replications. Within each replication, batches of four birds were electrocuted, scalded, and picked, with batches alternating between treatment and control groups. Treated birds were cloacally plugged with rayon fiber tampons prior to electrocution to prevent escape of intestinal contents during scalding and picking. Control birds were processed in the same manner, except that cloacal plugs were inserted immediately after defeathering to reduce escape of intestinal contents during sampling. Gram-negative enteric bacteria and Campylobacter spp. were enumerated on carcasses by whole carcass rinse procedure and in cecal contents. Counts were converted to log10 and subjected to analysis of variance. Cecal levels of Gram-negative enterics were significantly higher for plugged birds, but there was not a significant difference between levels of cecal Campylobacter spp. between treatment groups. Plugging before electrocution resulted in significantly lower levels (2.5 vs 3.0 log10 cfu/mL) of Campylobacter spp. and Gram-negative enteric bacteria (3.0 vs 3.4 log10 cfu/mL) in carcass rinses of treatment birds than in those of controls. All carcasses were positive for Gram-negative enterics. Cloacal plugging resulted in significantly lower incidence of Campylobacter spp. carcass contamination as determined by chi-square. Intestinal carriage of both campylobacters and Gram-negative enteric bacteria appears to influence the microbial quality of the carcass during processing.\n\nComparison of body temperature readings between an implantable microchip and a cloacal probe in lorikeets (Trichoglossus haematodus sp.).\n\nPubMed\n\nHoskinson, Christine; McCain, Stephanie; Allender, Matthew C\n\n2014-01-01\n\nBody temperature readings can be a useful diagnostic tool for identifying the presence of subclinical disease. Traditionally, rectal or cloacal thermometry has been used to obtain body temperatures. The use of implantable microchips to obtain these temperatures has been studied in a variety of animals, but not yet in avian species. Initially, timepoint one (Tâ), nine lorikeets were anesthetized via facemask induction with 5% isoflurane and maintained at 2-3% for microchip placement and body temperature data collection. Body temperature was measured at 0 and 2âmin post-anesthetic induction both cloacally, using a Cardell veterinary monitor and also via implantable microchip, utilizing a universal scanner. On two more occasions, timepoints two and three (Tâ, Tâ), the same nine lorikeets were manually restrained to obtain body temperature readings both cloacally and via microchip, again at minutes 0 and 2. There was no statistical difference between body temperatures, for both methods, at Tâ. Microchip temperatures were statistically different than cloacal temperatures at Tâ and Tâ. Body temperatures at Tâ, were statistically different from those obtained at Tâ and Tâ for both methods. Additional studies are warranted to verify the accuracy of microchip core body temperature readings in avian species.

One-day-old broiler chicks ( n Â =Â 60) were divided into groups I-IV of 15 chicks per group, and treated for 35Â days: Group I (control) was given deionized water; Group II, ZnGlu (50Â mg/kg); Group III, probiotic (4.125Â ÃÂ 10 6Â cfu/100Â mL), and Group IV, ZnGlu (50Â mg/kg)Â +Â probiotic (4.125Â ÃÂ 10 6Â cfu/100Â mL). Air dry-bulb temperature ( t db ), relative humidity (RH), and temperature-humidity index (THI) inside the pen, and t cloacal of each broiler chick were obtained bihourly over a 24-h period; on days 21, 28, and 35 of the study. Values of t db (32.10Â Â±Â 0.49Â°C), RH (49.94Â Â±Â 1.91%), and THI (38.85Â Â±Â 0.42) obtained were outside the thermoneutral zone for broiler chickens, and suggested that the birds were subjected to heat stress. Application of the periodic model showed disruption of daily rhythm of t cloacal in broilers on day 21, which was synchronized by probiotic administration. The administration of probiotics or ZnGluÂ +Â probiotics to a greater extent decreased the mesor and amplitude, delayed the acrophases of t cloacal in broilers, especially at day 35, as compared to the controls. Overall, the t cloacal values in broiler chickens administered with probiotic alone (41.25Â Â±Â 0.05Â°C) and ZnGluÂ +Â probiotic (41.52Â Â±Â 0.05Â°C) were lower ( P Â <Â 0.001) than that of the controls (41.94Â Â±Â 0.06Â°C). In conclusion, probiotic alone synchronized t cloacal of the birds at day 21, and, in addition, decreased t cloacal response most, followed by its coadministration with ZnGlu, the antioxidants may be beneficial in modulating daily rhythmicity of t cloacal and alleviating adverse effects of heat stress on broiler chickens during the hot-dry season.

Diagnosis of cloacal exstrophy with meningocele was made at the 26th week of gestation. Cesarian section was performed under general anesthesia in order to keep the infant in a state of apnea to prevent aerophagia, the so-called \"sleeping baby\", at the 38th week of gestation. As soon as the infant was born, she was intubated orotracheally and a radical operation (abdominal closure, removal of meningocele, and vesico-intestinal-pelvioplasty) was performed. Some complications occurred during the operation including hypotension, oliguria, hypothermia, hypoproteinemia, hyponatremia and hyperpotassemia. The operation time was 10 hours and 30 minutes. Mechanical ventilation was continued for 4 days in the NICU and the infant was discharged 37 days after the operation. Early prenatal diagnosis and simulation of the operation enabled an effective surgical procedure allowing us to minimize these intraoperative complications.\n\nAvian Semen Collection by Cloacal Massage and Isolation of DNA from Sperm.\n\nPubMed\n\nKucera, Aurelia C; Heidinger, Britt J\n\n2018-02-05\n\nCollection of semen may be useful for a wide range of applications including studies involving sperm quality, sperm telomere dynamics, and epigenetics. Birds are widely used subjects in biological research and are ideal for studies involving repeated sperm samples. However, few resources are currently available for those wishing to learn how to collect and extract DNA from avian sperm. Here we describe cloacal massage, a gentle, non-invasive manual technique for collecting avian sperm. Although this technique is established in the literature, it can be difficult to learn from the available descriptions. We also provide information for extracting DNA from avian semen using a commercial extraction kit with modifications. Cloacal massage can be easily used on any small- to medium-sized male bird in reproductive condition. Following collection, the semen can be used immediately for motility assays, or frozen for DNA extraction following the protocol described herein. This extraction protocol was refined for avian sperm and has been successfully used on samples collected from several passerine species (Passer domesticus, Spizella passerina, Haemorhous mexicanus, and Turdus migratorius) and one columbid (Columba livia).\n\nAvian bornavirus in free-ranging waterfowl: prevalence of antibodies and cloacal shedding of viral RNA.\n\nPubMed\n\nDelnatte, Pauline; Nagy, Ãva; Ojkic, Davor; Leishman, David; Crawshaw, Graham; Elias, Kyle; Smith, Dale A\n\n2014-07-01\n\nWe surveyed free-ranging Canada Geese (Branta canadensis), Trumpeter Swans (Cygnus buccinator), Mute Swans (Cygnus olor), and Mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) to estimate the prevalence of antibodies to avian bornavirus (ABV) and of cloacal shedding of ABV RNA in southern Ontario, Canada. Blood samples and cloacal swabs were collected from 206 free-ranging Canada Geese, 135 Trumpeter Swans, 75 Mute Swans, and 208 Mallards at 10 main capture sites between October 2010 and May 2012. Sera were assessed for antibodies against ABV by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and swabs were evaluated for ABV RNA using real-time reverse-transcription PCR. Serum antibodies were detected in birds from all four species and at each sampling site. Thirteen percent of the geese caught on the Toronto Zoo site shed ABV RNA in feces compared with 0% in geese sampled at three other locations. The proportions of shedders among Mute Swans, Trumpeter Swans, and Mallards were 9%, 0%, and 0%, respectively. Birds that were shedding viral RNA were more likely to have antibodies against ABV and to have higher antibody levels than those that were not, although many birds with antibodies were not shedding. We confirmed that exposure to, or infection with, ABV is widespread in asymptomatic free-ranging waterfowl in Canada; however, the correlation between cloacal shedding, presence of antibodies, and presence of disease is not fully understood.\n\nProteinaceous Pheromone Homologs Identified from the Cloacal Gland Transcriptome of a Male Axolotl, Ambystoma mexicanum.\n\nPubMed\n\nHall, Kevin W; Eisthen, Heather L; Williams, Barry L\n\n2016-01-01\n\nPheromones play an important role in modifying vertebrate behavior, especially during courtship and mating. Courtship behavior in urodele amphibians often includes female exposure to secretions from the cloacal gland, as well as other scent glands. The first vertebrate proteinaceous pheromone discovered, the decapeptide sodefrin, is a female attracting pheromone secreted by the cloacal gland of male Cynops pyrrhogaster. Other proteinaceous pheromones in salamanders have been shown to elicit responses from females towards conspecific males. The presence and levels of expression of proteinaceous pheromones have not been identified in the family Ambystomatidae, which includes several important research models. The objective of this research was therefore to identify putative proteinaceous pheromones from male axolotls, Ambystoma mexicanum, as well as their relative expression levels. The results indicate that axolotls possess two different forms of sodefrin precursor-like factor (alpha and beta), as well as a putative ortholog of plethodontid modulating factor. The beta form of sodefrin precursor-like factor was amongst the most highly expressed transcripts within the cloacal gland. The ortholog of plethodontid modulating factor was expressed at a level equivalent to the beta sodefrin precursor-like factor. The results are from a single male axolotl; therefore, we are unable to assess how representative our results may be. Nevertheless, the presence of these highly expressed proteinaceous pheromones suggests that male axolotls use multiple chemical cues to attract female conspecifics. Behavioral assays would indicate whether the putative protein pheromones elicit courtship activity from female axolotls.\n\nProteinaceous Pheromone Homologs Identified from the Cloacal Gland Transcriptome of a Male Axolotl, Ambystoma mexicanum\n\nPubMed Central\n\nHall, Kevin W.; Eisthen, Heather L.; Williams, Barry L.\n\n2016-01-01\n\nPheromones play an important role in modifying vertebrate behavior, especially during courtship and mating.

PMID:26885665\n\nMeasuring the Level of Agreement Between Cloacal Gram's Stains and Bacterial Cultures in Hispaniolan Amazon Parrots ( Amazona ventralis ).\n\nPubMed\n\nEvans, Erika E; Mitchell, Mark A; Whittington, Julia K; Roy, Alma; Tully, Thomas N\n\n2014-12-01\n\nCloacal or fecal Gram's stains and bacterial cultures are routinely performed during avian physical examinations to assess the microbial flora of the gastrointestinal tract. Although cloacal or fecal Gram's stains and bacterial cultures are considered routine diagnostic procedures, the level of agreement between the individual tests has not been determined. To investigate the level of agreement between results from Gram's stain and bacterial culture when used to assess cloacal or fecal samples from psittacine birds, samples were taken from 21 clinically healthy Hispaniolan Amazon parrots ( Amazona ventralis ) and tested by Gram's stain cytology and bacterial culture. Most bacteria (97.2%) identified by Gram's stain were gram positive. However, gram-negative organisms were identified in 7 of 21 (33.3%; 95% confidence interval: 13.3%-53.3%) birds. Escherichia coli was the only gram-negative organism identified on culture. Agreement between results of Gram's stain and culture was fair (weighted Îº = 0.27). The results of this study suggest that Gram's stains and bacterial culture may need to be performed with a parallel testing strategy to limit the likelihood of misclassifying the microbial flora of psittacine patients.\n\nOral and cloacal microflora of wild crocodiles Crocodylus acutus and C. moreletii in the Mexican Caribbean.\n\nPubMed\n\nCharruau, Pierre; PÃ©rez-Flores, Jonathan; PÃ©rez-JuÃ¡rez, JosÃ© G; CedeÃ±o-VÃ¡zquez, J Rogelio; Rosas-Carmona, Rebeca\n\n2012-02-17\n\nBacterial cultures and chemical analyses were performed from cloacal and oral swabs taken from 43 American crocodiles Crocodylus acutus and 28 Morelet's crocodiles C. moreletii captured in Quintana Roo State, Mexico. We recovered 47 bacterial species (28 genera and 14 families) from all samples with 51.1% of these belonging to the family Enterobacteriaceae. Fourteen species (29.8%) were detected in both crocodile species and 18 (38.3%) and 15 (31.9%) species were only detected in American and Morelet's crocodiles, respectively. We recovered 35 bacterial species from all oral samples, of which 9 (25.8%) were detected in both crocodile species. From all cloacal samples, we recovered 21 bacterial species, of which 8 (38.1%) were detected in both crocodile species. The most commonly isolated bacteria in cloacal samples were Aeromonas hydrophila and Escherichia coli, whereas in oral samples the most common bacteria were A. hydrophila and Arcanobacterium pyogenes. The bacteria isolated represent a potential threat to crocodile health during conditions of stress and a threat to human health through crocodile bites, crocodile meat consumption or carrying out activities in crocodile habitat. We especially warn about the presence of Salmonella arizonae and S. typhi, which cause enteritis and septicemia in crocodiles and salmonellosis and typhoid fever in humans. The risk of bacterial contamination from crocodiles to humans could increase in the future because of the accelerated destruction of crocodile habitat, which could lead to an augmentation of human-crocodile interactions. Information on bacterial diversity reported here could help in the choice of antibacterial products in case of infections that are of crocodile origin.\n\nEffect of rearing factors on the prevalence of floor eggs, cloacal cannibalism and feather pecking in commercial flocks of loose housed laying hens.\n\nPubMed\n\nGunnarsson, S; Keeling, L J; Svedberg, J\n\n1999-03-01\n\n1. Effects of rearing conditions on behavioural problems were investigated in a cohort study of commercial flocks of laying hens housed in 2 different loose housing systems. The sample population was 120 385 laying hens from 59 flocks of various hybrids at 21 different farms. 2. Logistic regression modelling was used to test the effects of selected factors on floor eggs, cloacal cannibalism and feather pecking. In addition to early access to perches or litter, models included hybrid, stocking density, group size, housing system, age at delivery, identical housing system at the rearing farm and at the production farm and, in models for floor eggs and cloacal cannibalism, nest area per hen. Odds ratios were calculated from the results of the models to allow risk assessment. 3. No significant correlations were found between the prevalence of floor eggs, cloacal cannibalism and feather pecking. 4. Access to perches from not later than the 4th week of age decreased the prevalence of floor eggs during the period from start-of-lay until 35 weeks of age, odds ratio 0-30 (P<0-001). Furthermore, early access to perches decreased the prevalence of cloacal cannibalism during the production period, odds ratio 0-46 (P=0.03). 5. No other factor had a significant effect in these models. Although it was not significant, early access to litter had a non-significant tendency to reduce the prevalence of feather pecking.\n\nImpact of oral Lactobacillus acidophilus gavage on rooster seminal and cloacal Lactobacilli concentrations.\n\nPubMed\n\nKiess, A S; Hirai, J H; Triplett, M D; Parker, H M; McDaniel, C D\n\n2016-08-01\n\nThe use of antibiotics in poultry is being heavily scrutinized, therefore alternatives such as probiotics are being investigated. Lactobacilli spp. are a commonly used bacteria in formulating probiotics, and the addition of Lactobacilli to broiler diets has demonstrated increased growth rates, stimulated immune systems, and reduced pathogen loads in the gastro-intestinal tract ( GI: ) tract. However, previous research has shown that when rooster semen is directly exposed to Lactobacillus acidophilus (L. acidophilus) sperm quality is reduced. Therefore, the objective of the current study was to determine if oral administration of L. acidophilus increases the concentration of Lactobacilli in semen as well as the cloaca. A total of 30 roosters were used: 15 roosters were gavaged with 1X PBS (Control) and 15 roosters were gavaged with 10(7) cfu/mL of L. acidophilus (Treated). All roosters were gavaged for 14 consecutive days. Semen was collected on a 3 d interval, and cloacal swabs were collected on a 2 d interval, beginning on the first day prior to oral administration. Semen and cloacal swabs were serial diluted, and 100 Î¼L of each dilution was then plated on Man, Rogosa, Sharpe ( MRS: ) agar plates. All plates were incubated for 48Â h at 37Â°C under anaerobic conditions and counted. All Lactobacilli counts were first log transformed, then log transformed (day 0) pre-counts were subtracted from the log transformed day counts providing log differences for the analysis. Seminal Lactobacilli counts were not altered by treatments. However, the main effect of treatment (P = 0.026) for cloacal counts indicated that roosters gavaged with Lactobacilli yielded higher counts than the controls. Additionally, cloaca samples also demonstrated a treatment by day interaction trend (P = 0.082), where Lactobacilli was higher in the L. acidophilus gavaged roosters than the controls only on days 3, 5, 13, and 15. In conclusion, the addition of L. acidophilus to the male breeder diet\n\nAmeliorative effects of melatonin administration and photoperiods on diurnal fluctuations in cloacal temperature of Marshall broiler chickens during the hot dry season\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSinkalu, Victor O.; Ayo, Joseph O.; Adelaiye, Alexander B.; Hambolu, Joseph O.\n\n2015-01-01\n\nExperiments were performed with the aim of determining the effect of melatonin administration on diurnal fluctuations in cloacal temperature (CT) of Marshall broiler chickens during the hot dry season. Birds in group I (12L:12D cycle) were raised under natural photoperiod of 12-h light and 12-h darkness, without melatonin supplementation, while those in group II (LL) were kept under 24-h continuous lighting, without melatonin administration. Broiler chickens in group III (LL + melatonin) were raised under 24-h continuous lighting, with melatonin supplementation at 0.5 mg/kg per os. The cloacal temperatures of 15 labeled broiler chickens from each group were measured at 6:00, 13:00, and 19:00 h, 7 days apart, from days 14-42. Temperature-humidity index was highest at day 14 of the study, with the value of 36.72 Â± 0.82 Â°C but lowest at day 28 with the value of 30.91 Â± 0.80 Â°C ( P < 0.0001). The overall mean hourly cloacal temperature value of 41.51 Â± 0.03 Â°C obtained in the 12L:12D cycle birds was significantly higher ( P < 0.001) than the value of 41.16 Â± 0.03 Â°C recorded in the melatonin-treated group but lower than that of 41.65 Â± 0.03 Â°C obtained in the LL birds. Mortality due to hyperthermia commenced at day 28 in both 12L:12D cycle and LL broiler chickens but was delayed till day 42 in LL + MEL broiler chickens. In conclusion, melatonin administration alleviated the deleterious effects of heat stress on broiler chickens by maintaining their cloacal temperature at relatively low values.\n\nCloacal evaporative cooling: a previously undescribed means of increasing evaporative water loss at higher temperatures in a desert ectotherm, the Gila monster Heloderma suspectum.\n\nPubMed\n\nDeNardo, Dale F; Zubal, Tricia E; Hoffman, Ty C M\n\n2004-02-01\n\nThe Gila monster Heloderma suspectum is an active forager in an environment that, at times, can be extremely hot and arid. Thus, Gila monsters face extreme thermostatic and hydrostatic demands. For a desert ectotherm routinely risking dehydration, evaporative water loss (EWL) is typically viewed as detrimental. Yet evaporation simultaneously dehydrates and cools an animal. We explored EWL in Gila monsters by measuring cutaneous, ventilatory and cloacal EWL at five ambient temperatures between 20.5 degrees C and 40 degrees C. Our results show that Gila monsters have high EWL rates relative to body mass. Cutaneous EWL underwent a consistent, temperature-dependent increase over the entire range of test temperatures (Q(10)=1.61, with EWL ranging from 0.378 to 0.954 mg g(-1) h(-1)). Ventilatory EWL did not show a significant temperature-dependent response, but ranged from 0.304 to 0.663 mg g(-1) h(-1). Cloacal EWL was extremely low and relatively constant between 20.5 degrees C and 35 degrees C, but rose dramatically above 35 degrees C (Q(10) >8.3 x 10(7), from 0.0008 at 35 degrees C to 7.30 mg g(-1) h(-1) at 40 degrees C). This steep rise in cloacal EWL coincided with an increasing suppression of body temperature relative to ambient temperature. Dehydration to 80% of initial body mass led to a delay in the onset and an attenuation of the dramatic increase in cloacal EWL. These results emphasize the potential value of EWL for thermoregulation in ectotherms and demonstrate for the first time the role of the cloaca in this process.\n\nExamining the hemagglutinin subtype diversity among wild duck-origin influenza A viruses using ethanol-fixed cloacal swabs and a novel RT-PCR method.\n\nPubMed\n\nWang, Ruixue; Soll, Lindsey; Dugan, Vivien; Runstadler, Jonathan; Happ, George; Slemons, Richard D; Taubenberger, Jeffery K\n\n2008-05-25\n\nThis study presents an interconnected approach for circumventing two inherent limitations associated with studies defining the natural history of influenza A viruses in wild birds. The first limiting factor is the ability to maintain a cold chain from specimen collection to the laboratory when study sites are in more remote locations. The second limiting factor is the ability to identify all influenza A virus HA subtypes present in an original sample. We report a novel method for molecular subtyping of avian influenza A virus hemagglutinin genes using degenerate primers designed to amplify all known hemagglutinin subtypes. It was shown previously that templates larger than 200 bp were not consistently amplifiable from ethanol-fixed cloacal swabs. For this study, new primer sets were designed within these constraints. This method was used to perform subtyping RT-PCR on 191 influenza RNA-positive ethanol-fixed cloacal swabs obtained from 880 wild ducks in central Alaska in 2005. Seven different co-circulating hemagglutinin subtypes were identified in this study set, including H1, H3, H4, H5, H6, H8, and H12. In addition, 16% of original cloacal samples showed evidence of mixed infection, with samples yielding from two-to-five different hemagglutinin subtypes. This study further demonstrates the complex ecobiology of avian influenza A viruses in wild birds.\n\nExamining the hemagglutinin subtype diversity among wild duck-origin influenza A viruses using ethanol-fixed cloacal swabs and a novel RT-PCR method\n\nPubMed Central\n\nWang, Ruixue; Soll, Lindsey; Dugan, Vivien; Runstadler, Jonathan; Happ, George; Slemons, Richard D.; Taubenberger, Jeffery K.\n\n2008-01-01\n\nThis study presents an interconnected approach for circumventing two inherent limitations associated with studies defining the natural history of influenza A viruses in wild birds.

In addition to the normal epithelial layer of the gland and the skin, the tumour cells in the glandular epithelium also showed cross immunereactivity with humanised anti-cytokeratin antibody. This is the first description of an adenoma in the scent gland of a reptile species. Neither epithelial nor mesenchymal tumours arising from the scent gland of reptiles have been reported previously. This report also highlights the possible use of humanised antibodies on reptile species for the fast, reliable and specific differential diagnosis of tumours.\n\nReconstruction of urethra using appendix in a patient with cloacal malformation.\n\nPubMed\n\nGupta, Sandeep; Kumar, Barun; Basu, Sandip; Pal, Dilip Kumar\n\n2017-07-24\n\nWe report a case of 21-year-old young woman with congenital cloacal malformation. She was operated at the age of 1.5 years separating the rectum from common opening as a two-stage repair. She was incontinent in the earlier part of her life but she became continent to some extent later in early adulthood. She presented with urinary stress incontinence following delivery of dead fetus of 6 months. She underwent multiple investigations revealing common opening of bladder neck and vagina. A multidisciplinary evaluation was done and she underwent closure of common channel and neourethra reconstruction using pedicled appendix. Patient was continent and voiding by herself on discharge.

However, quail, like most birds, are generally considered to have a relatively poorly developed sense of smell. Furthermore, quail have no intromittent organ (e.g., penis). It is therefore intriguing that expression of male copulatory behavior induces in quail and rats a similar pattern of c-fos expression in the medial preoptic area (mPOA), bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BSTM) and parts of the amygdala. We analyzed here by immunocytochemistry Fos expression in the mPOA/BSTM/amygdala of male quail that had been allowed to copulate with a female during standardized tests. Before these tests, some of the males had either their nostrils plugged, or their cloacal area anesthetized, or both. A control group was not exposed to females. These manipulations did not affect frequencies of male sexual behavior and all birds exposed to a female copulated normally. In the mPOA, the increased Fos expression induced by copulation was not affected by the cloacal gland anesthesia but was markedly reduced in subjects deprived of olfactory input. Both manipulations affected copulation-induced Fos expression in the BSTM. No change in Fos expression was observed in the amygdala. Thus immediate early gene expression in the mPOA and BSTM of quail is modulated at least in part by olfactory cues and/or somatosensory stimuli originating from the cloacal gland. Future work should specify the nature of these stimuli and their function in the expression of avian male sexual behavior.

The urogenital and anorectal sinuses develop from the embryonic cloaca, and the penis and clitoris develop from the genital tubercle. Within the genital tubercle, the endodermally derived urethral epithelium functions as an organizer and expresses sonic hedgehog (Shh). Shh knockout mice lack external genitalia and have a persistent cloaca. This identified an early requirement for Shh, but precluded analysis of its later role in the genital tubercle. We conducted temporally controlled deletions of Shh and report that Shh is required continuously through the onset of sexual differentiation. Shh function is divisible into two temporal phases; an anogenital phase, during which Shh regulates outgrowth and patterning of the genital tubercle and septation of the cloaca, and a later external genital phase, during which Shh regulates urethral tube closure. Disruption of Shh function during the anogenital phase causes coordinated anorectal and genitourinary malformations, whereas inactivation during the external genital phase causes hypospadias. Shh directs cloacal septation by promoting cell proliferation in adjacent urorectal septum mesenchyme. Additionally, conditional inactivation of smoothened in the genital ectoderm and cloacal/urethral endoderm shows that the ectoderm is a direct target of Shh and is required for urethral tube closure, highlighting a novel role for genital ectoderm in urethragenesis. Identification of the stages during which disruption of Shh results in either isolated or coordinated malformations of anorectal and external genital organs provides a new tool for investigating the etiology of anogenital malformations in humans.

Qualitative analysis of one-to-one interviews. A tertiary center for congenital anomalies of the urogenital tract in London. Six women aged 16 to 24 with cloacal anomalies. Tape-recorded one-to-one semi-stuctured interviews with a skilled interviewer. The taped interviews were transcribed and analyzed verbatim using interpretative phenomenological analysis according to the research question. Organizing themes across all of the accounts were identified. Two organizing themes concerning our research interests are summarized. The first theme Personal Agency in the Hands of Experts focuses on the interviewees' appreciation of their life-saving surgical care and their involvement in treatment decisions. The second theme Compromises and Trade-Offs focuses on what it was like to live with the more traditional versus the more advanced continence methods. Reliability emerged as a key priority in terms of continence treatment outcome. Gratitude may have interfered with the women's honest communications during treatment decision and evaluation consultations. A more developed approach to communication about the complex interventions proposed, founded on a nuanced understanding of users perspectives, can enhance informed decision making about continence management approaches. Despite these specific gaps, the interviewees were appreciative of their care and optimistic about life. Copyright Â© 2014 North American Society for Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology.

All partridges recovered from sedation without any disturbance. Xylazine and diazepam administration did not induce significant changes in heart rate, which did decrease significantly after medetomidine and detomidine administration (P < 0.001). Mean respiratory rate was decreased dramatically at 20 and 30 min after xylazine (P < 0.001) and medetomidine (P < 0.005) administration, and at all stages of sedation after detomidine injection (P < 0.001), whereas there was not any significant change after diazepam injection. In all groups, cloacal temperature measured at 10, 20, and 30 min tended to decrease compared with baseline values. Sedative effects of the drugs started within 2.1+/-0.2 min for detomidine, 2.6 +/- 0.4 min for diazepam, 3.1 -+/-.4 min for xylazine, and 4.8+/-0.8 min for medetomidine application. There was an extreme variability in time to recovery for each drug: 205 +/-22.2 min for xylazine, 95 -12.2 min for medetomidine, 260+/-17.6 min for detomidine, and 149 + 8.3 min for diazepam. In conclusion, xylazine, medetomidine, detomidine, and diazepam produced sedation, which could permit some clinical procedures such as handling and radiographic examination of partridges to occur. Of the four drugs, xylazine produced stronger and more efficient sedation compared to the others, which could permit only minor procedures to be performed. However, depending on the drug used, monitoring of heart and respiratory rates and cloacal temperature might be required.\n\nImplementation of a sampling strategy to detect West Nile virus in oral and cloacal samples in live song birds.\n\nPubMed\n\nHenning, Jill D; DeGroote, Lucas; Dahlin, Christine R\n\n2015-09-15\n\nIn 1999, West Nile virus (WNV) first appeared in the United States and has subsequently infected more than a million people and untold numbers of wildlife. Though primarily an avian virus, WNV can also infect humans and horses. The current status of WNV and its effects on wildlife in Pennsylvania (PA) is sparsely monitored through sporadic testing of dead birds. In order to acquire a more comprehensive understanding of the status of WNV in wild birds, a study was designed and implemented to sample populations of migratory and local birds at Powdermill Nature Reserve near Rector, PA. Resident and migratory bird species totaling 276 individuals were sampled cloacally and orally to compare the effectiveness of sampling methods. The presence of WNV was tested for using RT-PCR. Two positive samples were found, one from a migrating Tennessee warbler and another from an American robin. The low infection rates indicate that WNV may not be a critical conservation concern in the Westmoreland County region of PA. There was also agreement between oral and cloacal swabs, which provides support for both methods. This study describes a surveillance method that is easily incorporated into any banding operation and which determines the risks of WNV to various bird populations. Copyright Â© 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Previous studies have shown that the feather calamus is a site of H5N1 virus replication and therefore has potential for diagnosis of avian influenza. However, studies characterizing the value of feathers for this purpose are not available, to our knowledge; herein we present a study investigating feathers for detection of H5N1 virus. Ducks and chickens were experimentally infected with H5N1 HPAI virus belonging to 1 of 3 clades (Indonesian clades 2.1.1 and 2.1.3, Vietnamese clade 1). Different types of feathers and oropharyngeal and cloacal swab samples were compared by virus isolation. In chickens, virus was detected from all sample types: oral and cloacal swabs, and immature pectorosternal, flight, and tail feathers. During clinical disease, the viral titers were higher in feathers than swabs. In ducks, the proportion of virus-positive samples was variable depending on viral strain and time from challenge; cloacal swabs and mature pectorosternal feathers were clearly inferior to oral swabs and immature pectorosternal, tail, and flight feathers. In ducks infected with Indonesian strains, in which most birds did not develop clinical signs, all sampling methods gave intermittent positive results; 3-23% of immature pectorosternal feathers were positive during the acute infection period; oropharyngeal swabs had slightly higher positivity during early infection, while feathers performed better during late infection. Our results indicate that immature feathers are an alternative sample for the diagnosis of HPAI in chickens and ducks.

Two hundred twenty-five (225)-day-old male Japanese quail were randomly distributed to three dietary treatment groups for a period of 20Â weeks. Each treatment comprised of three replicates, each containing 25 chicks. Three experimental diets were supplemented with 0, 0.5 and 1.0Â mg Se/kg (T 1 , T 2 and T 3, respectively), and diet T 1 was considered as control. Sodium selenite was used as the source of selenium. All the birds were provided with feed and water adÂ libitum. Cloacal foam characteristics, that is cloacal gland index and foam weight, were significantly higher in T 2 group. However, body weight, frequency of foam discharge and testes weight (left and right) did not differ significantly (pÂ >Â 0.05). Physical characteristics of semen, that is semen volume and sperm concentration, did not differ (pÂ >Â 0.05) among the Se-treated groups. The sperm motility, live-dead count and abnormality improved significantly (pÂ <Â 0.05) in 0.5Â mg/Se-supplemented group compared to 0 or 1.0Â mg/Se-supplemented groups. Similarly, fertility and hatchability percentages were higher (pÂ <Â 0.05) in 0.5Â mg/Se-supplemented group than in control or 1.0Â mg/Se-supplemented counterparts. The biochemical characteristics of foam in terms of total protein, acid phosphatase (ACP) and nitric oxide did not differ (pÂ >Â 0.05), while the concentration of glucose was higher (pÂ <Â 0.05) in 0.5Â mg/Se-supplemented diet. On the other hand, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) were lower (pÂ <Â 0.05) in 0.5Â mg/Se-supplemented group compared to control or 1.0Â mg/Se-supplemented groups. From this study, it was concluded that supplementation of 0.5Â mg Se/kg diet was beneficial for foam\n\nUse of 3D reconstruction cloacagrams and 3D printing in cloacal malformations.\n\nPubMed\n\nAhn, Jennifer J; Shnorhavorian, Margarett; Amies Oelschlager, Anne-Marie E; Ripley, Beth; Shivaram, Giridhar M; Avansino, Jeffrey R; Merguerian, Paul A\n\n2017-08-01\n\nCloacal anomalies are complex to manage, and the anatomy affects prognosis and management. Assessment historically includes examination under anesthesia, and genitography is often performed, but these do not consistently capture three-dimensional (3D) detail or spatial relationships of the anatomic structures. Three-dimensional reconstruction cloacagrams can provide a high level of detail including channel measurements and the level of the cloaca (<3Â cm vs. >3Â cm), which typically determines the approach for surgical reconstruction and can impact long-term prognosis. Yet this imaging modality has not yet been directly compared with intra-operative or endoscopic findings. Our objective was to compare 3D reconstruction cloacagrams with endoscopic and intraoperative findings, as well as to describe the use of 3D printing to create models for surgical planning and education. An IRB-approved retrospective review of all cloaca patients seen by our multi-disciplinary program from 2014 to 2016 was performed. All patients underwent examination under anesthesia, endoscopy, 3D reconstruction cloacagram, and subsequent reconstructive surgery at a later date. Patient characteristics, intraoperative details, and measurements from endoscopy and cloacagram were reviewed and compared. One of the 3D cloacagrams was reformatted for 3D printing to create a model for surgical planning. Four patients were included for review, with the Figure illustrating 3D cloacagram results. Measurements of common channel length and urethral length were similar between modalities, particularly with confirming the level of cloaca. No patient experienced any complications or adverse effects from cloacagram or endoscopy. A model was successfully created from cloacagram images with the use of 3D printing technology. Accurate preoperative assessment for cloacal anomalies is important for counseling and surgical planning. Three-dimensional cloacagrams have been shown to yield a high level of anatomic\n\nChicken parvovirus viral loads in cloacal swabs from malabsorption syndrome-affected and healthy broilers.\n\nPubMed\n\nFinkler, Fabrine; de Lima, Diane Alves; Cerva, Cristine; Cibulski, Samuel Paulo; Teixeira, Thais Fumaco; Dos Santos, Helton Fernandes; de Almeida, Laura Lopes; Roehe, Paulo Michel; Franco, Ana ClÃ¡udia\n\n2016-12-01\n\nChicken parvovirus (ChPV) has been associated with malabsorption syndrome (MAS) in broilers. However, the participation of this virus in such syndrome is unclear, since it may be detected in diseased and healthy chickens. In the course of these studies, it was argued whether ChPV genome loads might be correlated to the occurrence of MAS. To check such a hypothesis, a SYBR green-based quantitative polymerase chain reaction was developed to detect and quantify ChPV genomes. Cloacal swabs from 68 broilers with MAS and 59 from healthy animals were collected from different poultry farms. Genomes of ChPV were detected in all samples, regardless of their health status. However, viral genome loads in MAS-affected broilers were significantly higher (1âÃâ10 5 genome copies per 100Â ng DNA) than in healthy animals (1.3âÃâ10 3 GC/100Â ng DNA). These findings indicate that there is an association between high ChPV genome loads and the occurrence of MAS in broilers.\n\nA relative shift in cloacal location repositions external genitalia in amniote evolution.\n\nPubMed\n\nTschopp, Patrick; Sherratt, Emma; Sanger, Thomas J; Groner, Anna C; Aspiras, Ariel C; Hu, Jimmy K; PourquiÃ©, Olivier; Gros, JÃ©rÃ´me; Tabin, Clifford J\n\n2014-12-18\n\nThe move of vertebrates to a terrestrial lifestyle required major adaptations in their locomotory apparatus and reproductive organs. While the fin-to-limb transition has received considerable attention, little is known about the developmental and evolutionary origins of external genitalia. Similarities in gene expression have been interpreted as a potential evolutionary link between the limb and genitals; however, no underlying developmental mechanism has been identified. We re-examined this question using micro-computed tomography, lineage tracing in three amniote clades, and RNA-sequencing-based transcriptional profiling. Here we show that the developmental origin of external genitalia has shifted through evolution, and in some taxa limbs and genitals share a common primordium. In squamates, the genitalia develop directly from the budding hindlimbs, or the remnants thereof, whereas in mice the genital tubercle originates from the ventral and tail bud mesenchyme. The recruitment of different cell populations for genital outgrowth follows a change in the relative position of the cloaca, the genitalia organizing centre. Ectopic grafting of the cloaca demonstrates the conserved ability of different mesenchymal cells to respond to these genitalia-inducing signals. Our results support a limb-like developmental origin of external genitalia as the ancestral condition. Moreover, they suggest that a change in the relative position of the cloacal signalling centre during evolution has led to an altered developmental route for external genitalia in mammals, while preserving parts of the ancestral limb molecular circuitry owing to a common evolutionary origin.\n\nDetection of Avian Influenza Virus from Cloacal Swabs Using a Disposable Well Gate FET Sensor.\n\nPubMed\n\nPark, Sungwook; Choi, Jaebin; Jeun, Minhong; Kim, Yongdeok; Yuk, Seong-Su; Kim, Sang Kyung; Song, Chang-Seon; Lee, Seok; Lee, Kwan Hyi\n\n2017-07-01\n\nCurrent methods to detect avian influenza viruses (AIV) are time consuming and lo inw sensitivity, necessitating a faster and more sensitive sensor for on-site epidemic detection in poultry farms and urban population centers. This study reports a field effect transistor (FET) based AIV sensor that detects nucleoproteins (NP) within 30 minutes, down to an LOD of 10 3 EID 50 mL -1 from a live animal cloacal swab. Previously reported FET sensors for AIV detection have not targeted NPs, an internal protein shared across multiple strains, due to the difficulty of field-effect sensing in a highly ionic lysis buffer. The AIV sensor overcomes the sensitivity limit with an FET-based platform enhanced with a disposable well gate (DWG) that is readily replaceable after each measurement. In a single procedure, the virus-containing sample is immersed in a lysis buffer mixture to expose NPs to the DWG surface. In comparison with commercial AIV rapid kits, the AIV sensor is proved to be highly sensitive, fast, and compact, proving its potential effectiveness as a portable biosensor.

However, limited information is available regarding its epidemiology, biology, genetics and systematics. This study provides characterisation of the complete mitochondrial (mt) genome of C. megalops. The complete mt genome of C. megalops was obtained by long PCR, sequenced and annotated. The length of the entire mt genome of C. megalops is 13,887Â bp; it contains 12 protein-coding, 2 ribosomal RNA and 22 transfer RNA genes, but lacks an atp8 gene. The mt gene arrangement of C. megalops is identical to that observed in Anoplocephala magna and A. perfoliata (Anoplocephalidae), Dipylidium caninum (Dipylidiidae) and Hymenolepis diminuta (Hymenolepididae), but differs from that reported in taeniids owing to the position shift between the tRNA (L1) and tRNA (S2) genes. The phylogenetic position of C. megalops was inferred using Maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference methods based on the concatenated amino acid data for 12 protein-coding genes. Phylogenetic trees showed that C. megalops is sister to Anoplocephala spp. (Anoplocephalidae)â+âPseudanoplocephala crawfordiâ+âHymenolepis spp. (Hymenolepididae) indicating that the family Hymenolepididae is paraphyletic. The complete mt genome of C. megalops is sequenced. Phylogenetic analyses provided an insight into the phylogenetic relationships among the families Anoplocephalidae, Hymenolepididae, Dipylidiidae and Taeniidae. This novel genomic information also provides the opportunity to develop useful genetic markers for studying the molecular epidemiology, biology, genetics and systematics of C. megalops.\n\nCongenital renal anomalies in cloacal exstrophy: Is there a difference?\n\nPubMed\n\nSuson, K D; Inouye, B; Carl, A; Gearhart, J P\n\n2016-08-01\n\nCloacal exstrophy (CE) is the most severe manifestation of the epispadias-exstrophy spectrum. Previous studies have indicated an increased rate of renal anomalies in children with classic bladder exstrophy (CBE). Given the increased severity of the CE defect, it was hypothesized that there would be an even greater incidence among these children. The primary objective was to characterize renal anatomy in CE patients. Two secondary objectives were to compare these renal anatomic findings in male and female patients, and female patients with and without MÃ¼llerian anomalies. An Institutional Review Board-approved retrospective review of 75 patients from an institutional exstrophy database. Data points included: age at analysis, sex, and renal and MÃ¼llerian anatomy. Abnormal renal anatomy was defined as a solitary kidney, malrotation, renal ectopia, congenital cysts, duplication, and/or proven obstruction. Abnormal MÃ¼llerian anatomy was defined as uterine or vaginal duplication, obstruction, and/or absence. The Summary Table presents demographic data and renal anomalies. Males were more likely to have renal anomalies. MÃ¼llerian anomalies were present in 65.7% of female patients. Girls with abnormal MÃ¼llerian anatomy were 10 times more likely to have renal anomalies than those with normal MÃ¼llerian anatomy (95% CI 1.1-91.4, PÂ =Â 0.027). Patients with CE had a much higher rate of renal anomalies than that reported for CBE. Males and females with MÃ¼llerian anomalies were at greater risk than females with normal uterine structures. Mesonephric and MÃ¼llerian duct interaction is required for uterine structures to develop normally. It has been proposed that women with both MÃ¼llerian and renal anomalies be classified separately from other uterine malformations on an embryonic basis. In these patients, an absent or dysfunctional mesonephric duct has been implicated as potentially causal. This provided an embryonic explanation for uterine anomalies in female CE patients\n\nCloacal reconstruction after a complex treatment of perineal haemangioma in a variant of PELVIS syndrome.\n\nPubMed\n\nZalimas, Algirdas; Posiunas, Gintas; Strupas, Sigitas; Raugalas, Ramunas; Raistenskis, Juozas; Verkauskas, Gilvydas\n\n2015-10-08\n\nPELVIS is an acronym defining the association of perineal hemangioma, malformations of external genitalia, lipomyelomeningocele, vesicorenal abnormalities, imperforate anus and skin tag. Eleven cases have been reported according to the Orphanet data. Acronyms of LUMBAR and SACRAL syndrome have been used and most probably represent a spectrum of the same entity. Very little is known about the success and timing of cloacal reconstruction after the treatment of hemangioma. We present a variant of PELVIS syndrome and discuss the possibilities and optimal timing of surgical reconstruction. Female infant was born with persistent cloaca and multiple hemangiomas of genitals, perineal area and left thigh. Colostomy was performed after birth. In order to treat hemangioma and to make the reconstruction of cloaca possible, corticosteroid treatment orally and multiple laser treatments were performed alternating Nd:YAG laser and pulsed dye laser therapy. Cystoscopy confirmed hemangiomatosis in the mucosa of the common channel, bladder neck and septate vagina. Oral propranolol treatment was started at the age of 18 months and continued for 1 year. It induced rapid improvement of hemangiomas. Two more pulsed dye laser treatments were performed to remove residuals of hemangiomas from the perineum and genital area. Posterior sagital reconstruction by separation of the rectum, mobilization of urogenital sinus and vaginal reconstruction was performed with no major bleeding at the age of 4 years. Postoperatively, after a period of progressive rectal dilatation colostomy was closed. Girl is now 6 years old, dry day and night without residual urine and normal upper tracts. Rectal calibration is normal, fecal continence is still to be evaluated but constipation is easily manageable.

Based on changes in the size of the nucleus during the cellular cycle, we considered proliferating cells in each territory to be those with a nuclear area over the 75th percentile. The URS showed increasing cell proliferation, with proliferation patterns that coincided closely with cloacal folds mesenchyme, and with less overall proliferation than urogenital and intestinal mesenchymes. Furthermore, at CS 18, we observed the beginning of the rupture in the cloacal membrane; however, no fusion has been demonstrated either between the URS and the cloacal membrane or between the cloacal folds. The results suggest that cloacal division depends on a morphogenetic complex where the URS adjacent territories could determine septal displacement at the time that their mesenchymes could be partially incorporated within the proliferating URS.\n\nCellular proliferation in the urorectal septation complex of the human embryo at Carnegie stages 13â18: a nuclear area-based morphometric analysis\n\nPubMed Central\n\nNebot-Cegarra, Josep; FÃ bregas, Pere Jordi; SÃ¡nchez-PÃ©rez, Inma\n\n2005-01-01\n\nIn order to analyse the patterns of cellular proliferation both in the mesenchyme of the urorectal septum (URS) and in the adjacent territories (posterior urogenital mesenchyme, anterior intestinal mesenchyme and cloacal folds mesenchyme), as well as their contribution to the process of cloacal division, a computer-assisted method was used to obtain the nuclear area of 3874 mesenchymal cells from camera lucida drawings of nuclear contours of selected sections of human embryos [Carnegie stages (CSs) 13â18].

The fundamental aim in the creation of a new vagina is: to obtain a good aesthetic result, to fulfil functional criteria (elasticity, sensibility, physiological inclination) and to improve the quality of life of the patients avoiding the use of molds and minimizing the morbidity of the zones donors. In this work let's sense beforehand our experience in the accomplishment of neovaginas with intestine. We analyze the clinical record of 13 patients treated surgically in the last ten years. We differentiate two groups according to the age, the diagnosis and the type of surgery: a) the first group of 8 patients present syndrome of insensibility to the androgens (4), syndrome of Rokitansky (2), extrofia of sewer (1) and mixed gonadal disgenesia (1). This group of patients were controlled in the adolescence by an average of age of 19 years (11-35 years), they fulfilling a neovagina with sigma; b) the second group of 5 patients with sewer (3), extrofia of sewer (1) and congenital suprarrenal hiperplasia (1). This group was controlled prematurely by a middle ages of one year (4 months-3 years). The intestinal segment used as neovagina was sigma (2), ileon (2) and rectum (1), and was performed during the surgical correction of her congenital malformation. Two patients have presented intestinal obstruction in the postoperatory immediate one. Four patients have needed removal of a small vaginal prolapse, and three have needed vaginal transitory expansions for introit stenosis. The long-term evolution has been favorable with an excellent aesthetic aspect. Four patients recount sexual fully satisfactory relations. We believe that the neovagina with sigma is at present the best option in patients with absence or hipoplasia vaginal. The advantages are the possibility of precocious and one time correction, a neovagina of dimensions and\n\n9 CFR 147.12 - Procedures for collection, isolation, and identification of Salmonella from environmental samples...\n\nCode of Federal Regulations, 2011 CFR\n\n2011-01-01\n\n..., and identification of Salmonella from environmental samples, cloacal swabs, chick box papers, and... identification of Salmonella from environmental samples, cloacal swabs, chick box papers, and meconium samples... chickens, waterfowl, exhibition poultry, and game birds.

The purpose of this report is to increase the index of suspicion for hydrocolpos in patients with cloaca and to describe our approach for its treatment with the hope that errors in the management of hydrocolpos can be avoided. We reviewed 411 medical records of patients diagnosed with cloaca and managed at our Center during the last 26 years. Emphasis was placed on evaluating for the presence of hydrocolpos, type of drainage, and complications related to the persistence of the hydrocolpos. One hundred seventeen cloaca patients had an associated hydrocolpos (28.4%). Forty-two cases (36%) were initially managed at other institutions at which the hydrocolpos was not drained. Complications experienced by this group included: multiple urinary tract infections (8), hydrocolpos infection (7), sepsis (7), failure to thrive (6), ruptured hydrocolpos (4), and development of hydronephrosis in previously normal kidneys (2). Forty-one patients (35%) had other modalities of treatment, aimed to drain the hydrocolpos, including vesicostomy (26), intermittent perineal catheterization (8), single aspiration (6), or plasty of the perineal orifice (1). In all of these cases, the hydrocolpos persisted or reaccumulated. Thirty-four patients (29%) underwent an effective drainage of the hydrocolpos at birth; 29 at other institutions, 15 with a tube vaginostomy, 13 with a tubeless vaginostomy, and 1 with a catheter placed and left in the vagina through cystoscopy. Five cases had a tube vaginostomy done by us. In all these cases, the vagina remained adequately drained as demonstrated radiologically. Proper drainage of the hydrocolpos alone, with no urologic intervention, dramatically improved the hydronephrosis in 13 cases. Hydrocolpos in patients with cloacas must be diagnosed and treated early in life. Our preferred approach is a transabdominal indwelling vaginostomy tube. The drainage of the hydrocolpos alone may dramatically improve the hydronephrosis, and therefore, we suggest that only after the hydrocolpos is drained should a urological intervention be contemplated. Failure to drain the hydrocolpos can result in serious complications. Copyright 2010 Elsevier Inc.

The study was conducted in five batches of broilers from five different farms, where weekly samples (caecal contents and cloacal swabs) from 30 birds were obtained. Samples were plated onto selective agar (modified charcoal cefoperazone desoxycholate agar, mCCDA) for Campylobacter isolation. Four out of five batches were positive for Campylobacter. No marked differences in sensitivity of both sample types were observed. However, a higher percentage of positive birds were detected when cloacal swabs were used. The results show that cloacal swab samples are adequate, and in some cases even better than caecal samples for the early detection of Campylobacter in broiler flocks at farm level. Also, this sample avoids sacrificing birds to test Campylobacter, which not only allows saving time in sample collection, transportation and processing at the laboratory, but also improves bird welfare and cost of sampling.\n\nConsentimiento informado: una praxis dialogica para la investigacion\n\nPubMed Central\n\nMondragon-Barrios, Liliana\n\n2009-01-01\n\nEl consentimiento informado es un proceso, en el que una persona acepta participar en una investigation, conociendo los riesgos, beneficios, consecuencias o problemas que se puedan presenter durante el desarrollo de la misma.

It was found that persistence or overgrowth of the cloacal membrane on the lower anterior abdominal area, prevents normal mesenchymal ingrowth. This causes divergence of the lower abdominal muscular structures and forces the genital ridges to fuse caudal to the cloacal membrane. The stage of ingrowth of the urorectal septum at the time of rupture determines whether one will produce an exstrophic urinary tract alone (classic bladder exstrophy or epispadias) or cloacal exstrophy with the hindgut interposed between the hemibladders.

To discover common principles of mammalian germ layer development, pig and rabbit embryos at late gastrulation and early neurulation stages were analysed as species with a human-like embryonic disc morphology, using correlative light and electron microscopy. Close intercellular contact but no direct structural evidence of endoderm formation such as mesenchymalâepithelial transition between posterior primitive streak mesoderm and the emerging posterior endoderm were found. However, a two-step process closely related to posterior germ layer differentiation emerged for the formation of the cloacal membrane: (i) a continuous mesoderm layer and numerous patches of electron-dense flocculent extracellular matrix mark the prospective region of cloacal membrane formation; and (ii) mesoderm cells and all extracellular matrix including the basement membrane are lost locally and close intercellular contact between the endoderm and ectoderm is established. The latter process involves single cells at first and then gradually spreads to form a longitudinally oriented seam-like cloacal membrane. These gradual changes were found from gastrulation to early somite stages in the pig, whereas they were found from early somite to mid-somite stages in the rabbit; in both species cloacal membrane formation is complete prior to secondary neurulation. The results highlight the structural requirements for endoderm formation during development of the hindgut and suggest new mechanisms for the pathogenesis of common urogenital and anorectal malformations.

In the present investigation vertical transmission and subsequent spreading and colonization of the cloacal mucosa of chickens by E. faecalis through cloacal 'drinking' were examined. Methods Two different batches of layer chickens originating from 45 weeks old Brown and White Lohmann parents, respectively from the same farm were sampled in the hatcher. Isolates were confirmed to be E. faecalis by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and further by multilocus sequence typing (MLST) to state their population structure and comparison made to sequence types previously obtained from chicken. Results A total of 480 chickens were swabbed from the cloacae just after hatch and after 24 hours. A total of 101 isolates were confirmed as E. faecalis by a species specific PCR. The prevalence of E. faecalis increased from 14% at 0 h to 97% after 24 h for the Brown Lohmann chickens and from 0.5% to 23% for the White Lohmann flock. The 84 isolates analysed by MLST were distributed on 14 sequence types (ST). Three ST (401, 82 and 249) accounted for 64% of all isolates analysed by MLST after 24 h. ST 82 has previously been reported from amyloid arthropathy and other lesions in poultry. Conclusions The present findings demonstrated a high potential of a few contaminated eggs or embryos to rapidly facilitate the spread of E. faecalis to almost all chickens during hatch.

This parasite has a broad host range, but has recently been reported in high prevalences from native Galliformes species in the United States. In order to better understand the impact O. petrowi has on wild bird populations, we developed a quantitative PCR protocol to detect infections in wild northern bobwhites (Colinus virginianus). We used paired fecal and cloacal swab samples from wild caught and experimentally infected northern bobwhites and matching fecal float data from experimentally infected birds to validate our assay. Overall we detected more positive birds from fecal samples than the paired cloacal swabs and there was strong agreement between the qPCR results from fecal samples and from fecal flotation (84%; Îº = 0.69 [0.53-0.84 95%"
