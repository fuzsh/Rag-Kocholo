        "text": "Strada Tamplârilor (Carpenter’s Street)\n\nWhen I was planning a trip to Romania, the place I wanted to visit the most was Sighisoara (pronounced see gui sho ara; the ghi is the same sound as gui in guild). It was the one place that called to me among all the pretty little towns in the country. Perhaps it was the image of colorful houses and the rustic ambience that appealed to me the most. I knew how much farther away Sighisoara is from the capital, Bucharest, and I studied all the options of getting there on my own. I just couldn’t imagine going to Romania without seeing Sighisoara.\n\nCitadel or Town Square (Piața Cetății)\n\nSighisoara sits on top of a hill surrounded by medieval fortifications. It is like a fairytale village with its storybook setting, cobblestone streets, towers, a covered stairway, an intriguing history complete with an evil prince and an impressive clock tower.\n\nClock Tower (Turnul cu Ceas)\n\nThe 64-meter Clock tower is perhaps the first thing you see as you approach the upper town (Citadel). It has announced the time of day or night since the 17th century when the clock was installed. It served as the main entrance to the fortified upper town which is now a UNESCO World Heritage site. The view of Sighisoara from the Tower is unparalleled. As an added attraction, the History Museum is also housed in the Tower.\n\nHouse of Vlad Dracul\n\nVlad Dracul, the father of Vlad III, the Impaler (and perhaps the inspiration behind the novel, Dracula) lived here from 1431-1435. It is assumed that Vlad III was born here. As the son of Vlad Dracul, he is called Vlad Dracula which means son of Dracul. Dracul was so called because he was a member of the Order of the Dragon (dracul).\n\nVlad Țepeș, the Impaler (Vlad Dracula)\n\nWhile Vlad Țepeș is viewed as a cruel and brutal ruler because of his method of killing the enemy by impalement, but he is also seen by historians as an important historical figure for his role in defending Wallachia from the incursions of the Ottoman Empire, protecting Romanian lands as well as stopping the infighting among the boyar (war lords). He is a national hero of Romania.\n\nDominican Monastery Church (Biserica Mânâsterii Dominicane)\n\nThis is a Lutheran Church from the 13th century. It became the parochial church of the Saxon community in the 16th century. The German speaking Saxons settled in Schässburg, now Sighișoara, in the 12th century upon the invitation of the Hungarian king, Geza II. They were tasked to defend the southern border of the Hungarian kingdom. And as their settlement prospered with its guilds and craft shops, Sighișoara became an important commercial center. The Saxons began the construction of the walls of Sighișoara.\n\nChurch on the Hill (Bisereca din Deal)\n\nAbove the Citadel is a hill (Upper Citadel) with a Lutheran church constructed between 1345 and 1525. It was later restored due to damages caused by the Hungarian siege and an earthquake in 1838. The Schola Seminarium Republicae or the Joseph Haltrich High School stands beside the Church. It has existed since 1619. One of the original towers of Sighișoara, the Ropemakers’ Tower, is also found here.\n\nCovered Stairway (Scholar’s Staircase)\n\nTo protect the students from adverse weather conditions, a covered staircase with 175 steps was built leading to the Upper Citadel and the school.\n\nPortions of the fortifications surrounding the Citadel have been preserved to this day.\n\nTinsmith’s Tower (Turnul Cositorarilor)\n\nThere are nine remaining towers left of the original 14 that once surrounded the Citadel. Every guild built their own tower which they had to guard and maintain.\n\nBootmaker’s Tower (Turnul Cismarilor)\n\nHow can you not love a place with trailing jasmine perfuming the air?\n\nView of lower town\n\nCan you spot the dormer windows in the shape of eyes? They are reminiscent of the ubiquitous eyes in Sibiu. An interesting feature of the eyes in the photo above are the tears flowing down from each of the upper four eyes. I don’t know its purpose or what it signifies.\n\nHoly Trinity Romanian Orthodox Church (Biserica Sfânta Treime)\n\nThe Holy Trinity Church was constructed between 1934-37 in Neo-Byzantine style. It’s located on the northern bank of of the Tarnâva Mare River in the lower town.\n\nHow to get to Sighișoara:\n\nI was fortunate to go on a two-day private tour with Nicolas Experience Tours to Sighișoara, Sibiu, Brașov, Bran and Snagov Monastery. Here’s my review of Nicolas Experience Tours which I submitted to Trust Pilot:\n\nIt's often difficult to find tours that cater to solo travelers. I was glad to have found Nicolas Experience Tours to take me to the places I wanted to see on my first visit to Romania. I learned so much about the people and places we visited at an easy pace and tasted local delicacies like the delicious elongated crepes from Sibiu. I saw more than I expected and have a greater appreciation of the country, thanks to Nicolas who is a superb and patient guide.”\n\nFor more information about Nicolas Experience Tours, follow this link: https://experience-tours.ro/\n\nThere are also train and bus options to get to Sighișoara from Bucharest, Brașov and Sibiu. Check rome2rio.com for details.\n\nWhere to stay:\n\nMercure Hotel is in the lower town. If you’re driving, you’ll find plenty of parking spaces here. My room was spacious and had two separate toilets aside from the fireplace and dining area. This part of the lower town is quiet and relaxed. There’s a restaurant onsite with both indoor and outdoor seating.

Carlos Botong Francisco was commissioned in 1953 by Dr. Agerico Sison who was then the director of Philippine General Hospital (PGH) together with Dr. Eduardo Quisumbing of the National Museum, Dr. Florentino Herrera, Jr. and Dr. Constantino Manahan. These oil on canvas paintings measure 2.92 meters in height and 2.76 meters in width (9.71 ft x 8.92 ft) and were displayed at the main entrance hall of PGH for over five decades. Owing to its location, the artworks were in a state of \"severe deterioration\" at the beginning of the 21st century from exposure to heat, humidity, dirt, dust, smoke, insect stains, grime, termites and an oxidized synthetic resin used in an earlier restoration. These canvases were restored three times, the last was\n\nIn 1968, Antonio Villegas (then Mayor of Manila), commissioned Carlos \"Botong\" Francisco to paint the history of Manila for Manila City Hall. The series of large scale paintings was called Kasaysayan ng Maynila (History of Manila). The paintings deteriorated over time and no attempt was made to preserve these historical canvases until 2013 when Mayor Amado Lim sent them to the National Museum for extensive restoration. Four years later, in 2017, Mayor Joseph Ejercito Estrada and the Manila City Council signed an agreement with the National Museum to leave the paintings at the museum so they may reach a larger audience in exchange for museum grade reproductions to replace the originals. Kasaysayan ng Maynila was later renamed Filipino Struggles in History and is now on display at the Senate Hall of the National Museum . Carlos \"Botong\" Francisco died in March 1969, a few months after completing the paintings. He is one of the first Filipino modernists and\n\nLizares Mansion The province of Iloilo on the island of Panay has a rich trove of heritage houses, left over from the sugar industry boom in the 19th century. Iloilo also had the largest port in the Philippines at that time which facilitated the export of sugar to foreign shores and deposited money in the hands of the sugar barons. The barons dropped their earnings into the acquisition of properties in Negros and the construction of beautiful homes in Iloilo, many of which are located in the vicinity of the Jaro Cathedral. The Lizares Mansion was built in 1937 by Don Emiliano Lizares for his wife, Concepcion Gamboa and five children. The family fled to safety when World War II broke out and the house was occupied by the Japanese military. The family returned to the house after the war but left once again after the demise of Don Emiliano. It was sold to the Dominican order in the 1960s and was converted in 1978 to a private school, Angelicum School. The mansion now houses the"
