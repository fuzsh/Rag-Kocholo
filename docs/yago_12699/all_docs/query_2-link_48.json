        "text": "ENRIQUE TELÉMACO SUSINI\n\nBuenos Aires, Argentina\n\nJanuary 31, 1891 – April 7, 1972\n\nAt the age of 14, he finished high school at Colegio Nacional de Buenos Aires and traveled with his family to Vienna when his father (Telémaco Susini, the first otorhinolaryngologist in the country and an outstanding scientific researcher) was appointed consul. He enrolled in Medical School in Vienna while also teaching violin and singing at the Imperial Conservatory. He studies physics and chemistry in Paris and Berlin. He returned to Buenos Aires and studied medicine at the University of Buenos Aires. At the age of 23 he graduated after an award-winning thesis. In Europe, he specialized in otorhinolaryngology and introduced phoniatrics in Argentina.\n\nHe worked as a journalist for national and foreign newspapers as a correspondent in both World Wars. He was hired by the Navy to carry out scientific research and received the National Award for Scientific Production. As a radio enthusiast, his practice was more than a hobby, it was a passion through which he investigated and transformed the world.\n\nStarting with the first radio transmission with Los Locos de la Azotea, he became the first radio announcer in history. Later, he continued to innovate with the long-distance telecommunications company Vía Radiar. Alongside Los Locos de la Azotea, he co-founded Estudios Lumiton.\n\nSusini became the first Argentinian director to be nominated for an international film award with the film La Chismosa at the Venice Film Festival in 1938. In 1948, while working as a professor of phoniatrics at the National Conservatory of Music, he met Alicia Arderius, his future wife, who would accompany him for the rest of his life. With this lyrical singer of marvelous voice, he produced numerous musicals. On October 17, 1951, the first television broadcast in Argentina took place, with Susini being the one who recorded and documented the event as General Director and cameraman, later assuming the artistic direction of Channel 7.\n\nHe is the author and director of Madama Lynch, the first Argentinan musical. He presided over the Sociedad de Empresarios Teatrales (Society of Theater Entrepreneurs).\n\nHe wrote and directed numerous plays in theaters such as La Scala in Milan. As a member of the Administrative Commission of Teatro Colón, he established stable casts and schools. He was the director of the First Film Festival of Mar del Plata and a board member of the Argentinian Association of Film Directors. He was an advisory member of the Instituto Nacional de Cinematografía and an executive member of the Academia de Artes y Ciencias Cinematográficas de Argentina.\n\nIn parallel to his great activity, he continued to practice his profession as a phoniatrist treating great stars such as Carlos Gardel and María Callas. In his last years he regretted that the end was near because he said he still had much to do.\n\nJohn Alton\n\nSopron, Hungary | May 10, 1901\n\nLos Angeles, USA | February 2, 1996\n\nCinematographer for MGM and Paramount, head of the Camera Department of Joinville Studios (Paris).\n\nHe arrived in Buenos Aires on April 20, 1932 to join the Lumiton team. After marrying the Argentinian journalist Rozalia Kiss, Alton settled in the country for 7 years. He moved from Lumiton to Argentina Sono Film, contributing to the development of the Argentinian Film industry.\n\nLater, he returned to Hollywood, where he had an extensive career and was known as one of the key figures in film noir. In 1951 he received an Oscar for his first color film, An American in Paris, directed by Vincent Minnelli."
