        "text": "Transit timing analysis of the exoplanets TrES-1 and TrES-2\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nRabus, M.; Deeg, H. J.; Alonso, R.; Belmonte, J. A.; Almenara, J. M.\n\n2009-12-01\n\nAims. The aim of this work is a detailed analysis of transit light curves from TrES-1 and TrES-2, obtained over a period of three to four years, in order to search for variabilities in observed mid-transit times and to set constraints on the presence of additional third bodies. Methods: Using the IAC 80 cm telescope, we observed transits of TrES-1 and TrES-2 over several years. Based on these new data and previously published work, we studied the observed light curves and searched for variations in the difference between observed and calculated (based on a fixed ephemeris) transit times. To model possible transit timing variations, we used polynomials of different orders, simulated O-C diagrams corresponding to a perturbing third mass, and we used sinusoidal fits. For each model we calculated the Ï2 residuals and the false alarm probability (FAP). Results: For TrES-1, we can exclude planetary companions (>1 Mâ) in the 3:2 and 2:1 MMRs having high FAPs based on our transit observations from the ground. Likewise, a light time effect caused, e.g., by a 0.09 M_â mass star at a distance of 7.8 AU is possible. As for TrES-2, we find a better ephemeris of Tc = 2 453 957.63512(28) + 2.4706101(18) Ã Epoch and a good fit for a sine function with a period of 0.2 days, compatible with a moon around TrES-2 and an amplitude of 57 s, but it is not a uniquely low Ï2 value that would indicate a clear signal. In both cases, TrES-1 and TrES-2, we are able to put upper constraints on the presence of additional perturbers masses. We also conclude that any sinusoidal variations that might be indicative of exomoons need to be confirmed with higher statistical significance by further observations, noting that TrES-2 is in the field-of-view of the Kepler Space Telescope. Photometric data for TrES-1 and TrES-2 are only available in electronic form at the CDS via anonymous ftp to cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr (130.79.128.5) or via http://cdsweb.u-strasbg.fr/cgi-bin/qcat?J/A+A/508/1011\n\nPoco Graphite Mirror Metrology Report\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nKester, Thomas J.\n\n2005-01-01\n\nRecently a lightweight mirror technology was tested at Marshall Space Flight Center's Space Optic Manufacturing Technology Center (MSFC, SOMTC). The mirror is a Poco Graphite CVD Si clad SiC substrate. It was tested for cryogenic (cryo) survivability to 20deg Kelvin in SOMTC's X-ray Calibration and Cryogenic Test Facility. The surface figure of the mirror was measured before and after cry0 cycling. The test technique and results are discussed.\n\nDetected Timing for Exoplanet TrES-5b. Possible Existence of Exoplanet TrES-5c\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSokov, E. N.; Sokova, I. A.; Dyachenko, V. V.; Rastegaev, D. A.; Rusov, S. A.\n\n2017-06-01\n\nIn this paper, we present timing variations detected for the TrES-5b exoplanet. To obtain necessary photometric data for this exoplanet, we have organized an international campaign for exoplanet searching based on the Transit Timing Variation (TTV) method. We managed to collect N light curves for TrEs-5b. On the basis of the obtained data, we detected timing variations with the period P â 100 days. We carried out the N-body modelling by means of the three-body problem. We detected a perturbation of TrES-5b which can be caused by a second exoplanet in the TrES-5 system. We calculated possible masses and resonances of the objects: M Ë 0.24 Mjup on the 1:2 Resonance and M Ë 3.15 Mjup on the 1:3 Resonance.\n\nLinfoma Nasal de CÃ©lulas T/Natural Killer Extranodal Refractario Mal Diagnosticado, Tratado de Manera Exitosa: Informe de Caso.\n\nPubMed\n\nSaavedra RamÃ­rez, JosÃ© Domingo\n\n2017-01-01\n\nEl linfoma de cÃ©lulas T/natural killer extranodal (\"extranodal natural killer/T-cell lymphoma\", ENKL) nasal es un linfoma no Hodgkin (LNH) agresivo y poco comÃºn para el cual no se ha establecido un tratamiento de referencia claro, especialmente en el escenario de la enfermedad recidivante/refractaria.

En la literatura existen pocos casos reportados en los cuales el aire se encuentra localizado exclusivamente en las regiones selar y supraselar, constituyendo un pneumatocele selar. En este artÃ­culo se describe un caso inusual de pneumatocele selar a tensiÃ³n de presentaciÃ³n tardÃ­a. DescripciÃ³n del caso: Una mujer de 57 aÃ±os consultÃ³ por hemianopsia bitemporal. Previamente, ya se le habÃ­a realizado una cirugÃ­a transnasal por un adenoma hipofisario y se le habÃ­a colocado una derivaciÃ³n lumbo-peritoneal por la presencia de una fÃ­stula de lÃ­quido cefalorraquÃ­deo. AdemÃ¡s, se le habÃ­a realizado una resecciÃ³n transcraneal de un componente intracavernoso del tumor y radiocirugÃ­a debido a la agresividad del mismo. Se llevÃ³ a cabo una resonancia magnÃ©tica que demostrÃ³ un pneumatocele selar y supraselar. IntervenciÃ³n: Se realizÃ³ un abordaje transciliar. La regiÃ³n selar estaba encapsulada por tejido cicatrizal debido a los procedimientos previos. Se abriÃ³ la cicatriz y el aire fue evacuado. Posteriormente, el piso selar fue cerrado con grasa y cola de fibrina. DespuÃ³s del procedimiento, su campo visual retornÃ³ a la normalidad. Un aÃ±o despuÃ©s de su Ãºltima cirugÃ­a, continua asintomÃ¡tica. ConclusiÃ³n: El pneumatocele selar y supraselar a tensiÃ³n es un hallazgo extremadamente raro luego de una cirugÃ­a transesfenoidal. Su manifestaciÃ³nw clÃ­nica serÃ­a la alteraciÃ³n visual debida a la compresiÃ³n inferior de la vÃ­a Ã³ptica. El pneumatocele selar a tensiÃ³n debe ser evacuado en un corto plazo.

The approach offers the ability to detect the initial stages of insulin aggregation at the molecular level. The data analysis has revealed the existence of at least three fluorescent species undergoing dielectric relaxation and significant spectral changes due to insulin aggregation. The results indicate the suitability of the intrinsic TRES approach for insulin studies and for monitoring its stability during storage and aggregation in insulin delivery devices.\n\nPOCO-MOEA: Using Evolutionary Algorithms to Solve the Controller Placement Problem\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n2016-03-24\n\nto gather data on POCO-MOEA performance to a series of iv model networks.

Design within CASoS requires the fostering of a new discipline, CASoS Engineering, and the building of capability to support it. Towards this primary objective, we created the Phoenix Pilot as a crucible from which systemization of the new discipline could emerge. Using a wide range of applications, Phoenix has begun building both theoretical foundations and capability for: the integration of Applications to continuously build common understandingmoreÂ Â» and capability; a Framework for defining problems, designing and testing solutions, and actualizing these solutions within the CASoS of interest; and an engineering Environment required for 'the doing' of CASoS Engineering.

C.; Agol, E.\n\n2013-02-10\n\nThe Apache Point Survey of Transit Lightcurves of Exoplanets (APOSTLE) observed 11 transits of TrES-3b over two years in order to constrain system parameters and look for transit timing and depth variations. We describe an updated analysis protocol for APOSTLE data, including the reduction pipeline, transit model, and Markov Chain Monte Carlo analyzer. Our estimates of the system parameters for TrES-3b are consistent with previous estimates to within the 2{sigma} confidence level. We improved the errors (by 10%-30%) on system parameters such as the orbital inclination (i {sub orb}), impact parameter (b), and stellar density ({rho}{sub *}) compared to previousmoreÂ Â» measurements. The near-grazing nature of the system, and incomplete sampling of some transits, limited our ability to place reliable uncertainties on individual transit depths and hence we do not report strong evidence for variability. Our analysis of the transit timing data shows no evidence for transit timing variations and our timing measurements are able to rule out super-Earth and gas giant companions in low-order mean motion resonance with TrES-3b.Â«Â less\n\nSYSTEM PARAMETERS, TRANSIT TIMES, AND SECONDARY ECLIPSE CONSTRAINTS OF THE EXOPLANET SYSTEMS HAT-P-4, TrES-2, TrES-3, and WASP-3 FROM THE NASA EPOXI MISSION OF OPPORTUNITY\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nChristiansen, Jessie L.; Ballard, Sarah; Charbonneau, David\n\n2011-01-10\n\nAs part of the NASA EPOXI Mission of Opportunity, we observed seven known transiting extrasolar planet systems in order to construct time series photometry of extremely high phase coverage and precision. Here we present the results for four 'hot-Jupiter systems' with near-solar stars-HAT-P-4, TrES-3, TrES-2, and WASP-3. We observe 10 transits of HAT-P-4, estimating the planet radius R{sub p} = 1.332 {+-} 0.052 R{sub Jup}, the stellar radius R{sub *} = 1.602 {+-} 0.061 R{sub sun}, the inclination i = 89.67 {+-} 0.30 deg, and the transit duration from first to fourth contact {tau} = 255.6 {+-} 1.9 minutes. FormoreÂ Â» TrES-3, we observe seven transits and find R{sub p} = 1.320 {+-} 0.057 R{sub Jup}, R{sub *} = 0.817 {+-} 0.022 R{sub sun}, i = 81.99 {+-} 0.30 deg, and {tau} = 81.9 {+-} 1.1 minutes. We also note a long-term variability in the TrES-3 light curve, which may be due to star spots. We observe nine transits of TrES-2 and find R{sub p} = 1.169 {+-} 0.034 R{sub Jup}, R{sub *} = 0.940 {+-} 0.026 R{sub sun}, i = 84.15 {+-} 0.16 deg, and {tau} = 107.3 {+-} 1.1 minutes. Finally, we observe eight transits of WASP-3, finding R{sub p} = 1.385 {+-} 0.060 R{sub Jup}, R{sub *} = 1.354 {+-} 0.056 R{sub sun}, i = 84.22 {+-} 0.81 deg, and {tau} = 167.3 {+-} 1.3 minutes. We present refined orbital periods and times of transit for each target. We state 95% confidence upper limits on the secondary eclipse depths in our broadband visible bandpass centered on 650 nm. These limits are 0.073% for HAT-P-4, 0.062% for TrES-3, 0.16% for TrES-2, and 0.11% for WASP-3. We combine the TrES-3 secondary eclipse information with the existing published data and confirm that the atmosphere likely does not have a temperature inversion.Â«Â less\n\nSÃ­ndrome de Grisel en el adulto e inestabilidad crÃ¡neo cervical. OdontoidectomÃ­a endoscÃ³pica transnasal y fijaciÃ³n occÃ­pito-cervical. Reporte de caso y revisiÃ³n de literatura\n\nPubMed Central\n\nHerrera, Roberto; Rojas, HÃ©ctor; Estramian, Ariel; GÃ³mez, Julieta; Ledesma, JosÃ© Luis; Pablo, JosÃ©; Pastore, JuliÃ¡n\n\n2018-01-01\n\nResumen IntroducciÃ³n: La patologÃ­a de la uniÃ³n crÃ¡neo-cervical es poco frecuente en la prÃ¡ctica neuroquirÃºrgica diaria. En general la mayor parte de estas lesiones son de origen traumÃ¡tico o reumatolÃ³gico. La inestabilidad atlanto-axial de origen inflamatorio (SÃ­ndrome de Grisel) es una rara entidad de la que solo se han reportado 16 casos adultos en la literatura. Esta patologÃ­a se caracteriza por el desarrollo de una lesiÃ³n osteolÃ­tica a nivel de la articulaciÃ³n atlanto-axoidea posterior a un evento infeccioso, generalmente de las vÃ­as aÃ©reas superiores. DescripciÃ³n del caso: Presentamos el caso de una paciente de 76 aÃ±os quien concurre en consulta por un cuadro clÃ­nico de inestabilidad crÃ¡neo espinal secundaria a una lesiÃ³n osteolÃ­tica, con compromiso de C1 y C2. La sintomatologÃ­a comenzÃ³ posteriormente a un proceso infeccioso respiratorio. Se realizÃ³ una fijaciÃ³n occÃ­pito-cervical posterior y una OdontoidectomÃ­a con descompresiÃ³n anterior por vÃ­a endoscÃ³pica transnasal. La paciente evolucionÃ³ con resoluciÃ³n completa de los sÃ­ntomas. Los cultivos fueron negativos y el estudio de anatomÃ­a patolÃ³gica concluyÃ³ cambios inflamatorios inespecÃ­ficos. ConclusiÃ³n: Hasta hace algunos pocos aÃ±os la Ãºnica opciÃ³n para abordar esta patologÃ­a era la vÃ­a transoral con tÃ©cnica microquirÃºrgica.

SuperSiC has excellent thermal properties and cryogenic stability. It exhibits exceptional polishability for reflective optics with high strength, stiffness, and excellent thermal conductivity. A lightweighted 0.2-diameter polished SuperSic mirror was tested at cryogenic temperature at NASMSFC. Optical test results showed 6nm cry0 deformation from ambient to 30 degrees Kelvin and little to no change in its surface figure due to cry0 cycling.\n\nPhotometric investigation of hot exoplanets: TrES-3b and Qatar-1b\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nPÃ¼skÃ¼llÃ¼, Ã.; Soydugan, F.; Erdem, A.; Budding, E.\n\n2017-08-01\n\nNew photometric follow-up observations of transitting 'hot Jupiters' TrES-3b and Qatar-1b are presented. Weighted mean values of the solutions of light curves in R-filter for both planetary systems are reported and compared with the previous results. The transit light curves were analysed using the WINFITTER code. The physical properties of the planets were estimated. The planet radii are found to be Rp = 1.381 Â± 0.033RJ for TrES-3b and Rp = 1.142 Â± 0.025RJ for Qatar-1b. Transit times and their uncertainties were also determined and a new linear ephemeris was computed for both systems. Analysis of transit times showed that a significant signal could not be determined for TrES-3b, while weak evidence was found for Qatar-1b, which might be tested using more precise future transit times.\n\nPlanetary transit observations at the University Observatory Jena: TrES-2\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nRaetz, St.; Mugrauer, M.; Schmidt, T. O. B.; Roell, T.; Eisenbeiss, T.; Hohle, M. M.; Koeltzsch, A.; VaÅko, M.; Ginski, Ch.; Marka, C.; Moualla, M.; Tetzlaff, N.; Seifahrt, A.; Broeg, Ch.; Koppenhoefer, J.; Raetz, M.; NeuhÃ¤user, R.\n\n2009-05-01\n\nWe report on observations of several transit events of the transiting planet TrES-2 obtained with the Cassegrain-Teleskop-Kamera at the University Observatory Jena. Between March 2007 and November 2008 ten different transits and almost a complete orbital period were observed. Overall, in 40 nights of observation 4291 exposures (in total 71.52 h of observation) of the TrES-2 parent star were taken. With the transit timings for TrES-2 from the 34 events published by the TrES-network, the Transit Light Curve project and the Exoplanet Transit Database plus our own ten transits, we find that the orbital period is P=(2.470614Â± 0.000001) d, a slight change by Ë 0.6 s compared to the previously published period. We present new ephemeris for this transiting planet. Furthermore, we found a second dip after the transit which could either be due to a blended variable star or occultation of a second star or even an additional object in the system. Our observations will be useful for future investigations of timing variations caused by additional perturbing planets and/or stellar spots and/or moons. Based on observations obtained with telescopes of the University Observatory Jena, which is operated by the Astrophysical Institute of the Friedrich-Schiller-University Jena and the 80cm telescope of the Wendelstein Observatory of the Ludwig-Maximilians-University Munich.\n\nSeismic Activity at tres Virgenes Volcanic and Geothermal Field\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nAntayhua, Y. T.; Lermo, J.; Quintanar, L.; Campos-Enriquez, J. O.\n\n2013-05-01\n\nThe volcanic and geothermal field Tres Virgenes is in the NE portion of Baja California Sur State, Mexico, between -112Â°20'and -112Â°40' longitudes, and 27Â°25' to 27Â°36' latitudes. Since 2003 Power Federal Commission and the Engineering Institute of the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) initiated a seismic monitoring program. The seismograph network installed inside and around the geothermal field consisted, at the beginning, of Kinemetrics K2 accelerometers; since 2009 the network is composed by Guralp CMG-6TD broadband seismometers. The seismic data used in this study covered the period from September 2003 - November 2011. We relocated 118 earthquakes with epicenter in the zone of study recorded in most of the seismic stations. The events analysed have shallow depths (â¤10 km), coda Magnitude Mcâ¤2.4, with epicentral and hypocentral location errors <2 km. These events concentrated mainly below Tres Virgenes volcanoes, and the geothermal explotation zone where there is a system NW-SE, N-S and W-E of extensional faults. Also we obtained focal mechanisms for 38 events using the Focmec, Hash, and FPFIT methods. The results show normal mechanisms which correlate with La Virgen, El Azufre, El Cimarron and Bonfil fault systems, whereas inverse and strike-slip solutions correlate with Las Viboras fault. Additionally, the Qc value was obtained for 118 events. This value was calculated using the Single Back Scattering model, taking the coda-waves train with window lengths of 5 sec. Seismograms were filtered at 4 frequency bands centered at 2, 4, 8 and 16 Hz respectively. The estimates of Qc vary from 62 at 2 Hz, up to 220 at 16 Hz. The frequency-Qc relationship obtained is Qc=40Â±2f(0.62Â±0.02), representing the average attenuation characteristics of seismic waves at Tres Virgenes volcanic and geothermal field. This value correlated with those observed at other geothermal and volcanic fields.\n\nDetection of Planetary Emission from the Exoplanet TrES-2 Using Spitzer/IRAC\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nDonovan, Francis T.; Charbonneau, David; Harrington, Joseph; Madhusudhan, N.; Seager, Sara; Deming, Drake; Knutson, Heather A.\n\n2010-01-01\n\nWe present here the results of our observations of TrES-2 using the Infrared Array Camera on Spitzer. We monitored this transiting system during two secondary eclipses, when the planetary emission is blocked by the star. The resulting decrease in flux is 0.127% +/- 0.021%, 0.230% +/- 0.024%, 0.199% +/- 0.054%, and 0.359% +/- 0.060% at 3.6 microns, 4.5 microns, 5.8 microns, and 8.0 microns, respectively. We show that three of these flux contrasts are well fit by a blackbody spectrum with T(sub eff) = 1500 K, as well as by a more detailed model spectrum of a planetary atmosphere. The observed planet-to-star flux ratios in all four lRAC channels can be explained by models with and without a thermal inversion in the atmosphere of TrES-2, although with different atmospheric chemistry. Based on the assumption of thermochemical equilibrium, the chemical composition of the inversion model seems more plausible, making it a more favorable scenario. TrES-2 also falls in the category of highly irradiated planets which have been theoretically predicted to exhibit thermal inversions. However, more observations at infrared and visible wavelengths would be needed to confirm a thermal inversion in this system. Furthermore, we find that the times of the secondary eclipses are consistent with previously published times of transit and the expectation from a circular orbit. This implies that TrES-2 most likely has a circular orbit, and thus does not obtain additional thermal energy from tidal dissipation of a non-zero orbital eccentricity, a proposed explanation for the large radius of this planet.

J. W.; Snellen, I. A. G.\n\n2009-01-01\n\nContext: Secondary eclipse measurements of transiting extrasolar planets with the Spitzer Space Telescope have yielded several direct detections of thermal exoplanet light. Since Spitzer operates at wavelengths longward of 3.6 Î¼m, arguably one of the most interesting parts of the planet spectrum (from 1 to 3 Î¼m) is inaccessible with this satellite. This region is at the peak of the planet's spectral energy distribution and is also the regime where molecular absorption bands can significantly influence the measured emission. Aims: So far, 2.2 Î¼m K-band secondary eclipse measurements, which are possible from the ground, have not yet lead to secure detections. The aim of this paper is to measure the secondary eclipse of the very hot Jupiter TrES-3b in K-band, and in addition to observe its transit, to obtain an accurate planet radius in the near infrared. Methods: We have used the william herschell telescope (WHT) to observe the secondary eclipse, and the united kingdom infrared telescope (UKIRT) to observe the transit of TrES-3b. Both observations involved significant defocusing of the telescope, aimed to produce high-cadence time series of several thousand frames at high efficiency, with the starlight spread out over many pixels. Results: We detect the secondary eclipse of TrES-3b with a depth of -0.241 Â± 0.043% (~6Ï). This corresponds to a day-side brightness temperature of TB(2.2 Î¼m) = 2040 Â± 185 K, which is consistent with current models of the physical properties of this planet's upper atmosphere. The centre of the eclipse seems slightly offset from phase Ï=0.5 by ÎÏ = -0.0042 Â± 0.0027, which could indicate that the orbit of TrES-3b is non-circular. Analysis of the transit data shows that TrES-3b has a near-infrared radius of 1.338 Â± 0.016 R_Jup, showing no significant deviation from optical measurements.\n\nAn analysis of the transit times of TrES-1b\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSteffen, Jason H.; Agol, Eric\n\n2005-11-01\n\nThe presence of a second planet in a known, transiting-planet system will cause the time between transits to vary. These variations can be used to constrain the orbital elements and mass of the perturbing planet. We analyse the set of transit times of the TrES-1 system given in Charbonneau et al. We find no convincing evidence for a second planet in the TrES-1 system from those data. By further analysis, we constrain the mass that a perturbing planet could have as a function of the semi-major axis ratio of the two planets and the eccentricity of the perturbing planet. Near low-order, mean-motion resonances (within ~1 per cent fractional deviation), we find that a secondary planet must generally have a mass comparable to or less than the mass of the Earth - showing that these data are the first to have sensitivity to sub-Earth-mass planets. We compare the sensitivity of this technique to the mass of the perturbing planet with future, high-precision radial velocity measurements.\n\nATMOSPHERE AND SPECTRAL MODELS OF THE KEPLER-FIELD PLANETS HAT-P-7b AND TrES-2\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nSpiegel, David S.; Burrows, Adam, E-mail: dsp@astro.princeton.ed, E-mail: burrows@astro.princeton.ed\n\n2010-10-10\n\nWe develop atmosphere models of two of the three Kepler-field planets that were known prior to the start of the Kepler mission (HAT-P-7b and TrES-2). We find that published Kepler and Spitzer data for HAT-P-7b appear to require an extremely hot upper atmosphere on the dayside, with a strong thermal inversion and little day-night redistribution. The Spitzer data for TrES-2 suggest a mild thermal inversion with moderate day-night redistribution. We examine the effect of nonequilibrium chemistry on TrES-2 model atmospheres and find that methane levels must be adjusted by extreme amounts in order to cause even mild changes in atmosphericmoreÂ Â» structure and emergent spectra. Our best-fit models to the Spitzer data for TrES-2 lead us to predict a low secondary eclipse planet-star flux ratio ({approx}<2 x 10{sup -5}) in the Kepler bandpass, which is consistent with what very recent observations have found. Finally, we consider how the Kepler-band optical flux from a hot exoplanet depends on the strength of a possible extra optical absorber in the upper atmosphere. We find that the optical flux is not monotonic in optical opacity, and the non-monotonicity is greater for brighter, hotter stars.Â«Â less\n\nDesign Considerations for the Installation of an Iodine (I2) Cell onto TRES\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nGarcia-Mejia, Juliana\n\n2017-01-01\n\nThe radial velocity (RV) method utilizes the reflex motion of a target star to predict the presence of one or multiple exoplanets. However, the disparity in mass between planet and host star often results in RV oscillations below the precision of most modern spectrographs. Such is the case of TRES, the Tillinghast Reflector Echelle Spectrograph located in the Fred Lawrence Whipple Observatory in Mt. Hopkins, Arizona, with a radial velocity (RV) precision of ~ 20 m s-1, dominated by instrumental effects. Since 1992, the iodine cell technique, presented in Butler et al.(1992) has become widely used for the reduction of RV measurement errors. Here, we describe the beginning stages in the installation of one such cell onto TRES. After traveling to the telescope site to perform the first fitting of the iodine stage, I designed, built and fitted the first prototype of an improved thermal insulation system for the front end of the spectrograph, where the cell will be mounted. Here I present such a design, as well as a detailed description of the current state of the project. We expect the iodine cell to be fully functional in approximately 1 year. Once the cell is installed, we expect errors in radial velocity measurements to decrease by an order of magnitude from the aforementioned 20 m s-1. This increase in precision will come with an increase in stability of radial velocity measurements, allowing TRES to perform in-house spectroscopy of more nearby bright targets and high-cadence exoplanet follow-up.\n\nA Spitzer five-band analysis of the Jupiter-sized planet TrES-1\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nCubillos, Patricio; Harrington, Joseph; Foster, Andrew S. D.\n\n2014-12-10\n\nWith an equilibrium temperature of 1200 K, TrES-1 is one of the coolest hot Jupiters observed by Spitzer. It was also the first planet discovered by any transit survey and one of the first exoplanets from which thermal emission was directly observed. We analyzed all Spitzer eclipse and transit data for TrES-1 and obtained its eclipse depths and brightness temperatures in the 3.6 Î¼m (0.083% Â± 0.024%, 1270 Â± 110 K), 4.5 Î¼m (0.094% Â± 0.024%, 1126 Â± 90 K), 5.8 Î¼m (0.162% Â± 0.042%, 1205 Â± 130 K), 8.0 Î¼m (0.213% Â± 0.042%, 1190 Â± 130 K), and 16moreÂ Â» Î¼m (0.33% Â± 0.12%, 1270 Â± 310 K) bands. The eclipse depths can be explained, within 1Ï errors, by a standard atmospheric model with solar abundance composition in chemical equilibrium, with or without a thermal inversion. The combined analysis of the transit, eclipse, and radial-velocity ephemerides gives an eccentricity of e=0.033{sub â0.031}{sup +0.015}, consistent with a circular orbit. Since TrES-1's eclipses have low signal-to-noise ratios, we implemented optimal photometry and differential-evolution Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms in our Photometry for Orbits, Eclipses, and Transits pipeline. Benefits include higher photometric precision and â¼10 times faster MCMC convergence, with better exploration of the phase space and no manual parameter tuning.Â«Â less\n\n[Anorexia nervosa as a cause of acute liver failure.

Compositions and quench products were identified optically and by X-ray. Limited solid solution of CaSO4 in K2SO4 was found. There is a eutectic at 875??C and 34 wt. per cent CaSO4. Calcium langbeinite melts incongruently at 1011??C. The melting-point of CaSO4 (1462??C) was determined by the quenching technique using sealed platinum tubes. The only intermediate crystalline phase found in the system is K2SO4??2CaSO4 (calcium langbeinite). ?? 1965.\n\nThermally stimulated luminescence studies of undoped, Cu- and Mn-doped CaSO4 compounds\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nManam, J.; Das, S.\n\nThermally stimulated luminescence (TSL) of undoped and doped CaSO4 with activators such as Cu and Mn has been investigated. The polycrystalline samples of undoped and doped CaSO4 are prepared by the melting method. The formation of CaSO4 compound is confirmed by X-ray diffraction and Fourier transform infrared studies. Scanning electron microscopic studies of CaSO4 are also carried out. The TSL glow curves of undoped CaSO4, Cu- and Mn-doped CaSO4 are studied. Comparison of the thermoluminescence (TL) intensity of the most intensive glow peak of Cu-doped CaSO4 compound with that of undoped CaSO4 shows that addition of Cu impurity in CaSO4 compound enhances the TL intensity by about four times. However, the addition of Mn impurity to undoped CaSO4 increases the TL intensity by about three times when compared with that of undoped CaSO4. The TL-dose dependence of all three samples was studied and was observed to be almost linear in the studied range of irradiation time. Among the samples studied, namely undoped CaSO4 and Cu- and Mn-doped CaSO4, Cu-doped CaSO4 is found to be the most sensitive. The trap parameters, namely order of kinetics (b), activation energy (E) and frequency factor (s) associated with the most intensive glow peaks of CaSO4:Mn, CaSO4:Cu and CaSO4 phosphors were determined using the glow curve shape (Chen's) method.\n\nMulti-band transit observations of the TrES-2b exoplanet\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMislis, D.; SchrÃ¶ter, S.; Schmitt, J. H. M. M.; Cordes, O.; Reif, K.\n\n2010-02-01\n\nWe present a new data set of transit observations of the TrES-2b exoplanet taken in spring 2009, using the 1.2 m Oskar-LÃ¼hning telescope (OLT) of Hamburg Observatory and the 2.2 m telescope at Calar Alto Observatory using BUSCA (Bonn University Simultaneous CAmera). Both the new OLT data, taken with the same instrumental setup as our data taken in 2008, as well as the simultaneously recorded multicolor BUSCA data confirm the low inclination values reported previously, and in fact suggest that the TrES-2b exoplanet has already passed the first inclination threshold (imin,1 = 83.417Â°) and is not eclipsing the full stellar surface any longer. Using the multi-band BUSCA data we demonstrate that the multicolor light curves can be consistently fitted with a given set of limb darkening coefficients without the need to adjust these coefficients, and further, we can demonstrate that wavelength dependent stellar radius changes must be small as expected from theory. Our new observations provide further evidence for a change of the orbit inclination of the transiting extrasolar planet TrES-2b reported previously. We examine in detail possible causes for this inclination change and argue that the observed change should be interpreted as nodal regression. While the assumption of an oblate host star requires an unreasonably large second harmonic coefficient, the existence of a third body in the form of an additional planet would provide a very natural explanation for the observed secular orbit change. Given the lack of clearly observed short-term variations of transit timing and our observed secular nodal regression rate, we predict a period between approximately 50 and 100 days for a putative perturbing planet of Jovian mass. Such an object should be detectable with present-day radial velocity (RV) techniques, but would escape detection through transit timing variations.

We find a central transit time of T{sub c} = 2454997.76286 {+-} 0.00035 HJD, an orbital period of P = 2.4706127 {+-} 0.0000009 days, and an inclination angle of i = 83.{sup 0}92 {+-} 0{sup 0}.05, which is consistent with our re-fit of the original I-band light curve of O'Donovan et al. where we find i = 83.{sup 0}84 {+-} 0{sup 0}.05. We calculate an insignificant inclination change of {Delta}i =moreÂ Â» -0.{sup 0}08 {+-} 0{sup 0}.07 over the last three years, and as such, our observations rule out, at the {approx}11{sigma} level, the apparent change of orbital inclination to i{sub predicted} = 83.{sup 0}35 {+-} 0{sup 0}.1 as predicted by Mislis and Schmitt and Mislis et al. for our epoch. Moreover, our analysis of a recently published Kepler Space Telescope light curve for TrES-2b finds an inclination of i = 83.{sup 0}91 {+-} 0.{sup 0}03 for a similar epoch. These Kepler results definitively rule out change in i as a function of time. Indeed, we detect no significant changes in any of the orbital parameters of TrES-2b.Â«Â less\n\nThe ternary system K2SO4MgSO4CaSO4\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nRowe, J.J.; Morey, G.W.; Silber, C.C.\n\n1967-01-01\n\nMelting and subsolidus relations in the system K2SO4MgSO4CaSO4 were studied using heating-cooling curves, differential thermal analysis, optics, X-ray diffraction at room and high temperatures and by quenching techniques. Previous investigators were unable to study the binary MgSO4CaSO4 system and the adjacent area in the ternary system because of the decomposition of MgSO4 and CaSO4 at high temperatures. This problem was partly overcome by a novel sealed-tube quenching method, by hydrothermal synthesis, and by long-time heating in the solidus. As a result of this study, we found: (1) a new compound, CaSO4??3MgSO4 (m.p. 1201??C) with a field extending into the ternary system; (2) a high temperature form of MgSO4 with a sluggishly reversible inversion. An X-ray diffraction pattern for this polymorphic form is given; (3) the inversion of ??-CaSO4 (anhydrite) to ??-CaSO4 at 1195??C, in agreement with grahmann; (1) (4) the melting point of MgSO4 is 1136??C and that of CaSO4 is 1462??C (using sealed tube methods to prevent decomposition of the sulphates); (5) calcium langbeinite (K2SO4??2CaSO4) is the only compound in the K2SO4CaSO4 binary system. This resolved discrepancies in the results of previous investigators; (6) a continuous solid solution series between congruently melting K2SOP4??2MgSO4 (langbeinite) and incongruently melting K2SO4??2CaSO4 (calcium langbeinite); (7) the liquidus in the ternary system consists of primary phase fields of K2SO4, MgSO4, CaSO4, langbeinite-calcium langbeinite solid solution, and CaSO4??3MgSO4. The CaSO4 field extends over a large portion of the system. Previously reported fields for the compounds (K2SO4??MgSO4??nCaSO4), K2SO4??3CaSO4 and K2SO4??CaSO4 were not found; (8) a minimum in the ternary system at: 740??C, 25% MgSO4, 6% CaSO4, 69% K2SO4; and ternary eutectics at 882??C, 49% MgSO4, 19% CaSO4, 32% K2SO4; and 880??, 67??5% MgSO4, 5% CaSO4, 27??5% K2SO4. ?? 1967.\n\nPHOTOMETRICALLY DERIVED MASSES AND RADII OF THE PLANET AND STAR IN THE TrES-2 SYSTEM\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nBarclay, Thomas; Huber, Daniel; Rowe, Jason F.\n\nWe measure the mass and radius of the star and planet in the TrES-2 system using 2.7 years of observations by the Kepler spacecraft. The light curve shows evidence for ellipsoidal variations and Doppler beaming on a period consistent with the orbital period of the planet with amplitudes of 2.79{sup +0.44}{sub -0.62} and 3.44{sup +0.32}{sub -0.37} parts per million (ppm), respectively, and a difference between the dayside and the nightside planetary flux of 3.41{sup +0.55}{sub -0.82} ppm. We present an asteroseismic analysis of solar-like oscillations on TrES-2A which we use to calculate the stellar mass of 0.94 {+-} 0.05 M{submoreÂ Â» Sun} and radius of 0.95 {+-} 0.02 R{sub Sun }. Using these stellar parameters, a transit model fit and the phase-curve variations, we determine the planetary radius of 1.162{sup +0.020}{sub -0.024} R{sub Jup} and derive a mass for TrES-2b from the photometry of 1.44 {+-} 0.21 M{sub Jup}. The ratio of the ellipsoidal variation to the Doppler beaming amplitudes agrees to better than 2{sigma} with theoretical predications, while our measured planet mass and radius agree within 2{sigma} of previously published values based on spectroscopic radial velocity measurements. We measure a geometric albedo of 0.0136{sup +0.0022}{sub -0.0033} and an occultation (secondary eclipse) depth of 6.5{sup +1.7}{sub -1.8} ppm which we combined with the day/night planetary flux ratio to model the atmosphere of TrES-2b. We find that an atmosphere model that contains a temperature inversion is strongly preferred. We hypothesize that the Kepler bandpass probes a significantly greater atmospheric depth on the night side relative to the day side.Â«Â less\n\nStudying CaSO4:Eu as an OSL phosphor\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nGuckan, Veysi; Altunal, Volkan; Nur, Necmettin; Depci, Tolga; Ozdemir, Adnan; Kurt, Kasim; Yu, Yan; Yegingil, Ihami; Yegingil, Zehra\n\n2017-09-01\n\nThis study was carried out to investigate the properties of the OSL signal from Eu-doped calcium sulfate (CaSO4:Eu) phosphor and study on its thermal behavior as a function of temperature under a series of luminescence experiments. The suitability of its usage as an optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dosimeter was also checked. CaSO4:Eu was synthesized using the precipitation method and prepared in pellet form. The dopant concentration value was performed as 0.1 mol%. The synthesized CaSO4:Eu was analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) method to confirm the product. To have an idea about the crystallography and microstructure morphology of the material, scanning electron microscope (SEM) analysis were carried out. It was found that the OSL signal is a resultant signal having three components and exhibits thermal quenching above 150 Â°C. The excitation spectrum of CaSO4:Eu showed different peaks in the region 220-360 nm with the highest one at 269 nm. Thermoluminescence (TL) signals of CaSO4:Eu pellets were obtained and compared with the TL signals obtained after OSL measurements of the same pellets by blue light stimulation. The low temperature peak near 180 Â°C did not show any significant change in TL after OSL measurement whereas the high temperature peak at 240 Â°C was bleached with the blue light illumination and might be responsible for the observed OSL signal. The dosimetric properties such as dose response, minimum detectable dose, energy response, reusability, fading properties, thermal stability and effect of reading temperatures on OSL signals were examined. OSL signals of CaSO4:Eu pellets were decreased by approximately 8% at the end of the 24 h and by about 7% at the end of 28 days when compared with the first readout. The thermal stability of the â¼240 Â°C TL peak and OSL signal using isothermal decay measurements were used to determine the trap parameters.

The photometry is of unprecedented precision, 237 ppm minute{sup -1}, allowing for the most accurate determination of the transit parameters yet obtained for this system. Global fits of the transit photometry, radial velocities, and known transit times are used to obtain a self-consistent set of refined parameters for this system, including updated stellar and planetary parameters. Special attention is paid to fitting for limb darkening and eccentricity. We place an upper limit on the occultationmoreÂ Â» depth to be <72.9 ppm to 3{sigma} confidence, indicating TrES-2b has the lowest determined geometric albedo for an exoplanet, of A{sub g} < 0.146. We also produce a transit timing analysis using Kepler's SC data and demonstrate exceptional timing precision at the level of a few seconds for each transit event. With 18 fully sampled transits at such high precision, we are able to produce stringent constraints on the presence of perturbing planets, Trojans, and extrasolar moons. We introduce the novel use of control data to identify phasing effects. We also exclude the previously proposed hypotheses of short-period transit time variation and additional transits but find that the hypothesis of long-term inclination change is neither supported nor refuted by our analysis.Â«Â less\n\nVariable Stars in the Field of TrES-3b (Abstract)\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nAadland, E.\n\n2018-06-01\n\n(Abstract only) The star field around the exoplanet TrES-3b has potential for finding unknown variable stars.

Combined light curves fitting is carried out independently by using two different analysis packages, allowing the corroboration of the orbital and physical parameters in the literature. Results find no differences in the relative radius with the observing filter. In particular, we report for HAT-P-3b a first estimation of the planet-to-star radius {R}p/{R}* ={0.1112}-0.0026+0.0025 in the B band which is coherent with values found in the VRIzâ§JH filters. Concerning TrES-3b, we derive a value for the orbital period of P = 1.3061862 Â± 0.0000001 days which shows no linear variations over nine years of photometric observations.\n\nTrES-5: A MASSIVE JUPITER-SIZED PLANET TRANSITING A COOL G DWARF\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nMandushev, Georgi; Dunham, Edward W.; Quinn, Samuel N.\n\n2011-11-10\n\nWe report the discovery of TrES-5, a massive hot Jupiter that transits the star GSC 03949-00967 every 1.48 days. From spectroscopy of the star we estimate a stellar effective temperature of T{sub eff} = 5171 {+-} 36 K, and from high-precision B, R, and I photometry of the transit we constrain the ratio of the semimajor axis a and the stellar radius R{sub *} to be a/R{sub *} = 6.07 {+-} 0.14. We compare these values to model stellar isochrones to obtain a stellar mass of M{sub *} = 0.893 {+-} 0.024 M{sub Sun }. Based on this estimate andmoreÂ Â» the photometric time series, we constrain the stellar radius to be R{sub *} = 0.866 {+-} 0.013 R{sub Sun} and the planet radius to be R{sub p} = 1.209 {+-} 0.021 R{sub J}. We model our radial-velocity data assuming a circular orbit and find a planetary mass of 1.778 {+-} 0.063 M{sub J}. Our radial-velocity observations rule out line-bisector variations that would indicate a specious detection resulting from a blend of an eclipsing binary system. TrES-5 orbits one of the faintest stars with transiting planets found to date from the ground and demonstrates that precise photometry and followup spectroscopy are possible, albeit challenging, even for such faint stars.Â«Â less\n\nRecombination luminescence of CaSO4:Tb3+ and CaSO4:Gd3+phosphors\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKudryavtseva, Irina; Lushchik, Aleksandr; Maaroos, Aarne; Azmaganbetova, Zhannur; Nurakhmetov, Turlybek; Salikhoja, Zhussupbek\n\n2012-08-01\n\nA comparative study of the excitation of luminescence by VUV radiation as well as of thermally and photostimulated luminescence has been carried out for CaSO4:Tb3+ and CaSO4:Gd3+ phosphors, where Na+ or F- ions are used for charge compensation. The distinction in hole processes for the phosphors with Na+ or F- compensators is determined by the differing thermal stability of the holes localized at/near Tb3+Na+ and Gd3+Na+ (up to 100-160 K) or at/near Tb3+F- V Ca and Gd3+F- V Ca centers involving also a cation vacancy (up to 400-550 K). Tunnel luminescence in the pairs of localized electrons and holes nearby Tb3+ or Gd3+ has been detected. The mechanisms of electron-hole, hole-electron and tunnel recombination luminescence as well as a subsequent released energy transfer to RE3+ ions are considered.\n\nPlanetary Transits of the Trans-Atlantic Exoplanet Survey Candidate TrES-1b\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nPrice, A.; Bissinger, R.; Laughlin, G.

A.; Michalik, T.; Wellington, T.; Paakkonen, P.\n\n2005-08-01\n\nThe AAVSO compiled 10,560 CCD observations of the suspected exoplanet transit object TrES-1b covering seven complete transit windows, three windows of partial coverage, and coverage of baseline non-transit periods. Visual inspection of the light curves reveals the presence of slight humps at the egress points of some transits. A boot strap Monte Carlo simulation was applied to the data to confirm that the humps exist to a statistically significant degree. However, it does not rule out systemic effects which will be tested with campaigns in the 2005 observing season.\n\nTHE TRANSIT LIGHT-CURVE PROJECT. XIV. CONFIRMATION OF ANOMALOUS RADII FOR THE EXOPLANETS TrES-4b, HAT-P-3b, AND WASP-12b\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nChan, Tucker; Ingemyr, Mikael; Winn, Joshua N.\n\n2011-06-15\n\nWe present transit photometry of three exoplanets, TrES-4b, HAT-P-3b, and WASP-12b, allowing for refined estimates of the systems' parameters. TrES-4b and WASP-12b were confirmed to be 'bloated' planets, with radii of 1.706 {+-} 0.056R{sub Jup} and 1.736 {+-} 0.092R{sub Jup}, respectively. These planets are too large to be explained with standard models of gas giant planets. In contrast, HAT-P-3b has a radius of 0.827 {+-} 0.055R{sub Jup}, smaller than a pure hydrogen-helium planet and indicative of a highly metal-enriched composition. Analyses of the transit timings revealed no significant departures from strict periodicity. For TrES-4, our relatively recent observations allow formoreÂ Â» improvement in the orbital ephemerides, which is useful for planning future observations.Â«Â less\n\nNEAR-INFRARED THERMAL EMISSION FROM THE HOT JUPITER TrES-2b: GROUND-BASED DETECTION OF THE SECONDARY ECLIPSE\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nCroll, Bryce; Jayawardhana, Ray; Albert, Loic\n\n2010-07-10\n\nWe present near-infrared Ks-band photometry bracketing the secondary eclipse of the hot Jupiter TrES-2b using the Wide-field Infrared Camera on the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope. We detect its thermal emission with an eclipse depth of 0.062{sup +0.013}{sub -0.011}% (5{sigma}). Our best-fit secondary eclipse is consistent with a circular orbit (a 3{sigma} upper limit on the eccentricity, e, and argument or periastron, {omega}, of |e cos {omega}| < 0.0090), in agreement with mid-infrared detections of the secondary eclipse of this planet. A secondary eclipse of this depth corresponds to a dayside Ks-band brightness temperature of T{sub B} = 1636{sup +79}{sub -88} K. OurmoreÂ Â» thermal emission measurement, when combined with the thermal emission measurements using Spitzer/IRAC from O'Donovan and collaborators, suggests that this planet exhibits relatively efficient dayside to nightside redistribution of heat and a near isothermal dayside atmospheric temperature structure, whose spectrum is well approximated by a blackbody. It is unclear if the atmosphere of TrES-2b requires a temperature inversion; if it does it is likely due to chemical species other than TiO/VO as the atmosphere of TrES-2b is too cool to allow TiO/VO to remain in gaseous form. Our secondary eclipse has the smallest depth of any detected from the ground, at around 2 {mu}m, to date.Â«Â less\n\nIMP Supersite vs Pico de Tres Padres: The first few hours of mixing and oxidation during the MCMA-2006/MILAGRO Campaign\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHerndon, S.; Onasch, T.; Wood, E.; Knighton, B.; Zavala, M.; Mazzoleni, C.; Thornhill, D.; Marr, L.; Kolb, C.; Molina, L. T.\n\n2007-05-01\n\nThe Aerodyne Research, Inc. (ARI) mobile laboratory was deployed in the Mexico City Metropolitan Area (MCMA) for the full month of March 2006 to support the MCMA-2006/MAX-Mex/MILAGRO research project activities, in collaboration with other MCMA-2006 research groups (see information on MCMA-2006/MILAGRO posted at http:www.mce2.org). The ratios of various volatile organic compounds (VOCs) to combustion tracer species such as CO and CO2 are compared at one of the supersites (T0) and Pico de Tres Padres. T0 (located at the Mexican Petroleum Institute, IMP) is heavily influenced by various emission sources in the local area, predominantly roadway traffic. Pico de Tres Padres is an isolated, privately owned mountain located within the Mexico City Metropolitan Area (MCMA). It rises 1000 m above the MCMA basin floor and is located about halfway between T0 and T1. The airmasses analyzed at Pico de Tres Padres seem to be mixed urban emissions absent of high frequency spikes of CO, NO or CO2. Relationships between VOCs, and combustion tracers will be used to gain a crude understanding of the initial photochemical processing of the urban emissions. How the initial photochemical processing of Mexico City's air may relate to secondary aerosol production is also explored.\n\nCaSO4:DY,Mn: A new and highly sensitive thermoluminescence phosphor for versatile dosimetry\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBahl, Shaila; Lochab, S. P.; Kumar, Pratik\n\n2016-02-01\n\nWith the advent of newer techniques for dose reduction coupled with the development of more sensitive detectors, the radiation doses in radiological medical investigation are decreasing. Nevertheless, keeping the tenet in mind that all radiation doses could entail risk, there is a need to develop more sensitive dosimeters capable of measuring low doses. This paper gives the account of the development of a new and sensitive phosphor CaSO4:Dy,Mn and its characterization. The standard production procedure based on the recrystallization method was used to prepare CaSO4:Dy,Mn. The Thermoluminescence (TL) studies were carried out by exposing it with gamma radiation (Cs-137) from 10 Î¼Gy to 100 Gy. The theoretical studies to determine the number of peaks and kinetic parameters related to the TL glow peaks in CaSO4:Dy,Mn was performed using the Computerized Glow Curve Deconvolution (CGCD) method. Experiments were performed to determine optimum concentration of the dopants Dysprosium (Dy) and Mangnese (Mn) in the host CaSO4 so that maximum sensitivity of the phosphor may be achieved. The optimum dopant concentration turned out to be 0.1 mol%. As there were two dopants Dy and Mn their relative ratio were varied in steps of 0.025 keeping the concentration of total dopant (Dy and Mn) 0.1 mol% always. The maximum TL intensity was seen in the CaSO4:Dy(0.025),Mn(0.075) combination. The TL sensitivity of this phosphor was found to be about 2 and 1.8 times higher than that of popular phosphor CaSO4:Dy and LiF:Mg,Cu,P (TLD-700H) respectively. This new phosphor CaSO4:Dy,Mn showed fading of 11% which is similar to that of the standard phosphor CaSO4:Dy. The paper concludes that the new, highly sensitive TL phosphor CaSO4:Dy,Mn has shown higher sensitivity and hence the potential to replace commonly used CaSO4:Dy.\n\n77 FR 40628 - Draft Safe Harbor Agreement and Application for an Enhancement of Survival Permit for the Tres...\n\nFederal Register 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014\n\n2012-07-10\n\n...-FF02ENEH00] Draft Safe Harbor Agreement and Application for an Enhancement of Survival Permit for the Tres... permit application and the associated draft Safe Harbor Agreement (SHA).

P.; Couto dos Santos, Marcos A.; Nunes, Luiz A. O.; Souza, Divanizia N.\n\n2014-02-01\n\nA new composite based on CaSO4, using terbium as dopant and ytterbium as co-dopant (CaSO4:Tb,Yb), was developed for employment as a thermoluminescent (TL) dosimeter. The crystals used in this work were grown using a production route based on the Yamashita method (Yamashita et al., 1968). Crystal powder was calcined at 600 Â°C for 1 h. Pellets were made by adding commercial and colorless glass to improve physical resistance and sintered at 700 Â°C for 6 h. All samples were irradiated by a beta source (90Sr/90Y) and received doses from 1 Gy to 5 Gy. TL analyses have been performed and characteristics such as sensitivity, reproducibility, linearity, and fading have been studied. The CaSO4:Tb,Yb pellets glow curves presented two peaks, the first at around 115 Â°C, and the second at around 200 Â°C. The highest intensity was shown for CaSO4:Tb,Yb with a concentration of 0.1 mol% of Tb and Yb together. In all the samples the TL response was proportional to the absorbed dose. Therefore, the CaSO4:Tb,Yb has potential to be used as a thermoluminescent dosimeter.\n\nTransmission spectroscopy of the hot Jupiter TrES-3 b: Disproof of an overly large Rayleigh-like feature\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMackebrandt, F.; Mallonn, M.; Ohlert, J.

Transit events of extrasolar planets offer the opportunity to study the composition of their atmospheres. Previous work on transmission spectroscopy of the close-in gas giant (TrES)-3 b revealed an increase in absorption towards blue wavelengths of very large amplitude in terms of atmospheric pressure scale heights, too large to be explained by Rayleigh-scattering in the planetary atmosphere. Aims: We present a follow-up study of the optical transmission spectrum of the hot Jupiter TrES-3 b to investigate the strong increase in opacity towards short wavelengths found by a previous study. Furthermore, we aim to estimate the effect of stellar spots on the transmission spectrum. Methods: This work uses previously published long slit spectroscopy transit data of the Gran Telescopio Canarias (GTC) and published broad band observations as well as new observations in different bands from the near-UV to the near-IR, for a homogeneous transit light curve analysis. Additionally, a long-term photometric monitoring of the TrES-3 host star was performed. Results: Our newly analysed GTC spectroscopic transit observations show a slope of much lower amplitude than previous studies. We conclude from our results the previously reported increasing signal towards short wavelengths is not intrinsic to the TrES-3 system. Furthermore, the broad band spectrum favours a flat spectrum. Long-term photometric monitoring rules out a significant modification of the transmission spectrum by unocculted star spots. Based on (1) data obtained with the STELLA robotic telescopes in Tenerife, an AIP facility jointly operated by AIP and IAC, (2) observations collected at the German-Spanish Astronomical Center, Calar Alto, jointly operated by the Max-Planck-Institut fÃ¼r Astronomie Heidelberg and the Instituto de AstrofÃ­sica de AndalucÃ­a (CSIC) and (3) observations made with the Italian Telescopio Nazionale Galileo (TNG) operated on the island of La Palma by the FundaciÃ³n Galileo Galilei of\n\nPossible Transit Timing Variations of the TrES-3 Planetary System\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nJiang, Ing-Guey; Yeh, Li-Chin; Thakur, Parijat; Wu, Yu-Ting; Chien, Ping; Lin, Yi-Ling; Chen, Hong-Yu; Hu, Juei-Hwa; Sun, Zhao; Ji, Jianghui\n\n2013-03-01\n\nFive newly observed transit light curves of the TrES-3 planetary system are presented.

From these observational data, the system's orbital parameters are determined and possible transit timing variations (TTVs) are investigated. Given that a null TTV produces a fit with reduced Ï2 = 1.52, our results agree with previous work, that TTVs might not exist in these data. However, a one-frequency oscillating TTV model, giving a fit with a reduced Ï2 = 0.93, does possess a statistically higher probability. It is thus concluded that future observations and dynamical simulations for this planetary system will be very important.\n\nPOSSIBLE TRANSIT TIMING VARIATIONS OF THE TrES-3 PLANETARY SYSTEM\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nJiang, Ing-Guey; Wu, Yu-Ting; Chien, Ping\n\n2013-03-15\n\nFive newly observed transit light curves of the TrES-3 planetary system are presented.

S.; Dhoble, S. J.; Pandey, R. K.; Upadhyay, A. K.; Khokhar, M. S. K.\n\n2011-01-01\n\nThe mechanoluminescence (ML) and thermoluminescence (TL) of Î³-irradiated CaSO4:Eu phosphor have been studied. CaSO4 samples having different concentrations of Eu were prepared by dissolving CaSO4.2H2O in sulphuric acid and evaporating the excess acid around 300 Â°C. ML was excited impulsively by dropping a load onto the sample. Three distinct peaks have been observed in the ML intensity versus time curve. The ML intensity increases with the increasing concentration of the dopant. The effect of temperature on the shape and peak of ML intensity was also recorded. Growth, saturation and broadening in an ML peak were observed. TL glow curves of CaSO4:Eu phosphors at different concentrations contain two TL peaks: the first peak was observed at around 110 Â°C and the other at 210 Â°C. Experimental results suggest that the ML excitation is related to the movement of dislocation with defect centres, the increase in ML with temperature is due to the enhancement in dislocation capture probability, and the reduction is due to the thermal bleaching of defect centres.\n\nExperimental Comparison of Calcium Sulfate (CaSO(4)) Scale Deposition on Coated Carbon Steel and Titanium Surfaces\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nAl-Otaibi, Dhawi AbdulRahman\n\nCalcium Sulfate (CaSO4) deposit reduces heat exchange in heat transfer equipment which adversely affects the equipment performance and plant production. This experimental study was conducted by using the Rotating Cylinder Electrode (RCE) equipment available in the university's Center for Engineering Research (CER/RI) to study and compare the effect of solution hydrodynamics on Calcium Sulfate (CaSO4) scale deposition on coated carbon steel and titanium surfaces. In addition, the Scanning Electron Microscopic was used to examine the morphology and distribution of Calcium Sulfate (CaSO 4) crystals deposited on titanium metal surfaces. In this study, the rotational speed was varied from 100 to 2000 RPM to study the behavior of Calcium Sulfate (CaSO4) accumulation on both materials. Based on the experimental results, Calcium Sulfate (CaSO4) scale obtained in the present study was almost constant on coated carbon steel in which the rate of scale deposition is equal to the rate of scale removal. However, the deposition of Calcium Sulfate (CaSO4) observed on titanium material was increased as the speed increased.\n\nTRES survey of variable diffuse interstellar bands\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLaw, Charles J.; Milisavljevic, Dan; Crabtree, Kyle N.; Johansen, Sommer L.; Patnaude, Daniel J.; Margutti, Raffaella; Parrent, Jerod T.; Drout, Maria R.; Sanders, Nathan E.; Kirshner, Robert P.; Latham, David W.\n\n2017-09-01\n\nDiffuse interstellar bands (DIBs) are absorption features commonly observed in optical/near-infrared spectra of stars and thought to be associated with polyatomic molecules that comprise a significant reservoir of organic material in the Universe. However, the central wavelengths of almost all DIBs do not correspond with electronic transitions of known atomic or molecular species and the specific physical nature of their carriers remains inconclusive despite decades of observational, theoretical and experimental research. It is well established that DIB carriers are located in the interstellar medium, but the recent discovery of time-varying DIBs in the spectra of the extragalactic supernova SN 2012ap suggests that some may be created in massive star environments. Here, we report evidence of short time-scale (â¼10-60 d) changes in DIB absorption line substructure towards 3 of 17 massive stars observed as part of a pathfinder survey of variable DIBs conducted with the 1.5-m Tillinghast telescope and Tillinghast Reflector Echelle Spectrograph (TRES) at Fred L. Whipple Observatory. The detections are made in high-resolution optical spectra (R â¼ 44 000) having signal-to-noise ratios of 5-15 around the 5797 and 6614 Ã features, and are considered significant but requiring further investigation. We find that these changes are potentially consistent with interactions between stellar winds and DIB carriers in close proximity. Our findings motivate a larger survey to further characterize these variations and may establish a powerful new method for probing the poorly understood physical characteristics of DIB carriers.\n\nCharacterizing Giant Exoplanets through Multiwavelength Transit Observations: HAT-P-14 b & TrES-1 b\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nRivera, Daniel Ivan; Cole, Jackson Lane; Gardner, Cristilyn N.; Garver, Bethany Ray; Jarka, Kyla L.; Kar, Aman; McGough, Aylin Marie; PeQueen, David Jeffrey; Kasper, David; Jang-Condell, Hannah; Kobulnicky, Henry; Dale, Daniel\n\n2018-01-01\n\nMuch current work focuses on characterizing exoplanets.

Complementary data from the literature are utilized to supplement our analysis.

In this work, the kinetic behavior of CaSO4 dissolved in NaCl solution was investigated by means of conductivity meter. The results show that with the increase of concentration of NaCl, the temperature rise and the time prolonged, the dissolution rate of dihydrate CaSO4 gradually increases, and the dissolved apparent activation energy is gradually decreased. When the NaCl concentration is 1.8%, the dissolution kinetic equation is 1-(1-Î±) 1/3=5.46*10-4exp (-9147/RT) t; When the NaCl concentration is 3.0%, the dissolution kinetic equation is 1-(1-Î±) 1/3=2.81Ã10-4 exp (-6753/RT)t; When the NaCl concentration is 3.6%, the dissolution kinetic equation is 1-(1-Î±) 1/3=3.07Ãl0-4exp(-6103/RT)t.\n\nNanophosphor CaSO4:Eu2+ for photoluminescence liquid crystal display (PLLCD)\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nPatle, Anita; Patil, R.

Synthesized phosphor was characterized by XRD, SEM, TEM and PL measurements. Average particle size is found to be in the range 80-100nm with Hexagonal morphology and PL studies showed emission peaks at 380nm, when samples were excited by 254nm. The observed PL emission is characteristic emission of Eu2+ similar to that observed in bulk CaSO4:Eu2. However under identical condition it is observed that intensity of emission get enhanced for 0.01M size which is doubled to that of 0.1M with similar emission at 380nm. A phosphor with narrow emission band around 390 nm is desirable, since at this wavelength the transmission of standard glass, polarizing plastic, other coating and LCD material is at acceptable level. Strong Eu2+ emission is observed in CaSO4:Eu nanophosphor which finds applications for PLLCD (photoluminescent liquid crystal display).\n\nAn alternative method for immediate dose estimation using CaSO4:Dy based TLD badges\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSingh, A. K.; Menon, S. N.; Dhabekar, Bhushan; Kadam, Sonal; Chougaonkar, M. P.; Babu, D. A. R.\n\n2014-11-01\n\nCaSO4:Dy based Thermoluminescence dosimeters (TLDs) are being used in country wide personnel monitoring program in India. The TL glow curve of CaSO4:Dy consists of a dosimetric peak at 220 Â°C and a low temperature peak at 120 Â°C which is unstable at room temperature. The TL integral counts in CaSO4:Dy reduces by 15% in seven days after irradiation due to the thermal fading of 120 Â°C TL peak. As the dosimetric procedure involves total integrated counts for dose conversion, the dosimeters are typically read about a week after receiving. However in the event of a suspected over exposure, where urgent processing is expected, this poses limitation. Post irradiation annealing treatment is used in such cases of immediate readout of cards. In this paper we report a new and easier to use technique based on optical bleaching for the urgent processing of TLD cards. Optical bleaching with green LED (â¼555 nm photons) of 25,000 lux for one and half hour removes the low temperature TL peak without affecting the dosimetric peak. This method can be used for immediate dose estimation using CaSO4:Dy based TLD badges.\n\nA new species of Myotis from the Islas Tres Marias, Nayarit, Mexico, with comments on variation in Myotis nigricans\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nBogan, Michael A.\n\n1978-01-01\n\nA new Myotis is described from the Islas Tres Marias, Nayarit, Mexico. the new species is distinct from related taxa n the adjacent Mexican mainland (M. californicus, M. leibii, and M. carteri), although most closely related to M. carteri as shown by univariate and canonical variates analyses. An analysis of six groups of M. nigricans from Middle and South America supports the elevation of M. nigricans carteri to specific status, confirms the distinctness of M. nigricus extremus, but fails to substantiate subspecific status for bats from Columbia and Ecuador, recent recognized as M. n. punensis.\n\nX-ray absorption spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy studies of CaSO 4:Dy thermoluminescent phosphors\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBakshi, A.

K.; Bhattacharyya, D.\n\n2007-11-01\n\nExtended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) measurements have been carried out on CaSO4:Dy phosphor samples at the Dy L3 edge with synchrotron radiation. Measurements were carried out on a set of samples which were subjected to post-preparation annealing at different temperatures and for different cycles. The EXAFS data have been analysed to find the Dy-S and Dy-O bond lengths in the neighbourhood of the Dy atoms in a CaSO4 matrix. The observations from EXAFS measurements were verified with XANES and XPS techniques. On the basis of these measurements, efforts were made to explain the loss of thermoluminescence sensitivity of CaSO4:Dy phosphors after repeated cycles of annealing at 400 Â°C in air for 1 h.\n\nMeningiomas del foramen magno: Reporte de 12 casos y revisiÃ³n de la literatura\n\nPubMed Central\n\nCampero, Ãlvaro; Ajler, Pablo; Roman, Guillermo; Rivadeneira, Conrado\n\n2017-01-01\n\nResumen Objetivo: El propÃ³sito del presente trabajo es presentar los resultados de 12 pacientes con diagnÃ³stico de meningiomas del foramen magno (MFM), de localizaciÃ³n anterior o lateral, operados con tÃ©cnicas microquirÃºrgicas. MÃ©todo: Desde Junio de 2005 a Diciembre de 2016, 12 pacientes con diagnÃ³stico de MFM fueron intervenidos quirÃºrgicamente. Se evaluÃ³: edad, sexo, localizaciÃ³n de la lesiÃ³n (anterior o lateral), sintomatologÃ­a, tipo de abordaje utilizado y resultados postoperatorios. Resultados: De los pacientes intervenidos, 8 fueron mujeres y 4 varones. La edad promedio fue de 47 aÃ±os. La localizaciÃ³n fue anterior en 8 casos y lateral en 4 casos. La sintomatologÃ­a mÃ¡s frecuente fue dolor occipito-cervical (8 casos), seguido de tetraparesia (3 casos). En los pacientes con MFM de localizaciÃ³n anterior se realizÃ³ un abordaje extremo-lateral transcondilar (ELTC), mientras que en los tumores laterales el abordaje fue extremo-lateral retrocondilar (ELRC). En 10 casos la resecciÃ³n fue completa. En dos pacientes fue necesario dejar una pequeÃ±a lÃ¡mina de meningioma sobre la arteria vertebral y a nivel del foramen yugular. Como complicaciones postoperatorias, 3 pacientes presentaron una paresia del XII nervio craneano y 2 pacientes paresia del XI nervio craneano; ademÃ¡s, 1 paciente presentÃ³ una fÃ­stula de LCR.

Through a numerical simulation method, this paper calculates the deposition rate of CaSO4 fouling on heat transfer surfaces of the plate heat exchanger under saturation in the bulk. The effects of CaSO4 concentration in the range 0.7 kg/m3 to 1.5 kg/m3, inlet flow velocity under turbulent flow, and the fluid's inlet temperature from 288 K to 328 K on the deposition rate, removal mass rate and fouling resistance are investigated. The simulation results are compared with the experimental results showing similar trend. The simulation results show that the concentration and the flow velocity affect significantly the fouling characteristics in the plate heat exchanger. The deposition mass rate, removal mass rate, and asymptotic value of fouling resistance all increase with the increase in CaSO4 concentration and the inlet temperature of the hot fluid, while the asymptotic value of fouling resistance decreases with the increasing of inlet flow velocity. The influence of the inlet temperature of cold fluid may be negligible.\n\nImpact de la varicocÃ¨le sur le volume testiculaire et les paramÃ¨tres spermatiques\n\nPubMed Central\n\nBenazzouz, Mohamed Hicham; Essatara, Younes; El Sayegh, Hachem; Iken, Ali; Benslimane, Lounis; Nouini, Yassine\n\n2014-01-01\n\nIntroduction La varicocÃ¨le est une pathologie masculine frÃ©quente dont l'incidence est encore plus importante dans dans la population des hommes infertiles. Si ses mÃ©canismes sont Ã ce jour incomplÃ¨tement expliquÃ©s il semble acquis que la varicocÃ¨le peut Ãªtre associÃ©e a une dysfonction testiculaire avec diminution du volume testiculaire et de la concentration en spermatozoÃ¯de de lâÃ©jaculat. MÃ©thodes Dans un premier temps nous exposons les rÃ©sultats d'une Ã©tude rÃ©trospective sur 5 ans (de Mars 2009 Ã Mars 2014), rÃ©alisÃ©e au service d'urologie A de l'hÃ´pital Ibn Sina de Rabat et ayant comme objectif dâÃ©valuer l'impact de la varicocÃ¨le palpable sur le volume testiculaire et les paramÃ¨tres spermatiques. Tous les patients inclus dans notre Ã©tude avaient une varicocÃ¨le palpable. Dans un deuxiÃ¨me temps, et Ã travers une revue de la littÃ©rature nous discutons l'impact du traitement de la varicocÃ¨le sur la fertilitÃ©. RÃ©sultats 39 patients ont Ã©tÃ© inclus dans notre Ã©tude. LâÃ¢ge moyen Ã©tait de 29,71 ans et la varicocÃ¨le siÃ©geait dans 89,74% des cas du cotÃ© gauche. Une atrophie testiculaire homolatÃ©rale Ã la varicocÃ¨le Ã©tait retrouvÃ©e dans 7% des cas alors que des anomalies du spermogramme se voyaient dans 69,23% des cas. Conclusion L'impact de la varicocÃ¨le sur l'altÃ©ration des paramÃ¨tres spermatiques a Ã©tÃ© clairement Ã©tabli bien que sa physio pathogÃ©nie ne soit pas bien Ã©lucidÃ©e. Le traitement chirurgical de la varicocÃ¨le semble indiquÃ© chez les hommes infertiles prÃ©sentant une varicocÃ¨le clinique et une altÃ©ration significative du sperme.

We detect the secondary eclipse of TrES-3b with a depth of 0.133{sup +0.018}{sub -0.016}% in the Ks band (8{sigma})-a result that is in sharp contrast to the eclipse depth reported by de Mooij and Snellen. We do not detect its thermal emission in the H band, but place a 3{sigma} limit of 0.051% on the depth of the secondary eclipse in this band. A secondary eclipse of this depth in Ks requires very efficient day-to-nightside redistributionmoreÂ Â» of heat and nearly isotropic reradiation, a conclusion that is in agreement with longer wavelength, mid-infrared Spitzer observations. Our 3{sigma} upper limit on the depth of our H-band secondary eclipse also argues for very efficient redistribution of heat and suggests that the atmospheric layer probed by these observations may be well homogenized. However, our H-band upper limit is so constraining that it suggests the possibility of a temperature inversion at depth, or an absorbing molecule, such as methane, that further depresses the emitted flux at this wavelength. The combination of our near-infrared measurements and those obtained with Spitzer suggests that TrES-3b displays a near-isothermal dayside atmospheric temperature structure, whose spectrum is well approximated by a blackbody. We emphasize that our strict H-band limit is in stark disagreement with the best-fit atmospheric model that results from longer wavelength observations only, thus highlighting the importance of near-infrared observations at multiple wavelengths, in addition to those returned by Spitzer in the mid-infrared, to facilitate a comprehensive understanding of the energy budgets of transiting exoplanets.Â«Â less\n\nPhase relation of CaSO4 at high pressure and temperature up to 90 GPa and 2300 K\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nFujii, Taku; Ohfuji, Hiroaki; Inoue, Toru\n\n2016-05-01\n\nCalcium sulfate (CaSO4), one of the major sulfate minerals in the Earth's crust, is expected to play a major role in sulfur recycling into the deep mantle. Here, we investigated the crystal structure and phase relation of CaSO4 up to ~90 GPa and 2300 K through a series of high-pressure experiments combined with in situ X-ray diffraction. CaSO4 forms three thermodynamically stable polymorphs: anhydrite (stable below 3 GPa), monazite-type phase (stable between 3 and ~13 GPa) and barite-type phase (stable up to at least 93 GPa). Anhydrite to monazite-type phase transition is induced by pressure even at room temperature, while monazite- to barite-type transition requires heating at least to 1500 K at ~20 GPa. The barite-type phase cannot always be quenched from high temperature and is distorted to metastable AgMnO4-type structure or another modified barite structure depending on pressure. We obtained the pressure-volume data and density of anhydrite, monazite- and barite-type phases and found that their densities are lower than those calculated from the PREM model in the studied P-T conditions. This suggests that CaSO4 is gravitationally unstable in the mantle and fluid/melt phase into which sulfur dissolves and/or sulfate-sulfide speciation may play a major role in the sulfur recycling into the deep Earth.\n\nThermoluminescence (TL) properties and x-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis of high purity CaSO4:Dy TL material\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKamarudin, Nadira; Abdullah, Wan Saffiey Wan; Hamid, Muhammad Azmi Abdul; Dollah, Mohd Taufik\n\n2014-09-01\n\nThis paper presents the characterization and TL properties of dysprosium (Dy) doped calcium sulfate (CaSO4) TL material produced by co-precipitation technique with 0.5mol% concentration of dopant. The morphology of the produced TL material was studied using scanning electron microscope (SEM) and the micrograph shows that rectangular parallelepiped shaped crystal with the average of 150 Î¼m in length were produced. The crystallinity of the produced powder was studied using x-ray powder diffraction (XRD). The XRD spectra show that the TL material produced is high purity anhydrite CaSO4 with average crystallite size of 74 nm with orthorhombic crystal system. The TL behavior of produced CaSO4:Dy was studied using a TLD reader after exposure to gamma ray by Co60 source with the doses of 1,5 and 10 Gy. The glow curve shows linear response with glow peak around 230Â°C which is desired development in the field of radiation dosimetry.\n\nInsights into water-mediated ion clustering in aqueous CaSO4 solutions: pre-nucleation cluster characteristics studied by ab initio calculations and molecular dynamics simulations.\n\nPubMed\n\nLi, Hui-Ji; Yan, Dan; Cai, Hou-Qin; Yi, Hai-Bo; Min, Xiao-Bo; Xia, Fei-Fei\n\n2017-05-10\n\nThe molecular structure of growth units building crystals is a fundamental issue in the crystallization processes from aqueous solutions. In this work, a systematic investigation of pre-nucleation clusters and their hydration characteristics in aqueous CaSO 4 solutions was performed using ab initio calculations and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The results of ab initio calculations and MD simulations indicate that the dominant species in aqueous CaSO 4 solutions are monodentate ion-associated structures. Compared with charged ion clusters, neutral clusters are more likely to be present in an aqueous CaSO 4 solution. Neutral (CaSO 4 ) m clusters are probably the growth units involved in the pre-nucleation or crystallization processes. Meanwhile, hydration behavior around ion associated species in aqueous CaSO 4 solutions plays an important role in related phase/polymorphism selections. Upon ion clustering, the residence of some water molecules around Ca 2+ in ion-associated species is weakened while that of some bridging waters is enhanced due to dual interaction by Ca 2+ and SO 4 2- . Some phase/polymorphism selections can be achieved in aqueous CaSO 4 solutions by controlling the hydration around pre-nucleation clusters. Moreover, the association trend between calcium and sulfate is found to be relatively strong, which hints at the low solubility of calcium sulfate in water.\n\nNano-fibrin stabilized CaSO4 crystals incorporated injectable chitin composite hydrogel for enhanced angiogenesis & osteogenesis.\n\nPubMed\n\nArun Kumar, R; Sivashanmugam, A; Deepthi, S; Bumgardner, Joel D; Nair, Shantikumar V; Jayakumar, R\n\n2016-04-20\n\nCalcium sulfate (CaSO4), an excellent biodegradable bone forming agent that is an ideal choice as additive in gels, however, its disadvantage being poor gel rheology and angiogenesis. Here, we have synthesized chitin-CaSO4-nano-fibrin based injectable gel system which shows improved rheology and angiogenic potential. Rheological studies showed that the composite gel was a shear thinning gel with elastic modulus of 15.4Â±0.275kPa; a 1.67 fold increase over chitin control. SEM and XRD analyses revealed the effect of nano-fibrin (nFibrin) in transforming CaSO4 crystal shape from needle to hexagonal. It also masked the retarding effect of CaSO4 towards in vitro early cell attachment and angiogenesis using rabbit adipose derived mesenchymal stem cells (rASCs) and HUVECs, respectively. rASCs osteogenesis was confirmed by spectrophotometric endpoint assay, which showed 6-fold early increase in alkaline phosphatase levels and immuno-cytochemistry analysis. These in vitro results highlight the potential of injectable chitin-CaSO4-nFibrin gel for osteo-regeneration via enhanced angiogenesis. Copyright Â© 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

To inhibit CaSO 4 scale formation in artificial cooling water systems, well-defined low molecular weight maleic anhydride and n-alkylacrylamide copolymers (YMR-S series) were synthesized via nitroxide-mediated radical polymerization initiated by benzoyl peroxide in the presence of 2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-1-piperidinyloxy at varying concentrations. These polymerizations exhibit living polymerization characteristics; that is, they show linear growth in chain length as a function of monomer conversion, and have narrow molecular weight distributions. Resultant polymers were characterized by means of 1 H-NMR and 13 C-NMR. The inhibition behavior of these YMR-S series polymers against CaSO 4 was evaluated using the static scale inhibition method and a dynamic tube block test. The inhibition ability on the CaSO 4 scale is 99.5% with 9â ppm dosage level at pH 10.45 and temperature 70Â°C. Scanning electronic microscope analysis proved the morphological changes of the CaSO 4 scales due to the strong inhibition action of YMR-S polymers. It is also observed that the antiscaling effect of the copolymers greatly depends on the molecular weight, and the optimum range is below 20,000 and approximately in the range 500-2000.\n\nDynamic study of the upper Sao Francisco River and the Tres Marias reservoir using MSS/LANDSAT images. [Brazil\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nDejesusparada, N. (Principal Investigator); Sausen, T. M.\n\n1981-01-01\n\nThe use of LANDSAT multispectral ban scanner imagery to verify the relationship between the behavior of the Tres Marias reservoir and the dynamics of the Sao Francisco River supply basin is described. The dispersion of suspended sediments and their concentration in the surface layers of the water are considered. A five year survey of the region during both dry and rainy seasons was performed. The drainage network was analyzed based on the patterns of dessication, water rises and soil use in the supply basin. Surface layers of the reservoir were tabulated as a function of the levels of gray in the imagery. In situ observations of water depth and reflectance were performed. Ground truth and LANDSAT data were correlated to determine the factors affecting the dynamics of the supply basin.\n\nRemoval of Calcium from Scheelite Leaching Solution by Addition of CaSO4 Inoculating Crystals\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLiu, Wenting; Li, Yongli; Zeng, Dewen; Li, Jiangtao; Zhao, Zhongwei\n\n2018-04-01\n\nIn this work, the solubility behaviors of gypsum and anhydrite in the H2SO4-H3PO4-H2O system were investigated over the temperature range T = 30-80Â°C, and the results showed that the solubility of anhydrite was considerably lower than that of gypsum. On the basis of the differential solubilities of gypsum and anhydrite, a method was developed to remove calcium from the scheelite leaching solution by adding anhydrite as an inoculating crystal. The effects of the reaction time, concentration of the CaSO4 inoculating crystals, and temperature were investigated. With an addition of CaSO4 inoculating crystals at a concentration of 60 g/L, the Ca2+ concentration of the scheelite leaching solution decreased to a low level of approximately 0.76 g/L after 10 h at 70Â°C.\n\nPhotometric Follow-up Transit (Primary Eclipse) Observations of WASP-43 b and TrES-3b and A Study on Their Transit Timing Variations\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nZhao, Sun; Jiang-hui, Ji; Yao, Dong\n\n2018-01-01\n\nTwo photometric follow-up transit (primary eclipse) observations on WASP-43 b and four observations on TrES-3 b are performed using the Xuyi Near-Earth Object Survey Telescope.
