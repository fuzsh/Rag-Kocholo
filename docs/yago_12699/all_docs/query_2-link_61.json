        "text": "he acute processes of globalisation at the turn of the century have generated an increased interest in exploring the interactions between the so-called global cultural products or trends and their specific local manifestations. Even though cross-cultural connections are becoming more patent in filmic productions in the last decades, cinema per se has always been characterized by its hybrid, transnational, border-crossing nature. From its own inception, Spanish film production was soon tied to the Hollywood film industry for its subsistence, but other film traditions such as those in the Soviet Union, France, Germany and, in particular, Italy also determined either directly or indirectly the development of Spanish cinema. Global Genres, Local Films: The Transnational Dimension of Spanish Cinema reaches beyond the limits of the film text and analyses and contextualizes the impact of global film trends and genres on Spanish cinema in order to study how they helped articulate specific national challenges from the conflict between liberalism and tradition in the first decades of the 20th century to the management of the contemporary financial crisis. This collection provides the first comprehensive picture of the complex national and supranational forces that have shaped Spanish films, revealing the tensions and the intricate dialogue between cross-cultural aesthetic and narrative models on the one hand, and indigenous traditions on the other, as well as the political and historical contingencies these different expressions responded to.\n\nThis article looks at three cinematic representations of the Galician migrant community in the United States: the documentaries Os 15000 de Newark (2007) and Little Spain (2014), and the feature-length film Little Galicia (2015). The analysis of these films focuses especially on the influence that their chosen framing (Ellies 2012) has on the migrants' performance of their cultural identity. By assessing the performative aspect of identity (Schechner 2013), this article also examines the possibility of considering Galicianness as a transnational positioning, globally or glocally performed, rather than a geographically fixed essence.\n\nIn a century where diverse group identities surpass any kind of frontier and seem to be reflected ever more in the mirror of a clawing cultural selfhood, we are going to make an analysis of the archetype and artistic patterns of two authors of recognized prestige and, undoubtedly, excellent aesthetic practice: the Bolivian Kiro Russo (in the field of cinematography) and the acclaimed literary author Rodrigo García, of Spanish-Argentine origin. For this purpose, we will make use of a series of models in the scientific field related to the indigenous culture of Latin American (considered from a post-dramatic perspective), secondly to the culture that has been developing in the internal flow of the Spanish language and, finally, to the European post-drama of aesthetic bias (literary and cinematic). We will also delve into the technical and cultural influences of narrativity and post-drama in the artists mentioned above and we will design the conceptual theoretical maps of these productions within the Spanish language and indigenous Latin American culture. The technical fusions just mentioned and the cultural hybridizations of international stamp lead us to a summation where the intensive components of narrative character, the libertarian forms typical of the Spanish culture and the metamodern mentality of our century open the doors to an inquiry about the future of literature and cinematography through the patterns of cultural hybridization.
