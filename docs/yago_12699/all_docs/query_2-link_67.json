For 10 years, she hosted a daily television program and participated in many benefit shows.\n\nIn 1968, Amaro moved to Miami. Here, she had her own theater on Southwest 57th Avenue and she starred in My Husband's Lover, with her daughter Idania, Germán Barrios and Miguel de Grandy Jr. She also hosted the TV programs The Blanquita Amaro Show and Say It in Mime, and appeared in numerous shows staged by the Pro Arte Grateli Society.\n\nAmaro's ability to adapt to any medium allowed her to host programs at Miami radio stations, such as La Poderosa and Cadena Azúl, for many years.\n\nIn Miami in 1980, she made her last film, How Hot Miami Is! with Olga Guillot, Raymundo Hidalgo-Gato and Pedro Romàn. She also won plaudits for her performance in the play Stolen Lives, and in the comedy The Close Friends, with Griselda Nogueras and Néstor Cabell.\n\nFor 28 years, Amaro presented Cuba Sings and Dances, a variety show directed by her daughter Idania and produced by Manolo del Cañal, her son-in-law, at the Miami-Dade County Auditorium. Such popular artists as Olga Guillot, Tongolele, María Marta Serra Lima and Xiomara Alfaro appeared in that show.\n\nOne of Amaro's final public appearances was on January 27, 2007, at Miami's Artime Theater. She received an ovation from the public at a concert by soprano Alina Sánchez, who dedicated the concert to her.\n\nBlanquita Amaro died, aged 83, in Miami of a heart attack.\n\nFilmography\n\nCasada y señorita (1954)\n\nMi viudo y yo (1954)\n\nBella, la salvaje (1953)\n\nBárbara atómica (1952)\n\nLocuras, tiros y mambos (1951)\n\nA Cuban in Spain (1951) ....
