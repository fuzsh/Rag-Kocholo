        "text": "MundoAndino Home : Argentina Guide at MundoAndino\n\nMarco Denevi\n\nMarco Denevi was an Argentine award-winning author of novels and short stories, as well as a lawyer and journalist. His work is characterized by its originiality and depth, as well as a criticism of human incompetence. His first work, a mystery called Rosaura a las diez (1955), was a Kraft award winner and a bestseller. In 1964, it was translated into English as ''Rosa at Ten O'Clock. Other famous works of his include Los expedientes(1957), Ceremonia Secreta(1960), El cuarto de la noche(1962), and Falsificaciones'' (1966).\n\nIt is important to note Denevi's desire to be a playwright. He wrote many dramatic pieces but felt he was not talented enough to write for the theater in Spain.\n\nObituary on literatura.org (Spanish language)\n\nRelated websites\n\nObituary on literatura.org\n\nTranslation of short story in The Cafe Irreal\n\nDidn't find what you were looking for.\n\nNeed more information for your travel research or homework?\n\nAsk your questions at the forum about Argentine screenwriters or help others to find answers.\n\nThis article is licensed under the GNU Free Documentation License.
