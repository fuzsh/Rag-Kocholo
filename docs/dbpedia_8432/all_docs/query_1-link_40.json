        "text": "It’s that time of year again - the capelin are rolling, the whales are out in full force, and photographers around the province are kept busy capturing nature’s dazzling show.\n\nIf you’re driving around the province this summer, you might be lucky to catch another beautiful display of whales rolling by - on dry land.\n\n“Whale Family” (“Putup Ni’kmaq”) is the title of the artwork displayed on the 2023 Art Car, officially unveiled at Business & Arts NL's latest Sunrise Series event at MINI St. John’s on Kenmount Road on June 13.\n\nDesigned by Mi’kmaq artist Marcus Gosse from Stephenville, the artwork adorns a MINI Countryman and shows different families of humpback whales swimming and displaying their love of Ktaqmkuk (Newfoundland). It also features Mi’kmaq petroglyphs (including the Mi’kmaq Star), ancient appliqué patterns, double curve motifs, and Mi’kmaq hieroglyphs meaning “forever in peace.”\n\nIn his artist statement, Gosse dives deeper into the meaning of the design, noting \"Each double curve design symbolizes the life cycle of a person or living thing. The curve on the left represents youth; the centre is middle age; and the curve on the right represents becoming a senior, or, an Elder.”\n\n\"The humpback whales featured on the design display unity, friendship, support, family, and community connectedness. The whale reminds us that it is not about the destination; it’s about the journey. We are all connected on this journey. As we travel, let us support each other, and have fun doing it. Msit No’kmaq (All My Relations-We Are All Connected).” (Click here to learn more about Gosse and his design.)\n\nThe purpose of the Art Car is threefold: Not only does it display and promote Gosse's work, it also promotes MINI St. John’s and their engagement with, and support of, the local arts community. And with a display on the rear window, it also acts as a rolling advertisement for Business & Arts NL’s Explore Art NL public art app (which includes over 100 pieces of public art across Newfoundland and Labrador).\n\n“On behalf of MINI St. John’s, we’re proud to launch this year’s MINI Countryman Art Car. It’s important for us to find creative ways to connect our brand with the community and what better way to do this than through local art. It’s an honour to have original art by Marcus Gosse converted to a vehicle wrap for our MINI and we’re sure it’s going to turn heads everywhere it goes,” says Matt Kelland, Group Marketing Director of Capital Auto Group.\n\n\"We thank Amy Henderson and her team for including us and we encourage every business in our province to collaborate with Business & Arts NL to find new, creative ways to move their business forward.”\n\nLocal business Auto Trim & Signs also played an important role in the project, wrapping the design around the MINI Countryman and collaborating with Gosse to ensure it fit perfectly.\n\n\"I have had a great artistic experience working with Business & Arts NL staff and Auto Trim, creating the design for the 2023 Art Car,” Gosse says.\n\n\"The main consideration with wrapping a vehicle is placement of the decals. We had to make sure that the image size parameters of each decal were customized to fit the doors, side panels, hood and trunk. Also, both Auto Trim and I had to customize the image, and move the whales, so that the door handles and front lights were not a part of the whale. It was a technical digital challenge, but we both enjoyed solving the different challenges that were presented when we worked our way around the MINI SUV. It was one of my favourite art projects that I have ever been a part of. A big Wela’lin (thank you) to everyone.\"\n\n\"I am proud to be part of a very professional collaboration between Business & Arts NL, MINI St. John’s, and Auto Trim Signs and Designs. I am proud that the decals by Auto Trim came out so well, and were displayed exactly the way that I envisioned. In addition, I am proud to see how the MINI dealership and Business & Arts NL displayed the Art Car and my biography in the showroom. I am very thankful to everyone for their kind words and support.”"
