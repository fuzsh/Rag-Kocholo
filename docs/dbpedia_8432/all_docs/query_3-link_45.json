        "text": "The inhibition of NOM by muscle-specific NogoA might result from inducing a canonical Nogo66/NgR or Nogo66/PirB signaling pathway or from influencing the secretion of myokines. To define this molecular mechanism, we employed mouse Sol8 myoblasts and established a Doxycycline (Dox)-inducible cell line stably harboring the Sol8-vector only (Sol8-vector) and the Sol8 vector with NogoA insert (Sol8-NogoA) (Figure 1—figure supplement 1). After induction, the CM obtained from cultured myoblast cells harboring Sol8-vector was directly used to culture motoneuron cell line NSC34. After culturing, motoneurons exhibited extended neurites, while motoneurons incubated with Sol8-NogoA CM failed to exhibit neurite outgrowth (Figure 1—figure supplement 1). Importantly, NogoA was not detected in the CM cultured by Sol8-NogoA cells after Dox induction for 48 hr (Figure 1—figure supplement 1C). This line of evidence suggested that the component(s) contained in CM from cultured Sol8-NogoA play(s) a role in NOM inhibition, but not through NogoA contained in medium. Moreover, unlike neurons treated with Sol8-vector, Western blot analysis demonstrated that the signal intensity of phosphorylated Cofilin at S3 (p-Cofilin-S3), which is a hallmark of growth cone collapse in neuronal cells, as well as a marker of reduced axonal actin dynamics in ALS patients with depleted and mutated C9ORF72 (Heredia et al., 2006; Sivadasan et al., 2016), was upregulated in neurons treated with Sol8-NogoA CM (Figure 1—figure supplement 1). Collectively, this line of evidence suggested that the component(s) contained in CM from cultured Sol8-NogoA play(s) a role in NOM inhibition.\n\nWe further employed 2D electrophoresis, followed by LC MS/MS, to analyze the total proteins content in CM. Among these examined proteins, we found that the level of Pgk1 protein contained in Sol8-NogoA CM was significantly reduced compared to that in Sol8-vector CM (see Figure 1—figure supplement 2). Furthermore, the degree of p-Cofilin expression in NSC34 cells cultured in CM from Pgk1-overexpressed Sol8-NogoA cells was significantly reduced compared with that in NSC34 cells cultured in CM from Sol8-NogoA cells. Therefore, Pgk1 was chosen for further study to confirm its potential role in NOM. Additionally, we used Western blot analysis to detect the protein level of Pgk1 in the sera of transgenic SOD1 G93A mice, in which NogoA was overexpressed in muscle (Figure 1—figure supplement 3), the results of which were consistent with those reported by Bros-Facer et al. (2014). We found that the amount of Pgk1 in the sera of SOD1 G93A mice was significantly reduced compared with that in the sera of WT mice (Figure 1—figure supplement 3). Collectively, based on the above results provided in vitro and in vivo evidence, we chose Pgk1 for further study to confirm its potential role in NOM.\n\nWe added Pgk1 directly into Sol8-NogoA CM and found that p-Cofilin-S3 in NSC34 cultured with Sol8-NogoA CM plus Pgk1 was lower than that of cells cultured with Sol8-NogoA CM (Figure 1A). Importantly, supplementary Pgk1 could reduce p-Cofilin-S3 to then restore NOM of NSC34 cells, even though they had been cultured in Sol8-NogoA CM, indicating that stalled NOM of NSC34 cells cultured in Sol8-NogoA CM could be rescued upon the addition of Pgk1.\n\nTo further confirm whether Pgk1 secreted by muscle cells could enhance NOM, we added Pgk1-specific antibody to Sol8-vector CM and then cultured NSC34 cells. In response, NOM was totally inhibited and p-Cofilin-S3 was higher compared to those observed in the control groups, such as Sol8-vector CM and Sol8-vector CM plus rabbit IgG (Figure 1B). Thus, we suggest that Pgk1 is secreted by myoblasts and that it exists in muscle cell CM to play an important role in enhancing NOM.\n\nNext, to determine if Pgk1 alone is sufficient to induce NOM and neuronal differentiation, we switched to low trophic factor differentiation media (DM). Under the same condition, Pgk1 was able to extend NOM and downregulate p-Cofilin-S3 (Figure 1C). We also found that the effect of adding Pgk1 on the downregulation of p-Cofilin-S3 was dose-dependent from 0, 11, 33, 66 and 99 ng/ml (Figure 1—figure supplement 4). Moreover, when NSC34 cells were treated with Pgk1 at 33 ng/ml for 0, 8, 16, 24 and 48 hr, we found that the effect of Pgk1 on the downregulation of p-Cofilin-S3 was dose-dependent from 8 through 24 hr (Figure 1—figure supplement 4). However, we noticed that p-Cofilin-S3 was unexpectedly increased if cells were treated with Pgk1 for 48 hr. The doses of Pgk1 we examined did not cause any negative effect on cell growth and survival. However, based on the above results and to ensure that we did not seriously affect cell physiology, we treated NSC34 cells with the minimal concentration (33 ng/ml of Pgk1 for 24 hr) throughout the entire study. Interestingly, the addition Pgk1 at that concentration not only rescued the number of neurite-bearing cells, but also enhanced neurite length of NSC34 cells cultured in Sol8-NogoA CM and DM (Figure 1D–E).\n\nTo confirm the role of Pgk1 secreted from muscle cells regulates motoneuron development in vivo, we employed the CRISPR/Cas9 system to knock out Pgk1 in zebrafish embryos. We used muscle-specific α-actin promoter to drive overexpression of Cas9 in muscle cells in order to exclusively knock out the pgk1 gene. Since turbo-red fluorescent protein (tRFP) was engineered to fuse with Cas9 and P2A peptide, it served as a reporter to reflect the overexpression of Cas9 (Figure 4A). Compared to control Tg(mnx:GFP) embryos at 30 hpf (Figure 4C), the tRFP signal was observed in the muscle of pZα-Cas9-injected embryos, indicating that Cas9 was overexpressed in certain muscle cells (Figure 4D). Nevertheless, motoneurons were normally developed, which suggests that overexpression of Cas9 in muscle cells had no effect on development. However, when Tg(mnx:GFP) embryos were coinjected with pZα-Cas9 and pgk1 sgRNA, which inhibits the production of Pgk1 in muscle cells (Figure 4—figure supplement 1), defective motoneurons were observed (Figure 4E), suggesting that the reduction of Pgk1 in muscle cells is followed by impairment of NOM. In a parallel experiment, by conditional knockout of phosphoglycerate mutase 2 (pgam2) in muscle cells (Figure 4—figure supplement 1), a downstream enzyme of Pgk1 in the glycolytic pathway, we again confirmed that the glycolysis pathway in muscle did not affect NOM (Figure 4F). Collectively, these results suggested that defects in NOM result from a decrease in Pgk1 secretion in muscle cells. To prove the consistency of this result in vivo, we constructed a plasmid containing Pgk1 fused with P2A peptide and tRFP (Figure 4B). After injecting this construct into zebrafish embryos, RFP exhibited specifically in muscle cells. When these RFP-expressing cells were sorted out and examined by Western blot analysis, the results demonstrated that Pgk1 was overexpressed (Figure 4—figure supplement 1). Meanwhile, motoneuron axons exhibited ectopic growth (Figure 4G). As suggested by quantification of the axonal extension phenotype shown in Figure 4—figure supplement 2, the increase of Pgk1 in muscle cells enhances NOM.\n\nWe further identified upstream kinases, including P38/MK2 and Rac1/Pak1 (Figure 5D), along with their phosphorylated sites, using Sol8-vector CM and Sol8-NogoA CM in the absence and presence of Pgk1. Pak1 overexpression confirmed this series of signaling transduction pathway, consistent with our results using Sol8-vector CM and Sol8-NogoA CM (Figure 5E). On the other hand, when NSC34 cells were cultured in DM plus a Pak1 inhibitor, FRAX597, we found that the intracellular p-Pak1 was reduced and that the levels of p-P38-T180, p-MK2-T334, p-Limk-S323 and p-Cofilin-S3 were also reduced (Figure 5—figure supplement 2), suggesting that P38, MK2, Limk, and Cofilin are all downstream effectors of Pak1. In sum, ePgk1 triggers a reduction in p-Cofilin-S3, in turn promoting NOM through decreasing a novel p-Pak1-T423/p-P38-T180/p-MK2-T334/p-Limk1-S323 axis via reducing Rac1-GTP activity in neuronal cells.\n\nTo confirm whether Pgk1 involved regulating pathway is independent of activation of NgR receptor by NogoA. First, we determined whether the p-Cofilin expression is different between GST-Nogo66 addition and GST-Nogo66 plus Pgk1 addition into NSC34 cultured in DM. Compared to the control group in which GST was added in DM, NSC34 cells cultured in GST-Nogo66-added DM exhibited the increase of p-ROCK2-Y256 and p-EGFR-Y1173 expression and the decrease of p-Akt-S473 (Figure 5—figure supplement 3A), suggesting GST-Nogo66 addition did activate NgR response pathway. Interestingly, the increased p-ROCK2-Y256 and p-EGFR-Y1173 and the decreased p-Akt-S473 remained unchanged in NSC34 cultured in GST-Nogo66 with Pgk1 addition (Figure 5—figure supplement 3A), suggesting the addition of Pgk1 did not affect Nogo66/NgR pathway. However, compared to GST-Nogo66-added cells, the GST-Nogo66 plus Pgk1-treated NSC34 cells exhibited the reduction of p-Cpfilin-S3 expression through decreasing p-Limk-S323 but not through p-Limk-T508 (Figure 5—figure supplement 3B), suggesting the reduced expression of p-Cofilin is due to the presence of Pgk1 through pathway other than Nogo66/NgR interaction.\n\nSecond, we determined whether the p-Cofilin-S3 expression is still reduced in NSC34 by addition of Pgk1 into NSC34 cultured in DM when NgR receptor is blocked by NAP2, a NgR receptor antagonist peptide. The results showed that addition of NAP2 in culture led to the reduction of ROCK2 expression in NSC34 cells, which was consistent with the result reported by Sun et al. (2016) indicating that NAP2 is able to block NgR receptor (Figure 5—figure supplement 3C). However, unlike the increased ROCK2 in NSC34 cultured in NAP2 addition, the ROCK2 expression remained unchanged in NSC34 cells cultured in NAP2 plus Pgk1 addition (Figure 5—figure supplement 3C). On contrast, the expression of p-Pak1-T423/p-P38-T180/p-MK2-T334/p-Limk1-S323/p-Cofiln-S3 axis was reduced (Figure 5—figure supplement 3D).\n\nTaken together, we suggest that the reduction of p-Cofilin mediated by ePgk1 is not through the Nogo66/NgR interaction in neuronal cells since ePgk1 addition can be still functional to reduce p-Pak1/p-P38/p-MK2/p-Limk1-S323/p-Cofiln axis without the presence of NgR receptor of neuronal cells. In sum, ePgk1 triggers a reduction in p-Cofilin-S3, in turn promoting NOM through decreasing a novel p-Pak1-T423/p-P38-T180/p-MK2-T334/p-Limk1-S323 axis via reducing Rac1-GTP activity in neuronal cells. And, the molecular pathway ePgk1 involved in NOM is independent of the Nogo66/NgR interaction.\n\nMuscle-specific NogoA-overexpression has been shown to disassemble NMJ in animal models, exhibiting muscle atrophy and reduced movement (Jokic et al., 2006; Lin et al., 2019). Noting the colocalization of the presynaptic markers synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2A (SV2) and Neurofilament-H (NF-H), as well as the postsynaptic marker acetylcholine receptor labeled with α-Bungarotoxin (α-BTX), we asked if ePgk1 could re-establish NMJ integrity after its disassembly by NogoA overexpression. While we observed denervation at NMJ after Rtn4al/NogoA induction in adult zebrafish (Figure 6—figure supplement 1), as evidenced by reduced colocalization of presynaptic and postsynaptic markers, this defect saw much improvement by addition of Pgk1, but not GFP control, through intramuscular injection (Figure 6A–G), suggesting ePgk1 supports NMJ integrity. Although adult zebrafish muscle injected with Pgk1 did exhibit delayed NMJ denervation, it could still retain its normal biological activity for two weeks after a single shot (Figure 6—figure supplement 2).\n\nWe then used an ALS cell line and mouse model to determine any beneficial effects of Pgk1 supplementation. We first differentiated motor neurons derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) harboring human SOD1 mutant (G85R) (Figure 6—figure supplement 3) and then added Pgk1. Pgk1 addition reduced p-Cofilin through decreasing p-Limk1-S323 (Figure 6—figure supplement 4), as noted above, indicating that ePgk1 induces the same signal transduction pathway as that determined from the mouse cell line and human motor neurons.\n\nNext, to continue exploring this question in vivo, we performed intramuscular injection of Pgk1 into the gastrocnemius muscle of the right hind leg of 60-day-old transgenic SOD1 G93A mice, followed by another injection every 15 days until mice were 120 days old. We quantified the proportion of innervated NMJ in the gastrocnemius muscle of the right hind leg of mice. Compared to the control group, the proportion of innervated NMJ of WT mice injected with PBS (WT/PBS), which was normalized as 100%, the proportion of innervated NMJ of SOD1 G93A/PBS was 13 ± 0.02%, indicating that the signal of motor neuron axon and axon terminal (NF-H/SV2) was significantly reduced. However, the proportion of innervated NMJ of SOD1 G93A mice injected with Pgk1 (SOD1 G93A/Pgk1) was 57 ± 0.08%, suggesting that supplementary addition of Pgk1 could rescue NMJ denervation (Figure 6H–N).\n\nFurthermore, we examined the muscle contraction ability of hind leg in 130-day-old mice. In the WT/PBS group, the muscle contraction of both hind legs was normal, exhibiting strong movement. In contrast, in the SOD1 G93A/PBS group, muscle contraction of both hind legs was extremely poor (Figure 6—videos 1–3; Figure 6—figure supplement 5). Nevertheless, in the SOD1 G93A/Pgk1 group, muscle contraction of the left hind leg was as poor as that of the SOD1 G93A/PBS mice. Interestingly, muscle contraction of Pgk1-injected right hind leg remained functional, exhibiting a superior movement (Figure 6—videos 4–6). Exercise capability value of the SOD1 G93A/Pgk1 group was significantly higher than that of the SOD1 G93A/PBS group (Figure 6—figure supplement 5). Additionally, we found that the proportion of innervated NMJ in the gastrocnemius muscle of the Pgk1-injected right hind leg was increased compared to that of the left hind leg. Taken together, it is suggested that the Pgk1-injected right hind leg of SOD1 G93A mice could maintain some normal motor neurons to innervate muscle contraction.\n\nOur collective findings reveal a novel target against the inhibition of neuron maturation and NOM by overexpression of NogoA through a Nogo66-independent pathway. NogoA has been known to inhibit neuron regeneration via Nogo66 and NiGΔ20 domains. To date, only Nogo66-interacting receptors were found. In this study, we revealed that overexpression of NogoA in muscle inhibits NOM through decreasing Pgk1 secretion (ePgk1), but without inducing the canonical Nogo66/NgR pathway. Here, we demonstrated that the addition of Pgk1 to media could promote NOM by reducing p-Cofilin-S3 through decreasing the phosphorylation of the Pak1/P38/MK2/Limk1-S323 signaling pathway via decreased Rac1-GTP (Figure 7). Whether NogoA also affects the secretion of other trophic factors to inhibit neuronal maturation and maintain NMJ integrity remains a topic for further study.\n\nFigure 7\n\nTo address the reduced secretion of Pgk1 from muscle cells by NogoA, as well as inhibition of the neuronal intracellular Rac1 pathway by ePgk1, we turn to the literature. First, Lay et al. (2000) found that Pgk1 secreted from tumor cells exhibits disulfide reductase activity, resulting in the release of angiostatin through reducing the disulfide bond of plasmin. Wang et al. (2007) also reported that CXCR4 could positively regulate the expression and secretion of Pgk1 in cancer cells. Overexpression of Pgk1 causes an increase of angiostatin, which, in turn, reduces the secretion of vascular endothelial growth factor and interleukin-8. At metastatic sites, a high level of CXCL12 reduces Pgk1 expression, resulting in reduced angiostatin function, which activates angiogenesis. Interestingly, when Rtn4a/NogoA is overexpressed in the somite boundary cells of zebrafish embryos, Lin et al. (2017) found that the expression of Cxcr4a is decreased. Aase et al. (2007) and Yi et al. (2011) reported that angiomotin (Amot), a cell membrane receptor of angiostatin, negatively controls Rac1 activity in endothelial and epithelial cells. Based on this convincing evidence from the literature, we speculate that NogoA/Rtn4a-overexpressed muscle cells may cause a decrease of Cxcr4a expression, resulting in reducing of Pgk1 secretion. The reduced ePgk1 may then cause a decrease in extracellular proteins, such as angiostatin, which, in turn, would increase the activity of Rac1, finally causing a physiological microenvironment for motor neurons that would not favor neurite outgrowth.\n\nBoyd et al. (2017) reported the intracellular, bioenergetic function of Pgk1 in neuron cells, while we described the effect of Pgk1 secreted from muscle cells on NOM through a bioenergetic- and Nogo66-independent pathway. As Boyd et al. (2017) reported, when Pgk1 is insufficiently expressed, its participation in the glycolysis pathway is not effective, resulting in a reduced production of ATP, which, in turn, causes impaired neurological function. Thus, they concluded that Pgk1 is expressed in motor neurons, but also has a bioenergetics function. However, since the effect of pgk1-MO and pgk1 mRNA was not studied in the context of expression in muscle tissue, it remains unclear if the motor neuron phenotype results from the direct effect of Pgk1 within neurons or from indirect effect by defective function of surrounding cells or tissues. Therefore, in this study, we employed a muscle-specific promoter combined with the CRISPR/Cas9 system to specifically knock down Pgk1 in muscle cells, and we found that NOM was inhibited in adjacent nerve cells. Interestingly, when we used the muscle promoter to specifically overexpress Pgk1 in muscle cells, the failed NOM induced by NogoA/Rtn4al overexpression in muscle cells could be rescued. Additionally, we demonstrated that addition of Pgk1 in CM and DM had no impact on the efficiency of intracellular glycolysis in cultured NSC34 cells. In fact, the addition of Pgk1 enables the enhancement of NOM in NSC34 cells, even under reduced glycolytic condition. Additionally, when Pgk1 was ubiquitously knocked down, as Boyd et al. (2017) reported, the total amount of Pgk1 was reduced, including the small amount of secreted Pgk1 from muscle cells, resulting in a phenotype similar to what we observed in this study. Based on this line of evidence, we demonstrated that ePgk1 enhances NOM in a manner functionally independent of its intracellular, canonical role as a supplier of energy, as described by Boyd et al. (2017).\n\nThus, we have identified a Pgk1/p-Limk1-S323/p-Cofilin-S3 axis in which secreted Pgk1 emerges as an extracellular trigger in the NOM. As illustrated in Figure 6, the following cascade of events takes place. ePgk1 decreases p-Limk1 at S323, which, in turn, results in the decrease of p-Cofilin-S3 and, finally, the rescue of NOM inhibited by culturing in Sol8-NogoA CM. In the process of investigating this novel signaling pathway, we found that overexpression of NogoA in muscle cells resulted in altering the amount of some secreted proteins in muscle cells. For example, the amount of secreted Pgk1 is reduced, which, in turn, inhibits the NOM. Meanwhile, we know that NogoA, as marker of morbidity, overexpresses in the muscle cells of ALS patients at an early stage (Pradat et al., 2007). Because NogoA does not contain a signal peptide (Chen et al., 2000), it is barely detectable in patients’ blood (Harel et al., 2009). Therefore, we have detected a property of Pgk1 in serum that may serve as an indicator of incipient ALS. More recently, Meininger et al. (2017) reported that treatment with Ozanezumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody against NogoA, showed no significant improvement for ALS patients in phase two trial, suggesting that NogoA may not be an effective therapeutic target. Moving away from this target, we proposed in the present study that secreted protein from NogoA-overexpressed muscle cells is a highly promising alternative therapeutic target. More specifically, we showed that the reduced amount of secreted Pgk1 causes neurodegeneration and that the restorative effect of Pgk1 on NOM does not arise through the Nogo66/NgR/ROCK/Limk1-T508 pathway. Although intercellular Nogo66/NgR interaction is blocked by NogoA antibody, it may not change the fact that NogoA is still overexpressed within muscle cells, resulting in the decrease of Pgk1 secretion. Meanwhile, Pgk1 deficiency is inherited as an X-linked recessive genetic trait. It is caused by mutated Pgk1, the folding and stability of which are altered (Chiarelli et al., 2012; Pey et al., 2014). Pgk1 deficiency is accompanied by suffering from muscle lesions, motor neuron defect, neurological dysfunction and myopathy (Valentini et al., 2013; Matsumaru et al., 2017), as well as susceptibility to Parkinson’s disease (Sakaue et al., 2017). Therefore, it can be reasonably speculated that the abnormal secretion of Pgk1 may affect neuronal development, which supports our finding that Pgk1 secreted from muscle cells plays a novel role in NOM and neuronal development."
