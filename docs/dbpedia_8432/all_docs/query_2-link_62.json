        "text": "To make friends you need to: develop exclusivity. Exclusivity means memories, experiences, and knowledge you uniquely share with one other person. If you joined a soccer league you can generate exclusivity by saying: I love playing soccer together. Would you be open to getting a bite together after our next game? If you started a new job, exclusivity looks like: want to have lunch together today? If you’re deepening an existing connection, exclusivity looks like: can I share something with you that I’ve been struggling with? It’s great to put ourselves in situations where we can meet new people. But it’s difficult to feel like friends if you only ever see each other in group contexts. EXCLUSIVITY turns a new person into a friend. It’s great to connect one-on-one but we can get even closer if we share knowledge with one another (vulnerability) that others don’t know. 👇🏽What are some ways you have generated exclusivity? #Connection #Belonging\n\nNoah Darvich - Scout Report 🔸 Nationality: Germany 🔸 Birth Date: 25/09/2006 🔸 Club: Barcelona (Spain) 🔸 Position: AM / CM 🔸 Strong foot: Left 🔸 Height: 1.86 cm / 72 kg 🔹 Potential: A (Player for top club) 🔹 Summary: Noah Darvich is an emerging talent hailing from Germany, born in 2006, with a towering height of 184 cm.
