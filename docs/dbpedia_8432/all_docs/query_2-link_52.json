KickStart for Kids is a non-for-profit charity that the Year 10 Kennion Home Group is involved with every week. KickStart for Kids provides 60,000 breakfasts and 10,000 lunches a week to underprivileged children in South Australia.\n\nEvery Tuesday, three students from Year 10 Kennion travel to Ngutu College to provide a healthy and substantial breakfast for children that are less fortunate, as breakfast is the most important meal of the day. We make a nutritious and balanced breakfast of buttered toast and condiments for the children when they arrive at school in the morning. We also cut up fruit that is used for a morning snack.\n\nAfterwards, we have some free time to play with the younger children from the ELC where we play cars and build blocks. The children love it as it builds a connection with new people and helps enhance their confidence and problem-solving skills.\n\nKickStart for Kids is rewarding not only for the children, but for our Year 10 Kennion students. Each week we look forward to getting to know the children and giving them a healthy breakfast to start their day. KickStart for Kids brings a fulfilling and fun program for us as a Home Group as well as the children. Kennion Home Group is so grateful to have this opportunity to give back to the community.\n\nBy Evie Gosse\n\nYear 10 Kennion\n\nBack to top\n\nELC – News from Learning Community 1\n\nOur Community Garden\n\nThis term, Learning Community 1 children have been exploring and researching the rich and dynamic environment of our ELC Community Garden. Previously, access to our ELC Community Garden was quite limited due to our new build, so we are thrilled to be able to use it once again to spark the children’s curiosities.\n\nEach morning, Bell Yett and Stonyfell children have ventured down to the garden to engage in exciting, hands-on research. They first began researching by using their observation skills to notice the bare, dry garden beds. In small groups, the children explored further by inspecting the soil, crumbling it in their hands, and feeling its cool temperature. To encourage the children’s awareness of seasonal planting, we brainstormed types of vegetables that grow in autumn and winter. We also used the internet and picture books to gain further insights into what we could plant. It was wonderful to hear the children’s existing knowledge of vegetables, with many suggesting we should plant carrots, broccoli and snow peas. The children also enjoyed representing their ideas and plans for the garden with their graphic language, using mark-making materials on brown paper.\n\nAfter helping to replenish the garden beds with new soil, ‘turning it over’ and practising digging holes with spades, the children were delighted to finally plant a selection of seedlings. They worked carefully and respectfully, taking turns to dig, plant, and pat down the soil with gentle hands. After, they shared the responsibility of watering the garden and enjoyed discussing the names of the many vegetables they planted.\n\nThe children have already begun making nuanced connections between the planted seedlings and the vegetables they observe in each other’s lunchboxes or during afternoon tea. We will continue to nurture the children’s momentum of curiosity and begin researching concepts of ‘garden to plate’, while learning and enjoying the responsibility of caring for living things.\n\nDot, Kathy, Nell and Annabelle\n\nLearning Community 1 Teachers\n\nBack to top\n\nCREATE 24 – This Monday 27 May\n\nThe Stage 2 SACE and IB Dance students are proudly presenting their own choreographic works on Monday 27 May at 7pm in the Jeffreys Linn Arts Centre. Exploring many diverse and complex themes, these young choreographers look forward to sharing their hard work with our community. All welcome – no tickets required.\n\nBack to top\n\nFUSION 2024: A Showcase of Musical Theatre\n\nWe hope you are all getting PUMPED for ‘FUSION 2024: A Showcase of Musical Theatre’!\n\nThis year a massive cast of 64 students, under the guidance of Mrs Kate Burnett and Ms Joni Combe, will be presenting songs from four iconic musicals: ‘Cats,’ ‘Legally Blonde,’ ‘Hamilton’ and ‘Chicago’.

It is open to all Junior and Middle School students who learn the piano at School or outside of School. Parents are welcome to attend, and the time of each student’s performance will be communicated to families.\n\nGirls will have the opportunity to perform a piece to a panel of judges, who will critique their performance based on accuracy, technique and musicality for their specific music level. This is a great opportunity for girls to perform in a supportive environment and receive some valuable feedback. Please encourage your daughter to prepare well for their performance to enable them to feel confident on the day.\n\nGirls are asked to play one piece that best displays their musicality and technical ability at their own musical level. There will be no minimum or maximum time limit. While the Eisteddfod provides our top piano players with a platform to perform, the aim is to give performers of all levels the opportunity to participate.\n\nA Piano Recital will be held at 6pm on Thursday 20 June. Students will be chosen from the Eisteddfod performers who show confidence and a high level of musicianship. Selected recital students will be notified by email.\n\nIf your daughter would like to be involved, please fill out and return the Piano Eisteddfod consent form by Monday 3 June. Girls can collect the form from the Arts Office or you can download it via the link below. Students will later receive their time slot to perform in the Eisteddfod.\n\nDownload the Piano Eisteddfod Consent Form\n\nSally Rounsevell\n\nDirector of Music\n\nBack to top\n\nOut of the Blue Journal 2024\n\nThe Out of the Blue Arts Journal is a celebration of our School community’s talented artists, produced entirely by the student committee!

Or you can email a digital copy to outoftheblue@stpetersgirls.sa.edu.au . For all submissions, please fill out and attach this submission form. Entries close Friday 16 August.\n\nEvery year, Out of the Blue opens the opportunity to design the journal front cover. Many of the past designs have featured line drawings, but we hope to see some other creative ideas as well. The only requirement is that it must fit within the square format of the Journal. For inspiration, Editions 1-4 of the Journal are currently on display in the Middle School Library – feel free to look! Cover designs can be submitted in the same way as general submissions by Monday 24 June.\n\nAs this year marks the fifth anniversary of the Out of the Blue Arts Journal, which coincides with the School’s 130th anniversary, we hope to see submissions to make this special edition a standout!
