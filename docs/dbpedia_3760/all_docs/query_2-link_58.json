        "text": "Ascent Projects: Engineers & Contractors\n\nA local contracting and engineering company operating solely in Seychelles, Ascent Projects is interested in partnering with you to make your vision a reality. Whether it is a dream family home, civil works or a hotel backed by private investors, Ascent Projects is qualified in all sectors and is ready to strive to give you a complete project of impeccably high quality with an undeniably on-trend aesthetic appeal.\n\nOur aim is to become the best in construction when it comes to contracting and engineering. For us, that means winning the trust of our customers through our timely completion of projects, which also showcases the good quality of our materials, as well as staying within our clientsâ budget. A happy customer means more customers for us.\n\nAscent Projects works with architects both locally and abroad, who have their fingers on the pulse of what is current in the world of construction and interior design. This gives the company an innovative edge and keeps it relevant in a highly competitive industry.\n\nThis complementary way of working, ensures that Ascent Projects has the best of both worlds. Our local architects have the technical know-how when it comes to the requirements for building in the country. Our architects abroad have more experience when it comes to large construction projects and they also have more exposure to emerging trends in construction, which our clients, especially our international clients, desire for their builds in Seychelles.\n\nFor clients abroad wishing to build in Seychelles, having Ascent Projects on board for your build can considerably ease the journey to completion. Our expert team will handle all paperwork as well as hassles which may arise when it comes to building in Seychelles.\n\nOur Workforce:\n\nMost of our workers are so happy working for us, that they see no reason for leaving. We have excellent staff retention, as over 80% of our workers have remained with the company for over five years.\n\nAscent Projects is made up of a dynamic group of peoples of different nationalities, including Seychellois, working successfully and closely together towards the companyâs aims. Our construction workers come from all parts of India, as well as Bangladesh, Nepal and Sri Lanka, and despite their differing views on religion and culture, they make things work every day.\n\nOur foreign or expatriate workers benefit from freedoms that many in their position in the same field would wish to have. Most importantly, we donât treat them any differently from our Seychellois staff. They have freedom of movement and freedom of choice, there is no restriction in the kinds of food they can eat and they are free to observe their religious celebrations and holidays.\n\nAscent Projects presently has 15 supervision staff, 10 administration and supporting staff, 3 management staff, 5 senior management staff, close to 250 construction workers and rising, inclusive of drivers.\n\nMachinery:\n\nComplementing our workforce is our fleet of machines which is inclusive of trucks, stone crushers and excavators, to name a few. The company also recently revamped its timber workshop situated at the Providence Industrial Estate on Seychellesâ main island MahÃ©, with the latest in quality machinery from Italy.\n\nThe company also strongly believes in supporting other contractors to grow and develop. Ascent Projects regularly partners with other contractors who may possess tools, skills and machines which we may not have presently. Both parties benefit from the arrangement - the other contractors benefit from the exposure to bidding for projects and Ascent Projects benefits from their skill, know-how and machines.\n\nAscent Projects believes in growth and increasing our number of machines allows us to look further towards new opportunities, especially towards bigger civil works. As a company, we like to challenge ourselves to grow.\n\nOur Achievements:\n\nBeing willing to take on challenges, has resulted in Ascent Projects completing some noteworthy projects.
