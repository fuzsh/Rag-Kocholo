        "text": "Group Captain Ajit Krishnan, Gaganyaan astronaut-designate, presents his research “on a study comparing two different viewing methods for manually de-orbiting spacecraft using VR simulation”, supervised by Professor Pradipta Biswas at DM IISc Early this year, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the 4 Astronaut designates to be on board the maiden human spaceflight mission “Gaganyaan” – of the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) to demonstrate India’s human space flight capability. The Gaganyaan Mission is India's first human space flight programme that aims to send a team of astronauts into space, to an orbit of 400 km for three days, & bring them safely back to Earth. Captain Ajit Krishnan from the Indian Air Force is among the four Astronaut designates for India's Gaganyaan Mission. Born in Chennai on April 19, 1982, he is an alumnus of NDA, Defence Services Staff College, Wellington, India, and a recipient of President’s Gold Medal and Sword of Honour at Air Force Academy. He was commissioned into the fighter stream on July 21, 2003 & is a flying instructor and a test pilot with ~2900 hours of flying experience. Captain Krishnan is currently pursuing his master’s by research at the Department of Design and Manufacturing (formerly CPDM), Indian Institute of Science (IISc) on “the study using virtual reality simulations to compare two different viewing methods for manually de-orbiting spacecraft” under the supervision of Prof. Pradipta Biswas, Associate Professor, DM and Robert Bosch Centre for Cyber-Physical Systems @ IISc, Bengaluru. This work is also done in collaboration with a team from Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO). Captain Krishnan recently presented his research work at a colloquim and will soon defend his thesis. As India gears up for its first human spaceflight mission, the four selected astronauts are undergoing extensive training at the Astronaut Training Facility in Bengaluru, which includes Classroom Training, Physical Fitness Training, Simulator Training and Flight Suit Training. Returning from space, atmospheric re-entry has always been regarded as the most challenging aspect of human spaceflight. Although all crewed spacecraft are equipped with automated systems to ensure safe de-orbiting and re-entry, they also feature manual overrides for emergencies. Captain Krishnan’s research examined the “bottom view” method employed in Russian and Chinese spacecraft against the “front view” favoured by NASA. In the bottom view, astronauts can see the entire circular Earth horizon, while the front view provides an aircraft-like windshield perspective with a partial horizon arc. This work was recently presented at IEEE SPACE 2024 (SPace, Aerospace and defenCE Conference) Read more at: https://lnkd.in/gSpg2rfH Links to media coverage: 1. https://lnkd.in/gUFW84Hq 2. https://lnkd.in/gsytf5NM\n\n40th DM Distinguished Lecture on Advanced Design and Manufacturing Title: L‘see’A: How to visualize sustainability in engineering design? Speaker: Prof. Devarajan Ramanujan, Associate Professor at the Department of Mechanical and Production Engineering, Aarhus University, Aarhus University, Denmark Date: 16th July 2024 (Tuesday) Time: 3:30 PM Venue: MMCR, Dept. of Design and Manufacturing (erstwhile Centre for Product Design and Manufacturing, Indian Institute of Science), Indian Institute of Science (IISc) Abstract : Life cycle assessments (LCAs) are widely used for identifying opportunities for redesigning engineered parts from a sustainability perspective. However, data representations and results presentations in LCAs remain disconnected from those used for engineering design. This disconnect makes it challenging to apply results from LCAs towards design decision-making. To be better integrated into design processes, LCA results should guide design synthesis and exploration, while supporting human sensemaking processes. This talk presents LCA results visualization and interpretation approaches based on information visualization and scientific visualization that project sustainability-information back to design. Results from real-world case studies on mapping and visualizing LCA results to computer aided design models will be discussed along with existing opportunities and challenges for translating the presented methods into industrial practice. Speaker Bio: Devarajan (Dev) Ramanujan is an Associate Professor at the Department of Mechanical and Production Engineering, Aarhus University, Denmark. He also leads the Design and Manufacturing Section. He joined Aarhus University in 2017. He was a postdoctoral researcher at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, USA from 2016-2017 and earned his Ph.D. in 2015 from the School of Mechanical Engineering at Purdue University, USA. He directs the Life Cycle Design and Manufacturing Research Group, which focuses on creating computer-aided methods and tools for integrating sustainability and circularity assessments into design and manufacturing. The group's research is grounded in real-world practice and is conducted in close collaboration with manufacturing industries, standards agencies, and industrial innovation clusters. His research and teaching have been recognized through awards from the ASME (The American Society of Mechanical Engineers), Association of EcoDesign Societies in Japan, Aarhus University, and Purdue University.\n\nResearch and Design Challenge Award, 23rd annual ACM Interaction Design and Children (IDC) Conference, 17-20 June 2024, Delft University of Technology, Netherlands. Sreeja Sri Ramoji, research scholar at DM, IISc was part of the team that won second place for the design concept presented at the IDC Research and Design Challenge competition organized during the 23rd annual ACM Interaction Design and Children (IDC) conference, 17-20 June 2024, Delft University of Technology, Netherlands. Submission title: From Wrist to Heart: The Impact of Interactive Wristbands for Inclusive Learning Environments Link to the paper: https://lnkd.in/gc3NpssJ The IDC 2024 Research and Design Challenge invited children, scholars, designers, and practitioners to submit design concepts under the theme “Inclusive Technologies”. IDC is the premier international conference for researchers, educators and practitioners to share the latest research, methodologies and technologies in the areas of child-centered design, learning, and interaction. IDC 2024 was hosted by the Delft University of Technology, University of Twente, University of Amsterdam, and Eindhoven University of Technology, all based in the Netherlands. The ACM, Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) is the world's largest educational and scientific computing society that delivers resources that advance computing as a science and a profession. ACM provides the computing field's premier Digital Library and serves its members and the computing profession with leading-edge publications, conferences, and career resources.\n\nReviewers' Favourite Award at Design 2024 Naz Yaldiz. and Prof. Amaresh Chakrabarti won the 'Reviewers' Favourite Award' for the paper \"Assessment of empowerment via inclusion of people in product lifecycle processes (https://lnkd.in/gbeSPh9r)\" at DESIGN 2024 - the 18th International Design Conference held from 20-23 May 2024 at Cavtat, Dubrovnik, Croatia (https://lnkd.in/dfG_8QB) The reviewers' favourite award is given to the top 10% of papers based on reviewers' scores.
