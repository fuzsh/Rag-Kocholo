        "text": "A new Bill for the registration of Muslim marriages and divorces was introduced in the Assam assembly, considered as a step towards implementing a Uniform Civil Code.\n\nThe assembly witnessed massive uproar when the Compulsory Registration of Muslim Marriages and Divorce bill was being introduced. The Opposition criticised the Bill as a hurried measure that was against the Muslims.\n\nAssam Compulsory Registration of Muslim Marriage and Divorces Act, 2024, will replace the Muslim Marriages and Divorces Act of 1935. The 1935 law was already repealed by an ordinance in March that allowed child marriages and was silent on polygamy.\n\nRegistration of marriages and divorces among Muslims will be made compulsory under the new law, which was earlier done by mullahs and qazis. Registrations were entirely voluntary earlier.\n\n\"The new law will also not allow registration of a marriage if the bride and the groom have not reached the legal age of 18 and 21. This will help curb child marriages in the state,\" Chief Minister Himanta Sarma said.\n\nThe Bill tabled yesterday lists “prevention of child marriages”, “prevention of marriages without the consent of the parties” and “checking polygamy” as the primary objectives.\n\nThe objectives also include \"enabling women to claim their rights to live in the matrimonial home, maintenance, and other entitlements,\" as well as \"empowering widows to assert their inheritance rights and access the benefits and privileges they are entitled to after the death of their husband.\" Additionally, the law aims to deter \"men from deserting women after marriage\" and to \"strengthen the institution of marriage.\"\n\nOnce the law is enacted, marriages will need to meet six specific conditions before they can be registered. These include the couple having lived together as husband and wife since their marriage ceremony, residing within the district of the marriage and divorce registrar for at least 30 days before the registration date, and meeting the minimum age requirement—18 years for women and 21 years for men — at the time of the marriage.\n\nThe marriage must have been entered into with the free consent of both parties, and neither spouse can be incompetent, insane, or of unsound mind at the time of the ceremony. Furthermore, both individuals must be free from any legal impediments, meaning they should not be within the prohibited degree of relationship as defined by Shariat or Muslim law. The marriage application must also include documents verifying the couple's identity, age, and place of residence.\n\nWhile there will be no restriction on the customs and rituals followed by Muslims during the wedding ceremonies, only the registration bit will change and it will have to get a legal assent.\n\nThere have been 95 such Muslim registrars across the state. This position has been done away with in the new Bill, and the registration under the new Bill is to be carried out by the Marriage and Divorce Registrar of the district concerned."
