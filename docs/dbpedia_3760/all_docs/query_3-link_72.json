        "text": "I have heard that Lord Rama was born at afternoon 12 O'clock (In day time) in Treta yuga. Same as in Dwapara yuga, Lord Krishna was born at mid night 12 O'clock (In night time). Both Lord Rama and Lord Krishna were avatara of Lord Vishnu, then what is the need of choosing specific time? They can born anytime, time never bond to gods as per my understanding.\n\nWhy did Lord Rama and Lord Krishna choose to born at 12 O'clock in day and in night time respectively?\n\nWhat is significance of birth timing in both case?\n\nWe commonly perform Krishnastami pooja and Ramnavami pooja at same time which I mentioned. I have heard from my elders, those people, who are in \"Bhojan or external desires\" were unaware of Lord Rama's birth and those people, who are in \"Kama bhog\" were unaware of Lord Krishna's birth."
