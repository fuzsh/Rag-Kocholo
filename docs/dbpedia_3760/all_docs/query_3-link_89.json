        "text": "India is becoming the world's fastest-growing startup ecosystem with 114 Unicorn Startups, as of March 2024. In today's world, unicorn startups are not as uncommon as before; however, building a unicorn startup is not easy. It takes a lot of hard work, commitment, and perseverance throughout the startup's journey to climb the ladder of unicorns, and the ones that have bagged the title of unicorns are discussed in this article.\n\nUnicorn Startup consists of two words, \"Unicorn\" and \"Startup\". Unicorn is a business term used to define a startup with a valuation of over $1 billion. The term was coined by a venture capitalist and a seed investor, Aileen Lee. On the other hand, Startups are privately owned companies typically at the early stages of their development.\n\nBeing hopeful and supportive of the unicorn culture of India, the Union Minister of State for Entrepreneurship, Skill Development, Electronics & Technology Rajeev Chandrasekhar said that India will see a 10X increase in its unicorn count, in the next 2-3 years, which will reach more than 1,000. The Indian government also mentioned that it expects the next wave of startup founders to come from the Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities of India.\n\nThe Indian startups have reportedly raised around $42+ billion in funding across 1,584 deals in 2021. The startup ecosystem of India, where 90,000+ new startups have been established since 2016, across 56+ different sectors in the country, has also managed to create over 4.5 lakh job opportunities in the country. This has even got a special mention from President Ram Nath Kovind in his Presidential address on 31 January 2022, where he emphasized the new opportunities that the startups of India are ushering in.\n\nA Celebration for 100 Indian Unicorns\n\nWith Neobank Open achieving unicorn status, India has been a country of 100+ unicorns. The first unicorn was seen in India in 2011, and now, after a decade, India has crossed the mark of 100 unicorns. The combined valuation of India's unicorns, which have raised a total of around $99 billion in funding, is more than $347 billion as of August 2023. The boasting of 100 unicorns is not a regular affair, and this is why the startup ecosystem has been tossing in joy and swelling with pride for quite some time now. In the meanwhile, many distinguished founders also voiced their thrill and joy for such an achievement.\n\n“Crossing the 100th unicorn milestone is a proud moment for the country and the entire startup ecosystem. This is just the beginning of a long journey,” said Sujeet Kumar, the cofounder of B2B marketplace unicorn Udaan.\n\nVamsi Krishna of Vedantu also relished the mood that the startup ecosystem is in, and said, “The rise of India as a global superpower is inevitable and entrepreneurs will be the ones driving it. 100 unicorns are just a start. We will soon become the startup capital of the world.”\n\nDivya Gokunath, the cofounder of Byju's and the wife of Byju Raveendran also said, “We became India’s 16th unicorn, just seven years after we started operations. The valuation did not matter to us, but the milestone did because it was one of the few at that time which put India on the map. Today, for the first 100 Indian companies which made it, it’s a mark that we are on a mission to create something of value and something from India for the world.”\n\nThe faster growth of companies and the sprouting of more unicorns is what India wishes for now. This means that the companies should definitely have to be more serious, and resourceful, and work with an integrated team of specialists to reach the unicorn milestone and beyond. It also means that the Indian startups should forget racial, gender and caste divides, and work with all of their strength, and resources. Here, what is striking among the present unicorns is the apparent gender divide. Yes, only 15% of the present unicorns of India have at least one female founder, while the remaining companies have no female as their founders. This certainly needs to improve to give the upcoming companies a fresh gear of growth. Though the situation is improving, for around 79% of the Indian unicorns with female founders were incorporated after 2011, it still needs to be given considerable thought and a whole lot of action.\n\nHere we have listed 114 Indian Unicorn Startups, which is the total number of unicorns in India at present in 2024! Don't miss out on the regular updates in this list by bookmarking the article.\n\nThe following table is sorted by the year startups are turned into a unicorn (Latest to oldest).\n\nStartup Name Industry Founding Year Unicorn Entry Year Profit/Loss FY22 Current Valuation Acquisitions Status Rapido Transportation, Mobility Tech 2015 2024 -$52.4 Million $1 Billion 2 Private Porter Logistics 2014 2024 -$2.10 Million $1 Billion -
