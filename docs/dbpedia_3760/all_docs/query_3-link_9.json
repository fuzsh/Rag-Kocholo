        "text": "$47M without ever having a single client on a contract. How? My clients never had to resign after one sale was over, And trust me, there were plenty one-and-done deals. But I also had clients who started working with me in my 20s, who I had to tell I was leaving! 🥹 So… how?? Make it easy Build trust Be a challenger 1. Make it easy. My clients were the GMs of car dealerships. High D personalities typically, More on their plate than they knew how to handle. I learned how to take the whole process over for them. All they had to do was say, “Yes.” Approve the final draft, And pay me. 2. Build trust They knew that if they did those things, I would execute. Their campaign would launch without a hitch. *That part doesn’t exist - there were hitches* But that is where I built trust. I came to them openly with the problems, as well as options for a solution. I was also available when they needed me, answered my phone, responded timely. That built trust. 3. Be a challenger. I never EVER let a client make a decision if it wasn’t the decision I would make without talking them through it. We had data We had results But they had feelings. Having slow intentional conversation, about why they want to go a certain route, and what their expectations are of that route, Vs what the data says about how that will go. ✨ BONUS: Care about them. Be their friend. Know about their life. (This may be unpopular opinion. Don’t care.) My longest running client doesn’t have LinkedIn, But he sent me this after I told him I was leaving: “You've been awesome to Kevin's Royal Automotive for all these years I've known you. Probably one of the best reps I ever ever known. I'm sure you'll find another job and this is good. By the way l'm looking for a good Sales Person to sell cars. Do you know anybody?” ❤️ Have great Wednesday fam! You look cute today!\n\nStarving Salesperson #8 \"Calling on them is a waste of time. We made them mad years ago.\" If you're a sales leader you've heard these words. If you're a good sales leader you've avoided saying them yourself. This excuse or \"objection\" is total BULL$HIT! Unfortunately, it is allowed by too many organizations. It constipates sales efforts and holds valuable prospects in a worthless \"waiting zone.\" In some cases, talented salespeople hold these names as theirs and prevent others from trying their luck while doing nothing themselves to change the dynamic. Once again, BULL$HIT. Years ago I took an assignment as VP of Sales for a great company that was stuck. They were mired in the mud at $12,000,000. As costs rose their margins slipped. They had to grow sales. I’ve shared his story before. The owner asked me, \"where are you going to get new business?\" I responded that I was going to call everyone he had made mad. He laughed and said, \"that's a big list. Good luck.\" I went to reps holding names that fit this dynamic. I insisted on appointments. The reps resisted but the calls did get made. Guess what. Getting angry prospects to see us was easy. You see, angry people want a chance to vent. They want a chance to tell you why they're mad. They want to share their point of view. In every case the former client felt ignored. Whatever they were angered by, they felt their frustration didn't matter. In most cases, they were surprised that ownership hadn't contacted them to find out why they stopped buying. This perceived indifference made them feel like they had no value. Now every failure is different. You can't assume that one size fits all. There isn't a single recipe for making things right. But listening and letting the prospect vent is always good medicine. Pent up frustration gets shared. Tension is relieved. The air in the balloon is released. Once that happens ask if you can earn a chance to repair the damage. Ask if the offended party will work with you to make things better. Ask how you're doing as you go about doing so. I'll be amazed if you hear the word no to any of these questions. We certainly didn't hear the word no on my assignment. We reopened 100% of these relationships. We doubled the size of the business in 5 years and ultimately sold the company to a consolidator. I could give you example after example where a dynamic leader demonstrated that this \"we can't go back to them\" concept is junk. Perhaps I'll do that in another post or in answer to your questions. Just know it's a mistake not to call. So reps and managers, don't hold names in \"we pissed them off\" land. Dial the phone. Ask how you can fix things. There are very valuable names in your dormant client files. These guys were customers once so they saw your value. Go fix it. Gotta go. Spencer has taken up web surfing because he thinks it's easier than calling people. It's taking a bad turn.\n\nTo the right of this picture - halfway down - was an office now long gone... This was my first ever sales job during the summer in York. Telesales B2C - selling insurance. My manager was like a real life David Brent. - \"Smile before you dial!\" - \"The more calls you make the luckier you get.\" - \"Stand up Purves! Sitting is for wimps!\" Hundreds of cold calls each day. We didn't get to sit down till we made a sale (just imagine that now). My legs would ache when I got home. This was the day of the one-call close. Calling people at dinner time (or teatime if you're British & northern). Plenty \"F*ck offs\" & \"Don't you dare interrupt my tea again!\" After the initial shock at the level of rejection, I became resilient pretty quickly. And I started to sell. I learnt more that summer about sales, people, business, the real world, myself - than I did in the previous decade at school (even if I did take business studies...which was about as useful as a chocolate kettle). If you want to get ahead in sales, in business & in life, cut your teeth quickly by jumping in at the deep end. Nothing else comes close! #sales #sell #mindset\n\nI’ll be honest.. this started as a sales post. “Here’s why it’s great to work for yourself. I can help you blah blah blah…” I was about to complain of the pitfalls too (and things that’ve been stressing me out lately too): • I work ALL the time • I took a pretty big pay cut • Revenue responsibility is stressful • I am more cautious with money now. But today isn’t just any other day. Seeing the date reminded me of those poor people who headed to work on a random Tuesday 22 years ago. With things they planned to do next year. Next week. That evening. Heads down, following their routines like they have hundreds of times before. I remember mine: Wake up. Shower. Toss on a suit. Walk east down 48th street. Stop at the same food cart. Grab a coffee and bagel with cream cheese. Enter my building. Elevator to 19. Bang away on Excel and PowerPoint until 11pm. Go home. Do it again the next day. But that next day never came for them. It made me realize how incredibly fortunate I am. To sit where I am now. Bare feet in the cool, wet grass. Staring at the beautiful lake in front of me. The sun rising behind me. It’ll be hot today, so I’ll head in for a quick dip later. And I just booked my ticket to head back to the US for 6 weeks over Thanksgiving. I’m excited to walk in my childhood home and hug my parents. We always think we have another day. Most of the time – we WILL. But one day, we won’t. And we have no idea when. So – what are we missing out on by putting something off? Until tomorrow? Next month? Next year? What are we missing out on by selling our time, and control of our days, to someone else? There are things you want to see, explore, and do with your life. What’s stopping you from going for it now? So in closing what I intended to be a sales post: It’s OK if you don’t work with me, but I urge you… Don’t wait another day. Go get what you want. __________\n\nI’ve just had one client tell me they do...! Moving swiftly on... How would you feel if your sales team could become 100% more efficient overnight? Seriously...Working a sales pipeline isn’t easy. You do have to kiss a lot of frogs. If you are paying a team to kiss these frogs...That’s not going to be cheap. Would it not be better to let someone who costs you virtually nothing to do this kissing for you? If this person is never off sick, never takes a holiday, doesn’t ask for pay rises and does exactly what you want them to do...Isn’t that even better? Is it not more efficient and more profitable to just get your sales team closing deals, rather than kissing frogs...? Of course it is. The good news is... We have that frog kisser for you...We call it our AI Prince Charming. He loves kissing frogs, he’ll kiss then 24/7/365. He’ll kiss frogs all day for you and then just send you clients who want to move forward. All your sales team need to do then is close the deal. Is this not a more efficient and more profitable way of working? If you disagree, you need to tell me why! If we gave you our Prince Charming to trial, would that be enough for you to give it a go? Or do you want to carry on kissing frogs? To all those frog kissers out there...We are here to do the dirty work for you! #moresales #norisk #easy #newbusiness\n\nMany of you don’t know this but I quit sales. I was 22, and got my first real job out of college doing sales. Within the first hour of the job, I went to my boss and said \"sales isn't for me.\" I still remember the sales PTSD I carried for 3 years not taking jobs that reminded me of sales. Luckily, I got my boot camp of sales as a real estate agent at Keller Williams door knocking and cold calling every day. To help pay my bills, I got a part time job at Allstate Insurance cold calling in the afternoons. 12 months of doing cold calling and door knocking you'd think I made a lot of money. I didn't. I was over $10,000 in debt b/c I could barely pay my bills with the money I was making. But I finally stopped being scared of sales after going through \"sales bootcamp.\" Eventually, I worked as an AE for a SaaS startup in the legal tech space (company called PracticePanther). After 6 months, I became VP of sales at 26 and took the company from a few hundred clients to tens of thousands in 4 years, eventually getting acquired. Worked again a couple of more time as a VP of sales taking a company from $1M ARR to $4.5M in 18 months. Why am I telling you this? Because I used to struggle with prospecting, discovery, demo, follow up, and close....all of it. But I was coachable enough to learn and perfect my calls and the salespeople I hired and trained over the years. And I didn't do it by myself. I invested in books, courses, and mentors. I paid money to gain time and experience (the other way around is more expensive in the long run) If your company isn't willing to invest in you or give you stipend, you can either complain or suck it up and invest in yourself. If you're not seeing your sales improve, you can either complain or figure out another angle and get help. You're the CEO of yourself, own up to the job that most normal people run away from (like the younger Mor). P.s Here’s a pic of me door-knocking (I almost got arrested that day..but that's a story for another time) PPS.

I finally decided to treat myself and went to my favorite brand’s dealership. The rep was nice, showed me around, and I left feeling excited. But then, the next morning at 8am, my phone rang. It was the sales rep, eager to follow up... while I was still sleeping! 😴 Seriously, who calls a potential customer at 8am? Here’s why bad follow-ups like this are worse than no follow-ups: 1. 𝐓𝐢𝐦𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐈𝐬 𝐄𝐯𝐞𝐫𝐲𝐭𝐡𝐢𝐧𝐠 If you call too early or too late, you’re just annoying people. The 8am call made me reconsider if I even wanted that car. A good follow-up respects the customer’s time. 2. 𝐏𝐞𝐫𝐬𝐨𝐧𝐚𝐥 𝐒𝐩𝐚𝐜𝐞 𝐌𝐚𝐭𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐬 Constant calls, emails, or messages can make customers feel harassed. If you make them feel like they're being stalked, they'll run faster than a cheetah on Red Bull. 3. 𝐈𝐭 𝐒𝐡𝐨𝐰𝐬 𝐋𝐚𝐜𝐤 𝐨𝐟 𝐀𝐰𝐚𝐫𝐞𝐧𝐞𝐬𝐬 Calling me at 8am showed the rep didn't care about my schedule. It’s crucial to ask customers for the best time to follow up. Otherwise, it looks like you don’t care. 4. 𝐌𝐢𝐬𝐬𝐞𝐝 𝐎𝐩𝐩𝐨𝐫𝐭𝐮𝐧𝐢𝐭𝐢𝐞𝐬 𝐟𝐨𝐫 𝐆𝐞𝐧𝐮𝐢𝐧𝐞 𝐄𝐧𝐠𝐚𝐠𝐞𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭 Instead of annoying me with a badly timed call, the rep could have sent a friendly email or text later in the day. Bad follow-ups waste the chance to build a real connection. So, here’s a tip: if you’re in sales, avoid being like my over-eager car rep. Plan your follow-ups with care, respect personal boundaries, and always aim to add value to the conversation. Otherwise, you might as well not follow up at all. 🚗💨\n\nThought of The Day (02/29): Own It” I respect people who are proud to say, “I’m in Sales.” But, where I lose a little bit of respect is when they feel the need to explain “why” or justify the position as “helping people” or “caring for their clients.” I have never met a person who is “in sales,” with long-term success, across multiple years and roles, who doesn’t have a strong moral compass to do the right thing by the person who pays their bills (aka. Clients) so who needs an explanation? It’s not like you have a lawyer who has to explain they are proud to be a lawyer because…..(So many funny jokes to add here). They just say I am a lawyer. The heart surgeon says, “I am a surgeon.” (They already command respect with those four words). But they don’t add, “I fix valves so people don’t bleed out or die prematurely.” When you have to explain why you are in sales, for example, it is self-serving or almost an apology, like thinking “sales people” are just a lower class. I spent 2019/2020 figuring out my next career move after a personal challenge and didn’t really know what to do so I signed up and spent hours driving for Uber/Lyft. I told people, without blinking an eye, “I’m an Uber Driver,” and I told someone last week, “I’m a DJ.” I didn’t tell I people love spinning music and driving complete strangers (I do find more satisfaction doing that than almost anything I have ever done). When asked “why,” I would always respond, “Because I am good at it.” And, 99% of the time when asked what I do, for the last 27 years, I responded with, “I’m in Sales.” When asked “why,” I would always respond with, “Because I am good at it.” When I took a test that told me what I would be good at for a career, it told me I would make a great “Butler.” That was dope!!! Immediately I thought of Robert Guillaume (Benson) and thought, “I like that! He was the coolest!” And, I would answer if asked what I do, “I am a butler.” When asked “why,” I would probably answer respond with, “Because I am good at it.” Own it. I’m proud of awards for corporate accomplishments. A five-star rating as a driver and the receipts from the liquor sales of the bars I worked as a younger man. I never felt the need to justify any of it.\n\nMy sales had tanked, and I was fighting to turn things around. I wasn't getting meetings, deals weren't closing, and I was frustrated. I was supposed to be good at sales, but I was letting everyone down. \"Why can't this be easy?\" I asked over and over again. Then, while listening to Jim Rohn on a CD, I heard him say, \"Don't wish it was easier, wish you were better.\" I started thinking through all the things I had done in the last 30 days and realized I hadn't done enough. Earlier that year, I had been selected as \"40 under 40\" and received the High Impact Award from the Fort Worth Chamber. I had been on a high and stopped doing the things that got me there. I had been living life like I had made it, and it cost me. I realized you never make it. You celebrate what you have accomplished, be proud of yourself, and you keep doing what got you there. The moment you think you made it, You lose. There is no \"made it.\" Everything is a small portion of your overall story. I was living through the lens as if those awards defined me, but what I was really treating them as was like the high-school touchdown passes. I wasn't working towards something new; I was living as if this was it. You can't live life off of past accomplishments; you have to be working towards something so you stay in the game. Celebrate the wins and then get back to work. This isn't the hustle and grind; this is about your sanity and mental game. If you stop doing what got you here, you will become a zombie, slowly walking through life. There is no \"made it\"; it's just the crest of the next hill. Keep going, do the work, and show up for yourself. You can't change your stars by looking in the rearview mirror."
