        "text": "Tinnitus is the perception of sound, with no external origin, in the ears or head. There are millions of people across the globe who suffers from this irritating condition. This article discusses different types of neuroimaging techniques in the study of tinnitus. It is shown that nuclear medicine and neuroradiologic approaches such as Positron Emission Tomography (PET) and functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) are helpful in the demonstration of brain activity in individuals with tinnitus. These techniques have been used to demonstrate tinnitus-related activity (TRA) in individuals with tinnitus who can alter or modify their tinnitus. It is hoped that these techniques will increase our understanding regarding the nature of tinnitus and its possible treatments."
