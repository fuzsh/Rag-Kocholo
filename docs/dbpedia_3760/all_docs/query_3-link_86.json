        "text": "Astronomy in popular perception is about stars, planets, sun, moon, eclipses, comets, meteorites and associated observable phenomena. Something of all of these was known to our ancients though not in the same form and detail as it is available now. In the context of India, the question is what was known, in what detail and when. For the siddhānta period, roughly starting with the Common Era, (CE) such questions have been fairly well answered. This has been possible since several texts of the period, specifically devoted to astronomy are available for systematic study. But for the more ancient period we have no exclusive texts other than Lagadha’s Vedānga Jyotiṣa (c 1400 BCE) which is a calendar with no reference to eclipses or planets. Hence when one talks of Vedic Times several precautions are necessary..... In the following articles we investigate briefly how comets, meteorites, and eclipses were experienced and pictured in the Vedic texts. Over a long period of time the effect of precession was also felt as with the loss of importance for the constellation Śiśumāra (Draco) and shifting of the Pole Star Dhruva. The astral descriptions and the religious lore behind the above astronomical entities provided the inspiration for the development of observational and mathematical astronomy in India. Some portion of the present study has appeared in the Indian Journal of History of Science (2005, 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012) in the form of papers. However, considerable new information, beyond the published material, can be found in the following pages\n\nInvestigation of the astronomical content of ancient Vedic texts along with historically constrained texts of the first and second millennium CE shows that the sky pictures of the most ancient period get contrasted with later ones due to the phenomenon of precession of earth’s rotational axis. Most important among such observations is the fixed Pole Star, named Abhaya-Dhruva at the tail end of the constellation known as Śiśumāra (whale or dolphin) described in the Taittirīya Āraṇyaka (II.19) of the Kṛṣṇa-yajurveda branch. With passage of time, in the Maitrāyaṇīya Āraṇyaka, a question arises, why even Dhruva moves. The Brahmāṇḍa Purāṇa declares that star Dhruva rotates in the same position, like the nave of a potter’s wheel. This and a few other Purāṇas extol Dhruva as the fourteenth star on the tail of the constellation Śiśumara, as in the Vedic text. Al-Biruni (973–1048 CE) mentions that devout Hindus, during his time, believed their Pole Star to be in the constellation that looks like an aquatic animal called, Śiśumāra. This paper updates my previous work published in IJHS-2011.\n\nThe modern world has witnessed great wonders in space related events with the help of Modern scientific equipments. However, the space and the stars have been always a matter of curiosity among people throughout the ages. Interestingly, there are lots of legends and myths related with the stars and constellations all over the world, the famous ones like the stories related with Cassipea, Andromeda and Perseus, the story of Dhruva and the seven stars constellations. The Rig Veda, one of the oldest literary examples of astronomical observations refers to the constellations and stars. Similarly there has ben a similar trend alongside the Vedic tradition like the ‘Gond Astronomy’ which tells us about the myths associated with the different constellations. The Gonds divide the region of the Orion constellation into five different constellations by including some neighbouring stars. The korku tribe have an interesting myth on the Centaurus constellation. In the Nimni district of Maharashtra, the local Gond inhabitants describe Saptarshi(as Katul and Keher), Samdur( as sea ), a group of 4 stars in quadrilateral( probably Auriga) comes overhead at 4 am, rains arrive and farming begins. In Assam and the Northeastern region of India , the study of the stars though in the primitive form might have been developed during the ages. In this paper an attempt is put forward by the scholar to study about the myths related with the stars and constellations in Assam.\n\nAstronomy is the oldest subject when compared to the other science subjects. Even before the invention of script, ancient man started recording the observational knowledge of the heavenly changes, the rising and setting of the Sun, its annual northward and southward movements in the sky, the phases of the Moon, the motions of the other wanderers relative to the background of the fixed stars, the diurnal movements of the stars, and the changing face of the sky throughout the year, etc., In by putting impressions on stone (carving) and painting in caves. From the very early times, men sought to explain these phenomena and to be able to predict the positions of these heavenly wonders. The first ideas about the structure of the universe gradually took shape, with the earth fixed and immovable at its center and everything else rotating around it in a small compact universe, with the stars in outer sphere, just beyond the orbit of Saturn, most distant from the known planets. The striking spectacles presented to mankind by the varied appearances of a sky, covered with thousands of shining objects of different degrees of brightness, all apparently revolving around the earth; the changing phases of the moon; the bright morning and evening stars; comets and shooting stars; and the surprising phenomena of eclipses of the Sun and the Moon, have, from the very earliest times, raised feelings of admiration and often of superstitious alarm. Even the most primitive of peoples must have found it desirable to take note of the configurations and movements of the stars and the Sun and the Moon, the two latter objects being obviously very closely connected with the subsistence and the wellbeing of the human race. And the stars were found to be guides for the travelers by land or sea, while the fixing of the changes of the seasons, so essential to the farmers, was at a later date found to be possible by means of the times of their rising and setting throughout the year. Mankind had to relate all activities to the daily alterations of light and darkness, and to the daily and seasonal alterations of warmth and cold, and soon saw that these were due to the\n\nThe navaranga in the medieval stone temple of Vidyasankara at Sringeri, built around A.D. 1350, has twelve zodiacal pillars arranged in a square with the zodiacal signs carved on them. It has been claimed that the morning sunrise lights up the pillar that corresponds to the zodiacal constellation in which Sun is located at that time, so the temple can be used as an instrument to predict calendar days. We carried out observations to investigate this aspect by monitoring both sunrises and sunsets, and found that the correspondence between the illumination of specific pillars and the zodiacal sign of the Sun could only be maintained if the epoch for such an arrangement was around 2000 B.C. The implications of this finding are discussed in this paper."
