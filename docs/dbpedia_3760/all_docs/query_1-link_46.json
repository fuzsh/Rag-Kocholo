She passed away on January 9th, 2023.\n\nShe was a pious soul with remarkable religious and spiritual knowledge. She was always willing to share her knowledge and participate in spiritual activities. During her career and life she came across many Swami’s and leading scholars with them she created special place in their heart with her devotion.\n\nHema Bhatt is survived by her daughters - Nirali, Viral, and Dharati, her son-in-laws Abhijit, Gaurang, and Chetan, her grandchildren - Yash, Atmana, Janaki, Nrushad, Kavira, Shivam, and Nandaj, and her sisters - Saroj, Harshada, Indu, Raksha, Rutulata, and her brother Dinesh Joshi.\n\nServices will be held Thursday, January 12th at Aaron Ruben Nelson Mortuary, 11411 North Michigan Road, Zionsville, IN 46077 at 10 AM."
