        "text": "Engelbert Humperdinck, external is better known for his soothing ballads than electioneering. But the King of Romance has unexpectedly entered the mayoral race in Leicester by urging voters to back an old friend, who's a candidate.\n\nHe's businessman, city magistrate and the president of the Leicestershire Chamber of Commerce, external Rick Moore, who is standing as an independent and one of 11 candidates.\n\nBut why would a singing legend - now living in the Californian sunshine of Bel Air - indulge in a touch of celebrity politics?\n\nHumperdinck says he's proud to endorse a candidate who was raised - like him - in the same area of Highfields in inner city Leicester.\n\nThat high profile endorsement has certainly created a buzz and excitement around the campaign.\n\n\"I've known Rick for a long time and I think he would be good for my city,\" Engelbert told me from California.\n\n\"I don't get involved in politics but this is about Leicester and it's important.\"\n\nHis intervention is a further indication that Leicester's mayoral race is fast overshadowing another equally important election in the city. And that's the parliamentary by-election in Leicester South.\n\nWhen the Labour leader Ed Miliband, external was campaigning in the constituency this week, the party's mayoral candidate Sir Peter Soulsby was nowhere in sight.\n\nWas this a snub by the former sitting MP? Apparently not. Labour officials just wanted their parliamentary candidate in Leicester South to get at least some media coverage.\n\nIt was Sir Peter's decision to run in the race to become Leicester's first directly-elected mayor that created the parliamentary vacancy in Leicester South.\n\nBut the by-election has yet to create the same level of excitement as the mayoral contest. Maybe a lack of controversy in a by-election campaign is a party manager's dream, but there's concern about a low turn-out.\n\nLabour's parliamentary candidate Jon Ashworth can also be forgiven for being rather distracted at present. His partner Emilie is expecting their first child a few days after the election.\n\nHe's already anxious about what to do if Emilie goes into Labour a few days early.\n\nAt least the Leicester Royal Infirmary is opposite the location of the count.\n\n\"I may end up being the first winning candidate to be absent from my own election count because of an urgent call to the maternity unit,\" he admitted to me.\n\nYou can imagine the headline writers having a field day with that one: \"By-election delivery in Labour ward\". You know the sort of thing...\n\nLib Dem hopes\n\nThe Liberal Democrats, external won Leicester South in a sensational by-election victory six years ago. Then the Blair government's invasion of Iraq was a huge issue in a constituency where the Muslim population is 21% of the electorate."
