The Chinese, who were obligated under a 99-year lease to allow the British to use the area as a colony until 1997, likened the recreational use to the placement of an American military base on the Chinese mainland. The diplomatic note was delivered in Beijing to British Chargé d'Affaires K. M. Wilford, who was summoned to the Chinese Foreign Ministry by Hsieh Li, the Director of the Ministry's Department for Western European affairs.[2]\n\nAt 3:30 in the morning local time, Pakistan launched Operation Grand Slam, a surprise attack into India, with the objective of capturing the vital town of Akhnoor in Jammu and Kashmir, so as to sever communications and cut off supply routes to Indian troops.[3][4][5] Pakistani leader Ayub Khan stated that \"Hindu morale will not stand more than a couple of hard blows at the right time and place\".[6] India responded by calling in its air force.\n\nThe United States Marine Corps announced that it was cutting the amount of training of new recruits from 12 weeks of boot camp to only eight, in response to the sudden increase in combat troops assigned to the Vietnam War. \"The aim is to process 30,000 additional men,\" a report noted, \"without adding to present marine facilities or increasing the staff of instructors,\" effectively educating 50% more U.S. Marines each year.[7]\n\nFormer U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower paid a final visit to his birthplace in Denison, Texas, and spent half an hour touring the house on 609 South Lamar Avenue where he had been born almost 75 years earlier. Eisenhower gave a speech at the auditorium at Denison High School, which had been renamed in his honor after alumni had protested against renaming the entire school.[8]\n\nThe People's Republic of China created the Tibet Autonomous Region, giving the conquered Buddhist Kingdom of Tibet limited authority on matters of education and language policy, and a Tibetan member of the Chinese Communist Party, Ngapoi Ngawang Jigme, as the regional chairman.[9]\n\nBorn: Craig McLachlan, Australian actor and singer; in Long Jetty, New South Wales\n\nThe valuable DeLong Star Ruby, stolen on October 29, 1964, was recovered from a telephone booth at a toll road service plaza, on the Sunshine State Parkway 4 miles (6.4 km) from Palm Beach, Florida. Multimillionaire John D. MacArthur arranged for $25,000 ransom to be released to the callers after verifying the authenticity of the ruby.[10][11]\n\nFormer presidential candidate and U.S. Senator Barry Goldwater filed a lawsuit against publisher Ralph Ginzburg and his publishing company, Fact Magazine, Inc., seeking two million dollars for libel arising from an article questioning the candidate's sanity. The front cover of the September–October 1964 issue of Fact magazine had the headline \"1,889 psychiatrists say Goldwater is psychologically unfit to be President\", and in Ginzburg's article (including an excerpt reprinted on the back of the magazine) was the statement, \"He consciously wants to destroy the world with atomic bombs. He is a mass murderer at heart. He is amoral and immoral. He is a dangerous lunatic.\"[12] Goldwater would be awarded $75,000 by a federal jury in 1968[13] and the U.S. Supreme Court would ultimately affirm the decision in 1970.[14]\n\nTwo homes in Vandenberg Village, California, were damaged, and 41 people taken to the hospital, after debris from a destroyed missile fell on their neighborhood 6 miles (9.7 km) from Vandenberg Air Force Base. A Thor-Agena booster rocket had been launched from the base minutes earlier but then deviated from its course, and was destroyed by remote control at an altitude of 32,000 feet (9,800 m), sending flaming debris on the area below.[15][16]\n\nAmerican comedian Phyllis Diller, whose popular standup comic routine was based on her experiences as a housewife and on a mythical husband nicknamed \"Fang\", filed for divorce against her real husband of 25 years, Sherwood Diller.[17] The uncontested divorce would be granted the following day.[18]\n\nTahir Yahya was forced to resign as Prime Minister of Iraq. The vacancy would be filled four days later by Arif Abd ar-Razzaq, who would flee the country on September 17 after only 10 days in office.[19]\n\nBorn: Lennox Lewis, British boxer who was world heavyweight boxing champion during much of the 1990s and early 2000s; in West Ham, London\n\nDied:\n\nÉmile Muselier, 83, Admiral of the Free French Naval Forces composed of ships that continued to fight World War II when France surrendered to Nazi Germany in 1940.\n\nJohannes Bobrowski, 48, East German poet\n\nIndia's Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri approved a three-point policy in the nation's war against Pakistan, specifically, defending against Pakistan's attempts to seize control of Indian Kashmir; to destroy the offensive power of Pakistan's armed forces; and \"to occupy only the minimum Pakistan territory necessary to achieve these purposes\", removing troops \"after the satisfactory conclusion of the war.\"[20]\n\nThe earliest known skateboard park opened in Tucson, Arizona. Surf City, located on 5140 East Speedway Road, billed itself as the \"world's first championship skateboard course\", provided free use of helmets to every participant who paid the one dollar admission fee, and offered to rent boards to kids who did not own one.[21][22]\n\nCommunist China's Vice-Premier Lin Biao, viewed as the eventual successor of party chairman Mao Zedong, published the widely circulated essay Long Live the Victory of the People's War!, providing the official view of China's role as a world power and a guide to fomenting similar \"people's revolutions\" in nations around the globe.[23]\n\nKosmos 84, the Soviet Union's first nuclear powered satellite, was launched into orbit. Its source of fuel was a radioisotope thermoelectric generator (RTG) fueled with polonium-210.[24]\n\nHéctor García-Godoy became President of the Dominican Republic as the military junta turned over leadership of the Caribbean nation to civilians.[25]\n\nPope Paul VI issued the encyclical Mysterium fidei, reinforcing traditional Roman Catholic doctrine concerning the Eucharist.\n\nBorn: Charlie Sheen, American film and television actor; as Carlos Irwin Estévez in New York City\n\nNewcomb Mott, a 27-year-old American book salesman from Boston, went sightseeing while staying at a hotel in the Norwegian town of Kirkenes, and ventured across Norway's border in the Finnmark province into the Soviet Union. Kirkenes police chief Gunnar Haarstad found that Mott had last been seen at the village of Elvenes, about a mile from the border, and that Russian border authorities confirmed on September 9 that Mott had been arrested for illegal entry. Mott would be convicted on November 24 of illegal entry and sentenced to 18 months in prison. By January 17, he would be dead, and Soviet authorities would say that he had committed suicide on a train that was taking him to a forced labor camp at Murmansk.[26]\n\nYorkshire defeated Surrey, 317 to 142, to win the championship game of the Gillette Cup, which had started as a single elimination tournament in April with all 17 of England's first-class county teams, and five minor teams that had been invited to participate. Geoff Boycott's 146 runs in the final at Lord's Cricket Ground, remains the highest ever scored in a county limited-overs final played there.[27]\n\nIn a rare show of defiance against the Communist government of the Soviet Union, public protests began in the Ukrainian SSR against the August 24 roundup of Ukrainian intellectuals by the KGB. The time chosen for the outcry was the premiere in Kiev of the new film by Sergei Parajanov, Shadows of Forgotten Ancestors.[28]\n\nBorn:\n\nMichael Bentt, British-born professional boxer who briefly held the World Boxing Organization heavyweight title; in East Dulwich, London\n\nBowie Lam, Chinese television actor and singer; in Hong Kong\n\nDied:\n\nDr. Albert Schweitzer, 90, German Alsace-born Gabonese physician and missionary, and recipient of the 1952 Nobel Peace Prize, died at the hospital he had built in the African jungle at Lambarene in Gabon.\n\nFelix Tijerina, 60, Mexican-American restaurateur and philanthropist in Houston, and one-time national president of the League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC).\n\nAlfred Bossom, 83, English skyscraper architect and inventor\n\nThree Iranian graduates from the Tehran University College of Engineering founded the Mujahedin-e Khalq Organization (MEK) to oppose the Western-style reforms and the political repression of the Shah. Mohammed Hanifnezhad, Said Mohsen, and Ali-Asghar Badizadegan successfully worked for the overthrow of the Shah in 1979, and the establishment of an Islamic republic, and then saw their organization would have no role under the regime of the Ayatollah Khomeini. The group would then wage its own campaign against Khomeini, with terrorist attacks against Islamic Republican Party members, and the assassination of the President and the Prime Minister.[29]\n\nA battalion of the United States Marines used what it described as \"tear gas\" to force hidden Viet Cong guerrillas into the open in the South Vietnamese village of Vinh Quang in the Binh Dinh Province. The North Vietnamese branch of the International Red Cross, however, said that the 48 canisters were of a high concentration of phenacyl chloride or CN gas, and that 35 civilians had been killed.[30] USMC Lt. Col. Leon N. Utter, commander of the 2nd Battalion of the 7th U.S. Marine regiment, was investigated but cleared of wrongdoing.[31]\n\nThe word \"hippie\" first appeared in print, in an article in the San Francisco Examiner[32] by reporter Michael Fallon, who was writing a series about the Haight-Ashbury neighborhood. \"Five untroubled young 'hippies',\" Fallon began, \"sprawled on floor mattresses and slouched in an armchair retrieved from a debris box, flipped cigaret ashes at a seatbelt in their Waller Street flat and pondered their next move.\"[33]\n\nThe 1965 UCI Road World Championships, conducted by bicycling's highest authority, the Union Cycliste Internationale, took place at Lasarte-Oria near San Sebastián in the Pyrenees mountains of Spain.[34] There were four events, a men's road race, a women's road race, an amateur men's race, and a team time trial.\n\nPravda, the newspaper of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, published an editorial titled \"Friendship of Peoples\", deploring anti-Semitism.[35] As another historian would note later, the condemnation \"rested not on morality, but on the practical ground that such manifestations blacken the Soviet image abroad.\"[36]\n\nDied: Carlos F. Borcosque, 70, cinematic director in both Chile and Argentina\n\nAt 3:30 in the morning local time, Indian Army troops poured across the border into the Punjab province in Pakistan, catching the Pakistani Army by surprise and opening the Indo-Pakistan War on a second front.[37][38][39] At the same time, Pakistani aircraft bombed Indian airfields[40] and dropped paratroopers in India's Jammu and Kashmir state, 14 miles inside the border, and threatened to drive toward New Delhi.[41] September 6 is now honored annually as Defence Day, a public holiday to commemorate the event.\n\nThe 11 members of the United Nations Security Council voted unanimously for Resolution 210 to direct Secretary-General U Thant to negotiate a peaceful solution to the Indo-Pakistani War. Joining the five permanent members (the United States, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, France, and Taiwan) were temporary members Bolivia, the Ivory Coast, Jordan, Malaysia, the Netherlands, and Uruguay.[42]\n\nBorn: Dana Dane, American rapper; as Dana McCleese in Fort Greene, Brooklyn[43]\n\nCanada's Prime Minister Lester Pearson scheduled nationwide parliamentary elections for November 8.[44] Pearson's Liberal Party held a plurality of seats in the House of Commons, but was six short of the 133 required for a majority of the 265 available, and Pearson concluded that it was an auspicious time for the government to increase its strength.\n\nTwelve of the 31 men working inside an underwater caisson were killed when a decompression chamber exploded. The 31 were working on bridge pilings under the St. Lawrence River near Trois-Rivieres, Quebec.[45]\n\nIn a follow-up to August's Operation Starlite, United States Marines and South Vietnamese forces initiated Operation Piranha on the Batangan Peninsula, 23 miles (37 km) south of the Chu Lai Marine base.[46]\n\nFilipino-American members of the Agricultural Workers Organizing Committee (AWOC) labor union walked out on strike at nine of the major grape growing farms in Kern County, California,[47] after years of being paid lower wages (as American citizens) than guest workers from Mexico. Other grievances by the predominantly Filipino-American AWOC were bad sanitary conditions, a lack of drinkable water for field workers, and brutal treatment by supervisors. Within eight days, the predominantly Mexican-American National Farm Workers Association (NFWA) would join the strike and 21 farms would be idle during the grape harvest.[48]\n\nBert Campaneris, a shortstop for baseball's Kansas City Athletics, became the first major leaguer to play all nine positions in one game.[49] The Athletics were in last place in the ten-team American League when they hosted the Los Angeles Angels, and lost 5–3 in a game that ran into extra innings. \"A surprisingly large crowd of 21,576\" came to watch the experiment. The box score listed \"Campy\" in the order of the positions he played in the first nine of those innings: \"Campaneris, ss, 2b, 3b, lf, cf, rf, 1b, p, c\".[50]\n\nThe United States halted military aid to both India and Pakistan, in response to the Indo-Pakistan War. \"Since the U.S. was the sole supplier of arms to Pakistan,\" an author would later note, \"while India received arms from several sources, notably the USSR, the embargo was especially effective against Pakistan.\"[51] Communist China sent a diplomatic note to India with the threat that if India pursued a takeover of Pakistan, there would be \"grave consequences\".[52]\n\nThe war between India and Pakistan escalated as the Indian Army sent troops toward the Pakistani capital of Karachi and toward Hyderabad, while Pakistani Air Force jets attempted to attack the Indian capital of New Delhi.[53] The Pakistan Navy raided India's coasts without any resistance in Operation Dwarka. Pakistan now celebrates September 8 as Victory Day annually.\n\nDied:\n\nDorothy Dandridge, 42, American actress and singer, was found dead in her apartment in West Hollywood, California.

Ultimately, Betsy would leave behind 76 deaths and $1.42 billion in damage in Louisiana (equivalent to $10.69 billion fifty years later).[56] The storm was the first hurricane to cause more than one billion dollars worth of destruction, giving it the nickname \"Billion Dollar Betsy\".[57][58] It would be the last major hurricane to strike New Orleans until Hurricane Katrina 40 years later.\n\nPresident Ayub issued the \"Enemy Property (Custody and Registration) Order II\" which effectively discriminated against the Hindu minority in both West and East Pakistan by providing that India was an enemy country, that the assets and land of all Indian nationals in Pakistan were to be put under the control of the Custodian of Enemy Property, and that benefits arising from the property should not go to the enemy. Even after the termination of the national state of emergency on February 16, 1969, the law would continue.[59]\n\nU.S. President Lyndon Johnson signed the legislation creating the eleventh cabinet level department in the federal executive branch, the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development, generally referred to as \"HUD\". Performing the duties of the former Housing and Home Finance Agency (HHFA),[60] it was the first new cabinet department since the U. S. Department of Health, Education and Welfare had been launched in 1953. Under the legislation, HUD would not become official for 60 days.[61]\n\nBaseball player Sandy Koufax of the Los Angeles Dodgers pitched a perfect game in a 1–0 win against the Chicago Cubs.[62] It was Koufax's fourth no-hitter in as many seasons. Despite the loss, it was an impressive game for the opposing pitcher, Bob Hendley of the Cubs, who threw a one-hitter. \"Don't forget the other fellow did a pretty good job out there,\" Koufax told reporters afterward. \"That Hendley gave us only one hit and we were lucky to get the run we did.\"[63]\n\nU.S. Navy Commander James Stockdale of the carrier USS Oriskany was captured as a prisoner of war when his F-8E jet was shot down over North Vietnam. He would spend more than seven years as a POW, and would later be awarded the Medal of Honor for his leadership of his fellow prisoners during captivity, and retire as a Vice Admiral. In 1992, he would be a candidate for Vice President of the United States as the running mate of Ross Perot.[64]\n\nU.N. Secretary-General U Thant recommended the People's Republic of China for United Nations membership.[65] Thant, however, was in Karachi to begin negotiating with Pakistan's President Ayub Khan on terms for a ceasefire, and his speech was read aloud by an assistant.[66]\n\nVatican City announced that it would no longer lend out any of its art masterpieces for exhibition. The year before, it had allowed the statue of the Pietà, carved by Michelangelo in the late 15th century, to be displayed at the 1964 New York World's Fair.[67]\n\nGemini 6 was moved to complex 19 and hoisted to the top of the Gemini launch vehicle.

A reporter at the time praised on the controlled 72° temperature in a city where it was 97° outside, but noted that the field \"was almost devoid of grass\" and the game was on hard ground painted green. \"Football seemed strange indoors. Without mud and wind and bone-chiling cold, it certainly was a better game. But it seemed artificial— a bit too antiseptic.\"[76]\n\nThe Battle of Phillora, described by one military historian as \"the biggest tank engagement since the Second World War\",[77] took place near the Pakistani city of Sialkot, with the Indian Army making a surprise attack with Centurion Mk7 and M4 Sherman tanks, and the Army of Pakistan defending with M47 and M48 Patton tanks.

Although Labor still had a plurality of seats (68, or 43.1%), its opposition combined for 80 seats. The conservative, liberal, and moderate parties (Høyre, Venstre, and Senterpartiet, literally \"right\", \"left\", and \"center\") were supplemented by the Kristeleg Folkeparti (Christian People's Party) in opposition to Arbeiderparti rule.

The Johnson-favored resolution did not leave the House Subcommittee for District of Columbia Affairs, and a substitute resolution, with a lengthy process involving multiple steps, was approved by the House, 198 to 139. The bill introduced by Representative B. F. Sisk of California would provide for a referendum on whether to elect a \"charter board\" to draw up a proposed charter for a plan to govern the District and the City, a second referendum on whether to approve the proposed charters, and, if the two referendums were successful, a vote in both houses of Congress on whether to approve or reject the plans as written by the charter board.[193][194]\n\nPresident Johnson signed the National Foundation on the Arts and Humanities Act into law, creating the federally funded National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities.

Art is a nation's most precious heritage, for it is in our works of art that we reveal to ourselves, and to others, the inner vision which guides us as a nation. We in America have not always been kind to the artists and scholars who are the creators and the keepers of our vision. Somehow, the scientists always seem to get the penthouse, while the arts and the humanities get the basement.\" He closed by saying that the new law would \"bring active support to this great national asset, to make fresher the winds of art in this great land of ours. The arts and humanities belong to the people, for it is, after all, the people who created them.\"[195]\n\nThe Central Committee of China's Communist Party issued a statement in its official newspaper, Red Flag, saying that 16 years after the 1949 revolution, class struggle and inequality of income still existed in the People's Republic and that it \"at times is very acute\".
