        "text": "News\n\nentertainment\n\nhindi\n\nbollywood\n\nI came to Mumbai to achieve something and not to get married: Divya Khosla Kumar\n\nThis story is from December 8, 2013\n\nI came to Mumbai to achieve something and not to get married: Divya Khosla Kumar\n\nOver an hour-long conversation, Divya talks about her strong mother, her empathising mother-in-law and why she and Bhushan never talk about his father.\n\nDivya Khosla Kumar\n\nDivya Khosla Kumar, 25, considers herself more talented than pretty and uses her spectacles to hide her looks. She is simple, sensitive and strong, but loves being pampered by her husband Bhushan Kumar. She is inspired by the women in her life, be it her mother or mom-in-law and would like her hard-working husband to give her more undivided time. She is a dedicated mother to her two-year-old son Ruhaan and considers him the real producer of her upcoming film Yaariyan more than her husband, as he was always on the set with her. Over an hour-long conversation with TOI, she talks about her strong mother, her empathising mother-in-law and why she and Bhushan never talk about his father. Excerpts:\n\nHow did you become an actor?I was born and brought up in Delhi. My mom was a teacher and my dad owned a small printing press where we printed visiting cards. They have their own house now, but until I was in the 10th, we lived in a rented place. I was always very studious and intelligent. I once remember coming back and telling my mother that there was not even a single book left in the library that I had not read. Even though we were middle- class, my parents always got me what I wanted. The only regret I have is that I would always tell my papa to get me a cycle and he did not, so I donât know how to ride a cycle. I was very innocent and seedha-saadha and would never go out for parties and never had any boyfriends, even though half my school boys were after me. I was always clear that I did not want to let down my parents. I would get a lot of blank calls in my house and some boys would write letters in blood.\n\nI used to enjoy it, but my parents would feel bad. I was popular amongst boys, so girls never liked me. While doing my B.Com Honours, I started modelling at 18 for print ads. My mom, being from an army background, was okay with me modelling, even though my dad was not that comfortable. I was 20 when, despite everyone advising her against it, my mom allowed me to shift to Mumbai all alone. Even though I did not know a single person in Mumbai, I packed my bags and came here. My mom had this confidence that I would never do anything wrong in life. In my first year of living in Mumbai, I travelled in trains and changed seven PG accommodations as I had some very fast girls sharing my PG. Within my first year, I got a music video with Salman Khan. I also did a video with Abhijeet Bhattacharya. I first got a South film and auditioned to get my Bollywood break with Anil Sharmaâs Ab Tumhare Hawale Watan Sathiyo with Akshay Kumar , Bobby Deol and Mr Bachchan. That film released in December 2004 and by February 2005, I had got married to Bhushan Kumar.\n\nHow did you meet Bhushan?I met him at Anil Sharmaâs house as he was doing the music of that film. He started messaging and hounding me. Sometimes, I would get four messages before going into the shower and by the time I came out, there would be four more messages. He invited us for his sisterâs wedding in Delhi. My mom met him and liked him instantly for his humility and pushed me to get married to him. Despite his achievement, his innocence reflected on his face and I too liked that and I agreed to marry him.\n\nTalk about Bhushan?He is a very down-to-earth person, practical and very hard-working and I really admire the fact that he has dedicated his whole life to paying tribute to his father. He keeps so busy that till date, we have never had lunch or dinner together. Sometimes I tell him, âWhy canât you take an off?â As a wife, I am very adjusting and want to give him his freedom and let him live his life the way he wants to. I donât like that he doesnât take me on a holiday. I would like him to be more loving towards me. For instance, when we are at home, he will only talk about Yaariyan even at 11 at night and that irritates me. He will tell me, âBut it is your film I am talking about.â Even though it is my film, I cannot discuss it anymore. He is emotional, but will not show it. He is strong and I have never seen him cry till date. I cry at the drop of a hat though he doesn't like it. He has a temper, but the good thing is that he will make up soon after and will say, âI am so stressed, so please understand.â I also donât like to stretch things too far. If he is rude, it hurts me. On Karva Chauth, I was fasting for him and he said something very rudely to me in his room and it hurt me. I cried, but Iâm adjusting. He will never continue a fight and that is his quality. I think he likes my innocence, my honesty and simplicity.\n\nTalk about your mother?My source of inspiration are the women in my life. My mom has faced numerous adversities, but she is brave and I look up to her for the way she handled it. The kind of faith she has in God is amazing. My nani was an army manâs wife and ran her own jewellery business from home. I get my creativity from her. I also respect my mom-in-law a lot. She comes from a normal middle-class family and despite the fact that she did not know a word of English, she has risen so much and now she handles T-Series in Delhi. I like her more than I like Bhushan. As a woman, she is understanding and I discuss all my issues with her. I always tell her, âYou understand me more than my husband.â Itâs difficult to find mom-in-laws like that. I have always been a good daughter and try to be a good daughter-in-law and always listen to whatever she says. Both my mom and mom-in-law are strong women. I am too sensitive and have a long way to go vis-a-vis them.\n\nWho are you most attached to?My son. I can sleep without Bhushan, but I canât sleep without my son.\n\nDoes Bhushan ever discuss his father Gulshan Kumar with you?His father was a genius and it is not possible to be like him. Bhushan is nowhere close to his father. Post his fatherâs death, when he was 19, he changed his lifestyle and worked extremely hard. He doesnât talk about his father or show his feelings. And I donât touch upon it as it is a sensitive topic. I donât think he discusses it even with his mom. If there is something coming on TV about his father, I immediately look at his face and get troubled. His father was a visionary. His vision was also to grow T-Series into films and reach every house and that is what Bhushan wants to do and is his tribute to his father.\n\nWhy did you take to direction?I came here to achieve something in life and not to get married. I came here to satisfy my creative thirst. And I am really proud that I have made this film without assisting any director. Itâs a fact that the industry is shell-shocked seeing my trailer and they will be more shell-shocked when they see the film. My husband is also flying these days as he has seen the film. If he didnât like it, he would not promote it. Sometimes I feel very bad when people say, âOh, she is Bhushanâs wife and it must be so easy for herâ. But I want to say that it has been eight years since my marriage and had it not been difficult, it would not have taken me this much time to make a film. Itâs been a long struggle. After I married Bhushan, I felt that the best way to channelise my creativity would be to make a film. I did a course in cinematography from Mumbai because he did not want me to go away to New York, as he would then have to stay without me. Also, he did not want me to assist anyone, so I started doing editing at our office. One day I told him, âGive me a music video. I want to direct it.â He gave me Agam Nigamâs video (Sonu Nigamâs father) and I did it and it became a blockbuster hit. I then did many videos and landed up doing 20 of them before I got trained in direction and production.\n\nHow was it to work with Salman?Salman was very nice to work with. He is a very sweet person. He has gone through so many ups and downs that has made him strong and deep. He is a very good human being.\n\nWhat does Yaariyan mean to you?I am ambitious. And more than pretty, I consider myself talented. I would often hide my looks behind my specs. My son Ruhaan was on the set with me and he was just one when I started directing. Bhushan came for only four days during the shoot. So I feel that my son is the true producer of the film. Itâs difficult to be a mother and even tougher to be a director. I was doing both together. If it succeeds, it will not just be the success of the film, but of the principle that a girl without stooping down and compromising on her morals, keeping her dignity intact, can do it in this manâs world. And that if you are intelligent and talented, every woman can reach where she wants to. We women are stronger than men and need not feel insecure. Even if it takes longer, your destiny will always come to you. I consider myself Godâs child. I came to Mumbai to achieve my destiny and I have to achieve it with this film. There is no other way.\n\nEnd of Article\n\nFOLLOW US ON SOCIAL MEDIA\n\nVisual Stories\n\nIconic Bhojpuri songs that made waves this year\n\nEntertainment\n\n10 baby girl names inspired by Lord Shiva\n\nLifestyle\n\n10 inspiring quotes about love\n\nLifestyle\n\nJhanviâs weight loss Ragi Sweet Potato Paratha is a must-try for dinner\n\nFood\n\nLook at these rare photos of Kamal Haasan and Rajinikanth\n\nEntertainment\n\nâHistoric letters that shaped the worldâ\n\nLifestyle\n\n8 fiction books set in Ireland that should be on your TBR list\n\nLifestyle\n\nSawan 2024: 10 dishes prepared without onion & garlic for those who are fasting\n\nFood\n\n8 best herbs to grow in the kitchen garden\n\nLifestyle"
