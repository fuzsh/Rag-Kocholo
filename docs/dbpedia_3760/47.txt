A few quotes by Abhijit Banerjee

-- Poverty is not just a lack of money, it is not having the capability to realise one’s full potential as a human being.

-- We must arm ourselves with patience and wisdom and listen to the poor what they want. This is the best way to avoid the trap of ignorance, ideology and inertia on our side.

-- If the rules make such a difference, then it becomes very important who gets to make them.

-- The poor are no less rational than anyone else—quite the contrary. Precisely because they have so little, we often find them putting much careful thought into their choices: They have to be sophisticated economists just to survive.

-- The point is simple. Talking about the problems of the world without talking about some accessible solutions is the way to paralysis rather than progress.
