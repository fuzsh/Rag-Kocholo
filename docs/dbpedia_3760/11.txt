Summary

Teaching

In the past 5 years, in addition to Thesis and Dissertation courses, taught various graduate-level Directed Independent Study courses, COT 6930 Pattern Recognition, CAP 5615 Introduction to Neural Networks, CDA 6214 Structured VLSI Design, CDA 6422 Computer Design Automation, and CEN 5615 Computer Networks.

Developed 4 of these graduate courses for the department's curriculum.

Thesis/Dissertation Supervision

Supervised to completion 5 PhD Dissertation and 19 Master Theses, of which 1 PhD Dissertation and 13 Master Theses were supervised to completion over the past 5 years.

Currently supervising 2 PhD students and 12 Master students, and serving on several committees.

Sponsored Research

Received funding for 18 grants totaling approximately $3,500,000 (15 as Principal Investigator (PI) and 3 as Co-PI).

Over the past 5 years received funding for $3,000,000 for 8 grants (6 as PI, 2 as Co-PI ).

Helped co-found the Biometrics Research Group, which is funded by a sub-grant on a Federal Earmark funded by the Department of Defense.

Publications

Over 23 year academic career, published over 100 refereed publications: 3 books (authored), 9 book chapters, 32 refereed journal papers, 62 refereed conference proceeding papers.

Over the past 5 years, served on the editorial board of a new international engineering journal, published 16 journal and 19 refereed international conference papers.

Research Interests

Drug Discovery: Apply computational intelligence algorithms and pattern recognition techniques, including neural networks to identify the optimum drug compositions based on individual's genetic data. Study effects of combinational multi-component drug therapies.

Neural Circuitry: Study neural circuitry and build models of oscillatory neural networks with a disease specific treatment. e.g., tinnitus (ringing tone in the ear), aphasia etc. This project involves a multidisciplinary team including audiologists, physcians etc.
