He asked that I email this email address with my questions, so here goes.\n\nI saw on one of the tables a reference to the only Cumann na mBan woman to be killed by the Tans. I think the story was, they called for her brothers, they were not there, so they shot her instead. May I ask, what was the name of this lady, do you have any details on her story by any chance?\n\nAlso there was another leaflet or news item which referred to two pics of two boys, who were killed, was it in crossfire? I simply cannot recall any details, only that it was a document showing two pics, or two boys, who got killed. Any ideas what this was that I saw? What is the story here I wonder?\n\nWell I really hope you can help me.\n\nThanks again for bringing your display to Thurles.\n\nAll the very best\n\nCon McGrath\n\n————————————————————————————–\n\nRaymond M.

Sligo. Joined the IRB in Boston, returned home to fight in 1921. Allegedly was imprisoned in Mountjoy in 1922 or 23. Would love to know if he was arrested at the same time as Tommy Goff, also of Sligo, who was shot by IFS April 23 1923.\n\n————————————————————————————–\n\nEnclosed Pic of Christy Mackey, known in Rush Co Dublin as Kit. He was a member of old IRA North Dublin. His years 1899 to 1979. He remained single and lived with his brothers Paddy and Jim and sister Mary Jo who was Postmistress there for many years. They run a butchery in rush village but Kit or Christy had a greenhouse at the back of their house in the Mall. I did temporary relief at the post office in about 1971 and remained a visitor at Mackey’s for several years.\n\nMary Jo told me that Christy was on the run for a good while. I guess until things got resolved. During my time visiting Christy used have an outside concrete seat which he painted green, white and orange. i never thought to take a photo of it. This pic used hang over his bed. For a time one could get their portrait taken and later get a coloured one. before my last time, I asked Mary Jo if I could get a copy of it because I held a grea affection for him. John Buckley was reared at the Mall and got the dwelling house. I am telling you this in case this pic is not good enough. I found John Buckley to be very agreeable.\n\nYours sincerely, Ellen Hanna.\n\nIrish Volunteers Organisation <info@irishvolunteers.org>wrote:\n\nFrom: info@irishvolunteers.org\n\nSent: Monday, November 17, 2014 4:52 PM\n\nTo: info@irishvolunteers.org\n\nSubject: A comment from Ellen Hanna\n\na form has been submitted on November 17, 2014, via: http://irishvolunteers.org/contact/ [IP 109.76.186.235]\n\nYour default form\n\nYour Name Ellen Hanna\n\nEmail ellenhanna1@yahoo.ie\n\nWebsite http://\n\nMessage I have got a colour picture of Christopher Mackey, Rush, Co Dublin, in uniform wearing leather belt of republican army.\n\nhe is buried in Whitestown cemetery Rush Co Dublin 1979\n\n————————————————————————————–\n\n————————————————————————————–\n\n: sbinashui@gmail.com\n\nURL :\n\nWhois : http://whois.arin.net/rest/ip/194.165.189.66\n\nComment:\n\nI’d love to know if anyone has any information or photos relating to Sean/Jack O’Leary, of the 1st Battalion in Tipperary.

It’s my belief that this is in fact my great grandfather Thomas Heeley.\n\nWhat do I know?: I know that he was garrisoned at Marrowbone Lane Distillery and that there is also very little information relating to him. I have read through the records submitted by some of the combatants at Marrowbone Land Distillery and the South Dublin Union to the Bureau of Irish Military History and there is no mention of him either. There is also no mention of him being at Frongoch or even on the Dublin Census of 1911 although there is a Canty family living at 28.1 Marrowbone Lane at the time of the Rising. The only Thomas Cantys I can find on the 1911 census are living in Kerry or Cork. It would strike me as being strange for a Kerry/Cork volunteer to come to Dublin to partake in the rising, but be stationed at an outpost. It is however possible that one of these country Cantys might have been related to the said Canty family on Marrowbone Lane at the time, but I find it unlikely. There also seems to be considerable doubt over the correct surname for this volunteer.\n\nWhy?: It’s my belief that this Thomas Canty or Casty was in fact my great grandfather Thomas Heeley who lived at 99.1 Cork Street at the time, which is/was only a 5 minute walk from the voluteer garrison. His Father and step brothers and sister were English born and his Irish born brother (James) was a chauffeur for British generals on the Somme at the time of the Rising. I believe that he used a variation or pseudonym of his Irish born mother’s surname (Cantwell) in order to protect the family name Heeley. I also think he got away before the official surrender of the volunteers of Marrowbone Lane as it has been recorded that Con Colbert stated that anyone not in uniform should try and escape. Eventually Ceantt on hearing this stopped it, but some of the combatants had already got away.\n\nIt’s my belief that this Thomas Canty or Casty was in fact my great grandfather Thomas Heeley who lived at 99.1 Cork Street at the time, which is/was only a 5 minute walk from the voluteer garrison.

There was a massive divide in the family due to father (Robert), the step-brothers and sister being English. The step-brothers and sisters actually moved back to England at some stage between the 1901 and 1911 censuses.\n\nAny insight or info you can give me on this Thomas Canty or Casty would be much appreciated.\n\nRegards,\n\nColin.\n\n————————————————————————————–\n\ntambmz@hotmail.com>\n\nSubject: james sniper cassidy\n\nMessage Body:\n\nim trying to find information or any old photographs of my grandfather james sniper cassidy who originated from the bone in belfast. the only information i have been able to obtain is from the book NORTHERN COMMAND, i would be very gratefull if you could help.
