        "text": "Mr O’Brien had been travelling on a bus in Aldwych, London, when the explosives went off.\n\nSinn Féin councillor Fionntán Ó Súilleabháin announced the cancellation of the online event, which was due to mark the 25th anniversary of Mr O’Brien’s death.\n\n“The Edward O’Brien online commemoration, which was organised by Ed’s father Miley and supported by Sinn Féin, has been cancelled at the request of family, due to significant online abuse targeting the family,” he said.\n\nThe event was due to go ahead on Facebook on Thursday.\n\nWhen questioned whether the event was supported by the party and whether they supported the cancellation of the online commemoration, a Sinn Féin spokesperson echoed what councillor Ó Súilleabháin had said on Facebook.\n\nHowever, they stated the event was supported by “Wexford Sinn Féin.”\n\nThe online commemoration for Edward O’Brien, which was organised by Edward’s father Miley and supported by Wexford Sinn Féin, was cancelled at the request of the family due to significant online abuse targeting the family in recent days.\n\nThe event was understood to have been promoted by Councillor Ó Súilleabháin and other local party members.\n\nIn the Dáil, Tánaiste Leo Varadkar condemned Sinn Fein for supporting the commemoration, describing it as “deeply offensive\". He called on Sinn Féin to disassociate itself from the event and to condemn the bomb incident.\n\n“This is a deeply offensive commemoration,\" he said.\n\nAfter his death, Mr O’Brien’s family issued a statement through their solicitor condemning all paramilitary organisations.\n\nIt was understood that they had no knowledge of his involvement with the IRA, believing that he was working on a building site in the UK until gardaí called to their home to notify them of his death.\n\nThe explosion, which could reportedly be heard five miles away, came just nine days after the IRA ended its ceasefire with a bombing at Canary Wharf, in the Docklands area of London, which killed two people.\n\nA BBC report from the day of the blast, in which Mr O’Brien died, said that 10 ambulances, five fire engines and four paramedic units were called to the scene.\n\nAnother Irish man, Brendan Woolhead, from Swords, Co Dublin, was injured in the blast. Mr Woolhead wasn’t connected to Mr O’Brien, and his name had been cleared after initially being a suspect. The driver of the bus was left permanently deaf, according to reports at the time."
