        "text": "March 1923 witnessed levels of barbarity and suffering previously unseen in the first eight months of the conflict. This post sets out in chronological order events that led up to, and occurred, in County Kerry in the early days of March 1923. The only intention of this post is to highlight material within the MSPC and how the collection can shed light on some of the darkest events of the Civil War.\n\n18/19 December 1922 – Raid on the home of Patrick O’Connor, Knockanatee, County Kerry.\n\nAccording to the statement of Lieutenant Clifford an IRA member named John Buckley, dressed in the uniform of a National Army Officer, called to the home of Patrick O’Connor (senior) and received information about the location of IRA hide outs. Buckley later returned with a party of IRA members and raided the home of the items listed below. Patrick O’Connor’s son, the Reverend M O’Connor claimed the reason for the raid on the family home was as a result of Patrick (junior) refusing to join the IRA.\n\n1 January 1923\n\nPatrick O’Connor (junior) attested to the National Army and joined the 19 Battalion, Dublin Guards under the command of Patrick O’Daly.\n\nMarch 1923 – Anonymous letter received at Castleisland.\n\nAn anonymous letter was received at the post at Castleisland detailing the location of an arms dump. Note that the date of 26 March 1923 referenced for the anonymous letter must be an error.\n\n6 March 1923 – 5 National Army killed at Knocknagoshel, one injured.\n\nHaving decided to act on the tip off, a party of National Army troops left Castleisland at 01:40 and proceeded to Knocknagoshel arriving at 03:45. According to the statement of Sergeant Matthews he was told to remain with the Crossley tender along with two Privates at Talbot Bridge while the rest of the party made a search of Baranarig Wood for the arms dump.\n\nThe five men killed at Knocknagoshel were;\n\n1. Lieutenant O’Connor, Patrick (3D58)\n\n2.Private O’Connor, Laurence (3D57)\n\n3. Captain Dunne, Michael (3D164)\n\n4. Captain Stapleton, Edward (3D70)\n\n5. Private Gallivan, Michael (3D137)\n\nA sixth, Joseph O’Brien (4P66) was severely wounded resulting in the amputation of his legs.\n\n7 March 1923 – 8 IRA killed at Ballyseedy, one injured.\n\nOn the night of 6 March, several IRA prisoners in Ballymullen Barracks, Tralee were interrogated, tortured and beaten by National Army officers. In the early hours of the morning of 7 March, nine men were selected by Colonel David Neligan (24SP7492) and Major General Paddy O’Daly (24SP424) and put in a military lorry which drove to Balyseedy Cross (about 4km away).\n\nThe IRA prisoners were bound hand and foot and roped together in a circle around a mine buried beneath a log and pile of stones. It is claimed that the mine had been constructed in Ballymullen Barracks by Jim Clarke and Captain Edward Flood (24SP2302) of the Dublin Guards. At Ballyseedy Cross, it was allegedly detonated by Commandant Edmund (Ned) Breslin (24SP1301) of the Dublin Guards.\n\nSeven of the nine men were from Kerry. Patrick Buckley was born in Tournafula, County Limerick while John O’Connor had grown up in Innishannon, County Cork. Eight of the prisoners were serving with 1 Kerry Brigade, IRA at the time of their capture while John O’Connor was attached to the 1 Cork Brigade, IRA and Liverpool Battalion, IRA.\n\nEight men died in the explosion. Their company and battalion units are listed where known:\n\n1. Buckley, Patrick (2RB139)\n\n2. Connell, Michael (DP6068) – Castleisland Coy, 7 Btn\n\n3. Daly, John (DP51) – 7 Btn\n\n4. Hartnett, Patrick (DP9533) – Finuge Coy, 6 Btn\n\n5. O’Connor, John (DP4098) – Innishannon Coy, 1 Btn, 1 Cork Bde & Liverpool Btn, IRA\n\n6. O’Shea, George (DP6572) – Kilflynn Coy, 3 Btn\n\n7. Tuomey, Timothy (DP5819) – Kilflynn Coy, 3 Btn\n\n8. Walsh, James (DP4728) – Churchill Coy, 9 Btn\n\nOne man survived:\n\n9. Fuller, Stephen (MSP34REF6759) – Kilflynn Coy, 3 Btn.\n\nThe National Army put out their own version of events suggesting that the men were removing an IRA barricade blocking the road when a hidden mine exploded. This sequence of events was repeated by the families of the victims when applying for compensation just over three months after the event:\n\n7 March 1923 – 4 IRA killed at Countess Bridge, one injured.\n\nOf those killed or injured at Countess Bridge all were members of 2 Kerry Brigade, IRA. Similarly to Ballyseedy it is only due to the survivor, Tadg Coffey that we learn of what happened. Coffey had been arrested on 22 February 1923 and beaten by National Army troops. He states that on 7 March he and four others were ordered to remove a barricade which exploded. Coffey despite his injuries managed to escape.\n\nJJ Rice wrote in his reference of Coffey’s escape “he was not [stunned] by the explosion…but got to his feet and ran about two hundred yards along the open road under machine gun and rifle fire”.\n\nLieutenant Buckley, Stephen (DP878)\n\nQuartermaster Donoghue, Daniel (DP739)\n\nPrivate O’Donoghue, Jeremiah (DP3621) – F Company, 4 Btn\n\nPrivate Murphy, Timothy (DP8168)\n\nWounded Private Coffey, Tadg (MSP34REF23009) – A Company, 4 Btn\n\n12 March 1923 – 5 IRA killed at Cahersiveen.\n\nFive IRA prisoners taken from the workhouse which operated as a temporary Military Barracks at Cahersiveen. Again the men were taken for the purpose of removing a barricade which contained a mine about half a mile from the workhouse on the road to Cahersiveen.\n\nPrivate Courtney, Michael (DP2261) – ASU, 3 Kerry Brigade\n\nPrivate Sugrue, John (DP7845)- 3 Kerry Brigade\n\nPrivate Dwyer, Eugene (DP3816) – 3 Kerry Brigade\n\nPrivate Reardon, William (DP3844) – ASU, 3 Kerry Brigade\n\nLieutenant Shea, Daniel (DP2588) – A Company, 3 Btn, 3 Kerry Brigade\n\n24 March 1923 IRA Private Daniel Murphy killed at Ballyduff, Knocknagoshel.\n\nMurphy, a blacksmith by trade had been a member of the Irish Volunteers from 1917. It was alleged that he had been responsible for making the mine that had been used at Knocknagoshel. The file however, states that the Murphy family “were strong supporters of the Government”.\n\nThe files also reveal some of the harrowing experiences of women in the aftermath of the attacks at Ballyseedy in relation to the recovery and preparation of the bodies. While the seven names below are not a complete list, their testimony demonstrates the trauma and lasting impact of such events."
