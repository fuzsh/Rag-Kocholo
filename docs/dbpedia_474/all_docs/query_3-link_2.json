Edward O'Brien (1823-1877)\n\nEdward O'Brien was an esteemed war hero who fought in the Mexican War of 1846 and later served as Colonel of the 134th Pennsylvania Volunteers during the United States Civil War. He was born in Pittsburgh on October 10, 1823. His father, Thomas O'Brien, came to America from Ireland when he was very young and worked for several years as a contractor. He married Elizabeth Conway, a native of Delaware, and the couple had three children: Edward, Mary, and Thomas, the first two being twins. Edward's father died at 35 years of age, and his mother moved with her family to New Castle and became the wife of Charles Kelly. At age 15, Edward O'Brien returned to Pittsburgh to enter into an apprenticeship to the moulders' trade with Bollman & Garrison. This became his primary employment.\n\nIn June 1846, O'Brien enlisted for the Mexican War through a company in Pittsburgh called the \"Irish Greens\". He was present at the siege of Vera Cruz, the battle of Cerro Gordo, the engagement at the Pass of La Hoya, the storming of Chapultepec, and the storming of Gartia deVelen, the last of which led to an injury in his left eye. At the end of the Mexican War, O'Brien was commissioned Second Lieutenant of his company by Governor William F. Johnson.\n\nIn 1861, O'Brien married Miss Theresa B. O'Donnell of New Castle. The following day, he set out to fight in the Civil War as Captain of Company F, 12th Pennsylvania Volunteer Infantry, for three months' service, and was stationed near Baltimore. His regiment was mustered out of service in August. In July 1862, in response to a call from Governor Curtin, Captain O'Brien recruited Company D of the 134th Pennsylvania Volunteers for nine months' service, and the soldiers were mustered in and equipped for duty near Harrisburg. Upon the advance of the rebels toward Washington in the second Bull Run campaign, his regiment was sent to Arlington Heights to complete its organization, and Captain O'Brien was chosen as Lieutenant-Colonel. The regiment was brigaded with the 91st, 126th, and 129th Pennsylvania Regiments under the command of General E. B. Tyler. In December, Lieutenant-Colonel O'Brien was promoted to Colonel in place of Colonel Quay, who resigned due to poor health.\n\nOn the 13th of December, the Battle of Fredericksburg opened, and Colonel O'Brien's regiment held the post of honor in the brigade to the right of the first line. O'Brien's brother, Thomas O'Brien, was killed in this same battle. May 1, 1863 marked the beginning of the Battle of Chancellorsville, which saw the severest struggle of Colonel O'Brien's military career including several narrow escapes from death. He was mustered out of service with his regiment at Harrisburg on May 26, 1865. His wife Theresa had remained with him during his entire term of service, fully enduring the hardships of camp aside from brief absences during times of battle.\n\nOn February 2, 1866, O'Brien lost his left eye in an explosion in the foundry of R. W. Cunningham in New Castle, Pennsylvania.\n\nOver the years, Colonel O'Brien began to brood increasingly over financial matters. It became apparent to friends and relatives that he was quite depressed, and in the summer of 1877 he was sent to Dixmont Hospital for treatment. During his time there his condition only worsened, and he eventually took to his bed until his death on July 10. He was buried in New Castle in the Catholic Cemetary of St. Mary's Church on Wednesday, July 12, 1877. Mr. and Mrs. Colonel O'Brien had seven children: Victor, Regina, Marcus, Leo, Edward, Elizabeth, and Tommy, who died in infancy. Upon the death of Mrs. O'Brien in 1883, the children were put under the care of relatives James and Mary Flynn until arrangements could be made for Elizabeth, the youngest, to be placed at the Villa Marie Convent in Lawrence County, Pennsylvania.\n\nScope and Content Notes\n\nThe Edward O'Brien papers are housed in one archival box, and items are grouped according to the individual to whom each is most relevant. Folders are arranged by generation, beginning with Edward O'Brien and wife and ending with information about his children and relatives. Three folders are dedicated to O'Brien's children collectively because many items relate to several of them. The collection includes correspondence, diaries, scrapbooks, published items, and limited genealogical materials. It focuses largely on the military career and subsequent prestige of Colonel Edward O'Brien during the United States Civil War. Several articles are included about the post-war Reception of the 134th Regiment, the Farewell speech of Colonel O'Brien, his death and funeral in 1877, and the unveiling of a monument constructed in his honor. Of particular significance is the diary of O'Brien's wife, Theresa O'Brien, which is missing pages but is relatively complete between the dates of September 4 and October 19, 1862, during the time in which she traveled along with her husband's regiment. Her writing focuses mainly on the day-to-day occurrences of camp life as well as the anxiety with which she awaits her husband's return from battle. She writes often of ill or wounded soldiers who must struggle to regain health under harsh conditions, and at the time her writing leaves off she herself is struggling with illness. Also remaining is part of an entry written by Mrs. O'Brien sixteen years later, addressed to her now-deceased husband, in which she expresses great distress over his death.\n\nThe collection also includes handwritten reports from O'Brien, General Humphrey, and General E. B. Tyler describing the performance of the 134th Regiment in the Battle of Fredericksburg. General biographical material about O'Brien is included, but details of his life outside of the military are sparse. Little is known of O'Brien's wife aside from her writing.\n\nA significant portion of the published items and personal correspondence included in the collection relates to O'Brien's children. In particular, several articles are present about Victor O'Brien's success as a traveling piano salesman. The few articles about Leo O'Brien focus mainly on his social popularity in Homestead as well as his involvement in local chapters of the Pennsylvania Elks and the Knights of Columbus. Also included is an article about the marriage of his youngest daughter Elizabeth (\"Lizzie\") to Walter Coffee, and a series of letters regarding Elizabeth's attempts to secure pension relief on account of her father's military service. The other four children are mentioned only briefly in correspondence in which Mary MacNiven attempts to gain information about the O'Brien lineage from distant relatives.\n\nInformation is also provided about John Donaghy, a cousin of Elizabeth O'Brien Coffee. Donaghy was Captain of Company F of the 103rd Regiment and later became a prominent artist in Pittsburgh. Biographical material is included that focuses heavily on Donaghy's artistic accomplishments. The collection also contains a history of the 103rd Regiment, including excerpts from Donaghy's book, \"Army Experience,\" in which he recounts his experiences in the Civil War.\n\nArrangement\n\nThe Edward O'Brien papers are housed in one archival box, and items are grouped according to the individual to whom each is most relevant. Folders are arranged by generation, beginning with Edward O'Brien and wife and ending with information about his children and relatives. A single folder is dedicated to O'Brien's children because many items relate to several of them.\n\nConditions Governing Access\n\nThis collection is open for research.\n\nImmediate Source of Acquisition\n\nThese items came in two accessions in 1997.\n\nAcc#1997.0073, 1997.0366 Gift of Mary McNiven.\n\nPreferred Citation\n\nPapers of Edward O'Brien and Family, 1862-1980, bulk 1862-1932, MSS#390, Historical Society of Western Pennsylvania.\n\nProcessing Information\n\nThis collection was processed by Heather Lucas on May 29, 2003.\n\nRevision and rearrangement for the encoded version of the finding aid provided by Heather Lucas on June 6, 2003.\n\nConditions Governing Use\n\nProperty rights reside with the Historical Society of Western Pennsylvania.
