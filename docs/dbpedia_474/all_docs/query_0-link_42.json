        "text": "Ireland has spawned a homegrown terroristic organization with several names. It was first known as the IRB, or Irish Republican Brotherhood. It was then transformed into the IRA, or Irish Republican Army. The IRA splintered to create the Official IRA (OIRA), the Provisional IRA (PIRA), the Real IRA (RIRA), and the Continuity IRA (CIRA) (Zalman, 2016). The IRA's political wing is entitled Sinn Féin (Zalman, 2016). The United States and the United Kingdom have both defined the IRA, and its splinter groups, as proscribed terrorist organizations, while Ireland labels them as only an illegal organization (Bureau of Counterterrorism, n.d.). The Real IRA and the Continuity IRA remain on the European Union and the U.S. State Departments list of terrorist groups (Gregory, 2010). The IRA has been quite successful with their tactics and gaining some of what they require. Their fight has resulted in Ireland gaining control over a majority, 26 counties, of their country.\n\nThis article seeks to answer the question of who were the women of the Provisional IRA and to assess any demographic patterns of PIRA involvement. We use a multi-method approach to describe the many roles and functions of female members of the Provisional Irish Republican Army from 1970 to 1998. Drawing on a sample of 61 convicted or deceased PIRA members, we outline the shifting socio-demographic and operation profile of these women and how structural, tactical and strategic needs of PIRA accounted for those changes. Women in the Provisional IRA played crucial operational roles throughout the period both front-line and behind the scenes. From the outset of the conflict, women consistently took part in violent operations. We also provide a historical case study of Mairéad Farrell's PIRA career to provide further illustrations of these themes in greater detail.\n\nThe emergence of the Northern Ireland conflict in 1969 saw the birth of a terrorist organisation that successfully used guerrilla warfare tactics to kill and terrorise many of its victims. The Provisional IRA went on to kill more people than any other combatant involved in the violence in Northern Ireland. This dissertation will focus on the evolution of the Provisional IRA from their birth in 1969 to their peak of capacity, reached in the summer of 1972 with their decline beginning after Operation Motorman."
