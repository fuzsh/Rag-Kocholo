Elected a Representative Peer for Ireland, April 1873.\n\nFrom The Times, 10 April 1900\n\nLord Inchiquin, in the peerage of Ireland, died last night at his residence, Dromoland Castle, County Clare, after a few weeks' illness, at the age of 61. He was the 14th Baron, and was an Irish Baronet. Lord Inchiquin was a representative peer of Ireland and Lieutenant of County Clare, for which he was High Sheriff in 1862. He married, in 1862, the Hon. Emily Holmes-a'Court, second daughter of the second Baron Heytesbury, who died in 1868. His second marriage, with the Hon. Ellen Harriet, daughter of the second Baron Annaly, took place in 1874. He is succeeded by his son from his first marriage, the Hon. Lucius William O'Brien, formerly State steward to the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, who married, in 1896, Ethel Jane, eldest daughter of Johnston J. Foster, of Moor Park, Ludlow, and Cliffe Hill, Lightcliffe. Our Dublin Correspondent telegraphed last night:- In view of the Queen's presence in Ireland, it is interesting to note that the late Lord Inchiquin, as head of the historic house of O'Brien, was the only representative in the direct line now in the peerage of any native Irish family who held Royal rank. Lord Inchiquin was extremely popular among all classes in his native county, and was a large employer of labour on his estate at Dromoland. Until quite recently, he took an active part in local affairs, and was for many years chairman of the Ennis Board of Guardians. He was disqualified by his rank from serving on the grand jury, but his advice and opinions were always at the service of and always gratefully received by that body. By his own express wish the funeral will be conducted as privately and as simply as possible.\n\nNoted events in his life were:\n\n1. He appeared on the census in 1841 in Clarendon Place, Leamington Priors, Warwickshire.\n\n2. Census UK 1871: 1871, 9 Devonshire Terrace, Paddington, London.\n\n3. Census UK 1881: 1881, Hereford House, Westminster, London.\n\nEdward married Emily Holmes à Court, daughter of William Henry Ashe à Court, 2nd Baron Heytesbury and Elizabeth Worsley Holmes, on 21 August 1862 in Heytesbury, Wiltshire.128 (Emily Holmes à Court was born on 14 September 1842 in Westover, Isle of Wight, died on 3 January 1868 in Quarrwood Lodge, Ryde, Isle Of Wight and was buried in January 1868 in Calbourne, Isle of Wight.)\n\nEdward next married Ellen Harriet White, daughter of Luke White, 2nd Baron Annaly and Unknown, on 29 January 1874 in St. Paul's, Knightsbridge, London. (Ellen Harriet White was born in 1855 in Amyand House, Twickenham, Middlesex, died on 2 March 1913 in 59 Sloane Street, Chelsea, London and was buried on 5 March 1913 in Brookwood Crematorium.)"
