Since the great Age of Exploration in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, the encounters between the Old World and the New have determined the course of history, culture, and politics for billions of people. The destinies of Europe, Africa, North and South America, and all the islands in between have been intertwined to the extent that none of those areas can be said to exist in isolation. Out of these interconnections comes the concept of the \"Atlantic world,\" which Alan Karras describes in his introductory essay to Britain and the Americas in this series: \"By looking at the Atlantic world as a single unit, rather than relying upon more traditional national (such as Britain) or regional (such as North or South America) units of analysis, scholars have more nearly been able to re- create the experiences of those who lived in the past.\" This perspective attempts to redefine and respond to expanding (one might say globalizing) pressures and new ways of perceiving interconnections-not only those rooted in history (\"the past\") but also those that are ongoing. Just one result of this conceptual redefinition has been the emergence of Transatlantic Studies as an area of enquiry in its own right, growing from the soil of separate area studies, whether European, North American, African, Caribbean, or Latin American. Students and scholars working in Transatlantic Studies are embarked on a new course of scholarship that places the transatlantic dynamic at its heart. In this spirit, the Transatlantic Relations Series is devoted to transcending, or at least challenging, the boundaries of nation/region as well as discipline: we are concerned in this series not only with history but also with culture and politics, race and economics, gender and migration; not only with the distant past but also with this morning. The aim, in a phrase, is to explore the myriad connections and interconnections of the Atlantic world. However, while the Atlantic world concept challenges the isolation of smaller, national perspectives, nations do continue to exist, with boundaries both physical and conceptual. Thus this series acknowledges the intractability of the national and the regional while consistently focusing on the transcending movements-the connections and interconnections-that go beyond the national and the regional. Our mode of operation has been to build an approach to the Atlantic world through attention to the separate vectors between the nations and regions on both sides of the Atlantic. We do this through offering the six titles within the series so far commissioned, devoted, respectively, to Africa, Britain, France, Germany, Iberia, and Ireland in their engagements with the Americas. In each case, the transatlantic exchanges are those of all kinds: cultural, political, and historical, from the moment of first contact to the present day. With that organizing principle in mind, the object is to offer an accessible, precisely focused means of entry into the various portals of the Atlantic world. Finally, a word about the origins of this series. In 1995, Professor Terry Rodenberg of Central Missouri State University invited scholars and teachers from eighteen universities on both sides of the Atlantic to establish an educational and scholarly institution devoted to encouraging a transatlantic perspective. The result was the founding of the Maastricht Center for Transatlantic Studies (MCTS), located in the Dutch city whose name, through its eponymous treaty, resonates with transnational associations. Since its foundation, MCTS has continued to bring together students and scholars from a host of worldwide locations to explore the intricate web of Atlantic connections across all disciplines: it has been a dynamic encounter between cultures and people striving to transcend the limitations of separate area and disciplinary studies. I am pleased to acknowledge the extent to which the Transatlantic Relations Series grows out of the discussions and approaches articulated at MCTS. Therefore, while the separate titles in the series will carry their own dedications, the series as a whole is dedicated with great respect to Terry Rodenberg and the students and scholars at Maastricht. Will Kaufman University of Central Lancashire Maastricht Center for Transatlantic Studies Editor's Preface Defined by the online Encarta Dictionary as \"a reference work offering comprehensive information on all or specialized areas of knowledge,\" an encyclopedia strives towards a form of inclusiveness that is ultimately unachievable in real terms. To provide even brief descriptions of all of the cultural, political, and historical figures from across the Americas who have had Irish connections would be an impossible task, not least because of the vast number of personalities involved - many of whom are \"undocumented\" - but also because \"Irish- American relations\" are currently being re-conceived by scholars of diasporic identities and area studies on both sides of the Atlantic. This work has benefited from the contributions of many individuals working in these and other fields, but in the same way that the process of defining the \"Irish-American\" experience remains the subject of intense debate and sometimes controversial negotiation, this work is also open-ended insofar as it aims to suggest pathways for further study, conversation, and research, and does not represent a \"final\" or \"conclusive\" statement in itself. It goes further than existing accounts of Irish-American relations in terms of its broadening of the scope of inquiry beyond the United States of America to include Canada and Latin American countries such as Argentina and Brazil, but this opening up of the field represents a first step towards a re-description of the multi-faceted roles played by the Irish in the Western hemisphere. For all of its tentativeness, however, it is a small step that demonstrates the profound influence the Irish have had far beyond the European frame of reference. The editors wish to thank all of those who contributed to the writing of these volumes - for their patience and goodwill - and the following individuals in particular: David Doyle, Andrew Goodspeed, Benjamin Keatinge, Maureen Mulvihill, Edmundo Murray, and Gwenda Young. Wendy Roseth and Alex Mikaberidze are also to be thanked for their efficient and patient assistance at various stages of the work's development. The editors wish to thank the Series Editor, Will Kaufman, and all of those behind the scenes at ABC-CLIO who provided essential help along the way. James P.
