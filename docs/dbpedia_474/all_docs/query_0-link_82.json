His master was present at the examination, and gave the prisoner a character which weighed with the bench in mitigation the punishment which his offence of absconding from his labour, must otherwise have drawn upon him but as it was necessary at the same time by example to deter others from similar misdeeds, he was sentenced to one hundred lashes.\n\n14 January 1802 Freemans Journal - By the Lord Lieutenant and Council of Ireland, A Proclamation\n\nRe: Thomas Neale of Ballinapierce\n\n1804 Mary Tracey, Rathholm, Ballybrennan.

Mr. Burroughs, who stated the case for the Crown, declared the object of the Prosecution was not so much to inflict a heavy punishment upon the offender, as to shew those who are principally concerned in the Tolls and Customs of Waterford, that the abuses and extortions which have of late been so much complained of, and improperly sanctioned, the respectable Body of the Merchants, who were in fact the Prosocutors in the present instance, had determined by every legal means to redress; and he trusted that the event of the Prosecution would serve as an example to prevent a repetition of such offences; and it appeared, besides the extortion, that the poor woman had upwards of 16 of her eggs broken, and one of the fowls killed.--Lynagn was found guilty upon the clearest testimony-he was sentenced to one week's imprisonment. The Traverser produced no witnesses, and was not defended by any Counsel or Agent, being totally deserted by those for whom he was employed, or acted.\n\n1 Dec 1810 Canadian military service - Description of men of the 2nd Battalion\n\nCornelius Treacy, 19, 5'7\", born abt 1791 Ballynageragh Kerry, volunteer from Kerry Militia, weaver, fresh complexion, dark hair, long face, grey eyes, enlisted Wexford\n\nJohn Treacy, 22, 5'8.25\", born abt 1788 Ballynageragh Kerry, volunteer from Kerry Militia, tailor, fair complexion, d brown hair, oral face, grey eyes, enlisted Wexford\n\n1817 from Wexford and Carlow, 5,500 Emigrants (c. 1,000 families) to Canada (British North America),\n\n935 Ml Tracy 4\n\nBurial without Coffins. -- correspondent of Notes and Queries (London), June 7th, 1856, page 455, who signed himself E.C., Wexford, wrote as follows : I beg to say that here the fact (of burying without coffins) although now totally obsolete, is known to have existed. In the Barony of Forth, the celebrated Anglo-Norman colony planted in the days of Strongbow, is situated the Church of Lady's Isle, formerly the Lough Derg of the South of Ireland, as a pilgrimage, and therefore frequented from all parts. I have heard from credit-worthy persons in my early days that they remembered bodies having been brought from great distances to be buried there, who had made it a dying request to be buried in the Lady's Isle without a coffin, the coffin to be left in the ruins of the old church for the use of the first person requiring one. This was always looked on by the people of the locality as an act of humiliation and devotion on the part of the deceased, but was not a general custom, nor is it in tradition as having ever been imitated in any of the burial places of the Barony.\n\nIn the graveyard of the Augustinian Abbey of St. John, near Enniscorthy, in the Barony of Scarawalsh, I learn that the following custom of burial was observed until about the year 1818, by certain families, named Tracey and their connexions, the Doyles, the Dalys, and others, of the townland of Croan and adjoining. The body being brought to the graveyard in a well made coffin, the friends assembled around, and the face was uncovered in order that they might take a farewell look at the loved departed. The body was then taken from the coffin and laid in the grave with great care, and at each end was raised a course of stone work, without mortar, 18 or 30 inches high, according to circumstances. Much attention was paid to providing tough green sods cut from the adjoining alluvial bank of the river Slaney, and several of them about 7 feet long and 2 wide, each being well rolled up were conveyed to the graveyard, and with them the grave was carefully and neatly lined from bottom to top, one the head of the grave being laid lengthwise over the ends of the others. In this green chamber was strewn moss in the season, dry grass and flowers, and a pillow of the same supported the head of the corpse when laid on this its last earthly bed. One or more stout plants were then placed longitudinally and, the green sods of the sides turned over and downwards, completed all but the filling in the usual way with the clay. The mound being covered with the original green sods of the grave prayers were said without any keening or any wailing but the feeling what natural grief gave utterance to. A particular solemnity is said to have marked every occasion of this kind.\n\nThe last person at whose funeral this form was observed was named John Doyle, who was a bachelor, but all his friends since have conformed to the custom of the neighbourhood, and use coffins. J.C.\n\nJournal of the South-East of Ireland Archaeological Society Volune 15\n\nDown to about half a century since, the families of Tracy, Doyle and Daly, with their connexions, whose burial-place was the graveyard of the Prioy of St. John, about a mile south of Enniscorthy, in the county of Wexford, buried their dead without coffins: the corpse being brought to the grave in a well-made coffin, and the grave being carefully lined with fresh green sods, the body, wrapped solely in its winding-sheet, was placed therin, the head being supported by a pillow of dried grass and moss; more sods, supported by planks, were placed over it, with the grassy side down, and the grave was then filled in as usual.  See Wexford Independent of May 3, 1856.\n\nUrban, Sylvanus (1857) The Gentlemans Magazine and Historical Review. Vol III. P.608n. John Henry & James Parker, London.\n\nSingular Burial Custom near Enniscorthy\n\nIn the grave-yard of the old Priory Church of St. John, near Enniscorthy (Kilcarberry) was observed, until about 1825, a singular burial custom, rarely, if ever met elsewhere. Three families in comfortable circumstances, named Tracey, Doyle and Daly, with others their connections buried their dead here without coffins. The bodies being brought in a well made coffin to the edge of the grave, the friends assembled around, and the body - the face for a few moments being uncovered in order to take their last look at the lamented departed was laid in the grave, previously prepared with great care. The grave was made more than six feet deep and long to suit the purpose  and at each end a course of stone-work, without mortar, was raised over two feet high. Much care was given to providing a tough green sod, cut about seven feet long, and about two wide, from the alluvial banks of the Slaney. Several of these being rolled up, were conveyed to the grave-yard, and the grave then neatly lined with them and covering the bottom. The grave thus presented a smooth green appearance  dry grass and some flowers were strewn thickly in it, and a pillow of the same raised the head as it were in bed. The corpse in its simple, but ample winding-sheet, was then removed from the coffin, and laid in its last resting place, the grave  a stout plank or two was then placed length-ways from the stonework at head and foot, but not touching the body, and the green sods, the grass downwards, carefully folded over all. The grave was then filled in the usual manner, and covered with the ordinary green sod, whilst the coffin was left for the use of the first poor person who might require it. No coinin was ever practiced, or lamination beyond the suppression of the workings of natural grief. The last ceremony of this kind we can hear of having taken place here, was at the funeral of John Doyle of Craan, but since this time his family and the others who had observed their custom, have conformed to the forms and usages of their neighbours, and bury in coffins. No tradition of the origin of the custom now survives.\n\nGriffiths, George (1877) The chronicles of the county of Wexford to 1877, Enniscorthy.\n\n1 May 1822 Finns Leinster Journal\n\nInsurrection Act.

P. Whitty sitting together drinking punch, this Donohoe considered a breach of the Act of Partliment, lately made, in which no Publican can sell or allow to be consumed in his house any punch, spirits, ale or wine, beyond the prohibited hour of 8 o'clock on a Sunday evening, under a certain penalty. Treacy was summoned before the Magistrates of petty Sessions, as was Whitty, upon examination it appear that Treacy and Whitty had walked out on the evening of the same day to listen to the band playing, and upon coming home, Treacy had invited his friend Whitty to partake of a glass of punch as a treat; this being sworn to by both, the Magistrates fined him in the mitigated penalty of ten schillings, the fine was paid, but appealed to the sitting Bench and after a tedious and desultory arguement between the Solicitors engaged on both sides, an also the magistrates, the Barrister gave it as his opinion that a legislative body never contemplated, that a publican should be deprived of the rights of hospitality to his friend in his own house, but as it was a question of such vital interest to publicans and the public in general, he would not decide, but would send the case up to the law advisors of the Crown for their ultimate decision.\n\n1840 Canada, British Regimental Registers\n\nThomas Tracy. 5'7.25\", 18 years, sallow complexion, hazel eyes, brown hair, b.
