        "text": "Introduction\n\nIt is seventeen years since the West Wicklow Historical Society published the book General O’Brien: West Wicklow to South America, [1] which I had the honour of jointly editing with our late, long-serving secretary, Donal McDonnell. Although another book was published in 2020 on the life, times and legacy of the remarkable John ‘Thomond’ O’Brien,[2] there is as yet, to the best of my knowledge, no shorter essay providing an overview of the same ground. In memory of Donal and his work on the original book, I have decided to attempt to fill that gap with this article. A piece such as this can only scratch the surface of the full and varied life led by O’Brien, but I hope it provides a solid introduction to the general and his times. Due to the fact that it is published on this website, there is a heavier than usual emphasis on O’Brien’s background in Baltinglass and its environs during his youth (taken from the original General O’Brien book) in section one. Section two addresses his life, career and legacy in South America. If this brief essay whets readers’ historical appetites and leaves them wishing to learn more about John Thomond O’Brien, the General O’Brien book is still available from the society’s website (www.wwhs.ie).\n\nThe West Wicklow world in which O’Brien grew up, and how it shaped him\n\nJohn O’Brien, the son of Martin O’Brien and his wife Honoria (nee O’Connor), was born in the west Wicklow market town of Baltinglass in 1786. The young O’Brien grew up in a time of unrest, when revolutionary movements that began in America and France were filtering through into Ireland. The success of George Washington’s continental army in the American War of Independence had proved that the armed forces of Great Britain were not invincible. The success of the French Revolution, culminating in the execution of King Louis XVI, had shown that republicanism was a viable alternative to monarchy. The organisation of United Irishmen introduced such republican ideas into Ireland during the 1790s. Republican ideals spread throughout the island, and west Wicklow and the Baltinglass region saw the arrival of republican organisers early in 1797, from which time the movement grew rapidly in the locality.\n\nWhen John O’Brien was a boy in Baltinglass, the town and all of the surrounding area of west Wicklow was seething with undercurrents of republicanism and rebellion. In 1797, Ulster man William Putnam McCabe had introduced the United Irishmen into the region, and the secret oath-bound organisation had made great inroads in the area. Crown forces were soon on high alert. As early as August 1797, the militia commander Captain Benjamin O’Neale Stratford [brother of the Earl of Aldborough] wrote:\n\nI left my house after nightfall and went to the Inn at Baltinglass, and I must in justice to the corps I have the honour to command say that I never perceived more regularity and at the same time more determined spirit and alertness than they showed.[3]\n\nThe scene was set for rebellion in the Baltinglass region in the spring of 1798. Many Baltinglass inhabitants, such as the carpenter Michael Kearns,[4] were involved in the planning of an armed uprising. The area was descending into violence and the political situation was becoming very polarised in west Wicklow. In May 1798 one worried loyalist wrote:\n\nThe more active Rebels in them same lands of the parish of Baltinglass are flying these three days past from their houses, for fear of the information getting at Athy from Mr. Brennan and other smiths that had been taken up, and if it be necessary to use more effectual means to recover the arms in the parish of Baltinglass (as in my opinion it will) the soldiery or magistrates will, by that time, not know how many or who have fled from their houses, for want of having taken a correct return of the names of all the inhabitants in due time.[5]\n\nArms were stockpiled and hidden in preparation for the day of rebellion. Loyalists were living in fear of the eruption of hostilities and a contemporary loyalist letter stated: ‘It is melancholy to think how slowly the inhabitants of this town and southern farms of the parish of Baltinglass are delivering in their concealed arms’.[6] Times were tense and the young John O’Brien found himself in the middle of a volatile situation.\n\nBaltinglass of the 1790s\n\nIn the 1790s Baltinglass was a market town, serving the west Wicklow area as a services centre. The dominant landlord in the locality was the Earl of Aldborough, who had been responsible for the building of a model village named Stratford-on-Slaney near Baltinglass. The second Earl of Aldborough, Edward Stratford, planned this venture, and work on the project started in or about 1780. By 1786 the village was booming and producing lace, plush, ribbons, carpets, linen and stockings.[7] However, the dominant industry in the village was calico and cotton printing. This industry spilled into nearby Baltinglass and helped to create a prosperous middle class in the town. John O’Brien’s father, Martin, was a member of this textile-prosperous middle class, and on 18 November 1796 (along with Adam Mulholland), he leased a bleach house and bleach green from Annesley Derinzy.[8] Like many other members of this middle class, Martin O’Brien was Roman Catholic, one of the flock led by Fr. Travers [Travis], the parish priest of Baltinglass. The 1790s was a decade of sectarian tension all over Ireland and Baltinglass was no exception. The authorities and the military (controlled by the Protestant Ascendancy) viewed Travers with deep suspicion. One contemporary letter to Dublin Castle warned that a liberal local landlord, Morley Saunders and:\n\nMr. Travers, the parish priest of Baltinglass, with the fiery Jacobins of Stratford-on-Slaney, humbugged, browbeat and cajoled by arms, the inhabitants of their whole neighbourhood and one another into a motley but inveterate union of arms, bloodshed and anarchy.[9]\n\nShortly afterwards another letter to the Castle commented: ‘If it were possible to get an honest or loyal parish priest to put in place of William Travers, the arms would soon come in’.[10] The locality was tense and the search was on for concealed arms in the Baltinglass region. The young John O’Brien was a product of this divided, volatile community.\n\nThe town of Baltinglass was at the centre of these developments. It was on one of the main roads from Dublin to Wexford, via settlements such as Tullow, Newtownbarry [Bunclody] and Enniscorthy. All of these places were the scenes of major battles during the 1798 rebellion, and Baltinglass held vital strategic importance during this time. Baltinglass was a garrison town and the area found itself at the centre of the rebellion, which broke out in west Wicklow and neighbouring county Kildare on the night of 23 and morning of 24 May 1798. The village of Stratford was the scene of an attack, during which armed rebels succeeded in driving the yeomen out of the village, before the yeomen launched a successful counter-attack and recaptured the village, leaving approximately two hundred rebels killed and many more wounded.[11] The best-known incident to happen in Baltinglass itself during the rebellion was the escape of the parish priest, Fr. Travers, from certain death. The priest had been captured by a detachment of soldiers who were about to execute him. Lady Aldborough came upon the scene and intervened, placing herself between Travers and the soldiers. The priest took advantage of the ensuing confusion and the confrontation between Lady Aldborough and the soldiers, and fled, escaping from the district. He sheltered in Ballyadams, where he remained until his death. Travers was lucky; many rebels, such as Paul Brophy of Rathmoone, were publicly hanged in Baltinglass and several captured rebels were also beheaded in the town’s main street. Their heads were displayed publicly and left on public display on the gaol, as a grim reminder to any would-be rebels or rebel sympathisers.[12] The twelve-year-old John O’Brien was at a most impressionable age when Baltinglass and its environs witnessed such upheaval during the 1798 Rebellion, prompting one balladeer to pen the following lines:\n\nThere is a curse o’er Baltinglass,\n\nAnd likewise o’er Dunlavin,\n\nFor spilling innocent blood thereon\n\nWhich is for vengeance calling.[13]\n\nFailure of the 1798 Rebellion\n\nUnlike the American and French revolutions, the Irish rebellion of 1798 did not succeed. By late summer the rebels had been defeated, but the Baltinglass and west Wicklow areas remained centres of unrest. This was due to the prolonged guerrilla campaign waged by firstly by Joseph Holt’s and later by Michael Dwyer’s bands of rebels in the Wicklow Mountains. Baltinglass experienced much violence and many courts martial, as many of the captured rebels were tried and executed. Some lucky captives, such as Michael Doyle (court-martialled on 19 February 1799) were transported to Australia for life. The unlucky ones included James Comyns (court-martialled on 9 March 1799), John Byrns (court-martialled on 13 March 1799), William Genoud (court-martialled on 22 December 1800) and many others.[14] They were all sentenced to death and hanged in Baltinglass. In his young teenage years, the young John O’Brien would have been no stranger to ruthlessness, and his adolescence in the grim garrison town of Baltinglass would have provided many grisly sights that steeled him for his future military career.\n\nAnother influence on the future military career of the young John O’Brien may have been the brilliant guerrilla campaign waged by Michael Dwyer in the nearby Wicklow Mountains. This remarkable leader was born in the Glen of Imaal in 1772. He joined the Society of United Irishmen and took part in the rebellion in Wexford in 1798. Following the defeat of the rebels in Wexford, Dwyer retreated into the wilderness area of the Wicklow Mountains. From here he carried out a spirited resistance, always posing a threat to the forces of the Crown. This was brought home to the population of Baltinglass on 8 December 1798, a fair day in the town, when two Baltinglass yeomen named Magennis were shot. Later that day, Dwyer’s men also shot two other soldiers and a farmer named Young at Tuckmill, just outside Baltinglass. [15] Living as he did in the close-knit local community, the young John O’Brien would have known all these people. He probably also knew a boy named Williams (whose father was executed on Dunlavin green on 24 May 1798), who left a vivid eyewitness account of the shooting of the Magennis incident. Williams was about fourteen years old in 1798, and this account was penned at a later date:\n\nWe were living between Baltinglass and Stratford. I … was going on a message for my mother. I was not far from the house when I saw three men. I am not sure there were not four of them. They were armed with muskets. They turned off the road for a short distance and went to the house of a weaver named Magennis. Passing on to the door one of them thrust the butt end of his gun through a frame of glass. The son of Magennis ran out to see what was the matter, leaving a neighbour, Ned Duffy (whose brother and son were both shot in Dunlavin) within. Magennis’s sister ran to the house of one Doran, a protestant publican, for succour. They asked Magennis to give up his arms to them. He said the arms were in Baltinglass. One of the party said: ‘Shoot him’. Magennis then seized hold on the musket of the next man to him under his arm and struggled hard to protect himself. Magennis was shot; I could not find who the person was that shot him… I ran home in fright. On my way I met a soldier; he had his bayonet drawn in his hand. I told him not to go on that way or he would be shot … Unfortunately for him he met his enemies in a few minutes after. Whether he used any rough language to them or not, I can’t say, but they shot him. He ran into my mother’s house with his hands pressed tight across his belly. … During this time Captain Michael Dwyer with his party went on to a place called Tuckmill, something about half way between Baltinglass and Stratford on Slaney where they met with a farmer named Thomas Young and shot him also. I never could learn what they had against Young, whether he was accused of being a spy on them or not. From there they proceeded to the house of one Wilson, a permanent sergeant of yeomanry, and burned it.[16]\n\nDwyer would carry on his resistance for more than five years. He was also in contact with Robert Emmet and he promised Emmet that he would bring five thousand men to support the Dublin revolt – but only if the city was taken and held for two days. Following the failure of Emmet’s rising and with no hope of foreign aid from Napoleonic France, Michael Dwyer finished his military campaign in December 1803.[17] During all this time, the garrison in Baltinglass remained on high alert, and the rebels provided the young John O’Brien with some classic examples of guerrilla military manoeuvres and mountain fighting.\n\nDuring his teenage years, John O’Brien was growing up in a climate of violent public unrest. West Wicklow was effectively a war zone, in which the O’Brien family of Baltinglass had to survive. They were Roman Catholics, and may have had some sympathy with the rebellion.[18] However, John’s father farmed some land and had a textile business in the locality, so to show any open support for the rebel cause would have been very dangerous. Nonetheless, it is reasonable to assume that the young John O’Brien learned something of life and of military tactics and realities from the rebels, who continued to threaten the Baltinglass area until 1803.\n\nLondon, then South America\n\nJohn O’Brien lived in Baltinglass until 1811. He left the area at the age of twenty-five, having accrued a high level of debt, [19] which included gambling debts from betting on horses.[20] It seems likely that he joined the British army but deserted shortly afterwards, leaving London for South America.[21] Making use of family connections (through the textile business in Baltinglass) with the Orrs of Stratford-on-Slaney, who exported textiles to both Chile and Argentina, he crossed the southern Atlantic Ocean.[22] He landed first in Brazil, but by 1812 the young John O’Brien had arrived in Buenos Aires. His life of adventure in South America had begun. He brought with him a knowledge of the horrors of war and an understanding of violence, rebellion and retribution. These were all qualities that would serve him well in his new life, in the words of Benjamin Vicuna MacKenna, ‘as a soldier and nothing more’.[23] The unknown Baltinglass youth was on his way to becoming a South American legend.\n\nThe South American world to which O’Brien travelled, and how he shaped it.\n\nWhen the young John O’Brien arrived in South America, it was not the patchwork of independent states that we recognise today.[24] Basically, with the exceptions of Brazil (Portugal) and the three Guyanas (Britain, France and Netherlands) in the northeast, the rest of that vast continent was under Spanish control. The Spanish colonies were divided into three areas: New Granada in the north (roughly corresponding to modern Colombia and Ecuador), Peru in the centre (roughly covering present-day Peru and Bolivia) and Rio de la Plata (also known as Buenos Aires, and roughly taking in much of Uruguay and Argentina on today’s maps).[25] The Spanish authorities presided over a hugely unequal regime, which placed the Creoles (those of Spanish or mixed-Spanish descent born in South America) at a severe disadvantage, both socially and economically. The Creoles did not enjoy the same rights or lifestyles as their Spanish overlords; their trade was restricted and it could not compete with or threaten anything produced in Spain. To add insult to injury, the Creoles had to pay punitive taxes to Spain, causing deep resentment and creating a seething anger which made the whole Spanish-controlled area of the continent ripe for revolution.\n\nThe revolutionary cause was helped by the fact that the Napoleonic Wars were raging in Europe and Spain was embroiled in turmoil, which was precipitated in May 1808 when Napoleon tried to install his brother, Joseph Bonaparte, as monarch of Spain. This led to rebellion, sparking the Peninsular War, known in Spanish as ‘Guerra de la Independencia’ (War of Independence), which would drag on until 1814.[26] With Spain weakened and distracted by domestic conflict, the South American Creoles seized their chance. They formed juntas, at first ostensibly to defend Spain’s interests against the French, but soon afterwards declaring independence from Spain too. Between 1810 and 1811, six such juntas were formed, including one in Buenos Aires, which declared independence in Rio de la Plata. This led to conflict with the Spanish authorities, and a patriotic army was raised to defend the fledgling independence of the region. In 1812, an Argentinian officer, Lieutenant Colonel Jose Francisco de San Martin, a veteran of the Peninsular War, returned to Buenos Aires and was commissioned to form a regiment of mounted grenadiers. This was done on 16 March 1812, and the officers of the new regiment included Second Lieutenant John O’Brien, whose business ventures in Buenos Aires had not gone well, and who had now opted for a life of adventure and thrown in his lot with the revolutionaries.\n\nBattle of San Lorenzo 1813\n\nO’Brien and his regiment first saw action at the battle of San Lorenzo on 3 February 1813, when the mounted grenadiers successfully ambushed and routed Spanish forces who had landed near Rosario, on the west bank of the Parana river. Although small in scale, this victory was important for morale within the patriotic army.[27] Later that year, O’Brien fought with distinction at the siege of Montevideo,[28] which was liberated in June 1814 when the Spanish surrendered the besieged and blockaded city to General Carlos Maria de Alvear.[29] The independence of Montevideo was formally declared in 1816 and Sergeant Major Juan O’Brien (as he was now known) was attached to the personal escort of General Alvear. However, he soon returned to Mendoza to rejoin San Martin, having now risen to the rank of captain. At this time, San Martin and Bernardo O’Higgins were gathering the Army of the Andes in preparation for an invasion of Chile, and O’Brien was sent to patrol and guard the strategically important mountain pass at Portillo during the extremely inclement winter of 1816. He successfully accomplished this difficult mission and was rewarded by San Martin, who appointed Juan O’Brien as his personal aide-de-camp, and O’Brien became San Martin’s ‘inseparable adjutant’.[30] In this capacity, the man from County Wicklow would participate in all the independence struggles of Chile, Bolivia and Peru.[31]\n\nIn January 1817 San Martin’s rebels (or, as they became known, the ‘Army of Liberation’ – the names of victorious rebel forces are often changed post facto; those of vanquished rebel forces are usually unchanged) invaded Chile. Having negotiated the dangerous mountain passes of the Andes, San Martin’s army of some three and a half thousand men engaged a Spanish royalist force under General Rafael Maroto at the Battle of Chacabuco on 12 February. San Martin led about two thousand men into battle and was supported by the Chilean military leader, Bernardo O’Higgins, with about one and a half thousand under his command. O’Higgins attacked first (which went against the original plan of a concerted, two-pronged attack), but San Martin then ordered Argentinian General Estanislao Soler to lead a charge against the royalist flank, thus relieving O’Higgins and his hard-pressed detachment. The strategy worked, and slowly but surely the tide of battle turned. The engagement had begun at dawn, but by the afternoon the royalists were hemmed in around the Chacabuco ranch. John Thomond O’Brien distinguished himself in this battle. According to Vicuna MacKenna:\n\nSo great was his [O’Brien’s] eagerness, that he succeeded in being the first to reach the doors of the houses of Chacabuco in pursuit of the royalists’. He was certainly in the vanguard, as he managed to capture the royal standard. The battle resulted in a resounding victory for San Martin’s army – some five hundred royalists were killed and a further six hundred were taken prisoner. In contrast, rebel deaths totalled about a hundred and thirty.[32] It has been suggested that ‘the insurgent victory at Chacabuco constituted the first successful step in the struggle which culminated in Chile’s independence.[33]\n\nO’Brien’s involvement at Chacabuco did not end with the cessation of hostilities on the day. Despite his defeat, General Maroto had escaped. San Martin detailed O’Brien to take a small detachment of men and pursue the fleeing general. The next day, O’Brien learned that Maroto had too much of a head start to be caught. O’Brien’s group had reached the Hill of Prado, where Maroto and his men had briefly stopped the previous day. While O’Brien’s men were feeding and watering their horses, they discovered bags containing gold worth 25,000 -30,000 pesos, which the royalists had not hidden well enough. There was also a silver bit for a horse and a pair of epaulettes to add to the booty. General Maroto had not been captured, but O’Brien had a treasure trove to bring back to Santiago, where he presented his find to the newly-established Chilean government, selflessly refusing to take a percentage of its value for himself.[34] This injection of capital was warmly welcomed by the fledgling government and was, according to Vicuna MacKenna, ‘worth a lot more than Maroto’.\n\nFollowing their defeat at Chacabuco, the Spanish retreated to the south, where they still posed a threat to the forces of liberation. A new royalist general, Mariano Osorio, arrived to take command early in 1818, and on 19 March his army launched a surprise nocturnal attack on San Martin’s men, putting them to flight. However, San Martin’s Chileno-Argentinian force regrouped quickly after this setback, and on 5 April 1818 they emerged victorious at the decisive Battle of Maipu [Maipo]. This gruelling six-hour battle ended with about two thousand royalist dead and about two and a half to three thousand captured, for the loss of about a thousand of San Martin’s patriot army.[35] The patriots’ definitive victory at Maipu eliminated Spain’s influence and ended Spanish interests in Chile.[36] Once again, John Thomond O’Brien distinguished himself in this battle. He rode at the head of a cavalry regiment, including mounted grenadiers, whose charge at the Burgos regiment on the royalist flank gave the patriots a crucial advantage on the battlefield. This key moment proved to be a turning point in the combat, and San Martin’s men went on to carry the day.\n\nIn an odd twist, O’Brien’s involvement in the aftermath of the Battle of Maipu had a sense of déjà vu, almost mirroring his exploits after the Battle of Chacabuco. Once again, the defeated general (Osorio this time) had escaped, and once again O’Brien was detailed to capture him. Leading a detachment of mounted grenadiers, he set off in pursuit, but in an effort to overtake and intercept Osorio’s party, he gambled of the route that the general was most likely to take. In the event, Osorio took a different route, and, once again, O’Brien’s quarry eluded him. However, while returning to inform San Martin of what had happened, O’Brien chanced upon a group of royalists retreating with their mule train. According to Figueroa, O’Brien took ‘over four hundred prisoners including twenty-five officers … likewise, he managed to capture the luggage, the correspondence and all the despatches and files of Osorio, a valuable prize of war’. On his return to Santiago, O’Brien presented these to San Martin, who discovered that the documents in question revealed much information about the enemy’s strength, strategy, tactics and their contacts within the patriot ranks, thus unmasking a number of spies and traitors. Hence, mirroring events after the Battle of Chacabuco, once again O’Brien’s capture of a ‘prize of war’ after the Battle of Maipu aided the patriotic cause.\n\nPeru\n\nWith the Spanish royalists ousted from Chile, San Martin and his patriotic army of liberation turned their attention to Peru. Aided by Alexander Cochrane, a naval captain from Scotland, an invading force sailed from Valparaiso, a port northwest of Santiago. O’Brien’s alertness and prompt action saved the naval expedition at the port of Ancon, where he was involved in a successful effort to extinguish a fire on board a ship carrying ammunition and gunpowder. According to Figueroa ‘Without this gesture of boldness by O’Brien, as opportune as it was risky, the expedition of liberation would have burned completely defenceless at the gates of the same country it was going to invade’. A brutal, year-long campaign followed, in which O’Brien participated in many dangerous expeditions and forays into enemy territory.[37] Slowly but surely the patriots got the upper hand, and by July 1821 San Martin and his men occupied Lima, following its abandonment by the royalist Viceroy José de la Serna.[38] On 28 of that month, San Martin declared the independence of Peru in Lima’s Plaza de Armas.[39]\n\nNotwithstanding this declaration however, pockets of resistance remained. One of the principal royalist strongholds was the port of Callao. Patriotic forces besieged this heavily-fortified stronghold in August 1821. The besieging patriots could not capture the fortified position, but the royalists had little hope of relief and probably little stomach for a long siege. Hence, on 19 September, the royalist commander, General José de la Mer, surrendered the royalist garrison, and the port finally fell to the army of liberation.[40] During the three-day celebrations following this victory,[41] O’Brien was honoured for his part in the Peruvian campaign, and was given the signal honour of carrying all of San Martin’s captured banners, standards, trophies and prizes of war. According to Figueroa, O’Brien ‘was the only officer of his guard that the general took up to the rostrum for this solemn act, presenting him with his own hand, and an honourable inscription, the great parasol beneath which the old viceroys had made their entry into the capital’. The following year, José San Martin met Simon Bolivar, who had been fighting the Spanish in the northern part of South America, at the Guayaquil Conference of 1822.[42] The two leaders did not agree on how the newly-liberated continent should be governed, but on his return to Lima, San Martin resigned and abdicated in favour of Bolivar.[43] Meanwhile, John Thomond O’Brien returned to Buenos Aires.\n\nSpain’s last outpost lost\n\nSporadic royalist resistance continued however, prompting O’Brien to return to military life. He aided the patriot leaders Simon Bolivar and Antonio Jose de Sucre in pursuit of the remaining Spanish forces and their supporters, and by 1825, following patriot victories on the field of battle, (notably on 9 December at Ayacucho), Spain’s last outpost in South America was lost forever. On 6 August 1825 the newly independent country of Bolivia, named in honour of Bolivar, came into being.[44] Later that year, in a symbolic gesture to show that his soldiering days were over, John Thomond O’Brien buried his medals in the ruins of the Templo del Inca on the Isla del Sol in the Bolivian section of Lake Titicaca.[45] Bolivar rewarded O’Brien for his service by giving him the exploration rights to the Salcedo silver mine at Puno.[46] The infant republics of Peru and Bolivia were both in need of capital, and it was hoped that restoring old mine workings would help to generate revenue. In conjunction with his business partner, John Begg, O’Brien had the mine drained. He also supervised the purchase, dismantling, transportation by mule across the Andes, and reassembly of a sailing ship, the brig ‘Santa Maria’, which was renamed the ‘Julia’, to supply the miners with wood and comestibles, which had to be brought across Lake Titicaca. Due to the elevated altitude of the lake, the ‘Julia’ became famous as the highest working sailing ship in the world.[47] Over the next decade or so, O’Brien was involved in many efforts to raise capital for both Bolivia and Peru, including his silver mine, explorations in search of new resources, and journeys to encourage investment from and trade with European countries, including Britain and Ireland.\n\nO’Brien was also involved in a scheme to encourage Irish emigrants to travel to and settle in South America. Fertile land was available in the new South American nations and they wanted settlers to inhabit and farm many areas, including remote rural regions where farmers were needed. In the mid-1820s, John Thomond O’Brien was part of an influential group of Irishmen, which included Doctors John Oughagan and Michael O’Gorman and Fr. Patrick Moran (the first official Irish chaplain to arrive in Argentina),[48] who managed to interest the Argentinian government in a scheme to attract Irish immigrants to that country.[49] This elite group believed that the Irish at home were denied opportunities for bettering themselves because of their Catholicism. They argued that Irish immigrants, under the leadership of the Irish elite in Argentina, would establish a prosperous community espousing Gaelic and Catholic values.[50] In 1826, following correspondence with the Archbishop of Dublin, O’Brien was commissioned to return to Ireland to recruit ‘moral and industrious’ people who would make the journey to Argentina.[51] O’Brien insisted on the condition that the Irish who emigrated to Argentina would be accompanied by their own chaplain, who would minister solely to them.[52] He travelled in the company of Buenos Aires merchant, Thomas Armstrong of Garrycastle, County Offaly, at a time when the campaign for Catholic Emancipation was at its height in Ireland.[53] Two years later, O’Brien returned to Argentina with Patrick and Mary Bookey and John Mooney of Streamstown, County Westmeath. A significant amount of emigration to Argentina from the Irish midlands grew from this humble beginning.\n\nAdvancing the Catholic Emancipation cause\n\nBack in Buenos Aires, O’Brien and other Irish émigrés formed a group to advance the cause of Catholic Emancipation in Ireland.[54] He was involved in establishing a fund for the cause, and personally collected money, in addition to advertising in the press. He also wrote newspaper articles on the subject.[55] In February 1829 he wrote: ‘An impartial view of the Catholic Question will convince every reflecting mind, that it is not the cause of Irishmen alone, but that of civil and religious liberty throughout the world’.[56] Later that year, in a letter to Daniel O’Connell (published in the Dublin press), O’Brien wrote: ‘Our countrymen here … are most enthusiastic in supporting our little association; what they give, they give it with the greatest cheerfulness imaginable’.[57] For his part, O’Connell was not oblivious to events in South America. As early as 16 December 1824, at a time when the British Foreign Secretary was proposing to formally recognise the newly-independent republics created by Bolivar’s rebellious military campaigns, he had made a rousing, militant speech in which he stated that he ‘hoped Ireland would be restored to her rights; but … if she were driven mad by persecution, he wished that a new Bolivar might arise – that the spirit … of the South Americans might animate the people of Ireland’.[58] In July 1826 O’Connell founded an Order of Liberators in Ireland, after the fashion of a similar society founded by Simon Bolivar in South America.[59] O’Brien’s Argentinian fund ensured that O’Connell’s support of the South American cause was mirrored in a small way by South American support for Irish Catholic emancipation, and the Wicklow man was overjoyed, proclaiming ‘the signal overthrow of the powers of darkness and bigotry’, and thanking ‘his friends and the most generous public of this city’ for ‘liberally subscribing in aid of the fund for that great cause’ in print,[60] after the Catholic Emancipation bill had finally received royal assent on 13 April 1829.[61]\n\nUnrest\n\nThe late 1820s and the 1830s were marked by unrest as the dream of a united South America foundered amid disagreements and divisions among the new states. By 1829 Andrés de Santa Cruz had succeeded Antonio Jose de Sucre as president of Bolivia. By 1835, neighbouring Peru was beset by civil war, and John Thomond O’Brien, who had recently retired from the Argentinian army and returned from an exploration of the Amazon,[62] supported Santa Cruz in an invasion of Peru. Following this campaign, Santa Cruz established the Peru-Bolivia Confederation under his own control. Both Argentina and Chile felt threatened by Santa Cruz’s new protectorate, and they declared war on the fledgling confederation. General Juan Manuel Rosas, the Governor of Buenos Aires, prepared to move against Santa Cruz, who in April 1837 sent John Thomond O’Brien as an emissary with a letter of friendship to Rosas in an unsuccessful attempt to avoid war on the southern front of the confederation. O’Brien was taken prisoner by Rosas, but later released, after which he sailed for Ireland.\n\nO’Brien returned to South America, this time to Uruguay, in 1841, aiming to retire to a life of horse breeding and sheep farming. That country had experienced a recent civil war and President Fructuoso Rivera’s ousted opponent, Manuel Oribe went into exile in neighbouring Buenos Aires. Supported by Governor, General Juan Manuel Rosas, Oribe staged an invasion of Uruguay in 1843, and O’Brien had to flee the country. Oribe laid siege to Montevideo for nine years, during which O’Brien sought support for Rivera in Britain and France, for the protection of Montevideo from Rosas’ and Oribe’s hostile forces. He encouraged European intervention on the grounds that trade was severely affected by the blockade of the River Plate, and that British subjects in the region were in danger. O’Brien succeeded in having British and French troops sent to blockade the port of Buenos Aires in December 1845.\n\nDeath in 1861\n\nBy 1849 the Europeans decided to withdraw their forces and the fall of Montevideo was perilously close, but Justo Jose de Urquiza, the governor of Entre Rios in Argentina, sent his soldiers to aid Rivera’s Uruguayan troops. They drove Oribe’s forces out of Uruguay in 1851. In 1852 Rosas fell from power and went into exile in England,[63] and John Thomond O’Brien, whose diplomatic efforts on behalf of Uruguay had been so successful during the war, was appointed consul general to the United Kingdom by President Rivera, returning to Europe in 1854.[64] The diplomat continued his work on behalf of Uruguay and South America, visited Ireland in 1858, and in late 1860 he sailed for Buenos Aires via Lisbon. However, he fell ill while in the Portuguese capital. He died in the care of the Dominicans of the Irish College there on 1 June 1861. His remains were interred in Lisbon, but in 1935, at the request of the Argentinian government, his ashes were repatriated to Buenos Aires, where the Wicklow man was given a full state funeral and re-interred as a national hero in the Recoleta Cemetery.\n\nA forgotten Irish hero\n\nApart from a wall-plaque in his native Baltinglass, John Thomond O’Brien is now virtually forgotten in Ireland, but his name has a much higher profile in South America. For example, he is honoured with a street name in Santiago, Chile, and there is a town and railway station named after him in Argentina.[65] Given his major role in the South American wars of independence, it is unsurprising that O’Brien has become a South American hero. In his short biography of the Wicklow man, Benjamin Vicuna McKenna ends with a suggested epitaph for O’Brien: ‘He was a soldier and nothing more’. He is remembered as a brave military man with a thirst for adventure. His sense of adventure became evident at a young age, when he left west Wicklow and, later, London (possibly under a cloud in both cases, due to gambling debts), and made his way to South America, where he embarked on a military career. His courage was unquestioned, and many brave deeds that he carried out were recorded by his contemporaries. He rose through the ranks of three armies, and took part in liberating four countries – Argentina, Chile, Peru and Uruguay. He seemed more motivated by the cause of independence than by personal gain. The stark text of Vicuna McKenna’s suggested epitaph for him reflected the fact that, although he could easily have chosen to do so, O’Brien did not participate in the various power struggles that occurred in South America in the wake of its abandonment by the Spanish. By remaining aloof from these political squabbles, he retained the respect of all parties, who evidently admired the courage and forthrightness of the old soldier. In later years, O’Brien’s successful diplomatic role as the Uruguayan representative in both London and Paris enhanced his reputation still further, and increased the levels of respect that he enjoyed.\n\nHowever, Tim Fanning suggests that, although O’Brien’s military record was exemplary, he consciously shaped and cultivated his own image as a hero of the revolution.[66] Moreover, O’Brien used the print media to enhance this public image. It is difficult to argue against the charge of self-aggrandisement, particularly as, during the final decade or so of his life, Juan O’Brien engaged in a campaign to have permanent, lasting monuments erected throughout South America to the leaders of the revolution. Doubtless, he would not have directly suggested any monument in his own honour, but, if other leaders were to be similarly honoured, it might be expected that O’Brien would be included on the list of monumental candidates. The Wicklow man’s adoption of ‘Thomond’ within his name was perhaps an early indication of his tendency to self-aggrandise. Thomond is an area in the province of Munster, which was ruled by the O’Brien clan, with links all the way back to the famous high king of Ireland, Brian Boru, who died in 1014. The young man from a middle-class, trading background in west Wicklow was keen to advertise the fact that he was a descendant of an old Irish royal family, and thus came from noble stock. However, his own entrepreneurial efforts were disastrous. His silver mine came to naught and the destruction of his Uruguayan sheep farm meant that he lost much of the wealth that he had accrued over the years. Economic circumstances may have conspired against him, but all the evidence points to the fact that O’Brien was not a businessman. He had more success in raising capital for Catholic emancipation than for his business ventures. In later years his diplomatic success also added to his impressive military reputation, which may have been aided by his ability to manipulate his own public image. Ultimately, however, this would not have been possible without his long and distinguished military service, and it was his unquestioned and unquestionable bravery on many battlefields that ensured that he is remembered throughout much of South America to this day.\n\nReferences"
