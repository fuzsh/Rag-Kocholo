        "meta_description": "Age 45  On the morning of September 17, 2021, Edward’s battle with cancer ended in a draw. Eddie’s spirit will continue to live on through his parents, Kevin and Susan (Harmon) O’Brien, his brothers Brendan (Emily) and Sean (Kristen), and the love of his life Tracy McClune and her children Caitlin and Ryan.   Eddie was the best #1 son ever!  Through his unquestionable love of family and everyday actions, Eddie instilled in his brothers the true meaning of family-first. Fast Eddie played hard and worked harder, running through life with music playing in his head and a response in the form of a lyric.   Eddie was renowned for his classic music collection, for which his parents were extremely grateful.  His love for music, hockey, NASCAR, boating, and a clean truck will live on forever in his family.  Eddie made the most of his time on earth, spending every second with family and friends. As a member of Ironworkers Local 3, Eddie was fortunate to spend most of his work days with family by his side.  As a member of the West Penn Football Officials Association, he worked on crews along side his brothers and friends.  Eddie fought for nearly four years, never wanting his burden put on anyone else. Eddie supported and participated in Drop The Puck On Cancer, a Brentwood community event raising money to help families dealing with cancer, and his selflessness was so evident when he insisted there was always others with needs greater than his.  May Ed forever be at peace and enjoy watching his family and friends carry on his legacy.  Edward Robert Harmon O’Brien - we will miss you forever. Friends will be received at the John F. Slater Funeral Home, Inc. , 412-881-4100, 4201 Brownsville Road, Brentwood 15227, on Sunday, September 19, 2021 and Monday, September 20, 2021 from 4:00 pm - 8:00 pm.  Funeral Prayer on  Tuesday morning at 9:45 am.  Mass of Christian Burial in  Blessed Trinity Parish, St. Sylvester Church at 10:30 am.  In lieu of flowers, family suggests contributions to  Drop The Puck On Cancer in Eddie’s name. www. dropthepuckoncancer. com",
