        "text": "This page presents brief biographies of the 32 Irish born men who served the Union and were breveted to the rank of Brigadier-General as a result of service in the American Civil War. Their names are drawn from Roger Hunt and Jack Brown’s research which reached fruition in their 1990 publication Brevet Brigadier Generals in Blue*. On this page the biographies as presented have been expanded upon with recourse to other sources, listed below each entry. These Irishmen never attained full general officer rank, and the majority served at Lieutenant-Colonel or Colonel level during the war.\n\nThe brevet general rank bestowed a higher officer grade to these men, and if commissioned during the war made them eligible for assignment by the President at this higher rank. If the President did not assign them they did not receive the pay, advantages or seniority that came with a general’s rank. The majority of brevets were granted as a reward for gallant and meritorious conduct, and were often honorific in nature. Large numbers were awarded after the end of the war as a means of acknowledging good service.\n\nIn some cases the brevet rank was used where an officer could not be promoted due to restrictions on the number of allowable general officers, and in these instances it was a mechanism to allow talented lower grade officers to exercise command at a higher level. This was utilised by Grant late in the war, and in 1865 he was given authority to assign officers to their brevet ranks without Presidential approval.\n\nThe Irishmen detailed below fall into both of the above categories of brevet general. Some received the additional advancement of being breveted beyond the rank of Brigadier-General to that of Major-General. Of the officers listed, one turned the brevet down. Patrick Timothy Andrews was initially breveted in the regular army for his conduct in the Mexican War, and when the brevet Brigadier-General of volunteers rank was offered to him in 1865 he declined it.\n\nReferences: Hunt, Roger D. and Brown, Jack R. 1990. Brevet Brigadier Generals in Blue, v-xx;\n\nAndrews, Timothy Patrick\n\nBorn in Ireland in 1794, and served in the War of 1812 under Commodore Barney and with a District of Columbia volunteer company in the field. A regular army officer, he was breveted Brigadier-General U.S.A. on 13th September for meritorious conduct at the Battle of Chapultepec in Mexico. During the Civil War, Andrews served as a Lieutenant-Colonel and Chief Paymaster on the staff of Major-General Henry W. Halleck and later as Paymaster General with the rank of Colonel. He retired at this rank in 1864, and later served as President of the Board for the examination of Paymasters and also Inspector of the Pay Department. His son Richard Snowden Andrews served in the Confederate forces as a Lieutenant-Colonel commanding the 1st Maryland Artillery, subsequently writing a memoir of his service. Timothy Patrick Andrews declined a brevet Brigadier-General rank put forward on 13th March 1865 for long and faithful service in the army. He died on 11th March 1868 in Washington D.C., where he is buried in Rock Creek Cemetery (Section B, Lot 75).\n\nReferences: Hunt, Roger D. and Brown, Jack R. 1990.

His good service between 1861 and 1865 was long remembered; one of his commanders, Major-General James Harrison Wilson described him in 1912 as ‘an educated soldier of great intelligence and enterprise . . . (who) had gained the esteem of all who had served under him. Long before the close of the war his regiment had justly come to be regarded as one of the best in the army . . . From the time he fell under my command till the end of the war, he was in every respect a modest and obedient officer, an excellent disciplinarian, and as good a leader as Murat himself. He needed but the continuous chances of war to become famous as the best Irish soldier of his day.’ Minty was not alive to hear his former commander’s compliments- he had died on 24th August 1906 in Jerome, Arizona and was buried in Aultorest Memorial Park, Ogden, Utah (Block 10, Lot 6).**\n\nReferences: Hunt, Roger D. and Brown, Jack R. 1990.

He lists 30 General brevets to Irish born officers, but excludes Timothy Patrick Andrews (who did not accept the rank), Richard Dillon, Edward Murray and George Morgan O’Brien. He also includes two officers who are not in the above list, James A. Mulligan and James Jourdan. Although Irish-American (Mulligan commanded the 23rd Illinois Infantry) they are excluded from the above as both were born in the United States rather than Ireland."
