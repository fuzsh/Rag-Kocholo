        "text": "(1890–1941). For 25 years the U.S. editor and anthologist Edward Joseph Harrington O’Brien compiled a highly influential, annual collection of short stories by U.S. authors. His Best Short Stories series played a major role in shaping the style and substance of the short story in the United States during the first half of the 20th century. Many important U.S. authors first gained notice through publication in O’Brien’s anthologies.\n\nEdward Joseph Harrington O’Brien was born in Boston, Mass., on Dec. 10, 1890. He attended Boston Latin School and Boston College before entering Harvard University in 1908; he withdrew from Harvard after six months. From 1912 to 1915 he worked as an editor at the Poetry Journal while also publishing some of his own poetry and essays in other periodicals. In 1915 O’Brien and his friend William Stanley Braithwaite came up with the idea of publishing a collection of the best short stories by U.S. authors that had appeared in literary journals during the previous year. O’Brien hoped that the project would help bolster the short-story genre in the United States.\n\nThe first anthology, The Best Short Stories of 1915, appeared in 1916. Thereafter O’Brien published an anthology each year until 1940. In each anthology he included a rating system for the stories, ranking each according to merit. The system had an immediate effect on the literary world, as writers began producing and magazines began publishing stories designed to appeal to O’Brien’s tastes. Among the writers singled out and encouraged by O’Brien in his anthologies were Ernest Hemingway, Ring Lardner, Willa Cather, and Eudora Welty.\n\nIn 1919 O’Brien moved to England, where he lived for most of the rest of his life. In 1922 he began publishing The Best British Short Stories, patterned after his U.S. anthologies; it appeared annually until 1940. When sales of his anthologies dropped during the economic depression of the 1930s, O’Brien gave a series of lectures in the United States. In 1937 he accepted a job as European story editor for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM). In addition to supervising a crew of writers who prepared plot summaries of novels to submit to MGM, O’Brien continued to read as many as 50,000 stories each year for his anthologies. He died on Feb. 25, 1941."
