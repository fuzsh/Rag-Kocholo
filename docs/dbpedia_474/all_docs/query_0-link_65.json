        "text": "In his 1998 memoir, Conor Cruise O’Brien wrote that before 1918, when John Redmond’s Irish Parliamentary Party (I.P.P.) seemed to be on the verge of securing self-government for Ireland, his grandfather, David Sheehy, M.P. (South Meath), had been a ‘person of considerable consequence’, since he was ‘one of the senior members of the party’. O’Brien believed that had home rule been achieved, his grandfather ‘would certainly have had a seat in the Irish cabinet’. Indeed, his ‘whole family would have been part of the establishment of the new Home Rule Ireland’. But owing to Sinn Féin’s rise after 1916, ‘we were out in the cold, superseded by a new republican elite’. Whereas before 1918, ‘To be connected with the Irish Parliamentary Party had been an asset; it was now a liability.’Footnote 1\n\nA conversation of the late 1960s between O’Brien and his father-in-law, the 1916 veteran, I.R.A. commander and Fianna Fáil T.D., Seán MacEntee, exemplifies O’Brien’s feelings of entitlement and dispossession:\n\nOf course, O’Brien’s sense of displacement could also be attributed to his own ego and ambition. After all, notwithstanding all his supposed disadvantages, O’Brien still managed to become a senior diplomat, government minister, and public intellectual in the country established by McEntee’s generation, while O’Brien’s uncle, Eugene Sheehy, had become a Free State judge, with O’Brien’s aunt, Hanna Sheehy Skeffington, serving in the Dáil courts, helping to co-found Fianna Fáil, and acting as one of Ireland’s leading feminist activists. Indeed, as one scholar has observed, ‘they were in their own way scions of the new regime’. Nonetheless, for someone like Eugene and Hanna’s sister Mary (like them the child of an M.P. but also the wife of one), she still believed that ‘her … family had come down in the world’ after 1918.Footnote 3\n\nIn recent years, historians have begun to reassess the fortunes of the ‘winners’ and ‘losers’ of the Irish Revolution.Footnote 4 The perception that the personnel of the I.P.P. (and by implication the people associated with them) were among those worsted in the game remains unchallenged, however.Footnote 5 This article seeks to go beyond Sheehy family folklore by testing O’Brien’s claim that those with ‘what Irish republicans … used to call “the bad parliamentary drop [of blood in their veins]”’ not only lost out as a result of Irish independence but also found independent Ireland something of a cold house.Footnote 6 In order to do so it adopts a prosopographical approach for a specific and definable group: the children of those M.P.s elected to parliament between 1910 and 1918. It attempts to reconstruct their life chances at specific points (1910 and 1948) in order to assess the impact that independence had on their fortunes. In doing so, this article seeks to contribute to the emerging scholarly literature that uses the concept of ‘generationism’ to understand early twentieth-century Irish history.Footnote 7\n\nThe dataset on which this research draws includes information on the 247 children known to have been born to the eighty-nine nationalist M.P.s elected between 1910 and 1918 (60 per cent of whom had offspring). Using the 1901 and 1911 censuses, newspapers, private papers, memoirs, biographies, autobiographies, and other sources, data for these 247 children have been analysed for this article.Footnote 8 Inevitably, these data are not complete, as detailed information is not available for all the children to the same extent. In particular, data for M.P.s’ daughters (especially relating to their occupations) are incomplete. The obstacles faced by women entering and remaining in the labour force in this period, the social norm of women giving up work after marriage, and the custom of changing surname following marriage make the data for I.P.P. M.P.s’ daughters particularly fragmentary. Additionally, the small number of memoirs and archives produced by M.P.s’ children inevitably privileges certain voices.\n\nThe fortunes of the I.P.P. children before, during, and after the revolutionary period provide a particularly interesting case study because, unlike other displaced political elites (of France in 1789, Russia in 1917, or Cuba in 1959, for example), Irish parliamentary nationalists did not go into exile as a result of the I.P.P.’s defeat.Footnote 9 Because the home rule elite was displaced by a parliamentary process, not a violent coup, the politics of their children were not conditioned by the experience of significant violence, physical exile, or the ambition to restore an exiled leader. As a result, there were no second-generation exiles to ferment counter-revolutionary activity from abroad.Footnote 10 Instead, the children of the displaced home rule elite remained in Ireland and so had to accommodate themselves to the new regime after 1922 more swiftly and more fully perhaps than other comparable groups in modern history.\n\nIn assessing the fortunes of the children of I.P.P. M.P.s, this article rejects the assumption that those who had reached adulthood before 1918 constituted some form of home rule Brahminate. By drawing on two recent contributions to the study of Edwardian Irish elites, it is clear that the socio-economic profile of these I.P.P. children did not place them among either Fergus Campbell’s Irish ‘establishment’ or Ciaran O’Neill’s ‘Catholics of consequence’.Footnote 11 On the other hand, the pre-war adult cohort did share certain common formative experiences (such as growing up in political households) and these undoubtedly provided them with certain life advantages. Before 1918, I.P.P. children enjoyed a form of inherited political capital derived from a combination of their fathers’ status as M.P.s in British Ireland and their projected future standing as members of the future home rule parliament. In addition, some children benefited from privileged access to political networks and to insider knowledge. While only a small number belonged to the younger generation of Edwardian home rulers whom Senia Pašeta has described as being ‘poised to inherit the free and sovereign Ireland which seemed at last to be within reach’, the outbreak of the war in 1914 suggests that critics of the I.P.P. saw the children of the party as sharing in the political sins of their fathers.Footnote 12 As such, if they were not viewed as a discrete group, they were clearly seen as auxiliaries of the I.P.P.\n\nIn its findings, this article compliments recent unpublished research on Irish politics after 1922. Martin O’Donoghue’s 2016 doctoral thesis analyses the ‘influence and persistence of Irish Party individuals, organisations and political culture in independent Ireland’, highlighting ‘the persistence of home rule loyalty in the Free State and the effects this had on the development of party politics’.Footnote 13 The analysis advanced here suggests that despite experiencing feelings of loss and displacement after 1918 (which undoubtedly persisted in some cases for decades), those scions of the old I.P.P. who lived through the years of turbulence between 1916 and 1923 re-oriented themselves relatively quickly, regrouped, and experienced considerable success under the new regime. As for those children who were born or achieved adulthood after 1922, there is very little evidence to suggest that they were socially or politically ostracised, or that, in turn, they felt a sense of fundamental alienation from the new state. In short, the available evidence does not suggest that the life chances of these children were adversely affected by independence to a measurable extent."
