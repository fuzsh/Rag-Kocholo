        "text": "Seventh place in the 400m at the 1936 Final Trials earned Eddie O'Brien a place on the Olympic relay team. Syracuse’s O'Brien was the fastest of the U.S. quartet in Berlin, running the third leg in 46.7. His best mark was 47.3 for 440y which he clocked in winning the Princeton Invitational in 1935. O'Brien won the AAU outdoor 440y in 1935 and in 1936 he was unbeaten indoors, setting a world record for 600m in winning the AAU title. He won the AAU again in 1937 and lost only one race during the indoor season. In 1936 and 1937 he also won the IC4A indoor 600 and he set a world record of 57.8 when he won the Buremeyer 500 in 1936. He brought that record down to 57.6 when he scored a repeat win in 1937.\n\nPersonal Best: 400 – 46.8 (1935)."
