        "text": "Edward Leo O’Brien, 89, passed away peacefully after a short heart issue Oct. 11, 2023, at Schneidmiller Hospice House.\n\nEd was born Feb. 16, 1934, in Smithport, Pa., to Edward and Hazel O’Brien.\n\nThe family moved west and landed in Montana. Ed started working at an early age to help provide for the family but still found time to discover a lifelong love for football when he played for Sydney HS. He joined the Navy in 1952 and was honorably discharged in 1956. In 1960, he started seasonal fire fighting for the Forest Service in Idaho and Montana and was hired full-time in 1963. He retired in 1982 from Fernan Ranger Station as a crew supervisor. He loved working in the woods and had many stories and experiences that he loved to share with family and friends. After his “retirement”, he spent the next 20+ years driving for the Spokesman-Review. He then dropped to working part-time delivering vehicles for Robideaux Motors and finally retired fully at 86.\n\nEd met Barbara Jacobson in Cd'A and married his love Dec. 12, 1964. They were joined by Ed, Michael and Teresa in the following years. Ed was a family man. When he wasn’t working, he was with them. Camping, huckleberry picking, wood cutting and vacations. This included a road trip East in a Subaru station wagon with two kids. What they were thinking is a mystery, the fact that the kids made it back is a bigger one. With the kids grown, Ed and Barbara’s plan was to travel and enjoy some time by themselves, unfortunately, that was cut short when Barbara passed away in 1993. “Papa” was a huge part of his grandson’s life. He loved nothing more than picking him up from school, working on a project, or taking their annual summer vacation. And for the last few years, he had the joy of a great-granddaughter in his life. Ed started a tradition of an annual camp trip at Magee Ranger Station years ago and happy memories will live on from those trips for his family and their friends. He liked nothing better than lunch with the “Kroc Crew” and you could also find him most Saturday mornings at The Blue Plate for breakfast with his long-time buddies Doug and Ed.\n\nEd was preceded in death by his parents, beloved wife Barbara, son Michael, his siblings Mae, Mabel, Tom and Don, and in-laws John, Sherri and Herbie.\n\nHe is survived by his son Ed (Jo) O’Brien, daughter Teresa Wright, grandson Chris Wright, great-granddaughter Ayla Wright, sister Sharon Cruz, sister-in-law Barb O’Brien and numerous nieces, nephews and extended family.\n\nThank you to English Funeral Home for handling his final arrangements. Please sign the online guestbook at www.englishfuneralchapel.com.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, please plant a tree or donate to your favorite charity in his name.\n\nCome celebrate a wonderful man Nov. 4, 2023, from 2-4 p.m. at The American Legion, 1138 E. Poleline, Post Falls, Idaho."
