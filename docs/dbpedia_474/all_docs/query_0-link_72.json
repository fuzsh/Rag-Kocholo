        "text": "DUBLIN — A major dispute over the scale of American fund‐raising for the Irish Republican Army has pitted officials in the United States, Britain and Ireland against a Bronx‐based relief organization for Roman Catholic women and children in Ulster.\n\nOfficials of the three Governments assert that within the last four years, the Irish Northern Aid Committee, which operates out of a storefront at 273 East 194th Street, has served as the principal source of foreign funds to the I.R.A.'s Provisional wing. The money—raised at bars, and at dances, dinners and parties across the United States —has provided thousands of weapons for the I.R.A.'s terror campaign, according to the officials.\n\nThe Bronx organization and its outlet in Dublin insist that every cent of the $1.2 million officially raised since 1971 has been channeled into relief work for families of prisoners, mostly of the I.R.A. The group argues that the public allegations against it are unsupported by hard evidence and are based on malicious rumor.\n\nBut United States intelligence sources in Washington charge that 75 percent of the money sent by the committee, which is called Noraid for short, has gone to buy arms, and 25 perCent for food, clothing and allowances for Catholic dependants.\n\nThe authorities in Ireland, Britain and the United States are convinced that Noraid's official accounting of its fundraising efforts is too low, and that $2 million to $3 million may actually have been raised at dances, dinners and collections in the Bronx, Queens, Boston, Chicago, San Francisco, Baltimore and Philadelphia.\n\nOver the last four years, the United States Justice Department has brought a dozen criminal cases involving the procurement and shipment of weapons to Ireland. American sources say that more cases are in the offing.\n\nThe Irish and American authorities are convinced that Noraid money is spent on semiautomatic weapons, carbines, pistols and explosives.\n\n“Hundreds of the deaths in Northern Ireland have resulted from money being collected in the United States being used for the purchase of guns by the I.R.A.,” said Garret FitzGerald, the Irish Foreign Minister. “Every dollar bill contributed to agenctes such as the Irish Northern Aid Committee contributes to the killing of Irish people.”\n\nJohn Hume, a widely respected Catholic politician from Londonderry who has advised Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, on Ulster, said: “Noraid? It's a group that raises money for guns. I haven't seen much evidence of vast sums sent by Noraid being used for relief.”\n\nExactly how much money has been spent to buy arms in the United States remains obscure. But military authorities and IriSh officials believe that since 1971 the bulk of the Provisionals' guns has been smuggled into Ireland—or indirectly through England— on passenger and cargo ships, including the Queen Elizabeth 2, as well as through Aer Lingus, the Irish airline. Suitcases carried by Irish‐American tourists, sloe, cially designed cargo containers with false panels, crates and even coffins have been used to slip weapons into Ireland, with the help of sympathetic—or bribed—longshoremen, crew members and airline and custerns personnel.\n\nThere are estimates that 75 to 90 percent of I.R.A. firepower is of American origin. Though serial numbers are usually filed off gun barrels before they are shipped to Ulster one source in Belfast says that weapons have been traced to nine separate dealers in the United States.\n\nSemiautomatic Is the Favorite\n\nThe favorite I.R.A. weapon is the semiautomatic Armlite AR‐15, which is sold over the counter in the United States for about $260. A seven‐and‐ahalf pound weapon, it is light and easy to break into parts.\n\nSince 1969, when violence erupted in Northern Ireland, 377 soldiers, and paramilitary men have been killed, many in recent years by Armalites. The civilian death toll has just passed 1,000. In Britain:64 persons have been killed and nearly 200 injured since the J.R.A. stepped up its terror tactics three years ago.\n\nThe first major attempt by the Provisionals to import arms was made in April 1970, when intermediaries sought to buy 500 weapons and 180,000 rounds of ammunition from private dealers in Vienna. The plan to fly the weapons to Dublin failed, the shipment was traced and seized, and two leading members of the Irish Government—Minister of Agriculture Neil Blaney, and Minister of Justice Charles Haughey —were dismissed on charges of complicity.\n\nIn the summer of 1970 the first American arms began trickling in, usually in air cargo or packing cases, no more than three or four weapons at a time. At that time the key weapons in the Provisional armory were vintage Thompson submachine guns, the M‐1 carbine, the 45‐caliber automatic pistol and the Lee Enfield .303 for marksmen.\n\nTo streamline its arsenal and find an efficient, uniform assault weapon, the I.R.A. reportedly sent David O'Connell, a long‐time Provisional, and Maria Maguire through Europe in September 1971 with more than $40,000 in banknotes to buy four and one‐half tons of arms. The weapons they bought were reportedly manufactured in Prague.\n\nThe episode ended in semicomic confusion: Most of the banknotes were Irish and nonnegotiable, and the arms were discovered at Schiphol Airport, near Amsterdam. The highly publicized incident embarrassed the I.R.A. even further when Miss Maguire defected and wrote a scornful hook “To Take Arms,” about I.R.A. activities, in 1973.\n\nAt this point, the authorities say, the I.R.A. supported by American funds and money seized in hank robberies in Ulster and the Irish Republic, stopped up its efforts with American supporters. Simultaneously, violence was spreading in Northern Ireland as internment and British Army roundups left the Catholic minority enraged and without a source of support except for the I.R.A.\n\nIn October 1971 the Queen Elizabeth, en route from New York to Le Havre and Southampton, dropped anchor off Cobb, Ireland, to allow a group of New York teachers to disembark. Six large suitcases were left in the customs shed unclaimed, and when the baggage was opened, officials found three Armalites, 37 hand grenades, rifles and ammunition. The suitcases were in the name of G. Walsh, whose firstclass cabin, booked in New York, was unoccupied.\n\nAccording to a United States source, some of these weapons were traced to Edward Agromante, a licensed Yonkers deal. er who runs a shop at 41 Riverdale Avenue. Mr. Agromante, who had several earlier skirmishes with the law, was later indicted for having violated gun laws and served one Yeat in prison.\n\nJames O'Gara, a New York City bus driver who is a Norait member, was indicted for his alleged role in the Queen Eliz abeth smuggling case. Al though he was acquitted of Conspiracy for lack of hare evidence, he was convicted of using false identification i?? connection with four separate purchases of weapons in the New York City area.\n\nAmong other dealers whose weapons have turned up in Northern Ireland are Leslie Edelman Inc., of 75 Sherwood Avenue Farmingdale, L.I.; the Bob and Ed Supermarket of Concord, N.H. and Albert Schneider of New York City, who was convicted of selling weapons without maintaining proper records and was placed on probation.\n\nBuying guns, even Armalifes is legal and easy in the United States. In most states, the purchaser must prove only that he is a resident of the state, is of age and has no criminal record.\n\nSo far the biggest I.R.A. gunrunning prosecution in the United States occurred in Baltimore Iast year when five men were convicted of having illegally bought 158 AR‐15's and 10,000 rounds of ammunition. The men had bought 70 rifles from a Kensington, Md., dealer, —he was indicted for falsifying records—and had transported them as far as Woodside, Queens, where they were arrested.\n\nFour of the men, including Henry Hillick, nicknamed Belfast Harry, a bartender at Fran O'Brien's Lounge in Washington, received six‐year sentences. The dealer got five years.\n\nThe group, which had large amounts of money, had placed a standing order for 100 AR‐15's a month with the local dealer. “Our indication was that money raised by Noraid had been used to partially pay for the AR‐15's,” according to Jeffrey White; United States Attorney for the District of Maryland, who was interviewed by telephone by a reporter in Washington.\n\n“The guns were going to be sent through New York to Northern Ireland in crates labeled as machine, parts,” he said. “They were to be used to what Hillick called, ‘pot the dummies,’ or shoot British soldiers. The case was broken because of Hillick's big mouth. He bragged about the weapons to an undercover agent with the Washington metropolitan police force who was posing as an artist in Irish bars.”\n\nMr. White said that at first Mr. Hillick asked the agent to contribute some of his sketches to Noraid. “Hillick told him the money for the pictures would go for widows and children,” said Mr. White. “Later, when they were friendly, Hillick admitted that the money didn't go for widows but for guns. He admitted this later when he trusted the agent.”\n\nMr. White said:\n\n“The statements [at the trial] didn't actually mention the Irish Northern Aid Committee, but it was clear who was meant. We didn't make distinctions between the two groups [Noraid and the I.R.A.]. Statements made at the trial in reference to the group which came up with the money were to ‘Irish’ and ‘I.R.A.’, but we considered them to Mean the Irish Northern Aid Committee..\n\n“In our investigation it was clear that some of the money for guns came directly or indirectly from the Irish Northern Aid Committee.”\n\nPerhaps the case that touches Noraid closest involves. Frank Grady, a 42‐year‐old former Westchester County chairman of Northern Aid who was indicted in May with John Jankowski, a Yonkers gun dealer, on charges of having violated fireanns laws and illegally exported weapons. Several of the weapons were reportedly seized by British troops in Belfast and were traced to the gun dealer. The case is awaiting trial.\n\nBrandon Alvey, a lawyer in the Criminal Division of the Justice Department, who has overseen the prosecution of most of the gun‐running cases, said: “There's no way of knowing how many guns have been smuggled over there, and when they say the money is going to Widows and children we can't Prove that it doesn't.”\n\n“When you see the impact it's, a horrible thing. But then the groups like the U.D.F. are as bad as the I.R.A.”\n\nThe Ulster Defense Force, the militant Protestant group to which he was referring, receives a large share of its weapons from Canada. The Protestants in Ulster have a considerable tactical advantage over the Catholics. There are 100,000 legal weapons in Northern Ireland, mostly in Protestant hands.\n\nThe Northern Aid Committee was created in 1970, about the time of the bitter cleavage in the I.R.A. between the Marxist Official wing and the breakaway Provisionals, or ProvosIt was the Provos who gained. ascendancy in the Catholic ghettos and touched a nerve among some people in the Irish‐American community.\n\nEssentially the aim of both wings of the I.R.A. is the same elimination of the border between North and South and unification of the six northern counties with the 26 counties in the South. The North has a two‐thirds Protestant majority while the South is overwhelmingly Catholic.\n\nNoraid acknowledges close links with the Provos but insists that funds raised in the Irish community are channeled to the families of Republican prisoners, men and women seeking a united Irish republic.\n\nMichael Flannery, one of the three directors of Noraid who was asked by a reporter in New York about reports that money was going for arms, said: “This is a terrible, malicious lie. If we were to do anything like that we'd be out of business overnight.”\n\nHow Noraid deals with its funds remains puzzling. There are several versions. The group's counterpart in Dublin—where funds are ostensibly, sent — is the Prisdners Dependents Fund, which has an unmarked office at 44 Parnell Square. The bleak downtown building also houses the Provo weekly, An Phoblacht, or The Republican.\n\nMr. Flannery said that most of Noraid's funds were moved by courier, usually $2,000 or $3,000 at a time, but that money was also transferred by bank draft to a Dublin bank, then picked up by someone in the organization.\n\nTess Kearney, who is on the nine‐member board, which meets each Wednesday night, said virtually all the money came in by check to the dependent's fund and was depot sited in a branch of the Leinster and Munster Bank in Dublin. She said the equivalent of $15,000 to $25,000 was distributed each week through local offices in Belfast, Londonderry, Newry and other cities. She estimated that the various groups helped 1,000 families.\n\nAnother‐board member, Thomas Ennis, said that money was deposited in the Allied Irish Bank in Dublin, and that every fortnight 2,000 to 3,000 checks were mailed out from Dublin: $6 for a single dependent, $10 for a family.\n\nThe group's treasurer, Eileen Barrett, said: “Sometimes it comes in by check, sometimes. it goes straight to the bank, sometimes it's cash.” She declined to say in which bank the money was deposited.\n\nNoraid itself has declared in the United States that from 1971 to 1973 approximately $823,500 was remitted, mostly in cash, to three people: Joe Cahill, an I.R.A. leader and reported quartermaster of the Provisionals; Joe Clarke, at 93 the oldest living I.R.A. man, and Kathleen White, of whom little is known.\n\nThe key figure is Mr. Cahill, who was imprisoned in May 1973 on a gun‐running charge after having been seized by the Irish. Navy off Wexford aboard the tramp steamer Claudia. The vessel was carrying 15 tons of arms from Libya.\n\nMr. Cahill was given a threeyear sentence, but was released because of a heart condition. In an interview, he denied that any Noraid money had been used to buy arms. But he said, “There are groups in America outside Northern Aid who support the I.R.A. Naturally we'd prefer not to divulge their names.”\n\nMr. Cahil, whose prison record has barred him from entering the United States to help raise funds, was one of six men convicted in 1942 of the Easter Sunday murder of a Belfast policeman. One I.R.A. man was later executed.\n\nDiscussing the fund Mr. Cahill insisted: “We are purely a relief organization. If the breadwinner is interned or in prison, we help the family, give them money, food, clothes. They need the help and they get it.”\n\nHe added that money from the United States was sent by bank draft to Joe Clarke, and that the funds were taken out under Mr. Clarke's name.\n\nAt the fund's outlet in Belfast, on Springfield Road, in the heart of the Catholic district, a group of cheerful, hard‐working volunteers for the Green Cross, linked to the Provisional I.R.A., distribute money each week to 700 families whose breadwinners are in prison. But much of the money is said to come from contributions in Belfast and only a small part from Dublin.\n\n“When we need it, we ask,” said James McCashin, the chairman of Green Cross. This year, for example, he said, the Green Cross in Belfast received about $40,000 from Dublin, while itself collecting about $200,000 by canvassing at pubs, shops, streetcorners and homes. More than 450 workers collect the money each week and distribute fixed amounts to dependents.\n\nLast Year the group said it distributed about $400,000 to families. Dublin sent less than $60,000 for relief in Belfast, which has the bulk of prisoners' dependents.\n\nVolunteers say, however, that Noraid's money is also distributed to other cities—Newry, Londonderry, Strabane—where local contributions are scarce.\n\nBesides Mr. Flannery, the leaders of Noraid are Matthew Higgins and Jack McCarthy. Like Mr. Flannery, they are in their mid‐70's and veterans of 1919‐21 strife in Ireland. They all live in Jackson Heights, queens. The three make it clear that relief for the families of Republican prisoners is entwined with the effort to drive the British troops out of Ulster and force the reunion of North and South.\n\n“We first have to take care of the needs of the dependents,” said Mr. Higgins. “If that fails, everything fails. If the dependents become dissatisfied, then the whole thing collapses like a house of cards. And that is to be avoided at all costs.”\n\nDiscussing the possibility of using money for weapons, Mr. Higgins said: “We have no objections to it if they have money to spare. They've got to get them somewhere. If the over‐all kitty is big enough to buy weapons, that's their business.\n\n“We were formed for the purpose of supporting the Irishfreedom movement,” he continued. “We still support the Provisional I.R.A., no ifs, ands, or buts about that.”\n\nNoraid cairns to have 80 chapters in the United States—14 in New York—and spokesmen say there are 80,000 members. A senior Irish Government source calls the membership figure “an absurd exaggeration,” and says it is probably an estimate of people attending social functions. There are believed to be 2,000 active members.\n\nIn January 1971 Noraid registerect under the Foreign Registration Act and was obliged to divulge details about contributions after losing a legal struggle in which the group Was represented by the law firm of Paul O'Dwyer, now City Council president. Mr. O'Dwyer's firm also represented 12 persons, before a grand jury in Fort Worth Tex., that was investigating alleged smuggling of American arms to Ulster. Five of these were held in jail for 10 months on contempt charges for refusing to answer questions.\n\nMr. O'Dwyet:, who was born in County Mayo in 1907, has maintained a warm relationship with Noraid as well as the Irish National Caucus, a Washington pressure group. Its executive director Sean Walsh, is registered as an agent of the Provisional Sinn Fein, the I.R.A.'s political wing.\n\nMr. O'Dwyer said of Noraid: “I know the people who are in the committee quite well and I think they're good people.” Asked whether he knew how contributions were used, he reptried: “No, I do not. They say they use the money for charitable purposes. There are hundreds of people incarcerated and women and children who have to be supported.”\n\nThis dispatch was prepared with the‐assistance of Joseph B. Treaster in New York and John M. Crewdson in Washington."
