He was also welcomed by his adoring older sister and brother, Kathleen and Robert, lovingly known as “Bobby”. Throughout the course of their lives, they have always been the “three musketeers”.

They were his entire world. After 32 years of marriage Roberta and Bill divorced, however they remained friends and had a deep love and respect for one another.\n\nIn 2011, he married his second love, his wife Kathy.

He had the added bonus of a step-daughter, Nicole. Nicole and her beloved sons Kaleb and Nolan brought such great joy to him. He finally achieved his dream of having “boys”. He enjoyed making memories with them.\n\nBill was loved by all who knew him. He had a vivacious personality with a big warm smile that would light up his face. His hugs would engulf you. He was the unsung hero who would help anyone in need. He would gratefully give you the shirt off his back if you needed it more than him. He never forgot where he came from and always believed your word means everything. He will be dearly missed. We will carry him in our hearts each and every day.Bill was blessed to have a lifelong childhood friend Tommy Lentini, who he lovingly called “Nuke”. They were the best of friends for the last 71 years. Their friendship has stood the test of time. The bond they shared was truly rare. Bill was blessed beyond measure by his friendship with Tommy.
