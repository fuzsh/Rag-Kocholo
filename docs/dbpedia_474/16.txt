Monsignor Joseph Edward O'Brien (1884-1986) was born in Carbonear to John and Ellen (Cahill) O'Brien. He was educated at St. Bonaventure's College and All Hallow's College, Ireland. O'Brien studied for the Roman Catholic priesthood in Dublin and was ordained in 1910. Upon his return to Newfoundland, O'Brien took up parish duties at Tilting on Fogo Island. In 1914 he was transferred to the parish of Northern Bay, which was then responsible for Labrador. He made his first visit to North West River/Sheshatshiu in 1921, and thereafter spent more than 20 summers with the Innu of Sheshatshiu and Davis Inlet, to whom he was affectionately known as Father Whitehead because of his prematurely gray hair. His priesthood in Labrador was marked by tireless work for the poor. With financial assistance from the Knights of Columbus in St. John's he provided clothing and supplies. He also arranged for the Hudson's Bay Company to give food to families on government account. In 1946, Labrador was separated from the diocese in Harbour Grace, but O'Brien continued to serve at Northern Bay, retiring in 1970. He was a keen photographer, and his pictures of Innu life were donated to the National Film Archives. O'Brien died at the age of 101, being the oldest Roman Catholic priest in Canada at the time.
