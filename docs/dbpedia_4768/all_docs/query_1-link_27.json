        "text": "I see, I have to elaborate to make myself clear enough, to not be misunderstood.\n\nI’ll try to elaborate using examples.\n\nHumans have a hard life. They shouldn’t be bothered with more problems, than they need to. I think, everyone agrees with that.\n\nProgramming languages deliver ways of talking to a computer. By using them, a human is able to instruct a computer to do certain actions and operations; deliver results.\n\nLife was hard. When a couple of kilobytes RAM and a 100MB HDD were immensely huge and expensive, life was hard in the computer world. It was a wild and tough world. Small, too, but that makes it even tougher, as fewer members would be able to support you in issues. Most of the time, you were alone reading a 500 page physical book about computers in a library.\n\nLuckily, life got easier. We got more RAM. We got more CPU power. We got cheaper PCs. I think, if you look at the Raspberry Pi project, enough is said. You know, life has progressed. Life has improved.\n\nBack then, there was ALGOL 68.\n\nHell, most of you veterans even extensively programmed in Assembly!\n\nTell that to someone, who just started out with Python or whatever… It’s a different world, with easier ways for humans to interact with computers.\n\nWe got rid of FORTRAN. It has no significant impact in the world of popular and most used languages around the world. It’s mostly used for legacy projects and for special purposes, but it’s not a general purpose language, one picks for a new project. In fact, I haven’t seen a single new project written in FORTRAN and I also have never seen any project made with FORTRAN on Github, by accident. I would need to explicitly search for one, to find one.\n\nWe got rid COBOL. It’s pretty much only used for maintaining very old legacy projects, often in the finance sector. Nobody will use COBOL for a new project. For good reasons, there are much better and modern alternatives, fitting our current world.\n\nOf course, we also got rid of all ALGOL and the different versions of it. Antiquated, complicated, old. It reeks of 80 year olds talking about post-war programming.\n\nI hope you get where I am getting it by now…\n\nWe are progressing. We are going further. We are improving the computer world. Every single day, the world uses more and more computers for any task. The world becomes computerised. We need modern and fitting technology for today, to be able to properly solve today’s tasks. Not the tasks from 50 years ago…\n\nNow, we made progress everywhere. We got rid of shit. We got rid of huge monolithic projects. Pretty much all new projects I know of are written in Microservices or similar architectures. We use Kubernetes. Docker. We use all the new shit. Well, at least for new projects. I admin, there are more than enough legacy projects out there, doing the same mistakes since 20 years, just because it wasn’t a mistake yet, 20 years ago.\n\nNow, in all this hype, all this luck, all this modernity, all this looking forward, we are stuck with C in the systems programming market. What the hell?\n\nI ask you, do you want to program in Assembly?! HELL NO!\n\nI ask you, do you want to program in COBOL?! HELL NO!\n\nI ask you! DO YOU WANT TO PROGRAM IN ALGOL 68?! HEEEEELL NOOO!!!\n\nI ask you, do you want to program in C…\n\nAnd there it is. Suddenly, some people from somewhere below, wake up and start raising their bodies. Zombies? Sleeping elitists? Bearded men trapped in a mount’s crevice? Or maybe just harmless oldies, who did not take their meds?\n\nNot sure, if this mystery will ever be solved… To be continued…\n\nDo they come from deep underground caves, having slept for the past 30 years? Or did they literally raise from ground, below a forest? We won’t ever know this…\n\nAnyway. They start saying “yes, I mean, there are reasons… bla… bla… blabla…”. And I’m just standing there, shocked, and say to myself WHAT THE FUCK!!…\n\n“We have Rust, we have Nim, we have Go, and counting! We have so many alternatives… For every flavour of systems programming, you have your take. YES!!! Even for speed. Rust and Nim do not show any notable impact on performance, in all tests performed to this day.” I scream.\n\n“But C has been there forever… bla… amount of libraries… bla…blabla… compatibility with existing… blalblalglblsdfljhadsfjlhfsdascvcc…” they mutter.\n\nLike, with this attitude of these dumb or elitist pricks, we would still be stuck with COBOL and ALGOL 58!! We wouldn’t have gotten Java, Go, C#, etc… Heck, even Python. I hate Python, but it’s sure as hell better than any line of production C code, I have ever read in my life.\n\nThere is a reason we got rid of COBOL and its friends. Back then, it was fine for the time and its context. Now, it’s just crap, we don’t want to use.\n\nDespite all that, we still have people, who think C is a valid programming language in 2022. It’s not. It hasn’t been for the past 10 years.\n\nIt was fine back, when it was created. In fact, it was a bit revolutionary. But knocks on your head wake up! This was decades ago!\n\nC is so cancerous and so hated by myself, because it keeps popping up everywhere. It’s everywhere on Github. It’s everywhere in production, around the world. So many projects are polluted with this pest.\n\nIt seems like you cannot get rid of this viral infection. Sure, even Linux has a huge impact on this. And this is also what I hate about Linux. It promotes the usage, at least indirectly, of some antiquated shitty ass language, which should’ve been buried at least 10 years ago.\n\nThere is a reason the word cancer starts with a C!\n\nNow, to put the cherry on top of this rant, here is a tiny example, representing the very tip of the iceberg. The 1 nanometer wide very tip of the iceberg; the whole iceberg being bigger than all mountains on earth united…\n\nint main() { int a; }\n\nWhat is this? What the hell is that? What is a?"
