        "text": "John Backus has received the 1993 National Academy of Engineering's Charles Stark Draper Prize in recognition of his development of FORTRAN, a programming language used throughout science and industry.\n\nThe Draper Prize is given for engineering achievement that contributes to human welfare and freedom. In developing FORTRAN, Backus not only developed a new computer language, he helped to create an entire industry that would benefit from its use. FORTRAN provided the framework for the development of most high-level programming languages and has been used for everything from video games, air traffic control systems, payroll calculations, and compiler writing. High-level computer languages now form the base of a $23 billion software industry.\n\nIn 1950, Backus began work at IBM, where he helped design the IBM 701 and 704 computers in addition to the FORTRAN I and II optimizing compilers. He has also helped to design Algol 58 and Algol 60. Backus was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1974 and the National Academy of Engineering in 1977. In addition to the Draper Prize, he has received the McDowell Award and the Turing Award for his contributions to computer science.\n\nTable of Contents"
