Algol - Free download as PDF File (.pdf), Text File (.txt) or read online for free. 1) Algol-60 was created in 1960 by an international committee to establish a universal programming language as a successor to FORTRAN that was not dependent on any specific computing platform. \n2) Algol-60 had a hierarchical, block-structured syntax defined using Backus-Naur Form (BNF) which allowed statements and other language constructs to be nested. \n3) Key features included support for procedural abstraction, conditionals, loops, arrays and other basic programming constructs while avoiding features like input/output which were platform dependent.",
