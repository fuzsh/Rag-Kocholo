This document outlines the genealogy and evolution of the FORTRAN and PASCAL programming languages from 1957 to 2008. It describes the key features and merits and demerits of each version. FORTRAN began in 1957 and has continued evolving with new versions added every 10-20 years. PASCAL was influenced by early versions of FORTRAN and ALGOL and was created in 1971 by Niklaus Wirth.",
