        "text": "Current conditions\n\nAccording to information provided by key informants, well-distributed precipitation over mid- to higher elevations after mid-March has improved the condition of both rainfed and irrigated wheat in the country. Favorable conditions for rainfed wheat in the northern rainfed wheat belt and irrigated wheat in the central have been reported. Vegetation conditions are likely to improve, although may remain below average through September 2023 due to the lingering effects of three consecutive droughts since the 2020/21 wet season.\n\nPrecipitation\n\nBelow-average precipitation (60-90% of average) prevails across most of the country while near-average precipitation conditions persist in rainfed wheat belt in central and northeastern parts of the country as of April 15 (Figure 1).\n\nSnow depth and snow water volume\n\nAs of April 16, 2023, below-average snow depth prevailed over most of the country (Figure 2). Precipitation observed from mid-March through early April has led to minor increases in SWV levels in many northern, western, and southern basins in the country. Figure 3 highlights rise in SWV levels after mid-March in Arghandab (south), Hari Rod (west), Kabul (east), and Kunduz (north) basins. Near minimum SWV is observed in Arghandab basin as of April 16, while Hari Rod, Kabul, and Kunduz basins still show below average conditions which have prevailed through much of the season (Figure 3).\n\nPrecipitation\n\nECMWF forecasts above-average precipitation in southern and eastern parts of the country while the northern parts of the country bordering Iran, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and Tajikistan are expected to receive below-average precipitation during the week April 17 – 24, 2023. There is no tilt towards above- or below average precipitation in the central portions of the country during this period (Figure 4, left inset). During the week April 24 – May 1, 2023, there is a high probability of above average precipitation in the western and southern parts of the country while average to slightly below-average precipitation in the northern, northeastern, and eastern parts of the country (Figure 4, right inset) are expected.\n\nTemperatures\n\nThe NMME forecast for May-July 2023 indicates above average temperature in most parts of the country except for isolated parts in the south. Crops are most likely to be subjected to moisture stress conditions due to the above average temperatures during this period. Precipitation during late March and April would be favorable to rainfed wheat in its flowering stage and pastures. Below average snow melt runoff may most likely create reduced water availability for irrigated wheat (during its critical flowering and grain hardening stages). Areas impacted by two consecutive drought years are expected to experience the worst pasture conditions and largest negative anomalies relative to other areas of the country. Second crop cultivation may be adversely affected due to the ongoing hydrological drought conditions in the country. Chances of widespread flooding are less-than-normal while there may be chances of isolated flash flooding in spring depending on the extent of spring rainfall and temperature during the rest of the season."
