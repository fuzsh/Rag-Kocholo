        "text": "January is a fantastic time of year to visit Laos, and you can expect warm, sunny days and low rainfall. Average temperatures are a comfortable 24°C in Vientiane and Luang Prabang, whilst in Pakse and the southern regions, it’s slightly warmer with highs of 30°C. If you plan to explore the higher altitude regions in the north and east of the country or are stopping in Pakbeng on a cruise along the Mekong River, you should expect cooler temperatures (15°C), especially at night.\n\nThe dry season continues in March. It will start to get hotter across the country, with temperatures rising to over 30°C in Vientiane and Luang Prabang and 32°C further to the south in Pakse and the 4000 Islands region. The heat can make sightseeing a little uncomfortable, so you may wish to head out on sightseeing excursions early in the morning and then return to your hotel from 11 am-3 pm to avoid the hottest time of the day.\n\nMarch is a good time to visit the Bolaven Plateau in southern Laos, as the elevation offers respite from the high temperatures.\n\nApril is one of the hottest months of the year in Laos, and temperatures can reach 40°C, especially in Pakse and the 4000 Islands region in the south of the country. Temperatures average around 30°C in Vientiane and Luang Prabang.\n\nTowards the end of April, rain showers become more likely as the wet season approaches, especially in the northern regions around Phongsali; however, the heavy downpours tend to be short-lived and shouldn’t affect your trip.\n\nThe first half of May is usually relatively dry; however, the wet season starts later in the month. The short, heavy showers shouldn’t affect your trip too much, and the intense downpours are quickly replaced by blue skies and sunshine - although in the south, longer downpours can be expected. If you can avoid the rain as best as possible, May can be a fantastic month to visit Laos, and there’s the added bonus that visitor numbers are much lower than in previous months.\n\nJune sees the start of the wet season in Laos; however, it is still considered a good month to visit, and you can expect blue skies and sunshine between the heavy showers, which tend to last for just a few hours rather than all day.\n\nThe rain is usually heavier the higher you are, with the riverside towns south of Vientiane experiencing the least rain. You should expect average temperatures around 25-27°C, with Pakse experiencing warmer temperatures than Luang Prabang and Vientiane and slightly cooler conditions in Phongsali in the north.\n\nIf you travel to Laos in July you should expect heavy rain, although the downpours tend to last for a few hours rather than all day and there can still be plenty of dry days. In Pakse and the south, rainfall can be heavier and last longer, which means the waterfalls in the 4000 Islands are at their best. Despite overcast skies, average temperatures in Luang Prabang and Vientiane hover around 25-27°C.\n\nThis is the height of the rainy season, and if you visit Laos during August, you should expect intense downpours almost every day.\n\nDespite overcast skies, average temperatures in Luang Prabang and Vientiane range from 25-30°C. In Luang Prabang, the downpours only last for short periods, usually in the afternoon, so it is still a good time to visit. During August, southern highlights such as the 4000 Islands remain accessible by boat, with the region’s waterfalls at their most impressive.\n\nThe weather in September is much the same as in August. Heavy downpours are highly likely, although the rain will start to subside later in the month as the dry season approaches and sunshine replace the grey overcast skies. Temperatures begin to drop with averages of 26°C in Luang Prabang and Vientiane, and 27°C in Pakse and the southern provinces. Laos is at its most picturesque in September as the countryside is lush and green following months of rain, and the waterfalls are at their best.\n\nOctober is a good time to visit Laos as the weather is mostly dry and sunny, and the temperatures are comfortable. You can expect temperatures of 25°C in Luang Prabang and Vientiane, and 26°C in Pakse and the southern provinces. In Phongsali and the mountainous regions, cooler weather should be expected, especially at night, and you should pack suitable warm clothing. Tourist numbers remain low during the first half of October, so it’s a great time to visit if you want to avoid the crowds.\n\nNovember is a popular month to visit Laos. You can expect very little rainfall, plenty of sunshine and moderate temperatures - an average of 23°C in Vientiane and Luang Prabang and 26°C in Pakse and the 4000 Islands. This is the peak tourism season, so if you’re planning to travel in November, please ensure that you book well in advance to guarantee availability at your preferred accommodation.\n\nDecember falls within the dry season, which is also known as the cool season. The weather is excellent throughout Laos in December - rain is unlikely, and you can expect plenty of blue skies and sunshine and average temperatures of 19-22°C.\n\nIt is the most popular time of year to visit Vientiane and Luang Prabang. This is the peak tourism season so if you’re planning to travel in December, especially over the Christmas period, please ensure that you book well in advance to guarantee availability at your preferred accommodation."
