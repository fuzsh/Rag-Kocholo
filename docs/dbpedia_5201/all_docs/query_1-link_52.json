        "text": "Safety and security\n\nSecurity situation\n\nSeveral terrorist groups remain active in Afghanistan. The intensity and frequency of the attacks have significantly increased since August 2021, resulting in numerous casualties.\n\nForeigners and individuals associated to Western countries are targets for kidnappings and violence by terrorist groups.\n\nThe security situation is highly volatile and additional violent attacks could occur at any time across the country. Criminals are also taking advantage of the unstable security situation to commit violent attacks.\n\nTravelling throughout the country is extremely dangerous, including in Kabul. There are checkpoints on all roads and throughout cities. Women are not allowed to travel by themselves and often face difficulties at checkpoints. Some borders are closed or may close without notice. Border crossing is risky due to criminal groups and smugglers.\n\nKeep in mind that you are responsible for your own safety and that of your family.\n\nIf you are in Afghanistan:\n\nexercise caution and be aware of your surroundings\n\nuse your judgement to decide the best time and the safest means of exit if you need to move to a safer location\n\nmonitor international media to stay informed about the latest developments and decrees\n\nThe Embassy of Canada in Afghanistan has suspended its operations. The Government of Canada’s ability to provide consular assistance in this country is extremely limited. If you have successfully made your way out of the country and require consular assistance, contact the nearest Canadian office.\n\nSince August 2021, the authorities have issued a series of decrees to regulate acceptable behaviors according to their strict interpretation of Islam.\n\nFreedoms, including of expression and assembly, have been significantly reduced. All forms of dissent and criticism of the authorities, including by journalists and activists from civil society, may result in arbitrary arrest and unlawful detention.\n\nProtestors against the restrictions imposed by the authorities risk arrests, detentions, physical violence and abuse and being charged with ‘’moral corruption’’. Security forces use several violent methods of dispersing protests, including water cannons, tear gas, and firing live bullets.\n\nSecurity forces strongly repress demonstrations and frequently arrest participants. They are often detained and face psychological and physical abuse.\n\nTerrorism and criminal violence\n\nAttacks in Kabul occur often. There’s an extremely high and continuous threat of terrorism and criminal violence. Terrorists and criminals carry out attacks throughout the country, including all major cities. These attacks are not restricted to particular areas of those cities, they can occur in reputable public areas frequented by foreigners, particularly at the Serena Hotel. No location in Afghanistan can be considered safe or exempt from the threat of attack.\n\nExtremist organizations continue to plan attacks against a variety of targets in Afghanistan. There is a heightened risk of attacks targeting:\n\nforeigners\n\nwestern interests\n\nhuman rights defenders\n\njournalists and media workers\n\njudges and prosecutors\n\nreligious scholars\n\nhealthcare workers\n\npolitical analysts\n\npolice officers\n\ncivil servants\n\nother civilians\n\nAttacks are completely unpredictable. Targets could include:\n\ngovernment buildings, including schools\n\nsecurity and defence personnel\n\nplaces of worship\n\nairports and other transportation hubs and networks\n\npublic areas such as tourist attractions, restaurants, coffee shops, shopping centres, markets, hotels, medical facilities and other sites frequented by foreigners\n\nIn addition to targeted attacks, terrorist groups periodically fire multiple unguided rockets into central Kabul. These rockets are generally aimed at the airport, the Serena Hotel, embassies, and government or military facilities but can land anywhere in the central area of the city.\n\nIf you are in Afghanistan:\n\nalways be aware of your surroundings when in public places\n\nexercise extreme caution at all times\n\nbe particularly vigilant during and prior to days of national significance\n\nTypes of violent attacks\n\nTactics used by criminals include body- and vehicle-borne improvised explosive devices and firing rockets. Armed assaults and ambushes are also common.\n\nOther types of violent attack also occur, including armed robbery, carjacking and sexual and gender-based violence and harassment. Weapons are readily available throughout the country and the number of civilian causalities is high.\n\nAvoid showing signs of affluence or carrying large sums of money\n\nEnsure that your personal belongings, passports and other travel documents are secure at all times\n\nKidnapping\n\nKidnapping for ransom has become a lucrative practice. There’s an extreme risk of kidnapping of foreign nationals. Criminals have kidnapped and sometimes killed Westerners, including tourists, journalists, teachers, doctors and non-government organization workers. Journalists may be lured with offers of interviews, when the real purpose is to kidnap them.\n\nSeveral organizations, including terrorist groups and criminal gangs, are responsible for these kidnappings. These groups will target anyone perceived to have money for kidnapping or extortion purposes. Kidnap-for-ransom groups may also sell their captives to terrorist groups, with victims potentially facing years in captivity.\n\nDemonstrations\n\nDemonstrations, including anti-Western demonstrations and civil unrest, may occur throughout Afghanistan. Some demonstrations have become violent and have suffered terrorist attacks, causing death and injury. Demonstrations can also lead to disruptions to traffic and public transportation.\n\nAvoid areas where demonstrations and large gatherings are taking place\n\nFollow the instructions of local authorities\n\nMonitor local media for information on ongoing demonstrations\n\nMore about mass gatherings (large-scale events)\n\nLandmines\n\nMillions of landmines pose a severe threat throughout the countryside. No area is safe.\n\nRoad safety\n\nRoad conditions and road safety are poor throughout the country. Drivers often drive at excessive speeds. Drivers are aggressive and reckless. Drivers do not respect traffic laws, and Afghan police do not enforce them.\n\nAccidents causing fatalities are common.\n\nOverland travel\n\nOverland travel is extremely dangerous, including in Kabul. Banditry by armed groups is common. Terrorist and criminal groups may set up fake checkpoints and road-blocks with the intent of robbery, kidnapping or other violent attacks. Military and police forces are inadequate.\n\nAvoid undertaking overland travel unless you’re accompanied by armed security guards\n\nPlan any road travel very carefully\n\nAlways travel in groups\n\nAir travel\n\nWe do not make assessments on the compliance of foreign domestic airlines with international safety standards.\n\nInformation about foreign domestic airlines\n\nWomen’s safety\n\nWomen are at a particularly higher risk of harassment and abuse, including from the authorities. They must strictly abide by specific rules and behaviors, including:\n\ntravelling and going to public places with a male guardian (mahram), such as a brother, father or husband\n\ncovering from head-to-toe\n\nWomen will likely face challenges when trying to interact with authorities.\n\nWomen are expressly prohibited from many places including:\n\npublic parks\n\namusement parks\n\npublic baths\n\nBand-e-Amir National Park\n\nSome regions enforce restrictions imposed on women and girls more strictly than others. Kandahar province enforces the decrees particularly strictly.\n\nAfghan authorities have detained women who have reported a sexual assault. Women must prove that the sex was not consensual to avoid criminal charges under extramarital sex statutes. Legal and medical services are not widely available for women in the event of sexual assault.\n\nAdvice for women travellers\n\nForced marriages\n\nForced marriage affecting foreigners occur. It sometimes occurs without the affected person’s prior knowledge or consent.\n\nGeneral information and advice about forced marriage\n\nAdvice for women travellers\n\nGeneral safety information\n\nBe aware that:\n\nbasic infrastructure services such as electricity and telephones are minimal, even in urban areas\n\nfood and water shortages are common\n\nforeigners should avoid travelling at night\n\nthere is no safe area with adequate police coverage\n\nHealth\n\nRelevant Travel Health Notices\n\nGlobal Measles Notice - 13 March, 2024\n\nCOVID-19 and International Travel - 13 March, 2024\n\nPolio: Advice for travellers - 3 July, 2024\n\nThis section contains information on possible health risks and restrictions regularly found or ongoing in the destination. Follow this advice to lower your risk of becoming ill while travelling. Not all risks are listed below.\n\nConsult a health care professional or visit a travel health clinic preferably 6 weeks before you travel to get personalized health advice and recommendations.\n\nRoutine vaccines\n\nBe sure that your routine vaccinations, as per your province or territory, are up-to-date before travelling, regardless of your destination.\n\nSome of these vaccinations include measles-mumps-rubella (MMR), diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, polio, varicella (chickenpox), influenza and others.\n\nPre-travel vaccines and medications\n\nYou may be at risk for preventable diseases while travelling in this destination. Talk to a travel health professional about which medications or vaccines may be right for you, based on your destination and itinerary.\n\nYellow Fever - Country Entry Requirements\n\nYellow fever is a disease caused by a flavivirus from the bite of an infected mosquito.\n\nTravellers get vaccinated either because it is required to enter a country or because it is recommended for their protection.\n\nRisk\n\nThere is no risk of yellow fever in this country.\n\nCountry Entry Requirement*\n\nProof of vaccination is not required to enter this country.\n\nRecommendation\n\nVaccination is not recommended.\n\n* It is important to note that country entry requirements may not reflect your risk of yellow fever at your destination. It is recommended that you contact the nearest diplomatic or consular office of the destination(s) you will be visiting to verify any additional entry requirements.\n\nAbout Yellow Fever\n\nYellow Fever Vaccination Centres in Canada\n\nHepatitis A\n\nThere is a risk of hepatitis A in this destination. It is a disease of the liver. People can get hepatitis A if they ingest contaminated food or water, eat foods prepared by an infectious person, or if they have close physical contact (such as oral-anal sex) with an infectious person, although casual contact among people does not spread the virus.\n\nPractise safe food and water precautions and wash your hands often. Vaccination is recommended for all travellers to areas where hepatitis A is present.\n\nMalaria\n\nMalaria is a serious and sometimes fatal disease that is caused by parasites spread through the bites of mosquitoes.\n\nThere is a risk of malaria in certain areas and/or during a certain time of year in this destination.\n\nAntimalarial medication may be recommended depending on your itinerary and the time of year you are travelling. Consult a health care professional or visit a travel health clinic before travelling to discuss your options. It is recommended to do this 6 weeks before travel, however, it is still a good idea any time before leaving.\n\nProtect yourself from mosquito bites at all times:\n\n• Cover your skin and use an approved insect repellent on uncovered skin.\n\n• Exclude mosquitoes from your living area with screening and/or closed, well-sealed doors and windows.\n\n• Use insecticide-treated bed nets if mosquitoes cannot be excluded from your living area.\n\n• Wear permethrin-treated clothing.\n\nIf you develop symptoms similar to malaria when you are travelling or up to a year after you return home, see a health care professional immediately. Tell them where you have been travelling or living.\n\nRabies\n\nIn this destination, rabies is commonly carried by dogs and some wildlife, including bats. Rabies is a deadly disease that spreads to humans primarily through bites or scratches from an infected animal. While travelling, take precautions, including keeping your distance from animals (including free-roaming dogs), and closely supervising children.\n\nIf you are bitten or scratched by a dog or other animal while travelling, immediately wash the wound with soap and clean water and see a health care professional. In this destination, rabies treatment may be limited or may not be available, therefore you may need to return to Canada for treatment.\n\nBefore travel, discuss rabies vaccination with a health care professional. It may be recommended for travellers who are at high risk of exposure (e.g., occupational risk such as veterinarians and wildlife workers, children, adventure travellers and spelunkers, and others in close contact with animals).\n\nPolio – WHO Temporary Recommendations\n\nPolio (poliomyelitis) is an infectious disease that can be prevented by vaccination. It is caused by poliovirus type 1, 2 or 3. Wild poliovirus (WPV1) and/or circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPV1 or cVDPV3)) is/are present in this destination.\n\nThis destination is subject to Temporary Recommendations under the World Health Organization’s polio Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC).\n\nPolio is spread from person to person and through contaminated food and water. Infection with the polio virus can cause paralysis and death in individuals of any age who are not immune.\n\nRecommendations:\n\nBe sure that your polio vaccinations are up to date before travelling. Polio is part of the routine vaccine schedule for children in Canada.\n\nOne booster dose of the polio vaccine is recommended as an adult.\n\nMake sure that the polio vaccinations are documented on the International Certificate of Vaccination or Prophylaxis. This is the only document accepted as proof of vaccination. It is provided at Yellow Fever Vaccination Centres.\n\nCarry the certificate as proof of vaccination.\n\nProof of vaccination:\n\nTravellers who are visiting for longer than 4 weeks may be required to receive a dose of polio vaccine 1 to 12 months before they leave this destination. This may be required even if you have previously received all the recommended polio vaccine doses as part of the routine vaccine schedule in Canada.\n\nMake sure that the polio vaccination is documented on the International Certificate of Vaccination or Prophylaxis.\n\nMeasles\n\nMeasles is a highly contagious viral disease. It can spread quickly from person to person by direct contact and through droplets in the air.\n\nAnyone who is not protected against measles is at risk of being infected with it when travelling internationally.\n\nRegardless of where you are going, talk to a health care professional before travelling to make sure you are fully protected against measles.\n\nHepatitis B\n\nHepatitis B is a risk in every destination. It is a viral liver disease that is easily transmitted from one person to another through exposure to blood and body fluids containing the hepatitis B virus. Travellers who may be exposed to blood or other bodily fluids (e.g., through sexual contact, medical treatment, sharing needles, tattooing, acupuncture or occupational exposure) are at higher risk of getting hepatitis B.\n\nHepatitis B vaccination is recommended for all travellers. Prevent hepatitis B infection by practicing safe sex, only using new and sterile drug equipment, and only getting tattoos and piercings in settings that follow public health regulations and standards.\n\nInfluenza\n\nThe best way to protect yourself from seasonal influenza (flu) is to get vaccinated every year. Get the flu shot at least 2 weeks before travelling.\n\nThe flu occurs worldwide.\n\nIn the Northern Hemisphere, the flu season usually runs from November to April.\n\nIn the Southern Hemisphere, the flu season usually runs between April and October.\n\nIn the tropics, there is flu activity year round.\n\nThe flu vaccine available in one hemisphere may only offer partial protection against the flu in the other hemisphere.\n\nThe flu virus spreads from person to person when they cough or sneeze or by touching objects and surfaces that have been contaminated with the virus. Clean your hands often and wear a mask if you have a fever or respiratory symptoms.\n\nCOVID-19\n\nCoronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious viral disease. It can spread from person to person by direct contact and through droplets in the air.\n\nIt is recommended that all eligible travellers complete a COVID-19 vaccine series along with any additional recommended doses in Canada before travelling. Evidence shows that vaccines are very effective at preventing severe illness, hospitalization and death from COVID-19. While vaccination provides better protection against serious illness, you may still be at risk of infection from the virus that causes COVID-19. Anyone who has not completed a vaccine series is at increased risk of being infected with the virus that causes COVID-19 and is at greater risk for severe disease when travelling internationally.\n\nBefore travelling, verify your destination’s COVID-19 vaccination entry/exit requirements. Regardless of where you are going, talk to a health care professional before travelling to make sure you are adequately protected against COVID-19.\n\nTyphoid\n\nTyphoid is a bacterial infection spread by contaminated food or water. Travellers going to countries in South Asia should speak to a health care professional about getting vaccinated.\n\nSafe food and water precautions\n\nMany illnesses can be caused by eating food or drinking beverages contaminated by bacteria, parasites, toxins, or viruses, or by swimming or bathing in contaminated water.\n\nLearn more about food and water precautions to take to avoid getting sick by visiting our eat and drink safely abroad page. Remember: Boil it, cook it, peel it, or leave it!\n\nAvoid getting water into your eyes, mouth or nose when swimming or participating in activities in freshwater (streams, canals, lakes), particularly after flooding or heavy rain. Water may look clean but could still be polluted or contaminated.\n\nAvoid inhaling or swallowing water while bathing, showering, or swimming in pools or hot tubs.\n\nCholera\n\nRisk\n\nCholera is a risk in parts of this country. Most travellers are at very low risk.\n\nTo protect against cholera, all travellers should practise safe food and water precautions.\n\nTravellers at higher risk of getting cholera include those:\n\nvisiting, working or living in areas with limited access to safe food, water and proper sanitation\n\nvisiting areas where outbreaks are occurring\n\nVaccination may be recommended for high-risk travellers, and should be discussed with a health care professional.\n\nTravellers' diarrhea\n\nTravellers' diarrhea is the most common illness affecting travellers. It is spread from eating or drinking contaminated food or water.\n\nRisk of developing travellers' diarrhea increases when travelling in regions with poor standards of hygiene and sanitation. Practise safe food and water precautions.\n\nThe most important treatment for travellers' diarrhea is rehydration (drinking lots of fluids). Carry oral rehydration salts when travelling.\n\nTyphoid\n\nTyphoid is a bacterial infection spread by contaminated food or water. Risk is higher among children, travellers going to rural areas, travellers visiting friends and relatives or those travelling for a long period of time.\n\nTravellers visiting regions with a risk of typhoid, especially those exposed to places with poor sanitation, should speak to a health care professional about vaccination.\n\nInsect bite prevention\n\nMany diseases are spread by the bites of infected insects such as mosquitoes, ticks, fleas or flies. When travelling to areas where infected insects may be present:\n\nUse insect repellent (bug spray) on exposed skin\n\nCover up with light-coloured, loose clothes made of tightly woven materials such as nylon or polyester\n\nMinimize exposure to insects\n\nUse mosquito netting when sleeping outdoors or in buildings that are not fully enclosed\n\nTo learn more about how you can reduce your risk of infection and disease caused by bites, both at home and abroad, visit our insect bite prevention page.\n\nFind out what types of insects are present where you’re travelling, when they’re most active, and the symptoms of the diseases they spread.\n\nChikungunya\n\nThere is a risk of chikungunya in this country. The level of risk may vary by:\n\nseason\n\nyear\n\nregion\n\nelevation\n\nThe virus that causes chikungunya is spread through the bite of an infected mosquito. It can cause fever and pain in the joints. In some cases, the joint pain can be severe and last for months or years.\n\nProtect yourself from mosquito bites at all times.\n\nLearn more:\n\nInsect bite and pest prevention\n\nChikungunya\n\nCrimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever\n\nCrimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever is a viral disease that can cause fever, pain and bleeding under the skin. In some cases, it can be fatal. It spreads to humans through contact with infected animal blood or tissues, or from the bite of an infected tick. Risk is generally low for most travellers. Celebrations which include the slaughtering of animals and contact with their blood and/ or tissues may increase the risk of exposure to the virus.\n\nProtect yourself from tick bites and wear gloves or other protective clothing if you are in contact with the blood and tissues of animals, particularly livestock. There is no vaccine available for Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever.\n\nDengue\n\nIn this country, risk of dengue is sporadic. It is a viral disease spread to humans by mosquito bites.\n\nDengue can cause flu-like symptoms. In some cases, it can lead to severe dengue, which can be fatal.\n\nThe level of risk of dengue changes seasonally, and varies from year to year. The level of risk also varies between regions in a country and can depend on the elevation in the region.\n\nMosquitoes carrying dengue typically bite during the daytime, particularly around sunrise and sunset.\n\nProtect yourself from mosquito bites. There is no vaccine or medication that protects against dengue fever.\n\nCutaneous and mucosal Leishmaniasis\n\nCutaneous and mucosal leishmaniasis causes skin sores and ulcers. It is caused by a parasite spread through the bite of a female sandfly.\n\nRisk is generally low for most travellers. Protect yourself from sandfly bites, which typically occur after sunset in rural and forested areas and in some urban centres. There is no vaccine or medication to protect against leishmaniasis.\n\nAnimal precautions\n\nSome infections, such as rabies and influenza, can be shared between humans and animals. Certain types of activities may increase your chance of contact with animals, such as travelling in rural or forested areas, camping, hiking, and visiting wet markets (places where live animals are slaughtered and sold) or caves.\n\nTravellers are cautioned to avoid contact with animals, including dogs, livestock (pigs, cows), monkeys, snakes, rodents, birds, and bats, and to avoid eating undercooked wild game.\n\nClosely supervise children, as they are more likely to come in contact with animals.\n\nPerson-to-person infections\n\nStay home if you’re sick and practise proper cough and sneeze etiquette, which includes coughing or sneezing into a tissue or the bend of your arm, not your hand. Reduce your risk of colds, the flu and other illnesses by:\n\nwashing your hands often\n\navoiding or limiting the amount of time spent in closed spaces, crowded places, or at large-scale events (concerts, sporting events, rallies)\n\navoiding close physical contact with people who may be showing symptoms of illness\n\nSexually transmitted infections (STIs), HIV, and mpox are spread through blood and bodily fluids; use condoms, practise safe sex, and limit your number of sexual partners. Check with your local public health authority pre-travel to determine your eligibility for mpox vaccine.\n\nTuberculosis\n\nTuberculosis is an infection caused by bacteria and usually affects the lungs.\n\nFor most travellers the risk of tuberculosis is low.\n\nTravellers who may be at high risk while travelling in regions with risk of tuberculosis should discuss pre- and post-travel options with a health care professional.\n\nHigh-risk travellers include those visiting or working in prisons, refugee camps, homeless shelters, or hospitals, or travellers visiting friends and relatives.\n\nMedical services and facilities\n\nHealth care is inadequate. It may be completely unavailable.\n\nIf available, health-care facilities are not appropriately sanitized. Patients requiring medical treatment for incisions or wounds run a significant risk of infection.\n\nPrescription medications are not available. Bring a sufficient supply of medications for the duration of your stay.\n\nMedical evacuation can be very expensive and you may need it in case of serious illness or injury. However, it's rarely possible due to a lack of companies willing to service Afghanistan.\n\nMake sure you get travel insurance that includes coverage for medical evacuation and hospital stays.\n\nHealth and safety outside Canada\n\nKeep in Mind...\n\nThe decision to travel is the sole responsibility of the traveller. The traveller is also responsible for his or her own personal safety.\n\nBe prepared. Do not expect medical services to be the same as in Canada. Pack a travel health kit, especially if you will be travelling away from major city centres.\n\nLaws and culture\n\nYou must abide by local laws.\n\nLearn about what you should do and how we can help if you are arrested or detained abroad.\n\nThe work week is from Saturday to Wednesday.\n\nPublic displays of physical affection between men and women are considered offensive.\n\nIllegal or restricted activities\n\nExtramarital relations\n\nExtramarital relations, including sexual relations are illegal. Punishment for convicted offenders is severe.\n\nRestrictions applicable to women\n\nThe Afghan authorities strictly enforce their interpretation of Islam and prohibit women from:\n\ntravelling and going to public places, such as parks and restaurants, without a guardian (mahram)\n\naccessing higher education\n\nworking outside their home\n\nworking for non-governmental organizations and the UN\n\nWomen who don’t cover from head-to-toe are likely to be arrested and face jail sentences.\n\nReligious proselytism\n\nReligious proselytism is illegal in Afghanistan. This includes preaching, possessing, or distributing religious literature or material. If you convert or try to convert someone from Islam to another religion, you could face harsh punishment, including the death sentence.

Such acts are punishable by lengthy jail sentences and even the death sentence.\n\nPhotography\n\nIt’s illegal to photograph government buildings, military installations and palaces. Seek permission from locals before taking their photograph.\n\n2SLGBTQI+ persons\n\nAfghan law explicitly prohibits same-sex sexual relations. This prohibition is being upheld by the Afghan authorities. Moreover, homosexuality isn’t socially tolerated.\n\n2SLGBTQI+persons could be discriminated against based on their sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, or sex characteristics. They could face physical attacks and arrest under several charges, including sodomy and illegal extramarital sexual relations.\n\n2SLGBTQI+ persons should carefully consider the risks of travelling to Afghanistan.\n\nTravel and your sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression and sex characteristics\n\nDual citizenship\n\nDual citizenship is not legally recognized in Afghanistan.\n\nIf local authorities consider you a citizen of Afghanistan, they may refuse to grant you access to Canadian consular services.
