        "text": "Dear friend,\n\nToday is the one year mark of the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan – we will all remember the hasty international withdrawal, the gut wrenching fear of atrocities to come, evacuations, and scenes of desperation. It was in those days of August last year that I made a personal decision to stay in Afghanistan, and so did many others. Our stories and perspectives are often missing in popular discourse on Afghanistan but our impact on the ground is undeniable. We, at Search Afghanistan stayed, knowing that the need for peacebuilding did not disappear with the departing planes – if anything, it only became greater, more acute, with more at stake for ordinary Afghans.\n\nLast year, August 15 started out as a normal workday for us amidst the stress of the ongoing war. We were running two major programs – improving access to justice for women and children and strengthening Afghan voices in the peace process. We were reviewing work plans and budgets, talking with partners around the country. By lunchtime, the Republic had fallen. The Taliban had taken the city. The staff went home that day, leaving the office unsure if we would return to work or even be alive.\n\nThe first weeks were a blur. The banks closed. We lost access to our life savings. We didn’t know if our paycheck would come, or how our families would eat if it did not. Almost everyone in our professional and social circles was evacuated. A few Search colleagues were too. Our homes and offices were searched. We could no longer recognize the streets we grew up in – they were filled with men with guns. Everyone, especially women and non-dominant ethnic and religious groups, feared the dark days ahead.\n\nDespite this we went back to work. Our mission to end violent conflict was more important than ever.\n\nWe faced daily challenges to keep operating. We were questioned as we passed Taliban checkpoints as we entered and exited the office. Our donors saw our work as too risky. Longtime programs were put on hold. New projects were started, then canceled. Our cash reserves were dwindling and the banks were still closed; we were waiting and seeing if the Taliban would shut us down. Personally, as an Afghan woman, I had to consider how I could continue working in a context where the future and safety of women’s rights was uncertain.\n\nDuring the next weeks and months, our office became home for many Afghan civil society organizations and activists. Apart from the humanitarians, Search Afghanistan was one of the only international NGOs active in Afghanistan at the time. So, our office became a staging ground for these organizations and activists to regroup on how to rebuild Afghan civil society. We took our direction from these local leaders – many of them now in charge for the first time – in meeting some of the challenges we were facing. Together, we decided that breaking the cycle of violence is only possible through non-violent means. We decided that more engagement with the Taliban at all levels, rather than isolation, would yield results. We decided that the Afghans inside the country – the insider mediators – should lead advocacy.\n\nIn this spirit, the first partner to set foot in the Search office in Kabul after the Taliban takeover was Salima. She leads a local organization, and she came to sign a contract with Search Afghanistan to provide employment opportunities, hygiene products, and peacebuilding interventions to women who had fled from rural areas to Kabul and now lived in internally displaced persons camps. Despite the fear, threats, and insecurities that women faced in the early months of Taliban-rule, Salima delivered. She reached over 900 women. In the process, she inspired us all – men and women – to push through our fears, focus on what matters, and take up the space that belongs to us. She was determined to continue to serve, and to build our society.\n\nSince then many others have followed suit. We work with 22 civil society partners in 16 provinces, building community cohesion, providing protection to those that need it the most, creating networks for youth and women to lead, and ensuring that humanitarian aid is conflict smart.\n\nI only partially recognize the Afghanistan I see in the news these days. There are atrocities. There is active conflict in several provinces. Women and men’s personal freedoms are heavily curtailed. This is part of the truth, and part of what each of my colleagues live with. Girls still cannot go to school. As predicted by many, Afghanistan was again a safe harbor for Al Qaeda. These are well reflected in the news.\n\nBut living here, I also see the other parts that have remained hidden. There is non-violent resistance. People are still struggling for a safe and just society. People like Salima show up every day despite the odds to make each day a little better for the people around them. This resistance is dynamic, ranging from on the street protests, to small everyday acts of resistance of a woman going to the shops dressed the way she wants to, from artists creating revolutionary arts to tribal and religious elders negotiating the freedom of civil society activists and journalists.\n\nSix months ago, I took Search’s CEO, Shamil Idriss, to Kandahar and Kabul. He met with the People’s Peace Movement, an indigenious non-violent movement that captured the attention across the country and beyond, student and youth groups, academics, peacebuilders and civil society activists and women working in the civil service in Taliban-run ministries. They are all still here. And while a lot of the world may have given up hope, they have not.\n\nIt feels like the outside world is still paralyzed in trauma, mesmerized by the horror of tragedies recent and past, and frozen by intractability. In reality, the situation is considerably more complex, and the future is not yet written. There is darkness and tragedy, but there is also hope and struggle. Even now, at the one year mark of the takeover, I’m still being contacted by journalists to connect them to Afghans, usually women in specific desperate situations, to meet their predefined narratives. But they don’t want to talk to Salima. They don’t want to hear about the perseverance I see around me.\n\nSome are relying on these narratives of desperation, lack of agency, and victimhood to create policies that impact the lives of the nearly 40 million people that live in Afghanistan. I urge these policymakers to engage with a variety of voices inside Afghanistan. I urge you to visit Afghanistan and see things for yourself. Then decide on how to best support the civil society and the people in Afghanistan. Explore the spectrum of activities that are taking place for protection of human rights, in development, advocacy and peacebuilding and meaningfully support them.\n\nI urge the international community to engage with the Taliban more rather than isolating them, and more importantly, facilitate the engagement of Afghans with the Taliban. They are the de-facto authorities in Afghanistan and their decisions make an impact on the daily lives of the Afghans. We have to constantly engage with them to create accountability around human rights, inclusivity and good governance. The struggle continues, and the outside world must support the struggle inside of the country.\n\nOver the past year, I have seen a passionate commitment to come together and build something new from my peers and colleagues in Afghanistan, including women. We’re still at a low point – but things can get better. We thought we were building a future. We still are. It won’t come like we thought. It will take sacrifice, be slow, be a struggle. Like Rumi says – raise your words, not voice; it is rain that grows flowers, not thunder.\n\nI know that you and your colleagues have been thinking a lot about Afghanistan in the past year – I welcome your thoughts and ideas as we continue this journey in the days and months to come.\n\nIn solidarity,\n\nZuhra\n\nZuhra Bahman\n\nCountry Director Afghanistan\n\nSearch for Common Ground\n\nKabul, Afghanistan\n\nt: +98 786 181616 | e: [email protected]\n\nJoin us"
