        "text": "Introduction\n\nWithout water, life as we know it would cease to exist. Farmers depend upon water for growing crops and raising livestock. Even where land is irrigated, rainfall furnishes the original water supply. Rainfall really means all precipitation—all the water that falls on an area, including rain, snow, sleet, hail, dew, and frost. Rainfall is measured in inches or centimeters; 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) of rain fills a straight-sided gauge to a depth of 1 inch. It takes 10 or 12 inches (25 or 30 centimeters) of snow to equal 1 inch of rain.\n\nRainfall around the world varies from more than 472 inches (1,199 centimeters) per year on Mount Waialeale on the Hawaiian island of Kauai to only 0.03 inch (0.08 centimeter) at Arica, Chile. In temperate climates, crops, livestock, and people generally thrive if the yearly rainfall is 20 inches (51 centimeters) or more. Ten inches (25 centimeters) may be enough provided it comes during the right season. The effective rainfall, however, is what counts. Rain is of no benefit when it quickly runs off steeply sloping land or sinks deeply into porous soil. Fast runoff is particularly characteristic of metropolitan areas where land is paved over for shopping malls, highways, and parking lots. In many cases the water flows into storm drains and sewers and becomes contaminated. Some of this polluted water eventually filters through the soil into natural underground reservoirs, called aquifers, and contaminates the groundwater.\n\nAn area also may suffer from lack of water if high winds, tropical heat, or very dry air evaporate the area’s moisture quickly. In such cases more than 20 inches (51 centimeters) of rainfall per year are needed to make up for the loss. Too much rain is harmful, however, for it erodes the land and leaches, or dissolves and removes, minerals from the soil.\n\nHow Rain Is Formed\n\nThe oceans are the chief source of rain, but lakes and rivers also contribute to it. The Sun’s heat evaporates the water. It remains in the atmosphere as an invisible vapor until it condenses, first into clouds and then into raindrops. Condensation happens when the air is cooled.\n\nAir cools either through expansion or by coming into contact with a cool object such as a cold landmass or an ice-covered expanse. When air passes over a cold object, it loses heat and its moisture condenses as fog, dew, or frost. Air also cools as it rises and expands. The water vapor in the cooling air condenses to form clouds and, sometimes, rain.\n\nAir rises for several reasons. Convergent lift occurs in cyclonic storms such as tornadoes. Air whirling toward the center of a cyclone collides with itself and is forced upward. In convective lift, air coming into contact with a warm surface, such as a desert, is heated and becomes more buoyant than the surrounding air. In orographic lift, the air is forced upward as it encounters a cooler, denser body of air or when it meets raised landforms such as mountains.\n\nFor raindrops to form there must be particulate matter in the air, such as dust or salt, at temperatures above freezing. These particles are called condensation nuclei. When the nuclei are cooled to temperatures below the freezing point, water condenses around them in layers. The particles become so heavy they resist updrafts and fall through the clouds. If the updrafts are particularly strong, as in a thunderstorm, the rain nuclei may become very large and fall from the cloud as hail. When the air temperature is at or below freezing all the way to the ground, the precipitation falls as snow.\n\nThe formation of rain clouds may be localized. During a hot summer day, air rising over a moist region may cause cumulus, or woolpack, clouds to form in the cooler air above the surface. These clouds darken to rain clouds as more moisture condenses. Frequently, the rain cloud is the only cloud in the area, with the rest of the sky remaining sunny. Such rainstorms occur almost constantly in the doldrums—the hot, calm belts near the Equator. Cumulus clouds can sometimes be forced to release rain by “seeding” them with particles of dry ice or silver iodide, which replace the normal condensation nuclei. Commercial rainmakers have claimed success using these methods.\n\nRainfall Around the World\n\nIn contrast to the rainfall that is generated locally by the rise of warm, buoyant air, much of the moisture received in most parts of Earth has been brought from distant oceans by the prevailing winds. Most of the rain over northeast Africa, Southeast Asia, the Indian subcontinent, parts of China, central South America, and northern Australia is brought by monsoon winds that blow steadily throughout the summer from the Indian and Pacific oceans. Monsoons are seasonal winds that blow from one direction for approximately six months, bringing torrential rains, and from the opposite direction for the remaining six months, during which little rain falls. In some parts of the world, monsoons provide virtually all the rainfall for an area. If they fail to come, the result is often crop failure and widespread famine. During the wet season moist air is cooled as it blows over rising land, letting abundant rain fall on the windward side of mountain ranges. This situation makes Cherrapunji, India, just north of Bangladesh, one of the rainiest places in the world with an average annual rainfall of 450 inches (1,143 centimeters), most of which falls in six months.\n\nPrevailing westerly winds blow over most of North America and Europe, and in these areas much of the rainfall is brought by cyclonic storms. These storms may be likened to great whirlpools of air, hundreds of miles across, that draw in moist air from their edges. Toward the center of the storm, the moist air converges and is forced upward. The cooling air condenses the water vapor, first into clouds and then into rain or some other form of precipitation. France, Hungary, Argentina, and the European part of Russia also receive considerable rainfall from cyclonic storms.\n\nHigh mountains usually force rain out of any moist winds that strike them by deflecting the air upward. Most of this rain falls on the windward slopes, those facing the wind; the leeward slopes, the downwind sides of the mountains, receive little or no benefit from the rain. Although Mount Waialeale is the rainiest spot in the world (followed closely by Cherrapunji), only a few miles away, on the leeward slope of the mountain, the average rainfall is less than 20 inches (51 centimeters). Southwestern Colorado, Tibet, and parts of Iran, Afghanistan, Bolivia, and Peru are dry plateaus on the leeward sides of mountains.\n\nNot all deserts are located on the leeward side of mountain ranges, however. Many of the planet’s great deserts—such as the Sonoran (which includes Baja California and the northwestern coast of Mexico along with portions of southern California and Arizona), the Namib (in southwestern Africa), and the Atacama (in northern Chile)—are located on the western coasts of continents between the oceans and the mountain ranges. In these cases there are two main factors that cause a lack of rainfall. In one instance the prevailing winds blow parallel to the coastlines and keep moisture-laden clouds over the water and away from the land. In the second instance an upwelling of cold water along the coast cools the air above it, causing the air to lose some of its moisture. When the air mass moves inland, the warm land heats the air, causing the air to retain in gaseous form what little moisture remains.\n\nRainfall may be measured by catching it in any level, flat-bottomed vessel with perpendicular sides, placed where it will receive the full force of the rain. The depth should be gauged with a very thin ruler rather than a thick one because it would raise the water level. As it is difficult to measure small amounts accurately, a special rain gauge has been devised that has a funnel and an inner can proportioned so that each inch of water in it equals one tenth of an inch of actual rainfall.
