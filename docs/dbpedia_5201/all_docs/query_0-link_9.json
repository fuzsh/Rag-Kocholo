        "text": "Download the Report\n\nKey Messages\n\nUpdate on Seasonal Progress\n\nForecast\n\nPartner\n\nUSGS\n\nKey Messages\n\nPersistent below-average precipitation and above-average temperatures from October 1, 2023, to January 15, 2024, have been seen throughout the country. These conditions will continue until at least the end of January (Figure 1). Wet season precipitation performance in the range of 45-60 percent of average is spread over the northeastern, eastern, and southern parts of the country. Slightly better precipitation performance in the range of 60-90 percent of average along with isolated patches of average cumulative precipitation is seen in the rest of the country as of the reporting date.\n\nSnow water volumes are either at, or very close to, record minimum levels across the country as of the reporting date (Figures 2 and 3).\n\nECMWF weekly precipitation forecasts indicate average to above-average precipitation in most parts of the country in early-to-mid February 2024. The forecasted average precipitation conditions may increase the current snow water volumes from record lows. However, snow water volume deficits may not be completely erased as above average temperatures may cause early snow melt in the country. In response, it is expected that the farmers may opt for planting spring wheat from late February through end of April taking advantage of the forecasted average precipitation (Figure 4 and 5).\n\nAbove-average mean temperatures are highly likely between February and April 2024 (Figure 6). Furthermore, air temperatures in the hottest 20 percent of the historical record are forecasted to be 2-3 times more likely than average during late spring and summer months in the country. Above-average temperatures may not only adversely affect healthy germination of irrigated spring wheat, but also lead to moisture stresses in rainfed crops and rangelands during this period. Early blooming of stone fruits, mainly almonds, due to early above-average temperatures in the northern, northeastern, and central parts of the country may be badly affected by late spring frosts and freezing temperatures culminating in reduced yields at the end of the season.\n\nThere is an increased likelihood of earlier-than-normal flash floods due to the forecast above-average temperatures melting fresh snow occurring during late February and March. These events may distract the farmers in their regular agricultural activities during early spring especially in the eastern and southern parts of the country.\n\nThe El Niño-Southern Oscillation is expected to transition from El Nino to ENSO neutral in April 2024 and transition to La Nina by autumn of 2024.\n\nCurrent conditions\n\nBelow-average precipitation, low soil moisture, and deficit water availability conditions are persisting in the wheat cultivating areas and rangelands as of reporting date. Farmers have alternative plans for taking advantage of the forecasted average precipitation during February-March 2024 by planting spring wheat. Below-average precipitation in the ongoing wet season is unlikely, though nonetheless possible, despite El Nino conditions, which typically lead to above-average precipitation in Afghanistan.\n\nPrecipitation\n\nBelow-average cumulative precipitation is forecast up to February 5, 2024. Most areas in the northeast and east, whereas selected portions of southern provinces have received only 45 to 60 percent of the average while the rest of the country has received 60 to 90 percent of average precipitation as of the reporting date (Figure 1).\n\nFigure 1\n\nCHIRPS season precipitation percent of average\n\nOctober 1, 2023 – January 31, 2024\n\nSource: UCSB/CHC\n\nSnow depth and snow water volume\n\nBelow average snow depths were observed throughout the country. Snow water volumes are at record minimum levels in all basins across the country (Figures 2 and 3 a, b, c, & d).\n\nFigure 2\n\nDaily snow water equivalent difference anomaly relative to the average (2001-2021) in mm as of January 21 2024\n\nAs of January 21, 2024\n\nSource: USGS/NASA\n\nFigure 3\n\nFigure 3a.

Panj (northeast).\n\nAs of January 18, 2024\n\nSource: USGS/NASA\n\nForecast\n\nPrecipitation\n\nNear-average precipitation is most likely throughout the country during February-April 2024 (Figure 4). ECMWF cumulative precipitation forecast for January 22-29, 2024, indicates above-average precipitation in some northern areas while average precipitation is expected elsewhere. During the following week from January 29, 2024, to February 5, 2024, average precipitation is expected in the western part of the country while above-average precipitation is forecast in the rest of the country. Precipitation forecast for February 5-12, 2024, indicates below-average conditions in the eastern and northeastern areas while average to above-average precipitation is expected in the rest of the country. In following week February 12-19, 2024, above-average precipitation is expected throughout (see Figure 5). The forecast of average to above-average precipitation in the coming month(s) is encouraging as the current snow water volume levels would be expected to significantly improve. In addition, water availability conditions for spring wheat planting should also improve, motivating the farmers to engage in spring wheat planting.\n\nFigure 4\n\nCopernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) multi-system seasonal precipitation forecast probabilities for February through April 2024 as of January 1, 2024\n\nSource: Copernicus Climate Change Service\n\nFigure 5\n\nWeekly mean precipitation forecasts made for January 22-29, January 29 – February 5, February 5-12, and February 12-19, 2024, made on January 19, 2024\n\nAs of January 19, 2024\n\nSource: ECMWF Forecast System\n\nTemperature\n\nThere is a high probability of above-average temperature conditions during February-April 2024 (Figure 6). Consequently, there is an increased probability of early season flooding in the flood prone areas of the northeast, east, central, and west. It is expected that temperatures in the hottest 20% of the historical record may occur two to three times more frequently than average during the above period. Above-average temperatures are most likely to result in early snowpack depletion thereby resulting in reduced water availability for irrigated crop water use during the latter part of the season. Moisture stress threat to almond orchards, rainfed crops, and rangelands remains high during summer months.\n\nFigure 6\n\nCopernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) temperature forecast for February - April 2024\n\nSource: Copernicus Climate Change Service\n\nFEWS NET’s Seasonal Monitor reports are produced for Central America and the Caribbean, West Africa, East Africa, Central Asia, and Somalia every 10-to-30 days during the region’s respective rainy season(s).
