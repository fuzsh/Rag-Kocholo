(Please upload your review as an attachment if it exceeds 20,000 characters)\n\nReviewer #1: The manuscript entitled \" Characterization of meteorological drought at sub-catchment scale in Afghanistan using station-observed climate data” assessed the spatiotemporal of drought characteristic (distribution, frequency, severity and duration) over different sub-catchment of Afghanistan using Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) at different time scales. The paper is written well and investigated an important topic related to Afghanistan where such studies are very rare.\n\nReviewer #2: Comments to Authors\n\nThe manuscript “Characterisation of meteorological drought at sub-catchment scale in Afghanistan using station-observed climate data” presents an interesting research which is of importance to the area of study. I have the following comments and suggestions for the authors.\n\nI suggest the authors add some numerical results such as some significant SPEI values obtained in the study area.\n\nIntroduction\n\nParagraph 1: Authors should highlight other drought occurences and their impacts in Afghanistan.\n\nParagraph 4: remove dimensional from the sentence.\n\nIn the second to the last paragraph, the authors discussed the constraints faced by the previous studies to include use of use of out-of-date long-term historical data; use of gridded global datasets at 0.5o (or ~ 50km) resolutions. Can the authors justify how these are constraints especially since some studies have used data of such resolutions and others have found gridded data sets to be able to replicate observed data sets. The following studies are examples\n\nChanging characteristics of meteorological droughts in Nigeria during 1901–2010, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosres.2019.03.010\n\nComparison of precipitation projections of CMIP5 and CMIP6 global climate models over Yulin, China, https://doi.org/10.1007/s00704-021-03823-6\n\nStudy area and data\n\nDescription of study area\n\nRemove ‘at’ from “Afghanistan is located at in southern-central Asia (Figure 1).”\n\nFigure 1 shows there are no existing gauge stations in most of the south of the study area, which may result into some catchments not having any stations within them. How were the authors able to capture the precipitation characteristics of the areas especially since the authors consider interpolation and use of gridded data sets as limitations in the introductory section?\n\nI suggest some part of section 2.2.3 like the Hargreaves and Samani method especially the equations described be moved to the methodology section as they are more of method than data.\n\nAlso, why did the authors choose the Hargreaves and Samani method of estimating the PET since the Penman-Monthieth method is always recommended for SPEI calculation and since there can be significant differences amongst the SPEI series estimation by the different PET methods in some regions; like larger in semi-arid to mesic regions and smaller in humid regions.\n\nDiscussion\n\nHow has the authors tried to reduce the possible uncertainties reported in this section?\n\nIt would be interesting if the authors could add a paragraph or two discussing our the droughts in the country has affected agricultural output in the region.\n\n**********\n\n6.
