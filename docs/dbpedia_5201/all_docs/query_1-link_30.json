        "text": "Weather in Croatia in June\n\nThe weather in June sets the tone for the oncoming peak season in July. The sun is gradually becoming warmer, more so than May, and the days reach delightful highs.\n\nDaily average temperatures in June are about 22°C, highs reaching up to 27°C and lows plummeting to about 19°C. Over the course of the month, the hours of sunshine remain pretty constant, with an average of about 15 hours per day. In June the summer solstice occurs, where the shortest day of the month is the 1st with 15.06 hours of daylight and the longest being June 21 receiving 15.20 hours of daylight. In terms of rainfall, it’s quite sparse with the average amount only 75mm over 6 days, so it’s highly unlikely that you’ll be getting wet from precipitation during this month. Instead, you can expect dry, warm and glorious weather.\n\nWith the average sea temperature in June around 22°C, you’re likely to be in the water more often than not, so don't forget to pack your swimwear!\n\nWeather in Croatia in July\n\nSunscreen at the ready – July in Croatia is extremely hot and dry, and typically the hottest month of the year with average daily temperatures reaching around 30°C and only go as low as 22°C. July is well and truly into peak season and it’s no surprise as to why. July arguably delivers the ‘best weather’ and certainly channels the Mediterranean climate. Sea temperatures rise to a beautiful 25°C which attracts travellers near and far. The weather in July see’s even islands like Hvar and Korčula receiving the most hours of sunlight!\n\nThis is when you really want to pack your beachwear and swimwear and enjoy the Croatian coast!\n\nWeather in Croatia in August\n\nThe weather in August is extremely hot and dry. August is typically the hottest month of the year and also brings the warmest sea waters of the year which is typically around 25°C. During August, the days are generously long and there is, on average, 14 and half hours of sunshine daily. With extended longevity of sunlight, sunsets are also much later and tend to set from 8pm onwards - so enjoy all of your blissfully sunny hours!\n\nOverall, the daily average temperature sits at 25°C with highs of 30°C and lows of 22°C. Chances of precipitation are about 25% on average and is fairly consistent over the month.\n\nWeather in Croatia in September\n\nThe weather in September is still extremely warm from the summertime, although it is usually much wetter than July and August. It’s generally a good time to visit if you’re thinking about joining on an Elegance Croatia Cruise as many of the 18-35year olds have vacated the ports for the season. The water is still pleasantly warm for swimming, and the restaurants and bars are yours for the taking given the sparse crowds!\n\nSeptember’s average daily temperatures range from 18-24°C, with the highest still a lovely 25°C and the lowest temperature reaching around 18°C. Despite being a shoulder month for the travel season, September sea temperatures average at around 23°C making it ideal beach weather. The coastal breeze will keep you comfortably cool through September, although it is still recommended that you cover yourself in light clothing. You will find yourself in t-shirts, shorts and sandals during September so sunscreen with a high SPF is essential to avoid the autumn sun!\n\nWeather in Croatia in October\n\nCroatia is still fairly warm during October, but the temperature is noticeably lower and much wetter than the summertime. As days grow colder and shorter, don’t forget to pack your cardigan and an umbrella. October’s average daily temperature is about 18°C over the course of the month, with highs decreasing from 20°C to 18°C and lows from 14°C to 12°C. Of course with temperatures being lower at night, it would be wise to pack a few items such as a light jacket just in case.\n\nThe average daily rainfall has increased greatly to 162mm over 11 days. The average probability of precipitation is 37- 45%, increasing over the month and occurring as light, moderate rain, and some thunderstorms. The amount of daily sunlight drops and averages about 10.83 hours, with the length of the day decreasing about 2.6 minutes daily over the course of the month. The longest day of October is the 1st, with 11.44 hours of sunlight, and the shortest day is October 31 with 10.22 hours.\n\nWith the average sea temperature at around 20°C, you’ll still be able to spend time at the beach and have a dip in the water if you choose to. Spending time at the beach is still very much a possibility so don’t be surprised that you can spend your days wandering around in t-shirts and sandals! A mix of clothing is most appropriate to take for a trip in October to accommodate both the warmer and cooler days that can occur.\n\nWeather in Croatia in November\n\nThroughout November, watch the colours of Croatia shift into warm autumn hues across the country with dynamic seasonal changes. November begins to see a drop in temperatures but there isn’t a stark difference from October. The daily temperatures average around 16°C which is still pleasant enough to enjoy exploring, however there is a significant drop in daylight hours. With 9 available hours of sun, the amount of sunlight drops and averages anywhere from 5-7 hours.\n\nLows can drop to around 10°C which is a noticeable change from the previous month and a decent jacket is advisable for the evenings. Despite this, November in Croatia, especially along the coast, is quite warm compared to mainland Europe with sunny days sprinkled throughout the month and highs potentially reaching 17°C. November is also Croatia’s wettest month with 198mm of rain falling over 16 days and an umbrella on hand is recommended if you’re planning to take in the sites."
