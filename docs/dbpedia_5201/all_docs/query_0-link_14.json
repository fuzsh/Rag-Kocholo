        "meta_description": "This page presents a high-level insight into extreme events and how extreme events differ from mean climate. Extremes are often related to different physical processes than those that govern long-term means. While an average change in precipitation is primarily due to circulation changes, extremes are much more sensitive to the thermodynamic state and conditions during specific days. Therefore, it is important to compare and contrast trends and projections in means against those of rare events.\r\n\r\nExtremes only occur in a conjunction of several preconditions. For example, extreme rainfall requires maximized (“potential”) moisture transport into the region, high temperatures (or large temperature gradients) and significant instability of the atmosphere. An alignment of these “ingredients” is relatively rare. Under climate change, however, some of these conditions might see a systematic increase in occurrence, which is particularly true for temperatures across the globe. If that one condition – higher temperatures – is more often fulfilled, then the chance for a combined occurrence can also increase. Warmer temperatures are especially important for precipitation because the Clausius-Clapeyron-Relationship dictates that for every 1ºC of increased air temperature, that air’s potential to carry moisture increases by 7%. Thus, the warmer the air, the much more moisture it “can” carry, and therefore if rain were to form, much more water could be tapped into.\r\n\r\nWhere exactly the most extreme precipitation then might happen is also somewhat uncertain as current local conditions over a broader region can dictate the dynamical process of triggering an event, although sometimes physical settings (e.g., topography) can lead to areas with higher likelihood of occurrence. Overall, extreme events have to be seen as requiring a set of pre-conditions tied with a probabilistic element of initiation. This is why extreme thunderstorms can affect one place, while a few kilometers away there is hardly any precipitation registered.\r\n\r\nIn summary: (1) Extreme precipitation events might show different signs and commonly larger magnitudes of change when compared to mean precipitation. (2) In a warmer world, the potential of air to carry moisture goes up exponentially, and thus the potential for heavier precipitation goes up. This means that intense events will likely recur more frequently, which can negatively affect the flooding risk. Only in areas where the occurrence of precipitation goes down significantly can the trend towards heavier rainfall be overcome and return periods of large events increase rather than decrease.\r\n\r\nThis page is designed to offer the user high-level insight into how CMIP6 models represent extreme events at global and country scales. The visualizations present different perspectives on historical conditions as well as future scenarios to enable understanding of shifts in extreme events. The baseline climate (Historical Period, 1985-2014, centered on 2000) can be compared with future time periods and scenarios, centered on 2025, 2050, 2075 as well as 2085 (using data to the end of the century). Please note, the presented extreme indicators offer qualitative projection results, which directly reflect global model output, and should not be mistaken for location-specific (“station-level”) extremes.",
