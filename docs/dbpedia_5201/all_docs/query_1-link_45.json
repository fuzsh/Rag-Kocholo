        "text": "Climate and Weather of Afghanistan\n\nAfghanistan's climate can be primarily characterized as arid or semiarid steppe. This means that the country receives relatively low annual rainfall, which contributes to the dry and barren landscapes. This type of climate is also characterized by vast temperature differences between day and night and between seasons.\n\nSummer (June until August) in Afghanistan means hot and dry days. The maximum average temperatures are between a scorching 36°C to 43°C. During summer also the evenings are still very warm.\n\nDuring the winter months, the cold is biting, especially in the vast open plains. The temperatures can plummet considerably and frost is a common sight. Snow, although limited, may also be witnessed in some regions.\n\nThe mountainous regions, particularly in the northeast, have a subarctic climate. This means that these areas experience extremely cold winters, often accompanied by snowfall. The winter chill here is intensified by the high altitudes and the wind patterns. These areas remain dry, much like the rest of the country, but the cold can be piercing, especially during the peak winter months.\n\nDespite its predominantly arid climate, Afghanistan does receive some rainfall. The probability of rain is highest during the winter months.\n\nAre you interested in more detailed information for various cities in Afghanistan?\n\nPlease select the city you plan to visit, or one closest to your destination.
