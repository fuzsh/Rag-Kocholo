Deranged Allison Perkins kept the baby for weeks before she was finally returned to her mother's arms. Growing up a privileged life at Llanfair, Viki instilled fairness and kindness in her daughter and she grew into a strong, independent teenager.\n\nWhen Viki and Clint were having marital problems, and Viki began a relationship with Sloan Carpenter, an upset Jessica rebelled by smoking and drinking. Eventually she was able to cope with her parents' divorce and resumed the life of a normal high schooler.\n\nJessica met Cristian Vega, an artistic teen from Angel Square, a rough neighborhood. The two shared an instant attraction, but Clint and Cristian's mother Carlotta disapproved of the relationship. The two were forced to see each other in secret until their respective parents warmed to their relationship.\n\nWith their relationship going strong, Cristian wanted to have sex with Jessica, who was uncomfortable at the thought. One night, things went particularly far and Jessica and Cristian got close to having sex-only to have Clint walk in on them. Furious, he forbid Jessica from seeing Cristian. Their subsequent attempts to see each other only ended up getting the two in more trouble.\n\nEventually Clint allowed Jessica to start seeing Cristian again. Despite Cristian's desire, Jessica did not want to have sex. At the prom, Cristian gave into momentary temptation and kissed another girl. Jessica saw and, hurt, broke off with Cristian. Eventually the two reunited, but Cristian entered college and the young lovers' different worlds began to interfere with their relationship.\n\nTess Buchanan\n\nChildren: Megan Buchanan (deceased; with Will Rappaport)\n\nMother: Viki Davidson\n\nFathers: Mitch Laurence (biological; deceased), Clint Buchanan (adoptive)\n\nSiblings: Kevin Buchanan (half-brother), Joey Buchanan (half-brother), Megan Gordon (half-sister; deceased), Natalie Vega (half-sister), Cord Roberts (adoptive half-brother)\n\nGrandmothers: Olympia Buchanan (adoptive; deceased), Eugenia Lord (deceased)\n\nGrandfathers: Asa Buchanan (adoptive), Victor Lord (deceased)\n\nNiece: Sarah \"Flash\" Roberts (adoptive)\n\nNephews: Duke Buchanan, CJ Roberts (adoptive)\n\nAunts: Meredith Lord Wolek (deceased), Tina Clayton Lord\n\nUncles: Tony Lord (deceased), Todd Manning, Bo Buchanan (adoptive), Ben Davidson (adoptive), Flynn Laurence\n\nCousins: Starr Manning, Jack Manning, CJ Roberts, Sarah \"Flash\" Roberts, Danny Wolek, Brian Kendall (deceased), Drew Buchanan (adoptive; deceased), Matthew Rappaport (adoptive)\n\nTess Buchanan is the split personality of Llanview's young heroine, Jessica Buchanan. She began to surface when Jessica began receiving threatening notes from an apparent stalker. Jessica suspected Cristian Vega was the culprit, but when Cristian went to prison for the murder of Tico Santi, the notes continued.\n\nSoon after, it was revealed that Tess was the person leaving Jessica threatening notes. Tess wanted a life of fun and freedom, and was determined to torment Jessica and break up her relationship with Antonio Vega in order to achieve this. Unbeknownst to Jessica, Tess spent her nights moonlighting in bars and sleeping with various men. It was during a bitter custody battle between RJ and Antonio that Jessica heard Tess's voice in her head, and realized she was suffering from Dissociative Identity Disorder, which had previously affected her mother. Tess was resolute to hinder Antonio's chances at winning custody of his daughter Jamie, and even went as far as snooping in RJ's apartment for information on Antonio. Tess inadvertently started a fire in the apartment, but luckily Jessica emerged and was able to save Jamie. After discovering she had a split personality, Jessica decided it would be best to keep it secret from those she loved. She felt the truth would ruin Antonio's future with his daughter, and hinder her mother's faltering health."
