        "text": "In just ten days, no fewer than 13 priests have been arrested in the dioceses of Matagalpa and Estelí, in the northwest of Nicaragua. This marks a new wave of repression against the Catholic Church organized by the authoritarian regime of President Daniel Ortega and his wife, Vice President Rosario Murillo.\n\nFather Frutos Valle Salmerón, administrator of Estelí Diocese, was the first to be arrested July 26. According to Nicaraguan media outlet Confidencial, the arrest occurred just hours after the police banned the ordination of three deacons scheduled for July 27. After his incarceration, the 79-year-old priest was transferred to the National Interdiocesan Seminary of Our Lady of Fatima in Managua, the country's capital.\n\nThe diocese of Bishop Alvarez targeted\n\nA few days later, two other clergy members were apprehended: Fathers Ulises René Vega Matamoros and Edgard Sacasa, pastors of San Ramón and San Isidro churches in the Matagalpa diocese, respectively.\n\nThe following day, August 2, eight more priests and a deacon were arrested. Among them were Father Jairo Pravia and Vicar Víctor Godoy from the Church of the Immaculate Conception in Sébaco; Father Antonio López and Deacon Erwin Aguirre from the parish of Ciudad Darío; and Father Raúl Villegas, pastor of Matiguás, according to the independent site Despacho 505. The most recent August 5 arrest was that of the rector of the Matagalpa seminary, Father Jarvin Tórrez.\n\nTensions between the church and the Nicaraguan regime\n\nThis is one of the largest waves of repression against the church conducted by the regime since December 2023, when nine priests, two seminarians, a vicar general, and a bishop were also arrested in the country. They were subsequently expelled January 14 to Rome along with Bishop Rolando Alvarez of Matagalpa, who also served as the apostolic administrator of Estelí Diocese. A prominent critic of the regime, Bishop Alvarez was detained since February after being placed under house arrest since August 2022. He was sentenced to 26 years in prison for “conspiracy and spreading false news.”"
