        "text": "The Sullivan East Patriot golf team boasts just one senior and a pair of juniors for the 2024 campaign.\n\nThus, expect some hiccups from the Patriots, like those seen the last two days against West Ridge in the Sullivan County Cup.\n\nâThere are four guys that we rotate among our six that have never played varsity golf,â said East coach Keegan Lahr. âExperience is everything and this (County Cup) was a great experience. Iâm hoping by the end of the season we are clicking.â\n\nReturning region qualifier Will Carrier is already clicking. The junior shot 80 at the 1913 Tournament at Johnson City Country Club and 79 at the Conference Jamboree at Pine Oaks last month.\n\nThe lone senior, Ethan Casey, carded an 84 at the 1913 event.\n\nâEthan is a four-year member of our team,â noted Lahr. âHeâs battled to compete, but hadnât seen a lot of varsity time, but this year heâs really playing well.â\n\nSophomores Josh Durham, Karson Stafford, Cole Cross and Carter Ashbrook figure to be in the mix for spots as well.\n\nâThe future is bright,â continued Lahr. âWe are just going through those hiccups and then the next couple of years weâll really be battling.â\n\nThe Lady Patriots return both freshmen golfers from last season - Hailey Tester and Hayden Pierson.\n\nâThey both came to me their freshman year and had never touched a golf club,â Lahr said. âThey have shown good work ethic, they have both taken strides and we are excited for their progress.â"
