        "text": "Over the last 48 hours, remembrances have been pouring in on social media for the late Kamar de los Reyes (ex-Antonio Vega, One Life to Live). The actor passed away on Christmas Eve at the age of 56 after a short battle with cancer.\n\nAs we have previously posted, so many touching tributes have honored the life of de los Reyes and what he has meant to so many people, and what an extremely talented actor he was throughout his television and film career. At the time of his death, Kamar was taping new episodes for the sixth season of the CW’s All American, in his recurring role as Coach Montes.\n\nTwo stars who grew up with Kamar during his earlier years on ‘One Life’ were Melissa and David Fumero. The couple met while at the ABC soap opera, where she played Adriana Cramer and he played Cristian Vega. They have been married since 2007 and share two sons together. As for their beloved former castmate, Kamar also married his One Life to Live co-star, Sherri Saum (ex-Keri Reynolds) in 2007. The couple shared twin sons together. Taking to their Instagram accounts, Melissa and David reflected on the loss of their friend and former co-star.\n\nMelissa Fumero, who rose to fame in Brooklyn Nine-Nine, beautifully said in her remembrance to Kamar: “You took me to my first work event. It was a Latino event. From the very beginning you instilled in me the importance to show up for the community. To show up for your people. This goodbye is too hard. But I will pick myself up and believe and have hope and stay positive and laugh and love my loved ones hard and do my best to spread fuckin joy because that’s what you did everyday. We love you Kamar. We always will.” The actress included some very heart-tugging images along with her post illustrating the close bond she had with de Los Reyes (see below).\n\nDavid Fumero who played Kamar’s on-screen brother, and went on to be featured in Starz Power, and other numerous primetime roles, expressed: “Kamar De Los Reyes…Can’t say goodbye my friend. But thank you for your love and wisdom. For the many laughs that would brighten my days. You’re a legend and a warrior in my book. I will keep my ears open for your whispers that I know will come. Rest In Power…Till we meet again my brother! 💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽”\n\nFumero’s Instagram post included very poignant photos of both he and Kamar together and with others including: former WWE champion, Hulk Hogan and their One Life to Live on-screen mom, Patricia Maucieri (ex-Carlotta Vega).\n\nYou can check out the Melissa and David’s tributes to Kamar below.\n\nWhat are you remembrances of Kamar, David and Melissa from One Life to Live?
