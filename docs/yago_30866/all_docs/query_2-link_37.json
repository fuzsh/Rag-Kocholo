        "text": "Carlos and Alexa PenaVega are officially bringing their sizzling on-and-off-screen chemistry to Great American Pure Flix!\n\nThe Christian couple, who have been married since 2014, will co-star in a new Original movie for Great American Pure Flix titled “Mr. Manhattan,” which is now exclusively streaming.\n\nSubscribe to the Great American Pure Flix Insider newsletter for the latest faith & entertainment news\n\n“Carlos and Alexa are audience favorites and so beloved for their commitment to family on and off the screen, which is the foundation of Mr. Manhattan,” said Bill Abbott, President & CEO of Great American Media. “And we are excited about a number of additional projects in development with these two enormously talented actors.”\n\n“Mr. Manhattan” tells the story of successful lawyer Mason Bradley (Carlos), who believes there’s nothing he can’t handle. That is, until he gets the news that his brother and sister-in-law died and made Mason their children’s legal guardian. Even though he has zero parenting experience, he steps into his new role with can-do bravado, but between a demanding new client and moving his niece and nephew into his not-exactly-child-friendly Manhattan loft, it’s not long before Mason realizes he needs help. The kids want that help to come from their mom’s best friend and hometown babysitter, Dani (Alexa) – who also happens to be Mason’s ex-fiancé.\n\nThe couple has been open about how much they love working together. From competing against each other in season 21 of “Dancing with the Stars” to starring together in numerous rom-coms, they know each other’s limits, talents and playful personalities better than anyone else.\n\n“A lot of people say that they don’t like watching couples on screen because there’s no chemistry because they know each other so well that there’s not this flirty back-and-forth,” Alexa said in a recent interview. “But we’re so flirty in real life that I don’t know, we just have so much fun together.”\n\nAnd while there will certainly be plenty of laughs for the audience during “Mr. Manhattan,” this heartwarming story will also serve as a great reminder about what it means to find joy after grief and give God control over every aspect of our lives, a message that has been top of mind for the PenaVegas in recent weeks.\n\nThe couple, who is expecting their fourth child together, recently shared that Alexa has had a difficult pregnancy due to health concerns. She’s been hospitalized multiple times and started having contractions at one point. Even from very early on in her pregnancy, the couple was forced to lean on their faith and let God take the wheel, just like their characters in Mr. Manhattan.\n\n“In that moment, I was [thinking] about having this peace that God just allowed me to stay okay and stay confident in Him because, at the end of the day, it was out of my control,” Alexa shared in a video on social media.\n\nMark your calendars and get ready to watch Carlos and Alexa PenaVega in “Mr. Manhattan” exclusively on Great American Pure Flix beginning Friday, May 24."
