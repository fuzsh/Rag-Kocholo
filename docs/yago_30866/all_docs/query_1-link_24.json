        "text": "If you need to speak with a triage nurse anytime our office is closed, simply call our office and follow the prompts to connect with a nurse by pressing “option 1.” You will be prompted to leave your number and a Triage4Pediatrics nurse will return your call within an hour in most circumstances.\n\nThere will be a charge for all after hour calls.\n\nIf you feel your child needs to be seen, refer to the pediatric after hour clinic options below. These clinics will send us records of your visit in order to keep your child’s chart complete.\n\nI’m hoping these options will be helpful to you whenever our office is closed!\n\nValerie Wheelock, MD\n\nBarton Creek Pediatrics Staff\n\n1. FLU VACCINE:\n\nWe have flu vaccines available now (both the injectable and the Flumist). The flu vaccines we offer are ALWAYS mercury/thimerosal/preservative-free, even the ones we give to our parents. A flu vaccine is recommended for everyone 6 months of age and older and is especially important for those that have chronic illness or those that have an infant in the home that is not yet old enough to receive one. A booster is recommended for all children under 9 years of age 30 days after their first dose if they have not received at least 2 doses of a flu vaccine in the past.\n\nWe will offer the quadrivalent flu shot and intranasal Flumist. The flu shot is NOT a live virus, so you CANNOT get the flu from this vaccine nor are you contagious after receiving the vaccine. The Flumist vaccine IS a live vaccine that can create mild symptoms in some cases, but generally does not make you contagious or ill if you have a normal immune system. The Flumist vaccine is only for healthy individuals between the ages of 2-49 years. The Flumist vaccine is not recommended for those that are pregnant, for anyone that is immunocompromised, or for individuals that have chronic disease. While the flu vaccine cannot provide 100% protection due to viral mutation, the vaccine typically shortens the duration and reduces the severity of the illness.\n\nWe are happy to provide flu vaccines to our patients and families by appointment only while supplies last. Patients may receive their flu vaccines during well checks or at the flu clinics (see schedule below). However, in order to maintain our schedule, parents/caregivers may ONLY receive flu vaccines during our scheduled flu clinics (not during a child's well/sick visit).\n\nCall to schedule your family's flu vaccines while supplies last! Be sure to call to reserve your child's dose if you want the Flumist, even if you have a well check coming up. Thank you for being patient with us as we work as hard as we can to get as many people scheduled as we are able in the next few days. Because our phone lines can get overwhelmed during this process, you can send an e-mail requesting a call back to schedule a flu vaccine appointment. We will do our best to call you back in the order we receive your e-mail, as business hours allow.\n\nFlu Clinics:\n\nEvery Friday afternoon through October/November\n\nOctober 10th: 5:30-7pm\n\nOctober 17th: 5:30-7pm\n\n2. COVID VACCINE:\n\nThe CDC has made a general recommendation for the updated COVID vaccine for everyone 6 months of age and older to provide better/boosted protection against the circulating strains. These updated vaccines are available at many locations in Austin. The website Vaccines.gov can be helpful in finding a location near you.\n\n3. RSV IMMUNIZATION:\n\nRespiratory Syncytial Virus is a highly contagious virus that can lead to serious respiratory illness in infants. RSV is the leading cause of hospitalization in infants under 1 year of age. Beyfortus is a new, longer-lasting, monoclonal antibody injection that provides fairly instant protection against RSV for 5-10 months. Babies under 8 months of age are eligible for this immunization and some infants at high risk of severe disease are eligible up to 18 months of age.\n\nThere is VERY limited supply of the dose for infants 11 pounds and over and they are unable to take any more orders at this time. We were only able to order 15 doses! Call soon to schedule if you are interested!"
