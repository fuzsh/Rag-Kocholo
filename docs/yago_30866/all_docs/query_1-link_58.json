        "text": "https://lnkd.in/gSTrqAGb Love Tom rendition of the song. It brings out so much emotion on the modern world. \"........Ten thousand people, maybe more People talking without speaking People hearing without listening People writing songs that voices never shared And no one dared Disturb the sound of silence....\" \"The Sound of Silence\" is a song by Simon & Garfunkel that carries a profound message about the lack of communication and understanding in society. It explores themes of isolation, alienation, and the inability to connect with others on a deeper level. The lyrics evoke a sense of loneliness and despair, highlighting the silence that pervades amidst the noise of modern life. The song urges listeners to reflect on the importance of meaningful communication and the consequences of remaining silent in the face of societal issues. It serves as a poignant reminder of the need for empathy, compassion, and genuine human connection in a world that often feels disconnected and chaotic. #happiness #begrateful #communication\n\nhttps://lnkd.in/gt7yv75r I never thought this was fit for public consumption. It was meant to be internal use only for sales training of our B&K people - but since my last post (about the audio CD) there were many requests to publish it on LinkedIn. So here it is. But before you watch it, let me put this all in context. This was 1990. B&K had finally fully entered the continuous machine health monitoring business after a multi million dollar development program in COMPASS. A bunch of B&K guys in Holland seemed to do very well at selling the system, so I flew down to Amsterdam and met with a Mr Henk Smith who led that group. I asked him how do you do it? His message to his customers was clear. \"The cost of a false alarm and shutting down any process plant for no good reason was financially unacceptable!\" So Henk's message was - \"to avoid false alarms there are 10 things plant operators need to understand about vibration monitoring\". So I wrote and published (boring) articles about those 10 concepts, presented (boring) papers all over the world etc etc . So why not hire my bandmates (who also worked at B&K at the time) to write a rap about those 10 concepts, make a CD, and while you are at it, make an MTV style video? PS (Actually - this is technically as relevant today as it ever was and ever will be)."
