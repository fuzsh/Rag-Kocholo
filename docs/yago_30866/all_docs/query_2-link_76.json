        "text": "Keenan and Lorie Smith became Lead Pastors of Crosby Church in 2003. Since then they have introduced fresh and exciting change. A man of positive dynamics, Keenan proclaims Jesus Christ as Lord and stretches the Crosby Church congregation with biblical principles rooted in a ministry philosophy that seeks to 'Build the Person, Build the Body, and Build the Kingdom.' A gracious, gentle, and caring person, Lorie oversees the women's ministry and is affectionately called the 'first lady' of Crosby Church.\n\nOriginally from a small town in Illinois, Keenan had a life-changing experience as a teen when his father, an alcoholic, gave his heart to Jesus Christ. Having witnessed his father's genuine transformation, Keenan also gave his life to the Lord—a decision that forever altered the course of his life. Obeying the call of God, Keenan entered the ministry in 1982. While serving God, he also started a small construction company, building homes and swimming pools.\n\nKeenan’s wife, Lorie, was also born and raised in Decatur, where her parents have pastored since 1961. She and Keenan met in church and were married in 1981. Lorie worked as a nurse in the early years of their marriage and later helped her husband build the construction company. However, she maintained her focus on raising their three children in the nurture and admonition of the Lord and assisting Keenan in the ministry.\n\nIn 1991, the couple moved to the Houston area where Keenan ministered in Pasadena, Texas. In 1999, with his considerable experience in school-based ministry and crusades, Keenan and four close friends established Team Impact, an international group of professional athletes who used their God-given abilities to touch the lives of nearly a million public school students each year, as well as thousands of others at evening crusades around the world. The team was on television in over 200 nations.\n\nA firm believer in community involvement, Keenan has been a Crosby-Huffman Chamber of Commerce member since 1995 and a Chamber Board member since 1996. In 2004, he and Lorie founded Crosby Care—Meeting the Needs of People, Inc., a non-profit organization that offers a low-cost alternative for groceries and helps to clothe hundreds of children every Christmas.\n\nOne thing Keenan and Lorie have learned - “When we lean in to the things of God, He is always able to pour into us.” Pastor Keenan and Lorie invite you to 'Lean in'!\n\nDr. Bert Watson formally joined the Crosby Church ministry team after 35 years as a missionary and pastor developing Christian leaders in Africa. The church's relationship with the Watsons goes back over 20 years. Bert met Pastor Keenan in South Africa in 1996 while coordinating a major outreach in which Keenan played a key role. Bert is married to Surette, a South African by birth (now a U.S. Citizen), and they have three grown children, all of whom have been involved in ministry. His passions include teaching God’s word for transformation, equipping people for ministry, developing biblical leaders, and multiplying the church’s worldwide missional impact. Bert holds a MA in Global Leadership from Fuller Theological Seminary and a PhD in Practical Theology from South African Theological Seminary (SATS), where he developed and teaches the seminary's course on biblical leadership for emerging and existing church leaders in many nations. He is also the founder of Leading Edge Christian Ministries, an organization devoted to the training and development of church leaders in the Majority World. Like the apostle Paul, his desire is to see every believer ‘fully developed’ in Christ (Col. 1:28).\n\nJohn served the Crosby Church community for many years as a Family Care Pastor. A native of England naturalized as a U.S. citizen, John holds dear to his English origins but enjoys his adopted Texas lifestyle. His former ministerial duties at Crosby Church involved hospital and home visitations, spiritual counseling, organizing/officiating funerals and weddings, altar prayer and counseling, and other practical family matters. John served in the Royal Air Force until 1979, after which he graduated in 1981 from North Staffordshire Polytechnic with a B.Sc. in mechanical engineering. John's past experience in personnel management, refined by the wisdom of the Holy Spirit, has enabled him to administer God’s love appropriately to people experiencing life’s difficulties. 1988 was a life-changing year for John. He met Jesus Christ and he met his first wife, Peggy, marrying her the following year. Peggy served as Pastor Keenan's personal assistant for many years. They were blessed with two wonderful sons, Trevor in 1994 and Aaron in 1996. Peggy went to be with the Lord in 2015. John has since remarried. He and Vicky reside in Huffman, Texas. In spite of being 'retired', John still assists with altar ministry, weddings, and funerals.\n\nGina Vega serves as the Care Pastor at Crosby Church, bringing compassion and support to our community. She is devoted to living a life guided by Christ’s teachings, seeking to love and serve others selflessly. Through acts of kindness, compassion, and faith, she aspires to make a positive impact on the world around her. With four years of valuable ministry experience at Grace Church in Houston, Texas, Gina brings a deep commitment to spiritual leadership. Gina's Bachelor of Science Degree in Small Business Management & Entrepreneurship coupled with her experience as a Realtor has equipped her to approach pastoral care with a unique entrepreneurial mindset, fostering innovative solutions and community engagement within the church. Her dedication to both her family and the community embodies her compassionate spirit, making her an invaluable part of our team. Gina is married to Rick, and they have two wonderful sons.\n\nJosh Powell is Crosby Church's student pastor. Together with his wife, Rhonda, he oversees Activate Youth, a life-changing ministry for high school and middle school students from across the region (https://www.crosbychurch.com/activate-students). A multi-talented individual, he is also involved in the church's media ministry. Josh loves basketball and played on the Indiana state basketball team in 1999. It was through sports that he became friends with a Christian teenager in high school. This teen and his family invited Josh to an outdoor Christian music festival, where a man who had never met Josh approached him and began to speak to him about things only God could have known. Josh received Jesus as his Lord and Savior and began attending church. A few years later, God called him into ministry and Josh became a licensed minister. In 2004, Josh met his wife, Rhonda, who was quite involved in missions, and they married the next year. They served as youth pastors in their home state before accepting a call to Crosby Church. Josh and Rhonda have a passion to see teens come to know and love Jesus Christ and, through effective discipleship, walk out their faith in everyday life. They live in Huffman and have three children.\n\nDenita has been a member at Crosby Church for many years and often says, “I love my church!” Highly qualified, she has 29 years of experience in public school education from PreK3 all the way up to 21 year olds and holds a bachelor’s degree, master’s degree, and superintendent certificate. One of her favorite Bible verses is Proverbs 22:6. “Train up a child in the way he should go; even when he is old, he will not depart from it.” Denita wholeheartedly believes that parental input combined with effective preschool ministry provide a solid foundation for that training. A truly committed servant of the Lord, Denita says, “I will continue to lean in to the things that God has for me here at Crosby Church and will strive to serve parents, young children, and babies in every way that the Lord enables me.” Denita is married to Cliff and has two beautiful daughters, Katie and Kara, both of whom regularly volunteer at church events.\n\nLeslie Crain serves on Crosby Church’s ministry team. She welcomes guests to weekly church services and shares the truth and goodness of God during the transition from worship to preaching. She also teaches a Sunday equipping class and assists with ministry to women and young people.\n\nLeslie and her husband, Chris, have been happily married since 2003 and have two beautiful daughters. They joined Crosby Church in 2007. Describing herself as “an all or nothing kind of girl”, Leslie has pursued a close relationship with the Lord Jesus ever since he first laid hold on her life in 2007. Her passion is to speak God's truth in love and see lives transformed by Jesus Christ. One of her favorite scripture passages is Jeremiah 17:7-8. \"Blessed is the one who trusts in the Lord, whose confidence is in him. They will be like a tree planted by the water that sends out its roots by the stream. It does not fear when heat comes; its leaves are always green. It has no worries in a year of drought and never fails to bear fruit.\" Leslie holds a BBA in Human Resources from from Tarleton State University and has worked in insurance for the last 18 years. Outside of family, church, and work, she enjoys running, cycling, and other outdoors activities, as well as all things to do with coffee."
