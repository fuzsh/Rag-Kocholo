        "text": "Al Horford ranks third all-time in total postseason games played without a championship to his name, as the big man has played in 181 postseason games but still hasn't had the chance to hoist the Larry O'Brien Trophy. He now has a chance to get that coveted ring, as his Boston Celtics are set to take on the Dallas Mavericks in the 2024 NBA Finals.\n\nA championship is long overdue for the 17-year NBA veteran, and all eyes will be on the Florida product during the championship series to see if he can help Boston record a league-record 18th NBA Finals victory. Horford has become a big-name player during his time in the NBA, but his family has also grown in fame. Notably, Horford's sister, Anna Horford, has gone viral multiple times on Twitter, usually because of her fandom for her brother's teams. We aren't worried about Anna in this article, though. Instead, we want to focus on Horford's wife, Amelia Vega. Below is everything we know about the couple and their relationship.\n\nWho is Amelia Vega?\n\nAl Horford has made quite a name for himself as a basketball player. Before becoming a five-time All-Star while playing predominately for the Atlanta Hawks and Boston Celtics, Horford was a key contributor on the Florida Gators team that went back-to-back as national champions.\n\nHis wife, Amelia Vega, is also a megastar, though, and she has accomplished a lot in her career. Like Horford, Vega was born in the Dominican Republic. At the age of 18, she won Miss Universe 2003, and in the process, she became the first Miss Universe winner from the Dominican Republic and the youngest winner in nearly a decade. At 6-foot-2, she is also the event's tallest winner ever. Additionally, she won Miss Santiago 2002 and Miss Dominican Republic 2002.\n\nOn top of being known for the beauty pageant, Vega also has a music career. She recorded her first demo at the age of 15, and her first single (Pasa Un Segundito) became a top Latin song just days after its release.\n\nVega has even dabbled in acting. She has appeared in Capitan Avispa, Homie Spumoni, and The Lost City. Vega has even written a children's book titled “A Day in the Life of Pichin.”\n\nAl Horford and Amelia Vega's relationship\n\nVega has seemingly slowed down when it comes to her career ambitions to focus on her family in recent years. She is a mother of five with the children she shares with Horford.\n\nSurprisingly, the two didn't meet in the Dominican Republic. Instead, they met in Boston. They reportedly first met at the Latin Pride Awards in 2007. The two got married in 2011 after two years of dating. The two's wedding got off to an unfortunate start, as the limo that was supposed transport Vega never showed up. Legendary MLB player David Ortiz saved the day by loaning Horford his Rolls Royce Phantom.\n\nThe wedding ended up working out and it has been smooth sailing for the couple ever since. Their children's names are Ean Joel, Alia Amelia, Ava Amelia, Nova Amelia, and Mika Ameilia. With all of the daughters having “Amelia” as their middle name, Vega's family now has seven generations of that name in a family member's first or middle name.\n\nVega and Horford certainly stay busy. Raising five children is no easy task, especially considering the NBA keeps Horford consistently on the road. Vega has been supportive of her husband throughout his career, though, and she will certainly be the Celtics biggest fan during the NBA Finals. This is all we know about Al Horford's wife, Amelia Vega."
