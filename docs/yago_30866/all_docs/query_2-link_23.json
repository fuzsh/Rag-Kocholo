        "text": "It‚Äôs my birthday! Well, kinda. It‚Äôs the birthday of my life and business coaching business, Thriving Together. And my how things change, pivot, and grow in just one year! When I quit my corporate job, sold my stuff, and moved to Panama, I knew I‚Äôd eventually figure out how to share my talents in a way that felt nourishing and exciting. I knew I could help people overcome the debilitating stress and overwhelm that tends to go along with navigating a demanding career, raising a family, and intending to do self-care, have hobbies, or just enjoy your freakin‚Äô life. Because after years of waking up with dread and ugly crying on my commute home, I remembered a simple truth that became my mantra. I‚Äôm an adult, and I have choices. No one‚Äôs coming for me. I gotta pick myself. Now, I‚Äôve spent A LOT of time and money over the past few years chasing various business ideas and shiny things. What I kept coming back to is the power of one. To focus on helping one person, one woman, one man, one at a time. To help them be happy, fulfilled, and have more peace and ease. To help them remember their true priorities, design a plan of action, be an accountability partner, and encourage them along the way. I‚Äôll tell you what, I‚Äôve led teams and managed people and really cool projects for 20+ years, but this‚Ä¶ this work is different. It‚Äôs joyful, impactful, and absolutely life-changing for both my clients and me. I chose the acorn as my logo. It signifies the immense power of a tiny seed that, with love, attention, and nurturing, grows into a mighty oak. This year has most certainly been a rollercoaster of ideas, productivity, and emotions. But what I know for sure is that it feels A WHOLE LOT like my purpose, and for that, I‚Äôm over-the-moon grateful. üíú P.S. If you haven‚Äôt checked out my NEW website, hop on over to www.RebeccaMurauskas.com.\n\n‚ú® Today is my birthday and I can say with certainty I am another year wiser. Here‚Äôs the thing- I learned early on in my career that as quickly as you can climb the corporate ladder, you can also certainly fall off and land flat on your butt, wondering ‚Äúhow did I get here?‚Äù ‚û°Ô∏è It takes tenacity, grit and determination to not play victim when things get tough. Picture this‚Ä¶ ‚úÖ You take a chance and take your dream job- one you‚Äôve been working and praying for. ‚ùå You get laid off at 5 months pregnant, for reasons out of your control and after receiving your best annual review yet. ‚úÖ You take matters into your own hands and start your own consulting business, leveraging your years of corporate experience. ‚ùå You apply for new jobs‚Ä¶ for eight months ‚è±Ô∏è & experience rejection in a tough market. ‚úÖYou finally land what seems like another dream job‚Ä¶ ‚ùå only to find out you‚Äôre now in an extremely toxic and heavily disorganized environment- one that will not be sustainable longterm. You feel it in your gut. ‚úÖ You make the decision to get out while you can- and start the job search over. & what‚Äôs next is loading‚Ä¶. üöß On this birthday I no longer measure success by my accomplishments, but rather the grit it takes to achieve my goals every day. ‚≠êÔ∏è Moral of the story, don‚Äôt play victim, find a way! Here‚Äôs to another year of growth, wisdom and perseverance. Onward and upward.\n\nAbout 3.5 months ago, I was completely shocked when I was laid off from my employer. At that time, I began my journey of unemployment to figure out what my next adventure would be. I was thrilled to have so many of you reaching out, texting me, engaging in long conversations, and rekindling old friendships from past jobs that felt like an eternity ago. I couldn't believe the outpouring of support from friends, family members, and old colleagues. As I embarked on the path to determine what I wanted to do next, I took part in interviews, discussions, and meetings with a wide variety of health-related companies and foundations. The one thing that remained important to me throughout this time was finding a place where the people are kind, smart, ambitious, where they won't ghost me after interviews (yes, it's a real thing), and where they do great work to help patients, HCPs and all people. My wife and close friends all told me, \"Don't settle\" and \"F&%$ fear.\" It's human nature to hold ourselves back from going after things we really want but may be risky, to get out of our own way. How do we become comfortable with the uncomfortable? I have taken those risks in the past, working with companies at the ground floor, running large pieces of business, speaking on panels about patient intelligence and technology, networking with executive teams. Now was the time to see where I go next, what I can run, how I can build and grow a business. What's my next adventure? One thing I recall from all my years in the healthcare space is that, as a group, we collaborate and think outside the box. We bring innovation, even when companies aren't ready for it, or if it doesn't even exist yet. We challenge ourselves and those around us to do better work, to move forward, not backward, and to find a way to get it done, together. I am excited and thrilled to start my new adventure on Monday, but today is a day of gratitude. Today I say \"Thank You\" to each one of you. If it weren't for you (and you all know who you are), texting, calling, meeting, working, networking with me, I wouldn't be able to say that my next adventure kicks off in just 5 days. Stay tuned.....\n\n150,000 people would trade places with you right now Who are these 150,000 people? They're all the ones, statistically, that died yesterday. The ones who fully planned on waking again today, but won't. Who might have had hopes and dreams and things they were planning on doing, but now can't. Apologies for being morbid, but I see too many people putting off their dreams. ‚ÄúYeah I always wanted to work outdoors as that's where I'm happiest, but I've just got a promotion at work, so‚Ä¶‚Äù Work that the person I was speaking to didn't enjoy. They knew the ropes, knew the routines, and knew that switching careers would create potential short-term financial instability. So they stayed. Unhappy. The people I work with don't do that. We figure out together exactly what lights you up, what's important to you, and what you want your life to be filled with. We then create a crystal clear plan about how to get exactly that. No more surviving, but chasing things you love No more feeling lethargic and fed up, but energised and enthusiastic No more waking up and wanting to crawl back to bed at the thought of the day, but bounding out of bed raring to go. Let's chat about how we can create this in your life; DM me today and let's get started!\n\nMight as well post before the honeymoon ends. End of last week I said my good byes to my second career; sometimes it seems like a few years ago my first career of 22 years in the Marines, followed by 23 years in various public and private sector jobs mostly in the construction industry. I often get asked and specially at retirement as what was the most rewarding job or role. This is difficult to compress into a single sentence. However, firstly, some jobs and roles stick out more than others because of their good vibes (people and tasks) and also those that were painful because of their grind without any reward or satisfaction. Secondly, every situation or problem I witnessed or was involved in these two careers was solved by Leadership! I learned the most valuable lessons from witnessing bad leadership or the absence of it. Now on to my next chapter of my journey; time and space for more volunteering projects within my community and being more accessible to my family members and extended family. Happy New Year!\n\nI've been in my new role at NC State for about 2 and half months. One thing I noticed is that when I discuss my background and introduce myself to others, I feel the need to justify why I left a tenured position. I wish I didn't feel that need to explain myself, but I'm still sensitive to my decision to leave because most people seem genuinely surprised to hear that I would leave a tenured position. I see the look on their faces; although, maybe that's just me being overly perceptive of nonverbals. But sometimes, people even say, \"wow.\" Why is there so much surprise? ü§î Why should anyone feel uncomfortable, awkward, or even defensive about their decision to leave a tenured position? Well, I was conditioned that was never a good idea too. We are taught, both intentionally and unintentionally, that leaving a tenured position is like walking away from winning the lottery. But there are endless reasons to to leave a tenured position (burn out, better pay, lack of opportunities for professional growth or feeling stagnant, frustrations with shared governance, etc.). And my reason just happened to be that my husband, who also has a Ph.D., found a dream job in NC, which is much closer to our family in Florida compared to Wyoming. I tell people that relocation for my husband's job is the primary reason I left my position. But I'm quick to add that I'm also courageous and curious; otherwise, how could I leave a tenured position? Being courageous and curious are excellent qualities for any employee, but especially important for being a researcher, social scientist, and communicator. So that's where I am. Happy to be in a university environment in a different capacity and starting to build community at NC State.\n\nSo I've quit my job. Several times. It was always a big decision, but once I made it, it was like a burden was lifted off of my shoulders. This experience taught me a lot. A job is a means to an end - it is not the end itself. Working for someone else, without having any influence means ‚Üí you can end up silent or quite quit. I realized that anything that I do, including my job, has to have a real impact. I've always been obsessed with making an impact. If what I'm doing doesn't have an impact, then it's just not worth it for me. Quitting my job wasn't easy, but it's given me the freedom to pursue what truly matters to me. Taking such a step kept me authentic to my values and purpose. Now, I'm focused on making a real the difference in whatever I do through my company Coral Swans. ‚Üí Life is too short to just go through the motions. I want to live with purpose and passion, and that's exactly what I'm doing now. So, here's to new beginnings and fulfilling dreams. ‚Üí If you're feeling stuck, remember, ‚Üí You have the power to change your path. ‚Üí Don't settle for anything less than what makes you truly happy. Cheers to the journey ahead! PS - what‚Äôs your story?"
