Cristian Vega grew up in Angel Square, a rough neighborhood in Llanview. His older brother, Antonio, was sent to prison when Cristian was younger, leaving Cristian vulnerable to the influence of local Llanview gangs.

Cristian found himself caught in the middle of a war between two gangs and was unsure how to extricate himself. Eventually, with help from newly released Antonio, peace was restored in Angel Squareâ€¦
