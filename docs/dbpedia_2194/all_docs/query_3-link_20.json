        "text": "Swimsuit season is fast approaching, and you know what that means – time to clean up that bikini line! Whether you go for a landing strip, Brazilian, or experiment with a new bikini line shape or style, you’re going to want to read this first. These 5 activities are big no-no’s for the first 48 hours after getting a bikini wax:\n\n1. Showing off that clean bikini line at the beach or pool\n\nSun and swimming should both be avoided right after your wax. The delicate skin down there will be extra vulnerable to UV rays for a couple of days, and sun exposure could lead to permanent damage and hyperpigmentation. Swimming could also expose you to bacteria and possible infections (yikes!).\n\n2. Hitting the sauna or a hot yoga class\n\n(Not so) fun fact: Steam opens up your pores and can cause premature stubble right after a wax. And since bacteria thrives in warm, wet places, it’s best to keep your freshly waxed bikini area as clean, dry and sweat-free as possible.\n\n3. Completing your bikini-ready look with a spray tan\n\nSpray tan chemicals can irritate newly waxed skin, and ingrowns are not a good look. Plus, the color might look uneven between waxed and unwaxed areas.\n\n4. Getting intimate\n\nSorry, hooking up will have to wait a couple days. We probably don’t have to tell you that chafing and friction in an especially sensitive bikini area is not a good thing. Ouch.\n\n5. Going hard at the gym\n\nSpeaking of friction, leggings, sweat and intense movement will not be a good combo for freshly waxed skin down there. Hold the HIIT class and plan for a day or two of recovery before you get back to working out.\n\nRemember, you only have to avoid these activities for a couple days, and then it’s business as usual!\n\nSo what’ll it be? Landing strip or triangle?\n\nBook now!\n\nxx,\n\nWaxxpot"
