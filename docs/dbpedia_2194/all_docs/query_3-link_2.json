        "text": "A while back, I wrote a tongue-in-cheek glossary of terms used in the sports card hobby — excuse me, The Hobby. There was just one problem: I had to chop out a ton of stuff in the name of space and keeping readers awake.\n\nInspired by the recent National Sports Collectors’ Convention (alas, I wasn’t there), I present another list of phrases and definitions for hobby newbies and veterans alike. I would suggest you cross-reference this with the original, as some phrases used here were mentioned in the prior column (where I see I made a sarcastic remark about Jarren Duran being an all-star someday — sorry!).\n\nAnd don’t forget: this is all in good fun. Collect whatever you love!\n\n1/1: A card with a print run of just one copy. A 1/1 of a hobby god can go for amounts that make the 1909 T206 Honus Wagner Card look like junk wax in comparison.\n\n1909 T206 Honus Wagner Card: The most famous sports card ever. Fewer than 100 copies exist after it was puled from production because Wagner allegedly did not want kids to see his picture on a product that promoted tobacco — even though another card shows him about to shove a big chunk of chaw into his mouth.\n\n1989 Fleer Bill Ripken FF Card: An infamous card of Cal Ripken’s untalented brother holding a bat with an f-bomb on the knob. Referred to as the “Rick Face” card by the Beckett magazines. Now who the hell is Rick?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBarry Bonds: The all-time home run king and subject of an amazing study in psychology: Everyone despises him (at least outside the Bay Area and maybe Pittsburgh) but wants to spend big bucks on his cards anyway.\n\nBig Box Store: Where collectors/investors go every day in hopes of spending their money on blasters while ignoring stuff they actually need, like a new faucet, a bookshelf, groceries …\n\nBlaster: A box containing several packs of cards. Also something investors buy for $25 at big box stores and charge for $50 online.\n\nBragging: The other hobby of most collectors and investors, who can’t wait to show off their pulls on message boards and/or social media.\n\nBowman: 1) Home of the rookie card, not to mention overpriced blasters hawked by investors on eBay. 2) Topps’ former competition until buying it out in 1956 and creating a 24-year monopoly, basically The Hobby’s version of Vince McMahon buying WCW.\n\nCard Show: Where collectors gather to buy and sell cards and other sports memorabilia, usually of the shiny variety these days. See The National.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChrome: The difference between a $20 Mookie Betts rookie card and a $200 card because it’s short-printed and shiny.\n\nCommon: A card of an ordinary player. These days, anyone other than a hobby god might as well be a common.\n\nComplete Set (arch.): No one tries to build complete sets anymore, silly. That would get in the way of finding rookie cards, relics or autos.\n\nDealers: People who sell cards for a living. They used to sell out of LCSs, but now mostly reside on eBay. Many dealers of the 1980s and ’90s looked and acted like Comic Book Guy on The Simpsons.\n\nFanatics: Multi-billion-dollar sports merchandise monolith that paid a bundle a few years back for the exclusive rights to produce MLB, NBA and NFL cards and now owns the Topps brand, angering longtime collectors, even the ones who constantly complain about Topps’s products in the same breath.\n\nGregg Jefferies: Infamous overhyped Mets prospect whose 1988 Donruss rookie card once went for more than the entire set does today. Many dealers of overstocked, overpriced junk wax still seem to hold out hope he might yet make it. (OK, he had a good career, but he certainly wasn’t the second coming of Mickey Mantle, either.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGum: What Topps used to put in its cards for decades, until collectors complained that it stuck to the cards and created stains. So Topps took out the gum, and collectors turned around and complained about that, too.\n\nHistory: Something most people in The Hobby don’t learn from (ex. rookie card hysteria over players such as Gregg Jefferies then or Jo Adell now).\n\nHobby Elitists: People who brag about having only the finest cards in existence; anything graded under a PSA 9 might as well be junk wax. They buy only from eBay sellers with 100% approval rating. Anyone with 99.9% or lower is blocked. Modern elitists collect only shiny chrome-refractor-auto-relic-rookie cards and would never be caught dead buying products at a big box store.\n\nHobby God: An all-time sports legend whose cards are desired hither and yon. Hobby gods include lovely human beings such as Pete Rose and Barry Bonds.\n\nJefferson Burdick: The inventor of The Hobby, whose massive vintage collection is on display at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Collectors are required to make pilgrimages to his former home in Syracuse at least once in their lifetimes and leave vintage cards there as a tribute. Ironically, Mr. Burdick was not a baseball fan.\n\nJunk Wax Era: Phrase to describe a period of extreme overproduction of sports cards, from roughly 1987-92, but some hobby elitists will have you think it began after World War II and ended during Obama’s first term. The “wax” is a reference to the wax wrappers that packaged the cards.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKids: The former backbone of The Hobby, until it was overtaken by pasty, middle-aged guys who could afford to drop $10-15 on a new pack of Bowman. (You still see kids occasionally at card shows, resembling a Mini-Me of Michael Douglas in “Wall Street” as they carry metal Halliburtons filled with shiny cards.)\n\nLCS: 1) Local Card Store (possibly arch.; see dealers). 2) League Championship Series, home of lengthy games with about 25 pitching changes before the 7th-inning stretch.\n\nMr. Mint: A hardcore investor who bragged about his high-grade finds in full-page ads in hobby periodicals in the 1980s and 90s. Another amazing study in human psychology: By all reports, he treated people like cowflop but they practically got on their hands and knees to do business with him anyway. Only in The Hobby or pro wrestling could someone like Mr. Mint exist.\n\nRip: Hip term to describe the simple act of opening a box or pack of cards. Many collectors/investors will brag about a good pull after a rip. If they get a bad pull, rippers tend to feel, well, ripped off.\n\nRefractor: Like chrome, only shinier.\n\nReprint: A reissue of a classic older card, like the 1909 T206 Honus Wagner card. Also the closest most of us will ever get to owning a vintage rookie card of a hobby god.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShort print: A card with a lower print run than other cards in a complete set. Used as an instrument of death by Topps on certain brands, where most of the short prints are of hobby gods. In the vintage era, card companies short-printed cards in order to keep kids coming back to the store to buy more gum.\n\nShiny: Derogatory term used by vintage collectors to describe the modern product, which emphasizes chrome, autos and relics over traditional base cards.\n\nThe National: Short for National Sports Collectors Convention, where pasty, middle-aged guys gather in team jerseys and cargo shorts every year to spend their life savings on cards and wait hours in line for autographs from grumpy old-time athletes. Not a recommended place to take a woman on your first date.\n\nUpper Deck: The company that introduced high pack prices, effectively driving kids out of The Hobby for once and for all and putting it firmly into the hands of — wait for it — pasty, middle-aged guys. Upper Deck predominately makes hockey cards these days.\n\nVintage: A very fancy term for old cards. Many hobby elitists think the vintage era ended with Prohibition."
