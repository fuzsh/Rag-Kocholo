        "text": "When you’re new to electronic music production, you begin to realise that there are so many jargon-y terms that you have no idea about.\n\nSome of them are technical, some of them are just straight up slang. Some of them are related to production, some of them to the industry, and everything in between.\n\nThis list aims to be the last glossary of terms you will ever need.\n\nSo make sure to bookmark this one! We are always updating this list, so feel free to drop us a line at [email protected].\n\nTable of Contents\n\nA | B | C | D | E | F | G | H | I | J | K | L | M | N | O | P | Q | R | S | T | U | V | W | X | Y | Z\n\nA\n\nA (Note) – A musical note.\n\nAAC – A lossy audio file format developed by Apple, with a slightly better compression algorithm than MP3 for quality. iTunes Store purchases are 256kbps AAC files.\n\nAAX (Avid Audio eXtension) – A plugin format more popular among audio engineers as opposed to producers – native to Avid Pro Tools only and requires a 64-bit system. The newer version of RTAS.\n\nAbleton Live – A popular DAW created by the company Ableton. Ableton Live is used by many artists like Skrillex, Flume and Diplo, and is very good in a live scenario. Ableton Live is the EDMProd Team’s DAW of choice.\n\nAlso see: Ableton Workflow Bible\n\nAC (Alternating Current) – An analogue electrical current used to power hardware. The default power you’ll find from a standard electrical outlet. ‘Alternating’ refers to the sine wave shape of the current.\n\nAcapella – A vocal, typically ripped or is a recording from an existing song. Used in remixes, bootlegs and sampled in originals. Also used in DJ sets as a DJ tool. Could also refer to a group of vocal singers (à la Pitch Perfect), but not usually in electronic music production.\n\nAcoustic Instrument – An instrument that produces sound in the physical world without digital or analogue technology. Can refer to a guitar, piano, drums etc. Referred to by older people as ‘real instruments’ 😉\n\nAcoustics – The sonic properties of any space that alter the qualities of a sound being played. Can refer to natural reverb, phase cancellation and/or background noise etc.\n\nAcoustic Treatment – The process of reducing acoustic inaccuracies and reflections in physical spaces by introducing dampening materials, such as foam and bass traps etc., in key areas.\n\nRecommended Reading: Acoustic Treatment 101\n\nActive – A device that has its own built-in power amplifier. The opposite of a passive device. Most studio monitors these days are active.\n\nA/D – Analogue to Digital Converter. Typically found in most Audio Interfaces to capture acoustic/analogue audio sources.\n\nAdditive Synthesis – A form of audio synthesis that outputs sound by mathematically adding harmonics (sine waves) to each other.\n\nADSR – Stands for Attack, Decay, Sustain and Release – refers to the envelope applied to a sound to shape it over time. Can be applied to the volume, filter, pitch or more. Can make things sound plucky, soft, or ambient etc.\n\nAftertouch – A MIDI parameter found on most keyboards. It senses the pressure applied to a key after it has been initially played, and then that can be mapped to control a specific modulation source, such as volume, a filter or anything.\n\nAIFF – Stands for Audio Interchange File Format. It is a high quality (lossless) audio file format created by Apple. Comparable to WAV or FLAC in terms of quality. Sounds pretty nice, and unlike WAV, it actually allows decent tagging.\n\nAliasing – Subtle distortion that occurs in the digital realm when the input frequency is higher than the sample rate. The sample cannot be measured accurately and thus introduces imperfections into the sound.\n\nAmbience – Can refer to a sound in a track which creates a sense of space or atmosphere – typically achieved by the use of time-based audio effects such as delays and reverbs. Also can refer to the level of sound in a recording that contains background noise, separate to the intended recording. Typically this background noise is undesirable, but sometimes it is an aesthetic choice.\n\nAmbient – A genre of music featuring drawn-out drones and pads, typically features no drums and is very stripped back and loop-based.\n\nAmen Break – When you stop producing to say a prayer. Not really, it’s actually one of the most sampled drum patterns of all time, a six-second clip from the song Amen Brother by The Winstons. Typically used in genres like Drum and Bass, Jungle and Breakbeat. You’ve definitely heard it before.\n\nAmp (Amplifier) – Typically refers to a hardware or digital emulation of an amplifier, which is a tool that increases the level of a signal to increase loudness. Different methods of amplification can colour the sound in pleasing ways, and thus an amp is also a creative tool, rather than just a functional one.\n\nAmplitude – Refers to the loudness or height of a waveform – higher means louder, lower means quieter. An amplitude of 0 (or -∞dB) means silence.\n\nAnalog(ue) – Audio that occurs in physical space as opposed to bits in the digital space. Analogue signals and technology are continuous and infinitely measurable, whereas digital signals are limited to the defined sample rate and bit depth. Thus, analogue is commonly referred to as having a warmer, more realistic sound.\n\nApple – Alright, you probably know this one already. But in case you don’t, Apple is the designer and manufacturer of laptops and desktops and has been the choice of audio professionals for years. Oh, and they’re one of the largest technology companies in the modern world.\n\nArpeggio (Arp) – A chord played in a series of repeating steps instead of at the same time. Makes you sound like a good producer without much of the effort.\n\nArpeggiator – A MIDI Effect that turns a static chord into an arpeggio. If that doesn’t make sense, it makes things go bleep-bleep-bleep.\n\nArrangement – The way that instruments and sections are laid out in a track/song. Referred to as Instrumentation and Structure, respectively. A very important concept in songwriting.\n\nArtist – Someone who creates music and releases it. Not just people who play the guitar.\n\nArturia – A hardware and software manufacturer responsible for a lot of analogue and analogue-modelled equipment. They make the V Collection, a collection of synths that model famous analogue synthesisers.\n\nAtmosphere – A sonic effect created by reverb, long tails and quieter sounds. Referred to as the background of a track.\n\nAttack – The initial part of an ADSR envelope – describes the amount of time for a sound to reach maximum amplitude in milliseconds or seconds. Faster attack sounds plucky and comes in straight away (low milliseconds), slower attack sounds spacey and takes a while to fade in (high seconds).\n\nAttenuation – The lowering of the loudness of a signal, usually measured in dB (decibels). The attenuation knob on a piece of gear or on a plugin is used to reduce increases in loudness introduced by other effects, such a distortion or amplification.\n\nAU (Audio Unit) – A plugin format created by Apple for macOS/OSX only. Other formats include VST, AAX and RTAS.\n\nAudacity – An audio editor used to edit audio, available on Windows and macOS. Powerful but lacks the functionality of a professional DAW like Ableton. Some people produce full tracks in it, yeah you heard me.\n\nAudio – Technically, this just refers to all sound that we hear in the range of human hearing (~20Hz-20000Hz). Commonly, audio is used to refer to a recording of a sound, particularly when on an audio track and it being played in a track’s arrangement.\n\nAudio Effect – Any plugin, stock effect or piece of gear that processes audio and alters the sonic properties of a sound. Can refer to EQ, compression, reverb, delay, distortion etc.\n\nAudio Engineering – The process of recording, mixing and mastering studio or live recordings.\n\nAudio Interface – A piece of hardware that can take sound as an input and also output sound. Most computers include a built-in sound card, but it is not a full audio interface, which is a more comprehensive and high-quality solution for music production and can be used to record instruments and output to studio monitors.\n\nAudio Track – A track that stores and plays audio, as opposed to a MIDI Track.\n\nAutomation – The modulation of a parameter over time, such as a filter sweep or volume change. Usually, automation is recorded into the arrangement of a track and automatically adjusts a parameter once recorded.\n\nRecommended Reading: The Definitive Guide to Automation\n\nAux Channel – A send or return channel that allows for additional parallel processing of multiple sources at once. For example, most people put reverb on an aux channel to allow group processing of multiple sounds that need reverb. Not to be confused with the cable that your friend asks for whenever they want to bump tunes in the car.\n\nAvid – The company behind Pro Tools.\n\nB\n\nB (Note) – A musical note.\n\nBalance – See ‘Pan’.\n\nBandcamp – A website allowing artists and labels to set up an independent store for selling music and merchandise. Great if you don’t want to work with labels or with major distribution services and remain fully independent. Certain niches of music still love to purchase songs rather than stream, and Bandcamp also allows vinyl records to be sold online.\n\nBand Pass Filter – A filter type that acts as both a low-pass and a high-pass, allowing only a narrow range of frequencies through. Can be used to get things to sound lo-fi.\n\nBand Stop Filter – See ‘Notch Filter’.\n\nBandwidth – The range of frequencies in an audio signal or stream, typically as a result of a limitation of technology (like a phone call recording).\n\nBank – A group of presets that can be loaded on a synth. Also called a soundbank. I wouldn’t put my money here, though.\n\nBar – A musical term describing a measure of beats. In electronic and dance music, typically this is a measure of 4 beats, but in different time signatures, it can be more or less. Can also refer to a lyrical section in a rap song. Or where you might DJ on the weekend. It’s a broad word, alright?\n\nBass – The lower frequencies in a sound – typically from ~20Hz to ~400Hz. Usually ‘dropped’ at some point in a track, if you know what I mean.\n\nBass Drum – See Kick.\n\nBassline – The pattern of notes that fills up the bass area of the frequency spectrum – can be played by a synthesiser, bass guitar, an 808 or any sound with tonal quality.\n\nBass Music – A form of EDM that typically features loud, compressed bass growls and sounds. Genres include dubstep, trap, bass house, drum and bass and many more.\n\nBeat – The consistent timing and rhythm of the music. Also can refer to a track, especially in hip-hop.\n\nBeatdown – See Breakdown.\n\nBeatmatch – A DJing process whereby two or more tracks are matched in time and tempo to ensure a seamless transition between the two. When someone has failed to beat-match and you can hear it, it is usually referred to as a trainwreck. It sounds awful, to be honest.\n\nBeat Repeat – A type of effect that takes audio as an input and repeats the snippet back at timed intervals to create a glitch effect.\n\nBeats – Sometimes used to refer to a genre of music that combines hip-hop with electronic, or something that a rapper would use as a track.\n\nBell – A synth sound that aims to have the sonic texture of a real bell, like tubular bells, a glockenspiel or similar.\n\nBell Curve – The most common curve on a parametric EQ, used to boost or cut a band of frequencies in a natural manner.\n\nBerklee – A reputable music school that is known around the world as the premier music college – very coveted school that lots of people in the music world strive to get in to.\n\nRecommended: Matt Lange – Ego, Berklee, and Working With BT\n\nBit Depth – The number of bits allowed for the dynamic range of an audio recording. Most audio is 16bit or 24bit, allowing for 65,536 or 16,777,215 levels of loudness, respectively. Most people can’t tell the difference, really.\n\nBitrate – The number of bits that are contained in an audio file every second, measured in kbps. 320kbps is an example of what an MP3 can store, whereas WAV usually has 1411kbps or higher. Higher usually means better quality. Can be CBR (constant) or VBR (variable). Below 128kbps is considered ‘poor-quality’.\n\nBitwig Studio – A DAW created by Bitwig available for macOS, Windows and Linux. Started by some former Ableton employees and is regarded as the only decent competitor to Ableton Live, having both a session and arrangement view and being robust enough for live performance.\n\nBoost – An adjustment on an EQ that increases the gain of a frequency spectrum. Also, see ‘Cut’.\n\nBootleg – When you remix a song without permission – normally done without a full set of stems and only with the audio from the original track or just an acapella.\n\nBounce – Not to be confused with Melbourne Bounce, a bounce is usually when audio is summed together and/or exported and/or internally recorded within a DAW. Also, see Freeze/Flatten.\n\nBPM – Beats Per Minute. Refers to the tempo, measured in the number of beats per minute. For example, a lot of house music is 128bpm.\n\nBrass – Can refer to an acoustic brass instrument or a type of synth sound that attempts to sound like a brass instrument. Think of cheesy 80’s music.\n\nBreak (Breakdown) – A lower-energy section of a track. Usually has some or all of the drums removed, and adds macro dynamics to a track.\n\nBreaks (Breakbeat) – Can refer to a genre of music or a sampled drum pattern that is not four-on-the-floor, like the Amen Break.\n\nBrickwall Filter – A specific, advanced filter type of low-pass or high-pass filter that has a very steep slope (dB/oct), which visually looks like a brick wall, due to the sudden rolloff. Used to remove frequencies above and below the human spectrum of hearing. Doesn’t sound too nice in the realm of human hearing.\n\nBrown Noise – A type of noise which is denser in the low end and contains less high-frequency content than both pink and white noise.\n\nBrowser – A features of most DAWs that allows you to browse files such as samples, presets and stock content in your software.\n\nBuild(up) – A section that leads into a drop – creates energy and tension in a track.\n\nBuss – Will not take you to the station, but will provide group audio processing of multiple sources of audio. For example, a drum buss may group a kick, snare, hats, rides and other percussion recordings into one channel (after initial processing) and allow for group processing, such as compression, EQ etc.\n\nBypass – When an effect is temporarily disabled so that the signal can be heard with the effect off. Usually included as a button or switch on effect plugins.\n\nC\n\nC (Note) – A musical note.\n\nCable – Connects devices together by transmitting audio or some form of digital/analogue data.\n\nCamel Audio – A defunct plugin company that created Camel Crusher and Camel Phat 3. Not to be confused with the music duo.\n\nCardioid Pattern – A common microphone polar pattern used for recording vocals – shaped like a heart and designed to record in a specific direction and reject background noise.\n\nCBR – Short for ‘Constant Bit Rate’, refers to the encoding of an MP3 at a bitrate that is consistent over the entire duration of the file. Opposite of VBR (Variable Bit Rate).\n\nCD – Stands for Compact Disc – a physical disk used for storing audio and data.\n\nChannel – a path that audio takes through an input to an output.\n\nChill – A loosely-defined term to describe the sound of more relaxed, deeper and melody-driven music in electronic music. Sometimes people refer to this as a genre in itself.\n\nChillstep – A sub-genre of Dubstep with an emphasis on melody, pads and less aggressive and loud elements. Notable artists include Blackmill, Mt Eden and Said The Sky.\n\nChord – A combination of musical notes played together (2-3 or more).\n\nChord Progression – A series of chords over time – serves as the harmonic foundation of a track or song.\n\nRecommended Reading: Different Chord Types and How to Make Them\n\nChorus (Structure) – The main section of a song that usually includes vocals or a melodic hook of some sort. Typically is featured multiple times throughout a track.\n\nChorus (Audio Effect) – A time-based effect that adds multiple delays\n\nClip – A section of audio or MIDI on a channel in a DAW.\n\nClipping – A type of distortion introduced when the audio peaks above the headroom within an analogue or digital domain. Analog clipping is called soft clipping, whereas digital clipping is called hard clipping, and is less pleasant.\n\nClock Signal – A MIDI signal that provides BPM information for devices to stay in time. One device usually outputs the signal and the others are a slave to the timing.\n\nCodec – An algorithm standard which compresses audio into a particular format for the purposes of reducing file size (e.g. LAME for MP3).\n\nCold – Refers to when a sound is harsh and digital, as opposed to warm, which is analogue and pleasant.\n\nCompander – A compressor and expander in one. Yep, it’s that simple.\n\nComping – A vocal recording process whereby multiple takes of the vocal are recorded, and the best parts of each take are edited together to create a more ‘perfect’ vocal.\n\nCompression – A dynamic range effect that reduces the level of a signal when it exceeds a certain volume. Used to even out the volume of dynamic sounds. Contrary to popular belief, compression by itself does not make things sound super fat, although it is a tool that can heavily squash audio, it also requires a gain boost after this process to bring it up to a louder level. Also, see ‘Ratio’ and ‘Threshold’.\n\nCondenser Microphone – A type of microphone that is more sensitive to loud sounds and is ideal for capturing less dynamic sounds, like vocals. Also, see ‘Dynamic Microphone’.\n\nCone – The part of a loudspeaker that vibrates due to the signal from the voice coil. Very sensitive – not for ice cream.\n\nController – A MIDI hardware device that controls the parameters of a piece of software or another device (e.g. a MIDI Keyboard.)\n\nControl Signal – Data in the digital domain that tells a parameter to be modulated.

Not a place to line up.\n\nCurve – In most cases, refers to the frequency response\n\nCutoff Frequency – A control on a filter that specifies where the frequencies will ramp off.\n\nCycle – A complete playthrough of a waveform. When talking about how many cycles occur in one second, it is measured in Hertz (Hz). Not a bike.\n\nD\n\nD (Note) – A musical note.\n\nD/A – Digital to Analogue converter. Typically found in most Audio Interfaces to transform digital information from a computer to studio monitors or speakers for playback.\n\nDamping – This has multiple definitions, but generally refers to the reducing of natural reverberations, particularly in the high frequencies.\n\nDance Music – A term for EDM referring to genres that are specifically made to dance to, like house, techno, trance, hard dance, garage and many more.\n\nDAW (Digital Audio Workstation) – Pronounced like ‘door’ or ‘dee-ay-doubleyou’, a DAW is the centrepiece of the modern studio – the software in which music is created. Ableton Live, FL Studio, Logic Pro and many more are all DAWs. Non-producers can get very confused when you say this word.\n\nRecommended Reading: Music Production Software Guide\n\nDC Offset – An amplitude offset of a sound caused by very low, usually inaudible frequencies. Many audio effects have the option to add a DC filter to remove these frequencies.\n\nDecay – The second stage of the standard ADSR envelope after the attack. Refers to the amount of time taken, once the maximum volume is reached, to reduce the signal’s amplitude to the specified sustain level (in dB).\n\nDecibel (dB) – The standard measurement for loudness. Note that dB is a ratio measurement, always requiring a reference point from which to measure. Common dB measurements include dBFS (digital audio, where 0dB is clipping), dBA and dB SPL (acoustics, where 0dB is near silence).\n\nDe-esser – A type of multiband compressor that specifically acts on the frequency bands where sibilance is likely to occur. Removes ‘sss’ type sounds from vocals.\n\nDelay – A time-based audio effect that creates a series of echoes occurring at intervals one after the other, gradually decaying to nothing.\n\nDemo – An nearly finished track sent to a label as a submission to be released. Can be sent to other producer/DJs for playing out live too.\n\nDetune – Refers to the amount of tuning difference between voices on an oscillator when unison is activated.

Depending on the application, different mics have different-sized diaphragms.\n\nDigging – The process of looking through music sources to find material to use as a sample in a track. The preceding meaning was specifically through crates of vinyl records, but in the modern era, it can refer to digital digging through sites like YouTube, Spotify and many more.\n\nDigital – Audio that exists in the digital realm as bits and bytes, as opposed to continuous analogue signals.\n\nDisco – A genre of dance music that originated in the 1970s in the US – stylised by the use of drums with a bassline, synths and guitar.\n\nDistortion – The processing of audio such that extra harmonics and loudness are added, creating a more fuller or aggressive sound. Distortion types include tube, clipping, tape, diode, overdrive, fuzz and many more.\n\nDistribution – The process of distributing your music to stores and streaming platforms. Can be done independently or handled by a label.\n\nDJ – Stands for Disc Jockey – someone who plays recorded music in a live scenario by mixing tracks together. Most producers\n\nDJ Mix – Not to be confused with a mixdown, a DJ mix is a live recording of a DJ mixing multiple tracks together over a period of time.\n\nDoppler Effect – The sonic effect of frequencies sounding higher pitched when moving closer to an audio source, and lower pitched when moving away. Like when you drive past a police siren.\n\nDouble – The process of recording a vocal twice, both times sounding very similar, to achieve a layered effect.\n\nDownload Gate – A website or service that exchanges social currency (e.g. Facebook like or Soundcloud repost) for a free track download.\n\nDrop – The main section of an EDM song which contains most of the energy and loudness in comparison to the rest of the track.

Notable drum machines include the Roland TR808 and 909.\n\nDrum Pattern – A phrase that a combination of drums and percussion plays. This pattern can repeat and is usually a bar or more long.\n\nRecommended Reading: The Ultimate Guide to Drum Programming\n\nDrum Rack – An Ableton instrument that allows drum samples to be triggered by MIDI notes like a drum kit, similar to a multisampler but for drums.\n\nDry – An unprocessed version of a signal, as opposed to wet, which is the processed version. A Dry/Wet knob blends these two signals, and it can be found on effects such as reverb.\n\nDSP (Digital Signal Processing) – Any audio processing that occurs in the digital domain.\n\nDub – A copy of a track, sometimes with edits applied. Also can refer to the genre similar to Reggae, or sometimes is short for Dubstep.\n\nDubstep – A bass music genre characterised by half time 140bpm drum patterns with bass wobbles and heavy compression. Can range from subtle to heavy.\n\nDynamic Microphone – A type of microphone which has lower sensitivity and is better at recording loud sources, such as drums and guitars. Does usually not require phantom power.\n\nDynamic Range – Refers to the amount of dB between the highest point in the tracks’ amplitude and the lowest point. Low differences mean lower dynamic range and vice versa.\n\nDynamic Tube – An audio effect that emulates tube distortion introduced by hardware units. Often sounds harmonically pleasing and changes character dependant on the input material.\n\nDynamics – Describes that characteristics of amplitude differences in audio. A set of dynamics processors can include a compressor, expander and limiter (+ more).\n\nE\n\nE (Note) – A musical note.\n\nEarly Reflections – Part of a reverb tail, the early reflections describe the initial body of reverb that comes from natural or algorithmic reverb.\n\nEcho – A time-based effect introduced by delay, however, echo usually refers to an analogue delay as opposed to a digital-sounding one.\n\nEdit – Can mean either an edit of a track, perhaps to change the structure or introduce a new element, or can refer to the audio editing process.\n\nEDM – Stands for Electronic Dance Music. EDM technically describes the overall genre of anything electronic-sounding and produced by computers and electronics, but typically is used to describe more commercial sounding electronic dance music.\n\nRecommended: What is Electronic Dance Music (EDM)?\n\nEDMProd – Look, we had to include ourselves.

Good for making things super punchy.\n\nF\n\nF (Note) – A musical note.\n\nFabFilter – A software company that makes both mixing and creative plugins such as Pro-Q, Pro-L and Saturn. They are pretty fab.\n\nFade – The process of adjusting the volume over time, usually to bring a sound in from silence, or from max volume to silence.\n\nFader – A physical or virtual slider on a mixer that adjusts the volume of a particular track, and is a primary tool in doing a mixdown.\n\nFat – A term usually used to describe when a sound or mix fills the frequency spectrum and is wide in the stereo image. Or just when something sounds good. “Dude that sounds fat!”\n\nFeedback (FX) – When an effect feeds the output signal back into the input signal, like a delay or distortion, to exaggerate the effect. When a delay has high feedback, the delay has a longer tail.\n\nFidelity – Refers to the quality of the audio. High fidelity meaning high quality, and low fidelity meaning low quality, in terms of bitrate/sample rate.\n\nField Recording – A type of recording that records the sound of a particular areas’ natural soundscape.
