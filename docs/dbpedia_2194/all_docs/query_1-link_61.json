        "text": "While an instrument’s design is the greatest determining factor for the quality of sound, the type of wood used also has a subtle effect on the sound’s tone and quality. This is due to the varying properties of each wood type, or even between different pieces of the same type of wood. Wood with an open grain or pore structure will have a rougher surface, causing turbulence as the air passes by it. The result is a warmer, more covered, and diffused tone. Whereas wood with smaller pores and a smoother surface will produce a brighter, more focused sound. As a result, each wood type has its own unique character of sound.\n\nKeep in mind that, while we can do our best to describe each tone, choosing the wood that is right for you is a very personal choice, and nothing can replace hearing the instruments for yourself. If you are interested in comparing a few different wood types, check out our Instruments on Approval page or contact us for a consult.\n\nNote: Recorder blocks or plugs are almost universally made of cedar, although some manufacturers have begun to use ceramic or synthetic materials."
