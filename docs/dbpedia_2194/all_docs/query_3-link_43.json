        "text": "ALTERNATIVES TO SELF-HARM\n\nSnap a rubber band around your wrist.\n\nFind a thick rubber band and put it around your wrist. When you feel the need to cut snap the rubber band until the urge subsides.\n\nDraw on yourself with sharpie/draw pretend wounds where you want to cut.\n\nIt’s a physiological thing. Your mind sees red where you want to cut, and sometimes the urge goes away. Or, instead of cutting you can buy brand new sharpies with semi sharp edges and draw on the undersides of your arms. It can also be fun and artistic.\n\nWhen you want to cut, go outside and distract yourself, or pick up a hobby.\n\nIf possible, go on a walk. It’s a good idea to get some fresh air where these thought’s don’t seem to trap you. Exercise is a natural way of releasing endorphins, a similar reaction to harming oneself. Good hobbies to pick up are painting, or writing in a journal. You don’t have to be good at it; nobody will be critiquing your work. It’s a healthy way to express emotion, which is highly beneficial. Sit and draw, or read a book. Whatever you’re comfortable with works!\n\nA very simple one, blast music.\n\nOne of my various mottos: Headphones in, world out. Just get some music, somewhat cheerful preferably, and tune out the world. Embrace music, and embrace yourself. Feel free to dance like a hooligan as well.\n\nFor every cut you have, you have to wait one day to cut again.\n\nLet’s say you’ve cut 5 times. 5 cuts. Wait 5 days to cut again. See if you can do it. It’s an alternative to driving yourself crazy by trying to stop cold turkey. Because, you’re not stoppingcompletely. This is also a pact you can make with someone who desires you to stop SI. Or for burns/bruises etc, you can wait until it heals to ‘X’ point before doing it again.\n\nPractice Mindfulness (Meditate):\n\nPut on some light music or find a quiet place and try to clear your mind. Take deep breaths and try to control your heart beat. Try to observe everything that is going on around you in the moment. (You don’t even have to sit in the stupid pretzel position!) If you’re going to cry, then let the tears flow. This is your personal time to relax and do whatever you want. A piece of advice, it is better to focus on something that’s NOT stress or trigger related.\n\nOther Ideas:\n\nTake a hot or cold shower. Not luke warm and take your time!\n\nPlay an instrument if you have one.\n\nRun an ice cube down wherever you SI. Do it until it melts away completely. It’s a sub for those urges and feelings.\n\nGet a ballpoint pen, the finest one you can find, and when you want to cut use the pen to make lines. It’s unlikely to cut you (unless you keep going over it..dont recommend that) but thin pens are sharp and scratchy and cause the closest thing to the sting from cutting I have found. It will also leave red marks there for a day or two which could be good or bad, depending on where you do it\n\nPluck your brows. It hurts.\n\nWrite what you’re feeling in a book, then use whatever you normally SI with to destroy the page. (If you burn, make sure you have something to smother potential fire with nearby!)\n\nWrap bandages around your area of SI(draw bloody patches on it if you must). It will deter you from SI in that area.\n\nPull the hair on your legs and cut it with your tool. The pulling sensation causes pain and could curb your urges\n\nTake a notebook and hand write all the nice things people have said to you. Either from tumblr, real life or what have you. When you’re triggered you must read the book front to back before you’re allowed to do anything to yourself.\n\nMake a playlist of songs exactly how you’re feeling at the moment. Triggering, soothing, it’s all up to you. Optional; You must listen to it all the way through before getting up and harming yourself.\n\nPlease keep in mind that unfortunately, not everything on this list will work for everyone.\n\nSo, if you try something and it doesn’t work for you, don’t get discouraged! Remember, sometimes the point of trying things is to prove they don't work. Some of these choices are complicated, and you might want to utilize the help of a therapist or trusted friend when undertaking them. Recovery is not a process that can be walked through alone, so don’t be afraid to reach out for help.\n\nAlternatives for when you’re feeling angry or restless:\n\nScribble on photos of people in magazines\n\nViciously stab an orange\n\nThrow an apple/pair of socks against the wall\n\nHave a pillow fight with the wall\n\nScream very loudly\n\nTear apart newspapers, photos, or magazines\n\nGo to the gym, dance, exercise\n\nListen to music and sing along loudly\n\nDraw a picture of what is making you angry\n\nBeat up a stuffed bear\n\nPop bubble wrap\n\nPop balloons\n\nSplatter paint\n\nScribble on a piece of paper until the whole page is black\n\nFilling a piece of paper with drawing cross hatches\n\nThrow darts at a dartboard\n\nGo for a run\n\nWrite your feelings on paper then rip it up\n\nUse stress relievers\n\nBuild a fort of pillows and then destroy it\n\nThrow ice cubes at the bathtub wall, at a tree, etc\n\nGet out a fine tooth comb and vigorously brush the fur of a stuffed animal (but use gentle vigor)\n\nSlash an empty plastic soda bottle or a piece of heavy cardboard or an old shirt or sock\n\nMake a soft cloth doll to represent the things you are angry at; cut and tear it instead of yourself\n\nFlatten aluminium cans for recycling, seeing how fast you can go\n\nOn a sketch or photo of yourself, mark in red ink what you want to do. Cut and tear the picture\n\nBreak sticks\n\nCut up fruits\n\nMake yourself as comfortable as possible\n\nStomp around in heavy shoes\n\nPlay handball or tennis\n\nYell at what you are breaking and tell it why you are angry, hurt, upset, etc.\n\nBuy a cheap plate and decorate it with markers, stickers, cut outs from magazines, words, images, what ever that expresses your pain and sadness and when you’re done, smash it. (Please be careful when doing this)\n\nThe Calm Jar (Fill a mason jar or similar with colored water and glitter. When feeling upset or angry you can shake it to disturb the glitter and focus on that until the glitter settles.)\n\nBlow up a balloon and pop it\n\nAlternatives that will give you a sensation (other than pain) without harming yourself:\n\nHold ice in your hands, against your arm, or in your mouth\n\nRun your hands under freezing cold water\n\nSnap a rubber band or hair band against your wrist\n\nClap your hands until it stings\n\nWax your legs\n\nDrink freezing cold water\n\nSplash your face with cold water\n\nPut PVA/Elmer’s glue on your hands then peel it off\n\nMassage where you want to hurt yourself\n\nTake a hot shower/bath\n\nJump up and down to get some sensation in your feet\n\nWrite or paint on yourself\n\nArm wrestle with a member of your family\n\nTake a cold bath\n\nBite into a hot pepper or chew a piece of ginger root\n\nPut tiger balm on the places you want to cut. (Tiger balm is a muscle relaxant cream that induces a tingly sensation. You can find it in most health food stores and vitamin stores.)\n\nAlternatives that will distract you or take up time:\n\nSay “I’ll self harm in fifteen minutes if I still want to” and keep going for periods of fifteen minutes until the urge fades\n\nColor your hair\n\nCount up to ten getting louder until you are screaming\n\nSing on the karaoke machine\n\nComplete something you’ve been putting off\n\nTake up a new hobby\n\nMake a cup of tea\n\nTell and laugh at jokes\n\nPlay solitaire\n\nCount up to 500 or 1000\n\nSurf the net\n\nMake as many words out of your full name as possible\n\nCount ceiling tiles or lights\n\nSearch ridiculous things on the web\n\nColour coordinate your wardrobe\n\nPlay with toys, such as a slinky\n\nGo to the park and play on the swings\n\nCall up an old friend\n\nGo “people watching”\n\nCarry safe, rather than sharp, things in your pockets\n\nDo school work\n\nPlay a musical instrument\n\nWatch TV or a movie\n\nPaint your nails\n\nAlphabetize your CDs or books\n\nCook\n\nMake origami to occupy your hands\n\nDoodle on sheets of paper\n\nDress up or try on old clothes\n\nPlay computer games or painting programs, such as photoshop\n\nWrite out lyrics to your favorite song\n\nPlay a sport\n\nRead a book/magazine\n\nDo a crossword\n\nDraw a comic strip\n\nMake a chain link out of paper counting the hours or days you’ve been self harm free using pretty colored paper\n\nKnit, sew, or make a necklace\n\nMake ‘scoobies’ - braid pieces of plastic or lace, to keep your hands busy\n\nBuy a plant and take care of it\n\nHunt for things on eBay or Amazon\n\nBrowse the forums\n\nGo shopping\n\nMemorize a poem with meaning\n\nLearn to swear in another language\n\nLook up words in a dictionary\n\nPlay hide-and-seek with your siblings\n\nGo outside and watch the clouds roll by\n\nPlan a party\n\nFind out if any concerts will be in your area\n\nMake your own dance routine\n\nTrace your hand on a piece of paper; on your thumb, write something you like to look at; on your index finger, write something you like to touch; on your middle finger, write your favorite scent; on your ring finger, write something you like the taste of; on your pinky finger, write something you like to listen to; on your palm, write something you like about yourself\n\nPlan regular activities for your most difficult time of day\n\nFinish homework before it’s due\n\nTake a break from mental processing\n\nNotice black and white thinking\n\nGet out on your own, get away from the stress\n\nGo on YouTube\n\nMake a scrapbook\n\nColour in a picture or colouring book.\n\nMake a phone list of people you can call for support.
