        "text": "Please allow us to introduce the original guitar finishing wax – Monty’s Instrument Food\n\nIf you are looking to indulge your guitar Monty’s outrageously decadent Instrument Food is your only choice.\n\nInstrument Food is the perfect solution for conditioning fingerboards made from rosewood, ebony, or any open grain wood. These woods are always at the mercy of the elements, they absorb the dirt and sweat from your hands and will dry out over time, leading to cracking and permanent damage to your guitar neck.\n\nMonty’s Instrument Food fends this off by penetrating the bare wood and with its magic formula, feeding it with all kinds of glorious, natural deliciousness, while at the same time sealing in that goodness to give the wood a longer life, smooth feel, and a wonderful lustre.\n\nUnlike most ‘lemon’ oils, Monty’s Instrument Food is all-natural and doesn’t contain any solvents. While solvents are effective at cleaning fretboards, they also dry them out leading to unpleasant, permanent problems if used in conditioners.\n\nWe use it on every open guitar fingerboard that comes across our bench, applying it after cleaning and before buffing.\n\nIt is also great for many other luthier jobs, sealing and conditioning any type of open-grained wood, it is great on the back of stripped guitar necks, giving them a glassy smoothness, lubricating screw heads to preserve the thread and avoid stripping, lubricating guitar nuts for the perfect setup and we have even used it to coat entire unfinished guitar bodies, sealing them while still allowing the wood to breathe.\n\nMonty's Instrument Food is also available in a Monty's coffee mug, perfect for techs, luthiers, or anybody doing seriously industrial amounts of tinkering. We have these mugs of Instrument Food on all our own workbenches and, with almost six times as much Instrument Food as a regular tin, they last for ages."
