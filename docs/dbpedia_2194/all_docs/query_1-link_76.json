        "text": "If you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website, SheKnows may receive an affiliate commission.\n\nIf you’ve made the switch from burning scented candles to using wax warmers then you’ve probably vowed to never go back. Not only are wax warmers safer than burning candles (no need for an open flame), but they’re also healthier because you’re not introducing soot into the air. There’s a wax warmer on Target‘s website that works the same way your favorite plug-in air freshener does, but it also doubles as a nightlight and is honestly a piece of art you’ll want to always keep on display. And right now, you can save over 70 percent when you pick it up today.\n\nThe VP Home Home Sweet Home Electric Wax Warmer, normally priced at $50, is a mosaic wax warmer that plugs into any standard outlet. The heat from the included 250-watt bulb, which can easily be replaced when it’s time, slowly melts your favorite wax cube and diffuses a delicious smell into the room while the light peeks through the tinted glass, adding a bit of magic to your space (or to help you find your way to the bathroom in the middle of the night).\n\nIt’s basically a little fairy light that makes your house smell good!\n\nThe VP Home wax warmer plug-in comes in a variety of beautiful mosaic styles, but the pink one is the only style that’s still in stock. It’s bright, cheery, and only $15 during this rare Target sale, so grab one now if you’ve fallen hard for wax warmers.\n\nGreat as a nightlight and even better as a scent diffuser, this little plug-in will enhance any room you put it in in more ways than one. Grab it now while it’s marked down over 70 percent off on Target’s website."
