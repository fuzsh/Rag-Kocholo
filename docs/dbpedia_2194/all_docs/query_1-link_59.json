        "text": "The Repair Shop at Music & Arts guarantees the highest quality service for musical instrument repairs, and sanitation. Our musical instrument repair technicians are seasoned professionals who have apprenticed with master instrument makers and trained at the best technical colleges, and because we are the best, we find a social responsibility to educate musicians on the specific terminology regarding instrument cleaning or sanitization.\n\nIt is important to understand there are often 3 different terms some shops may use when advertising instrument cleaning.\n\nSanitization:\n\nCleaning or Sanitization, is the removal of visible soil (e.g., organic and inorganic material) from objects and surfaces and normally is accomplished manually or mechanically using water with detergents or enzymatic products.\n\nThorough cleaning is essential before high-level disinfection and sterilization because inorganic and organic materials that remain on the surfaces of instruments interfere with the effectiveness of these processes. Decontamination removes pathogenic microorganisms from objects so they are safe to handle, use, or discard.\n\nIs this good for your instrument? Yes, this is the least invasive in both chemical usage and manual labor.\n\nDisinfection:\n\nDisinfection describes a process that eliminates many or all pathogenic microorganisms, except bacterial spores, on inanimate objects.\n\nIn health-care settings, objects usually are disinfected by liquid chemicals or wet pasteurization. Each of the various factors that affect the efficacy of disinfection can nullify or limit the efficacy of the process.\n\nIs this good for your instrument: Yes, however the finish on wood instruments are delicate and can be damaged with some chemicals.\n\nSterilization:\n\nSterilization describes a process that destroys or eliminates all forms of microbial life and is carried out in health-care facilities by physical or chemical methods.\n\nSteam under pressure, dry heat, EtO gas, hydrogen peroxide gas plasma, and liquid chemicals are the principal sterilizing agents used in health-care facilities.\n\nWhen chemicals are used to destroy all forms of microbiologic life, they can be called chemical sterilants. These same germicides used for shorter exposure periods also can be part of the disinfection process (i.e., high-level disinfection).\n\nIs this good for your instrument? Not necessarily. Heat, gas, chemicals and other extreme methods could damage the materials and permanently damage the instrument.\n\nSanitization Process at The Repair Shop at Music & Arts:\n\nAt our repair shop, we take explicit care to make sure that your instrument receives the specific treatment it needs to preserve its materials and keep it in top playing, sanitized condition.\n\nProducts Used:\n\nDetergent\n\nIsopropanol\n\nAll-purpose Cleaner\n\nUltrasonic Solution 132B (diluted phosphoric acid)\n\nDisinfectant Germicide\n\nDenatured Alcohol\n\nCommercial Grade Degreaser\n\nCommercial Grade Cream Polish\n\nCommercial Grade Wax Remover\n\nWoodwinds: Flutes, Clarinets, Saxophones, Oboes, Bass Clarinets, Piccolos, Bassoons\n\nPlastic mouthpieces\n\nHead joints\n\nBodies and Keys\n\nInner bore\n\nBrass Instruments: Trumpets, Trombones\n\nMouthpieces\n\nBodies, Slides, Pistons, Valves\n\nString Instruments: Violin, Viola, Cello, Bass, Guitar\n\nFinished surfaces: Scroll and body\n\nChin rests, pegs, and tail pieces\n\nNeck and fingerboard\n\nStrings\n\nAll Instrument Cases\n\nInterior\n\nExterior\n\nExtreme situations\n\nInstruments that have mold, stubborn odors, or other extreme sanitary threats are fully disassembled and cleaned in our Ultrasonic cleaners, then sanitized using disinfectant.\n\nMORE ABOUT THE REPAIR SHOP\n\nAt the Repair Shop at Music & Arts, our qualified repair technicians can fix, clean and sanitize almost any musical instrument.
