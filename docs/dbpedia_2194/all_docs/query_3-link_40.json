        "text": "My Sauna History\n\nBut first, I'll catch you up on my history with saunas. In January 2020, I joined LA Fitness for no other reason than to access their sauna. It was a dry sauna, and temperatures got quite hot. So hot that it would take a lot of mental strength to stay sitting in the sauna past twenty minutes. I would leave soaking wet from sweat but feeling great.\n\nAlthough I loved how it made me feel, there were many downsides to the gym sauna. For example, sharing a small space with many people packed in like sardines, especially during peak hours (pre-Covid). I found that the sauna users were generally rude and not mindful of other people. I'd often deal with others' disrespectful behaviors while trying to relax or meditate, such as talking on the phone, having loud conversations, listening to music through phone speakers, or headphones so loud that others could hear.\n\nIt would frustrate me, but I'd put up with it for the sauna experience. Then back at the beginning of March 2020, they closed my gym sauna to remodel it. Then by the end of March, Covid hit hard, and the gyms closed altogether. I canceled my gym membership when the gym's reopened, but the sauna's remained closed.\n\nMy sauna days were behind me until a friend told me that her chiropractor suggested that she join this Hot Worx studio for the infrared health benefits. I had heard about Hot Worx, and when she told me I could try it for free, I figured I had nothing to lose.\n\nI was interested in access to the Hot Worx sauna for relaxing more than the workouts. I run daily, and I lift weights in my home gym, the #shredshed, five days a week, so while I recognize my body would probably benefit from Yoga practice, I don't have any more room in my week for more workouts.\n\nMy Free Trial Session at Hot Worx\n\nI made an appointment and showed up on a Saturday for my free trial session. The studio manager was friendly, gave me a tour of the saunas, and explained the different workouts. They have multiple private sauna spaces that play pre-recorded training sessions on small screens. Typically, they would put three people in a room, but due to Covid restrictions, they were limiting them to one person per room (unless you were in the same party). Perfect, none of the annoyance of the overcrowded gym sauna. (Update: the Covid restrictions are lifted now, so the potential for tree people to a room is back.)\n\nThey have a phone app to book a time in advance to work out the same day or the following day, which is quite convenient.\n\nShe placed me in a Hot Pilates room, and I shared my intention of not doing the workout but relaxing instead, as I had already worked out that day. She agreed that this was fine, that people sometimes choose to turn the volume down on the workout and relax in the sauna.\n\nShe provided me with a bamboo mat (that wouldn't melt in the heat) and a large towel but said that I would need to rent or purchase them for future sessions. I did a quick Amazon search, and the price they were charging for a Bamboo mat was comparable to what was available online (I believe, $40-$50), so I bought the mat and opted to bring a towel from home. I later purchased an inexpensive Yoga towel on Amazon.\n\nAt first, I was concerned that it wouldn't get hot enough because it was an infrared sauna and not a dry sauna like the gym. I cranked that sucker up as high as it would go, 130 degrees. It turns out because I could breathe normally, and the temperature didn't immediately drench me in sweat, I was able to stay in the room for 40 minutes without any trouble. It was more enjoyable overall!\n\nHot Worx Membership\n\nAfter my free trial, I was ready to sign up.\n\nI paid $59 down and $59 per month for a three-month commitment. After three months, your membership moves month to month, but they require sixty days' notice on cancellation, so you are locked in for the first five months once you sign up.\n\nShe explained this pretty clearly before I signed anything; I'd imagine this could be a frustrating point if not specifically called out. I don't have any plans to cancel soon, so I agreed to the commitment.\n\nRemember, they require you to purchase a bamboo mat that won't melt in the heat, but you can buy that anywhere you choose.\n\nThe Workouts\n\nI spent the first year of my membership relaxing in the saunas, foam rolling, stretching, meditating, but not participating in the workouts, but that all changed when I was in a minor accident (I’m fine! Thanks for asking!) that limited my ability to run regularly. I started doing the classes to supplement my weight lifting.\n\nThe workouts last about thirty minutes and are appropriate for all levels, including beginners.\n\nHot Barre None\n\nMy first workout experience at Hot Worx was the Hot Barre None workout. It's called Barre None because, of course, inside the sauna, there is not a ballet barre. To be clear, even though I consider myself fit and strong, I haven't done a Barre class in probably a decade. I would consider myself a beginner in these workouts, and I expected to struggle much more than I did. It was kind of awkward because the virtual instructor used the back sauna wall as \"the barre\" for support, so she was facing away from the camera for most of the session. If I were also facing away from the TV to follow her lead, I wouldn't have been able to see what she was doing, so I essentially just balanced without support on the moves to see the instructor. Most of the movements in the workout were isometric (holding the pose) or pulsing, or a combination of the two. Of course, there were some \"burning\" muscles, but this was a beginner-friendly workout that I at times felt too easy, but I was embracing the low-intensity and enjoyed the training overall. Although it gave me a false sense of security that all the workouts would be this easy, which was not the care.\n\nHot Core\n\nMaybe my experience with the Hot Barre None workout led me to overestimate my abilities, but the hot core workout was more challenging. Again, this workout primarily consisted of isometric holds focusing on the core (remember, the core is above the thighs and below the chest 360 degrees).\n\nHot Yoga\n\nOf all the classes I have taken so far, this one is my favorite. It's a beginner-friendly Yoga class with classic poses achievable for even a clumsy runner like me.\n\nHot Pilates\n\nBefore I came to Hot Worx, I could count the number of Pilates classes I have taken in my entire life on one hand. While my lack of flexibility was evident in this class, I enjoyed it more, knowing I had room to grow here.\n\nHot Bands\n\nThis class was the most surprisingly difficult. As someone who regularly lifts heavy barbells and dumbells, I thought the Hot Bands session would be a breeze, but I was mistaken. While most of the other hot workouts centered around isometrics between 20 and 60 seconds for one to three sets, the hot bands consisted of multiple slow and controlled reps, holding for about five seconds each. You need to bring your band to the class. Next time, I will wear socks because you stand on the band for many of the exercises, and when I pulled tension into the bands, it would hurt the bottoms of my bare feet.\n\nHot Iso\n\nWhile I liked the Virtual Instructor of this class, this may have been the most challenging effort class. Maybe it was because the first time I tried this class was immediately after a hot cycle, but it was one of the only classes where I struggled to hold the isometrics for the duration assigned. I look forward to seeing how can I can improve with repeated sessions.\n\nHot Cycle\n\nI was there at an unstaffed time, and I couldn't figure out how to adjust the seat height. I forgot to turn the sound up and adjust the temperature, and it seemed there was less time between classes to get situated. I jumped in the best I could. I'm not an indoor cycle kind of gal; I am a runner! I fully expected it to be a suffer-fest of grand proportions, but this high-intensity interval workout was surprisingly achievable for fifteen minutes. Maybe I was too conservative with my work intervals, so I will be experimenting with the hard-effort intervals to push myself further.\n\nThere are a few classes that I haven’t taken yet but will update this post as I do.\n\nWorkout Progression\n\nWhile the workouts are great if you are starting your practice, my only concern is I was told they update the workouts every three months. The body adapts quickly; for most people, three to six weeks, so if you continue to do the same exercises over and over for three to six months, you may stop progressing. Even when the workouts change, they are still at the same level of difficulty.\n\nIt's best to look for ways to advance as you get stronger to see new results. It is why many people stall or plateau in their efforts; the body gets accustomed to the stress placed on it, and it stops responding.\n\nYou, of course, can work to make the exercises more challenging as you get stronger. Working with a trainer is beneficial because the trainer can help make sure you add appropriate, incremental increases in demands on the body. Even in a live class setting, an instructor would get to know their clients and ensure that the more advanced students progress appropriately to continue seeing results. The pre-recorded instructors show variations to make the exercises more appropriate for beginners and also more challenging, which is a start.\n\nI am not suggesting these are not great workouts, or you shouldn't do them, (I am kind of obsessed). Be aware it becomes your job to make sure you are making the exercises more challenging as you get stronger since a virtual instructor can't do it. It's not a knock-on Hot Worx workouts specifically; it's a typical problem with any pre-recorded exercises, streaming service, or apps not tailored for the individual.\n\nIf you are a runner and not currently strength training, these types of workouts can provide a lot of the core strength, balance, and stability that will benefit running performance. If you need help with strength training for runners beyond this, please reach out to me for help.\n\nHot Worx Marketing Language\n\nMy review is mostly positive, I only have one small gripe with their marketing language, but this is not exclusive to Hot Worx; this is typical marketing language across the fitness industry, especially in the hot Yoga, Barre, Pilates space.\n\n\"Detox your body.\"\n\n\"Get long, lean muscles.\"\n\n\"Foam roll to reduce cellulite.\"\n\n\"Speed up your metabolism.\"\n\n\"Burns fat.\"\n\nWhile all these statements may have an inkling of the truth, it's mostly marketing language with no real science behind the statements.\n\nI recommend this podcast to help simplify and break down the science behind Infrared saunas.\n\nThe instructors make these comments during the workouts; it's slightly annoying, but it's so rampant in the industry, it's hard to escape. I turn the volume down and silently roll my eyes. Problem solved.\n\nNow that I got that out of the way let's talk about the benefits I've experienced.\n\nHot Worx Benefits\n\nI have a hard time with all the detox talk around there, no one can really explain what is being detoxed and don’t even get me started on the supplement commercials they play between classes. Spoiler alert: You don’t need to take supplements to “enhance” your detox, “clean natural energy” or any of the other bullshit products they are pushing. Sorry for being so blunt, but I feel strongly about this—save your money."
