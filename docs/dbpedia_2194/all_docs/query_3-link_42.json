The results are immediate, plus the added lash colour boost creates a mascara-type effect so you are always ready to go.\n\nFree Hair Conditioning Treatment\n\nEnjoy a professional salon treatment for FREE. With all colour services before the end of November 2016 we are offering a complimentary L’Oréal Powerdose treatment worth £5.00.\n\nThis is a wonderful treatment for coloured hair with long lasting results to restore and prolong the colour of the hair.
