We spoke about many things and she instantly made me feel comfortable. She’s also very qualified as she told me how often I need to wax and it was such an amazing experience. I am definitely coming back here again!!! Thank you Mia, you’re amazing.\n\nMelanie R.Google review\n\n“\n\nThe most welcoming and friendly experience! The salon very clean and beautifully designed, Adelina and Tanya are very professional and made me feel as comfortable and at ease during my waxing. I highly recommend to anyone looking for a full body wax. I will definitely be back soon! Thank you xxx\n\nRanjitaGoogle review\n\n“\n\nSeamless booking process for male waxing treatment. Highly professional staff and the service provided by Julia was exceptional - comfortable and pain-free treatment, coupled with an excellent attitude and great personality. I will return. Thank you.\n\nChris O.Google review\n\n“\n\nI’ve been a regular since this place opened. Lovely, clean, stylish decor. Each room is well furnished. Clean toilet. Friendly staff and receptionist. Amazing wax, (almost) painless. The hot wax used is also high quality, you will notice the difference. Fran is amazing but always booked up (for good reason!). All the aestheticians here seem excellent.\n\nTasnima K.Google review\n\n“\n\nWent for waxing appointment. Great service, was really impressed. First time I have been to Pure Wax, have used the same beautician for 10 years so I was a bit worried. Perfect results, clean, friendly. Adelina is lovely. I will be back. Definitely recommend.\n\nK.

I’m a nervous client and Justina really put me at ease. She was also very thorough and insisted on making sure it was perfect. This got great results and I am very happy with the quality of the wax, easily the neatest I’ve ever had and very good value for money. Thank you Justina!\n\nJessicaTreatwell review\n\n“\n\nSimply amazing service. The most pain-free waxing I ever had, professional and friendly atmosphere. Adelina did an amazing job.\n\nMariyaTreatwell review\n\n“\n\nFran was incredible - couldn't rate her high enough! Made me feel so comfortable and did a fantastic job.
