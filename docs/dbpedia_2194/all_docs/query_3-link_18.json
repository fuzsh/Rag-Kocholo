        "text": "Do you get dry skin in the Winter? Have you ever wondered why?\n\nIn the colder months, more people suffer from dry skin in the UK. The air is drier in the winter, which predisposes to evaporation of moisture from the skin’s surface. The cold outdoor air and the dry indoor heating systems commonly used in the UK exacerbate this issue. These environmental conditions decrease the skin’s natural moisture content, leading to dryness, flakiness, and tightness.\n\nFrequent temperature fluctuations between cold outdoor environments and heated indoor spaces can disrupt the skin’s natural barrier function. This can compromise the skin’s ability to retain moisture, making it more susceptible to dryness and irritation. This lipid barrier helps seal in moisture to protect the skin from external stressors, but if weakened, it allows water to escape and irritants to penetrate more easily.\n\nHow can I prevent dry skin in the Winter?\n\nSkin needs extra hydration and support to maintain the skin barrier this time of year. If the barrier is broken down, it will need even more TLC to help repair the problem.\n\nHere at Cheshire Lasers, we have various SOS home treatments specially formulated to address these problems. With daily use, they can treat or prevent the problems you encounter this time of year. Find out more about our SOS products here.\n\nUsing a humidifier at home can help increase indoor humidity levels, counteracting the effects of dry heating systems.\n\nConsider changing your cleansers to something more gentle avoiding perfumes and stronger acids.\n\nWe also recommend our Winter pHformula Facials.\n\nWhat does the Winter SOS Hydrating Facial Involve?\n\nStep 1: Cleanse EXFO Cleanse\n\nStep 2: Skin is primed to improve the absorption of the active ingredients.\n\nStep 3: Optional: LED Light Therapy for 25 minutes for a Deluxe Treatment\n\nStep 4: Gentle skin resurfacing treatment depending on your skin type: SP Complex, Dermabrasion Cream, CR Complex 1-2 or INSTANT Mask\n\nStep 5: Mask to suit your skin type: SOS Sheet Mask, HYDRA Gel Mask, or Advanced Peel-Off Mask.\n\nStep 6: Vita C Boost Treatment\n\nStep 7: POST Recovery Cream\n\nStep 8: SPF\n\nView all our Facial Prices, including our Winter Facial prices, here.\n\nWinter Offer\n\nAfter your treatment, you will receive a mini Winter SOS homecare kit worth £22 comprising EXFO Cleanse 20ml, SOS Oil 2ml, Vita B 2ml sample, SOS Repair 2ml Sample and an SOS Sheet Mask worth £22.\n\nIntroducing Beautology by Jade\n\nJade Maines is a beauty therapist with a BTEC national diploma in beauty therapy sciences.

This isn’t just shaping and tidying – Ultra Brows is eyebrow artistry.\n\nThe Ultra Brows 7 steps include:\n\nAssess\n\nAssess your face shape, colouring and natural brows to determine the best result for you.\n\nSome clients can achieve the perfect Brow shape on the first visit, whilst others may need a few treatments and be advised to grow in more eyebrow hairs to get the best results. Ultra Brows can be thick or thin, dark or light, angular or soft – as we all different and we all have different ideas about how we want to look.\n\nThe aim is to give you the perfect bespoke shape and colour just for YOU.\n\nTinting\n\nWe tint all brow hairs, including some of the ‘fluffy’ ones around the brows, so that we have the maximum amount of hair to work with to get the best shape for you.\n\nA high-quality tint rich in pigment gives longer-lasting results than traditional tints. We mix the tint according to your present colouring and desired result.\n\nWaxing\n\nWe wax both above and below the brows to give a shape tailored to suit you best.\n\nThreading\n\nWe use threading to remove the spare hair we don’t want around the brow area. Threading is also great for blending away telltale wax lines and ensuring smooth makeup application.\n\nTweezing\n\nTweezing is used to perfect your shape.\n\nTrimming\n\nWe then trim any long hairs so that all brow hairs lie perfectly in their newly defined shape.\n\nDesign\n\nEyebrow makeup will be applied to create the perfect look you want to achieve.\n\nWe can also guide you how to create this look at home.\n\nWhat is the difference between Ultra Brows and HD Brows?\n\nHD Brows uses HD branded products that are slightly different from those we use for Ultrabrows. Therefore you would need a patch test before your treatment if you have had HD Brows treatment elsewhere. Otherwise, the results are similar, and you still achieve well-groomed high definition eyebrows.\n\nBefore and after treatment advice\n\nTo get the best results from your Brow treatment, it’s best to let your brows grow in for around four weeks before your first treatment.\n\nBefore your Brows treatment, you will need a patch test 24 to 48hrs before your treatment. It takes only a minute to do. Please call into Cheshire Lasers for a patch test. You will be asked to complete a consent form, and one of our team will perform the test for you.\n\nTo maintain your gorgeous new brows, you’ll need to repeat the Brows treatment every 3-6 weeks once your hairs have regrown and your colour has faded.\n\nIMPORTANT:\n\nPlease don’t exfoliate the skin or use products containing AHA’s or fruit acids around your eyebrows for at least a week before and after treatment so as not to thin the skin and make it more sensitive to the waxing.\n\nIf you have taken Roaccutane or any other skin-thinning medication in the past, you must wait at least six months before having waxing on the eyebrows.\n\nWho Performs Ultra Brows Treatments at Cheshire Lasers?\n\nBeautology by Jade performs all of the Ultrabrows treatments\n\nView jades Ultra Brows Treatment Prices here\n\nJade Maines of Beautology performs Dermaplaning treatments at Cheshire Lasers Clinic.\n\nWhat is Dermaplaning?\n\nDermaplaning is a manual exfoliation treatment that brightens and gives the skin an instant glow.\n\nA sterile scalpel is used to gently and safely remove dead skin cells from the top layer of your skin (epidermis).\n\nThis non-invasive treatment leaves the skin more receptive to serums and moisturisers, therefore increasing cell renewal and the production of collagen and elastin, for a more youthful and rejuvenated complexion.\n\nAn added bonus to this treatment is the removal of the vellus hair (peach fuzz) on the surface of the skin. This gives a silky look that allows make-up to be applied flawlessly. The treatment is pain-free and many clients have reported it is as a calm, relaxing experience.\n\nWhat are the Benefits of Dermaplaning:\n\nRemoval of dead skin cells\n\nIncreases cell turnover (increased collagen production)\n\nInstantly reveals brighter, glowing skin with minimal downtime\n\nBaby soft skin\n\nRemoves vellus hair (peach fuzz)\n\nAids product absorption by up to 70% allowing serums and moisturisers to reach the lower layers of the skin and be more effective\n\nMake-up glides on and sits on the skin smoothly\n\nUnclogs pores\n\nYou can benefit from a one-off treatment for a special occasion or have a course of treatments as part of your regular skincare regime. (every 3-4 weeks)\n\nWill Dermaplaning affect hair growth?\n\nDermaplaning does not alter the structure of the hair. Hair growth will return as it was before the treatment and WILL NOT grow back faster and thicker.\n\nContraindications to Dermaplaning:\n\nActive acne – pustules, broken or damaged skin\n\nOral retinoids – Roaccutane (cannot be taken for at least 6 months before treatment)\n\nTopical retinol is OK\n\nActive skin infections – psoriasis, dermatitis (if on the face)\n\nAuto-Immune diseases – lupus\n\nCautions for Dermaplaning:\n\nIf you have any of the following, please arrange an initial consultation/assessment before booking a treatment:\n\nDiabetes that is not controlled (well-controlled diabetics are fine to be treated)\n\nBlood thinning medicines\n\nSensitive skin\n\nPregnant or breastfeeding\n\nPlease note:\n\nWe do not recommend a Dermaplaning treatment less than 5 days before a sun holiday. As the skin is highly sensitive to sun rays following the treatment.\n\nPre-treatment advice:\n\ndo not use sunbeds on the day of the treatment and for up to 7 days after.\n\narrive to your appointment make-up free or with as little make-up as possible.\n\nThe face will be cleansed and prepped as part of the treatment; however, removing excess make-up and stubborn eye make-up will eat into the treatment time. This means less time for the Dermaplaning.\n\nDermaplaning Aftercare:\n\nYour skin will be slightly red after the treatment and for up to 1 hour after\n\nYou can apply make-up immediately after; however, we recommend you allow the serums to absorb into your skin first for best results, which can take several hours.\n\nPlease wear a high SPF for at least one week after treatment.\n\nVellus hair may feel blunt when growing back\n\nWho Performs Dermaplaning?\n\nJade Maines from Beautology performs Dermaplaning at Cheshire Lasers.\n\nExpress Dermaplaning facial: 30mins\n\nIncludes full-face Dermaplaning\n\nApplication of serums, moisturiser, SPF 50.\n\nLuxury Dermaplaning: 50 mins\n\nIncludes full face Dermaplaning, lymphatic drainage massage and treatment mask.\n\nApplication of serums, moisturiser, SPF 50.\n\nView Jade’s Dermaplaning prices at Cheshire lasers here.\n\nThe art of threading for hair removal – is now available again at Cheshire lasers.\n\nThis ancient art of eyebrow shaping and hair removal originates from Asia. It is now available to male and female clients at the Cheshire Laser Clinic.\n\nThreading has fast become the celebrities’ preferred method for shaping perfect eyebrows and removing hair.\n\nWe are lucky to have one of Cheshire’s Threading Experts now working here at Cheshire Lasers Clinic. She will analyse your eyebrows or facial hair and advise you on the perfect solution. She can also remove hair from the chin, lips and face.\n\nEach threading experience is personal, private and nothing short of perfection.\n\nThe end result for eyebrows is a precise, symmetrical and accurate arch which also defines your facial features amazingly. The results are a real confidence booster.\n\nFor hair removal, the treatment is kinder to the skin and is also less traumatic than waxing as no heat or chemicals are applied. No hair removal treatment can ever be pain-free. However, we use a wonderful desensitising Witch-hazel Solution that will make your threading experience as pleasurable as can be.\n\nRegrowth is finer, softer and smoother – retraining unruly eyebrows to grow in a more flattering direction.\n\nThe frequency of your threading experience will depend on personal hair re-growth. Most clients visit us at Cheshire Lasers every 3-4 weeks.\n\nTo book your threading experience – for eyebrows, upper lip, chin or the face – call the reception desk at Cheshire Lasers Clinic on 01606 841255.\n\nOr book online here:\n\nWho performs Threading at Cheshire Lasers?\n\nJade performs all the threading at Cheshire Lasers; she has her own business Beautology.

They have many years of experience and provide this treatment to a high standard.\n\nWhat does intimate hot waxing involve?\n\nThe hot wax is spread thickly onto the skin and allowed to dry slightly before it is gently peeled away. The hair comes away with the wax, leaving behind smooth skin. This is different to traditional waxing which involves warm wax and strips. Hot wax does not stick to the skin so is better for more sensitive areas.\n\nAlthough the treatment may be uncomfortable the hot wax method is far less painful than most and pulls hair directly from the roots. The benefits include fewer in-grown hairs, less breakage and therefore longer re-growth periods.\n\nThe most popular treatments are the Brazilian and the Hollywood. Our therapists have been performing these treatments for many years.\n\nWhats the difference between Hollywood Wax vs Brazilian Wax?\n\nThe Brazilian Hot Wax\n\nBrazilian bikini waxes were introduced to New York in 1987 by 7 Brazilian-born sisters. The Brazilian remains a popular hair removal method in the US.\n\nBrazilian waxes differ from regular bikini waxes because hair is removed in the front, back, and everything in between. A “landing strip” is typically left in the front.\n\nThe Hollywood Hot Wax\n\nThe Hollywood wax removes all the bikini hair, so you are entirely hair-free.\n\nThe Thong Bikini Hot Wax\n\nThe hair is taken from around the front and sides, but the middle (labia) and around the back are left alone.\n\nIf you wear a thong and want down there to be smooth and clean of hair without feeling too bare, this is a good option.\n\nThe shape of the hair at the front is totally up to you, but a landing strip is a classic option. Other popular shapes include a tiny triangle and a postage stamp but feel free to ask for whatever style you prefer.\n\nWho provides Brazilian and Hollywood Bikini Waxing at Cheshire Lasers?\n\nJade has her own Business, Beautology she specialises in Brazilian and Hollywood Bikini hot waxing and has been performing these treatments for years. She uses premium lycon wax which is fantastic for those intimate areas. She has received some fantastic reviews and comes highly recommended. Jade is available four days a week, including some late evenings, and she also works most Saturdays.\n\nNatasha trained in hot bikini waxing in intimate areas in 2011 and has been performing treatments since. For years it was one of her favourite treatments. Although Natasha is now a level 4 laser technician, and provides more laser treatments in this area than waxing.\n\nClick here for Jade’s Brazilian and Hollywood Waxing Prices.\n\nTo book a Beautology appointment with Jade:\n\nYou can book Brazilian and Hollywood Bikini Hot Waxing online with Jade here\n\nOr phone 01606 841255\n\nClick here for Cheshire Lasers Brazilian and Hollywood Waxing Prices with Natasha\n\nPre-Treatment Advice\n\nExfoliate the area lightly a few days before the treatment (2-3 times a week). This will help prepare the skin and reduce ingrowing hairs.\n\nTake a shower before your appointment, or if you are coming from work, shower in the morning. You may want to bring wipes to freshen up when you arrive.\n\nWhen should I shave? Ideally, your hair should be around a quarter-inch long. For most people, this is about four weeks of hair growth after your last shave, wax, or other hair removal method. We can wax the area if there is less than this, but regrowth may be faster.\n\nWe recommend you wear loose clothing to your appointment.\n\nIf you find the treatment uncomfortable, you may want to take pain relief such as paracetamol.\n\nWe don’t recommend this treatment when you are near to or on a period, as it can be more uncomfortable at this time.\n\nPost-Treatment Advice\n\nAvoid tight clothing after treatment.\n\nDon’t expose the area to sunlight or tanning beds for at least 48 hours.\n\nAvoid exercise, swimming, sauna and steam rooms for 48 hours. It’s fine to have a warm bath or shower but avoid exposing the area to hot or cold temperatures.\n\nUse gentle moisturising products on the area and nothing perfumed that will irritate the skin.\n\nGently exfoliate the area 48 hours after 2-3 times a week to prevent ingrowing hairs.\n\nBook your next wax in around 6 weeks’ time, depending on your regrowth.\n\nFor many women, pregnancy is an exciting and life-changing event. Unfortunately, for some, many of the common symptoms of pregnancy can taint this wonderful time of life.\n\nMums to be Massage treatments are suitable for pregnant women between 12 and 36 weeks gestation.\n\nThe treatments are 100% safe for you and your baby. However, if you have a high-risk pregnancy or have any other medical conditions, please ask us to check with our therapist before you book your appointment.\n\nMum to be Body Massage – 55 Minutes\n\nThis gentle, nurturing treatment is specially formulated for pregnancy. It helps deep relaxation, relieves tension, minimises swollen joints, and reduces stretch marks.\n\nMum-to-be Pregnancy Massage and Facial – 75 Minutes\n\nThis relaxing treatment includes a gentle comforting tummy massage that helps reduce the risk of stretch marks plus a body massage that includes a draining massage to reduce water retention thus lightening ‘heavy’ legs.
