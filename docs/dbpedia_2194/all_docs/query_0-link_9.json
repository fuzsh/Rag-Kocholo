        "text": "EPISODE GUIDE\n\n\"Amazon Hot Wax\" Season 3, Episode 16 Air date February 16, 1979 Written by Alan Brennert Director Ray Austin\n\n← previous\n\n\"The Starships are Coming\" next →\n\n\"The Richest Man in the World\"\n\nGoing undercover to stop extortionists in the record industry gives Diana a chance to show off her vocal abilities.\n\nPlot[]\n\nAn extortionist of interest to the IADC has branched out to the music industry, holding for ransom the master copy of the last album recorded by pop star Billy Dero, who was recently lost at sea. The release of the album could be make or break for Eric's troubled Phoenix Studios. Diana goes undercover as a singer.\n\nAdele sends her henchman, Marty, to put additional pressure on Eric to pay up. At a studio press party, Diana meets Barbi & Jeff (a conservative mainstream brother and sister duo who always wear matching outfits, reminiscent of Donny & Marie Osmond) as well as Antimatter (trio Anton, Jerry, and Kim, who arrive shooting fireworks, tossing confetti, and acting goofy. Similar to KISS, they wear clown white makeup at all times). She listens at the door as Marty burns the master tape of the first song off the album, threatening to burn one song a day until the ransom is paid. She ducks around the corner and begins to spin, but Eric sees her shadow and comes around before she can change. She admits that she overheard the whole thing.\n\nEric asks Kim to listen to some of Billy's recordings that didn't end up on the master tape and see if he can remix it. Slowing the recording down, Kim finds that what seemed to be background noise is actually Billy's voice. \"Someone take the pennies off Billy's eyes. Someone pry the coffin lid loose. Someone get me out; it's so cold and so damp. Can anybody hear me at all?\" Jerry, remembering the \"Paul is dead\" conspiracy theory about the Beatles, does not want to go down the rabbit hole again. Anton points out that the fate of the studio hangs in the balance, and that they owe Eric for giving them their break. The band agree to keep digging.\n\nEric gets the money and agrees to pay. Barbi shows up at Adele's office with proof (stolen from Eric's office) that he got the bank loan for the ransom money. She negotiates with Adele to get a greater cut of the money for having stolen the tape. Despite Jeff thoughtlessly undercutting her, she does get Adele to move a bit.\n\nAnton, studying Bobby's album cover (reminiscent of The Beatles' Sargent Pepper album), finds that Billy is pointing to Santa Claus while the album is named \"What's My Moniker, Veronica.\" He puts it together to get \"Santa Monica,\" where Billy has a long-abandoned remote cabin.\n\nDiana enters Eric's office to find him grimly closing the suitcase with the ransom money. He says he doesn't have a choice, and leaves. Diana says to herself that she didn't have a choice, either, and pulls a hidden tape recorder out from under the rim of his desk. She plays it back to hear the time and location of the ransom drop.\n\nThe Antimatter trio arrive at the boarded-up cabin and find Billy inside. He admits to have faked his death in order to sell more albums. He felt his career was slipping, and thought the drama and excitement of his death could give it new life. Asked about the clues in the album, he says \"I figured if it worked for The Beatles, heck, it could probably work for me.\" He asks for a couple more weeks in the cabin, time enough for the album to be released, but the trio agree in unison that's not happening.\n\nThey arrive outside the studio just as Diana's about to get into her car. She tells them Eric's about to pay a million dollar ransom for Billy's tapes, and they have to come with her to stop him. The Antimatter van arrives at the drop just in time to scare off Marty. Eric is thrilled to see Billy alive. Diana sneaks outside the van and urges them to get going.\n\nWonder Woman leaps ahead and knocks a telephone pole into the road, forcing Marty to stop. He gets out to make a run for it, and everyone gives chase. Kim catches up to him first, but Marty punches him and tosses him down a steep hill into the road below. Wonder Woman rescues him just before he's hit by a car.\n\nAdele laments that the tape she's holding is now worthless, but Barbi points out that if its value depends on being a memorial album, all they have to do is make sure it is. Jeff objects, but Adele is all for it. Barbi says they're in too deep to back out, so Jeff suggests they kidnap Billy instead. Adele agrees.\n\nDiana checks in with Steve, but has no new leads. They assume the extortionists are long gone by now, but she wants to stick around to make sure. Besides, Cathy (her undercover identity) is contractually obligated to record an album. She does, however, regret that when everything is over she'll have to come clean with Eric, who is developing feelings for her and will likely feel used and betrayed. Steve sympathizes, but they both know it's unfortunately part of the job.\n\nEric forgives Bobby for lying to him and nearly bankrupting the company, but says they have to come clean to the public or else face backlash and possible arrest for the scam. Billy doesn't like it, but Eric insists. And, this time, instead of producing it himself, Billy will have Antimatter do the mastering.\n\nBarbi and Jeff put on ear plugs and ski masks, enter the studio, and set the speakers to create painful feedback. While everyone covers their ears and crouches in pain, the siblings rush in and make off with Billy. Diana, working on her own album in the next room, hears what's going on and changes into Wonder Woman. Unable to disengage the feedback from the control panel, she breaks the speakers before jumping out a second-story window to try to rescue Bobby. Barbi and Jeff see her coming and drive off, leaving Marty behind. Caught in her lasso, he tells Wonder Woman everything. She heads after the kidnappers, telling Antimatter to take custody of Marty and send the police to Adele's house.\n\nAdele tells Barbi to stay put, assuring her that Wonder Woman is after Adele first and Barbi isn't in danger. In reality, she knows Wonder Woman will go to rescue Bobby first, so she plans to make her escape, leaving the Gordons to their fate. Antimatter arrive and break into Adele's house to find her shredding and burning her papers. They overpower her and her butler and call the police.\n\nWonder Woman overcomes the Gordons' bodyguards and rescues Billy. The Gordons make a break for it, but Antimatter shows up, having captured the siblings and covered them in silly string.\n\nIn the studio, Diana prepares to record. Eric asks her out. She says she has to leave after she finishes recording, and confesses that she was undercover. He's hurt and angry and leaves. Diana is saddened, but there's nothing she can say. She begins to sing, with Billy and Antimatter (for once not wearing their makeup) listening in approval. Eric, charmed, comes back to listen and smile.\n\nCast[]\n\nLynda Carter as Diana Prince / Wonder Woman\n\nLyle Waggoner as Colonel Steve Trevor, Jr.\n\nCurtis Credel as Eric Landau\n\nBob Hoy as Marty\n\nSarah Purcell as Barbi Gordon\n\nJudge Reinhold as Jeff Gordon\n\nMartin Speer as Billy Dero\n\nRick Springfield as Anton\n\nDanil Torppe as Jerry\n\nMichael Botts as Kim\n\nKate Woodville as Adele Kobler\n\nGene Krischer as Jim the Engineer\n\nNotes[]"
