        "text": "Despite significant advances benefitting the rich (such as a much brighter oil lamp with a circular wick developed by Ami Argand in 1780), real change in lighting our streets and homes only came when lighting technology began to develop on an industrial scale: first as gas lighting at the end of the 18th century and then as electric lighting from the mid-19th century onwards.\n\nMost people first encountered these technologies not at home but in the street, or at work in the growing number of factories lit by night.\n\nGas lighting at home was increasingly popular among the middle classes in the 19th century, although it was usually frowned upon in bedrooms due to the unfortunate downsides of choking fumes, smoke, blackened walls and the risk of the odd explosion.\n\nWhile gas provided relatively gentle illumination, the huge electric arc streetlamps which began appearing in the 1870s gave out an intense light.\n\nLight was produced by an electric current which arced between two carbon rods—hence the name. The development of electric generators made them a practicable solution for lighting public spaces.\n\nGas light still produced a familiar flame, but artificially generated electric light was something altogether new and exciting. It was produced almost as if by magic, the visible outlet of invisible electricity—albeit, in the case of arc lamps, with a rather strong smell and some noise.\n\nArc lights could illuminate huge areas: those installed on towers in 1860s New York lit up the street and several blocks around with a blinding light'. Some were even used to light fields, enabling agricultural labourers to work into the night—a far cry from a harvest governed by light-related circadian rhythms.\n\nArc lamps weren't always welcomed. Robert Louis Stevenson wasn't alone in railing against the 'ugly blinding glare' of the new technology. He saw the electric streetlight as 'a lamp for a nightmare' compared to the 'biddable domesticated stars' provided by gaslight.\n\nGiven the intensity of these lights, it's unsurprising that they get extremely hot—the arc reaches several thousand degrees Celsius, and so the lamps needed to be placed at height and well out of reach.\n\nNo wonder, then, that arc lamps were far too powerful for the home. A new way was needed to produce less powerful electric light for indoors.\n\nBy the 1930s new homes in urban areas of Britain were being lit by electricity. It took time for the National Grid to roll out electricity to most of the country, but the number of homes wired up increased from 6% in 1919 to two thirds by the end of the 1930s.\n\nHailed as clean, convenient, progressive and modern (especially compared to gas, electricity suppliers would be at pains to tell the public), electric lighting at home was seen as aspirational.\n\nMost lighting schemes were fairly minimal in scope, with perhaps one central light and a couple of wall lights or plug-in lamps. New task lighting for work and home, such as the classic Anglepoise lamp, played with modern, minimalist design.\n\nElectric lamp stands made from plastics such as urea formaldehyde flaunted their cutting-edge materials and celebrated the new paler interior colours made possible by cleaner electric lighting.\n\nDespite this, many homes had very little electric lighting, especially as it needed to be retrofitted to older buildings. There’s a lovely comic moment in the 2019 BBC production of Worzel Gummidge when two streetwise kids—sent to a farm in the countryside—try to light what they assume is an oil lamp in their bedroom with a match, only to see the farmer’s wife flick the electric light switch to turn it on.\n\nWhile we smile at their assumption, it's a reminder that electricity is a relatively recent addition to the average British home, especially in more remote rural areas.\n\nIt's also a reminder that—despite its enormous impact—we take it for granted, with the odd wide-scale blackout usually fading fast from memory."
