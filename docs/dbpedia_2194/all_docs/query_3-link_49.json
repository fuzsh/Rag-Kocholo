        "text": "The air is crisp, your skis are on and you’re breezing up the lift with your favorite ski bum. You can’t wait to tell them about how your latest hot wax changed your life. “And the best part is, I can do it myself now! It saves time and hassle and the results are so smooth!”\n\nSound appealing? Learning to wax skis can give you an edge on the slopes.\n\nWaxing your skis protects from kinetic, wet, dirt, and static friction. The wax stays in the small pores of your ski bases. This helps them work well in any condition.\n\nKeep reading to find out how to wax your skis.\n\nTypes of Wax\n\nIt’s time to channel Sheldon Cooper because things are going to get scientific. Ski and snowboard waxes are made of compounds and elements. Each works in a different way which is why racing wax is different from everyday wax.\n\nHydrocarbon\n\nAs the name implies, hydrocarbon wax is made from the hydrocarbons paraffin and microcrystalline. They’re also made from other synthetic wax materials.\n\nTogether, these materials create the perfect, everyday ski trifecta. Synthetic wax materials are the muscle of the operation, making wax stronger.\n\nParaffins are the soft and gentle element of your ski wax trio. They create that breezy glide you crave on fresh powder or just-groomed slopes. If you’ve ever had a paraffin treatment with your manicure, you know how amazing this stuff is.\n\nFinally, the muscle. Microcrystalline gives hydrocarbon wax what it needs to last you all night long.\n\nFluorocarbons\n\nFlorine repels water. Fluorocarbons have all their hydrogen atoms replaced with fluorine. Skis glide better in wet conditions when they’re not attracting extra moisture.\n\nMoly/Graphite\n\nMoly (short for molybdenum) is similar to graphite but better. The Moly element (which is also a great name for your next band), keeps your skis from getting too dirty in wet and sticky snow.\n\nMoly prevents electrostatic energy from slowing you down in dry snow conditions. Most people agree Moly is better than graphite and usually use it to get better speed on their skis.\n\nArm Yourself\n\nReady to swap out that scientist hat for a do-it-yourselfer hat? Before you do, you’ll need the right tools. Here are three essentials you need for waxing skis at home.\n\nAn Iron Will\n\nYou’ll also need an actual iron. If you’re keeping things thrifty you can use any old iron. Just make sure it’s designated for your skis.\n\nSharing ski irons with clothes irons may end with you needing a new wardrobe. Thus, defeating the purpose of saving some cash with the cheap iron.\n\nIf you’re willing to spring for it, you can find designated ski waxing irons. Swix makes a popular iron that retails for around $45-$50.\n\nA Scrapier Whit\n\nOr just a scraper. These are usually plastic or stainless steel. They’re easy to find at any ski shop and cost $10-$15 on average.\n\nA Brush of Class\n\nAnd a ski brush. Serious shredders have a collection of brushes with bristles made from horsehair or even metal. If you’re an everyday ski bum who enjoys the simpler tools, you can get a nylon-bristled brush.\n\nNylon ski brushes retail for about $20.\n\nA Band Made of Rubber\n\nYou’ll need a few rubber bands to hold your skis in the right position. Make sure they’re strong enough to hold your skis locked. It might be a good idea to keep a few extra nearby just in case.\n\nA Few Clamps\n\nYou need a straight, elevated surface to hold your skis in place while you work on them. Vice clamps like pros use cost around $150. If you decide to make something similar with the tools you have, just be sure it’s a flat, elevated surface that won’t scratch your skis.\n\nSince you can work on one ski at a time, you probably only need three vices.\n\nA Block Wax\n\nMost DIYers will use a block of ski wax. You can also buy liquid wax that uses a rag for application. Ski wax is pretty easy to find online or at a ski shop.\n\nYou can spend as little as $10 or as much as $110 on a block of ski wax. Just make sure you’re buying from a legitimate retailer.\n\nA Stone or Pad\n\nA hard gummi stone or scotch pad will get all the sharp/scratchy things off your skis before you start work on them. A hard gummi stone will set you back around $10.00.\n\nA Prep\n\nSome base prep will help get the old greasy grime off your skis before you wax them. Some recommend using any mild citrus-based cleaner. Be careful, too much or the wrong kind of base prep can permanently damage your skis!\n\nLocation, Location, Location\n\nPrepping your wax area is an important step in the wax-at-home process. Follow these space prep tips before you dive it.\n\nAlways wax in a comfortable temperature. Waxing in a cold garage or outside will result in poorly waxed skis.\n\nMake sure you have plenty of space for skis and tools.\n\nGet a drop cloth because you’re about to make a big mess.\n\nGet all your tools ready before you start so you don’t have to run around finding things mid-process.\n\nYou need a good sturdy table or surface for your work. If you don’t want to drop $150 to buy one, you can build a ski waxing bench for less than $15.\n\nThe DIY\n\nOnce you have everything set up, it’s time to wax skis (one at a time, of course).\n\n1. Brake\n\nLoop a rubber band around one brake, the binding, and the other brake. This will lock them in place and out of your way.\n\n2. Smooth\n\nTake your gummi stone or Scotch Brite pad and run it along the bottom of your skis. Without damaging the surface, make sure there’s nothing sharp sticking out. Anything sharp could cut your finger or damage your tools.\n\nTry to avoid using your finger to test for smoothness. This could result in extra steps requiring medical attention to said finger.\n\n3. Inspect\n\nYour edges and bases should all be in pretty good shape. Lay a ruler over them to see if there are any big differences in height. If you see bigger issues with the edges and bases of your skis, it’s best to let a pro shop handle those before you go to work on them.\n\n4. Base Prep\n\nNow you need to prep the ski bases. Apply a small amount of base prep to a clean cloth or rag. Wipe the cleaner up and down, covering the entire ski base.\n\nDon’t overdo it, though. Too much can cause irreversible damage.\n\n5. Wax On\n\nNow it’s time for the main event. Heat your iron to the temp stated on the wax. Once your iron is ready, take the wax block and hold it up to the hot iron over your ski base. You should have a small drip stream drizzling onto the ski.\n\nContinue drizzling up and down the ski (most people work from tip to tail). Now go back and iron the wax on, covering the entire base surface. Make sure your iron is always moving. Stopping or pausing can cause burns to your skis!\n\n6. Let It Dry\n\nThe wax should dry for at least 30 minutes. If you don’t have 30 minutes to wait, don’t start the process. Trying to dry your skis by setting them outside or other short-cut methods can cause damage.\n\n7. Scrape It\n\nNow you get to use that handy dandy scraper tool. Make sure it’s sharp first. As smoothly as possible, scrape the dry wax off your ski base. Get it all off but don’t be too aggressive about it.\n\n8. Brush, Brush, Brush\n\nFirst, bust out your brush and go to town. Start at the tip and end at the tail. Remember your muscles because this process can take up to 20 minutes.\n\nBrush until there’s no more wax flying off the ski. Next, grab your Scotch Brite pad (or a finer ski brush) and repeat the process.\n\n9. Admire\n\nWhen it’s all said and done, you should be able to see your reflection on the newly waxed base. After all that scraping and brushing, you might want to freshen up a bit before you hit the slopes.\n\nWax Skis, Save Time\n\nIf you enjoy the great outdoors in winter, you don’t want to spend your precious vacation time in a ski shop. Learning how to wax skis at home can save you precious so you can get straight to the slopes.\n\nNow that your skis are ready to go, you should be, too! Whistler Retreats has everything you need to enjoy your next ski-cation. We have one, two, and three-bedroom condos.\n\nSee what’s available in Creekside, Upper Village, or Village North today!\n\nIf you like to ski, you know the importance of ski boots. As the link between your body and mountain, having the right kind of boots that correspond to the size as well as the shape of your feet are a prerequisite. They don’t just protect your feet and keep them comfortable throughout your day but they play a part in controlling your ski.\n\nIf you are planning on buying new ski boots this winter, here are some key considerations that you must not ignore:\n\nRigidity Or Flex\n\nThe most important factor to consider while buying ski boots is the rigidity of the boot, which is known as the flex. It is determined by the flex index, which is measured on a scale of 60 to 150. While a lower flex index is apt for beginners, more experienced skiers should opt for more rigid boots with a higher flex index.\n\nThe rigidity of your ski boots should correspond to your expertise and experience level, as well as your body shape.\n\nIf you are a beginner, select boots with a flex index between 60 and 90 (for men) and 60 and 70 (for women). If you are on an intermediate level, opt for boots with a flex index between 90 and 110 (for men) and 70 and 90 (for women). If you are on the advanced level, select boots with a flex index of more than 110 (for men) and over 90 (for women).\n\nThe high-level competitors require the stiffest ski boots with a flex level between 140 and 150 as they facilitate the better transmission of power from your legs to the skis.\n\nYour Style\n\nGo boots shopping, and you will realize that the shops are full of different kinds of boots. Given the popularity of skiing, the boots manufacturers offer an assorted range of boots to suit the tailored needs of the skiers and requirements of different terrains (as well as aesthetics).\n\nHere’s how you should select the ski boots according to your skiing style:\n\nIf you always ski on groomed slopes or ski occasionally for leisure, look for comfortable and lightweight boots that are easy on your feet. Don’t buy boots with a flex index of more than 90.\n\nIf you ski on groomed slopes at a high level, look for boots with a flex index between 90 and 130 (for men) and 70 and 110 (for women). By the virtue of their high cuff and narrow fit, they offer better control, which is what you need for performance skiing or racing.\n\nIf you are into ski touring, look for touring boots that are light in weight. These boots are very flexible and allow you to walk comfortably.\n\nFor freeriding, look for free ride boots with around 100 mm width and a straight cuff. The flex index should be between 100 and 120. You will further find different options, such as boots with walk-mode or rubber soles.\n\nFor freetouring, buy lightweight boots that work well for climbing, as well as descending. Buy boots with inserts for hybrid bindings or touring pin bindings.\n\nIf freestyling is your style, flexible boots with plush cushioning on the heel area are apt for you. Make sure that the width of the boot at the ball of your feet is 100 mm to ensure comfort while skiing.\n\nYour Size\n\nSelecting a boot that fits your size is essential to have a comfortable skiing experience. The boots should fit your foot exactly. Buy a boot that allows your toes to move freely and doesn’t compress your foot.\n\nThe length of the ski boot is determined by the Mondo Point or MSS- Metric Sizing System, whereby the size of the boot corresponds to the longest part of your foot, which is measured in centimeters.\n\nComing to the width of the ski boot, it is measured across the ball of the foot. Select the width as per the precision you desire. If you are looking for ski boots for competition or need precision, go for narrow boots. Otherwise, buy boots with an average width.\n\nHaving a ski boot with the right length and width ensures comfort and control over the ski. So, do not compromise on the fit. If your measurement is between two sizes, get half a size smaller.\n\nSki Boot Liners\n\nWhen it comes to ski boot liners, you will never fall short of options. The majority of boots feature heat-moldable material. The non-moldable liners also offer stability and a good amount of padding. Custom moldable liners adapt to a customized fit with the help of an artificial heat source, whereas thermoformable foam liners get custom fit with the help of the heat of your foot.\n\nOther Considerations\n\nApart from these basic considerations, several other factors need to be taken while buying ski boots.\n\nIf you hike up in the search of untracked powder, invest in boots that allow you to remove the upper shell from the lower boot to facilitate walking in the snow. You can lock the shells while skiing.\n\nIf you ski on different terrains, look for boots that allow you to adjust their stiffness as per the kind of skiing.\n\nDo not base your decision on the number of buckles, instead prioritize the fit. Of course, a four-buckle design will allow you to loosen or tighten your boot, but if a three buckle design offers a snug fit, go for it.\n\nIf you wish to get a very precise fit, get boots with micro-adjustable buckles that allow you to lengthen or shorten the buckle and adjust the tension between the two settings.\n\nLastly, to eliminate the chances of calf, shin, or toe-bang, buy boots with added padded features, such as padded tongues, padded heels, padded toes, and padded spoilers.\n\nTakeaways\n\nYour ski boots can make or break your skiing experience, and hence, make sure you choose the boot wisely. Whether you are a snow bunny or a professional skier, these tips are surely going to help you find the best ski boots. Happy buying.\n\nNote: It is important to stay up-to-date with the guidelines put out my the province of British Columbia before making any travel plans.\n\nYou will find the current recommendations here.\n\nWelcome The Ski Season In Style! Here’s How You Can Plan Your Fun With Safety For Your Next Skiing Adventure\n\nFall is bidding farewell and the winter is knocking on our doors. It is the time of the year to ditch the confines of your home, put your ski gear into the trunk of your car, travel to the charming ski resorts of Whistler, and let yourself loose in the gorgeous snow-laden mountains. If the concern for your safety amid the ongoing pandemic situation is hovering over your ski adventure plans, Whistler Blackcomb has made all the provisions for a safe ski season.\n\nWhistler Blackcomb is putting several safety measures in place so that you can have an adventurous winter with your loved ones. Here’s what we’re doing here.\n\nRegistration system to control the capacity limit\n\nNovember 26 is going to be a gala day for all you ski lovers as Whistler Blackcomb will set its most anticipated and most loved winter operations in motion. Once again, you will be able to enjoy the high-octane activities, like skiing and boarding in the snow-capped mountains.\n\nThe joy, the fun, the adventure, and the frolic will be the same, except that you will be bound to follow certain rules and regulations to safeguard your safety during this pandemic.\n\nTo manage the capacity limits on the mountains, Whistler Blackcomb has brought in a reservation system, whereby you will have to buy the tickets in advance to reserve your place in the lap of the majestic mountains. You can buy the tickets online.\n\nThe pass holder reservation system has been designed owing to the norms of social distancing. With fewer people on both the mountains, you will be able to maintain a safe distance from them and enjoy your adventure without having to worry about contracting an infection. The maximum capacity will be governed by factors such as the size of the resorts, weather conditions, operating plans, historic visitation numbers, and local regulations.\n\nReservations for every day will be needed at every resort. Once you get the pass, you will get the priority access to book your preferred days (up to 7 days). While using your Priority Reservation Days, you can book additional reservations (depending upon the days of access left on your pass). Furthermore, you can make week-off reservations within a week of your ski or ride day. However, it is subject to availability as well as your pass access on that particular day.\n\nAs far as the lift ticket is concerned, once you buy the lift ticket, your reservation for the specific day will be confirmed automatically.\n\nThe online reservations for the Core Season (From Dec 8, 2020 to April 4, 2021) will begin from November 2020 for 2020/21 pass holders. The lift tickets will go on sale on Dec 8, 2020. You will be able to make reservations at epicpass.com or call.\n\nIf you are a pass holder, you can make multiple reservations in Early Season (subject to availability) depending on capacity and pass access. In the Early Season, you will have the privilege of being the only guests on the mountain, while also getting the opportunity of exclusive access to confirm reservations for the Core Season (Nov 6, 2020 to Dec 7, 2020).\n\nWhistler Safety Guidelines\n\nWhistler Blackcomb has created several guidelines to ensure your safety and keep your fun unbesmirched from the current pandemic.\n\nTo ensure that you ski and ride across the mountains peacefully, Whistler Blackcomb has mandated wearing face coverings in the mountain, resort, lift lines, lift, and gondolas. Further, only the guests skiing or riding together will be allowed to sit together on chair lifts and gondolas.\n\nA four-person lift will carry two singles seated on opposite sides and a six-person lift will carry two doubles seated on the opposite sides. Only two people will be allowed in gondola cabins.\n\nNorms on similar lines will be followed to ensure proper physical distancing in ski and ride schools and on-mountain dining and recreational outlets.\n\nBy following these guidelines, you will ensure yours and your loved ones’ safety without compromising on fun.\n\nWelcome To Whistler\n\nWe’ve prepared, and now we look forward to welcoming you to Whistler.\n\nBook your room, and reserve your days on the mountain early to guarantee the spot you want, and the vacation you deserve."
