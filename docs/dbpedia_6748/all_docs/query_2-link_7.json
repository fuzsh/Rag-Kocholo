Aristotle was one of the earliest scientists to formally classify plants and living things. He classified plants based on observable morphological characteristics, dividing them into trees, shrubs and herbs. His pupil Theophrastus wrote the earliest classical book on botany, taking an Aristotelian structure but focusing on how plants functioned rather than formal causes. Aristotle himself said that plants grow in all directions equally. Plato was Aristotle's teacher and founded the earliest institution of higher education, while Theophrastus succeeded Aristotle as the head of the Peripatetic school.",
