        "text": "In 1956, the Austrian-born photographer Inge Morath traveled to Iran on assignment for Holiday magazine. She wanted to photograph the entire Silk Road, from southern Europe to the South China Sea, and thought of Iran as “a good start.” The resulting images — which reveal the Shah celebrating the Iranian New Year, herders resting in the mountains near Shiraz, and the ruins of Persepolis — are captured in “Inge Morath: Iran” (Steidl, $60).\n\nMorath’s visit to Iran came just years after the 1953 coup and decades before the 1979 Iranian Revolution (which her Magnum colleague Gilles Peress documented in a photo report for The New York Times). The timing of her travels offers the reader an at-rest glimpse of the country’s 20th century history, a mixture of modern industry and traditional life.\n\nOne of the few female members of the Magnum Photos agency, Morath began her professional career as a translator and journalist, before picking up a camera in 1951. She traveled extensively throughout Europe, North Africa and the United States before marrying and settling down on the East Coast with playwright Arthur Miller, with whom she published several travel works.\n\nThough instructed by Holiday to focus on just two themes while in Iran — the mosques of Isfahan and, more predictably, Persian rugs — Morath extended her range to capture more animated shots including close-ups of young children at work and of an elderly man cutting firewood in the village of Vanak. As “Reading Lolita in Tehran” author Azar Nafisi says in an essay about Morath’s work, “In some of Morath’s photographs I felt that there was an affinity between that feeling of being overwhelmed by a past that is so huge and a present that is evasive and inaccessible.”\n\nIn addition to more than 300 images, the book also includes documents and texts detailing her travels. Of note are Morath’s photo captions, which lend a colorful written context to the visual images. In one such caption, Morath writes, “Hitch-hiker waiting for sympathetic motorist to arrive. The sole traveler is very deceptive, often several people hitch-hike together and have one person sit by the side of the road as a decoy.”"
