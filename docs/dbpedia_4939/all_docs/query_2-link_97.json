        "meta_description": "Since its founding in 1990, the Danziger Gallery has established itself as one of the leading photography venues in the world, known for the originality and diversity of its programming, its representation of established photographers, and the influence of its new discoveries.\r\n\r\nThe gallery was the first to show Susan Derges’ \"camera-less\" photographs; Robert Franks from the Penn Collection; and the experimental work of artists such as Liz Nielsen and Yuji Obata.\r\n\r\nMoving this year to a bi-level space on New York’s Lower East Side has afforded the gallery a certain nimbleness in terms of its programming allowing it to mount major shows while also responding quickly to new artists and the technological evolution of the medium. Its programming pulls from the worlds of art, new media, and print to create an up to date vision of photography's place in the world.\r\n\r\nThe gallery maintains an ongoing close creative relationship with its own roster as well as a strong collaborative relationship with other galleries and artists. Outside collaborations include two exhibitions with Jack Pierson (in association with Cheim and Read), several projects (both past and ongoing) with Chuck Close, and three exhibitions of Andy Warhol photographs in conjunction with the Andy Warhol Foundation. \r\n\r\nThis past year has seen gallery artists on view in museums in Tokyo, London, Lausanne, Paris, and throughout the U.S..  Paul Fusco's Robert F Kennedy Funeral Train – Rediscovered - a project originated by the gallery in 2008 - was featured at the recent Gwanjgu Biennale in Korea and is now in the collections of The Addison Museum, The Norton Museum of Art, The High Museum of Art, and the Tokyo Metropolitan Museum of Photography.  Susan Derges was featured in this year’s Houston Fotofest; and Mark Cohen was exhibited at and The Victoria and Albert Museum.  Most recently, Hans Breder’s work was acquired by The Getty, The Whitney, The Museum of Fine Arts Houston, and The Milwaukee Art Museum.",

        "text": "Inge Morath – Masquerades & Enoc Perez – Cut Shapes May 7 – June 13, 2015\n\nDanziger Gallery is pleased to present a two-person show of photographs by Inge Morath and photo collages by Enoc Perez. Created half a century apart, both works share a sense of humor, an interest in concealment, and a delight in cutting and making shapes out of paper.\n\nInge Morath (1923 – 2002) and artist Saul Steinberg (1914 – 1999) engaged in a unique collaboration by having friends and acquaintances don his paper bags drawn with fantastic faces and then posing them for her photographs. In a delightful series of individual and group portraits taken from 1959 to 1963 the images convey both humor and an unnerving psychological depth. We may not know who is beneath each bag, but we seem to know the type they are playing. Between Morath's deadpan style and Steinberg's flights of fantasy they created a veritable encyclopedia of attitudes, postures, and mannerisms.\n\nInge Morath joined the photographic cooperative Magnum in Paris by invitation of Robert Capa in 1953 and was assistant to Henri Cartier-Bresson before becoming a full member. Her work was widely published in magazines, including Life, Paris Match, and Vogue, and in numerous books.\n\nMs. Morath was married to Arthur Miller and they had one daughter, the film director Rebecca Miller. In 2015 the Bienecke Library at Yale acquired the bulk of the Inge Morath Estate.\n\nEnoc Perez was born in San Juan, Puerto Rico in 1967. He currently lives and works in New York. Known primarily for his multi-layered paintings of modernist buildings, throughout his twenty year career the artist has nevertheless engaged with a variety of subjects that appeal to him from voluptuous nudes to still lives of Don Q rum bottles.\n\nEnoc Perez’s new photo collages engage with social media, appropriation, and the artist’s consistent and inventive search for new forms. Sourcing images from the internet of minimally dressed or nude women, from amateur selfies to more professional photos, Perez adds hand painted and cut collaged forms to both obscure and enhance the picture.\n\nThe cutout shapes function as censor's marks - thwarting our ability to see the original image in its entirety while making it all the more attention-grabbing and voyeuristic. At the same time the collaged bits make it into a happy game, playful colors and forms replacing a need for more visual information and reminding the audience of the artist’s role in directing and delivering fresh ways of seeing.\n\nEnoc Perez’s work belongs to the collections of the Whitney Museum of American Art, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, the Corcoran Art Gallery, and the Museum of Contemporary Art North Miami, among other significant institutions throughout the United States. The first complete monograph on his work was published by Assouline in 2013."
