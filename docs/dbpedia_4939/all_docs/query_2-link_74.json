Especially since we have a medium that is \"always\" at hand in the form of cell phones? But what is the difference between professional photographers, (sometimes very good) amateur photography and \"just taking pictures\"? Is it the equipment? Is it the heart and soul that you put into it? Is it the frequency of execution? Or is it the knowledge of mastering the technique? Personally, I would draw the line at a certain level of continuity combined with quality and reliable repeatability of the results of photo projects. Where would you draw the line - or do you even think there is no need for a line? 📸 #Photography #Art #Creativity #ProfessionalPhotography #PhotographySkills #PhotoArt #VisualStorytelling #capturetheessence\n\nWANT MORE CUSTOMERS, DO IT Don't be like Malvin.

When writers or poets want to evoke an emotional reaction from their readers, they combine images and objects to establish relationships that evoke that emotion. They draw upon the language of vision. Documentary filmmaker and photographer Maria Finitzo is first and foremost a storyteller, and in her new online workshop, we study the work of photographers who understand how to construct images that operate on multiple levels—learning, in the process, methods for accomplishing the same in our own work.

I read a fascinating article from Aeon challenging the long-held belief that photographs can capture the essence of a person. This notion is more complex than we thought. Victorian photographer Julia Margaret Cameron once aimed to encapsulate her subjects' inner and outer worlds. Yet, as the article explains, photography's true nature captures fleeting moments, not the depth of a person's character. This raises some intriguing questions as a photographer who loves portraits and streets in equal measure. How do we perceive and interpret images of people? Does a snapshot tell the whole story or just a fraction of a moment? We often rely on profile pictures and headshots to tell us what we need to know, but it's crucial to remember they're just a glimpse of who someone is. First impressions count, but we also need to think beyond the frame. #PhotographyLimits #PerceptionVsReality #LinkedInCommunity"
