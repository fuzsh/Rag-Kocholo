        "text": "Photography Expanded provides fellowships and mentorship for photographers who seek to expand the parameters of documentary photography and develop experimental strategies for engaging audiences. Through experimenting with new approaches to image making and distribution, fellows explore creative models for narrative change in the context of various global practices of photography.\n\nThe program operates on a two year cycle with a specific thematic focus. The program partners with alumni from past Magnum Foundation programs to locally produce workshops in rotating locations that are relevant to that cycle’s theme. Up to twelve selected participants receive a grant of $10,000, take part in two workshops, and connect with collaborative partners and networks. Recent Photography Expanded themes have included Counter Histories and Heat.\n\nThe Arab Documentary Photography Program (ADPP) provides support and mentorship to photographers from across the Middle East and North Africa to amplify creative approaches to visual storytelling that challenge conventional narratives about the region. ADPP is a joint initiative of the Arab Fund for Arts and Culture, the Magnum Foundation, and the Prince Claus Fund, and has supported over 85 photographers since its founding in 2014.\n\nSelected photographers receive a $7,000 grant to work on their projects in their country of residence over a period of 10 months, are paired with mentors, and attend in-person workshops in Beirut.\n\nStarting in 2023, in addition to the annual ADPP grant cycle, the new ADPP Alumni Fellowship offers further second stage support to alumni of the program as part of our commitment to supporting their careers and facilitating further regional and international exchanges between established and emergent photographers.\n\nThe Magnum Foundation Fellowship (NYC Work-Study Fellowship) offers a project production grant, mentorship, and arts administration experience to early-career photographers. This fellowship is designed for New York City-based photographers to work in the Magnum Foundation office while also developing their own photographic project in the city that addresses social issues and engages with New York City communities.\n\nFellows are typically recent graduates of photography or journalism programs but may also be self-taught photographers of any age who are ready for an opportunity to deepen, expand, and complete a project. Fellows are encouraged to build relationships with their subjects in the field, build partnerships with relevant organizations, and experiment with narrative forms and storytelling techniques.\n\nIn addition to producing a project, fellows gain paid arts administration experience by spending 16 hours a week working in the Magnum Foundation office. The fellows work on a range of projects in the New York office including research on social issues, exploration of emerging technologies and platforms, multimedia production, and event production.\n\nThe Inge Morath Award is given annually by the members of Magnum Photos to a woman or nonbinary photographer under 30 years of age to support the completion of a long-term documentary photography project.\n\nThe Inge Morath Award was established by the members of Magnum Photos as a tribute to their colleague, who was associated with Magnum for more than fifty years and is remembered for her steadfast encouragement of women in the field. The awardee and finalists are selected each year by the full membership of Magnum Photos during the Annual General Meeting. The award is administered by the Magnum Foundation in partnership with the Inge Morath Estate.\n\nOur Experimental Labs bring together photographers, writers, technologists, students, and other creative thinkers to experiment with new approaches to visual storytelling. Convening in hands-on workshops, imagemakers learn from one another across disciplines and explore new digital storytelling tools for increasing the impact of their work.\n\nOn such themes as data security, performance, digital interventions, and augmented reality, participating photographers are able to work closely with coders, designers, and engagement strategists to most creatively and effectively push their projects beyond the still image. Oftentimes, these events are a catalyst for new projects and partnerships."
