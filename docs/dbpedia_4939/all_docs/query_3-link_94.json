        "text": "Last April during my trip to Venice, I stumbled upon a magnificent photography exhibition with the works of one of my favorite photographers — Inge Morath.\n\nThe exhibition, displaying an extensive Italian retrospective, took place at Palazzo Grimani, commemorating the 100th anniversary of Inge’s birth.\n\nThe said exhibition was also held with the scope of highlighting the bond that Inge had with the same city where she started her “first assignment” as it was there that she was asked to put a roll of film in her camera and take photos of Venice.\n\nAbout Inge Morath\n\nDuring her career, Inge covered different places around the world through her reportages. What I found interesting, is that she studied the language and culture of every place she ever visited, something which translates clearly in her work. It is like she knew the people she was photographing on a deep level.\n\nInge was particularly interested in humanity, across all walks of life. Her work shows a deep passion as when she first experienced when Robert Capa suggested that she photographs Venice. This same passion shows across all of her work."
