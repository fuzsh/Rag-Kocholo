        "text": "Looking Back at 2021\n\nAround the world, Magnum Foundation’s photographers are bearing witness to critical local stories, challenging dominant narratives, and developing innovative models of socially engaged storytelling. This year, Magnum Foundation supported over 65 photographers through grants, mentorship, and continued opportunities for our international network to collaborate and connect. Below are some highlights of the incredible breadth of activity and achievements of our creative community. Thank you to all of our partners, supporters, friends, grantees, and fellows for keeping us engaged, informed, and connected.\n\nWe published critical reporting by storytellers around the world\n\nBuilding on our editorial coverage of the unprecedented events that defined 2020, in 2021 we continued to partner with media outlets to connect and amplify the local storytelling of our global network, ensuring that the critical stories of this time were covered through diverse and nuanced perspectives.\n\nWith the support of the Henry Luce Foundation, we published seven stories on the global impacts of Covid-19 in The Guardian, Time, and The British Journal of Photography. Three stories from US Dispatches—our initiative documenting the current social and economic landscape of the United States—were published in 2021 in The New York Times, Rolling Stone, and the Virginia Quarterly Review.\n\nWe celebrated 20 years of the Inge Morath Award\n\nIn August, we celebrated the 20th anniversary of the Inge Morath Award, given each year to a woman or nonbinary photographer under the age of 30. We spent a week highlighting the work of past award recipients on our Instagram, and writer Sumeja Tulic reflected on Morath’s perseverance and enduring influence in a male-dominated industry in the British Journal of Photography. For more on Morath’s life and legacy, see Inge Morath: An Illustrated Biography by award-winning historian Linda Gordon, published in 2018 by Prestel and Magnum Foundation.\n\nAlongside Magnum Photos and the Inge Morath Estate, we announced Fabiola Ferrero as the recipient of this year’s Inge Morath Award, and Taniya Sarkar as the finalist.\n\nWe supported ten photographers from the Arab region to complete long-term projects, and eleven more embarked on new projects to be completed in 2022\n\nTen imagemakers in the Arab Documentary Photography Program, a joint mentorship initiative with the Arab Fund for Arts and Culture and the Prince Claus Fund, completed stereotype-defying projects from across the Arab region. Their stories join a collection of nearly 60 projects from the last six years of the program on a newly launched English-Arabic web gallery.\n\nIn October, the eleven photographers in the 2021-2022 cohort began their fellowships, and were able to safely convene with their mentors in Jordan for our first in-person ADPP workshop since the onset of the pandemic.\n\nWe trained 11 Photography and Social Justice Fellows from around the world\n\nThe demolition of a fishing community in Egypt; the impact of economic decline and unemployment on a photographer’s family in India; a family affected by incarceration in Ecuador; racial injustice faced by ethnic minorities in Indonesia—these are some of the stories explored by this year’s fellows. The nine-month fellowship gave them the opportunity to develop new approaches to socially engaged documentary practice, with guidance from mentors Newsha Tavakolian, Sim Chi Yin, and Sohrab Hura, teachers Fred Ritchin and Mengwen Cao, and the Magnum Foundation team.\n\nWe exhibited Esther Ruth Mbabazi’s collaborative portraits at Photoville\n\nThis fall at Photoville, a public art exhibition in Brooklyn Bridge Park, we shared Esther Ruth Mbabazi’s stunning portraits of women with disabilities. Produced in partnership with the American Jewish World Service, Esther collaborated with the women of Gulu Women with Disabilities Union in Northern Uganda to create portraits that celebrate individuality and personal expression, and counter typical portrayals of people living with disabilities. Read more about the project in Vogue.\n\nWe came together in support and celebration of our community\n\nAmid the ongoing challenges of Covid-19, Magnum Foundation continued to be a resource and virtual gathering space for our global community of storytellers.\n\nSince the early days of the pandemic, we have organized regular online meetups for our global network of past and present grantees and fellows. These community calls have been a valuable resource for continued learning, sharing of new work, and mutual support, and offer a direct line to our photographers to assess their needs in real-time so that we can better support them. We also embarked on inaugural partnerships with Acumen, the American Jewish World Service, and the Agroecology Fund to directly support 14 grantees with assignment opportunities to document and amplify the work of community leaders around the world. We celebrated the many accomplishments of our past grantees and fellows, whom we saw exhibit and publish projects they developed in our programs, gain support and recognition from various awards and grants, and continue their work as vital storytellers and leaders in their communities.\n\nWe were also honored to welcome Magnum Foundation Fellow Tif Ng to work with our team and pursue her project exploring loss, rituals, and myth-making; as well interns Aidin Turganbekov and Irina Mengqi Wang who brought great insight and dedication to all aspects of our work.\n\nWe are grateful for your partnership as we envision a better future\n\nAs we look back on our accomplishments in a year of continued global challenges, we are grateful for the partnership, support, and dedication of our community.\n\nLooking forward to the year ahead, we are excited to launch Counter Histories, an initiative focused on creatively reframing the past to engage with urgent questions of the present and future. Alongside an open call for photographers to receive $10,000 production grants and participate in project development workshops, we will convene a cohort of past fellows to work on this topic, offer additional project completion grants, and engage in several reporting partnerships—all through the lens of reframing histories and exploring the radical possibilities of alternative narratives."
