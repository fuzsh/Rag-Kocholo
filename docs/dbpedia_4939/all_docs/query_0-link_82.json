        "text": "Through contact with the photographer Ernst Haas, the trained translator Morath began working as a content writer for the \"Magnum\" photography agency in the early 1950s. She started taking photographs herself in 1951 and became a full member of the group in 1951. She took many photographs whilst travelling in Europe, China, North Africa and the Near East, but she also made portraits, snapshots and celebrity pictures – for example of Marilyn Monroe. She married the author Arthur Miller in 1962."
