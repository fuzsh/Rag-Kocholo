        "text": "Born on 27 May 1923 in Graz, Austria. After studying Romance languages in Berlin and Bucharest, she worked as a journalist for print media and radio stations. Her first forays into the field of photography were as a picture editor for Simon Guttmann in London. Her friendship with Ernst Haas led to an encounter with Robert Capa.
