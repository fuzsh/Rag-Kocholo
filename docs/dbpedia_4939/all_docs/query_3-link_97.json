        "text": "Austrian photographer Inge Morath studied languages in Berlin and worked as a translator and journalist. Morath began photographing in London in 1951. She joined Magnum Photos, first as an editor and researcher, and then as an associate in 1953. She worked as an assistant to Henri Cartier-Bresson. Morathâ€™s photographic work has been exhibited extensively and widely published. The annual Inge Morath Award was established in 2002 in honour of her lifetime contribution to the field."
