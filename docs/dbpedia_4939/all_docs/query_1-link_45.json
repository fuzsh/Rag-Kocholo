        "text": "Photographic material in the collection includes contact sheets, color slides, and photographic prints.\n\nMorath's documentary photographs depict people and events in a wide range of countries, including Austria, China, England, France, Germany, India, Italy, Romania, Russia, Spain, and Tunisia, as well as throughout Mexico and the United States.\n\nThe collection includes portrait studies of public figures, including Yul Brynner, Alexander Calder, Alberto Giacometti, Dustin Hoffman, Henry Moore, Anaïs Nin, Pablo Picasso, Andrei Voznesensky, and Yevgeny Yevtushenko. It also includes projects with her longtime collaborator, artist Saul Steinberg.\n\nPapers in the collection include story lists, captions, notebooks, general files, and publicity related chiefly to her photography. The collection also includes audiovisual material, electronic files, and artifacts.\n\nA group of printed material accompanies the collection and consists of an incomplete set of her monographs, as well as works related to travel, languages, and other subjects.\n\nThe collection also chronicles Morath's personal life, including her marriage and family with playwright Arthur Miller, and provides ancillary documentation of his work.\n\nIn this guide to the collection, library staff chiefly retained Morath's titles and spellings, while contact sheets include authorized forms of names derived from her story lists.\n\nChronological arrangements within the collection reflect the image creation date, not the date the photograph was printed. Notes throughout the collection include Morath's \"story numbers,\" when easily discerned by library staff.\n\nSeries I, Photographs, includes the bulk of photographic material created by Morath and her personal and family photographs, as well as photographs she collected by other photographers.\n\nSeries II, Papers, consists of papers that document the life and work of Morath, including story captions, notebooks, correspondence, clippings, financial records, and awards.\n\nSeries III, Photographs and Papers from the Morath-Miller Home, consists of material in the home of Morath and Arthur Miller in Roxbury, Connecticut, immediately before the Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library acquired the material in 2014. It includes personal and family photographs, correspondence, writings and travel notebooks, address books, visiting cards, exhibition catalogs, publicity material, art, and ephemera.\n\nSeries IV, Audio Visual Material, consists of sound recordings, videocassettes, and films by or about Morath, and includes interviews with her and documentation of her exhibitions.\n\nSeries V, Electronic Files, chiefly consists of the electronic files created by Morath, as well as by the Inge Morath Foundation, including image files and backup files, as well as operating system and utility program files used by her.\n\nSeries VI, Objects, consists of the items Morath used as a photographer, including a camera, film canisters, and rubber ink stamps used to mark her prints, as well as other personal effects, including scarves and a suitcase.\n\nThe Inge Morath Photographs and Papers is the physical property of the Beinecke Rare Book & Manuscript Library, Yale University. Ms. Rebecca Miller, her heirs and assigns retain all commercial rights in photographs and writings by Morath. Literary rights, including copyright, of others belong to the authors or their legal heirs and assigns. For further information, consult the appropriate curator.\n\nThe Beinecke Rare Book & Manuscript Library has the limited right to authorize scholars to reproduce up to five of Ms. Morath’s images in a scholarly publication.\n\nAny exhibition or reproduction of contact sheets or work prints by Ms. Morath requires their identification as contact sheets or work prints.\n\nThe Beinecke Rare Book & Manuscript Library will not reproduce for any purpose photographs or images identified as \"Family Photographs\" in boxes 509-539, 612, and 701-703.\n\nPhotographs by Ms. Morath from the \"Mask series\" of photographs share copyright with the Saul Steinberg Foundation, and any use thereof requires the approval of the Saul Steinberg Foundation."
