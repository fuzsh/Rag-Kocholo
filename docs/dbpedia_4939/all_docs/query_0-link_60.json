        "text": "Inge Morath, an Austrian photographer, became the second woman to join Magnum Photos, in 1955. Morath was admired for the way she immersed herself in the location and subject of her shoots; a linguistics major in college, she could speak six languages fluently. Starting in 1958, she dedicated years of her career to photographing daily life along the Danube River, which flows from Southern Germany to the edge of the Black Sea in Eastern Romania. In the mid-nineteen-nineties, after the fall of the Iron Curtain, Morath returned to the region to complete the project.\n\nIn July, eight female photographers set out to follow Morath’s path along the Danube for five weeks. The photographers, each of whom has won Magnum’s Inge Morath Award, converted a truck into a mobile gallery space that they are using to exhibit Morath’s work in the villages and towns she photographed. At the same time, the women are also creating a new body of work about contemporary life in the region, some of which they have posted to the New Yorker photo department’s Instagram feed. Below is a collection of photographs from their journey."
