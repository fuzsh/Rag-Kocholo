        "text": "‘This attractively-presented book is a careful and scholarly account of Rye which will prove to be the authoritative history of the town for the foreseeable future’. Professor Caroline Barron, Royal Holloway, University of London. Visitors to Rye immediately notice its striking hilltop site, the town’s main entrance, the Land Gate, and fishing boats on the river and quayside. There are wonderful views of Romney Marsh and the English Channel. Exploring Rye’s steep cobbled streets, visitors find St Mary’s parish church surrounded by other historic buildings, and the ‘castle’, the Ypres tower. There is an ancient grammar school, a stone chapel on Conduit Hill, a wealth of inns, medieval and Tudor timber-framed dwellings and other houses with brick facades. Rye was an Ancient Town which formed part of the important Cinque Ports confederation in the Middle Ages, yet has remained a small town ‘almost suspended in time’. How did this happen? This new illustrated history traces Rye’s origins from the Norman Conquest until beyond its period of great prosperity under the Tudor monarchs. Many inhabitants were fishermen or small-scale merchants and owned vessels which they supplied for the king’s ship-service, transporting members of the royal family across the Channel or, in wartime, carrying horses and provisions for soldiers. In times of truce Rye’s mariners turned to piracy and wrecking, disrupting the cross-channel trade on which the town’s economy also depended. During the Hundred Years’ War the townsfolk reinforced the defences and, in response to the huge mortality of the Black Death, they endowed an Augustinian Friary so that the brothers would pray for their health and souls. But then Rye entered a period of economic stagnation which saw the disappearance of many trades and crafts which had supported the residents and supplied mariners calling at the port. Rye’s revival came towards the end of the fifteenth century after the harbours of nearby ports such as New Romney and Winchelsea had been damaged by storms and silting. New houses, shops, fishermen’s lofts and garrets were built, public buildings were erected on the quayside and a piped water supply replaced the outlying medieval springs. A royal official, Sir Richard Guldeford, sailed from Rye on his pilgrimage to Jerusalem in 1506, and until the Reformation the townsfolk beautified the church and supported its chantries. Rye became a prosperous, if crowded, town and its Protestant sympathies and close links to the Continent ensured the arrival of many Huguenot refugees. For over a century Rye continued as the major port in south-east England but as its own harbour silted it was finally eclipsed by Dover in the seventeenth century."
