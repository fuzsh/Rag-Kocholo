ICE-L.\n\nPubMed\n\nLiu, Chenlin; Huang, Xiaohang\n\n2015-09-01\n\nDEAD-box RNA helicase family proteins have been identified in almost all living organisms. Some of them play a crucial role in adaptation to environmental changes and stress response, especially in the low-temperature acclimation in different kinds of organisms. Compared with the full swing study in plants and bacteria, the characters and functions of DEAD-box family proteins had not been surveyed in algae. To identify genes critical for freezing acclimation in algae, we screened DEAD-box RNA helicase genes from the transcriptome sequences of a psychrophilic microalga Chlamydomonas sp. ICE-L which was isolated from Antarctic sea ice. Totally 39 DEAD-box RNA helicase genes had been identified. Most of the DEAD-box RNA helicase have 1:1 homologous relationships in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and Chlamydomonas sp. ICE-L with several exceptions. The homologous proteins in ICE-L to the helicases critical for cold or freezing tolerance in Arabidopsis thaliana had been identified based on phylogenetic comparison studies. The response of these helicase genes is not always identical in the Chlamydomonas sp. ICE-L and Arabidopsis under the same low-temperature treatment. The expression of several DEAD-box RNA helicase genes including CiRH5, CiRH25, CiRH28, and CiRH55 were significantly up-regulated under freezing treatment of ICE-L and their function in freezing acclimation of ICE-L deserved further investigation.\n\nMultiple ice-binding proteins of probable prokaryotic origin in an Antarctic lake alga, Chlamydomonas sp. ICE-MDV (Chlorophyceae).\n\nPubMed\n\nRaymond, James A; Morgan-Kiss, Rachael\n\n2017-08-01\n\nIce-associated algae produce ice-binding proteins (IBPs) to prevent freezing damage. The IBPs of the three chlorophytes that have been examined so far share little similarity across species, making it likely that they were acquired by horizontal gene transfer (HGT). To clarify the importance and source of IBPs in chlorophytes, we sequenced the IBP genes of another Antarctic chlorophyte, Chlamydomonas sp. ICE-MDV (Chlamy-ICE). Genomic DNA and total RNA were sequenced and screened for known ice-associated genes. Chlamy-ICE has as many as 50 IBP isoforms, indicating that they have an important role in survival. The IBPs are of the DUF3494 type and have similar exon structures. The DUF3494 sequences are much more closely related to prokaryotic sequences than they are to sequences in other chlorophytes, and the chlorophyte IBP and ribosomal 18S phylogenies are dissimilar. The multiple IBP isoforms found in Chlamy-ICE and other algae may allow the algae to adapt to a greater variety of ice conditions than prokaryotes, which typically have a single IBP gene. The predicted structure of the DUF3494 domain has an ice-binding face with an orderly array of hydrophilic side chains. The results indicate that Chlamy-ICE acquired its IBP genes by HGT in a single event. The acquisitions of IBP genes by this and other species of Antarctic algae by HGT appear to be key evolutionary events that allowed algae to extend their ranges into polar environments.

ICE-L.\n\nPubMed\n\nXu, Dong; Wang, Yitao; Fan, Xiao; Wang, Dongsheng; Ye, Naihao; Zhang, Xiaowen; Mou, Shanli; Guan, Zheng; Zhuang, Zhimeng\n\n2014-07-15\n\nStudies on ocean acidification have mostly been based on short-term experiments of low latitude with few investigations of the long-term influence on sea ice communities. Here, the combined effects of ocean acidification and photoperiod on the physiological response of the Antarctic sea ice microalgae Chlamydomonas sp. ICE-L were examined. There was a general increase in growth, PSII photosynthetic parameters, and N and P uptake in continuous light, compared to those exposed to regular dark and light cycles. Elevated pCO2 showed no consistent effect on growth rate (p=0.8) and N uptake (p=0.38) during exponential phrase, depending on the photoperiod but had a positive effect on PSII photosynthetic capacity and P uptake. Continuous dark reduced growth, photosynthesis, and nutrient uptake. Moreover, intracellular lipid, mainly in the form of PUFA, was consumed at 80% and 63% in low and high pCO2 in darkness. However, long-term culture under high pCO2 gave a more significant inhibition of growth and Fv/Fm to high light stress. In summary, ocean acidification may have significant effects on Chlamydomonas sp. ICE-L survival in polar winter. The current study contributes to an understanding of how a sea ice algae-based community may respond to global climate change at high latitudes.\n\nAcclimation of Antarctic Chlamydomonas to the sea-ice environment: a transcriptomic analysis.\n\nPubMed\n\nLiu, Chenlin; Wang, Xiuliang; Wang, Xingna; Sun, Chengjun\n\n2016-07-01\n\nThe Antarctic green alga Chlamydomonas sp. ICE-L was isolated from sea ice. As a psychrophilic microalga, it can tolerate the environmental stress in the sea-ice brine, such as freezing temperature and high salinity. We performed a transcriptome analysis to identify freezing stress responding genes and explore the extreme environmental acclimation-related strategies. Here, we show that many genes in ICE-L transcriptome that encoding PUFA synthesis enzymes, molecular chaperon proteins, and cell membrane transport proteins have high similarity to the gens from Antarctic bacteria. These ICE-L genes are supposed to be acquired through horizontal gene transfer from its symbiotic microbes in the sea-ice brine. The presence of these genes in both sea-ice microalgae and bacteria indicated the biological processes they involved in are possibly contributing to ICE-L success in sea ice. In addition, the biological pathways were compared between ICE-L and its closely related sister species, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and Volvox carteri. In ICE-L transcripome, many sequences homologous to the plant or bacteria proteins in the post-transcriptional, post-translational modification, and signal-transduction KEGG pathways, are absent in the nonpsychrophilic green algae. These complex structural components might imply enhanced stress adaptation capacity. At last, differential gene expression analysis at the transcriptome level of ICE-L indicated that genes that associated with post-translational modification, lipid metabolism, and nitrogen metabolism are responding to the freezing treatment. In conclusion, the transcriptome of Chlamydomonas sp. ICE-L is very useful for exploring the mutualistic interaction between microalgae and bacteria in sea ice; and discovering the specific genes and metabolism pathways responding to the freezing acclimation in psychrophilic microalgae.\n\nCloning and Stress-Induced Expression Analysis of Calmodulin in the Antarctic Alga Chlamydomonas sp. ICE-L.\n\nPubMed\n\nHe, Ying-Ying; Wang, Yi-Bin; Zheng, Zhou; Liu, Fang-Ming; An, Mei-Ling; He, Xiao-Dong; Qu, Chang-Feng; Li, Lu-Lu; Miao, Jin-Lai\n\n2017-08-01\n\nCalmodulin (CaM) is a Ca 2+ -binding protein that plays a role in several Ca 2+ signaling pathways, which dynamically regulates the activities of hundreds of proteins. The ice alga Chlamydomonas sp. ICE-L, which has the ability to adapt to extreme polar conditions, is a crucial primary producer in Antarctic ecosystem. This study hypothesized that Cam helps the ICE-L to adapt to the fluctuating conditions in the polar environment. It first verified the overall length of Cam, through RT-PCR and RACE-PCR, based on partial Cam transcriptome library of ICE-L. Then, the nucleotide and predicted amino acid sequences were, respectively, analyzed by various bioinformatics approaches to gain more insights into the computed physicochemical properties of the CaM. Potential involvements of Cam in responding to certain stimuli (i.e., UVB radiation, high salinity, and temperature) were investigated by differential expression, measuring its transcription levels by means of quantitative RT-PCR. Results showed that CaM was indeed inducible and regulated by high UVB radiation, high salinity, and nonoptimal temperature conditions. Different conditions had different expression tendencies, which provided an important basis for investigating the adaptation mechanism of Cam in ICE-L.\n\nBasis of genetic adaptation to heavy metal stress in the acidophilic green alga Chlamydomonas acidophila.\n\nPubMed\n\nPuente-SÃ¡nchez, Fernando; DÃ­az, Silvia; Penacho, Vanessa; Aguilera, Angeles; Olsson, Sanna\n\n2018-07-01\n\nTo better understand heavy metal tolerance in Chlamydomonas acidophila, an extremophilic green alga, we assembled its transcriptome and measured transcriptomic expression before and after Cd exposure in this and the neutrophilic model microalga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. Genes possibly related to heavy metal tolerance and detoxification were identified and analyzed as potential key innovations that enable this species to live in an extremely acid habitat with high levels of heavy metals. In addition we provide a data set of single orthologous genes from eight green algal species as a valuable resource for comparative studies including eukaryotic extremophiles. Our results based on differential gene expression, detection of unique genes and analyses of codon usage all indicate that there are important genetic differences in C. acidophila compared to C. reinhardtii. Several efflux family proteins were identified as candidate key genes for adaptation to acid environments. This study suggests for the first time that exposure to cadmium strongly increases transposon expression in green algae, and that oil biosynthesis genes are induced in Chlamydomonas under heavy metal stress. Finally, the comparison of the transcriptomes of several acidophilic and non-acidophilic algae showed that the Chlamydomonas genus is polyphyletic and that acidophilic algae have distinctive aminoacid usage patterns.

ICE-L from Antarctica.\n\nPubMed\n\nLi, Lulu; An, Meiling; Qu, Changfeng; Zheng, Zhou; Wang, Yibin; Liu, Fangming; He, Yingying; He, Xiaodong; Miao, Jinlai\n\n2017-07-01\n\nMajor intrinsic proteins (MIPs) form channels facilitating the passive transport of water and other small polar molecules across membranes. In this study, the complete open reading frame (ORF) of CiMIP1 (GenBank ID KY316061) encoding one kind of MIPs in the Antarctic ice microalga Chlamydomonas sp. ICE-L is successfully cloned using RACE. In addition, the expression patterns of CiMIP1 gene under different conditions of temperature and salinity are determined by qRT-PCR. The ORF of CiMIP1 gene encodes 308 amino acids, and the deduced amino acid sequence shows 74% homology with Chlamydomonas reinhardtii CrMIP1 (GenBank number 159471952). Phylogenetic analysis reveals that algal MIPs are divided into seven groups, and it is speculated that CiMIP1 most likely belongs to the MIPD subfamily. In addition, we are surprised to find that a third NPA motif exists at the carboxy terminus of the target protein except for two highly conserved ones. Expression analysis shows that the transcriptional levels of CiMIP1 gene are upregulated under either lower temperature or higher temperature and high salinity. In summary, the results together have provide new insights into the newly discovered gene in green algae and lay the foundation for further studies on the adaptation mechanism of Chlamydomonas sp. ICE-L to abiotic stresses.\n\nAlgaGEM â a genome-scale metabolic reconstruction of algae based on the Chlamydomonas reinhardtii genome\n\nPubMed Central\n\n2011-01-01\n\nBackground Microalgae have the potential to deliver biofuels without the associated competition for land resources. In order to realise the rates and titres necessary for commercial production, however, system-level metabolic engineering will be required. Genome scale metabolic reconstructions have revolutionized microbial metabolic engineering and are used routinely for in silico analysis and design. While genome scale metabolic reconstructions have been developed for many prokaryotes and model eukaryotes, the application to less well characterized eukaryotes such as algae is challenging not at least due to a lack of compartmentalization data. Results We have developed a genome-scale metabolic network model (named AlgaGEM) covering the metabolism for a compartmentalized algae cell based on the Chlamydomonas reinhardtii genome. AlgaGEM is a comprehensive literature-based genome scale metabolic reconstruction that accounts for the functions of 866 unique ORFs, 1862 metabolites, 2249 gene-enzyme-reaction-association entries, and 1725 unique reactions. The reconstruction was compartmentalized into the cytoplasm, mitochondrion, plastid and microbody using available data for algae complemented with compartmentalisation data for Arabidopsis thaliana. AlgaGEM describes a functional primary metabolism of Chlamydomonas and significantly predicts distinct algal behaviours such as the catabolism or secretion rather than recycling of phosphoglycolate in photorespiration. AlgaGEM was validated through the simulation of growth and algae metabolic functions inferred from literature. Using efficient resource utilisation as the optimality criterion, AlgaGEM predicted observed metabolic effects under autotrophic, heterotrophic and mixotrophic conditions. AlgaGEM predicts increased hydrogen production when cyclic electron flow is disrupted as seen in a high producing mutant derived from mutational studies. The model also predicted the physiological pathway for H2 production and\n\nRespiratory-deficient mutants of the unicellular green alga Chlamydomonas: a review.\n\nPubMed\n\nSalinas, Thalia; Larosa, VÃ©ronique; Cardol, Pierre; MarÃ©chal-Drouard, Laurence; Remacle, Claire\n\n2014-05-01\n\nGenetic manipulation of the unicellular green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii is straightforward. Nuclear genes can be interrupted by insertional mutagenesis or targeted by RNA interference whereas random or site-directed mutagenesis allows the introduction of mutations in the mitochondrial genome. This, combined with a screen that easily allows discriminating respiratory-deficient mutants, makes Chlamydomonas a model system of choice to study mitochondria biology in photosynthetic organisms. Since the first description of Chlamydomonas respiratory-deficient mutants in 1977 by random mutagenesis, many other mutants affected in mitochondrial components have been characterized. These respiratory-deficient mutants increased our knowledge on function and assembly of the respiratory enzyme complexes. More recently some of these mutants allowed the study of mitochondrial gene expression processes poorly understood in Chlamydomonas.Â In this review, we update the data concerning the respiratory components with a special focus on the assembly factors identified on other organisms. In addition, we make an inventory of different mitochondrial respiratory mutants that are inactivated either on mitochondrial or nuclear genes. Copyright Â© 2013 Elsevier Masson SAS.

This paper presents the molecular characterization and expression analysis of HPT1 gene, and a study on the accumulation of tocopherols under different environmental conditions in the unicellular green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. The Chlamydomonas HPT1 protein conserves all the prenylphosphate- and divalent cation-binding sites that are found in polyprenyltransferases and all the amino acids that are essential for its catalytic activity. Its hydrophobicity profile confirms that HPT is a membrane-bound protein. Chlamydomonas genomic DNA analysis suggests that HPT is encoded by a single gene, HPT1, whose promoter region contains multiple motifs related to regulation by jasmonate, abscisic acid, low temperature and light, and an ATCTA motif presents in genes involved in tocopherol biosynthesis and some photosynthesis-related genes. Expression analysis revealed that HPT1 is strongly regulated by dark and low-temperature. Under the same treatments, Î±-tocopherol increased in cultures exposed to darkness or heat, whereas Î³-tocopherol did it in low temperature. The regulatory expression pattern of HPT1 and the changes of tocopherol abundance support the idea that different tocopherols play specific functions, and suggest a role for Î³-tocopherol in the adaptation to growth under low-temperature.

The biophysical habitat of sea ice on large scales and the physical drivers of algae phenology are key to understanding Arctic ecosystem dynamics and for predicting its response to ongoing Arctic climate change. In addition, quantifying potential feedback mechanisms between algae and physical processes is particularly important during a time of great change. These mechanisms include a shading effect due to the presence of algae and increased basal ice melt. The present study shows pan-Arctic results obtained from a new Sea Ice Model for Bottom Algae (SIMBA) coupled with a 3-D sea-ice-ocean model. The model is evaluated with data collected during a ship-based campaign to the Eastern Central Arctic in summer 2012. The algal bloom is triggered by light and shows a latitudinal dependency. Snow and ice also play a key role in ice algal growth. Simulations show that after the spring bloom, algae are nutrient limited before the end of summer and finally they leave the ice habitat during ice melt. The spatial distribution of ice algae at the end of summer agrees with available observations, and it emphasizes the importance of thicker sea-ice regions for hosting biomass. Particular attention is given to the distinction between level ice and ridged ice. Ridge-associated algae are strongly light limited, but they can thrive toward the end of summer, and represent an additional carbon source during the transition into polar night.\n\nThe TOR Signaling Network in the Model Unicellular Green Alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii.\n\nPubMed\n\nPÃ©rez-PÃ©rez, MarÃ­a Esther; Couso, Inmaculada; Crespo, JosÃ© L\n\n2017-07-12\n\nCell growth is tightly coupled to nutrient availability. The target of rapamycin (TOR) kinase transmits nutritional and environmental cues to the cellular growth machinery. TOR functions in two distinct multiprotein complexes, termed TOR complex 1 (TORC1) and TOR complex 2 (TORC2). While the structure and functions of TORC1 are highly conserved in all eukaryotes, including algae and plants, TORC2 core proteins seem to be missing in photosynthetic organisms. TORC1 controls cell growth by promoting anabolic processes, including protein synthesis and ribosome biogenesis, and inhibiting catabolic processes such as autophagy. Recent studies identified rapamycin-sensitive TORC1 signaling regulating cell growth, autophagy, lipid metabolism, and central metabolic pathways in the model unicellular green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii . The central role that microalgae play in global biomass production, together with the high biotechnological potential of these organisms in biofuel production, has drawn attention to the study of proteins that regulate cell growth such as the TOR kinase.

Here we report on the identification of the first (and only) typical aspartic proteinase from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. This enzyme, named chlapsin, was shown to maintain the primary structure organization of typical plant aspartic proteinases but comprising distinct features, such as similar catalytic motifs DTG/DTG resembling those from animal and microbial counterparts, and an unprecedentedly longer plant specific insert domain with an extra segment of 80 amino acids, rich in alanine residues. Our results also demonstrated that chlapsin accumulates in Chlamydomonas chloroplast bringing this new enzyme to a level of uniqueness among typical plant aspartic proteinases. Chlapsin was successfully expressed in Escherichia coli and it displayed the characteristic enzymatic properties of typical aspartic proteinases, like optimum activity at acidic pH and complete inhibition by pepstatin A. Another difference to plant aspartic proteinases emerged as chlapsin was produced in an active form without its putative prosegment domain. Moreover, recombinant chlapsin showed a restricted enzymatic specificity and a proteolytic activity influenced by the presence of redox agents and nucleotides, further differentiating it from typical plant aspartic proteinases and anticipating a more specialized/regulated function for this Chlamydomonas enzyme. Taken together, our results revealed a pattern of complexity for typical plant aspartic proteinases in what concerns sequence features, localization and biochemical properties, raising new questions on the evolution and function of this vast group of plant enzymes.\n\nMonitoring Autophagy in the Model Green Microalga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii.\n\nPubMed\n\nPÃ©rez-PÃ©rez, MarÃ­a Esther; Couso, Inmaculada; Heredia-MartÃ­nez, Luis G; Crespo, JosÃ© L\n\n2017-10-22\n\nAutophagy is an intracellular catabolic system that delivers cytoplasmic constituents and organelles in the vacuole. This degradative process is mediated by a group of proteins coded by autophagy-related ( ATG ) genes that are widely conserved from yeasts to plants and mammals. Homologs of ATG genes have been also identified in algal genomes including the unicellular model green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii . The development of specific tools to monitor autophagy in Chlamydomonas has expanded our current knowledge about the regulation and function of this process in algae. Recent findings indicated that autophagy is regulated by redox signals and the TOR network in Chlamydomonas and revealed that this process may play in important role in the control of lipid metabolism and ribosomal protein turnover in this alga. Here, we will describe the different techniques and approaches that have been reported to study autophagy and autophagic flux in Chlamydomonas.\n\nRobust Transgene Expression from Bicistronic mRNA in the Green Alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii\n\nPubMed Central\n\nOnishi, Masayuki; Pringle, John R.\n\n2016-01-01\n\nThe unicellular green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii is a model organism that provides an opportunity to understand the evolution and functional biology of the lineage that includes the land plants, as well as aspects of the fundamental core biology conserved throughout the eukaryotic phylogeny. Although many tools are available to facilitate genetic, molecular biological, biochemical, and cell biological studies in Chlamydomonas, expression of unselected transgenes of interest (GOIs) has been challenging. In most methods used previously, the GOI and a selectable marker are expressed from two separate mRNAs, so that their concomitant expression is not guaranteed. In this study, we developed constructs that allow expression of an upstream GOI and downstream selectable marker from a single bicistronic mRNA. Although this approach in other systems has typically required a translation-enhancing element such as an internal ribosome entry site for the downstream marker, we found that a short stretch of unstructured junction sequence was sufficient to obtain adequate expression of the downstream gene, presumably through post-termination reinitiation. With this system, we obtained robust expression of both endogenous and heterologous GOIs, including fluorescent proteins and tagged fusion proteins, in the vast majority of transformants, thus eliminating the need for tedious secondary screening for GOI-expressing transformants. This improved efficiency should greatly facilitate a variety of genetic and cell-biological studies in Chlamydomonas and also enable new applications such as expression-based screens and large-scale production of foreign proteins.

Paul; van den Broeke, Michiel R.; Ryan, Jonathan C.; Hubbard, Alun; Tranter, Martyn; van As, Dirk; AhlstrÃ¸m, Andreas P.\n\n2017-11-01\n\nSurface ablation of the Greenland ice sheet is amplified by surface darkening caused by light-absorbing impurities such as mineral dust, black carbon, and pigmented microbial cells. We present the first quantitative assessment of the microbial contribution to the ice sheet surface darkening, based on field measurements of surface reflectance and concentrations of light-absorbing impurities, including pigmented algae, during the 2014 melt season in the southwestern part of the ice sheet. The impact of algae on bare ice darkening in the study area was greater than that of nonalgal impurities and yielded a net albedo reduction of 0.038 Â± 0.0035 for each algal population doubling. We argue that algal growth is a crucial control of bare ice darkening, and incorporating the algal darkening effect will improve mass balance and sea level projections of the Greenland ice sheet and ice masses elsewhere.\n\nBiological effects of four iron-containing nanoremediation materials on the green alga Chlamydomonas sp.\n\nPubMed\n\nNguyen, Nhung H A; Von Moos, Nadia R; Slaveykova, Vera I; Mackenzie, Katrin; Meckenstock, Rainer U; ThÅ±mmler, Silke; Bosch, Julian; Å evcÅ¯, Alena\n\n2018-06-15\n\nAs nanoremediation strategies for in-situ groundwater treatment extend beyond nanoiron-based applications to adsorption and oxidation, ecotoxicological evaluations of newly developed materials are required. The biological effects of four new materials with different iron (Fe) speciations ([i] FerMEG12 - pristine flake-like milled Fe(0) nanoparticles (nZVI), [ii] Carbo-Iron Â® - Fe(0)-nanoclusters containing activated carbon (AC) composite, [iii] Trap-OxÂ® Fe-BEA35 (Fe-zeolite) - Fe-doped zeolite, and [iv] Nano-Goethite - 'pure' FeOOH) were studied using the unicellular green alga Chlamydomonas sp. as a model test system. Algal growth rate, chlorophyll fluorescence, efficiency of photosystem II, membrane integrity and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation were assessed following exposure to 10, 50 and 500â¯mgâ¯L -1 of the particles for 2â¯h and 24â¯h. The particles had a concentration-, material- and time-dependent effect on Chlamydomonas sp., with increased algal growth rate after 24â¯h. Conversely, significant intracellular ROS levels were detected after 2â¯h, with much lower levels after 24â¯h. All Fe-nanomaterials displayed similar Z-average sizes and zeta-potentials at 2â¯h and 24â¯h. Effects on Chlamydomonas sp. decreased in the order FerMEG12Â >Â Carbo-IronÂ® >Â Fe-zeolite >Â Nano-Goethite. Ecotoxicological studies were challenged due to some particle properties, i.e. dark colour, effect of constituents and a tendency to agglomerate, especially at high concentrations. All particles exhibited potential to induce significant toxicity at high concentrations (500â¯mgâ¯L -1 ), though such concentrations would rapidly decrease to mg or Âµgâ¯L -1 in aquatic environments, levels harmless to Chlamydomonas sp. The presented findings contribute to the practical usage of particle-based nanoremediation in environmental restoration. Copyright Â© 2018.

C.; de Lamotte-Guery, F.; Buchanan, B. B.\n\n1990-01-01\n\nThe components of the ferredoxin-thioredoxin (FT) system of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii have been purified and characterized. The system resembled that of higher plants in consisting of a ferredoxin-thioredoxin reductase (FTR) and two types of thioredoxin, a single f and two m species, m1 and m2. The Chlamydomonas m and f thioredoxins were antigenically similar to their higher-plant counterparts, but not to one another. The m thioredoxins were recognized by antibodies to both higher plant m and bacterial thioredoxins, whereas the thioredoxin f was not. Chlamydomonas thioredoxin f reacted, although weakly, with the antibody to spinach thioredoxin f. The algal thioredoxin f differed from thioredoxins studied previously in behaving as a basic protein on ion-exchange columns. Purification revealed that the algal thioredoxins had molecular masses (Mrs) typical of thioredoxins from other sources, m1 and m2 being 10700 and f 11500. Chlamydomonas FTR had two dissimilar subunits, a feature common to all FTRs studied thus far. One, the 13-kDa (\"similar\") subunit, resembled its counterpart from other sources in both size and antigenicity. The other, 10-kDa (\"variable\") subunit was not recognized by antibodies to any FTR tested. When combined with spinach, (Spinacia oleracea L.) thylakoid membranes, the components of the FT system functioned in the light activation of the standard target enzymes from chloroplasts, corn (Zea mays L.) NADP-malate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.82) and spinach fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase (EC 3.1.3.11) as well as the chloroplast-type fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase from Chlamydomonas. Activity was greatest if ferredoxin and other components of the FT system were from Chlamydomonas. The capacity of the Chlamydomonas FT system to activate autologous FBPase indicates that light regulates the photosynthetic carbon metabolism of green algae as in other oxygenic photosynthetic organisms.\n\nCarbon Supply and Photoacclimation Cross Talk in the Green Alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii1[OPEN\n\nPubMed Central\n\nFristedt, Rikard; Dinc, Emine\n\n2016-01-01\n\nPhotosynthetic organisms are exposed to drastic changes in light conditions, which can affect their photosynthetic efficiency and induce photodamage. To face these changes, they have developed a series of acclimation mechanisms. In this work, we have studied the acclimation strategies of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, a model green alga that can grow using various carbon sources and is thus an excellent system in which to study photosynthesis. Like other photosynthetic algae, it has evolved inducible mechanisms to adapt to conditions where carbon supply is limiting. We have analyzed how the carbon availability influences the composition and organization of the photosynthetic apparatus and the capacity of the cells to acclimate to different light conditions. Using electron microscopy, biochemical, and fluorescence measurements, we show that differences in CO2 availability not only have a strong effect on the induction of the carbon-concentrating mechanisms but also change the acclimation strategy of the cells to light. For example, while cells in limiting CO2 maintain a large antenna even in high light and switch on energy-dissipative mechanisms, cells in high CO2 reduce the amount of pigments per cell and the antenna size. Our results show the high plasticity of the photosynthetic apparatus of C. reinhardtii. This alga is able to use various photoacclimation strategies, and the choice of which to activate strongly depends on the carbon availability.

K.; Polashenski, C.; Stwertka, C.\n\n2015-12-01\n\nThe amount of light that penetrates the Arctic sea ice cover impacts sea-ice mass balance as well as ecological processes in the upper ocean. The seasonally evolving macro and micro spatial variability of transmitted spectral irradiance observed in the Chukchi Sea from May 18 to June 17, 2014 can be primarily attributed to variations in snow depth, ice thickness, and bottom ice algae concentrations. This study characterizes the interactions among these dominant variables using observed optical properties at each sampling site. We employ a normalized difference index to compute estimates of Chlorophyll a concentrations and analyze the increased attenuation of incident irradiance due to absorption by biomass. On a kilometer spatial scale, the presence of bottom ice algae reduced the maximum transmitted irradiance by about 1.5 orders of magnitude when comparing floes of similar snow and ice thicknesses. On a meter spatial scale, the combined effects of disparities in the depth and distribution of the overlying snow cover along with algae concentrations caused maximum transmittances to vary between 0.0577 and 0.282 at a single site. Temporal variability was also observed as the average integrated transmitted photosynthetically active radiation increased by one order of magnitude to 3.4% for the last eight measurement days compared to the first nine. Results provide insight on how interrelated physical and ecological parameters of sea ice in varying time and space may impact new trends in Arctic sea ice extent and the progression of melt.\n\nChlamydomonas: A Model Green Plant.\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nSheffield, E.\n\n1985-01-01\n\nDiscusses the instructional potential of Chlamydomonas in providing a basis for a range of experimental investigations to illustrate basic biological phenomena.

But limitations still exist because of its high cost. Although, efforts have been made in enhancement of lipid productivity, the major cost problem in harvesting and oil extraction is still intractable. Thus, the idea of fatty acids (FAs) secretion which can massively facilitate algae harvesting and oil extraction was investigated here. The cDNAs of two long-chain acyl-CoA synthetases (LACSs) genes were cloned from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and named as cracs1 and cracs2. They showed different substrate adaptation in the yeast complementation experiments. Cracs2 could utilize FAs C12:0, C14:0, C16:0, C18:0, C16:1 and C18:1, while crac1 could only utilize substrate C14:0, C16:1 and C18:1. Knockdown of cracs1 and cracs2 in C. reinhardtii resulted in accumulation of intracellular lipids. The total intracellular lipids contents of transgenic algae q-15 (knockdown of cracs1) and p-13 (knockdown of cracs2) were 45 and 55Â %, respectively higher than that of cc849. Furthermore, FAs secretion was discovered in both transgenic algae. Secreted FAs can reach 8.19 and 9.66Â mg/10(9) cells in q-15 and p-13, respectively. These results demonstrated the possibility of FAs secretion by microalgae and may give a new strategy of low-cost oil extraction. According to our findings, we proposed that FAs secretion may also be achieved in other species besides Chlamydomonas reinhardtii by knocking-down cracs genes, which may promote the future industrial application of microalgae biofuels.\n\nHyperspectral imaging of snow algae and green algae from aeroterrestrial habitats.\n\nPubMed\n\nHolzinger, Andreas; Allen, Michael C; Deheyn, Dimitri D\n\n2016-09-01\n\nSnow algae and green algae living in aeroterrestrial habitats are ideal objects to study adaptation to high light irradiation. Here, we used a detailed description of the spectral properties as a proxy for photo-acclimation/protection in snow algae (Chlamydomonas nivalis, Chlainomonas sp. and Chloromonas sp.) and charophyte green algae (Zygnema sp., Zygogonium ericetorum and Klebsormidium crenulatum). The hyperspectral microscopic mapping and imaging technique allowed us to acquire total absorption spectra of these microalgae in the waveband of 400-900nm. Particularly in Chlamydomonas nivalis and Chlainomonas sp., a high absorbance between 400-550nm was observed, due to naturally occurring secondary carotenoids; in Chloromonas sp. and in the charopyhte algae this high absorbance was missing, the latter being close relatives to land plants. To investigate if cellular water loss has an influence on the spectral properties, the cells were plasmolysed in sorbitol or desiccated at ambient air. While in snow algae, these treatments did hardly change the spectral properties, in the charopyhte algae the condensation of the cytoplasm and plastids increased the absorbance in the lower waveband of 400-500nm. These changes might be ecologically relevant and photoprotective, as aeroterrestrial algae are naturally exposed to occasional water limitation, leading to desiccation, which are conditions usually occurring together with higher irradiation.

G.; Gosselin, M.; Levasseur, M.\n\n1996-08-01\n\nThe fate of ice-bottom algae, before and after release from the first-year sea ice into the water column, was assessed during the period of ice-algal growth and decline in Resolute Passage (Canadian Arctic). During spring 1992 (from April to June), algae in the bottom ice layer and those suspended and sinking in the upper water column (top 15 m) were sampled approximately every 4 days. Ice-bottom chlorophyll a reached a maximum concentration of 160 mg m-2 in mid-May, after which it decreased to lower values. In the water column, chlorophyll a concentrations were low until the period of ice-algal decline (Ë0.1 mg m-3), with most biomass in the <5-Î¼m fraction. In both the suspended and sinking material, large increases of algal biomass occurred at the beginning of June, following the release of ice-algae into the water column. The input of ice-algal derived carbon to the upper water column and the proportions exported through sinking or remaining in suspension were assessed using a carbon budget for the two periods of ice-algal growth and decline. For each period the output terms closely balanced the input. The carbon budget showed that most of the biomass introduced into the upper water column remained suspended (>65% of total export) and that ice-algae were ingested by under-ice grazers after release from the ice. These results stress the importance of ice algae for pelagic consumers during the early stages of ice melt and show that the transfer of ice algae to higher trophic levels extends beyond the period of maximum algal production in the ice bottom.\n\nCharacterization of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii Core Histones by Top-Down Mass Spectrometry Reveals Unique Algae-Specific Variants and Post-Translational Modifications.\n\nPubMed\n\nKhan, Aliyya; Eikani, Carlo K; Khan, Hana; Iavarone, Anthony T; Pesavento, James J\n\n2018-01-05\n\nThe unicellular microalga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii has played an instrumental role in the development of many new fields (bioproducts, biofuels, etc.) as well as the advancement of basic science (photosynthetic apparati, flagellar function, etc.). Chlamydomonas' versatility ultimately derives from the genes encoded in its genome and the way that the expression of these genes is regulated, which is largely influenced by a family of DNA binding proteins called histones. We characterize C. reinhardtii core histones, both variants and their post-translational modifications, by chromatographic separation, followed by top-down mass spectrometry (TDMS). Because TDMS has not been previously used to study Chlamydomonas proteins, we show rampant artifactual protein oxidation using established nuclei purification and histone extraction methods. After addressing oxidation, both histones H3 and H4 are found to each have a single polypeptide sequence that is minimally acetylated and methylated. Surprisingly, we uncover a novel monomethylation at lysine 79 on histone H4 present on all observed molecules. Histone H2B and H2A are found to have two and three variants, respectively, and both are minimally modified. This study provides an updated assessment of the core histone proteins in the green alga C. reinhardtii by top-down mass spectrometry and lays the foundation for further investigation of these essential proteins.\n\nIdentification of astaxanthin diglucoside diesters from snow alga Chlamydomonas nivalis by liquid chromatography-atmospheric pressure chemical ionization mass spectrometry.\n\nPubMed\n\nRezanka, TomÃ¡s; NedbalovÃ¡, Linda; Sigler, Karel; CepÃ¡k, Vladislav\n\n2008-01-01\n\nA method is described for the identification of astaxanthin glucoside esters from snow alga Chlamydomonas nivalis by means of liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry with atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (LC-MS/APCI). The method is based on the use of preparative HPLC and subsequent identification of astaxanthin diglucoside diesters by microbore LC-MS/APCI. The combination of these two techniques was used to identify more than 100 molecular species. The astaxanthin diglucoside diester, i.e. (all-E)-[di-(6-O-oleoyl-beta-D-glucopyranosyloxy)]-astaxanthin, was also synthesized to unambiguously confirm its structure.\n\nComparative genomic analysis of retrogene repertoire in two green algae Volvox carteri and Chlamydomonas reinhardtii.\n\nPubMed\n\nJÄ kalski, Marcin; Takeshita, Kazutaka; Deblieck, Mathieu; Koyanagi, Kanako O; MakaÅowska, Izabela; Watanabe, Hidemi; MakaÅowski, Wojciech\n\n2016-08-04\n\nRetroposition, one of the processes of copying the genetic material, is an important RNA-mediated mechanism leading to the emergence of new genes. Because the transcription controlling segments are usually not copied to the new location in this mechanism, the duplicated gene copies (retrocopies) become pseudogenized. However, few can still survive, e.g. by recruiting novel regulatory elements from the region of insertion. Subsequently, these duplicated genes can contribute to the formation of lineage-specific traits and phenotypic diversity. Despite the numerous studies of the functional retrocopies (retrogenes) in animals and plants, very little is known about their presence in green algae, including morphologically diverse species. The current availability of the genomes of both uni- and multicellular algae provides a good opportunity to conduct a genome-wide investigation in order to fill the knowledge gap in retroposition phenomenon in this lineage. Here we present a comparative genomic analysis of uni- and multicellular algae, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and Volvox carteri, respectively, to explore their retrogene complements. By adopting a computational approach, we identified 141 retrogene candidates in total in both genomes, with their fraction being significantly higher in the multicellular Volvox. Majority of the retrogene candidates showed signatures of functional constraints, thus indicating their functionality. Detailed analyses of the identified retrogene candidates, their parental genes, and homologs of both, revealed that most of the retrogene candidates were derived from ancient retroposition events in the common ancestor of the two algae and that the parental genes were subsequently lost from the respective lineages, making many retrogenes 'orphan'. We revealed that the genomes of the green algae have maintained many possibly functional retrogenes in spite of experiencing various molecular evolutionary events during a long evolutionary time after\n\nThe light environment and cellular optics of the snow alga Chlamydomonas nivalis (Bauer) Wille.\n\nPubMed\n\nGorton, H L; Williams, W E; Vogelmann, T C\n\n2001-06-01\n\nThe alga Chlamydomonas nivalis lives in a high-light, cold environment: persistent alpine snowfields. Since the algae in snow receive light from all angles, the photon fluence rate is the critical parameter for photosynthesis, but it is rarely measured. We measured photon irradiance and photon fluence rate in the snow that contained blooms of C. nivalis. On a cloudless day the photon fluence rate at the snow surface was nearly twice the photon irradiance, and it can be many times greater than the photon irradiance when the solar angle is low or the light is diffuse. Beneath the surface the photon fluence rate can be five times the photon irradiance. Photon irradiance and photon fluence rate declined exponentially with depth, approximating the Bouguer-Lambert relationship. We used an integrating sphere to measure the spectral characteristics of a monolayer of cells and microscopic techniques to examine the spectral characteristics of individual cells. Astaxanthin blocked blue light and unknown absorbers blocked UV radiation; the penetration of these wavelengths through whole cells was negligible. We extracted astaxanthin, measured absorbance on a per-cell basis and estimated that the layer of astaxanthin within cells would allow only a small percentage of the blue light to reach the chloroplast, potentially protecting the chloroplast from excessive light.\n\nEcophysiology, secondary pigments and ultrastructure of Chlainomonas sp. (Chlorophyta) from the European Alps compared with Chlamydomonas nivalis forming red snow\n\nPubMed Central\n\nRemias, Daniel; PichrtovÃ¡, Martina; Pangratz, Marion; LÃ¼tz, Cornelius; Holzinger, Andreas\n\n2016-01-01\n\nRed snow is a well-known phenomenon caused by microalgae thriving in alpine and polar regions during the melting season. The ecology and biodiversity of these organisms, which are adapted to low temperatures, high irradiance and freezeâthaw events, are still poorly understood. We compared two different snow habitats containing two different green algal genera in the European Alps, namely algae blooming in seasonal rock-based snowfields (Chlamydomonas nivalis) and algae dominating waterlogged snow bedded over ice (Chlainomonas sp.). Despite the morphological similarity of the red spores found at the snow surface, we found differences in intracellular organization investigated by light and transmission electron microscopy and in secondary pigments investigated by chromatographic analysis in combination with mass spectrometry. Spores of Chlainomonas sp. show clear differences from Chlamydomonas nivalis in cell wall arrangement and plastid organization. Active photosynthesis at ambient temperatures indicates a high physiological activity, despite no cell division being present. Lipid bodies containing the carotenoid astaxanthin, which produces the red color, dominate cells of both species, but are modified differently. While in Chlainomonas sp. astaxanthin is mainly esterified with two fatty acids and is more apolar, in Chamydomonas nivalis, in contrast, less apolar monoesters prevail.

For many years the unicellular green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii has served as an experimental organism for studying photosynthetic processes. The recent development of molecular tools for this organism together with efficient methods of genetic analysis and the availability of many photosynthesis mutants has now made this alga a powerful model system for the analysis of chloroplast biogenesis. For example, techniques have been developed to transfer recombinant DNA into both the nuclear and the chloroplast genome. This allows both complementation tests and analyses of gene functions in vivo. Moreover, site-specific DNA recombinations in the chloroplast allow targeted gene disruption experiments which enable a \"reverse genetics\" to be performed. The potential of the algal system for the study of chloroplast biogenesis is illustrated in this review by the description of regulatory systems of gene expression involved in organelle biogenesis. One example concerns the regulation of trans-splicing of chloroplast mRNAs, a process which is controlled by both multiple nuclear- and chloroplast-encoded factors. The second example involves the stabilization of chloroplast mRNAs. The available data lead us predict distinct RNA elements, which interact with trans-acting factors to protect the RNA against nucleolytic attacks.\n\nGreen Synthesis of Metal and Metal Oxide Nanoparticles and Their Effect on the Unicellular Alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nNguyen, Nhung H. A.; Padil, Vinod Vellora Thekkae; Slaveykova, Vera I.; ÄernÃ­k, Miroslav; Å evcÅ¯, Alena\n\n2018-05-01\n\nRecently, the green synthesis of metal nanoparticles has attracted wide attention due to its feasibility and very low environmental impact. This approach was applied in this study to synthesise nanoscale gold (Au), platinum (Pt), palladium (Pd), silver (Ag) and copper oxide (CuO) materials in simple aqueous media using the natural polymer gum karaya as a reducing and stabilising agent. The nanoparticles' (NPs) zeta-potential, stability and size were characterised by Zetasizer Nano, UV-Vis spectroscopy and by electron microscopy. Moreover, the biological effect of the NPs (concentration range 1.0-20.0 mg/L) on a unicellular green alga ( Chlamydomonas reinhardtii) was investigated by assessing algal growth, membrane integrity, oxidative stress, chlorophyll ( Chl) fluorescence and photosystem II photosynthetic efficiency. The resulting NPs had a mean size of 42 (Au), 12 (Pt), 1.5 (Pd), 5 (Ag) and 180 (CuO) nm and showed high stability over 6 months. At concentrations of 5 mg/L, Au and Pt NPs only slightly reduced algal growth, while Pd, Ag and CuO NPs completely inhibited growth. Ag, Pd and CuO NPs showed strong biocidal properties and can be used for algae prevention in swimming pools (CuO) or in other antimicrobial applications (Pd, Ag), whereas Au and Pt lack these properties and can be ranked as harmless to green alga.\n\nH+- and Na+- elicited rapid changes of the microtubule cytoskeleton in the biflagellated green alga Chlamydomonas\n\nPubMed Central\n\nLiu, Yi; Visetsouk, Mike; Mynlieff, Michelle; Qin, Hongmin; Lechtreck, Karl F\n\n2017-01-01\n\nAlthough microtubules are known for dynamic instability, the dynamicity is considered to be tightly controlled to support a variety of cellular processes. Yet diverse evidence suggests that this is not applicable to Chlamydomonas, a biflagellate fresh water green alga, but intense autofluorescence from photosynthesis pigments has hindered the investigation. By expressing a bright fluorescent reporter protein at the endogenous level, we demonstrate in real time discreet sweeping changes in algal microtubules elicited by rises of intracellular H+ and Na+. These results from this model organism with characteristics of animal and plant cells provide novel explanations regarding how pH may drive cellular processes; how plants may respond to, and perhaps sense stresses; and how organisms with a similar sensitive cytoskeleton may be susceptible to environmental changes.

B.; Miginiac-Maslow, M.\n\n1991-01-01\n\nThe protein components of the NADP/thioredoxin system, NADP-thioredoxin reductase (NTR) and thioredoxin h, have been purified and characterized from the green alga, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. The analysis of this system confirms that photoautotrophic Chlamydomonas cells resemble leaves in having both an NADP- and ferrodoxin-linked thioredoxin redox system. Chlamydomonas thioredoxin h, which is smaller on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis than thioredoxin m from the same source, cross-reacted with antisera to thioredoxin h from spinach (Spinacia oleracea L.) and wheat germ (Triticum vulgaris L.) but not with antisera to m or f thioredoxins. In these properties, the thioredoxin h resembled a thioredoxin from Chlamydomonas, designated Ch1, whose sequence was reported recently (P. Decottignies et al., 1991, Eur. J. Biochem. 198, 505-512). The differential reactivity of thioredoxin h with antisera was used to demonstrate that thioredoxin h is enriched outside the chloroplast. The NTR was purified from Chlamydomonas using thioredoxin h from the same source. Similar to its counterpart from other organisms, Chlamydomonas NTR had a subunit size of approx. 36 kDa and was specific for NADPH. Chlamydomonas NTR effectively reduced thioredoxin h from the same source but showed little activity with the other thioredoxins tested, including spinach thioredoxin h and Escherichia coli thioredoxin. Comparison of the reduction of Chlamydomonas thioredoxins m and h by each of the endogenous thioredoxin reductases, NTR and ferredoxin-thioredoxin reductase, revealed a differential specificity of each enzyme for thioredoxin. Thus, NTR showed increased activity with thioredoxin h and ferredoxin-thioredoxin reductase with thioredoxins m and f.\n\nSea-ice eukaryotes of the Gulf of Finland, Baltic Sea, and evidence for herbivory on weakly shade-adapted ice algae.\n\nPubMed\n\nMajaneva, Markus; Blomster, Jaanika; MÃ¼ller, Susann; Autio, Riitta; Majaneva, Sanna; HyytiÃ¤inen, Kirsi; Nagai, Satoshi; Rintala, Janne-Markus\n\n2017-02-01\n\nTo determine community composition and physiological status of early spring sea-ice organisms, we collected sea-ice, slush and under-ice water samples from the Baltic Sea. We combined light microscopy, HPLC pigment analysis and pyrosequencing, and related the biomass and physiological status of sea-ice algae with the protistan community composition in a new way in the area. In terms of biomass, centric diatoms including a distinct Melosira arctica bloom in the upper intermediate section of the fast ice, dinoflagellates, euglenoids and the cyanobacterium Aphanizomenon sp. predominated in the sea-ice sections and unidentified flagellates in the slush. Based on pigment analyses, the ice-algal communities showed no adjusted photosynthetic pigment pools throughout the sea ice, and the bottom-ice communities were not shade-adapted. The sea ice included more characteristic phototrophic taxa (49%) than did slush (18%) and under-ice water (37%). Cercozoans and ciliates were the richest taxon groups, and the differences among the communities arose mainly from the various phagotrophic protistan taxa inhabiting the communities. The presence of pheophytin a coincided with an elevated ciliate biomass and read abundance in the drift ice and with a high Eurytemora affinis read abundance in the pack ice, indicating that ciliates and Eurytemora affinis were grazing on algae.

To understand the molecular mechanism of H(2) metabolism, we used 2-DE coupled with MALDI-TOF and MALDI-TOF/TOF-MS to investigate proteomic changes of Chlamydomonas cells that undergo sulfur-depleted H(2) photoproduction process. In this report, we obtained 2-D PAGE soluble protein profiles of Chlamydomonas at three time points representing different phases leading to H(2) production. We found over 105 Coomassie-stained protein spots, corresponding to 82 unique gene products, changed in abundance throughout the process. Major changes included photosynthetic machinery, protein biosynthetic apparatus, molecular chaperones, and 20S proteasomal components. A number of proteins related to sulfate, nitrogen and acetate assimilation, and antioxidative reactions were also changed significantly. Other proteins showing alteration during the sulfur-depleted H(2) photoproduction process were proteins involved in cell wall and flagella metabolisms. In addition, among these differentially expressed proteins, 11 were found to be predicted proteins without functional annotation in the Chlamydomonas genome database. The results of this proteomic analysis provide new insight into molecular basis of H(2) photoproduction in Chlamydomonas under sulfur depletion.\n\nComplementarity to an miRNA seed region is sufficient to induce moderate repression of a target transcript in the unicellular green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii.\n\nPubMed\n\nYamasaki, Tomohito; Voshall, Adam; Kim, Eun-Jeong; Moriyama, Etsuko; Cerutti, Heriberto; Ohama, Takeshi\n\n2013-12-01\n\nMicroRNAs (miRNAs) are 20-24 nt non-coding RNAs that play important regulatory roles in a broad range of eukaryotes by pairing with mRNAs to direct post-transcriptional repression. The mechanistic details of miRNA-mediated post-transcriptional regulation have been well documented in multicellular model organisms. However, this process remains poorly studied in algae such as Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, and specific features of miRNA biogenesis, target mRNA recognition and subsequent silencing are not well understood. In this study, we report on the characterization of a Chlamydomonas miRNA, cre-miR1174.2, which is processed from a near-perfect hairpin RNA. Using Gaussia luciferase (gluc) reporter genes, we have demonstrated that cre-miR1174.2 is functional in Chlamydomonas and capable of triggering site-specific cleavage at the center of a perfectly complementary target sequence. A mismatch tolerance test assay, based on pools of transgenic strains, revealed that target hybridization to nucleotides of the seed region, at the 5' end of an miRNA, was sufficient to induce moderate repression of expression. In contrast, pairing to the 3' region of the miRNA was not critical for silencing. Our results suggest that the base-pairing requirements for small RNA-mediated repression in C. reinhardtii are more similar to those of metazoans compared with the extensive complementarity that is typical of land plants. Individual Chlamydomonas miRNAs may potentially modulate the expression of numerous endogenous targets as a result of these relaxed base-pairing requirements.

In this paper, a full-length Î±-CA gene was cloned from Chlamydomonas sp. ICE-L using RT-PCR and RACE-PCR for bioinformatic analysis. The Î±-CA open reading frame obtained by PCR was cloned into a vector and transformed into Escherichia coli to generate Î±-CA-producing bacteria. The Î±-CA was highly expressed upon induction with isopropyl-Î²-d-thiogalactoside (IPTG) at a final concentration of 0.8Â mM. A single band with a molecular weight of approximate 40Â kDa expressed in the recombinant E. coli strain harboring the Î±-CA vector was observed in SDS-PAGE analysis. The carbon dioxide hydration activity and esterase activity of Î±-CA expressed by the recombinant strain were 0.404Â U/mg and 0.319Â U, respectively. In addition, three conditions, temperature, salinity and UVB radiation exposure, were selected to analyze Î±-CA transcription levels by qRT-PCR. The results suggested UVB exposure increased the expression of relative mRNA; meanwhile, the Î±-CA mRNA expression was rapidly induced by temperature and salinity stress, indicating that Chlamydomonas sp. ICE-L might modulate the Î±-CA mRNA expression to adapt to the extreme environments.\n\nSurvival and proliferation characteristics of the microalga Chlamydomonas sp. ICE-L after hypergravitational stress pretreatment\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nGao, Zhengquan; Li, Demao; Meng, Chunxiao; Xu, Dong; Zhang, Xiaowen; Ye, Naihao\n\n2013-09-01\n\nSeeking extraterrestrial life, transferring between planets, even migrating to other planets attracts more and more attention of public and scientists. However, to make it clear for the ability to survive the forces studies is prerequisite to enable the speculations by natural means. Gravity is a critical force involved in all the life on Earth and, possibly, others planets. Organisms have been grown in microgravity habitats and in centrifuges to characterize the biological response to a range of gravitational forces and radiation levels in space and on Earth. However, little is known about the profiles of eukaryotic life under conditions of hyperacceleration attributable to extreme gravities. In this study, a eukaryotic extremophile, the Antarctic green microalga Chlamydomonas sp. ICE-L, showed amazing proliferation capacity during and after hypergravitational stress for 30 min to 48 h at 110,200, 423,400, and 670,800g. These extreme gravities also had profound effects on viability, reproduction rate, photosynthesis efficiency, and gene transcriptional expression of this microalga. Most notably, all three supergravities efficiently stimulated algal cell division, but the greater the centrifugal force and the longer the duration of treatment, the lower the viable rate and breeding potential of samples in the following incubation. These results illustrated Chlamydomonas sp. ICE-L is a useful eukaryotic model system candidate for space research. Further studies could provide new insight into the physical limits of life and its evolution and enhance the possibility for interstellar space travel and the quest for extraterrestrial life according to panspermia theory. Also, it indicated that life come from the outer space is not always prokaryotes but may be eukaryotes.\n\nEvolution of the Phosphatidylcholine Biosynthesis Pathways in Green Algae: Combinatorial Diversity of Methyltransferases.\n\nPubMed\n\nHirashima, Takashi; Toyoshima, Masakazu; Moriyama, Takashi; Sato, Naoki\n\n2018-01-01\n\nPhosphatidylcholine (PC) is one of the most common phospholipids in eukaryotes, although some green algae such as Chlamydomonas reinhardtii are known to lack PC. Recently, we detected PC in four species in the genus Chlamydomonas: C. applanata NIES-2202, C. asymmetrica NIES-2207, C. debaryana NIES-2212, and C. sphaeroides NIES-2242. To reveal the PC biosynthesis pathways in green algae and the evolutionary scenario involved in their diversity, we analyzed the PC biosynthesis genes in these four algae using draft genome sequences. Homology searches suggested that PC in these species is synthesized by phosphoethanolamine-N-methyltransferase (PEAMT) and/or phosphatidylethanolamine-N-methyltransferase (PEMT), both of which are absent in C. reinhardtii. Recombinant PEAMTs from these algae showed methyltransferase activity for phosphoethanolamine but not for monomethyl phosphoethanolamine in vitro, in contrast to land plant PEAMT, which catalyzes the three methylations from phosphoethanolamine to phosphocholine. This suggested an involvement of other methyltransferases in PC biosynthesis. Here, we characterized the putative phospholipid-N-methyltransferase (PLMT) genes of these species by genetic and phylogenetic analysis. Complementation assays using a PC biosynthesis-deficient yeast suggested that the PLMTs of these algae can synthesize PC from phosphatidylethanolamine. These results indicated that the PC biosynthesis pathways in green algae differ from those of land plants, although the enzymes involved are homologous. Phylogenetic analysis suggested that the PEAMTs and PLMTs in these algae were inherited from the common ancestor of green algae. The absence of PC biosynthesis in many Chlamydomonas species is likely a result of parallel losses of PEAMT and PLMT in this genus.\n\nThe Chlamydomonas Genome Reveals the Evolution of Key Animal and Plant Functions\n\nPubMed Central\n\nMerchant, Sabeeha S.; Prochnik, Simon E.; Vallon, Olivier; Harris, Elizabeth H.; Karpowicz, Steven J.; Witman, George B.; Terry, Astrid; Salamov, Asaf; Fritz-Laylin, Lillian K.; MarÃ©chal-Drouard, Laurence; Marshall, Wallace F.; Qu, Liang-Hu; Nelson, David R.; Sanderfoot, Anton A.; Spalding, Martin H.; Kapitonov, Vladimir V.; Ren, Qinghu; Ferris, Patrick; Lindquist, Erika; Shapiro, Harris; Lucas, Susan M.; Grimwood, Jane; Schmutz, Jeremy; Cardol, Pierre; Cerutti, Heriberto; Chanfreau, Guillaume; Chen, Chun-Long; Cognat, ValÃ©rie; Croft, Martin T.; Dent, Rachel; Dutcher, Susan; FernÃ¡ndez, Emilio; Ferris, Patrick; Fukuzawa, Hideya; GonzÃ¡lez-Ballester, David; GonzÃ¡lez-Halphen, Diego; Hallmann, Armin; Hanikenne, Marc; Hippler, Michael; Inwood, William; Jabbari, Kamel; Kalanon, Ming; Kuras, Richard; Lefebvre, Paul A.; Lemaire, StÃ©phane D.; Lobanov, Alexey V.; Lohr, Martin; Manuell, Andrea; Meier, Iris; Mets, Laurens; Mittag, Maria; Mittelmeier, Telsa; Moroney, James V.; Moseley, Jeffrey; Napoli, Carolyn; Nedelcu, Aurora M.; Niyogi, Krishna; Novoselov, Sergey V.; Paulsen, Ian T.; Pazour, Greg; Purton, Saul; Ral, Jean-Philippe; RiaÃ±o-PachÃ³n, Diego Mauricio; Riekhof, Wayne; Rymarquis, Linda; Schroda, Michael; Stern, David; Umen, James; Willows, Robert; Wilson, Nedra; Zimmer, Sara Lana; Allmer, Jens; Balk, Janneke; Bisova, Katerina; Chen, Chong-Jian; Elias, Marek; Gendler, Karla; Hauser, Charles; Lamb, Mary Rose; Ledford, Heidi; Long, Joanne C.; Minagawa, Jun; Page, M.

It is a model system for studying chloroplast-based photosynthesis, as well as the structure, assembly, and function of eukaryotic flagella (cilia), which were inherited from the common ancestor of plants and animals, but lost in land plants. We sequenced the â¼120-megabase nuclear genome of Chlamydomonas and performed comparative phylogenomic analyses, identifying genes encoding uncharacterized proteins that are likely associated with the function and biogenesis of chloroplasts or eukaryotic flagella. Analyses of the Chlamydomonas genome advance our understanding of the ancestral eukaryotic cell, reveal previously unknown genes associated with photosynthetic and flagellar functions, and establish links between ciliopathy and the composition and function of flagella.

Maintaining photosynthetic efficiency under changing light conditions requires modification of light-harvesting and energy-transfer processes. In the current study, we examined how green algae regulate their light-harvesting functions in response to different light qualities. We measured low-temperature time-resolved fluorescence spectra of unicellular green algae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and Chlorella variabilis cells grown under different light qualities. By observing the delayed fluorescence spectra, we demonstrated that both types of green algae primarily modified the associations between light-harvesting chlorophyll protein complexes (LHCs) and PSs (PSII and PSI). Under blue light, Chlamydomonas transferred more energy from LHC to chlorophyll (Chl) located far from the PSII reaction center, while energy was transferred from LHC to PSI via different energy-transfer pathways in Chlorella. Under green light, both green algae exhibited enhanced energy transfer from LHCs to both PSs. Red light induced fluorescence quenching within PSs in Chlamydomonas and LHCs in Chlorella. In Chlorella, energy transfer from PSII to PSI appears to play an important role in balancing excitation between PSII and PSI.\n\nCloning and characterization of d-threonine aldolase from the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii.\n\nPubMed\n\nHirato, Yuki; Tokuhisa, Mayumi; Tanigawa, Minoru; Ashida, Hiroyuki; Tanaka, Hiroyuki; Nishimura, Katsushi\n\n2017-03-01\n\nd-Threonine aldolase (DTA) catalyzes the pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP)-dependent interconversion of d-threonine and glycine plus acetaldehyde. The enzyme is a powerful tool for the stereospecific synthesis of various Î²-hydroxy amino acids in synthetic organic chemistry. In this study, DTA from the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii was discovered and characterized, representing the first report to describe the existence of eukaryotic DTA. DTA was overexpressed in recombinant Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) cells; the specific activity of the enzyme in the cell-free extract was 0.8 U/mg. The recombinant enzyme was purified to homogeneity by ammonium sulfate fractionation, DEAE-Sepharose, and Mono Q column chromatographies (purified enzyme 7.0 U/mg). For the cleavage reaction, the optimal temperature and pH were 70Â Â°C and pH 8.4, respectively. The enzyme demonstrated 90% of residual activity at 50Â Â°C for 1Â h. The enzyme catalyzed the synthesis of d- and d-allo threonine from a mixture of glycine and acetaldehyde (the diastereomer excess of d-threonine was 18%). DTA was activated by several divalent metal ions, including manganese, and was inhibited by PLP enzyme inhibitors and metalloenzyme inhibitors. Copyright Â© 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

A new mutualism between Chlamydomonas and methylobacteria facilitates growth on amino acids and peptides.\n\nPubMed\n\nCalatrava, Victoria; Hom, Erik F Y; Llamas, Ãngel; FernÃ¡ndez, Emilio; GalvÃ¡n, Aurora\n\n2018-04-01\n\nNitrogen is a key nutrient for land plants and phytoplankton in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. The model alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii can grow efficiently on several inorganic nitrogen sources (e.g. ammonium, nitrate, nitrite) as well as many amino acids. In this study, we show that Chlamydomonas is unable to use proline, hydroxyproline and peptides that contain these amino acids. However, we discovered that algal growth on these substrates is supported in association with Methylobacterium spp., and that a mutualistic carbon-nitrogen metabolic exchange between Chlamydomonas and Methylobacterium spp. is established. Specifically, the mineralization of these amino acids and peptides by Methylobacterium spp. produces ammonium that can be assimilated by Chlamydomonas, and CO2 photosynthetically fixed by Chlamydomonas yields glycerol that can be assimilated by Methylobacterium. As Chlamydomonas is an algal ancestor to land plants and Methylobacterium is a plant growth-promoting bacterium, this new model of mutualism may facilitate insights into the ecology and evolution of plant-bacterial interactions and design principles of synthetic ecology.\n\nSexual reproduction and sex determination in green algae.\n\nPubMed\n\nSekimoto, Hiroyuki\n\n2017-05-01\n\nThe sexual reproductive processes of some representative freshwater green algae are reviewed. Chlamydomonas reinhardtii is a unicellular volvocine alga having two mating types: mating type plus (mt + ) and mating type minus (mt - ), which are controlled by a single, complex mating-type locus. Sexual adhesion between the gametes is mediated by sex-specific agglutinin molecules on their flagellar membranes. Cell fusion is initiated by an adhesive interaction between the mt + and mt - mating structures, followed by localized membrane fusion. The loci of sex-limited genes and the conformation of sex-determining regions have been rearranged during the evolution of volvocine algae; however, the essential function of the sex-determining genes of the isogamous unicellular Chlamydomonas reinhardtii is conserved in the multicellular oogamous Volvox carteri. The sexual reproduction of the unicellular charophycean alga, Closterium peracerosum-strigosum-littorale complex, is also focused on here. The sexual reproductive processes of heterothallic strains are controlled by two multifunctional sex pheromones, PR-IP and PR-IP Inducer, which independently promote multiple steps in conjugation at the appropriate times through different induction mechanisms. The molecules involved in sexual reproduction and sex determination have also been characterized.\n\nThe Chlamydomonas genome project: a decade on\n\nPubMed Central\n\nBlaby, Ian K.; Blaby-Haas, Crysten; Tourasse, Nicolas; Hom, Erik F.

Chlamydomonas has a number of advantages for this approach, including genetic controls that are not generally available with industrial algae. The Bti toxin has been used for mosquito control for > 30 years and does not engender resistance; it contains three Cry proteins, Cry4Aa (135 kDa), Cry4Ba (128 kDa) and Cry11Aa (72 kDa), and Cyt1Aa (25 kDa). To express the Cry proteins in the chloroplast, the three genes were resynthesized and cry4Aa was truncated to the first 700 amino acids (cry4Aa700); also, since they can be toxic to host cells, the inducible Cyc6:Nac2-psbD expression system was used. Western blots of total protein from the chloroplast transformants showed accumulation of the intact polypeptides, and the relative expression level was Cry11Aa > Cry4Aa700 > Cry4Ba. Quantitative western blots with purified Cry11Aa as a standard showed that Cry11Aa accumulated to 0.35% of total cell protein. Live cell bioassays in dH20 demonstrated toxicity of the cry4Aa700 and cry11Aa transformants to larvae of Aedes aegypti and Culex quinquefasciatus. These results demonstrate that the Cry proteins that are most toxic to Aedes and Culex mosquitoes, Cry4Aa and Cry11Aa, can be successfully expressed in the chloroplast of Chlamydomonas.

M.; Black, B.; Dunton, K. H.; von Biela, V. R.\n\n2017-12-01\n\nThe Chukchi Sea is one of the most productive Arctic seas in the world. Around 10% of its net primary production originates from sea ice algae, much of which falls ungrazed to a relatively shallow (40-50m) shelf. The chlorophyll a derived from sinking ice algae is thought to supports a robust macrobenthic faunal community, dominated by bivalves, which in turn supports higher trophic organisms such as Pacific walrus (Odibenus rosmarus divergens), and bearded seal (Erignathus barbatus). However, recent reductions in ice extent and thickness could shift primary production from under-ice to open-water environment, thus reducing ice algal production and delivery to benthic biota. We used stable isotope analyses on benthic bivalve samples, collected in summer between 2002 and 2015, to identify contributions of ice algal production to benthic organisms and track their spatial and temporal variations. Ice algae contributions were indicated by Î´13C values in bivalves, as ice algae are isotopically heavy compared to phytoplankton and would be reflected in consumers. This 14-yr period was marked by an 8%, decrease in Arctic ice extent, which was especially pronounced and spatially variable in the Chukchi Sea. We examined variability in the Î´13C values in the common bivalves Astarte spp., Ennucula tenuis and Macoma spp. over space and time using one-way ANOVAs with Bonferroni correction to consider the potential for variation in ice algae contributions. All bivalve Î´13C values were within a range (-21.84â° to -17.62â°) that suggests some ice algal contribution. Among stations, E. tenuis and Astarte spp. did not significantly differ in their individual Î´13C values. In contrast, Macoma spp. had significantly enriched Î´13C values at one station south of Point Hope (Î´13C = -17.75â°, F5,8 = 1.211, P < 0.05) in 2015. There were no significant (P > 0.05) differences in Î´13C values from year to year for samples pooled across stations within a taxon.

Inoculation of azolla medium with Chlamydomonas sp. was associated with decreased nitrogenase activity in A. filiculoides and with increases in the density of a fungal population identified as Acremonium sp. Subsequent inoculation of azolla medium with this fungus was also accompanied by a significant decrease in nitrogenase activity of A. filiculoides. However, the extent of depression of nitrogenase activity was significantly higher when azolla medium was inoculated with Chlamydomonas sp. than when it was inoculated with Acremonium sp. Inoculation of nitrogen-free Stanier medium with either Acremonium sp. or Chlamydomonas sp. did not adversely affect the growth or nitrogenase activity of free-living A. azollae. Decreased nitrogenase activity in A. filiculoides is apparently related to the adverse influence of the green alga and the fungus on the macrosymbiont. The mechanisms that might be involved are discussed.

J.; Landy, J. C.; Delaforge, A.; Michel, C.; Rysgaard, S.\n\n2016-12-01\n\nSea ice algae are a characteristic feature in ice-covered seas, contributing a significant fraction of the total primary production in many areas and providing a concentrated food source of high nutritional value to grazers in the spring. Algae respond to physical changes in the sea ice environment by modifying their cellular carbon, nitrogen and pigment content, and by adjusting their photophysiological characteristics. In this study we examined how the ratios of particulate organic carbon (POC) to nitrogen (PON), and POC to chlorophyll a (chl a), responded to the evolving snow-covered sea ice environment near Cambridge Bay, Nunavut, during spring 2014. We also estimated photosynthesis-irradiance (PI) curves using oxygen-optodes and evaluated the resulting time-series of PI parameters under thin and thick snow-covered sites. There were no significant differences in PI parameters between samples from different overlying snow depths, and only the maximum photosynthetic rates in the absence of photoinhibition (PsB) and photoacclimation (IS) parameters changed significantly over the spring bloom. Furthermore, we found that both these parameters increased over time in response to increasing percent transmission of photosynthetically active radiation (TPAR) through the ice, indicating that light was a limiting factor of photosynthesis and was an important driver of temporal (over the spring) rather than spatial (between snow depths) variability in photophysiological response. However, we note that spatial variability in primary production was evident. Higher TPAR over the spring and under thin snow affected the composition of algae over both time and space, causing greater POC:chl a estimates in late spring and under thin snow cover. Nitrogen limitation was pronounced in this study, likely reducing PsB and algal photosynthetic rates, and increasing POC:PON ratios to over six times the Redfield average. Our results highlight the influence of both light and nutrients on\n\nActivation of Autophagy by Metals in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii.\n\nPubMed\n\nPÃ©rez-MartÃ­n, Marta; Blaby-Haas, Crysten E; PÃ©rez-PÃ©rez, MarÃ­a Esther; AndrÃ©s-Garrido, AscensiÃ³n; Blaby, Ian K; Merchant, Sabeeha S; Crespo, JosÃ© L\n\n2015-09-01\n\nAutophagy is an intracellular self-degradation pathway by which eukaryotic cells recycle their own material in response to specific stress conditions. Exposure to high concentrations of metals causes cell damage, although the effect of metal stress on autophagy has not been explored in photosynthetic organisms. In this study, we investigated the effect of metal excess on autophagy in the model unicellular green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. We show in cells treated with nickel an upregulation of ATG8 that is independent of CRR1, a global regulator of copper signaling in Chlamydomonas. A similar effect on ATG8 was observed with copper and cobalt but not with cadmium or mercury ions. Transcriptome sequencing data revealed an increase in the abundance of the protein degradation machinery, including that responsible for autophagy, and a substantial overlap of that increased abundance with the hydrogen peroxide response in cells treated with nickel ions. Thus, our results indicate that metal stress triggers autophagy in Chlamydomonas and suggest that excess nickel may cause oxidative damage, which in turn activates degradative pathways, including autophagy, to clear impaired components and recover cellular homeostasis.

In addition to phytoplankton, sea ice supports a significant amount of ice algae, the essential primary producers for the ecosystem in winter and early spring. While sea ice habitat declines on regional scales, the fate of sea ice algae post-ice melt remains relatively unknown, despite its importance in understanding how the biological pump might be affected by sea ice loss. Through a series of settling column experiments on the icebreaker Nathaniel B. Palmer, we aimed to address the question: What controls the fate of the carbon-rich ice algae across the Western Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) during ice melt? We focused on whether species composition affects the sinking potential of ice algal communities. Using FlowCAM imagery, we classified samples collected from the buoyant, neutral, and negatively buoyant portions of the settling columns into genus-level taxonomic classes. We used image parameters and geometric shape equations to calculate the biovolume of each taxonomic group. We further explored relationships between taxa-specific sinking potentials, environmental parameters (temperature and nutrients), and physiological properties of associated algal communities (as described by Fast Rate Repetition fluorometry). Results indicate that colonial Phaeocystis antarctica tends to dominate lower regions of the settling column. Moreover, we observe strong correlations between geographic location and both nutrients and phytoplankton physiology. We found that these three factors are indeed related to taxa-specific buoyancy and sinking indices. An understanding of these relationships sheds more light on the role P. antarctica (a carbon-rich bloom-forming genus) plays in the biological pump; higher sinking rates suggest greater carbon export to depth, while lower sinking rates increase the likelihood of carbon being respired back\n\nChlamydomonas reinhardtii PsbS Protein Is Functional and Accumulates Rapidly and Transiently under High Light.\n\nPubMed\n\nTibiletti, Tania; Auroy, Pascaline; Peltier, Gilles; Caffarri, Stefano\n\n2016-08-01\n\nPhotosynthetic organisms must respond to excess light in order to avoid photo-oxidative stress. In plants and green algae the fastest response to high light is non-photochemical quenching (NPQ), a process that allows the safe dissipation of the excess energy as heat. This phenomenon is triggered by the low luminal pH generated by photosynthetic electron transport. In vascular plants the main sensor of the low pH is the PsbS protein, while in the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii LhcSR proteins appear to be exclusively responsible for this role. Interestingly, Chlamydomonas also possesses two PsbS genes, but so far the PsbS protein has not been detected and its biological function is unknown. Here, we reinvestigated the kinetics of gene expression and PsbS and LhcSR3 accumulation in Chlamydomonas during high light stress. We found that, unlike LhcSR3, PsbS accumulates very rapidly but only transiently. In order to determine the role of PsbS in NPQ and photoprotection in Chlamydomonas, we generated transplastomic strains expressing the algal or the Arabidopsis psbS gene optimized for plastid expression. Both PsbS proteins showed the ability to increase NPQ in Chlamydomonas wild-type and npq4 (lacking LhcSR3) backgrounds, but no clear photoprotection activity was observed. Quantification of PsbS and LhcSR3 in vivo indicates that PsbS is much less abundant than LhcSR3 during high light stress. Moreover, LhcSR3, unlike PsbS, also accumulates during other stress conditions. The possible role of PsbS in photoprotection is discussed. Â© 2016 American Society of Plant Biologists.

To test whether similar UV-B perception mechanisms exist in the evolutionarily distant green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, we identified Chlamydomonas orthologs of UVR8 and the key signaling factor CONSTITUTIVELY PHOTOMORPHOGENIC1 (COP1). Cr-UVR8 shares sequence and structural similarity to Arabidopsis thaliana UVR8, has conserved tryptophan residues for UV-B photoreception, monomerizes upon UV-B exposure, and interacts with Cr-COP1 in a UV-B-dependent manner. Moreover, Cr-UVR8 can interact with At-COP1 and complement the Arabidopsis uvr8 mutant, demonstrating that it is a functional UV-B photoreceptor. Chlamydomonas shows apparent UV-B acclimation in colony survival and photosynthetic efficiency assays. UV-B exposure, at low levels that induce acclimation, led to broad changes in the Chlamydomonas transcriptome, including in genes related to photosynthesis. Impaired UV-B-induced activation in the Cr-COP1 mutant hit1 indicates that UVR8-COP1 signaling induces transcriptome changes in response to UV-B. Also, hit1 mutants are impaired in UV-B acclimation. Chlamydomonas UV-B acclimation preserved the photosystem II core proteins D1 and D2 under UV-B stress, which mitigated UV-B-induced photoinhibition. These findings highlight the early evolution of UVR8 photoreceptor signaling in the green lineage to induce UV-B acclimation and protection.

Knowing that uranium alters photosynthesis via impairment of the water photo-oxidation process, we determined whether pulse amplitude modulated (PAM) fluorometry was a relevant tool for assessing the impact of uranium on the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and investigated how and to what extent uranium hampered photosynthetic performance. Photosynthetic activity and quenching were assessed from fluorescence induction curves generated by PAM fluorometry, after 1 and 5h of uranium exposure in controlled conditions. The oxygen-evolving complex (OEC) of PSII was identified as the primary action site of uranium, through alteration of the water photo-oxidation process as revealed by F0/Fv. Limiting re-oxidation of the plastoquinone pool, uranium impaired the electron flux between the photosystems until almost complete inhibition of the PSII quantum efficiency ( [Formula: see text] , EC50=303 Â± 64 Î¼g UL(-1) after 5h of exposure) was observed. Non-photochemical quenching (qN) was identified as the most sensitive fluorescence parameter (EC50=142 Â± 98 Î¼g UL(-1) after 5h of exposure), indicating that light energy not used in photochemistry was dissipated in non-radiative processes. It was shown that parameters which stemmed from fluorescence induction kinetics are valuable indicators for evaluating the impact of uranium on PSII in green algae. PAM fluorometry provided a rapid and reasonably sensitive method for assessing stress response to uranium in microalgae. Copyright Â© 2013 Elsevier B.V.

In plants and green algae the fastest response to high light is non-photochemical quenching (NPQ), a process that allows the safe dissipation of the excess energy as heat. This phenomenon is triggered by the low luminal pH generated by photosynthetic electron transport. In vascular plants the main sensor of the"
