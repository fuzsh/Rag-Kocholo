Carefully designed for undergraduate students, through twelve chapters this book offers an introduction to the origins and international context of the French Revolution as well as an in-depth examination of the reasons why war began. Aspects unpicked within the book include how France acquired a de facto empire stretching from Holland to Naples; the impact of French conquest on the areas concerned; the spread of French ideas beyond the frontiers of the French imperium; the response of the powers of Europe to the sudden expansion in French military power; the experience of the conflicts unleashed by the French Revolution in such areas as the West Indies, Egypt and India; and the impact of war on the Revolution itself. Offering extensive geographical coverage and challenging many preconceived ideas, The Wars of the French Revolution, 1792–1801 is the perfect resource for students of the French Revolution and international military history more broadly. Charles J. Esdaile has been a member of staff in the Department of History at the University of Liverpool, UK, since 1989. He was awarded a personal chair in 2004.

The text provides the student and teacher alike with what is probably the most solid synthesis of the period around. It is bound to become set reading on any course on Napoleon and Europe.’ (European History Quarterly) Spain in the Liberal Age: From Constitution to Civil War, 1808–1939 ‘A masterly work of synthesis, full of judicious assessment, outspoken at times and authoritative in tone . . . Esdaile strikes a fine balance between narrative and thematic analysis, blending the two in a complex logical argument, creating coherence out of apparent confusion.’ (Times Literary Supplement) The French Wars ‘Esdaile’s work is not simply a chronological cataloguing of European conflicts, but a reassessment of popular conceptions of French nationalism and the Napoleonic myth . . . The scope . . . provokes the reader to re-examine his or her own perceptions of the French campaigns and their impact on the transformation of Europe.’ (The French Review) Napoleon’s Wars: An International History, 1803–1815 ‘Esdaile assesses the latest scholarship with expertise and insight while keeping his scholarly apparatus to a commendable fifty pages. The book is written in a lucid and engaging style that keeps the pages turning. Napoleon’s Wars will be a standard text for students and general readers for years to come.’ (Times Higher)\n\nPeninsular Eyewitnesses: The Human Experience of War in Spain and Portugal, 1808–1814 ‘An impressive introduction to the wider reality of the war in the Peninsula, this work weaves together eyewitness accounts from both sides of the conflict . . . It is Esdaile’s use of both the military and civilian sources which makes this book such a thought-provoking read. Highly recommended.’ (The Waterloo Journal) Outpost of Empire ‘Outpost of Empire is a thought-provoking study of French policy in a conquered land and how the Spanish dealt with it on the local level. In many ways it shatters accepted beliefs on French arrogance in their rule and Spanish resistance to it. It a must-read for all interested in the Peninsular War.’ (The Napoleon Series) Women in the Peninsular War ‘This is a fine book, well-informed and thoroughly documented – 80 pages of notes and bibliography testify to substantial archival research as well as a thorough review of the secondary literature. It is also more imaginatively conceived than other works on the subject . . . It should remain the last word . . . for a long time to come.’ (Journal of Military History) Napoleon, France and Waterloo: The Eagle Rejected ‘In the years after Waterloo, France forgot the mess that existed in 1814 and 1815, and embraced the Napoleonic legend. It was a legend which remembered the years 1805 to 1813, with Ligny tacked on the end, and one which was purely nationalist, and military in sentiment. The Eagle Rejected is the most revealing work on the French ‘home front’ in the last years of the Empire and highly recommended.’ (The Napoleon Series)\n\nFor Alan Forrest, friend, mentor and inspiration\n\nContents\n\nList of maps x Preface xi 1 The origins of the French Revolutionary Wars\n\n1\n\n2 The armies of the ancien régime 35 3 From the Bastille to Valmy\n\n63\n\n4 Saving the Revolution\n\n92\n\n5 Exporting the Revolution\n\n120\n\n6 Sympathy, admiration and collaboration\n\n148\n\n7 Resistance and revolt (1): France\n\n180\n\n8 Resistance and revolt (2): the French imperium\n\n201\n\n9 The reaction of the ancien régime 228 10 The wider world\n\n249\n\n11 The road to 18 Brumaire\n\n276\n\n12 The end of the French Revolutionary Wars\n\n295\n\nBibliographical note 324 Index 327\n\nList of maps\n\n1 Europe in 1789 2 Europe in 1799\n\nxiv xv\n\nPreface\n\nIt is not going too far to say that the French Revolutionary Wars of 1792–1801 constitute one of the poor relations of history. Despite the fact that they were a titanic struggle that has often been portrayed as the first total war and, if not that, then at least the first ideological war, they have been doubly over shadowed. Thus, on the one hand, political, social and cultural historians have primarily wanted to write about the events of the French Revolution and their echoes in other countries, while, on the other, military ones have tended to be mesmerised by the figure of Napoleon Bonaparte and have in consequence all too often looked only at those battles in which the then General Bonaparte was personally involved. The Wars of the French Revolution, however, will take a very different form in that it will place war at the centre of its coverage while at the same time seeking to ensure that it does not degenerate into mere narrative: the Italian Campaign of 1796–97, the Egyptian campaign of 1798–1801 and the battle of Marengo will all be included, certainly, but so, among other episodes, will the fighting in Belgium in 1793–94, the Russo-Polish War of 1794, the struggle for the ‘sugar islands’ of the Caribbean, the Irish rebellion of 1798, the AngloRussian invasion of Holland in 1799 and, finally, the great Austro-Russian counter-offensive that temporarily drove the French from their conquests in Italy and thereby helped pave the way for the coup of 18 Brumaire. Yet, not least because in Tim Blanning’s excellent The French Revolutionary Wars such a work already exists, The Wars of the French Revolution will not just be a military history: international relations will also necessarily be present, together with extensive discussions of the social and political impact of war and of France’s attempts to make use of new ideologies in pursuit of traditional geo-political aspirations (or, as some would say, share the benefits of the Revolution with the peoples of Europe). In short, what is envisaged is a global history that will cater to a wide range of interests in a way that has never yet been attempted. That said, there are a number of issues that have been omitted from this work. Of these, the first is anything more than the barest details of the French Revolution itself. It is the hope of the author that enough has been said to convey a nodding acquaintance with its chronology and dramatis personae, but to engage with the subject in all its complexity would result in a book perhaps twice the length even of the current rather bulky volume. Nor, meanwhile, would the result be very good: the author is not a French specialist and would not dream of competing with names as revered as those of Richard Cobb, Alan Forrest and William Doyle: if something more is required in this respect, then the reader will find plenty of options available elsewhere. Less understandable, perhaps, is the other obvious gap in its coverage, namely the absence of any significant treatment of women. This is most certainly not because of want of interest in the subject on the part of the author – his Women in the Peninsular War (Norman, Oklahoma, 2014) is surely evidence of\n\nxii Preface at the very least his good intentions in this respect – but of the simple fact that the French Revolutionary Wars affected the general position of women in European society very little and were in turn participated in by them in a very traditional fashion. Such a comment will doubtless not be popular in certain quarters, and therefore requires elaboration. In the first place, there is the issue of political participation. In the Europe of 1789, if one discounts such figures as Maria Theresa of Austria and Catherine the Great of Russia, women were just beginning to take their first steps in the world of political debate while there was also a growing tradition of female authorship, and all the more so given that the institution of the salon provided a forum in which they could learn to express ideas and immerse themselves in the discussions of the day. Yet such opportunities were almost entirely restricted to the élite while the number of women who actually secured a voice was tinier still. In the France of the Revolution, things were a little better, perhaps, but even then, for every Olympe de Gouges and Madame Roland, there were a hundred or more such women whose role remained wholly private. A few more names can be found being drawn to political action by circumstance or conviction – one thinks here of Madame de la Rochejacquelin, Charlotte Corday or Marie-Anne Paulze, the wife of the chemist, Lavoisier – but in the end the list is very small, while elsewhere it is all but non-existent, being constituted by little more than Elizabeth Wollstonecroft and Eleonora de Fonseca Pimentel. At a lower level, things were slightly different. For a variety of reasons, not the least of which because the authorities were generally inclined to take a more lenient line in dealing with female malefactors than they were with male ones, women had always taken a leading role in such events as bread riots. It is therefore no surprise to find women playing a prominent role in those disturbances that regularly rocked France in the Revolutionary epoch nor, still less, that a tiny handful, of whom the most important were Pauline Léon, Claire Lacombe and Théroigne de Méricourt, emerged from obscurity to become, if not major figures in the milieu of Parisian radicalism, then at least recognisable political personalities and, what is more, early champions of the cause of feminism, something in which they were joined by Olympe de Gouges. Women, then, were certainly active participants in the French Revolution, but that does not mean that they secured acceptance in its ranks. On the contrary, once the Montagnards had come to power, Charlotte’s assassination of Marat was used as a pretext to move against them: thus, Olympe de Gouges was guillotined, Léon, Lacombe and Méricourt thrown into prison and such all-female political clubs as had emerged in the course of the Revolution swept away. As for the legal gains made by women since 1789, these were lost in the wake of 18 Brumaire, the later Civil Code putting them back in their traditional place with a vengeance. What, though, of the war effort? In so far as this was concerned, Olympe de Gouges and others certainly floated the idea of forming women’s battalions, but no such units ever appeared, and, apart from a number, almost certainly very small indeed, of women who hid their identity and became ‘cross-dressers’ – whether on the side of the French or their opponents – the only way in which women marched to war in the campaigns of 1792–1802 was as camp-followers. As in Spain and Portugal in the years after 1808 – a subject to which the current author has given much attention – the universal presence of the camp-follower very probably created opportunities of which individual women were able to make use as a means of effecting a change in their personal circumstances. But this remains a hidden history as, for that matter, does the experience of women who never moved beyond their home environments: we meet them as victims and, very occasionally, spies, but otherwise we can\n\nPreface xiii do little more than guess. Yet of one thing we can be certain and that is that the French Revolutionary Wars neither attracted wholesale female participation of a non-traditional kind nor created a new world for the women of Europe, and in a book of this nature it is therefore difficult to justify more than the most minimal treatment of the subject. To write thus is to denigrate neither women nor the cause of women’s history: indeed, it is rather the author’s most earnest hope that his words will serve as an encouragement to others to pick up the torch, even if they are inspired to do so by nothing more than anger. Meanwhile, it is not just in this area that more work is needed. Even now, there are many parts of Europe whose experience of the French Revolutionary Wars has not yet been explored or, at least, not in the English language. Above all, what is needed here is a study of the Habsburg monarchy in the Revolutionary and, indeed, Napoleonic epoch. In the whole range of the historiography, there is no greater want than this, and, until such a work is written, historians like the current author whose languages come to a grinding halt at the Rhine will never be able to do more than scrape the surface of a part of Europe which experienced the French Revolutionary Wars at a level of intensity second only to that of Britain and, of course, France herself. With other areas clearly in need of attention in the Englishlanguage historiography, including Belgium, Switzerland and Poland, there is clearly plenty of scope for young scholars who can raise their sights beyond the French Revolution per se and at the same time ignore the siren voice of ‘memory’, a genre of historiography for whose absence from these pages no apology is made whatsoever. At length, then, I come to the words that really are the most important in any book. In this respect, the people I need to mention are numerous: first of all, Laura Pilsworth, for believing in this project when few other people appeared to do so; second, the staff at all the libraries whose doors I have so repeatedly darkened, including, most especially, Marc Brans at the Royal Army Museum in Brussels and Catherine McManamon of the Sydney Jones Library at the University of Liverpool; third, Rory Muir, Zack White, Mark Lawrence, Rick Schneid, Rafe Blaufarb, Alan Forrest and Philip Dwyer, friends and colleagues who have advised, encouraged and, in the nicest possible way, criticised; fourth, my family, especially my poor and most long-suffering Alison; and, fifth, last but by no means least, my wonderful students – should anyone who took ‘War, Nationalism and Society in Europe, 1792–1801’ chance to pick up this work, know that you are each and every one of you remembered with gratitude and affection.

The French Revolutionary Wars were not a struggle between liberty on the one hand and tyranny on the other. They were not, indeed, wholly about the French Revolution at all: with considerable justice, indeed, Tim Blanning has gone so far as to argue that they did not break out in 1792, but rather two years before the fall of the Bastille, the cause being the great crisis that erupted in 1787 in eastern Europe. According to this scenario, war preceded the revolution and not the other way about (indeed, one could almost even go so far as to argue – though the current author would not do so – that the most important event in the international history of Europe in the last fifteen years of the eighteenth century was not the French Revolution of 1789, but rather the Polish Revolution of 1791). This, of, course, does not mean that ideology played no role in the spread of conflict: on various occasions, in fact, it intensified tension. But the chief cause of trouble it was not, whilst the diplomatic history of the 1790s (and, indeed, the 1800s) suggests that few of the great powers of Europe had any problems with the concept of peace with France, nor even an alliance with her. Nor did the 1790s bring any real change in the aims of the great powers, who in each case pursued goals that would have comprehensible to rulers of fifty or even one hundred years before. This should not be taken to mean that these goals were fixed. Every state at one time or another had choices to make in terms of their priorities and partners, or felt that it had no option but to sacrifice one goal in favour of another. Much the same was true of the structures within which they operated: the dynamic of international relations in Europe altered very considerably over the course of the eighteenth century and continued to change after 1789. But until 1800, at least, and possibly even a decade later, the general range of those choices remained substantially the same, the implication being, of course, that the French Revolution did not suddenly engage the exclusive attention of every ancien-régime chancellory and ministry of war. To quote George Rudé, then, the struggle of 1792–1801 ‘was not, and . . . never became, a straightforward crusade of the crowned heads of Europe against Revolutionary France’.1 One might with some justice go well beyond this. Not, in fact, till 1814 did the powers finally set aside their differences and concentrate all their forces and energies in a fight to the finish with Napoleon.2 But to discuss this issue would clearly be to go far beyond the remit of the current volume. For the time being, our priority must rather be to examine the eighteenth-century context. In brief, this was very much that of an age of conflict. For over a hundred years before 1789, indeed, there had hardly been a year when the whole of Europe had been at peace. Why this was so is again a question that need not detain us here for too long. However, in brief, for all the monarchies of Europe, the battlefield was at one and the same time a gauge of their power and a theatre for their glorification, and, by extension, an important means of legitimising their power at home, where they were frequently\n\n2 The origins of the French Revolutionary Wars challenged by feudal aristocracies and powerful religious hierarchies. Meanwhile, war bred more war. To some extent, the ever-greater demands which it imposed – for the eighteenth century was an age when armies and navies grew steadily bigger and more demanding in terms of their equipment – could be financed by internal reform. Hence the ‘enlightened absolutism’ which was so characteristic of the period from 1750 to 1789 and beyond, not to mention the efforts of both Britain and Spain to exploit their American colonies more effectively. But a variety of problems, including not least the resistance of traditional élites – a factor that could in itself generate armed conflict – meant that there were only limited advantages to be derived from such solutions, and thus it was that most rulers looked at one time or another to territorial gains on their frontiers or the acquisition of fresh colonies. This, of course, implied war in Europe (which given its cost in turn implied territorial gain or at the very least financial compensation). No major state would ever have agreed to relinquish even the smallest province voluntarily, and, whilst the weaker ones could sometimes be overawed into doing so, a unilateral gain for one monarch was not acceptable to any of the others: for, say, Sweden to have been allowed to take over Norway, Russia would have expected to take over a slice of Poland or the Ottoman Empire. Nor was this an end to the problem. To go to war successfully, it was necessary to possess allies, and allies in turn expected to be paid for their services, either in money or in land. As this, of course, set off a fresh chain of demands for compensation, so the problem could rarely be confined to one part of Europe or another, many of the conflicts of the eighteenth century turning into truly continental affairs that drew in states from Portugal to Russia and from Sweden to Sicily. Nor, by the same token, could any peace settlement ever be definitive. Thus, no war was ever fought with the aim of obtaining total victory: aside from the question of cost, no dynastic monarch would ever have sought to beggar another altogether, if only because the ruler concerned might prove a useful ally in the next crisis. Yet this in turn meant that the loser of any conflict was almost always in a position to seek to overturn the result of one war by seeking victory in another, and thus a game that was essentially pointless continued to fascinate and mesmerise.3 Many factors, then, conspired to make war endemic in eighteenth-century Europe. However, still worse was the fact that the pressures that led to conflict were increasing. Not the least of these was a change that was beginning to take place in the structure of international relations. Thus, very, very gradually, foreign policy was moving from being an affair of dynasties to being an affair of nations. This development must not be exaggerated: indeed, it affected only a few states and made limited progress even in them. Yet, for all that, it cannot be completely ignored. In a very vague and general sense it was everywhere understood that there ought to be a connection between foreign policy and the well-being of the subject, but in most cases little more than lip-service was paid to the idea, whilst there was no sense that the populace had a right either to be consulted on the issue of war or peace or to expect concrete benefits in the event of victory. In short, the peoples of Europe were mere pawns who were to be mobilised or called to endure suffering exactly as their rulers thought fit. Starting in England in the seventeenth century, however, a new pattern started to emerge in that we see the first stirrings of political awakening, if not emancipation: as early as the 1620s, for example, Charles I caused outrage amongst his subjects by failing to intervene effectively in favour of the Protestant cause in the Thirty Years War. This process having everywhere come on by leaps and bounds by 1789, as Black says, ‘In all states public opinion had to be taken into account by government and political figures.’4 However, whilst by no means unimportant, these issues were outweighed by other more pressing matters. Particularly for the eastern powers, there was the rising cost of their\n\nThe origins of the French Revolutionary Wars 3 military establishments. As the eighteenth century advanced, so their armies increased in size: Russia and Prussia both more than doubled the size of their armies between 1700 and 1789, whilst Austria was not far behind. Whereas what had mattered in the early part of the century had been dynastic prestige and, in particular, the question of which of the reigning families should rule the many states that were bedevilled by succession crises, beginning with Frederick II of Prussia’s invasion of Silesia in 1740, what mattered now was rather territory. Conquest, indeed, was essential, and because this was the case all considerations of legality and morality began to go by the board, all that mattered being increasingly raison d’état. But so long as all the major states in Europe were playing the same game, it was held (at least by many of their rulers and statesmen) that universal conquest brought with it universal good. The weaker states of the Continent would suffer, certainly, but as none of the great powers would lose out in relation to one another, the net result would be a balance of power that made for general security. To put it another way, conquest was a moral duty from which all would benefit, and war, by extension, an act of benevolence. Meanwhile, it was also less threatening than before. In 1789 the standing armies of Europe may have been much bigger than they had been in 1700, but new crops, better transport, improved bureaucracies, more productive fiscal systems, harsher discipline and tighter procedures in the field all ensured that the horrors of the Thirty Years War, in which masses of unpaid men had simply surged from one side of Germany to the other, living off the country and denying the authority of political masters that had lost all ability to pay and supply them, would not be repeated. At the same time, it would also be less costly in another sense. Thanks to developments in the art of generalship, it was assumed that battle would be less frequent. Enemy armies would be manoeuvred out of their positions, and, their commanders, as products of an age of reason, would tamely accept the logic of their position and march away, leaving their opponents to march in unopposed. If battles could largely be avoided, sieges, too, would become less of an endurance test, for it was widely accepted that once a fortress had had its walls breached, its governor would capitulate without further resistance so as to save the lives of both the townsfolk and his men.5 Or so it seemed. In reality, much of this, of course, was so much nonsense. Given that every possible territorial solution that could be worked out for the continent of Europe was bound to upset one or other of the great powers, continual conquest would lead not to perpetual peace but rather perpetual war and therefore produce not security but insecurity. As the Seven Years War had shown, as the stakes grew ever higher, so rulers with their backs against the wall would habitually resort to battle rather than simply accepting the logic of superior numbers or generalship, just as they would be inclined to put fortress governors under great pressure to resist the enemy to the utmost: it was, after all, this very conflict that gave rise to the phrase pour encourager les autres. As the War of the Bavarian Succession of 1778–9 had shown, late eighteenth-century regular armies were much less likely than those, say, of the War of the Spanish Succession to be able to pull off the sort of feats of manoeuvre that would have been required to decide the issue of wars without a battle. And there was certainly no diminution in the sufferings which war meant for the civilian population nor in the damage which an army’s passage could inflict on a district. On the wilder fringes of warfare – the Balkans, the frontiers of the American colonies – torture and massacre were very much the order of the day, whilst large parts of Germany had been devastated by the Seven Years War. The overall picture, indeed, is a grim one: war may not have been the monster of the seventeenth century, but it was still a savage beast.6 Of this many rulers and statesmen were well aware, and a few even tried to back away from the traditional power game.\n\n4 The origins of the French Revolutionary Wars But in the end, they were helpless, for the only weapons they could fall back on were the same mixture of alliance and armed force that had caused the problem in the first place.7 Indeed, the situation was even worse than this suggested. By the mid-1780s, a major conflagration was in the making. As Jeremy Black has written, ‘In the 1780s, Europe’s rulers were not planning for the French Revolutionary War, but they were preparing for major conflicts, such as that which nearly broke out in 1790–91 between the Prussian alliance system and Austria and Russia’.8 Let us begin by considering France. Thus, once mighty, since 1763 she had suffered a series of major catastrophes and humiliations. In the east, the first partition of Poland of 1772 gravely weakened an old friend without providing any compensation in the form of the boost that was thereby given to Austria. Stripped of her enormous American territories in the Seven Years War, she had gained a certain degree of revenge by assisting the nascent United States of America in the American War of Independence, only to find that this action had shattered her financial position beyond repair and brought her little or nothing in the way of material gain: Tobago, Saint Pierre and Miquelon and a few forts on the coast of what is today Senegal were hardly an impressive haul in this respect.9 In this position she was repeatedly humbled, being forced both to accept a profoundly unfavourable commercial treaty by the British and to stand by helplessly whilst Prussian forces crushed the pro-French régime established by the Dutch revolution of 1785–7. Still worse, perhaps (in going to war with Britain, the French foreign minister, Vergennes, had hoped that humbling Britain on the global stage would force the latter to secure her place in Europe by forging an alliance with France), the damage inflicted on Britain turned out to be minimal in economic terms as well as military ones, for the American colonies – a region of the world that was diverse, populous and affluent enough to constitute a more valuable market for the Old World than any number of sugar islands – were led by factors of cost, sentiment and long-standing business and family links to go on buying British.10 To say that on the eve of the Revolution France was bent on a war that could reverse these disasters would be a wild overstatement – her statesmen were actually pursuing a variety of courses, some of them quite contradictory; Vergennes himself remained a friend of peace right up until his death in 1787; and the financial position was so desperate that 1788 saw the military budget reach an all-time low – but nevertheless this was certainly an option that was being kept open and prepared for: whilst a massive programme of military reform transformed the army and prepared it for offensive operations, French diplomats sought to bolster the position of Austria – France’s chief ally – by seeking an alliance with Persia that might make Russia think twice about going on the offensive in the west (that said, desperate to avoid conflict, Vergennes had refused to back Joseph II of Austria’s schemes for a deal that would see Bavaria added to Austria and the ruling Wittelsbach family given the Austrian Netherlands in exchange). At the same time, efforts were made both to dissuade Vienna from embarking on military adventures in the Balkans and to build up the Turks against Russia whilst also securing a trade agreement with the latter. As for Britain, she, too, was threatened by continued naval construction, alliances with the rulers of Egypt – in theory, a province of the Ottoman Empire but, in practice, a quasi-independent dominion – the dispatch of naval expeditions to India and Cochin China, and the construction from 1783 onwards of a massive naval base at Cherbourg.11 It was not just France that, if only implicitly, was threatening to overthrow the status quo, however. In the eastern powers, too, there were factors making for war. In Austria, for example, Joseph II had been engaged on an aggressive attempt to build a powerful, centralised state, but he had run into increasing opposition and was inclined to seek redress not only in plans that would have involved swapping the Austrian Netherlands for Bavaria but also in\n\nThe origins of the French Revolutionary Wars 5 launching an attack on the Ottoman Empire in company with Russia. Also contemplated, meanwhile, was a renewed war with Prussia, the death of Frederick II in 1786 suggesting that she would now be a much easier target. All the more was this the case, meanwhile, as Prussia had in recent years frustrated a series of Austrian attempts to reinforce its position in the Holy Roman Empire.12 What, meanwhile, about Prussia? For Frederick William II, too, aggression was essential. Thus, the gains made in the first partition of Poland had been much smaller than those obtained by either Russia or Austria, whilst Russia had gone on to make further gains in the Russo-Turkish War of 1768–74. Still worse, some of the territories left to Poland were particularly sensitive in so far as Prussia was concerned, the failure to obtain them having left the Prussian army with some difficult strategic problems. Nor had any significant compensation been obtained in the War of the Bavarian Succession of 1778: although Frederick II had frustrated a major improvement in Austria’s position in Germany, he had turned down the opportunity for territorial gains. For his successor, then, more land was essential. In the first place, the means used were to be peaceful ones – like Vienna, Potsdam was quite capable of working out fanciful plans for territorial exchanges, whilst Frederick William II was no warlord – but it is clear that there was to be no drawing back.13 In Sweden there was a situation parallel to that of Austria in that a reformist monarch – in this case Gustavus III – had run into serious opposition at home and wished to reinforce the power of the throne by a flight to the front vis à vis Russia.14 And, last but not least, there was the Russia of Catherine the Great, which, thanks in part to the influence of the empress’ lover, Grigory Potemkin, a hero of the struggle of 1768–74 who was bent on driving the Turks from Europe, liberating Constantinople and, at the very least, setting up a Greek satellite state if not restoring the Byzantine empire, was proving so aggressive in its attitude with respect to its interpretation of the treaty of 1774 that the Sultan’s government was being pushed ever closer towards a counter-stroke.15 This is not the place to retail the long and complicated story of the events that followed. In brief, the inevitable crisis exploded in August 1787 when Turkey attacked Russia in an attempt to claw back the serious losses she had suffered in the war she had waged with Russia in the period 1768–74 (the result had been the treaty of Kutchuk Kainarjae, by which Constantinople had to surrender its overlordship of the Khanate of the Crimea, pay Russia substantial reparation and cede Bukovina to Austria, as well as granting Saint Petersburg the right to protect the substantial Christian populations contained within the Ottomans’ domains). This conflict in turn provoked a general war in eastern Europe in that, bound by the terms of the treaty of alliance she had negotiated with Russia in 1781, Austria was forced to enter the war against Turkey, whereupon Sweden declared war against Russia and Denmark declared war against Sweden.16 Meanwhile, in 1789 large parts of the Habsburg Empire were gripped by a great wave of protest at the centralising policies of Joseph II, the disturbances in the Austrian Netherlands – i.e. the western half of present-day Belgium – eventually culminating, as we shall see, in an armed revolt that drove out the Austrians altogether. By 1790, except in the Balkans, the fighting had died down, not least because, in a clear instance of the growing importance of public opinion, Gustavus III had been forced by growing internal opposition to make peace with Russia, but, in the midst of the general confusion, revolution had broken out in Poland where a reformist faction amongst the nobility was anxious to restore her fortunes and build a modern state: in the middle of the eighteenth century Poland had been the largest state in Europe next to Russia and Austria, but a series of complicated events in the first half of the century had reduced her to the status of a Russian protectorate, while the deeply entrenched rights of the nobility – the most notorious was the so-called liberum veto, a provision that meant that it took the\n\n6 The origins of the French Revolutionary Wars vote of just one deputy for new laws to be thrown out by the diet – had had the result of hamstringing the state in military terms and leaving her wide open to a partition that saw Austria, Russia and Prussia seize substantial border territories from her in 1772.17 Until now, events in France had for the most part been ignored, but in the course of 1791 she too was dragged into the crisis on account of Leopold II of Austria’s desperate attempts to stave off a further round of hostilities and, in particular, a further partition of Poland (see below). For the self-same reason, it is now time for us to turn to those events. What happened in France in 1789 and the years the followed has, of course, been subjected to endless debate, and it is not the intention of the author to recapitulate the full canon of that debate in the current work. In essence, however, the story begins with the bankruptcy – financial, certainly, but also personal, political, diplomatic and military – of the French monarchy. To begin with the figure of Louis XVI is, perhaps, to risk accusations of somehow imagining that if only France had been ruled by a Louis XIV the French Revolution would never have happened, but it is not necessary to take this line to accept that Louis XVI was scarcely either a dynamic or a reassuring figure: whilst he may have allowed himself to be painted wearing a suit of seventeenth-century style armour in the same style as that affected by so many of his contemporaries, such dreams as he entertained of foreign-policy success revolved around the exercise of what today would be called soft power. Thus, if France would reign supreme, it would be on account of her cultural supremacy and the reputation of her monarch for wisdom and beneficence. To quote William Doyle, indeed, ‘All Louis XVI had was good intentions.’18 Having inherited the throne at the age of just twenty, following the sudden death of Louis XV, a monarch who had done little or nothing to prepare him for his future role, he was conscientious, hard-working and by no means unintelligent, but, with all, he was shy, awkward and uncommunicative; very much inclined to take refuge behind a mask of hauteur; obstinate to a fault; and determined to defend his every prerogative. As if all this was not enough, meanwhile, he was also extremely obese, and this added still further to the general air of lackadaisicalness, an air that was contributed to by the fact that, desperate to show that he was no tyrant, he had rescinded the reforms imposed on the regional councils of administration and justice known as the parlements by his predecessor’s chief minister, Maupeou, virtually as soon as he had come to the throne and ever afterwards fought shy of repeating the experiment: when a new Comptroller-General of Finance, Anne-Robert Turgot, attempted a further bout of reform from 1774 onwards, he was very quickly dismissed.19 And, if obesity was one chink in the king’s armour, his queen, Marie-Antoinette, was another. Much demonised both before and after 1789 on account of a wide range of wholly invented social and sexual misdeeds, the sometime Maria Antonia of Austria did not deserve much of the calumny that was heaped upon her, but she cannot be defended from charges of ignorance, frivolity, extravagance, indifference to the plight of the poor and meddling in court politics, whilst the fact that she was Austrian was little short of disastrous (as we shall see, the alliance with Austria of which she was the personification offered France very little, whilst at the same time risking dragging her into conflicts in eastern Europe in which she had little interest, the result being that the queen was perceived as nothing short of a de facto enemy agent, and not so much l’autrichienne – the Austrian woman – as la chienne autriche – the Austrian bitch).20 Had the circumstances been different, it is possible that the king and queen’s personal failings would not have mattered. However, the circumstances were not different. On the contrary, as detailed above, in the wake of American Revolution, France found she had gained little benefit from Britain’s humiliation. Thus, her diplomatic situation seemed as weak as ever, while the Austrians repeatedly failed to give her the support she needed.\n\nThe origins of the French Revolutionary Wars 7 As the 1780s rolled on, meanwhile, so the diplomatic eclipse seemed to darken by the year. Establishing a friendly government in Amsterdam would have been a triumph in the constant struggle with Britain – setting aside the valuable strategic situation occupied by the United Provinces themselves, the Dutch held footholds in the wider world that would be of obvious value in the form of the Cape of Good Hope and Ceylon – and yet the opportunity had been lost, matters being rendered still worse by the fact that the chief result of the crisis had been the emergence of an alliance between Britain, Holland and Prussia that effectively blocked all hope of serious advances in the Low Countries. As for efforts to mediate a peace in the Balkans that would have allowed the Turks – a traditional ally of France – to emerge from the war with Austria and Russia – a war in which Austria’s involvement was one more sign of the contempt in which Vienna seemed to hold French interests – with minimal losses, these were rebuffed. Nor was it just such matters of detail, important as these were. Even more frightening were the structural changes that had taken place in European geopolitics. Thus, at the beginning of the eighteenth century, Louis XIV had in part been able to dominate Europe because the support of Spain in the west, and Sweden, Poland and the Ottoman Empire in the east, sufficed to balance the British and Austrians. However, the situation had now changed in that the British were far more powerful than they had been a century earlier, while the rise of Prussia and Russia – powers that had been negligible in 1700 – ensured that France’s eastern allies were now far less effective. As Stone has said, ‘The entire strategic calculus of Versailles . . . was rendered obsolete by developments at Saint Petersburg and Berlin.’21 Clearly, then, if France was to defend her interests in the cut-throat world of international relations, she would, needs must, have to depend on her own resources, but these, it was clear, were simply not fit for purpose. The navy, certainly, was both large and of considerable quality, but the very special circumstances of 1781 – a moment that saw France, Holland and Spain united in alliance against Britain – were unlikely to be repeated: able to build ships at a far greater rate than the French, by 1789 the British had an advantage of well over two to one in terms of ships of the line.22 Even fighting in such a context, meanwhile, the Bourbon fleet was far from invincible in tactical terms – the very squadron that had triumphed at Chesapeake Bay had, after all, shortly afterwards suffered a crushing defeat at the Battle of the Saints, a fact that was doubly worrying given the fact that the same West-Indian waters contained the vital colonies of Saint Domingue and Guadeloupe – while it was not ships that were going to make a difference in facing up to opponents such as Prussia or, for that matter, convincing Austria to take more notice of France’s interests. Yet the French army looked even less fit for purpose than the navy. Populous though France was, her army was comparatively small, while the earnest attempts that had been made to improve its performance since the disastrous defeats of the Seven Years War – the most important are the formation of specialist light-infantry battalions, the introduction of the superlative Gribeauval artillery system and the opening of a network of military academies – had yet to be tested in combat and, in some instances – above all, the tactics that the infantry should employ on the battlefield – were still the subject of intense debate. But even had the army been stronger, there was simply not the money to allow France to go to war: indeed, such a course of action was explicitly rejected by the current Minister of Finance, Loménie de Brienne, on the grounds of cost. To quote Jeremy Black, then, ‘In foreign-policy terms, 1787 marked the beginning of the Revolution.’23 To make this point more explicitly, it is necessary to examine the gulf that had opened between France’s governance and the requirements of her prosperity and, to the extent that one can speak about such a thing, national interest. Thus, over the past fifty years or\n\n8 The origins of the French Revolutionary Wars more, the wealth of France’s West-Indian colonies had come to form the bedrock of her wealth. Whilst French merchants and financiers made fortunes from the slave trade, other merchants, not to mention the planters of Saint Domingue and the other French colonies, made equal fortunes from the consignments of sugar, coffee, indigo and other products that they sent back to France both for domestic consumption and re-export. Finally, in the hinterlands of Atlantic ports such as Bordeaux, La Rochelle and Nantes, cultivation of the commercial crops necessitated by maritime expansion was booming, just as in their shipyards a host of craftsmen were labouring to construct the new vessels that were just as essential.24 Members of the nobility and the bourgeoisie alike thrived off the immense profits which all this economic activity generated, and the latter group in particular were able to use their growing wealth to buy their way into the ancien régime, whether by acquiring land or patents of nobility.25 With France clearly a nullity in international relations, the question could not but arise as to how the substantial economic interests that had thus been generated could be defended against British predation. Seemingly there was no money with which to lend muscle to French foreign policy, and yet the fabulous ostentation of Versailles – a spectacle to which even those who were no more than moderately prosperous could gain access and which was therefore in effect on show for all to see – suggested that money existed in plenty, the problem being rather that the monarchy could not be trusted to spend it on the men and ships that were so obviously required: it was after all only in 1768 that a new royal palace – the so-called Petit Trianon – had been erected at Versailles, whilst in 1783 this had been followed by the Hameau de la Reine, on the surface a fantastical rural idyll constructed for no better reason than to allow Marie-Antoinette to play at being a shepherdess.26 And, if the Hameau de la Reine was completed, the naval base at Cherbourg was not.27 Dissatisfaction with the régime’s conduct of foreign policy, then, was rife, but this was but the beginning.28 For the French élites, the 1780s was an extremely frightening period. At the heart of this was a combination of economic instability, agrarian and industrial backwardness and population growth. To begin with economic instability, with France an overwhelmingly rural country, the harvest was everything, and that meant in turn that the whole country was at the mercy of the weather. Should the latter ruin the harvest, then the amount of grain available for release to the urban market would fall by a disproportionate amount. And this in turn would force up the price of the bread that was the staple of the artisans and the labouring poor, thereby undermining the market for such mundane items as stools, benches, cups, plates and cutlery, not to mention the second-hand clothes that were a prominent feature of every street market, the result being that the income of the humble was also hit very badly. With the peasantry’s always limited disposable income also being sent into sharp decline, the resultant crisis would spread ever more widely until its tentacles had enfolded even the humblest pedlar. To break out of this situation, of course, what was needed was industrialisation, but this last was in the aggregate limited in the extreme, not least because France’s colonies were not extensive enough to generate the sort of demand for cotton products and other goods emanating from Britain’s much more impressive collection of overseas territories and continued control of the vital American market (also important here was, first, an overwhelming tendency for surplus capital to be invested in land and status rather than industry, and, second, the backwardness and low productivity of much of French agriculture).29 And, finally, due to a variety of factors, including the disappearance of the plague and, particularly in the middle years of the century, an unwonted number of good harvests, the population had been increasing ever more sharply: in 1789 there were perhaps 7,000,000 more Frenchmen than there had been in 1700, at least half of whom had been born in the years since 1750.\n\nThe origins of the French Revolutionary Wars 9 With the economy (and, yet again, the colonies: in this respect the loss of Canada in the Seven Years War was crucial) unable to sustain such increases, the result was grim indeed. As McPhee writes: Twenty-two of the years between 1765 and 1789 were marked by food riots, either in popular urban neighbourhoods where women in particular sought . . . to hold prices at customary levels, or in rural areas where peasants banded together to prevent scarce supplies from being sent away to market.30 Nor was it just that disturbances were frequent: on the contrary, from the 1760s onwards, the number of such events rose steadily until the events of the great subsistence crisis of 1775 – an event that produced a popular response so dramatic that it became known as the ‘Flour War’ – fell back for a few years under the influence of a series of good harvests and then shot ever upwards until they blended with the disturbances that formed the backdrop to 1789.31 Finally, also all too observable were brigandage and vagrancy: from the 1760s onwards, the plains of La Beauce – an area that was by no means the most propitious in France as a theatre of operations for bandit chieftains – were for many years terrorised by a series of gangs known as the chauffeurs d’Orgères, while the roads of many parts of France were constantly thronged by aimless groups of wandering poor who, even if their prime objective was to find work, food and shelter, were nonetheless regarded as a serious social menace.32 Against this internal threat, the régime could offer little protection – though surprisingly well organised, not to mention the best force of its kind in the whole of Europe, the semi-military constabulary known as the maréchaussée numbered under 4,000 men and, like the army and the navy, was simply not strong enough to do its job, whilst the beginnings of a national system of poor relief that were laid down in the form of the workhouses set up in most main towns from the 1760s onwards were but gestures given the swarms of beggars and prostitutes who thronged the streets33 – and thus it was that failure on the home front joined failure abroad as a source of complaint amongst the propertied classes.34 However, these same propertied classes were a force that was far better educated and politically aware than had ever been the case in the past. With the coming of the so-called polite society and, more specifically, the salon, it became de rigueur for anyone desirous of being regarded as a person of culture to have at least a nodding acquaintance with the literature of the day, included in which was not just a growing range of novels – themselves by no means necessarily calculated to uphold the moral norms of the ancien régime35 – but also the extraordinary outpouring of social, political, economic and scientific thought that we collectively refer to as the Enlightenment. That this was anything but a coherent doctrine, let alone a blueprint for revolution, goes without saying. However, nor was it a blueprint for stasis. Driven, above all, by the concept of reason, the philosophes – such figures as Montesquieu, Voltaire, D’Holbach, D’Alembert and Diderot – directly or indirectly subjected almost every aspect of the ancien régime to a biting critique that was reinforced by the writings of the many other scholars and men of letters scattered across Europe, such as David Gibbon, David Hume, Adam Smith, Cesare Beccaria and Immanuel Kant. As for their collective message, it could not be mistaken: through the application of human reason and intellect and the pursuit of knowledge, society could be remodelled, reconstructed, even remade altogether. And, if that was so, it followed that even France’s problems could be resolved: she could alike be better governed, more efficient, more educated, more secure, more successful, more prosperous and more respected. Already under attack for its ownership of so much of the land and opposition to progress, the Church – itself by no means a monolithic block, but rather an\n\n10 The origins of the French Revolutionary Wars institution deeply divided between died-in-the-wool defenders of the supremacy of Rome and reformers known as Jansenists who wanted much greater power for the bishops, an end to the religious orders and much greater support of the parish clergy – was also being undermined by the great strides that were being made in the understanding of the natural world, great strides in which Frenchmen – most notably, the chemist, Lavoisier – were once again playing an important part. To quote William Doyle, then, ‘The Enlightenment was a critical movement, and its advocates spent much of their time pouring scorn on pillars of the established order of things such as the Church and the legal system.’36 ‘Critical’, however, is not a word that should be taken too far. In the words of Norman Hampson, ‘The Enlightenment . . . was not primarily a political movement except in the sense that anti-clericalism was a political programme of a kind.’37 And, if it was not political, still less was it democratic. With a few notable exceptions, the men who ‘made’ the Enlightenment in France were anything but enemies of the ancien régime: if anything, indeed, they were enemies of the people, a group who in their eyes were devoid of reason and sensibility, not to mention irredeemably violent and brutish.38 Yet almost every word that the philosophes wrote in one way or another undermined Louis XVI and Marie-Antoinette, just as hapless servants of the monarchy such as Turgot and Necker inadvertently highlighted the failings of the Bourbon state through their desperate efforts to restore its fortunes. That these failings were enormous, meanwhile, was all too clear. It was not just that the court was wildly extravagant. Wherever the sharp-eyed observer looked, there was chaos. To do justice to this subject in so short a compass is near impossible, but there were nine major factors that held back the French state from realising its not inconsiderable potential. In no particular order, these were as follows: first, the survival of the thirteen parlements, these being regional high courts of appeal staffed by a corps of judges entirely independent of the monarchy on account of the fact that they had either bought or inherited their seats that effectively had a right of veto over all royal legislation; second, the fact that, like the judges of the parlements, the vast majority of officials held their posts either because they themselves had bought them or because this had been done by earlier generations; third, the fact that the collection of most sources of revenue was in the hands of tax farmers who paid over comparatively little of their income to the royal treasury; fourth, the inadequacy of a tax system that touched the resources of the propertied classes (whether noble or bourgeois) hardly at all and exempted the Church altogether; fifth, a legal system that inflicted on France a multiplicity of local courts and legal codes; sixth, web upon web of internal customs duties that at one and the same time acted as a break on industry, undermined the domestic market and rendered it very difficult to transfer grain and other food stuffs from one part of the country to another in times of dearth; seventh, the survival in many parts of France of mediaeval estates that were jealous in their defence of provincial privilege; eighth, a widespread degree of municipal self-government that more than anything else served to defend such privileges as freedom from taxation; and ninth the failure to provide the intendants (hand-picked royal officials with the unenviable task of enforcing the will of the throne and in general heading the administration in their areas) with adequate support in terms of men and authority alike.39 All this, of course, served to give the writings of the philosophes an impact of a sort that the latter had never intended. Meanwhile, for every D’Alembert or Diderot, there were ten, twenty, thirty or more writers of a very different genre whose work had an effect that was still more corrosive. As yet, France was anything but a literate society en tout, but she was nonetheless a society in which reading was becoming ever more common, and one which was therefore beginning to generate an ever-greater demand for reading matter.\n\nThe origins of the French Revolutionary Wars 11 Meanwhile, as education increased (as indeed it did), so there began to appear figures who could find no niche in the structures of power and authority and therefore came to hate it for the manner in which it excluded them from power. Thus was born the figure of the pamphleteer, the man who made his living by hanging on the fringes of educated society and not just reflecting its concerns but popularising them and at the same time increasing the number of his own readers. As witness both the catalogues of illicit booksellers and the consignments of illicit works periodically seized by the authorities, what this boiled down to was a move in the direction of sensationalism and not just that but pornography. The court, then, was not only extravagant but corrupt, a place where masked balls were covers for orgies in which everybody from the queen down engaged in bouts of multiple coupling with numerous partners, including on occasion members of the same sex (everybody, that is, bar the unfortunate Louis XVI whose unfortunate deficiencies in the bedchamber were notorious and who therefore became an even greater subject of derision, particularly when compared with the notoriously uxorious Louis XIV and Louis XV). And, if this was what went on at Versailles, so it went on in many other areas of First and Second Estate society: a particular target here was the Church, and thus it was, for example, that pornographic prints circulated, showing such scenes as voluptuous nuns languidly choosing between rival ecclesiastical erections.40 Developments on the home front therefore combined with developments abroad to bring the question of reform ever closer to the fore. In the end, however, it was the régime that precipitated the crisis. In the wake of the American War of Independence, Louis XVI acquired a new Minister of Finance in the person of Charles de Calonne. An erstwhile intendant, Calonne was all too aware of the monarchy’s many difficulties and he immediately threw himself into a last-ditch effort to produce a plan of reform that would somehow bring in the money that was required to render France a credible great power once again. The chief result of his work was a series of proposals in many respects harking back to the work of Turgot that would have ended the fiscal immunity of the propertied classes, cut government expenditure, rendered the collection of the taxes on salt and tobacco much more equitable, introduced moves towards free trade and, perhaps most importantly, opened the way for the expropriation and sale of the lands of the Church. As both Calonne and the king were well aware, however, simply to announce these measures by decree would have been to incur the wrath of the parlements and see them at the very least gravely delayed, if not blocked altogether. To get round this situation, an appeal to some higher authority was required, and thus it was that he summoned an ‘assembly of notables’ consisting of 144 senior officials, churchmen and aristocrats whose task it was to ratify the reform programme on behalf of the whole nation.41 In itself, the convocation of an assembly of notables was not revolutionary: on the contrary, similar bodies had appeared on three earlier occasions in French history. That, however, was by the by: the net result was to precipitate revolution. For reasons that are not entirely clear – the traditional explanation is that the delegates to the assembly had too strong a vested financial interest in the existing system to tolerate reform, but later historians have in some instances claimed rather that the problem was above all one of detail and even that there was some feeling that Calonne should have gone further – Calonne’s ideas were thrown out and their author dismissed and sent into internal exile. With Calonne gone, the position of Minister of Finance passed to the Archbishop of Toulouse and erstwhile president of the assembly, Etienne Loménnie de Brienne. A much less abrasive figure than Calonne, the new minister succeeded in getting some of the less radical parts of his predecessor’s plan accepted by the parlements, but their opposition to such matters as a new\n\n12 The origins of the French Revolutionary Wars land tax was unyielding and, after a prolonged battle with the powerful Parlement de Paris in particular, in August 1788 Loménnie resigned when it became clear that, while the parlements could be silenced (albeit to the accompaniment of enormous public agitation, they were in fact all shut down by decree in May of the same year), France was now quite literally bankrupt: whereas Calonne and his predecessors had hitherto kept the ship of state afloat by borrowing vast sums of money at even vaster rates of interest, the financiers on which they had relied would no longer listen to their demands, still more damage to the royal cause being done when an assembly of the clergy that had been summoned to vote through the Church’s regular financial don to the state limited this to less than one-quarter of the considerable sum that had been asked for and, still worse, decreed that even the miserly amount concerned should be spread over two years; hence the decision to summon the mediaeval parliament, known as the Estates General, recognised though it was that this body had the right to demand the redress of grievances prior to granting fresh taxes.42 The decision to convoke the Estates General had implications that were beyond massive. Literally overnight, France was plunged into a new world. In the first place, there was the question of the conditions under which the new assembly should meet and, in the second, the only slightly less pressing question of the issues which it should debate, this being an explosive mixture. Given that the régime addressed the second issue by issuing an appeal for the elaboration of cahiers des doléances (literally, ‘notebooks of grievances’), the upshot could not but be a vigorous period of debate, but fuel was added to the flames by an announcement that, as had been the case when it last met in 1614, the new body would meet by estates (i.e. by its separate houses, each of which were 300 strong), thereby ensuring that the clergy and the nobility would always outvote the Third Estate – the representatives, at least in theory, of the people – despite the fact that the strength of this last’s contingent was increased from 300 to 600. Over the past few years, debate on the future of France had already been vociferous, but now the release by Loménnie de Brienne’s successor, Necker, of many journalists and pamphleteers who had been imprisoned for engaging in criticism of the régime, the suspension of censorship – a logical consequence of the convocation of the Estates General – and the relaxation of rules banning seditious assemblies meant that the floodgates were well and truly open. Nowhere is this more apparent than in the enormous number of pamphlets that now saw the light of day, some 4,158 being published in the year preceding the opening of the Estates General; much the same was true of newspapers, in respect of which the four titles in publication at the beginning of 1788 had risen to 184 by the end of 1789. And with the pamphlets came political clubs and societies that in many instances were merely extensions of pre-existing salons but, unlike such earlier gatherings, ranged themselves behind particular issues or points of view. In the pithy words of François Furet, then, ‘The monarchy . . . by renouncing its nature, was making way for society.’43 The cahiers des doléances, therefore, emerged on the crest of a wave of public debate that was completely unprecedented and drew its impetus from a much wider segment of French society than just the salons. As for the demands that they made of Louis XVI and his ministers, these were many, varied and occasionally contradictory, including, as they did, regular meetings of the Estates General; the gallicanisation of the Church; the abolition of the tithe and the religious orders; the strengthening of the system of provincial estates; the end of noble and ecclesiastical privilege; the institution of both cheaper systems of justice and more uniform codes of justice; the reduction of public expenditure; the regulation of every profession from prostitution to surgery; the reform of every form of taxation; the closure of theatres and gaming houses; the moral regeneration of society; the abolition of slavery in France’s colonies; the provision of better public services in such areas as highways, street\n\nThe origins of the French Revolutionary Wars 13 lighting, sanitation and access to medical care; and the establishment of basic freedoms of property, occupation and the individual. Not all the demands had equal support behind them, and not all the cahiers voiced the same list of demands or interpreted similar demands in the same way, but the general inference was clear: at every level of society, there was a clear recognition that the ancien régime was no longer fit for purpose.44 Thus far, whilst not ignoring the question of popular involvement and interest in the march of events, we have discussed the Revolution very much as a political phenomenon, as, indeed, a movement that above all reflected the interests of the élites. From the start, however, it was clear that it was much more than just this, that France, in fact, was in the grip of a movement that was at least as much social as it was political. Mention has already been made of the problem of poverty, but it has up until now only been discussed in terms of the extent to which it impinged upon the concerns of the propertied classes. What we need to do now is to consider the problem as it was experienced by the less favoured members of society. That the concerns of these groups were very different from those of the élites is suggested very clearly by close analysis of such views as they were able to inject into the political process. Nowhere is this clearer than in the many thousands of cahiers des doléances that were elaborated by humble parish assemblies in rural areas. Thus, whilst assemblies representing the various élites placed most emphasis on demands calculated to satisfy political agenda – in the case of the nobility, the restriction of royal power and, in that of the more prosperous elements of the Third Estate, the abolition of noble privilege and the setting aside of hindrances to economic development – those that echoed the concerns of the peasantry were rather filled with demands for a fairer system of taxation, the abolition of conscription to the militia and a massive assault on the perquisites of feudalism.45 We come here to a very different revolution. In so far as the propertied élites were concerned, what was required was essentially a series of political reforms that would ultimately bring greater prosperity and with it a reform of the social problem. However, beyond the charmed circle of polite society was a world whose priorities were very different. We speak here, of course, of the rural populace, this being composed of an admixture of peasants – small tenant farmers and owner occupiers who farmed no more land than they could manage by themselves or with the aid of their immediate families and, in a minority of wealthier instances, a few hired hands brought in for the harvest or the spring sowing – and the mass of landless labourers and men who owned or rented a little land but had to supplement their income by hiring out their labour to their richer neighbours or joining the hordes of migrant workers who tramped the country in search of work on the harvest every summer. For these groups, as has already been suggested, life was very hard in that they were inherently vulnerable to the vagaries of the weather and also under the cosh of a combination of steady population growth (amongst other things, this had the effect of, first, driving up rents by as much as 50 per cent and, second, progressively subdividing peasant holdings to such an extent that in the end very few families were left with enough land to live on), mid-century agrarian reforms aimed at enclosing the commons implemented under the influence of the group known as the Physiocrats, and systems of crop rotation that kept as much as half the arable land out of production at any given moment, but many features of the ancien régime conspired to make life even more difficult for them. First and foremost there were the twin pressures exercised by the feudal system and the state (a third element here could conceivably be the Church, but it is generally agreed that, whilst all those who owned or rented land had to pay the tithe, the amount that this represented – usually much less than a tenth, when, that is, it was paid at all, was fairly inconsequential).46 Taking feudalism, first of all, vileins were not tied to the land, did not have to perform forced labour on their seigneurs’\n\n14 The origins of the French Revolutionary Wars estates and, money permitting, could even own or rent plots of their own: what survived, then, was a wide range of financial payments (the seigneurs, for example, monopolised such facilities as ovens, windmills and olive presses and charged more or less heavy fees for their use), restrictive game laws which prohibited poaching even in times of the utmost dearth and prevented villagers from dealing with such pests as rabbits and pigeons, the subjection of the populace to the manorial courts and certain restrictions on property rights (in brief, smallholdings whose owner died without a direct heir reverted to the ownership of the appropriate seigneur).47 Meanwhile, although conditions varied from place to place – in parts of Brittany, for example, feudal dues had not been revised for 150 years48 – on the whole the rule of the seigneurs was becoming ever more oppressive as arriviste members of the bourgeoisie sought to do all they could to maximise their investments and needy nobles struggled to keep up appearances in the face of a tide of social change.49 Yet it was not just feudalism. Also to be considered were the demands of the state. To the latter went the land tax and the poll tax, both of them discriminatory levies that fell almost entirely on the rural populace, as well as a variety of levies on basic commodities such as salt, all of which gave rise to much bitterness, not least because the inhabitants of one province very often found themselves paying much higher rates than neighbours living just across the border in another. ‘The indirect taxes are detestable’, railed one cahier des doléances. ‘The exciseman has no respect for the privacy of our homes; he comes poking and prying, laying his hands on everything, and nothing is sacred in his eyes . . . The collector of the taille is a rapacious harpy whose one idea is to squeeze the poor in every way he can. The villagers charged with the collection of the taxes are compelled to ruin their neighbours so as not to be victimised themselves by the exorbitant demands of these petty tyrants.’50 Still worse, the situation was getting worse almost by the year. To quote Georges Lefebvre, ‘The royal demands had steadily risen during the eighteenth century . . . In Walloon Flanders . . . the increase in direct taxes in the reign of Louis XVI alone has been estimated at twenty-eight per cent.’51 If things were bad in the countryside, they were no better in the towns. As the population had risen in the course of the eighteenth century, so it had increasingly outstripped the capacity of the countryside to sustain it, and thus it was that large numbers of destitute villagers and their families began to migrate to the towns and cities in search of work. Unfortunately, however, the latter were no more able to sustain them than their places of origin. Indeed, in urban environments they may even have been worse off, for they had access to neither the kitchen gardens usual in even the most impoverished villages nor the chestnuts, mushrooms and wild berries of the commons, and instead found themselves exposed to a situation in which the price of food they now had no option but to purchase was rising far more quickly than any wages they might hope to earn. Paris, Rouen, Lyon and most other large towns were therefore crammed with thousands of families living on the edge of destitution with little in the way of skills that they could offer. When times were not too hard, some of the men might find work as porters or labourers and some of the women in sweat shops, while there were also generally at least some opportunities in domestic service, but the existence of these classes was, at best, a precarious one, and their physical conditions never other than dreadful. Little better off, meanwhile, were the majority of artisans: not only, albeit indirectly so, were they as much at the mercy of the weather as any peasant or landless labourer, but they were no more immune than the very poor to the ravages of the diseases that stalked town and countryside alike and could in a matter of hours deprive a family of its main breadwinner. As noted before, then, begging, petty crime and prostitution were rife, while the very high incidence of, if not infanticide, then, condemnation to the\n\nThe origins of the French Revolutionary Wars 15 near certainty of the death sentence represented by the numerous foundling hospitals stands as a constant reminder of the miseries endured by the lowest echelons of Bourbon society.52 The poor were a constant and ineradicable feature of life in France, but, as 1788 headed towards 1789, there were even more of them than normal. Why this should have been so is not hard to establish. The commercial treaty signed with Britain in 1786 had certainly had some impact on France’s various textile industries, but it would be misleading to place too much weight upon this factor, not least because the treaty had taken so little time to have the dramatic effects which are sometimes alleged: Blanning, for example, speaks of ‘a recession which affected all sectors of the economy except the colonial trade’ from the 1770s onwards, as well as ‘a collapse of wine prices [from 1778] due to over-production and overabundant harvests’.53 Things were already difficult, then, but on 13 July 1788 there came complete disaster in that a freak hailstorm swept across a broad swathe of northern France and devastated a harvest that was already promising to be mediocre thanks to a serious lack of rain earlier in the year. The consequence was all too predictable in that the country was immediately plunged into a subsistence crisis. As usual, the price of bread began to rise ever more steeply, thereby undermining the ability of artisans to sell their products, while the mayhem was increased still further by an exceptionally severe winter which brought trade and industry to a standstill that was all but total. By the beginning of 1789, then, in town and countryside alike, the countryside was in the grip of conditions that almost certainly outstripped anything that had been seen in France for most of the previous century. Not surprisingly, if the situation was dramatic, so was the response. Bread riots broke out on all sides, the countryside began to mobilise against the seigneurs, and, in April, Paris witnessed serious disturbances when the premises of a wealthy manufacturer named Réveillon were ransacked by an angry mob. Thus far, in one sense, thus normal, but the situation in the spring of 1789 was anything but normal: with Versailles so close to Paris, news of events there was readily available, and all the more so, as the number of newspapers was almost literally growing by the day, no fewer than 180 new publications appearing in the course of 1789, publications, moreover, which were by all accounts being read or otherwise accessed by the denizens of not just the salons but the slums.54 The backdrop to the elections that took place from the autumn of 1788 to the spring of 1789 could, therefore, scarcely have been more threatening. Yet this did nothing whatsoever to affect the composition of the Estates General when it finally assembled in Versailles in 1789. The Third Estate were elected on a very wide franchise consisting of every male taxpayer aged twenty-five or above, but, thanks to the system of indirect election that was adopted, not to mention the fact that deputies were unpaid and had to meet all their own costs, this did nothing to produce a body that was in any way representative of its constituents. ‘What is the Third Estate?’, famously demanded the pamphleteer, Emanuel Sièyes. The answer, of course, was everyone who was not either a noble or an ecclesiastic: in other words, roughly 25,000,000 out of a total population of 26,000,000, of whom the vast majority were the peasants. However, this was not reflected by the composition of the men who came to Versailles. Thus, of 610 deputies, some 400 were lawyers or officials, eighty-five financiers, merchants and manufacturers and about fifty ‘men of letters’, each and every one of them men of property. These, then, were the men who, at least initially, ‘made’ the Revolution, and it was largely to the needs and perceptions of the groups that they represented that that it was initially addressed, needs and perceptions, be it said, that did not even begin to address those of the humble peasants and artisans who had suddenly found themselves given a voice. To paraphrase Gwynne Lewis, if the Third Estate on display at Versailles was intellectually radical, it was also socially conservative.55\n\n16 The origins of the French Revolutionary Wars Yet the men of Versailles were not alone. Operating alongside them was another group entirely, namely the swarms of radical pamphleteers and radicals who had been unleashed by the collapse of press censorship. Typical of these figures of the so-called ‘Fourth Estate’ were Jacques Brissot, a clerk from Chartres who had twice been imprisoned in the Bastille for writing seditious pamphlets and spent some time in exile in London; Camille Desmoulins, a failed lawyer living in poverty in Paris who had turned to criticising the régime as a way of making his way in the world; Jacques Hébert, a clerk ruined by a law-suit; Jean Marat, a highly successful doctor who had put aside his medical practice in favour of becoming a full-time journalist in 1788; and François Babeuf, a sometime bailiff who had fallen on hard times. No one should doubt the genuine passion and idealism of such men, whilst, as the example of Marat suggests, it is very far from the truth to imagine that they were all penniless drifters who had failed to make their way in French society. That said, for their ideas to be heeded they all needed a radicalisation of the revolution, just as to maintain their influence (and, for the most part, support themselves), they needed readers, and lots of them. Logic, then, dictated an appeal to the streets, and they therefore were inclined increasingly to outbid one another in their rhetoric, to give their newspapers such titles as the Ami du Peuple and the Tribun du Peuple, and in the more extreme cases to make use of a language that was ever more crude and bloodthirsty. As such, meanwhile, they were to play a key part in events, it in large part being through their influence that the Revolution acquired a mass following. In Lewis’ pithy phrase, henceforth ‘the Parisian crowd, les petits . . . were always standing at the elbows of les gros’.56 The events that followed have been retold so many times that it is scarcely necessary to do so again now. As matters currently stood, the three houses – nobility, clergy and commonalty – that made up the Estates General were set to meet and vote separately from one another, and, as everyone was well aware, this meant that there was a very real danger that any proposals emanating from the Third Estate that challenged the established order in too aggressive or fundamental a fashion would be immediately voted down. For this reason, throughout the preceding six months or more, pressure had been growing in the press and the pamphlet literature for a move to joint meetings of the three houses and, with it, voting in common ‘by head’ rather than ‘by order’. Against this demand, now backed by the parlements, whose determination to defend corporate privilege at all costs was thereby starkly revealed (in the conflicts with the throne of the previous year they had consistently argued that they were defending the rights of the nation against tyranny), Louis XVI stood firm, but, hardly had the deputies assembled at Versailles, than his resistance began to crumble. In brief, the logic of the situation was unanswerable, especially as it soon became very clear that many of the deputies even of the First and Second Estates were not in sympathy with the demands of their more hardline fellows (amongst the nobles, there were plenty who regarded root-and-branch reform as being more important than the defence of a system that had long since outlived its usefulness, while the representatives of the Church were dominated by members of the parish clergy, a group whose depressed situation rendered them eager for change).57 When the increasingly angry Third Estate openly challenged the system by declaring itself to be a national assembly and, in the famous ‘Tennis-Court Oath’ of 20 June 1789, swearing that it would remain sitting until France had been given a constitution, the ancien régime collapsed: with more and more of the deputies of the First and Second Estates voting with their feet and voluntarily joining the representatives of the people, at the end of the month Louis gave way and ordered the remaining hold-outs to join their fellows. In the words of Georges Lefebvre, ‘Hence was effected . . . what may be called a juridical revolution, realised without recourse to violence, by methods taken over from the parlements by men trained in the law.’58\n\nThe origins of the French Revolutionary Wars 17 France, then, was now set on a course from which there was no return, but amongst the minority who refused to accept that this was the case was seemingly Louis XVI. Under pressure from his two brothers and Marie-Antoinette, the king decided that enough was enough. Confronted by yet another challenge by the Estates General, which on 9 July proclaimed themselves to be not just a national assembly but also a constituent assembly, on 11 July Louis dismissed his entire government and replaced it with a team of what he believed to be reliable aristocrats. In itself, this was an act of folly, for Necker, in particular, was well known to be genuinely committed to the cause of reform and, still more importantly, cheap bread, and was therefore immensely popular. Still worse, however, the king was also rumoured, correctly enough, to be massing large numbers of troops around Paris in preparation for a bid to restore order by force, the anger whipped up by this development being fanned still further by the fact that many of the troops concerned were known to be composed of Swiss and other foreigners.59 The results were impressive. Within a matter of hours, enormous crowds of Parisians, many of them members of the artisanate and the labouring poor, had flocked to impromptu political meetings held at the Palais Royale and other venues, where the impassioned rhetoric of self-appointed champions of reform such as Camille Desmoulins stirred them into marching through the streets and embarking on a desperate search for arms. The capital then was out of control, but Louis now discovered that the army was no longer willing to play the part assigned to it. For this, there were many reasons, including, not least, the fact that the officer corps was in many instances gripped by precisely the same desire for reform as so much of the rest of the propertied classes, just as the rank and file – billeted as they were on the inhabitants of Paris and the towns and villages roundabout, and drawn in large part from the same groups as they were now being expected to turn their arms upon and themselves frequently unable to buy sufficient food – were being pulled into the axis of the crowd. However, it was not just that. Also very important in the situation were a number of issues that were specifically military. Particularly important here was the fact that, given the situation that reigned with regard to gaining access to the officer corps and securing promotion with its ranks, much of the army’s leadership cadre was deeply disaffected on professional grounds. Louis XVI having never shown much interest in the army – having on the whole favoured the navy – even the grandest of grandee officers could feel mildly aggrieved.60 This, however, was the least of the king’s problems. Thus, disadvantaged by the aristocracy’s links with the court, the petty nobles who made up the bulk of the officer corps – let alone the handful of non-noble officers, the so-called officiers de fortune – were in most cases condemned to never rising above the rank of captain; the senior representatives of the corps of non-commissioned officers had just seen their already-slender hopes of gaining commissions dashed by an ordinance that laid down that henceforth all candidates for admission to the officer corps should be able to prove that not just they themselves but also their parents and even their grandparents were members of the nobility; and, finally, the rank and file endured poor conditions even when the situation was not nearly as dire as it was in 1789 and were subject to the sort of ruthless discipline typical of many eighteenth-century armies.61 Given this situation, the reality was that Louis XVI’s cause was in tatters. As violence and disorder mounted on the streets of Paris, many units simply went over to the demonstrators en masse, including, most notably, the whole of the regiment of French Guards. Here and there, there were some clashes between the crowd and units that as yet remained loyal, but the king’s commanders soon bowed to the inevitable and pulled back their men rather risk further mutinies. In Versailles, however, there was still a great fear that hordes of Swiss and German mercenaries were about to wreak havoc, and 13 July therefore witnessed\n\n18 The origins of the French Revolutionary Wars the National Assembly decree the formation of a citizens’ militia tasked with the defence of the revolution against the forces of reaction (at least, that was the public image: alongside it was the equally important goal of maintaining order and, if necessary, facing down the populace).62 In the future, this force, now denominated the National Guard, was to be overtly regularised as a propertied militia, but in Paris the authorities were in no position to enforce such niceties even if they wanted to, and the early hours of 14 July saw a large crowd simply constitute themselves as a revolutionary army and seize the substantial numbers of muskets stored in the great military complex of Les Invalides. Gunpowder, however, was lacking, and it was soon discovered that the city’s entire stock had been transferred to the mediaeval castle known as the Bastille. Royal prison as this also was – it was where those imprisoned by the executive orders known as the lettres de cachets were traditionally imprisoned – military necessity dovetailed neatly with political expedience, and a hastily organised force of around one thousand men therefore closed in on the fortress. The events that followed – a mélange of sporadic negotiations for a peaceful settlement interspersed with outbursts of fighting – need not be recounted in detail. Suffice to say that, by late afternoon, unprepared for a siege as he was and completely unsupported by the substantial force of troops still in the city, many of whom, indeed, mingled with the rioters or even joined them outright, the governor was persuaded that further resistance was pointless and therefore laid down his arms, not that this saved him, along with a number of his men, from being lynched by the crowd. As for the attackers, promptly labelled the vainqueurs de la Bastille, they became the Revolution’s first heroes and their dead its first martyrs.63 Revealed in the fall of the Bastille was one of the chief pillars of the Revolution at the popular level, namely the rage and despair of the urban poor (it was no coincidence that 14 July 1789 saw bread prices in Paris reach their highest level ever, whilst it is also worth pointing out that Necker was seen by the crowd not so much as the harbinger of a new political order as the harbinger of price controls). However, it was not just on the streets of Paris that the weight of popular ire was felt. In the countryside, the spectacle of a Third Estate dominated by bourgeois proprietors of the sort who were associated with some of the very worst efforts to maximise the profits to be made from the feudal system had not gone unnoticed, and rumours now began to spread of a counter-revolution in the countryside aimed at thwarting the demands of the peasantry. With the harvest approaching, the usual bands of desperate migrant labourers were on the move, and these were now transformed in the popular imagination into mercenary gangs called in to engage in intimidation and murder at the behest of the seigneurs (an alternative and less political explanation is that, given the general dearth, the populace were simply terrified of what the arrival of desperate bands of migrant labourers might mean for their communities, and still another that rural France was in the grip of a collective attack of paranoia brought about via the mass consumption of grain contaminated by ergot, but, even if these ideas have weight, the effect was much the same).64 The result was the grande peur. Starting in Franche-Comté and Gascony – areas that were very different from one another geographically and several hundred miles apart – the countryside was gripped by an extraordinary wave of panic and hysteria that had soon spread virtually from one end of the country to another. Terrified and angry alike, village after village turned on the seigneurs. Stewards and bailiffs, then, were frequently assaulted and many chateaux pillaged and burned to the ground, the trouble going on for many weeks. Weather vanes made in the image of coats of arms were a particular target, along with court houses and the manorial rolls that recorded the precise status of the vileins. Grain supplies, too, were requisitioned and, very occasionally, lands that had once belonged to the commons reclaimed. Finally, here and there, a few unfortunate or\n\nThe origins of the French Revolutionary Wars 19 particularly provocative seigneurs were even murdered. In one sense, there was nothing new here – peasant revolts, after all, had a long history in France – but never had anything been seen that was quite so widespread or quite so prolonged, nor had there ever been a threat to an entire harvest (in the past, trouble had come at moments in the agricultural years when little work was needed in the fields). Dominated by the representatives of rural property as it was, the National Assembly could not but be quickly drawn into the crisis, and, after much debate, on 4 August it took the only step open to it to save the harvest and defend its collective self-interest, namely the promulgation of the famous declaration announcing the abolition of feudalism.65 Meanwhile, just as in Paris the need to defend the Revolution from the monarchy had led to the formation of a propertied militia, so many villages saw the recruitment of what were in effect peasant equivalents, this being a development in which some observers later professed to see great significance. To quote Jean-Pierre Bial, the son of a prosperous tenant farmer from a small town in the province of Limousin who went on to become a colonel in the grande armée: A company of twenty-five to thirty men was organised under the command of Monsieur Boutang . . . The sudden transformation of these peasants into disciplined soldiers made for a strange sight. From that moment can be dated the birth among the mass of the nation of the warrior and patriotic spirit that went on to achieve such great things.66 At a stroke, then, the way had been opened to France’s transformation, but was this really the case? As has been pointed out, the vote of 4 August had only been enacted in a desperate bid to put an end to the grande peur and was immediately followed by the establishment of an aptly named ‘Feudal Committee’ whose members appear to have been chosen according to their likely moderation.67 Be that as it may, the French Revolution now stood revealed in all its diversity. At Versailles the Third Estate – an essentially élite property-owning group – and its allies among the clergy and the nobility was pushing for a far-reaching political reform that would open the way to an increase in domestic security, an improvement in the economic situation and a restoration of France’s power in Europe and the wider world. In Paris, especially, a vociferous coven of pamphleteers and propagandists were competing for influence and calling on the power of the street. In the larger towns and cities, including not just Paris but also such provincial centres as Lyons, Marseilles and Strasbourg, the artisans and their still less fortunate fellows wanted cheap bread. And in the countryside, the peasants and the landless labourers wanted an end to feudalism and, with it, access to the land. Over the next few years, events in France were to be dominated by the interplay between these four elements. Mercifully enough, the precise details of much of the next two years or so need not concern us here: suffice to say that, under the influence of such relatively moderate figures as Count Mirabeau and Antoine Barnave, France was transformed into a cons"
