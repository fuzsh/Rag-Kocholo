        "text": "Show less\n\nCollection by Charles PIERRE (1935 - 2004)\n\nan enlightened amateur of popular imagery\n\n# #\n\nPhilippe and Aymeric Rouillac are pleased to present at the auction an exceptional collection of so-called \"popular\" images, which were sold in every home in Europe for more than 400 years, but which are now so forgotten and rare. This quality collection includes woodcut or intaglio prints from the largest production centres in France (Orléans, Chartres, Toulouse, Paris, Lille, Cambrai, Metz, Belfort, Épinal, etc) and Europe (Germany, Italy, Spain, etc).\n\nBorn on 22 October 1935 in Lorraine, Charles PIERRE spent most of his life in Longuyon (Meurthe-et-Moselle), where his parents ran a business in tableware and decorative objects. At the age of 17, his father's untimely death forced him to cut short his studies: he took a BTS in optics in Morez in the Jura, where he met his future wife, who gave him four children. After three years of military service in Algeria, he opened his own optical store in Longuyon in 1965. He is highly appreciated in his profession and actively participates in local life (municipal councillor, president of the commercial union).\n\nFrom a very young age, Charles PIERRE built up an important library, dealing with religion, travel, art in general and other thematic documentation.\n\nA member of the \"Vieux Papier\", he attends the association's meetings regularly.\n\nIn January 2001, Charles PIERRE retired, allowing him to devote himself to his family (four children, seven grandchildren) and also to his collections. Among other things, he had a rare complete series of the lame Messenger, the famous almanac published by Le Roux in Strasbourg. He and his wife did not hesitate to lend this collection so that scientific works could be published in Le Vieux Papier after a detour to an international conference in Sydney.\n\nAn experienced bibliophile, he had taken an interest in several contemporary engravers. But his main passion was popular art, especially religious imagery in all its forms (engraved wood, gutters, fixed under glass...). He had also collected a beautiful collection of popular almanacs.\n\nCharles PIERRE was particularly welcoming and opened his collections to everyone.\n\nDominique Lerch, historian, author of many books on popular imagery of the East, who knew him well, testifies: \"From his travels, he came back with his annual greetings card, opening onto the vast world of paper\".\n\nThe family table was neat and warm. Charles PIERRE and his wife were unwavering supporters of Jura and Bordeaux wines.\n\nThe tribute paid to him by Le Vieux Papier at the time of his death in 2004 stated: \" Very assiduous at our dinners, our travels and the AMIS meetings at Le Saulchoir, Mr. and Mrs. PIERRE had become, for many of us, loyal friends whom we enjoyed meeting\"."
