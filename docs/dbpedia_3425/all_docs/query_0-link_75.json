        "text": "Most of Ireland’s exchequer records from the Middle Ages were destroyed in 1922. But even before that disaster, the survival rate was poor for two series of records produced by the Exchequer of Receipt or ‘lower exchequer, namely the Issue Rolls (which recorded outgoing disbursements or payments) and the Receipt rolls (which recorded incoming proffers or payments). In this context, the recent identification in a manuscript at the College of Arms (London) of extracts taken from a lost Irish Issue Roll from the first regnal year of King Henry V (1413–14) is doubly welcome. The extracts serve as a supplement to Connolly’s important calendar of Irish Exchequer Payments; they also shed light on an eventful year in Ireland’s past.\n\nThe remains of medieval London’s fortifications testify to the city’s military power, but its real strength lay in its manpower. Anecdotal evidence suggests that throughout the Middle Ages, many of London’s men kept armor and weapons close at hand. London did not have a civic arsenal, so the mayor and aldermen relied on men to have their own equipment when called upon to perform military service. To ensure that men were well equipped, the aldermen periodically assessed them. However, there is little evidence that the resulting muster rolls, in which scribes documented such reviews of the civic militia, were archived in London during the thirteenth century. The rolls were records produced at a local level, in the various wards, which had little tradition of maintaining archives; moreover, the records themselves were of only transient value, since they were superseded and replaced as soon as the next muster was held. Yet, remarkably, one partial set of muster rolls survives, and they offer scholars a rare opportunity to investigate the composition and equipment of a thirteenth-century civic militia.\n\nCreated in a period of political transition, as England moved from the end of Henry III’s reign towards that of Edward I, British Library Add. MS. 30079 is an important witness to the historical events of the late thirteenth century. This manuscript was one of the first chronicle rolls written in Latin recording the history of England through a genealogy of its kings, a model which would then acquire popularity in the Anglo-Norman world during the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. An investigation surrounding the manuscript’s context of origin will show how Add. MS. 30079 can be a relevant source for a broader historical analysis of the period. This paper considers the dating and provenance of this chronicle roll, putting particular emphasis on the implications of scribal choices and of the circumstances of manuscript transmission.\n\nThe National Archives in London holds many rolls produced by or for the Exchequer in the thirteenth century which have received little attention. These rolls were used in the process of compiling the pipe rolls, the great annual summaries of debts owing and paid. By the mid-thirteenth century, there was a complex system of interlocking records to track the flow of cash from the agencies of government throughout the country. These preliminary records survive in sufficient quantity to provide a better understanding of how the Exchequer worked. Each type of record is different, in format and level of detail, but they can all be related to the summarized details entered in the pipe rolls. In many cases, the locally-produced rolls have been marked up and amended, to show the process of checking and calculation at the Exchequer. This paper gives examples of: manorial records, produced by escheators and by administrators of vacant dioceses; sheriffs’ particulars, showing the revenues which made up the county farm, and the expenditure by the sheriff on behalf of central government; estreat rolls, conveying details of amercements recorded in plea rolls; and records of the exchanges, such as the rolls of silver purchases, showing how silver was acquired for minting. The Exchequer also tried to slim down the pipe rolls, by removing detail into separate rolls, the rotulus pullorum and the rotulus de corporibus. These too can help us to understand the procedures of the Exchequer as it tried to establish a reasonably efficient and honest system of collecting and checking the government’s revenues. This paper began as a talk at a Heidelberg university conference, the proceedings of which have now been published as an open access book."
