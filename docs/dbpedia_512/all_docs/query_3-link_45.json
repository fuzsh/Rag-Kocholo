        "text": "March 2022 – August 2024\n\nLast updated: July 2024\n\nFebruary 24, 2024, marked two years since the brutal invasion of Ukraine. Two years on and over 14.6 million people are still in need of assistance. All Hands and Hearts (AHAH) is on the ground, providing critical support to internally displaced people (IDPs) in Western Ukraine. We are addressing the ongoing need for safe shelter for displaced families and individuals, while developing new engagement programs in response to the communities’ needs.\n\nFind details about volunteering in Ukraine here.\n\nUzhhorod, within Zakarpatska Oblast in Western Ukraine, is under significant pressure due to the rapid influx of IDPs who are seeking shelter. Over 113,000 registered IDPs reside in the Zakarpatska region, and more are expected to flee from conflict zones as the war persists. Uzhhorod needs support to provide safe shelter for displaced families and individuals.\n\nAll Hands and Hearts is working with Uzhhorod University, which supports IDP intakes. Our team identified four buildings to renovate to provide living spaces for families. In conjunction with the construction work, we are running various engagement activities, including English and art lessons.\n\nIn June, the team officially completed 13 rooms at Uzhhorod University, with renovations nearing completion in two more rooms. Following mold sanitation, repainting, rewiring and reflooring, the rooms have been converted into safe living spaces for IDPs, and are already accommodating families.\n\nWe’ve increased our volunteer requests and staff team to make a greater impact, allowing us to finish more rooms and expand our work scope. This increase enables us to build a work queue, reaching more IDPs and community members by the end of August. The team has received the green light to work on four additional buildings at Uzhhorod University, expanding our impact beyond Buildings 1 and 2.\n\nAfter eight years, the conflict between Russia and Ukraine saw a major escalation when Russia invaded Ukraine on February 24, 2022. Thousands have been killed, injured and forced to flee to neighboring countries. Two years after the invasion, the war persists and the devastating impacts on Ukrainian civilians continue. In 2023, approximately 17.6 million people required humanitarian assistance; in 2024, 14.6 million still seek support.\n\nThe war has created the largest refugee crisis in Europe since the Second World War. According to the UNHCR, as of January 2024, 6.3 million refugees have fled Ukraine globally. Poland has welcomed the greatest number of Ukrainian refugees, receiving nearly 60% of all refugees from Ukraine."
