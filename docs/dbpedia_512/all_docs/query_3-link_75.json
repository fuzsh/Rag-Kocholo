        "text": "ISIDA Clinic is the largest women's health and family planning center in Ukraine. Our story started more than 29 years ago, and from the very beginning, the main direction was infertility treatment with the help of modern ART technologies.\n\nIn March we opened a new department of ISIDA-IVF in Uzhhorod, Western Ukraine. Situated at the border with Slovakia, this city allows us to safely accept our foreign patients almost every day, without any risk to their life and health. Taking to account current logistic struggles in travelling to Ukraine, the city of Uzhhorod is also very convenient to come to.\n\nThe clinic operates in accordance with European treatment protocols while maintaining an individual approach to each patient. The long-term experience has shown how important it is for the families to not only get pregnant but also to be able to carry the pregnancy and deliver a healthy baby. To make this possible, the clinic has a female counseling center, maternity and neonatal departments.\n\nCurrently, over 800 employees, including 198 experienced doctors, are working in the ISIDA clinic. ISIDA comprises four Kyiv-based clinics and one department in Uzhhorod, Western Ukraine, with a total area of 10,000 m2. Every building has the most advanced diagnostic, laboratory, and medical equipment.\n\nFor 29 years of work, more than 200,000 people from 110 countries of the world have chosen ISIDA services.\n\nWhy do international patients choose ISIDA?\n\nExperience and experts\n\nFor over 25 years of work, the ISIDA team has gained extensive experience that brings more than 16,000 babies into this world.\n\nNo waiting list\n\nISIDA Clinic provides a patient with an opportunity to start treatment without waiting.\n\nPackage prices\n\nThe clinic offers standard packages, including donor preparation, medications, etc. Thus a patient can plan own budget and not be required to pay any additional fees.\n\nStrict confidentiality\n\nThe team guarantees highly confidentiality of every patient requesting any medical services.\n\nContact ISIDA-IVF for an initial consultation with a fertility specialist who will tell you all details of IVF and write your individual treatment plan!"
