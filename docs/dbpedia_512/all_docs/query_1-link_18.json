        "text": "During the last months of 1918 profound political and social changes took place throughout the Austro-Hungarian Empire. After the dissolution of Habsburg administrative authority in late October, Poles, Ukrainians, Czechs, Slovaks, Serbs, Croats, and Rumanians organized national councils that eventually were to determine the political future of these former subject peoples. Ruthenians living in the northeastern counties of Hungary also participated in this process, and from November 1918 to May 1919 they formed many councils which proposed various political alternatives: autonomy within Hungary, complete independence, or union with Russia, the Ukraine, or the new state of Czechoslovakia. Although these choices reflected the political and cultural allegiances that were traditionally attractive to Ruthenian leaders, the particular international situation in 1919 proved favorable to only one—union with Czechoslovakia.\n\n1. The Ruthenians have historically been known by many different names: Rusyns, Uhro-Rusyns, Carpatho-Russians, Carpatho-Ukrainians, and so forth. At the suggestion of the editor, the name Ruthenian is used here as an English equivalent for Rusyn, the term employed most often by the inhabitants and their cultural leaders. The present-day official designation, Ukrainian, has only recently come to have widespread use among the population.\n\n2. The term Subcarpathian Ruthenia is meant to describe all territory inhabited by Ruthenians living south of the Carpathians—regions which today comprise the northern half of the Transcarpathian Oblast of the Ukrainian SSR and the Presov Region (Priashevshchyna) in northeastern Czechoslovakia. Subcarpathian (below the Carpathi ans) suggests geographical location, and Ruthenia—the English rendering of Rus1—the national and religious affiliation of the people.\n\n3. The names of pre-1918 counties are given in the official language of the time, Hungarian; names of towns and cities in Ukrainian or Slovak, depending on present location. (The former Hungarian form is given in parenthesis.) As for persons, the version of the name will reflect the form favored by that person himself in his writings; hence the Russian form for the Russophile Beskid; the Ukrainian for the Ukrainophile Komarnytskyi; the Hungarian for the Magyarone Stefan. Names of Rusyn-American leaders follow the form used in Latin-alphabet emigre publications. The adjective rus'kix is rendered as Ruthenian, russkii as Russian. Transliteration of Ruthenian dialectal publications follows the Library of Congress pattern for Ukrainian with the following addition: i = i.\n\n4. Initially, Slovak leaders represented the Ruthenians in Vienna, but the latter sent their own delegation on October 18, 1849, and petitioned the government to create administrative districts according to nationality, to introduce the Ruthenian language in schools, and to appoint Ruthenian officials. Union with the Galician Ruthenians would be postponed until a more opportune time. In 1861 Slovaks and Ruthenians again cooperated closely and presented a joint petition to Vienna. The documents are found in Daniel Rapant, Slovenske povstanie roku 1848-49, 5 vols, in 12 (Bratislava, 1937-68), 4, pt. 3: 173-74. A solid discussion of these and other nineteenth-century Ruthenian developments is given by Ivan, Zeguc, Die nationalpolitischen Bestrebungen der Karpato-Ruthenen, 1848-1914 (Wiesbaden, 1965), pp. 32 ffGoogle Scholar. For a survey of the extensive literature on this problem see Paul R. Magocsi, “An Historiographical Guide to Subcarpathian Rus', “ Austrian History Yearbook, vol. 9-10 (1974).\n\n6. Russophiles, or Muscophiles, were those persons in Galicia, Bukovina, and Subcarpathian Ruthenia (a territorial unit they called Carpathian Russia) who claimed that the local inhabitants were of Russian nationality and who favored the adoption of the Russian literary language and Russian cultural patterns. Similarly, Ukrainophiles were natives of these territories who considered Ruthenians to be Ukrainians. They formed a Ukrainian literary language based on local dialects and propagated the use of this medium, not Russian, for educational and cultural affairs.\n\n7. Ukrainian writers (both Soviet and non-Soviet) suggest that these contacts with Galicia are indicative of Ukrainian national feeling in Subcarpathian Ruthenia. This was hardly the case. Indeed, Dukhnovych did believe that “those on the other side of the mountains are not foreign,” yet at the same time he made clear: “Excuse me, brothers, if I am insulting someone, but I must truthfully say that your Ukrainian stories are not in good taste… . I don't understand by what means you could so quickly change the pure Ruthenian language to Ukrainian.” From an article in Viestnik … Rusinov avstriiskoi dershavy, no. 11 (Vienna, 1863), cited in Kyrylo Studyns'kyi, “Aleksander Dukhnovych i Halychyna: Studiia,” Naukovyi Zbornyk tovarystva ‘Prosvita, ’ 3 (1924): 92.\n\n9. Among the more influential Ukrainians were Volodymyr Hnatiuk, who wrote six volumes on Subcarpathian Ruthenian ethnography, and Mykhailo Drahomaniv, the national leader from the Russian Ukraine. Subcarpathian Ruthenians responded with respect to the interest expressed by their eastern brethren, but they clearly indicated displeasure with the idea of Ukrainian nationalism. For several explicitly anti-Ukrainian statements by the Subcarpathian intelligentsia see Nedziel'sky, Evgenii, Ocherk karpatorusskoi literature (Uzhhorod, 1932), pp. 256–57 Google Scholar.\n\n10. The Greek Catholic or Uniat Church was established in 1595 for Ruthenians living in Poland and in 1642 for those in Subcarpathian Ruthenia. The Roman hierarchical system was adopted, although most of the eastern (Orthodox) traditions were maintained. A “return to Orthodoxy movement,” financed by Russian rubles and Ruthenian-American immigrant dollars, began in Subcarpathian Ruthenia in the late nineteenth century, but was restricted in size because of persecution by the Hungarian government, which in the years before 1914 had come to equate conversion to Orthodoxy with state treason.\n\n16. M. Tvorydlo analyzed fifty-five completed questionnaires which he had in hand. As for remaining with Hungary, fifty-one were opposed, two were for it, and two abstained. In response to whether union with Rus’ (Ukraine) was desired, twenty-eight were favorable, twenty wanted complete independence, two were for Hungary, five were for the Ukraine—but, if not possible, for Czechoslovakia. These figures are only a sample, since it is not known how many questionnaires were completed and returned to Nevytskyi. Ortoskop, Dershavni zmahannia, pp. 11-12.\n\n22. The occurrence of anti-Hungarian activity prompted Antonii Papp, the progovernment Bishop of Uzhhorod, to send to all his priests a circular which requested that they aid in controlling the “secret agitation for union with the Ukraine or Czechoslovakia “ as well as the “anti-Christian Social-Democratic radical agitation.” The appeal was dated Uzhhorod, November 28, 1918, and is reprinted in Ortoskop, Derzhavni smahannia, pp. 22-23, and in an edited version in Taiemne staie iavnym ﹛Dokwnenty pro antynarodmi diial'nisf tserkovnykiv na Zakarpatti v period okupatsii) (Uzhhorod, 1965), doc. 51.\n\n25. The Slovaks also promised “full autonomy” in ecclesiastical and educational affairs as well as the establishment of a university in the near future. “Proclamation of the Slovak National Council, Turciansky Sv. Martin, November 30, 1918,” reprinted in Peska and Markov, “Prispevek,” pp. 527-28. See also Medvecky, Karol A., Slovensky Prevrat, 4 vols. (Trnava, 1930-31), 1: 60–61 Google Scholar. The failure to fulfill these promises was to be a source of constant friction between Ruthenian leaders and the Czechoslovak government.\n\n31. Ukrainian leaders claim that at the October 19 meeting of the National Council in Lviv a letter from Subcarpathian leaders (unnamed) was read; it concluded with the request: “You, our brethren, must stand behind us and unite with us. Our people demand such salvation so that finally we can be liberated from the yoke of another people.” Cited in a work by the Chairman of the Lviv National Council, Kost Levyts'kyi, Velykyi sryv: Do istorii ukrains'koi derzhavnosty vid beresnia do lystopada 1918 r. na pidstavi spomyniv ta dokumentiv (Lviv, 1931), p. 118. See also Lozyns'kyi, Mykhailo, Halychyna v rr. 1918-1920 (Vienna, 1922), p. 29 Google Scholar. No work by a Subcarpathian author, however, has mentioned the sending of a letter to Lviv as early as October 1918.\n\n37. Despite aid from the West Ukrainian Republic, leaders like Vasyl Klempush emphasized that the “Hutsuls [term used by the local Ruthenians] themselves created the uprising and not the Galicians. Our Hutsul National Council decided to break away from Hungary and unite with the Ukraine.” See Shtefan, , Ukrains'ke pits'ko, pp. 11–21Google Scholar; Smiian, , Zhovtneva revoliutsiia, pp. 55–59Google Scholar; “Hutsulska Republyka,” Nedilia Rusyna, 1 (1923): 54-55, 59-60.\n\n39. Manifesto reprinted in Peska and Markov, “Prispevek,” pp. 531-32. The anti- Ukrainianism of Beskid and his Galician allies was emphasized: “We consider the separatism of Ukrainian politicians a temporary phenomenon—anti-Slavic, anticultural, and antisocial—a product of Austro-German imperialism.” The decision of the Presov Council was opposed by former chairman Nevytskyi, who issued proclamations the same day calling for union with the Ukraine. Reprinted in Ortoskop, Derzhavni smahannia, pp. 14-16. Despite Nevytskyi's rhetoric calling for the Ukraine, his discontent was not motivated by displeasure with the Russophile attitude of the Presov Manifesto, but rather with the usurpation of the Council's leadership by Beskid and his supporters.\n\n45. The activity of Ruthenian-American immigrants is analyzed by Victor S. Mamatey, “The Slovaks and Carpatho-Ruthenians,” in Joseph P. O' Grady, , ed., The Immigrant's Influence on Wilson's Peace Policies (Lexington, 1967), pp. 224–49 Google Scholar; Joseph Danko, “Plebiscite of Carpatho-Ruthenians in the United States Recommending Union of Carpatho- Ruthenia with the Czechoslovak Republic,” Annals of the Ukrainian Academy of Arts and Sciences, 11, nos. 1-2 (1964-68): 184-207; and Hanak, Walter K., The Subcarpathian- Ruthenian Question: 1918-1945 (Munhall, Pa., 1962), pp. 7–13 Google Scholar.\n\n58. “Despite the relatively short period of existence of Soviet rule in the Mukachevo area … its importance was very great… . [Soviet rule] was an important moral and political victory for Bolshevik ideas… . The age-long struggle of the workers of Transcarpathia against the internal exploiters and external counterrevolutionaries came to a close in late October 1944 with the liberation of Transcarpathia from fascist occupation by the heroic Red Army and the union with the Soviet Ukraine.” See M. V., Troian, “Borot'ba trudiashchykh Mukachivshchyny za Radians'ku vladu v 1918-1919 rr.,” Naukovi Zapysky, 30 (1957): 83-84Google Scholar.\n\n59. Ibid., p. 76. There is no indication in Soviet or other sources that the decrees were greeted with favor by the local populace, and it is quite likely that the forced acquisition of foodstuffs (Shliakhom Zhovtnia, vol. 1, docs. 89-91, 109, 112, 128) was opposed by the peasantry.\n\n64. Kmitsikevych claims that Beskid was present on May 8, but this is not borne out by the protocols or by another participant, Zsatkovich, who reported that Beskid remained in Presov awaiting (in vain) to be called by the government to Prague. See “Uriadovyi report Amerykanskoi Komyssii Rusynov,” Amierykanskii Russkii Vistnyk, July 3, 1919.\n\n65. Protocol of May 8 in Karpatorusskije Novosti, May 15, 1944. The pro-Czechoslovak Presov National Council had all along demanded union with the non-Ukrainophile Galician Ruthenians (or Lemkians as they were called). See the Presov Council resolutions of January 7 and 31, 1919, and memorandum of May 1, 1919, addressed to President Wilson: reprinted in Peska and Markov, “PHspevek,” pp. 531-34. Similar demands were formulated by Beskid in a memorandum dated March 12, 1919, to the Czechoslovak government (reprinted in Boj o smer, vol. 1, doc. 54) and one dated April 20, 1919, to the Entente powers: Anthony Beskid and Dimitry Sobin, The Origin of the Lems, Slavs of Danubtan Provenance: Memorandum to the Peace Conference Concerning Their National Claims (no date or place of publication). The second document clearly defined territorial demands which did not include all of Galicia but only the lands of the non-Ukrainian “Russes des Carpathes (Lemki) “—an area north of the Carpathians stretching roughly from Lubovna in the west to Uzhhorod in the east. The farthest northern extent included the Galician towns of Dukla and Sanok.\n\n70. Masaryk originally expected the area would be part of a united Russia. He claimed that only in 1917, during his stay in Kiev, was the problem “discussed many times” with Ukrainian leaders. Supposedly the latter “had no objection to the unification of Subcarpathian Ruthenia with us.” See Masaryk, Tomas G., Svetovd revoluce sa vdlky a ve valce, 1914-1918 (Prague, 1938), p. 290 Google Scholar. Curiously, none of the Ukrainian leaders (D. Doroshenko, P. Khrystiuk, A. Margolin, I. Mazepa, V. Petriv, V. Vynnychenko) mention in their memoirs any conversation with Masaryk about Subcarpathian Ruthenia. Nor does O. I. Bochkovs'kyi in his informative account of Masaryk in Kiev, T. G. Masaryk: Natsional'na problema ta ukrains'ka pytannia (Podebrady, 1930), pp. 135-53, say anything about discussions regarding the Subcarpathian problem. The silence is intriguing, since subsequently the West Ukrainian and Ukrainian National Republics claimed sovereignty over all “Ukrainians” living south of the Carpathians.\n\n72.

Bratianu (New York, 1962), pp. 127-28. The Polish government demanded only a small part of territory inhabited by Subcarpathian Ruthenians near Lubovna: Commission Polonaise des Travaux Preparatoires au Congres de la Paix, Le Spis2, I'Orawa et le district de Czaca (Warsaw, 1919) and Territoires polonais en Hongrie septentrionale (Paris, 1919)."
