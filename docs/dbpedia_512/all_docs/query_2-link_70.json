Be sure to come in the spring, sakura blossoms will leave you with a lot of positive emotions and a mountain of cool shots.\n\nAs a resident of Uzhgorod, I and my family really did not get tired of walking along the waterfront, it is very comfortable and interesting, and at any time of year it is beautiful.\n\nIn the spring, lindens, sakura trees and magnolias are raging, at this time the smells around are just gorgeous!\n\nDue to the fact that the promenade is not far from the city, the entrance is convenient and there are no problems with parking around. Along the promenades it is comfortable to walk with children of any age and there are convenient paths for scootering, skateboarding, cycling and more. There are also many benches and pretty good views around.\n\nThe center is really not far, where you can go to eat and warm up in a cozy cafe, if the weather for walks is not very good.\n\nMy favorite is the “Cactus”, a restaurant right next to the center and the waterfront. “Cactus” has a “wild west” style with very tasty cuisine and beer with absolutely adequate prices.\n\nThe architecture of Uzhgorod is very similar to Europe, because most of the city’s existence, it was not Ukrainian. If you are interested, you can learn more about it in the blog “Uzhgorod is the pearl of the Carpathians”\n\nUzhgorod is a multinational city, there are Hungarian and Slovak schools in the city, in the photo it is Slovak, it is located not far from the center, towards Calvary.\n\nAdults will be very interesting to walk towards Calvary and climb up, and from there gorgeous views of the surrounding area.\n\nChildren will most likely be bored walking around the city, so you can go with the children to the “Castle Park”, and there from the Philharmonic, along the waterfront you can ride a children’s train.\n\nThe park itself has a lot of attractions and entertainment, there are cafes, benches and even a stadium with a magnificent view of the mountains.\n\nIn summer, go deeper into different parts of Uzhgorod, it’s really cool. If you walk on your own, then walk around Uzhgorod – that’s it, you can move away from the center towards Bozdosh Park or banal – walk towards Uzhgorod Castle, and this is the highest point of the central part of the city, it more than 200 meters above sea level.\n\nIf you have a quadcopter, you can shoot good videos from there, the main thing at the takeoff is not to get into the electrical wires.\n\nOf course, travel more often with families and how to be with children during their stay in Uzhgorod?\n\nIn fact, it is such a problem-free city, where it is not scary to let go of a child’s hand and let him run, and most cafes are equipped with either children’s trampolines or children’s tables. Don’t you believe? Check it out for yourself!\n\nIf you walk towards Bozdosh Park, you can find a mineral spring with natural soda water and a high iron content.\n\nOr in the direction of Pidzamkovy Park, where there is a lot of children’s entertainment, and adults will find it interesting to look at an old and large tree – the Western Platan, its homeland – North America. According to Terletsky V., Fodor S. sycamore sapling was imported from Italy in 1610 by Count Druget (then the Lord of Uzhgorod Castle). This is the original specimen introduced to Central Europe. It is called the “Memorial Tree of Transcarpathia”.\n\nUzhgorod is rich in its history, because for 1000 years of existence a lot has happened and there have been many different rulers. Only after the Second World War Uzhhorod became part of Transcarpathian Ukraine.\n\nThis means that the majority of the population speaks other languages. Popular here: Hungarian, Slovak, Romanian, Russian and Ukrainian. And indeed almost every resident understands all these languages.\n\nSince the city is rich in history, of course there are quite interesting museums in the city.\n\nBelow is the main list of museums in Uzhgorod with links to their detailed description:\n\nUzhhorod Museum of Fedir Manailo\n\nTranscarpathian Museum of Local Lore named after Tyvodar Lehotsky\n\nTranscarpathian Art Museum named after Joseph Bokshay\n\nUzhgorod Castle. Legends and stories\n\nUzhhorod open-air museum"
