        "text": "Note: This article is put forward as a grand overview of historical names for Rusyns and their homeland and is intended as a reference as much as a work of prose. As a result, the following table of contents can help navigate:\n\nIntroduction\n\n“I come from nowhere.” Those mystifying words of Andy Warhol have both simultaneously illustrated and also haunted the reality of Rusyn cultural awareness in the diaspora.\n\nWe should not however laugh at these words, as regardless of his intentions, whether he said it in humility, to seem mysterious, or even as a joke, we mustn’t forget that in all likelihood, like so many other Rusyns, Warhol very likely struggled to understand concretely from whence came his family and his roots.\n\nWithout making assumptions, we may say that Warhol certainly wasn’t trying to imply with these words, that one day he literally materialized ex nihilo out of the land of oblivion. Rather he was faced with the dilemma which has tormented millions of Rusyns.\n\nHow does one understand and describe where they are from when it is not contained within a single country when its borders have changed dramatically over the last century alone when one’s people have never really had a distinct self-contained state when one is born across the ocean from their ancestral land to parents who possibly identified as anything from Russian to Hungarian and from Greeks to Uniates. One could literally be faced with an issue where their parents were born in different states from both each other and their own parents and grandparents, even if they were all born in the same exact land or villages. One could be an Orthodox Christian and call themselves a Russian Greek Catholic or one could be a Uniate and call themselves Orthodox.\n\nThis was a reality for many people. In the case of Mr. Warhol, his parents were born in the Austro-Hungarian Empire, though they would have been neither Austrian nor Hungarian. And at the time he uttered the famous phrase, their land was likely already Czechoslovakia, though they were neither Czechs nor Slovaks and most likely, many from this land would be called Russian in America, even if the people never set foot in the Russian Empire or the lands of modern Russia.\n\nSo, what is the fate of Andy Warhol’s people from nowhere? Shall we just accept they are from “nowhere”, and forget about it.\n\nNo. Warhol was wrong. These people are not from nowhere, they have a home, these people are not nameless, they gave a name, these people are not fatherless and orphaned, they are children of God. And as sure as God has protected them through the storms of the ages, by this protection, and that of the Theotokos, may they never forget that they were, are, and will forever be Rusyns. This is their name, and may it be forever known that Carpathian Rus’ is their home.\n\nIn a previous article, we discussed how the idea of Holy Rus’ — a national calling to holiness in Christ — is the most important national idea of the Rusyn people. It’s their spiritual homeland.\n\nNow, considering the many names for Rusyns and their lands, and also the disinformation, in this article, let’s examine these names in detail, and discuss their history, and meaning to Rusyns throughout the ages. To get to the root of these issues, we have to start at the beginning of the story.\n\nThe Tale of the Bygone Years\n\nWhile it is not good, nor just, to say that Rusyns come from nowhere, but if we instead change Warhol’s words from a statement into a question, this changes matters. There is no shame in not knowing, and asking where one comes from. In fact, “Where do I come from?” may indeed be the most Rusian of questions.\n\nIt is essentially with these words, that the first history of Rus’ peoples’ begins. The Primary Chronicle of Saint Nestor of Kiev begins with the immortal words:\n\nOr in English:\n\n“This is the tale of the bygone years, from whence came the lands of Rus’, where in Kiev the first princes ruled, and from what source the lands of Rus’ have their origin.”\n\nRus’ is the keyword here, as it is from this word that essentially all our other names, including Rusyn, have their origin. Before we examine the names of the people, let’s look at the various names for Rus’, as we will find, like all things in our history, even this is a matter of great controversy…\n\nNational Names\n\nRus’\n\nThis story begins with Rus’ and the East Slavic tribes, a brief history would be as follows.\n\nRus’ history traditionally begins with the landing of Rurik in 862 A.D., Rurik, and his folk were Varangians, essentially Norse Vikings from Scandinavia. Rus’ was baptized and became Christian under Rurik’s great-grandson Saint Vladimir (In Church Slavonic spelling; In Old East Slavic: Volodimer; In Old Norse: Valdamarr) of Kiev in 988 A.D., after receiving the faith “from the Greeks,” i.e. from the Roman Empire in Constantinople.\n\nThe first Metropolitan of Rus’ was St. Michael of Kiev, a Syrian. Here it should be noted that Carpathian Rus’, in the opinion of most scholars,[1][2][3] was baptized prior to the Kievan Baptism, by Greek Saints Cyril and Methodius, during their mission to the Slavs beginning around 862, around the same time the pagan Rus’ landed at Novgorod. Most Orthodox Christians generally connect both the earlier Cyrillo-Methodian mission in Carpathian Rus’, and the later Baptism of Kievan Rus’ together, and celebrate them as part of a single Russian (i.e. Rusian) Orthodox tradition.[4]\n\nThis does essentially mean, however, Carpathian Rus’ was Christian prior to the Kievan Baptism, which already sets her apart. By this logic some claim that Rusyns, being descendants of autochthonous Carpathian peoples, like White Croats and Vlachs, are not in fact, from the same Rus’ branch as the historical Kievans or Volhynians, or modern-day Ukrainians, Russians, and Belarusians, but that Rusyns simply received their name from them. This is one theory, not truly that of this author, and beyond the scope of this article, however, it’s worth mentioning.\n\nIt should also be worth noting that the identity of the early Rus’ peoples is debated, though they were likely Scandinavians who formed a warrior elite among the East Slavs who later took their name; in any case, they were not the only tribe of East Slavs, but merely absorbed the others such as Drevlians and Volhynians.\n\nThough initially ruled primarily from Kiev, the Rus’ would be devastated and even “ruined” by the Mongol Invasion, and by 1360, they were already divided into two distinct halves, the north-east and the south-west. This now becomes the story of how we went from both Rus’ to Russia and Rus’ to Ruthenia respectively.\n\nRuthenia\n\nSimply put, South-Western Rus’ would come under the rule of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth (the Rzeczpospolita). Subcarpathian Rus’ was already under the Hungarian crown at this time. Due to this western influence, the Rus’ lands in the Rzeczpospolita would come to be known, especially in academic terms, as Ruthenia, which is a Latin word for Rus’ or even Russia. Ruthenia is largely synonymous with South-Western Rus’, especially, though not exclusively, during the Polish-Lithuanian, or Austro-Hungarian periods. The Ruthenian ideal outcome would have been to achieve a commonwealth of three nations (Rzeczpospolita trojga narodów), Poles, Lithuanians, and Rusyns.\n\nThis however fell short of realization, with the death of great figures such as St. Peter Mohyla, Adam Kisiel, and King Władysław of Poland, and the rise of tragic internecine wars; the rights of the Orthodox Ruthenians were not respected, and a deluge of violence from all sides erupted, flooding down on the common folk, who as always, are the ones hurt the most in wars started by power-hungry rulers. The situation was best described by the great writer Henryk Sienkiewicz, we feel no better words have been written to illustrate the fall of the Commonwealth, and Ruthenia with it, and thus, we will end this history of Ruthenia with them:\n\nIn English: Hatred grew in the hearts of men and poisoned the blood of brotherly peoples. And for a long time, no lips could exchange the words: “Glory to God in the highest, and on earth, peace to people of goodwill.”\n\nIn Polish: Nienawiść wrosła w serca i zatruła krew pobratymczą – i żadne usta długo nie mówiły: „Chwała na wysokościach Bogu, a na ziemi pokój ludziom dobrej woli”\n\nIn Lemko: Ненавист вросла в серця люди і отровила кров братніх народів — і долгій час жадны уста не казали: «Слава во вышніх Богу, і на земли мир людям доброй волі».\n\nRussia\n\nNorth-Eastern Rus’ would consolidate initially around Vladimir-Suzdal and later completely under the firm rule of Muscovy, which would form the Russian Centralized State (российскоецентрализованноегосударство) or RCS (РЦГ) as it’s known in Muscovite Russian histography. This process is also called in Russian histography the “gathering of the Russian lands.”\n\nHere a great issue arises over the names Rus’ and Russia and their relationship. The issue is exacerbated in English due to language barriers. Whereas “Russia” is essentially Rus’ with an added “s” and the typical suffix -ia, essentially meaning Russland, as in the German, in the Slavic languages themselves, we see a different word used for “Russia”, as in the contemporary country—Rossia or Россія. [5]\n\nHere is where the grand debate begins between all sides, Russophiles, Moscophiles, Ukrainophiles, all argue over the meaning and relation of this word to Rus’.\n\nThe historical reality is this word simply comes from the Greek word for Rus’— Ρωσσία. Essentially, just as Ruthenia is Latin for Rus’, Rossia is Greek for the same.\n\nThe Moscovite state adapted the Greek form after Ivan the Great to emphasize the Byzantine connection and the idea of “Moscow — the Third Rome’”, and later, this form would be fermented by Peter the Great by naming Russia the Russian (Rossiiskaya) Empire (Россійская Имперія). Interestingly enough, he took the Greek name for Russia but imported the Latin word for empire in place of the Slavic Czardome (Czarstwo), and from 1721 onward to this day, Rossia or Россія would become the name of the polity, while the people are remained known as Russians or Russkie.\n\nIt is very important to understand that in a literal philological sense, whether we say Rus’, Russia, Rossia, or Ruthenia, we are expressing the exact same concept, the same name, simply in different languages.\n\nTo say that Rossia is a foreign name unrelated to Rus’ would be like saying Saint Petersburg is not in Rossia, it’s in Russia. It would be like saying the Colosseum isn’t in Rome, it’s in Roma.\n\nHowever, we should understand that languages do evolve as we use them. And in modern contexts, when we say Russia or Rossia, most people will rightly associate these words with the lands of the modern Russian Federation, i.e. the north-eastern part of Rus’ which consolidated and formed the Russian Centralized State around Moscovy. The Rossia form in Slavic is almost always associated only with this North-Eastern Moscovite part of Rus’.\n\nThis does not mean, however, that Russia (with a double “s”) has never been applied to the Ruthenian lands. We should remember that in many ways, especially in the understanding of the majority of Europe, there was a time when Galicia was understood as “Russia”, and the successor of Kievan Rus’, and the north-eastern Russian state was often known, (externally and in Ruthenia), as Moscovia. This is illustrated by the famous map of Sebastian Münster, published in 1552 A.D., “Polonia et Ungaria XX Nova Tabula” (a new map of Poland and Hungary).\n\nOn the map, we see that the Galician land around Lwów (Leopolis), is known as RVSSIA (Russia), whereas in the northeast, we see Moscovia and Rvssia Alba (White Russia). Note that White Rus’/Russia is a translation of the Slavic “Belarus’” or “Belorussia”[6] and can also refer to this land, which was historically part of Lithuanian Rus’ and Ruthenia, and whose people are also “Ruthenians”. The map above has been reprinted in other contemporary sources, for example, this rare colored version.\n\nIt is worth noting these are works of a German cartographer depicting the lands of the Rzeczpospolita and Moscovia. We can certainly not accuse him of bias in favor of Rusyns, for naming Galicia “Russia”, this simply reflects the common understanding of the time, that this land, formerly the Kingdom of Rus’, belongs to—well, Rus’. And a common Latin form for the land of Rus’ is Russia.\n\nIn the very significant map “Ukrania quae et Terra Cosaccorum cum vicinis Walachiae, Moldoviae…” (Ukraine the land of the Cossacks, Wallachia, Moldova…), published in Nuremberg in 1720, we find the geographical terms Ukraine (Ukraina), close together with “Red Russia” (Russia Rubra)[7], and Moscovia off to the side.\n\nSee also the 1507 Map “Polonia Minor​; Russia” by Martin Waldseemüller. This helps to demonstrate that although it is not the exclusive form, the word “Russia” though not necessarily Rossia, can indeed be applied with historical accuracy to South-Western Rus’, and can appear in sources this way.\n\nConcerning Rossia, it is far more out of context to apply this word to these lands. There are exceptions, however, of this word being applied even in South-Western Rus’.\n\nFor example, a facsimile copy of the Kievan Trebnik of Saint Peter Mohyla surprisingly renders his title as “Metropolitan of Kiev, Galicia, all Russia”[8], “vseja Rossii—with the “o” form and the double “s” (всеѧ̀ Рꙍ́ссїи), as opposed to the more common and expected “of all Rus’”.\n\nIt is both peculiar and very interesting that this example uses the Rossia “o” form, which is rather anomalous to South-Western Rus’. This however is just that, an exception to a general rule, though if we observe closely, it is not really the omicron “o” form; rather the omega form “ώ”.\n\nWe should note that the Slavonic form used, is written with the omega, emphasizing the fact that this word is taken from the Greek word for Rus’—which is Ῥῶς or Ρωσσία. It is very interesting to note that in modern Greek, Ρωσσία/Russia is spelled Ρωσία (Rosia), with one sigma “s”. This means that when say Rossia in this (old Greek) context, we are talking about the same word as Rus’, simply translated into a different language, i.e. whether we say Rus’, Russia, Ῥῶς, Ρωσσία, or Ruthenia, we are in fact expressing the same concept, just in different languages!\n\nThis does not mean, therefore, that because he is called Metropolitan of all Rossia (Russia in Greek), that his land is the same as Moscovia, that he was the bishop of Moscow or modern Russia. On the contrary, St. Peter Mohyla was not subordinate to Moscow, nor did he live in the Muscovite state. He lived in Poland, served as a Polish knight, and his great-nephew would become the King of Poland. St. Peter was metropolitan of the Kievan Metropolia, essentially the Orthodox Church in the Rzeczpospolita, corresponding to the modern lands of Ukraine, Belarus, and Poland, however, his territory did not include modern Russia.\n\nThis is incredibly important to note, as this indicates that if he was called the Metropolitan of all Russia (Rossia), his territory did not include Muscovite Russia. This means that Rossia, as the Greek form for Rus’ was applied to Kievan lands as well, and moreover, that these lands required no subordination or even attachment to Moscow to constitute in and of themselves “all Russia”. That is to say, the fullness of the Russian soul, i.e. of Rus’ itself, may be found in one member, and even one member can truly be in and of itself—all Rus’. This is possible through the understanding of Rus’ Soborna, which is a term we must return to, however, suffice to say, we have demonstrated how even Rossia can—in the right contexts—be applied to Rus’.\n\nLittle Russia\n\nLittle Russia is a very important historical-geographical for the central former lands centered around Kiev and central Ukraine which were incorporated into the Russian Empire after the Khmelnytskyi Uprising of 1654. Little Russia, in the original language, can be written either Малая Россія (Malaya Rossia), Малороссія (Malorossia), or Малая Русь (Malaya Rus’), and while historically they were more or less synonymous, each of those names have their own context, especially due to the “o” vs “u” dichotomy in the word Rossia/Russia. Inhabitants of Little Russia may be called Little Russians or Малороссіяне or Малороссы.\n\nLittle Russia in the Russian Empire is essentially a synonym for what we would come to call Ukraine today, however, we should note this did not include Galicia or certainly not Carpathia. Even if these people were considered to be part of the “Little Russian nation”, in some historical times, Little Russia proper should refer primarily to the former nucleus of Kievan Rus’ and the Cossack Hetmanate, essentially Dnieper Ukraine or North-Central Ukraine.\n\nBy the 18th and 19th centuries, we may say that what is today modern Ukraine was divided between three cultural regions.\n\nLittle Russia\n\nNew Russia\n\nGalicia-Volhynia\n\nNew Russia refers to the South-Eastern lands, the former “Wild Fields”, once dominated by Asiatic steppe nomads like Tatars, which were never truly integrated into Kievan Rus’ or the Commonwealth, but we’re finally settled by the Cossacks and the Russian Empire and developed by the latter especially under Catherine II. All the major cities in these regions, such as Odesa, Mykolaiv, Kherson, and the Slavic Crimean cities were essentially founded by Catherine the Great and under the direct rule of her centralized Russian state, making these new territories quite different and rather russified compared to the strong Cossack culture of Dnieper Ukraine, the former Kievan Rus’, and the western lands of Galicia in Poland. Just as Ukraine can be divided into three regions, the national idea of the Russian Empire itself became that Russia is three lands, three Russias, Great Russia (modern Russia), Little Russia (Ukraine), and White Russia (Belarus), and thus we hear the term “Czar of all the Russias”.\n\nThe political, cultural, ethnic, linguistic, and even at times religious divide between these regions is so strong, it heavily affects Ukrainian politics to this day. It is often said that Ukraine is like two nations, east, and west, split right down the Dnieper into Left and Right Bank Ukraine’s, but in reality, it is more properly divided into three. Western Ukraine (Galicia-Volhynia), Central Ukraine (Dnieper Ukraine), and South-Eastern Ukraine (Novorossia).\n\nAcknowledging this reality on the ground does not indicate in any way we can’t support Ukraine or her territorial sovereignty today, it merely means we should be conscious of these historical differences and cultural regions and not dismiss them. The voices of both Galicia and Eastern Ukraine must be heard for peace in these lands to be lasting.\n\nUnfortunately, due to modern politics, terms such as Malorossia and Novorossia have become controversial and taken outside of their historical contexts by Russian and Ukrainian nationalism.\n\nIn particular, the term Little Russia and especially “Little Russians”, is often perceived by Ukrainians today as perjurious or belittling to Ukrainians. While it is true that some Russian nationalists may (or may not) use this term to imply Ukrainians are just the “little brothers” to Russians, this is not historical.\n\nThe historical meaning of Little Russia is by no means belittlingly or meant to imply that Ukraine or Ukrainians are lesser than Russia. Specifically, it’s said that Little Russia (Ukraine) is meant to be juxtaposed against Great Russia (modern Russia) thus implying one is greater than the other which is completely untrue and not the intended context.\n\nLittle here is primarily a geographical indicator, meaning southern, or smaller in size, compare this with Asia Minor or (Little Asia).\n\nKrakow, the capital of the Polish Lithuanian Commonwealth located in the region called Little Poland, which is located to the south of greater Poland.\n\nSurely nobody is saying by calling these lands “Little”, the imperial city of Constantinople or the crownlands of Krakow are inferior to the rest of Asia, or Poland.\n\nLittle or lesser does not imply inferior, it means either southern or smaller.\n\nWe should also note that “little” in Slavic languages is often considered a positive or endearing thing. Little Russia can also be understood to mean the heart of, or the essential Rus’, not belittlingly but elevating Little Russia, as if anything, Ukrainians are not the little siblings of Russians, they’re the older siblings!\n\nIt’s important to understand that Little Russia is a term used by the Ukrainian or Cossack inhabitants of the land themselves, not simply a term imposed upon them to take away the name Ukrainian, as in the 17th century, they were not calling themselves Ukrainians but instead Rusyns or Cossacks. For example, Little Russia is used extensively to refer to himself and his people by Gogol, whom Lina Kostenko would note was a “Russian (language) author”, but “a Ukrainian genius.” There is also the famous History of Little Russia, written after 1792, likely up until the 1840s, which extensively uses the term.\n\nThe most important example to illustrate that little Russia was not simply some tool of Muscovite terminology was its extensive use in the Constitution of Philip Orlyk, written in 1710 A.D., which can be read here on the website of the Ukrainian parliament.[9] The constitution is a monumental work in human history, among the first extant documents displaying a modern democratic concept of separation of powers. Orlyk was a Cossack colonel and ally of Ivan Mazepa, who fought for a free and independent Cossack State in “Little Russia”, and was strictly opposed to the Muscovite state.\n\nIn his constitution, by my account, Orlyk uses the term “Ukraine” eight times, and only in a geographical sense,[10] whereas Little Russia[11] appears ten or eleven times[12] in both geographical and national terms.\n\nHe speaks of the “Little Russian Fatherland” (Отчизны Малороссийской),[13] and uses Little Russian as an ethnonym for the people or at least as an adjective.[14]\n\nThis is very important to note as Orlyk can be no means be considered an ally of the Muscovite state he actively fought for freedom against, but he still used the term “Little Russia” in his Constitution, equally or even more times than “Ukraine”, even though he was a hero of and an advocate for the idea of what we would now call a “free and independent Ukraine.” This does not mean we should now call Ukraine “Little Russia”, but it demonstrates even Ukrainophiles may use the term Little Russia historically, and Ukrainians have just as much, if not an even greater responsibility to be true to the name of Holy Rus’, as Rus’ began in what is now Ukraine.[15]\n\nConclusion: Little Russia is a historical term for north and central Ukraine, the former nucleus of the Kievan state, which may also be called Dnieper Ukraine. It may be contrasted historically with Galicia-Volhynia to the west and the region of Novorossia to the south-east. Little Russia was used by its own inhabitants to refer to the southern heart of the historical Rus’ lands, and while it can also be used in the context of Russian nationalism, it was also used by natives of the Ukrainian lands to refer to themselves. As contexts change, today we should not use the term Little Russia or Little Russians to refer to Ukrainians as this is perjurious, and we should respect these people now wish to be identified as Ukrainians, while at the same time, not calling into historical revisionism and ignoring the fact that names such as Rusyn, Cossack, Ruthenian, and Little Russian were real historical terms for the people, prior to the rather late appearance and popularization of the name Ukrainian in essentially the very late 19th and early 20th centuries.\n\nContext is Key\n\nAs a result, we should be aware of context both historic and modern when using these words and their adjective forms.\n\nOften it is the case that it’s easier to say, Russian, when we mean “of Rus’” as opposed to “of modern Russia”. Simply put, saying this is a Rus’ city, or it’s a Rus’ word, or these are Rus’ people does not seem as natural in English as saying “Russian”, however due to misconceptions that can arise, it is valuable to clarify when we mean “Rus’” and when we mean the modern understanding of Russian.\n\nWhen we say the Russian Orthodox Faith, for example, we are referring to the whole faith of Rus’, not just the Muscovite lands.\n\nAnother alternative form worth using and discussing may be Rusian, with one “S”, as this may be a way to form a more natural adjective form for the noun Rus’ while remaining neutral and avoiding politically charged connotations of words such as Russian when applied to Rus’ things outside the territory of modern Russia.\n\nThe great professor and Russian medievalist Dmitry Likhachov,[16] doctor of philological science, once famously described perhaps the greatest issue in Russian history, which is namely the interpretation of that history:\n\nNo other country in the world is cloaked in such contradictory myths about its history as is Russia, and no other nation in the world interprets its history as variously as do the Russian people.[17]\n\nThis may perfectly be applied to all East Slavs, including Carpatho-Rusyns. All East Slavs, essentially all Rusian peoples, have this same scandal or stumbling block in their historiographies—that is few other peoples have so many varying ways to interpret their own history and identity.\n\nThey may consider each other to be the same nation, brothers, or mortal enemies, they may speak each other’s languages natively, and even if Russian is, for all intents and purposes, their primary and best-spoken language, and they do not speak another language at the same level, they may tell you—in native Russian—that they are not Russian.\n\nThey all variably claim Rus’ as their direct heritage, while occasionally claiming they have a greater claim to it than the others; Ukrainians have even changed the name of their state and people from Rus’ and Rusyn, to a word with no etymological relation, but many Ukrainian nationalists still insist they are “more Rusian than the Russians”, so to speak, and that Carpatho-Rusyns, even those whose ancestral homeland has always been in Slovakia, are Ukrainians.\n\nThe very fact that within the East Slavic family, there may be heated debates that Ruskii spelled with one “s” is very different semantically than Russkii, and that Russkie has no relation to Rus’, (note: these words are pronounced identically in all languages [!]) the fact that even Rus’kii with or without an apostrophe can be controversial or that within the Rusyn community it can be a scandal to argue whether or not a certain Carpathian tribe are Rusyns or not (few nations are unable to agree on something as simple as who they are), the fact that you can even meet Rusyns who could ask you in Rusyn “Who are these Rusyns?”(see this video)—is all illustrative of this grand issue in Rus’ history which professor Likhachov aforetime noted.\n\nAs we examine these different names and national identities, we should bear in mind therefore that they often overlap, often the same Slavic spoken word can be written differently (i.e. Rus’kii vs Russkii), or translated as different as Russian, Ruthenian, Rusyn, Rusin, or even occasionally Ukrainian.\n\nWe must all decide for ourselves where we stand on the issue, should we choose to make a stand at all, however for the sake of accurately comprehending the meaning of these politically charged names, it is important to study and understand their complex context.\n\nCarpathian Rus’ and the Rusyn Homeland\n\nCarpathian Rus’\n\nThe homeland of the Carpatho-Rusyns is Carpathian Rus’ (Rusyn: Карпатска Русь – Karpatska Rus’), which broadly speaking, are the regions of the Carpathian Mountains which are traditionally inhabited by the East Slavs who identify as Rusyns.\n\nAccording to the Encyclopedia of Rusyn History and Culture [emphasis mine]:\n\n[Carpathian Rus’] covers approximately 18,000 square kilometers located along the southern and, in part, northern slopes of the Eastern Carpathian mountain ranges, stretching about 375 kilometers from the Poprad River in the west to the upper Tisza/Tysa and Ruscova/Rus’kova rivers in the east. According to present-day boundaries, this territory is divided among Poland, Slovakia, Ukraine, and a small part of Romania. Carpathian Rus’ may be subdivided into four regions, whose boundaries are determined by the states in which each is located: the Lemko Region (in Poland), the Presov Region (in Slovakia), Subcarpathian Rus’ (in Ukraine), and the Maramures Region (in Romania).\n\nBoth the concept of Carpathian Rus’ and its territorial extent have varied. During the second half of the nineteenth-century scholars in the Russian Empire (Lakiv Holovats’kyi, 1875; Ivan Filevich, 1895; Fedor Aristov, 1916) understood Carpathian Rus’ to include “Russian-inhabited” lands within the Habsburg Empire, that is, all of eastern Galicia and northern Bukovina as well as Ugorskaia Rus’ (i.e., Subcarpathian Rus’ and the Presov Region in Hungary). As early as 1850 the Rusyn historian Andrei Deshko understood the term Carpathian Rus’ to include only Rusyn-inhabited lands in the Hungarian Kingdom (Subcarpathian Rus’ and the Presov Region). At the close of World War I, however, Carpatho- Rusyn political leaders, in petitions submitted along with maps to the Paris Peace Conference (1919), defined Carpathian Rus’ to mean Subcarpathian Rus’, the Presov Region, and, on the northern slopes of the mountains, the Lemko Region (as far east as the San River).[18]\n\nDue to complex historical circumstances, this homeland is primarily divided between modern-day Ukraine (Transcarpathia/Subcarpathia), Poland (Lemkovyna and the Subcarpathian Voivodeship), and Slovakia (the Prešov region or Pryashevskaya Rus’), but also includes parts of Serbia (Ruski Krstur in Vojvodina, where Pannonian Rusyns live), and Romania (Maramureș), and Hungary.\n\nCarpathian Rus’ is as noted, often divided into sub-regions such as:\n\nTranscarpathia — Zakarpatia — Закарпатя\n\nIn modern contexts, Transcarpathia (Rusyn: Закарпатя – Zakarpatia) corresponds to the Transcarpathian Oblast of Ukraine, the capital of which is Uzhhorod. The name in Latin and Slavic means “Beyond the Carpathian Mountains”, as we will begin to see with similar terms, this depends vastly on one’s literal point of view. If one is standing in Kiev or Lviv and looking west/south, Transcarpathia is beyond (across) the Carpathian Mountains, the mountains are between the rest of Ukraine and Zakarpatia, walling off the Rusyn region from the rest of the country. However, that perspective changes if one looks from Budapest, Vienna, or Western Europe. Today Transcarpathia generally refers to the Oblast.\n\nAccording to the 2021 Census, the current population of the Zakarpattia Oblast is 1,250,129 with 784,799 or around 63 percent of them being rural,[19] keeping with the tradition of the local village being the heart of culture.\n\nTranscarpathia may be understood as the land before the Carpathian Mountains, after crossing which one enters the rest of Rus’. What we call the Ukrainian Carpathians today, were strategically very important in history, as being the lowest part of the Mountains, it was the only portion a large army could both reasonably conveniently and safely pass. The famous Verecke Pass in the mountains is thus called the Gates of Rus’.\n\nIt was for this reason that Stalin insisted on annexing Zakarpatia to the Soviet Union, and made it a strategic priority at the close of WW2, and was not content to leave it even with a socialist (allied) Czechoslovakia, as he knew what a problem getting over even the lowest of the mountains was for Russian armies. Indeed, the Soviet Union would use Transcarpathia as a staging area for its subsequent invasions of Hungary and Czechoslovakia.\n\nA very interesting episode comes from this time, demonstrating the national consciousness of Rusyns and their desire to be recognized as a people.\n\nSaint Alexis Kabaliuk, “the Carpatho-Russian/Rusyn”, a native of Zakarpatia and the spiritual leader Subcarpathian Rusyns at the time, being trusted by all the people, was chosen as the plenipotentiary on behalf of not just the Church, but all of Zakarpatia as a territory, to negotiate with Stalin as to the fate of Transcarpathia. Saint Alexis emphasized throughout the process that while Rusyns were looking forward to living with their fellow Slavs and Rus’ peoples, they consider themselves to be Rusyns and did not wish to be identified as Ukrainians.\n\nFurthermore, in a letter to Stalin dated on the 18th of November, 1944 in Mukachevo, understanding that being joined to the Soviet Union was a non-negotiable inevitability, we read how the Rusyn leaders requested and insisted they at least be given autonomy and full recognition as Rusyns and very specifically NOT to be included in the Soviet Ukrainian Republic, as to not be Ukrainianized:\n\n“We, the undersigned representatives of the Orthodox communities of Carpathian Rus’, expressing he will of our entire Russian Orthodox People, ask that [Carpathian Rus’] be included into the USSR in the form of: “The Carpatho-Russian Soviet Republic”[20]\n\nThe letter was signed by St. Alexis himself, Igumen Theophan Sabov, the administrator of the eparchy of Mukachevo and Prešov, and Rusyn Professor Petro Vasylevych Lyntur.\n\nThe context of the letter must also be understood clearly in its pragmatic context. This did not mean that Saint Alexis or the Rusyns wanted to join the Soviet Union, but at this point, they had no say in the matter and were merely trying to achieve the best possible conditions for Rusyns from their new and latest occupiers. Any platitudes towards Stalin or the USSR is not genuine support for the communist authorities, but merely their attempt to diplomatically negotiate from a very weak position.\n\nThe letter is very important as it demonstrates as late as 1944 that Subcarpathian Rusyns still identified as Rusyns, (after Galician Rusyns were already mostly Ukrainianized) and Rusyns desired recognition and even territorial self-rule as such and refute the claim that Rusyn is merely an old term for Ukrainian and by the 20th century, they became Ukrainians, as with Galicians.\n\nFurthermore, they emphasize that the people are Rusyns, and “sons of Rus’” and do not identify as Ukrainians, saying, “The name ‘Ukraine’ and ‘Ukrainian” became known to them “only after WW2.”[21] The letter emphasized that while Galicians adopted that name, with foreign backing, Subcarpathian Rusyns did not.\n\nClose to the end, the letter again emphasizes that the people are Rusyns who do not wish to be Ukrainianized and they request that a Carpatho-Rusyn republic be formed “Yasinia to the Poprad, from Uzok to Dobrochyn (Debrecen)[22]”, so that Rusyns may be together with their brother Slavs and Rus’ “kinsmen”, but still remain Rusyns.[23]\n\nThey knew that if they were to be included into the Ukrainian Soviet Republic, they would be Ukrainianized, which is what inevitably did happen, as though Stalin received Saint Alexis, and even perceived something special about the old monk,[24] the Soviet tyrant did not respect the rights of the Rusyn people much less a delegation led by the Orthodox Church.\n\nIn the end, these events show us how great Orthodoxy and Rusyn identity suffered together, and the unbreakable historic bonds between the faith and the Rusyn people.\n\nSubcarpathia — Podkarpatska Rus’ — Подкарпатска Русь\n\nSubcarpathian Rus’ (Подкарпатска Русь, in the Prešov standardization – Підкарпатьска Русь, variably in vernacular Subcarpathian dialects – Пудкарпатя. Pronounced Podkarpatska and Pidkarpatska Rus’ respectively and Pudkarpatia) can have several meanings. First and foremost, it can refer broadly to all the Rusyn regions “below” (pod/pid in Slavic) the Carpathian Mountains. Since we generally orient maps with north at the top, this effectively means all the Rusyn regions below Lemkovyna, which may be seen as being above the Carpathians (or on the northern polish side). It is worth noting that this Subcarpathia should not be confused with the Subcarpathian Voivodeship of Poland (Województwo podkarpackie), which mostly corresponds to Red Ruthenia, however, which overlaps with the Lemko region. As a result, using Subcarpathia to refer to all of Carpathian Rus’ is not ideal.\n\nSubcarpathia is in today’s context primarily used as a synonym for the Zakarpatia Oblast of Ukraine, as this land is directly beneath the Carpathian Mountains, and when we speak of Subcarpathian Rusyns today, we generally refer to those from Ukraine, though it should be noted historically the word was used to refer to people in the Prešov region as well, for example, by Dukhnovych. Subcarpathia may also be understood as the lands which were under the Hungarian crown in particular, which historically was called Uhorian Rus’ (Угорска Русь) or some form thereof, meaning Hungarian Rus’.\n\nSubcarpathian Rus’ was also the name of the brief inter-war political territory or proto-state in Czechoslovakia between 1920 and 1938. The first governor was Rusyn-American Gregory Žatkovich.\n\nPrecarpathia — Прикарпатя — Prycarpatia\n\nPrecarpathia (Rusyn: Прикарпатя – Prycarpatia) is the region immediately before the Carpathian Mountains, again by the point of observation of the rest of Rus’ (east to west). Therefore, Precarpathia refers primarily to Pokuttya and the lands of Galicia which border Transcarpathia, and are separated from it by the mountains. This is primarily the Ivano-Frankivsk and southern Lviv Oblast, though technically it can refer to all of Galicia, as in the famous monumental work “Subcarpathian Rus’ under the rule of Austria”. From the Russian/Ukrainian point of view, Precarpathia may be called in English Ciscarpathia.\n\nCiscarpathia\n\nCiscarpathia, meaning “On this side of the Carpathians”, is another term that depends on the point of observation. From the Russian/Ukrainian perspective, it is Precarpathia, but we can also speak of Ciscarpathian Romania. It is an English term, which does not apply to the homelands.\n\nThe Lemko Region or Lemkovyna — Лемковина\n\nLemkovyna (Rusyn: Лемковина) is the region of Poland where Lemkos traditionally dwell. It should also be noted in Poland there is the Subcarpathian Voivodeship, which contains parts of Red Ruthenia.\n\nAccording to the Encyclopedia of Rusyn History and Culture:\n\n[The Lemko region] refers to an area encompassing compassing about 250 villages, at least 50 percent of whose inhabitants (and usually much more) were Rusyns at the outset of the twentieth century. The territory itself is only about 25 to 50 kilometers wide and is bordered along its entire length in the south by the crests of the Carpathian Mountains, which coincide with the present-day Polish-Slovak border. In the west, the Lemko Region begins near the Tatra mountain range and stretches eastward for about 140 kilometers. There is no consensus regarding its eastern boundary: according to linguistic and ethnographic criteria that boundary lies somewhere between the Oslawa and Solinka rivers; according to criteria put forth by political activists, the boundary is the upper San River, i.e., the present-day Polish-Ukrainian border.[25]\n\nLemkovyna was generally considered to be relatively unpopulated prior to the 15th and 16th centuries. Feudal manorial landowners were unable to make much use of the rugged mountain highlands between Poland and Slovakia, as the terrane was simply not suited for the agrarian methods of their typical Slavic peasants, be they I mean Galicians, Poles, or Slovaks. This was a land in which the “Wallach-Rusyns”, with their pastoral lifestyle from the Vlach influence, could not only survive in, but thrive, and thus we see them begin to populate the region.[26] The Polish Goral people, who live just beyond the western border of Lemkovyna, near Zakopane, in the same mountainous conditions, adopted a very similar pastoral lifestyle. Connections between Goral culture and Vlach-Rusyn-Lemko culture is very interesting and requires further study. Linguist Michal Vašíček has done seminal and tremendous trailblazing work in this field, collecting data on peripheral Rusyn dialects with various influences. Based on available data, it seems the Rusyn village of Osturňa is the most “Goralised” Rusyn locality, which is interesting because Osturňa is located across the Tatry in Slovakia, not Poland, but there are others villages in Poland and Slovakia that have somewhat fewer connections to the Goraly. More information on this obscure Rusyn dialect can be found in this video with English subtitles.\n\nSaint Maxim Sandovich, the Lemko Protomartyr, was a native of Lemkovyna.\n\nThe Prešov Region or Presiovian Rus’ — Пряшівска Русь\n\nThe Prešov Region or Priashiv Region (Rusyn: Пряшівский край – Priashivskii Krai; Slovak: Prešovský Kraj) is the Rusyn region of Slovakia, also called traditionally Priashivska Rus’ (Rusyn: Пряшівска Русь – Priashivska Rus’) or Prešovian Rus’. This is the land of the great Saint Alexis Toth the “Father of American Rus’”, the national awakener Alexander Dukhnovych, and many other important figures.\n\nAccording to the Encyclopedia of Rusyn History and Culture:\n\n[The Prešov Region] refers to approximately 300 villages, at least 50 percent of whose inhabitants were Rusyns at the outset of the twentieth century (ca. 1910).[27]\n\nThe concept of a defined Prešov Region is of relatively recent origin, prior to WW1,[28] Prešov was understood in Rusyn histography as being together with Transcarpathia, under Subcarpathian Rus’, as they both sat at the on the southern side of the mountains.\n\nThe Prešov region today is arguably the most successful Rusyn region, at least in terms of institutional progress and development, especially thanks to the tremendous work done at the University of Prešov which has its own Rusyn language department and theological faculty, and also hosts the Studium Carpatho-Ruthenorum. The Prešov dialect has been fully standardized which was a major milestone.\n\nThe Prešov region is ecclesiastically part of the Orthodox Church of the Czech Lands and Slovakia, which is an autocephalic church, equal to all the other local churches like the Greek and Russian, and is headed by a wonderful primate, His Beatitude, Metropolitan Rastislav, who is the archbishop of Prešov. The Orthodox Church there is filled with pious clergy, and in eastern Slovakia is largely dominated by Rusyns. The beautiful Cyrillo-Methodian traditions are alive and well in Czechia and Slovakia.\n\nIn the interwar period, the Prešov region was home to the famous Carpathian Skete of St. Job of Pochaev, and its printing press, directly continuing the medieval Pochaev-Ostrog printing tradition. The brotherhood printed the famous journal Orthodox Carpathian Rus’ in the village of Ladomirová,[29] Slovakia.\n\nAmong the brothers was the young future First Hierarch of ROCOR, Metropolitan Laurus Škurla. After WW2, they moved to Holy Trinity Monastery in Jordanville, New York, and the Saint Job of Pochaev Press and the journal survives to this day, printed by ROCOR as Orthodox Rus’.\n\nThe Prešov region is one of the most dynamic and perspective parts of the Rusyn homeland.\n\nOther “Rusyn” Lands\n\nGalicia\n\nGalicia (Галиція; Галичина́ – Halitsia or Halyczyna) is the jewel or crownland of Western Rus’, it is the westernmost part of which constituted a powerful Principality and later the Kingdom of Rus’ (Ruthenia). Due to its preeminence among the Western Rusian lands, Galicia is often used (sometimes too broadly) to refer to all the lands of western Rus’, even those which more properly belong to Volhynia, Podolia, or Carpathian Rus’\n\nGalicia takes its name from the city of Halych (Га́лич – Halycz. The so-called G “Г” in Galicia is pronounced as an H) in today’s Ivano-Frankivsk region. Halych was quickly overshadowed and replaced as the capital of Galicia, by the royal city of Leopolis or Lvov, modern-day Lviv (In Polish: Lwów; in German: Lemberg).\n\nLviv was founded by Daniel Romanovich of Galicia. It must be remembered that Daniel of Galicia was not a prince, but a King. Though he was his entire life a faithful Orthodox Christian, he was crowned and granted the title of King by the Pope, a very clever political move, and one which would define the position of Galicia as a Rusian land in between east and west to this day.\n\nDaniel represented the Romanovichi, the elder branch of Rurikids, the ruling Grand Princes of Kiev, who after the fall of Kievan Rus’, went westward into Galicia. In Ruthenian histography, the tradition of Kievan Rus’ did not fall forever in 1240, rather it shifted to the west, to Galicia.\n\nGalicia is therefore always intimately tied to Kiev, and the ruler or heir of one is often considered the ruler or heir of both, thus the true title of Kievan Metropolitans became “Metropolitan of Kiev, Galicia, and all Rus’”.\n\nGalicia is therefore considered the successor of Kievan Rus’, whereas the younger siblings of Daniel’s father, who went to Vladimir-Suzdal, and later Moscow, also laid claim to Rus’. This began the old conflict and division between South-Western Rus’, and North-Eastern Rus’, as to who is the true successor with the right to demand the loyalty of the Russian lands and gather them together, Halych/Lvov or Vladimir/Moscow.\n\nKing Daniel, named Lviv in honor of his son Lev, meaning Lion, hence the name of the city means Leopolis—the city of the Lion. The Lion of Galicia is the symbol of Lviv and Galicia itself. In an account of a meeting of the Supreme Ruthenian Council (Holovna Rus’ka Rada) in 1848, we read:\n\n«знамя земли рускои тутейшои єсть левъ, а цвѣты руски жовтый и синый» (Trans: The banner of this land of Rus’ (ruskoi) is the lion, and the Rus’ colors are yellow and gold (i.e. the colors of the Ukrainian flag).[30]\n\nIt’s interesting to note that the Galician Lion is called the Russian lion, as it was in fact Galicia which was as demonstrated on the European maps, even called Russia when today’s Russia was called Muscovy, thus, supporters of the “Galician claim”, may even argue that Galicia is the senior among the Russias.\n\nIn the Duel Monarchy, the Polish region and its capital Krakow were included in the Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria (as West Galicia), which together with Bucovina were part of Austria, whereas Subcarpathia was part of Hungary. Due to this, the Lemko regions in Poland such as Gorlice and Sanok were technically part of Galicia as well, however, this is a “new Galicia”, and represents an expansion of the region outside its historical borders which end at Red Ruthenia.\n\nGalicia today is comprised mostly of the Lviv, Ivano-Frankivsk, and Ternopil Oblasts.\n\nWhile Galicia proper is not part of the Carpatho-Rusyn homeland, save for Precarpathia, Pokuttya and the Hutsul region in Ivano-Frankivsk, and the Beskid region of Red Ruthenia, due to its dominant role in the life of Western Rus’, and the fact that many historical Rusyn awakeners lived in Galicia, the histories are intertwined, as were the fates of Galician and Carpathian Rusyns, however now the vast majority of its inhabitants identify as Ukrainians.\n\nIt’s important to understand, however, that although today it is considered the center of Ukrainian nationalism, Galicia was historically a very Rusin land.\n\nThe first Ukrainian national and cultural awakening movements did not begin in Galicia, but rather in Dnipro Ukraine (i.e. Central Ukraine), in the Russian Empire, decades before the Ukrainophile movement or even the names such as “Ukraine” and especially “Ukrainian” were even popularized in Galicia. It was, in particular, the interaction between the original Ukrainophiles from Dnipro Ukraine, figures such as Drahomanov and Hrushevsky, with the budding national-populist movement in Galicia, with figures such as Ivan Franko, which formed or midwifed the budding Galician Ukrainophile movement.[31][32][33]\n\nPrior to this, Galicia was associated primarily with Rus’ or rather we may say contextually Ruthenia, the part of Rus’ in Poland, the Russian Palatinate. The people considered themselves Rusins or even Poles. Galicia was culturally and ethno-religiously very conservative, people identified primarily by their religious and cultural identity, not so much on a national basis, whereas the Ukrainian movement in a way, elevated the national element over the religious identity.\n\nIndeed, as nearly the entirety of the Galician intelligentsia were clergy, or coming from sacerdotal families, they looked with suspicion on the often anti-clerical element and the secular idea of radicalism emerging among the Ukrainophiles.[34] Figures such as Drahomanov, the works of Galicians like Franko and Lesya Ukrainka, and the radical national-populists were viewed with suspicion by traditionalist intelligentsia, due to their association with socialism and anticlericalism,[35] their perceived secularism or ambivalence towards organized religion, [36][37] and were even outright considered atheists by some.\n\nEven though many Galician Ukrainophiles, the youngest of the three national movements in Galicia, were themselves from sacerdotal families, they too were viewed with this same suspicion by the Old Ruthenians and Russophiles, due to their emphasis of the national element and the populist vernacular “low culture” over religious identities and values.[38][39] Ukrainian nationalists were seen as emphasizing earthly Ukraine over the kingdom of heaven, and invoking God merely to bless the Ukrainian movement, and viewing religion as secondary or axillary to the goal of promoting the national movement,[40] whereas most Rusyn activists were staunchly religious and prioritized their religious identity over the national. As hieromonk and professor Constantin (Simon) Ph.D., of Red Ruthenian decent writes:\n\n“…in time, several clergymen would support the [Ukrainophile] movement, seeing it as a way of asserting for themselves a separate religious and ethnic identity and as a means of propagating a nationalistic ideal. In time it became the dominant ideology among the clergy who remained at home and remained Uniate.”\n\nAn example of this may be a comparison of the hymns of Dukhnovych, where Rusyns humbly ask God to bless their cause and grant them to see another day,[42] vs the Ukrainian national anthem, influenced by the Ukrainian school of polish literature, which declares “We will give our souls and bodies”, for freedom and Ukraine. To Christians, the idea of giving your life for your nation is acceptable, but not the soul which rightfully belongs to God,[43] however this is a microcosm of the religious difference between the movements. Broadly speaking, we may say the Ukrainian movement was more “liberal”, and the Russophile more conservative.\n\nWe see this divide in the diaspora as well. Among the Orthodox, a large majority of the original Ukrainian Autocephalites came from the Lypkivsky schism from central (Dnieper) Ukraine, from the Russian Empire.\n\nIt was the Ukrainian Orthodox who first started fighting for Ukrainian to be used in services in place of Church Slavonic, whereas the Carpatho-Russian Orthodox and Ruthenian Uniates were very conservative in liturgical and ecclesiastical matters.\n\nIndeed, the Ruthenian Uniate diaspora was by far one of the most conservative and loyal to the Holy See, and analogous to the Orthodox Carpatho-Russians, preserved far longer their Ruthenophile orientation compared to the Dnieper Ukrainians. It was as late as the 60s when the Ukrainian Patriarchal movement gained dominance among Ruthenian Uniates, even employing violence against the Rusyn Bishop in England.[44] Even though the Rusyn Basilian hierarchy preserved their religious focus and loyalty to Rome, whereas the Ukrainian Patriarchal movement seemingly placed a “Soborna Ukraine” and a “Pomisna Tserkva” for her above all, the Vatican in the end seemingly favored the Ukrainophiles as the last Ruthenians began to die out.[45] Then the Uniate Church began to be dominated by Ukrainophiles, as it is today, however historically, it was also Ruthenophile if not even Russophile during the spring of nations.\n\nThis synthesis of the Dnieper Ukraine, with its Cossack myth of national origin, and the Western-leaning culture of old Galicia is what birthed the Ukrainian national movement as we recognize it today.\n\nCossacks, despite being largely out of place in Galician and Carpathian vernacular culture, began to appear as part of the national identity in Galicia. Today in Galicia it’s common to see Cossack costumes and hairstyles in nationalist marches when ironically the ancestors of most Galicians fought for Poland against the Cossack independence uprisings. The following anecdotal passage is very telling of the conflict between members of the Old Ruthenian and Young National-Populist movements, which at times could be hateful and violent:\n\n“It is said that one of the superiors at the Vienna seminary boasted that he had developed an excellent method for dealing with any Ukrainophile under his jurisdiction: he would have the offender shave his head until all he had left was his Cossack forelock, then he would grab him by this forelock and behead him with a sabre.”[46]\n\nA romanticization of the Cossacks and their foundational role in the Ukrainian national myth vs the emphasis on Old Ruthenia is a key difference between the movements. Both historically, as part of the Galician populist movements,[47] and to this day, we see Cossack costumes and styles employed slightly out of place, or anachronistically, in Galicia. This is not to say there was no overlap between Cossacks and Galicia, as many Cossacks, such as the great Orthodox and heroic Hetman Petro Sahajdaczny, came from the Precarpathian and Galician regions, however, it’s the emphasis on Cossacks that distinguished the Ukrainian movement.\n\nUkrainophiles tended to look to the democratic and free Cossack state (the Zaporizhian Sich or Hetmanschina i.e. “The Hetman’s Land”) of the early modern period for inspiration and as the basis of their national origin, whereas the Ruthenians looked to the knightly feudal and medieval lands of the Kingdom of Galicia and Volhynia, and even the Rzeczpospolita. Simply put, the old citizens of Lwów were far more likely to have been Polish winged hussars than Zaporizhian Cossacks.\n\nThis identity is perhaps not completely organic, but a result of that relatively recent synthesis of Dnipro Ukraine and Galicia.\n\nDrahomanov, criticizing the perceived famous short-sightedness of the Ruthenians, would quip that the Ruthenian movements imagined creating a Uniate Paraguay,[48] that is to say, a small “nation of three million”,[49] whereas his goal and that of the Ukrainophiles was to create a Soborna Ukraine.\n\nSubcarpathian Rus’ however was far less enthusiastic about this project than Galicia. Drahomanov, having visited “Hungarian Rus’” in 1875 and 1876 was horrified by the lack of interest for Ukrainianism among Subcarpathian Rusyns, writing that this land was “farther separated, even from Galicia than Australia is from Europe.”[50] Just as Galicia was more culturally conservative than Dnipro Ukraine with regards to identities, Subcarpathia under Hungary was more conservative or perhaps even primitive than Austrian Galicia.[51]\n\nIn the end, however, recent histography and destiny would show that Galicia truly became the jewel of Ukraine’s crown, becoming not a Ruthenian Paraguay but instead a Ukrainian Piedmont.[52]\n\nWhile Ukrainian nationalism did truly come originally from Dnipro Ukraine, due to Galicia’s unique position at the crossroads of central and eastern Europe and between many ancient states and peoples, in the midst of the spring of nations, Galicia became what would be called the Ukrainian Piedmont (See Magocsi: Galicia as Ukraine’s Piedmont), the fertile seedbed from which the Ukrainian nation could grow and flourish, free from the agenda of the Russian Empire in Ukraine, which was to gather the Ruthenian lands into the Russian Empire.\n\nAs a result, though Galician and Carpathian Rus’ began as sisters, their paths have now departed as Galicia became the fountain of Ukraine, of what began in Dnipro Ukraine, though they all still remain bound by common faith, blood, and culture. For now, in modern contexts, Galicia is more related to Ukraine than to the Rusyn movement, however, ideally, Galicia and Ukraine can come to recognize Rusyns, Ruthenians, Cossacks, Poles, Belarusians, even Romanians and Russians, and all the cultures who together made her one of the most beautiful lands in the world.\n\nRed Ruthenia\n\nRed Ruthenia is broadly speaking the western part region of Rus’, between Galicia (the modern Lviv Oblast) and Poland. Red Ruthenia is another term that is difficult to precisely define as its borders changed throughout history. Strictly speaking, it refers to the lands of the Cherven Cities or castles, mentioned in the Primary Chronicle, as being incorporated into Kievan Rus’ by Saint Volodimer (Vladimir) the Great, who was quite possibly born in nearby and related Volhynia.[53] According to Chronicle:\n\nВ лѣт̑о [6489] иде [Володимеръ] к Лѧхомъ и заꙗ градꙑ их̑ . Перемъıшль Червенъ . и инꙑ градꙑ. єже суть и до сего дн҃е подъ Русью .[54]\n\nWhich means:\n\nIn the year 6489 (981), [Volodimer] marched to the Ljachs (the Poles) and claimed their cities. Przemyśl, Czerwień, and other cities, which are and to this day under Rus’.\n\nAmong the Cherven Cities are principly Przemyśl, Czerwień (Cherven), Belz, Sanok, Rzeszów, Chełm, Wołyń, and several others.\n\nRed Ruthenia should not however be seen as being only a certain number of cities, but rather, the broader region and lands between Galicia-Volyn Rus’ and Poland, which were especially contested between the Kingdoms of Rus’ and Poland. When Poland later incorporated the Kingdom of Ruthenia, these lands were divided between the Przemyśl, Belz, and Rus’ Palatinates.\n\nRed Ruthenia is therefore not a defined historical polity, but a broad cultural region equally tied to both Galician Rus’ and Poland, and its definition has changed with changing historical borders.\n\nThe southwestern part of Red Ruthenia roughly overlaps with Lemkovyna, around Sanok (typically Lemkovyna does not extend north of Sanok), though the terms are not synonymous nor do they incorporate all of the same lands. Almost no Rusyns from Red Ruthenia called themselves Lemkos. Another area of Polish Red Ruthenia which had a significant Ruthenian population was Lesko and its county, and there are many Rusyn/Ruthenian/Carpatho-Russian immigrants in America from this area between Sanok, Lesko, and Przemyśl and this broader Beskid region.\n\nToday Red Ruthenia is divided between the Lviv and Volyn Oblasts of Ukraine, and primarily the Subcarpathian Voivodeship of Poland, but also to a lesser degree the Lublin Voivodeship.\n\nParts of Red Ruthenia may be considered a part of the Carpatho-Rusyn homeland, such as the Beskid region, however, the region around Lublin has more relation to Belarus and Volhynia. Most of Red Ruthenia is not part of Carpathian Rus’ and the terms are not synonymous, though there is overlap, and due to its roots, Red Ruthenia may be considered an extension of Galician Rus’, or the region bridging Lemkovyna with Galician, Volhynian, and White Rus’.\n\nPannonian Rusyns in Serbia\n\nPannonian Rusyns are Rusyns from West Bačka in Vojvodina, a northern autonomous province of Serbia. They likely immigrated to the Serbian lands in the 18th century. On the 7th of January 1751, the regional administrator of Bačka, Franz Joseph von Redl, signed an agreement with Mihajlo Munkači from the village of Červenovo to bring Rusyn families to the modern area of Ruski Krstur, when this entire territory was under the rule of the Austro-Hungarian Empire.\n\nThe name Pannonian refers to the Pannonian Basin, also called the Carpathian Basin, which as the name implies, is roughly speaking, the large and fair Danube Basin or plains between the Carpathian Mountains, nearly to the Adriatic Sea. Essentially, the land between Subcarpathia, through Hungary, to Serbia. This territory roughly comprises all of Hungary, parts of western Romania, and Northern Serbia (Vojvodina). In the past, it was called the Hungarian Plains, much like the mountains were called the Hungarian Mountains, and Subcarpathia was called “Hungarian Rus’” because historically these territories were under the Hungarian Crown.\n\nPannonian Rusyns are mostly native to the Kula municipality of the West Bačka District of Voivodina, Serbia, where the center of Pannonian Rusyn culture is the village of Ruski Krstur.\n\nThere is also a minority of Pannonian Rusyns in the region of Slavonia, Croatia, which borders Vojvodina to the west.\n\nVojvodina is an ethnically diverse region, though the majority population has always been Serbs, it has been home to many minority communities made up of other nations from the former Dual Monarchy, such as Romanians (particularly in Banat), Hungarians, Czechs, and Slovaks, in addition to the Pannonian Rusyns.\n\nVojvodina currently consists of three regions, Bačka, the plains of Srem, and Banat, bordering Romania on the Danube.\n\nThe capital of the province of Vojvodina is the beautiful city of Novi Sad, which has many architectural features typical of that rustic and opulent baroque Central European style which distinguishes it. Novi Sad could be likened in many ways to Lviv and Mukachevo, in Ukraine, Timișoara or Brașov în Romania, Prešov or Košice in Slovakia, or Gorlice and Sanok in Poland, having all the beauty of Krakow, Budapest, or Vienna, which distinguishes the great cities of Carpathia and Pannonia.\n\nIt is worth noting that Vojvodina is also home to Sremski Karlovci, not far from Novi Sad, which for a time was the seat of the Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia, led by Metropolitan Anthony (Khrapovitsky), of Kiev and Galicia. He was the spiritual father of many Rusyn saints like Maxim Sandovich, who was one of the champions of the Carpathian Orthodox mission. He brought with him a significant portion of the White Russian emigration and nobility, forced to flee from the godless authorities, after the Bolshevik revolution, and from here he led the Provisional Synod which became the ROCOR.\n\nIn Serbia, he ordained his spiritual son, John, a “Little Russian”, born in Ukraine near the “Holy Mountains” of Svyatogorsk, with old Rusin and Serbian ancestry. He would of course go on to be one of the greatest saints of our times, St. John (Maximovich), Archbishop of Shanghai and San Francisco, the wonderworker. In general, Serbia was a major center of White Russian emigration.\n\nThe Carpathian Orthodox eparchies and territories in Subcarpathia and Prešov were administered and well cared for here between the Serbian Patriarchate and the ROCOR, during the inter-war period, until the godless authorities and the Red Army seized these lands from equally godless occupiers in 1945. The brotherhood of Serbs and the children of Rus’ is well known, as their fates were in many ways tied together in the great mystery of the 20th century.\n\nVojvodina itself can be compared as a Serbian analog to the cultural regions of Galicia in Ukraine and Poland, Transylvania in Romania, and Eastern Slovakia, each of these regions having historically Orthodox roots, a Uniate population, a centuries-long Austro-Hungarian occupation, and each lying at a certain crossroads between east and west, north and south.\n\nThe collision of two or even more worlds produces a culture that is hard to replicate.\n\nThis diversity is one of the features which makes the mysterious and ancient lands of Carpathia, Pannonia, and the Danube Basin so majestically beautiful.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe ideal name for the Rusyn homeland as a whole is “Carpathian Rus’” as it is all-encompassing, simple—without any of the baggage of other terms—and includes all Carpathian regions where Rusyns live.\n\nEthnonyms and Xenonyms\n\nRusyns\n\nNow we reach our keyword. The primary name for the people to whom our literary society is dedicated is Rusyns, and this is a name with an ancient and rich history.\n\nFirst, it should be said, as explained by the title of one of the great Professor Magocsi’s works, “All Carpatho-Rusyns are Rusyns, but not all Rusyns are Carpatho-Rusyns.”\n\nWe often add the geographic prefix “Carpatho-” to assist people in identifying where Rusyns come from — if it hasn’t been made abundantly clear — it’s not from nowhere!\n\nMany prefer not to add this Carpatho– prefix to their names, and be known simply as Rusyns, because Rusyns in the homeland, in organic speech, do not call themselves Carpatho-Rusyns. While the word does appear in early Carpatho-Rusyn histories,[55] the prefix is primarily used not internally, but for the rest of the world to understand where Rusyns come from, while they call themselves by their own local names like Rusnaks, Lemkos, Rusyns, etc.\n\nRusyns are from the Carpathian Mountains, but they are from a very particular part of the mountains, where this particular East Slavic Rusian people live.\n\nThe name Rusyn however, does not strictly apply only to Carpatho-Rusyns, although these people are the primary bearers of this name today. As noted, the word Rusyn is old going back to the very beginning of Rus’ itself, as one of the oldest words for a Russian or Rusian person, and inhabitant of Rus’.\n\nThe ethnonym Rusyn appears in written sources as early as the tenth century.\n\nDocent Sergey G. Sulyak, doctoral candidate of historical sciences, and founder of the international academic journal Rusin,[56] wrote in 2007, an article on the historical roots of Rusyns and their names.\n\nIn his article, Sulyak sites that the name Rusyn appears seven times in the Rus’–Byzantine Treaty of 911 (912),[57] conducted between Constantinople and Oleg of Rus’, (which is considered one of the oldest Rusian texts), and six times in the treaty conducted by Igor son of Rurik in 944/945.[58]\n\nThe name Rusyn later appears in the first Rusian codex of Laws, the Rus’ka Pravda, which was compiled by Yaroslav the Wise of Kiev, in the early eleventh century and later expounded upon throughout the centuries; Rusyn appears (in bold below) at the beginning of the codex:\n\nУбьеть муж мужа, то мьстить брату брата, или сынови отца, любо отцю сына, или братучаду, любо сестрину сынови; аще не будеть кто мьстя, то 40 гривенъ за голову; аще будеть русинъ, любо гридинъ, любо купчина, любо ябетникъ, любо мечникъ, аще изъгои будеть, любо словенинъ, то 40 гривенъ положити за нь.[59]\n\nThe name further appears in the first Rusian history, the Primary Chronicle of Saint Nestor of Kiev which was originally compiled around 1113 A.D., the example below, given from the Laurentian Codex, dates from 1377.[60]\n\nA passage from the Tale above says:\n\nПостави Ꙗрославъ Лариѡна митрополитомь . Русина . въ ст҃ѣи Соѳьи . собравъ єпс̑пꙑ[61]\n\nIn English this is (by my translation):\n\n“And Yaroslav installed the Rusyn (Hi)larion as Metropolitan in (the Kiev Church of) Holy Sophia, having gathered the bishops (for this).”\n\nSt. Hilarion of Kiev was the first Rusin primate and Metropolitan of Kiev, and author of one of the most famous sermons in ancient Rus’, still relevant to this day, known as the Sermon on the Law and Grace.[62] Based on these words, St. Hilarion of Kiev is known in Russian histography as Hilarion the Rusyn (Rusin)[63].\n\nDespite this, it is noteworthy that the given translation into modern Russian reads: Поставил Ярослав Илариона в митрополиты, русского родом, в церкви святой Софии or in English (my translation): and Yaroslav installed Hilarion of the Russian nation[64] as metropolitan […].\n\nWe note the original phrase “Hilarion [the] Rusin”, was rendered in translation as “Илариона…русского родом” or Hilarion of the Russian (Russkii with the double “s”) nation.\n\nThis is because Rusin/Rusyn is understood in its historical context here as meaning a person of the Rus’ nation, not as a particular name for the people we call Carpatho-Rusyns. It is translated as Russian here, because Russians, as well as Ukrainians, and other East Slavs have a shared history and decent from old Kievan Rus’, and each consider themselves successors of the old Rus’ state; as a result, in both languages and schools of histography, Rusin/Rusyn is considered an archaic name for their people. Therefore from the Russian point of view, Russian (Russkii) means “a person of Rus’”, and thus Hilarion “the Rusin”, is understood as saying Hilarion the (Ancient) Russian.\n\nProfessor Paul Robert Magocsi also notes that the Rusyns themselves have begun using this term as an endonym already by at least the 11th century.[65]\n\nAccording to historian A. Solovyov, a graduate of the University of Warsaw, the first plural use of the word Rusyn is recorded already by 1501 A.D.,[66] in documentation from the Belz Voivodeship in Poland, which was, of course, once part of the lands of the Rusian King Daniel of Galicia. Seeing as Belz is part of Galicia, more specifically Red Ruthenia, located in the modern-day Lviv region of Ukraine, we can see that Rusyn is again used not to mean Carpatho-Rusyn specifically, but as a general name to describe East Slavic peoples in the lands of the Polish Crown, who are often called Ruthenians in translation.\n\nIt is interesting that depending on the translator and their orientation, this same word Русинъ can be translated Rusin, Rusyn, Russian, or Ruthenian among others, and each of these words carries its own context with it, therefore it’s important to understand the original context of the word, and how it is used, and not to apply to it an anachronistic or politically charged context.\n\nFor example, the word may honestly be translated as Russian, however, this could create the impression that the person is a modern Russian, and not from ancient Rus’.\n\nRuthenian could imply a later period, with its connections to the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth and the Austro-Hungarian Empire, the word is also slightly anachronistic, as it was especially in this era certainly not an endonym, and unlikely to have been used at all yet. While Ruthenian is valuable for carrying certain academic neutrality, and may fairly be used here, it still has its own entangled context.\n\nEven Rusin/Rusyn, while being direct transliterations, and the most accurate choice may cause one to think the individual was a Carpatho-Rusyn, as opposed to simply meaning “a person from Rus’”. There is also the matter of orthography, while in Cyrillic there is only one form Русин(ъ), in transliteration, an issue can emerge as to whether to use the “y” or “i” spelling.\n\nRusyn or Rusin\n\nThe issue of whether to spell the Slavic word Русин with a “y” or “i”, is naturally one which only emerges in the English or rather Latin alphabet-based languages, therefore it is not an issue that affects East Slavs in their own languages. This is obviously not a matter which has any real relevance for ancient Rus’.\n\nThere are some arguments that one or the other spelling is preferred, due to a real or perceived semantic value, but in reality, the issue seems to come down to how “и” is transliterated. It is generally agreed upon with regards to the (Carpatho) Rusyn Language, that the и sound is best represented with a Latin “y”, and thus, Rusyn is the preferred and standardized spelling.\n\nI have heard arguments, that “Rusyn” was an attempt of western or catholic nations to divide Rusyns from their Rus’ identity, however this position is dubious, considering that first of all, local western (and “Catholic” Slavic languages such as Polish and Slovak spell the word as Rusin (Rusiński, etc). The standard German spelling seems to also be Russinen, not only with an “i” but even with a double “s”. The Rusin spelling seems to originate from, and reflect the use in the Hungarian language, also written in a Latin-based system. This is why you find early newspapers and monuments in American have Uhro-Rusin or Rusin.\n\nSo, if anything, the Magyars, West Slavs, and Germanics seem to support the “i” spelling, and it cannot be said in any way that they imposed a “y” spelling on the Rusyns.\n\nFinally, considering that Rusyn and all east Slavic languages are written in Cyrillic where there is only one spelling, the supposed i/y dilemma would only truly exist and be relevant for the English-speaking diaspora.\n\nConcerning the context of the primary chronicle however, an argument may be made that generally speaking, the traditional transliteration of “и” from Church Slavonic[67], is “i”.\n\nTherefore, one could argue that Rusin is a better spelling in this context than Rusyn, as the language in question is not Rusyn but rather Old East Slavonic/Slavonic.\n\nIn the end, regardless of which spelling one uses, the most important thing to understand is the word Rusin/Rusyn, in this time period and for many centuries simply meant an inhabitant of Rus’.\n\nThis is an example of when Rusian may be the best word choice, as it directly suggests “of Rus’” and in a neutral way, without the baggage of the other words. This is closest to the original context of the word Rusin/Rusyn, and not what they’ve come to mean today.\n\nIt is however of paramount importance for the Rusyn cause to recognize how the context of the word has changed to mean a Carpatho-Rusyn today. To do this, we must recognize when the Carpatho-Rusyns transitioned from the grey haze of pre-literary history into golden history written in stone.\n\nThe Beginning of Carpatho-Rusyn History\n\nHistory is not simply the study of anything that happened in the past, this is a major misconception; the key is how are these events studied, what is the methodology, by what sources. History as an academic discipline is primarily the study of past events through recorded history, meaning literary records and sources from the time in question, as a result, history is in many ways primarily a school and study of literature.\n\nThere is another misconception that prehistory or a prehistoric period refers to a single time in human history—a stone age of cavemen—however prehistory is simply pre-literary history, the time before these historical records and sources existed or are extant, without which we can not in a proper sense study history. We may study archeology for example, but not history proper, which is based on recorded sources.\n\nAs a result, every people have a different pre-historical and historical period, before and after written sources exist. We may speak of Greek bronze-age history; however, we cannot truly speak of bronze-age British or Slavic history or their history before the 6th century, not because Slavs didn’t exist, or were invented, but simply because we have no historical sources from these people at that time.\n\nHistory—strictly speaking as an academic discipline, as opposed to archaeology—can tell us nothing about a prehistoric people, as we cannot read history before it was recorded. Simply put, the prehistory of a people ends when their own recorded history begins.\n\nSo, to understand when Carpatho-Rusyn history begins, as opposed to general Rusin history, we must look to the earliest literary sources. To be sure, the word Rusyn appears in historical records from around the tenth and eleventh century, but as we demonstrated, this was referring to all inhabitants of the Rus’ state.\n\nSo, when do the Carpatho-Rusyn people begin to awaken their national self-consciousness, and become the distinct people we know and love today?\n\nWhen do these God-loving people awake from their furtive slumber, and take their first steps out of the terra incognita from beyond the lonely Carpathian Mountains, from Prehistory into History, and claim their destiny as a people in the chronicles of the history of man?\n\nHistoria Carpatho-Ruthenorum\n\nIn 1843, Rusyn priest Michaelem Lutskay[68] published in Košice[69] his monumental work Historia Carpato-Ruthenorum for which he may be considered the first Carpatho-Rusyn historian. This is in many ways the beginning of Carpatho-Rusyn literary history, as it is to our knowledge, the first well-known extant history, written by and about “Carpatho-Rusyns,” with a Carpathian focus and perspective.\n\nIt is noteworthy that Lutskay also published another keystone work, the first Carpatho-Rusyn grammar in Hungarian Rus’, in Budapest in 1830, entitled: “Grammatica slavo-ruthena : seu vetero-slavicae, et actu in montibus Carpathicis parvo-Russicae, ceu dialecti vigentis lingvae.”[70]\n\nOnce again, older Ruthenian grammars exist, such as the famous 16th century Bukvar of Ivan Fyodorov or the 17th-century grammar of M. Smotrycki, but these were published in the Rzeczpospolita, and concern general Ruthenians, whereas in the works of Lutskay, we see a historiographic tradition develop from “beneath,” and “beyond the Carpathians”, from not just a Rusyn but a Carpatho-Rusyn perspective.\n\nWhile Ancient Chronicles exist telling of the Rusyns of Kiev, Galicia, and Volhynia, this is Rusyn in a general sense. Galicians may indeed be considered the same Rusyns in previous centuries, but they have since by-in-large been Ukrainianized, and now belong to a different school of histography.\n\nConcerning Carpatho-Rusyn history, we must here give an honorable mention to the hegumen Joannicio Basilovits (1742-1821+),[71] who is also often considered the “first Rusyn historian”. In 1799 and 1804, Basilovits published a two-volume work on Ruthenian prince Teodoras (Fyodor/Fedir) Koriatovych, entitled “Brevis notitia fundationis Theodori Koriathovits, olim ducis de Munkacs.” Koriatovych was a keystone figure in the history of Transcarpathia, and his patronage of the holy sites and castles in the region helped preserve them to this day. Koriatovych hailed from Lithuanian Rus’, and was a powerful ruler in Podolia; he was born in the 1330s and died in 1414, and though he is considered an important leader in Carpatho-Rusyn histography and ruler in Carpathian Rus’, he is not himself a Carpatho-Rusyn, and this period is not very well documented, and there are many legends surrounding it.[72] This is once again, also a period before the (19th century) emergence of modern nations, nationalism, and their national historiographies. For these reasons, we may consider this a Carpatho-Rusyn protohistory. Koriatovych was nonetheless the lord of Mukachevo Palanok Castle and may be considered both a great Rusyn prince and also a connection between Carpathian Rus’ and the other Ruthenian lands.\n\nOne can mention the work of the Austrian historian Hermann J. Bidermann, “Die ungarischen Ruthenen, ihr Wohngebiet, ihr Erwerb, und ihre Geschichte” which is closer to an academic study, than Historia or Brevis which resemble more a 19th century ecclesiastical chronicle of the old Rus’ tradition.\n\nHowever, Bidermann is an Austrian, and his work concerns “ungarischen Ruthenen” (Hungarian Ruthenians), who are of course, the same people as the Carpatho-Rusyns, however this does not represent a work written by Carpatho-Rusyns, on their own history, calling themselves by that name, thereby making them distinct from other Rusyns. It is not so much a Rusyn history but a history about Rusyns, but perhaps the first ethnographical study on Rusyns in the historical-academic sense.\n\nStill, the criteria by which we judge the beginning of Carpatho-Rusyn Literary history is when they themselves produce their own history, with a degree of cultural self-consciousness and distinction from their neighbors, and using the names we know them by today.\n\nLutskay’s history is the first to use “Carpatho-Ruthenian” in the title, dedicated not to Rusyns in a general sense, but to Carpatho-Rusyns, and thus, represents the beginning of their literary history. There is only one distinction to be made, and that is that Historia is written in Latin, not Rusyn or Slavono-Ruthenian. So, what may be considered the start of Slavic language Rusyn history?\n\nThe Mermaid of the Dniester\n\nAs if risen from the pure springs of the Beskids to the free waters of pontos, the Mermaid of the Dniester carries with her the songs of Precarpathia.\n\nWhen seeking the beginning of Rusyn Literature, we must give an honorable mention to the Rusalka Dnistrovaya (Русалка днѣстровая) or “The Mermaid of the Dniester.”\n\nThe Rusalka Dnistrovaya is a great monument of Rusyn literary history, considered the first work published in the vernacular language of Galicia and Precarpathia.\n\nThe Mermaid is a collection of songs and poems compiled and published in Budapest in 1837 by Markiyan Shashkevych, and Yakub Holovatsky, and Ivan Vahylevych, who together formed the Ruthenian Troika, possibly the three most influential ruthenian awakeners in Galicia. As a result, it predates the Historia, and unlike both Historia and Brevis, it is genuinely written in what may be considered a living, spoken language of the Rusin nation (In the text: Нарід Руский – Narid Ruski).[73] As a matter of fact, it is unique, both among other works of the Ruthenian Troika and other early awakeners like Dukhnovych, in that it is genuinely written in the vernacular, and not the so-called iazichie or a semi-artificial literary language. The mermaid represents the beautiful flower of Galician song, awoken from the depths of a sea of enigma and into the fair and noetic light of dawn. It can be read here.\n\nIt should be noted however that the Rusalka reflects more the Galician Rusyn language or a dialect depending on one’s point of view, and does not necessarily reflect modern Carpatho-Rusyn, however in some ways, it could be argued that the language of Rusalka is closer to vernacular Carpatho-Rusyn than the poems of Dukhnovych. As Galicia has by in large now adapted the Ukrainian identity, the Mermaid may equally be considered the first work in what we would now call vernacular Galician Ukrainian, and this is acceptable, however in the interest of avoiding revisionism, we should note the word “Ukrainian” is not used to describe the people in Rusalka, and authors belonged to the Galician Russophile orientation. This author believes that Russophilia may be neutral (i.e. not mandate Moscophila) or that it’s even possible to reconcile Rusynophilia, Russophilia, and Ukrainophilia, however, we must start with honesty and avoid historical revisionism, and try to represent periods and historical figures as accurately to how they viewed themselves as possible, and not as we would want to view them.\n\nIt should also be noted here that Rusalka may be called the first vernacular Galician Ukrainian book, it is not the first “vernacular” Ukrainian book of the early modern period, a title which essentially belongs to the Eneyida of Ivan Kotlyarevsky in 1798, a work of Dnieper Ukraine published in the Russian Empire. While the beginning of vernacular Ukrainian or “Little Russian”, Literature is beyond the scope of this article, we may say that works such as Shevchenko’s Kobzar (1840) roughly date to the same era as these Carpathian and Galician works in the first half of the 19th century.\n\nWe have already noted that Ruthenian literature as a whole developed organically from the ancient Rus’ tradition and was particularly strong in Kiev and Galicia from the 16th to the 17th centuries, with numerous keystone literary monuments published in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth and the Russian Empire. Rusalka merely represents the beginning of Galician vernacular literature in this early modern era.\n\nThough Rusałka predates Historia, when seeking the beginning of Rusyn recorded history, as a literary monument, it belongs more to what would be considered cultural heritage than to History, unlike other examples given here, as The Mermaid is an almanac or collection of songs and folklore, and does not attempt to describe systematically or otherwise the history of the Ruthenians.\n\nWhile the Mermaid is not necessarily a work of history, it is indeed a historical work, due to its monumental status as the first vernacular Galician work of its age.\n\nThe Pozdravlenie to the Rusyns of 1851 — The Rusyns Awaken from their Mountains\n\nThe priest Alexander Dukhnovych is without a doubt the man of the epoch concerning the Rusyn awakening. While people like the Ruthenian Troika, Adolf Dobryansky, and others are also keystone figures, Dukhnovych is something else, in that he literally wrote the immortal words which came to define Rusyn identity.\n\nIn 1851 he wrote his Pozravlenia to the Rusyns, and in this almanac, he wrote the poem “Вручанiе”(Vruchanie – Dedication)—the hymn of the entire Rusyn awakening, the legendary anthem “I was, am, and will be a Rusyn.”\n\nЯ Русин был, есмь, и буду,\n\nЯ родился Русином,\n\nЧестный мой род не забуду,\n\nОстанусь его сыном;\n\nIt must be noted, however, that this monumental poem is not quite written in vernacular, spoken Rusyn, but rather what we may call Slavono-Russian. Provided below is a translation of the poem into modern vernacular Rusyn:\n\nЯ Русин, быв, єм тай буду,\n\nЯ ся родив Русином,\n\nСлавный свôй род ни забуду,\n\nУбстану ся його сыном;\n\nDukhnovych, like most writers of the period, wrote in a literary language that combined Church Slavonic with local vernacular (Subcarpathian and Galician) words, and the literary Russian language, which itself was heavily influenced by Church Slavonic.[74] This language, as an attempt to create a literary high language, was called (often perjuriously) the iazychie, and it cannot be said to represent the vernacular spoken Rusyn. It can be called Slavono-Ruthenian, analogous to Slavono-Russian or the Slavono-Serbian literary tradition. Here, this author believes it is necessary to defend and explain the historical role of this literary language.\n\nWhile we fully support and believe that living Rusyn, should be the first language of the Rusyns, and that in today’s time, a standardized Rusyn, like what was done in Prešov should be used to write Rusyn scientific and literary works, we feel there is an occasionally undue prejudice towards the very idea of Slavono-Russian, and an often an honest ignorance towards its historical value and context. As we look to a Rusyn future, we should not condemn the past with all its storms, and the figures, many of whom were yes—Russophiles—who paved the way to what we have today. That does not mean we are not Rusynophiles, but this is part of our history, and we should at least seek to understand the past.\n\nIn Defense of the Iazichie\n\nSlavono-Russian sometimes called perjuriously iazichie does possess very valuable historical qualities and utilities we should not ignore. While it is not a vernacular language, we should also bear in mind it was not necessarily intended by all parties to be one, but rather it often served as a “high” language or a lingua franca, essentially a high literary language. Whether or not an archaic or artificial language should be used as the literary language, rather than a standardization of the common vernacular is a separate debate, however by in large, figures such as Dukhnovych were not claiming this was the daily language of Rusyns, and to be fair, it was also largely comprehensible to everyone with at least a rudimentary education, it was not as if they were writing in Latin to Portuguese speakers, but closer to the language of the King James Bible in relation to modern American English.\n\nOften when attempting to debunk one common misconception, we may unintentionally go to the opposite extreme and create another.\n\nFor example, in attempting to demonstrate that iazichie does not reflect spoken Rusyn, we may imply it is a terrible contrived pidgin speech with no valuable features, and this is also equally untrue.\n\nThough iazichie is not a good language to demonstrate the living spoken language of Rusyns today, there is one area in which it is very valuable.\n\nSlavono-Rusian shows its true value and utility as an ecclesiastical language, a language for church sermons, spiritual literature, and cultural philosophy.\n\nWe should bear in mind that the majority of the intelligentsia in Carpathia and Galicia were clergy or from the families of clergy.\n\nBefore we criticize them anachronistically for not using the vernacular, we should be clear that the Church to this day by in large does not use the vernacular, but instead uses sacral languages such as Koine and Byzantine Greek, and Church Slavonic.\n\nIt befits the Divine to be spoken about well in a high and dignified language with reverence, and not to be trivialized in the same language as vulgar and profane matters.\n\nThis does not mean the language should be elitist and incomprehensible to the people, but at the same time, using a “kitchen language”, to discuss theology is often ineffective if not at times irreverent.\n\nHow could one discuss the incarnation of Our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, or the mystery of the Transfiguration in unstandardized rural speech, without using terms such as: Единородный (English: Only-Begotten; Greek: Μονογενὴς), единосущный, (Greek: ὁμοούσιον; consubstantial) пресуществление (Greek: μετουσίωσις; Latin: transsubstantiatio).\n\nHoly Mother Church has by means of the Cyrillo-Methodian tradition so dear to Rusyns given all Slavs a beautiful and dignified high sacral language—Church Slavonic, in which to approach these mysteries with the reverence they are due.\n\nAgain, this does not mean they are to be spoken about in a way incomprehensible to people—while this matter is a separate debate, it is the firm position of this author that pious Slavic speaking Orthodox Christians who have been churched we fully capable of understanding Church Slavonic, when often the primary difference is like the difference between this and the vernacular is like saying Christos Voskrese and Christos Voskres. The latter is simply a vulgar and profane renovationism.\n\nIn any case, Ruthenian Clergy often did not write in Church Slavonic, but in a Slavonified literary Russian language incorporating some elements of local dialects which could serve primarily as a tool of inter-Slavic and inter-Orthodox communication.\n\nWe should remember that Orthodox Christians confess One, Holy, Catholic, and Apostolic Church, not One Holy Russian Church, Rusyn Church, or One Holy Ukrainian Church.\n\nThe word Catholic—Sobornaya—meaning gathered together, completely full, lacking in nothing, in some cases universal is a key mark of the Church.\n\nIt is not the goal of Rusyn, Ukrainian, or Russian priests to be Rusyn or Ukrainian or Russian, it is the goal to be Christian, religion should not be used as a tool to promote nationalism.\n\nIt is perfectly fine to love and support your nation and for priests to participate in these national literary movements, but this is distinct from their role as clergy.\n\nOften when speaking to the people in spiritual contexts, it befits the clergy to speak in an ecclesiastical language.\n\nSlavono-Russian is a very useful language especially for sermons and letters between Slavic Christians. Those who think in nationalistic terms first may argue why not the vernacular, but they are forgetting the Catholicity of the Church.\n\nWhat if a priest is speaking or writing not only for Carpatho-Rusyns but also for Belarusians, for Moldovans or Romanians, or for Serbs? In what language should he speak, his local dialect which others may not understand, or should he discuss grand matters of faith and nation with the broader world in a lingua franca of the time which could be understood by more people. The primary goal of language is after all to communicate and be understood.\n\nThis is no different than Rusyn activists engaging the broader world in English rather than in Rusyn, if they can speak English as a language of international communication, why is English acceptable but another Slavic language unacceptable and contrived.\n\nIf one is arguing this language reflects the everyday spoken language of the people, this is incorrect and a separate matter, however just because it’s not vernacular does not mean it does not possess its own cultural and historical value and context.\n\nAgain, we should remember nobody in the Church at the time of Dukhnovych was using the vernacular language to communicate, services were always in Slavonic, Greek or Latin, so we should not apply these modern concepts of a vernacular language to a time when a sacral was still dominant in church matters.\n\nWe should consider the fine example of Saint Nikolai Velimirovich and his Slavono-Serbian language, which essentially fulfilled the same role within the Cyrillo-Methodian traditions.\n\nIf Dukhnovych and others had written only in the vernacular language, his works would only have largely been known to local peoples, and would never have gained the acclaim and readability they have by other Slavic nations, as to this day we are still fighting to promote Rusyn literacy.\n\nSlavono-Russisn in some ways can be seen as a perfectly natural evolution of the Slavonic literary tradition, even if the end result itself was an artificial literary language, it still belongs to the broader tradition of Slavonic literacy.\n\nSo, while we can’t call it vernacular, we must also not look down on it as contrived when much of its common Slavonic lexicon may even be far older than the spoken languages of Russian, Ukrainian, Belarusian, and Rusyn today. Even if it appeared to take “Russian words” it is often the case that the Russian language itself was standardized and elevated by the use of Slavonic and Ruthenian texts, and these “Russian” words are in fact common and universal Slavonic words.\n\nDukhnovych and others simply elevated the Rusyn word from the local and regional to the Catholic (Sobornii) and Universal world. Now that the Rusyn people have survived the storms, we now may promote spoken vernacular Rusyn on that world stage, but we should respect what came before.\n\nRegardless of its language, the symbolic value of Dukhnovych’s to Rusyn literature cannot be overstated. It may very well be considered the beginning of Rusyn literary tradition, not because the language used is particularly close to vernacular Rusyn, but for its symbolic value alone.\n\nYa Rusyn Byl’, in the most literal and straightforward way, openly declares to the world that Rusyns are Rusyns, they always were, and always will be. It goes on to emphasize this and the connection with the Carpathians (mentioning the Beskids of Poland) and contains the piety of the Cyrillo-Methodian Traditions.\n\nIt can be considered as beginning Rusyn Literary History in that it’s a work of Rusyn Literature that begins by literally declaring one’s Rusyness. What could be more Rusyn? As a result, we may conclude that regardless of whichever of these works we consider the beginning of Rusyn literature, Rusyn literary history begins in the 19th century, along with many others, around the spring of nations.\n\nTo be clear, when we say Rusyn history begins with these 19th-century works, this does not mean that Carpatho-Rusyns only existed from, or were invented in the 1800s! They existed ages before, there are just little extant documents to study recorded, literary history, but this does not mean the people were not there. The monumental and immortal words of Dukhnovych merely represent the symbolic cultural and literary milestone when the Carpatho-Rusyns first begin affirming themselves as Rusyns.\n\nThe anthem and prayer make absolute their resolve, that having had withstood the shock and storms of Mongolia, of Austria, of Hungary, and the world, they were, are, and will always be Rusyns.\n\nAs an Orthodox Christian could say:\n\nAll the nations have surrounded them, surrounding them and encompassing them about, but in the name of the Lord they have overcame them, and this little Carpathian rock of faith, though she was smaller than a mustard seed, has risen taller than a mountain, and become the cornerstone of a resurrected people. This is the Lord’s doing, and it is marvelous in our eyes.\n\nIt must be emphasized again, that if we accept the 1851 Pozravlenia of Dukhnovych as the beginning of Carpatho-Rusyn national-literary history, this does not mean they did not exist centuries before. It is the same as we know Slavs existed long before the mission of Saints Cyril and Methodius, however without written sources, we cannot study their history, but there are other archeological and linguistic means of learning about prehistoric people, such as attempting to learn from remains and foreign sources, or academic reconstruction of language and culture.\n\nCarpatho-Rusyns also have every right to claim the earlier Pan-Rusian histories, such as the medieval Primary Chronicle, as the start of their literary history. the Pozravlenia may merely represent the start of a distinct Carpatho-Rusyn literary tradition, but the legacy of Old Rus’ shall always belong to Rusyns by birthright.\n\nWho may claim Rus’?\n\nThe Legacy of Rus’, is highly contested; not only who may claim it, but what it means and entails to be a part of Rus’, is highly debated among East Slavs.\n\nThe issue does not so much pertain to Rusyns, as it does to the larger East Slavic nations.\n\nRusynophilia is not hostile to other East Slavs — Rusyns just want to be Rusyn\n\nRusyns were practically Carpathian Lambs compared to the violent and often vitriolic nationalist movements we see surrounding them. Whereas Rusyns have never been chauvinistic towards Ukrainians, Russians, and other neighbors, they are not always mutually treated so equitably.\n\nRusyns for example, have never denied Ukrainians or Russians their identity, they were never collectively against either people, whereas particularly Ukrainian and Russian nationalists may be quite hostile, chauvinistic, or imperialistic towards each other.\n\nUkrainian nationalists for example, often perceive Rusyn identity or even Rusyn nationalism as some kind of threat to them, as separatism of aggression, when it couldn’t be farther than the truth! Rusyn identity is by in large, with relation to Ukrainians, defensive, not attacking but simply defending its place. Rusyns do not wish to harm Ukrainians, and most have no desire to take part in some conflict between a Russian or Ukrainian world, Rusyns merely ask for their basic God-given human right — the right to exist.\n\nSo, the fact is, Rusyns are not the ones denying anyone’s nationality or claims to Rus’, and for that matter, nobody—at least among Russians and Ukrainians—are particularly denying Rusyn claims to Rus’, if anything they emphasize their Rus’ heritage and ignore the significant Vlach or White Croat aspect, which makes them distinct from all other Rus’ peoples. In any case, Rusyns are not causing internecine strife over the legacy of Rus’.\n\nWe know that by the 14th century, there were effectively two poles, two worlds which Rus’ was divided to, the South-West and the North-East, and a conflict or disparity would emerge between the two of them in nearly all spheres, political, theological, philosophical and cultural.\n\nThe two primary polities which these lands evolved into are the Russian Federation and Ukraine, and here is where we see the conflict over succession to Rus’ most heated—by in large between Russian and Ukrainian histographies and nationalists.\n\nThe primary argument is simple: who is the successor of Rus’, and what does it mean to be part of Rus’.\n\nThe primary stumbling block here is the false issue of subordination and the role of the nation-state.\n\nThat is to say, people assume that if they belong to Rus’, they must be subordinated to the ruling polity and state of Rus’.\n\nTherefore, many Ukrainians do not wish to be part of a “Russian World” in as much as this "
