Before World War I, the region was owned by Hungary, and it became a part of Czechoslovakia during the Interwar period. In 1938, Carpatho-Ukraine briefly declared independence, only to be annexed by Hungary. After the end of World War II, it became a part of the Ukrainian SSR, and the capital of Ungvar was renamed to Uzhhorod, the new capital of Zakarpattia Oblast. The region was home to the Rusyns, the name given to ethnic Ukrainians who decided not to adopt the name \"Ukrainian\" due to their lack of ancestral ties to the rest of the country.\n\nGallery[]"
