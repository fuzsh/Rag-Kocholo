        "text": "Even in the initial weeks of the invasion, Ukrainians who were fleeing the bombs in cities like Mariupol and Kharkiv fled here, and companies from Kyiv relocated their headquarters to Uzhhorod. Families come here, especially men who are not allowed to leave the country, to take a little vacation from the war. Others come in an attempt to avoid it altogether – by escaping across the nearby borders to Central Europe.\n\nElena, a teacher, fled from Kherson in the south with her grandson Trofim to escape the Russian invaders. A childhood friend, who had moved to Uzhhorod shortly before the war, took them in. \"We were terribly tense, we left Kherson with only two bags,\" she says of their escape in July 2022. \"And then we saw this city,\" she says. \"Everything was so slow and quiet here. People slow down for pedestrians and wait patiently for their change at the check-out. They even speak more softly than they do where we're from.\" She observes her new everyday life like an anthropologist out in the field. \"The people here live in paradise, but they don't even grasp it.\" Kherson has since been liberated, but the attacks there are still frequent and her home was destroyed, anyway. She wants to stay here. \"Where else should I go? And it's beautiful here.\"\n\nUzhhorod's location behind the Carpathian Mountains, in the far west of the country on the border with Slovakia, has made the city the headquarters of escapism. Even before the war, it had been a city of pastry shops, cafés and strollers. It feels like history has taken a winding detour to arrive in the Uzhhorod of the present, as the perfect antithesis to the current nightmare. Until the World War I, the city belonged to the Austro-Hungarian Empire, and it almost became part of Hungary after the war. It then spent 19 years as part of Czechoslovakia. In the next war, the Hungarians marched in; and in 1944, the Germans deported and murdered almost the entire Jewish community. Then came the Soviet army, which drove out and murdered thousands of people belonging to the former Hungarian ethnic majority, followed by several bleak decades as the westernmost outpost of the Soviet Union.\n\nBut the city still had a few things going for it: Coffee. Pastries. A dormant legacy that began to revive with the collapse of the Soviet empire. \"I always wanted to bake, even as a child,\" recalls Valentin Shtefanyo, now the most famous pâtissier in Uzhhorod. He's standing in a narrow room next to his bakery. \"In 1991, I was in fifth grade when everything collapsed,\" he says. \"My mother withdrew the last 600 rubles from her account to pay for a course as a confectioner.\"\n\nA Life for Fine Pastries\n\nJust as eastern Ukraine traditionally looked to Russia, Uzhhorod had its eyes fixed firmly on the West, with Shtefanyo seeking inspiration from France, where his older sister Valentina had already emigrated. \"I went to Paris and realized: I know nothing,\" he says. \"It was a shock.\" He was accepted to the pastry school in Chanteloup-les-Vignes near Paris, became well known and eventually competed for Ukraine at the Mondial des Arts Sucrés, the world championship of confectioners, in 2008. He then returned to Uzhhorod.\n\nSince 2009, he and his sister have been running Shtefanyo, where macaroons, the difficult-to-make meringues made from almond flour, are stacked up in all the colors of the rainbow next to glazed fruit towers and objects fashioned out of marzipan. Nearby are the espresso bar Byron, Café Tokyo and the Irish pub Egan, but there isn't a McDonald's or Starbucks to be found in the entire city.\n\nThe War Arrives in a Roundabout Way\n\nUzhhorod quietly withdrew from the world and created its own.\n\nIn the same way that it is now, miraculously, avoiding the war. Is the city simply too far away, too strategically unimportant and too insignificant for the Russians to launch their missiles over the Carpathians? Is it located too close to the border with Slovakia? The reasons are mere speculation, but the calm is real.\n\nIndeed, the war only reaches Uzhhorod in a roundabout way. In the narrow room next to the bakery, where Shtefanyo tells his story, a flour-dusted young man walks past. \"He fled from Mariupol,\" Shtefanyo explains - the devastated port city deep in the Russian-occupied south - \"like some others here. At the beginning of the war, the population shot up from 110,000 to 150,000 in just a single week. We baked almost only bread, day and night.\" Twice a month, he drives a van full of food to Kharkiv, near the front in the east, delivering it to the unit of an old friend of his. \"Of course, we care about what is going on. But you also have to live.\"\n\nIt may be a split existence, but it is still better than what he has seen from some people he knows. \"I have removed many past friends from my contact list. They want absolutely nothing to do with the war.\"\n\nIn that sense, Uzhhorod stands for the ambivalence of the Ukrainian attitude to the war: Life must go on, and normality should be maintained no matter what the cost. Ukrainians don't want to allow themselves to be shaken by the daily horrors of war because that would be tantamount to capitulation to the enemy.\n\nWhen you ask about the situation across the country, a popular answer is \"Normalna.\"\n\nThere is something seductive about this normality. Many have begun asking themselves: Why should I go to the front? The attitude was markedly different in the initial weeks following the Russian invasion. People were lining up to volunteer. \"In spring 2022, we all felt an existential threat,\" military chaplain Andriy Zelinskyy recently wrote in the newspaper Ukrainska Pravda. \"Today, the danger of Russian missile fire has not diminished. But you can completely escape into the illusion of an alternative reality.\"\n\nSociety, meanwhile, is drifting further and further apart. \"Some have been sitting in the trenches for a year and a half and see the extent of the mutilation and death every day,\" writes Zelinskyy. \"The others live in Kyiv, Odessa or Lviv and donate or are thinking about donating, and want to be as far away from the war as possible.\"\n\nSome Flee Into Their Imaginations, others Across the River\n\nUzhhorod isn't just a destination for small escapes – it's also a staging ground for bigger ones. South of the city, Ukraine's border with Hungary and Romania runs along the bends of the Tisza River for a stretch. Many men seeking to avoid conscription flee across the Tisza. Some underestimate its depth or the power of the current, and bodies have been found washed up on the banks on several occasions.\n\n\"People here say they are unfamiliar with the war,\" muses Elena from Kherson, with the sharp eye of a newcomer. \"But that's not true.\" The war also comes to them. It may not arrive in the form of a rocket screeching toward its target, but it manifests itself with a sad song emanating from car. \"The hearse carrying soldiers drives through Mynaiska Street almost every day. Then it plays the song 'A Duckling Swims in the Tisza,'\" a folk song from Transcarpathia that has become a requiem for those who have fallen in the war. \"They always play it. We live on the ninth floor, but we hear it every time.\"\n\nA man is visiting a friend who died in July in Bakhmut, Ukraine's most embattled city, and is gazing at the plastic flowers on his grave marker. \"I hope all is well with you now,\" he says quietly, before quickly leaving. An elderly couple get out of a Lada and rake the small plot.\n\nA family stands at the grave of Danylo Boguslavskyi, born on April 7, 1990, and killed in action on October 16, 2022. \"We always come on Saturdays,\" says his brother Roman. \"One Saturday, I drove him to the station. That was the last time we saw him. He was a lawyer and historian and was present at the Maidan protests in Kyiv in 2014. He volunteered after Russia's invasion and was then wounded several times. For a while, he was in the hospital every month,\" Roman recalls. It was almost as if the injured man maintained the hope that, by getting wounded again and again, he would be given a reprieve and would never be killed. Until he was.\n\n\"He's Behind the Sun\"\n\nHis brother Roman says that Danylo had been single before the war, before then meeting his girlfriend at the conscription office. They were together for seven months, and now he has been dead for longer than they were a couple. When Roman's five-year-old daughter, who skips carefree between the flowers and crosses of the graves, asks where Uncle Danylo is now, he always tells her: \"He's behind the sun. Wherever you are, look up to the sun. He's somewhere behind it. What am I supposed to tell her?\"\n\nRoman Boguslavskyi works for the military police. He may be in uniform, but he only drives through the villages and towns in the area searching for draft-dodgers. He is deeply frustrated. \"There are no more volunteers,\" he says. \"We aren't even reaching the manageable target figures set by the recruitment offices. I can't listen to another person say, 'I only have one life to live.'\"\n\nMeanwhile, stories about unfair conscription practices are circulating all over Ukraine. Almost everyone knows or has heard of cases of exemptions for bribes or because of good connections, of raids by the military police at subway entrances. The bicycle thief in the countryside who was given the choice of jail or war; the man who wanted to go hiking in the Carpathians, was stopped and found himself in a military unit just 31 hours later. All the provincial chiefs of the military offices were replaced in the summer, but that didn't solve the volunteer shortage.\n\nPlate after plate of Uzhhorod cake, Valentin's most popular creation, is now being served in the afternoon. \"Meringue, almonds, a light mousse and confiture de lait,\" milk caramelized to different degrees. At one table, a father struggles to speak Ukrainian while his five-year-old son babbles blithely away in Russian. A few tables away, a businessman explains the turmoil of his Soviet origins. He says his father moved from Ukraine to Kyrgyzstan under Stalin, while his wife's parents came to Ukraine from Uzbekistan and now live in Kyiv and Austria.\n\nValentin Shtefanyo is in a hurry. The daughter of the city's largest building contractor, who is also a local politician, is getting married in the evening. An oligarch's country wedding, outside Uzhhorod in a new hotel built in the park next to the ruin of a medieval castle. Shtefanyo is responsible for the catering and, more importantly, the multi-tiered wedding cake. \"If you want, come with me later,\" he says as he leaves, wearing his earbuds.\n\nThe drive through the wooded hills to the castle hotel takes half an hour. The cake is transported in two parts, one directly behind the other on a palette, inside an extremely carefully driven vehicle. Suddenly, uniformed men stop the car on the thoroughfare. \"Military police! Your papers please!\" At least those of the men. The checkpoints have long since become more relaxed in other parts of Ukraine, even near the front, where people get a quick glance before being nodded through. But not in places like this, where the conscripts like to hide. \"What are you doing out here so late?\" Shtefanyo answers that he's a baker, but it doesn't get him very far.\n\n\"How Many Drones Could You Have Bought for the Cost of this Wedding?\"\n\nThe frustrated military policemen on the hunt for draft-dodgers interrupt him. \"So what?\" Three men of military age apparently look rather suspicious. \"We're on our way to a wedding to deliver the cake,\" Valentin says. \"Ah.\" They still closely examine the papers before allowing them to pass.\n\nIn the park, where the cake is to be placed between two-and-a-half-meter high rose arrangements, there is still no sign of the wedding party, only security guards and electricians for the fireworks, directed by the manager with a walkie-talkie. Valentin and two helpers are busy for a half an hour attaching huge petals of shimmering transparent sugar to the cake with a gas burner. Although he is satisfied with his work, he's not particularly pleased with the contract itself. \"How many drones could you have bought for the cost of this wedding?\" he mumbles, melding the last sugar petal to the towering cake.\n\nCasualties and cakes: That seems to be the recipe for life in Uzhhorod these days. More radical than Valentin Shtefanyo is his old acquaintance, whom he supplies at the front twice a month. Professor Fedir Shandor, who is still the director of the institute at the local university, taught philosophy and sociology there. Immediately after the invasion began, he volunteered as a soldier, joined the front lines in Donbas and, from that point on, began streaming his lectures from various trenches.\n\nLectures from the Trenches\n\nSetting up a meeting with him is complicated, but it finally works out at a freeway service station in the middle of Ukraine, some 1,200 kilometers east of Uzhhorod. He is currently transporting a dead man to Kyiv.\n\nShandor's unit has been deployed everywhere in the east – Kharkiv, Izium, Sloviansk. He has been wounded himself, and seven officers died in a Russian ambush, he says. Suddenly, even his small unit was left without a commander. Then an agreement came from above that the men themselves should choose who would lead them. They picked Shandor.\n\nShandor led his platoon for a month and a half and has been responsible for \"military-civil cooperation\" since May. For bringing the dead home, shuttling them throughout the country. Once he arrives at his destination, he is confronted by tears and distraught mothers, wives, siblings and, in Kyiv, overworked forensic experts.\n\n\"I can understand why people want to avoid it all,\" he says, \"and I love the leisure of Uzhhorod. It doesn't bother me that the youngsters drink through the night – in fact, I'm fighting for that way of life!\" He says he's also in favor of Europe staying \"fat and rich,\" but he also thinks \"it should give a little more in this fight. Sometimes you have to be prepared to die for the way you want to live.\"\n\nHe says that death no longer frightens him. Whenever he visits his hometown, though, Shador says he always goes to Shtefanyo's cafe. Where he orders the Uzhhorod cake.\n\nWith additional reporting by Fedir Petrov"
