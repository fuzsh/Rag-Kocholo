        "text": "OVERVIEW\n\nUzhhorod Oblast is divided into 13 administrative districts and 3 cities of oblast subordination, 295 township and village councils. There are 10 towns, 20 townships, and 298 villages in the oblast.\n\nThe oblast is rich and diverse. Forests, which constitute its major wealth, cover about 50% of the territory, the forest stock is 687,000 ha. The natural composition of the Carpathian forests is rather diverse with prevalence of hard-leaved (62.2%) and coniferous (29.9%) species. The total wood reserve is 157,800,000 cubic m., including 37,040,000 cubic m of mature stands.\n\nMineral and raw material base of the oblast is represented by nearly 150 deposits of over 30 kinds of minerals, including the ones non-traditional in Ukraine (polymetals, alunites, pearlites, zeolites, liparites).\n\nReserves of rock salt of the Solotvyn deposit, amount6ing to 3.5 billion tons are rather significant among the oblast non-metallic minerals. The zeolite deposits (their estimated reserves amount to 1 billion tons) are the only ones in Ukraine and especially promising for development. Within the Byiganian alunite deposit they have explored 5.7 million tons of barite ores used to obtain boring solutions when boring deep wells, including those for oil and gas.\n\nGermanium, which is used as semiconductor in modern radio electronics, instrument engineering, space technology and other fields, is of great value at the world market. The proved but not yet mined reserves of the deposit make 850 tons, the predicted reserves amount to 1,900-2,000 tons.\n\nThe oblast has a great potential for development of porcelain and faience industry, kaoline being its raw-material. Zakarpattya kaoline (its reserves exceed 5 million tons) is exceptionally white and has no analogues in Ukraine; by its chemical composition it is similar to Chinese kaoline.\n\nThe oblast is extremely rich in raw-materials for the construction industry. Thirteen (13) deposits of carbonate raw-materials (marble limestone, dolomite, marble) used as facing material, decorative crumb, limestone flour, construction limestone have been discovered.\n\nZakarpattya is rich in mineral and thermal waters, unique as to their medicinal properties and energetic power. Above 360 mineral water sources various as to their chemical composition and medicinal characteristics, with the total debit of about 10,000 cubic m. per day, have been discovered and examined. They are not inferior to the well-known waters of the Caucasus, Czech Republic, Poland, and France. Over 30 sources are exploited in the oblast, including 12 whose mineral water reserves (4,334.4 m3 /day) are acknowledged by the State Commission on Mineral Reserves.\n\nThe mineral waters having wonderful gustatory qualities, are used both by resort and sanatorium establishments as medicinal-table waters and by bottling plants. In the recent years the scale of mineral water bottling for everyday consumption has considerably increased. Presently about 30 business are into it.\n\nThe oblast is distinguished by favorable climatic conditions and a high natural recreational potential. 5.2% of the territorial and 5.1% of the cost potential of natural recreation resources of Ukraine are concentrated there.\n\nThe oblast is also rich in high quality fresh surface water an acute deficit for which is felt through all the south-east of Ukraine. Nearly one forth of the Ukrainian hydro-electric potential is concentrated on the oblast rivers, which opens opportunities for development of small-scale hydro-electric generation.\n\nZakarpattya is famous as an extremely popular place for health improvement and recreation.
