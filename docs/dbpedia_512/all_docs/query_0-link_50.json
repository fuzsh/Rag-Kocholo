        "text": "by Nick Burdine (2016)\n\nIn the southwest corner of Ukraine lies the mountainous region of Zakarpattia. Its residents live in the valleys and hills of the Carpathian Mountains, and its rugged terrain, relative isolation, and distance from metropolitan centers such as Kyiv, Prague, and Budapest has created a people which are highly independent and culturally unique. Contributing to its cultural distinctiveness is the region’s long and complicated history with its neighbors. At different times throughout its history, Zakarpattia has been a part of Ukraine, the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Romania, and on multiple brief occasions, has even been its own autonomous country (often referred to as Carpathian Ruthenia). Due to its shifting political boundaries and valuable geographic position, Zakarpattia has long been seen as an important strategic location by military leaders ranging from the Princes of Kievan Rus and Kings of Hungary, to the generals of the Soviet Union and NATO.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the summer of 2018, while serving as a Peace Corps volunteer in Zakarpattia, myself and a group of other volunteers, along with a number of Ukrainians working at a cultural center based out of Uzhhorod, hiked to an abandoned Soviet military installation and war memorial high in the forested hills above of Uzhhorod.\n\nMy party and I met in the city of Uzhhorod, the administrative capital of Zakarpattia, and drove northeast into the hills. We watched as the black cobblestone roads and baroque churches of central Uzhhorod turned into pothole-laden highways and Soviet-grey apartment buildings found on the outskirts of many Eastern European cities. Those highways turned into the dusty dirt roads of small farming communities and the apartment buildings became vast fi elds of wheat and corn punctuated by small agricultural estates. We kept driving until we came to the mud tracks and steep forested slopes of the Carpathian foothills. The traffic had all but stopped save for the odd farmer crossing the road with his livestock. Some with cows, then others with goats, some on horseback, and others with rickety carts fi lled with fi rewood. We had been driving for maybe two hours, but we couldn’t have gone more than 50 miles because of how bad the roads are throughout the region.\n\nWe finally came to the location where we would be camping for the next two days. A stone and wood cabin built in the traditional Slavic style of the area, featuring a large hexagonal hearth and kitchen on the bottom floor, a second floor directly above the hearth where people would sleep, and all built around a long central chimney which would heat the entire structure. That night, we ate a traditional Carpathian meal which refl ected the rich cultural tapestry of the region. There was shashlik (barbecued pork common across Eastern Europe), varenyky (dumplings filled with potatoes and served with sautéed onions and hot butter, similar to Russian pierogis), kremzlyky (fried potato pancakes most likely adopted from Polish Jews), bograch (hearty vegetable soup cooked with Hungarian paprika), brinza (mild goat cheese), salo (raw pig fat), pickled sweet tomatoes, beet and cabbage salad, and served with Romanian plumb brandy and homemade Carpathian wine.\n\nThe next day, we set out early on our nearly 30-mile roundtrip hike. The forest was rich with summer lushness, a sea of green from the resident birch, maple, and oak, and golden sunlight spilling over our heads. Our destination was Ukrainian-Carpathian hills. The war memorial was a well-known hiker’s pilgrimage—a mountain peak built in the 1970s and was erected to commemorate on the border between Ukraine and Slovakia with a the Ukrainian partisans (secret guerrilla fighters who commanding view of the surrounding hillside and a sided with the Soviet Union and fought against the war memorial, built near the ruins of a Soviet military occupying Nazi forces in the Second World War).\n\nWe arrived at our destination around midday while the sun was directly overhead, before it started to retreat beyond the horizon where it would cast long shadows over the forest. The clear summer skies and noontime sun aff orded us a spectacular view of the remote hills sprawling out in every direction from our location. Two giant steel crosses had been erected at the peak where we were standing, as is common across the peaks of the Ukrainian-Carpathians. The first was a simple Latin cross, and the second a slightly more ornate Orthodox cross. These two crosses represented the major ethno-religious groups of the region. The first cross being a symbol of the Catholic Poles, Slovakians, Hungarians, Romanians and Greek Catholic Rusyns (people believed to be the direct modern descendants of the people of Kievan Rus who settled the area in the eighth century); the second cross symbolizing the Orthodox Ukrainians and Russians. Standing next to these crosses beside the World War II memorial and looking out to the west, one can see the Slovakian border—demarcated by nothing more than wood and rock.\n\nWars are fought, empires fall, and boundaries change, but people do not always move. Expressions of culture—architecture, food, religion, language—have a habit of sticking around long after political borders are continually drawn and redrawn.\n\nThe military site was a series of small concrete buildings. There was a garage where the rockets would have been stored on the backs of large trucks and ready to be deployed at a moment’s notice, a communications building where soldiers would have had radio and sensing equipment, and a small barracks where soldiers would have lived. Today, those buildings are long deserted and have turned to ruin. The concrete has crumbled to piles of rubble, water and mold occupy its chambers, vegetation has come to reclaim its walls, and local artists have turned it into a shrine for graffiti. Now, the compound is a monument to a dead empire of the not-too-distant past.\n\nOutside, looking across the hills to the Slovakian border, I spoke in Ukrainian with our guides and friends from the Uzhhorod Cultural Center. They spoke mostly Ukrainian, but at times interjected it with words from Russian, Hungarian, Polish, Romanian, Slovakian, or words believed to be derived from Old Ruthenian, the language of the ancient Rusyns. This is known as the Trans-Carpathian dialect and is often looked down upon and made fun of by the “pure” Ukrainian speakers of western Ukraine, and the Russian speakers of eastern Ukraine. To outsiders, this dialect seems to be a unified and cohesive language belonging solely to the inhabitants of the Carpathian hills, but in reality, it is a dynamic system of languages which changes in every valley and in every community. A village might speak a slightly different version of the dialect from another village merely 30 miles down the river, or justbeyond the hills in another valley.\n\nWars are fought, empires fall, and boundaries change, but people do not always move. Expressions of culture—architecture, food, religion, language—have a habit of sticking around long after political borders are continually drawn and redrawn. Zakarpattia stands as one of the finest examples of these cultural mixing pots, sitting at the crossroads of so many Eastern European nations."
