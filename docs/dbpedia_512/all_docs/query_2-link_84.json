        "text": "The Corvallis Sister Cities Association is part of a 30-year relationship between Corvallis, Oregon and Uzhhorod, Ukraine.\n\nBecause Uzhhorod is located in the most western region of Ukraine, thousands of refugees are fleeing each day to Corvallis' Sister City. The citizens of Uzhhorod are mobilizing to provide comfort, support, and humanitarian aid to those who have had to flee the violence. To help alleviate the needs of these individuals, the Corvallis Sister Cities Association is raising funds to send to friends and colleagues in Uzhhorod.\n\nChecks and cash can be dropped off at or mailed to Citizens Bank branches in the Willamette Valley. Make checks payable to \"Uzhhorod Refugee Fund.\"\n\nYou can also donate through the Corvallis Sister Cities Association's GoFundMe by clicking here.\n\nNote that due to the urgent nature of this fund, and for expediency of the transfer of money, donations are not deductible.\n\nLet's stand with Uzhhorod and Ukraine!"
