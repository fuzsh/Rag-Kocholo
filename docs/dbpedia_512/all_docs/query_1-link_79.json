Glorify Him! (Christos Razdajetsja!, Slavite Jeho!). Good afternoon (evening). As you see, I am not alone. My friends and I are shepherds and we come from the land of Bethlehem. We brought with us the manager of Bethlehem; in it rests the newly-born Savior of the world, the Son of God. We would like to tell you the story of the birth of Jesus in Bethlehem.\n\nOld Shepherd: Gather around me, my friends, and I will tell you what happened to me while I tended my flock. A brilliant light appeared in the heavens and brightened the fields around me (Outside, the begin singing: \"Angels from Heaven...\") I seemed to hear angelic voices in the air. I did not understand it but somehow I felt that something very special was happening. (The angels, while still singing, enter the house, carrying the church. When the shepherds see the angels, they fall to their knees. The angels, still singing, place the church down and complete their song.)\n\nOld Shepherd: Rise my fellow shepherds. The angels have come from heaven to us poor and simple shepherds to announce the joyous news that in Bethlehem we will find the promised Messiah, the Savior whom men have been waiting for since Godâs promise in Paradise.\n\nThird Shepherd: Let us go there so that we might glorify him.\n\nOld Shepherd: Yes, my friends, let us go to Bethlehem, where God has been born as Man. We will leave our sheep here. The Lord will look after them for us. On our way we can sing a hymn to God. (The shepherds stand around the church and sing: \"Eternal God, Boh Predvicnyj.) After the singing of the carol, the shepherds kneel one at a time before the church.)\n\nFirst Shepherd: O Jesus, my Savior, grant my prayer. I am but a poor shepherd, but I do have faith in You, Grant, O Lord, that I would remain faithful to You all my life.\n\nSecond Shepherd: O Jesus, my lifeâs Joy, shower me with your blessings and grand what I pray for. My Lord, my only possession is hope in You.\n\nThird Shepherd: O Lord, like the others, I too came here to worship You. My only gift is my love; I offer it to You. Grand that my love for You would ever grow and grow.\n\nFourth Shepherd: Look down upon me with mercy, O Savior. You have brought salvation to men of all ages. Grant, I pray, that I too may be saved.\n\nOld Shepherd: O Lord, your aged servant humbly bows before You. Bless us, O dear Jesus, all men, the entire world. Fill menâs hearts with Your love that they would love each other. With this beautiful hymn we offer You glory. (All shepherds rise and sing: \"Heaven and earth-Nebo I Zemla.\" After the carol, the old shepherd speaks.)\n\nOld Shepherd: My dear fellow Christians, we are deeply grateful for your warm reception. Our sincere \"Thank You\" and the best wishes of this Holy Christmas Season. May the good Lord Jesus, grant you all you need. May He bless you with health and happiness. May these gifts of the Lord be yours for many years.\n\nAll Sing: God grant you many years (2), God grant you many, happy years.

He was raised in the picturesque village of ZbudskÃ¡ BelÃ¡ and his family celebrated a traditional orthodox Christmas.\n\n\"The traditional Ruthenian Christmas was a ritual. In the evening the oldest member of the family started the celebration by calling everybody to follow him to a spring. There, we all washed our hands and faces. Then we went to our farm to give thanks to the animals, from which we earned our living, by feeding them with bread.\n\nFrom there, we went back to the house, where one of the members of the family (usually the wife) had stayed. We all greeted her with 'Christos raÅ¾dajet sa' ['Jesus Christ was born'] and she replied 'Slavite jeho' ['Celebrate him']. Then we all sat down at the table, which was surrounded by a chain, and on which honey, bread and garlic were laid.\n\n\"Why? The honey symbolized good and understanding, the bread life, garlic health, and the chain was a reminder that the family had stayed together. If somebody in the family had died that year, there was a chair and a plate prepared for him at the table.\n\n\"First, everybody prayed. Then the head of the family gave his speech and then we ate. After honey, bread and garlic, kapustnica followed - but without sausage as we still fasted - then hrÃ­bovÃ¡ maÄanka [mushroom sauce], pirohy s kapustou [boiled dumplings with cabbage] and at the end bobaÄ¾ky s makom [baked damper bread with poppy seeds].\n\n\"Then we sat at the table, talked and waited for koÄ¾adnykov [carol singers], while eating makovnÃ­k [poppy seed strudel] and drinking slivovica.\"\n\nBycko also remembers his parents bringing a wisp of straw into the room in which the children slept. It symbolised the place where Jesus was born. And when he was young he believed the words of the old men to be true that at midnight the water in the village's spring turned into wine.\n\n\"As teenagers, we tried to drink it, but it did not cheer us up. Instead of a hangover, we ended up stuffed with cold water.\"\n\n12/23/2002\n\nSome of the traditional recipes which are made for Velija (Holy Supper) are listed below.

A revered saint, both in the Catholic and Orthodox faiths, his feast day of December 6th is a prelude to the Christmas season. While the name of Saint Nicholas has become synonymous with Santa Claus, this beloved saint was not imaginary and his positive traits are universally known. Saint Nicholas was born to an affluent family in the second half of third century in Asia Minor. After his parent's death, it is told he offered his inheritance to assist those who were destitute. Turning from a comfortable position in life, he would eventually devote himself to the poor, oppressed and neglected. Saint Nicholas was orphaned at an early age and no doubt this made him very sensitive to those who experienced hardships. Later on, he studied and was ordained to the priesthood. This was the beginning of his service to God and those entrusted to his care. Many stories offer that he served the poor, comforted the suffering and strove to protect the innocent. There are also numerous legends and miracles attributed to Saint Nicholas. Some well known events from his life are saving three maidens who were to be sold into an evil lifestyle, raising three young men back to life who had been murdered and returning a young man who had been abducted to his parents. There are abundant legends regarding Saint Nicholas and these have gained him recognition as a patron saint. One legend states while traveling by ship, a fierce storm developed. While others on board thought they were lost, Saint Nicholas began to pray and the storm disappeared. It is due to this legend that Saint Nicholas is revered as the patron of sailors. Not only sailors but countries and churches have adopted him as their patron. Saint Nicholas is the patron saint of the Greek Catholic church. He is also the patron saint of Greece, Russia and Sicily. He is the patron of a wide variety of professions and people with some being bakers, children, pharmacists, pilgrims, students, the poor, travelers and unmarried women.\n\nWhen the Archbishop of Myra died, Saint Nicholas was chosen to take his position. The story is told that the bishops could not decide upon a candidate. God revealed to the bishops his preference that the first priest to enter the cathedral was his choice. When Saint Nicholas entered the cathedral to say his morning prayers, the bishops realized who was chosen. During his life, Saint Nicholas devoted himself to the service of the poor and unwanted. He was also known as a defender of those incorrectly judged and individuals who were treated unfairly. After a lifetime of service to God, he passed away on December 6th. Saint Nicholas was interred within the cathedral but later his remains were transported to Italy. Even to this day, fragrant myrrh flows from the relics of Saint Nicholas. Numerous healings have been attributed to him and have earned him the title \"Wonder Worker\". There are uncounted churches within Eastern Europe and Russia named for Saint Nicholas. A few of these churches are the magnificent Naval St. Nicholas Cathedral of the Epiphany in Russia (1753-1762), the elegant wooden church of St. Nicholas in Krivka, Ukraine (1763), and the wooden church of Saint Nicholas in Bodruzal, Slovakia (1658). Not just a saint for centuries past but even today, many benefits are attributed to his intercession.\n\nIt is said that in 1907, miners from Pennsylvania instead of going to work attended liturgy for Saint Nicholas day. During this day there was an explosion at the mine and many individuals were killed. Those who attended the feast day of Saint Nicholas instead of working were spared. Another miracle during modern times is said to have taken place in Kiev during the 1920âs. A mother prayed that her son who was in the army would be released from service. After praying incessantly to Saint Nicholas, her son was randomly set free. There are many churches and wayside shrines dedicated to Saint Nicholas in the Carpathian Mountain regions. Many of these wayside shrines were erected in his honor due to favors and miracles received.\n\nDevotion to this Saint is especially strong within the Greek Catholic and Orthodox churches. Within the Greek Catholic church, there is a special hymn in his honor and numerous icons in both religions speak of his life and the miracles he performed. In the Slovak Republic, devotion to Saint Nicholas is very devout. Children today still receive small gifts on his feast day of fruit, candy or nuts. In various villages and towns, Saint Nicholas even makes an appearance. An adult will dress in a bishopâs vestment complete with miter and staff. Depending upon the village or town, he will \"greet\" the children and adults at the church or, by walking throughout the community. This yearly commemoration on the feast of Saint Nicholas is just as exciting for children as it is for adults. Saint Nicholas is revered and recognized throughout the world. His life of service and generosity make him the perfect saint to preface the Christmas season.\n\nGREEK CATHOLIC HYMN TO SAINT NICHOLAS\n\nTranscribed from the 1944 Moj Molitvennik (My Prayer Book)\n\nO kto, kto Nikolaju lâubit,\n\nO kto, kto Nikolaju sluzit,\n\nTomu svajatyj Nikolaj,\n\nNa vsjakij cas pomahaj;\n\nNikolaj, Nikolaj!\n\nO kto, kto zivet v jeho dvorâi,\n\nPomoscnik na zemlâi i morji,\n\nIzmet jeho ot napasti,\n\nNe dast jemu v hrâichi vpasti;\n\nNikolaj, Nikolaj!\n\nTROPAR:\n\nPravilo vâiry I obraz krostosti, vozderzanija ucitelâa, javi ta stadu tvojemu, jaze bescej istina; seho radi stazal jesi smirenijem vysokaja, niscetoju bohataja; otce svjascennonacalnice Nikolaje, moli Christa Boha, spastisja dusam nasim.\n\nTruth hath revealed thee a standard of faith, a pattern of kindliness and a teacher of temperance to thy flock. Thus, by humility thou hast gained exaltedness, by poverty, riches; Archpriest, Father Nicholas implore Christ God that our souls be saved.\n\nKONDAK:\n\nVo Murâich svjate, svjascennodijstvitel pokazalja jesi; Christovo bo, prepodobne, jevanhlije ispolniv, polozil jesi dusu tvoju o ludech tvojich, I spasl jesi nepovinnyja ot smerti; seho radi osvjatilsja jesi jako velikij tajinnik Bozija blahodati.\n\nIn Myra, O Holy Father, thou has shown thyself a true shepherd; for thou has fulfilled the Gospel of Christ. Thou has laid down thy life for thy people, and saved the innocent from death; wherefore thou has been exalted as a great dispenser of Godâs grace.\n\nA GREEK CATHOLIC PRAYER TO SAINT NICHOLAS\n\nO, our bountiful father and patron of our Greek Rite Catholic Church, Saint Nicholas! Shepherd and teacher of all those who fly to thy protection and by devout prayer call upon thee for aid, hasten and save the flock of Christ from the ravenous wolves and by thy holy prayers protect all Christian lands, save them from worldly disturbances, earthquakes, attacks from abroad, from internal strife, famine, flood, fire, sword and sudden death; and as thou had mercy on those three men in prison and saved them from the kingâs wrath, have mercy on me also and through thy intercession and aid, as well as through his own mercy and grace, may Christ, our God, allow me to lead a serene and sinless life, and save me from standing on \"His Left\" but may deem me worthy to stand on \"His Right\" with all the Saints. Amen.\n\nAN ORTHODOX PRAYER TO SAINT NICHOLAS\n\nHierarch and father, O most holy Nicholas, thou extraordinary Saint of the Lord, our loving defender and ready helper in sorrows everywhere, help us sinners and hapless ones in the present life, entreat the Lord God to grant us remission of all of our sins, that we have committed from our youth and all our life, by deed, word, though and all our senses; and in the passing of our souls, help us wretched ones; entreat the Lord God and Maker of all creation, to deliver us from trials and eternal torment: that we may always glorify the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit, and thy merciful intercession, now and ever, and unto ages of ages. Amen.\n\nThe Colors of Easter\n\nUkrainian faithful carry on an ancient art\n\ntext by Marvin Anderson; photos by Erin Edwards\n\nReprinted here with Permission of CNEWA\n\nâThings have certainly changed, but this store remains the same,â says Markian Surmach, the owner of Surma â a family-run shop in the heart of New York Cityâs historic Ukrainian neighborhood on the Lower East Side. âJust look at it,â he says, pointing to Taras Schevchenko Place across the street, where the Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art recently built a state-of-the-art facility. The steel-and-glass building occupies the full length of the city block, casting a long shadow over Surmaâs modest storefront in a prewar walk-up building.\n\nFor nearly a century, Surma has served the cityâs Ukrainian community, selling products from the homeland, such as traditional embroidered clothes and accessories, artwork, antiques and Ukrainian-language book and newspapers. âThey find their culture, and they find themselves here,â says Mr. Surmach. âPeople come to the store in search of a simpler and less complicated way of life.â Before getting lost in Surmaâs labyrinth of authentic Ukrainian treasures, patrons pass by a small glass showcase near the entrance. Inside, dozens of pysanky, or traditionally decorated chicken and goose eggs, shimmer on display. Radiant red, yellow and orange eggs intersperse with others dyed cooler hues of blue, green and violet. Intricate Christian and ancient pagan symbols adorn the surfaces.\n\nAs with most Slavs of Eastern Europe â Croats, Czechs, Poles, Rusyns and Slovaks â Ukrainians have cultivated the art of egg decoration to commemorate Christâs passion, death and resurrection. However, pysanky are also an intricate string in the collective fabric of Ukrainians and people of Ukrainian descent around the world. The designs serve as a living record and reminder of a shared, idyllic agrarian past.\n\nâTheyâre not just eggs,â explains Mr. Surmach. âThey have meaning. They represent a culture that respected the world around them.â In the Soviet era, authorities suppressed pysanky (from the Ukrainian verb pysaty, âto writeâ) along with other religious practices and most national cultural expressions. Nevertheless, Ukrainians continued making pysanky in secret, and they quickly emerged as emblems of national resistance.\n\nMr. Surmach himself readily shares the memory of the first time he decorated an egg. âI would have rather been out with my friends and not painting eggs,â he says with a laugh. Mr. Surmach still occasionally makes pysanky with family and friends. However, he imports from Ukraine those he sells in his shop. âI have respect for it now,â he says, as he carefully removes a small blue-and-white one from the showcase and holds it up to the light to reveal the designâs delicate detail. Artists and historians debate precisely when Slavs first began creating pysanky. Most, though, agree that the art form appeared in the region at least 2,000 years ago.\n\nThis is the history of a civilization,â says Sofika Zielyk, a renowned New York-area pysanky artist and friend of Mr. Surmach. She learned the basics of the craft from her mother, making her first psysanky at the age of 6. Now in her late 40âs, she has spent the last 20 years perfecting the art form. She has exhibited her work in galleries around the country, most notably at the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the American Craft Museum in New York City. According to Ms. Zielyk, the regionâs early inhabitants worshiped the sun god, Dazhbog, who warmed the earth and was the source of all life. As agrarian people, they depended on the sunâs rays to help cultivate the crops they needed to survive. The pagan cosmology reserved a sacred place for birds, as they alone could fly close to the sun god. The early Slavs, however, did have access to birdsâ eggs, whose yolk resembled the sun. They believed eggs possessed magical powers and cherished them as talismans.\n\nThey painted depictions of flora and fauna found in the natural world around them on the eggsâ surfaces with colors derived from organic materials. From berries, they extracted the color red; from leaves, green; and from tree bark, brown and orange. The early Slavic peoples eventually started drawing geometric designs, symbolizing elements of their cosmology. Many of the shapes have endured through the millennia and remain staples of pysankyâs vocabulary. After Slavs embraced Christianity from Byzantium in 988, they adapted many of their customs to Christianity. The egg itself, once the symbol of spring and natureâs ârebirth,â became that of Christâs resurrection and manâs rebirth. Traditional pysanky designs, too, changed meanings. The most common and iconic of them, the eight-pointed star, today represents Jesus Christ. In pagan times, however, it was the sign of Dazhbog.\n\nã\n\nExperts do not agree on when and where Christians began using decorated eggs to celebrate Easter. The oldest existing historical record of Christian-era pysanky in Ukraine dates back to only 1650, when French cartographer Guillaume Le Vasseur de Beauplan described them in his travel log from a visit to the country. Tanya Osadca, a celebrated psyanky artist and esteemed authority on Ukrainian folk art, concedes that other Slavic peoples and Greeks also have long traditions of decorating eggs in a similar fashion to commemorate the Christian holiday. The custom, she says, may even have developed in the West as early as the 13th century, after King Edward I of England gave members of his court colored eggs as gifts. âBut,â says Ms. Osadca about Ukrainian pysanky, âI donât think anyone else has such intricate designs.â\n\nPysanky artist Sofika Zielyk sits in a chair next to a small coffee table in the living room of her apartment on New York Cityâs Lower East Side. As she discusses her craft and its symbolism, she pulls out two baskets filled with pysanka eggs from beneath the table. âNo two eggs are the same,â she says. âNo matter what you do, the eggs will always look different.â he apartment feels more like a Ukrainian art museum than a home. Bookshelves filled with countless pysanky line the walls. Large plates hold bunches of the delicately painted eggs. Some are made of ceramic. Most, though, are ordinary chicken and goose eggs. A few large ones are ostrich eggs. Next to the bookshelves hang two paintings by the Ukrainian artist Opanas Zalyvakha. A Soviet dissident in the 1960âs and 1970âs, he was arrested, imprisoned, persecuted and finally exiled by Ukraineâs Communist authorities. The painter offered Ms. Zielyk the paintings â entitled âThe Risingâ and âMoscowâs Huge Embraceâ â in return for one of her decorated goose eggs. Though his health was failing at the time, Ms. Zielyk says her egg struck a chord with the master.\n\nâI told him it would keep evil spirits away,â she says. In response, he smiled, gallantly took her hand in his and kissed it. She selects an egg from her collection and holds it out. On it, she has painted a sequence of white circles around its circumference. She says wives usually offer pysanky with this pattern to husbands whom they suspect of infidelity. âThe hoops come off at night to bind the man,â she says with a coy smile. âI sell a lot of these.â The materials required to make traditional pysanky include virgin white eggs, candlewax, dye and a kistka, or a pencil- size stick with a tiny funnel attached at the end. With the large end of the kistkaâs funnel, the artist collects melted wax from a lit candle. The artist then draws the pattern or symbol onto the shell with the thin stream of liquefied wax as it exits the fine end of the funnel.\n\nâI enjoy lighting that match,â says Ms. Zielyk. âItâs the beginning of the process, and it relaxes me. Itâs a connection I have to something someone did 2,000 years ago, and Iâm doing it in modern-day Manhattan.â The artist then submerges the entire egg into a bowl of colored dye. The hardened wax protects the portion of egg it covers from the dye. The artist removes the egg, dries it and, depending on the design, adds patterns or symbols with the kistka. The process is repeated. As a final step, the artist carefully removes the wax. Only then do psyanky reveal their true colors. âYou canât move forward without looking back,â says Ms. Zielyk, as she slowly rotates one of her pysanky in her hand as if discovering it for the first time. A myriad of factors affect the outcome, says Ms. Zielyk. A shaky hand, a change in mood or an eggâs individual shape and texture can make or break a successful design. âItâs not a project for the impatient,â says Ms. Zielyk, adding that she has had students quit after realizing how difficult it is to create symmetrical motifs on an eggâs surface. Depending on the intricacy of the design, the process may take a few hours to a few days.\n\nYou have to have good eyes and steady hands,â she says, âand eventually a sore back.â Some people prefer to make pysanky using a much simpler method. A new product helps create colorful and intricate pysanky in just minutes. It consists of plastic decals saturated with reproductions of traditional pysansky. Tailored to fit standard eggs, the decal transfers its design onto an eggâs shell when submerged in water. âItâs cheating,â jokes Natalia Honcharenko, the museum director at the Ukrainian Historical and Educational Center of New Jersey. The center, nonetheless, sells the increasingly popular decals in its gift shop along with plastic eggs and other novelties. Serious aficionados may also purchase kistky, old-fashioned beeswax and step-by-step guidebooks and videos. The center â run by the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of America â plans to complete a 30,000 square-foot Ukrainian museum, which will house a permanent pysanky exhibit. In the meantime, it stores its collection of priceless works of art and artifacts, including paintings, portraits, sculptures and books â some of which are more than 300 years old â in the adjacent cultural center.\n\nâThis is one of our best in the collection,â says Ms. Honcharenko, as she carefully opens a green box filled with cards. On each of the cards is a hand-drawn image of a pysanka. In the 19th century, the Duchess Katerina Skarzy dispatched artists across Ukraine to draw pysanky and itemize the symbols in their designs and their meanings. The museum has more than 4,000 of the cards and an original copy of the catalog of the symbols. During World War II, many believed the set to have been destroyed and lost forever. Miraculously, though, Konstantyn and Olena Moschenko, natives of Poltava, Ukraine, managed to assemble and preserve it through the tumultuous period.\n\nIn 1961, Mr. and Mrs. Moschenko donated the collection to the church, which served as the foundation for the present archive and soon-to-open museum. Today, experts from around the world visit the center to study the cards. The artifacts help preserve Ukrainian culture, says Ms. Honcharenko, as she gently peruses the 200-year-old catalogue. âItâs important to know your past to know who you are,â she says. âIt helps shape you. This is what we will teach the next generation.â\n\nRuthenian Lenten FareThere is more to Eastern European food than sausage and cabbagetext by Jacqueline Ruyakphotographs by Cody Christopulos\n\nReprinted here with Permission of CNEWA\n\nA volunteer at St. Maryâs packs bags of peroghi, all of which will be sold.\n\nThere were many reasons I was looking forward to my first visit to eastern Czechoslovakia in 1991, but the cuisine was not one of them. Coming from a Slovenian-Slovak background, I was familiar with the regionâs food, the wide variety of sausages, the predominance of pork. I am not knocking the food, but I was pretty sure of some of its limitations.\n\nI am a vegetarian. For years I have lived in Japan, a country of ample culinary delights even for those, like me, who eschew meat.\n\nI would not be so lucky in Eastern Europe, or so I thought.\n\nThankfully, I was wrong. Not long after I arrived, I came across byrndza, a rich sheep cheese. It is commonly served with halusky, potato dumplings not unlike Italian gnocchi. On another day, I was treated to bite-size perohy, pockets of dough commonly stuffed with potato and cheese, sauerkraut or even fruit or jam. Better known as peroghi, they are popular in my home state of Pennsylvania. One summer in high school, I worked for a local peroghi producer, but the varieties I discovered in Eastern Europe were unlike any I had ever tasted.\n\nOver the years, I have made many more trips to the region, primarily to Slovakia (the eastern half of the former Czechoslovakia). Along with the previously described treats, I have happily subsisted on soups, potatoes and cabbage, the âking of vegetables,â according to the French who are said to know something about food.\n\nOne of my most memorable visits, on assignment for this magazine in the late 1990âs, was to Tichy Potok, a small Ruthenian village in the hardscrabble hinterlands of eastern Slovakia. The Ruthenians are Slavs, typically Greek Catholic, from the southern foothills of the Carpathian Mountains.\n\nIt was Good Friday, a day of fasting for this predominantly Greek Catholic village. All week, many of the villagers had fasted, most alternating days of meatless meals with days of only bread and water. But there were some exempted from the fast: the sick, nursing mothers, travelers (like me) and men chopping wood in the forests.\n\nFor my visit, Tichy Potokâs mayor, Lubica Dzuna, had arranged a lunch. One particularly devout older woman, Anna Kiktava, had only bread and water, while the rest of us enjoyed an excellent, and meatless, meal of onion soup, potato pancakes, walnut cookies and mint tea.\n\nIn fact, there is little use of meat in Ruthenian traditional cuisine. Meat is expensive and the Ruthenians, for the most part, have never been wealthy. Because of the harsh climate and short growing season, there is little access to exotic fruits and vegetables. Potatoes, noodles and dumplings are the most common fare. When meat is served, it is typically pork. Most families have a pig, which they slaughter before Christmas and consume throughout the following year.\n\nOn another Easter visit to Tichy Potok I found myself in Maria Dodova-Basistovaâs tidy kitchen learning to make peroghi. âEveryone likes peroghi,â she said.\n\nTraditionally, women made peroghi early in the morning to take to the men working the fields and forests for their midday meal. It is a time-consuming dish to prepare, so these days they are made on special occasions.\n\nAlong with the peroghi, I learned to make halusky with sauerkraut with the help of Anna Kosca. As good as it was, I was more impressed by her raka, a delicious caraway soup. It is a simple dish: a small onion sautÃ©ed in butter, flour to make a roux, caraway seeds, a dash of salt and paprika, and some water. Mrs. Kosca added some small dumplings to put in the soup. Another woman made a fragrant dill soup. And on the dreary, wet morning that we left Tichy Potok, Anna Kiktava and her sister Maria made a bean soup of kidney beans, diced carrots, kohlrabi, celeriac and potatoes.\n\nIn the early 20th century many Ruthenian immigrants came from villages in Slovakia, Poland and Ukraine to work in the coal mines of Pennsylvania. St. Mary Protector, a Byzantine Catholic church in Kingston, near Wilkes-Barre, was founded to serve these immigrants, whose descendants have stayed in the area long after the mines shut down.\n\nFour times a year St. Maryâs holds a peroghi sale, twice during the 40-day Filipovka fast before Christmas and twice during the 40-day Great Fast before Easter.\n\nFor each sale, about 30 volunteers spend two days making 4,000 potato peroghi. Church fund-raisers selling Ruthenian food are common in most parts of Pennsylvania, including my hometown of Bethlehem. (The regional popularity of peroghi is such that Pittsburgh is called the âperoghi capital of the world.â) The language and many of the traditions of the old country may fade, but its foods bind the generations together. Such is the American âmelting pot.â\n\nConversation at St. Maryâs peroghi sale inevitably turns to food. Just as in Eastern Europe, the parishioners once slaughtered their pigs around Christmas, curing the meat to last throughout the following year. For Lent, people made do with âa barrel of cabbage and a bin of potatoes,â I was told.\n\nWhile some Byzantine Catholics (as Greek Catholics are called in the United States) observe a strict lenten fast, many just abstain from meat and dairy products on alternating days. As in Tichy Potok, older people tend to be more observant. Father Theodore Krepp, pastor of St. Maryâs, acknowledged the unevenness of the fasting. âWeâre all working on perfection so thereâs no expectation that we are perfect. Part of being a Christian is to keep working on it.â\n\nThis year, I joined the parishioners for two days of peroghi making. Most of the volunteers were in their 70s. Recognizing the need to get younger parishioners involved, Father Krepp made an open plea to his congregation. Ann Derhammer and Arleen Sovak, two middle-aged sisters, were among those who volunteered their services. When Father said weâd have to stop the tradition of making peroghi unless more people helped, we decided to come,â said Ms. Derhammer.\n\nFor many years, it took several women an entire day to make the dough for the peroghi. But recently, retired baker Joe Natishan assumed responsibility for the kitchen and brought in a mechanized dough maker to speed the process. Mr. Natishan oversees a crew of four, who make the dough, mashed potatoes and cheese filling.\n\nSt. Maryâs parishioners make peroghi.\n\nNext, other volunteers stuff the filling into the dough, assembling thousands of peroghi. Then, Mr. Natishanâs crew takes over, boiling the peroghi, dipping them in butter to prevent sticking and cooling them on trays. Other volunteers pack the finished product into bags, about a dozen in each.\n\nEleanor Putprush, Margaret Sodrosky and Mary Cichy have made peroghi at St. Maryâs since the 1950âs. âWe used to bring our kids along and give them little rolling pins to roll out dough,â they said. Mrs. Cichyâs daughter, Rose, a librarian in Wilkes-Barre, was helping for her third time. âItâs nice to be doing something that has a purpose, has a tradition and is fun. You feel like youâre learning.â\n\nAt lunch on Monday, caterer Anna Lahaszow, 72, used Father Kreppâs kitchen to show me how to make machanka, a tomato gravy recipe her mother brought from eastern Slovakia. When I first heard of machanka, I had thought it was perhaps Ruthenian for lecso, tomatoes stewed with banana peppers and onions, which my Slovenian grandmother, born in Hungary, used to make. Brought from Serbia, in Hungary lecso is often mixed with eggs. A Greek Catholic Slovakian friend of mine once told me it was his favorite lenten meal.\n\nMachanka, though a more straightforward gravy, is a lot like lecso, delicious on its own or over noodles, potatoes or even peroghi. It can also be canned or frozen. Mrs. Lahaszow recalled her favorite lenten meal: salmon croquettes, machanka and fried potatoes with onions. Meanwhile, we sampled a variety of other tasty lenten foods: machanka over peroghi, vegetarian bean soup and mushroom and pea soup.\n\nConfident and brisk, Mrs. Lahaszow reminded me of Mary Poppins, albeit in a Ruthenian-American incarnation. Over lunch, she recited the recipes for the two soups in front of us and three more. I breathlessly took notes.\n\nThe volunteers grew up making peroghi at home and some still do. Like potato pancakes and haluski (cabbage and noodles, not to be confused with halusky) peroghi is eaten on many Fridays throughout the year. Children coming home for the holidays still expect the traditional dishes. Most folks in Kingston now buy their peroghi from St. Maryâs.\n\nToward the end of my visit to St. Maryâs, Mrs. Putprush, one of the peroghi makers, mentioned raka, the caraway soup I had eaten in Tichy Potok but had somehow forgotten. The mere mention of raka took me back to Slovakia.\n\nThis simple dish was made differently in Pennsylvania. Mrs. Putprush broke several eggs into her soup, letting them poach. She also added scrambled eggs to the mixture. The end product, though different, was delicious.\n\nSo absorbed with the making of this soup, I didnât notice that the peroghi making was complete. The volunteers were leaving, their work done. It was time for me to go too. And so I left, fully sated, with recipes in hand.\n\nThe Art of Pysanky\n\nText by Burnette Grega\n\nPhotos by John Maio\n\nReprinted here with Permission of CNEWA\n\nOf all the traditions brought to the United States by the eastern Slavs (Ruthenians, Slovaks and Ukrainians), one of the most impressive is the delicate art of pysanky; better known as Ukrainian Easter Eggs.\n\nPrior to the Slavsâ adoption of Christianity before the end of the first millennium, the egg signified life and was associated with magical characteristics; it was used as a talisman to appease the forces of nature. Imagine the importance of the first eggs of spring to the largely agricultural societies of Eastern Europe long before the era of the climate-controlled egg farm; egg production dropped dramatically during the long winter.\n\nAfter the Christianization of the Slavs, these pagan symbols took on Christian interpretations. Today, these pagan symbols prevail in the art and customs of the eastern Slavs.\n\nThe circle or unbroken line is special â in a less cynical age it was magical. The newly baptized Slavs believed the lines encircling the egg signified life itself. Two lines or a ribbon depicted the journey of life. Small lines crossing the ribbon indicated a ladder or the steps in oneâs journey to heaven.\n\nThe sun, which was worshipped by the pre-Christian Slavs, also figures prominently in pysanky. The sun takes many forms, which illustrate not only the sunâs role as a light for the world but also Christ as the light of the world.\n\nStylized portrayals of plants and animals are also included. Wheat symbolizes Ukraine (literally, âHinterlandâ) as the breadbasket of Europe. Pussy willows, as the earliest flowering plants of the season, are also popular. Decorated pussy willows replace palms usually reserved for Palm (Passion) Sunday; hence the use of âWillow Sundayâ in Slavic churches here and abroad for this triumphant feast.\n\nEvery color has a special meaning. Red symbolizes not only the blood of Christ, but the passions of life â happiness and hope. Green represents spring, the renewal of life and wishes of good health. Black, which signifies remembrance, dark red and purple (the royal color of faith) are reserved for the elderly. The lighter colors epitomize youth.\n\nPysanky (pysanka is the singular form) are made using the batik or reverse wax method. Fresh eggs, traditionally left whole but now blown, are dipped in dyes beginning with the lighter colors and ending with the darker pigments. The designs are drawn on each color with hot beeswax. When the process is complete, the layers of hardened wax melt away by placing the egg near a flame, revealing the eggâs jewel-like tones.\n\nThe finished pysanky are given to friends and loved ones during the Easter season with the traditional kiss and words, âChristos Voskrese!â â Christ is Risen!\n\nFrom eastern Slovakia to eastern Ukraine, from southern Poland to northern Croatia, these eastern Slavs developed a strong culture based on a deep faith in religion and family, and a love of the land. Always subjugated, and often persecuted, the eastern Slavs were driven from their homes in large numbers at the turn of the century and migrated to the land of opportunity. Drawn to the mines and factories of central and western Pennsylvania, Ohio, New Jersey and New York, they built their own churches and schools â some would say they built whole cities.\n\n(\n\nA second wave of immigrants arrived after the horrors of World War II. These new arrivals sought out their friends and relatives who preceded them and bolstered the sizable Slavic communities throughout the northeast.\n\nThose first immigrants to the United States have long since died. Their children and their childrensâ children are no longer confined to the northeast. Slavic communities exist in almost every state. While the original communities may be dying off, the walls that surrounded them, shielding the inhabitants from other traditions and people, are falling down as well. Today many Slavic communities, their origins rooted in different countries, empires and religions, have been redefined and revitalized. The making of pysanky has been invigorated by the infusion of traditions from eastern and western Ukraine, southern Poland, Slovakia and Hungary.\n\nToday, those of us that continue the tradition remember an ancient proverb that has followed us from the old country, âthe world will never end as long as a single pysanka is made.â\n\nMs. Grega and Mr. Maio are members of Our Lady of Perpetual Help Byzantine Catholic Church in Albuquerque, N.M.\n\nEaster is certainly a religious occasion but as a youngster we also had our fun times on these holy days. One tradition that I remembered is using a whip on Easter Monday. When I was six or seven years old, I went up to a neighbors home (Valucks) and someone gave me a braided whip made out of palm leaves or small pussy willow branches. Somehow my memory just can't remember what that particular whip was made from. I do remember that it was well braided and a thing of beauty. I was told it is a custom to go to the women of the house and whip her legs (ever so gently) after which I would be rewarded with Easter candy or colored Easter eggs. I do remember that some kids only used the branches off of a pussy willow tree. In those days, gifts of candy or Easter eggs were very appreciated. Lil Junis has written a small booklet on Slovakia. In it she expands on some of the customs that were observed in Western Slovakia. She wrote that in the spring, girls in costumes walk through the streets carrying a large white dummy of Morena (Goddess of Winter) on a pole, then they would throw the doll into a local stream, signifying the end of winter. She said that on Easter Monday, boys playfully whip (with thin braided branches) and also dunk girls with water.\n\nThe legend states that the branches used for whipping posses youth and beauty and that it is transferred to the girls. It is believed that the water makes them pure. Then the boys pour some perfume on the girls hair. The girls in return give chocolates, painted eggs, cake or money to the boys. Some girls have to change wet cloths a few times on this particular day but they do not mind because it's tradition. I would imagine that the more popular the girl, the more she got dunked. It was all done in fun.\n\nÂ"
