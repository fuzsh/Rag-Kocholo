Uzhhorod (Ukrainian and Russian: Ужгород; Rusyn: Уґоград, Ужгород; Slovak and Czech: Užhorod; Hungarian: Ungvár; German: Ungwar, Ungarisch Burg; Yiddish: אונגװיר , translit. Ungver or Ingver, Romanian: Ujgorod) is a city located in western Ukraine, at the border with Slovakia and near the border with Hungary. It is the administrative center of the Zakarpattia Oblast (region), as well as the administrative center of the surrounding Uzhhorodskyi Raion (district) within the oblast. The city itself is also designated as its own separate raion within the oblast.

The city gets its name from the Uzh River, which divides the city into two halves (the old and new sections). Uzh (Уж) means ringed snake (Natrix natrix), and horod (город) is Ruthenian for city, coming from Old Slavonic grad (градъ). However, this name is a recent construct, and has been used only since the beginning of the XX century. Throughout history, the city has changed names several times: it has been called Ongvar, Hungvar, Unguyvar, and Ungvar, all reflecting relation, with words showing its true origin.

The city is spelled Ужгород in both Ukrainian and Russian, transliterated "Uzhhorod" from Ukrainian, "Uzhgorod" from Russian. Consequently, until recently, the city was known in English as Uzhgorod, especially during the Soviet era.

Uzhhorod is located at 48°37′N, 22°18′E. Its population in 2004 was 111,300.
