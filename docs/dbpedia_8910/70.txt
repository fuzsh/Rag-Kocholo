Growing up is never easy, and no one is learning that faster than 12 year-old Sharon Spitz, voiced by actress Alicia Silverstone. Sharon faces the challenges of adolescence, eighth grade, and living with a mouth full of metal! Unfortunately, she finds herself dealing with mysterious mishaps caused by her braces. Despite the mayhem that follows in her wake, Sharon always walks away from trouble smiling - with a tin grin, of course!
