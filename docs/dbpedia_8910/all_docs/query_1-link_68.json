        "text": "1.\n\nBananahs 02:55\n\nBANANAHS She's gotta denim jacket on, with a 7 Seconds patch sewn on the back She likes to go to hardcore shows, she's not really into to pop punk bands On and on she exclaims, that being vegans so fucking cool And on and on she reiterates, that being edge really fucking rules (Chorus) Hannah goes bananas, but she doesn't go for me And Hannah likes eating tofu, but tofu's not my thing Hannah don't like bananas and she sure as hell don't like me Don't like me Hannah! (x3) She's gotta a cute butt she likes to strut, as she walks away If Han Solo was in my blood, she'd probably look my way Even though she don't like to drink, Minor Threat taught her to soberly think She's everything I think is lame, but she's the girl I wanna date (Chorus) Hannah! (x3) Everyone makes fun of me (ooo-ooo) Cause I like a girl that don't like me, but I don't know... (ooo-ooo) Everyone's a masochist, and Hannah is an atheist (ooo-ooo) I'd totally be an anarchist for her (a whoa oh oh) (ohhhhhhh) (Chorus) Hannah! (x8)\n\n2.\n\nI'M NOT PERFECT (BUT AT LEAST I'M O K) I've been living my life today I've been learning from my mistakes Well I know I'm not perfect but at least I'm OK\n\n3.\n\nWILL YOU EVER LOVE ME? When you're in doubt, when you're feeling sad You know I'll be there, you don't even have to ask If you were mine, I would make things right I hope my love for you will help you to decide I don't wanna waste away my life But it'd be so cool if you were mine 'Cause I'm wondering, will you ever love me I'm wondering, will you ever love me I'm wondering, will you ever love me Like I love you Tell me your problems, and tell me your fears Along the beach side, I will whisper in your ears The sand on your toes, those chocolate brown eyes You're the only one I want to satisfy Does your heart ever skip a beat When you he-ear my voice speak ? 'Cause I'm wondering will you ever love me (love me) I'm wondering will you ever love me (love me) I'm wondering, will you ever love me like I love you I'm wondering I'm wondering I'm wondering I'm wondering I'm wondering will you ever love me like I love you\n\n4.\n\nScout's Honor 02:47\n\nSCOUT'S HONOR It's probably not worth it, but still I'll try I'm just as useful as a dull pocket knife I'm living life and getting a contact high because you're tattooed on my mind and I promise you, that I'll never grow up and I promise you, that I'm stupid over you You'll beat your drums and I'll shred my 6 strings I'll shave my face, and you'll shave your legs I'm getting anxious, 'cause I know I'm going to your place I might be a black sheep, but so you know, I'll never change I know I'm rugged and not great on looks we're both stubborn, and that's how our friendship works I've got stomach flu 'cause I'm thinking of you and since you came around, my life has been less blue And I promise you, that I'll never grow up and I promise you, that I'm stupid over you You'll beat your drums and I'll shred my 6 strings I'll shave my face, and you'll shave your legs I'm getting anxious, 'cause I know I'm going to your place I might be a black sheep, but so you know, I'll never change Guys will always, have stains on their jeans Girls will always, hide their identities I refuse, to ever change these clothes As long as you, continue being so shallow\n\n5.\n\nKeera, I'm Not Gonna Shave My Face Keera I'm not, going to shave my face. Keera I'm not, so get the hell off of my case No you're not the boss of me, and I'm not your boyfriend. No I'm not your stupid fucking boyfriend. 1-2-3-4 Keera I'm not, going to shave my face. Keera I'm not, 'cause we're not going to first base No you're not the boss of me, and no ! I'm not your boyfriend. No I'm not your stupid skater boyfriend. Oh No No I'm not your stupid stoner boyfriend. Oh No No, no I'm not, your fucking boyfriend.\n\n6.\n\nWorthless 00:47\n\nWORTHLESS Nothing I do is ever good, I guess Everything I do is such a problematic mess\n\n7.\n\nAWOL Girl 02:31\n\nAWOL Girl We saw the Aquabats, and Reel Big Fish, I thought we had a good time. I guess you didn't feel the love. I'm wond'rin' where you went, and what I did And if you really hate me And who it is you're doing now You're 27 and I'm 19 I didn't mean to make a scene But girls like you don't come my way at all Emily...oh Emily...Emily..where'd you go? Emily...oh Emily...Emily...my AWOL girl, I guess you're not my girl. Saw you at school today, you waved at me, I guess that you're not mad, but What happened to our winter break? You told me that you're seein' some doctor guy 'Cause-ya couldn't cope with this dope I hope you choke on his stethoscope You're 27 and I'm 19 I didn't mean to make a scene But girls like you don't come my way at all Emily...oh Emily...Emily..where'd you go? Emily...oh Emily...Emily...my AWOL girl, I guess you're not my girl.\n\n8.\n\nBubblegum Girl 02:18\n\nBUBBLEGUM GIRL Sitting outside the mall, she's smoking a cigarette I did a double take, she disappeared from the bench Are you just a mirage, my bubblegum girl? My bubblegum girl I'm working up the courage, so I can talk with you But the idea scares me, 'cause you don't have a clue Do you think I deserve you, my bubblegum girl? My bubblegum girl (Chorus) I've been staring anxiously (ahhhhh-ba-ba) Cause I've gotta hunch you're the gal for me Wishing and hoping my dream comes true (ahhhh-ba-baaaa) And one of these days, I won't be blue I'll do whatever it takes, to catch a glimpse of you I'll map out your classes, and follow your route Do you think I'm pathetic, my bubblegum girl? My bubblegum girl (Chorus) I've been staring anxiously (ahhhhh-ba-ba) Cause I've gotta hunch you're the gal for me Wishing and hoping my dream comes true (ahhhh-ba-baaaa) And one of these days, I won't be blue I always thought you'd be the girl for me I wanted you to be the girl for me (Chorus) I've been staring anxiously (ahhhhh-ba-ba) Cause I've gotta hunch you're the gal for me Wishing and hoping my dream comes true (ahhhh-ba-baaaa) And one of these days, I won't be blue\n\n9.\n\nF-R-I-E-N-D-S 01:42\n\nF-R-I-E-N-D-S You called me on the phone today to talk about the problems You're having' with your boyfriend and I don't know how to solve 'em But I told you that I've liked you for a real long time (ohhhh) And you've been acting strange since you've been dating that fat guy (ohhh) You called me over after school to come and play some zelda And I didn't know what to do, because I can't forget ya So I asked you out again, like every other day Then you said \"hell no!\" to my face, And said \"maybe we should just be friends!\" Just be friends, just be friends 1-2-3-4 F-R-I-E-N-D-S\n\n10.\n\nSummer 01:09\n\nSUMMER It's starting, to feel a lot like A lot like summer, a la la la We'll take tons of shots, meet cute girls that smoke pot And I'm starting to get over you It's starting, to feel a lot like A lot like summer, a la la la Cute girls in bikinis, whose boyfriends are cheating And I'm gonna do right by you (Solo) Ahh-ah-ah-ah It's starting, to feel a lot like A lot like summer, a la la la I'm taking my time, I'll try to do things right But I'm not leaving here without you I'm taking my time, I'll try to do things right But I'm not leaving here without you I'm taking my time, I'll try to do things right But I'm not leaving here without you\n\n11.\n\nI Want You 02:29\n\nI WANT YOU Well, I didn't think it was possible that girls like you exist You must be from another galaxy, and your Naboo boyfriend's pissed And it doesn't make much sense that you are hangin' out with me This sci-fi girl-o-matic joy is a confusing mystery-y-y If age don't matter I must be in heaven I don't care if you're twenty seven I want you, why can't you be mi-i-ine Cause I want you My infatuation's turned into a serious disease I woke up in a cold sweat when you kissed me in my dreams And you must be a hologram, 'cause you are too good to be true I'm gonna go right back to sleep, so I can keep dreaming of you-o-o If age don't matter I must be in heaven I don't care if you're twenty seven I want you, why can't you be mi-i-ine Cause I want you\n\n12.\n\nEverything Falls Apart 02:24\n\n13.\n\nStupid Songs 03:43"
