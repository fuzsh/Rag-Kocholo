        "text": "Here's something that's been bugging me. Is Braceface a good show? I watched it a couple years ago when it was on The Family channel, and it seemed to address some serious themes (substance abuse, periods, etc.).\n\nNow that it's on Disney, though, I'm wondering if it's an entertaining show. I haven't been able to watch it for more than 5 minues because Alicia Silverstone's voice is like scratching styrofoam, but does anyone out there like Braceface? Has Disney watered it down somehow?\n\nI have this thing where if nothing's on, I'll throw Disney Channel on. So I have grown to like some of the shows they play (Braceface being one of them). So I sort of like it, though don't watch it often. It seemed like a good enough show. Had the \"right\" message, I suppose.\n\nWhoops.. sorry.. I'm tired, Silent Bob.\n\nNo one said it was indeed Jack. It was coke laced with something and it's usually Jack and coke but people do drink rum and coke.\n\nI think Alden is adorable!! He's the type of guy I wish was in high school when I was in HS. No matter who you are, he likes you for you.\n\nOf course, the added bonus for Alden: he's voiced by my Canadian crush.\n\nThat show wasn't a complete waste, but I could still do nicely without it. Sooner or later, these show creators are going to have to come up with something more original and entertaining than the \"clueless suburban-sheltered tweens\" premise.\n\nIn fact, most of the stuff in Braceface, including the stories, the voices, and background and character designs, looked like they were still in practice when everything was finalized. It's like eating half-cooked meat.\n\nI also get tired of so many t(w)een shows requiring the \"rich snooty girl\" for the villian (Lizzie McGuire, Sabrina: The Animated Series, As Told by Ginger, The Proud Family, Kim Possible). Here, Nina is a REAL pain in the rear; all she ever did was bother Sharon all the time, just because of something that happened when they were little. I don't know HOW the writers expected us to sympathize with Nina, especially when Sharon seeked much-deserved revenge against her.\n\nI WAS surprised when Nina's sidekick, Allison, decided to become one of the good guys; she didn't go crawling back to the dark side in the end as I expected. But given how much time she spent in Nina's shadow, Sharon DID have every right to question Allision becoming her friend."
