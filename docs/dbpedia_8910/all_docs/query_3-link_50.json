        "meta_description": "Braceface is an animated television series produced by Nelvana Limited and Jade Animation (Shenzhen) Company, in association with Teletoon and Fox Family Channel for the first season. The show features actress Alicia Silverstone from the movie Clueless serving as executive producer. The episodes focus on the misadventures of Sharon Spitz, a high school student who often struggles with an unusual ability occurring in her braces, which often creates mishaps in her daily life. Although considered to be a trademark feature in the series, later episodes began to drop this narrative in favor of tackling real-world issues. Unlike most animated shows which take place in fictional cities or states, etc., this one takes place in the real-life town of Elkford, British Columbia.",
