But when her name is drawn as a finalist, Sharon has to submit to a slice-of-life video profile. Afraid to be exposed as the uncoolest teen on the planet, Sharon enlists Maria's help to pull off a cool image - if only for a day.  Their plan works...until the camera crew follows her back to her Dad's place, and the fairy tale falls apart. When the crew makes fun of her goofy brothers and ex-rock and roller dad Sharon finally drops the \"cool\" act to defend them - on camera. It's Sharon's honesty and self-acceptance that ultimately wins her the prize.",
