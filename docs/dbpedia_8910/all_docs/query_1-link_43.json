        "text": "1.\n\nAll My Friends Are Growing Up (written by David De La Rosa) All of my friends are telling me I’m weird. Cause I’m not growing up or getting out of here. I’m still having awkward conversations with the girl that works next door and making shitty tips from overpaid lawyers. I hate my stupid job but what else can I do? Everyone’s so full of themselves and I don’t know what the hell I’m gonna do. (CHORUS) All my friends are growing up and getting outta here. While I keep holding myself back from facing all my fears. Every time I try to be the best that I can be, it ends up blowing all up in my face. All my friends are growing up. When everyone is getting their degrees. I’m filled with joy and filled with such envy. I’m still waking up hungover wearing yesterday’s clothes calling up my mom tryna bum a ride home. It’s no wonder I end up in this mess. I hate my stupid life, but what else can I do? Everyone’s got it figured out and I don’t know what the hell I’m gonna do. (CHORUS)\n\n2.\n\nShe’s A Dork 02:45\n\nShe’s A Dork (written by David De La Rosa) I see her walkin’ around campus in her denim jacket. Pale red vans and a ton of patches. All I want is to be with her. Reading X-men comic books under a tree. She’s an encyclopedia and writes poetry. She’s on my mind, I hope she thinks of me. Cause she’s a dork she’s just like me. Even though she’s a Marvel and I’m a DC. We can stay up late and watch some Kevin Smith movies. She’s a dork she’s just like me. When we’re making pancakes watching tv shows. Dancing to The Shang-Gris-las and The Ramones. She’s the moon of my life, always shining bright. When I’m having self doubt she’ll encourage me. She says, “ Go ahead and just do thing”. And all I want is to be good for her. Cause she’s a dork we were made to be. She’s the proton charge to all my negative energy. We could write a textbook about WNT signaling. She’s a dork she’s just like me. I’ve never felt this way before about anyone, I think I found the dork I’m looking for. Sealing me with her carbonate kisses. I’d travel light years or any distance cause, I like waking up to her in the morning. Cause she’s a dork she’s just like me Even though she’s a Marvel and I’m a DC We can stay up late and watch the Star Wars trilogy She’s a dork (x3) just like me!\n\n3.\n\nBlack Hole 01:28\n\nBlack Hole (written by David De La Rosa) I don’t wanna be like these other fucking chumps. Hate their job, hate their life, slowly turn into a grump. Suck the soul from me, sacrifice it to the stars, cause I’d rather dive into black hole. Gravity, tugs at me, keeping me from flying high. Spread my arms, take a plunge, cause I wanna feel alive. Money means shit to me if I gotta live a lie. So rip my atoms apart and let me vaporize. Friends will come, friends will go, and then everybody dies. Life’s a drag when you’ve missed the boat just one too many times. Rockets will set you free when your friends leave you behind. So blast off this rock and start a new life. I don’t wanna be like these other jaded fools. Stuck in time, sold a lie, so you follow all the rules. Suck the light from me until there’s nothing left to see. Recycle me back into all eternity. Yeah I know there’s something better out there. A better world beyond our atmosphere. We could all just fly away, and be strangers in a different place. Hitch a ride and get out of here, stop feeding this god damn machine. Tear down these hierarchies. Only then we can all be free. I don’t wanna be like these other fucking chumps. Hate their job, hate their life, slowly turn into a grump. Suck the soul from me, sacrifice to the stars. Tell your boss to fuck off and go live your god damn life.\n\n4.\n\n21 01:48\n\n21 (written by David De La Rosa) Got my life ahead of me, but my vision's blurred and I'm hazy. Been drinking all day and smoking all night, looking for any escape from life. I'm working less than minimum wage and my heart is always filled with rage. Got liquid courage in my veins and I'm pushing everyone I love away. What's my purpose passing out on the floor? Getting so drunk my friends gotta knock down the damn door. So I call you up a hundred times cause I think I can make things right. But the happy endings on TV have yet to come true for me. I'm running 'round this restaurant, tryna give these people what they want. But tuition doesn't grow on trees and 15% can buy me more whiskey. What's my purpose blacking out at the bar? Getting so drunk falling out of my best friend's car. What's my purpose sitting here on the couch? Getting so high I'm just watching my life pass me by.\n\n5.\n\nNext To Me 02:34\n\nNext to Me (written by David De La Rosa) Falling asleep with my record player on. Pretending you’re next to me singing along. Wearing your flannel to keep warm tonight. Hoping you’ll still be mine. Waking up with you in my arms and hoping I’m sane and you’re not a mirage. Counting your heartbeats til I fall asleep and wake up to the dork of my dreams. What can I say? What can I do? I’m hopelessly devoted to you. What can I say? I’m losing my mind tonight, you’re so far away. Maybe this won’t last very long, but I’m hoping you’ll stick around and see through my flaws. So please don’t run away cause I’m willing to change. If you choose that you’ll stay I’ll make everything great. If you choose, that you’ll stay… next to me.\n\n6.\n\nMe & You 03:10\n\nWritten by Mitch Nelson\n\n7.\n\nI Don’t Wanna Leave My Room (written by David De La Rosa) I’m a wreck a self destructive mess, and I don’t wanna leave my room. Cause everybody seems so phony to me and I like to live by my own rules. I go to work but I can’t make no green cause people are so stingy and rude. While you’re putting people down I’ve got life all figured out but some days my chemistry gets screwed. Looked in the mirror I don’t like who I see, so I’m not gonna leave my tomb. My friends get married and they move away, yeah, I guess I didn’t need you too. I’m getting anxious so I smoke some green, it’s making me feel like I’m loose. I’m not burning out my life I’m just tryna get by and some days I need a little fuel. Today’s a drag so lock me inside my sacred realm for the rest of time. I wanna spread my wings and fly to the moon, but it’s getting hard to smile and I don’t wanna leave my room. I don’t wanna leave my room\n\n8.\n\n69 Second Lap Time 01:09\n\nWritten by Mitch Nelson\n\n9.\n\nSloutch 02:02\n\nWritten by David De La Rosa Why ya gotta blab your mouth online just to trash everything that you don’t like? Do you ever get bored behind your keyboard Spreading negativity cause your so insecure Never looking on the sunnyside Leeching on young folks makin’ bad punchlines Caught in a daze cause you’re past your golden days Squeezin’ every last drop outta 1994 Weaseled in my head like a parasite When I'm here with you I wanna die Hearing you complain all the damn time I think I’ve lost my goddamn mind Throwing tantrums on the internet when your leather jacket rips tryna punch a woman. Crying in your beer cause your mom bought it from Sears I need an anthem for a better world instead of snotty jeers Get a life and live it machobrain Instead of spewing bigotry tryna be edgy You’re the punk rock police gatekeeping everything This blatant queerphobia has no place in our scene My brain hurts from all your toxic lies When I’m here with you I wanna die Hearing you complain all the damn time Yeah I want you out, out of my goddamn life Our foundation’s real close to rotting out And it’s way past time we tear it down Build a better scene based on positivity Stop ignoring the monopoly of all these negative creeps Why ya gotta blab your mouth online just to trash everything that you don’t like? A counterfeit reality behind your computer screen Get a life or you could just go skate and hide.\n\n10.\n\nBus Station 03:15\n\nBus Station (written by David De La Rosa) I was sitting at the bus station waiting for the 55 to take some place far away from here cause I don’t know how to drive. I’ve got no direction and I never really cared, but my future’s looking bright today with rain clouds in the air. Instead I’m sitting at the bus station waitin’ for the 56 to take me to my dead end job so I can make some crummy tips. Maybe I’ll get lucky and get cut before close or listen to a lecture ‘bout my wasted potential. (CHORUS) Cause it drains me day by day. I’m sick of the same old things. You can find me at the bus station waitin’ for the 55 watching the phonies board the metro at the end of the red line. Stared at my reflection noting every imperfection. The people I will never be cause I’m my own disease. (CHORUS) Take a look around and tell me this ain’t hell as we bury our ambitions and convince ourselves. This is growing up, this is who we’ve gotta be. You can wear a uniform but you can’t fool me I was sitting at the bus station waitin’ for the 55 thinkin’ how easy I could disappear and no one would even mind.\n\n11.\n\nCome Back To Me 02:41\n\nWritten by Mitch Nelson\n\n12.\n\nMayonnaise Jar 01:16\n\nMayonnaise Jar (written by David De La Rosa) I’m getting sick of sticking my hands down the mayonnaise jar, the mayonnaise jar at work. (X4) I’m getting sick of being treated like dick. God I hate this place hope it makes ya shit! I’m getting sick of sticking my hands down the mayonnaise jar, the mayonnaise jar at work. I’m getting sick of sticking my hands down the mayonnaise jar, god you’re such a jerk.\n\n13.\n\nGot To Lose 02:45\n\nWritten by Mitch Nelson\n\n14.\n\nDanny’s Song 02:35\n\nWritten by David De La Rosa Hangin’ out in your kitchen, playing Goldeneye After the soccer game, we can listen to Now 5 And duke it out in Red & Blue The sun is up and there’s so much to do Use to go to Shadowland, and play in your backyard Life was never dull, when our imaginations roamed Slim Shady’s on the radio But your dad turned it off and said, “No no no no” Hung all day and watched Toonami Called your name but you looked right through me I don’t know what else to do Cause I really like hanging out with you Lost touch by next September You see me ‘round but do you even remember? Bouncing around like we’re on the moon Cause I really miss hanging out with you Nostalgia eats my brain Why’s the flow of time always so cruel? I promise you that I’ll never lose All the things you taught me how to do I promise you, that I’ll never lose it Thanks for being my first friend, and all the jokes that made us red Thanks for always showing me the adventures that one's life can bring See you on the other side when the cosmic force takes me alive Thanks for being my first friend, all these memories I’ll cherish in my head\n\n15.\n\nDon’t Lose Your Dinosaur 03:15"
