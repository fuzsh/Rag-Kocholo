So Alyson finally stands up for herself and tell's Nina she's tired of being a servant for her all the time. The two decide not to be friends anymore, and Alyson now considers Sharon, Maria and Conner, as Alyson's best friends! When Sharon and Maria use Alyson's ticket for the recitale Nina is doing her solo in, they decide to ruin the show for Nina, by cutting off the straps to Nina's Dress. When Nina is in danger, Alyson trys to save her but to find out that Sharon and Maria ruined Nina's dress! Nina gets so humiliated that she starts to cry and Alyson gets angry with Sharon and Maria. In the end, Alyson forgives them and still would like to be friends.\n\nSharon and Maria find a Stray Puppy in an old ally. \"\"Lorenza\"\", they call her, she's not the cutest dog in the world, but she's Lucky. Come sunday, Sharon has to decide who to give Lorenza to. Sharon and Nina re-unite while searching for Lorenza after she gets loose. Sharon decides to give Lorenza to Nina. Since she's very lonely most times.\n\nSharon's Mother takes a vacation to Hawaii and brings along David. While Sharon, Adam and Josh are left alone with Mitzy... Well, until Mitzy leaves them Home Alone to go see a new born baby her relative had. Sharon wants to extend her curfue, and how she shows it is by being real-responcible around the house. Nina makes a statement in the School Cafeteria about Sharon being too whimpy to actually throw a party. Sharon proves it by throwing a party! At the party Sharon gets Overly-sensitive about whats going to brake in the house, or stain the Spitz' carpet. When Sharon gets caught by her mother... it looks like Sharon's not the only one forgetting her responcibilitys.\n\nSharon's and Adam's argument about their future occupations leads Sharon to play a joke on her brother that results in him apprenticing at a funeral home. He's not very good at it, but Sharon--who should be a natural at her veterinary clinic--can't handle the trauma when an animal she was tending to dies. It seems her dream of being a vet is not meant to be. But Adam, having acquired some new skills at the funeral home, comforts, counsels and consoles his grief-stricken sisterâ€”which makes Sharon realize that one day she still may become a vet. Meanwhile Josh tries to subvert expectations by examining other possible career paths instead of the one everyone thinks he'll follow; music.\n\nIt's March Break. Helen's best friend from high school returns to Elkford with her daughter, Genesis. The young lady is Sharon's age, but Sharon isn't at all enamoured at the prospect of having to spend all her time â€˜babysitting' a stranger. But Genesis turns out to be a charming, magnetic, charismatic personality and in short order all of Sharon's friends--including Dion, are drawn to the fascinating newcomer. Before long Sharon feels taken for granted and like an outsider in her own inner circle--until she learns her friends really do care about her, and that the grass is indeed always greener on the other side.\n\nSharon mistakenly assumes Nina got a nose job during March break and her innocent gossip snowballs out of control, ruining a public relations opportunity for Nina. But when it's revealed that the nose job was just an incorrect assumption on Sharon's part, Nina manages to milk the ensuing press coverage to her advantage. Meanwhile Maria tries--but isn't ableâ€”to tell Connor that bad breath might be an impediment to his blossoming romance with Alyson.\n\nEach student in Sharon's social studies class is given a high-tech baby-doll as part of a project on â€˜parenting'. Sharon thinks that when she grows up she'll be a great mom who will also be able to do anything and everything she wants; in other words, she'll \"\"have it all\"\". For the first while, she does well. But things start to get a little strained as she tries to balance â€˜parenting' with her other responsibilitiesâ€”like looking after her pets, working at the vet's and trying to have a social life. When she becomes hyper-vigilant about the â€˜baby' Sharon doesn't notice a toddler feed Pigger chocolate in the park and soon she's at the vet'sâ€”on the â€˜other side of the counter' with a very sick pooch. As she stays up all night to watch her beloved pet, she realizes that looking after something you love is not a game and that you'd better be an adult before you have a child.\n\nSharon, Maria and Brock are part of a cultural immersion trip to Italy. As luck would have it, Rome is the home of Maria's maternal grandparents. Once there, the girlfriends clash. Maria embraces her heritage and roots and starts to behave in an old-fashioned, moralistic way while Sharon just wants to have fun--preferably with some cute young Italian guy. And she does--with Marcello, her Italian fantasy come true! At the same time Brock gets into the people and history of the place, thereby showing another side to Maria and bringing them closer. Things come to a head when he and Maria stay out too late and ignite her grandparents' wrath. When they blame Sharon as a â€˜bad influence', Maria comes to her friend's defence.\n\nIn an effort to prove she's not such a \"\"girly-girl\"\" Sharon decides to form an all girl rock group for a battle of the bands contest sponsored by a â€˜girls' magazine. Dion, thrilled at the opportunity to design their outfits, jumps on board, but when Mangled Metal hears about the gender limitations they are outraged. As a result, they decide to disguise themselves as females so they can enter the contest as well--and win the expensive music equipment. So as the girls take a walk on the masculine side (I'm not sure that joining a rock group is necessarily a masculine thing to do), the guys dress like Britney Spears wannabes and call themselves the Mangled Petals. Hilarity ensues when everything comes out in the open at the concert â€“ literally.\n\nBrock and Maria start to play pranks on each other. The practical jokes catch on and soon everyone joins in on the â€˜fun'. Feeling left out, Sharon becomes desperate to be part of the crowd. Then she has an idea to play a practical joke on Connor--using a secret he confided to her years ago--he's afraid of scary bugs! Sharon scares him with a rubber cockroach and it goes over big with everyone. That is, everyone except Alyson and Connor who is furious and feels betrayed. Sharon tries to â€˜jolly' him out of his mood--she was sure he'd gotten over it--but Connor doesn't forgive her. And later Sharon gets upset when she discovers that Connor has divulged one of Sharon's minor secrets to Alyson. Now both injured parties start to feel as if they've outgrown each other and decide their friendship is officially over. In the end they both realize that their relationship doesn't have to disappear--it just has to change.\n\nSharon, the only one in her crowd who's not half of a couple, overcompensates by raving about her romantic Italian boyfriend, Marcello. So when he announces he's coming to visit, she's over the moon. And when he arrives, everything is great! But not for long; his â€˜European-ness' doesn't translate well to North America. Instead of being romantic and poetic, he just seems dorky and cornball. In an effort to recapture what they had, Sharon tries to make Marcello over into a more North Americanized version. When that doesn't work, she tries to avoid being alone with him. But Marcello doesn't take the hint. Then she tries to turn him off by making herself unattractive. When her scheme fails, Sharon is forced to hire â€˜Dirty Work', a project that Adam and his pals started for their Economics Class. Their service is to do the deeds someone can't do on their own. But when the â€˜Dirty Work' messenger accidentally gives Connor the message, he thinks Alyson is trying to break up with him. Now Sharo\n\nFeeling bored with her life, Sharon is looking for a major change in routine. When her dad announces that he's moving in with his girlfriend Lauren, Sharon doesn't react as negatively as her brothers. In fact, Sharon is excited by the hip downtown loft and lifestyle. When she discovers that Lauren's fifteen-year-old son has been kicked out of boarding school and is moving in with her as well, Sharon thinks her days of boredom are over. Drawn to Griffin's edginess and the rebellion he represents, Sharon decides she wants to move in with her dad and Lauren as well. She soon discovers that the grass isn't always greener on the flip side of the divorce coin. Not only is Sharon uncomfortable with her new lifestyle, Griffin doesn't prove to be such a cool new friend either."
