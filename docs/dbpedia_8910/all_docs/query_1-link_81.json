        "text": "“Braceface” had its share of memorable and relatable quotes that captured the essence of teenage life. Here are some notable quotes from the show:\n\n“Getting braces is like being a prisoner of your own teeth!”\n\n“Note to self: Must learn art of non-embarrassing existence.”\n\n“Teenagers have it rough, always worrying about what other people think. It’s like they’re trapped in a never-ending popularity contest.”\n\n“I’m not a fashion victim. I’m just a fashion hostage.”\n\n“Girls are like spaghetti. No one can fully understand how they work.”\n\n“Life is like a cafeteria. It’s messy, and you end up with stuff you never wanted.”\n\n“Honey, there’s a difference between being popular and being loved.”\n\n“You have to face your fears if you want to change.”\n\n“Being cool is overrated. It’s more important to be yourself.”\n\n“It’s like my mom always says, ‘What’s the point of growing up if you can’t be a little childish sometimes?'”"
