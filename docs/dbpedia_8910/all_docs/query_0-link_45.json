        "text": "People say that there’s no way a character can be openly homosexual in a cartoon because no one/the people in charge wouldn’t approve. Because if so, then what did Braceface do that was different?\n\nSeason 2’s first episode, aired in 2002, introduced Dion (real name Mike Jones) as a mentorish friend figure for the female protagonist, Sharon. He’s adamant that others accept and respect him as he is and has a limited patience-policy for those who don’t, even in dealing with friends. His intelligence, advanced life experience, and clear ambitious goals in life give him a step up above most others of his age group in the series, let alone Sharon who is several years younger.\n\nDion’s sexuality is, as far as I recall, never voiced in the cartoon, though it leaves little to be guessed in season 3’s episode “Game, Set Up and Match” when Sharon tries to play matchmaker between him and one-time character Houston.\n\nThe episode went with Dion and Houston getting along well but having no interest in each other because neither were looking to be in a relationship. When they figured out Sharon’s less-than-subtle scheme, Dion was furious she was projecting her own desire for a relationship onto him, but Houston made a point that she at least meant well. The two organized a little prank designed to make Sharon understand why unasked for matchmaking is inadvisable, and by the end of the day everyone was friends and they all went to play a game of tennis. Jeeey!\n\nSo if this show can include a homosexual character, not being shy about it but also not hanging the character up on it, then why can’t others? It aired in many countries, though I admit data to check if always all three seasons were aired is something I haven’t been able to get my hands on. It would be a shame if season 3 would not have been aired as much, moreso if because of “Game, Set Up and Match”, though it would explain why I never saw a note of controversy on the matter."
