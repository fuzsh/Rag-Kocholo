        "text": "If anything the King had succeeded, besides regaining the independence from France, it is him wielding damage control and made the public adamant of seeing him as a different person. Lon Nol was on his way assisted by the parliament representing the new Cambodia, in a Machiavellian fashion, the new Prince. And his departure on a chopper from Phnom Penh at its lowest point, when Phnom Penh was gasping for air, was said to be a cowardly act of treachery, but the King’s excursion to China way earlier when the country was in deep shits to have been as a justifiable neglect; Khmer leaders love evading responsibilities. Pol Pot occupied the country, seduced the public through the means of reviving…\n\nThe late erstwhile Cambodian king's movie is a work of somebody who loves to tell history through cinema. This is a pretty straightforward story about the fall of the republicans at Phnom Phen at the hand's of the communists. The portrayal is without frills and stock reel footage meets dramatic footage to tell the story of the attack on Phnom Phen in 1975. I was very very engaged with the movie, and it was an excellent lesson in history, besides being a good, honest short film. There is an unusual neutrality in the storytelling (which, if intentional is genius {it could be the director's own outlook too}) that makes the movie a much better watch than what its shoddy technique suggests."
