Lon Nol was on his way assisted by the parliament representing the new Cambodia, in a Machiavellian fashion, the new Prince. And his departure on a chopper from Phnom Penh at its lowest point, when Phnom Penh was gasping for air, was said to be a cowardly act of treachery, but the King’s excursion to China way earlier when the country was in deep shits to have been as a justifiable neglect; Khmer leaders love evading responsibilities. Pol Pot occupied the country, seduced the public through the means of reviving a monarchy state after a 5-year period of corruption, and the American political influence, with a grim hidden agenda. In this very short piece of fictionalization, it’s beyond clear as to the King’s ambivalent outlooks on the two groups painted as anti-royalists without hinting any of his involvements. As it reaches the end, one group succumbed to an inevitable concession and the other was undoubtedly wheeling into triumph largely supported by foreign shadow governments and ruthless puppet masters as talking heads, by which of no mentions as to who had been the source of it all along."
