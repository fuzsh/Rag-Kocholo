        "text": "Know somebody who might have dyslexia? Find out if they’re fans of Minecraft. If so, pass them this map.\n\nBased on the idea that lots of people live with dyslexia without knowing it—and perhaps may fear finding out—French healthcare charity Puissance Dys enlisted BETC to find a fun way of screening them. The result was a custom map in Mindcraft built by members whose challenges not only screen for dyslexia, but teach people how to use their imaginations and strategic thinking skills in new ways.\n\nPuissance Dys was founded in 1992 by neuropsychologist Béatrice Sauvageot, who wanted to find innovative ways to address dyslexia. The charity’s primary focus is on children and young people having issues at school and in social settings, which made Minecraft ideal turf. The game is “notoriously very appealing” for people with dyslexia, BETC says. Markus “Notch” Persson, the game’s creator, has it, too.\n\nLike Puissance Dys, the goal of the Mindcraft map isn’t just to test people for dyslexia; it’s to reveal dyslexia to them as a superpower. In a literacy-driven world, dyslexic people must develop unique approaches to solving problems, thinking critically, collaborating and communicating—all of which is exploited by this custom gaming experience. “Lucky them!” the agency exclaims.\n\nIn addition to being favored by dyslexic users, Minecraft itself has long been used by educators and teachers to address various learning challenges. A special Education Edition, released specifically for classroom use, came out just last month, and includes pre-built lessons.\n\nAll that aside, Minecraft is just nuts. From this super-accessible lo-fi game of blocks and building, people have joined forces to cobble together veritable empires. But it’s not just worlds that get made; Minecraft has inspired new ways of interacting and sharing information. John St. threw a party in Minecraft. Reporters Without Borders, with help from MediaMonks, used it to house a library for countries whose journalists have been censored. Ruth B threw a concert there, organized by young girls interested in STEM and game design.\n\nIf there’s an accessible metaverse out there, one that doesn’t feel like a virtual LinkedIn monitored by our bosses, it’s probably Minecraft.\n\nCREDITS\n\nCampaign: Mindcraft\n\nBrand: Puissance Dys\n\nBrand Manager: Beatrice Sauvageot\n\nAd Agency: BETC\n\nAgency Managers: Catherine Emprin, Delphine Lebleme, Esther Chevrinais\n\nChief Creative Officer: Stephane Xiberras\n\nExecutive Creative Director: Alasdhair Macgregor\n\nCreative Director: Mathieu Nevians\n\nCopywriters: David Campese, Tiampa Bamrounsavath\n\nArt Director: Julien Lefevre\n\nMap Developer: Axel Bierne\n\nAssistant Supervisor: Yoni Riviere\n\nGraphic Designer: Maxime Delattre\n\nTrailer Maker: DIDJEMATHO, I.S.M.\n\nWeb Developer: JULIENS45\n\nMap Builders: Mobiduck, TheGeek, Bidulia, Pinieapple, CachalotDodu, H&Z"
