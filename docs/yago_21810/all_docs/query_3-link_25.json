        "text": "Hello LinkedIn community, As a final year student at Grand Canyon University, pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Information Technology, and also a newly transitioned US Army veteran, I am eager to seek a career in the field of cybersecurity. Through my studies, I have gained a strong foundation in the below topics: 1. Network Security 2. Operating System Security (Windows, Linux, etc.) 3. Firewall Configuration and Management 4. Encryption and Decryption techniques 5. Access Control and Authentication 6. Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing 7. Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) 8. Secure Network Protocols (HTTPS, SSH, etc.) 9. Secure Coding Practices 10. Database Security and more‚Ä¶. I am now focused on enhancing my career prospects in cybersecurity. I would like to seek guidance from experienced professionals in the field on the most valuable cybersecurity certifications that would complement my degree when applying for jobs. #GCU #IT #Cybersecurity #Certifications #CareerDevelopment #JobMarket #Skills #DegreeProgram #VeteranTransition #USArmy\n\n2\n\nRecruiter: Sir, are you available in the job market? Me: Yes. Recruiter: Are you okay with the job requirements? Me: Yes. Can we discuss? Recruiter: Are you okay with relocating to Nebraska? Me: No. Recruiter: Okay thank you! ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Alright folks, let's talk about the #cybersecurity job market's latest comedy sketch: the expectation for seasoned pros to relocate to Whatchamacallit NE, complete with weak compensation packages and a side of moving costs we're apparently supposed to magically conjure up! Seriously, are they auditioning for a reality show or what? ü§î I mean, many of us have perfected the art of remote work since before it was cool, and disrupting that delicate work-life balance just isn't on the agenda. And can we address the recruiters? Bless their hearts, but copy-pasting job descriptions has become the new national sport. Entry-level with 3-5 years' experience? Somebody's been hitting the funny juice a bit too hard. And don't even get me started on those 'senior' positions offering hourly rates that barely cover coffee runs. So here's the deal: either adjust the script or get ready for the cybersecurity workforce to roll credits and go on strike! üòÖ #cybersecurityjobmarketbloopers #cybersecurity #careers #jobsearchchronicles\n\n23\n\n6 Comments\n\nHello, Veterans in IT! üåü Transitioning from the military to a civilian IT role can be challenging, but your unique skills and experiences make you a valuable asset to any company. Here‚Äôs how to effectively market your military background for an entry-level IT position: 1. Highlight Transferable Skills Your military experience has equipped you with numerous transferable skills. Emphasize your: ‚Ä¢ Leadership: Demonstrate how you‚Äôve led teams and projects, showcasing your ability to manage and motivate. ‚Ä¢ Problem-Solving: Provide examples of how you‚Äôve addressed complex problems and implemented effective solutions. ‚Ä¢ Discipline and Reliability: Highlight your strong work ethic, punctuality, and dependability. 2. Technical Skills and Training If you‚Äôve received any technical training or certifications in the military, make sure to list them. Certifications such as CompTIA Security+, Network+, and others are highly valued in the IT industry. 3. Use Civilian Terminology Translate military jargon into civilian terms. For instance: ‚Ä¢ Squad Leader ‚û°Ô∏è Team Leader or Supervisor ‚Ä¢ Mission Planning ‚û°Ô∏è Project Management ‚Ä¢ Military Intelligence ‚û°Ô∏è Data Analysis 4. Emphasize Soft Skills The soft skills you‚Äôve developed are just as important. Highlight your: ‚Ä¢ Teamwork: Your experience working in cohesive units is crucial for collaborative IT environments. ‚Ä¢ Adaptability: Show how you can quickly adapt to new technologies and processes. ‚Ä¢ Communication: Emphasize your ability to clearly convey information and instructions. 5. Quantify Your Achievements Whenever possible, use numbers to demonstrate your impact. For example: ‚Ä¢ ‚ÄúLed a team of 15 personnel, resulting in a 30% increase in operational efficiency.‚Äù ‚Ä¢ ‚ÄúManaged IT equipment for 200+ users, ensuring 99% uptime.‚Äù 6. Leverage Veteran Resources Take advantage of veteran-specific job resources and networks. Websites like Hire Heroes USA, Military.com, and VA for Vets offer tools and support for veterans entering the workforce. 7. Network and Seek Mentorship By effectively translating your military skills and experiences into civilian terms, you can confidently showcase your value to potential employers in the IT industry. Remember, your unique background is a strength‚Äîuse it to your advantage! #VeteransInIT #CareerTransition #ITJobs #MilitaryToCivilian #EntryLevelIT\n\n3\n\nDo you have a Security Clearance? Check out this helpful information regarding maintaining your security clearance from QSL's FSO, Caleb Kelley. ....... The rules for maintaining a security clearance vary by agency and clearance level. In general, however, DOS guidelines provide a framework for security maintenance. People must undergo reinvestigation every five years to maintain top secret security clearance. In a reinvestigation, the worker submits an updated security package, and the agency conducts a new background check. The reinvestigation reviews the candidate's life since the last background check. The investigator may ask candidates to address any new concerns. Agencies must also provide continuous evaluation for people covered by security clearance. Each agency decides for itself how to conduct that evaluation. Once a covered individual no longer needs security clearance ‚Äî such as when they transfer from public to private sector work ‚Äî the agency ends their clearance.

Next is part two (Core 2 220-1102) in a few days. The best part is I passed with no studying, go figure. To a lot of people this may be no big deal but for me I should have died 8 years ago when my first heart failed. I didn‚Äôt think I would ever leave the hospital but perceptions and aspiration change along with our struggles as they evolve over time. I am happy to say things are looking up for me, I am a realist, so I have to be pesomistic, but I like to also have hope that I won‚Äôt always have the worst case scenario happen lol. Anything better than the worst case is good to me. This is my first cert I have received that is universally accepted and something I should have gone after years ago. I did see my weak points though and should brush up on the different cloud based storage and backup solutions as well as other areas I struggled with because I came down to seconds when finishing the test. Way more certs to come in the near future. Pulling out loans to get them paid for but I am making moves again and if you are reading this always remember, if you never try, you‚Äôll never know.\n\n1\n\nOkay... so.... I am studying for the CYSA+ from CompTIA as part of my Bachelors program. Being in the industry for 4 years and working in an area that exposes you to damn near everything makes me have a high level of confidence going into this test. Could still fail, I totally understand that. Not being arrogant or anything, just confident in my abilities.... anyways.... Just read a practice question that pertained to patching mission critical systems and let me tell you... I do NOT agree with their answer! (it was a choose three question) Apparently the team that manages the mission critical system should NOT be the ones that review the vendor-supplied newsletters and security patch bulletins AND you do not NEED a routine schedule for the rollout of noncritical patches. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Seriously.... so the people that manage said CRITICAL system shouldn't be the ones reviewing some of the most important supplied information from the vendor? We are just going to play the telephone game and hope it all works out? And holy s**t.... you don't NEED routine patching cadences? Are you joking? Is this critical system grandma's DSL modem? We are just gonna wait for Timmy to be eating dinner at 6pm on Saturday and have a light bulb moment that he forgot about the patch that came out 3 months ago... Or more likely the IT guy is over tasked and understaffed and because there is no routine maintenance window it just never happens.... üôÉ Rant over. Feel free to throw some constructive arguments my way on why maybe I'm wrong.\n\n8\n\n13 Comments\n\nTransitioning from military service to a civilian IT career can be challenging, but taking an entry-level position is a strategic move that can significantly benefit your long-term career and earning potential.
