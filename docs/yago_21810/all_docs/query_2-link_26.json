        "text": "THE LAST WORD WITH LAWRENCE O`DONNELL\n\nOctober 19, 2012\n\nGuests: Adam B. Ellick, Tammy Duckworth\n\nLAWRENCE O`DONNELL, HOST: Tonight, Dr. Obama says Mitt Romney has a\n\nbad case of Romnesia, and Dr. Biden says Romnesia is contagious.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Just 18 days until the election.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Eighteen days to go.\n\nCHRIS JANSING, NBC NEWS: I know you`re counting down.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Just 18 days.\n\nJANSING: Three days until the third and final presidential debate.\n\nCHUCK TODD, NBC NEWS: Monday foreign policy debate.\n\nBARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Backtracking and side\n\nstepping.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Every time Romney opened his mouth on foreign\n\npolicy, he does make a misstep.\n\nMITT ROMNEY (R), PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: So much to redistribute.\n\nDAVID GREGORY, NBC NEWS: We`re not in a position to start to call who\n\nhas the most definite edge here.\n\nO`DONNELL: We may not have a call on election night.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Maybe many days after the polls close.\n\nANN ROMNEY, MITT ROMNEY`S WIFE: Women are going to have a choice.\n\nMITT ROMNEY: Remove funding for Planned Parenthood.\n\nANN ROMNEY: If you really want to make a choice, those choices are\n\nabout reproductive rights, that`s your choice.\n\nOBAMA: You don`t want someone who needs to ask for binders of women.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Women are not binders.\n\nOBAMA: You don`t want to back down (ph).\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I just got shelved like a binder.\n\nOBAMA: He`s forgetting what his own positions are.\n\nMITT ROMNEY: I care about 100 percent of the American people.\n\nOBAMA: I think it`s called Romnesia.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Romnesia.\n\nOBAMA: If you say you`ll protect a woman`s right to choose.\n\nMITT ROMNEY: I will preserve and protect a woman`s right to choose.\n\nOBAMA: He`ll be delighted to sign a law outlawing that right.\n\nMITT ROMNEY: I`ll be delighted to sign that bill.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: He`ll be delighted.\n\nOBAMA: Man, you definitely got Romnesia.\n\nMARTIN BASHIR, MSNBC HOST: Romnesia.\n\nOBAMA: He`s going to give a tax cut to the top 1 percent.\n\nMITT ROMNEY: We ought to bring the tax rates down.\n\nOBAMA: I don`t know anything about giving tax cuts to rich folks.\n\nMITT ROMNEY: I don`t have a $5 trillion tax cut.\n\nOBAMA: You probably got Romnesia.\n\nHere`s the good news -- Obamacare covers preexisting conditions!\n\n(END VIDEOTAPE)\n\nO`DONNELL: With just 18 days until the election, President Obama got\n\nsome important endorsements today and Mitt Romney got an ailment that Dr.\n\nObama diagnosed as Romnesia.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nOBAMA: H`s forgetting what his own positions are. And he`s betting\n\nthat you will too. I mean, he`s changing up so much and backtracking and\n\nsidestepping.\n\nWe`ve got -- we`ve got to name this condition that he`s going through.\n\nI think, I think it`s called Romnesia.\n\nIf you say you`ll protect a woman`s right to choose but you stand up\n\nin a primary debate and said that you`d be delighted to sign a law\n\noutlawing that right to choose in all cases -- man, you definitely got\n\nRomnesia.\n\nAnd if you come down with a case of Romnesia, and you can`t seem to\n\nremember the policies that are still on your Web site, or the promises that\n\nyou`ve made over the six years you`ve been running for president, here`s\n\nthe good news -- Obamacare covers preexisting conditions.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nO`DONNELL: After Dr. Obama listed the symptoms of Romnesia in\n\nVirginia today, Dr. Biden warned a Florida audience about just how\n\ncontagious Romnesia can be.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nJOSEPH BIDEN, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Because it`s\n\nRomnesia. Boy, I`ll tell you what. I hope you all don`t get Romnesia.\n\nIt`s contagious, because all of a sudden, Paul Ryan, the budget hawk,\n\nthe guy who introduced a whole budget plan that actually already passed, it\n\nalready passed the House of Representatives, all of a sudden he doesn`t\n\nremember it. He doesn`t remember it.\n\nRyan is saying his budget doesn`t decimate Medicare and Medicaid and\n\neviscerate education. It`s a little like Mitt Romney standing in an\n\nunemployment line in Florida and turning to the guy and saying, look, I\n\ndidn`t outsource your job, I offshored it.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nO`DONNELL: The vice president was welcomed to Florida today by this\n\neditorial from Florida`s largest newspaper, \"The Tampa Bay Times,\" \"Obama\n\nhas been tested by harsh circumstance and proven himself worthy for a\n\nsecond term for president of the United States. `The Tampa Bay Times`\n\nrecommends Barack Obama.\"\n\n\"The Denver Post\" editorial board writes today, \"Mitt Romney`s\n\ncomments on the 47 percent of Americans who refuse to take personal\n\nresponsibility and care for their lives were a telling insight into his\n\nviews and a low point of the campaign. Obama, on the other hand, has shown\n\nthroughout his term that he is a steady leader who keeps the interests of a\n\nbroad array of Americans in mind. We urge Coloradans to re-elect him to a\n\nsecond term.\"\n\nAnd in Utah today, a \"Salt Lake Tribune\" editorial says, \"Through a\n\npair of presidential debates, Romney`s domestic agenda remains bereft of\n\ndetail and worthy of mistrust. Therefore, our endorsement must go to the\n\nincumbent, a competent leader who, against tough odds has guided the\n\ncountry through catastrophe set a course that while rocky, is pointing\n\ntoward a brighter day.\"\n\nNate Silver of \"The New York Times\" \"FiveThirtyEight\" blog forecasts\n\nthat on November 6th, President Obama has a 66.9 chance of winning\n\nreelection, and President Obama will win 287 Electoral College votes, and\n\nMitt Romney will within 251.\n\nKrystal Ball, the newspaper editorials are fascinating to me. The\n\nRepublicans take their convention to Tampa, the local endorsement endorses\n\nPresident Obama`s reelection. Mitt Romney goes into Denver, and according\n\nto \"The Denver Post,\" on big page one headline won the debate.\n\nKRYSTAL BALL, THE CYCLE: Right.\n\nO`DONNELL: That very same newspaper comes out and says President\n\nObama should be re-elected.\n\nAnd then you go to Utah. You would presume a stronghold area for Mitt\n\nRomney. Surely he`s going to carry the state. But there, big local paper\n\nin Salt Lake says, no, President Obama has earned re-election.\n\nWhat do newspaper endorsements mean in a 21st century campaign?\n\nBALL: You know, it would be easy to dismiss them to say they don`t\n\namount a whole lot, there`s so much media out there, people are making\n\ndecisions in different ways. But I actually think for a lot of undecided\n\nvoters, who you might call low information voters, their local paper is\n\nstill a go-to source for what`s going on. It`s a trusted source, it`s\n\nreporters they know, it`s editors that they know.\n\nSo it can mean something in a swing state to those voters who are kind\n\nof on the fence. I think it can make a difference.\n\nO`DONNELL: Ari Melber, 18 days to go and the president is now I think\n\nbeginning to make his closing arguments out there in the stump.\n\nLet`s listen to what he was saying today in Virginia, that is\n\nsomething of a summation of his case.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nOBAMA: In 18 days, you can let them turn the clock back 50 years for\n\nimmigrants and gays and women or we can stand up and say we are a country\n\nin which everybody has a place. A country where no matter where you are,\n\nno matter what you look like, no matter where you come from, black, white,\n\nHispanic, Asian, Native American, young, old, gay, straight, abled,\n\ndisabled, we have a place for everybody. Everybody has got chance to make\n\nit if you try.\n\nI want to finish the job. And if you`re willing to stand with me and\n\nmake some phone calls with me, and knock some doors with me, get your\n\nfriends to vote for me, we will win Fairfax County again. We`ll win\n\nVirginia again. We`ll finish what we started.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nO`DONNELL: Ari, that`s the man we first saw on a national stage in\n\nBoston during John Kerry`s convention and the man who ran for president\n\nlast time.\n\nARI MELBER, THE NATION: Yes, and it`s a strong closing argument.\n\nIt`s justice and jobs. And there are areas we`ve seen where they`ve linked\n\nthose really strongly like on pay equity for women. There are areas where\n\nyou have to think about it a little more. I think the president has been\n\nexplaining and really embracing Obamacare as something that can be very\n\ngood for jobs, very good for your pocketbook.\n\nAnd then the negative side of it is, you know, one of those editorials\n\nwas called too many Mitts and this idea of Romnesia that you can`t figure\n\nout where Romney stands because he can`t figure out where he stands and Joe\n\nBiden says it`s contagious.\n\nYou know, the next question is it an FTD? Is it a FOX-transmitted\n\ndisease?\n\nBALL: You went (INAUDIBLE).\n\nMELBER: Because if it is.\n\nO`DONNELL: I think it may be.\n\nMELBER: Because if it is, because FOX was attacking Romney back when\n\nhe was for regulated assault weapons, now they`re supporting his claim that\n\nhe`s actually against that. They were attacking him when he was pro-\n\nchoice, and now they`re supporting him saying he`s pro-life.\n\nBut you know what? In Ohio and around the country, people are just\n\nrelying on FOX News, which has a couple of million. They are, as Krystal\n\nsaid, reading their local paper, hearing this message. And when your local\n\npaper says there`s too many Mitts and Joe Biden says he can`t remember\n\nwhere he is, and the president says it, and then you watch a debate where\n\nMitt Romney is running from his positions on abortion and can`t figure out\n\nin real time what his position is on Libya, I think all that adds up to a\n\npretty strong closing argument.\n\nO`DONNELL: Let`s take a look at a new Obama ad that`s running in Ohio\n\nnow.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: They came up and they said you`re laid off,\n\neverybody, as of right now.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: What was I going to do for my children? Are\n\nthey going to have a home?\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Without President Obama`s rescue of the auto\n\nindustry, Ohio would have collapsed. Mitt Romney would have just let us go\n\nunder. Just let us go bankrupt.\n\nROMNEY: That`s exactly what I said, by the headline your read, which\n\nis that, let Detroit go bankrupt.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: And for him to just say let them fail.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: How you can say something like that is just beyond\n\nme.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nO`DONNELL: Krystal, that looks like something that will work in Ohio.\n\nBALL: That`s pretty devastating. I mean, Ohio has been an outlier\n\nfor the president in terms of how well he`s performing there versus the\n\nnational average and even versus other battleground states. And this is\n\nthe essence of the reason why, on the most important economic decision\n\nfacing Ohioans, Mitt Romney got it dead wrong in a very obvious way that\n\neveryone can understand.\n\nSo I think, underscoring that as much as possible between now and\n\nElection Day is critical and it`s devastating.\n\nO`DONNELL: And, Ari, on the Romnesia thing, doesn`t it also sound\n\nlike, it`s not just forgetful and all of that, there`s a kind of out-of-\n\ntouch element to it. It seems to be something that encapsulates a lot\n\nabout Romney.\n\nMELBER: Yes, I think that`s exactly right, Lawrence, and it`s what\n\nBill Clinton said. They think you`re stupid.\n\nO`DONNELL: Yes.\n\nMELBER: They think they can run through six different positions and\n\nthen say, no, I`m not the one. You`re the one that wanted to go bankrupt\n\nand that`s going to work. And I think in this environment, it doesn`t work\n\nbecause people care about what`s happening to this country.\n\nBALL: Can I say how satisfying that Democrats come up with such a\n\ngreat word? It seems like the Republicans are always the ones that come\n\nwith Medi-scare and Obamacare and all this language. Finally, we have such\n\na beautiful crystallization of exactly who Mitt Romney is and what the\n\nproblem is.\n\nO`DONNELL: I think we`ll all remember where we were this morning when\n\nwe first saw it on Twitter.\n\nBALL: Say the hashtag.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nO`DONNELL: Oh, yes. Who wrote that? I mean, someone in the campaign\n\nis getting a little prize for writing that.\n\nBALL: Absolutely.\n\nO`DONNELL: And so, going into next week`s debate, I think one of the\n\nchallenges we`re going to talk about on the next segment, but foreign\n\npolicy is not probably where this debate, this campaign is going to be won.\n\nThey`re going to have to find some ways to trick that debate into domestic\n\nissues, aren`t they?\n\nBALL: Well, there are a lot of ways that you can do it. Things like\n\nclimate change and energy certainly have international and domestic\n\nimplications. But I do have to think, you know, in terms of the impact of\n\nthese debates, there`s a little bit of drama gone because we`ve had both\n\nMitt Romney and the president have strong performances. It`s 90 minutes of\n\nforeign policy.\n\nAnd, frankly, if you look at the town hall format and what questions\n\nvoters wanted to ask, what was on their mind, there was only one foreign\n\npolicy question. So, as you said, I think both candidates actually, to the\n\nextent that they can kind of cheat back to domestic policy will probably do\n\nso.\n\nO`DONNELL: Krystal Ball and Ari Melber, thank you both for joining me\n\ntonight.\n\nMELBER: Thank you.\n\nBALL: Thanks, Lawrence.\n\nO`DONNELL: Coming up, the most important news in the world. Malala\n\nYousufzai is back on her feet. She is standing with help now and is\n\nwriting again after being shot in the head by Pakistan-Taliban.\n\nIn a LAST WORD exclusive, \"The New York Times\" reporter who knows her\n\nwell and made a documentary about her will join me.\n\nThe woman who is trying to save the world from bat crap crazy\n\nCongressman Joe Walsh, Democratic congressional candidate and war veteran\n\nTammy Duckworth joins me, also for THE LAST WORD exclusive.\n\nAnd in the rewrite tonight: Lingerie, the kind of lingerie that Mitt\n\nRomney hates the most. Chinese lingerie and why getting tough China is\n\ntougher than Mitt Romney thinks.\n\nAnd we will give Mitt Romney another little lesson from \"The West\n\nWing.\"\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nO`DONNELL: You know Mitt Romney is going to talk tough about China in\n\nMonday night`s debate. That`s in the rewrite tonight.\n\nAnd Karen Finney and Richard Wolffe will join me next with what else\n\nwe can expect Monday night. And in THE LAST WORD exclusive, congressional\n\ncandidate Tammy Duckworth joins me when her opponent crazy Republican\n\nCongressman Joe Walsh continues to evolve his opinion on abortion to save\n\nthe life of the mother. He was opposed to it yesterday and not quite so\n\nopposed to it today.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nJON STEWART, THE DAILY SHOW: I do want to ask you this. I`m putting\n\ntogether a scrapbook of the whole 2012 campaign. And I don`t -- I have\n\nthese great pictures from the two debates, but I don`t know which debate\n\nthey`re from. So if you could -- I have two pictures. There`s one\n\npicture, I don`t know if you can get that. And then there`s the other\n\npicture and I`m wondering, could you tell me which -- I don`t know if I\n\nhave the debates, do you know which debate was which?\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nOBAMA: Cute.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nO`DONNELL: As the final presidential debate approaches Monday night,\n\nlast night, the Al at the Al Smith Dinner here in New York, Mitt Romney\n\nsaid this.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nOBAMA: And even though we`re enjoying ourselves tonight, we`re both\n\nthinking ahead of our final debate on Monday. I`m hoping that Governor\n\nRomney and I will have the chance to answer questions that is on the mind\n\nof millions of Americans watching at home. Is this happening again? Why\n\naren`t they putting on \"The Voice\"?\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nO`DONNELL: President Obama did tip his hand last night on one of the\n\ndebate points he has ready for Monday night.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nOBAMA: Monday`s debate is a little different because the topic is\n\nforeign policy. Spoiler alert: We`ve got bin Laden.\n\nOf course, world affairs are a challenge for every candidate. After\n\nsome of you guys remember. After my foreign trip in 2008, I was attacked\n\nas a celebrity because I was so popular with our alleys overseas. And I\n\nhave to say I`m impressed with how well Governor Romney has avoided that\n\nproblem.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nO`DONNELL: Joining me now: Richard Wolffe and Karen Finney.\n\nRichard, why am I suspecting that the candidates are spending their\n\nweekend trying to figure out how to steer this back to domestic policy\n\nwhenever they can during this foreign policy debate.\n\nRICHARD WOLFFE, MSNBC POLITICAL ANALYST: Because you`ve seen this\n\nstuff before.\n\nO`DONNELL: Yes.\n\nWOLFFE: I mean, remember the foreign policy debate in 2008 turned out\n\nto be about the world economy which turned out to be about the American\n\neconomy and they`ll do some of that again. Trade is an obvious place you\n\ncan do that.\n\nBut don`t under estimate the animosity between these two people and\n\nhow much they want to relitigate every foreign change policy exchange we\n\nsaw in the last two, including, by the way, I would expect, Mitt Romney\n\ngoing back to Libya and having at it all over again, only this time trying\n\nto do a clean-up job. I think they will want to engage because they really\n\ndislike each other and because, let`s face it, Mitt Romney has got some\n\nexplaining to do.\n\nO`DONNELL: Karen Finney, I have good news for you. Rush Limbaugh\n\nbelieves that President Obama is going to win Monday night`s debate. Now,\n\nI want you to listen how Rush thinks he`s going to do that.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nRUSH LIMBAUGH, RADIO TALK SHOW HOST: Just get together with Bob\n\nSchieffer before the debate bike he did Candy Crowley, and say, look, when\n\nthis comes up, you just go there. And we`ll handle it -- we`ll handle it\n\nthat way.\n\nFolks, I -- no, I`m not alleging anything. I just -- I find, I watch\n\nthe debate again and Romney goes on, he said, Mr. President, we have this\n\nover you called it a terrorist attack the day after? And Obama said,\n\nproceed. Governor, proceed.\n\nSo Romney said, OK, we have it on record the president of the United\n\nStates said, blah, blah, blah, and then Obama points and says to Candy\n\nCrowley, get the transcript. And she just happens to have it. So a little\n\npowwow with Bob Schieffer, you never know.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nO`DONNELL: Karen, I show you the ravings of Rush Limbaugh here to\n\nsave you the time to listen to all three hours of it every day yourself.\n\nKAREN FINNEY, MSNBC POLITICAL ANALYST: Oh, thank you.\n\nO`DONNELL: But also because he does have a huge Republican audience\n\nand this does explain what is the real belief among a lot of Republicans\n\nabout exactly how this works. They have a crazy view of what`s possible\n\nMonday night.\n\nFINNEY: Well, they absolutely do. And what they don`t like, right,\n\nis that what really happened was Romney tried to roll up on the president\n\nwith bad facts and the president checked him on it. So, you know, they\n\ndidn`t like that, so now they`ve come up with an alternate theory of\n\nreality which I`m sure they`ll come up with some alternate theory of\n\nreality for the next debate as well.\n\nBut, you know, one thing I think is important. I think it will be a\n\nmistake for President Obama to spend too much time relitigating Libya,\n\nbecause, you know, there are a number of studies that have shown, polls\n\nsemi-recently that have shown the majority of Americans actually are tired\n\nof war. They don`t want more troops in Afghanistan. We don`t want more\n\ntroops in -- they`re wary of sending troops to Syria, they`re wary of the\n\nidea of troops in Iran.\n\nSo I think it`s important for the president to press Romney in the way\n\nyou saw Biden really press Ryan to say, so are you saying you would commit\n\ntroops? Because that is a death knell for Romney. The Americans don`t\n\nwant it. I think it`s another way for Obama to talk about how he has tried\n\nto change the nature of American foreign policy to be more about\n\nmultilateralism and not this sort of cowboy diplomacy.\n\nO`DONNELL: All right. Let`s take a look at President Obama in the\n\n2008 debate, as Richard said, finding a way to take the foreign policy\n\ndebate back to domestic policy. Let`s listen to that.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nOBAMA: You know, we are at a defining moment in our history. Our\n\nnation is involved in two wars. And we are going through the worst\n\nfinancial crisis since the Great Depression. And although we`ve heard a\n\nlot about Wall Street, those of you on Main Street, I think have been\n\nstruggling for a while. And you recognize that this could have an impact\n\non all sectors of the economy.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nO`DONNELL: Richard, surely we will see that from both of them.\n\nWOLFFE: We will. And there is -- there`s a legitimate piece of the\n\ninternational policy debate that deals with the American economy. The\n\nAmerican economy triggered or rather Wall Street triggered this financial\n\ncollapse, it spread through the world economy and it`s been sustained by\n\nEurope.\n\nBut, you know, there are pieces of this international debate, it`s not\n\nreally about trade. It`s the world financial architecture and how banks\n\nare interrelated. I don`t think they`re going to go there because neither\n\ncandidate really has the solution to that piece of it.\n\nBringing it back though, look -- Mitt Romney`s classic debating\n\nposition. We`ve seen it two times already, is not to offer up solution and\n\nto say, I don`t have to do anything. I just have to critique you. You`re\n\nthe president.\n\nSo whenever people ask him, in a debate or otherwise, what would you\n\ndo about this or that problem, Simpson-Bowles. You say the president\n\nfailed in Simpson-Bowles, would you take it? He says, \"I don`t need to\n\ngive you an answer.\" It`s a bit like hearing his wife saying we don`t need\n\nto give you those tax returns. You have all you`re going to get.\n\nFINNEY: You know, I --\n\nO`DONNELL: Go ahead, Karen.\n\nFINNEY: I was going to say, don`t forget, there is another\n\nvulnerability for Governor Romney and that is when we talk about trading,\n\nwe talk about the global economy, President Obama has a wonderful argument\n\nto make about, who was it that was betting against the American economy,\n\nwho was it that was part of shipping jobs overseas, by putting their money\n\nin foreign bank accounts, right, trying to obfuscate their tax\n\nresponsibility to the United States and trying to, you know, reduce their\n\ntax burden?\n\nSo there are some other liabilities that relate to the economy and\n\nforeign policy, if you will, that the president -- that is right for the\n\npresident.\n\nO`DONNELL: Let`s take another look at the 2008 foreign policy debate\n\nand how it managed to stay on the economy.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nOBAMA: There are folks out there who have been struggling before this\n\ncrisis took place, and that`s why it`s so important, as we saw the short\n\nterm problem that we look at some of the underlying issues that have led\n\nfor wages and incomes for ordinary Americans to go down, the health care\n\nsystem that is broken, energy policies that are not working, because, you\n\nknow, 10 days ago, John said that the fundamentals in the economy is sound.\n\nMODERATOR: Say it directly to him.\n\nOBAMA: John, 10 days ago, you said the fundamentals of the economy\n\nare sound.\n\nSEN. JOHN MCCAIN (R), ARIZONA: Are you afraid I couldn`t hear him?\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nWOLFFE: Those were the days when Jim Lehrer intervened in the debate.\n\nYou know, this is where you`ve got a sweet spot for the president,\n\nbecause China is obviously a piece of the international puzzle here. It`s\n\ngot to be part of trade. Mitt Romney is surely going to bring it up.\n\nThat`s where the president brings up our old friend Bain, because it`s\n\npersonal investments, it`s offshoring.\n\nWhen he`s talking about, you know, the middle class suffering over the\n\nyears, you cannot deal with that without talking about Bain and its\n\napproach to outsourcing and shipping companies overseas, these whole\n\nfactories overseas. That`s where the pivot is going to come.\n\nBut don`t get me wrong. Libya is just a piece of it. What is Mitt\n\nRomney`s position on Afghanistan? Why did he say that leaving Iraq was a\n\ndisaster?\n\nI mean, there are really substantive differences that both of these\n\ncandidates need to go through in this debate.\n\nO`DONNELL: Richard Wolffe and Karen Finney, thank you both for\n\njoining me tonight.\n\nWOLFFE: Thank you.\n\nFINNEY: Thanks.\n\nO`DONNELL: Coming up, \"The West Wing\" returns to THE LAST WORD\n\ntonight, this time with lingerie, the kind of lingerie that scares Mitt\n\nRomney the most -- Chinese bras. I will use Chinese bras to show Mitt\n\nRomney just how tough it is to get tough on China trade. That`s in\n\ntonight`s rewrite.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nO`DONNELL: Tonight, Malala lives. And today, she`s been able to\n\nstand again for the first time with some help and she is writing again.\n\nIn a LAST WORD exclusive, \"The New York Times\" journalist who spent\n\nsix months tracking Malala`s fight for the education of girls in Pakistan\n\nwill join us next.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nO`DONNELL: In the Spotlight tonight, Malala lives. This newly\n\nreleased picture shows 15-year-old Malala Yousafzai out of her coma and no\n\nlonger on a ventilator. The brave Pakistani girl is in recovery at a\n\nBritish hospital after being shot in the head on her school bus by the\n\nTaliban Pakistan 10 days ago.\n\nDoctors say Malala wanted this picture released.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nDR. DAVID ROSSER, MEDICAL DIRECTOR AT HOSPITAL TREATING MALALA: It`s\n\nclear that she`s not out of the woods yet. Having said that, she`s doing\n\nvery well. In fact, she was standing with some help for the first time\n\nthis morning when I went in to see her.\n\nShe`s communicating very freely. She`s writing. She`s keen that\n\npeople share the details. She`s also keen that I thank people for their\n\nsupport and their interests. Because she`s obviously aware of the amount\n\nof interest and support this has generated around the world. And she`s\n\nkeen to thank people for that.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nO`DONNELL: Malala is still fighting an infection along the path the\n\nbullet traveled after she was shot at point blank range above her left\n\nbrow. Malala will also need major reconstructive surgery and rehab.\n\nTonight, the man accused of shooting Malala Yousafzai and two of her school\n\nmates has not yet been apprehended, but Pakistani security forces have\n\ndetained several of his relatives.\n\nThe Pakistani Taliban still vows to kill the 15-year-old girl who\n\nrevealed the dangers girls in Pakistan face in this 2009 documentary.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nMALALA YOUSAFZAI, PAKISTANI ACTIVIST: In the world, the girls are\n\ngoing to their schools freely and there is no fear. But in Savath, when we\n\ngo to our school, we are very afraid of Taliban. He will kill us. He will\n\nthrow acid on our face. And he can do anything.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nO`DONNELL: Joining me now for an exclusive interview is the man who\n\ncreated that documentary, Adam B..Ellick, \"New York Times\" video and print\n\njournalist. Adam, thanks for joining us.\n\nHow did you discover Malala to follow her and document what she was\n\ndoing?\n\nADAM B. ELLICK, \"THE NEW YORK TIMES\": Well, I had read a three-\n\nparagraph description in a local paper that said in two weeks the Taliban\n\nare going to close all schools for girls. So I called a Pakistani\n\njournalist who had reported in the region and I asked him how many girls\n\ndoes this affect. And he said 50,000 school girls will be losing their\n\neducation in a few weeks.\n\nSo I asked him to connect me to an educational activist in Swath. And\n\na few days later in a neutral city, because Swath was so dangerous at the\n\ntime, Zaoudine (ph), Malala`s father, showed up. And I didn`t even know\n\nit, but there was a I think 11-year-old girl with him at the time. And she\n\ndidn`t speak for the first maybe 30 minutes or so.\n\nAnd finally, I said who`s this and what do you have to say. And she\n\nspoke in her local language, Pashtun. And only about 10 minutes later did\n\nshe even reveal that she spoke English. So she has transformed quite a\n\nlot. She was once a shy girl. And now she`s quite fiery, as you see.\n\nO`DONNELL: And how old was she when you made your documentary\n\nfollowing her in Pakistan?\n\nELLICK: I believe when we started, she was 10 or 11. And now she`s\n\n15. It was January 2009.\n\nO`DONNELL: And she seems to -- this point made by the hospital today,\n\nthat she actually wants that picture of her released. She seems to\n\nunderstand the power of worldwide media, that this will give encouragement\n\nto all of us who want to see her survive and want her cause to prevail.\n\nELLICK: Yeah. It`s a great point. When I heard that, that`s the\n\nMalala I know. And I can assure you of that. I mean, there were many\n\ntimes when we were filming when it was extremely dangerous. I mean, Malala\n\ndescribed the days I was there as the worst days in Swath, when the Taliban\n\nhad closed down her school. And there were many times when her father\n\nasked me to put away the camera because he was nervous.\n\nI would always get this look from her. She was very quiet. But she\n\nwould just give me the look of sort of, don`t worry you can bring it out\n\nagain. And she was always giving me these approving glances of you can\n\nfilm anything. There are no limits. Always open and always keen to tell\n\nher story.\n\nO`DONNELL: The Taliban has once again issued the threat on her life\n\nif they get another chance. And they say it has nothing to do with the\n\neducation part of her cause. They say it`s simply because she`s a traitor,\n\nthat that is why they want to kill her.\n\nELLICK: Yeah. The Taliban released a seven-page statement earlier\n\nthis week. And they listed several reasons for why they issued this\n\nassassination attempt. I think one thing to extract from this statement is\n\nthat they`re on the defensive. I mean, they rarely release a statement and\n\ncertainly almost never seven pages, and in Urdu, which -- normally they\n\nrelease statements in Pashtun, which is the language in the tribal areas.\n\nSo it shows that they`re clearly backed up to the edge. And they`re\n\non the defensive. And as you see from the video this week in Pakistan, the\n\ncountry has come out in widespread unanimous support in favor of Malala.\n\nAnd that`s something we didn`t see when politicians, three prominent\n\npoliticians were assassinated in Pakistan last year. There was more of a\n\ndivided reaction.\n\nO`DONNELL: Adam, the Taliban is also threatening to kill Pakistani\n\njournalists who cover this story. How dangerous was it for you to be doing\n\nwhat you did with Malala?\n\nELLICK: Well, those were really dangerous times. And the only reason\n\nthat I was able to realize this film -- well, several reasons. One of\n\ncourse is the courage of Malala and her father, Zaoudine. But I worked\n\nvery closely with two incredibly courageous Pakistani journalists who took\n\ntremendous risks to go into areas that had a curfew at night, and where\n\nshelling was going on.\n\nAnd I give the credit to them, because those guys, you know, they live\n\nthere. That`s their home. And they`re putting their life on the line\n\nevery day telling these kinds of stories. I was just there for a year or\n\nso.\n\nO`DONNELL: Quickly before we go, people keep asking how they might be\n\nable to help Malala.\n\nELLICK: Great question. There are -- there are several initiatives\n\ngoing on. One of the good ones, one of the ones that I think is doing\n\nsomething on a more societal level, is EducationEnvoy.org. It`s run by\n\nGordon Brown, the global education ambassador for the United Nations. And\n\nhe`s going to Pakistan next week to lobby President Zardari of Pakistan to\n\nget every girl in Pakistan an education.\n\nSo it`s an e-mail petition in which people can sign to support that\n\nthey want all girls in Pakistan to go to school. Keep in mind that in the\n\narea where Malala is from, only half of the girls are educated --\n\nofficially enrolled in school.\n\nO`DONNELL: Adam Ellick of \"the New York Times.\" can`t thank you\n\nenough for brining her story to the world. And thanks for joining us\n\ntonight.\n\nELLICK: Thank you for caring.\n\nO`DONNELL: In Illinois, the war over women is being fought by a woman\n\nwith combat experience, Democratic Congressional candidate Tammy Duckworth,\n\nwho is running against Republican Congressman Joe Walsh. Tammy Duckworth\n\njoins me in a LAST WORD exclusive.\n\nAnd in the Rewrite tonight, everything -- just everything Mitt Romney\n\nneeds to know about lingerie is in an episode of \"The West Wing.\" Chinese\n\nbras might not come up in Monday night`s debate, but if you really want to\n\ntalk tough with China, you`re going to have to talk to the Chinese\n\ngovernment about lingerie. That`s in the Rewrite.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nO`DONNELL: In the Rewrite tonight, women`s undergarments,\n\nspecifically bras. And even more specifically, the scariest bras in the\n\nworld, Chinese bras.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Chinese bras are killing us.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: They are?\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: They`re flooding Wal-Mart with cheap bras.\n\nDomestic producers can`t compete. China has tripled its market share in\n\nthe last two years.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: I assume we`re all OK with French bras, right?\n\nBecause I for one prefer them and --\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: This isn`t funny.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Of course not. Look, I`m with you on this one. I\n\njust wish the president could do something about cheap bras.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: He can.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: He can activate the textile and apparel import\n\nsafe guards we got you guys to put in the deal admitting to the WTO,\n\nstarting with bras.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Apparent import safeguards, didn`t know about\n\nthat.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Everyone`s going to know about it tomorrow when we\n\nstart burning bras in front of the White House.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: I`ll be right back.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nO`DONNELL: Ah, the great Richard Schiff. I wrote that episode of\n\n\"The West Wing\" in 2004 when Chinese bras were surging into the American\n\nmarket. Chinese bras now have serious competition for market share in\n\nAmerica. But that competition does not come from American lingerie\n\nmanufacturers. It comes from other Asian bra manufacturers.\n\nIt turns out getting tough with China and preserving the American\n\nmarket for American manufacturers is not as easy as simpletons like Donald\n\nTrump and Mitt Romney think it is. At the debate on Monday night, I\n\nguarantee you, you will hear Mitt Romney make this empty promise once\n\nagain.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nROMNEY: On day one, I will label China a currency manipulator.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nO`DONNELL: And I guarantee you that Mitt Romney would never do that\n\nif elected president. It is traditional for candidates running for\n\npresident, who are not already president to demagogue about international\n\ntrade. Both Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama said when they were running\n\nagainst each other as president that they would reopen NAFTA. Do you\n\nremember the day President Obama announced he would not reopen NAFTA?\n\nNo, you don`t. Because it was a buried news story in the back of the\n\nbusiness section in the \"New York Times\" about 90 days into the Obama\n\npresidency. In the White House, there is not a Democratic position on\n\ntrade and a Republican position on trade. There is simply a presidential\n\nposition on trade. And the presidential position is flawlessly consistent.\n\nAnd it is simply that the president must first do no harm, which means the\n\npresident must not take any action that can provoke a trade war.\n\nAnd presidents never do take such action, no matter what they have\n\npromised on the campaign trail. Presidents publicly complain about China\n\non trade issues, then they privately negotiate with China on trade. They\n\nhave some wins with China and they have some losses with China on trade.\n\nBut taking punitive action with China or any other country other than Cuba\n\nis almost always more costly to the United States than it is to China or\n\nthat other country.\n\nIn 2009, the Obama administration imposed tariffs on tires imported\n\nfrom China. And last month the administration very quietly let that tariff\n\nexpire. After one study says that that tariff preserved maybe about 1,200\n\nAmerican jobs at a cost of 1.1 billion dollars. That would be 900,000\n\ndollars per job.\n\nNow, those numbers could be overstated, even significantly overstated.\n\nBut what`s absolutely true is that any tariff we put on any product in this\n\ncountry is paid not by the country that produces the product. It is paid\n\nby American consumers when they purchase that product. Tariffs are simply\n\nsales taxes on American consumers. And that`s why tariffs are almost\n\nalways self-defeating.\n\nSo if a president wants to get tough with China and slap some heavy\n\ntariffs on Chinese products, the question for that president is very\n\nsimple: Mr. President, tell us exactly what products you want to make much\n\nmore expensive for American consumers. And presidents look at that menu of\n\nchoice and wisely choose none of the above.\n\nMitt Romney likes to pretend that he`s the only candidate who cares\n\nabout Chinese currency manipulation. American presidents have been\n\npressuring the Chinese on their currency manipulation for decades now. And\n\nno president has been more successful in dealing with Chinese currency than\n\nPresident Obama.\n\nDuring President Obama`s term, the value of Chinese currency has\n\nactually increased 11 percent. And that`s what we want it to do. We want\n\nit to increase, because Chinese goods are cheap not just because their\n\nlabor prices are lower, but because China has always manipulated its\n\ncurrency to have a lower value so that Chinese goods are lower priced in\n\nthe world market.\n\nThat`s how they do it. What we really want China to do is to allow\n\nits currency to float in the international currency market. We want the\n\nvalue of the Chinese currency to be determined by the international market.\n\nBut China refuses to do that because they know that would make their goods\n\nmuch more expensive.\n\nSo American presidents, publicly and privately, push and push and\n\npush. And the most important pushes are all done privately. They push the\n\nChinese on their currency. For most of President Bush`s eight years, the\n\nvalue of the Chinese currency stayed absolutely flat. The Bush\n\nadministration couldn`t push the Chinese successfully on currency\n\nmanipulation at all.\n\nIn just three and a half years of the Obama administration, the\n\nChinese currency has increased 11 percent. President Obama has gotten a\n\nlittle help from his friends on this one. Democratic Senator Chuck Schumer\n\npushed a bill through the Senate that was publicly presented as a big\n\ncrackdown on Chinese currency manipulation, but really it just required the\n\nsecretary of the Treasury to file a bunch of reports analyzing Chinese\n\ncurrency.\n\nIt never even came to a vote in the House of Representatives. But it\n\nwas a very good way of showing the Chinese how much political pressure\n\nthere is in Washington on the issue of their currency manipulation. The\n\nSchumer bill was part of a public, an important game that we play with\n\nChina which is part of the game of playing tough with China.\n\nChina does actually respond to the public pressure that Senator\n\nSchumer brings to the game and the public and private pressure that the\n\nObama administration brings to the game. So on Monday night when you hear\n\nMitt Romney once again say this.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nROMNEY: On day one, I will label China a currency manipulator.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nO`DONNELL: Don`t expect the moderator to fact check him on that one,\n\nbut you can tell everyone in your living room that Mitt Romney is lying\n\nonce again.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nREP. JOE WALSH (R), ILLINOIS: I was marching in a parade in Chaumberg\n\nSunday, two days before the Democratic convention, when Tammy Duckworth was\n\non a stage down in Charlotte, if you can look at the picture, picking out a\n\ndress for her speech Tuesday night.\n\nREP. TAMMY DUCKWORTH (D), ILLINOIS: And yes, I do sometimes look at\n\nthe clothes that I wear. But you know, for most of my adult life, I have\n\nworn one color. It`s called camouflage.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nO`DONNELL: That was a scene from last week`s debate between Tammy\n\nDuckworth and Republican Congressman Joe Walsh. Last night the two\n\ncandidates competing for Illinois` eighth congressional district seat met\n\nagain for their final debate before November`s election. Here`s what Joe\n\nWalsh had to say about reproductive rights.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nWALSH: I`m pro-life without exception. Understand though, when we\n\ntalk about exceptions, we talk about rape, incest, health of a woman, the\n\nlife of the woman. Life of the woman is not an exception.\n\nDUCKWORTH: He would let a woman die rather than --\n\n(CROSS TALK)\n\nDUCKWORTH: -- than to give the doctor the option to save her life.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nO`DONNELL: After the debate, Joe Walsh added this.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nWALSH: Let me briefly say there`s no such exception. With modern\n\ntechnology and science, you can`t find one instance. This is an issue that\n\nopponents of life throw out there to make us look unreasonable. There`s no\n\nsuch exception as life of the mother.\n\nAnd as far as health of the mother, same thing. With advances in\n\nscience and technology, there`s -- health of the mother has been -- has\n\nbecome a tool for abortions any time under any reason.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: You mean to say it`s never medically necessary to\n\ndo an abortion to save the life of the mother.\n\nWALSH: Absolutely.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nO`DONNELL: And this afternoon, medical expert Joe Walsh said this.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nWALSH: When I say I`m pro-life, I mean that I`m pro-life for the\n\nmother and I`m pro-life for the unborn child. While I do not support\n\nabortion, I do of course support medical procedures for women during their\n\npregnancies that might result in the loss of an unborn child.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nO`DONNELL: Joining me now for an exclusive interview, the woman\n\nrunning against Joe Walsh, Lieutenant Colonel Tammy Duckworth, an Iraq war\n\nveteran and purple heart recipient.\n\nTammy Duckworth, it looks like you`re running against a moving target\n\nhere on this issue.\n\nDUCKWORTH: Well, the rest of that clip actually this afternoon,\n\nLawrence, he said that ectopic pregnancies were so rare that they never\n\nhappened, and because of that, he stands by his position of pro life\n\nwithout exception. Now, never mind that women can need abortions because\n\nthey`re undergoing chemotherapy due to cancer, preeclampsia, so many\n\nreasons. But I think he`s taking biology lessons from Todd Akin on this.\n\nO`DONNELL: The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists\n\nactually addressed this today with a statement saying, \"more than 600 women\n\ndie each year from pregnancy and child birth related reasons right here in\n\nthe United States.\"\n\nI`m just stunned by watching -- I mean, I`ve been watching him for a\n\nlong time for other reasons of crazy things he`s said. But as you come\n\ndown to the wire in campaigns, I would actually expect candidates to get\n\nmore careful. This guy just seems capable of saying anything at any time.\n\nDUCKWORTH: Well, you know, I`m saddened but not surprised, Lawrence,\n\nbecause this is who he is. He believes in these extreme positions. And\n\nhe`s backed by extreme people. There`s a super PAC that has vowed to flood\n\nme under a sea of negative ads just to get him elected. They don`t care\n\nthat he`s out of touch with the district.\n\nBut this is who this guy is, whether it`s his comments about military\n\nveterans or African-Americans or the president, or now that women can`t die\n\nfrom pregnancy. It`s not acceptable.\n\nO`DONNELL: What was the point he was trying to make about you at the\n\nDemocratic convention in which he managed to get himself booed at your\n\ndebate?\n\nDUCKWORTH: Well, he`s a very sexist kind of a guy. He`s called me\n\ndear. He has offered to hold my hand. He grabs me during debates, pokes\n\nme. And he was just trying to say that I was more concerned about picking\n\nout the outfits that I`m going to wear, rather than concentrating on the\n\nissues in the district.\n\nYou know, I just let him have it. Look, I`ve worn one color most of\n\nmy adult life. It`s called camouflage. Back off, buddy. I don`t scare\n\neasy.\n\nO`DONNELL: And I have to ask you about, how did it play in the\n\ndistrict that he failed to pay child support for so many years?\n\nDUCKWORTH: People hate that he never -- that he did not pay child\n\nsupport. His congressional salary is actually still being garnished. The\n\nonly reason he`s paying child support is because he`s got a job as a\n\ncongressman that his ex-wife can actually have garnished for child support.\n\nThat`s not responsible. That`s not the kind of behavior we need in a\n\nCongress person in this country.\n\nO`DONNELL: Tammy Duckworth, thank you very much for joining us\n\ntonight. You get tonight`s LAST WORD.\n\nDUCKWORTH: Thank you.\n\nO`DONNELL: \"THE ED SHOW\" is up next.\n\nEND\n\nCopyright 2012 CQ-Roll Call, Inc.
