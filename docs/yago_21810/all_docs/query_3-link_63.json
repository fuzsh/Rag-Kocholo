The first Population and Housing Census of Cambodia in 36 years was held in March 1998. Before 1998 it was in 1962 that a census was conducted. No census could be conducted in Cambodia for 36 years due to disturbed conditions. Exactly ten years after the 1998 census the next census is being conducted in 2008. The Statistics Law specifies that the Population Census should be conducted at least once every ten years. You are privileged to be a census enumerator and take part in this great task. You are performing a duty which is of national importance. While you are privileged to be a census enumerator, you have a big responsibility as well. You have to fulfill it with a sense of pride and devotion to duty. Please read this instruction manual thoroughly which will help in discharging your duties satisfactorily.\n\n1.1 This chapter gives the background and objectives of the General Population Census of Cambodia, 2008. It also explains the various uses of census data and some facts about the census undertaking.\n\nThe General Population Census\n\n1.2 A census of population refers to the entire process of collecting, compiling, evaluating, analyzing and publishing data about the population of a country. It involves listing persons and recording the characteristics of every one of them at a specified time. When the information thus collected in the census are compiled and analyzed we get to know about the size and distribution of the population as well as its demographic, social, economic and cultural characteristics. These are very essential for making suitable plans and programs for national and local development.\n\n1.3 In February-March 2008, the census of population called the General Population Census of Cambodia will be conducted throughout the country. The General Population Census of Cambodia, 2008 will collect basic demographic, economic, social and cultural information of each individual as well as some information on buildings occupied by households and housing conditions and facilities available to households. This will help update population number and characteristics and estimate population growth rate from national up to village level.\n\nObjectives of the 2008 Census\n\nGeneral Objectives\n\n2. The 2008 Census seeks to create an inventory of the country's manpower resources and demographic characteristics as at a given time. Only the census can provide data for small areas (e.g. village) for local planning purposes.\n\nSpecific Objectives\n\n[p.2]\n\n2.1 In particular, the 2008 Census aims to:\n\n(1) Obtain an up-to-date count of the population by age and sex.\n\n(2) Give the geographic distribution of the population by demographic and socio-economic characteristics.\n\n(3) Provide frames for surveys and other statistical programs.\n\nUses of Census Data\n\n3. The census data are required not only for administration but for also for economic and development planning. The ultimate aim of such planning is to provide a better way of life for the people of Cambodia. This will include reduction of poverty, increasing employment opportunities, improving the educational levels of the population and providing health for all.\n\n3.1 Planning for education obviously requires knowledge of the number of children of school age who are likely to require schooling at various levels. The Government cannot know where to build the necessary schools or how many school teachers must be trained unless it knows where the need is great in terms of the number of children who should be going to school.\n\n3.2 The Government wishes to improve and extend the medical services of the country so as to eliminate diseases and to reduce the number of children dying in infancy and early childhood. But if medical services are to be planned properly, the Government must know the number of people involved, the number of children being born, and the rate at which they are dying.\n\n3.3 For providing these services, it is not enough just to know how many people there are at the time of the census because figures of this kind get out-of-date very quickly. We must know also how fast the population is increasing, so that the Government could know how many people there will be, not only this year but also next year, in five years, in ten years, etc. We therefore obtain information not only of people now living, but also of the number of children being born and the number of children who have died.\n\n3.4 For planning for proper housing and to improve amenities like electric supply, drinking water, sewerage, etc. the census data will provide guidelines to the planners and administrators. Census data will also be useful in several ways in trade, commerce, industry and in population research.\n\n[p.3]\n\nCensus Date and Reference Time\n\n4. March 3, 2008 has been designated as the census day. The reference time for the 2008 Census is 00:00 hours of March 3, 2008. This means that the 2008 Census is expected to provide the population of Cambodia as at 00:00 hours of March 3, 2008.\n\n4.1 The preliminary work of house listing (i.e. listing of buildings and households) will, however, commence on February 29, 2008. Following is the calendar of the 2008 Census Operations:\n\nFebruary 29-March 2, 2008 (3 days): House listing\n\nMarch 3-13, 2008 (11 days): Census Enumeration\n\nMarch 14-16, 2008 (3 days): Collection of filled-in records in the Commune offices\n\nMarch 20-31, 2008 (12 days): Receipt of census records at NIS\n\nAuthority for the 2008 Census\n\n5. The 2008 census is conducted under the authority of (i) the Royal Decree (Kret) No. JS/RKT/02-96/08 dated February 29, 1996 on the organization of the General Population Census of Cambodia (ii) The Statistics Law enacted on May 9, 2005 and (iii) Sub-Decree No. 08 dated 30 January 2006. The Sub-decree specifies the census date as March 3, 2008 and deals with organizing and functioning of the 2008 Census.\n\nField Organization of the Census\n\n6. The National Census Committee for the General Population Census of Cambodia constituted by the Sub-decree under the chairmanship of HE Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Interior has the responsibility for instructing, deciding and endorsing all general items of work related to the census. During the conduct of the census, the population census office of the NIS under the Director General of Census will be the central unit that will serve as the monitoring and communication and action center for the census. It will have separate divisions each in charge of an activity like administration, planning and monitoring etc. In the field, the NIS Regional Officer (RO) will act as the coordinator for his/her region and will be responsible for the operations in the region.\n\n[p.4]\n\n6.1 The Province Director of Planning will act as the provincial census officer for his/her province and will be responsible for the operations in the province. In technical matters he/she will be assisted by the Assistant Regional Officer who will be a NIS Officer.\n\n6.2 The District Chief assisted by his staff will be the officer in charge of census operations in the District. The Commune Chief will be the census charge officer for the commune. He/she will be assisted in technical matters by an officer from Province/District Offices and Area Supervisors.\n\nEnumerators will be drawn from school teachers and other officials at the rate of one enumerator for an EA or Enumeration Area (about 100 households or 500 to 600 persons). Generally one supervisor will be appointed to closely supervise the work of four enumerators. Outside the NIS, special bodies will be created to make possible the much needed interagency co-operation and involvement in conducting the census successfully. Figure 1 shows the organizational structure of the 2008 Census.\n\n[p. 5]\n\n[2008 General Population Census of Cambodia Organization Chart is not presented here.]\n\n[p. 6]\n\nImportant Provisions of the Royal Decree on Census\n\n7. For your reference and information, certain important provisions of the Royal Decree (Kret) on the Organization of the General Population Census of Cambodia are reproduced below:\n\nArticle 7: All owners and occupants of houses and managers of other places must allow census officers access thereto as they may require for the purpose of the census and must allow them to paint on, or affix to, the place such letters, marks or numbers as may be necessary for the purposes of the census.\n\nArticle 8: The Census Officer may ask all questions mentioned in the census questionnaire during the census operation of the head of the household or all members of the household within the local area for which he/she is appointed as the census officer.\n\nArticle 9: Every person, of whom any question is asked under Article 8, shall be legally bound to answer such questions to the best of his/her knowledge and belief.\n\nArticle 12: Personal information collected in the census operations must be used for statistical purposes only. Such information may not be given to the tax units, or to courts for use in prosecutions or to any other organization under any circumstances or motivations. Any claim allowed in court or any obligation to pay taxes based on personal information obtained in the census operations is void.\n\n7.1 Articles 13 and 14 lay down penalties for certain offences committed in this connection. For example, the following are punishable offences: (i) any census officer appointed by the Government for census work who refuses to do that work or does not complete his/her task (ii) any census officer who makes any false return to the census office (iii) any census officer who discloses any information received in the census (iv) any person who intentionally gives a false answer or refuses to answer the questions asked by a census officer. The Statistics Law (Article 22) also states that staff and employees shall ensure confidentiality of all individual information collected from respondents except under special circumstances with the consent of the Ministry of Planning. Articles 23 to 25 provide for other rights and obligations. Articles 26 to 29 provide for penalties for violation of the Law.\n\n7.2 Please take note that according to the above provisions of the Royal Decree and Statistics Law you have to perform your duty as 2008 Census Officer diligently and keep the information collected at the census confidential, to be used for statistical purposes only.\n\nThe 2008 Census Schedules\n\n[p.7]\n\n8. The 2008 Census will gather information through two schedules Form A: House list and Form B: Household Questionnaire. (See Appendix I and II) Form A: House list which will be canvassed during the preliminary round (February 29 to March 2, 2008) will be used to collect the following information in respect of buildings which have households in them: Building/Structure number [Footnote: Wherever the word building is used hereinafter it refers to a building or a structure (Building/Structure)], predominant construction material of wall, roof and floor of building, whether building is wholly or partly residential, household number, and name and sex of head of household and number of persons usually living in the household.\n\n9. Form B: Household Questionnaire has five parts: Parts 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5. This will be used for census enumeration during March 3 to 13, 2008 in all households. In Part 1, information on usual members of household present on Census Night (March 2-3, 2008), visitors present on Census Night and usual members absent on Census Night will be collected.\n\n10. Part 2 of Form B, will be used to collect the following information in respect of each usual member of household present and each visitor to household: Full name, relationship to head of household, sex, age, marital status, mother tongue, religion birth place, previous residence, duration of stay, reason for migration, literacy, full time education physical or mental disability and economic characteristics.\n\n11. In Part 3 of Form B, fertility information of females aged 15 and over in the household will be collected. In Part 4 of Form B, the following information will be collected on housing conditions and facilities of household: basis of occupation of the dwelling by household (like owner occupied or rented), main source of light available for the household, main cooking fuel used by household, whether a toilet facility is available within premises, main source of drinking water supply for the household with location of source, number of living rooms occupied by household and whether the following facilities are available: radio/transistor, television, telephone, personal computers, cell phone, bicycle, motorcycle, car and tractor. Information on whether the household has access to Internet will also be collected.\n\n12. The above information will help in knowing the demographic and housing characteristics of the country as a whole. It is, therefore, very necessary that the information is collected as accurately as possible. The Enumerator's work will be closely supervised by a Supervisor and other supervising officers.\n\n[p.8]\n\n[Section 12.1 Enumerator's kit is not presented here.]\n\n[p. 9]\n\nCHAPTER 2\n\nFilling in of Form A: House list\n\nThe House list\n\n13. Form A: House list will be filled in as a preliminary operation for three days preceding the Census Night. Before the census enumeration is taken up, it is essential to locate and identify all places which are occupied or used or which are likely to be occupied or used by people. The house listing operations are mainly meant for this purpose and house listing is a primary but important step in the census. The house list will help identify households first before the enumeration is done. It will also provide preliminary information on the number of persons usually living in the household or usual members of the household.\n\n14. The house list which is proposed to be filled during the house listing operations is given at the end of this book (Appendix I). It will be noted that the Form is simple. The manner in which the house list has to be completed and the concepts and their explanation are described in detail in this chapter. It is absolutely essential for you to become thoroughly familiar with these instructions since this job of house listing is an extremely important one. Apart from listing of houses you will also be collecting some useful data on housing which are required for planning purposes. The success of the house listing operations is very much dependent on a thorough understanding of the concepts, definitions and instructions and on a faithful application of these concepts and definitions and following the instructions in the actual filling of the house list form. If you have any doubts you should not hesitate to ask your supervisor for clarification.\n\n15. The house listing operations will involve certain basic steps which may be briefly summarized as follows:\n\n(i) Updating Enumeration Area Map (EA map) given to you in respect of your Enumeration Area (EA).\n\n(ii) Numbering of buildings and households in your EA and marking them on the EA Map.\n\n(iii) Filling in the house list itself.\n\n16. The procedure for updating EA map is first described and after that the basic concepts relating to a building and a household are described. This is followed by the actual instructions with regard to filling in the house list.\n\nUpdating EA Map\n\n[p.10]\n\n17. In order to be able to complete the house list, it would be necessary to locate and identify the buildings and households. This can be done only if you are thoroughly familiar with the area assigned to you for these operations. The purpose of the EA map is to help you to understand your jurisdiction or EA. Also, it is only if an EA map is with you that it will be possible for you to allot building numbers in a systematic manner. The first step, therefore, is to update the EA map and mark the residential and partly residential buildings.\n\n18. The EA map that will be given to you is a sketch map which is not drawn to scale. It was prepared a few months ago and therefore, may require updating. An EA may include a village or part of a village (in case of a big village). EAs are delineated or formed in such a way that no building or structure with one or more households is left out. The EA map shows the general topographical details. The topographical details indicated on the EA map include permanent features and landmarks such as the village site, well-known roads, cart tracks, hills, rivers, etc., and also railway line, hospitals, schools, pagodas and similar clearly recognizable physical features. You may update the EA map first in consultation with the village chief concerned. Verify whether these recognizable features are found in their proper places in the EA map. You may make the necessary corrections by adding any new feature noticed by you or deleting any non-existing feature. If you find any new residential area not marked, you may indicate the same on the EA map.\n\n19. The next step is to locate every single building occupied by one or more households in the EA. Such buildings should be marked on the EA map as indicated below:\n\n[] Building wholly used for residential purpose\n\n[] Building used both for residential and non-residential purposes (e.g. residence and shop, residence and handloom weaving, residence and workshop etc.).\n\n20. When once the location of every building used wholly or partly for residential purposes is demarcated on the EA map it will be a simple matter to decide on numbering the buildings. No hard and fast rule can be laid down as to the direction in which the building numbers should run i.e. left to right or in a clockwise order or north-west to south-east and so on. Much depends on the lay-out. What is expected is that some convenient and intelligible order is followed.\n\nNumbering of Buildings\n\n21. The instructions given hereafter will guide you to determine a building for the purpose of house listing. A building is a readily distinguishable structure or group of structures which is taken as the unit for building numbering. The objective is to ultimately number and list out\n\n[p.11]\n\nall physical units of constructions which are used for residential purposes, either wholly or partly.\n\n22. Building: A building is generally a single structure on the ground. It is covered by a roof and usually enclosed within external walls or with common dividing walls with adjacent buildings. In some areas the very nature of construction of houses is such that there may not be any wall. For example when a conical roof almost touches the ground and an entrance is also provided then there will not be any wall as such. Such structures should be treated as buildings. Sometimes a building is made up of more than one component unit which are used or likely to be used as dwellings (residences) or as establishments such as shops, business houses, offices, factories, workshops, work-sheds, schools, places of entertainment and places of worship or as go-downs, stores, animal sheds, etc. It is also possible that buildings which have component units may be used for a combination of purposes such as shop-cum-residence, workshop-cum-residence, office-cum-residence, etc.\n\n23. Sometimes a series of different buildings may be found along the street which are joined with one another by common walls on either side looking like a continuous structure. These different units are practically independent of one another and likely to have been built at different times and owned by different persons. In such cases, though the whole structure with all the adjoining units apparently appears to be one building, each portion should be treated as a separate building and given separate numbers. You may also come across cases, particularly in Phnom Penh, of multi-storied flats. In these cases, while the structure looks like one building, the flats are occupied by different households. In the case of such multi-storied structures having a number of flats occupied by different households, each flat should be treated as one building and given a building number and each household in that flat should be identified and enumerated. However, a building with a ground floor and one, two or three floors will not be treated as a multi-storied building. In that case each household occupying that building will be treated as a household belonging to that building and will not be given a separate building number.\n\n24. If there is more than one structure within an enclosed or open compound (premises) belonging to the same person, e.g., the main house, animal shed, sitting place, garage, etc., only one building number should be given for this unit.\n\n25. The buildings should be numbered in a systematic manner as follows:\n\n(i) Only buildings containing households and vacant buildings should be numbered for listing. Thus, buildings which are wholly residential and buildings which are partly residential and partly nonresidential (like a shop in which a family is also living; an office in which the watchman is living etc.) should be numbered. Buildings which are wholly used for non-residential purposes need not be numbered.\n\n[p.12]\n\n(ii) If an EA consists of a number of streets, the buildings in the various streets should be numbered continuously. Streets should be taken in uniform order from north-west to south-east. It has been observed that the best way of numbering the buildings is to continue with one consecutive serial on one side of the street and complete numbering on that side, before crossing over to the end of the other side of the street and continuing with the serial, stopping finally opposite to where the first number began.\n\n(iii) In a town/city EA, the numbering will have to run along the street and not in any arbitrary geographical direction.\n\n(iv) Three digit numbers should be used for building numbers like 001, 002... 999. The building number should be painted or marked on a sticker to be pasted at the entrance of the building in a manner that it can easily catch the eyes of any observer. While painting (or marking on a sticker) the building number, the letter C may be marked before it like C 008, C 021, etc. to distinguish our numbering (\"C\" standing for Census) from other numbers which the building may have.\n\n26. In some cases, the pattern of habitation may be such that a group of huts located in a compound, whether enclosed or not enclosed, is occupied by one household. While the main residence may be located in one hut, other huts may be used for sleeping or as a kitchen, bathroom, etc. Though each of the huts is a separate structure, they form a single housing unit and therefore, have to be treated collectively as a single building/structure for the purpose of the census. If some of the huts are used by one household and the others by a second household as residence, then the two groups of huts should be treated as two separate building units. You may also find people living in floating houses near the bank of river which are fixed and do not move from place to place like boats. These floating houses may be treated as buildings/structures and numbered along with other buildings in the EA concerned. Some people may be living in caves, big steel containers or unserviceable buses which are fixed to the ground. These may be also considered as buildings/structures of the EA concerned and numbered.\n\nHousehold\n\n27. A household is a group of persons who commonly live together and would take their meals from a common kitchen unless the exigencies of work prevented any of them from doing so. There may be a household of persons related by blood, a household of unrelated persons or a mix of both. Examples of unrelated households are boarding houses, messes, hostels, residential hotels, rescue homes, jails, pagodas, etc. These are called \"Institutional Households\". There may be one-member households, two-member households or multi-member households. For census purposes each one of these types is regarded as a \"Household\".\n\n[p.13]\n\n28. If a group of persons who are unrelated to each other live in a building/structure, but do not have their meals from a common kitchen, then they would not constitute an Institutional household. Each such person should be treated as a separate household. The important link in finding out whether there is a household or not is the existence of a common kitchen.\n\n28.1 Each household in a building will be allotted numbers like 01, 02, etc., and will be listed according to the instructions that follow. As each household will be related to the physical structure of a building, the household number as such may not be painted (or marked on a sticker) on the door of each building. In case there are several households in a building, (e.g. flats) household numbers may be painted on the door (or marked on a sticker) for easy identification.\n\nMarking Building Numbers on EA Map\n\n29. The numbers allotted to each building and the number of households contained in each building should be marked on the EA map as shown below:\n\n[EA map omitted here]\n\n29.1 With the help of arrow marks at convenient intervals, the direction in which the building numbers run should be indicated.\n\n29.2 Specimen map of a village with two EAs and specimen map of EA 1 of that village after listing and updating, may be seen at Appendix III (A) and Appendix III (B).\n\nHouse listing\n\n30. After numbering of the building and marking it on the EA map, the next step is to list the building and household in a prescribed schedule, namely the House list. At the census this form called Form A: House list (see Appendix I), will be canvassed by you in the first stage.\n\n30.1 You have to visit every building in your EA and make sure to list buildings which have households or persons living in them. You have to be careful in the case of office and business buildings as watchman or some members of staff may use them as premises. You must include such buildings\n\n[p.14]\n\nused for both residential and non-residential purposes in the list. Vacant buildings and locked buildings occupied by households should also be included in the list.\n\n30.2 The instructions given below will guide you in filling in the house list:\n\nOn the top of the house list form, provision is made to note the name of Khet/Krong with Code No.; name of Srok/Khand with Code No.; name of Khum/Sangkat with Code No.; name of Phum/Mondol with Code No.; and Enumeration Area No. Alternate names of administrative units like Khet/Krong, Srok/Khand are given for convenience. The names of the unit not applicable may be scored out. For example, if your EA is in Krong and not in Khet score out Khet, etc. These entries which will be referred to as \"Identification Particulars\" hereafter are to be filled in by you very carefully. This is the method by which every village in any Khum/Sangkat in every Srok/Khand of the Khet/Krong is identified by a combination of numbers. For this purpose every such unit would have been allotted code numbers. Your supervisor would have indicated to you the code numbers. You will have to enter these numbers in the relevant spaces against the names of the various jurisdictional units. It will be advisable to fill in the Identification Particulars in the blank forms before your commence house listing as it will save time during your rounds.\n\nColumn 1: Line Number\n\n31. Every line in the House list is to be numbered by you serially. The line numbers will be continuous for your EA. For your convenience, serial numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, ... 9 and 0 have already been printed in this column. The last line number may be made 10, by writing 1 before 0 in the first page. In the second page, you can convert number 1 into 11 by writing 1 before 1; number 2 can be made 12 and so on. The last number can be made 20. This procedure can be continued till the end of EA.\n\nColumn 2: Building/Structure Number\n\n32. The number which has been assigned in the EA map and which has been painted (or marked on a sticker) by you on the building which contains one or more households, should be entered in this column without the letter C (e.g. 001, 002 etc.).\n\nColumns 3 to 5: Predominant Construction Material of Building/Structure\n\n33. This question has been divided into three parts: (a) material of wall; (b) material of roof; and (c) material of floor. For your convenience the description of the predominant construction material has been indicated on the house list itself under each item, i.e., wall, roof and floor. A numerical code for a group of materials has been indicated. What you should do is to enquire about the materials of construction of building and enter the\n\n[p.15]\n\nappropriate code in Columns 3 to 5 for each of the materials of wall, roof and floor respectively. You may be also able to see these materials.\n\nColumn 3: Material of Wall\n\n34. For material of wall, eight codes have been provided which are indicated in the schedule itself. In order to determine the material of wall you have to take into account the material out of which the major portions of the walls of the building are made and then select the appropriate code. The code thus selected should be entered in Column 3. Dash (-) will be entered in the case of a structure with pillars and without walls, since question of wall does not arise in such a case. This can be explained in the Remarks column.\n\n34.1 In case material of wall is other than those listed with Codes 1 to 7, write 8 and give the name of material in Column 3 itself or in Remarks column.\n\nColumn 4: Material of Roof\n\n35. For material of roof of the building, eight codes have been provided. These are indicated in the schedule itself. If two or more kinds of materials are used for roof, the material that is mostly used may be taken as the roof material. After ascertaining the material of the roof you have to give the suitable numerical code in Column 4. In case the material of roof is other than those listed with Codes 1 to 7, write 8 and give the name of material in Column 4 itself or in Remarks column.\n\nColumn 5: Material of Floor\n\n36. For material of floor, seven codes have been provided as indicated in the schedule itself. For the material of floor you have again to take the major portion of material out of which the floor of the building is made. For example, if in a building only the drawing room has ceramic tiles floor while all other rooms and corridors have just cement flooring, the material of floor to be recorded here will be \"cement\", i.e. Code 3. If a building has tiled floor in the bathroom and all other rooms have cement floor the material of floor will again be \"cement\".\n\n36.1 It is emphasized that while recording the materials of wall, roof and floor, you have only to give the code number in the columns provided for this purpose and not description, except for other (specify).\n\nColumn 6: Purpose of Building/Structure\n\n37. If a building is used wholly for residential purpose, give Code 1 in this column. If it is used as a residence as well as a shop, give Code 2. If it is used as a residence and workshop (or a household industry like weaving, pottery etc.), give Code 3. If it is used as a residence and any other\n\n[p.16]\n\nestablishment, give Code 4 and specify that establishment. Examples of Code 4 are residence and school, residence and office, residence and bank, residence and pagoda, etc. In these cases write 4. school; 4. office; 4. bank; 4. pagoda, etc.\n\nImportant Note\n\n38. If a building is found wholly vacant, i.e. if nobody is living in it at the time of house listing and it is not used for any other purpose, it should also be marked on the EA map and numbered. In this case, write the word \"Vacant\" above the box marked on the EA map for this building. In Form A, Columns 1, 2 and 13 only may be filled-in for a vacant building leaving the other columns blank. In Column 1, line number may be entered and in Column 2, building number may be written for the vacant building. In the Remarks column (Column 13), the word \"vacant\" should be written. If a residential or partly residential building is found locked because the household members have gone on travel, then it should not be treated as \"vacant\". In this case also, Columns 1, 2 and 13 only may be filled-in and other columns may be left blank. The fact that the occupants have gone on a travel should be noted in the \"Remarks\" column as \"Building locked?occupants travelling\".\n\nColumn 7: Household No.\n\n39. As already defined, a \"household\" is a group of persons who commonly live together and would take their meals from a common kitchen unless the exigencies of work prevented any of them from doing so. It may be made up of related or un-related persons or of mixed type. A cook or a servant living in the house of his employer and taking his food there, is part of that household. A hostel where a number of unrelated persons live together is an institutional household provided it has a common kitchen. So also is a jail.\n\n40. There should be a household number in Column 7 since you have noted in Column 6 that the building is wholly or partly residential.\n\n41. There may be more than one household in a building as already pointed out. Each household in one building should be given a separate number (01, 02, etc.). You will get an idea of the numbering of the buildings and households located in them from the following:\n\n[p.17]\n\nEx 1: Building No. 009 having one household\n\nbuilding/structure number = 009\n\nhousehold number = 01\n\nEx 2: Building No. 009 having two households\n\nbuilding/structure number = 009\n\nhousehold number = 01\n\nhousehold number = 02\n\nEx 2: Building No. 009 having two households\n\nbuilding/structure number = 009\n\nhousehold number = 01\n\nhousehold number = 02\n\nhousehold number = 03\n\nIf a building contains more than one household, the building number should not be repeated in Column 2 on the subsequent lines (please see example above). Also, the predominant construction materials of building (Columns 3 to 5) and purpose of building (Column 6) need not be filled-in on subsequent lines once these particulars have been entered against the first household of the building.\n\nColumns 8 and 9: Particulars of Head of Household\n\n42. Columns 8 and 9 are required to be filled in, only in respect of the head of household. You have to write the name and sex of the head of household.\n\nDefinition of Head of Household\n\n43. The head of household for census purposes is a person who is recognized as such in the household. He or she is generally the person who bears the chief responsibility for the management of the household and takes decisions on behalf of the household. The head of the household need not necessarily be the eldest male member, but may be a female member or a younger member of either sex. You need not enter into any long argument about it but record the name of the person who is recognized by the household as its head. In the case of an absentee de jure \"Head\", the person on whom the responsibility of the managing the affairs of the household falls at the time of house listing, should be regarded as the Head.\n\nColumn 8: Name\n\n44. The name of the head of each household should be written in this column. In the case of Institutional households, such as hostels, residential hotels, jails, pagodas etc., where the head of institutional household can be recognized by designation, such as, hostel warden, jailer, chief monk,\n\n[p.18]\n\nmanager etc., you may enter this designation in this column after writing the name of the Institution. If there is no such designation, write the name of the recognized head of Institution.\n\n45. In the case of institutional households, please write \"I\" within brackets after the name or designation of the head in this column. Example: Kolab II School Hostel, Manager (I); Mr Srey Rotha (I). Please also write \"Institutional Household\" in the Remarks column.\n\nColumn 9: Sex (1: Male, 2: Female)\n\n46. If the head of the household is a male write 1. If female, write 2 in this column. For eunuchs and hermaphrodites, you may write 1 in the column.\n\nColumns 10 to 12: Number of Persons Usually Living in the Household\n\n47. Enter the number of males usually residing in the household in Column 10, number of females in Column 11 and total number of persons in Column 12 (total of Columns 10 and 11). Please note that the purpose of ascertaining these figures is to have a preliminary idea of the usual residents in the household. Casual visitors should be excluded as they will be considered at their respective places of normal residence. Persons like household helper, visitor or guest living and having their meals with the family are also considered as usual members of the household if they have been living with the household for six months or more, or if they have no other place of residence. Usual residents absent for six months or more should be excluded from the household in which they usually reside.\n\n47.1 After entering the figures in these three columns, you must arithmetically check whether number of males in Column 10 plus number of females in Column 11 is equal to number of persons in Column 12.\n\nColumn 13: Remarks\n\n48. This will provide space for any useful information about the building, or household. As already mentioned in the Instructions for filling in Column 8, write \"Institutional Household\" in case of such household. If the building is vacant, write vacant here as already mentioned. If the building is locked and the occupants have travelled, you may record this in the Remarks column as already stated. This space may be also suitably used to explain Code 8 in Columns 3 and 4 or Code 7 in Column 5, if necessary.\n\nGeneral\n\n49. Each page of the house list of the EA should be numbered continuously as 1, 2, 3, etc. The page number should be given in the place allotted on the right hand top corner of the house list. On every page of the\n\n[p.19]\n\nhouse list for EA, the total number of pages used for EA should be given in the space provided on the right hand top corner.\n\n50. The total number of households in Column 7 of the house list should be counted and written in the box for total under this column in each page. The figures of males, females and persons in Columns 10, 11 and 12 may be totaled and given for each page. In a separate sheet called House list Summary (Census Form 1), specimen of which is given in Appendix IV you have to copy totals of each of these columns from each page and strike the grand totals for EA.\n\n50.1 It is important to check whether the figures entered in the House list Summary are arithmetically correct. The sum of number of males in Column 3 and the number of females in Column 4 should be equal to the number of persons in Column 5. This should be checked for every line and Total line of House list Summary.\n\n51. The enumerator should write his/her name and sign all the pages of the house list and also record the date in the space provided.\n\n[p. 20]\n\nCHAPTER - 3\n\nFilling in of Form B: Household Questionnaire\n\nGeneral\n\n52. Form B Household Questionnaire (Appendix II) will be canvassed in all households in your EA. You must take Form A along with you and identify each household and do the enumeration in Form B.\n\nReference Time is 00:00 hours of March 3, 2008\n\n53. The reference time for the 2008 Census is 00:00 hours of Monday, March 3, 2008. This means that the 2008 Census is expected to provide a snap shot of the population in the households in the EA as it exists at 00:00 hours of March 3, 2008. In other words, the population count relates to this reference time. As you will agree, it is not possible to ascertain the particulars of every individual at this fixed point of time. Therefore, the enumeration is spread over eleven days beginning on March 3, 2008 and ending on March 13, 2008. During these days, information is collected of persons present in households at 00:00 hours of March 3, 2008 (Census Night). Hence the entire enumeration relates to this reference time. Note that only persons alive in household at 00:00 hours of this day should be enumerated. Remember that all questions you ask must relate to Census Night unless you have specific instructions otherwise in this manual (e.g. questions on economic characteristics). Please also note that for House listing no such reference time is fixed since it is only a general preliminary inquiry. But for the Census (when Form B Household Questionnaire will be canvassed), a reference time is fixed, since census is expected to provide the population figures as at that time.\n\nImportant Note\n\n54. Form B will be filled-in for all households in your EA. All households include normal or regular households, institutional households, homeless households, boat populations and transient populations. Form A will help you in identifying each normal or institutional household. Please note that persons belonging to diplomatic corps will not be included in the census count.\n\n54.1 You may come across one or more new households which were not included in Form A, either in buildings listed in Form A during house listing or in buildings not noticed during house listing and hence not listed in Form A. In each of these situations, you should enumerate the new households for filling in Form B Household Questionnaire. Remember here the basic principle of the census that all persons present in all households in your EA on Census Night should be enumerated without mission or duplication.\n\n[p.21]\n\n54.2 Before enumerating each of the new households as mentioned in the previous paragraph, you should update Form A House list. This may be done by including building number, household number and other particulars of these cases under the heading \"Additional Households noticed during Enumeration\" at the end of Form A without disturbing the existing line numbers. This is illustrated in Appendix V.\n\n54.3 A building which was locked during house listing may not be locked during the census enumeration. You have to enumerate the household in this building. You may up-date Form A in this case as follows: If there is only one household in such a building you may fill in Columns 3 to 12 on the line on which the building number is already entered. Columns 1 to 2 and 13 should have been filled-in for this building in Form A during house listing. If there are more than one household in that building, you may fill in particulars of second, third etc., household at the end of Form A. You may cancel the words \"Building locked-occupants travelling\" originally recorded in the Remarks column (Column 13) against this building number.\n\n54.4 A building which was vacant during house listing may not be vacant during the census enumeration. You have to enumerate the household in this building. You may up-date Form A in this case as follows: If there is only one household in such a building you may fill in Columns 3 to 12 on the line on which the building number is already entered. Columns 1 to 2 and 13 should have been filled-in for this building in Form A during house listing. If there are more than one household in that building, you may fill in particulars of second, third etc., household at the end of Form A. You may cancel the words \"vacant\" originally recorded in the Remarks column (Column 13) against this building number.\n\n54.5 The page total of Form A and House list Summary entries need not be corrected consequent on listing additional households in Form A during the enumeration stage in situations explained in Paragraphs 54.2 to 54.4.\n\n54.6 Instructions for the enumeration of normal households are given in this Chapter hereinafter. Instructions for enumeration of Institutional Households are given in Chapter 4. Instructions for enumeration of homeless households, boat population and transient population are given in Chapter 5.\n\n54.7 It is possible that between Census Night and the time of enumeration the composition of population in some households may have changed. If somebody had died after 00:00 hours of March 3, 2008, include him or her in the count as that person was living in that household at that point of time. If a baby was born after 00:00 hours of March 3, 2007, you should not enumerate the baby who did not exist at 00:00 hours of March 3, 2008. Visitors are enumerated in a normal or regular household only if they spent Census Night in that household.\n\nSpecimen Form of Questionnaire\n\n[p.22]\n\n55. Specimen of Form B Household Questionnaire is given as Appendix II. This form should be used to enumerate individuals in households in your EA. This will be done in a second round starting from March 3, 2008.\n\nInstructions for filling in Form B Household Questionnaire Part I: Identification and Population Particulars\n\nIdentification Particulars\n\n56. Fill in name and code of Khet/Krong, Srok/Khand, Khum/Sangkat and Phum/Mondol as you have already done for Form A House list. Enumeration Area Number also will be filled in the same way. Copy from Form A, the Building No. and Household No. on the top of the form. It will be advisable to fill in the Identification Particulars (except Building No., Household No. and Name of Head of Household) in the blank forms before your commence enumeration as it will save time during your rounds.\n\nType of Household/Population\n\n57. Give the suitable code in the box provided for this purpose. For a normal household, give Code 1.\n\nWhat to do when two or more Questionnaires are used for a Household?\n\n58. There is a provision on each questionnaire to enumerate 10 persons. If you have to enumerate more than 10 persons in a household, continue enumeration on a new questionnaire. This new questionnaire is in continuation of the first one and must be treated as such. Remember that whenever you use more than one questionnaire for any household, you must write Household No. ... (Continued) on the right hand top of the first page of second and subsequent questionnaires. You should fill in Identification Particulars in continuation questionnaires also. You should write in the square provided at left hand bottom of the first page (Part 1) of the first questionnaire, the total number of the questionnaires used for the household. You must clip or pin together all questionnaires of the household concerned.\n\n58.1 Serial numbers are printed in Column 1 of Statement 1.1 and Statement 1.2 of Part 1 and Column 1 of Part 2, like 1, 2, 3 ... 0. The last serial number in the first page may be made 10 by writing 1 before 0 for the tenth person. In the next continuation questionnaire, you may continue numbering by putting the digit 1 before the numbers already printed on the second questionnaire to form 11, 12, 13 etc., and for the last one you have to\n\n[p.23]\n\nput 2 before 0 to make it 20. When you use a third questionnaire, you should put 2 before the existing numbers to form 21, 22, 23 ........and so on.\n\nName of Head of Household\n\n59. Head of Household has already been defined. You may find his/her name against Household No. concerned in Column 8 of Form A: House list. You should record that here. If there is a change in the name of head of household between house listing and now, record the new name.\n\nFilling in of Statements 1.1, 1.2 and 1.3\n\n60. For filling in these statements, please carefully read the following instructions: Usual members may be divided into two categories: (i) those who slept in the house occupied by the household on Census Night i.e. those who were present on Census Night and (ii) those who were away and so were absent on Census Night. Please note that persons on night duty (e.g. doctors, nurses, policemen, watchmen, prison wardens etc.) who would have normally slept in the house but for going on night duty should be treated as usual members present in household on Census Night.\n\n61. Visitors (i.e. guests of any member of household) who slept in the house on Census Night are called visitors to household present on Census Night.\n\n62. In Statements 1.1, 1.2 and 1.3 of Form B Part I, you have to fill in some particulars of usual members of household present on Census Night, visitors to household present on Census Night and usual members of household absent on Census Night respectively.\n\nImportant Note\n\n63. You may use the number of persons usually living in the household recorded in Columns 10, 11 and 12 of the House list for guidance. But please remember that those figures related to all usual members of the household in general. You have to contact the head of the household or any responsible member of the household and obtain information for filling in the schedule as per instructions contained in the following pages. You should arrange the timing of your visit to households in your EA in such a way that you would be able to meet the head of household or any responsible member of each household. Sometimes you may find that all the members of a household had gone out for a few hours for shopping, work, study etc. leaving the building locked. In such cases you should leave a message for the household concerned that you will again visit the household for census enumeration (giving time and date) and requesting them to be present at that time. For this purpose you may use Call Back Cards (Appendix VII).\n\n[p.24]\n\nStatement 1.1 Usual Members Present on Census Night\n\n64. In this statement you should list out all usual members of household present on Census Night. You should write down first the name of the head of household (refer definition given earlier in paragraph 43 Chapter 2). If the head of the household was absent during the reference night, find out who was responsible for the household in the absence of head of household and record his or her name, provided this person slept in the household on Census Night.\n\n65. In entering the names in Statement 1.1 it would be better if some system is followed. After entering the name and other particulars of the head of household, you should cover the near relations such as wife or husband of the head of household, sons and daughters, each son's wife and children, each daughter's husband and children, then other relations such as brothers, sisters, mother, father, etc., of the head of the household, then domestic servants, if any etc. Such a system of listing and entering of particulars will ensure that omissions are avoided, particularly of small children. It will also help in cross-checking replies regarding age.\n\n66. A word of caution: - You must ask probing questions regarding relations such as unmarried sisters, parents, domestic servants and children. Otherwise, the head of the household may not indicate that there are such persons as usual members of the household present on the Census Night. Please make repeated enquiries about infants and very young children because they are often liable to be left out of the count.\n\nColumn 1: Serial Number\n\n67. A serial number has to be given for each person using the numbers already printed.\n\nColumn 2: Full Name\n\n68. This question hardly calls for any explanation. The names of persons starting with the head of household should be entered here. The names you put down should be such that if a second visit is paid to the house during or after the final enumeration, the persons to whom the names refer can be easily identified.\n\nBabies who have not been named\n\n68.1 Occasionally you will come across babies who were born before Census Night but who haven't been named by the time you call to enumerate. In such cases, write down \"Baby\" before the family name. For example, if the newly born baby's father's name is Savongz you should put\n\ndown Baby Savongz.\n\n[p.25]\n\nPersons with identical names\n\n68.2 You may also come across households where two or more persons are known by same family name (e.g. Meas). In such cases you must record also the names by which they are distinguished in the household and by neighbors and friends (e.g. Meas Savongz and Meas Savath).\n\nColumn 3: Relationship to Head of Household\n\n69. In this column you will have to record the relationship to head of household in full, in words. The first person to be recorded is the head of household. In the case of the head write 'head'. For others write the full relationship. Do not use words like 'nephew', 'niece', 'uncle' or 'aunt', but state whether the person is the brother's or sister's son or daughter (for nephew or niece) or father's or mother's brother (for uncle), or father's or mother's sister (for aunt). Son or daughter will include adopted son or adopted daughter or step son/daughter. For brother-in-law, write wife's brother or sister's husband as the case may be. For grandson, write son's son or daughter's son as the case may be. In the case of boarders or domestic servants/cooks, etc., who are enumerated as members of the household though unrelated, write boarder or domestic servant/cook, as the case may be.\n\nColumn 4: Sex\n\n70. Record Code 1 for male and 2 for female. It is important to ask the sex of the persons when information is being given to you by a third person. Bear in mind that some names can be misleading in this respect. For example, Vichet or Socheat can be used for a male as well as a female. For eunuchs and hermaphrodites write 1.\n\nStatement 1.2: Visitors Present on Census Night\n\n71. You have to record in Statement 1.2 of Form B Part 1, the full name, relationship to head of household and sex of every visitor who was present in the household on Census Night. Follow the instructions mentioned above for filling Columns 1 to 4. You are also required to write in Columns 5 or 6, the usual residence of the visitor. If the usual residence of the visitor is within Cambodia write the name of district to which that place belongs with name of province within brackets in Column 5 and put a dash (-) in Column 6. If the visitor usually resides in another country, put a dash (-) in Column 5 and write the name of that country in Column 6. If no visitor was present in the household on Census Night, score out neatly Statement 1.2.\n\nStatement 1.3: Usual Members Absent on Census Night\n\n[p.26]\n\n72. The entries in Statement 1.3 are restricted to usual members of the household who were absent from the house on census night. Note that only five lines have been provided in this column. If there are more than five persons to be entered here, you must use a continuation questionnaire and suitably enter the serial numbers.\n\n72.1 In statement 1.3 you should, in addition to full name, relationship to head of household and sex, record age, location on census night and the duration of absence of every usual member of the household who was absent on Census Night. For filling in the name, sex and relationship to head or temporary head, follow the instructions mentioned above. For filling the age, follow the instructions given for filling Column 5: Age, of Form B Household Questionnaire Part 2: Individual Particulars (paragraphs 84, 84.1 and 84.2 in this Chapter).\n\n72.2 The \"Location on Census Night\" (Column 6 or 7) refers to the place where the absent usual member spent census night. If the location or place where the absent usual member of the household was residing on Census Night was within Cambodia, give the name of the district to which that place belongs with the name of the province in brackets in Column 6. If it is another country, write only the name of the country in Column 7. If these details are not known, write \"Not Known\" under Column 6 or 7.\n\n72.3 In Column 8, you are expected to write, in completed months, how long he/she was absent up to Census Night. For example, if the person has been away for two months and three weeks, write 2 in the space provided. If he/she was absent for less than one month, write down 0.\n\n72.4 If the usual head of household was absent on Census Night, his or her name should be entered on the first line in Statement 1.3. Remember, however, to indicate in the relationship column the relationship of this person to the temporary head entered in Statement 1.1. Thus, you should never enter 'Head' in relationship column in Statement 1.3, but specify whether this absent person is the husband, father, brother, mother, etc., of the temporary head. If no usual member of household was absent on Census Night, neatly score out Statement 1.3.\n\nTotal Number of Persons in Statements 1.1 and 1.2\n\n73. On the right-hand side of Statement 1.3 are boxes in which you should put down the total number of persons (male plus female) in Statements 1.1 and 1.2. If there is no entry in Statement 1.2, record \"0\" in the box for \"Total Number of Persons in Statement 1.2\". Regarding the total number of persons in Statement 1.3, you need not do anything. It may be used later in the office.\n\nTotal of Statement 1.1 and Statement 1.2\n\n[p.27]\n\n74. One box has been provided for recording the total number of persons in Statement 1.1 and Statement 1.2. You are expected to add the number of persons in Statement 1.1 and Statement 1.2 and put the total in the box concerned.\n\n75. If you use more than one questionnaire for a household you should add up the number of persons listed under Statement 1.1 and Statement 1.2 on each questionnaire and put the total in the appropriate boxes of the first questionnaire for the household. The boxes on the second and subsequent questionnaires should be left blank.\n\n76. You have to give your name, signature and date at the appropriate place.\n\nInstructions for Filling in Form B Household Questionnaire Part 2: Individual Particulars\n\nThe Layout of Form B Household Questionnaire Part 2\n\n77. This part of the questionnaire is divided into columns and rows. There are columns numbered 1,2,3....23. Each column refers specifically to a questionnaire item which is clearly stated at the head of the column.\n\n77.1 There are ten lines. Each line is reserved for one person. This means that if you are writing down the particulars of one person, you must use one line only starting from the left and moving along the line to the right.\n\n77.2 Remember that you have to fill in Part 2 only for usual members and visitors (i.e. persons listed in Statement 1.1 and Statement 1.2 of Part 1) who were present in the household on Census Night. Do not include here usual members who were absent on Census Night (i.e. persons listed in Statement 1.3 of Part 1).\n\nInstructions for Filling in Columns 1 to 23 of Form B: Part 2\n\n78. You have to collect information in Part 2 for all persons mentioned in Statement 1.1 and Statement 1.2 of Part 1. Some of the following questions have been answered in Part 1. Therefore, there will be no need to ask these questions again. In such cases, all you have to do is to copy the information in the appropriate columns.\n\nColumn 1: Serial No.\n\n79. A Serial Number has to be given for each line (i.e. for each person in the household starting from the head of household). For your convenience, the serial numbers have been printed in this column which you may use suitably. Please check that the last serial number given is equal to the total\n\n[p.28]\n\nnumber of persons in Statements 1.1 and 1.2 given in the thick square at the bottom right-hand on the first page (Part 1).\n\nColumns 2 to 4:\n\n80. The information in these columns should be first entered from Statements 1.1 and 1.2 of Part 1 before proceeding further to fill in other columns for each person.\n\nColumn 2: Full Name\n\n81. Write in the spaces provided the names of all respondents in the household (as in Statement 1.1 and Statement 1.2). First, the names in Statement 1.1, in that order, may be copied. This may be followed by the names in Statement 1.2 in that order.\n\nColumn 3: Relationship\n\n82. Based on the information already collected in Column 3 of Statements 1.1 and 1.2, give the code for relationship to head of household for each person. Codes for relationship are provided on the questionnaire itself below Column 3. Read the relationship and select the proper Code. Note that Code 1 is for head of household. Head of household will always be the first person enumerated in the household. Code 2 should be given to the wife of a male head of household or to the husband of a female head of household. Code 3 should be given to the son or daughter of the head of household. Code 4 should be given to the father or mother of the head of household. Code 5 should be given to the grandson or granddaughter of head of household. All other relatives of the head of household should be given Code 6. You should take sufficient care to avoid wrong coding of relationship to head of household. For example, sister's son should not be coded as son (Code 3) because the word son is there. The correct Code in this case is 6. Non-relatives of the head of household should be given Code 7.\n\nColumn 4: Sex\n\n83. This column may be filled in by copying the information from Column 4 of Statements 1.1 and 1.2 for the persons concerned.\n\nColumn 5: Age\n\n84. The age of every person must be stated in completed years only, as on March 3, 2008. For those who know their birthdays, the age to be recorded is the age at last birthday. \"Age in completed years only\" means that all the ages must be recorded in full years, discarding fractions of years and months.\n\n84.1 For instance, 15 years 11 months should be written down as 15. Do not write down months. Only years are required. The age of all infants who are less than one year old should be recorded as \"00\". In this case, you are requested to make sure that infants of the household, even if they are one day or\n\n[p.29]\n\nless than one day old on Census Night, are invariably enumerated. It is again pointed out that you should take all precautions to enumerate children (less than age 14) and infants (less than 1 year). Unless you ask probing questions they are likely to be omitted. This is a very important instruction that you should always bear in mind. Most of the households have the Household Book. The date of birth of each person enumerated may be obtained from it. However, the date of birth has to be confirmed by the respondent before using it to calculate his/her age.\n\n84.2 What to do when a person does not know his/her age?\n\nFor such a person use any of the following methods to estimate his/her age:\n\n(1) You may ask him/her to state the year of birth according to the animal calendar. Based on the information furnished and using the conversion table given to you, record the age in completed years.\n\n(2)\n\n(i) Ask him/her to name any historical event (preferably a local one) which he/she has been told as having occurred around the time of his/her birth. You may be given a list of historical events for this purpose and you may suggest a suitable event from this list also.\n\n(ii) Ask him/her to give you an indication of how old he/she was when that historical event occurred.\n\n(iii) Then use this information to work out his/her age. For example, if a respondent tells you that he/she was about 20 years old when Cambodia attained Independence, his or her age may be about 20 + 54 (November 9, 1953 to March 3, 2008) = 74 years.\n\n(3) Sometimes the age can be ascertained with reference to the age of another person of a known age, who may be living in the same household or in the neighboring household or that of a well-known person of the village such as the village chief.\n\n(4) Only as a last resort you should estimate a person's age from his/her physical features. If you are obtaining information about an absent person from a third person, then obviously you have to rely on the information supplied by the third person in estimating the age in respect to the person who is absent. You should not leave this column blank under any circumstances.\n\nColumn 6: Marital Status\n\n85. Codes are provided in the column heading itself. You have to ask this delicate question carefully and record the appropriate code numbers according to the answers given. Record Code 1 for Never married, i.e. for those who have never entered into any form of marital union. Record Code 2\n\n[p.30]\n\nfor Married, i.e. currently married, 3 for Widowed, 4 for Divorced and 5 for Separated.\n\n86. The category \"Married\" will include those persons who are contractually married but not yet living as a man and wife. Even if a marriage is disputed in the neighborhood, write Code 2 if the person concerned says he or she is married and is in a stable de facto union. The category \"Separated\" will include both legal and de facto separations. Persons who were widowed or divorced but have remarried must be recorded as married.\n\nColumn 7: Mother Tongue\n\n87. The mother tongue of a person is the language spoken in childhood by the person's mother to the person. If the mother died in infancy, the language mainly spoken in the person's home in childhood will be the mother tongue. In case of infants and deaf mutes, the language usually spoken by the mother should be recorded. In case of doubts, the language mainly spoken in the household may be recorded.\n\n87.1 You have to use the following codes for recording answer to this question:\n\nCode Mother Tongue:\n\n01: Khmer\n\n02: Vietnamese\n\n03: Chinese\n\n04: Laos\n\n05: Thai\n\n06: French\n\n07: English\n\n08: Korean\n\n09: Japanese\n\n10: Chaaraay\n\n11: Chaam\n\n12: Kaavaet\n\n13: Klueng\n\n14: Kuoy\n\n15: Krueng\n\n16: Lun\n\n17: Phnong\n\n18: Proav\n\n19: Tumpoon\n\n20: Stieng\n\n21: Cha Ong\n\n22: Kraol\n\n23: Radaer\n\n24: Lmoon\n\n25: Mel\n\n26: Khogn\n\n27: Por\n\n28: Suay\n\n29: Any other mother tongue which has to be specified\n\nRecord the code in blank space and not in the shaded boxes.\n\n87.2 Please note the instructions given below: You should tell the respondent that the information required here is the mother tongue and not any other language spoken. It should also be made clear that this information is required purely for statistical purposes only.\n\n(i) However, you are bound to record the language as returned by the person as his/her mother tongue and you should not enter into any argument with him/her and try to record any language other than what is returned.\n\n(ii) If you have reasons to suspect that in your area, the mother tongue is not being truthfully returned, you should record the mother tongue returned through code and make a report to your supervisor for verification.\n\n[p.31]\n\n(iii) It is possible that the mother tongue may be different for different persons in a household. It is, therefore, necessary to ask every person about his/her mother tongue.\n\nColumn 8: Religion\n\n88. Record the appropriate code number for the religion to which the respondent says he/she belongs. There is no need to verify this. You must accept whatever answer is given. For those claiming to belong to religions that fall under other categories, record Code 4 and specify the reported religion, e.g. 4 Hindu. For a person who says that he/she has no religion, write 4 No religion.\n\nColumn 9: Birth Place\n\n89. If a person reports to have been born in this village, record Code 1 in the blank space (not in the shaded boxes which are reserved for coding in office). Persons reporting to have been \"born in this village\" are those born in the same village in which you are conducting your enumeration. The birth place of a person is the place of usual residence of the person's mother at the time of birth. For example, for a person born in (a) a hospital or maternity home outside the usual place of residence of the mother or (b) mother's village or (c) some other place where the mother had gone for a short visit, the birthplace of this person will be the place in which the mother normally lives and not the place of the hospital, the mother's village or place of visit. If however, the mother's length of stay outside her place of usual residence was six months or more or the mother had the intention of staying in the new place for six months or more, the \"actual place of physical birth\" will be considered as the birth place of the person in question. For example, suppose Bossadine, who normally resides with her husband in Bak Kheng, went to Kandal Koh to deliver her child in her mother's house and returned within six months -- the birthplace of the child will be Bak Kheng and not Kandal Koh.\n\n89.1 If however, Bossadine stays in Kandal Koh for six months or more, then the birthplace of her child will be Kandal Koh and not Bak Kheng.\n\n89.2 For those persons reporting to have been born outside the village where you are conducting your enumeration, record the name of the district in which the village of birth falls and also write the name of the province of that district within brackets. For those born outside Cambodia, write the name of the country of birth.\n\nColumn 10: Previous Residence\n\n90. In the blank space (not shaded boxes), record 1 if the respondent lived in the village where enumeration is being conducted continuously since birth (except for shifting to another place outside the village of enumeration for a purely temporary stay) and skip to Column 13. If a person was usually residing in another village immediately before he/she came to the present\n\n[p.32]\n\nvillage where he/she is enumerated, the earlier village is the person's previous residence. If the person had lived earlier in more than one village, the immediate previous residence of the person is what we are interested in. For example, for a person enumerated in village who A had lived earlier in village B and before that in village C, his/her previous residence is village B and not village C. Write the name of the district of previous residence and also write the name of the province of that district within brackets. If the respondent is reported to have resided outside Cambodia, write the name of the country. It is important to note that even if a person was born at the place of enumeration but had shifted subsequently to another village for work or for studies, and had come back again to the place of enumeration, he/she should be considered as having had another place of residence prior to his/her enumeration here.\n\nColumn 11: Duration of Stay\n\n91. The question on duration of stay refers to the duration of stay in the village of enumeration since coming from the last previous residence. This question, \"how long have you lived in this village?\" is to be administered only if the answer in Column 10 is that the place of last residence was another village in Cambodia or in a country outside Cambodia. In other words, the answer in Column 10 is not Code 1. Duration of stay should be recorded in Column 11 using the codes for Column 11 given on the questionnaire itself. If the answer in Column 10 is Code 1, put a dash (-) in Column 11.\n\n91.1 If a person is reported to have resided in a village (since coming from last previous residence) for less than 1 year, record 00; if from 1 year to less than 2 years, record 01; if from 2 years to less than 3 years record 02 and so on. For 98 years and over, record 98 only.\n\nColumn 12: Reason for Migration\n\n92. \"Migration\", means moving to the place where you are enumerating from another village (or another country) which was the last previous residence. For persons to whom you have given a code other than 1 in Column 10 and for whom you have entered a duration of stay code in Column 11, you have to record a reason for migration by giving one of the codes applicable to the person concerned from the list of codes for Column 12 given below the column. For a person to whom you have given Code 1 in Column 10, put a dash (-) in Column 12. The reasons given are simple and easily understandable. Code 05 (Family moved) needs an explanation. If a member of a family had to move to the place of enumeration from a previous residence because the entire family moved, this code has to be given. For example, if Ratha migrated because his place of work is transferred, give Code 01 for him. For his wife and children, who had to also move with him, the reason for migration is \"Family moved\" (05) and not \"Transfer of work place\" (01). However, if his wife or son or daughter gives a separate reason for moving to this place like \"in search of employment\" or \"education\" you have to assign the appropriate code to him/her. Give Code 09 (Repatriation or Return after displacement) to a person who was repatriated by an official agency or to a person who returned to his/her village after having left earlier\n\n[p.33]\n\ndue to internal disturbances or political reasons. Children who are orphans after their parents' death may be adopted by somebody or may be taken care of by some relatives. This may result in the orphaned children moving from one place to another. In such cases, give Code 10. For any reason of migration other than the first eleven listed, give Code 12 and write down the reason in the column itself. Please note that Code 12 should be given only if the reason for migration is not covered by any of the Codes 01 to 11. For instance, if a person had been repatriated, you must give Code 09 in his/her case and not write \"12 (repatriated)\".\n\nColumn 13: Literacy\n\n93. The definition of literacy is the ability to read and write with understanding in a language. A person is literate when he/she can both read and write a simple message in a language or dialect. A person who cannot both read and write a simple message is considered illiterate. Also to be considered as illiterate is that person who is capable of reading only his/her own name or numbers, as well as persons who can read but not write, or vice versa. For the present census all children of the age of 6 years or less (i.e. completed age 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 ) should be treated as illiterate even if the child is going to a school and may have picked up reading and writing a few odd words in a language.\n\n93.1 A person who knows how to read and write, but at the time of the census he/she can no longer read and write due to some physical defects or illness, is still considered literate. An example of this is an aged person who knows how to read and write but can no longer perform these activities due to poor eyesight. Disabled persons who can read and write through any means such as Braille system for the blind, are considered literate.\n\n93.2 Having described the concept of literacy, the following instructions are given for filling in Cols. 13 (a) and 13 (b). For children aged 6 or less enter Code 2 in Col. 13 (a) and Code 1 in Col. 13 (b).\n\nColumn 13(a): Literacy in Khmer Language\n\n93.3 The person aged 7 and above may be asked whether he/she can read and write with understanding in Khmer language. If the answer is Yes, record 1 in Col. 13 (a). If it is No, record 2 in that column. If you are not sure whether the person can read and write, you may show the person the census instruction manual and ask him to read a line or ask him to write a simple sentence in Khmer.\n\nColumn 13 (b) Literacy in another language\n\n[p.34]\n\n93.4 The person who said Yes in Col. 13 (a) may be asked whether he/she can read and write with understanding in any other language i.e. whether he/she is literate in one more language (other than Khmer).\n\n93.5 If he/she says \"No\", record Code 1 for him/her in Col. 13 (b). If he/she tells the name of a language give the code of that language in Col. 13 (b) from the list given under the column. If it is any language other than the six languages with codes, give Code 8 and specify that language.\n\n93.6. The person who said \"No\" (Code 2) for Col. 13 (a) may be asked to tell the language in which he/she can read and write with understanding. If he/she says again, \"No,\" give Code 1 for him/her in Col. 13 (b). If he/she tells the name of the language in which he/she can read and write with understanding, give the code of that language in Col. 13 (b) for him/her according to the same list of codes. If it is any language other than the six codes, enter Code 8 and specify that language.\n\n93.7 In both the cases mentioned above if the respondent is literate in more than one language, only one language is to be recorded, that being the best of the languages in which he is literate.\n\nColumn 14: Full Time Education\n\n94. Full-time education refers to education in an educational institution like Primary School, Secondary School, College, etc.\n\nColumn 14 (a): Has the person attended School/Educational Institution?\n\n95. Please note that this question applies to both literate and illiterate persons, i.e. irrespective of answers in Col. 13 (a) and (b). This also applies to children aged 6 and below. The answer to this question may be recorded as follows:\n\n(a) Never: Record 1 if the person has never at any time received full-time education.\n\n(b) Now: Record 2 if the person is still receiving full-time education at the time of the Census.\n\n(c) Past: Record 3 if the person received full-time education in the past and is no longer receiving it.\n\nNote that it is possible that a person who is literate (Code 1 in Col. 13 (a)), or Code 2 in Col. 13 (a) with one of the Codes 2 to 8 in Col. 13 (b) ), had never attended any school or educational institution at all and therefore, has to be given Code 1 in Column 14 (a).\n\nColumn 14 (b): What is the Highest Grade Completed?\n\n[p.35]\n\n96. Enter dash (-) in the two sub-Columns in the case of a person who has never attended a school/educational institution (Code 1 in Column 14 (a)). Categories of educational levels have been provided for recording the highest grade completed in the school, college or any other educational institution attended by the respondents. A last category, \"other (specify)\" (Code 20), has been included to cater for other educational categories not mentioned. In general, you may check whether the educational level of a person is consistent with his/her age. For example, a boy or girl of age 8 could not have completed class 11. If any such inconsistency is noted, please make probing questions and ascertain the correct answer.\n\nColumn 15: Physical/Mental Disability, if any\n\n97. This question is a sensitive one and should be canvassed without offending the feelings of the respondent. The purpose of this question is to elicit the information of whether the respondent has any physical/mental disability. If he/she has no such disability put (0) in the two sub-columns. The five types of disabilities identified for census purpose are given below:\n\n97.1 In Seeing: A person who cannot see at all (has no perception of light) or has blurred vision even with the help of glasses or contact lenses will be considered as having disability in \"Seeing\" or visually disabled, and Code 1 will be entered under this question. A person with proper vision only in one eye will also be treated as visually disabled. You may come across a situation where a person may have blurred vision and had no occasion to test whether his/her eye-sight would improve by using spectacles. Such persons would be treated as visually disabled.\n\n97.2 In Speech: A person will be recorded as having speech disability if he/she is mute. Similarly, for a person whose speech is not understood by a listener of normal comprehension and hearing, he/she will be treated as having speech disability and Code 2 will be entered. Persons who stammer but whose speech is comprehensible will not be classified as disabled by speech.\n\n97.3 In Hearing: A person who cannot hear at all (deaf) or can hear only loud sounds will be considered as having hearing disability and in such cases Code 3 will be entered. A person who is able to hear, using a hearing aid will not be considered as disabled under this category. If a person cannot hear through one ear but his/her other ear is functioning normally, he/she should be considered as having hearing disability.\n\n97.4 In Movement: A person who lacks limbs or is unable to use the limbs normally will be considered having movement disability and Code 4 will be entered here. Absence of a part of a limb like a finger or a toe will not be considered as disability. However, absence of all the fingers or toes or a thumb will make a person disabled by movement. If any part of the body is deformed, the person will also be treated as disabled and covered under this category. A person who cannot move herself/himself or without the aid of another person or without the aid of a stick, wheelchair, etc., will be treated as disabled under this category. Similarly, a person would be\n\n[p.36]\n\ntreated as disabled in movement if he/she is unable to move or lift or pick up any small article placed near him/her. A person who may not be able to move normally because of problems of joints like arthritis, and has to invariably limp while moving, will also be considered to have movement disability.\n\n97.5 Mental: A person who lacks comprehension appropriate to his/her age will be considered as mentally disabled. This would not mean that if a person is not able to comprehend his/her studies appropriate to his/her age and is failing his/her quality examination is mentally disabled. Mentally retarded and insane persons would be treated as mentally disabled. A mentally disabled person may generally depend on his/her family members for performing daily routines. It should be left to the respondent to report whether the member of the household is mentally disabled and no tests are required to be applied by you to judge the member's disability.\n\n97.6 If a person is disabled, enter only one of the five disabilities for that person, in codes, as given below:\n\n1: In Seeing\n\n2: In Speech\n\n3: In Hearing\n\n4: In Movement\n\n5: Mental\n\n97.7 Please note that a person may have two or more types of disability but only one of these is to be recorded. In such cases you will have to leave it to the respondent to decide as to the type of disability he/she wants the member of his/her household to be classified into. The disability of a person will be decided with reference to the date of enumeration. Persons with temporary disability on the date of enumeration will not be considered as disabled. For example, when a person's movement may have been restricted because of some temporary injury and he/she is likely to return to his normal state after sometime, such a person will not be treated as disabled.\n\n97.8 The code has to be given in Column 15 (a) \"Since birth\" if the person has the disability from his/her birth. In other words, he/she was born with this disability. If the person got this disability after birth enter the disability code in Column 15 (b) \"After birth\".\n\nColumns 16 to 21 on Economic Characteristics of Population\n\n98. These columns relate to the economic characteristics of population both male and female. Information proposed to be collected on economic characteristics of population include information on economically active\n\n[p.37]\n\nand economically not active population. The economically active population includes those who are employed and unemployed. The economically inactive population includes those who are mainly home makers, full-time students, dependents, rent-receivers, retired people and other categories of income recipients; and others who are neither employed or unemployed and also do not come under any of the inactive categories mentioned. The reference period for this is the one year or 12 months before the census night, that is from 4 March 2007 to 3 March 2008. This is also referred to as last year or last one year in this instruction manual.\n\nColumn 16: Main Activity during Last Year.\n\n99. First we want to know what has been the main activity of the person during the one year preceding the Census Night. Main Activity means the activity during 6 months (183 days) or more during the last one year (i.e. for the major part of the last year). Codes have been provided on the schedule itself which are to be used while answering this question.\n\nEmployed\n\n99.1 The \"employed\" comprises all persons who were in the following categories for 6 months (183 days) or more during the last one year:\n\n(a) Persons who were in paid employment (e.g. working in public or private organization, etc.).\n\n(b) Persons who during the reference period performed some work for wages, salary, profit or family gains in cash or kind.\n\n(c) Persons who did not do any work for pay or profit during the reference period although they had a job to which they could return (e.g. off season workers like farmers or fishermen), those on sick leave or leave without pay, those who could not work due to strike or lockout in the organization they were working.\n\n(d) Persons who were self-employed (e.g. running a shop by himself or herself, selling eatables, practicing as doctors, lawyers, etc.).\n\n99.2 Work is defined as any economically productive activity that a person does for pay (in cash or kind, in any establishment, office, market, farm, private house) or for profit; or without pay for a family farm or enterprise. Workers (other than those working without pay for a family farm or business) should receive pay or profit in cash or kind for their activity. Unpaid activities which are not contributing to the person's family business such as voluntary social work or voluntary community support are not classified as \"work\" for the purposes of this census. Work may be physical or mental in nature. Work involves not only actual work but also effective supervision and direction of work. It is important to note that it includes unpaid work for a farm or family enterprise. You must ask probing questions to ascertain the existence of a job or employment or unpaid work for a family farm or enterprise during the last year. Please also do not assume that women are generally home makers. You have to specifically ask probing\n\n[p.38]\n\nquestions of women whether they were working. Please also remember that in rural areas where most men are engaged in cultivation, wives and daughters also participate as unpaid family workers in cultivation. Such women should be treated as working instead of treating them as home makers or housewives since they attend to domestic duty also. You have to be very careful not to make this mistake. Similarly, children who work should be regarded as employed.\n\n99.3 What about men or women engaged in production of goods for own consumption?\n\nPlease note that the following activities for own consumption are treated as work:\n\n(i) Production of primary products for own consumption, as growing of food grains or vegetables for own consumption.\n\n(ii) Collection of water and firewood for own consumption.\n\n(iii) The processing of primary commodities for own consumption by the producers of these items (such as drying own vegetables for later use).\n\n(iv) Production of fixed assets for own use (such as building a house or rice paddy dike).\n\n99.4 Activities for own consumption other than the above are not treated as work (e.g. cooking one's own food, washing one's own clothes, etc.). If a person is employed but at the same time also attends to household chores or attends school, etc., he/she should be treated basically as employed.\n\n99.5 If you give Code 1 for a person after following the above instructions, you have to fill in Columns 17 to 21 which will be described subsequently. Please note that Col. 22 and Col. 23 also have to be filled in for an employed person (Code 1 in Col. 16). This will be explained separately later.\n\nUnemployed\n\n99.6 If a person (man or woman) is not employed you should ask whether he or she was unemployed for six months (or 183 days) or over during the last year. Unemployed refers to those who were without work but were seeking work or available for work.\n\n99.7 Please note that home makers, students and others mainly engaged in non-economic activities during the reference period who satisfy the above criteria of unemployment should be regarded as unemployed and not as home makers, students ,etc. If a person returns that he/she is unemployed for the major part of the last year according to these criteria, you should ask whether the person was employed any time before he/she became unemployed. If he/she says Yes, you have to record Code 2 for the person in Column 16. On the other hand, if the person says that he/she was unemployed and seeking work for the first time and was never employed any time before, you should record Code 3 in Column 16. In the case of a person who was\n\n[p.39]\n\nunemployed but was employed any time before (Code 2 in Column 16), you have to fill in Columns 17-21 for last employment. In case of Code 3 in Column 16, enter dash (-) in each of the Columns 17 to 21.\n\nPopulation mainly not employed or unemployed\n\n99.8 The employed and unemployed constitute the economically active population. Those who are not mainly employed or unemployed spend most of their time as home makers, students, etc. which are not considered as economically active. Use the codes given in the schedule for recording the category of people not economically active for six months (or 183 days) or more during the last year.\n\n99.9 The economically not active categories for most of the time last year are explained below:\n\nHome Maker is a person who was mostly engaged during the reference period in household duties in his or her home. Give Code 4 for this category in Column 16.\n\nStudent is a person who was mostly attending school/educational institution (with Code 2 in Column 14(a)). Give Code 5 for this category in Column 16.\n\nDependent: This category includes all dependents like infants and children not attending school, persons permanently disabled and hence cannot do any work and persons who cannot work because of illness or old age. Dependents will include able bodied persons who cannot be categorized in any other inactive category and are dependent on others. However if such a person was seeking or available for work, he or she should be categorized as unemployed and not as dependent. For people who were dependents give Code 6 in Column 16.\n\nRent-receiver, retired or other income recipients: A person who had retired from service and for most of the time was doing no other work, i.e. mostly not employed again in some work or not engaged in some other work such as cultivation, business, trade, etc., or a person who was for most of the time a rent-receiver or a person living on agricultural or nonagricultural royalty, rent or dividend who was neither employed nor unemployed, or any other person of independent means where he/she did not have to work would come under this category. You should give Code 7 in Column 16 for this category of inactive person.\n\nOther, (specify): This category would include all persons not economically active for most of the time and who might not come under any of the above four categories. For such a person (e.g. beggar) you should give Code 8 and specify (e.g. 8 Beggar) in Column 16.\n\n[p.40]\n\nColumns 17 to 21\n\n100. Information in these Columns should be filled in only for a person who is employed (Code 1 in Column 16) or unemployed (employed before) (Code 2 in Column 16). For unemployed (not employed before) (Code 3 in Column 16) and mainly inactive population (any Code from 4 to 8 in Column 16), no information can be furnished in Columns 17 to 21 and hence enter dash (-) in each of these Columns for these persons. The following are the instructions for filling in Columns 17 to 21 for a person for whom Code 1 or 2 is given in Column 16. The information to be filled in will relate to employment details of the employed person (Code 1 in Column 16). In the case of unemployed (employed before) (Code 2 in Column 16), the information to be filled in will relate to last employment held by that person.\n\nColumn 17: Employment Period\n\n101. Give the number of months (rounded off to the nearest month) during which the respondent was employed in the last 12 months. In the case of Code 1 in Column 16, the entry in Column 17 may be 06, 07, 08, 09, 10, 11 or 12 if the person was employed for 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 or 12 months respectively during the last 12 months. In the case of Code 2 in Column 16, please note that you have to enter in Column 17, the number of months employed during the last 12 months only. The entry in Column 17 will be 00 if the person was not employed during the last 12 months. The entry will be 01, 02, 03, 04, or 05 if the person was employed for 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5 respectively during the last 12 months.\n\nColumn 18: Occupation\n\n102. Occupation refers to the name of the job the person did (e.g. cashier, primary school teacher, nurse, blacksmith, watchman, manager, etc.).\n\n102.1 You must write the occupation of a person as clearly and as fully as possible. You should not write only \"staff member\". Probe further to find out whether he/she was a clerk, statistician, data entry operator, etc. Do not write \"Casual Laborer\" which is rather vague. Find out whether he/she was a construction worker, loader, hand-loom weaver etc. If a person says that he/she has been doing two or three jobs, find out the job he/she was doing mostly and record this.\n\nColumn 19: Employment Status\n\n[p.41]\n\n103. Five categories have been provided for Employment Status or Class. When the answer corresponds to one of these, you should record the appropriate code number. Note that you should record only one code for each respondent.\n\n(a) Employer: Record Code 1 for a person who operates his own enterprise directly or through another person (e.g. a manager or caretaker) and who for the operation of this enterprise hires one or more employees whom he pays. Note that the persons considered employees here exclude unpaid family workers and apprentices.\n\n(b) Paid Employee: Record Code 2 for a person who works for a public or private employer and is paid by this employer. All Government servants, for example, are employees. Payment may also be in kind.\n\n(c) Own Account Worker: Record Code 3 for a person who operates his own enterprise (e.g. a farmer cultivating his own land, petty trader, private doctor, advocate who practices independently) and who does not employ anybody to work for him in operation of his enterprise. He or she neither employs anybody nor is employed by anybody, (e.g. a fruit seller who does his or her business all alone).\n\n(d) Unpaid family worker: Record Code 4 for a person who helps in running an economic enterprise operated by a member of his or her family without payment of wages or salary (e.g. wife who helps her husband in farming, daughter who helps in hand-loom weaving).\n\n(e) Other, (specify): To this category belong all persons who do not fall in any of the above groups. You should write down the person's employment status in the space provided, after recording Code 5 (e.g. 5 Apprentice)\n\nColumn 20: Nature of Industry, Trade or Service\n\n104. You have to record here the sector of economy in which a person worked. Examples are: Cultivation, fishing, livestock rearing, selling of vegetables, automobile repairs, manufacture of toys, transport service, school or educational service, sale of clothes (retail), manufacture of eatables, etc. If a person works as a sales assistant in a gas station, his occupation is sales assistant and the nature of his trade is selling petrol (retail). The broad sectors of economy are: (i) Cultivation, fishing, livestock rearing; (ii) Mining or quarrying; (iii) Manufacturing, processing, servicing; (iv) Repairing; (v) Construction; (vi) Electricity, gas or water supply; (vii) Transport and communication; (viii) Trade and Commerce; (ix) Services like domestic service, public service, etc. Do not be content with answer like Reaksmey, Angkor and Co., Bayon and Co., etc., since from these names alone you cannot record the nature of activity of the Company. Ask probing questions to get information regarding the kind of product (e.g. manufacture of cigarettes) or the kind of trade (e.g. Newspaper selling) or the kind of service (e.g. hair\n\n[p.42]\n\ndressing) in which the establishment or company is engaged in. If a person is working in a company with several activities, report the nature of the branch of the company in which the person is working.
