Almost at once, and without explaining their rationale, the Khmer Rouge forcibly emptied Cambodia’s towns and cities, abolished money, schools, private property, law courts, and markets, forbade religious practices, and set almost everybody to work in the countryside growing food. We now know that these decisions were made by the hidden, allpowerful Communist Party of Kampuchea (CPK) as part of its plan to preside over a radical Marxist-Leninist revolution. The Khmer Rouge regime of Democratic Kampuchea (DK), led by a former schoolteacher using the pseudonym Pol Pot, was swept from power by a Vietnamese invasion in January 1979. By then, perhaps as many as 1.5 million Cambodians were dead from malnutrition, overwork, and misdiagnosed and mistreated diseases. At least another 200,000 people, and probably thousands more, had been executed without trial as “class enemies.” Overall, roughly one in five Cambodians died as a result of the regime. Because so many of the victims were ethnic Cambodians, or Khmer, the French author Jean Lacouture coined the term autogenocide to describe the process. In August 1981, two years after the collapse of the Pol Pot regime, I traveled to Phnom Penh with four academic colleagues. It was the first vii\n\nChandler_*i_xvi_FM 9/9/99 1:26 PM Page viii\n\nviii\n\nPreface\n\ntime in ten years I had been in the city. During our three-day sojourn we were struck by the way that the city and its people seemed to be recovering from their catastrophic experiences in the 1970s, when foreign invasions, a ruinous civil war, and the Khmer Rouge regime had successively swept through Cambodia with typhoon force. The people’s courage and resilience in 1981, however, could not diminish the horrors of the Khmer Rouge era. On our second day in Phnom Penh, we were taken to see the Tuol Sleng Museum of Genocidal Crimes, located in a southern section of the city. The museum had been set up by the pro-Vietnamese regime that had replaced the Khmer Rouge. It had been open to the public for about a year and was a prominent feature of government-organized tours for foreign visitors. In prerevolutionary times, we learned, a high school had occupied the site. Under the Khmer Rouge the abandoned school became the headquarters of the regime’s internal security police or santebal. This secret facility, known as S-21, was an interrogation center where over fourteen thousand “enemies” were questioned, tortured, and made to confess to counterrevolutionary crimes. All but a handful were put to death. The existence of S-21 was known in the DK era only to the people inside it and to the country’s leaders, who were themselves concealed from view. Two Vietnamese photographers had stumbled across the compound in January 1979, in the aftermath of the invasion. They discovered the bodies of “about fifty” recently murdered prisoners, instruments used for torture, and a huge, hastily abandoned archive. It was clear to them that under the Khmer Rouge S-21 had been an important and horrific institution. Within days the site was cleaned up and shown to sympathetic foreign visitors. Over the next few months, under Vietnamese guidance, it was transformed into a museum. On our guided tour we were first taken to small classrooms on the ground floor. We saw metal beds, fetters, and photographs of murdered prisoners taken by the Vietnamese when they had entered the compound in 1979. In other ground floor rooms instruments of torture were displayed, alongside paintings by a survivor that depicted prisoners being interrogated, tortured, and killed. Hundreds of enlarged mug shots of prisoners were also posted on the walls. On the second floor we saw the tiny cells assigned to prisoners being questioned and larger rooms where groups of less important captives were held. In a suite of smaller rooms we were shown what remained of S-21’s archive. Stacks of documents, some of them several feet high,\n\nChandler_*i_xvi_FM 9/9/99 1:26 PM Page ix\n\nPreface\n\nix\n\nwere piled into glass-fronted cabinets, on tables, and against the walls. The vast majority, it seemed, consisted of typed or handwritten confessions. There were over four thousand. Some covered only a page or two. A few, drawn from high-ranking prisoners, were several hundred pages long. Other documents in the archive included entry and execution records, interrogators’ notes, copies of speeches by DK officials, Khmer Rouge periodicals, cadre study notebooks, and biographical data about workers at the prison. We spent a few minutes riffling through the papers, taking desultory notes on the prisoners’ “treasonous activities” before emerging, numbed, into the darkening afternoon. Over the next few years, the visit lingered in my mind as other writers, including Elizabeth Becker, Ben Kiernan, and Steve Heder, drew on materials from the archive for their research. In the early 1980s, the human rights activist David Hawk assembled hundreds of documents from S-21 to use as evidence for an unsuccessful campaign to bring the leaders of DK to justice. Throughout the decade, copies of confessions circulated among scholars and journalists interested in the Khmer Rouge. Thanks to the generosity of these people and the cooperation of the museum staff, I used many of these documents for my own research before returning to Cambodia in 1990, when I spent several hours working in the archive, assembling material to be copied. In 1992 and 1993 the S-21 archive was microfilmed under the auspices of Cornell University and the Cambodian Ministry of Culture, which had jurisdiction over the museum. Judy Ledgerwood, John Marston, and Lya Badgley supervised the microfilming at different times. During this period I visited Cambodia four times and kept track of the microfilming project. When the microfilming was complete, the prospect of examining the S-21 archive in depth and at leisure struck me as tempting, and I began to map out an agenda. I hoped initially to use the archive as the basis for a narrative history of opposition to DK. I soon discovered, however, that the truth or falsity of the confessions, along with the innocence or guilt of the people who produced them, could rarely be corroborated. For a narrative history of DK, I realized, I would have to cast a wider net, with no assurance that corroborating documentation for the confessions would ever come to light. On the other hand, the challenge of studying S-21 and its archive on their own terms remained attractive, particularly as a means of entering the collective mentality of the Khmer Rouge and also as a way of coming to grips with a frightening, heavily documented institution. Changing direction in this way soon led me to concentrate on\n\nChandler_*i_xvi_FM 9/9/99 1:26 PM Page x\n\nx\n\nPreface\n\nthose texts that would help me answer such questions as: How did the prison work? Who were the “enemies” being held? How were interrogations structured? When was torture applied? Was S-21 primarily a “Communist” facility or a “Cambodian” one? Were there foreign models for it? And so on. Between 1993 and 1998 I examined over a thousand confession texts, scanned hundreds more, and read all the administrative materials from the prison that had come to light. These included hundreds of documents that were discovered in 1996 and 1997, after the Cornell project was complete. Over the years I supplemented my readings in the archive with research in secondary literature, looking for comparative insights. This book is the result. Over the years that it took me to write it, I received generous financial support for my research and incurred a multitude of intellectual debts that I am happy to acknowledge. The greatest of these debts, extending over the past thirty-two years, is to my wife, Susan. During our sojourns in Melbourne, Paris, Washington, D.C., and elsewhere, she has shared the ups and downs of my teaching career and the joys and glooms of my research. She has read successive drafts of everything I’ve written. Her comments have improved everything she has read. She has accomplished all this with baffling good humor in the midst of her own busy professional life, in the course of raising our three children, and on top of many other interests. This book, like my earlier ones, would never have taken shape without her close reading, her support, and her astute suggestions. Work on the book was formally set in motion when the vice chancellor of Monash University, Professor Mal Logan, underwrote the purchase of a set of S-21 microfilms for me to work with. John Badgley, the curator of the Southeast Asia collection at Cornell University, saw to it that all 210 reels were waiting for me in 1994 when I took up a fellowship at the Woodrow Wilson Center in Washington, D.C. Over the next eight months I familiarized myself with the archive, copied hundreds of confessions, and gave several seminars that helped me to refine my research focus and my conclusions. Back in Australia, the Australian Research Council provided me with a generous grant that defrayed the cost of research assistance and allowed me to copy hundreds of confessions onto paper. In 1995 a fellowship from the Harry Frank Guggenheim Foundation paid for further research assistance and a trip to Cambodia. The fellowship also allowed me to reduce my Monash teaching load for a semester. In March 1996, when I was ready to start writing, a resident fellowship at the Rockefeller Foundation’s study center at\n\nChandler_*i_xvi_FM 9/9/99 1:26 PM Page xi\n\nPreface\n\nxi\n\nBellagio gave Susan and me an unimpeded month to consider how my research might be turned into a book. At every stage of my work I have been favored with excellent libraries, assiduous administrative support, and superb research assistance. Library staff at Monash University and the University of Wisconsin were helpful in tracking down secondary materials. I am particularly grateful for the administrative support provided as the book was being written, first at Monash by Val Campbell and Wendy Perkins, and later at the University of Wisconsin by Danny Streubing and at the University of Oregon by Martina Armstrong. My talented research assistants at the Wilson Center, Thong-Chi Ton Nu and Tim O’Connell, refined the computerized index to the archive and hunted down invaluable secondary materials. For the next three years my research assistant in Australia was Sok Pirun, a survivor of the DK era who had been trained as a historian in Phnom Penh in the 1960s. Pirun gave unstintingly of his time, arranged some fascinating interviews for me, and translated dozens of key documents from the archive. As we worked together, he provided a running commentary on the project and thereby gave me an invaluable entrée into the murky thought-world of the Khmer Rouge. Another survivor of the DK regime, Mouth Sophea, took an interest in my work when I was teaching in Madison and helped me over several hurdles of interpretation. Over the years I have been buoyed up by friends and colleagues who have read all or part of the manuscript. These include Sara Colm, May Ebihara, Craig Etcheson, Kate Frieson, Alexander Hinton, Charles F. Keyes, Judy Ledgerwood, Alfred W. McCoy, and Keith W. Taylor. Steve Heder in particular has been unstinting in his help, sending me hundreds of pages of unpublished translations, several unpublished essays, numerous interview transcripts, and invaluable comments on the full text and on specific points. Several of Richard Arant’s graceful translations from the S-21 archive have found their way into the book, and I am grateful for his interest in the project. Henri Locard shared his findings about “the Khmer Rouge gulag” with me in 1995–1997, and my more recent discussions with Alexander Hinton about the collective psychology of the Khmer Rouge have helped me to reformulate some of my ideas. In 1994 I came to know Douglas Niven and Chris Riley, two intrepid photojournalists who formed the Photo Archive Group in Phnom Penh to clean, index, and reprint over six thousand photographs—the vast majority of them mug shots—from negatives that they discovered in woe-\n\nChandler_*i_xvi_FM 9/9/99 1:26 PM Page xii\n\nxii\n\nPreface\n\nful condition at S-21. Along with their friend Peter Maguire, Doug and Chris provided me with transcripts of interviews they conducted in 1995 and 1996, and Doug arranged several interviews with former workers at S-21 that we conducted together in 1997 and 1998. Additional interview transcripts were kindly provided at various times by Richard Arant, David Ashley, Chhang Youk, Sara Colm, David Hawk, Steve Heder, Alexander Hinton, Ben Kiernan, Nate Thayer, and Lionel Vairon. Soon after I began writing, I learned that the Cambodia Genocide project administered by Yale University had gained access to a range of new materials dating from the Lon Nol period (1970–1975) and the DK era. Thanks to Dr. Timothy Castle in the Office of the DPMO-MIA in the U.S. Department of Defense, I was given a contract to examine these materials to see whether they contained information useful to the MIA program. In 1997 I visited Cambodia three times to review the materials, now housed in the Documentation Center–Cambodia (DC– Cam) under the able supervision of Chhang Youk, whose enthusiastic help in 1997 and 1998 was crucial to DPMO-MIA and to my S-21 project. During these visits, Lach Vorleak Kaliyan, the archivist at the Tuol Sleng Museum, located and copied several hundred pages of materials that had been found at S-21 after the Cornell University microfilming project had been completed. Many other people have been helpful to me along the way, clearing up specific points, making comparative suggestions, and sharing their ideas about the Khmer Rouge. In addition to those named already, and at the risk of offending anyone I might forget to single out, I am happy to acknowledge the help of Norman Aiblett, Susan Aitken, Lya Badgley, Elizabeth Becker, Andy Brouwer, Frederick Brown, Mary Brown Bullock, Timothy Carney, Susan Cook, Robert Cribb, Thomas Cushman, Stephen Dunn, Penny Edwards, Craig Etcheson, Joseph Fraley, Lindsay French, Edward Friedman, Jörg Friedrich, David Garrioch, Christopher Goscha, Bailey Gunther, Eleanor Hancock, Anne Hansen, Iem Sokhim, Helen Jarvis, David Jenkins, William Joseph, Ben Kiernan, J.

Gary Swinton, of the Monash Geography Department, prepared the diagram of S-21. Putting the book together, in spite of its horrific subject matter, has been a pleasurable, cooperative effort. Without the copious help I have mentioned it could never have been written.\n\nChandler_*i_xvi_FM 9/9/99 1:26 PM Page xiv\n\nChandler_001_013_ch1 8/31/99 5:16 PM Page 1\n\nchapter one\n\nDiscovering S-21\n\nOn 7 January 1979, a bright, breezy day in Cambodia’s cool season, heavily armed Vietnamese forces, accompanied by lightly armed Cambodian allies, reached the outskirts of Phnom Penh after a blitzkrieg campaign that had begun on Christmas Day. For over a year, Vietnam had been at war with the Maoist-inspired regime of Democratic Kampuchea (DK), known in the West as the Khmer Rouge. Their invading force of over one hundred thousand troops, including armored units, was reinforced by a sustained aerial bombardment.1 The rapidity of the Vietnamese success took their commanders by surprise. After barely two weeks of fighting, Cambodia cracked open like an egg. The leaders of DK, most of their army, and tens of thousands of their followers fled or were herded out of the city. The invaders were welcomed by nearly everyone who stayed behind. These were people terrorized and exhausted by nearly four years of undernourishment, back-breaking labor, and widespread executions. A similar welcome, tragically misplaced, had greeted the Khmer Rouge themselves when they had occupied Phnom Penh in April 1975 and ordered its population into the countryside to become agricultural workers. In both cases, people were longing desperately for peace.2 By late afternoon the Vietnamese forces had occupied the city. Aside from a few hundred prisoners of war and other people—including some of the workers at S-21—who were in hiding, waiting to escape, Phnom Penh was empty.3 1\n\nChandler_001_013_ch1 8/31/99 5:16 PM Page 2\n\n2\n\nDiscovering S-21\n\nAfter the Khmer Rouge had emptied the city in 1975, Phnom Penh had remained the country’s capital, but it never regained its status as an urban center. The bureaucrats, soldiers, and factory workers quartered there probably never numbered more than fifty thousand. During the DK era, the country had no stores, markets, schools, temples, or public facilities, except for a warehouse in the capital serving the diplomatic community. In Phnom Penh, barbed-wire fences enclosed factories, workshops, barracks, and government offices. Street signs were painted over, and barbed-wire entanglements blocked many streets to traffic. Banana trees were planted in vacant lots. Automobiles abandoned in 1975 were rusted in piles along with refrigerators, washing machines, television sets, and typewriters. Scraps of paper in the gutters included prerevolutionary currency, worthless under the Khmer Rouge. On 7 January 1979, no people or animals could be seen. As in 1975, the central government, such as it was, had disappeared. Once again, Cambodians were being made to start at zero.4 The effect of the desolation on the newcomers was phantasmagoric. Chey Saphon, for example, was a forty-seven-year-old Cambodian Communist who had fought against the French in the 1950s. He had lived in Vietnam since 1955 and had been trained as a journalist. On 7 January he was thrilled to be returning home with the Vietnamese troops. He was so unnerved by what he saw, however, that years later he recalled that he “spent the whole afternoon in tears.”5 Over the next few days Vietnamese troops fanned out across Phnom Penh. On 8 January, in the southern sector of Tuol Svay Prey, two Vietnamese photojournalists who had accompanied the invasion were drawn toward a particular compound by the smell of decomposing bodies.6 The silent, malodorous site was surrounded by a corrugated tin fence topped with coils of barbed wire. Over the gate was a red placard inscribed in yellow with a Khmer slogan: “Fortify the spirit of the revolution! Be on your guard against the strategy and tactics of the enemy so as to defend the country, the people and the Party.” The place carried no other identification.7 Pushing inside, the two photographers found themselves on the grounds of what appeared once to have been a high school. The spacious, dilapidated compound measured roughly four hundred meters from east to west and six hundred meters from north to south (see illustrations). It consisted of four whitewashed concrete buildings, each three stories high, with balcony corridors running along each upper story. A fifth, single-story wooden building, facing west, split the compound\n\nChandler_001_013_ch1 8/31/99 5:16 PM Page 3\n\nDiscovering S-21\n\n3\n\ninto two identical grassy spaces. To the rear of each of these, one of the taller buildings faced east, toward the entrance. Similar buildings marked off the northern and southern boundaries of the compound.8 The purpose of the compound was unclear to the two men, although the single-story building, littered with papers and office equipment, had obviously been used for some sort of administration. In rooms on the ground floor of the southernmost building, the two Vietnamese came across the corpses of several recently murdered men. Some of the bodies were chained to iron beds. The prisoners’ throats had been cut. The blood on the floors was still wet. Altogether the bodies of fourteen people were discovered in the compound, apparently killed only a couple of days before.9 In large classrooms on the upper floors of the western buildings, the patrol found heaps of shackles, handcuffs, whips, and lengths of chain. Other rooms on the upper floors had been divided by clumsily bricked partitions into small cells where each prisoner’s foot had been manacled, as William Shawcross later wrote, “to a shackle large enough to take a ship’s anchor.” Ammunition boxes in some of the cells contained human feces.10 On the third floor were slightly larger, more elaborately constructed cells with wooden walls and doors. The two intruders took photographs of all the rooms in the facility, adding photos of the corpses. They then “informed the Vietnamese authorities” of what they had found. That evening the corpses were burnt “as a sanitary measure.” Some of the photographs taken at that time now hang in the rooms where the bodies were found. Over the next few days the Vietnamese and their Cambodian assistants discovered in nearby houses thousands of documents in Khmer, thousands of mug-shot photographs and undeveloped negatives, hundreds of cadre notebooks, and stacks of DK publications. In a workshop near the front gate they found several recently completed, oversized concrete busts of the DK prime minister, Pol Pot, a concrete mold for the statues, and some portraits of him, apparently painted from photographs. The Vietnamese had stumbled into a vicious and important Khmer Rouge facility. Documents found at the site soon revealed that it had been designated in the DK era by the code name S-21. The “S,” it seemed, stood for sala, or “hall,” while “21” was the code number assigned to santebal, a Khmer compound term that combined the words santisuk (security) and nokorbal (police). “S-21,” and santebal, were names for DK’s security police, or special branch.11\n\nChandler_001_013_ch1 8/31/99 5:16 PM Page 4\n\n4\n\nDiscovering S-21\n\nOver the next few weeks the history of the site was pieced together. In the early 1960s, when Cambodia had been ruled by Prince Norodom Sihanouk, it had been a high school. It was named after Ponhea Yat, a semilegendary Cambodian king associated with the foundation of Phnom Penh.12 After Sihanouk was overthrown in 1970—the event that sparked Cambodia’s civil war—the school had taken the name of the surrounding district, Tuol Svay Prey (hillock of the wild mango). An adjoining primary school was called Tuol Sleng (hillock of the sleng tree). This name was used to designate the entire compound after it became the Museum of Genocidal Crimes in 1980, perhaps because the sleng tree bears poisonous fruit.13 The code name S-21 began to appear on Khmer Rouge documents in September 1975. For the next nine months, until the facility came into operation in May or June 1976, the security service’s work was spread among several units in Phnom Penh, the southern suburb of Ta Khmau, and in Sector 25, north of the capital.14 By the end of 1975, according to a former guard, Kok Sros, interviewed in 1997, santebal coalesced under the command of Kang Keck Ieu (alias Duch), a former schoolteacher who had been in charge of security in the so-called special zone north of the capital during the civil war. Duch became the director of the Tuol Sleng facility in June 1976. He remained in command until the day the Vietnamese arrived.15 Sensing the historical importance and the propaganda value of their discovery, the Vietnamese closed off the site, cleaned it up, and began, with Cambodian help, to examine its voluminous archive. On 25 January 1979, a group of journalists from socialist countries was invited to Cambodia by the Vietnamese to report on and celebrate the installation of the new Cambodian government, known as the People’s Republic of Kampuchea (PRK). The journalists were the first official visitors to see Tuol Sleng. Chey Saphon accompanied them to the site. One of the journalists, the Cuban Miguel Rivero, wrote later that “there were still traces of blood on the floor. The smell was even more penetrating. There were thousands of green flies circling the room.” Rivero added that he saw documents “written in Sanskrit” and “several” copies of Mao Zedong’s Little Red Book at the “Dantesque” site.16 Soon afterwards, in February or March 1979 (his own memory is uncertain), Mai Lam, a Vietnamese colonel who was fluent in Khmer and had extensive experience in legal studies and museology, arrived in Phnom Penh. He was given the task of organizing the documents found at S-21 into an archive and transforming the facility into what David\n\nChandler_001_013_ch1 8/31/99 5:16 PM Page 5\n\nDiscovering S-21\n\n5\n\nHawk has called “a museum of the Cambodian nightmare.”17 The first aspect of Mai Lam’s work was more urgent than the second. It was hoped that documents found at the prison could be introduced as evidence in the trials of Pol Pot and Ieng Sary, DK’s minister of foreign affairs, on charges of genocide. These took place in Phnom Penh in August 1979. Although valuable information about S-21 was produced at the trials, none of the documents in the archive provided the smoking gun that the Vietnamese and PRK officials probably hoped to find. No document linking either Pol Pot or Ieng Sary directly with orders to eliminate people at S-21 has ever been discovered, although the lines of authority linking S-21 with the Party Center (mochhim pak) have been established beyond doubt. Because of his penchant for history, his experience with museums (he had organized the Museum of American War Crimes in Ho Chi Minh City), and the criminality of what had happened at S-21, Mai Lam approached his work with enthusiasm and pride. His genuine, somewhat patronizing fondness for Cambodia and its people, based on his experiences in Cambodia in the first Indochina war, also inspired him. “In order to understand the crimes of Pol Pot–Ieng Sary,” he told interviewers in 1994, “first you should understand Cambodians, both the people and the country.”18 In turning S-21 into a museum of genocide, Mai Lam wanted to arrange Cambodia’s recent past to fit the requirements of the PRK and its Vietnamese mentors as well as the long-term needs, as he saw them, of the Cambodian people. Because numbers of the “Pol Pot–Ieng Sary genocidal clique,” as the Vietnamese labeled them, had been Cambodians themselves, the message that Mai Lam was trying to deliver was different from the one that he had hoped to convey in the Museum of American War Crimes, but it was just as harsh. The history that he constructed in the exhibits at S-21 denied the leaders of the CPK any socialist credentials and encouraged viewers to make connections between the DK regime and Tuol Sleng on the one hand, and Nazi Germany and what Serge Thion has called the “sinister charisma” of Auschwitz on the other. The comparisons were fitting insofar as S-21, like the Nazi death camps, was a secret facility where all the inmates were condemned to death, but any more explicit links between Nazism and DK, although seductive, were inexact.19 A Cambodian survivor of S-21, Ung Pech, became the director of the museum when it opened in 1980. He held the position for several years and traveled with Mai Lam to France, the USSR, and Eastern Europe in\n\nChandler_001_013_ch1 8/31/99 5:16 PM Page 6\n\n6\n\nDiscovering S-21\n\nthe early 1980s to visit museums and exhibits memorializing the Holocaust. Although Mai Lam remained in Cambodia until 1988, working at Tuol Sleng much of the time, he concealed his “specialist-consultant” role from outsiders, creating the impression that the initiatives for the museum and its design had come from the Cambodian victims rather than from the Vietnamese—an impression that he was eager to correct in his interviews in the 1990s.20 Over the next few months, people working at the prison constructed a rough history of the facility, drawing on entry and execution records, memoranda by prison officials, and the memories of survivors. Between April 1975 and the first week of 1979, they discovered, at least fourteen thousand men, women, and children had been held by S-21. Because the entry records for several months of 1978 were incomplete, the true number of prisoners was undoubtedly higher. Of the documented prisoners, all but a dozen specially exempted ones, including Ung Pech, had been put to death. Since 1979, seven of these survivors have come forward. Their memories, corroborated by those of former workers at the prison, have been invaluable for this study.21 The records from S-21 also showed that most of the lower-ranking prisoners had been held for a few days or weeks, whereas more important ones, and lesser figures suspected of grave offenses, had been incarcerated for several months. Thousands of the prisoners, regardless of their importance, had undergone interrogation, prepared “answers” (chomlaoy) or confessions admitting counterrevolutionary crimes, and submitted lists of their associates, titled “strings” or “networks of traitors” (khsae kbot), that sometimes ran to several hundred names. The texts range from a single page to several hundred pages. Roughly 4,300 of them have so far come to light, including those of nearly all the important DK figures known to have been purged.22 Confession texts, survivors’ memories, and the grisly instruments discovered at the site made it clear that torture was widely inflicted at S-21. Tortured or threatened with torture, few prisoners maintained their innocence for long. Considered guilty from the moment they arrived—the traditional Cambodian phrase for prisoner, neak thos, translates literally as “guilty person”—thousands of these men and women were expected to confess their guilt in writing before they were taken off to be killed. This bizarre procedure drew some of its inspiration from the notion of revolutionary justice enshrined in the Reign of Terror in eighteenth-century France and enacted in the Moscow show trials in the 1930s and also from the land reform and “reeducation”\n\nChandler_001_013_ch1 8/31/99 5:16 PM Page 7\n\nDiscovering S-21\n\n7\n\ncampaigns in China in the 1940s and in Vietnam a decade later. In spite or perhaps because of these manifold influences, no precise or overriding foreign model for S-21 can be identified. Moreover, the severity of practices at S-21 and the literalness with which interrogators went about their business also reflected prerevolutionary Cambodian punitive traditions, by which prisoners were never considered innocent and crimes of lèse-majesté were mercilessly punished. Although DK’s economic and social policies do not fit into a fascist framework, the resemblances between S-21 and Nazi death camps are striking. Works discussing the Holocaust provide insights into the psychology of torturers, administrators, and victims at the prison, as do more recent works that deal with torturers in the “dirty war” in Argentina in the 1970s and early 1980s. The list of materials that I have found useful for comparative purposes could easily be extended.23 The most striking difference between the German and Cambodian cases lies in the extent of the documentation produced at S-21. Prisoners both under the Nazis and in DK were removed from any semblance of legal protection; but whereas those in the Nazi death camps were simply exploited for physical labor while awaiting execution, those in S-21 were treated almost as if they were subject to a judicial system and their confessions were to provide evidence for a court of law. In this respect they resemble the alleged counterrevolutionaries who went on “trial” in the Soviet Union in large numbers in the 1930s. In Nazi Germany, political prisoners were kept in separate camps from those targeted for execution and were somewhat better treated. At S-21, all were charged with political offenses, and all were to be killed. Like the Nazi extermination camps and the Argentine torture facilities, S-21 was a secret facility, and the need for secrecy influenced much of what happened inside its walls. The prison’s existence was known only to those who worked or were imprisoned there and to a handful of high-ranking cadres, known as the Party Center, who reviewed the documents emerging from S-21 and selected the individuals and the military and other units to be purged. Interrogators, clerks, photographers, guards, and cooks at the prison were forbidden to mingle with workers elsewhere, and the compound soon earned an eerie reputation. A factory worker in a nearby compound, interviewed in 1989, referred to S-21 as “the place where people went in but never came out.”24 The factory workers were uncertain about what went on inside its walls but were ready to think the worst. Party leaders never referred to S-21 by name. In 1997, when questioned by the journalist Nate Thayer, Pol Pot\n\nChandler_001_013_ch1 8/31/99 5:16 PM Page 8\n\n8\n\nDiscovering S-21\n\ndenied any knowledge of “Tuol Sleng,” hinting that the museum and its archive were Vietnamese concoctions. “I was at the top,” he said: I made only big decisions on big issues. I want to tell you—Tuol Sleng was a Vietnamese exhibition. A journalist wrote that. People talk about Tuol Sleng, Tuol Sleng, Tuol Sleng. . . . When I first heard about Tuol Sleng it was on the Voice of America. I listened twice.25\n\nGuided tours of S-21 were first organized in March 1979, but for over a year, as the museum took shape, only foreigners were admitted because, as a PRK Ministry of Culture, Information, and Propaganda document from 1980 asserted, the site was intended primarily “to show . . . international guests the cruel torture committed by the traitors to the Khmer people.” In the meantime, Mai Lam and his associates were slowly transforming the site into a museum. In July 1980 the ban on Cambodian visitors was lifted, and tens of thousands visited S-21, many of them seeking information about relatives who had disappeared. They consulted hundreds of enlarged mug shots of prisoners on view on the ground floor of the prison, which formed a major component of the museum display. As Judy Ledgerwood has written, many of the visitors were also “searching for meaning, for some explanation of what had happened. A visit would not have been an easy task; people who went through the museum in the first year said that the stench of the place was overwhelming.”26 Some thirty-two thousand people visited the museum in the first week it was open to the public. By October 1980, over three hundred thousand Cambodians and eleven thousand foreigners had passed through the facility.27 Mai Lam always had high ambitions for S-21. He wanted to establish a museum and organize an archive that would be useful to the Cambodian people and would prevent them from forgetting what had happened under “the contemptible Pot” (a-Pot). One of his more melodramatic exhibits was a large map of Cambodia, composed of skulls with the rivers shown in blood red. In the early 1980s, after S-21’s killing field at Choeung Ek, west of the capital, had been excavated under his direction, he supervised the exhumation of thousands of bodies and ordered the construction of memorial stupa at the site, fronted with glass and filled with skulls. Talking to Sara Colm in 1995, Mai Lam said: For seven years I studied . . . to build up the Museum . . . for the Cambodian people to help them study the war and the many aspects of war crimes. . . . For the regular people who cannot understand, the museum can help them.\n\nChandler_001_013_ch1 8/31/99 5:16 PM Page 9\n\nDiscovering S-21\n\n9\n\nEven though they suffered from the regime, as a researcher I want them to go [to the museum]. Even though it makes them cry. . . . The Cambodian people who suffered the war could not understand the war—and the new generation also cannot understand.28\n\nFor many Cambodians, as Ledgerwood points out, there are problems of “authenticity” in a museum established by foreigners to press home fortuitous parallels between the “genocidal regime” of DK and Hitler’s Germany. At the same time, for the survivors the vast and seemingly random cruelties of the DK regime easily became encapsulated in the museum’s displays. Nazism seemed as good a label as any other for the horrors that the survivors of the regime had undergone. The indifference of DK officials to their victims, exhibited in room after room, recurs in the memories of many survivors. Cambodians’ interpretations of the Pol Pot era slip easily into Manichean frameworks that make poor history but are emotionally satisfying and consistent with much of what they remember. This point has been driven home by the French psychiatrists Jean-Pierre Hiegel and Colette Landrac, who worked in Khmer Rouge refugee camps in Thailand in the 1980s: It is always more comfortable to have a Manichean vision of the world, for that allows us not to ask too many questions or at least to have the answer readily at hand. In this fashion, representing the Khmer Rouge as an homogenous group of indoctrinated fanatics, the incarnation of absolute evil, responsible for all the unhappiness of the Khmer people, is a reductive vision of a complex phenomenon but one which a good many people find satisfying.29\n\nWithin just such a Manichean framework, the PRK regime worked hard to focus people’s anger onto the “genocidal clique” that had governed Cambodia between April 1975 and January 1979. While the new government based its legitimacy on the fact that it had come to power by toppling the Khmer Rouge, it was in no position to condemn the entire movement, since so many prominent PRK figures had been Khmer Rouge themselves until they defected to Vietnam in 1977 and 1978. The continuing existence of DK’s leaders and their armed followers on the Thai-Cambodian border, however, gave the Vietnamese a rationale for keeping their troops in the country and allowed the PRK to label its political opponents as Khmer Rouge. Like their predecessors in other Cambodian regimes, PRK spokesmen arranged history to suit their day-to-day requirements. In their formulations, the Cambodian Communist movement had been an authentic revolutionary one, up to and including the liberation of Phnom Penh\n\nChandler_001_013_ch1 8/31/99 5:16 PM Page 10\n\n10\n\nDiscovering S-21\n\nin 1975, when the movement had suddenly and inexplicably spun out of control. This contorted narrative enabled the PRK to celebrate the socialist “triumph” of 17 April 1975 while condemning the people who brought it about. PRK historiography also stressed a long-standing official friendship between Khmer and Vietnamese movements and regimes that was hard to locate in the historical record.30 These tangled readings of the past made sense to Party faithful. After all, only an authentic revolutionary movement could have defeated the United States; and, once the wheel of history had turned, no such movement could have been so cruel to ordinary people or could have opposed the genuinely revolutionary Vietnamese. These ex post facto explanations, however, were of little interest to most nonrevolutionary Khmer. They found it easier to focus their memories on “the contemptible Pot,” whose bizarre, unpardonable crime was not that he had been a Communist (or a “fascist”) but that he had presided over the deaths of so many of his own people. If the Vietnamese wanted to call Pol Pot a fascist, people would go along with it, without knowing much about the subject. Thus, talking with Lionel Vairon in 1995, the S-21 survivor Pha Thachan, by then a general in the Cambodian army, stated: Yes, what happened under Pol Pot was “Communism,” but it was of a “fascist” kind, and it surpassed fascism. In fascism the Germans never killed their own people, they only killed foreigners. They killed French and Poles and so on. Pol Pot on the other hand killed his own people, three million of them. The fascists never did this.31\n\nIn annual “days of hate,” the government mobilized public opinion and refreshed people’s memories of the DK period. On these occasions, anti–Pol Pot demonstrations were organized for school children, PRK officials made speeches condemning the DK, and Vann Nath and other survivors of S-21 were called on to recite their experiences at the prison.32 By the mid-1980s visitors to the archive, relocated to the second floor of one of the western buildings at Tuol Sleng, were impressed by the mass of documentation collected there. Many of the dossiers were over a foot thick. Hundreds were typed and duplicated. Glass-fronted cabinets in the archive were stuffed with cadre notebooks recording political meetings, military seminars, and sessions of paramedical training. Stapled “summaries” of confessions, stacked in piles, sometimes ran to hundreds of pages. Journalists and scholars were encouraged to photo-\n\nChandler_001_013_ch1 8/31/99 5:16 PM Page 11\n\nDiscovering S-21\n\n11\n\ncopy confession texts and other materials. In the 1980s, the human rights activist David Hawk assembled a daunting collection of materials from Tuol Sleng that provided ample evidence of the extrajudicial crimes of the DK regime.33 His efforts and those of others to bring DK’s leaders to justice then and later were stymied by Thai intransigence and political considerations. Thoughts about bringing the Khmer Rouge leaders to trial gathered steam again in the 1990s as the Khmer Rouge movement lost momentum.34 After 1989, when the Vietnamese withdrew their troops from Cambodia, the fate of the archive, and even of the museum, looked uncertain. In 1991 Cornell University, noted for the richness of its Southeast Asian library holdings, proposed to catalogue and microfilm the S-21 archive, which came under the Ministry of Culture’s jurisdiction. The work was completed in two years. A full set of the microfilms was deposited in the Cornell University library; another set was retained by the museum. The microfilmed materials cover 210 reels of film, including eleven reels of retakes. The reels contain all the confession texts discovered at the site, including those by foreign prisoners (filmed on separate reels). Foreigners’ confessions were primarily those of Vietnamese prisoners of war but also included statements from Thai and Vietnamese fishermen, some Vietnamese civilians, and a handful of American, British, and Australian sailors who were arrested when their boats strayed too near the Cambodian coast.35 Among the most revealing confessions in the archive are those of seventy-nine former workers at the prison. Twenty-four of these prisoners had been interrogators, and twelve had been document workers. Most of the others had been guards. These texts provide valuable biographical data about the young men working at the prison. They are also helpful in documenting work patterns at S-21, the style of interrogations, and the practice of torture (tearunikam) there. The microfilmed reels also reproduce a range of nonconfessional materials that were discovered at the prison. These include entry and execution records, typed summaries of confessions broken down by region, and military unit and government office and study notebooks that cover such diverse subjects as politics, aircraft identification, mathematics, medicine, artillery, and small arms. The nonconfessional materials also include copies of the CPK’s statutes, speeches, and directives from the Party Center and copies of DK’s theoretical journals, Revolutionary Flags (Tung Padevat) and Revolutionary Youth, distributed to\n\nChandler_001_013_ch1 8/31/99 5:16 PM Page 12\n\n12\n\nDiscovering S-21\n\nParty members. Materials stemming from the prison itself include a report for the first three months of 1977, written notes from interrogators reporting the torture of prisoners, rules for guards, and notes by Duch, the prison director, on a range of issues, including his analysis of the confession texts in a handwritten document probably written in early 1978, titled “The Last Plan.” Probably the most revealing nonconfessional text microfilmed by Cornell is a fifty-five-page study notebook compiled by an interrogator, prepared in 1976. This text is discussed in detail in chapter 5.36 When the microfilming at S-21 was completed in 1993, it was thought that the reels included all the significant surviving material from the prison. In 1995, however, another S-21 archive, held in the Cambodian Ministry of the Interior, was presented to the Documentation Center–Cambodia (DC–Cam), an affiliate of the Cambodia Genocide Program established by Yale University, with a grant from the U.S. Department of State, with a view to gathering documentation of the DK regime. The new material, held by DC–Cam in Phnom Penh, seems to be have been drawn from the archives of the DK minister of defense and national security, Son Sen, who also oversaw the operations of the prison. Over fifty confession texts in this collection contain annotations in Son Sen’s writing. Many of the confession cover sheets also bear handwritten annotations in Vietnamese, suggesting that they had been reviewed under the Vietnamese protectorate of Cambodia in the 1980s. The newly discovered materials included dozens of confessions that had not survived in the S-21 archive, as well as valuable administrative materials, such as notes from self-critical study sessions held for cadres at the prison and notebooks compiled by senior interrogators. DK materials unrelated to S-21 are also housed in DC–Cam and will undoubtedly be of interest to scholars of the regime. Several hundred documents from S-21 itself that were not microfilmed have also found their way into the DC–Cam collections since 1996. These include miscellaneous, fragmentary interrogation schedules, lists of prisoners who were ill, documents transmitted with prisoners to S-21, and over two hundred additional study notebooks. Two that are of special interest were prepared in 1977 and 1978 by the chief interrogator, Mam Nay (alias Chan) and, in a shared notebook, by two senior interrogators known by their pseudonyms Tuy and Pon (henceforth the Tuy-Pon notebook). Discovering S-21, in other words, is a process that began in January 1979 and is still under way. The mass of material now available seems\n\nChandler_001_013_ch1 8/31/99 5:16 PM Page 13\n\nDiscovering S-21\n\n13\n\nsufficient to support a detailed study of the prison. The Yugoslav writer Milovan Djilas has observed that “the way prisons are run and their inmates are treated gives a faithful picture of society, especially of the ideas and methods of those who dominate the society”—a remark that seems particularly appropriate to S-21 and Democratic Kampuchea.37 As we pore through the materials and listen to the voices of so many people living under extreme conditions, we may also learn something about ourselves. I first visited Tuol Sleng for less than an hour in August 1981. Since 1990, I have returned to the museum many times. In spite or perhaps because of the courtesy and friendliness of the staff, I am always disoriented by the place. On every visit, I’ve been struck by the contrast between the peaceful, sun-soaked compound and the horrific exhibits on display, between the whitewashed classrooms with their yellow and white tile floors and the instruments of torture they contain, between the children at play outside the buildings and the mug shots of other children en route to being killed. In the museum, the eyes of the mounted mug shots, and especially those of the women and children, seem to follow me. Knowing as we do, and as they did not, that every one of them was facing death when the photographs were taken gives the photos an unnerving quality that is more affecting, for me at least, than the photographs of dead prisoners or the grisly portrayals of torture painted after 1979 by the S-21 survivor, Vann Nath, that are also included in the display.38 On most of my visits mynah birds have hopped along the overgrown paths. Roosters have crowed around the neighborhood, the sound competing with the hum of traffic on Monivong Boulevard to the east or, in the dry season, with music broadcast over loudspeakers from Buddhist wedding celebrations nearby. The noises in the 1970s were different. Almost every night in the pitch-dark, silent city, workers at the prison who were quartered on the boulevard heard the screams of people being tortured. Indeed, all the survivors and people who worked at the prison share the memory of hearing people crying out in pain at night. Moving through the museum, absorbing its archive and listening to survivors and to people who worked at the prison, we can still hear many of these ghostly voices. They control the narrative that follows.\n\nChandler_014_040_ch2 8/31/99 5:19 PM Page 14\n\nchapter two\n\nS-21: A Total Institution\n\nThe sociologist Erving Goffman, in his illuminating book Asylums, defines a total institution as “a place of residence and work where a large number of like-situated individuals, cut off from the wider society for an appreciable period of time, together lead an enclosed, formally administered round of life.”1 Goffman goes on to call such institutions—which can include schools, monasteries, prisons, hospitals, military units and so on—“forcing houses for changing persons; each is a natural experiment on what can be done to the self.”2 Under the Communist Party of Kampuchea (CPK), which was itself a total institution par excellence, all of Cambodia soon became what Irving Louis Horowitz has called a “sealed environment,” cut off from the outside world. The country was administered by a handful of politically obsessive men and women, many of them former schoolteachers, who saw it as their long-term duty to oversee, punish, and transform the people under their control. The cadres in charge of S-21, in turn, were under the surveillance of the Party Center (mochhim pak), similarly concealed from view, and, as members of an independent regiment, they worked under military discipline. S-21, the Party Center, the CPK, and the state of Democratic Kampuchea (DK), in other words, can be seen as successively more inclusive “forcing houses for changing persons.” By Goffman’s definition S-21 was an extreme example of a total institution. Its mission was to protect the Party Center. It accomplished this task in part by killing all the prisoners and in part by altering their autobi14\n\nChandler_014_040_ch2 8/31/99 5:19 PM Page 15\n\nS-21: A Total Institution\n\n15\n\nographies to align them with the requirements and suspicions of the Party. Control over biographies, inmates, and the personnel working at S-21 was absolute and followed a complex “discipline” (viney) that enabled the keepers to dominate the kept and to preside over their refashioning.3 S-21 combined incarceration, investigative, judicial, and counterespionage functions. Some documents refer to it as a “ministry” (krosuong), others as an “office” (munthi). Counterparts of santebal in other Communist countries would be the Soviet NKVD, the East German Stasi, and the Central Case Examination Group in China. Parallels also exist between S-21 and such bodies as the American FBI and the British MI5. In fact, most twentieth-century nations have a national security apparatus. Unlike many of its counterparts, however, S-21 deployed no agents in the countryside or overseas and had no central policymaking office. After mid-1976, its functions were carried out almost entirely at Tuol Sleng. For these reasons I use the names “S-21,” santebal, and Tuol Sleng interchangeably. Although S-21’s mission and the duties of people working there were not spelled out in law, for DK had no legal code and no judicial system, they resembled those of the Soviet secret police, empowered by the Soviet law of February 1936 “to uncover and combat all tendencies and developments inimical to the state and to take for this end all measures deemed necessary and expedient.”4 Strictly speaking, S-21 was an interrogation and torture facility rather than a prison. Although people were confined and punished there, no one was ever released. The facility served primarily as an anteroom to death. The two men who ran santebal reported directly to the collective leadership of DK, known as the Upper Organization (angkar loeu), the Organization (angkar), or the “upper brothers”(bong khang loeu) to outsiders and as the Party Center (mochhim pak) or leading apparatus (kbal masin) to members of the CPK. The Party Center was the nerve center of the country. Its membership altered over time, but its highest-ranking members, who were also those most directly concerned with the operations of S-21—Pol Pot, Nuon Chea, Ta Mok, Son Sen, and Khieu Samphan— remained members throughout the regime and, indeed, into the 1990s.5\n\nSecrecy at S-21 S-21’s task of defending the Party Center was given the highest priority by DK’s leaders. Speaking to sympathetic Danish visitors in July 1978,\n\nChandler_014_040_ch2 8/31/99 5:19 PM Page 16\n\n16\n\nS-21: A Total Institution\n\nthe Deputy Secretary of the CPK, Nuon Chea (“Brother Number Two”), explained: “The leadership apparatus must be defended at any price. If we lose members but retain the leadership, we can continue to win victories. . . . There can be no comparison between losing two or three leading cadres and 200–300 members. Rather the latter than the former. Otherwise the Party has no head and cannot lead the struggle.”6 The Party’s theoretical journal, Tung Padevat (Revolutionary Flags) had taken a similar position earlier in the year when an editorial had asserted, “If there is damage to the Center, the damage is big. . . . The leading apparati (kbal masin) must be defended absolutely. If we can defend them, we can defend everything else.”7 The existence of S-21, the location of the Party Center, and the identity of those inside it were closely guarded secrets. Talking to the Danes, Nuon Chea insisted that “it is secret work that is fundamental. We no longer use the terms ‘legal’ and ‘illegal’; we use the terms ‘secret’ and ‘open.’ Secret work is fundamental to all we do. . . . Only through secrecy can we be masters of the situation and win victory over the enemy who cannot find out who is who.”8 Secrecy was always fundamental at S-21. In mid-1976, when a prisoner managed to escape from S-21, a study document prepared at the prison viewed the incident with alarm: Secrecy was broken. The secrecy we had maintained for the last 3–4 months has been pierced. When there’s no secrecy, there can be no santebal, the term has lost its meaning. . . . If they were to escape they would talk about their confessions. The secrecy of santebal would be broken at exactly the point where it must not be broken.9\n\nSecrecy was maintained at S-21 by keeping outsiders away from the compound, clearing the neighborhood, limiting the distribution of the documents produced, burning papers instead of throwing them away, blindfolding prisoners when they were moved from place to place, and forbidding contact between the interrogation and document groups in the prison on the one hand and less privileged employees on the other. Guards were forbidden to talk to prisoners, and prisoners were forbidden to talk to one another. High-ranking prisoners were held and interrogated in buildings separate from the main complex. Finally, nearly all interrogations took place in buildings to the east of the compound, supposedly out of earshot of prisoners and personnel. An S-21 document from September 1976, setting up day and night guard rosters, noted that guards were not allowed to follow interrogators into interrogation rooms or to “open windows to look at enemies” being questioned.\n\nChandler_014_040_ch2 8/31/99 5:19 PM Page 17\n\nS-21: A Total Institution\n\n17\n\nMost brutally, secrecy about S-21 was maintained by killing nearly all the prisoners.10 S-21’s existence was known only to those who worked or were confined there, to a handful of high-ranking Party figures, and to cadres charged with santebal duties in the zones and sectors. When briefing their subordinates, Pol Pot, Nuon Chea, Son Sen, and Ta Mok—by 1978, Brothers One through Four—occasionally named important “enemies” who we know had already been interrogated at S-21 and had confessed to counterrevolutionary crimes. None of these statements, however, ever referred to S-21 or santebal by name. No documentary evidence survives to tell us when, why, by whom, and under what guidelines santebal was formally established. Predecessor units existed in the Khmer Rouge army during the Cambodian civil war (1970–1975); S-21’s immediate forebear, it seems, had operated in Sector 25 north of the capital from 1973 to 1975. The two men most intimately concerned with such operations at that time were Son Sen (1930–1997, alias Brother 89 and Khieu), a ranking military commander, and his subordinate, a former schoolteacher named Kang Keck Ieu (c.1942–, alias Duch), charged with security matters. Under DK, Son Sen was the deputy prime minister, responsible for defense and national security. Santebal was one of his responsibilities. Duch, who reported to him, was the commandant of S-21 itself.\n\nWorkers at S-21 S-21 had three main units: interrogation, documentation, and defense. A photography subunit operated within the documentation unit. Subunits operating within the defense unit, the largest at S-21, included one that guarded the prisoners, another that brought prisoners in and took them to be executed, a third that provided rudimentary medical services, and a fourth that was responsible for economic support. A helpful guide to the higher-ranking personnel at S-21 is an internal telephone directory containing forty-six names. It must have been prepared before November 1978, when one of the interrogators listed in it, Chea Mai, was arrested.11 The directory lists twenty-four names in a “hot” (kdau) section of the interrogation unit, fourteen in “documents,” five in a “separate” (administrative) category, and six others, probably also interrogators, in an unlabeled group. The titles that preceded names in the telephone directory paralleled the three-tiered ranking system that operated within the CPK, whereby Party\n\nChandler_014_040_ch2 8/31/99 5:19 PM Page 18\n\n18\n\nS-21: A Total Institution\n\nmembers progressed from belonging to the Communist Youth League (yuv’kok) through candidate membership (triem) to “full-rights” membership (penh set). The names in the directory proceed in seniority from eight people listed by their full names, with no ranking prefix, through ten whose revolutionary pseudonyms are prefixed with the word mit (friend or comrade), to nine whose pseudonyms appear with the prefix bong (older brother). The last category was reserved for people with the greatest authority. An even more respectful classification, ta (grandfather), was used for Duch in a few documents, even though he was only in his thirties. Freed from the “exploiting classes” of the past, CPK members and workers at the prison followed deferential rules that were as complex, hierarchical, and baffling as those they might have encountered on their first day of school or as Buddhist novice monks. The analogies are appropriate because Duch and his colleagues in the interrogation unit had been schoolteachers for many years, and nearly all the workers at the prison were males in their late teens and early twenties, just the age when many of them, in prerevolutionary times, would have spent some time as monks. Moreover, those in charge of the prison, like Buddhist monks, were accustomed as teachers to unquestioning respect. The discipline of S-21 was based on the memorization of rules; it induced reverence for authority and unquestioning obedience. The hierarchy of the names in the telephone directory suggests that Duch and his close associates were unwilling or unable to forsake the rankings and the deference that had marked prerevolutionary Khmer society and that the revolution had promised to overturn. Those beneath them might also have been reluctant to see the ranks abolished. The former guard Kok Sros, for example, recalled that on one occasion, “Duch told me I had done a good job, and I felt that he liked me. I was pretty sure from then on that I was going to survive, because I had been admired from above.”12 With the constraints of hierarchy in mind, we can examine the lives and characters of Son Sen and Duch before turning to the people in charge of the various units at the prison.\n\nSon Sen In 1975 Son Sen was a slender, bespectacled man in his mid-forties. Like DK’s foreign minister, Ieng Sary, he had been born into the Cambodian community in southern Vietnam, where his parents were prosperous landowners. After moving to Phnom Penh as a boy, Son Sen\n\nChandler_014_040_ch2 8/31/99 5:19 PM Page 19\n\nS-21: A Total Institution\n\n19\n\nsoon attracted attention for his academic talent. He received a scholarship for study in France in 1950, shortly after Saloth Sar (later known as Pol Pot) had been awarded one. As a student of philosophy and history in Paris, Son Sen joined the French Communist Party alongside Saloth Sar, Ieng Sary, and several other Khmer. Returning home in 1956, he embarked on a teaching career and became part of the clandestine Cambodian Communist movement. In the early 1960s he was the director of studies of the Pedagogical Institute attached to the University of Phnom Penh. He was dismissed from his post in 1962 for his anti-Sihanouk views but was allowed to continue teaching. In 1963, after Saloth Sar had been named secretary of a reconstituted Communist Party, Son Sen joined him on the newly formed, concealed central committee. In 1964 he was spirited out of the capital in the trunk of a Chinese diplomatic vehicle and joined Saloth Sar and a handful of others in a Vietnamese Communist military base known as “Office 100,” which moved back and forth across the CambodianVietnamese border in response to battle conditions in Vietnam.13 Son Sen did not return to Phnom Penh until April 1975. During his twelve years in the maquis he bonded with the men and women who would later make up the Party Center, several of whom he had known in France. When armed struggle against Sihanouk broke out in 1968, Son Sen became a field commander. He soon revealed a talent for battlefield operations. By early 1972, he was chief of the general staff. His colleagues in the Party sometimes found him peremptory and his point of view “bourgeois,”14 but by August 1975 he was given responsibility for Cambodia’s security and defense. His new responsibilities included santebal. Son Sen monitored its operations closely. He read and annotated many confessions from the prison and ran study sessions for S-21 cadres in which he discussed its goals, the interrogations, and the use of torture. Three sets of notes by S-21 officials from these sessions have survived. They suggest that Son Sen’s interest in history, cultivated in France, persisted into the DK era. Like many Cambodians born in Vietnam, Son Sen also seemed to find it easy (or prudent) to be stridently anti-Vietnamese.15 Many documents routed from S-21 to the Party Center passed through Son Sen’s hands, and dozens of memoranda addressed to him by Duch have survived. So have many of his replies. These display a schoolmasterish attention to detail and unflinching revolutionary zeal. Son Sen’s wife, Yun Yat (alias At), also a former teacher, worked closely with him and had access to some of the confessions.\n\nChandler_014_040_ch2 8/31/99 5:19 PM Page 20\n\n20\n\nS-21: A Total Institution\n\nIn 1975 and 1976, Son Sen worked hard to mold the regionally based units that had won the civil war into a national army. In 1977 and 1978, he took charge of the fighting with Vietnam and supervised the purges of “disloyal” cadres in the Eastern Zone. In the closing months of the regime, when the war went badly, he came under suspicion himself. Had the Vietnamese invasion been delayed, he might have been cut down by the “upper brothers” and by his own remorseless institution.16 However, Son Sen retained his balance and in 1979 resumed command of the Khmer Rouge military forces after their defeat. In the aftermath of the Paris Peace Accords in 1991 he emerged as the “public face” of the Khmer Rouge, but he faded from view when his superiors decided to stonewall the United Nations–sponsored national elections. He never regained his former status. In a brutal case of poetic justice Son Sen, his wife, Yun Yat, and a dozen of their dependents were murdered on Pol Pot’s orders in northern Cambodia in June 1997, accused of being “spies” for the Phnom Penh regime.17\n\nDuch Kang Keck Ieu (alias Duch), the commandant of S-21 throughout its operation, was born around 1942 into a poor Sino-Cambodian family in Kompong Chen (Kompong Thom). Like Son Sen, he attracted attention as a boy for his intellectual abilities. His mother, interviewed in 1980, said that her son’s head was “always in a book.” Aided by a local entrepreneur he earned a scholarship to the Lycée Sisowath. Specializing in mathematics, he ranked second in the national baccalauréat examinations in 1959. In those days, a classmate has recalled, he was a studious young man with no hobbies or political interests.18 For the next few years, he taught mathematics at the lycée in Kompong Thom. One of his former students later recalled that “he was known for the precision of his lectures as if he were copying texts from his mind onto the board.” One of his colleagues at the school, who taught biology, was an exceptionally tall, almost albino Cambodian named Mam Nay (alias Chan). Years later, when both men were members of the CPK, Duch invited him to head the interrogation unit at the prison. Duch and Chan emerge from the record as strict, fastidious, totally dedicated teachers—characteristics that they carried with them, to altered purposes, when they worked together at the prison.19 In 1964, Duch was rewarded with a posting to the Pedagogical Institute. Son Sen had already left. According to Duch’s Lycée Sisowath\n\nChandler_014_040_ch2 8/31/99 5:19 PM Page 21\n\nS-21: A Total Institution\n\n21\n\nclassmate, Nek Bun An, the young mathematician was drawn toward Communism by a group of Chinese exchange students enrolled to study Khmer at the University of Phnom Penh. Duch was inspired and politicized by these sharply focused, idealistic young men and women, all of whom were to play important roles in Sino-Cambodian relations during the DK era and beyond.20 After leaving the Institute, he taught briefly at Chhoeung Prey lycée in Kompong Cham, where he enrolled at least one of his students, Ky Suk Hy, into the revolutionary movement and was soon arrested as a “Communist” by Sihanouk’s police. He was held without trial for several months—a normal procedure for political prisoners at the time— but he managed to obtain his release through the intervention of his childhood patron. Soon after Sihanouk was overthrown, Kang Keck Ieu had gone into the maquis. In the early 1970s, known as Duch, he was in charge of security in Sector 33, north of Phnom Penh. A French ethnographer, François Bizot, was arrested by Communist guerrillas there in 1970. Duch interrogated Bizot repeatedly for two months, accusing him of being a CIA agent and making him write several detailed autobiographies before allowing him to go free. Bizot came away chastened by Duch’s fanaticism. In his view, “Duch believed Cambodians of differing viewpoints to be traitors and liars. He personally beat prisoners who would not tell the ‘truth.’”21 In 1973 Duch moved to Sector 25, north of Phnom Penh. His superior there was Sok Thuok (alias Von Vet), a Communist militant since the 1950s who was executed at S-21 in 1978. Sok Thuok’s deputy in 1973, charged with military affairs, was Son Sen, whose favorable attention Duch probably attracted at this time. Duch picked up his expertise in security matters as he went along; there is no evidence that he ever traveled abroad or received any training from foreign experts. He may well have developed his elaborate notions of treachery involving “strings of traitors” between 1972 and 1973, when a secret operation was set up by the Khmer Rouge to purge the socalled Hanoi Khmers—Cambodians who had come south in 1970 after years of self-imposed exile in North Vietnam, ostensibly to help the revolution. Hundreds of them were secretly arrested and put to death in 1973, after the Vietnamese had withdrawn the bulk of their troops from Cambodia. A few managed to escape to Vietnam after detention; and others were arrested after April 1975. Many were arrested in the Special Zone. The stealth and mercilessness of the campaign may have owed\n\nChandler_014_040_ch2 8/31/99 5:19 PM Page 22\n\n22\n\nS-21: A Total Institution\n\nsomething to Duch’s emerging administrative style. The campaign, indeed, foreshadowed the modus operandi of S-21.22 Santebal operations were transferred to the capital soon after the Khmer Rouge victory in April 1975, but for several months the entity went under the name of Office 15; annotations by Duch appear on documents emanating from this office.23 The earliest documents connecting Duch with S-21 date from October 1975. For the next six months or so, Duch divided his time between a santebal prison at Ta Khmau, south of the capital, and interrogation centers scattered throughout Phnom Penh. The Ta Khmau facility, code-named S-21 Kh, was located on the grounds of what had been Cambodia’s only psychiatric hospital.24 As the man in charge of S-21, Duch worked hard to control every aspect of its operations. His experiences and instincts from teaching were helpful. He was used to keeping records, ferreting out answers to problems, earning respect, and disciplining groups of people. He drove himself and his subordinates very hard. “He was strong. He was clear. He would do what he said,” the former guard Him Huy has recalled. Duch often frightened workers at the prison. When asked what kind of a man Duch was, another guard replied, “Ha! What kind of man? He was beyond reason [huos haet].” In this man’s view, Duch’s worst crime was not to have presided over the deaths of fourteen thousand prisoners, but to have allowed two of his own brothers-in-law to be brought to S-21 and put to death. “Duch never killed anyone himself,” the former guard recalled, but he occasionally drove out to the killing field at Choeung Ek to observe the executions.25 Duch’s neatly written queries and annotations, often in red ink, appear on hundreds of confessions. They frequently correct and denigrate what prisoners confessed, suggest beatings and torture, and urge interrogators to unearth the buried “truth” that the prisoners are hiding. Duch also summarized dozens of confessions, pointing out the links he perceived with earlier ones and suggesting fresh lines of inquiry. The most elaborate of his memoranda, written in 1978, was titled “The Last Plan”; it attempted to weave two years’ worth of confessions into a comprehensive, diachronic conspiracy that implicated the United States, the USSR, Taiwan, and Vietnam. Like the late James Jesus Angleton of the CIA, Duch was mesmerized by the idea of moles infiltrating his organization. As a mathematician, he enjoyed rationally pleasing models. “The Last Plan” was his chef d’oeuvre.26 Duch lived close to S-21 with his wife and their two young children, and he remained at the prison until the evening of 7 January 1979,\n\nChandler_014_040_ch2 8/31/99 5:19 PM Page 23\n\nS-21: A Total Institution\n\n23\n\nwhen he walked out of Phnom Penh and soon disappeared from sight. In 1996, no longer affiliated with the Khmer Rouge, Duch met some American evangelical missionaries in northwestern Cambodia and converted to Christianity. He was working as a medical orderly in April 1999 when a journalist discovered his past identity. Duch was later interviewed by Nate Thayer and spoke freely about his past before he was arrested by Cambodian police and imprisoned in Phnom Penh.27\n\nDuch’s Assistants Duch’s deputy (anuprotean) at S-21 was Khim Vat (alias Ho), a soldier in his mid-twenties who served concurrently as the head of the prison’s defense unit. Ho had been born and raised in Prek Touch, south of the capital, and had joined the revolutionary ranks as a teenager in 1966. Serving in the 11th (later the 703d) Division, he lost an eye in combat. His signature appears on many entry and execution lists. In 1978, he often joined forces with Chan to interrogate Vietnamese prisoners of war. Ho was a fierce disciplinarian feared by his subordinates. Kok Sros recalled: I was scared of him. If I looked him in the face he looked mean, and if he gave us instructions and we made a mistake he would beat us. If we said something wrong, he beat us. We had to be careful when we spoke; whatever we said had to be to the point. I knew he was strict, so I was always careful.28\n\nNothing is known of Ho’s career after 1979. His deputy, Peng, hailed from the same district as Ho and had served with him in Division 703. Peng, a Sino-Khmer, had been born in 1950. At S-21 he commanded the guards. He also kept track of arriving prisoners and assigned them to rooms and cells. According to Khieu Lohr, a former guard, Peng had “keys to all the cells.” He reported to Duch, who decided whether prisoners were to be interrogated, ignored, or taken off to be killed. Peng accompanied Duch on his tours of the prison and acted as his bodyguard. Vann Nath was so frightened of Peng, whom he called a “brutal young butcher,” that he “never dared to look him in the eye.” Ung Pech, in his testimony at the trial of Pol Pot and Ieng Sary in 1979, called Peng “savage and cruel,” adjectives not applied to any other S-21 employee at the trial. Peng seems to have been demoted in 1978, when his duties were taken over by Him Huy, but, according to Kok Sros, Peng survived the Vietnamese invasion and died in southwestern Cambodia in the 1980s.29\n\nChandler_014_040_ch2 8/31/99 5:19 PM Page 24\n\n24\n\nS-21: A Total Institution\n\nAfter Duch, Ho, and Peng, the most important person at S-21 was probably Chan, who headed the interrogation unit. Aside from his stint of teaching in the 1950s, we know nothing about his early life, although his fluency in Vietnamese, rare among Cambodians, suggests that he was born and raised in Vietnam. He arrived at S-21 with Duch in 1975 and remained there until the Vietnamese invasion. In 1990, he was still working with the Khmer Rouge as an interrogator. Nate Thayer, who saw him questioning prisoners at that time, recalled that Chan “was the most frightening-looking character” he had ever seen. When sighted again by an United Nations official in 1996, Chan was semi-retired and engaged in market gardening.30 Chan’s deputy was another former mathematics teacher, Tang Sin Hean (alias Pon), a Sino-Khmer from Sector 25 who had served under Duch during the civil war. He was already working for santebal by July 1975. In a self-criticism session at the prison in December 1976, he deplored his “middle bourgeois” class background, confessed that he was often “individualistic” in his thinking, and admitted that because he worked so hard on santebal matters he had failed to “build himself” or learn as much as he should have done from the “masses.” The document closed with warm testimonials about his performance at S-21 from Chan and Duch.31 Pon interrogated many prominent prisoners, including Keo Meas, Ney Saran, Hu Nim, Tiv Ol, and Phouk Chhay. Several documents signed by Pon and attached to these interrogations propose extensive torture. At a biweekly self-criticism meeting held at the prison in 1978, staff claimed to be “frightened” of Pon, who criticized himself for not “following the masses,” probably a euphemism for his top-down, authoritarian style.32 The documents unit (krom akkesa), closely linked to the interrogations unit, was headed in 1977 and 1978 by Suos Thi, a former soldier in his mid-twenties who came from the same district as Ho and Peng. Suos Thi had “joined the revolution” (choul padevat) in August 1971. He had served with Ho in Division 703 before coming to S-21 in November 1975. In his self-critical autobiography Suos Thi claimed that he had become a revolutionary because he was “angry about imperialism, privilege, and capitalism that exploited poor people.” Among his “shortcomings,” he admitted that he “enjoyed going to movies,” “liked to laugh,” “quarreled with his siblings,” and “got angry quickly.” Among his virtues, he said, was a “willingness to perform any\n\nChandler_014_040_ch2 8/31/99 5:19 PM Page 25\n\nS-21: A Total Institution\n\n25\n\ntasks for the Party.” He survived into the 1990s, when he was twice interviewed by journalists. Asked if he “regretted” working at S-21, he said that he was “very sorry for the killings, for the children and women. In fact, some of the people weren’t guilty at all.” At another point in the interview, he was more laconic. “When they gave you a job,” he said, “you had to do it.”33 In the “separate” category in the telephone directory, listed with Duch, Pon, and Chan, appears the name of “Brother Huy.” Two men with this name were working at S-21 in 1978. The one named in the directory was probably Him Huy, a self-described “lower-middle” peasant from Sector 25 who became a Khmer Rouge soldier in 1972 because, he wrote in his self-critical autobiography, he was “sick of capitalism and privilege.” Serving under Ho, he had been wounded in the final assault on Phnom Penh. He came to S-21 in early 1977 as a guard, and in 1978 he took charge of documenting prisoners entering the facility and those executed at Choeung Ek, duties previously carried out by Peng. In late 1978 Huy was put in charge of security matters at the prison, placing him fifth or sixth in the chain of command. “After they killed all the [other] bosses,” he told Peter Maguire, “they promoted me.”34 In many interviews with journalists and scholars since 1985, Him Huy has admitted that he drove truckloads of prisoners to Choeung Ek and also killed “several” prisoners there. He claims that he was imprisoned after 1979 for “a year” for these offenses. Vann Nath, however, remembers Huy as a “very cruel” member of the assassination squad that accompanied prisoners to Choeung Ek. Another survivor said that Huy had been responsible for “hundreds” of deaths. These grim views were echoed by Nhem En and others interviewed by a British journalist in Phnom Penh in 1997. In interviews Huy has often stressed his repentance, remarking at one point, “I don’t feel that [working at S-21] is what my parents intended me to do.”35 The second Huy at S-21, Nun Huy, was nicknamed “Tall Huy” (Huy k’puh) or “Rice field Huy” (Huy srae). He ran Office 24, the prison farm at Prey So affiliated with S-21. In the hierarchy of the prison, he was an important figure. In 1976, for example, he supervised some study sessions for Communist Youth Group members working at the prison. His wife, Prak Khoeun, a “full-rights” member of the CPK, worked as a part-time interrogator at S-21. The two were arrested in November 1978. Nhem En claimed that Huy was arrested for sexual offenses, but his confession does not mention these.36\n\nChandler_014_040_ch2 8/31/99 5:19 PM Page 26\n\n26\n\nS-21: A Total Institution\n\nThe Interrogators In November 1976, the interrogation division consisted of at least eleven six-man interrogation groups. These evolved into ten six-person units by mid-1977, which were further divided into three-man teams, led by a unit supervisor. Each team included a chief, an annotatordeputy, and a third member, in the manner of Communist Party cells and other triadic organizations throughout DK. The third member, sometimes referred to as a guard, may have been the person assigned to inflict torture. By 1978, most interrogators worked in a “hot” (kdau) contingent. This was directed by a senior interrogator, Pu, about whom no biographical data have come to light. In 1976 and 1977 there had also been a “gentle” (slout) subunit, whose members were apparently prohibited from using torture. The “hot” subunit was referred to in one confession as the “cruel” (kach) contingent. Its members were allowed to torture prisoners. In 1978, the “gentle” group was no longer mentioned in confessions, although it may have been replaced by a “cool” (trocheak) unit. An eight-person “chewing” (angkiem) unit under Prak Nan, an experienced interrogator, dealt with tough, important cases.37 In 1977 and 1978, it seems that at least one interrogator, Prak Khoeun, the wife of “Rice-field” Huy, was a woman. Prak Khoeun came from Sector 25 and classified herself as a “lower-middle peasant.” She had joined the revolution in 1972, she wrote, because she was angered by the “way the power-holding classes exploited and looked down on poor peasants.” Having transferred to S-21 in 1977 after marrying “Rice-field” Huy, she admitted torturing “several” prisoners “until they couldn’t function.” There may have been other female interrogators at the prison. Ung Pech remembered one whom he nicknamed “the Monster” (a-yeak), and the archive reveals that Kun, who was the wife of a senior Khmer Rouge cadre and arrested with him at the end of 1978, was interrogated by two women, Li and Kon. On the other hand, Kok Sros, interviewed in 1997, could recall no women regularly employed to question prisoners.38 Most of the interrogators and document workers had fought in the 1970–1975 war, often serving as messengers (nir’sa)—a perilous, respected job. In most cases, their education had been limited to a few years in rural primary schools or sojourns in Buddhist wats, where a premium was placed on memorization, obedience, and neat calligraphy, all virtues in demand at S-21. However, the transitions from schooling to warfare to S-21, where political acuity was also prized, were often difficult for these young men, as the ex-interrogator Ma Meng Kheang confessed:\n\nChandler_014_040_ch2 8/31/99 5:19 PM Page 27\n\nS-21: A Total Institution\n\n27\n\nIt’s difficult to think so much. You get so tired [at S-21] and you get headaches, and besides, it’s a political place, it’s not easy to work there, it’s different from rice or vegetable farming or working in a factory. You never know when the day is finished. You never know if you are “correct.” With farming, on the other hand, you either have a crop or you don’t, in a factory a machine starts up or it doesn’t.39\n\nThe hours for interrogators were long, and the work was exhausting. Questioning often extended far into the night. Interrogators resented the conditions under which they were forced to work and sometimes compared them unfavorably to the relative freedom they had enjoyed as soldiers in the civil war.40\n\nThe Documentation Workers The telephone directory lists fourteen men in the documentation unit, but it was undoubtedly larger than that, and those listed were probably in charge of three-man teams. The unit was responsible for transcribing tape-recorded confessions, typing handwritten ones, preparing summaries of confessions, and maintaining the prison’s voluminous files. Unsurprisingly, given what we know of the consequences for “sabotage” in DK, typographical errors are almost nonexistent. Even so, between 1976 and 1978 at least ten documents unit staff were arrested, interrogated, and put to death. They confessed to being “lazy,” preparing “confused” documents, “ruining” machines, and beating prisoners to death when they assisted with interrogations.41 The photography subunit at S-21 operated under the supervision of Suos Thi. People in this group took mug shots of prisoners when they arrived, pictures of prisoners who died in captivity, and pictures of important prisoners after they were killed. According to Nhem En, who worked in the subunit, photographs in this final category were taken by specially selected cadres (the prisoners’ throats had been cut) and forwarded in single copies to the “upper brothers.” The unit also produced identification photographs of the staff. Over six thousand photographs taken by the unit have survived. Hundreds of the mug shots, selected and enlarged by East German photographers in 1981, have been posted on the walls of the Tuol Sleng Museum since 1980.42 The photography subunit used cameras, film, paper, and developing chemicals that they discovered at various locations in the capital. Nhem En, who defected from the Khmer Rouge in 1996, was interviewed several times. En was a peasant boy from Kompong Cham who joined the\n\nChandler_014_040_ch2 8/31/99 5:19 PM Page 28\n\n28\n\nS-21: A Total Institution\n\nKhmer Rouge forces in 1970, when he was ten years old. He was selected to study photography in China in 1975 and 1976 and then came to work at S-21. Five Khmer worked with him in the photography unit, and one of them was purged. En himself came under suspicion in a December 1977 study session for “playing the radio” and “taking bad photographs”—offenses he recalled spontaneously twenty years later. One of his photographs, developed from a negative processed during Pol Pot’s visit to China in October 1977, appeared to show “Brother Number One” with an unseemly blotch above one eye. Chan accused Em of doctoring the photo to insult Pol Pot, and Em was packed off to the “reeducation office” (munthi kay pray) at Prey So. In early 1978 he was released, he says, after Chan had found the flaw in the original, Chinese negative.43\n\nThe Guards The defense unit, not included in the telephone directory, was the largest at the prison. In 1978 it had 169 members: 127 assigned to the main facility and the rest attached to the “special prison” to the south reserved for high-ranking cadres. In 1976 and 1977 guards were organized into six four-hour shifts a day, but in 1978 guards worked in ten-man units for eight-hour shifts. They were expected to follow a set of thirty rules designed to keep them alert and to prevent them from fraternizing with prisoners. The rules enjoined them to keep prisoners from escaping, obtaining weapons, attempting suicide, or talking to each other.44 Guards were not allowed to talk to prisoners, to learn their names, or to beat them, but as a former guard admitted in his confession, “If you’re on guard at night, you can beat the prisoners without anyone noticing it.” Kok Sros has recalled that while guards were forbidden to beat prisoners, only those who beat them “severely” were punished. Moreover, “If a prisoner didn’t obey our orders, we had authority to beat them.” As for casual chatting, which inevitably took place, Kok Sros went on to say that we could talk to them, but we weren’t allowed to pity them. . . . Some of them asked us to release them, but if we did that we would take their place. Some of the prisoners said, “I didn’t do anything wrong, why did the Organization bring me here?” I didn’t know what to do. . . . I told them I was afraid to help them.45\n\nGuards were also forbidden to observe or eavesdrop on interrogations, and they were expected to be constantly alert: “While on duty,” an S-21\n\nChandler_014_040_ch2 8/31/99 5:19 PM Page 29\n\nS-21: A Total Institution\n\n29\n\nregulation reads, “[guards] must not sneak naps or sit down or lean against the wall. They should [always] be walking, guarding, examining things carefully.” Guards seldom had enough sleep. In their selfcritical autobiographies, they overwhelmingly list “drowsiness”(ngok nguy) as the greatest flaw affecting their work. Elaborate routines governed the disposal of weapons and ammunition and the disposition of prisoners’ chains, shackles, and locks. There were also complex procedures for transferring prisoners from their cells to interrogation sessions and between cells and the trucks that took them to Choeung Ek.46 Rules for guards prohibited humane behavior. High spirits and levity in the contingent also worried those in charge. A self-criticism document prepared at the prison in 1977 accused some guards of “laughing together in their free time” and “lacking a firm revolutionary stance.” The same “offenses” crop up in the self-critical autobiographies that the guards prepared from time to time and also in guards’ confessions.47 Nhem En has recalled friendly rough-housing with his colleagues in the photography group, and Kok Sros has referred warmly to the friendships he developed in his three years of working at the prison. None of this is surprising, when we recall that many of the workers were rural teenagers unaccustomed to any kind of institution, much less one where laughter was viewed as a “shortcoming.”\n\nAn Evening at S-21 In the early days of the prison the rules for guards were apparently more relaxed. A night-watch report from October 1976, which suggests as much, is the only surviving document recording conversations between guards and prisoners. This report provides a rare glimpse of prisoners and guards in relatively humane interaction and also records some examples of prisoners’ courage and resistance, sadly lacking from most of their torture-induced confessions.48 summary sent to the older brother in charge of the guard group I.

That’s what Mau Hung said to one of our fellow guards. —Building Kh, room 5, cell 10, when the guard asked the prisoner Som Saravuth to stretch, the prisoner claimed to be unable to rise, but when the guard left his room he stood up.\n\nSubunits at the Prison Three subunits and the prison farm at Prey So operated under the aegis of the defense unit. One of the subunits included eight “capturers” (sometimes called “messengers,” or nir’sa) and ten in a “motorized section.” According to Nhem En, the “capturers” accompanied prisoners to S-21 from the countryside and executed them all, including important cadres, who were killed and buried near the prison. Nhem En’s memory is corroborated by Kok Sros. In 1977, Him Huy worked in this unit and earned a fearsome reputation among other members of the staff. A “motorized section” drove batches of prisoners into S-21 and conveyed others to the execution grounds at Choeung Ek. A twenty-six person “economic support” subunit, affiliated with the defense unit, provided food and custodial services for guards, interrogators, and prisoners. Two of its members were barbers, and five others were responsible for raising chickens, rabbits, pigs, ducks, and vegetables within the compound. Four “excrement bearers” in the unit provided a plumbing and sewage system of sorts. The duty was given to guards as a punishment for minor infractions.49 Excrement was removed in buckets from the prison and used for fertilizer. Seven employees in the economic support unit prepared and delivered food for a prison population that averaged a thousand or more for most of 1977 and 1978. Six others performed the same task for less\n\nChandler_014_040_ch2 8/31/99 5:19 PM Page 31\n\nS-21: A Total Institution\n\n31\n\nthan a hundred interrogators and document workers, and thirteen more took care of perhaps two hundred guards. In Duch’s report on the prison in the first three months of 1977, he takes seven lines to deplore the deaths of ducks and chickens at the prison and only two lines to report fourteen prisoners’ deaths from torture. In the looking-glass world of S-21, ducks were mourned more than people.50 Rice for S-21 and probably for other units in the capital was grown at Prey So. In the DK era, men and women were sent there from units, factories, and work sites in Phnom Penh for minor offenses or pending transfer to Tuol Sleng. In the first ten months of 1977, according to a document prepared by “Rice-field” Huy, over two thousand prisoners passed through Prey So. One hundred ninety-two of them, “mostly under twenty years of age,” a report from the facility asserted, had died of “illness.” Eighty had managed to escape. All but twenty-seven of these were recaptured and sent on to S-21. Some of the remaining prisoners listed in the document were probably also sent along to S-21, whereas others—Nhem En and Him Huy among them—returned to duty at S-21 after serving short sentences at Prey So.51 Ho’s defense unit also supervised the work of fifteen paramedical personnel who treated sick prisoners undergoing interrogation, patched up those who had been severely beaten, and certified deaths. One of the paramedics, Phoung Damrei (alias Phoeun), complained in his confession that there were only three trained medical personnel at S-21 to deal with thousands of prisoners. It was “impossible” to treat them, he said, and large numbers of them died. The man in charge of the detachment, Pheng Tri, was later arrested himself and made a similar admission at a study session in 1977, whereupon he was reproved by Chan for “not believing in revolutionary medicine.” Prison records list prisoners as succumbing to malaria, diarrhea, “emaciation,” “tiredness,” and mistreatment. In a document listing twenty-one deaths in a short period, five are attributed to “wounds” and one to “torture, suffocated inside a plastic bag.” Fifty-two prisoners are said to have died of “illness” between April and September 1976, a period when the prison housed less than 300 people at any one time, and a cadre notebook from 1977 recorded that 30 deaths had occurred at the prison in July, 88 in September, 49 in October, and 67 in November, making a total of 234 deaths over four months. Many those who died had already been worn down by wounds, malnutrition, and torture; several photographs of corpses in the archive show that they were all severely undernourished.52\n\nChandler_014_040_ch2 8/31/99 5:19 PM Page 32\n\n32\n\nS-21: A Total Institution\n\nSeveral medical study notebooks were recovered at S-21, but the teachers, students, and locations of the medical lessons are unknown. A pocket-sized notebook discovered near the prison suggests that bizarre experiments were sometimes carried out by prison personnel. These included bleeding prisoners to death and seeing how long dead bodies took to rise to the surface of a tank of water. Elsewhere in the country, fatal surgery was sometimes carried out on anaesthetized prisoners to teach anatomy to medical cadres. It is possible that experiments of this kind were also conducted on prisoners at S-21 and hardly surprising if the records have not survived.53\n\nProfile of Prison Personnel What kinds of people worked in the units at the prison? Duch, Chan, and Pon were Sino-Cambodians in their thirties who had worked as schoolteachers; the senior interrogators Pu and Tuy probably came from similar backgrounds. Most of their subordinates at S-21 were young ethnic Khmer from rural areas. Before joining the revolution in the civil war they had been students in primary school, apprentice monks, or helpers on their parents’ farms. Hardly any had lived in cities or worked for pay. Of some 166 S-21 employees who completed biographical statements in 1976 when they came to work at the prison, 44 classified themselves as “poor peasants,” 99 as “lower middle peasants,” 16 as “middle peasants,” 1 as a “worker,” and 6 as “petty bourgeois.” Five of the latter had been students when they joined the revolutionary ranks; the sixth had been a teacher. Allowing for a male gender bias in the sample, the profile of workers at S-21 replicated the class structure of prerevolutionary rural Khmer society, in which the vast majority of rural families owned land, and would have been categorized as “middle” peasants.54 The Khmer Rouge, like its counterpart in Mao’s China, made virtues of inexperience and ignorance, preferring young people who were, in Mao’s phrase, “poor and blank” to those corrupted by capitalism or extensive schooling. In praising the “poor and blank” Mao asserted that “a sheet of blank paper carries"
