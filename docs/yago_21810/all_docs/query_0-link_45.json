The documents are published by the Council of Ministers in a non-searchable, PDF format — hundreds of scanned images of verbose decisions at a time.\n\nThe Gazetteer is indexing these documents for search, and highlighting the key decisions within each release. See which businessperson newly received an “oknha” title for making large donations to the state, or who received a medal for donations to a pagoda. Find hundreds of government appointments and promotions, and the occasional retirement. And don’t forget to search for individuals or companies given reclassified public land.\n\nStart typing in the search box below or use the categories to narrow your search. Try multiple search terms, and improve your results by using Khmer-language spellings for the names of individuals or companies. Click on the link to see the original document in Khmer, keeping in mind that entries in The Gazetteer are only short summaries and use unofficial translations."
