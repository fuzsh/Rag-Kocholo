“Martinete” as a flamenco style is composed by a singing with four eight-syllabe verse "couplet".

It is considered as a form of “toná”, which is the same as it happens with “carcelera”, whose origins is in ironworks or forges. Its lyrics are sad and monotone and end with long "quejíos". For being a “toná”, it is sung without guitar accompaniment, although it is sometimes accompanied with the sounds of the forge, like a hammer hitting metal.
