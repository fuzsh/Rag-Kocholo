        "text": "Vicente Escudero (born Oct. 27, 1892, Valladolid, Spain—died Dec. 4, 1980, Barcelona) was a Gypsy dancer widely respected for his mastery of flamenco dance and for his adherence throughout his public career to an authentic style rarely distorted or commercialized.\n\nKnown in his youth for his dancing in the cafés of Spain, Escudero performed in Paris in 1920 with his longtime partner Carmita Garcia at the Olympia Theatre. From 1922 to 1932 he toured widely in Europe, dancing with Anna Pavlova in 1931, and in 1932 he first danced in the United States. He appeared as Carmelo in La Argentina’s production of the ballet El amor brujo (Madrid, Teatro Español, 1934). In 1954 he returned to Paris, and he toured the United States later that year, in 1959, and in 1961. He then retired from dancing, although he continued lecturing on flamenco."
