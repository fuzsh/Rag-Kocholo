A searchable guide to these and other performances is at nytimes.com/events.\n\n★ American Ballet Theater (through July 4) At Monday night’s anniversary gala, American Ballet Theater proudly looks back at its remarkable 75-year history. Excerpts from nearly two dozen ballets will be performed, representing a Who’s Who of 20th-century dance luminaries, from Fokine and DeMille to Tharp and MacMillan, and more. Tuesday brings the first of four performances of Lar Lubovitch’s sumptuous “Othello” (through Thursday). This weekend, the company concludes its “Classic ABT” mixed-bill program, which includes Robbins’s “Fancy Free,” Balanchine’s “Theme and Variation” and two by Tudor. Monday’s gala is at 6:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, 212-362-6000. Complete schedule: abt.org. (Brian Schaefer)\n\nKimberly Bartosik and Dylan Crossman (Wednesday through May 23) In 2008, Kimberly Bartosik introduced the first and second chapters of her “Ecsteriority” project, a meditation on decay. “Ecsteriority3” appeared in 2011 — a six-hour marathon — and now she completes the cycle with “Ecsteriority4 (Part 2),” for an all-star trio of Dylan Crossman, Marc Mann and Melissa Toogood. Mr. Crossman contributes a solo to the second part of the evening, part of the Abrons Arts Center’s Travelogues series. His work, “Bound,” considers that emotional seesaw of freedom and constraint. At 8 p.m., 466 Grand Street, at Pitt Street, Lower East Side, 866-811-4111, abronsartscenter.org. (Schaefer)\n\nBC Beat (Monday) Even on their night off, Broadway gypsies are drawn to the stage. Cast members from Broadway’s biggest shows — “An American in Paris,” “Aladdin,” “On the Town” — perform and share their own choreography in this biannual showcase of innovative musical theater dance. With the help of 40 professional dancers, nine choreographers push the genre into new territory. Imagine all of the rollicking showstoppers, with none of the stagnant ballads. At 7 p.m., Cielo, 18 Little West 12th Street, West Village, 646-543-8556, bcbeat.net. (Schaefer)\n\nBodystories: Teresa Fellion Dance (Thursday through May 23) In the title of Teresa Fellion’s new work, “The Mantises Are Flipping W.3,” the “W” stands for “world,” and this is the third one she’s created in her Mantises series. The project started as a solo, but this world is populated by seven dancers who are charged with expressing a variety of unrelated but interconnected themes: the nature of opposites, sanity and insanity, how sound moves through and around the body, and the mental effects of isolation. At 8 p.m., Danspace Project, St. Mark’s Church, 131 East 10th Street, East Village, 866-811-4111, danspaceproject.org. (Schaefer)\n\n★ Flamenco Vivo Carlota Santana (Tuesday through May 24) This New York-based company, which has been championing flamenco for more than 30 years, presents three new works by Spanish choreographers. Ángel Muñoz’s “Angeles,” with a cast of 10 dancers and musicians, finds angels in myths and music; Enrique Vicent and Antonio López unleash the beautiful agony of flamenco’s dark side in “Martinete-Seguiriya”; and Guadalupe Torres offers a moving solo called “Ausencia.” Additional company repertory rounds out two separate programs. Tuesday through Friday at 7:30 p.m., Saturday at 2 and 7:30 p.m., Sunday at 2 p.m., Fishman Space, Fisher Building, Brooklyn Academy of Music, 321 Ashland Place, near Lafayette Avenue, Fort Greene, 718-636-4100, bam.org.
