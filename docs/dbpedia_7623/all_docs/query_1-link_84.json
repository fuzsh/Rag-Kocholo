        "text": "This journey has not been short or easy, and I have to tell you that it has taken me 35 years of my life. That’s why I want to emphasize that the knowledge and experience I have gained will not be shared with just anyone because, as I mentioned earlier, time is the most valuable thing to me. I genuinely mean it.\n\nIf you consider yourself a truly committed person, if you want to accelerate your learning process while solidifying each acquired knowledge, and if you feel that I am the person who can help you achieve your goal or dream, whatever you may call it, then the doors of my heart will be wide open to you because I am willing to give my all.\n\nBut if you’re unable to dedicate a considerable amount of time to internalize all the acquired material, you won’t progress at the pace you expect. Commitment, discipline, and patience are crucial to achieving any goal in life.\n\nI also have to allocate time to concerts and my family. That’s why sometimes I can’t study many other things that I’m passionate about, such as photography, cinema, neuroscience, marketing, or the world of finance. That’s why I offer the option for both in-person and online students to record the classes, so they can watch them whenever they want and review the material at any time.\n\nI won’t deny that you can learn some aspects of flamenco on YouTube, but I can assure you that you’ll progress much slower, taking years of study and learning, and with the uncertainty of whether you’re learning it correctly. Trying to masquerade( disfrazarse) as a self-taught individual may bring you more frustration than satisfaction."
