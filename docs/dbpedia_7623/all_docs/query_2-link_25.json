As the rest of the songs in this group, it is sung normally with no accompaniment, though for dance percussion played to the compás of siguiriya accompanies it. The percussion instruments chosen for this are frequently a hammer and anvil, to evocate the origins of this palo, attributed to Gypsy smiths. The subject matters of the martinet often contain allusions to persecution, prison, and the environment of the forges.\n\nWords from the Choreographer:\n\n\"Por el Camino\"… ya que es a través del tiempo y los caminos que uno va aprendiendo y creando con las experiencias vividas…"
