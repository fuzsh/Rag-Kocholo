        "text": "El Martinete, a storied mansion on southern Spain’s Costa del Sol, is alive with its glamorous past. Located along the Mediterranean Sea in Marbella, an international tourist destination in the Andalusia area, the estate occupies a prime spot on what is known as the Golden Mile―a stretch of waterfront second and third villas close to five-star hotels and golf courses. Nearby is the luxury marina Puerto Banus.\n\nEmbellishing old-world charm with modern amenities, the property has long been a hot spot for the Hollywood jet set. The original owner and designer of the mansion was Antonio “El Bailarin” Ruiz Soler, a famous flamenco dancer known for the percussive martinete (hammer) style from which the estate takes its name.\n\nHis time touring the world and making films in Los Angeles endeared him to such stars as Ava Gardner and Vivien Leigh, who were among his visitors. Pablo Picasso was so taken with El Bailarin that he immortalized the dancer in a drawing called “La Danza.” The bird logo is set in the tiles of the mansion’s swimming pool.\n\nToday, ownership in the mostly old-money neighborhood is turning over gradually.\n\n“There are properties that have been in the families for one or two generations,” says Jose Ribes Bas of Inmobiliaria Rimontgo. “Those that have been sold in recent years have gone to a buyer with a younger, business profile.”\n\nBuilt in 1965, the gated property of more than 4,000 square meters (about an acre) includes the villa, guest houses, staff quarters and gardens. A gate beyond the pool leads to a seaside walkway and the beach.\n\nThe cavernous foyer of the main house is awash in baroque details with gilded columns, marble floors and a central chandelier. Such architectural flourishes continue in the formal drawing room, where French doors open to a covered terrace above the pool.\n\nAmong other lavish main-floor living areas are a lounge with a fireplace, dining room that can seat up to 20 people and modern kitchen divided into two parts. One serves as a family kitchen for everyday use and the other for entertaining and putting on a show.\n\nMarble stairs and an elevator lead to the second-floor bedroom suites. The 120-square-meter (nearly 1,300-square-foot) primary suite contains a sitting room, two bathrooms and a dressing room.\n\nThe lower level of the villa features a bar with wine storage and a lounge adjacent to a car turntable, providing space for up to four vehicles. There’s also a spa with an indoor heated swimming pool, sauna, shower, bar area, gym and another lounge with a gas fireplace.\n\nThe rooftop deck is equipped with a barbecue center and outdoor kitchen.\n\nIncluding the three guest/staff houses there are a total of 10 bedrooms and 10 bathrooms throughout the 2,145 square meters (more than 23,000 square feet) of living space.\n\nThe asking price is available on request.\n\n“Due to the unique nature of waterfront properties in Marbella, prices can vary greatly and are set by the owners,” Ribes Bas says. “Given that we are dealing with a primarily second home market where owners don't need to sell, prices for unique properties (such as waterfront) do not abide by ‘market prices’ but, rather, by that which a seller is willing to sell for.”\n\nRecent Golden Mile sales have been in the €9 million range [approximately USD 9.8 million] for a smaller villa on an 800-square-meter (8,600-square-foot) plot, he says, to around €12 million [approximately USD 13.1 million] for a more substantial property in need of refurbishment.\n\nThat said, there is a very limited supply of waterfront villas, says Ribes Bas, who envisions a buyer potentially coming from Northern Europe or the Middle East. “It’s rare for a mansion of this caliber to come on the market.”"
