Flamenco is a Spanish musical genre and style of dance that originated in Andalusia. It has complex origins incorporating influences from various cultures including Andalusian, Romani, Sephardic Jewish, Byzantine, Moorish, and Latin American traditions. While flamenco's roots are uncertain, it is acknowledged to have developed from the intermingling of cultures in Andalusia prior to and after the Reconquest. Flamenco spread from its origins in Lower Andalusia and incorporated influences from other Spanish musical styles as it gained popularity elsewhere in Spain. It remains closely associated with Andalusian culture while also fusing with other genres over time.",
