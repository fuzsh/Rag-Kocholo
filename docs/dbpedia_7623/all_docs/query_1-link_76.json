        "text": "Jerez de la Frontera is synonymous with flamenco. Pronounced flaˈmeŋko, it is a musical genre originating in the South of Spain with the Andalucian gypsies (gitanos). Flamenco, documented in the literature as early as 1774, is comprised of cante (song), baile (dance) and toque (guitar playing). Other elements of flamenco include palmas (rhythmic clapping), pitas (finger snapping), raping fingers or knuckles on a table top to create percussion and rhythm, and jaleo (shouts of encouragement and approval), which usually accompany flamenco performances and can originate from the audience or from the performers on stage.\n\nNo longer exclusive to the gitanos of the Andalucía, flamenco has been embraced by many cultures worldwide, and its popularity has grown immensely. In some countries such as Japan, there are more flamenco schools than there are in Spain. In November 2010, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), declared flamenco as a World Heritage Treasure ― one of the Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity.\n\nFlamenco: Cante (song), baile (dance), toque (guitar)…and pintura (painting)?\n\nWhile cante is the backbone of flamenco, baile and toque are what many people identify with when they hear “flamenco”. But there is more to flamenco than just the fiery dance with percussive footwork to the strumming of a guitar…\n\nCante (song)\n\nCante or flamenco song is the centerpiece of authentic Andalucian gypsy flamenco, which guides both dance and guitar. For years, cante, which began among the gypsies, was heard only in the southern Andalucia – Triana (Seville), Cádiz, Jerez, etc. There are over 50 distinct flamenco palos (styles), some are more common than others. Palos are divided into three categories: cante jondo (profound or deep song; also referred to as cante grande, important song), which is the most serious (e.g. caña, martinete, siguiriyas, solea); cante chico (light song), which includes lighter, cheerful forms (e.g. alegrias, bulerias, fandangos); and cante intermedio, (which falls between cante jondo and cante chico) (e.g. farruca, granaina, malagueña, petenera, tangos, tientos). Palos are classified based on elements such as their rhythmic pattern, structure of the verses (letras) of the songs, harmonic chord progression of the guitar, and measure (or scale) as well as geographic origin (e.g. Fandangos de Huelva, Alegrias de Cadiz, Bulerias de Jerez, etc.). Not all palos, however, will have their origin specified in their name, but rather one would recognize the structure of the letras, its rhythmic pattern, and other identifiable elements characteristic to a specific palo. Sevillanas, although technically not flamenco, but rather folk dances that have been incorporated into a flamenco repertoire ― are sung and danced with or without the castanets (castanuelas) ― and are popular during Ferias.\n\nBaile (dance)\n\nThe main feature of flamenco dance is the percussive sound made by stamping with the heel (taconeo), toe (punta), and the sole (zapateado) of the shoe. Performed now by both men and women, zapateado was traditionally performed only by men, while women danced mainly with the arms, hands and shoulders. While flamenco baile was originally purely improvisational solos, danced to any of the aforementioned palos in an intimate atmosphere, today flamenco companies put on choreographed spectacles, both solos and group numbers, intended for a large stage in a modern theatre.\n\nToque (guitar)\n\nToque (guitar) is the instrument most identifiable with flamenco… Sabicas, Moraito Chico, Paco de Lucia, Tomatito, Paco Peña, Paco Cepero…the list of great flamenco guitarists past and present goes on and on…A serendipitous meeting with one of flamenco guitar greats, and a Jerez native, Paco Cepero, occurred in a most unlikely place…a shoe repair shop ― a regular pit stop on his daily dog-walking route. Not only that I told him that I love his music, and listen to it all the time, I showed him scrolling track after track of his music both on my BlackBerry and digital music player, as well as a ringtone on my phone and alarm. I even played the alarm setting on my BlackBerry to his “Serenata Andaluza” (one of my favourites). Undoubtedly, I proved that I was an authentic diehard fan! He then told me of his new work “Suite Gades”, which I bought later, and he subsequently signed it for me (below).\n\nPintura (painting)?\n\nSo where does painting fits in within the flamenco puzzle? In a nutshell…Rehondo Jerez (http://rehondo.wordpress.com/proyectos/flamenco-2/), a new innovative flamenco group that opened the XVII Flamenco Festival de Jerez in 2013 at which they made their debut in a show entitled “Una Experiencia Plástica Del Flamenco” (Flamenco Plastic Experience). They created a synesthetic and synergistic experience based on plastic interpretation of flamenco on large formats. The definition of syn·es·the·sia is a condition in which one type of stimulation evokes the sensation of another, as when the hearing of a sound produces the visualization of a color (http://www.thefreedictionary.com/synesthetic). The work attempts to translate the flamenco aesthetic language, using paint to interpret flamenco guitar and lyrics into its spatiotemporal characteristics. The artist is inspired by the music and lyrics, producing paintings based on what he hears, and the singer and guitarist are influenced by the painting, which produces synesthetic and synergistic experience of the artists. And even if Jerez is not next on your travel list, you too can experience this artistic phenomenon of Rehondo Jerez as it happens by watching the videos at and . Rehondo Jerez perform beyond the frontera of Jerez…Museo del Baile Flamenco in Seville is one of the venues opening its doors to this unique group.\n\nFlamenco permeates the daily existence of many in Jerez, and is an afterhours pastime. I was fortunate to be invited to a flamenco juerga (party) in a private home where guitarists and singers have gathered to exchange ideas about flamenco, sing, play guitar and even do some improvisational bulerias de Jerez.\n\nFlamenco Festival de Jerez…an international affair…\n\nJerez, the birthplace of flamenco, is host to one of the most important and largest annual flamenco festivals ― Festival de Jerez (http://www.festivaldejerez.net/) ― which takes place from late-February to mid-March. In 2013, Jerez hosted the XVII (17th) edition of its popular Festival, once again opening its doors to international flamenco artists ― both local and from outside Jerez ― flamenco aficionados, and hundreds of students of flamenco dance from all over the globe. This annual pilgrimage of flamenco believers transforms Jerez into a multicultural mosaic, waiting with anticipation to take part in all that the Festival has to offer, from daily flamenco dance classes, taught by renowned flamenco artists and teachers, to nightly shows at the main venue, Teatro Villamarta, as well as other smaller venues such as Sala Compañia, Sala Paul, as well as various peñas flamencos ― La Buleria, Los Cernicalos, Peña El Perscaero, and tablaos such as the Bereber, the two weeks of the Festival is jam-packed with everything flamenco.\n\nFlamenco classes through the Festival: a 2-week intensive\n\nDuring the 2-week Festival, there is an array of dance and rhythm courses to choose from. Dance classes are offered in the morning, afternoon and evening, and are taught by renowned flamenco artists, both local and from other parts of Spain. The roster of teachers is a star-studded proposition with the names of international artists including Mercedes Ruiz, Olga Pericet, Angel Muñoz, Marco Flores, Eva Yerbabuena, Javier La Torre, Rafaela Carasco, Belen Maya, Antonio el Pipa, Angelita Gomez, and Chiqui de Jerez, just to name a few. And the selection of courses and styles of flamenco offered is just as tantalizing. What to choose? Will it be alegrias, siguiriyas, bulerias de Jerez, or solea with the bata de cola (a skirt with a long train) and the manton (shawl), tangos, tarantos, tientos… The most difficult part, it seems, is not learning, and remembering, the complicated choreography given by any of these teachers in just 7 days, but to decide what course or courses to take and with whom… it’s a head-spinning exercise…The task of choosing is daunting…For a student of flamenco, especially those who hail from countries where flamenco schools are either sparse or nonexistent, this luxury of choosing of who to study with is like being a kid in a candy store…It’s a 7-day intensive journey through a complicated choreography for every course…and the rewards are the satisfaction of having studied with the stars of flamenco dance, mastering their choreography, and of course, getting a Certificate of Completion (below)…\n\nAs if the selection of courses through the Festival were not mind-boggling enough, Jerez has many dance schools that operate outside the Festival. One such school is Centro de Baile Jerez (http://www.academiadebailejerez.com), where I had an opportunity to study Classical Spanish Dance (Clasico Español) with Victoria Ramos. In just seven days, I learned Victoria’s choreography with the castanets (castañuelas) to La Vida Breve by Manuel de Falla. In the City of Flamenco, Classical Spanish Dance classes are hard to find, and I was fortunate to have found Victoria and Centro de Baile Jerez.\n\nAnd for those flamencos who fancy cante, they can get private, semi-private or group lessons with Jerez native cantaoras, and fantastic performers in their own right… Some with whom I had an opportunity to study are Carmen Grilo and Eva Rubichi (pictured below, centre). I had a pleasure to study with both, learning to sing Alegrias de Cadiz and Bulerias de Jerez.\n\nFor a dancer, guitarist or singer, flamenco education transcend the walls of a dance or music studio…The Centro Andaluz de Flamenco (Andalucian Centre of Flamenco), situated on the Plaza de San Juan, in the heart of Santiago neighbourhood, provides and excellent opportunity for students of flamenco and flamenco enthusiasts to visit the museum, watch audiovisual presentations and peruse a large collection of flamenco archives in the library.\n\nEvery flamenco dancer needs a costume…\n\nJust like there is no shortage of flamenco schools in Jerez, there is no shortage of flamenco costume shops…from large stores to small, personalized shops, everyone can find a costume at any price range.\n\nFor those looking for a personalized, quick service with a big heart and creative, original designs, Jerez native’s Milagros Barroso’s Milagros Barroso Flamenco Shop is the place to be (https://www.facebook.com/MilagrosBarrosoFlamencoShop). A place where a sewing machine never sleeps, the shop is located in the heart of the Plazuela in the Barrrio de San Miguel, just a stone throw away from the Lola Flores statue…To Jerezanos and regular visitors to Jerez, Milagros Barroso Flamenco Shop needs no introduction. Servicing flamenco community in Jerez and beyond, the shop is a permanent fixture, and a flamenco costume gem of the Plazuela…In this quaint shop, one can find original creative designs of already-made skirts, dresses, blouses and other flamenco accessories. If after browsing rows upon rows of flamenco designs, one is still searching, a costume can be custom-made to a dancer’s specifications and tastes…from beginner to professional.\n\nA variety of flamenco costumes to choose from… A style and colour for every taste at the Milagros Barroso Flamenco Shop…\n\nCourtesy of Milagros Barroso Flamenco Shop (www.facebook.com/MilagrosBarrosoFlamencoShop)\n\nSome vendors, like flamenco dancers, make an annual pilgrimage to Jerez from other locales, and set up shops for the two weeks of the Festival. Among the first ones to do so, a trendsetting FlamencoDesign (www.flamencodesign.eu) from Seville, has been a regular pop-up shop during the Festival for the last 4 years. Rita, the owner of FlamencoDesign, a flamenco costume designer and a flamenco dancer, who also takes dance courses during the Festival, serves her clients by applying her knowledge of a woman’s body, of dancing, and of course, offers style advice. In addition to designing and sewing the costumes herself, Rita also researches and selects the textiles, which is a key point for creating skirts conducive to flamenco dancing. “I am in love with the textiles, and I never get tired of searching for new suppliers and fabrics from all over the word…” says Rita. “I am a dancer and a real lover of flamenco, so the designs and the main idea come from my dancing experiences”, says Rita, “I always do the first new cut, and try it on while dancing, so I can see both the advantages and disadvantages of the new cuts”. The first skirt with the new cut is always made by Rita herself, but as the demand increases, professional seamstresses are hired to sew additional skirts of the same design under Rita’s supervision. To maintain originality, Rita strives to have only 1─2 skirts of similar design. However, there are traditional cuts and colours that are made in multiples due to their popularity and demand. Her experience dancing in a bata de cola (a skirt with a long train), allows Rita to create designs that allow dancers to easily maneuver the skirt as they dance. Flamenco is not the only inspiration for Rita’s designs…Life’s changes also drive creativity and evolution of her designs.\n\nFlamencoDesign was started out of necessity as well as out of passion. After her move to Spain, and being unable to find good selection, quality or design of flamenco skirts, prompted Rita to start her business. Not an easy business to be in, as others may copy the designs, one always needs to stay two steps ahead of everyone, stay current and constantly evolve. But Rita welcomes the challenges that come with being a flamenco costume designer, “…I love to do it, I love the textiles, I love the nice dresses, and I mostly love to see the girls be happy in my skirts”. Rita makes the skirts and dresses for flamenco dancers of all levels and experience. Some of her high profile clients include Mercedes Ruiz and her cuadro flamenco, Pilar Ogalla and her dancers, and Alicia Marquez, but most of her buyers are flamenco dancers from all over the world. She gets to know her clients, many of whom have become her friends, and year after year return to her shop…and that’s the feeling she likes\n\nAs the excitement of the festival comes to an end, the performers take their final bow, and the curtain closes on the final show, the participants fondly recall the past two weeks of dance classes, endless flamenco shows, new acquaintances and new costumes…Until next year, Jerez…\n\nSources: 1.
