        "text": "Word to learn before you read on:\n\nPalos=styles of flamenco (palo really means stick or branch; in flamenco it is explained as the branches of a tree).\n\nWhen I found out how many styles of flamenco exist, I flipped back and wanted to instead just stick with the popular Macarena dance. Knowing that it was not necessary to learn them all it gave me a relief because flamenco started to look like a never ending experience, something that for an inpatient person like me it was daunting. This is one of the reasons why flamenco can teach anyone that anything is possible, to never give up, and that is a tool that helps anyone achieve their highest potential. For this reason of so many palos or styles, some people concentrate in mastering only one or maximum three or four.\n\nFlamenco includes dozens of different palos (styles of flamenco) each a unique combination of rhythm, harmony, pulse, and lyrics. These styles are known as Palo Secos, or dry styles, and they are the oldest forms of song known today.\n\nList of Palos:\n\nAlegrías: is the best-known form in a family of lively, vibrant songs known as Cantiñas. Cantiñas developed during the Peninsular War in the early 19th Century when Spanish partisans gathered on the Atlantic coast near Cádiz to launch the first attacks against Napoleon. The music of Cádiz blended with jotas from Aragón, and the Cantiñas and its variations were born: Cantiñas, Alegrías, Mirabrás, Caracoles and Romeras. The Alegrías has emerged as the most popular version of the song.\n\nBulerías: is one of flamenco’s most flexible forms: constantly changing, spontaneous, humorous, equally at home on a concert stage or at a private juerga. It’s the Rock’n Roll of flamenco – fast, rhythmic party music laced with social commentary that mocks the rich as it entertains them.\n\nCantes de Levante: Levante is a term used to refer to Spain’s Eastern coast. It takes its name from the wind that arrives in Spain from the direction of the Levante, the eastern coast of the Mediterranean. As part of Levante, we have Tarantas, Tarantos and Grana’inas Cartegeneras.\n\nTarantas, Tarantos: People from the eastern Andalucían province of Almería are traditionally known as Tarantos. Tarantas is a cante or solo guitar form performed libre or arrítmico – without any underlying compás. Tarantos is the dance form of Tarantas. The presence of the dancer introduces a steady 2/4 pulse into the music.\n\nGrana’inas Cartegeneras: Grana’inas, (the Andalucían pronunciation of “Granadinas”), is a Fandango cante similar to the Malagueña. Often performed as a guitar solo, Grana’inas isn’t known as a dance form. As the name indicates, the song is associated with Granada, and in particular with Frasquito Yerbabuena (1883-1944), an amateur singer from Granada. The Jerezano singer Don Antonio Chacón created a version of Grana’inas known as the Media Grana’in\n\nFandangos is a tree with roots that reach across Andalucía and branches that keep growing. The form emerged as a popular song and dance in the late 18th Century in the port city of Cádiz from songs and dances brought to Spain from the Americas. The Fandango of today is an aflamencada gathering of those disparate roots.\n\nFandangos de Málaga is the name given to a broad array of flamenco forms which, taken together, seem to have little in common. Part of the confusion stems from the fact that the term Fandangos is used across the Spanish-speaking world to refer to a wide range of songs, dances, and parties. It’s even a brand of mezcal. In its division, there are Fandangos de Huelva and Fandangos Naturales. All these forms are related to the Verdiales traditional folk song and dance from the mountains near Málaga. It also includes dance forms of Verdiales, Abandolaos, Jaberas Malagueñas and Rondeñas.\n\nFarruca is a dramatic, dance-centric form characterized by sombre virtuosity, aggressive footwork, and dramatic shifts in tempo. “Farruco/a” is a slang term used in Andalucía and Latin America to refer to someone from the Spanish provinces of Galicia or Asturias who is far from home. The flamenco form Farruca has little to do with the music of northern Spain, though some of the melodic themes associated with the farruca are reminiscent of tunes from Galicia.\n\nGuajiras is a prime example of a canción de ida y vuelta, (song of coming and going) flamenco music that has grown out of the travels of Spanish working people who went to the New World to work and returned to Spain, bringing traces of the culture of the New World home with them. Guajíras comes from the music of farmers, many of them with roots in Andalucía, who worked small farms in Eastern Cuba. These farmers were known as guajiros, and the songs they sang about the beauty of Eastern Cuba were known as Guajíras.\n\nRumba Flamenca may be the most widely known and least understood of the flamenco forms. Most of the world first heard Rumba Flamenca via the Gypsy Kings in songs like Bamboleo and Volare. In Spain, Rumba Flamenca has come in and out of style since Niña de los Peines first recorded a Rumba in 1918. Since then, artists such as El Chaqueta, Chano Lobato and Miguel Vargas Jiménez (Bambino) have become closely associated with the form.\n\nSiguiriyas derived from flamenco’s earliest root forms, the tonás, Siguiriyas is one of flamenco’s oldest and deepest forms. Its name is a corruption of the term seguidillas, a group of 18th Century songs and dances. Siguiriyas first emerged in the 18th Century in Cádiz, Sevilla and Jerez de la Frontera. Slow, majestic and tragic, Siguiriyas is the most jondo of cante jondo forms. Its lyrics focus on tragedy, inconsolable sorrow, and pain. (I found out recently, this is my teachers’ favorite palo she explains it is like the equivalent of deeper sadness, like cutting vains of flamenco, for its dark, and powerfully tragic lyrics. In this I see her sharing her soul in performance.)\n\nSolea por Bulerias: Soleá (Soleares) por Buleriás is, as its name suggests, a Soleares with the pace and drive of a Bulerías. Often considered a hybrid form, Soléa por bulerías (also called Soleares por bulerías) is more like a point on the continuum between Soleares and Bulerías. Determining just where that point is can be a source of contention among professionals and aficionados. There are resources that state quite definitely that it is a sped up soleares and others that make it clear that it’s a slowed down bulerías.\n\nSoleares is often referred to as the mother of all flamenco forms because so many other important forms are derived from it. It may be more accurate to think of soleares as the most flamenco of flamenco forms. All the elements of soleares, including its 12-count compás with an irregular beat structure, its Andalusian cadence, and its melodic and melismatic gestures are unique to flamenco.\n\nSevillanas: An essential part of any flamenco repertoire, Sevillanas is closely associated with Seville’s April Fair, Féria de Abríl en Sevilla. This light and lively song and social dance have roots that extend deeply into many parts of Spanish culture. The dance exudes romanticism and has a joyous, flirtatious air. Sevillanas first emerged as a distinct form in the late 18th Century as a variant of the Spanish song form seguidillas, appearing simultaneously with the Escuela Bolera, a formalized approach to studying and performing a variety of Spanish regional dances. By the 19th Century, Sevillanas were an important form in the Escuela Bolera.\n\nTangos Gitanos is one of a variety of musical styles found in the Spanish-speaking world called “tango.” Like the Tango Argentino its roots lie in the way African and Caribbean music blended with Spanish music in 18th and 19th century Latin America. Like its South American cousin, Tango Gitano consists of a simple, easily varied harmonic and melodic structure over a four-count rhythm. Unlike other four-count patterns, the first beat is weak while the other three beats are strong.\n\nTientos is a slow cante jondo music and dance in a four-count rhythm, was first developed by the singer Enrique el Mellizo (1848 -1906) as an expressive variation of the Tangos. Poet Federico García Lorca considered the Tientos to be almost liturgical in its solemnity. Traditional Tientos lyrics – letras – set a dark mood, and have to do with loss, unrequited love, imprisonment, longing for freedom and other serious messages. Dancers strive to capture this mood in their solos.\n\nMy favorite one is…\n\nMy friends we have seen the different palos or styles of flamenco. Deeper understanding of each takes time and discipline. Most flamenco dancers spend their lifetime learning just a few of them, and even some dancers prefer to stick to one or two forms. I have only learned some Alegrias, Bulerias and Tangos, and that was just scratching the surface, I really don’t know enough to consider myself a master of these palos. But one thing is sure, Bulerias is my favorite; it is spontaneous and dynamic, letting me utilize the element of surprise, something I love to do. Another thing it has is that the choreography can be used in parties and family gatherings.\n\nAre you curious to find out which is your favorite palo? If you are curious to find out, let me know in the comments below, and I can email you the nearest flamenco school in your area.\n\n*For anyone interested in learning more about these palos or styles, check out this link below from Studio Flamenco.
