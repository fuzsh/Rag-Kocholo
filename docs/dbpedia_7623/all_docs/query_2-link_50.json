        "text": "SCENE REPORT From Cantes to Breakbeats: A Guide to Flamenco Electronica in Spain By Maeve de Bordóns Álvarez · May 21, 2024\n\nAt its core, flamenco explores what it is to be human by confronting death, love, pain, joy, and heartbreak. It is a music of resistance that has crossed borders and spanned centuries. The cante jondo, one of the more recognizable types of flamenco, translates to “deep song” in Andalusian Spanish, and focuses on dramatic and tragic melodic expression. Flamenco is characterized by a fusion of a variety of elements: the cantes (vocal songs), the palmas (flamenco hand clapping), the compás (beat), the palos (styles), along with guitar and dance. Lyrics in cantes are often borrowed from poets and other lyricists; reusing and adopting pre-existing material is key to the way flamenco is made, reflecting the importance of storytelling and community, intertwining art and life.\n\nAccording to many historians, flamenco made its first appearance in the 18th century. But its roots go back much further. Its primary link is to the Roma people of Andalusia, Spain, who migrated from Northern India between the 9th and 14th centuries. Because of the diverse cultural history of Andalusia, flamenco music bears identifiable North African and Middle Eastern influences, from the instruments and the melodies to the connection with dance and community. Iconic figures like Paco de Lucía, Carmen Linares, Estrella Morente, Camarón de La Isla and countless others brought flamenco from Andalusia to the worldwide stage in the mid-to-late 20th century, and its legacy carries on to the present day.\n\nIn fact, over the last several years, flamenco has experienced a resurgence, intermingling with the current popular styles. It’s not the first time this has happened: 20 years ago, the music also experienced a revival. “Flamenco and traditional popular music and breakbeats were all being consumed [equally] by young people at the time,” recalls Seville DJ and producer DALILA. “Currently, we aren’t just seeing a revival of this ‘90s and ’00s scene—it also coincides with a time of local vindication, a celebration of the autochthonous, making inevitable the convergence of these two genres.”\n\nWhile flamenco purists have critiqued modern approaches to the genre, the very nature of flamenco has always been groundbreaking, with artists incorporating new stories, perspectives and instruments to their practice. Just like in electronic music, flamenco has evolved as new technology and ways of making music have become increasingly accessible for producers.\n\nDALILA points out that the most popular palos in flamenco have the same tempo as a breakbeat due to their rhythmic structures, a match made in heaven that other musicians have been playing around with for years. The following list features just a handful of the many great artists and labels championing and embracing the traditional sounds of flamenco, reclaiming and reworking it to first various electronic genres like breakbeats, jungle, techno, ambient and more.\n\nAndreh y Manuela\n\nLa Verdá en la Tierra\n\nHailing from Seville, Spain, Andrea Satalusía & Manuel Chaparro make music that draws from flamenco, spoken word, dreamy electronica, and rhythms from the Middle East and beyond. The idea for La Verdá en La Tierra came to be during the pandemic, while both were at home reading books and exploring Andalusian poetry. “This album is global,” says Satalusía. “It doesn’t just incorporate local folklore, but integrates sounds from all over the world, be it religious, pagan, or sacred.” While it was Hafsa Al-Rakuniyya, a 12th century Andalusian female medieval poet, who most specifically inspired the album, it also incorporates stories from other Andalusian poets like Al-Mutamid, Ben Saha, or Itimad Rumaikiya. Although these poets lived in different centuries, they were all persecuted for their words, resulting in either exile or crucifixion. Andreh y Manuela incorporates sounds and stories from all over the world that go beyond the original verses.\n\nTu Puerta (Paca y Manuela)\n\n“Digital Diogenes (Marronero Edit)”\n\nFounded by Guacha Sabelo from Uruguay and Dj Hidrataccioni from Mexico, RAWA is a Seville-based label and party that showcases music from Latin American and Andalusian producers and DJs. This flamenco breakbeat track by Digital Diogenes, who is signed to Seville label Industrias94 and is a great proponent of electronic music and culture in Seville, comes from the label’s first compilation, and samples the iconic 1970s song “Tu Puerta” by musical duo Paca y Manuela from Jérez, Spain. “The defense of ‘musical purity’ is something that happens in all musical genres, but there will always be artists that push the limits, transforming it into something new,” say RAWA, answering as a collective. “We think that this is precisely the environment in which RAWA unfolds that encourages fusion and experimenting with new sounds.”\n\nRia Ekin\n\n“Una Vez soñé”\n\nRia Ekin’s journey as a producer and DJ has been one of constant evolution. This track, taken from the Nuevas Bulerías EP, samples Fondo Flamenco´s song “Mi Estrella Blanca,” and in its rhythms recalls the Chicago footwork of people like DJ Rashad. It’s no surprise; the track was released on Iberian Juke, a label that was founded by powerhouse duo BSN Posse in 2015 and is dedicated to promoting footwork and juke with a Spanish touch.\n\nBSN posse\n\n“Un Camino Mu Largo”\n\nBSN posse is the brainchild of producers Broken Lip and Stay Puft, and was born in 2011 in Málaga, Spain. Their music spans breakbeats, jungle, future garage, and dubstep. “Un Camino Mu Largo” (meaning a very long road), is a perfect example of the way they skillfully blend genres, incorporating elements of footwork with nostalgic flamenco vocals.\n\nFLAMANTE\n\nTheory of the Flamenco\n\nFLAMANTE is Derek Van Den Bulcke, an experimental producer from Granada, Spain. Described by Bulcke as “a project of investigation and audiovisual production,” FLAMANTE integrates flamenco, experimental music, dance, and contemporary art into his hyperactive songs. 2023’s Theory of the Flamenco, its title inspired by Ben Frost’s Theory of the Machine, serves as an exercise in experimentation with cantes libres (free songs), selecting palos that use vocals without a fixed rhythmic structure, and adding in noise, bleep, ambient and acid techno sounds.\n\nDALILA feat. TontimerWeber\n\n“Cieguita”\n\nDALILA hails from the town of Pilas, Spain, and has gained attention due to her knack for blending traditional sounds with faster rave cuts. “Cieguita” is dreamily nostalgic, with polyrhythmic breaks and wistful vocals. Dalila explains that she was experiencing a moment of doubt about using her vocals while creating the track. Álvaro aka TontimerWeber, who produced the track, encouraged her, and the result is a beautiful collaboration. Dalila then decided to release an EP with four remixes of the track on the label Noise Pollution, enlisting four of her friends—Broken Lip, Robzzz, Ria Ekin and GAZZI—to re-envision it.\n\nEl Nitro, Natural Language, Chico Blanco\n\n“Canelita (Mi Canastera)” Mareo Edit\n\nMAREO are a netlabel and party from Granada, run by Chico Blanco and 8kitoo who have been making waves in the Spanish rave scene by focusing on acid house, hard groove, Miami bass, and more—a marked break with the more monotonous mainstream techno scene found at other parties. This track is a re-edit of Canelita’s “Mi Canastera” by producers El Nitro, Natural Language, and Chico Blanco, who bring breakbeats to an iconic flamenco song. MAREO are one of the party collectives helping to shift the spotlight to the south of Spain, recently hosting a Boiler Room takeover in their hometown.\n\nCalifato ¾\n\nPuerta de La Cânne\n\nTo talk about blending flamenco with electronic music is to talk about Califato ¾ . Their compositions incorporate elements of the Andalusian musical tradition with modern genres such as rock, electronica, and punk. (The group describes their musical style as “futuristic folklore.”) Their album Puerta de La cânne is a great entry point to their discography—a fusion of old and new, unequivocally present without losing sight of its roots.\n\nThe Gardener\n\nNube Negra\n\nThe Gardener—a solo project of Califato ¾’s Manuel Chaparro—is an effortless amalgamation of bass, cante jondo, breakbeats, and even baile funk, making this EP a blast from start to finish. A pioneer of Seville’s rave and club scene, Chaparro’s influence and musical innovation have paved the way for many other producers and artists in the scene.\n\nLos Lágrima\n\nMojaitas Vol I\n\nBased in Barcelona, Los Lágrima is the work of producers Digital Diógenes (Industrias94 and Breaking Bass) and Brandrum (Fuerça Elêttrónica Andaluça), who jump headfirst into each project. The duo met in Barcelona and realized they had a mutual affinity for sampling classic rumbas with jungle and breakbeats, all of which are seamlessly combined on Mojaitas Vol I.\n\nJavier Segura\n\n“Malagueñas 2”\n\nRecently appearing on the compilation LA OLA INTERIOR Spanish Ambient & Acid Exoticism 1983-1990 from Swiss label Bongo Joe, “Malagueñas 2” by cult Canarian producer Javier Segura remains as relevant as it was when it first appeared 30 years ago. A malagueña is a type of flamenco song originating from Málaga, usually consisting of a single vocal and a string instrument. The Canary Islands have their own spin on this with the Malagueña Canaria, which is slightly sweeter and mellower. Javier Segura’s mesmerizing ambient take slows down the central elements of a malagueña and adds a mystic touch for a song that is timeless and hopeful."
