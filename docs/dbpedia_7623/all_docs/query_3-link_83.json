        "text": "ABOUT halfway through my first flamenco class, when the instructor, Jorge Navarro, said, ''Lift your arms like the world is on them,'' I figured I was home free. That's how I feel all the time, anyway. But by the end of the class, feet throbbing, I was ready to surrender and I am no stranger to dance. Growing up as an overprivileged suburban child, I had years of ballet, jazz, even modern dance classes. My summers were spent -- Heaven help me -- at a camp that taught Israeli folk dancing. But never had I encountered anything as complex as flamenco, which blatantly defies three of America's favorite words: Easy. Now. Young.\n\nWhich makes it even more surprising that the age-old Spanish dance of men in tight pants and women wielding castanets has captured the imagination of the Gap generation. They are packing places like Alegrias, Mr. Navarro's tapas bar at 46 Bedford Street; Xunta Tapas Bar, at 174 First Avenue, and N, at 33 Crosby Street, for weekly performances. Even Joe's Pub, the nightclub of the moment at the Public Theater, recently featured Noche Flamenco, a company whose performances proved so successful it is to return this summer.\n\nMenkes, the Spanish manufacturer of flamenco shoes and all manner of costume and accessory recently opened its first store in this country at 250 West 54th Street. Its manager, Maya de Silva, says business is booming with flamenco students, people in search of stylish scarves and earrings, and also drag queens, for whom Menkes custom-makes platform boots up to a foot and a half high.\n\nFlamenco classes, too, are proliferating: Steps, on Broadway at 74th Street, now offers two every Sunday, counting between 15 and 30 students a class; Carlota Santana, whose company, Flamenco Vivo Carlota Santana, recently sold out its weeklong run at the New Victory Theater, says attendance at her classes at Fazil Studios, Eighth Avenue and 46th Street, is up. Mr. Navarro teaches on Sundays at the Sandra Cameron Dance Center on Cooper Square and on Saturdays leads an advanced four-hour class at Music Theater Works, on Lafayette Street, that includes choreography. He says his students include increasing numbers of models and actors; the centered confidence and erect carriage that are essential to flamenco help them on runways and at auditions.\n\nMany of flamenco's new fans say the dance does not replace their exercise regimens, but complements them. They consider flamenco a form of self-expression and emotional release -- the physical equivalent of poetry for people who speak better with their bodies. What's surprising is just how popular it is becoming despite its antithesis to the easy/ now/young American mindset. Mr. Navarro thinks the attention is due partly to Joaquin Cortes, who packs venues like Radio City Music Hall with his fusion flamenco, which adds jazz and modern dance. But the truth is that flamenco means hard/later/ old. To learn the steps and arms, and for a woman, the skirt, hands, and hips, all of which do different things at the same time, takes years. And technique is only half of it. Some people think women can't effectively dance flamenco until they have reached middle age; only then have they suffered enough pain.\n\nMs. de Silva of Menkes notes: ''Part of its appeal is that as an art form it's very forgiving. You don't have to be 18 and a slender stick of a girl to do it. You go to Spain and see an old fat lady who becomes a goddess when she dances. There is no age or weight limit. It is an art form that speaks to the emotions.''\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
