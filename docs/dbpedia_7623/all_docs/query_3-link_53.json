        "text": "If you are ready for an unforgettable experience, come to Madrid and feel the passion of Flamenco at the legendary Torres Bermejas.\n\nThis Flamenco venue is an excellent choice for those who approach to flamenco for the first time, as it covers different styles: “martinete”, “siguiriya”, “solea”, “tientos”, “zambra”, etc. (Flamenco spans over fifty different styles). This enormous diversity of styles is explained by its ancestral origins. Flamenco is a musical style that fuses Gypsy, Arab, Jewish and Christian influences since centuries. Fortunately for all music lovers, the city of Madrid has kept alive this fascinating tradition despite the passage of time.\n\nClick this link to find the best flamenco shows in Madrd: prices, schedules, useful tips, and mucho more\n\nOpened in 1960, Flamenco Show Torres Bermejas has become one of the icons of Flamenco in Madrid. We are not exaggerating a bit. Some of the best flamenco artists of the twentieth century have performed on this stage. Without a doubt, it is a place with a very special atmosphere.\n\nThe Flamenco show at Torres Bermejas stays true to its roots and includes a varied cast of 20 artists. All of them chosen after a rigorous selection process that guarantees the quality of the shows.\n\nSpecial mention should be made of the fascinating decoration which evokes the magnificent palaces of Muslim Spain: poly-lobed arches, painted wood, arabesque lamps, etc.\n\nFinally, the location of Torres Bermejas, among Gran Vía Street and Callao Square, is one of its assets. This area is considered the heart of Madrid, full of restaurants, theatres, shops, cinemas, cafes, etc. Even the great Ernest Hemingway, who lived during the Spanish Civil War, said that this part of Madrid reminded him of the 5th Avenue in New York."
