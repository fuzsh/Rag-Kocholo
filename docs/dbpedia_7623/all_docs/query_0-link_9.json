        "text": "The second thing we learn in flamenco is about the cante. Cante is one of the three main components of flamenco, along with toque (playing the guitar) and baile (dance). Because the dancer is front and center in a flamenco performance, foreigners often assume the dance is the most important aspect of the art form – but in fact, it is the cante which is the heart and soul of the genre.\n\nCante – Singing, also used to describe the different styles of flamenco when used in context such as: cante chico, cante grande or jondo, and cante intermedio.\n\nOur teacher is not going to teach us how to sing, although she teaches us how to maintain ourselves in the compas, which is very important for everyone in flamenco. Therefore, it is important as a dancer to know the different styles of cante in order to accommodate for the choreography of the dance, know which steps are appropriate, and what kind of rhythm or compas will be needed.\n\n“There are moments when my teacher will start to sing a little bit of a song to bring us into focus on what is coming next, or she might be sounding the different compasses we are working on.”\n\nStyles of cante\n\nCante chico – One of the three main stylistic families of flamenco, Cante chico has a lighter and more upbeat mood. Themes are often of love and happiness. Forms include bulerías, alegrías, and flamenco tangos.\n\nCantes libres – A free form of flamenco music in which melody plays an important part, while rhythm and metre seemingly do not apply. In many cases these songs grew out of more traditional, rhythmic flamenco music, evolving into pure melodies.\n\nCante grande/Cante jondo – One of the three main stylistic families of flamenco, Cante grande or cante jondo is darker in mood, with themes such as loss, anguish, despair, and death. Forms include soleá, martinete, tonas, seguiriya, and carceleras.\n\nCante intermedio –One of the three main stylistic families of flamenco, Cante intermedio is a looser family of styles, which encompásses all of the forms which do not fall under cante chico or cante grande.\n\n*A Cantaor or Cantaora is a singer (male / female).\n\nCamaron de la Isla singing a Buleria song\n\n*Buleria –originated in Jerez, Spain from the flamenco styles alegrías and soleares. This is the fastest and perhaps most difficult style of flamenco, including lively guitar playing and dancing with plenty of improvisation. The upbeat tempo of Buleria has proven to be quite popular and the style is performed in many flamenco shows, often to close out the performance."
