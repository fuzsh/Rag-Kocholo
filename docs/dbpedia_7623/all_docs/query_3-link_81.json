It comes with 2 sets of 3 pre tuned strings. I think if you are a beginner looking for a solid cajon sound, this is perfect for you.\n\nNow letâ€™s see this $1200 cajon which is the Meinl Artisan Martinete line.\n\nWhat is gonna give the price difference first is the construction of this cajon. The body is made of a solid wood tulip poplar wood and the front plate or tapa of Brazilian Iron wood. It comes with 2 sets of 10 ajustable strings. Its absolutely great all the construction of this cajon and how it feels good to play it.\n\nSo, now that you know little bit more about these 2 cajons Iâ€™m gonna play some grooves in both cajons for you to tell me what do you think â€“ Watch the video below\n\nSo, let me know which cajon do you prefer, which one sounds better to you. And if the more expensive is worth $1000 more the price of the cheap one.\n\nLeave all your thoughts in the comments below>\n\nIf you want to purchase one of these cajons here are the links:\n\nMeinl Artisan Tango Line â€“ Limba AETILLI â€“ https://geni.us/Modxo\n\nMeinl Artisan Martinete Line â€“ https://geni.us/lWsK"
