        "text": "Flamenco music styles are called palos in Spanish. There are over 50 different palos flamenco, although some of them are rarely performed. A palo can be defined as musical form of flamenco. Flamenco songs are classified into palos based on several musical and non-musical criteria such as its basic rhythmic pattern, mode, chord progression, form of the stanza, or geographic origin. The rhythmic patterns of the palos are also often called compás. A compás (the Spanish normal word for either time signature or bar) is characterized by a recurring pattern of beats and accents.\n\nTo really understand the different palos, it is important to understand their musical and cultural context:\n\nSome of the forms are sung unaccompanied, while others usually have a guitar and sometimes other accompaniment. Some forms are danced while others traditionally are not. Amongst both the songs and the dances, some are traditionally the reserve of men and others of women, while still others could be performed by either sex. Many of these traditional distinctions are now breaking down; for example, the Farruca is traditionally a man’s dance, but is now commonly performed by women too. Many flamenco artists, including some considered to be amongst the greatest, have specialized in a single flamenco form.\n\nThe classification of flamenco palos is not entirely uncontentious, but a common traditional classification is into three groups. The deepest, most serious forms are known as cante jondo (or cante grande), while relatively light, frivolous forms are called cante chico. Other non-musical considerations often factor into this classification, such as whether the origin of the palo is considered to be gypsy or not. Forms which do not fit into either category but lie somewhere between them are classified as cante intermedio. However, there is no general agreement on how to classify each palo. Whereas there is general agreement that the soleá, seguiriya and the tonás must be considered cante jondo, there is wide controversy on where to place cantes like the fandango, malagueña, or tientos. Many flamenco fans tend to disregard this classification as highly subjective, or else they considered that, whatever makes a song cante grande is not the song itself but the depth of the interpreter.\n\nThe classification below reflects another traditional classification of cantes more based on rhythmic pattern, but also taking the origin into account.\n\nToná Palos (usually known as Cantes a palo seco)\n\nDebla\n\nMartinetes\n\nCarceleras\n\nSaetas\n\nTonás\n\nTrilla\n\nPalos based on the Soleá rhythm\n\nAlboreá\n\nBulerías – Bulerias (and Jaleos from extremadura, a variety of Bulerías)\n\nThe Cantiñas group, including:\n\nAlegrías\n\nCaracoles\n\nMirabrás\n\nRomeras\n\nPeteneras\n\nRomances\n\nThe related palos Caña and Polo.\n\nSoleá – Soleares and Bulerías por Soleá.\n\nPalos derived from Fandango\n\nFandangos de Huelva\n\nFandangos orientales (from Eastern Andalusia and Murcia)\n\nFandangos abandolaos, including:\n\nVerdiales\n\nRondeñas\n\nJabera\n\nFandangos libres (free of rhythmic pattern):\n\nGranaínas\n\nMedia Granaína\n\nMalagueñas\n\nCantes de las minas (songs originated in mining areas): Minera, Tarantos, Tarantas, Cartageneras, Murciana, Levantica, Cantes de madrugá\n\nFandangos personales (personal creations)\n\nSeguiriya Palos\n\nCabales\n\nLivianas\n\nSiguiriyas – (also seguiriyas)\n\nSerrana\n\nPalos with a Tango rhythm\n\nFarruca\n\nGarrotín\n\nMarianas\n\nTarantos (when played for dance).\n\nTientos\n\nTanguillos\n\nTango\n\nPalos de “Ida y vuelta”\n\nOther palos with a tango rhythm are often considered as “Ida y vuelta”, that is, originated in Spanish America.\n\nColombianas\n\nGuajiras\n\nMilonga\n\nRumba\n\nVidalitas"
