        "text": "Flamenco Dance Classes\n\nIn private Flamenco dance classes, progress up to 4 times faster than in group classes!\n\nMore information or any questions → CONTACT US !\n\nWhat is Flamenco?\n\nFlamenco is an art that comes in two variations: music and dance.\n\nIn music, the cante and the guitar play a fundamental role. Cante” means “singing” in Andalusian Spanish. There are also other instruments (such as percussion) and backing instruments (such as “las palmas”, meaning clapping hands in the Spanish Flamenco vocabulary) that are usually present and play a very important role.\n\nThe dance is very expressive and every part of the body must move in a coordinated way. Whether it is the feet, legs, hips, arms, hands, shoulders or head, you have to think about everything in order to bring out the style of Flamenco dance.\n\nTo learn to dance Flamenco, for an occasion or in artistic events, two ingredients are necessary: soul and technique.\n\nIt is not an easy goal when you realize that Flamenco is very rich and can sometimes be complex. But this is why DanceAllStyles offers you its -> Flamenco Dance Private Lessons (at home or in a dancehall) Learn with ease and progress quickly thanks to the teaching methods of our specialized, qualified and experienced teachers.\n\nYou can count more than 50 Flamenco “Palos”. The “Palo” is defined in Spanish as each of the traditional varieties of Flamenco singing. Each “stick” (which allows each music to stand out) has its own rhythm and harmony. Depending on the style of music and the execution of the movements, a different dance is performed.\n\nTo make it simple, we could group the rhythms of Flamenco into two groups of “Flamenco styles”:\n\n“Jondo” Flamenco (= deep):\n\nFlamenco Jondo, translated from Spanish as Deep Flamenco, is a serious style that expresses deep and often tragic feelings. Subjects such as love, disappointment or grief are addressed here, and it is danced with a very deep and intimate expression. Whether in the movements or in the facial expressions. This is why it is the most difficult to understand for those who are not initiated to flamenco, and it is most often represented in expert circles, in theater or concert halls.\n\nThe examples of Flamenco “Jondo” are recognized by the style of singing and rhythm: Farruca, Martinete, Minera, Petenera, Soleá and Tiento.\n\nThe Festero Flamenco (= festive) :\n\nThe Festero Flamenco is a happier art, which invokes the festive aspect. As its name suggests, it is first performed at parties and celebrations in Andalusia.\n\nThe subjects are cheerful, whether they are about love or feelings, or whether they evoke places, parties or flamenco scenes. This style of dance, the Festero Flamenco can even be fun at times.\n\nExamples of Festero Flamenco are : Sevillanas, Rumba, Tanguillos, Bulerias and Alegrías.\n\nOther kinds of Flamenco dance:\n\nOf course, there are many sub divisions and interpretations that are difficult to categorize.\n\nIn any case, what is common to all flamenco is that it is living ! And to express this feeling, flamenco uses very strong movements that generally leave no one cold. So you can love or hate flamenco… But it is always a pleasure to discover it!\n\nCourse and prices of the Flamenco dance private lessons :\n\nWe offer packages of classes that have been thought out with all the teachers to allow you a better follow-up and an efficient progression.\n\nPackage 1 person : 7h30 to 337,50$\n\nThat is 45$ per hour.
