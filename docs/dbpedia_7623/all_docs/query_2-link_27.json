        "text": "A\n\nA palo seco\n\nIt is a style of singing accompanied only by percussion (generally in the form of clapping).\n\nAire\n\nThe atmosphere of a flamenco performance.\n\nAlboreá\n\nIt is a flamenco style normally sung at gypsy weddings, with the rhythm and guitar playing similar to soleá.\n\nAlegría\n\nIt originated in Cádiz and has a rhythm similar to that of the soleares. It is a fast style of flamenco with a lively rhythm for dancing and energetic guitar playing. In keeping with its name, this flamenco style has a cheerful expression. However, when traditional forms are followed, the joy dance arrangement can be the most rigid, with various sections structured in different ways. Without dance, joy is a freer form.\n\nB\n\nBailaora / Bailaor\n\nWoman or man who dance flamenco.\n\nBraceo\n\nThe movements of the dancer's arm.\n\nBulería\n\nThis flamenco form originated in Jerez in the styles of alegría and soleá. It is the fastest-paced flamenco style and probably the most difficult. It is accompanied by guitar and improvised dance. The fast pace of the bulería has proven to be very popular and is performed in many flamenco shows. It is usually the dance with which all flamenco revelry is finished off.\n\nC\n\nCafés cantantes\n\nThey are the original forms of the flamenco tablao and were popular entertainment venues where live flamenco shows were offered. These premises had their greatest boom at the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century. In the mid-20th century, singing cafes experienced a brief resurgence.\n\nCajón\n\nThis percussion instrument traces its origins to Peru in the 19th century, but it did not enter the flamenco music scene until the early 1980s. Many remember it thanks to guitarist Paco de Lucía, who introduced the cajon in one of his songs, together with percussionist Rubén Dantas. The cajon is played with the performer sitting on top of it, hitting the front of the box with their hands and thus keeping the rhythm of the performance.\n\nCantaora / Cantaor\n\nthe flamenco singer.\n\nCante\n\nthere are different styles of cante (flamenco styles) that you can check out below, including: cante chico, cante grande or jondo, and cante intermedia.\n\nCante chico\n\nIt is one of the three main stylistic families of flamenco with a lighter and more optimistic feeling. The themes are often of love and happiness. Its forms include bulerías, alegrías and flamenco tango.\n\nCante grande / Cante jondo\n\nBeing one of the three main stylistic families of flamenco, cante grande or cante jondo is darker in its sentiment, with themes such as loss, anguish, despair and death. Forms include soleá, martinete, tonás, seguiriya, and jailera.\n\nCante intermedio\n\nBeing one of the three main stylistic families of flamenco, cante intermedia is one of the most flexible styles and encompasses all the forms that do not fall into cante chico or cante grande.\n\nCantes libres\n\nA free form of flamenco music in which melody plays an important role, while rhythm and meter do not seem to apply. Most of these songs emerged from traditional and rhythmic flamenco music, evolving into pure melodies.\n\nCantiñas\n\nThis style of flamenco comes mainly from the province of Cádiz, while some of its forms also originated in Seville. With a fast rhythm similar to the soleá, this way of singing became popular with the rise of the singing cafes at the end of the 19th century until the beginning of the 20th century. Those singing cafés were the origins of the modern flamenco tablao.\n\nCarcelera\n\nForm of flamenco singing that originated in the prisons of Andalusia, where inmates used to sing about topics relevant to prison life.\n\nCartageneras\n\nThey have their origins in the fandango. The style developed from the typical songs of the miners around Cartagena, province of Murcia, where the fandango was already popular.\n\nCastañetas / castañuelas\n\nPercussion instrument made up of two concave pieces of wood, placed in one hand. Used in traditional Spanish dance, the instrument is also sometimes part of flamenco shows, although castanets should not be considered as belonging to flamenco.\n\nColombianas\n\nForm of flamenco singing that has its roots in Colombian popular music.\n\nCompás\n\nIt refers to the rhythmic pattern of a flamenco song. Compás, similar to percussion, is often produced by clapping, strumming, or the cajon.\n\nCopla\n\nIt can be used to describe the verse of a song; it is also a style of music in Andalusia, called copla andaluza, which is not related to flamenco.\n\nD\n\nDuende\n\nGuide or inner spirit that drives a flamenco artist. It is the spiritual connection between the artist and the song that, at its best, is conveyed to the audience.\n\nF\n\nFalseta\n\nThe melodic progression of the guitarist. (or, alternatively, following the advice of my native proofreader: Melodic phrase or flourish that is interspersed between the successions of chords intended to accompany the copla.)\n\nFandango\n\nThe origins of the fandango have long been the subject of controversy: different hypotheses place it in Andalusia, Aragon or the Canary Islands, while others include influences from the West Indies, Latin America and the Moorish peoples. The fandango is considered by many to be an old Spanish dance, very common in Andalusia, sung with guitar accompaniment. The typical ones are those from Huelva that sometimes end with verdiales, another flamenco song. The style is important in traditional Spanish and Portuguese dance and has been included in many classical compositions. Over the years, various sub-styles have developed. There are, for example, typical fandangos from Huelva and Malaga, the style of the latter known as verdiales. New versions have also emerged such as fandanguillos, a faster style of fandango.\n\nFarruca\n\nIt probably originated in Galicia, where it developed from the traditional Christmas songs known as carols. This style of flamenco also has influences from Celtic folk music, typical of the Galicia region, while others have pointed to connections with fado, a traditional form of Portuguese music and song. Other similarities include the zambra, which is typical in Granada. Both the farruca and the zambra share similar rhythms.\n\nG\n\nGolpe\n\nThis is what the flamenco guitarist uses to create percussion and rhythm is called in the flamenco context.\n\nGuajira\n\nIt is a version of flamenco with Cuban influence. The original guajira was brought back to Spain in the 16th century. This fast style of flamenco requires a seasoned guitarist.\n\nJ\n\nJondo\n\nDeep way of singing. The most genuine Andalusian cante, with deep feeling.\n\nM\n\nMalagueña\n\nThe malagueña style traces its origins to a local variant of the fandango in the province of Málaga. In the second half of the 19th century, these more traditional popular songs began to mix with flamenco, thus creating the style known as malagueña. Over time, additions such as short guitar solos and relaxation of the typical rhythmic pattern became an integral part of this style of flamenco.\n\nMartinete\n\nSong that belongs to the family of tonás or cantes a palo seco (it does not need guitar accompaniment). They are a cappella songs accompanied by simple percussion, often created by means of the hammer and anvil, which show the connection of this style with the gypsy roots of the working class. It is the melody that makes the martinetes different from other types of flamenco tonás. It comes from the cante of the forgers, boilermakers, etc., who accompany themselves with the hammer.\n\nMinera\n\nA type of Andalusian cante typical of the miners of the Levante area with a dragging and sad rhythm.\n\nN\n\nNuevo Flamenco\n\nIn the mid-1970s, new forms of flamenco began to emerge. It was first a natural and purer evolution under the influence of Paco de Lucía and Camarón de la Isla. While styles of foreign influences began to enter the music, during this time flamenco still kept its roots. Other innovations often came from blending modern music styles, creating flamenco fusion - a stronger mix of flamenco with jazz, Latin music, global music, and rock. Very talented international artists adopted parts of the flamenco styles, while others used their native musical heritage to create the new flamenco.\n\nO\n\nOlé\n\nWord of encouragement often shouted by the public and other artists. It is a common expression in the ruckus of a performance.\n\nP\n\nPalmas\n\nThe rhythm in flamenco music played with the hands.\n\nPalos\n\nThey describe the different types or styles of flamenco. These styles are known as flamenco styles. Each style has its differences, based on regional and cultural influences, time signature or rhythmic pattern, as well as sentiment. There are three basic palos: cante chico, which is lighter and more optimistic in its mood, cante grande or cante jondo, which is more melancholic, and cante intermedia, which basically contains all the other styles of flamenco that are not They fit into the first two categories.\n\nPaso\n\nThe individual movement of a dance. Together, the steps form the choreography of the dance.\n\nPeña\n\nAsociación Cultural Flamenca or the fan club where flamenco is often performed.\n\nPeteneras\n\nThe origin of the peteneras is controversial; Many place them in the province of Cádiz as a form that evolved from the traditional Spanish dance known as zarabanda. Others have noted similarities with the songs performed by the Sephardic Jews of Andalusia.\n\nPitos\n\nThe snap of the fingers.\n\nPolo\n\nIt is a flamenco style; there is only one known song that is classified as a pole. Similar to the rhythm of the soleá, it is often considered an evolution of the caña, a well-known form of flamenco.\n\nR\n\nRasgueo\n\nThe touch of the guitarist on the strings of the guitar, thus causing the vibration of two or more strings simultaneously with the fingers.\n\nRumba flamenca\n\nIt originated in Spain by incorporating some of the rhythmic styles of the Afro-Cuban rumba. The percussion in the flamenco rumba is generally created with more traditional Spanish methods such as castanets, clapping, and more recently, the cajon. The flamenco rumba has proven to be a popular export, enjoying success in other parts of the world such as Latin America, the United States, and France.\n\nS\n\nSacromonte\n\nA neighborhood in Granada that is also famous for its flamenco shows in the gypsy caves.\n\nSaetas\n\nTraditional Catholic songs in Spain that are the most sung during Holy Week a cappela or as a serenade to the image of the Virgin Mary or Jesus. The passionate singing perhaps includes influences from Arabic and Hebrew styles, showing marked similarities to the traditional call to prayer singing in the Muslim world. The saeta is a passionate display of religious devotion.\n\nSeguiriya\n\nIt is one of the most important styles of flamenco music. It is a deep and solemn song form that belongs to the cante jondo family. Along with the soleá, the siguiriyas are two of the most important forms of current flamenco. Many of the most traditional and popular flamenco songs come from these two families of styles.\n\nSevillanas\n\nThey derive from traditional Spanish folk song and dance and developed in southern Spain over the years. Music and dance are very popular in Seville during the April Fair, as well as enjoyed throughout much of Andalusia during the different annual fairs. It is a more festive, optimistic and positive style that is very popular in regional fairs with a festive atmosphere.\n\nSoleá\n\nIt originated in southern Andalusia and is a popular style of flamenco, calling for a talented singer accompanied by a guitarist. The lyrics contain the personal anguish and passion that the singer transmits through the melody and the exchange of strong and rhythmic voices, accompanied by a solemn face. The soleá has various sub-styles linked to various towns and cities, which are classified as \"soleares de...\" Triana (Seville), Cádiz, Jerez as well as Utrera, Alcalá and Lebrija. All of these substyles have different regional variants.\n\nT\n\nTablao\n\nModern version of the singing cafes; a place dedicated to celebrating a flamenco show.\n\nTaconeo\n\nThe fast and rhythmic footwork of the dancer that can reach amazing speeds and, when done well, is the mark of an excellent dancer.\n\nTocaora / Tocaor\n\nthe flamenco guitarist / the flamenco guitarist.\n\nTonás\n\nIt is one of the oldest forms of flamenco singing.
