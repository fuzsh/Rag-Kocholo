Song (cante), dance (baile), guitar (guitarra) and percussion (percusión) come together on stage in a most natural fashion, while they convey a genuine love for this art form and take the audience on a simple and unswerving journey of feelings, sensations and emotions.\n\nAbout the Artists:\n\nRafael Peral (Dancer and Choreographer). He received his degree in Spanish Dance from the Conservatorio Profesional de Danza Instituto del Teatro de Barcelona. After graduating, he studied with many masters including, El Toleo, La Tani, La Chana, Manolo Marín, and Antonio Canales. He began his professional career with the eminent José de la Vega, and worked with him until 1996, when he joined the Company of Antonio Canales, where he interpreted the role of “toro” in the production of Torero. At the same time, he appeared in the productions Gitano and Bengues under the direction of Lluis Pascual, and later performed in the flamenco dance companies of María Pagés, in La Tirana, Guito and Manolete in Puro Jondo, Guito in Mis recuerdos de Madrid y Sevilla, Adrián Galia in Paso a paso, Eva La Yerbabuena in Eva y 5 mujeres, Sara Baras in Juana la Loca and Sueños, Juan Andrés Maya in La Pasión, and with El Flamenco Vive in 4 Estaciones.\n\nHe was the guest artist in the production of Serranito, directed by Víctor Monge, and also danced in a variety of tablaos (flamenco venues) including El Flamenco in Tokyo, and Casa Patas, Corral de la Pacheca, Café de Chinitas, Corral de la Morería, Las Tablas, Torres Bermejas, and Las Carboneras, in Madrid.
