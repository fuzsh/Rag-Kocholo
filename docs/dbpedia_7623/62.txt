If you are ready for an unforgettable experience, come to Madrid and feel the passion of Flamenco at the legendary Torres Bermejas.

This Flamenco venue is an excellent choice for those who approach to flamenco for the first time, as it covers different styles: “martinete”, “siguiriya”, “solea”, “tientos”, “zambra”, etc. (Flamenco spans over fifty different styles). This enormous diversity of styles is explained by its ancestral origins. Flamenco is a musical style that fuses Gypsy, Arab, Jewish and Christian influences since centuries.
