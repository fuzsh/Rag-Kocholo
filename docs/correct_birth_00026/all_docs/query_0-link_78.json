        "text": "Sitting atop the crest of a hill in historic downtown Staunton, Virginia is the birthplace of President Woodrow Wilson, now the Woodrow Wilson Presidential Library and Museum. The beautifully restored Greek Revival house is the perfect place to immerse yourself in a celebration of love and marriage. Create your family history here in the lush beauty of the historic boxwood gardens in presidential splendor. Pledge your love in a romantic ceremony on the museumâ€™s lovely brick Terrace. Guests can mix and mingle over cocktails while you pose for formal portraits along the grounds and inside the Museum. Reunite with guests in the Garden for an alfresco reception. In addition to a delicious meal and dancing under the open sky, you and your guests will take in stunning views of lilacs, hostas, perennials, and garden pathways. For a smaller, more intimate gathering, you may opt to hold your ceremony and reception in the Library and Don Wilson Hall. Whatever you decide, the Woodrow Wilson Presidential Library and Museum provides a magnificent backdrop that will highlight your special day in a setting that is both lovely and significant."
