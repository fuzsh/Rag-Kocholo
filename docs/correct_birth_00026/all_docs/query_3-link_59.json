        "text": "Making A Move\n\nAlthough Woodrow and Edith were both born in Virginia, they decided to make Washington, D.C., their permanent residence.\n\nThey chose the neighborhood of Kalorama, Greek for “beautiful view,” because this house, designed by architect Waddy Butler Wood, had a hand crank trunk lift. This was especially important because Wilson's stroke—which happened mid-way through his second term in 1919—had left him unable to climb stairs. Edith, who served as a steward of the president by pre-screening matters of state during his convalescence, had the trunk lift shaft converted to an Otis elevator. One hundred years later, the Otis elevator still works, accommodating guests and staff.\n\nRemarkably, we have photos of moving day, March 4, 1921. The Wilsons’ move from the White House was much like any moving day, with moving trucks and piles of his, hers, and theirs on the front stoop. This house on S Street was the first and only house the Wilsons lived in together, other than the White House.\n\nThe Wilsons bought the house with the $50,000 from his Nobel Peace Prize, along with generous donations from 10 friends, each of whom gave them $10,000 to purchase the house. In keeping with Scottish tradition, Wilson gave Edith the key and soil from the yard of the newly-purchased $150,000 Kalorama property.\n\nWhat’s important to know about the Wilson House today is that in spite of COVID-19 and 100 years of dynamic history—or perhaps because of it—it is thriving. It may be 100 years old, but this historic site is only getting better. Community involvement helps to ensure that our tours are engaging, our programs are exciting, and our exhibitions are inspired.\n\nOur mission of welcoming open discussions of our complex past and exploring the ideals that unite —and we’re looking forward to the next 100 years.\n\nElizabeth Karcher is the executive director of the President Woodrow Wilson House.
