        "text": "Woodrow Wilson Presidential Library and Museum in historic Staunton, Virginia offers a variety of experiences for visitors of all ages. Retrace the inspiring journey of our 28th president at The Woodrow Wilson Museum as you take a self-guided tour through seven galleries which explore Wilson's early years, his eventful presidency, suffrage, prohibition and World War I. The President's restored 1919 Pierce-Arrow limousine is a highlight of the museum. Immerse yourself in the new, state-of–the-art World War I trench exhibit complete with lights and sound to experience what life was like for soldiers as they engaged in battle. See authentic weapons and uniforms as you discover the unforgettable story of the doughboys. Children will especially enjoy the hands-on Kids’ Corner and scavenger hunts. The research library is open by appointment. Enjoy an engaging guided tour of President Wilson’s birthplace, a beautifully restored Greek Revival manse, and experience what life was like when he was born there in 1856. An authentic example of a Shenandoah Valley home during the pre-Civil War era, this National Historic Landmark is decorated with Wilson family treasures and period furnishings."
