        "text": "AAA Editor Notes\n\nWoodrow Wilson Presidential Library and Museum, 20 N. Coalter St. at jct. E. Frederick St., is dedicated to the life and legacy of the 28th president of the United States. Multiple galleries interpret Wilson’s other roles: scholar, university president and New Jersey governor. Exhibits include presidential campaign memorabilia, historical documents and Wilson's Pierce-Arrow limousine. A World War I trench experience with lights and sounds brings visitors to the battlefront.\n\nAlso offered are guided tours of his birthplace, the Presbyterian Manse, an elegant Greek Revival house adjacent to the museum. The home has been restored to depict the Wilsons’ family life in the Shenandoah Valley before the Civil War. A Victorian garden, one of 13 historic gardens in Virginia, is on the grounds.\n\nGuided tours are available. Time: Allow 1 hour minimum."
