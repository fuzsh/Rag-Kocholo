        "text": "Description\n\nDescription\n\nThis is a virtual tour of the house in Staunton where Woodrow Wilson, the twenty-eighth president of the United States, was born on December 28, 1856. Wilsons father, the Reverend Joseph Ruggles Wilson, was a Presbyterian minister, so the Greek Revival house is referred to as a manse, a Presbyterian term for a ministers residence. The house, now open to the public as a museum, is part of the Woodrow Wilson Presidential Library and Museum."
