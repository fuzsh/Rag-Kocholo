        "text": "Woodrow Wilson\n\nChildhood\n\nThomas Woodrow Wilson, known to much of the American public as simply Woodrow Wilson,\n\nwas born on December 28, 1856 in Staunton, Virginia. He was the third child born\n\nto Joseph Ruggles Wilson and Jessie Janet Woodrow. His mother was from Carlisle,\n\nCumberland, England, and his father’s side of the family came from Northern Ireland.\n\nDespite the fact that Wilson’s grandfather was against slavery, Wilson’s parents\n\nidentified with the confederacy and defended slavery. Wilson’s father was one of\n\nthe original members of the Southern Presbyterian Church in the United States, after\n\nit broke apart from the Northern Presbyterians in 1861. Wilson lived in Augusta,\n\nGeorgia, until age 14. When Reconstruction began, his family moved to Columbia,\n\nSouth Carolina, where his father taught at Columbia Theological Seminary.\n\nAcademic life\n\nWilson did not learn to read until after he was ten years old. His difficulties\n\ncan be attributed to dyslexia, though he taught himself many ways to compensate\n\nfor his deficiencies. He attended Davidson College in 1873, but was unable to continue\n\non for a second year, due to medical issues. When his father began teaching at Princeton\n\nUniversity, Wilson transferred there and graduated in 1879. He actively spoke out\n\nfor the Whig Party, and devised a Liberal Debating Society. Wilson then attended\n\nhis first year of law school at the University of Virginia. He had to withdraw from\n\nschool, due to his health, and then continued on with his studies from his home\n\nin Wilmington, North Carolina. In 1882, after he had studied on his own for several\n\nyears, Wilson opened a practice in Atlanta. He passed the Georgia bar; however,\n\nthere was an overwhelming amount of lawyers, so he rarely had a high enough caseload\n\nto keep him busy. In 1883, Wilson applied and was admitted to Johns Hopkins University\n\nto work towards his doctorate in history and political science. After graduating,\n\nhe taught for three years at Bryn Mawr College and two years at Wesleyan College.\n\nPersonal life\n\nWilson was afflicted with hypertension, and likely had his first stroke at age 39.\n\nHowever, he took after his seemingly hypochondriac mother, and oftentimes thought\n\nhe was more ill than he was. Despite health issues, Wilson married Ellen Louise\n\nAxson, and together they had three daughters: Margaret, Jessie, and Eleanor. When\n\nEllen died in 1914, Wilson dated a woman named Edith Galt, and the two were married\n\nthe following year. Edith was a descendant of the Native American woman Pocahontas.\n\nWilson’s interests included cars and baseball. He also regularly bicycled and played\n\ngolf.\n\nRelationship with Princeton University\n\nWilson became a faculty member of Princeton University in 1890. He taught classes\n\non jurisprudence and political economy. He later became the president of Princeton,\n\nafter having been promoted by trustees of the school, in 1902. Wilson devised many\n\nimprovements to the school, including hiring more faculty, expanding to include\n\na graduate school and a school for electrical engineering, as well as a museum of\n\nnatural history. He designed curriculum guidelines that signalled the progressive\n\nnature of these changes. He raised academic standards so that admission qualifications\n\nwere much higher than they had been previously. Eventually, several of Wilson’s\n\nplans were rejected by men who wanted to keep the college more like a club for the\n\nelite than a school where anyone can come to study. This rejection encouraged Wilson\n\nto pursue a life of politics.\n\nGovernorship\n\nIn 1910, after having left his position of president of Princeton University, Wilson\n\nran for the Governor of New Jersey. Wilson was successful, even though just two\n\nyears prior, Taft and the Republicans had a very strong support in New Jersey. Wilson’s\n\nsuccess was attributed to the growing support for progressive ideas endorsed by\n\nRoosevelt, amongst others.\n\nPresidency and World War I\n\nIn 1912, Wilson picked a running-mate, IN Governor Thomas R Marshall, and a campaign\n\nmanager, NY lawyer William Frank McCombs, and ran for the United States presidency.\n\nWilson appealed to much of the American public, especially the South, because he\n\nwas progressive and sober, but didn’t advocate for a dry America. He connected best\n\nwith younger intellectuals, lawyers, and the like. He spoke for “New Freedom,” which\n\nlimited the federal government’s power and was opposed to the controlling nature\n\nof monopolies. Wilson emerged victorious in the election, defeating both William\n\nHoward Taft and Theodore Roosevelt.\n\nWilson served his first term as president from 1913 – 1917. He appointed many fellow\n\ndemocrats to government positions. He held the first press conference, and started\n\nthe tradition of allowing reporters to ask questions. He gave the State of the Union\n\naddress live, which no president had done since Thomas Jefferson, as he had stopped\n\nthat practice in 1801. In 1913, Wilson got Congress to pass the Federal Reserve\n\nAct. This was a compromise between Republicans and Democrats; Democrats wanted to\n\nrid the US of private banks and Wall Street, and wanted the government to control\n\nthe central bank, so that it could print money as Congress needed it. The compromise\n\ndid the following: it allowed private banks to control the Federal Reserve Banks\n\n(there were 12), but it also placed controlled interest in the system through a\n\nboard appointed by the president with the Senate’s approval. This also supported\n\nthe idea of an “elastic” currency. He was not a “trustbuster” as Taft and Roosevelt\n\nwere before him. He encouraged economic competition through the Federal Trade Commision.\n\nWilson spent the majority of his first presidential term trying to keep World War\n\nI in Europe. Though he offered to mediate, neither the Allies nor the Central power\n\ntook him seriously enough. He did not focus his energy about building up the US\n\narmy, because he believed that would encourage the spread of the war. In 1916, Wilson\n\nhandily won the re-election to presidency, using the slogan “He kept us out of war.”\n\nHowever, in 1917, the decision to go to war was inevitable. US ships were threatened,\n\nand Wilson wanted the war in order to make the world a “safe” place for democracy.\n\nThe US proceeded as an associated power, not an alliance to any particular country.\n\nHe wanted the war to be “the war to end war,” and then devised the Fourteen Points, which\n\nincluded the proposal for a League of Nations. He gave this address on January 8,\n\n1918, and emphasized cooperation amongst nations. He attended the Peace Conference\n\nof 1919, which aimed to grant big and small nations the same political independence.\n\nWilson’s League of Nations idea made its way to the Treaty of Versailles, which\n\nwas one of the major peace treaties at the end of WWI and ended the war between\n\nGermany and the Allies.\n\nOther important features of Wilson’s time in office were passing the 19th amendment,\n\nwhich gave all women the right to vote, as well as supporting unions and developing\n\nthe Child Labor Reform Act.\n\nAfter the Presidency\n\nAfter serving his terms as President, Wilson and his wife, Edith, moved to a townhouse\n\nin Washington, D.C. On November 10, 1923, Wilson gave a short radio speech celebrating\n\nArmistice Day from his home. This was his last national address. He died several\n\nmonths later, on February 3, 1924, and was buried in the Washington National Cathedral.\n\nHere, we have two of Wilson’s most important addresses:"
