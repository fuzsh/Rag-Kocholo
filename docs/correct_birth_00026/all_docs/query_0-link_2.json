An authentic example of a Shenandoah Valley home during the pre-Civil War era, this National Historic Landmark is decorated with period furnishings, including treasures from the Wilson family. An experienced guide will lead your tour of the Manse.\n\nThe Woodrow Wilson Museum: Learn more about our 28th president as you take a self-guided tour through seven galleries that explore the life and times of Woodrow Wilson. Learn more about his presidency and its many issues, including women’s suffrage, domestic reform, segregation, and World War I. Be sure to visit the president's restored 1919 Pierce-Arrow limousine, which is one of several highlights of the museum. Another highlight is our state–of–the–art World War I trench exhibit, which allows you to experience what life was like for soldiers as they engaged in battle. See authentic weapons and uniforms, as you discover the unforgettable story of the Doughboys.\n\nBe sure to ask for a scavenger hunt for any younger guests."
