        "text": "Staunton, Va\n\nLocated at his birthplace, the Woodrow Wilson Presidential Library and Museum strives to fully communicate the life, works, and impact of Woodrow Wilson, the 28th President of the United States. To convey its designation as a Presidential Library and enhance the opening of its World War I Trench Exhibit, the Library turned to Frazier Associates to help tell the story of President Wilson using graphic design elements.\n\nThe bay window scrims in the museum building, designed by Frazier Associates, are based on a timeline of events that took place during the Wilson presidency. They capture interest, both on a pedestrian and vehicular level, particularly at night when they are lit from within the museum. The firm also assisted with redesign of the lobby and reception area of the museum, incorporating the rich color scheme and new logo.\n\nNew exterior signs, designed by Frazier Associates were also installed throughout the Museum grounds. The signs convey an updated image reflective of the designation as a Presidential Library and include lit monument signs located at key entrances as well as directional signs to guide visitors throughout the museum campus."
