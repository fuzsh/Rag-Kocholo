        "text": "Out of respect, I know we probably shouldn’t refer of our presidents as “cute,” but look at this crate filled with Woodrow Wilsons in the gift shop at the Wilson Birthplace and Presidential Museum in Staunton, Virginia. (Only $11.95!)\n\nThe gift shop is just down the block from the presidential museum, which I visited after first touring the birthplace of our 28th president (see previous post).\n\nAt the museum, a bust of President Wilson greets you on arrival (much more stately than the doll).\n\nThe museum features many pieces from Wilson’s presidency as well as his time in Princeton as a student, professor and later as university president. I liked seeing Wilson’s desk, book bag and student lamp. There are also lots of wonderful family photos.\n\nAnd look at this cool old phone from the White House. During my visit (March 2013), there was an exhibit about communication, including an interactive radio that broadcast your voice.\n\nI also enjoyed seeing documents and photos surrounding the establishment the Federal Reserve and reading about Wilson’s wives. His first wife Ellen died while he was in office, and he married his second wife Edith a year later in 1915. Some called Edith the “Secret President” because of her influence after President Wilson’s 1919 stroke.\n\nAs I wrote in the previous post, one of the stars of the Wilson museum is the president’s Pierce Arrow limousine.\n\nWhile I was taking a picture of the car, I met fellow history buffs Dan and Beth, who were headed to Jefferson’s Poplar Forest the next day (I was headed there a few days later). They also recommended Robert E. Lee’s burial site and Stonewall Jackson’s house in nearby Lexington as well as a trip to see where Jackson’s arm is buried near Fredericksburg, Virginia. I will need to add those to the Nerd Trips itinerary.\n\nFor your trip planning, the Wilson museum in Staunton has decent bathrooms (always an essential). There is no food at the museum itself, but the town of Staunton has lots cafes and restaurants, and you can also hit some of the typical chains if you’re getting back on the highway.\n\nAs always, I wish you loads of laughs and lots of learning on your own Nerd Trips!\n\n-Sharon"
