        "text": "As we leave these brisk months of fall behind and begin our gradual descent into winter, it’s time to focus less on the amazing things available to us outside and to focus instead on other attractions in the wonderful Shenandoah Valley! One of those attractions is the Woodrow Wilson Presidential Library, located in the nearby town of Staunton, VA.\n\nThe Woodrow Wilson Presidential Library is an unassuming piece of American history dedicated to the life and story of America’s 28th president. Though parts of Wilson’s legacy are controversial, his presidency had profound implications for American Society, as he worked to pass many social and economic reforms, including the Federal Reserve Act, the Child Labor Reform Act, and legislation that supported unions to ensure fair treatment of working Americans, before leading the country through World War I.\n\nThe town of Staunton itself is a wonderful place to explore this winter and home to much more than the Woodrow Wilson Presidential Library. It’s about 30 minutes from our Shenandoah Valley Bed and Breakfast. It is home to a vibrant arts and music scene, incredible local restaurants, and an exciting array of independent shops and galleries. Here, you’ll enjoy 50 tranquil acres of space, gorgeous guest rooms or intimate cabins, and exceptional hospitality.\n\nThis is a magnificent place to spend a few relaxing days this winter. Book your room at our Shenandoah Valley Bed and Breakfast today!\n\nWhat to See at the Woodrow Wilson Presidential Library\n\nThere are a variety of experiences available to visitors at the Woodrow Wilson Presidential Library & Museum. President Wilson’s birthplace, known as “The Manse,” offers an authentic glimpse into what life would have been like when he was born in 1856. The home itself is a pre-Civil War era Greek Revival style home. It’s decorated with period furnishings, including Woodrow Wilson family treasures. Entrance into the Manse is by guided tour only.\n\nAlso at the Woodrow Wilson Presidential Library is the museum dedicated to Wilson’s journey as the 28th American President. Here, you can take a self-guided tour through seven galleries that explore Wilson’s early years, his eventful presidency, including his stance on women’s suffrage, prohibition, and leadership through World War I.\n\nApart from learning more about Wilson’s presidency, a highlight of the Woodrow Wilson Presidential Library & Museum is the President’s restored 1919 Pierce-Arrow Limousine.\n\nAfter exploring the Woodrow Wilson Presidential Library & Museum, you can walk through the remainder of downtown Staunton. There, you’ll find an exciting range of shops and galleries to explore, along with delicious restaurants. Staunton’s top attractions include The American Shakespeare Center/Blackfriar’s Playhouse, antique stores including the Factory Antique Mall, and the Frontier Culture Museum. For even more great things to do in Staunton this winter, refer to a recent blog we wrote about it here.\n\nThe Best Lodging in the Shenandoah Valley\n\nWhile the Woodrow Wilson Presidential Library & Museum is an interesting place to visit, it’s certainly not the only thing worth doing in Staunton or the great Shenandoah Valley this winter. Our Shenandoah Valley Bed and Breakfast is situated between the exciting towns of Staunton and Lexington and within easy driving distance of Shenandoah National Park’s Skyline Drive and the Blue Ridge Parkway.\n\nWhether you want to get out for some cross country skiing, snowshoeing, or winter hiking in the area (weather dependent), or would rather spend your time visiting local breweries and relaxing at our Inn, you’ll find that the comfortable accommodations at our Shenandoah Valley Bed and Breakfast are second to none. Our manor is set on 50 acres of rolling verdant grounds, which leaves you feeling immersed in nature even after spending time in neighboring towns."
