        "text": "About This Exhibit\n\nFrom 1913-1921, Woodrow Wilson was the American President, meaning he was one of the most powerful men in the world during one of the most significant periods in history. The University of Nebraska–Lincoln Libraries Archives & Special Collections is home to a variety of materials related to President Wilson, his leadership during World War I, and his involvement at the Paris Peace Conference.\n\nThis exhibit includes documents, items, and images from a number of different collections at the University of Nebraska and includes cartoons, books, postcards, posters, and photographs, along with a few miscellaneous items, all representative of President Wilson. Some of the items date back to Wilson’s schooling at Princeton, while the majority relate to his presidency, and more specifically, his involvement in World War I and the following Peace Conference at Paris in 1919. Also included is a bibliography of materials related to Woodrow Wilson which are also available in the Archives & Special Collections.\n\nThrough the variety of materials presented here, this project will make available a number of items housed in the University of Nebraska–Lincoln Libraries Archives & Special Collections in order to provide better insight into the life and presidency of Woodrow Wilson, as well as some of the issues which were prevalent during this time.\n\nBiography\n\nThomas Woodrow Wilson was born in 1856 in Staunton, Virginia to a Presbyterian minister, Dr. Joseph Wilson, and Janet Woodrow and was the third of four children. His father served in the Civil War as a chaplain with the Confederate army, and during the war, his church was used as a military hospital.\n\nWilson began his post-secondary education at Davidson College in North Carolina but, after a year, transferred to Princeton where he graduated from in 1879. He attended law school at the University of Virginia for one year but did not graduate and, in 1882, joined a University of Virginia classmate in his newly begun law practice. The practice was unsuccessful, and led Wilson to turn away from a career in law. He returned to school at John Hopkins University and earned his PhD in history and political science in 1886. His doctoral thesis, Congressional Government: A Study in American Politics, was published in 1885 and challenges the separation of the legislative and executive powers in America by comparing it with parliamentary government. The same year he married Ellen Louise Axson.\n\nHe taught at Bryn Mawr College and Wesleyan University before joining, and eventually becoming president of, Princeton University in 1902 where he became known for his ideas on education reform. In 1911 Wilson entered the political sphere as the Governor of New Jersey, bringing him a great deal of political acclaim. He won the 1912 presidential election by a landslide with the Republican ticket split between William Howard Taft and Theodore Roosevelt. In 1914, his wife Ellen passed away, and Wilson was remarried to Edith Bolling Galt in December 1915. His second Presidential term was won by a much closer margin. He realized that the United States could no longer remain neutral in the war, and the nation officially entered World War I in April of 1917. It consumed his second term as President.\n\nOver the course of his presidency, Wilson passed many significant pieces of legislation, with some of the most notable being the Federal Trade Commission, the Clayton Antitrust Act, the Underwood Tariff, the Federal Farm Loan Act, and the Federal Reserve System.\n\nInaugural Address Crowd\n\nThe large crowd at President Wilson’s First Inaugural Address in 1912. The caption says, “The New President delivering his Inaugural Address from the steps of the Capitol after requesting that the cadets, who had been drawn up to keep the crowd back, should allow the people to approach close to the platform.” MS 50\n\nThe Big Four Peace Confrence\n\nImage taken from The Big Four and Others of the Peace Conference by Robert Lansing.

MS 50\n\nDonkey Cartoon\n\nPresident Wilson with the democratic donkey walking in circles around him. MS 50\n\nA Difficult Dance\n\nThis cartoon of President Wilson is indicative of the general feeling of Americans concerning the tariff. MS 50\n\nBoat of Prosperity\n\nThe cartoon in the middle of this page shows Wilson attempting to hold steady the boat of Prosperity while navigating through “radical” waters. MS 50\n\nA Game of Patience\n\nThis cartoon from the Chicago Tribune depicts President Wilson struggling with what to do in Mexico, while countries in Europe cry for help. MS 50\n\nHumanity First Cartoon\n\nThis cartoon from the Chicago Tribune reflects the positions of the different political parties going into their respective conventions before the 1912 presidential election. The Republican party had many supporters but was divided with the creation of Teddy Roosevelt’s Progressive party, ultimately leading to Wilson’s victory. MS 50\n\nThe Lusitania Crisis\n\nThis cartoon represents both struggle and patience over the decision of how to respond to “THE LUSITANIA CRISIS” in 1915. From “One Hundred Cartoons by Cesare”\n\nThe Filipino Waif Cartoon\n\nCartoon from the New York Tribune that reflects an opinion of President Wilson’s attitude towards American interests in the Philippines. MS 50\n\n3rd Term Cartoon\n\nCartoon from the June 21, 1918 issue of the New York Evening Post. Shows Indiana Democrats serving Wilson a third term as president while he continues to “sip” on his second. Theodore Roosevelt peers anxiously through the window behind him. MS 50\n\nGermany’s Reply Cartoon\n\nThis cartoon which originally appeared in a Zurich, Switzerland publication, Nebelspalter, depicts Germany as a whining child while President Wilson takes all of their weapons or “toys” away. MS 50\n\nWilson Before His Judge\n\nThis German cartoon called “Wilson Before His Judge” depicts a large, green, devilish judge reading a letter from President Wilson. Translation: Wilson says “I wanted to save the world.” The Judge responds, “But you have brought it about, allowing Germany to be nailed to a cross (can also be translated as ‘hit with clubs’).” The hook, dangling in front of Wilson with numbers 1-14 attached, symbolizes Wilson’s Fourteen Points. MS 50\n\nJack of Clubs Cartoon\n\nThis cartoon depicts both Woodrow Wilson and William Jennings Bryan on a jack of clubs playing card. MS 50\n\nPage 1\n\nTranslation America is with us And its President as a whole The heroical nation Of soldiers with muscles of steel. Of Wilson the great figure Appears, and his clear vision Imprint of a very pure kindness Hides an iron will Patient, of rapid decision In front of the accomplished crimes, By the effect of a perfidious Boche It is war for his country. O Wilson they name in the History Is “the Just” and it is well named Is there a better title of glory Than to defend a nation oppressed? From the north came Hope From the extreme south to Greenland The world has marched for France That a ruffian wanted to destroy.\n\nPage 2\n\nTranslation: To the Allies of my native Country Of whom each country is a friend That comes and brings us its life To each one I say “Grand Merci” But in the horizon at dawn The Americans disembarked For the Justice that they adore, Wilson gives them by the handful The vast flag full of starts Putting the hearts in anxiety Gives thrills to the marrow Like the sword of the law. Its great shade covers our land. And like by enchantress Under its large tutelar folds All is transformed wonderfully. Unheard and gigantic efforts Of good blood amongst the best, Against the vile soldiery Of all a nation of robbers And from the ground, appears small boroughs Factories, and Immense camps Telegraph, Bombs, and grenades And of big soldiers, good children\n\nPage 3\n\nTranslation: Its phalanx covers our roads The cannons, the railroads And the tanks, mobils, redoubts. Are brought to us by the sea. Its planes while climbing shakes And prance under their motors In the air the steel wires sing Living harps of the heights. Stars, living sparks While bringing dollars and engines You have pulled the wings Of the insolent eagle of the Prussians Americans nation of braves You have gathered the laurels While crushing the slave Boches At the side of our dear troopers When the apotheosis will come When we will cross the Rhine You will stoop under the weight of roses That are thrown to the winners at the end.\n\nBibliography\n\nBooks\n\nBaker, Ray S.
