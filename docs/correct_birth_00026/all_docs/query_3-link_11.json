        "text": "Visiting presidential birthplaces is a great way to learn about our American history. Recently we were on a road trip coming home from Philadelphia and saw a small brown sign telling us that we were close to Woodrow Wilson’s birthplace. We followed the signs and got a chance to learn a little about our 28th President in Staunton, Virginia. (We saw something else pretty cool in Staunton, Virginia – a giant flowerpot and watering can!)\n\nVisiting Woodrow Wilson’s Birthplace\n\nLearning about the Presidents of the United States is always more interesting when you are actually walking where they were born and lived. We found President Woodrow’s birthplace before most people in the community had even gotten their day started so we couldn’t go into the buildings.\n\nSitting atop the crest of a hill in downtown Staunton’s Gospel Hill historic district is the birthplace of President Woodrow Wilson. The house is often referred to as a manse which is the term the Presbyterian Church uses to identify the residence of their minister.\n\nBut we did get a chance to walk through the gardens and get our picture in front of the house where President Wilson was born.\n\nThe Bow Tie shaped gardens are a beautiful place for pictures as well as enjoying the history of the greenery.\n\nThe first gardens, designed in 1933 by Richmond landscape architect Charles F. Gillette was done as a project by The Garden Club of Virginia. The Victorian restoration, suitable to the 1846 construction date of the house, the gardens included two terraces, the lower one featuring boxwood-lined bowknot beds, the only bowknot garden that Gillette created.\n\nVisit the Museum and Birthplace\n\nSee more details on their Website, Facebook and Twitter.\n\nAddress: 20 N Coalter St, Staunton, VA 24401\n\nPhone:(540) 885-0897\n\nHours: Open · 9:00 am – 5:00 pm\n\nThere is an admission fee to tour the Presidential Library & Museum\n\nHave you visited any Presidential Birthplaces or historical sites? Do you think it’s important to take family road trips to places with historical significance?"
