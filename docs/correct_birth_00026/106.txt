The Manse: Birthplace of Woodrow Wilson

The birthplace of Woodrow Wilson, known as the Manse, is a significant part of the museum complex. The Manse, a term used to refer to a Presbyterian minister's home, was built in 1846 by the Staunton First Presbyterian Church. The house, which cost around $4,000 to build, features 12 rooms each with a fireplace. The Wilson family moved into the Manse in 1855 when Wilson's father was ordained as a Presbyterian pastor in Staunton.

The Museum at the Woodrow Wilson Presidential Library and Museum

The museum, which opened to the public in 1990, is located on North Coalter Street, just two doors down from the Manse and in front of the library. Spanning 8,000 square feet, the museum houses eight galleries that focus on the life and times of Woodrow Wilson. Notable exhibits include the president's 1919 Pierce-Arrow limousine and an interactive trench exhibit based on a World War I trench.
