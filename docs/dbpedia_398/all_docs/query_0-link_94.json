        "text": "MythBusters is ending its going-on-13 year run after next season. But the Discovery show will stick with us, because hosts Adam Savage and Jamie Hyneman (and sometimes their B-team) have inspired fans to question the veracity of every TV and movie special effect.\n\nYep, we will forever be annoying viewers, thanks to the show.\n\nBut before we watch the the final season of Mythbusters, let's take a look at 8 of the best entertainment myths that the show has confirmed or debunked:\n\nThat amazing bathtub scene in Breaking Bad couldn't have really happened\n\nRemember when hydrochloric acid dissolved a dead body AND the bathtub and the floor below it in the first episode of Breaking Bad? Yeah, well the MythBusters taught us that isn't actually plausible in their Breaking Bad special.\n\nIt is, in fact, plausible for Han Solo have used a Tauntaun carcass to keep Luke warm in The Empire Strikes Back\n\nIn one of the many Star Wars myths tackled on the show (Savage and Hyneman worked on the special effects in some of the prequel movies), the team proves that it is plausible to for Luke to have survived in the cold planet of Hoth. In the test, a dummy's temperature didn't hit hypothermic lows.\n\nIndiana Jones actually could have survived the opening scene of Raiders of the Lost Ark\n\nIn the movie, Indy runs past poison dart launchers to steal the golden idol. Savage replicated the run and came out unscathed.\n\nSorry Fast & Furious filmmakers: Drifting a car does NOT make turning a corner faster\n\nWhen tested by the guys and a professional driver, driving techniques other than drifting proved faster.\n\nThe final scene in Jaws is just not possible\n\nIn the movie, a tank in the shark's jaws explodes after it's shot. In real life, repeated shots failed to burst the tank.\n\nA bus could NOT do the jump in Speed\n\nBased on the team's tests, the vehicle could not have successful completed the jump over the 50-foot gap in the road.\n\nBond villain Jaws isn't quite THAT powerful\n\nWith metal teeth, he couldn't really bite through a cable car's cable like he does in Moonraker.\n\nRose really could have saved Jack in Titanic\n\nThe MythBusters proved what we all figured was the case: Rose and Jack could have BOTH survived. The trick? Rose could have plausibly have strapped her life jacket underneath the board to add to its buoyancy."
