        "text": "I used to enjoy playing this game a few years back, but then things started to go downhill. I had this game on a previous device, and it was pretty fun. A year passed, and I didnât play for a while. Recently, I started playing again, expecting the same experience, but itâs not the same. Temple run was fun before it was practically taken over by pop up ads. If you die, it asks you if you want to revive yourself by watching an ad. However, if you pick no, it still makes you watch an ad. Then, when you are in the menu, pop up ads keep coming. That is not my only complaint. My next complaint is that it tells you to watch an ad to earn coins. Whenever I click on that option, it says my internet connection doesnât work, but my internet is fine. My next complaint is that sometimes in the middle of a game, it kills me for no reason. I donât fall into the water or bump into a tree or anything. My last complaint is that the game is kind of laggy. But I know itâs not my internet. I hope you were able to bear through my long list of complaints but please fix these bugs! ð\n\nMy siblings and I really enjoy playing this game. We have competitions to see who can get the most coins or who can run the farthest. We sit and take turns as a family sometimes. I think it is a really good game. There are NO ads and you can play it without Wifi. It is really fun that you can basically customize the game. When you get coins you can go to upgrades and make the game even better. You can make it how you want and even get resurrection wings. My siblings also like how it has a funny little thing up at the top after you die about what happened. Like you were doing the hokey-poky or âYou forgot to duck!â There was only one problem I had with this game. I donât know if it was just my device because itâs kinda old or the game its self, but mine used to glitch. It doesnât anymore but it would glitch so bad that once it came back you would die because you couldnât control it. Or it would go but it wouldnât respond to what you were telling it to do. Other than that it is a REALLY good game.\n\nðâð»â¤ï¸ð·\n\nI think temple one is a great game Iâve been I played the first one and the second one and theyâre both really good but I think the first oneâs much better than the second one and my sister has been planned since she was five years old and she is now 15 and and she said that it was the best game sheâs ever played before and she used to play all the time and she really loved it and I think temper one is really good too but itâs like weird whatâs up weird itâs just like itâs fun and all but like like some games on its board when Iâm bored it gives me a headache and like I donât really like to play it a lot anymore but I havenât played temper one in like a year because usually when Iâm at a place with no Wi-Fi or some thing I go on my phone and I play Temple one for like an hour or something but like after like 30 minutes or an hour I start getting a headache and like itâs really bad and stuff so I take ibuprofen and stuff thatâs so thatâs and I think itâs an awesome game and I absolutely love it but sometimes itâs not that good"
