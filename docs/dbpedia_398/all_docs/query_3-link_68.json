        "text": "Looking for the best family movies? With the endless array of TV and movie options (including free full-length options on YouTube), it’s hard to pick a flick that the whole family will love. Well, bicker no more. From The Karate Kid to The Incredibles, we’ve made the decision easy with a definitive list of must-see childhood movies for children under 12. So grab some fun snacks and get that family movie night started!\n\nIf you’re looking for specific types of movies, check out these coming-of-age films, movies that tweens will love, movies for toddlers, and baseball movies for kids should watch together.\n\n1. It’s a Wonderful Life (1946)\n\nThere’s a reason people still watch this holiday classic year after year: Parents to tweens will appreciate this timeless tale of a once-hopeless man realizing the value of his own life with the help of a guardian angel.\n\nNot rated.\n\nRecommended for ages 9 and up.\n\n2. E.T. (1982)\n\nStill one of the best science fiction movies ever, E.T. is all about friendship and childhood. From Reese’s Pieces to the classic phrase “E.T. phone home,” every moment of this movie will live with your extraterrestrial forever.\n\nRated PG\n\nRecommended for ages 7 & up.\n\n3. Spirited Away (2002)\n\nThis animated film is a magical adventure and is considered one of Hayao Miyazaki‘s masterpieces. It stars a strong female protagonist but parents of younger kids beware: there are scary creatures, the parents turn into pigs, and in one scene a river dragon lingers on the verge of death.\n\nRated PG\n\nRecommended for ages 9 & up.\n\n4. Coco (2017)\n\nBased on the Mexican holiday, Dia de Los Muertos or Day of the Dead, Coco tells the tale of 12-year-old Miguel who finds himself in the Land of the Dead and with the help of his musician great-great-grandfather dives deep into his family history (and their generations-old ban on music!). There are strong family vibes in this blockbuster, and your kids will love the whimsically colorful, melodic story!\n\nA note for parents—this movie deals with the concept of mortality and could be slightly upsetting for young kids.\n\nRated PG\n\nRecommended for ages 7 & up.\n\n5. Frozen (2013) and Frozen 2 (2019)\n\nThis Disney classic (and its sequel) is one of the best movies for kids. The films about sisterhood, family, and love will surprisingly warm your hearts, fill your home with song, and should come with a disclaimer: For months afterward, your kids won’t sing anything but Let It Go, Into the Unknown, and Do You Want to Build a Snowman.\n\nRated PG.\n\nRecommended for ages 5 & up.\n\n6. Soul\n\nThis family movie from Pixar and Disney follows jazz musician and teacher Joe as he travels from life to the Great Before (instead of the Great Beyond). He’s not ready for his life to be over, so he’s determined to make it home. The first-rate cast including Jaime Foxx and Tina Fey, the amazing animation, and the wonderful music are just a few of the reasons to love this movie for kids.\n\nRated PG\n\nRecommended for ages 8 & up.\n\n7. Yes Day\n\nInspired by the beloved children’s book by the same name, Allison and Carlos decide to give their three kids a “Yes Day,” where there’s no saying no to anything the kids ask for or to do (within reason). Chaos ensues, and it becomes clear that all yes all the time isn’t always the best idea.\n\nRated PG\n\nRecommended for ages 7 & up.\n\n8. The Sword in the Stone (1963)\n\nFrom rags to riches, it’s the story of King Arthur in true to Disney style. Your lil’ knight will be giggling, dancing, and bopping to the wizarding whimsy of this animated musical.\n\nRated G.\n\nRecommended for ages 5 & up.\n\n9. Honey, I Shrunk the Kids (1989)\n\nA shrink ray accidentally goes off and sets a group of kids on a journey back home (even though they never leave their backyard) while their parents search high and low for them.\n\nRated PG.\n\nRecommended for ages 6 & up.\n\n10. Cool Runnings (1993)\n\nEverything seems stacked against these athletes who are completely unprepared for the cold, let alone bobsledding. Loosely based on a true story of the Jamaica national bobsled team, Cool Runnings is a real inspirational film for young dreamers.\n\nRated PG.\n\nRecommended for ages 8 & up.\n\nRelated: The Ultimate List of Dinosaur Movies for Kids\n\nRelated: Not-So-Spooky Halloween Movies for Kids\n\nRelated: 16 Kids’ Movies That Parents Love Too\n\nRelated: 10 Best ’90s Movies to Watch with Your Kids\n\nRelated: 10 ’80s Movies That Your Kids Need to See"
