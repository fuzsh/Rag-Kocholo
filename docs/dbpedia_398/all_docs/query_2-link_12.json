        "text": "We all have those few songs we stick towards the end of our running playlists for when we know we’ll be in dire need of a boost. Everyone’s got their personal preferences — whether it’s a good EDM song for you or an 80’s power ballad for your mom — but we wanted to get a more macro picture. We took a look at all the music runners have been pounding the pavement to in Runkeeper this last year to get a comprehensive look at what music makes you move the best. Warning: it’s about to get pretty weird in here.\n\nTop 40 songs for speed*\n\nLivin’ la Vida Loca, Ricky Martin\n\nPraise You In This Storm, Casting Crowns\n\nCan’t Stop, Maroon 5\n\nIronic, Alanis Morissette\n\nContact, Daft Punk\n\nTimes Like These, Foo Fighters\n\nMr. Saxobeat — Radio Edit, Alexandra Stan\n\nHe Is With Us, Love & The Outcome\n\nYour Love, The Outfield\n\nFastest Girl In Town, Miranda Lambert\n\nKiss You, One Direction\n\nMylo Xyloto, Coldplay\n\nParadise By the Dashboard Light, Meat Loaf\n\nNew Love, Maroon 5\n\nRidin’ Solo, Jason Derulo\n\nJump, Rihanna\n\nSingle Ladies (Put a Ring On It), Beyoncé\n\nIt’s a Long Way to the Top (If You Wanna Rock ’N’ Roll), AC/DC\n\nWork It — Promo, Missy Elliott\n\nLose Yourself, Eminem\n\nMr. Brightside, The Killers\n\nTreasured Soul, Michael Calfan\n\nMoondance, Van Morrison\n\nRed Lights, Tiësto\n\nJessie’s Girl, Rick Springfield\n\nHot n Cold, Katy Perry\n\nShe’s Alright, Stereophonics\n\nLet It Go, Idina Menzel\n\nCups (Movie Version), Anna Kendrick\n\nImmigrant Song, Led Zeppelin\n\nShe Looks So Perfect, 5 Seconds of Summer\n\nSkyfall, ADELE\n\nPlay That Funky Music, Wild Cherry\n\nGood Vibrations (feat. Loleatta Holloway), Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch\n\nSnow (Hey Oh), Red Hot Chili Peppers\n\nJungle — Remix, X Ambassadors\n\nDrop It Like This — Original Mix, TST\n\nQueen of Peace, Florence + The Machine\n\nTroublemaker (feat. Flo Rida), Olly Murs\n\nLego House, Ed Sheeran\n\nThat’s right, runners’ speed on average increased the most when listening to “Livin’ La Vida Loca.” The good news here is that it seems no genre is excluded. Latin pop, Christian rock, country, rap, top 40, acoustic singer songwriters, Romanian vocalists (I had to look up Alexandra Stan), even Meat Loaf makes an appearance. Meat Loaf! The bad news is this is going to be a pretty jarring playlist to run to. Because I would do anything for a run, but I won’t do that.\n\nDon’t worry, we’ve already built this playlist for you on Spotify.\n\n*Songs appear on this Spotify playlist in descending order of those that had the greatest impact on runners’ speed.\n\nIf that mix is just a little toooo weird for you and you’d rather stick with a single speed-inducing artist for the course of your run, we’ve got just the answer for you. Hands down you should listen to….\n\nThat’s right, not only is the Japanese metal-pop girl band Babymetal taking the world by storm, they’re whipping feet into a fury. They were the artist where we observed the largest increase in speed as runners listened to them. Of course they’re not your only option, but if you really want to go faster, you better get comfortable with Japanese music, as bands Hi-Standard and 木村カエラ (Kaela Kimura) also hit the top 5.\n\nTop 10 artists that will help you run faster\n\nBABYMETAL\n\nHi-STANDARD\n\nLove & The Outcome\n\nLucinda Williams\n\n木村カエラ\n\nBlue Öyster Cult\n\nDrapht\n\nLighthouse Family\n\nPANG!\n\nBen Lee\n\nBut faster isn’t always better. Especially if you’re one of those people takes off way too soon and leaves nothing in the tank for those later miles. If you have a hard time remembering to pace yourself, consider some of these songs, which definitely have a slowing effect for Runkeeper runners.\n\nTop 40 songs for people who really need to pace themselves**\n\nElsa and Anna, Christophe Beck\n\nSend My Love (To Your New Lover), ADELE\n\nSave the World (Radio Mix), Swedish House Mafia\n\nLights (Single Version), Ellie Goulding\n\nStarlight, Taylor Swift\n\nMaterial Girl, Madonna\n\nIgnorance, Paramore\n\nCreep, Radiohead\n\nWhite Blank Page, Mumford & Sons\n\nStarting Over, Mr.Children\n\nPowerful (feat. Ellie Goulding & Tarrus Riley), Major Lazer\n\nGold, Imagine Dragons\n\nSmoke and Mirrors, Imagine Dragons\n\nID — Ultra Music Festival Anthem, Kygo\n\nCome And Get It, John Newman\n\nHit It, Deorro\n\nThunderstruck, AC/DC\n\nLove Don’t Die, The Fray\n\nShow Me Love — EDX Remix / Radio Edit, Sam Feldt\n\nSo F**kin’ Romantic, Matthew Koma\n\nTry, Colbie Caillat\n\nClose Your Eyes, Meghan Trainor\n\nCountry Grammar (Hot…), Nelly\n\nIngen annan rör mig som du, Norlie & KKV\n\nHarder Better Faster Stronger, Daft Punk\n\nCome Out and Play, The Offspring\n\nWelcome To Paradise, Green Day\n\nThe Party (This Is How We Do It) [feat. Montell Jordan], Joe Stone\n\nLift Your Head Weary Sinner (Chains), Crowder\n\nLife Is Worth Living, Justin Bieber\n\nF**kin’ Problems, A$AP Rocky\n\nEye of the Needle, Sia\n\nOne Call Away, Charlie Puth\n\nLips of an Angel, Hinder\n\nBeautiful, Superfly\n\nBlack Hole Sun, Soundgarden\n\nLose Control (feat. Ciara & Fat Man Scoop), Missy Elliott\n\nHeadlines, Drake\n\nI’ll Be Waiting, ADELE\n\nI Like Tuh, Carnage\n\nIs anyone really shocked that Mumford & Sons puts you to sleep — err — slows you down? Yeah, me neither. And while “Let It Go” is sure to get your kids fired up (and places #28 on that speed list), the more subdued instrumental “Elsa and Anna” track from the Frozen soundtrack probably isn’t going to help you break any records.\n\nListen here:\n\n**Songs appear here in order of those that have the most slowing effect on runners. Songs not available in the Spotify Playlist include: #2 “Send My Love (To Your New Lover),” ADELE; #5 “Starlight,” Taylor Swift, #10: “Starting Over,” Mr.Children, #35 “『Beautiful』,” Superfly.\n\nFalse promises\n\nA couple songs don’t quite do what you’d think. Bruce Springsteen’s “Born to Run” appears to be associated with slower-than-average paces, for instance, as does Daft Punk’s “Harder Faster Better Stronger.” Daft will have to take consolation in the fact that their song “Contact” takes the No. 5 spot for songs that speed you up.\n\nMr. and Mrs. Popular\n\nIf you’re less worried about speed and more in need of running music inspiration, we’ve also taken a look at the artists and albums that get played the most on runs. Of course your perfect running soundtrack is going to vary from your college-aged cousin’s, so we had some fun slicing and dicing the results across different demographics.\n\nRemember when Apple dramatically concluded their 2014 Apple Live event with the surprise announcement they’d be installing U2’s Songs of Innocencealbum on everyone’s phone? Well, for most people it’s stuck and made its way onto their running playlists. It’s unclear whether that’s intentional on the listener’s part or no, so that’s why we’ve bumped up these next few top 10 lists to 11 entries. I’m sure glad we did because it allowed Macklemore & Ryan Lewis’s The Heist to sneak in onto this one.\n\nTop 11 most popular albums for running\n\nSongs of Innocence, U2\n\n1989, Taylor Swift\n\nTitle, Meghan Trainor\n\nNight Visions, Imagine Dragons\n\nx, Ed Sheeran\n\nV, Maroon 5\n\nPurpose, Justin Bieber\n\nPRISM , Katy Perry\n\nNative, OneRepublic\n\nTALKING IS HARD, WALK THE MOON\n\nThe Heist, Macklemore & Ryan Lewis\n\nWe also took a look at which artists get played the most frequently on runs, beyond any one particular album. You’ll definitely see some overlap between this list and the one above it, but also a few new faces.\n\nTop 11 most popular artists for running\n\nU2\n\nTaylor Swift\n\nAvicii\n\nMaroon 5\n\nKaty Perry\n\nColdplay\n\nCalvin Harris\n\nEminem\n\nDavid Guetta\n\nJustin Bieber\n\nRihanna\n\nOf course U2 tops the charts again here, but if we exclude Songs of Innocencefrom the running, U2 drops from #1 all the way to #24. And U2 doesn’t rank high at all for runners 24 and under, even when Songs of Innocence is included. Looks like they know how to get things off their phone. Millennials (aka snake people), you so savvy. Speaking of those young people…\n\nHere are the top 10 most popular artists for runners 24 & under\n\nJustin Bieber\n\nAvicii\n\nTaylor Swift\n\nThe Weeknd\n\nCalvin Harris\n\nDrake\n\nOne Direction\n\nMaroon 5\n\nEd Sheeran\n\nDavid Guetta\n\nEven though Bieber’s clearly trying to appeal to the older crowd with this latest album, the under 25 runners were the ones who kept him at the top of running playlists. And on the other end of the spectrum….\n\nTop 11 most popular artists for runners 45 & older\n\nU2\n\nAdele\n\nColdplay\n\nMaroon 5\n\nQueen\n\nKaty Perry\n\nAvicii\n\nTaylor Swift\n\nRihanna\n\nP!nk\n\nThe Beatles\n\nAgain, we’re not sure whether keeping that U2 album on their phones was intentional for this crowd or not, but just in case we went all the way to 11 so The Beatles could sneak in. Impressive, considering their music only hit streaming music services like Spotify in December.\n\nBattle of the sexes: Madonna vs. Pitbull\n\nLet’s kick off this last section with a fun trivia question.\n\nWhich of these artists is more popular with men than with women?\n\nA. Pitbull\n\nB. Madonna\n\nC. Avicii\n\nD. Pharrell Williams\n\nANSWER:\n\nB) Madonna, the material girl herself!\n\nMen are also more likely to run to Foo Fighters, AC/DC, Queen, Metallica, Eminem, Michael Jackson, and Kanye West. Women runners are a lot more likely to listen to P!nk, Meghan Trainor, Pitbull, One Direction, Mark Ronson, Pharrell Williams, and Kelly Clarkson."
