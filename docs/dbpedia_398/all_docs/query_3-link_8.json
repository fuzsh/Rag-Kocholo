        "text": "In the comics\n\nMarvel's site states:\n\nQuicksilver possessed superhuman speed, and could travel on foot at speeds exceeding the speed of sound for hundreds of miles before tiring; he could \"fly\" for short distances by flapping his arms or \"vibrating\" his legs; he could also use his speed to create cyclones, dodge machine gun and laser fire, and run up walls and across water.\n\nHowever, his powers are amplified later on.\n\nFollowing the loss of his mutant nature, Quicksilver exposed himself to the Terrigen Mists, resulting in him now possessing the power to vibrate his atoms so quickly he travels forward in time. His molecular speed that he generates displaces him out of the mainstream time/space so that he is able to propel himself into the future. He can leap from thirty seconds to up to twelve days, and remain for several minutes to several hours before being recalled to his present time once his body tires, or he can return at will before his time is up. As he returns from his trip, he returns the exact moment he left so as to appear that he has been gone for half a nano-second. He is able to bring inorganic objects from the future back to his correct time, although it has yet been shown what would happen if he attempted to bring organic objects with him.\n\nIn the X-Men movies by Fox\n\nThe movie's official website simply lists his maximum speed as \"faster than the speed of sound\".\n\nIn the Marvel Cinematic Universe\n\nUnfortunately, no concrete information regarding Quicksilver's maximum speed has been made public as of yet. During the course of the movie, we see Quicksilver outrunning Mjolnir and arrows, as well as altering the trajectory of arrow in mid-flight. This is not necessarily indicative of the limits of his abilities. Even the junior novelization only describes his speed as \"faster than a bullet train\" and \"faster than a jet\".\n\nYes we all know that Quicksilver can run super fast. Some would say he runs faster than the speed of sound. But if you think further back into the comics he actually can run at the speed of time. Thus making everything come to a stand still. However in Days of Future Past, he is portrayed as having his powers at full level, when in the comics he only got around to his full flex of powers during his time with the Avengers 80 years later give or take.\n\nBut the thing that really gets me thinking his if he can run at the speed of sound or whatever. In the scene of the end credits of Captain America: The Winter Soldier he is trying to get out of his captivity from Hydra. Hello, if you can run almost as fast as time you could just vibrate your body to a certain speed and walk straight out. And the Scarlet Witch for crying out loud. Her powers have devastating effects. She's known to be one of the most badass super heroines (don't let me forget when she goes bat shit crazy she also wipes out half of the friggin Marvel universe heroes included) but Quicksilver can definitely put time in a bottle."
