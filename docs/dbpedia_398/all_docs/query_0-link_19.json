        "text": "Step aside, Flash.\n\nOn your left, Cap.\n\nTom Cruise has been running circles around Hollywood decades before today’s silver screen hobby joggers.\n\n“Tom Cruise is to running what Nic Cage is to losing his shit,” writes Joshua Rivera for GQ. “Sure, other people try as hard — maybe even harder — but they’re all missing something primal, some crazy voodoo that causes Cruise to run on-screen and make the audience short of breath.”\n\nIndeed, Mr. Rivera presents a compelling case for Cruise as the running GOAT. Other actors, including Cary Grant, Adam West, and Sylvester Stallone (aka Rocky Balboa) made fantastic efforts at super speed, but Cruise retains the title of fastest feet.\n\nAndy Schneider and Jonathan Britnell from Burger Fiction created a video of every Tom Cruise run. All of them. Ironically, the video opens with Maverick and Goose (from Top Gun) walking, though their iconic exchange quickly sets the tone for what’s to come:\n\n“I feel the need. The need for speed.”\n\nThe Burger Fiction video, dated October 14, 2016, concludes with Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation, released on July 31, 2015, in the United States."
