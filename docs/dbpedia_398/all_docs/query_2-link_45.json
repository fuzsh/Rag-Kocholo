Using the speed slider is useful for custom speed adjustments, because as you drag the slider, you see the clipâ€™s duration change in the timeline.\n\nDo one of the following:\n\nSlow down the selected part of the clip: Click the Speed pop-up menu and choose Slow.\n\nBy default, the speed is set to 50%, but you can click any speed button.\n\nSpeed up the selected part of the clip: Click the Speed pop-up menu and choose Fast.\n\nBy default, the speed is set to twice normal speed (2x), but you can click any speed button.\n\nSet a custom speed for the selected part of the clip: Click the Speed pop-up menu, choose Custom, and type a number in the field.\n\nThe speed change is applied to the selected range, and speed sliders appear above the selected range and any areas of the clip outside the selected range.\n\nWhen you play back the clip, it begins playing at normal speed, then changes to the speed you set, then returns to normal speed again at the end of the clip.\n\nTo adjust the speed of the selected range or an area outside it, drag any of the three speed sliders at the top of the clip.\n\nClick the Auto button.\n\nThe frame rate of the selected clip is adjusted to match the frame rate of the rest of the movie.\n\nNote: If the clip has a duration longer than 3 seconds, iMovie adjusts the speed at the beginning and end of the clip, to emphasize the slow motion."
