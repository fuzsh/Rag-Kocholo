        "text": "[Wendy] Ever tried running backwards?\n\nWhat about running a mile backwards\n\nin five and a half minutes?\n\nThis man has.\n\nThat five minutes and 30 second backwards mile\n\nGo! A lot of times people think\n\nmaybe I ran the film in reverse.\n\nI'm like, no, I'm actually like literally running backwards.\n\n[Wendy] Meet Aaron Yoder,\n\none of the world's fastest backwards runners\n\nwith that mile being about twice as fast\n\nas the average forwards runner,\n\nand that's just one in a long list\n\nof backwards running accolades.\n\nI had held three Guinness World Records,\n\nseven world titles, 10 American titles,\n\nand certainly more records to come.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nBackwards running is certainly a niche sport\n\njust because it's so weird to think about.\n\nIs it actually a thing?\n\nI mean, when I was in Germany\n\ndoing my first World Championships,\n\nthere's about 100 athletes\n\nand probably 100 spectators out there watching.\n\n[Wendy] But even if the sport is obscure,\n\nAaron loves going out to run\n\nand always strives to grow as an athlete.\n\nWe're currently at Coronado Heights\n\nright outside of Lindsborg, Kansas,\n\nand this is a great place that I use for doing my long runs.\n\nI would say on a given day,\n\nI run two to three miles backwards.\n\nI try not to look behind\n\nbecause just like forward running,\n\nif you are turning around and looking behind you,\n\nthen that slows you down.\n\nI simply make sure that the road is clear,\n\nthen I just go after it.\n\nI really have to trust myself and kind of run by faith.\n\nYou have to have a lot of belief that you're good.\n\nGod's got you.\n\nAs far as the mechanics of backwards running,\n\nI'm lifting my feet up.\n\nAnother thing that I use as a cue is kicking a soccer ball.\n\nSo I'll bring that leg out in front,\n\nand then I'm lifting my foot up\n\nand I'm placing it back on the ground,\n\nmaking sure my foot is directly underneath my hips.\n\nAnd I'm trying to make sure as I make ground contact\n\nthat my toe is up so I get a nice springboard.\n\nThere's a temptation to doing kind of a back pedal\n\nwhere you're bent over and you're kinda reaching back,\n\nbut when you're staying nice and tall,\n\nyour balance is gonna be enhanced.\n\nVery similar to forward running,\n\nyou don't want to be reaching back behind,\n\nbut simply lifting and pushing, maintaining good posture.\n\nDon't want my head up in the sky\n\nor be looking straight down.\n\nI'm basically just gazing about 20 meters in front.\n\nSo I keep good neutral spine position,\n\ntrying to keep my upper body nice and loose,\n\ndriving my elbow backwards, keeping my hands to the side,\n\nand really just staying nice and tall.\n\nWhen I'm training for a distance run,\n\nI'm not lifting my feet up as much,\n\nso I'm not activating the hip flexor\n\nand the quadricep quite as much\n\nas I would if I was running at the track.\n\nWe're here at Bethany College Track.\n\nThis is where I coach.\n\nThis is where I train.\n\nThis is where all the magic happens.\n\nSome of the big things that change\n\nwith backwards running is the start.\n\nForward sprinters would start in a four point stance.\n\nTheir lead leg and their strong leg is out in front,\n\nand then they would be up in this position.\n\nWith backwards running, you can't really use blocks.\n\nSo I start in a two point position,\n\nand whichever is your stronger leg,\n\nfor me, it's my right, is in the back.\n\nI make sure I'm up on the forefoot, the heels are up,\n\nand then when I start, I try to swing my torso backwards,\n\nbut that's what's in my mind when I'm trying\n\nto go as fast as humanly possible.\n\n[Wendy] With that in mind,\n\nwe decided to see just how fast Aaron can run.\n\n[gun pops] [upbeat music]\n\nI felt that.\n\nDoes it look fast?\n\nIt looks fast. I need coaching, you know.\n\nIt looked fast.\n\nI'm chasing the dragon.\n\nNow I'm starting to run tense\n\n'cause I'm like trying too hard,\n\n[Wendy] Pushing himself to the limit,\n\nAaron hit 12 miles per hour at a sprint,\n\nwhich is a five minute mile pace,\n\nbut as fast as Aaron now is,\n\nhis retro running pursuits began with a setback.\n\nWhen I was halfway through college,\n\nI banged my knee up, had torn my meniscus.\n\nI went in for surgery, started having some real issues\n\nlike just a lot of pain,\n\nyou know, slowing down in my training.\n\nSo I went back to the doctor and said,\n\nYou know, you got pretty bad arthritis.\n\nLike I would recommend you never run again.\n\nRemember that day, I was at Coronado Heights,\n\njust really trying to figure out\n\nhow I can just get away from everything.\n\nAnd I remember on that particular day,\n\nit is almost as if God was saying, Just turn it around.\n\nAnd so I went and ran four miles backwards with no pain.\n\nThe new dream became I'm gonna train for six weeks\n\nand see where it takes me.\n\nSo I remember thinking it's like\n\nthis is just a good type of exercise for me.\n\nAnd I started looking.\n\nIt's like there's world championships,\n\nthere's world records, and I'm like,\n\nam I actually gonna step up and make an attempt?\n\nThen on the first attempt, I broke the record.\n\nAh! Now.\n\nMaybe not a lot of people understand like,\n\nwhy would you wanna put yourself through that pain?\n\nSomebody who's going through a challenge in life,\n\na student or an athlete,\n\nthey could maybe look at my perspective.\n\nI know I'm at my best when I've put myself\n\nthrough some sort of challenge each day.\n\nI think people should try running backwards\n\nbecause it's just a different overall perspective.\n\nIn American culture, we're goal-oriented,\n\nand we're forward-driven.\n\nSo it allows you to think about how far I've come\n\nrather than how far I need to continue to go.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nThis is my office.\n\nAs a coach here and teacher at Bethany,\n\nhave a lot of things that really proud of\n\nin terms of what we've done as a team.\n\nI have pictures of some teams\n\nthat have qualified for Nationals.\n\nI definitely love [claps] backwards running,\n\nlove being a world record holder,\n\nbut to me what's more important\n\nis being able to teach and coach.\n\nThis time in their life is very important,\n\nand I'm grateful to have the opportunity\n\nto hopefully inspire,\n\nbut certainly I get a lot of inspiration\n\nfrom working with everyone that I do.\n\n[Wendy] And with his enthusiasm for coaching,\n\nAaron volunteered to teach me to run backwards\n\nas fast as he can.\n\nReady to run backwards, Wendy?\n\nIt'll be my first time.\n\nOkay, Wendy, you're on.\n\nLet's see what you got just from scratch.\n\nCan I look behind me,\n\nor should I keep looking straight?\n\nMaybe I would try to stay, you know, looking this way.\n\nAll right. [Wendy laughs]\n\nYou got some really good things\n\nthat you're doing with posture,\n\nbut you started with the same leg\n\nand same arm out in front.\n\nYou know we're not Mario characters\n\nrunning around like this, doing, doing.\n\nWe run with a cross connection.\n\nYour right leg's out in front,\n\nso then your left hand needs to be here.\n\nSo then when you start going,\n\nyour arms are switching,\n\nand then just start going backwards a little bit.\n\nThere we go.\n\nHey, you can do it, you can do it.\n\nSo let's try it again.\n\nGo.\n\nThere we go, there we go, there we go.\n\nThat's pretty good, that's pretty good, that's pretty good.\n\nThere we go, good, good. [Wendy laughs]\n\nI'm bending this knee in the front\n\nbecause I'm still gonna push off a little bit here.\n\nYou don't wanna be already straight.\n\nThat way you get a little bit of push off both legs.\n\nGo,\n\nLook at that, look at that.\n\nJust keep on doing it, just keep on doing it.\n\nI got it, I got it, I got it, ah!\n\nWhew, yeah, I could do this.\n\nSee. I looked behind me. [laughs]\n\nYeah, that's all right.\n\nThere's a sandbag.\n\nIt's like there's this...\n\n[both laugh]\n\nWell, I think I'm a professional.\n\nLet's race.\n\nLet's go. On your mark, get set, go.\n\nWell, it's close.\n\nSo close! That's close.\n\nThat is so close. So close.\n\nThat might need to need\n\nto go to the cameras. We need a photo finish here.\n\nThat might hundredths of a second.\n\nI was right behind you. Good job, you.\n\n[hands clap] So you beat me\n\nby a little bit.\n\nCouple feet, maybe. Game of inches,\n\ngame of yards. That's right.\n\nWhat if I run forward against you backwards?\n\nI like that, yeah. On your mark,\n\nget set, go.\n\n[both laugh]\n\nWell, I'm really trying.\n\n[laughs] That one was actually a photo finish.\n\nBut if I actually lean backwards,\n\nI don't know if I wanna do that.\n\nThere's no catching yourself.\n\nAll right, you're a clearly very fast backwards runner\n\nbecause you are kind of at speed\n\nwith my fastest forward running.\n\nI think you did a great job\n\nand definitely presented a good challenge.\n\nMaybe next time, I'll be able to get you\n\nwith the forward running.\n\nThank you so much, coach.\n\nAs much as he wins, winning is never the end goal for Aaron\n\nwho has dedicated himself to backwards running\n\nas a true self-fulfilling passion.\n\nI love running backwards.\n\nSomeone had mentioned at one point,\n\nWell, you're just such a natural athlete.\n\nYou wouldn't even be good at backwards running\n\nif it wasn't for that.\n\nThe thing is, I'm not a natural backwards runner\n\nbecause it's not natural.\n\nWe're not designed to do that,\n\nbut it does feel natural to me.\n\nI certainly see backwards running growing.\n\nYou know, if it becomes an Olympic sport,\n\nthen maybe the NCAA picks up something like that,\n\nand then you have schools\n\nthat could give people opportunities\n\nthat maybe they're not a good forward runner,\n\nbut they're a great backwards runner.\n\nSo who would be the coach for that?\n\nIt would be me."
