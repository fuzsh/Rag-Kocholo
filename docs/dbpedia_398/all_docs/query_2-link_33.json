        "text": "Background\n\nOne of the most important parameters of track design is compliance, and it is mainly in this respect that the new track differs from other indoor tracks. Just how compliant—or, alternatively, how stiff—should a track be? In 1976, when the new track was being designed, the Harvard track coach, Bill McCurdy, and the Harvard Planning Office sought our advice on this question. At that time there was no information available concerning the effect of a given track surface on running speed and comfort. It is intuitively clear, however, that running on a compliant surface such as grass is less conducive to injury than running on a hard surface such as asphalt. Indeed, if comfort were the only consideration, all tracks would be extremely springy, perhaps as springy as a diving board. Intuition also suggests, however, that on a springy track the time spent rebounding from the surface is increased, so that a runner is slowed down. Hence if a running track is to be fast, its compliance must be limited.\n\nOne might therefore suppose the hardest track surfaces are the fastest, but that is not the case. A compliant surface acts as a spring, and we found that if the stiffness of the spring is closely tuned to the mechanical properties of the human runner, the runner’s speed can be increased. In other words, there is a specific intermediate track compliance at which running speed is optimized. At that optimum compliance the runner stepping down onto the track stores elastic energy in its surface, much as a pole vaulter stores elastic energy in bending a fiberglass pole, which is recovered as the pole propels him upward. A track whose compliance is in the theoretically optimum range can be called a tuned track.\n\nA tuned track is special only in that its properties are particularly compatible with those of the runner. Hence our first step in designing such a track was to develop a model of the mechanics of running, one that was complex enough to be realistic but simple enough to be mathematically manageable. Running speed is determined by several parameters. With the physiological simplifications introduced in the model it was possible to derive mathematical expressions for those parameters as functions of track stiffness. In this way we were able to predict the effect various track compliances would have on running speed. Our final step was to test the model predictions with runners and experimental tracks. The ultimate test was provided by the new Harvard track, whose wood substructure is designed to achieve a compliance in the range we found to be optimum. The results of these tests, which are discussed below, are in good agreement with the theoretical predictions.\n\nLiterature Review - , , ,\n\nRunning is essentially a series of bounds. As the runner’s foot strikes the running surface the antigravity muscles that support his skeleton contract and ultimately reverse the downward velocity of his body. To understand how our model was devised and why the tuned track works, it is necessary to understand how the physiological properties of these muscles and the reflexes that control them determine the functioning of the runner as a mechanical system.\n\nConsider first an isolated muscle, removed from an animal and placed in an apparatus that measures its force at a constant length. With its blood supply cut off, a muscle from a mammal such as a rat will quickly fatigue and die, but in a suitably oxygenated bath a muscle from a small amphibian such as a frog will remain alive for hours or even days. A muscle that is not being stimulated to contract is said to be resting. When the force developed in the resting muscle is plotted against the length of the muscle, the force-length relation curves upward, that is, the force increases with length. The slope dF/dx of the force-length curve is the stiffness of the muscle, and the curve shows that it too increases with length. (Resting muscle is stiffer at greater lengths for the same reason a nylon stocking feels stiffer as it is stretched. As the muscle is lengthened more of the collagen fibers in the connective tissue associated with it become taut and begin bearing load.)\n\nIf a resting muscle is given a small electric shock‚ either directly or through the nerve that supplies it‚ the force in the muscle rises above the resting level and then quickly drops. This momentary rise in force, called a twitch, is the basic event in muscle contraction. In a sustained activity such as running, a train of twitches can merge at an elevated level of force; in this state the muscle is said to be tetanized. The force-length curve for tetanized muscle shows that, as in resting muscle, force increases with length. The same property is exhibited by a mechanical system: a coiled spring. It was this fact that suggested to us a model of running in which the muscles would be represented by springs.\n\nThe difference in force between tetanized muscle and resting muscle is termed developed tension. An important phenomenon having to do with developed tension is observed when tetanized muscle is placed in another type of apparatus: one in which the muscle is allowed to shorten and pick up a weight so that its shortening velocity can be determined. This experiment reveals that the shortening velocity does not increase throughout the shortening period; rather, after a brief starting period the muscle shortens at a constant speed. When the shortening velocity is measured with different weights, it becomes apparent that muscle shortens more rapidly when it is working against lighter weights. It is as if a damping element—a dashpot, or shock absorber—were subtracting some of the developed tension. When the damping phenomenon was first discovered some 50 years ago, it was suggested that something like a mechanical dash-pot was actually present in muscle, but it is now clear that the damping effect is a property of the force-generating mechanism itself, specifically of the interaction of actin and myosin, the contractile proteins of muscle.\n\nHence an isolated muscle shortening against a constant load behaves like a damped spring, or, more precisely, like a stretched spring acting in parallel with a dashpot. In the body, however, the functioning of the muscles is controlled by the nervous system. It is conceivable that under such conditions the spring-and-dashpot system might not apply. What we found is that with certain elaborations the model derived from the inherent properties of isolated muscles also describes muscles and reflexes as they function in the feedback control system of the body. (It should be noted that a mathematically linear spring, which has constant stiffness at any length, is utilized in the model, even though an isolated muscle acts as a mathematically nonlinear spring, which has variable stiffness. Recent experiments concerning reflexes, which we shall discuss, serve to justify this simplification.)\n\nMuscle fibers receive their commands, or electrochemical stimuli, directly from the specialized nerve cells in the spinal cord called alpha motoneurons, . The traffic of impulses along the axon, or long fiber, of an alpha motoneuron is efferent: it moves outward from the spinal cord and the rest of the central nervous system. Information comes back to the central nervous system along afferent pathways whose nerve-cell bodies are found in the dorsal-root ganglion: a swelling of the peripheral nerve just outside the spinal cord. The fibers of these nerve cells terminate in receptors that are specialized to respond most effectively to certain types of stimuli. Receptors in the locomotor system provide the central nervous system with the information that makes smooth movement possible. In control engineering the route from a receptor to the central nervous system over afferent pathways and from the central nervous system to an effector organ (such as a muscle) over efferent pathways is called a feedback loop; in physiology it is called a reflex arc.\n\nFor example, when a physician strikes the large tendon below a patient’s kneecap with a hammer, he is testing the muscle-control system known as the stretch reflex. When the hammer strikes the tendon, the quadriceps group of muscles is stretched momentarily. As the muscles lengthen, stretch receptors in them (spindles) also lengthen and transmit a burst of impulses. This information travels along an afferent pathway to the quadriceps alpha motoneurons, eliciting the kick that tells the physician the patient’s neuromuscular wiring is in good condition.\n\nTwo groups of afferent pathways designated Ia and Ib are the most important ones in the muscle-control system. The Ia pathways innervate the stretch receptors. Since stretch receptors are connected in parallel with muscles, they are primarily sensitive to muscle length. For example, in the stretch-reflex test an increase in the length of the quadriceps muscles sends information along an afferent Ia pathway. The Ib pathways innervate the receptors known as Golgi tendon organs, which are mainly sensitive to muscle force.\n\nStretch receptors respond to dynamic stimuli as well as static ones: they are sensitive to the rates of change in the strength of stimuli as well as to the changes themselves. In mechanical terms the stretch receptors encode and send back to the spinal cord not only position information but also velocity information.\n\nConsider a spindle-organ receptor that is being steadily lengthened. The rate of change in length begins at zero, rises to a constant level and then falls back to zero when the lengthening stops. Experimental results show that the magnitude of the spindle response is proportional not to the sum of the “ramp” function representing the change in length and the step function representing the rate of change in length but to a sluggish version of the sum. The sluggishness is due partly to a property of all muscles, including spindles, known as series elasticity, and partly to the dashpot property of the receptors. In other words the sluggishness is an intrinsic property of the rate sensitivity of the reflex.\n\nThe spindle organ is itself composed of muscle cells and is separately innervated by the nerve cells called gamma motoneurons. Hence the length at which it sends a given intermediate frequency of impulses to the spinal cord can be changed by input from the higher motor centers. That makes the spindle organ a specialized type of strain gauge: a length-reporting device that converts mechanical stretch into nerve impulses, which in this case can be recalibrated to accommodate large-scale changes such as a change in the position of the body.\n\nConsider again the stretch-reflex arc, where the final response to an imposed lengthening of muscle was the patient’s kick reaction. Because the imposed muscle lengthening ultimately produced this muscle shortening, the reflex arc is a negative-feedback control system. Both the length and the rate of change of the length of the quadriceps muscles are reported along the Ia pathway as negativefeedback signals. Considering the mass of the leg, one can correctly predict that the normal overall response to the hammer blow will be a heavily damped, decaying oscillation of the knee angle, with the velocity feedback from the muscle giving rise to the damping effect. If the stretch receptor were sensitive only to muscle length, there would be no feedback damping, and in the absence of friction the oscillation would continue indefinitely.\n\nWhat is the control function of the Golgi tendon organs, the group of receptors sensitive to muscle force? For many years it was believed their only role was to turn off the alpha-motoneuron activity and cause a muscle to relax whenever a critical muscle force, which might be capable of injuring the muscle, was exceeded. Newer evidence shows, however, that feedback from the Golgi tendon organs may also help to modify the stretch reflex in such a way that muscle stiffness, rather than muscle force or length, is the controlled property. J. A. Hoffer and S. Andreassen Ref. [2] of the University of Alberta measured the increase in the overall stiffness of the plantar-flexor muscles in the ankle of the cat as a function of muscle force. In their first set of experiments the afferent pathways carrying information from the muscle spindles and Golgi tendon organs were intact. At low forces stiffness rose with force, but at moderate and large forces it reached a plateau. In their second set of experiments the afferent pathways were severed: the stiffness of the same muscles was always lower (because a closed-loop negative-feedback control system is always stiffer than an uncontrolled system), but it continued to increase no matter how much force was applied. In other words, through the regulation of the muscle spindles and Golgi tendon organs, muscle stiffness at all forces except very low ones was moderately independent of muscle force.\n\nMaterials & Methods - , ,\n\nWe were able to get similar results with the reflexes controlling the antigravity muscles of the human leg. In our experiments weight lifters bearing loads of up to twice their body weight on their shoulders executed small bouncing motions on a long plank. The subjects kept their knees bent to the extent they would in running. Knowing the total mass of the subject and the weight (and therefore the force exerted on the muscles), the effective mass of the plank and the natural frequency of vibration, we could use a simple mathematical procedure to calculate the stiffness of the subjects. We found that at knee-flexion angles in the range appropriate for running, the controlled, or reflex, stiffness is virtually independent of load and consequently of muscle force.\n\nThe observation that the reflexes maintain muscle stiffness at an almost constant level turns out to have considerable practical value. Remember that the problem with using a mathematically linear spring to represent the muscles involved in running was that the spring has constant stiffness and the muscles do not. The results of the experiments imply that the change in muscle stiffness with muscle force observed in experiments with isolated muscles can be ignored. Actually during the first quarter or so of the ground-contact period in a running step the reflexes have not had time to act, and so’ the intrinsic properties of the muscles alone determine the stiffness and damping of the leg. In the second half of the contact period, however, the stiffness and damping are almost certainly under reflex control and therefore are reasonably well represented by a damped linear spring.\n\nWe are now able to complete our model of the mechanics of running, . We shall view the muscles and reflexes of the leg as a system consisting of a rack-and-pinion element acting in series with a damped spring [ ]. The rack-and-pinion element is included to emphasize the role of movement commands descending from higher motor centers; the spring represents the assumed constant stiffness of the muscles and reflexes, and the dashpot damping mechanism represents the intrinsic force-velocity property of the muscles and the rate sensitivity of the reflexes. In other words, the setting up of leg positions is modeled by the motion of the rack and pinion, and the effect of external force disturbances such as the impact of the track on the runner’s leg is modeled by the deflection of the damped spring. As we shall now show, the simplifications introduced by the model make it possible to calculate a runner’s speed on a track of arbitrary compliance with only a few items of information: the runner’s mass, the length of his leg, his spring stiffness and his step length and top running speed on a hard surface.\n\nWhat value of track compliance—if any—will optimize running speed? For our purposes the most useful way to measure running speed is as the ratio of step length (the distance the body moves forward while one foot is on the ground) to ground-contact time (the time the foot is on the ground). On a tuned track the ground-contact time should be minimized and the step length should be maximized. In the model it is primarily the runner’s mass and the motion of the damped spring that determine the body motion during the ground-contact phase and therefore the ground-contact time; it is the motion of the rack-and-pinion element that determines the leg and hip positions at the beginning and end of the ground-contact phase and therefore the step length."
