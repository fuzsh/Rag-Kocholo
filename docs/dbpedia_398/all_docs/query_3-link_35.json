        "text": "Although having a movie marathon can sometimes be accidental, there is nothing better than planning to spend all day watching films. If you have a lot of time on your hands this weekend, or are just looking for a relaxing activity to share with friends, you can never go wrong with watching hours upon hours of films in a row.\n\nThere are a lot of different types of movie marathons you can watch, but some of the best ones are done one franchise at a time. To help you plan yourself a marathon of cinema, we've gathered together 15 of the best options below as well as total runtimes for all of the movies combined.\n\nPlanet of the Apes Movies\n\nWith Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes now in theaters there's never been a better time for a classic sci-fi movie binge that isn’t Star Wars. The rest of Planet of the Apes movies are absolutely worth your time, and there are actually a total of 10 films in the franchise now. Although the newest films are not connected to the original series, and there are technically 3 Planet of the Apes timelines, it’s still a fun movie marathon filled with our ape overlords.\n\nWhile we don’t have the exact time it would take you to get through all of the Planet of the Apes movies, the sheer volume of films would realistically put you within a comfortable 2-day binge zone. You can also just stream the new prequel films and finish in a single day.\n\nX-Men Movies\n\nBefore Marvel movies became the MCU, the X-Men franchise reigned supreme. With 13 movies currently in the timeline, and Deadpool & Wolverine arriving next month, you can never go wrong with a good X-Men marathon. The chronological order of the franchise gets a bit wonky when you start factoring in time jumps and the Deadpool movies, but you can also just follow the Wolverine timeline for a shorter binge.\n\nIf you remove the Deadpool movies from the list, you can watch all of the X-Men movies in just over 22 hours. Though you’ll likely want to include Deadpool, because it’s Deadpool.\n\nFast and Furious Movies\n\nWith the arrival of Fast X last year, there are now officially 13 Fast and Furious movies. Nobody could have guessed that something that started as a series of racing movies would become a never ending franchise that even goes to space, but here we are. If you’re looking for an action-fueled movie marathon that is all about family, the Fast and Furious films should be right up your alley.\n\nIf you’re looking to watch the entire franchise in a weekend, all of the films together take almost 23 and half hours. Take a look at our guide to the Fast and furious movies in order for more info.\n\nLord of the Rings Movies\n\nOne of the most classic movie marathons is the original LotR trilogy. The epic fantasy story, based on J.R.R Tolkien’s Lord of the Rings books, has become a timeless classic. You can also include all 3 of the Hobbit movies and season 1 of Amazon’s Ring of Power if you want to binge the whole franchise.\n\nAll 6 of the feature-length films take about 19 and a half hours to watch when you combine runtimes. Add in Rings of Power episodes and there’s another 9 hours and 20 minutes of content. Take a look at our guide to the Lord of the Rings in order for more info.\n\nStar Wars Movies\n\nStar Wars is another one of those franchises that is seemingly just getting started. With the first season of Ahsoka happening right now and a ton of upcoming Star Wars projects, the series is growing at an exponential rate. There have been a total of 11 Star Wars movies released so far with more on the way. And if you factor in animated movies, episodes of The Clone Wars, The Mandalorian, and more, the timeline gets even longer.\n\nIf you want to do a movie marathon with just the live-action films, you’re looking at a total runtime of just over 25 hours. See our guide to all Star Wars movies and shows in order for more information about the timeline.\n\nPirates of the Caribbean Movies\n\nOut of all of the pirate movies out there, the Pirates of the Caribbean movies are the only ones to become a true franchise. There are a total of 5 feature-length films in the series, all of which feature Johnny Depp’s roguish and charming Jack Sparrow. We are still waiting on a release date for Pirates of the Caribbean 6, but in the meantime you can still marathon all of the movies in one day.\n\nWatching all 5 of the Pirates of the Caribbean movies in a row will take just a little over 12 hours.\n\nJurassic Park Movies\n\nThere are surprisingly few really good Dinosaur movies out there, so if you’re in the mood for a Dinosaur marathon, the Jurassic Park films are your best option. There are a total of 6 feature-length movies in the franchise as well as a couple of short films and an animated Netflix series. The two trilogies are split into the Jurassic Park movies and the Jurassic World movies, but they all exist on the same timeline.\n\nIf you’re planning on watching all of the movie at once, the combined runtimes are just a little over 10 hours. You can see our guide on the Jurassic Park movies in order for more info and where to watch the films.\n\nIndiana Jones Movies\n\nIndiana Jones is a movie franchise that spans over 4 decades, but only has 5 total movies in the series. With the latest film, Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, coming out this summer it’s a great time to dive back into the series. And if you’re planning on doing a Harrison Ford movie marathon, Indiana Jones is an excellent starting point as well.\n\nYou can potentially watch All of the Indiana Jones movies in one day, with a total combined runtime of just over 10 hours for all 5 films.\n\nThe Conjuring Movies\n\nThe Conjuring universe is surprisingly large, and if you’re just entering the series for the first time, it can be a pretty confusing timeline. There are a total of 8 movies in the franchise so far, with a 9th one arriving on September 8. This list includes The Conjuring films, Annabelle movies, and The Nun.\n\nIf you include all 8 movies and the 5 shorts in this horror movie marathon, you can potentially watch all of the Conjuring movies in just under 14 and a half hours. You can realistically catch up on the whole story, including The Nun 2, in just a weekend.\n\nTransformers Movies\n\nWith the new Transformers One movie arriving later this year it’s once again a good time to dive into a Transformers movie marathon. There are now a total of 7 feature-length films in the franchise, and all of them offer the action, explosions, and humor you can expect from Michael Bay. Transformer: Rise of the Beasts actually takes place earlier on in the timeline, so you watch it first and then move on to the original film shortly after.\n\nIf you want to watch all of the Transformers movies from start to finish, it will take you just a little over 16 and half hours to do so. This one is perfect for filling two days of a weekend with some sweet Transformers action.\n\nHarry Potter Movies\n\nAlthough the Fantastic Beast series went a bit off the rails at the end there, the Harry Potter movies in general are still one of the best movie marathons you can have. Filled with magic, wonder, and Weasleys, the Harry Potter universe is solidified in many adults who grew up reading the books. There was even a new game, Hogwarts Legacy, which brought fans to a time way before any of the movies happened.\n\nIf you want to exclude the Fantastic Beasts movies from your streaming marathon, you can get through all 8 of the Harry Potter movies in just under 20 hours. Adding in the prequel films will add another 6 hours and 49 minutes to that total.\n\nAlien Movies\n\nThere are a total of 8 movies in the Alien franchise. There are four in the mainline series of films, two Predator crossovers, and two prequels. There is also the upcoming Alien: Romulus movie arriving in August that make it the perfect time to rewatch all of these films.\n\nIf you're looking specifically for a space-horror movie marathon, the Alien films are a great place to start. It will take you just a little over 15 hours to watch every Alien movie in order, and only about 12 hours if your remove the Predator crossovers.\n\nThe Scream Movies\n\nThe Scream franchise is currently enjoying a surge in popularity after Scream 5 in 2022 followed by Scream 6, which came out in March of 2023. If you're looking for a horror movie marathon to watch in October that doesn't take itself too seriously, watching all the Scream movies in order is a great way to do so.\n\nIf you want to watch all 6 of the Ghostface movies in marathon form, it will take you a little over 11 and half hours to do so. Here's where you can watch all of the Scream movies online.\n\nJames Bond Movies\n\nJames Bond is one of the longest running movie franchises in existence. Because of this, there are a total of 26 movies played by 7 different James Bond actors. Allthough you can certainly try to watch every James Bond movie in order of release, it would be easier to pick a single Bond and watch all of the movies from that era. For the sake of this article, we'd suggest just marathoning the Daniel Craig Bond movies to start with.\n\nIf you did want to watch all 26 Bond films in a row, it would take you over 54 hours to do so. If you decide on a Daniel Craig Bond marathon, then you're looking at a more reasonable 7 hours and 40 minutes.\n\nThe Hunger Games Movies\n\nNow that the The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes is available to stream, it's a great time to go back and watch every Hunger Games movie in order. The latest film is a prequel, so once you've watched it, you can move on to the next films in the franchise without jumping around the timeline."
