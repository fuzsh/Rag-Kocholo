        "text": "01 of 25\n\nBaby Driver (2017)\n\nAn action crime movie two decades in the making, director Edgar Wright puts the pedal to the metal with Baby Driver, transforming what could have been just another heist film into a stylistic masterpiece with a soundtrack to match. The movie follows a young getaway driver named Baby (Ansel Elgort) whose attempts to extricate himself from a life of crime go awry after he is forced to participate in a post office robbery. Baby is a fantastic character — a young, Southern kid with tinnitus and a tragic past — surrounded by violent sadists, and the film is part mixtape, part love story, and part Reservoir Dogs-style murder romp. EW’s critic writes that Baby Driver “is a candy-colored action movie opera, where the music doesn’t just accompany the action — it fuels it.” —Ilana Gordon\n\nWhere to watch Baby Driver: Netflix\n\nEW grade: A– (read the review)\n\nDirector: Edgar Wright\n\nCast: Ansel Elgort, Kevin Spacey, Lily James, Eiza González, Jon Hamm, Jamie Foxx, Jon Bernthal\n\nRelated content: Speed of sounds: Edgar Wright's 20-year journey to make Baby Driver\n\n02 of 25\n\nCold Pursuit (2019)\n\nLiam Neeson has established himself in Hollywood as the purveyor of characters not to be trifled with. In Cold Pursuit, he once again plays a father seeking vengeance for wrongs perpetrated upon his family, only this time, he lives in a Colorado resort town called Kehoe where he works as a snowplow driver. What distinguishes Cold Pursuit from other offerings in Neeson’s arsenal of justice-hunting characters is the humor inherent in the film’s script. While not quite a comedy, the movie likes to veer into Tarantino territory, adorning fight scenes with bon mots and clever dialogue. The result could have left viewers cold, but Neeson and Laura Dern’s performances as grieving parents, and Hans Petter Moland’s fast-moving direction, help ground a film that EW’s critic describes as “the daffiest and most delirious” of Neeson’s recent work. Also starring Emmy Rossum as a local cop, Cold Pursuit is a thriller that doesn’t take long to heat up. —I.G.\n\nWhere to watch Cold Pursuit: Netflix\n\nEW grade: B+ (read the review)\n\nDirector: Hans Petter Moland\n\nCast: Liam Neeson, Laura Dern, Emmy Rossum, Michael Eklund\n\nRelated content: Liam Neeson's 20 best performances\n\n03 of 25\n\nDa 5 Bloods (2020)\n\nWars and wounds collide in Spike Lee's 2020 film Da 5 Bloods, a meditation on race, generational trauma, and American intervention. Toggling between the past and present, the film follows four Black war veterans as they return to Vietnam, intent on recovering a locker of gold bars and the body of their fallen friend and squad leader, Stormin' Norman (Chadwick Boseman), both of which were lost during a napalm strike. Guided in their quest by Tiên, the ex-girlfriend of one of the former soldiers, and forced to confront landmines — both real and emotional — the remainder of the squad must reconcile the horrors of their past with the difficulties of their present if they hope to escape Vietnam for a better future. Incorporating archival newsreel for additional context, Da 5 Bloods is a war film with action sequences, but many of the battles pit man against his memory. —I.G.\n\nWhere to watch Da 5 Bloods: Netflix\n\nEW grade: A– (read the review)\n\nDirector: Spike Lee\n\nCast: Chadwick Boseman, Delroy Lindo, Jonathan Majors, Norm Lewis, Isiah Whitlock Jr.\n\nRelated content: The Awardist podcast: Delroy Lindo on his titanic performance in Da 5 Bloods\n\n04 of 25\n\nDivergent (2015)\n\nIn a dystopic version of Chicago, 16-year-olds are sorted into different factions, depending on the human virtues they possess. But when it’s Tris Prior’s (Shailene Woodley) turn to be tested to determine which faction she belongs in, Tris learns that she falls into a separate class altogether. Categorized as Divergent, Tris is told that she has the power to think for herself, which makes her impervious to mind control, and a danger to the system. Told to conceal her identity, Tris chooses to join the Dauntless faction, which prioritizes bravery, but struggles to follow the commands of her instructor (Theo James) and keep up with her rival (Miles Teller). Also starring Kate Winslet in the role of steely leader Jeanine Matthews, and based on the best-selling series of young adult novels, Divergent unfolds like a science fiction version of Harry Potter, with similar elements to The Hunger Games. —I.G.\n\nWhere to watch Divergent: Netflix\n\nEW grade: B+ (read the review)\n\nDirector: Neil Burger\n\nCast: Shailene Woodley, Theo James, Miles Teller, Kate Winslet, Ashley Judd, Jai Courtney, Ray Stevenson, Zoë Kravitz, Tony Goldwyn, Maggie Q\n\nRelated content: The White Lotus star Theo James says he had to 'wrestle' his way out of typecasting after Divergent role\n\n05 of 25\n\nThe Equalizer 3 (2023)\n\nIn the third entry of The Equalizer saga, Denzel Washington's Robert McCall finds solace in the simplicity of sipping tea along the Amalfi Coast...and beating the living hell out of those foolish enough to cross his path. Turning away from his life as an indestructible DIA officer, the former Marine seeks sanctuary from the scars of his violent past in a quaint Italian town but is disrupted once his newfound friends face threats from the Camorra, a local Mafia-like group. This propels Robert back into action, igniting a carnage-soaked battle for their freedom, as well as his own. While treading formulaic ground for action sequels, The Equalizer 3 also provides everything you could possibly ask for: a tension-laced opening, squeaky-clean pacing/editing, picturesque mise-en-scène, and heavily-stylized combat. —James Mercadante\n\nWhere to watch The Equalizer 3: Netflix\n\nDirector: Antoine Fuqua\n\nCast: Denzel Washington, Dakota Fanning, Eugenio Mastrandrea, David Denman, Gaia Scodellaro, Remo Girone\n\nRelated content: The Equalizer director might de-age Denzel Washington for the franchise's origin story\n\n06 of 25\n\nEverything Everywhere All at Once (2022)\n\nStrap on your googly eyes and wiggle those hot-dog fingers because Everything Everywhere All at Once finally made its way to Netflix. Blending multiple genres like sci-fi, romance, action, comedy, and family drama, Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert's seven-time Oscar-winning epic homes in on Evelyn Wong (Michelle Yeoh): a Chinese American immigrant worn down by her laundromat business, her hypercritical father (James Hong), the unrelenting IRS, and so forth. But when she's called on to thwart the all-powerful Jobu Tupaki from obliterating the multiverse, Evelyn discovers the ability to roam through multiple dimensions and collect some kick-ass combat skills. For a film that embodies the debate of existentialism vs. nihilism, there's no finer way to tackle the meaning of life than to consider every absurd scenario imaginable — from a Ratatouille-like raccoon to a bagel-shaped weapon of mass destruction to a fight scene hinged on...a butt-plug. Yet amidst the non-structural circus, the film grounds itself with a family love story, elevated by groundbreaking, award-winning performances from Yeoh, Ke Huy Quan, and Stephanie Hsu. —J.M.\n\nWhere to watch Everything Everywhere All at Once: Netflix\n\nEW grade: B– (read the review)\n\nDirectors: Daniel Kwan, Daniel Scheinert\n\nCast: Michelle Yeoh, Ke Huy Quan, Jamie Lee Curtis, Stephanie Hsu, James Hong, Jenny Slate, Harry Shum Jr.\n\nRelated content: Stephanie Hsu feels at peace with the multiverse\n\n07 of 25\n\nExtraction (2020)\n\nWhen you got nothing, you got nothing to lose, making you an ideal candidate for a job as a black-market mercenary. After Tyler Rake (Chris Hemsworth), a former member of the Australian Army Special Air Service Regiment, is recruited to rescue Ovi, the recently kidnapped son of the biggest drug lord in India, he finds that his very particular set of skills — and history of family trauma — are more than enough to extract the kid. But when the city is locked down, it's anybody's guess whether Rake can safely return Ovi to his family. Representing Sam Hargrave's directorial debut after years of serving as stunt coordinator on some of the biggest Marvel projects around (The Avengers, Deadpool, Thor: Ragnorak), the film is in capable (if violent) hands, but still manages to cultivate moments of tenderness and redemption amongst the casualties. —I.G.\n\nWhere to watch Extraction: Netflix\n\nEW grade: B (read the review)\n\nDirector: Sam Hargrave\n\nCast: Chris Hemsworth, Rudhraksh Jaiswal, Randeep Hooda, Priyanshu Painyuli, Golshifteh Farahani, Pankaj Tripathi, David Harbour\n\nRelated content: Chris Hemsworth says Extraction 2 stuntwork was 'so satisfying' compared to Marvel: 'You have a lot of help in post-production there'\n\n08 of 25\n\nThe Foreigner (2017)\n\nA father’s pursuit of vengeance is on full display in The Foreigner, an action film that an EW writer describes as Jackie Chan’s take on Taken. A two-hander that stars Chan opposite Pierce Brosnan in the role of a First Minister of Northern Ireland and former IRA leader, The Foreigner gives Chan a chance to stretch both his acting and fighting muscles as a grieving father whose most recent loss reawakens traumas from earlier in his life. Chan’s nuanced performance is equally matched by a committed showing from Brosnan, whose character is trying to walk the political tightrope while not burning bridges with his old ideological comrades. A lean action thriller marked by solid acting and excellent fight sequences, The Foreigner will remind you that Jackie Chan is so much more than just powerful kicks and one-liners. —I.G.\n\nWhere to watch The Foreigner: Netflix\n\nEW grade: B (read the review)\n\nDirector: Martin Campbell\n\nCast: Jackie Chan, Pierce Brosnan\n\nRelated content: Jackie Chan talks battling Bond and learning to build (fake) bombs for The Foreigner\n\n09 of 25\n\nGunpowder Milkshake (2021)\n\nAfter honing her ass-kicking prowess in both the Marvel Cinematic Universe and the Jumanji franchise, Karen Gillan struts confidently into the leading role for Navot Papushado's action flick. If you enjoy Atomic Blonde (2017) or Birds of Prey (2020), you will revel in Gunpowder Milkshake, where Gillian stars as Sam — a highly-trained killer targeted by her ex-employers, who must forge alliances with her assassin mother (Lena Headey) and her former hitwoman comrades to survive. With a stacked lineup of powerhouses like Michelle Yeoh, Angela Bassett, and Carla Gugino, the film offers 114 minutes of nonstop thrill, which Gillian described to EW as \"humorous at times and [doesn't] take itself too seriously, but [takes] the action seriously enough.\" —J.M.\n\nWhere to watch Gunpowder Milkshake: Netflix\n\nDirector: Navot Papushado\n\nCast: Karen Gillan, Lena Headey, Carla Gugino, Chloe Coleman, Michelle Yeoh, Angela Bassett, Paul Giamatti, Ralph Ineson\n\nRelated content: See Michelle Yeoh tell Lena Headey to 'F--- off!' on set of action-thriller Gunpowder Milkshake\n\n10 of 25\n\nThe Harder They Fall (2021)\n\nThough it suffers at times from Netflix's in-house mandate for too-clean disposable content, this stylish revisionist Western boasts an undeniably stacked and magnetic cast. Jonathan Majors stars as the raffish outlaw on a quest to hunt down those responsible for his requisite personal tragedy. Meanwhile, a characteristically hypnotic Idris Elba is the baddest man in the West, with a gang including the equally formidable likes of Regina King and LaKeith Stanfield. Luckily, Majors has everyone from the great Delroy Lindo to Stanfield's Atlanta costar Zazie Beetz on his side, as The Harder They Fall presents an Old West populated by many of the greatest Black actors working today. While co-writer/director Jeymes Samuel (aka The Bullitt)'s script centers on the oft-ignored real figures of the Black West, his film is, at its thoroughly entertaining heart, a rip-roaring display of action setpieces and acting excellence. Style over substance? Sure. But The Harder They Fall has style to burn. —Dennis Perkins\n\nWhere to watch The Harder They Fall: Netflix\n\nEW grade: B (read the review)\n\nDirector: Jeymes Samuel\n\nCast: Jonathan Majors, Idris Elba, Zazie Beetz, Regina King, Delroy Lindo, Lakeith Stanfield, RJ Cyler, Danielle Deadwyler, Edi Gathegi, Deon Cole\n\nRelated content: Nominated for Nothing: The good, the bad, and the ugly truth of The Harder They Fall\n\n11 of 25\n\nHunt for the Wilderpeople (2016)\n\nAs he proved conclusively in his foray into the MCU, Taika Waititi is unparalleled at mixing and matching tones. Here, a shaggy adventure tale about a delinquent foster boy and a taciturn New Zealand loner becomes all at once hilarious, wry, and wrenching as the mismatched and reluctant duo find themselves on the run in the wilderness after a series of misfortunes and misunderstandings. The great Sam Neill and Deadpool 2's Julian Dennison make a team for the ages, as the unlikely fugitives dodge cops, social workers, trigger-happy hunters, and the occasional wild boar, all while Waititi parcels out the development of their inevitable, grudging bond with the deftest comic touch. An adventure in the wild bristling with tensely witty set pieces and anchored by two exceptional performances, the film is unendingly charming without ever crossing into unrealistically rosy territories. — D.P.\n\nWhere to watch Hunt for the Wilderpeople: Netflix\n\nEW grade: B– (read the review)\n\nDirector: Taika Waititi\n\nCast: Sam Neill, Julian Dennison, Rhys Darby, Rima Te Wiata, Rachel House\n\nRelated content: Thor: Ragnarok director Taika Waititi discusses new film Hunt for the Wilderpeople\n\n12 of 25\n\nKate (2021)\n\nImagine if John Wick had a daughter, and you'd evoke someone akin to Kate (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), a raging-bull assassin and A1 sniper operating in Tokyo. When she's injected with acute radiation poisoning caused by Polonium-204, Kate races against the clock, armed with less than 24 hours to unmask her assailant and deliver some lethal payback. Bursting with candy-colored visuals, sensational stunts, brutal carnage, and Winstead's organic badassery (one that echoes her role as the Huntress in Birds of Prey), Kate delivers as a proper revenge thriller. Per EW's critic, the film \"is red-meat storytelling, all broad outlines and crunched bones. But there's a visual wit and visceral energy to it that other recent efforts struggle to find.\" —J.M.\n\nWhere to watch Kate: Netflix\n\nEW grade: B (read the review)\n\nDirector: Cedric Nicolas-Troyan\n\nCast: Mary Elizabeth Winstead, Miku Martineau, Woody Harrelson, Tadanobu Asano, Michiel Huisman, Miyavi, Jun Kunimura\n\nRelated content: See Mary Elizabeth Winstead take on a killer role in the trailer for Kate\n\n13 of 25\n\nLooper (2012)\n\nBefore Rian Johnson helmed his Knives Out franchise and Star Wars: Episode VIII — The Last Jedi (much to some people's dismay, but not ours), he made his first big splash with this 2012 head-scratcher. Joseph Gordon-Levitt does his best Bruce Willis impression as \"looper\" Joe, a time traveler who comes face-to-face with his future self (Willis for real this time). Old Joe has come to the past to kill the mother of a young boy, who the present Joe has his own reasons for defending, pitting two different versions of the same self against each other. If you're a fan of time travel movies, there are enough cross-linear \"grandfather paradoxes\" (shout-out to The Umbrella Academy season three) here to keep you up nights, but that doesn't take any of the fun out of Looper's one-of-a-kind timeline-skewing action. —Gwen Ihnat\n\nWhere to watch Looper: Netflix\n\nEW grade: B+ (read the review)\n\nDirector: Rian Johnson\n\nCast: Bruce Willis, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Emily Blunt, Paul Dano, Jeff Daniels\n\nRelated content: Nominated for nothing: Why the Academy should go back in time to honor Looper\n\n14 of 25\n\nLucy (2014)\n\nIt is estimated that humans are able to access 10 percent of our brains’ potential. In the sci-fi action film Lucy, kidnapping, drug trafficking, and savage circumstances collide to give Lucy (Scarlett Johansson), an American student living in Taiwan, access to 28 percent of her brain — and counting. Featuring the signature, stylized violence of French director Luc Besson, the film is presented at high speeds and alongside imagery designed to make you question your sobriety. There’s no debating that the film remains firmly in the shallow end of the character development pool, but Lucy makes up for it with stunt work, pacing, and aesthetic. A non-Marvel or DC superhero story for the technology era, Lucy starts as a cautionary tale and ends in the realm of the trippily cerebral, but steadily summons what one EW contributor describes as “genuine bizarro excitement.” —I.G.\n\nWhere to watch Lucy: Netflix\n\nEW grade: B (read the review)\n\nDirector: Luc Besson\n\nCast: Scarlett Johansson, Morgan Freeman, Choi Min-sik, Amr Waked\n\nRelated content: Scarlett Johansson teases her Bette Davis-esque character in Wes Anderson's Asteroid City\n\n15 of 25\n\nMr. & Mrs. Smith (2005)\n\nWhen Mr. & Mrs. Smith premiered in 2005, it was preceded by its reputation. Five months earlier, Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston announced their separation after seven years of marriage that was allegedly initiated after Pitt met and fell in love with his co-star, Angelina Jolie, during production on this flick. The celebrity buzz was more than enough to coax audiences into theaters, and once they got there, they were greeted by a film that was half action movie, half therapy session. The story follows an unhappy couple (Pitt and Jolie), both of whom are undercover as assassins working for competing companies — and both of whom have received an assignment to kill the other. Screenwriter Simon Kinberg was inspired by the five-step process employed in couples counseling, a template he used to help ground the Smiths' otherwise exceptional lives into something far more relatable. Thanks to the explosive chemistry between Pitt and Jolie (and the powerful weaponry utilized by their characters in their race to outmaneuver death), Mr. & Mrs. Smith is the very definition of an old-school summer blockbuster. —I.G.\n\nWhere to watch Mr. & Mrs. Smith: Netflix\n\nEW grade: N/A (read the review)\n\nDirector: Doug Liman\n\nCast: Brad Pitt, Angelina Jolie, Adam Brody, Kerry Washington\n\nRelated content: From the EW archives: Brad Pitt, Angelina Jolie, and the tabloid drama behind Mr. & Mrs. Smith\n\n16 of 25\n\nOkja (2018)\n\nTwo years before Bong Joon Ho wowed the world with Parasite, the South Korean director partnered with Netflix to make Okja. A pig-centered movie that leans decidedly more toward Animal Farm than Babe, the movie follows Mija, a South Korean teen who bonds with Okja, the \"super pig\" she's helped raise — only to have Okja taken from her after he is crowned the winner of an agrochemical company's competition for best pig. With Okja headed for the slaughterhouse, Mija travels from South Korea to New York City on a mission to save her friend and to help expose the inhumane practices of the Mirando Corporation and its leader, Lucy Mirando (Tilda Swinton). A mixture of science, fantasy, action, and adventure, Okja is one of those movies you have to see to believe. As EW's critic writes, Okja is \"the antithesis of cookie-cutter, made-by-committee filmmaking. Prepare to be amazed, grossed out, provoked, punchdrunk, and tickled.\" —I.G.\n\nWhere to watch Okja: Netflix\n\nEW grade: B (read the review)\n\nDirector: Bong Joon Ho\n\nCast: Tilda Swinton, Paul Dano, Ahn Seo-hyun, Byun Hee-bong, Steven Yeun, Lily Collins, Yoon Je-moon, Shirley Henderson, Daniel Henshall, Devon Bostick, Choi Woo-shik, Giancarlo Esposito, Jake Gyllenhaal\n\nRelated content: Okja cast on film's political parallels, 'wars' against nature and women\n\n17 of 25\n\nThe Old Guard (2020)\n\nImmortality comes with a price, as seen in The Old Guard. Andy (Charlize Theron) is part of a group of centuries-old warriors who have been gifted the power to heal from any wound. Unable to die, this team utilizes their talents by working as mercenaries for various mortal employers. Are they heroes or villains? It depends on what century they're living in. But when one particular mission exposes their extraordinary abilities, the group must band together to avoid capture by Big Pharma, who hopes to study, replicate, and monetize their gifts. Aided by the group's newest member, a U.S. Marine (Kiki Layne), Andy and her team fight for their freedom in this action-packed film based on an acclaimed series of graphic novels. Theron is in peak fighting form, even as her character begins to slow after centuries of regenerating. And while character backstory and world-building take a backseat to stunt sequences, you can rest easy in the knowledge that a sequel is already in the works. —I.G.\n\nWhere to watch The Old Guard: Netflix\n\nEW grade: B– (read the review)\n\nDirector: Gina Prince-Bythewood\n\nTalent: Charlize Theron, KiKi Layne, Marwan Kenzari, Luca Marinelli, Harry Melling, Veronica Ngo, Matthias Schoenaerts, Chiwetel Ejiofor\n\nRelated reading: Victoria Mahoney to direct The Old Guard sequel\n\n18 of 25\n\nOutlaw King (2018)\n\nSet in early 14th-century Scotland during the Scottish Wars of Independence (also known as Braveheart times), Scottish King Robert the Bruce (Chris Pine) finds himself leading a rebellion against the English King Edward I, an act which causes him to be labeled an outlaw. Based on an untold true story, Outlaw King follows Robert and those loyal to him as they embark on a guerilla mission to retake the lands stolen from them by the English, even as the English brutally murder their families. Filmed, as an EW critic writes, \"in the natural light of candles, torches, and overcast skies,\" Outlaw King is a movie that manages to find the beauty amongst the battle scenes. —I.G.\n\nWhere to watch Outlaw King: Netflix\n\nEW grade: B+ (read the review)\n\nDirector: David Mackenzie\n\nCast: Chris Pine, Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Florence Pugh\n\nRelated content: Chris Pine's most memorable roles (so far)\n\n19 of 25\n\nPineapple Express (2008)\n\nLong before Seth Rogen was making pot paraphernalia, he was making stoner films — and Pineapple Express is a stoner film for the ages. A crime comedy, the movie follows Dale (Rogen) and his drug dealer Saul (James Franco) who are forced to flee town after Dale accidentally witnesses a corrupt cop (Rosie Perez) and a drug lord (Gary Cole) execute a rival gang leader. In 2008, producer Judd Apatow told the Playlist that the role of Saul was inspired by Brad Pitt’s stoner character Floyd in the 1993 film True Romance, but the rest of the film comes straight from the brains of Rogen and his co-writer Evan Goldberg — likely with the help of a few Pineapple Express-infused brainstorming sessions. —I.G.\n\nWhere to watch Pineapple Express: Netflix\n\nEW grade: B (read the review)\n\nDirector: David Gordon Green\n\nCast: Seth Rogen, James Franco, Danny McBride, Gary Cole, Craig Robinson, Rosie Perez, Ken Jeong, Amber Heard, Ed Begley Jr., Bill Hader\n\nRelated content: Seth Rogen on what the Sony hack revealed about Pineapple Express 2\n\n20 of 25\n\nProject Power (2020)\n\nIf there was a pill that could give you five minutes of pure power, would you take it? Such is the premise behind Project Power, a science fiction action film produced by Netflix. In a good example of strange bedfellows, Project Power follows a trio consisting of a police officer (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), a soldier (Jamie Foxx), and a drug dealer (Dominique Fishback as seen in The Deuce), as they work together to halt distribution on a new kind of drug that has recently hit the streets of New Orleans. If you're looking for an action thriller that moves fast, Project Power, an EW critic writes, \"makes it easy to suspend your disbelief and your imaginary degree in biochemistry, and just let it ride.\" —I.G.\n\nWhere to watch Project Power: Netflix\n\nEW grade: B+ (read the review)\n\nDirector: Henry Joost, Ariel Schulman\n\nCast: Jamie Foxx, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Dominique Fishback, Rodrigo Santoro, Colson Baker, Allen Maldonado, Amy Landecker, Courtney B. Vance\n\nRelated content: With Netflix's Project Power, Dominique Fishback is poised to take center stage\n\n21 of 25\n\nResident Evil: Retribution (2012)\n\nThe fifth film in the Resident Evil franchise is here to play mind games with its protagonist: Alice (Milla Jovovich), who believes she is living with her husband (Oded Fehr) and daughter Becky (Aryana Engineer), but in reality, she's been captured by the Umbrella Corporation and brought to an underwater facility used to test the company’s T-virus. When the facility’s computer system suddenly shuts down, it’s up to Alice to escape — with the assistance of some resistance agents — and protect the world from the Red Queen. Helmed by writer-director Paul W.S. Anderson, whose work EW's critic describes as “lunatically haphazard and dementedly enthusiastic,” Resident Evil: Retribution may not fully live up to the first 2002 film (also available on Netflix), but it's still not to be missed. —I.G.\n\nWhere to watch Resident Evil: Retribution: Netflix\n\nEW grade: B (read the review)\n\nDirector: Paul W.S.

Part buddy-comedy, part action-thriller, part historical drama, part musical, S. Rajamouli's Telugu-language blockbuster set in the 1920s — which won the Oscar for Original Song (\"Naatu Naatu\"), making history as the first song from an Indian feature film to win in that category — is a semi-historical story centered around the unlikely camaraderie between two Indian revolutionaries, Komaram Bheem (N.T. Rama Rao Jr.) and Alluri Sitarama Raju (Ram Charan), who band together against British imperialism. An explosion of electrifying spectacles, RRR successfully melds over-the-top action sequences — from battling tigers to swinging motorcycles — campy dance numbers, and emotional story lines into one cohesive theatrical experience. —J.M.\n\nWhere to watch RRR: Netflix\n\nDirector: S. Rajamouli\n\nCast: N.T. Rama Rao Jr., Ram Charan, Ajay Devgn, Alia Bhatt, Shriya Saran, Samuthirakani, Ray Stevenson, Alison Doody, Olivia Morris\n\nRelated content: RRR director S.S.

For Bo \"Bandit\" Darville (Burt Reynolds) and Cledus \"Snowman\" Snow (Jerry Reed), the answer is obviously to accept. The plan is simple: Bandit will drive ahead in a Pontiac Trans Am intended to distract law enforcement, while Snowman drives the truck full of beer — but the duo's foolproof scheme is complicated when runaway bride Carrie (Sally Field) jumps into Bandit's car in an attempt to escape her would-be husband Junior, whose father just happens to be Sheriff Buford T. Justice (Jackie Gleason), a.k.a. Smokey Bear. As Buford and Junior pursue Carrie, Bandit and Snowman attempt to make it to Atlanta in time to collect their payout. An action comedy film rife with vehicular crashes and motorcycle pratfalls, Smokey and the Bandit is far from subtle, but that doesn't mean it's not funny. —I.G.\n\nWhere to watch Smokey and the Bandit: Netflix\n\nDirector: Hal Needham\n\nCast: Burt Reynolds, Sally Field, Jerry Reed, Jackie Gleason, Paul Williams\n\nRelated content: Burt Reynolds' 1977 Smokey and the Bandit car sells for nearly $500K\n\n24 of 25\n\nTriple Frontier (2018)\n\nWhy rob a bank when you can put your life on the line stealing money from the cartel? In Triple Frontier, the J.C. Chandor-directed and Netflix produced action/adventure movie, a group of former special-ops soldiers come to the realization that they have not been properly compensated for their years spent in military service, and decide to get what's theirs by robbing a drug lord. Chandor brings out the big guns to play his team of military men, enlisting an ensemble composed of Ben Affleck, Oscar Isaac, Charlie Hunnam, Garrett Hedlund, and Pedro Pascal. A good, old-fashioned male bonding film with a lot of money on the line, EW's Chris Nashawaty writes, \"There may be no honor among thieves, but Triple Frontier certainly makes watching them pretty entertaining.\" —I.G.\n\nWhere to watch Triple Frontier: Netflix\n\nEW grade: B (read the review)\n\nDirector: J.C. Chandor\n\nCast: Ben Affleck, Oscar Isaac, Charlie Hunnam, Garrett Hedlund, Pedro Pascal\n\nRelated content: Ben Affleck, Oscar Isaac are cash-stealing comrades in Netflix's Triple Frontier\n\n25 of 25\n\nThe Woman King (2022)\n\nThere's no shortage of stories or characters that Viola Davis can't tackle. In this AAFCA-winning war epic set in 1800s West Africa, she wears the armor of General Nanisca, leader of the Agojie: an all-female fighting crew who've sworn their lives to sisterhood and protecting the Dahomey kingdom. With the imminent threat of another African empire destroying their civilization, it is up to Nanisca to train a new generation of warriors. Beyond Davis' ball-of-fire performance — where her silent expressions wield a storytelling power of their own — The Woman King dazzles with a subversive script and mindfully choreographed combat scenes featuring an array of weaponry and martial arts. As EW's critic noted, \"The movie is swords and sandals, a classic hero's quest; one that just had to wait several lifetimes for the rest of the world to catch up. —J.M.\n\nWhere to watch The Woman King: Netflix\n\nEW grade: B (read the review)\n\nDirector: Gina Prince-Bythewood\n\nCast: Viola Davis, Thuso Mbedu, Lashana Lynch, Sheila Atim, Hero Fiennes Tiffin, John Boyega\n\nRelated content: Nominated for Nothing: The Academy is on the wrong side of history with The Woman King snub"
