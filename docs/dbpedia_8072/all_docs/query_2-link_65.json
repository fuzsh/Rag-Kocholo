        "text": "Melinda French Gates might be hearing wedding bells again.\n\nThe billionaire philanthropist is sparking engagement rumors after she was photographed wearing a massive diamond ring on that finger. French Gates, who was previously married to Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, was all smiles as she disembarked a helicopter in New York City with an assistant.\n\nDressed casually in sneakers, black capris and a white blouse, French Gates made her way to a waiting car with her large Chanel tote.\n\nFrench Gates, 59, has been romantically linked to former Fox reporter Jon Du Pre since November 2022.\n\nReps for the pair didn’t immediately return Page Six’s requests for comment.\n\nFrench Gates and the “Road Ahead” author finalized their divorce in August 2021 after 27 years of marriage. They had announced their split just three months prior.\n\n“After a great deal of thought and a lot of work on our relationship, we have made the decision to end our marriage,” they said in a joint statement at the time.\n\nFor more Page Six you love…\n\nListen to our weekly “We Hear” podcast\n\nShop our exclusive merch\n\nThe former couple founded the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation during their marriage and transformed it into one of the largest charitable organizations in the world.\n\nFrench Gates later admitted that Gates’ association with late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein played a role in her decision to leave the marriage.\n\n“I did not like that he had meetings with Jeffrey Epstein, no. I made that clear to him,” the former computer scientist told Gayle King on “CBS Mornings.”\n\n“He was abhorrent. He was evil personified. My heart breaks for these women.”"
