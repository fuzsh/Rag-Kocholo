        "text": "Bill Gates admitted in a new interview with The Times that he's had a “pretty dramatic” couple of years.\n\nNot only did the Microsoft founder's 27-year-long marriage to Melinda Gates recently come to an end, but he's also had to deal with the death of his father and the onset of a global pandemic. But Bill confessed that “the weirdest part has been the kids leaving,” as his youngest just went off to college. He added, “My wife's graduated as well so I'm going to have lots of interesting dinners at the house. I figure a few times a week I will have various experts come. I have this nice house that lends itself to great discussions. But it feels too big most of the time. I am only a small-sized person.”\n\nThe multi-billionaire went on to explain that while he's not really a “visibly emotional” guy, “Maybe somewhere deep inside I am.” He added that while his divorce has by no means been an easy process, “I feel lucky that I get to work with [Melinda]. And we have the annual employee meeting at the Foundation and the Giving Pledge and the annual meeting in June that she and I host together.” And while Melinda previously declined to label their post-split relationship a “friendship,” Bill said, “I would say that. In an interview she chose not to use that word, but I'll use it. We have a, you know, super important, complex, close relationship where we've chosen to work together. And I'm very happy that we get to work together. You know, we built the Foundation together.”\n\nThat strong connection and working relationship has also helped them hasten the process of divvying up their enormous fortune and shared assets, “We spent some time coming up with a fair settlement that we both signed. But neither of us was facing any real reduction in our consumption. It was more about, OK, I'll have X billion to give away, you'll have Y billion to give away. It was about the causes,” Bill explained. “Yes. I mean, we're very lucky people. I feel sorry for when people have super limited resources under any circumstance. And that's not our situation. We can be reasonably generous to the kids, but the vast majority of the money will go to philanthropy.”\n\nIn a previous interview, Melinda also said she is still grieving their relationship and Bill said he feels that way as well. “I'm also grieving the same way she is. Yes,” he confirmed. “You know, we grew up together. When I got married, yeah, Microsoft was a big deal. But I was a young 38-year-old and she was a mature 28-year old, and over those next few years, in terms of what we learnt together, what went well, what didn't go well...I mean, that's more than half my adult life. And so, yes, you're very used to going home and saying, ‘Oh, I did this well,’ or, ‘Oh, I did this poorly,’ or, ‘Oh, I called this person the wrong name.’ We did a lot together.” When asked if he misses that dynamic, he added, “Yes, sure. I'm lucky that a part of it continues. Which I think is super.”\n\nBut while running one of the biggest corporations and philanthropic organizations in the world takes up a majority of his free time, Bill says that he “wouldn't choose to use that excuse” for the reason behind the dissolution of his marriage. “I think marriages are so complex that to delve into that isn't worthwhile,” he explained. “Every marriage as the kids leave the house will go through a transition. Mine sadly went through this transition called divorce. But from my point of view it was a great marriage. I wouldn't have changed it. You know, I wouldn't choose to marry someone else.” And when asked if he would marry again, he said, “Yes. I'm talking about would I marry Melinda all over again. In terms of my future, I don't have any plans, but I highly recommend marriage.”\n\nMore Great Stories From Vanity Fair"
