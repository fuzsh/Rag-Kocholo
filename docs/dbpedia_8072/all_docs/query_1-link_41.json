        "text": "What is Melinda French Gates’ family background?\n\nMelinda Ann French was born on August 15, 1964, in Dallas, Texas. Her father, an aerospace engineer who worked for Nasa, encouraged her keen interest in science and technology from a young age, even telling her she should learn to code, she recalled once in a post on X (formerly Twitter).\n\nHow did Melinda French Gates meet Bill Gates?\n\nMelinda first met Bill at a work dinner in New York in 1987, less than a month into her Microsoft job, according to her interview with David Rubenstein. However, she admitted that being in a relationship with the company’s founder worried her at first.\n\n“The first date with Bill I thought I would go out with him once, maybe twice. Then when I realised we were gonna start dating more I thought, this is tricky,” she said, adding, “I’m not sure I wanna do this, because I’d worked really hard to get my MBA, I’d studied economics. and I thought ‘I’m not sure this is gonna go well for me’.”\n\nDespite her reservations, the pair got married in Hawaii in 1994, went on to have three children together, and, in 2000, created the organisation that continues to be their legacy – the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, per People.\n\nWhy did Bill Gates and Melinda French Gates divorce?\n\n“It wasn’t one moment or one specific thing that happened. There just came a point in time where there was enough there that I realised it just wasn’t healthy, and I couldn’t trust what we had,” she told the host. When asked if Bill had had multiple affairs during their marriage, Melinda simply replied “those are questions Bill needs to answer”.\n\nHow many children does Melinda French Gates have?\n\nMelinda has also said that, although co-parenting with Bill has been difficult since their divorce, her “main concern was trying to protect my kids through it” in an interview with Fortune.\n\nIs Melinda French Gates dating anyone?\n\nHow much is Melinda French Gates worth?\n\nNow thought to be worth around US$11 billion, Melinda’s wealth is primarily derived from her former marriage to Bill. As part of their divorce settlement, she received a significant portion of their shared assets: “We spent some time coming up with a fair settlement that we both signed,” Bill told The Sunday Times in 2022, adding that it was mostly about how much they wanted to each be able to give away, rather than keep.\n\nWhat is Melinda French Gates doing now?\n\nThese days better known as a philanthropist, French Gates has primarily focused on issues related to gender equality, education and global health over the years, with Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation being famously instrumental in tackling diseases such as malaria and HIV/Aids. The couple have reportedly invested US$59.5 billion of their own money into the foundation since its inception, per its website.\n\nNevertheless, this May she announced she would be stepping down as co-chair of the foundation, and will instead channel her energy into helping women and girls – a cause especially close to her heart."
