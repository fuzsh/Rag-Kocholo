In a separate statement, Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation CEO Mark Suzman said the organization would be changing its name to the Gates Foundation.\n\nIn departing the foundation, French Gates said her plan is to focus on \"women and girls in the U.S. and around the world.\" She noted that as part of her departure agreement from the foundation she'll receive $12.5 billion to commit to those goals.\n\n\"[T]hose fighting to protect and advance equality are in urgent need of support,\" French Gates wrote in her statement.\n\nMelinda French Gates and Bill Gates were married for 27 years before announcing their divorce in May 2021, a decision that she described to \"CBS Mornings\" anchor Gayle King in 2022 as \"painful.\" She added at the time that the pair intended to continue working together on their foundation.\n\nGates Foundation CEO Suzman described her departure as \"very sad news.\"\n\n\"I want to reassure you that the millions of people our work serves and the thousands of partners we work alongside can continue to count on the foundation,\" he added."
