        "text": "This Friday, Melinda French Gates will officially end her tenure as co-chair of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (which will subsequently be changing its name to the Gates Foundation). According to a statement the philanthropist released on X last month, her next venture will be a $12.5 billion commitment to work on behalf of women and families. In the world of philanthropy, this is a big move; for the future course of women’s rights, it’s potentially seismic.\n\nIn an email to Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation employees (later posted on LinkedIn), CEO Mark Suzman shared that “after a difficult few years watching women’s rights rolled back in the U.S. and around the world, she wants to use this next chapter to focus specifically on altering that trajectory.” French Gates is widely regarded as the most powerful woman in philanthropy, and rightfully so. She co-founded and built one of the largest charitable organizations in the world, wielding an endowment in the tens of billions and serving as co-chair for the past 24 years. According to the foundation, its endowment exceeded $75 billion at the end of last year.\n\nEconomic power is social power is political power. In that regard, French Gates holds immense power, and with a laser focus on shaping the future of women’s rights, the implications are profound. In her statement, French Gates made clear where she’s set her sights, stating, “This is a critical moment for women and girls in the U.S. and around the world—and those fighting to protect and advance equality are in urgent need of support.” Indeed, women’s rights are at a precarious juncture that will likely reverberate for decades to come. Around the world, women’s rights have been set back, like in Afghanistan, where decades of progress was undone in a matter of days when the Taliban returned to power and abruptly banned women and girls from getting an education, working outside of the home and public life altogether.\n\nIn the U.S., the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade has significantly restricted or completely banned abortion access across the country, and one in five patients travels out of state for abortion care. In a country with the highest maternal mortality rate in the industrialized world and in which four in five pregnancy-related deaths are preventable, threats of even more extreme restrictions, including a nationwide ban and restrictions on birth control, need to be taken seriously. Meanwhile, women make only 84 cents for every dollar men make according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, and the U.S. remains the only wealthy nation without federally guaranteed paid family leave, despite there being a 66.5% U.S. labor participation rate for mothers with children 6 years old or younger.\n\nIn a guest essay published by the New York Times, French Gates highlighted how underfunded charitable organizations focused on women and girls are despite the growing need and the cost of that reality, stating, “As shocking as it is to contemplate, my 1-year-old granddaughter may grow up with fewer rights than I had.” It’s a sobering thought many women—this writer included—have had to contend with in the lead up to and wake of the overturning of Roe v. Wade. It’s this context that will inform French Gates' next chapter. Despite the setbacks girls and women are facing in the U.S. and around the globe, women are also breaking barriers in everything from professional sports to the C-Suite, gaining and wielding greater economic and political power, and increasingly leveraging that power to shape the future.\n\nThis week, French Gates announced that as her first act in this new chapter, she is committing an additional $1 billion to advance women’s power globally. This isn’t a new area for French Gates—the philanthropist previously committed $1 billion to promote gender equality and through her nonprofit organization Pivotal Ventures, she’s done advocacy work for female founders, abortion rights and paid family leave. And French Gates doesn’t shy away from speaking about the topic publicly. In an article with the Economist, the philanthropist outlined a multitude of reasons why leaders need to take increased action toward boosting economic power for women and highlighted actionable strategies including increasing women’s access to affordable capital and building inclusive digital infrastructure.\n\nThe recent funding announcement highlighted key areas that hold women back, including women’s health. The $1 billion commitment includes grants to be made by Pivotal Philanthropies Foundation, with $200 million going to U.S. organizations protecting women’s rights—including the Center for Reproductive Rights, MomsRising Education Fund and the National Women's Law Center—with a noted emphasis on women’s reproductive freedom. Another $240 million is going to 12 global leaders—which include former New Zealand prime minister Jacinda Ardern, award-winning filmmaker Ava DuVernay, seven-time Olympic gold medalist Allyson Felix, Liberian peace activist Leymah Gbowee and Afghan educator Shabana Basij-Rasikh—who will each direct their own $20 million fund “to charitable organizations they consider to be doing urgent, impactful, and innovative work to improve women’s health and well-being in the U.S. and around the world.” Additionally, French Gates announced that $250 million will be awarded through an open call to grassroots organizations, which are often underserved by big donors, launching in the fall."
