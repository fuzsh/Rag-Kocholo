        "text": "Bill Gates and Melinda French Gates are officially grandparents!\n\nTheir eldest child, Jennifer, 28, and her husband, Nayel Nassar announced in June 2024 that they are expecting their second baby after welcoming their first child in February 2023.\n\nIn a video interview, Bill shared that he plans to \"create an adventure\" for his grandchildren.\n\n\"The relationship of a grandparent to a child is a nice one because it's kind of in addition to what they have with their parents,\" he said. \"It's kind of a supporting role, and in that way, it's kind of simple. It can be a lot of fun stuff.\"\n\nBill and Melinda, who divorced in 2021 after 27 years of marriage, are also parents to son Rory, 23, and daughter Phoebe, 21. A source told PEOPLE that the former couple held off on separating until their children had all graduated high school. And though Bill and Melinda are no longer together, they have reunited at important events to support their kids, like Jennifer's wedding in 2021.\n\nWhile Bill is one of the richest people on the planet, ranked fourth in the world by Forbes in 2022, he's spoken candidly about how he won't be passing on all of his wealth to his children. He has said that leaving his fortune to them would be a \"mistake,\" and that he plans to give most of it to charity — including the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.\n\nKeep reading for everything to know about the Gates children.\n\nJennifer Gates, 28\n\nJennifer Katharine Gates, Bill and Melinda's oldest child, was born on April 26, 1996.\n\nShe has a master's degree in public health from Columbia University and a degree in human biology from Stanford University. In May 2024, she graduated from Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai before starting her pediatric residency at Mt. Sinai.\n\n\"What you have achieved today — and every day leading up to it — is a tremendous accomplishment, @jenngatesnassar,\" Bill wrote on Instagram following his daughter's graduation. \"I’m so proud of you for finishing medical school, and I can’t wait to watch you take this next step into residency. Your patients will be lucky to call you doctor.\"\n\nIn addition to being a doctor-in-training, Jennifer is a professional show jumper who has been competing for years.\n\nShe married fellow equestrian Nayel Nassar in a custom Vera Wang dress on Oct. 16, 2021. Nassar proposed during a ski trip in January 2020 and Jennifer shared the news on Instagram, calling her then-fiancé \"one of a kind.\"\n\nHer parents reunited at the wedding, which took place only a few months after their divorce. Both were pictured walking alongside their daughter and made separate social media posts to celebrate the milestone.\n\nIn March 2023, Jennifer and Nassar welcomed their first child — a daughter named Leila. They announced that they are expecting their second baby in June 2024, when Jennifer shared a photo of her baby bump on Instagram as she posed with her little girl.\n\n\"Leila, being promoted to big sister 💕,\" she wrote in her caption.\n\nRory Gates, 25\n\nBill and Melinda's son, Rory John Gates, was born on May 23, 1999.\n\nHe graduated from the University of Chicago in June 2022, achieving \"a double major and a master's\" in just four years. His family was there to support him on graduation day with his sister Jennifer posting a photo of the three Gates siblings on Instagram.\n\nThe month prior, Jennifer posted a photo of Rory and her dog Earl to mark both of their birthdays, calling the pair the \"best pup and brother in the world.\"\n\nIn honor of her son's 18th birthday in 2017, Melinda wrote an essay for TIME in which she described Rory as \"compassionate and curious,\" as well as \"intelligent and well-read.\"\n\nShe also stated that one of the traits she is most proud of is that he is a feminist. \"Across 18 years of conversations, sharp observations and everyday actions, he's demonstrated his belief that gender equality is something worth standing up for,\" she wrote. \"When we talk about these issues at the dinner table, he (and his friends!) have a lot to say.\"\n\nPhoebe Gates, 21\n\nBill and Melinda welcomed their youngest child, Phoebe Adele Gates, on Sept. 14, 2002.\n\nPhoebe graduated from high school in 2021, and on her graduation day, Jennifer dedicated a post to her sister on Instagram, writing alongside a series of photos from over the years, \"Pheebs- I can't believe this day is here (time flies! 😅) but you are wise beyond your years, and so ready for this next incredible chapter in your journey. I love you, I am immensely proud of you and can't wait for all that's to come at Stanford ( !!! 🌲 🙌) and beyond.\"\n\nSince her parents announced their divorce, Phoebe has been seen out with her father, including at the TIME100 Gala, where the father-daughter duo posed for photos together on the red carpet.\n\nThe youngest Gates child has also enjoyed some mother-daughter bonding with Melinda since the split, including a date night in London in August 2022.\n\nPhoebe is very outspoken when it comes to social and political issues. After the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, she wrote an article for Vogue about the global implications of the decision and shared information about Planned Parenthood on her Instagram.\n\nPhoebe is also very passionate about fashion. In September 2022, she completed an internship at British Vogue and expressed her gratitude for the experience on Instagram. \"Thank you @britishvogue for giving me the internship of a lifetime. It was an honor to work with some of the best in the business and learn from you all,\" she wrote alongside a series of photos from her time at the publication.\n\nAnd it appears she may get some of her fashion inspiration from her mom. The following month, Phoebe channeled Melinda in a pink blazer and posted a photo of her mother wearing a very similar look. \"Should I dress up as @melindafrenchgates for Halloween? y/n?\" she captioned the Instagram post.\n\nAs for what she has in common with her father, Phoebe is an avid reader. In a 2018 Instagram post, Bill wrote that the two of them love \"reading all kinds of books,\" noting that John Green was one of their favorite authors at the time. He quoted Phoebe as saying, \"For years I have been a loyal John Green fan — devouring his novels in the back of coffee shops, while traveling, and curled up on my couch. Something about the imagery of his books makes me get caught up in the fantasy of his stories, but Turtles All the Way Down hit closer to home for me than the rest.\"\n\nIn addition to a love of reading, Phoebe also enjoys posting on TikTok. She spoke about her use of social media and the \"misconceptions and conspiracy theories\" that are posted about her family online in a March 2023 interview with The Information.\n\n\"People have a lot of preconceptions about me, so TikTok has been a chance for me to tell my own story and also use the attention my family name might bring to spotlight issues that are important to me, like women's health and sustainable fashion,\" she explained.\n\nIn September 2023, Phoebe turned 21 — and her mom had some advice to pass along.\n\n\"You know yourself already. Don't ever forget who you are,\" Melinda said during a FaceTime chat with her daughter, adding that Phoebe should always keep her \"most trusted advisors\" close.\n\nBill also celebrated his daughter on Instagram.\n\n\"You’ll always be my little girl, but watching you do big things has never surprised me. I’m so proud of you,\" he captioned two throwback photos with his youngest.\n\nPhoebe celebrated another milestone when she graduated Stanford University in June 2024, and it took her just three years to complete her degree. Her mom, Melinda served as the commencement speaker at the ceremony."
