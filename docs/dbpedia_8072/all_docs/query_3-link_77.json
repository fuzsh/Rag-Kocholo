        "text": "Melinda French Gates says she will be donating $1 billion over the next two years to individuals and organizations working on behalf of women and families globally, including on reproductive rights in the United States.\n\nIt's the second billion-dollar commitment French Gates has personally made in the past five years. In 2019, she pledged over 10 years to expand women's power and influence.\n\nEarlier this month, French Gates announced she would step down from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and vowed to focus on women and families. As a part of leaving the Gates Foundation, French Gates received $12 billion from Bill Gates for her philanthropy going forward.\n\nFrench Gates, one of the biggest philanthropic supporters of gender equity in the U.S., said Tuesday in a guest essay for The New York Times that she's been frustrated over the years by people who say it's not the right time to talk about gender equality.\n\n\"Decades of research on economics, well-being and governance make it clear that investing in women and girls benefits everyone,\" she wrote.\n\nFrench Gates said over the last few weeks she's started directing what will total $200 million in new grants through her organization, Pivotal Ventures, to groups working in the U.S. to protect women's rights and advance their power and influence. The grants are for general operating support, meaning they are not earmarked for specific projects. The groups include the National Women's Law Center, the National Domestic Workers Alliance and the Center for Reproductive Rights.\n\nTeresa Younger, the president and CEO of the Ms. Foundation for Women, who also received a grant, has long called on donors to give unrestricted, multi-year funding to organizations. She praised French Gates' new commitment as a part of a larger trend of major women donors giving generously to nonprofits.\n\n\"If philanthropy took lessons from the way that women are moving money, we would see more money in the field having greater impact,\" Younger said.\n\nHer organization learned of the grant, which is the first they've received from Pivotal Ventures within the last week, and Younger said there was no application process. She declined to disclose the amount of the grant but said it would help expand their work with organizations in the South and Midwest.\n\nThe nonprofit MomsRising Education Fund also received a grant that will extend to the end of 2026, with Kristin Rowe-Finkbeiner, its executive director and CEO, saying, \"We're deeply honored and enormously grateful that Melinda French Gates is stepping up for women and families in a time when the rights of our daughters may be significantly less than of ourselves or our own mothers.\"\n\nFrench Gates also pledged to give 12 individuals $20 million each to distribute to nonprofit organizations of their choice before the end of 2026. Those funds will be managed by the National Philanthropic Trust, one of the largest public charities that offers donor-advised funds, a spokesperson for Pivotal Ventures said.\n\nIn total, French Gates announced $690 million in commitments out of the promised $1 billion, which also include an \"open call\" for applications that the organization Lever for Change will administer this fall. French Gates said $250 million will be awarded to fund organizations working to improve women's mental and physical health globally.\n\nPivotal Ventures said it has committed $875 million of the $1 billion that French Gates pledged in 2019 to a mixture of venture and philanthropic funding. Additionally, the Gates Foundation has funded research and interventions to improve maternal mortality and women's health more broadly for years. In 2020, it hired its first president for its gender quality division and in 2021, the foundation pledged $2.1 billion to gender equity efforts convened by UN Women."
