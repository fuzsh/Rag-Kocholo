        "text": "Duke alumna Melinda French Gates announced her decision to resign from her role as co-chair of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation in a Monday morning Instagram post.\n\nFrench Gates, Trinity ‘86 and Fuqua ‘87, co-founded the foundation with her then-husband Bill Gates in 2000 to work towards improvements in healthcare, education and wealth inequalities worldwide. In that time, the organization has made $77.6 billion in grant payments, making it one of the world’s leading philanthropic initiatives.\n\nThe foundation has historically been one of Duke’s largest benefactors.\n\nIn 1998, the foundation donated a $20 million gift to support the University Scholars Program, which fosters interdisciplinary studies and collaboration between undergraduates and graduate schools. In 2002, it provided $35 million for the French Family Science Center.\n\nThe foundation made two gifts to Duke in 2007, first donating $10 million to support scholarships for undergraduates and students at the Fuqua School of Business and later contributing $15 million to endow DukeEngage, the University’s global service outreach program. In 2015, it donated $20 million to the Duke Global Health Institute.\n\nFrench Gates is one of the University’s most prominent alumni, receiving her bachelor’s degree in computer science and economics in 1986 and Master of Business Administration in 1987. She later served on Duke’s Board of Trustees between 1996 and 2003 and was the 2013 commencement speaker.\n\nThe fate of the foundation was brought into question after Gates and French Gates announced their divorce May 2021. They decided to undergo a trial period through 2023 to determine if they could work together as co-chairs."
