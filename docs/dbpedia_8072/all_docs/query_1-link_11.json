There just came a point in time where there was enough there that I realized it just wasn't healthy, and I couldn't trust what we had,\" Melinda revealed to CBS Mornings in March 2022.\n\nThroughout their 27-year union, the philanthropic couple welcomed three children together: daughters Jennifer and Phoebe and a son, Rory.\n\nIn 2000, they founded the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, a nonprofit dedicated to combating global poverty and disease. Following their surprise split, Melinda resigned from the foundation in May 2024.\n\nFrom a lackluster first date request to tying the knot in Hawaii, raising a family and ultimately splitting, here's everything to know about Bill Gates and Melinda French Gates' relationship.\n\n1987: Bill and Melinda first meet\n\nThe Microsoft co-founder met his future wife, né Melinda French, soon after she started as a product manager at the company. After first connecting at a sales meeting in New York City, the then-CEO went up to Melinda in a parking lot and asked her on a date. She initially turned him down, citing his lack of spontaneity.\n\n\"He said, 'You know, I was thinking maybe we could go out two weeks from [tonight],' \" the mom of three told AOL's MAKERS in 2015. Unimpressed, she replied, \"Two weeks from tonight? I have no idea what I'm doing two weeks from tonight,\" she told him. \"You aren't spontaneous enough for me.\"\n\nBut Bill persisted, calling her an hour later. \"He said, 'Is this spontaneous enough for you?' \" recalled Melinda. \"And I said, 'Okay, I guess that's pretty spontaneous. I guess we can try.' \"\n\n1993: Bill and Melinda get engaged\n\nBill proposed to Melinda in 1993, six years into their relationship. While neither has opened up much about their engagement, Melinda noted in a 2017 essay for AARP that the two celebrated their engagement with a trip to Africa in the fall of 1993.\n\nThe newly-engaged pair's first visit to Africa became a deeply formative experience for the couple.\n\nCalling the trip her \"first real encounter with extreme poverty,\" Melinda remarked that she and Bill \"took a walk on a beach in Zanzibar and had the conversation that would end up changing our lives.\" There, they agreed on where and how they would redistribute the wealth earned from Microsoft. A few years later, they formed the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation in 2000.\n\nJanuary 1, 1994: Bill and Melinda get married in Hawaii\n\nAfter seven years of dating, the couple jetted off for their top-secret destination wedding on the Hawaii island of Lanai on New Year's Day in 1994.

You can't be the CEO and go as hard as you're going and — somebody has to be at home, right? We didn't want our children raised by somebody else. I said, 'You know, if we want them to have the values we have, somebody has to be home.' \"\n\nDecember 2, 1998: Bill and Melinda establish a children's vaccine program\n\nThe couple held a press conference in New York City at the end of 1998 to announce a $100 million investment in children's vaccine access and distribution in developing countries.
