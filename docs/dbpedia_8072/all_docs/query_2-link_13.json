        "text": "Melinda French Gates said Monday she will resign from the charitable foundation she co-founded with her former husband, Microsoft founder Bill Gates. Her last day with the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation will be June 7, she announced on X.\n\nâThis is not a decision I came to lightly. I am immensely proud of the foundation that Bill and I built together and of the extraordinary work it is doing to address inequities around the world,\" Gates wrote on X, adding, âThe time is right for me to move forward into the next chapter of my philanthropy.â\n\nFounded in 2000, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation is believed to be the second largest charitable foundation in the world with $69 billion in assets. According to its most recent annual report, it provided $7 billion in charitable support to global development, global health, gender equality and other charitable programs in 2022.\n\nAccording to the foundation web site, the Gates âbelieve that all lives have equal value and they have always been determined to use their resources to create a world where everyone has the opportunity to lead a healthy and productive life.â\n\nBill and Melinda Gates were married for 27 years. They split up in 2022, after which Melinda Gates told the CBS Mornings TV show âthere just came a point in time where there was enough there that I realized it just wasnât healthy, and I couldât trust what we had.â\n\nGates is leaving the foundation with $12.5 billion under the terms of her agreement with her former husband.\n\nâThis is a critical moment for women and girls in the U.S. and around the world â and those fighting to protect and advance equality are in urgent need of support,â Gates wrote on X.\n\nShe said she will share more about how she plans to advance her work with women and failies âin the near future.â"
