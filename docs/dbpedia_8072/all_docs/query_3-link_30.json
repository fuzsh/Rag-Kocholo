The foundation said in July 2021 that Gates French would step down from her role as cochair if, after two years, either she or Gates decided they could no longer continue working together.\n\nAs recently as last July, spokespeople for French Gates told The Wall Street Journal she'd decided to stay with the foundation as its cochair. But 10 months later, she announced she was resigning.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe wrote in the Times op-ed that as part of her new philanthropic endeavors, she was committing $1 billion through 2026 to \"people and organizations working on behalf of women and families around the world, including on reproductive rights in the United States.\""
