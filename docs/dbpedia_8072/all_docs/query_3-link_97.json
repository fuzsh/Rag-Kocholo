        "text": "Billionaire philanthropist Melinda French Gates announced Tuesday that she is committing $1 billion (£782.4m) over the next two years to women’s causes and gender equity around the world.\n\nAbout $200 million (£157m) will go to organisations fighting for gender and reproductive rights in the US.\n\nIn a New York Times guest essay, Ms French Gates said she felt compelled to support US reproductive rights following the 2022 Supreme Court decision that overturned the constitutional right to an abortion.\n\nThe annonucement comes two weeks after Ms French Gates said she would step back from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the philanthropic powerhouse she co-founded with her former husband, Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates.\n\nThe money will be distributed through her company, Pivotal Ventures, through 2026.\n\nMs French Gates plans to give $20m (£16m) to a “diverse group of 12 global leaders” to distribute to organisations of their choice before the end of 2026.\n\nThe company said it will set aside another $250 million (£196m) in the autumn to global organisations focused on women’s mental and physical health.\n\nMs French Gates said she chose the first grant recipients working in the US to “protect the rights of women and advance their power and influence”.\n\n“When we allow this cause to go so chronically underfunded, we all pay the cost,” she wrote in the New York Times. “As shocking as it is to contemplate, my 1-year-old granddaughter may grow up with fewer rights than I had.”\n\nOne grant recipient is the Center for Reproductive Rights, which advocates for abortion rights and currently represents 50 women in lawsuits challenging abortion restrictions and other reproductive health measures in several states.\n\nJoung-ah Ghedini-Williams, the Center's chief communications and marketing officer, said the money is needed now more than ever.\n\n“The attention and the public debate about reproductive rights and abortion is greater than ever,” Ms Ghedini-Williams said. “That’s not necessarily being reflected in donations, which is why this is so wonderful right now, when we need to continue fueling this fight.”\n\nOther recipients include MomsRising, an organisation to support women’s economic security; the National Women’s Law Center, which focuses on law as a means to improve gender equity; and The 19th, a nonprofit media outlet dedicated to gender and policy news."
