        "text": "While French Gates didn't specify where she currently resides, she bought a cottage in the North Broadway neighborhood of Seattle weeks before the former couple filed for divorce in 2021. The four-bedroom, two-bathroom home cost $1.2 million, according to documents previously viewed by Business Insider.\n\nIt's a significant downsize from Xanadu 2.0, situated on the about 10.5 acres of land Bill Gates bought in the Medina suburb of Seattle, which is worth north of $183 million.\n\nAccording to Time, French Gates was never a big fan of the sprawling compound, outfitted with a 60-foot-long swimming pool, over 18 bathrooms, and 2,100-square-foot library.\n\nInstead, it appears she prefers the simple life of strolling to her local shops, neighbors who aren't tech titans, and a home that doesn't feel \"like arriving at Jurassic Park,\" as a former Microsoft intern once described Xanadu 2.0."
