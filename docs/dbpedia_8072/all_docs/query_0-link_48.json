Divorces have definitely increased, at least where I live. So many people realizing their relationships only worked because they spent 80% of their waking hours apart (work, school, etc.). I wouldn't be surprised at all if the divorce rate spikes even more this year.\n\nPost by kerouac2 on\n\nSince something like 50% of marriages in the United States end in divorce, what I wonder is why these announcements are considered to be news. On top of that with so many people never bothering to get married in the first place, none of it is anybody's business.\n\nWith people like Bezos and Gates, the only thing that people really talk about is the monetary aspect anyway.\n\nPost by spaceneedle on\n\nThe biggest question of note about this parting is what will happen to the Foundation.\n\nPost by kerouac2 on\n\nThey said they would continue to work together for the foundation.\n\nPost by kerouac2 on\n\nI am appalled that this subject is still in the news. Bill made \"inappropriate\" advances to some women 20 years ago? They spurned him, so what's the deal? I have been subjected to inappropriate advances from both women and men in my life. I never had a problem saying no even when I was groped. Should I have gone to the police? This is really getting ridiculous. Actually, I kind of miss the days when people made inappropriate advances to me.\n\nPost by bjd on\n\nI suppose we are going from a period when \"advances\" and other inappropriate behaviour was common and, if not condoned, at least sort of accepted, to the opposite extreme when anything done or said 20 years earlier is considered as dramatic. Perhaps we will end up somewhere in the middle in a few decades?\n\nPost by mich64 on\n\nFrom a report I heard today, it might have been more than an inappropriate situation. It is rumoured to be of a multi year affair that developed from a position of power over a subordinate, possibly the reason for his resignation from the board last year (although he denies this was the reason). I think we have not heard the end of this as also there are reports of his close relationship with Jeffrey Epstein, gossip at this point.\n\nPost by spaceneedle on\n\nI don't think that saying \"no\" to Bill Gates was necessarily an option, when you work(ed) at Microsoft.That is, if you want to KEEP working there...\n\nPost by fumobici on\n\nPeople using their superior positions in a workplace hierarchy to coerce sex is and has always been highly inappropriate, even when it was less taboo.\n\nPost by whatagain on\n\nI was open for any proposal, but they never came...\n\nPost by spaceneedle on\n\nPeople using their superior positions in a workplace hierarchy to coerce sex is and has always been highly inappropriate, even when it was less taboo.\n\n100%. As someone who experienced workplace harassment, none of this surprises me. But on a good note, it motivated me to work harder to get into a profession where I could work for myself and have less exposure to that bullshit.\n\nPost by whatagain on\n\nOn a more personal account, I realize i have married for... 27 years..."
