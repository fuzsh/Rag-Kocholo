        "text": "Bill Gates' divorce from Melinda Gates has not changed the Microsoft co-founder's feelings about marriage.\n\nDuring a conversation with The Sunday Times published May 1, Bill, 66, reflected on his marriage and divorce from the billionaire philanthropist.\n\n\"Every marriage as the kids leave the house will go through a transition,\" he told the publication. \"Mine sadly went through this transition called divorce. But from my point of view, it was a great marriage. I wouldn't have changed it. You know, I wouldn't choose to marry someone else.\"\n\nBill also said that he would \"marry Melinda all over again,\" though he doesn't have any immediate plans to walk down the aisle with anyone soon."
