        "text": "Topline\n\nMelinda French Gates announced Monday she is leaving the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation next month after more than two decades serving as co-chair, three years after divorcing co-founder Bill Gates following reports of his infidelity and meetings with Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nKey Facts\n\nGet Forbes Breaking News Text Alerts: We’re launching text message alerts so you'll always know the biggest stories shaping the day’s headlines. Text “Alerts” to (201) 335-0739 or sign up here.\n\nCrucial Quote\n\nIn a separate statement posted to X, Bill Gates thanked French Gates for her work with the foundation, saying: “Melinda has been instrumental in shaping our strategies and initiatives, significantly impacting global health and gender equality.” He also reiterated he is still “fully committed to the Foundation’s work across all our strategies.”\n\nSurprising Fact\n\nThe Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation will change its name to the Gates Foundation after French Gates’ departure as a way to “honor Bill Sr.’s legacy and Melinda’s contributions,” CEO Mark Suzman said in a notice to employees shared with Forbes. Moving forward, Bill Gates will be the sole chair.\n\nForbes Valuation\n\nWe estimate French Gates to have a net worth of about $11.3 billion as of Monday afternoon, making her the 182nd wealthiest person in the world.\n\nKey Background\n\nThe BIll & Melinda Gates Foundation was started by the couple in 2000 on the belief “that every life has equal value.” Over the past two decades, the foundation has given grants for work in gender equality, global health and global policy, and French Gates has focused on “family planning, maternal and child health,” according to her LinkedIn. At the end of 2022—which is the most recent financial information available—the foundation had about $68 billion in assets with another $68 billion in the Gates Foundation Trust. In 2021, the couple divorced after 27 years amid rumors of Bill Gates’ promiscuity and relationship with Epstein, who Gates had known since 2011 and continued to spend time with despite French Gates expressing displeasure, The New York Times reported. The Wall Street Journal reported French Gates had been considering divorce as early as 2019 after she found out about Gates’ continued meetings with Epstein. Following the divorce, the couple said they would allow themselves a two-year trial period to determine whether they could continue leading the foundation together and, if they couldn’t, French Gates would step down.\n\nFurther Reading\n\nForbesBill & Melinda Gates Foundation Chief Calls On More Billionaires To Do More PhilanthropyForbesMelinda French Gates"
