        "text": "Melinda and Bill Gates secretly separated over a year before their shocking 2021 divorce.\n\nDuring an interview with Time published Tuesday, the 59-year-old philanthropist revealed that she and the Microsoft founder, 68, began trading off who got to live at their massive, Pacific lodge-style home ahead of the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nMelinda explained that living separately from Bill, whom she was married to for 27 years, for over a year helped give her clarity about the state of their marriage.\n\n“It gave us the privacy to do what needed to be done in private,” she said of pandemic living.\n\n“You know, I separated first before I made the full decision about a divorce. And to be able to do that in private while I’m still trying to take care of the kids, while still making certain decisions about how you’re going to disentangle your life—thank God.”\n\nAlthough Melinda said her decision to divorce Bill was a very “personal thing,” there were other things she needed to consider before pulling the trigger.\n\n“I thought a lot about my three children,” she said. “But I certainly thought about the effect on the [Bill & Melinda Gates] foundation.”\n\n“Those are the three biggest buckets: me, the kids, and the foundation,” she continued. “And I wanted to make sure that when we came through it to the other side—when I came through it on my side—all of those pieces were intact.”\n\nMelinda shares daughters Jennifer, 28, Rory, 23, and Phoebe, 21, with her ex-husband.\n\nAlthough the divorce was “painful” for the activist, she said life “has been wonderful” ever since.\n\nWhen Melinda isn’t working on her many charitable endeavors, she finds herself skiing, spending time in her spiritual groups, going on safaris in Africa and traveling to see her family — including her son-in-law Nayel Nassar, who is set to compete in the Paris Olympics later this month.\n\nDespite living in a 66,000-square-foot compound for most of her married life, the mother of three has since moved into a smaller cottage-style home — which she much prefers to the mega-mansion that she never particularly liked.\n\n“I live in a neighborhood. Now I can walk to little stores. I can walk to the drugstore, I can walk to a restaurant,” she gushed. “I absolutely love it.”\n\nAs for her dating life, Melinda — who was last linked to former Fox reporter Jon Du Pre — said she is “of course” open to letting love in again.\n\nHer dream partner is “somebody who’s open to learning and who’s vibrant, and who’s smart, and somebody who challenges me and that I challenge.”\n\nHowever, the philanthropist played coy when asked if she had anyone in mind while making her list.\n\n“Not that I’m ready to talk about,” she teased."
