        "text": "Melinda and Bill, 66, married in 1994 and were together for 27 years before divorcing in May 2021. They have three children together — Jennifer, 25, Rory, 23, and Phoebe, 19 — who were always Melinda’s “main concern” during the separation.\n\nThe former couple also founded the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation in 2000 and continue to run it together following their separation — which French Gates credits for helping her process her emotions.\n\nIt was revealed in 2021 that Bill had a lengthy affair with a Microsoft employee in 2000 and that he reportedly asked out several women in the office while he was married, though it’s unclear how much French Gates knew about this behavior at the time."
