        "text": "Gates' father, Bill Gates Sr., died in September 2020. He was 94.\n\nGates and French Gates divorced in 2021 after 27 years of marriage. They continue to work together on philanthropic efforts through The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.\n\nGates also spoke about their divorce in his year-end blog post for 2021.\n\nRelated stories\n\n\"Melinda and I continue to run our foundation together and have found a good new working rhythm, but I can't deny that it's been a year of great personal sadness for me,\" he wrote last year.\n\nIn a CBS interview this March, French Gates opened up about the divorce from her perspective.\n\n\"It wasn't one moment or one specific thing that happened,\" she said. \"There just came a point in time where there was enough there that I realized it just wasn't healthy and I couldn't trust what we had.\"\n\nFrench Gates mentioned an affair Gates had in 2000 with a Microsoft employee. The New York Times reported last May that Gates was dismissive towards French Gates in meetings and pursued other women at Microsoft and the foundation while married, citing six people who were then currently or formerly employed by Gates.\n\nA representative for Gates, Bridgitt Arnold, told the Times that \"any claim that Gates spoke of his marriage or Melinda in a disparaging manner is false.\"\n\n\"The claim of mistreatment of employees is also false,\" she added. \"The rumors and speculation surrounding Gates's divorce are becoming increasingly absurd, and it's unfortunate that people who have little to no knowledge of the situation are being characterized as 'sources.'\""
