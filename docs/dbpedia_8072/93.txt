Melinda French Gates is ready for a change.

The philanthropist and ex-wife of Bill Gates announced she was stepping down as co-chair of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.

"The time is right for me to move forward into the next chapter of my philanthropy," Melinda shared on Instagram May 13. "This is a critical moment for women and girls in the U.S. and around the worldâ€”and those fighting to protect and advance equality are in urgent need of support."

"This is not a decision I came to lightly," the 59-year-old noted. "I am immensely proud of the foundation that Bill and I built together and of the extraordinary work it is doing to address inequities around the world."
