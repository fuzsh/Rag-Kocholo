        "text": "An eagerly awaited Friendly at the KG Stadium, Blantyre with Ashfield looking to continue their preparations with a test against higher League opposition in the Vics. This was only the home side`s second Match of the Pre-Season following a visit to Broadwood last Saturday against Cumbernauld Colts. A lovely evening ensured a good turn out and the Match itself was excellent with the game swinging from end to end. The home side started the brightest and were working the flanks well however Sean Doherty was marshalling his defence extremely well and the visitors only scare was a tremendous effort from the Vics left winger who had his shot brilliantly tipped over the bar by Ryan Dakhill in the Ashfield goal. At the other end, Ashfield were looking really dangerous and the pace of Rodden and Daily was causing concerns in the home defence. A brilliant `double save` from the home keeper from Burns and Rodden kept the score level before the home keeper produced a brilliant stop on the half hour mark following a piledriver from Ben Daily which the Keeper managed to get a hand to it and divert around the post. Following a couple of corners, Ashfield defender John Barr managed to get his head to the ball and his looping header crashed off the bar and was cleared to safety. Both teams were having a `go` at each other as the Match swung from end to end in the latter period of the first half before the Referee brought proceedings to a halt. The crowd inside the ground waited with expectation as what the second half would bring as they `swatted` the midges which were prevalent throughout the balmy evening.\n\nHT:- BLANTYRE VICS 0 ASHFIELD 0\n\nAgain it was the home side that started the brightest to the half and this time got their reward three minutes after the break following a lovely move down the right hand side which saw the ball cut back into the path of Sam McKenzie and the Vics Midfielder lashed the ball into the net despite the valiant attempt of Dakhill in the Ashfield Goal. Blantyre Vics 1 Ashfield 0. Ashfield struggled for the next 10 minutes as the home side upped the tempo and just as Ashfield thought they had `weathered the storm` an uncharacteristic mistake from Dakhill whilst playing the ball out from goal gave the Vics forwards the easy task of tapping the ball into the empty net. Blantyre Vics 2 Ashfield 0. After this point the `field dusted themselves down, made a couple of substitutes and went onto dominate the latter part of the Match, A header from Sean Doherty missed the post by inches before another couple of snap shots went over the bar. With 6 Minutes left on the clock a lovely move down the right saw Colin Leverage whip in a tremendous ball to the far post where an onrushing Brad Rodden bulleted the ball into the net the reduce the deficit. Blantyre Vics 2 Ashfield 1. Ashfield pushed forward at every opportunity and were rewarded with a free kick in the last minute on the edge of the box however the Vics Keeper `read` the flight of Ben Daily`s shot and held onto the ball comfortably. That was it - an excellent `work-out` for both teams and on this showing Blantyre and Ashfield can go into their next games with confidence,\n\nFT:- BLANTYRE VICS 2 ASHFIELD 1\n\nAshfield`s Team:- R Dakhill, S Doherty (Capt), J Barr, A Cairns, A Byrne, B Daly, J Crumlish, D Burns, B Rodden, B Daily and B Hepburn. Subs:- B Quate, M McManus, D Maguire, D Leverage, C Leverage and J Marr.\n\nAttendance:-170\n\nMan of the Match:-Brad Rodden\n\nSt Roch`s 5 Ashfield 4, Saturday 19th June 2021 - Springburn Park, Glasgow - K.O. 12 Noon.\n\nA really disappointing end to the Match from an Ashfield perspective as the young Team lost 2 goals in the final 2 minutes to lose the game from a winning position in what had been a terrific friendly for the sizeable crowd. Following a very hard and impressive 90 minutes in midweek against Blantyre Vics, the Ashfield Management Team made 7 changes to the line up bringing in 3 of Ashfield`s U20 Academy Team and a trialist Centre forward to line up alongside the prolific Ben Daily. As in most of the friendlies so far this season, the game started off at a terrific pace with both teams trying to get a strangehold early on however the opening exchanges were pretty even and it wasn`t until the half hour mark that the chances began to fall. Following a long throw in on the left hand side from St Roch`s the ball was played across goal finding the `Candy Rock` Centre forward who prodded the ball past Ben Quate to put St Roch`s ahead. St Roch`s 1 Ashfield 0. It didn`t however take much time for the `field, who had been working extremely hard, to level and the equaliser was an absolute screamer. Ben Daily picked up the ball fully 25 yards out before evading a couple of tackles and unleashing an unstoppable drive into the top corner of the net to the delight of the Ashfield bench and supporters. St Roch`s 1 Ashfield 1. The game now swung from end to end and Daily was foiled by the `Rock` Keeper when through on goal and this was followed up by a tremendous effort from an Ashfield `trialist who saw his 20 yard effort cannon back of the post before the `Candy` went ahead again courtesy of a penalty, with the young Ashfield defender getting on the wrong side of the St Roch`s striker, who stepped up and sent the Keeper the wrong way. St Roch`s 2 Ashfield 1. With 5 minutes to go in the half and it was `game on` again when Ben Daily broke clear of the Candy rearguard and drilled the ball low and hard under the keeper to level the scores. St Roch`s 2 Ashfield 2. Two minutes later and the Ashfield Striker completed his hat-trick this time placing a right foot shot past the advancing keeper who was left with no chance as Ashfield headed into the interval ahead. St Roch`s 2 Ashfield 3.\n\nHT:- ST ROCH`S 2 ASHFIELD 3\n\nAshfield were determined to get a bigger lead and despite having a couple of efforts were unable to stretch the scoreline and as the half wore on with a number of substitutes being made from both sides it was the team in Green that made the next breakthrough with 20 minutes left on the clock, A lovely move on the right saw the ball played through to a St Roch`s striker who made room for himself before despatching a shot into the roof of the net leaving Ben Quate with no chance. St Roch`s 3 Ashfield 3. The `field however hit back shortly after in this `topsy turvy` Match it was Ben Daily again breaking through the Rock defence to drill the ball home for his 4th goal of the game. This had been striking of the highest quality from the Ashfield striker who has taken his tally to 8 in 5 games. St Roch`s 3 Ashfield 4. The game continued to swing from end to end and Mark McManus had a free-kick for the `field which went narrowly over as the clock ticked towards the 90th minute. As the `field support were looking at their watches the `Candy Rock`were given a lifeline with a throw in level with the Ashfield box. The throw-in caused a `stramash` in the Ashfield box before the ball broke to a green and white jersey and the ball was hooked into the net to the delight of the large St Roch`s support. St Roch`s 4 Ashfield 4. Before the `field had a chance to `dust themselves` down they were confronted by an onrushing St Roch`s player who drove into the box and was upended by an Ashfield defender with the Referee having no hesitation in pointing to the spot. The Ashfield players protested stating that the defender got a touch to the ball. Up stepped the Candy No 9 and he drove the ball straight down the middle to win the game for St Roch`s. St Roch`s 5 Ashfield 4. A sore one and a learning one for the young team however it is all about `game Management` and seeing out a game from a winning positon.\n\nFT:- ST ROCH`S 5 ASHFIELD 4\n\nAshfield`s Team :- B Quate, C Leverage, J Marr, Trialist, Trialist, J Crumlish, B Hepburn, Trialist, B Dale, Trialist, Trialist and B Daily. Subs:- A Cairns, J Howat, Trialist, R Dakhill, McManus.\n\nAttendance:- 158\n\nMan of the Match:- B Daily\n\nArdrossan Winton Rovers 2 Ashfield 0 - Pre-Season Friendly - Saturday 10th July 2021 - Kick-Off 2pm\n\nBoth teams entered the lush pitch at Winton Park looking to `finely tune` their preparations ahead of next week`s opening Conference League Fixtures against Vale of Leven and Glasgow United respectively and the good sized Crowd were certainly treated to a competitive Match in the glorious Ayrshire sunshine. Some `old acquaintances` were met Pre-Match and it was good to see Ex-Ashfield Captain Kyle Lochhead marshalling his new troops at Ardrossan. The Match itself started off at great pace with the Ashfield front two of McManus and Daily looking extremely lively. The `field were certainly having the best of the opening exchanges however as sometimes happens it was the home side who took the lead with their first serious foray up the park. Jack Crumlish was guilty of a late tackle 22 yards out and up stepped the Ex-Ashfield player Lochhead who lashed the ball around the wall and into the far corner of the net to the delight of the home support. A tremendous effort leaving MacGuire in the Ashfield Goal with no chance. Ardrossan W.R. 1 Ashfield 0. Ashfield sprung into action and a lovely move saw Darren Burns break free of the Ardrossan rearguard only to see his lob gathered well by the Rovers Keeper. Next up for Ashfield as they pursued an equaliser was a lovely one-two on the edge of the box which saw Brogan Daly drive a left foot shot inches past the post with the Keeper beaten. This was Ashfield`s best part of the Match now and a sweeping move down the right hand side started by Ryan McManus saw Colin Leverage drive the ball across the box to an onrushing Ben Daily however the ball took a bump and the prolific Ashfield striker did not make proper contact with the Rovers Keeper pushing the ball away for a corner. The sun was draining and following an injury to a Rovers player who unfortunately had to be stretchered off - we wish him well - a must needed drinks break was had. The `field struggled after that to keep the pressure up and it was the home side who finished off the stronger side with a succession of corners and a volley which the new Ashfield Keeper Thomas McGuire did well to block.\n\n​\n\nHT:- ARDROSSAN W.R. 1 ASHFIELD 0\n\n​\n\n​\n\nThere was only one change to either side initially as both teams tried to take control. It was beginning to become a bit of a midfield tussle and chances were at a premium for the first 15 minutes of the half. The Referee was also kept bust with a number of crunching tackles and a quick `melee` to deal with however things settled down after that. The home side then began to have some joy down the right hand side and in the 66th Minute reaped their reward following another free-kick. A wicked curling ball in-between the back four and the Ashfield Keeper saw a Rovers Midfielder `ghost` in at the far post to place his header out of the reach of McGuire to put the home side further ahead. Ardrossan W.R. 2 Ashfield 0. This was a real blow for Ashfield as they made positive substitutions to try and claw their way back into the Match bringing on Dean Leverage and young Nicky McLaughlin who`s pace immediately caused the Rovers back four a problem however the young winger didn`t last too long and unfortunately picked up an ankle knock and was replaced by a Trialist. As the `field pushed forward they began to get hit on the break by an organised Ardrossan team who kept their shape well throughout the 90 minutes and a couple of last ditch tackles prevented the scoreline increasing and it was the `field who were delighted to hear the final whistle. It was a great work-out for both teams and the `field must take all of the positives from their last 7 Friendlies, scoring an average of 3 a game, into next week`s Conference B encounter with Glasgow United (Shettleston) at the Peugeot Ashfield Stadium - KO 2pm.\n\n​\n\n​\n\nFT:- ARDROSSAN W R 2 ASHFIELD 0\n\n​\n\n​\n\nAshfield`s Team:- T MacGuire, J Barr, B Daly, S Doherty, J Marr, C Leveridge, M McManus, R McManus, B Daily, D Burns and J Crumlish. Subs:- N McLaughlin, A Cairns, C Beedham, D Leverage, Trialist and R McLean.\n\n​\n\nMan of the Match:- Thomas MacGuire\n\n​\n\nAttendance:- 174\n\nAshfield 3 Glasgow United 3, West of Scotland Football League Conference B - Saturday 17th July 2021 - Kick-Off 2pm - Peugeot Ashfield Stadium\n\nWith the Pre-Season training and games all complete the `field welcomed Glasgow United for the first time in many years. The visitors have been in existence since 1903 however made the decision during the close season break to rename from Shettleston to Glasgow United. This was an eagerly awaited Match and both teams entered the Saracen Park turf in the sweltering heat in their traditional strips and the good sized crowd were treated to an exciting Match albeit an `emotional rollercoaster` as the pendulum swung from one side to another right until the last kick of the ball.\n\nAs the opening exchanges proved, both sides were determined to start their season off with a victory and despite a lively start chances were at a premium due to the competitiveness in the Midfield area and the number of stops. In the 14th Minute this all changed when the visitors went ahead. United were given a free-kick fully 25 yards out and up stepped No 7 Steffan Graham who curled the ball into the corner of the net despite the attempt of the Ashfield Keeper. Ashfield 0 Glasgow United 1. The `field had to dust themselves down and get back into the Match however within a minute were 2-0 down and the source was from the same format as the first. Glasgow United received a free-kick 22 yards out to the right of the Ashfield box, up stepped Steffan Graham and this time he whipped the ball over the wall and right into the corner of the net leaving Thomas McGuire in the Ashfield goal with no chance. The celebrations from the United team knew that this was a `big start` for them and the `field were up against it now. Ashfield 0 Glasgow United 2.\n\nThe home side began to make inroads and started utilising the flanks well with Baz Hepburn and Colin Leverage trying the link in with the front two. The `field began to exert some pressure backed by a strong wind and almost pulled a goal back following another free-kick. Brogan Daly took the award and his left foot curler missed the upright by inches. Shortly after and the `field reduced the deficit in the 27th minute following a defensive mix up in the United defence. Ben Daily was applying pressure to the United back four and the ball was played out to the side of the park by the Keeper however Baz Hepburn picked the ball up before it ran out for a throw-in and lofted the ball from fully 25 yards over the United Keeper and into the far corner of the net to the delight of the home support. Ashfield 1 Glasgow United 2. It was `game on` now and the `field saw their chance to get back into the game and forced the play right up until half time however had to be careful as the visitors broke quickly and a couple of breakaways caused alarm in the `field box. As the fans looked at their watches for Half time, the `field conjured up an equaliser following a corner on the right hand side. Baz Hepburn drove the ball into the box and found the head of John Barr and his powerful header was saved by the United Keeper however the ball broke out to Darren Burns who made space for himself and drove the ball in through a ruck of players. Ashfield 2 Glasgow United 2. The home support were delighted and as the Referee blew for half time the expectant support knew that this Match had a few twists and turns left in it.\n\n​\n\nHT:- ASHFIELD 2 GLASGOW UNITED 2\n\n​\n\n​\n\nThe temperature gauge was tipping 80f at the start of the Second Half and it was certainly going to be a grueling half in the heat as both teams started in the same determined fashion. The game was never far away from `boiling point` and a couple of altercations kept the Referee busy in the early stages of the half. That man Steffan Graham again drove a free-kick, this time backed by a strong wind, from 25 yards out with the ball missing the bar by inches. Ryan McManus was beginning to look like himself again following injury and a lovely move saw the ball played through to Ben Daily on the edge of the box, with the Ashfield Centre Forward`s driven effort brilliantly palmed to safety by the United Keeper. Ashfield began to exert pressure and in the 65th minute got their rewards following a sweeping move down the right. Ben Daily drove at the United defence and his driven cross was back-heeled into the net by Ryan McManus to the delight of the home support. Ashfield 3 Glasgow United 2. What a tremendous comeback from the `field however this was almost undone a couple of minutes later when the ball bobbled about the Ashfield box only to see the ball come back off the far post with the resultant driven effort into the side netting to the relief of the`field. Both teams made a number of substitutes in the sweltering heat as the game ebbed and flowed .\n\nAs the game approached the 90th Minute, the visitors were awarded another free-kick again around 25 yards out. Yes, up stepped Graham again and his net-bound free-kick was brilliantly tipped round the post by McGuire in the Ashfield goal. It was last chance now for the the visitors as the corner was played in with the ball only being partially cleared and after one block it was Josh McCulloch who lashed the ball into the roof of the net to the delight of the travelling support. A real blow for Ashfield as the players sank to the ground. Ashfield 3 Glasgow United 3. The Referee just had time to centre the ball before bringing proceedings to a close as both teams got their breaths back. A sore one for the `field to lose a goal so late but credit to United for pressing right up until injury time. The `field will `dust themselves` down and prepare now for their trip to Cambuslang Rangers next Saturday.\n\n​\n\n​\n\nFT:- ASHFIELD 3 GLASGOW UNITED 3\n\n​\n\nAshfield`s Team: - T MacGuire, C Leverage, B Daly, A Cairns, J Barr, J Howat, B Hepburn, A Byrne, B Daily, R McManus and D Burns. Subs:- N McLaughlin, M McManus, B Quate (GK), A Marenghi, D Leverage, J Marr\n\n​\n\nAttendance:- 89\n\n​\n\nMan of the Match:- Darren Burns\n\nCambuslang Rangers 2 Ashfield 0- Somervell Park, Cambuslang - K.O. 2pm - Saturday 24th July 2021 - West of Scotland Football League - Conference B\n\nThe excellent weather continued as both teams warmed up in the scorching sunshine at Somervell Park ahead of this eagerly awaited League Match. The visitors were sporting for the first time, their new 135th Anniversary strip with the home side in their traditional blue. The healthy crowd poured into this traditional Football ground as both teams set off at great pace with neither team giving `an inch` in the opening exchanges. Sean Doherty at the back for Ashfield and John Gemmell at the back for Cambuslang were prominent figures in the early stages winning their fair share of headers and possession. Ashfield, playing in a 4-3-3 formation, were keen to get the wide players into the game and from a Cambuslang attack in the 15th minute broke well with Darren Burns playing in Sean Maguire on the left hand side. The Ashfield forward quickly reverse passed the ball into the path of Ben Daily who went through one on one with the Rangers Keeper. Unfortunately for the visitors the Ashfield striker`s effort was blocked by the advancing keeper. A big chance for the `field and they were made to rue that miss 5 minutes later when young Ben Quate in the Ashfield goal let a passback from Brogan Daly slip under his foot and the ball trickled into the net to the anguish of the Ashfield support. A bizarre goal in what had been Ben`s first involvement and the Ashfield Under 20`s Keeper was distraught. Cambuslang Rangers 1 Ashfield 0. The home side seized on the opporunity that the `field Keeper might be feeling the after effects of the goal and had a terrific 25 yard effort which bounced up before reaching the Ashfield Keeper. Quate managed to deal with the bounce and diverted it onto the bar and over for a Rangers corner. The home side put the visitors under a bit of pressure for the next 10 minutes however Sean Doherty`s well marshalled defence dealt well with it and it was Ashfield that finished the stronger side with a succession of corners before the half time whistle.\n\n​\n\nHT:- CAMBUSLANG RANGERS 1 ASHFIELD 0\n\n​\n\nAshfield made a couple of changes at the start of the second half, changing their formation to a 3-4-3 bringing on Chris McLaughlin and Alan Cairns and the match started off at a great pace again despite the enormous heat. It was the home side that started to carve the chances and the `field got a warning when a lovely move saw Williamson break through to slot it past Quate however the Referee blew for offside. Shortly after and Ashfield did find themselves further behind as the ball was lofted over the back four to find an onrushing Williamson again and the Rangers forward drove the ball under the advancing Quate to put the home side 2-0 up. Cambuslang Rangers 2 Ashfield 0. A real blow for Ashfield however they still had time in their hands as they set about trying to get themselves back in the game. Chris McLaughlin was offering a steady influence in the middle of park and after some good passing play from the visitors it was McLaughlin who curled the ball inches over the bar from 20 yards out followed by another shot from Baz Hepburn which the Keeper tipped over. As the Referee enforced another water break, the home side almost increased their lead further with a couple of efforts which went over the bar however as the clock began to tick down it was the `field that had a glorious chance on the 86th minute which would have ensured a grandstand finish after Ben Daily drove at the Rangers defence cutting in before playing the ball across the box and with the goal gaping Jack Crumlish, who had been one of Ashfield`s top performers today, drove his effort past the post. As Referee brought proceedings to a close shortly after\n\nthe home side were delighted with the result following their 5-1 win in Midweek. The `field will `dust themselves` down for a midweek home fixture against high flying Greenock knowing that they will need to be more clinical with their chances when presented.\n\n​\n\nFT:- CAMBUSLANG RANGERS 2 ASHFIELD 0\n\n​\n\nAshfield`s Team:- B Quate, C Leverage, B Daly, J Marr, S Doherty, J Crumlish, B Hepburn, S Macguire, B Daily, D Burns and A Byrne.Subs:- A Cairns, T McGuire, R McManus, D Leverage, J Howat, C McLaughlin and J Barr\n\n​\n\nAttendance:- 181\n\n​\n\nMan of the Match:- Jack Crumlish ran this week`s winner close however Sean Doherty was immense in the first half and nudges the award.\n\nAshfield 4 Greenock 4 - West of Scotland League Conference B - Wednesday 28th July 2021 - KO 7.30pm - Peugeot Ashfield Stadium, Glasgow .\n\nThe continual summer weather was beginning to `take its toll` on the look of the pitches and it was fair to say that there were more patches of light brown than green on Saracen Park however it did not affect the game in any way as both these teams served up a feast of football last night and it was a shame that there was not a full house in to see it as both teams produced some excellent football and some terrific goals, this coupled with some erratic refereeing and it certainly made for an interesting evening`s entertainment. Where do we start ? Ashfield welcomed back their full strike force back following injury and suspension and certainly give the Greenock rearguard probably their hardest 90 minutes so far of an impressive opening to their season. Ashfield started off on the front foot but were fully aware of the potent strike force of Greenock and the guile and strength of their Midfield area. The Referee upset the Ashfield support as early as 20 seconds as he awarded a very soft foul on the edge of the box to the visitors however Ryan Dakhill back in goals for the `field was delighted to see the effort go narrowly over. Brad Rodden was back from suspension following his ordering off at the Penny Cars Stadium last Season v Glasgow University and certainly `caught the eye` in the early stages with his his pace and non-stop running which brought so many other players into the game and after a bright opening for the home side, they got their reward on the 12th minute. Chris McLaughlin was having an excellent Match in Midfield for the `field and was linking up well with his team mates & Ben Daily who was also looking lively picked the ball up midway inside the Greenock half and after evading a couple of tackles drove the ball into the far corner of the net from 25 yards to the delight of the home support. An excellent strike from the Ashfield Centre. Ashfield 1 Greenock 0. The visitors were sprung into action and drove at the `field defence and McLaughlin of Ashfield was the first player in the book for a tug of the jersey. The `field had to withstand a couple of free kicks again which on the whole were well defended however on the 25th minute the Greenock Centre managed to drift away from his marker and his net-bound header was brilliantly palmed to safety by Ryan Dakhill. The visitors were made to pay for this miss as shortly after Ben Daily found room on the left hand side and drove at the `nock defence before driving the ball low and hard across the box for an onrushing Brad Rodden, who lashed the ball into the net to the delight of the Ashfield support. Ashfield 2 Greenock 0. It was end to end stuff now following the goal with Ashfield trying to put the game `to bed` whereas the visitors were desperate to pull a goal back and in the 41st minute they did just that albeit in controversial circumstances. A free-kick to the far post saw Ryan Dakhill collide with James Mark with the ball breaking to Adam Houlihan who drove the ball into the back of the net to bring the Renfrewshire outfit back in the game. Ashfield 2 Greenock 1. The `field appealed in vain for a foul on the Keeper and the Referee brought proceedings shortly after to a halt and the half time interval.\n\n​\n\nHT:- ASHFIELD 2 GREENOCK 1\n\n​\n\nThe half time refreshments were going down well from the `Ashfield Cafe` as the game restarted and it was much the same with the visitors having the slight edge due to the long throwing expert of their No 3. This initially caused Ashfield problems however as the Ashfield Keeper Dakhill got his eye in then the `field managed to cope better. It appeared that the visitors would be the team most likely to make the breakthrough in the 2nd however a lovely move on the right flank saw the ball break to Ryan McManus and as he did in the last home game prodded the ball home from close range. Ashfield 3 Greenock 1. The visitors flooded forward at every opportunity in order to salvage the game and after a series of thrown-ins and corners they got their reward in the 65th minute as the ball was played to the far post the ball was volleyed through a ruck of players and into the net. It was `game on` again`. Ashfield 3 Greenock 2. Surely the `field would not let another lead slip following the anguish of their last home game however with 15 minutes to go that is what happened and it was a carbon copy of the 2nd goal with the ball being driven through a ruck of players and into the net. Ashfield 3 Greenock 3. This time Ashfield set about searching for the winner and following a couple of changes in personnel managed to get their noses ahead again. Ben Daily again picked the ball up on the left flank before cutting in and drilling the ball past the `nock Keeper with the aid of a bounce to the roar from the Main Stand at Saracen Park. Ashfield 4 Greenock 3. Another great goal Ben and I am sure that tally will be added to as the Season unfolds. There was still 10 minutes to go and the visitors through caution to the wind in a bid to snatch a point and the Match was really competitve in Midfield with the Referee brandishing Cards on a regular basis. On the 89th Minute the visitors were awarded a free-kick 22 yards out. The Ashfield wall looked ok however it was unable to block Dylan McLaughlin`s curling shot into the corner of the net to deny Ashfield their first victory in the League this Season however it was probably merited as the `nock fought back on three occasions. Ashfield 4 Greenock 4. Chris McLaughlin`s last minute 2nd booking for kicking the ball away failed to dampen the spirits on what had been a decent performance from himself and from the Ashfield Team against a good Greenock outfit. It`s back down to Ayrshire this Saturday (31/07/2021) and a visit to Merksworth Park, Dalry for the first time in many years.\n\n​\n\nFT:- ASHFIELD 4 GREENOCK 4\n\n​\n\nAshfield`s Team:- R Dakhill, J Barr, A Byrne, J Marr, S Doherty, J Crumlish, B Rodden, J Howat, B Daily, C McLaughlin and Ryan McManus\n\nSubs:- D Macguire, A Cairns, C Leverage, D Leverage, B Daly, D Burns, B Hepburn, C Beedham, N McLaughlin and B Quate\n\n​\n\nMan of the Match:- A few candidates in the Black and White Hoops.

As the crowd drifted in to the neat and tidy surroundings of Merksworth Park, no one could have predicted the final scoreline although the `field`s overall play so far in the League had merited more than the 2 points from 3 games gained losing 2 late goals to deny them victory in their 2 home games. The North Glasgow outfit were sporting again their 135 year old Centenary Strip with the home side wearing all red as the Referee let proceedings begin and it was the visitors who for the first 10 minutes, and shooting down the slight slope, took control and after a couple of narrow escapes managed to get their noses ahead in the 7th minute following a lovely through ball from John Barr. Brad Rodden was first to react however was closed quickly by the last defender and Keeper however managed to get a touch to guide the ball into the corner of the net to put the `field 1-0 up. Dalry Thistle 0 Ashfield 1. The visitors continued to test the Thistle back four and the Keeper had to produce another excellent save to deny Rodden again. The home side then began to come into the game and their Midfield were beginning to show some promising signs. Ashfield got a warning on the 15 minute mark when Thistle were awarded a free-kick on the edge of the box however the effort was blocked and cleared to safety however only 2 minutes later and the game was all-square. A lovely through ball from the impressive Thistle No 7 Ashe saw Mugwanda break clear of his marker only to see his effort brilliantly blocked by Dakhill in the Ashfield goal. The ball broke out and was gathered again by the Thistle Centre who took his time before lashing the ball into the net from 18 yards to the delight of the home support. Dalry Thistle 1 Ashfield 1. This goal gave Ashfield a jolt especially after their bright opening however within 10 minutes were ahead again. Again a lovely ball through to Rodden on the right hand flank by John Barr saw the Ashfield Forward glide past his marker and as he raced in on goal drove the ball low and hard past the advancing keeper to put the `field ahead again. An excellent finish. Dalry Thistle 1 Ashfield 2. Brad Rodden wasn`t stopping there as within 2 minutes he picked up a cross ball on the other flank before evading a couple of tackles and lashed the ball into the roof of the net from 18 yards out to complete his hat-trick. Dalry Thistle 1 Ashfield 3. The home side rocked for a while and despite pushing forward at every opportunity to get back in the game it was Ashfield that continued to break with pace and purpose and on the 35th minute Ben Daily picked the ball up midway inside the Thistle half before driving at the home defence and unleashing a 25 yard effort which sailed into the top corner of the net leaving King in the home goal helpless. Dalry Thistle 1 Ashfield 4. The home side were now struggling with the pressure from the visitors and just on the stroke of half time, Ashfield were awarded a free-kick on the right hand side. Brad Rodden whipped the ball in to the 6 yard box however a home defender seemed to divert the ball into his own net before the Keeper could gather the ball to put the `field 5-1 up at Half time. Dalry Thistle 1 Ashfield 5.\n\n​\n\nHT:- DALRY THISTLE 1 ASHFIELD 5\n\n​\n\nThe home side had a lot to contemplate as they started the second half off with neither teams making any changes. Dalry were keen to put the `field under pressure in the second half however the visitors had other ideas and within 2 minutes of the restart Brad Rodden picked the ball up on the edge of box on the right hand side before cutting in and drilling a left foot shot in at the post to the delight of the travelling support. Dalry Thistle 1 Ashfield 6. The pressure continued and after a succession of dangerous corners the ball was played across the 6 yard box for an onrushing Darren Burns who made no mistake for his 2nd Goal of the Season. Dalry Thistle 1 Ashfield 7. There was no rest-bite for the home side despite a water break in the scorching sunshine as it was Ashfield, after making a number of substitutes, that continued to put pressure on the Thistle back four. A further corner was delivered by Brad Rodden and this time the ball was met by the Ashfield Captain Sean Doherty who bulleted a header past the Thistle Keeper for No 8. Dalry Thistle 1 Ashfield 8. Colin Leverage who came on for the injured John Barr was having a lot of success down the right hand side and from this area a floated ball was played to the far post for an onrushing Baz Hepburn to guide to ball into the net despite the close attention of the Thistle defenders. Dalry Thistle 1 Ashfield 9. Ashfield were in no mood to let up and Ben Daily was brought down 22 yards out with the Referee having no hesitation in awarding the free-kick. Baz Hepburn stepped up and placed the ball into the bottom corner of the net to ensure the visitors had reached double figures. Dalry Thistle 1 Ashfield 10. It had been a long afternoon for the home side however they never stopped playing Football and the Ashfield back four had to be on their toes throughout the 90 minutes. This was highlighted by a wicked curling corner in the 89th Minute which caught out Jonny Howat and Ryan Dakill at the front post as the ball ended up in the net. Dalry Thistle 2 Ashfield 10. Shortly after the Referee brought proceedings to a close and the `field headed back up the B737 delighted with their performance and goal tally.\n\nThis was the first time Ashfield had scored 10 since a Scottish Junior Cup 2nd Round tie in 2008 against Whitehills (10-0) however we have to go away back to 2004/05 Season for the `field`s last 10 goal haul away from home and that came in the Central League Division 2 at Coltness United (Newmains). Prior to that Ashfield also scored 10 in the Scottish Junior Cup 2nd Round in 1990 away at Scone Thistle (10-0) and in the Scottish Junior Cup 1st Round in 1952 away at Whitletts Victoria.\n\n​\n\n​\n\nFT:- DALRY THISTLE 2 ASHFIELD 10\n\n​\n\nAshfield`s Team:- R Dakhill, J Barr, D Leverage, J Marr, S Doherty, D Burns, B Hepburn, R McManus, B Daily, D Maguire and B Rodden. Subs:- C Leverage, A Cairns, T MacGuire (GK), J Howat, C McLaughlin, J Crumlish, A Byrne and M McManus\n\n​\n\nMan of the Match:- Fantastic Team performance form the `field with everyone on top form however Brad Rodden was simply unplayable at times today scoring and linking up with his fellow forwards.\n\n​\n\nAttendance:-78\n\nKello Rovers 2 Ashfield 3 , Nithsdale Park, Kirkconnel, Dumfriesshire - West of Scotland Football League - Conference B - Kick-Off 7.30pm\n\nAshfield made their first trip down to Kirkconnel for over 50 years and put in a real workmanlike performance to come back up to North Glasgow with a vital 3 points. The `field buoyed by their tremendous display at Dalry last Saturday made one change to the Team with Colin Leverage coming in for Baz Hepburn as the visitors , sporting their away strip of Red and Grey, started the game on the front foot. As the crowd were still coming into the ground the `field carved an early opportunity which was blocked for a corner. Daily and Rodden were utilising their pace well in the early stages and the home side were having to work hard to keep the visitors at bay. On the 14th minute, the `field made the breakthrough courtesy of a wonderful goal from Sean Doherty. Ashfield were awarded a corner at the far corner and a lovely curling delivery from Rodden found an onrushing Doherty who bulleted his header into the net to the delight of the travelling support. Kello Rovers 0 Ashfield 1. A great start for the visitors and more was to come shortly after. Kello were forcing the game at every opportunity also and were utilising the flanks well however were struggling to find their Centre forward and as such Dakhill in the Ashfield Goal was kept quiet in the early stages. Another move carved out of Ben Daily`s pace saw the Ashfield Centre break clear on the right and both McManus and Rodden narrowly missed getting the final touch. Rodden was up next and a weaving run on the right saw him drive into the box only to see his shot cannon off the base of the post and was cleared to safety. It wasn`t long before the `field increased their lead and Ryan McManus does what he does well and picked up a loose ball in the box and after evading a couple of tackles drilled the ball low and hard into the net. Kello Rovers 0 Ashfield 2. The home side knew they had to stop the way the game was going and rolled up their sleeves and started to make inroads into the Ashfield back four. A number of corners were won however were dealt well by the Ashfield defence and chances were at a premium. As the half headed towards the interval the Referee was kept busy with some hard tackling however as the clock approached the 45th minute the game turned on its head following a long clearance by a Kello defender. The Rovers No 9 went up for the ball and the Referee deemed that the advancing Ashfield Keeper had infringed and pointed to the spot. The home side sent Dakhill the wrong way from 12 yards to pull a goal back and it was `game on`. Kello Rovers 1 Ashfield 2. The `field would have been disappointed only going in 1 goal ahead at the interval with everything to play for in the Second half.\n\n​\n\n​\n\nHT:- KELLO ROVERS 1 ASHFIELD 2\n\n​\n\n​\n\nThe home side were buoyed by their late first half goal and were the better team in the first 15 minutes of the half testing the Ashfield back four at every opportunity however were up against a defence playing well with Doherty commanding in the air and Barr and Marr holding onto possession . Even although the home side were pressurising, chances were still not prevalent and Dakhill on the whole was kept remarkably quiet. The `field did not have the same cohesion going forward and a couple of substitutes were made to try and win the Midfield area. Daily was really unlucky on a couple of occasions with narrow offside decisions not going the way of the Ashfield Centre. With 20 minutes to go the game changed and the move started with Ashfield attacking. The ball was lost in the Rovers half and a lovely diagonal ball was played to the Kello No 9 on the left flank. The Rovers forward drove forward evading a last ditch tackle and as Ryan Dakhill in the Ashfield Goal advanced the forward drilled the ball into the far corner of the net to the roar of the home support. Kello Rovers 2 Ashfield 2. A blow for the `field as they were quite comfortable at that stage however the goal rocked them and they set about trying to get ahead again and within 5 minutes did that. The `field earned a number of corners with one of them bouncing off a couple of players before reaching John Barr on the edge of the six yard box and with quick feet, the Ashfield defender lashed the ball through a ruck of players and in off the post to put the `field ahead again. Kello Rovers 2 Ashfield 3. The home side threw everything at Ashfield in the last 10 minutes with the Rovers being slightly guilty of overplaying the long ball which more often than not was dealt with by Doherty and Barr in the heart of the Ashfield defence. The Referee played an additional 6 minutes of injury time before the `field could celebrate a terrific three points at a difficult venue.\n\nThe Matches are coming quickly and Ashfield welcome high flying Ardeer Thistle on Saturday (7th). Please note due to a Glasgow Tigers Speedway event, this Match has been switched to Lochburn Park, home of Maryhill with a 2pm Kick-Off.\n\n​\n\nFT:- KELLO ROVERS 2 ASHFIELD 3\n\n​\n\n​\n\nAshfield`s Team:- R Dakhill, C Leverage, D Leverage, J Marr, J Barr, S Doherty, D Macguire, D Burns, B Daily, R McManus and B Rodden. Subs:- T MacGuire (GK), J Crumlish, A Cairns, J Howat, N McLaughlin and M McManus\n\n​\n\nMan of the Match:- Some good performances in a tough encounter this evening, however Sean Doherty led by example, scoring the first goal and winning most 50/50 balls throughout the evening.\n\n​\n\nAttendance:- 100\n\n​\n\nAshfield 1 Ardeer Thistle 1, Lochburn Park, Maryhill - West of Scotland League Conference B, Saturday 7th August 2021 - Kick Off 2pm.\n\nThis was an eagerly awaited Match between two teams in a rich vein on form with Ardeer Thistle sitting proudly at the top of Conference B. The Match was switched to Lochburn Park, Maryhill due to a Glasgow Tigers Speedway Event at the Peugeot Ashfield Stadium however it is always an enjoyable ground to watch a Match. Ardeer, backed by a large and vociferous crowd entered the Lochburn pitch sporting their all Red strip with the `field in their traditional Black & White hoops and straight from the kick-off both teams set their stall out to play fast attacking Football. Ashfield were enforced to make 4 changes to the team who won down at Kirkconnel in midweek and were playing in a 4-3-3 formation with the front three looking to carry on there they left off. Ashfield started brightly however were hit on the break a couple of times with the pace of the front two of Ardeer and in particular the No 9 Ryan Wilson was certainly catching the eye and in 12 minutes the visitors went ahead. The goal started from an Ashfield attack however the ball was lost and played through to Wilson who used his pace running at the Ashfield back four and from 18 yards out managed to get a shot away which unfortunately McGuire failed to hold and the ball went in off the far post to put Thistle ahead. Ashfield 0 Ardeer Thistle 1. An early blow for the `field however they recovered well and started to find their feet after 20 minutes following a number of corners. A couple of half efforts were well gathered by the impressive Thistle Goalkeeper and the `field got another warning in the 22nd minute when the Thistle No 6 found room on the edge of the box and despatched a left foot drive inches past McGuire`s post. The Ashfield front three had found it difficult to hold up the play and were guilty of being caught offside by a well marshalled defence however on the half hour mark, the `field should have been level. A lovely move involving Darren Burns and Ryan McManus saw the latter make room for himself on the edge of the box and he curled a right foot shot past the Thistle Keeper only to see the ball cannon back off the post to the anguish of the home support. Next up was a tremendous volley from McLaughlin which missed the crossbar by inches and then a moment of controversy when Ashfield were denied from our angle a stonewall penalty. Darren Burns again played the ball through to Ryan McManus and as the Ashfield forward got ahead of his marker was brought down. The Referee decided to bring back play for a foul on Burns to the dismay of the home support. The game ebbed and flowed from one end to another with the home side going onto hit woodwork again following a corner which saw Jonny Howat`s header cannon back off the crossbar and as the Referee brought proceeding to a close the Crowd knew they were in for another pulsating 45 minutes.\n\n​\n\n​\n\nHT:- ASHFIELD 0 ARDEER THISTLE 1\n\n​\n\n​\n\nIf the first half was `all action`, the second half did not disappoint however this time the home side took more of a grip of proceedings and taking in all their efforts in the second period were unlucky not to take all three points. However they had to work so hard against a very good Ardeer side. Ashfield did have a lot of pressure however it really was not until the last 20 minutes of the Match that the chances began to happen. Another penalty shout was waved away by the Referee for Ashfield however on the 66th Minute another major talking point was the awarding of a penalty to the visitors with firstly no real appeals from Thistle players however the Referee deemed that James Marr infringed a Thistle player and up stepped the Ardeer No 3, who had been impressive throughout, however to the frustrations of the travelling support he drove the ball wide from 12 yards out. As the clock ticked down towards the last 10 minutes, Ashfield finally got their equaliser and an excellent goal it was. Nicky McLaughlin picked up the ball inside the Thistle half, finding Darren Burns whose dipping cross found Ryan McManus at the edge of the box and the Ashfield striker took one touch before clipping the ball into the top corner of the net to the delight of the home support. A really good finish and had to be to beat the Thistle Keeper. Ashfield 1 Ardeer Thistle 1. Baz Hepburn came on as substitute and made an immediate impact, firstly clipping a free kick narrowly over however with 5 minutes to go Baz broke down the left and after evading a couple of tackles played the ball into the 6 yard box finding Ben Daily who somehow missed the target by inches. As the game went into injury time, Baz Hepburn again picked the ball up midway inside the Thistle half and again started on one of his mazy runs and as he reached the edge of the box let fly with a dipping shot which crashed off the bar as the Ashfield support held their heads. A minute later and the Referee brought the Match to a close. A terrific match was had between two determined and skilful teams and on this display it could be a good season for both if they can maintain this standard. The `field will be slightly disappointed at not picking up full points however were behind for over an hour and survived a penalty scare . The games are coming thick and fast and both teams will have to recuperate ahead of important fixtures against Renfrew and Cambuslang Rangers respectively.\n\n​\n\n​\n\nFT:- ASHFIELD 1 ARDEER THISTLE 1\n\n​\n\nAshfield`s Team:- T McGuire, C Leverage, B Daly, J Marr, S Doherty, D Burns, B Rodden, C McLaughlin, B Daily, J Howat and R McManus Subs:- B Quale, N McLaughlin, A Byrne, B Hepburn, and M McManus.\n\n​\n\nMan of the Match:- There were some tremendous individual performances from Ashfield today infact there was not a failure at all and the substitutes also made a huge impact to the game however Ryan McManus held the ball up extremely well today bringing his colleagues into the game and capped his display off with a wonderful effort into the top left hand corner.\n\n​\n\nAttendance:- 100\n\nGoals from today`s game on attached:- https://youtu.be/FcgoYnBTFpE\n\nMany thanks to Davie Brown\n\nAshfield 6 Newmains United 2 , Saturday 14th August 2021 - 2pm - Peugeot Ashfield Stadium, Glasgow. West of Scotland League Conference B\n\nThe dust had settled and the `post mortem` had been carried out following the `field`s uncharacteristic collapse in the second half at Renfrew last Wednesday as the Management Team`shuffled` around the pack. The start of the Season has been`full on` with every team playing Saturday/Wednesday since the 17th July and as such this is where a strong squad comes into play. As the teams entered the pitch to initially heavy rain, which cleared, the `field knew this was an important game and started the Match against a determined Newmains Team who were looking to get more points on the board with the goal-scoring stalwart Kris Jarvie leading the line up front for them. It was the home side however who forced the early pace and the Newmains Keeper was in top form saving at least three net-bound efforts and it wasn`t until the 26th Minute before Ashfield got their `noses` in front. Ashfield were `shooting down`to the Springburn end in the first half and the swirling wind was not helping either team however the breakthrough came from a long throw in from Brad Rodden on the left hand side with Sean Doherty rising above the advancing Keeper to nod the ball over his head and into the net to put the `field ahead. Ashfield 1 Newmains Utd 0. It was one way traffic at this stage with Rodden and McManus linking up well and within 10 minutes the `field went further ahead. Again a long throw-in from Brad Rodden this time on the right clearly hit the Newmains defender`s hand in the box with the Referee having no hesitation in pointing to the spot. Brad Rodden stepped and lashed the Penalty into the roof of the net to the delight of the home support. Ashfield 2 Newmains Utd 0. This goal seemed to galvanise the visitors and a number of attacking moves almost brought success , one in particular bringing out a tremendous one handed save from McGuire in the Ashfield goal however Newmains were not to be denied and 4 minutes before half time a low shot was saved by the Ashfield Keeper however he failed to hold onto the shot and as a `stramash` ensued Mark Fitzpatrick drilled the loose ball into the corner of the net to reduce the deficit. Ashfield 2 Newmains Utd 1. It was `game on `now and as the Referee brought proceedings to a close shortly after with the `field knowing they would have to work extremely hard in the second half.\n\n​\n\n​\n\nHT:- ASHFIELD 2 NEWMAINS UTD 1\n\n​\n\nThe home side started the half well with Chris McLaughlin linking up well with the front two and also Baz Hepburn was beginning to get some joy down the left hand side delivering a number of crosses into the box. Newmains were also pushing forward at every opportunity with the `field having a scare on the hour mark with the ball being cleared off the line following a corner however it was from a Newmains attack that the home side increased their lead. After breaking a Newmains attack down Chris McLaughlin played a lovely through ball to Brad Rodden who evaded the tight offside trap which the visitors had been adopting and drove in on goal glidding past the Newmains Keeper and drilling the ball into the net from a narrow angle. An excellent finish. Ashfield 3 Newmains United 1. The game then swung from end to end and after picking up a loose ball on the edge of the box, a Newmains midfielder lashed the ball goalwards only to see it crash down off the underside of the bar as the ball was cleared to safety. Shortly after and it was `game over`. Chris McLaughlin picked up the ball just inside the Newmains half and after evading a number of tackles cut in and made room for himself before despatching a low shot in at the Keepers near post to the delight of the Players, fans and Management. An excellent solo goal Chris. Ashfield 4 Newmains United 1. Ashfield began to turn on the style and after making a couple of substitutes went further ahead following the introduction of the pacey youngster Nicky McLaughlin. The young winger picked up a through ball with 10 minutes to go and as the Newmains Keeper advanced he placed the ball underneath him and into the net for his first Ashfield goal. Ashfield 5 Newmains Utd 1. The home support were still celebrating when the visitors from kick-off broke down the right hand side before Jamie Henderson drilled a 22 yard shot into the far corner of McGuire`s net to reduce the deficit. Ashfield 5 Newmains United 2. Certainly the crowd were getting their money`s worth as shortly after Baz Hepburn picked up the ball on the left before finding an onrushing Nicky McLaughlin at the far post with the young winger finishing with aplomb with a shot inside the near post. Ashfield 6 Newmains United 2. The game continued to ebb and flow and chances were had however there were no more scoring and this victory was a welcome one for the `field ahead of their League Match at Carluke Rovers on Wednesday night and the First Round Scottish Junior Cup tie next Saturday at home to Islavale next Saturday.\n\n​\n\nFT:- ASHFIELD 6 NEWMAINS UTD 2\n\n​\n\n​\n\nAshfield`s Team - T McGuire, J Crumlish, B Daly, A Cairns, S Doherty, M McManus, D Maguire, R McManus, B Rodden, C McLaughlin and B Hepburn.

An excellent and versatile performance in Midfield winning most of the 50/50`s and linking up well with the front three and capped it off with a wonderful solo goal.\n\n​\n\nAttendance:- 70\n\n​\n\n​\n\nCarluke Rovers 2 Ashfield 3, John Cumming Stadium, Carluke - West of Scotland League - Conference B - Wednesday 18th August 2021 - Kick Off 8.30pm\n\nThe light was beginning to fade as both teams headed onto the 4G pitch at the John Cumming Stadium with both teams determined to take the valuable League points at stake. The 8.30pm Kick-Off seemed to effect the size of the gate as both teams started the Match wearing their traditional strips as the game started off at a frenetic pace. The No 10 trialist for Carluke was looking lively in the early stages and tested McGuire in the Ashfield goal within the first two minutes with a left foot drive. Next up it was Ashfield who foraged forward and a lovely move down the left flank saw Baz Hepburn cut in and drive the ball off the base of the post with the ball eventually being scrambled to safety. A tremendous effort which I think was touched onto the post by the Rovers Keeper. The game went from end to end however it was the home side that were carving out the best of the chances with the Rovers No 7 causing problems. In the 7th minute a shot from the Rovers winger brought out a good save from McGuire and a couple of cross balls caused alarm in the Ashfield back four and from a corner the ball broke to the No 10 for Carluke who picked up the 2nd ball from a header before lashing the ball high past McGuire to the delight of the home support. A good finish however a soft goal to lose from an Ashfield point of view. Carluke Rovers 1 Ashfield 0. The `field set up a chance for Ben Daily shortly after however the Ashfield strikers effort was saved by the Rovers Keeper. Carluke were adopting a tight offside trap and Ashfield`s front three were caught out on a number of occasions , some were very tight decisions indeed . In the 16th Minute the visitors had it all to do as the No 10 again for Rovers drilled a shot which was well saved by McGuire however the ball broke out to the edge of the six yard box and from an acute angle the Rovers No 9 clipped the ball into the net to put the home side 2-0 up. Carluke Rovers 2 Ashfield 0. This was a real blow for Ashfield however within 30 seconds they had pulled a goal back as a lovely through ball saw Ryan McManus break clear of his markers and lobbed the ball over the advancing Keeper to bring Ashfield back in it. Carluke Rovers 2 Ashfield 1. It was `game on` again and Ashfield had a good spell of concerted pressure. Ashfield almost levelled the Match with a headed opportunity before Brad Rodden almost broke through on the right hand side with his shot being blocked however on the half hour mark, Ashfield pulled level , again from Ryan McManus who found room outside the box and drove a terrific right foot shot past the arms of the Carluke Keeper to square the Match. Carluke Rovers 2 Ashfield 2. It was end to end stuff for the remainder of the half with both Managers going in at the break slightly concerned at the amount of chances given to the opposition.\n\n​\n\n​\n\nHT:- CARLUKE ROVERS 2 ASHFIELD 2\n\n​\n\nThe second half did not live up to the excitement of the first half until the latter stages of the Match when both teams had a real `go` at each other. Before that the game became rather bogged down in Midfield with a lot of injuries stopping the flow of the Match. Chances were also at a premium with defences more in control this half. The home side were given a scare with 20 minutes to go when the Keeper picked up a pass-back however as usually is the case the effort from 10 yards out was blocked by a host of defenders. As the game approached the last 5 minutes, Carluke managed to carve out an opening which saw a deflected effort miss McGuire`s post by inches.The `field then had a couple of corners which caused alarm however as the game went into injury time the `field were given one last chance following the awarding of a corner kick. The ball was whipped in at great pace and it was Sean Doherty who managed to glance a header into the top corner of the net to spark celebrations amongst the players, management and supporters of Ashfield as the home side had barely time to centre the ball before the Referee brought proceedings to a close. Carluke Rovers 2 Ashfield 3. It is never easy to lose a goal in injury time however this has happened to the `field twice this season at home to Glasgow United and Greenock respectively. The Conference B League is put into storage for Carluke and Ashfield this coming Saturday as both teams welcome Teams from the North Region with the Rovers welcoming Aberdeen Sunnybank and Ashfield welcoming Islavale from Keith.\n\n​\n\n​\n\nFT:- CARLUKE ROVERS 2 ASHFIELD 3\n\n​\n\nAshfield`s Team:- T McGuire, J Marr, A Cairns, S Doherty, J Crumlish, J Howat, B Hepburn, C McLaughlin, B Daily, R McManus and B Rodden. Subs:- J Barr, B Quate (GK), D Maguire, C Leverage, D Leverage, N McLaughlin and Mark McManus\n\n​\n\nMan of the Match:- Some excellent performances for the `field this evening against difficult and dangerous opponents, however Sean Doherty hardly put a foot wrong all night culminating in the 90th minute winner.\n\n​\n\nAttendance:- 40\n\n​\n\nAshfield 5 Islavale 0, Macron Scottish Junior Cup First Round - K.O. 2.30pm - Saturday 21st August 2021 - Peugeot Ashfield Stadium\n\nThis is the third time in the last three Scottish Junior Cup draws that Ashfield have drawn North Region opposition in the First Round. Visits to Aberdeen Sunnybank and Colony Park in Inverurie resulted in good victories for the `field (6-1 & 6-3 respectively) and this time Islavale from Keith were warmly welcomed. The only history between the Clubs was the recent Goalkeeper link of Cammy Farquhar who spent over a season at Saracen Park from Islavale. Cammy now plys his trade at Newmains United.\n\nBoth teams were sporting their traditional strips as the Referee got things underway and from early on it was evident the `field were playing with confidence from their recent string of results stretching the North Region side in the early stages however found the `vale Keeper in excellent form. The `field had made a number of changes to personnel due to injuries and the recent toll of games and the Leverage brothers were foraging forward at every opportunity on the flanks and the pace of Daily and Rodden up front causing the `vale defence problems. It took until the 18th minute before the `field make the breakthrough with Baz Hepburn getting on the end of a low driven ball across the six yard line. Ashfield 1 Islavale 0. The visitors then made a real `go` of it working tremendously hard in Midfield with the `field being unable to stretch their lead. Colin Leverage on the right was the instigator of many of the attacks and on the 37th Minute the ball was played through to young Nicky McLaughlin who in turn played in Brad Rodden who rounded the Keeper and cut the ball back for Nicky McLaughlin to get a touch ahead of a number of defenders to put the `field 2-0 up. Ashfield 2 Islavale 0. Ben Daily should have made it three before the interval when he was put through and despite the Keeper tipping the ball over it was debatable if the effort would have gone in following a deflection. As the rain continued to fall in North Glasgow, the Referee brought proceedings to a close.\n\n​\n\nHT:- ASHFIELD 2 ISLAVALE 0\n\n​\n\n​\n\nThe second half was rather more one sided with the `field turning on the screw early on with wave after wave of attacks. To the `vale`s credit they defended well and the Keeper had a number of excellent saves before Ashfield increased their lead further on the hour mark. A lovely whipped in corner from Brad Rodden on the right found the head of John Barr and the big Ashfield Central Defender`s header gave the Keeper no chance. Ashfield 3 Islavale 0. Darren Macguire was also linking up well playing slightly ahead of Midfield and he got his reward for a very good performance by picking up a loose ball on the edge of the box on the 70th Minute before firing the ball into the top corner of the net to the delight of the home support. Ashfield 4 Islavale 0. The `field went in search of further goals and made a couple of substitutions. A couple of great saves from the `vale keeper firstly from a Baz Hepburn Free-Kick and then a tip round the post from a left footed drive from Ben Daily. Ben Daily had been everywhere on the Pitch in search of a goal and had come close on many occasions however the Ashfield Centre eventually got his name on the scoresheet and it was worth waiting for. A tremendous delivery from the right hand side by Colin Leverage sailed over the Islavale defence and was met by Ben Daily who`s diving header bulleted into the far corner of the net to put the `field 5-0 up. Ashfield 5 Islavale 0. The match was played out in good spirits and the Referee did not have to produce a Card during the Match. A good performance from Ashfield who never really let Islavale into the game at all and the 2nd Round Draw is a tricky one away to our old friends St Anthony`s in Govan.\n\n​\n\n​\n\nFT:- ASHFIELD 5 ISLAVALE 0\n\n​\n\nAshfield`s Team - T McGuire, C Leverage, D Leverage, J Marr, J Barr, M McManus, B Hepburn, D Macguire, B Daily, B Rodden and N McLaughlin. Subs:- S Doherty, A Cairns, D Burns, B Quate, J Crumlish, A Byrne and J Howat.\n\n​\n\nMan of the Match:-Ben Daily and Brad Rodden terrorised the Islavale defence throughout the 90 minutes however Colin Leverage won every ball today and started many attacks so edges the award this week.\n\n​\n\nAttendance:-73\n\nRoyal Albert 0 Ashfield 4 - Saturday 28th August 2021 - K.O. 2pm - West of Scotland League - Conference B - Tilework Park, Stonehouse, Lanarkshire.\n\nThe usual football `jargon` could be attributed to this Conference B Fixture - `a game of two halves` however there is probably not any other way to describe this game. The visitors were terrific in the first half , pacy and full of good inventive attacking football and how they only went in 2-0 up at half time left the crowd rather bemused, as it was a different game in the second half as the home side really `rolled up their sleeves` and it wasn`t until some second half substitutes were made that the `field managed to get control of the game again.\n\nAshfield graced the Tilework Park surface wearing their away strip of Red and Grey and the crowd were still drifting into the ground when the `field scored in 10 seconds. A ball was played across the park by an Albert defender and was intercepted by Brad Rodden who drove in on goal and as the Albert Keeper narrowed the angle, Brad `dinked` the ball over him and into the corner of the net to put the `field ahead. Royal Albert 0 Ashfield 1. The home side looked rather `shell shocked` as the visitors lay siege on the Albert goal for the next 30 mins. Shortly after a 25 yard curler shot crashed off the bar before the Albert Keeper brought off a host of saves from Ben Daily and Baz Hepburn. On the 20th minute a sweeping move down the right, following an Albert forage up the field, saw Jonny Howat break clear of his marker before playing the ball across the goal with no takers. Brad Rodden`s pace was causing the home side`s defence a problem and the Ashfield forward broke free of the defence before rounding the Keeper and cutting the ball back to Baz Hepburn who perhaps had too much time before the Keeper blocked his net bound effort from 8 yards with this foot. It wasn`t too much longer before Ashfield increased their lead. A driving run down the left from Dean Leverage found the ball being delivered with pace to the far post finding Brad Rodden who bulleted a diving header into the back of the net for his 9th goal of the season and giving the Keeper no chance. Royal Albert 0 Ashfield 2. The same pattern followed for the remainder of the half with the Albert side trying to make progress towards Ben Quate`s goal but were hit on the counter attack with pace from the visitors.\n\n​\n\n​\n\nHT:- ROYAL ALBERT 0 ASHFIELD 2\n\n​\n\nA few tactical changes were made to the home side and all of a sudden there was no space in the midfield area with the `field struggling to assert themselves. The temperature also rose in the game too which matched the weather with the Referee kept busy with the dishing out of a number of yellow cards, some merited and some not. Chances were at a premium for both teams however as the half wore on the home side started getting some success from corner kicks and throw in`s into the box. John Barr & Sean Doherty were excellent throughout however & had to deal with a few `stramash`s`in the box before clearing the ball. The best chance for the Albert fell to their No 9 who managed to find space inside the box from a corner however his header flew by the post. The visitors made their full allocation of substitutes shortly after and all of a sudden the `field began to start making the chances again. Ryan McManus returning from injury was bringing people into the game with his hold up play and Darren Burns and Baz Hepburn had a couple of efforts well saved by the Albert Keeper. Darren Macguire almost weaved his way into a goal scoring position before being denied with a last gasp tackle however in the 81st Minute the game was over when Colin Leverage delivered a wicked cross from the right only to see the ball cannon off an Albert defender and into the corner of the net. Royal Albert 0 Ashfield 3. As the game approached `time up` the `field had one last chance and a lovely move saw the ball played through to Ryan McManus who evaded the offside trap before placing the ball into the corner of the net to the delight of the Ashfield Management and support. Royal Albert 0 Ashfield 4. An excellent finish and a good result for the `field which hoists them further up the table . The `field now have three home games ( 2 League and 1 Cup) before heading off on their travels to St Anthony`s on the 25th September in the 2nd Round of the Scottish Cup.\n\n​\n\nFT:- ROYAL ALBERT 0 ASHFIELD 4\n\n​\n\n​\n\nAshfield`s Team - B Quate, C Leverage, D Leverage, J Barr, S Doherty, J Howat, B Hepburn, D Burns, B Daily, J Crumlish and B Rodden. Subs:- M McManus, D Maguire, R McManus, N McLaughlin, A Cairns, C Beedham and J Marr.\n\n​\n\nMan of the Match:- A tremendous first half from Ashfield and only scoring two was to hinder them later in the game.Some notable performances from Brad Rodden & Ben Daily for the first 30 minutes & the back four did not give anything away however Jack Crumlish & Darren Burns bossed the Midfield throughout the game with Jack also contributing late on with some tremendous tackling.\n\n​\n\nAttendance:- 50\n\n​\n\nPhotographs by:- Inga\n\nAshfield 2 Thorniewood United 4, Peugeot Ashfield Stadium - 2pm KO. West of Scotland League - Conference B\n\nA `big game` yesterday between two teams who have made a good start to the Season and only a point separated them. The `field were hoping to make it 4 League wins in a row whilst the visitors were looking to `bounce`back from defeat at the hands of Glasgow United last week. It was the home side that made the `dream start` again following last week`s goal in 10 secs, this time it took a little longer - 1 minute and 52 seconds to be precise when Dean Leverage was played in on the edge of the box and after evading a tackle drove the ball goalwards only to see the Keeper block his initial shot however `Deano` followed up steering the ball into the far corner of the net. Ashfield 1 Thorniewood Utd 0. A great start and it took the visitors a while to properly `find their feet`. Next chance fell to Ben Daily when Ashfield were awarded a free kick on the edge of the box. Ben took the kick and missed the far upright by inches. The Midfield area was extremely competitive and the game began to swing from one end to another. Thorniewood looked dangerous coming forward and the Ashfield back three had to be on their toes together with young Ben Quate in goals. The visitors began to find some space coming forward and after a couple of corners drew level on the 26th minute . There was a shout for a penalty as John Barr tussled with the `wood forward however the ball broke out to the left half Small who took one stride forward before lashing the ball in at Ben Quate`s near post to level the game. Ashfield 1 Thorniewood Utd 1. Both teams pushed forward at every opportunity and were probably slightly guilty of playing the long ball in the tight confines of Saracen Park and as Referee Douglas brought proceedings to a halt both sets of fans knew that there would be more talking points in the second half.\n\n​\n\n​\n\nHT:- ASHFIELD 1 THORNIEWOOD UTD 1\n\n​\n\nThe second half started the same way as the first however this time it was Thorniewood that were on the `front foot` and lay siege on the Ashfield goal for the first 10 minutes of the half and by that time found themselves 3-1 ahead. For some reason it took Ashfield a while to start getting their passing game into gear with moves breaking down as a result of good play from the visitors . In the 51st Minute a guided pass into the box found Brown free of his marker and the `wood striker drove the ball with pace into the far corner of the net to the delight of the travelling support. Ashfield 1 Thorniewood Utd 2. Ashfield tried to get back into the game but found openings difficult and in the 55th Minute a lovely breakaway from Thorniewood resulted in the ball being cut back from the bye line to the onrushing Brown who netted his 2nd within five minutes. Ashfield 1 Thorniewood United 3. It was `game on` after this as Ashfield certainly rolled up their sleeves in a bid to salvage the Match. A terrific move on the hour mark should have brought a goal when Brad Rodden cut the ball back to Ben Daily who was lurking around the penalty spot however the Ashfield Centre failed to make proper contact and the Keeper gathered well. A number of half chances fell Ashfield`s way however the back two of Thorniewood were commanding in the air. Both teams made a number of substitutes and as the game went into the latter period, Ashfield pulled back a goal which was similar to one from last week with the ball being driven in from the right and was met by an unfortunate `wood defender who steered the ball past his own keeper to ensure a nail biting finish. Ashfield 2 Thorniewood Utd 3. Try as they did chances were at a premium for the home side and the `wood defended well and were dangerous on the break. Centre Half Sean Doherty went up front for Ashfield to try and win our share of headers and this he did without troubling the Wood Keeper and just as the home support thought that they might nick a last minute equaliser it was the visitors who broke and from a suspiciously looking offside position Bowie was played through one on one with Ben Quate on the 90th Minute and as the Keeper advanced Bowie drilled the ball low and hard and into the back of the net to spark wild celebrations on the visitors bench. Ashfield 2 Thorniewood United 4. Ashfield should have pulled a goal back virtually straight from kick off when the ball was cut back into Sean Doherty`s path however his effort from 12 yards out sailed over the bar to sum up Ashfield`s day. A bad defeat for Ashfield however credit goes to Thorniewood for some clinical finishing and good defending.\n\n​\n\nFT:- ASHFIELD 2 THORNIEWOOD UTD 4\n\n​\n\nAshfield`s Team:- B Quate, C Leverage, D Leverage, J Barr, S Doherty, J Marr, D Maguire, J Crumlish, B Daily, D Burns and B Rodden. Subs:- R Dakhill, M McManus, B Daly, J Howat, C Beedham, and J Dixon.\n\n​\n\nMan of the Match:- A disappointing result for the `field and halts a good run of results. A victory would have hoisted Ashfield into 4th place and they made a dream start yesterday. A difficult decision this week however Darren Maguire kept on pushing the `field forward at every opportunity.\n\n​\n\nAttendance:- 58\n\n​\n\nAshfield 4 Greenock 6 , South Challenge Cup 1st Round - Peugeot Ashfield Stadium - Saturday 11th September 2021 - Kick -Off 2pm.\n\nA welcome break from the intensity of the current Conference B West of Scotland League as Ashfield welcomed Greenock to the Peugeot Ashfield Stadium on Cup Duty. Both teams have made good starts to the Season and if Ashfield had not lost their first home League game of the Season last week they would have joined Greenock in 4th place. On to today`s encounter and both teams were taking the game seriously fielding full strength teams albeit the home side had a number of injuries which gave Paul Maxwell the chance to name three of the Ashfield U20`s Team that have been performing well.\n\nThe game started openly as in the previous encounter between the Teams a few weeks ago and although it was the home side that started the brightest they found themselves a goal down on 12 Minutes following a corner kick with the `nock defender reacting quicker to the second ball. Ashfield 0 Greenock 1. The Ashfield front three continued to look lively with the visitors breaking quickly also in what was an entertaining opening. Ashfield pulled themselves level just before the half hour mark following a lovely move which saw Ryan McManus find some room in the box before deftly flicking the ball into the far corner of the net. Ashfield 1 Greenock 1. More was to come from Ryan and as the game approached half time, which had seen an upturn in hefty challenges, Ryan picked up the ball on the edge of the box before taking a stride forward and unleashing an unstoppable drive into the corner of the net to the delight of the home support. An excellent finish ! Ashfield 2 Greenock 1. Tempers flared shortly after following a dreadful tackle on James Marr and the ensuing `melee`saw Referee Craven book a further 2 players to add to his growing list and as the Referee blew for Half time you knew that there was going to be more twists and turns before the 90 minutes were played.\n\n​\n\nHT:- ASHFIELD 2 GREENOCK 1\n\n​\n\nIt was important for the home side to keep things tight in the early part of the second half and as the crowd were finding their seats for the half and the catering queue had subsided the `field again conceded a soft goal from a corner kick, with again opponents not being picked up. Ashfield 2 Greenock 2. It was `game on` again as both teams had a real go at each other for the remainder of the Match. The visitors, buoyed by the equaliser, were on top in the early stages with the `field unable to hold things up front and the traffic was all down towards the Springburn end of the ground however as the visitors applied the pressure it was Ashfield that took the lead in the 66th Minute. Darren Burns took the initiative, linking up with Brogan Daly, before evading a number of defenders on the left wing with the Ashfield midfielder then drilling the ball towards the Greenock Keeper`s front post however his cross was not gathered properly by the `nock Keeper as he allowed the ball to squirm under his body and into the net. Ashfield 3 Greenock 2. A period of consolidation was required for the home side however within 5 minutes their lead evaporated following an own goal. A lovely cross field pass was played to the dangerous James Marks however before the prolific `nock Striker could receive the ball, Sean Doherty intercepted the pass at full stretch diverting the ball past McGuire in the Ashfield goal to level the scores. Ashfield 3 Greenock 3. The next period of the game saw the `field capitulate with some dreadful defending and Goalkeeping to completely lose a grip of the Cup tie. This was not before an excellent chance fell to Brad Rodden however his powerful shot grazed the outside of the post. Greenock`s 4th Goal followed a bad error from the Ashfield Keeper who thought the ball was going out for a bye kick only to see the `nock forward nip in and steer the ball into the far corner of the net. Ashfield 3 Greenock 4. A minute later and it was 5-3. A corner kick on the left was played to the Ashfield front post and was met by the smallest player on the park who guided his header into the roof of the net to the delight of the travelling support. Ashfield 3 Greenock 5. Ashfield made a couple of substitutions to try and salvage the tie and were unlucky when a lovely move on the left found the stretched leg of young Nicholas Dickson who knocked the ball just over the cross bar. The visitors next foray up the park resulted in the Greenock`s best goal of the day with the `nock No 6 picking the ball up 25 yards out and curling a left foot shot into the top corner of the net leaving McGuire with no chance. Ashfield 3 Greenock 6. A bizarre moment happened with 5 minutes to go - as the ball was cleared from well inside the visitors own half the clearance sailed over the Ashfield Keeper only for the ball to cannon off the post, trickle along the goal line and hit the other post and stay out. As it was the `field kept plugging away and on the 89th Minute Ryan McManus picked up the ball on the edge of the box and after evading a couple of tackles drove the ball into the corner of the net despite the valiant attempt of the `nock Keeper to complete an impressive hat-trick. Ashfield 4 Greenock 6. The Referee brought proceedings to a close shortly after and Greenock will now go onto play Johnstone Burgh at Keanie Park in the 2nd Round. As for the `field they will need to work on why they have lost 10 goals in the last 2 home games before welcoming Port Glasgow in a crucial League encounter next Saturday.\n\n​\n\n​\n\nFT:- ASHFIELD 4 GREENOCK 6\n\n​\n\nAshfield`s Team:- T McGuire, J Marr, J Barr, S Doherty, J Howat, B Daly, B Rodden, D Burns, B Daily, J Crumlish and R McManus. Subs:- D Leverage, B Quate (GK), D Maguire, JP Newton, G CHalmers, and N Dickson.\n\n​\n\nMan of the Match:- Ryan McManus produced a terrific all round display both up front and helping out his defence at set-piece`s going onto complete a hat-trick.\n\n​\n\nAttendance:-55\n\n​\n\nAshfield 6 Port Glasgow 1 - West of Scotland League - Conference B - Saturday 18th September 2021 - Kick-Off 2pm.\n\nIt had been a good number of Seasons since both teams had `locked horns`, when over a decade ago they were regularly competing with each other for the Central Division title with Port and Ashfield gaining promotions within a year of each other. At start of play today only three points separated the sides and a close encounter was expected based on current form however that went `out the window` as the home side blew the visitors away in the first 26 minutes with the `field then 4-0 ahead.\n\nAs the crowd were still coming into the Ground, some nice passing play in midfield found Jack Crumlish gain a couple of yards and as the Ashfield midfielder strode forward he unleashed a shot from 22 yards which flew past the Port Keeper to put the `field ahead. Ashfield 1 Port Glasgow 0 . The joy was there to see from Jack & his team mates as he celebrated his first goal of the Season. Ashfield had brought in a `trialist` goalkeeper and he was tested early on as the visitors tried to hit back however in the 10th Minute a ball was played through the Port defence which the Port Keeper seemed to gather however lost control and Darren Maguire was quick to pounce and steered the ball into the empty net to the delight of the home support. Ashfield 2 Port Glasgow 0. Worse was to follow for the visitors when a lovely move down the right by Ashfield saw the ball whipped across the 6 yard line and was diverted past his own Goalkeeper by the Port Centre Half. Ashfield 3 Port Glasgow 0. Ashfield had their `tails up` and were swarming forward at every opportunity and before the half hour mark a long throw from Dean Leverage was met by the head of Ryan McManus who guided his header into the far corner of the net to increase the home side`s lead. Ashfield 4 Port Glasgow 0. The visitors tried in vain during the next 15 minutes to try and salvage something from the first half and had a number of free-kicks in good positions however their attempts did not trouble the Ashfield Keeper with the home side coming close before the interval when a Ryan McManus shot cannoned off the crossbar and as Referee Jim Burns brought proceedings to a close it was a long way back for the visitors to salvage something from the Match.\n\n​\n\nHT:- ASHFIELD 4 PORT GLASGOW 0\n\n​\n\nSunshine greeted the players back onto the park and the second half started in a real competitive fashion with both teams surging forward at every opportunity and just as the visitors were beginning to put Ashfield under pressure, the home side went further ahead on the 51st Minute in what was a terrific goal from Ashfield. Lovely link up play between Dean Leverage and Chris McLaughlin who threaded the ball through to Ryan McManus and from 22 yards out the Ashfield Centre made space for himself before drilling an unstoppable drive past the Port Keeper to increase the `field`s lead. Ashfield 5 Port Glasgow 0. Chances became few and far between and both teams made a number of substitutions in the September heat. The `undertakers`had a spell of pressure which was well dealt with by Sean Doherty and his defenders however with 20 minutes to go a cross from Coyle to the far post saw the Port Centre `ghost` in and his diving header found the corner of the net. Ashfield 5 Port Glasgow 1. The visitors threw players forward at every opportunity and were playing a tight offside trap at the back which had caught out the Ashfield forwards on a number of occasions however with 9 minutes on the clock, Darren Maguire broke through one on one with the Keeper however as he advanced he was upended in the box with Referee Burns having no hesitation in pointing to the spot. Ryan McManus took the penalty drilling the ball into the net to complete his 2nd Hat-trick in two weeks - a great achievement. Ashfield 6 Port Glasgow 1. That was the end of the scoring and this result hoist`s the `field up to 7th with a game in hand on most teams above . A very good performance from Ashfield who played extremely well - It`s on to Scottish Cup 2nd Round action next week when the `field make the short trip over to Govan to meet St Anthony`s in what will be a tough match.\n\n​\n\n​\n\nFT:- ASHFIELD 6 PORT GLASGOW 1\n\n​\n\nAshfield`s Team:- Trialist, J Marr, J Barr, S Doherty, C Leverage (Capt), B Daly, D Leverage, C McLaughlin, D Maguire, J Crumlish and R McManus Subs:- D Burns, R McLean (GK), S Flanagan, Trialist, M McManus, B Daily and Trialist.\n\n​\n\nMan of the Match:- Ashfield were good today and up against a team that had been on excellent form however the `field swept the visitors aside with a whirlwind start. Some excellent hold up play coupled with a superb hat-trick for the 2nd week running earns Ryan McManus the award.\n\n​\n\nAttendance: 50\n\n​\n\nVideo Coverage of Ashfield-Port Glasgow on attached Link - https://youtu.be/CW1ZU9-WOW0\n\nMany thanks again to Davie Brown\n\n​\n\nSt Anthony`s 1 Ashfield 1 (Ashfield won 4-2 on Penalties), McKenna Park, Govan, Glasgow - K.O. 2.30pm - Scottish Junior Cup 2nd Round\n\nA `muggy` afternoon greeted both Teams and supporters to McKenna Park, which must be one of the best playing surfaces in Non-League Football. A slightly disappointing size of Crowd for the 2nd Round of the Scottish Junior Cup as the `field not only changed to their away strip of Red and Grey but were also enforced to change the Team that played so well against Port Glasgow last week due to a number of injuries. Ashfield had their new signing James Gilmartin on the Bench who last played for the `field in the 2013-14 Season. The game started at a frantic pace and certainly had a `cup tie` feel to it with both sides not holding back and the Referee was kept busy in the early stages quelling some `over-enthusiastic` challenges. Chances were at a premium with the `field only playing with Ben Daily up front however this all changed in the 20th Minute when the home side were awarded a free kick 22 yards out. The Ants left back, who was very impressive throughout the Match, delivered a fierce shot which was punched clear by Chris Prior in the Ashfield goal to the edge of the box however the ball was picked up by Martin Mulraney who drilled a left foot shot through a ruck of players and into the corner of the net to the delight of the home support. St Anthony`s 1 Ashfield 0. A blow for the `field and shortly after Ashfield`s right back John Marr pulled up and was replaced by a forward in James Gilmartin and suddenly the pendulum swung Ashfield`s way as the big Centre forward certainly made his presence felt initially getting involved in a number of challenges however looked dangerous and just after the half hour mark a lovely delivered corner saw Gilmartin outjump the Ants defence and bullet a header into the roof of the net to the delight of the Ashfield support. St Anthony`s 1 Ashfield 1. The game really opened up after this and both sides foraged forward at every opportunity and as the Referee brought proceedings to a close the crowd knew they were in for an interesting second half.\n\n​\n\nHT:- ST ANTHONY`S 1 ASHFIELD 1\n\n​\n\nThere were no changes to the personnel as the teams kicked off and it was the visitors that took control early on with a number of forays into the Ant`s box. The Ants defence stood resiliant though and kept chances to a minimum. Ashfield thought they had scored a second when Gilmartin was played through and his left foot shot hit the top corner of the net before the Referee chalked it off for hand ball. A `let off` for the Ants and the Ants Keeper had to perform heroics shortly after as the `field had a number of chances with Ben Daily wondering what he had to do to beat the Keeper. A good old `stramash` on the hour mark saw the ball blocked on the line by an Ants defender before being blocked again by the Keeper as the `field tried in vain to get ahead. Sean Doherty and his fellow defenders were keeping the lively Ants attack at bay during the second half and the home side were restricted to long range shots at this stage. As the Match went into the final stages you could see both teams were aware of the penalties looming and had a real go at each other. The Ants had a wonderful opportunity in the 82nd Minute when a lovely through ball saw the Ants forward get ahead of the Ashfield Keeper who forced the player wide however a lovely cut back to Evariste Ebembo saw his netbound effort headed off the line by John Barr to the relief of the travelling support. Ashfield forward Ben Daily was next up as he broke clear of the Ants defence however his shot was blocked by the legs of the impressive Ants Keeper. A full 5 minutes of injury time was played before the Referee brought the game to a halt and onto the `dreaded` penalties.\n\nAshfield went on to win the tie 4-2 on Penalties:-\n\n​\n\nSt Anthony`s Scorers:- Crawford and Mulraney\n\nAshfield Scorers:- Gilmartin, Burns, Barr and Daily\n\n​\n\n​\n\nFT:- ST ANTHONY`S 1 ASHFIELD 1 (Ashfield won 4-2 on Penalties)\n\n​\n\n​\n\nAshfield`s Team - C Prior, J Marr, J Barr, C Leverage, S Doherty, D Leverage, D Burns, C McLaughlin, B Daily, J Crumlish and B Daly. Subs:- T MacGuire (GK), J Gilmartin, J Howat, M McManus, S Bryson and A Byrne.\n\n​\n\nMan of the Match:- Some excellent performances for Ashfield today with special mention to Sean Doherty and Jack Crumlish however the Ashfield substitute James Gilmartin, making his first appearance for the Club since 2013-14 Season where he scored 7 goals, was tremendous, not only scoring the equaliser & converting one of the penalties but his overall play ensured he game the Ants defence a torrid afternoon.\n\n​\n\nAttendance:- 70\n\n​\n\nSt Cadoc`s 4 Ashfield 2 , West of Scotland League - Conference B - Saturday 2nd October 2021 - 2pm KO - McKenna Park, Govan, Glasgow.\n\nThis was the first ever meeting between the Teams and it was more than disappointing that the weather was horrendous before, during and after the Match. St Cadocs had made an excellent start to the League and were sitting proudly in 3rd Place having only lost one Match. The `field were pursuing 4th place and had a number of games `in hand` against the teams above. The Ashfield Management Team did not have the best of preparations due to a lengthy injury list , however they did have new signing James Gilmartin in the starting line up following his impressive display in the Cup victory last week.\n\nIt was the `field that started off the brightest and were foraging forward at every opportunity. Ryan McManus was holding the ball up well and in the 6th minute following some intricate play on the edge of the box the Ashfield striker broke free of his marker however his placed shot was blocked by the Cadocs Keeper. The ball did break out to the edge of the box where Gilmartin was first to react and his acrobatic volley crashed off the crossbar to the relief of the home support. Dean Leverage was having success down the left hand side and a couple of crosses just missed the Ashfield front two. The home side came into the Match after 15 minutes and some of their Midfield play was `easy on the eye` with Howat and Crumlish for Ashfield closing down where possible. The Match was pretty even at this stage however it suddenly changed following a wonderful delivery into the Ashfield box. Dykes picked the ball up midway inside the `field`s half and his curling cross evaded the Ashfield back two with Dallas bulleting a header past McGuire to put St Cadocs ahead. St Cadocs 1 Ashfield 0. A blow for Ashfield as they hadn`t done much wrong as they set about trying to get the equaliser. The home side were dangerous when Ashfield were on attack and Sean Doherty had to marshall his troops accordingly. Jim Gilmartin was making his presence felt again this week ably backed up Ryan McManus and a couple of shots from the Striker failed to trouble the Cadocs Keeper however on the half hour mark the ball broke to Gilmartin at the edge of the box and as he was about to be closed down the Ashfield striker took once stride forward and drove the ball low and hard into the back of the net to the delight of the rain soaked travelling fans. A great finish from Gilmartin. St Cadocs 1 Ashfield 1. The game swung from end to end with the Referee guilty of being rather `Card happy` when the game was played in good spirits. Ashfield were keen to keep things tight at the back however in the 39th minute went behind. A Corner on the left was whipped into virtually the 6 yard box with the Ashfield Keeper and defence being unable to stop the momentum of Dallas`s run as the Cadocs forward bundled the ball home to the delight of the home support. St Cadocs 2 Ashfield 1. A really disappointing goal from the `field`s point of view and you could see the home side gain confidence from this as they went into the Second half a goal ahead.\n\n​\n\nHT:- ST CADOC`S 2 ASHFIELD 1\n\n​\n\nThe home side were buoyed by scoring late on in the first half and started the half well without troubling the Ashfield Keeper too much. The Referee continued to upset both benches and both were given yellow cards for complaining about decisions. Just as it looked as if Ashfield had weathered the early storm, it was the home side that stretched their lead on the hour mark. Again the problems came from an inswinging corner which was only half cleared with the ball breaking out to Dallas who took one touch before lashing the ball high into the net to give the home side some breathing space now and at the same time complete his hat-trick. St Cadocs 3 Ashfield 1. Ashfield tried in vain to claw their way back into the game after that and as the half wore on gradually got their passing game back and played some nice football. With 20 minutes to go a lovely move saw the ball played through to Colin Leverage who had made a great run from the right hand side. The Ashfield Captain drove the ball with pace from 10 yards out only to see the ball brilliantly saved by McKinven in the St Cadocs goal. This would have set up a tremendous finish for the `field however it was the home side that went up the park and increased their lead. A shot from outside the box from the impressive Dykes took a deflection and fizzed into the far corner of the net to the anguish of the visitors. St Cadocs 4 Ashfield 1. This was now a harsh scoreline for the `field however to their credit they kept on pushing forward at every opportunity and substitute Ben Daily had a couple of efforts blocked before Ashfield pulled a goal back in the 88th minute. A curling corner kick delivered by Jack Crumlish saw Sean Doherty rise above the St Cadocs defence and his header across goal was swept into the net by Ryan McManus to reduce the deficit with his 14th Goal of the Season. St Cadocs 4 Ashfield 2. The Referee brought proceedings to a close shortly after what was an entertaining game despite the overhead conditions. The `field must `dust `themselves down now for the visit of Gartcairn next week to Saracen Park and will be hoping the injury crisis improves in early course.\n\n​\n\nFT:- ST CADOC`S 4 ASHFIELD 2\n\n​\n\nAshfield`s Team:- T McGuire, C Leverage, D Leverage, S Bryson, S Doherty, J Barr, J Howat, D Burns, J Gilmartin, J Crumlish and R McManus. Subs:- B Quate (GK), B Daily and A Byrne.\n\n​\n\nMan of the Match - Ryan McManus was exceptional today against a very good team with his overall hold up play, his goal and didn`t deserve to be on the losing side.\n\n​\n\nAttendance:- 80\n\nAshfield 2 Gartcairn 4, Peugeot Ashfield Stadium, Glasgow - Kick-Off 2pm. West of Scotland League - Conference B - Saturday 9th October 2021.\n\nThe Match had been in doubt yesterday Lunchtime however the lack of rain in the last 18 hours ensured the pitch recovered in time and the crowd were treated to an enthralling 90 minutes which swung from end to end. The home side will be disappointed again at not securing at least a point as Gartcairn ensured their unbeaten record remained intact at Saracen Park and made it 5 wins out of 5 in the League also.\n\n​\n\nA couple of changes to the `field`s line up with Ben Daily operating behind the front two worked well and within a minute of Kick-Off Ashfield were ahead. A long throw-in from Dean Leverage on the right hand side found the head of Defender Stephen Bryson and his header found the back of the net to put the `field 1-0 up. Ashfield 1 Gartcairn 0. The visitors were stung into action and had a number of corners which were well defended by Sean Doherty and his defenders. The `field were foraging forward at every opportunity and keen to extend their lead when an individual error wiped away the home side`s lead in the 22nd Minute. A poor kick-out by Quate in the Ashfield goal went straight to the Gartcairn No 9 McNeil and as he advanced in on goal he drove the ball striking the base of the post only to see the ball bounce back to Owen Ronald who guided the ball past a despairing John Barr on the goal line to level the scores. Ashfield 1 Gartcairn 1. The `field were still recovering from this set back when Gartcairn won the ball midway inside the Ashfield half and it was again Ross McNeil who drove into the box and was brought down by Stephen Bryson. The Referee had no hesitation in pointing to the spot despite the protests from the Ashfield players. There did seem minimal contact however the Referee had a better view than most at the game. Ross McNeil duly despatched the penalty however Ashfield`s keeper did get close to it and got something on it. Ashfield 1 Gartcairn 2. It was game on again for Ashfield to pick up where they had left off before their `daft` 5 minutes and to their credit the home side worked the flanks well and caused a lot of problems to the Gartcairn back four with set pieces and on the 38th minute they got their reward. A lovely corner from Ben Daily found the head of Sean Doherty and the big Ashfield Centre half bulleted in a header to level the scores. Ashfield 2 Gartcairn 2. The game ebbed and flowed right up until half time and the crowd knew that they would be in for an exciting 2nd period.\n\n​\n\nHT:- ASHFIELD 2 GARTCAIRN 2\n\n​\n\nThe second half carried on in the same fashion as the first with both sides pushing forward at every opportunity. Chances were less prevalent and the heavy underfoot conditions did take it`s toll as the half wore on. Ashfield were enjoying success down the left flank with Dean Leverage sending over some dangerous crosses and also the wide players for Gartcairn were also looking dangerous. On the hour mark a lovely move inside the box for the home side saw the ball break to Ryan McManus however his left foot drive was brilliantly saved by the Gartcairn Keeper. Next up it was the visitors who scorned an opportunity as Ross McNeil found space for himself on the left hand side of the box before drilling a shot inches wide to the relief of the home support. The relief was only short lived and with 22 minutes left on the clock it was the visitors that made the all important breakthrough and again it was a goal from the home side`s perspective that should have been avoided. A long ball was played up the park and as the Ashfield Keeper hesitated the Gartcairn winger nipped ahead and was sent crashing to the ground by the Keeper. The Referee has one of his easier decisions of the day as Ross McNeil took the penalty kick and finished with aplomb to put the visitors ahead. Ashfield 2 Gartcairn 3. Ashfield brought on Baz Hepburn shortly after and his pace and crossing ability were certainly causing alarm in the visitors defence. From another long throw, Sean Doherty almost got his 2nd of the day when his net-bound header was cleared off the line followed up by a couple of penalty appeals for the home side. The visiting defence stood firm and rubbed `salt in the wound` for the `field with a 90th minute goal following some neat play on the edge of the box. Ashfield 2 Gartcairn 4. There was barely time to centre the ball before Referee Murdoch brought proceedings to a close to the delight of the visiting fans. A `sore one` for Ashfield who put so much into the game and will play worse and win this Season. It`s another crucial League encounter next week as Ashfield welcome Royal Albert to North Glasgow.\n\n​\n\nFT:- ASHFIELD 2 GARTCAIRN 4\n\n​\n\nAshfield`s Team:- B Quate, C Leverage, D Leverage, S Bryson, S Doherty, J Barr, B Daily, J Crumlish, R McManus, J Gilmartin and J Howat. Subs:- B Rodden, M McManus, B Hepburn, A Byrne, D Burns and B Daly.\n\n​\n\nMan of the Match:- The `field put in a good shift today and were unlucky not to get something from the Match. Leading early on and level at 2-2 at the interval it was disappointing to lose the goals through individual errors. Sean Doherty pushed forward at every opportunity and although scoring once could have had more Sean edges the award this week.\n\n​\n\nAttendance:- 50\n\n​\n\nAshfield 6 Royal Albe"
