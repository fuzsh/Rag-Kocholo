        "text": "With the countdown to Euro 2024 well and truly on, could injuries impact who makes Scotland head coach Steve Clarke's final squad?\n\nIn recent weeks midfielder Lewis Ferguson was ruled out after undergoing surgery, Stuart Armstrong has been recovering from his season-ending injury at Southampton, Manchester United's Scott McTominay picked up a knock, plus defenders Nathan Patterson, Aaron Hickey, Grant Hanley and Kieran Tierney remain doubts.\n\nThe injuries will be a big blow for Clarke who is perhaps left with more decisions to make than he would have wanted at this stage of the season.\n\nEuro 2024 squads expanded to 26 players\n\nStream Premier League, Scottish Premiership & more with NOW\n\nAll you need to know - Streaming Sky Sports with NOW\n\nFollowing those friendly defeats in March, Scotland have just two more warm-up games - in June against Finland and Gibraltar - before their tournament opener against Germany.\n\nClarke has said the \"core squad\" from Scotland's successful qualification campaign \"deserve the chance to go to the Euros\" - meaning he will have some very tough decisions to make over the coming weeks.\n\nA total of 29 players featured across the eight Euro qualifiers. With 26 now allowed to board the plane to Germany, here is a look at who is in the mix...\n\nGordon to make remarkable return?\n\nNorwich goalkeeper Angus Gunn beat off competition from Hearts' Zander Clark and Motherwell's Liam Kelly for the No 1 jersey at the start of the qualification campaign.\n\nAfter pledging his allegiance to the nation - despite playing for England U21s - he took over from the injured Craig Gordon who had been recovering from a double leg break suffered in December 2022.\n\nHowever, at 41 years old, Gordon did return to the Scotland fold as one of four keepers for the March friendlies - although only three will head to Germany.\n\nAt club level, he is being kept out of action by Clark, but having recently played in the Scottish Premiership as well as four Scottish Cup matches - could the experienced stopper edge out others for a spot on the plane to Germany?\n\nWhile Gunn played in both friendlies - Clarke did run the rule over his other options during training and suggested not only game time will come into his decision.\n\n\"I'll assess everything I've got,\" said the Scotland boss. \"The make-up of the squad going into a tournament has other factors like squad stability and players who have been in the squad for a long time, so it's going to be a tough decision.\"\n\nWhat are the right-back options?\n\nClarke has been consistent in his back-line selections, with Hickey, Patterson, Ryan Porteous, Jack Hendry, Tierney and captain Andrew Robertson featuring in the most number of games.\n\nHanley, Liam Cooper, John Souttar, Scott McKenna, Dominic Hyam, Anthony Ralston and Greg Taylor all played at some point during the eight qualifiers too.\n\nHowever, injuries could play a part in Clarke's final picks - especially at right-back.\n\nEuro 2024 kits revealed\n\nGet Sky Sports | Download the Sky Sports App\n\nHickey missed the March camp due to a hamstring issue that has kept him out since last October and Brentford boss Thomas Frank us not positive the 21-year-old will win the race to be fit for Germany.\n\nPatterson would have likely started in his place but the Everton player needs surgery on a hamstring injury and is also a huge doubt for the Euros.\n\nCeltic's Anthony Ralston could be an option but is not first choice at his club. Elsewhere, ex-Aberdeen defender Ross McCrorie is impressing at Bristol City - could he earn a shock return?\n\nFormer Motherwell player Max Johnston is also doing well in Austria after joining Sturm Graz and was a substitute for last year's friendly against France.\n\nElsewhere, Hanley - who had been out for a year with an Achilles problem - withdrew from the March squad with an ankle problem and is in a race to prove his fitness.\n\nFerguson out, will Armstrong make it?\n\nMidfielders McGregor, John McGinn, McTominay and Ryan Christie featured in every Euro qualifier - a feat only matched by forward Lyndon Dykes - suggesting Clarke will be consistent with his approach in the middle.\n\nArmstrong (6), Kenny McLean (7) and Billy Gilmour (5) all featured regularly too and would be expected to board the plane to Germany.\n\nHowever, Lewis Ferguson will miss out. Having featured in three qualifiers and both March friendlies, the Bologna captain looked likely to be part of Clarke's plans.\n\nBut he has since had surgery after rupturing his anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), and with less than two months until that opening game against Germany, his hopes are over.\n\nArmstrong is also in a race to be fit after being stretchered off in Southampton's defeat to Cardiff City, however, club boss Russell Martin says the player still has a \"big chance\" of making it.\n\nElsewhere, Rangers' Ryan Jack looks set to miss out on another Euros. Like Ferguson, he played in three qualifiers but was injured for the March camp and missed the last Euros due to injury too.\n\nSky Sports pundit Kris Boyd said: \"Even if there were some dips with his regulars, I don't think Clarke would leave them out because he knows exactly what they can do when they come to camp.\n\n\"There might be the odd one who could force their way in but listening to Clarke, he spoke about the group, the unity and the togetherness of that squad.\n\n\"The nucleus of it won't change unless Steve Clarke can talk some of the English Premier League players to come out and play for Scotland, which is being spoken about.\"\n\nWill Shankland make Clarke's cut?\n\nAt the top end of the pitch Lyndon Dykes and Che Adams are almost guaranteed to be in the squad, but who else could join them?\n\nHaving scored 28 goals in all competitions, Hearts' Lawrence Shankland also netted during Scotland's draw in Georgia.\n\nScottish Premiership table | Fixtures | Results\n\nFree-to-watch Scottish Premiership highlights\n\nHe started in the Netherlands - hitting the bar in the second half - and came on against Northern Ireland. If he maintains his goalscoring form at club level - a place on that plane to Germany should be secured.\n\nHowever, the likes of Luton Town's Jacob Brown, Sheffield United's Oli McBurnie, and Millwall's Kevin Nisbet will also be looking to force their way into Clarke's plans.\n\nBoyd said: \"Che Adams is nailed on, Dykes has done really well for Scotland and you'd fancy him to go.\n\n\"Brown started against Norway and is probably the most similar to Che Adams in style. But for me, I'd have Lawrence Shankland on the flight all day long.\n\n\"You know if you create opportunities for him he'll score goals. There was nobody in that Scotland squad against Georgia who scores the header he scored.\"\n\nScotland's Euro 2024 warm-up matches\n\nJune 3: Gibraltar (n), friendly, kick-off 5pm\n\nJune 7: Finland (h), friendly, kick-off 7.45pm\n\nWho do Scotland face at Euro 2024?\n\nFollowing the final friendlies against Gibraltar and Finland, Scotland will head to their Euro 2024 base camp located in the Bavarian resort of Garmisch-Partenkirchen on June 9.\n\nClarke's side play the tournament's opening match against hosts Germany at the Allianz Arena on June 14.\n\nThe Scots also face games against perennial qualifiers Switzerland and Hungary, who reached the knockout stages in 2016.\n\nScotland's Euro 2024 fixtures and route\n\nEuro 2024: Dates, venue, schedule, teams\n\nScotland have history kicking off tournaments, having been drawn to face Brazil in the opener at World Cup 1998, a game they narrowly lost 2-1 to a second-half Tom Boyd own goal.\n\nThis time they begin at the Allianz Arena before facing Switzerland in Cologne on June 19, with Hungary awaiting in Stuttgart on June 23.\n\nHow to book Fury v Usyk on Sky Sports Box Office\n\nIt's one of the biggest sporting events in a generation.
