Ross Roy Collection of Burnsiana & Scottish Literature.\n\nFind out more about Robert's research on his Research Profile\n\nFind out more about Gerard's research on his Research Profile\n\n11 July 2024\n\nSarah Dunnigan (English Literature) has secured an award from the latest round of the CAHSS Knowledge Exchange and Impact Grant. ‘Nurture through Nature’ is a collaborative project between Edinburgh’s Museum of Childhood and the LLC English Literature research project SELCIE (‘Scotland’s Early Literature for Children Initiative’). Informed by Sarah's expertise in Scottish children’s literature and history of emotion studies, it explores historical and contemporary relationships between children’s literature, nature, and wellbeing in a co-curated exhibition drawn from the Museum of Childhood's books collection.\n\nThis CAHSS-funded project builds on Sarah's previous work on the SELCIE project, and follows on from two recent pilot workshops with the Museum of Childhood, which have both been supported by the LLC Impact Fund. The CAHSS funding will support several outreach activities throughout spring and summer 2025, including a horticultural therapy workshop, storytelling sessions, family art sessions, and a public-facing symposium raising awareness of neglected aspects of Edinburgh's green and cultural heritage. The funding will also support the creation of an illustrated children's map of Edinburgh's green spaces.\n\nFind out more about Sarah's research on her Research Profile\n\n2 July 2024\n\nLori Watson (Celtic and Scottish Studies) recently made a couple of TV and radio appearances, talking about her current research.\n\nTalkTV news chatted to Lori about the new music collection and archive that she is developing as part of her AHRC Research, Development and Engagement Fellowship.\n\nLori also recently presented an episode of BBC Radio 3's The Essay, which invites leading writers on arts, history, philosophy, science, religion and beyond to speak on themed issues across the week. In the last week of June, The Essay's theme was ‘Dig Where Your Stand’, with five musicians unearthing old tunes from around the country. Lori's episode features an alternative version of ‘Death in the Yarrow Valley’, sung by Margarate Laidlaw, mother of writer James Hogg. This ballad is one piece of the practice research on tradition and creativity from Lori's current project.\n\nFind out more about Lori's research on her Research Profile\n\n28 June 2024\n\nKatie Pleming (DELC, French), alongside Jasmine Cooper (Cambridge) and Lili Owen Rowlands (RHUL) co-edited and published a collection titled 'Rage: Affect and Resistance in French and Francophone Culture and Thought, 1960-2020,' as part of Peter Lang's Modern French Identities Series.\n\n\"This volume traces the various morphologies of anger across French-language literature, thought, cinema and activism. From Black feminisms to punk, flamboyance to suicide, cacophonous sound to riotous song, the contributions probe the aesthetics and politics of rage. This collection also examines the uneven legitimization of political anger – how rage is allowed to be expressed, by whom and in which contexts. Rage is often dismissed as inimical to proper academic inquiry: what unites the contributions in this publication is a commitment to thinking with feeling.\"\n\nFind out more about Katie's research on her Research Profile\n\n26 June 2024\n\nTerri Ochiagha (English Literature) has been awarded a British Academy Conference grant to host a conference on Chinua Achebe's work during her visiting fellowship at All Soul's College, Oxford, in July 2025.

This year, the MHRA were able to offer up to four Conference Grant awards and we are delighted that our colleagues from DELC have been awarded two of them!\n\nJose's conference 'Manuel Vázquez Montalbán beyond the page: Visuality, Graphic and Continuation Novels, TV series and beyond' represents the first international, interdisciplinary conference in Scotland dedicated to the work of the Spanish novelist, journalist, essayist, political commentator, gastronomist and poet Manuel Vázquez Montalbán focused on the posthumous adaptation and continuation of his writing. It will explore new approaches to his writing and the conversion of his novels, plays and essays into new formats such as graphic novels and continuation novels in order to provide novel insights to new generations of his readers.\n\nJenny's conference 'The “Holocaust by bullets” in Literature, Film and Visual Art' will bring together experts working in diverse fields to explore the potential advantages and implications of thinking about mass shootings as a distinct aspect of the Holocaust. It will also include a public-facing event targeted at teachers to explore the development of pedagogical approaches to integrating the phenomenon of mass shootings into existing secondary school curricula, as well as a free public screening of the short documentary film Beyond Babi Jar (2023) and Q&A with its director Eli Adler.\n\nFind out more about Jose's research on his Research Profile\n\nFind out more about Jenny's research on her Research Profile\n\n21 May 2024\n\nAndrew Newman (IMES) has published seven video interviews exploring the histories and lived experiences of a diverse cross-section of Scotland’s Shii community.\n\nAndrew's project 'Scottish Shii Voices' grew out of the RSE Research Networks in the Arts & Humanities project ‘The Unthought in Islam,’ which Andrew undertook alongside Lloyd Ridgeon (University of Glasgow) between 2016 and 2018. With further support from the Alwaleed Centre, Andrew endeavoured to share the lived experiences of Scottish Shi`a through a series of filmed personal interviews. He recorded these videos in late 2018 and, after facing several obstacles, has now been able to share them on his webpage ‘Shii News and Resources’.\n\nIn creating this unique online video resource, Andrew's project aims to promote a better understanding of Scotland’s Shi`a among the general non-Muslim public and among Scotland’s Sunni communities. The project offers an important platform for Scottish Shi`a to express their unique religious and cultural identities whilst simultaneously affirming and celebrating their Scottishness.\n\nFind out more about Andrew's research project on his Shii News and Resources webpage\n\n9 May 2024\n\nHannah Simpson (English Literature) has been awarded a Carnegie Trust Research Incentive Grant for her project ‘The Unexpected Dramatist: Modernism’s Forgotten Stage Plays.’\n\nThe Carnegie award comes on the heels of the Royal Society of Edinburgh (RSE) Small Research Grant awarded to Hannah earlier this year to support her work on her larger project, a monograph entitled 'The Unexpected Dramatist: Modernism’s Forgotten Stage Plays,' examining the plays of several major Anglophone modernists who are not typically considered playwrights.\n\nWhile the RSE award will enable Hannah to undertake archival research in the UK, the Carnegie award will give Hannah the opportunity to travel to several US cities to examine Virginia Woolf, E.M. Forster, F. Scott Fitzgerald, William Faulkner, Ernest Hemingway, James Joyce and Elizabeth Bowen’s theatre work through archival research.\n\nFind out more about Hannah's research on her Research Profile\n\n2 May 2024\n\nLast week's LLC-led impact event ‘Fast Forward: Creative Connections for Enduring Impact’ brought together fifteen artists joining from across the UK and twenty academics from several schools across CAHSS to explore options for collaboration.\n\nAfter an introductory session on impact and mutual expectations in collaboration, the day broke into facilitated themed workshop sessions. In each session, artists introduced their own work and how it related to the given theme, and there was space for academics and artists to connect and explore potential avenues for collaboration. The themes across the day included ‘The Anthropocene’, ‘AI and Human Futures’, ‘Gender’, ‘Race, Inequality and Decoloniality’, ‘Health and Wellbeing’ and ‘Science and Religion’.\n\nIn the afternoon we heard from colleagues in the Edinburgh Research Office and Edinburgh Innovations about some of the more practical considerations around pursuing collaborative projects. The day rounded off with more networking, and a chance for everyone to exchange contact details with those they had chatted with throughout the day. It was fantastic to see such in-depth conversation happening across all the themed sessions, with artists and academics alike commenting on how valuable this networking space was.\n\n30 April 2024\n\nKim Sherwood (English Literature) released the second installment of the Double O Trilogy, 'A Spy Like Me'. The novel sees a new generation of Double O agents racing to stop a series of terror attacks and to save 007.\n\nFind out more about Kim's research on her Research Profile\n\n30 April 2024\n\nLaura Bradley (DELC, German) featured alongside David Barnett (University of York) and Tom Kuhn (University of Oxford) in the latest episode of In Our Time (Radio 4), speaking to host Melvyn Bragg about Bertolt Brecht. They discussed the works and ideas of this great German playwright from the Weimar Republic to his exile under the Nazis and return to Berlin after World War Two.\n\nLaura is currently completing her third monograph, on Brecht and the Art of Spectatorship.

Ferran will be joining Asian Studies in the summer and working closely with Chris Perkins (Asian Studies), with support from David Sorfa (Film Studies), during this two year fellowship.\n\nCINETIVITY aims to promote scholars’ interest in and knowledge of the democratic process of post-war Japan as a universally relevant phenomenon by focusing on a key element in this historical experience: the debates that took place about how best to develop a form of political subjectivity or agency (shutaisei) in the people that would prevent individuals from being dragged into authoritarian regimes. CINETIVITY is expected to point out the value of the process whereby post-war Japanese intellectuals and filmmakers fostered democracy, thus inspiring the European civil society in an age like the present, when the memory of totalitarian regimes is gradually fading and authoritarian movements are gaining ground.\n\nFind out more about postdoctoral fellowship opportunities on our website\n\n11 April 2024\n\nJane McKie (English Literature) is mentoring Viccy Adams, the Story Associate on an exciting AHRC-funded pilot project 'StoryArcs,' which was developed by Bath Spa University and involves eleven Story Associates hosted by institutions across the UK seeking to uncover the deep structures and values of Story Skills.\n\nFollowing in the footsteps of pioneers such as Anne Druyan and Carl Sagan in their preparation of the golden record for Voyager, Viccy Adams will be building upon her existing expertise in creative engagement projects for the project collaborator Winged Chariot’s project, Message Space. Viccy will be gathering a wide variety of messages to send into space, inspiring members of the public to take part, and leading workshops exploring the myriad of ways to relay a message. What messages, stories, or tales of Earth today might we want to relay to future generations?\n\nPaying close attention to lessons acquired from these placements, the StoryArcs team will produce a prototype ‘Story Skill Set’, to exemplify how different story structures and competencies are used in life, learning and work. The StoryArcs team will then evaluate the pilot and develop an improved plan for an expanded scheme to support more Story Hosts and Associates. The scaled StoryArcs programme will enable AHRC to embed evidence about Story Skills into a network of training and placement partners.\n\nFind out more about StoryArcs on the project's website\n\n31 March 2024\n\nHannah Boast (English Literature) has been involved in a number of public events about Palestinian arts, culture and environment. In November, Hannah ran a reading group at Lighthouse Radical Book Fair about Adania Shibli’s novel 'Minor Detail' (Fitzcarraldo 2020, trans. by Elizabeth Jacquette) and wrote an accompanying article for The Conversation. In January, Hannah participated in a public online panel about Ecology and Culture in Palestine/Israel, attended by over 100 people from many different countries.\n\nMost recently, in March, Hannah delivered a public lecture and workshop on water, environment and culture for a Finland-based course called Learning Palestine, with 80 participants. Hannah will be hosting more events on Palestinian arts and culture this spring in Edinburgh with the community group Sumud.\n\nFind out more about Hannah's research on her Research Profile\n\n27 March 2024\n\nTerri Ochiagha (English Literature) has been awarded the prestigious McMillan-Stewart Fellowship at the Hutchins Center for African and African American Research, which is part of the Du Bois Research Institute at Harvard University.\n\nThe Hutchins Center is one of the most prestigious institutions in the fields of African and African American studies in the US and globally. Their W.E.B. Du Bois Fellowship Programme invites up to twenty scholars each year to conduct research in a wide variety of fields related to African and African American Studies. During her stay at Harvard, Terri will explore the Chinua Achebe papers held at Harvard University, visit nearby archives, and interview members of Achebe's family in order to gather information for the biography of Chinua Achebe, the acclaimed ‘father of modern African literature’ and one of the key literary figures of the twentieth century.\n\nFind out more about Terri's research on her Research Profile\n\n20 March 2024\n\nNicola Frith, Senior Lecturer in French and Francophone Studies, has secured an award from the latest round of the CAHSS Knowledge Exchange and Impact Grant for her project 'Doors of Return.'\n\nDoors of Return is a documentary set in the Republic of Benin, West Africa. It explores the ‘doors of return’ being opened by Benin’s traditional leaders to those in the African Diaspora, whose ancestors were deported and enslaved, and the importance of cultural/spiritual reconnection – or ‘rematriation’ – after centuries of separation.\n\nWith the film completed, this phase of funding from CAHSS will allow Nicki and the team to polish the content and make it ready for screening (reviewing sound, colour and transitions), and to finalize the subtitling to make it compliant with industry standards and accessible for those with hearing impairment. This will ensure that the film is ready for its first formal and international launch in Boston, USA. Nicki will be working alongside project partner Joyce Hope Scott (Boston University).\n\nFind out more about Nicola's research on her Research Profile\n\n20 March 2024\n\nHephzibah Israel, Senior Lecturer in Translation Studies, has secured an award from the latest round of the CAHSS Knowledge Exchange and Impact Grant for her project 'Living Between Languages.' This impact project builds on the opportunity presented by an invitation from Lancaster University to take Hephzibah’s poetry exhibition ‘மொழிபெயர்ப்பு/the nature of difference’ to Lancaster’s LitFest 2024.\n\nCollaborating with partners, Hephzibah and her Co-I Delphine Grass (Lancaster) are developing a set of workshops on writing and translation for refugee migrants housed in Lancaster city and Lancashire. The workshops offer an opportunity to empower migrants by foregrounding their skills as multilingual speakers rather than as passive recipients of the host-language. The sessions will also provide TESOL (Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages) teachers with new approaches to translation and ‘translanguaging’ as alternative world making in English-language classes, by addressing the dislocating processes of functional language acquisition.\n\nThe funding from CAHSS will support the costs of hosting two workshops, one for refugees in ESOL classes, and another for TESOL teachers. It will also support the costs of hosting the exhibition as part of Lancaster LitFest 2024.\n\nFind out more about Hephzibah's research on her Research Profile\n\n20 March 2024\n\nCharlotte Gleghorn, Senior Lecturer in Latin American Film Studies, has secured an award from the latest round of the CAHSS Knowledge Exchange and Impact Grant for her project 'Creole Connections'.\n\nCreole Connections – an interactive web platform hosting approximately forty thematised videos on issues of social, economic, political and linguistic importance for Raizal and Black Creole peoples – seeks to contribute to the reactivation of ancestral familial and cultural ties between these geographically dispersed and geopolitically frustrated communities.\n\nIn this latest phase of impact development, Charlotte and the project team will launch the platform with the island communities of San Andrés and Providence through a series of screenings and talkback sessions. In so doing, the team aims to support the revitalisation of the communities' shared seaspace – the maretorio – that they call home, thus confronting colonial dispossession, ecological damage, and the ideological fixities of the nation-state.\n\nCharlotte will be working alongside Co-I Julie Cupples (GeoSciences), and the wider project team includes Raquel Ribeiro (IHC, Lisbon), Raizal mediamaker Sergio Bent and journalist Neyda Dixon. The funding from CAHSS will support the costs of travel for members of the project team to San Andres and Providencia, and the costs of hosting the launch events in both locations.\n\nFind out more about Charlotte's research on her Research Profile\n\n19 March 2024\n\nSourit Bhattacharya (English Literature) has been awarded the Leverhulme Trust Research Fellowship for his project 'Remembering the 1943 Bengal Famine: Hunger, Arts, and Decolonisation'.\n\nSourit’s proposed monograph will be the first comprehensive study of the cultural history of the 1943 Bengal famine. Breaking out during the Second World War and the anticolonial Quit India agitations, the famine killed and displaced millions, and made mass death an everyday occasion in Calcutta. The devastating social conditions of this period gave birth to a significant moment of intrepid journalism and arts-based activism, which used hunger as a means to mobilise support for the struggle for decolonisation. This book project, under contract with Cambridge University Press, will address the extent, diversity, and importance of artistic works in memorialising this enormous event in modern Indian history.\n\nSourit’s seven-month Fellowship award will support teaching relief to provide time to work on the monograph project, and will also support archival research in the UK, India and Bangladesh.\n\nFind out more about Sourit's research on his Research Profile\n\n18 March 2024\n\nŞebnem Susam-Saraeva, Professor of Translation Studies, has won Leverhulme International Fellowship funding for her project ‘Translation And Cetacean Communication Systems: Interactions And Synergies.’\n\nŞebnem’s project is a ‘discipline-hopping excursion’ from translation studies in arts and humanities to marine bioacoustics in life sciences. Her objective is to bring perspectives from translation studies into debates in marine bioacoustics and conservation, by reconsidering impact, ethics, representation and knowledge translation. The funding will allow Şebnem to work at three centres in the U.S. and Canada that specialize in the communication systems, habitats, and behaviour of cetaceans (whales, dolphins and porpoises). During her visits, Şebnem will gain invaluable hands-on experience at data-collection and analysis; interact with outstanding researchers in the field; and visit relevant interpretation centres and museums.\n\nThis projct builds on Şebnem’s recent trip to Trinity College Dublin as a Visiting Fellow at the Trinity Long Room Hub, where she explored what a posthuman ethics of translation and representation could look like for dolphin and whale communication in arts and music.\n\nFind out more about Şebnem's research on her Research Profile\n\n14 March 2024\n\nProf. Marion Schmid and Dr Fabien Arribert-Narce (DELC, French) are hosting a two-day in-person, international, and interdisciplinary workshop in intermedial studies. 'Theories and Practices of Intermediality Today' is the first joint workshop of the research partnerships in intermedial studies between the University of Edinburgh and Meiji University (Tokyo, Japan). The event also includes participants from Linnaeus University (Sweden) and Aix-Marseille University (France), with guests from IULM Milano (Italy).\n\nExchanges in this workshop will be greatly enriched by crossed cultural and academic perspectives between the respective institutions and address a range of questions; What are the most prominent ways of approaching intermediality and multimodality today, and how can these trends, critical traditions and their respective concepts be put into dialogue, combined or transformed in artistic practice? How can ideas and methods used in one of these analytical or artistic modes facilitate creative innovation in another? How can critical approaches conventionally applied to one medium or art form help us to better understand another? More generally, how can bringing into contact different artistic traditions ranging from classic to more contemporary media spur creativity and the construction of new kinds of aesthetic experience and semiotic interpretations? How do specific media and art forms interact in and between different cultures and historical eras, in the context of pressing lines of enquiry such as eco-criticism, gender studies, and postcolonialism and decolonization studies?\n\nThe organisers seek to initiate a discussion between established scholars of intermediality, early-career colleagues and research students that will help them forge new creative and critical positions in this fast-developing field of study — a field which has prompted some of the most original concepts and critical theories since the beginning of the 21st century.\n\nFind out more about intermediality at Edinburgh\n\n12 March 2024\n\nTerri Ochiagha (English Literature) has been awarded British Academy/Leverhulme Trust Small Research Grant funding for her project 'Chinua Achebe: The Final Years (1993-2013)'. As part of Terri’s work on his first full-length biography, this project explores the unchronicled final years of the Nigerian writer Chinua Achebe (1930-2013), acclaimed ‘father of modern African literature,’ and one of the key literary figures of the twentieth century.\n\nIn 1993-2013, coinciding with distinguished professorships at Bard College and Brown University, Achebe embarked on an intensive period of selfmemorialisation. This project examines the complexities of Achebe’s conscious definition of his own legacy against the wider contexts of his life and work, thus enabling a re-evaluation of Achebe’s status as a writer on the world literary stage and complicating his hitherto simplified and—to a degree—misleading public identity as simply the anti-colonial African writer par excellence.\n\nThe funding will enable Terri to undertake two research trips to the USA to conduct archival research and interview Achebe’s family members and former colleagues. The research will contribute to two of the biography’s chapters as well as a chapter in the edited volume Terri is preparing.\n\nFind out more about Terri's research on her Research Profile\n\n11 March 2024\n\nSourit Bhattacharya (English Literature) has received funding from the Government of India for a project which will examine the paradigms, networks and practices of translation in colonial India in the period between 1800 and 1947. Sourit will collaborate with colleagues from the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, the Vellore Institute of Technology in India, the Universities of Chicago and Pennsylvania and will take part in workshops and masterclasses in India over the next two years.\n\nFind out more about Sourit's research on his Research Profile\n\n10 March 2024\n\nCharlotte Bosseaux (Translation Studies) was in York for a screening of the documentary film 'Surviving Translation,' an in-depth look at the ethics of translation arising out of Charlotte's AHRC Research, Development and Engagement Fellowship. 'Surviving Translation' (Charlotte Bosseaux and Ling Lee, 2023) focuses on the traumatic experiences of female migrants, capturing intimate conversations with migrants and language professionals, and weaving these narratives together to create an informative and moving study of this unexamined subject.\n\nThe creation of the documentary film was supported by an AHRC Fellowship, held by Charlotte from February 2022 to December 2023. During this time, Charlotte collaborated with Saheliya (a Scottish-based charity supporting survivors), Screen Language (an Edinburgh-based subtitling and translation agency), and filmmaker Ling Lee. Crucially, through her collaboration with Saheliya, Charlotte was able to work with service users to incorporate their perspectives into the filmmaking process.\n\nThe screening of the film in York was a special colloquium event to mark International Women's Day, and was followed by a Q&A with Charlotte.\n\nFind out more about Charlotte's research on her project's website\n\n9 March 2024\n\nLori Watson (Celtic & Scottish Studies) is one of twelve women named in Hands Up for Trad's 2024 Women in Music and Culture List.

The book constitutes a compilation, analysis, and evaluation of the oldest accounts of the life of the Prophet Muhammad. These accounts were collected and spread in the last third of the 1st/7th century by Urwa ibn al-Zubayr, a grandnephew of Muhammad's and nephew of Muhammad's wife 'A'isha and are preserved in numerous sources.\n\nWorking with an exhaustive corpus of traditions, Andreas and Gregor distinguish authentic traditions going back to Urwa ibn al-Zubayr from those wrongly ascribed to him. Through a critical analysis of different versions of a tradition they also separate later additions and embellishments from the original core of the traditions. In contrast to a widespread trend in Islamic studies to reject the whole Islamic tradition on the origins of Islam as unauthentic, this book not only brings forward well-founded arguments for the existence of an authentic kernel in the traditions on the Prophet Muhammad but also shows in an exemplary manner how this kernel can be uncovered.\n\nFind out more about Andreas's research on his Research Profile\n\n29 February 2024\n\nProf. Paul Crosthwwaite (English Literature) published his latest monograph, 'Speculative Time: American Literature in an Age of Crisis' with Oxford University Press (OUP). The monograph has been published as part of OUP's Studies in American Literary History series, and provides the first account of American literature and finance in the period defined by the Great Crash of 1929. The work looks at how a climate of financial and economic speculation and disaster shaped the literary culture of the United States in the early to mid-twentieth century.\n\nThe book offers an innovative account of how the speculative boom and bust of the “Roaring Twenties” affected literary and cultural production in the United States. It situates the stock market gyrations of the 1920s and 1930s within a wider culture of speculation that was profoundly shaped by, but extended well beyond, the brokerages and trading floors of Wall Street.\n\nAs part of this account, the book theorises the concept of ‘speculative futurity’, and offers innovative close readings of much-read authors such as F. Scott Fitzgerald, William Faulkner, Richard Wright and Ralph Ellison, as well as lesser-known writers and artists including Archibald MacLeish, Christina Stead and Margaret Bourke-White.\n\nFind out more about Paul's research on his Research Profile\n\n29 February 2024\n\nProf. Federica Pedriali (DELC, Italian) has been conferred with a Title of Honour by the President of the Italian Republic, Cavaliere dell’Ordine della Stella d’Italia. This distinction recognises Prof. Pedriali's substantial contributions to friendly relations and cooperation between Italy and the UK as well as her extensive scholarly work.\n\nFind out more about Federica's research on her Research Profile\n\n15 February 2024\n\nEmanuela Patti (DELC, Italian) has been awarded a Royal Society of Edinburgh Personal Research Fellowship for her project \"David Rizzio: History And Myth Across Arts And Media.\" This project will explore the multifaceted figure of David Rizzio (1533-1566), also known as Davide Riccio, a key Italian figure in Scottish history and culture. As a Catholic with strong relations with papacy, Rizzio played a significant role in the scenario of religious conflicts which marked the Scottish Reformation. These reasons, together with the close relationship with Mary Queen of Scots, have made him a highly romanticised historical character, represented in the arts (painting, cinema, literature, theatre, music) for centuries.\n\nDespite the centrality of David Rizzio in Scottish and European history, there are barely any scholarly publications on either his political and cultural role in the sixteenth century or his artistic influence and reception in the following centuries. Emanuela’s Personal Research Fellowship builds on her RSE Research Workshop award (2022) and will enable her to devote her time to researching this fascinating historical figure as well as undertake research trips to England, France and Italy.\n\nFind out more about Emanuela's research on her Research Profile\n\n15 February 2024\n\nŞebnem Susam-Saraeva (Translation Studies) has been awarded a Royal Society of Edinburgh Research Collaboration Grant for her project \"The Beginnings: Factoring in interpreting at antenatal healthcare and midwifery education.\" This project is a continuation of \"Translating informed consent in Scottish maternity services,\" funded by an RSE Research Workshop Grant in 2022.\n\nResponding to the needs of service users that became clear in the original project, Şebnem's new project will establish a collaborative network of researchers, practitioners and educators to examine the best ways of flagging up interpreting needs at early stages of antenatal care, and firmly incorporating linguistic and cultural awareness into the Scottish midwifery curriculum. Through a series of expert focus groups and interviews, as well as research on existing maternity note systems and education curricula, the project intends to explore best practice and feed into policy decisions.\n\nThroughout the project, Şebnem will be collaborating with colleagues from Edinburgh Napier University, Heriot-Watt University and the University of the West of Scotland. The network will also include representatives from the NHS Lothian Maternity Voices Partnership, the Edinburgh Pregnancy Research Team, and AMMA Birth Companions, a Glasgow-based charity that supports women and birthing people who face birth and parenting alone, approximately half of whom speak little or no English.\n\nThe funding from the RSE will allow Şebnem to host the focus groups, interviews and network meetings across central and southern Scotland, supporting travel costs and the recruitment of an administrative assistant. The funding will also allow a specialist from AMMA's Perinatal Team to be involved throughout the project.\n\nFind out more about Şebnem's research on her Research Profile\n\n15 February 2024\n\nHannah Simpson (English Literature) has been awarded a Royal Society of Edinburgh Small Research Grant for her project \"The Unexpected Dramatist: Modernism’s Forgotten Stage Plays.\" This award is part of Hannah's larger project, which will result in a monograph entitled \"The Unexpected Dramatist: Modernism’s Forgotten Stage Plays,\" examining the plays of several major Anglophone modernists who are not typically considered playwrights.\n\nGeorge Orwell, E.M. Forster, Virginia Woolf, James Joyce, Flann O’Brien, Elizabeth Bowen, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Ernest Hemingway and William Faulkner all achieved fame as prose writers, yet each tried at least once to write a stage play. Hannah’s project examines these plays both as stand-alone texts that influence our understanding of these writers’ more established bodies of work, and as texts in dialogue with the modernist theatre scene. With RSE’s support, Hannah will undertake archival research trips in England, examining Virginia Woolf, E.M. Forster and George Orwell’s theatre work.\n\nFind out more about Hannah's research on her Research Profile\n\n15 February 2024\n\nYoungmi Kim (Asian Studies) has been awarded a Royal Society of Edinburgh Small Research Grant for her project \"Arts and Community Mobilisation in Culture-Led Urban Regeneration Projects in Leith (Scotland) and Gamcheon (Korea).\" The project’s focus is on two post-industrial cities in Europe and Asia: Leith (Scotland) and Gamcheon Village, a hillside former slum area in the city of Busan (South Korea), whose thriving as globally-significant ports has been followed by a sharp socio-economic decline. Comparing these two neighbourhoods of creative cities that actively deploy cultural policies in the pursuit of urban regeneration, the project seeks to understand what makes some culture-led urban regeneration initiatives more successful than others.\n\nThe support from the RSE will enable Youngmi to undertake two field trips to Busan to conduct interviews with academics and local artists, which will be analysed alongside data collected from Edinburgh. Youngmi also plans to host a roundtable discussion in Edinburgh, bringing together local residents, artists, community council representatives and heritage preservation activists.\n\nFind out more about Youngmi's research on her Research Profile\n\n1 February 2024\n\nPeadar Ó Muircheartaigh (Celtic and Scottish Studies) started his two-year AHRC-funded project 'From Lismore To Barbados: The Gaelic Caribbean Travel Journal And Verse Of Dugald MacNicol (1791-1844).' Collaborating with his co-investigator Prof Nigel Leask (University of Glasgow), Peadar will focus on a travel journal and song-poems written in Scottish Gaelic in the 1810s by Dugald MacNicol, a soldier from Lismore stationed in Barbados. Over the next two years, Peadar and Nigel will edit Dugald MacNicol's writing to modern standards, organise two conferences (in Lismore and Barbados), and co-develop a television documentary.\n\nFollow the project's developments on 'The MacNicol Project' website.\n\nFind out more about Peadar's research on his Research Profile\n\n31 January 2024\n\nMavis Ho (Translation Studies) published her latest monograph 'Appraisal and the Transcreation of Marketing Texts' with Routledge.\n\nThe volume charts the origins of the term \"transcreation\", emerging from the interplay of established concepts of translation, creation, localisation, and adaptation and ongoing debates on what should be transcreated and how. Using these dialogues as a point of departure, Mavis outlines a way forward for transcreation research by advocating for the use of an appraisal framework, taken from work in systemic functional linguistics and employed to evaluate persuasion in language. In focusing on marketing texts from the websites of three luxury brands in English and Chinese, the book explores how this approach can surface fresh perspectives on the different ways in which the processes and practices of marketing transcreation are used to generate persuasion across languages. The volume looks ahead to the implications for other language pairs and the applications of the appraisal framework to understand transcreation practice of other genres, such as literary texts.\n\nFind out more about Mavis's research on her Research Profile\n\n21 January 2024\n\nFabien Arribert-Narce (DELC, French) along with Alex Watson (Meiji University) published an edited collection 'Intermedial Encounters between Image, Music and Text: With and Beyond Roland Barthes'. This collection of essays focuses on Roland Barthes as a crucial figure in intermedia studies, arguing that “the concepts and forms of analysis he pioneered are of continuing importance for students and scholars working in the field.”\n\nThe collection of essays arose from a series of workshops, part of a research partnership in Intermedia Studies that launched between the University of Edinburgh and Meiji University Tokyo in September 2021, led by Fabien. The first workshop took place in Edinburgh in March 2022, and a second workshop took place in Tokyo in December 2022 (funded in part by an award from the Great Britain Sasakawa Foundation).\n\nFind out more about Fabien's research on his Research Profile\n\n8 January 2024\n\nŞebnem Susam-Saraeva (Translation Studies) has been selected to take part in the 2024 Edinburgh Climate Research Leaders Programme. This programme is a collaborative leadership programme for women in climate research, run by Edinburgh Research Office with support from the Institute for Academic Development, the Edinburgh Earth Initiative and training partner 64 Million Artists."
