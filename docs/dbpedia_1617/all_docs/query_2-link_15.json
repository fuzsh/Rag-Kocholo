        "text": "Unbeknownst to all eight clubs in the league at the time, the 1920-21 NAFBL season would be the last one on record - Brooklyn Robins finished 3rd on points (12) behind New York FC (17) and league winners Bethlehem Steel (23). It wasn’t the prize they were seeking, however, after going out in the semifinal of the 1919-20 National Challenge Cup to Fore River, Robins were seeking retribution. Especially so after seeing that Fore River lost in the final to Ben Millers 1-2. In the 1920-21 tournament, the Robins eleven would find their way past their opponents, round after round. On November 25th, it was a convincing win over Columbia Graphophone 3-0; they snuck past Erie AA in the 4th round after a replay. Robins ran into Fore River in the quarterfinals but exacted their revenge with a 3-0 thumping. Interestingly enough, they ran into their sister club Tebo Yacht Basin in the semifinals, but proved why they were the top club and won 3-0 again. On April 19th, 1921, Brooklyn Robins Dry Dock FC made it to the final of the National Challenge Cup to play the two-time winner of their own St. Louis Soccer League, Scullin Steel FC.\n\nThe USFA National Challenge Cup Final annually rotated to a new neutral site; in Pawtucket, Rhode Island in 1918, Fall River, Massachusetts in 1919, St. Louis, Missouri in 1920 and Robins would take on the Scullin Steel eleven in the “City of Hills and Mills,” in the southwestern part of Massachusetts. The Final had returned to Fall River and according to the match report from the 1921 Spalding’s Guide to Soccer, “It mattered not to the fans of this section that the Fall River Rovers were not battling on the field that day. Fall River Fans rallied to the support of the game.” With an attendance listed at 8,000 it's easy to assume at least a few hundred made it up from St. Louis or New York for the final, but that level of interest from the neutral fans shows an immense level of interest in professional soccer at the time.\n\n“Robins twice before had been a strong bidder for the highest honors soccer has to bestow in this country, but on both occasions had missed out when the achievement of their greatest ambition seemed imminent,” reports Spalding’s. It was even well-known at the time that Robins had been close contenders and those losses galvanized their sponsors, Todd Shipyards, to spend the money in order to win the prize. The money was well spent too, “Robins exercised the famous short passing style of play that is common to the team comprising kickers from across the water.” Scullin’s dependence on American grit and determination, the kick and run style of play, was no match for the fancy footwork and quick passing of Robins’ forward line.\n\nThe score-sheet from the match report shows the game might have been slightly more interesting to begin with however, Scullin scored first with a goal from Charles Bechtold in the 15th and Robins’ Jack McGuire answered immediately in the 16th to make it even. Scullin Steel went ahead again just minutes later when Bechtold scored his brace. Unfortunately for Scullin, it was at that point that Robins took control of the match and three more players contributed to the win; Robert Hosie in the 29th, Peter Sweeney in the 64th, and George McKelvey finished off the evening with a fourth goal for Robins Dry Dock in the 71st. “Much credit must be given the speedy forward line of the brilliant Robins eleven. Their pace was remarkable. Sweeney, Hosie, McGuire, Ratican, and McKelvey - perhaps no swifter combination has been known to the soccer world of the present day.”\n\nBy the Spring of 1921, the NAFBL was collapsing as the teams at the top were looking for something higher profile and the teams at the bottom couldn’t afford to keep going as they were. Todd completed the merger of Tebo Yacht Basin FC, Robins Dry Dock FC, and for what it's worth, probably Tietjen & Lang. Manager Drysdale was able to recruit William Whitehead, Adam Smith, James Campbell, and Bill Fryer into the new team and headed into their initial American Soccer League (ASL) season as favorites to make some noise. The ASL was a combination of the old NAFBL with teams from the Southern New England Soccer League and hopes were high. However, the league hit a few snags in the beginning, and despite throwing $6,000 ($79, 476.49 in today’s money) at their newly minted franchise, Jersey City Celtics folded. According to David Wangerin in Soccer in a Football World, “The remaining seven clubs lasted the season, but winter postponements and apathy toward meaningless end-of-season matches - particularly when visiting teams had little financial incentive to travel - meant some did not fulfill all their fixtures.”\n\nThe increased costs of competing in the expanded area of the ASL and the issue of dealing with incompetent fellow ownership groups became a burden on teams like Todds who, by all accounts were still well-funded. However, with the economic stresses of 1921-22 combined with the haphazard way the new league was run, Todd Shipyards would not return for another season. Which was a shame too, because despite all the ailments of the league, Todds, led by the “Mac Attack” of Frank McKenna, Jack McGuire, and George McKelvey were putting on lively displays of attacking prowess. After 24 games played in the league, Todd Shipyards finished 3rd behind Philadelphia FC and New York FC, but boasted a +19 goal difference and a return trip to the National Challenge Cup final - against none other than Scullin Steel FC.\n\nScullin Steel FC didn’t switch leagues; they weren’t bogged down with upgrading their facilities or spending funds on long-distance away days. By and large, Scullin Steel remained the same club that they were the year before and they leveled all competition on their way to the Cup Final in 1922; 2-0 over Johnston City, 3-0 over Ben Millers, 3-0 again beating Pullman FC, and thumping Caledonia FC 4-0 in the semifinal. Scullin hadn’t given up a goal in the entire competition. Todds’ path was a little rockier; 5-3 over NY Field Club, 4-1 over Philadelphia Field Club, cutting it close with a 1-0 victory against Harrison SC, and just getting past Abbot Worsted in their semifinal, 2-1. Todd Shipyards was clearly dealing with a bit of pressure to return to the final and juggle that with the inconsistencies of league play in the ASL.\n\nOn March 19, 1922 Scullin Steel FC met Todd Shipyards FC for a rematch of the previous year’s National Challenge Cup Final. Scullin had every reason to feel that they had this one in the bag and had done everything possible to get to High School Field in St. Louis, Missouri - in front of 9,000 spectators and in their very own backyard. According to the match report, “until fifteen minutes before game time the rain came down in torrents.” The pitch was a muddy disaster and for the first half an hour, the home team were anchored as Todd Shipyards came in with their tails up. Jack McGuire, with an assist from Ratican, scored the first goal of the contest in the 17th and just two minutes later, he doubled their scoreline. Scullin Steel were shocked it would take them until nearly the end of the half to get back in the match but once they did, they never looked back, “The youth and stamina of the Scullins started telling. And once the Eastern veterans started to tire, the Scullins were by far the better team. The forwards played as they should, while the halfbacks broke up the combination play of the drydock eleven.”\n\nReaders may have noticed that a recent lawsuit brought by the USL against the UPSL for breach of trademark brought many soccer commentators to bemoan the return of new “soccer wars”. Why would a beef between leagues result in such an immediate and specific response? The simple answer is that a turf battle between soccer organizations helped doom the Golden Age of U.S. soccer. And, it is not hyperbole to say that the implications of that original “soccer war” continues to resonate until today. Sadly, top-level soccer in the U.S. seems unable to break a regular cycle of internecine wars. In order to give some background, in this article of Kicking Back we present a survey-style history course on American “soccer wars”.\n\n1924-25: An Opening Skirmish\n\nFollowing the 1923-24 season, the American Soccer League was on the ascendent. The league was stable and pulling in a good deal of fans. The league’s owners decided it was time to grow the eight-team league. They added three new clubs in New England (Boston, New Bedford and Providence) and brought in Fleisher Yarn, a top-notch Philadelphia amateur club.\n\nThe added clubs meant more games and the league pushed the schedule from 28 to 44 games. League owners began negotiations with the U.S. Football Association concerning their clubs’ ability to play in the National Challenge Cup (now called the U.S. Open Cup). ASL owners claimed that the additional league games would make it difficult for the clubs to schedule National Challenge Cup games during the season. But, a more practical reason for the disagreement was that the USFA made most of its annual income from the cup by taking a relatively high percentage of the gate receipts. And, after the association took its cut, the pro clubs found it not worth the loss of money when playing in front of smaller audiences when they had to play smaller clubs in the early rounds.\n\nA month before the league season started the ASL voted to withdraw from the NCC. The country’s other major pro league, the four-team St. Louis Soccer League, also voted to withdraw. These moves led to Bethlehem’s local newspaper, The Globe, to announce “Looks Like A Soccer War” in its August 11, 1924 edition.\n\nThe leagues hoped to hold a replacement tournament but their different schedules made the idea impractical. Instead, the ASL held a league cup in the spring with the winner, Boston S.C., playing the American Pro Soccer Championship against the winners of the St. Louis league, the Ben Millers. Boston took the three-game series two games to one.\n\nThe USFA blinked first and, at their May 1925 annual meeting, they decided to lower their percentage of the NCC gate receipts by over half. This made the competition more palatable for the pro clubs and both pro leagues re-joined the cup in the next year.\n\n1928-29: The Soccer War\n\nEven though a truce was called after the 1924-25 season, the ASL and USFA continued sniping at each other as each regularly threatened to sever relations with the other. In the summer of 1928, the ASL voted Nat Agar as its delegate to the USFA’s annual meeting. Agar was empowered by the league to get the USFA to agree to keep the National Challenge Cup from disrupting the ASL schedule or the league would again withdraw its clubs. Agar, manager-owner of the Brooklyn Wanderers and long-time major domo of New York soccer, was a prime mover in pushing the ASL to flex its muscles. Another such owner was Charles Stoneham who owned baseball’s New York Giants as well as the ASL’s New York Nationals. Stoneham wanted the ASL to become the preeminent U.S. soccer organization. Stoneham’s Nationals won the 1928 NCC. After that victory, he pledged that his club would never play in another USFA tournament, and he called for other major league pro baseball owners to form or acquire ASL clubs to grow the league.\n\nStoneham’s biggest idea was a push to have the ASL’s champions to be named the champions of the East. In addition, he recommended that a new western league of baseball-owned clubs be created, whose champions would be named champions of the West. Under this plan, the eastern and western ASL champions would meet for the national soccer championship. At this point, the NCC was the preeminent soccer competition in the US and, via that tournament, the two finalists were considered the champions of the east and west with the winner considered the national champions. Stoneham’s proposal would shake up the power structure of U.S. soccer in a major way including greatly weakening the position of the USFA.\n\nAgar came back from the July USFA meeting without a compromise and, in mid-September 1928, two weeks into the ASL season, the league voted to withdraw from the NCC. While the league owners voted to withdraw from the cup, three clubs decided to reject the boycott. Bethlehem Steel F.C., New York Giants S.C. and Newark F.C. ignored the league edict and registered for the tournament. These clubs saw financial benefits from playing in the cup and also rejected the Stoneham plan, in part because the league he wanted to create was a closed franchise model that would cap the number of clubs allowed to take part in his proposed national championship.\n\nOn September 27, the ASL suspended the three clubs from the league and fined each $1,000 for entering the NCC. On October 2, the USFA suspended the league. The grandfather of all soccer wars had begun in earnest.\n\nOn October 8, the three former-ASL clubs and five other eastern clubs quickly formed a new professional soccer league, the Eastern Soccer League, with the sanction of the USFA. The ASL felt the effects almost immediately. Due to the suspension, the ASL was operating as an “outlaw league” outside the sanctioning of the USFA and FIFA. Any player who played in such a league could also find themselves banned from signing contracts with sanctioned leagues domestic as well as international. As such, many foreign players decided to leave their ASL clubs rather than risk such a ban.\n\nStoneham’s New York Nationals were the hardest hit. On October 12, ten Nationals players quit the team before a match against the Wanderers due to the USFA’s suspension of the ASL. Most of these were former SC Hakoah Vienna players who joined the league after that club’s 1926 tour of the U.S. The Nationals played an impromptu exhibition with the Wanderers but had to cancel their next two games while they signed new players. In addition, a month later, the club moved from the Polo Grounds to the much smaller Innisfail Park in the Bronx.\n\nWhile most of the non-ASL clubs were semi-pro outfits, one, the Hakoah All-Stars, was a new club made up primarily of the former ASL Hakoah Vienna players. The first game of the new ESL was held on October 13 between the New York Giants and Bethlehem Steel.\n\nThe ESL included several teams from the Southern New York State Football Association. The SNYSFA saw the ESL as an encroachment on its territory and the Association’s president, Dr. G.R. Manning, resigned in protest. Nat Agar ascended to the SNYSFA’s presidency and withdrew the organization from the USFA.\n\nThe two pro leagues battled for fans during the fall. On December 23, the clubs from the ASL and the SNYSFA formed the American Soccer Association with the intention to challenge the authority of the USFA. In the spring, following the ASL regular season, the ASA held a cup for all the clubs in the ASL and the SNYSFA. As a counter, the USFA formed a new New York State Football Association and all the ESL teams entered a cup competition of the newly organized NYSFA.\n\nBoth pro leagues completed their 1928-29 seasons and moved forward with 1929-30 seasons. The ASL launched relatively early in mid-August in hopes of getting ahead of their rival. But the soccer war and the late-summer recession severely strained the finances of all clubs involved. As the soccer season began, it became glaringly obvious something needed to be done and the parties began formal negotiations.\n\nOn October 22, most of the ASL clubs were reinstated by the USFA. While the ESL continued play, the ASL suspended operations as the parties worked toward forming a new league. Two days later, in the middle of these negotiations, the “Black Thursday” stock market crash signaled the beginning of the Great Depression. “Black Monday” struck on October 29 and the Atlantic Coast Soccer League officially formed in the immediate aftermath. The first games of the merged league were played on November 9.\n\n1932: Everyone for Themselves\n\nThe 1931 American Soccer League (the ACSL was reorganized and renamed in the summer of 1930) season was the last one that it could be recognized as a true, stable major professional league. At the end of the ASL spring 1931 season, Nat Agar’s Brooklyn Wanderers’ sat in second place behind the New York Giants. Agar protested the championship results due to the Giants having one more game scheduled than Brooklyn. The protest was disallowed. Agar hosted a friendly at Ebbets Field against Glasgow Celtic for the next weekend. The USFA suspended Agar due to some issue with this game and he was forced to sell his interests in the Wanderers.\n\nNumerous franchise moves and foldings over a short amount ended with most of the old guard of owners out of the league by late 1932. The loss of stable finances and leadership led to a chaotic situation for professional soccer. As touched on in an earlier Kicking Back, the remaining New York contingent of ASL clubs withdrew from the league before the spring season began in an attempt to form a new, but ultimately doomed, competitor to the league.\n\nAnd there were even more battles during that year. After the tumultuous spring season, the USFA began plans to take control of pro soccer in the U.S. by directly promoting and organizing regional leagues. The governing body relied on the National Challenge Cup for income but the funds received were not enough and it was looking to the pro game for new funding sources. The state associations balked at the notion of the USFA circumventing their jurisdictions with rumblings that clubs could leave the USFA and operate as independents. The ASL responded to the USFA’s plan by electing the still-suspended Nat Agar as their new president.\n\nRather than embark on another protracted battle, the two sides decided on peace. The USFA reinstated Agar and the ASL agreed to allow its teams to enter the NCC. A few weeks later, Agar settled with the newly-formed National Soccer League by reinstating the New York Americans and entering a second New York club into the ASL.\n\n1933: The End of the Golden Age\n\nWhile the USFA and the ASL had an agreement, this understanding was not welcome at the state level. ASL secretary Sam Fletcher, former Providence F.C. player and owner, moved to organize a separate New England Division of the ASL. He was unable to field enough New England teams, and the ASL moved forward with only its four-team Metropolitan Division for the spring 1933 season.\n\nDuring that summer, Fletcher met with strong opposition from the New England state associations who disapproved of the ASL’s move to form a separate pro league that would not allow its clubs to take part in non-USFA cup competitions. With the fall season still not settled and hoping to stave off the ASL’s influence, the state associations attempted to form their own professional league but were not able to come to an agreement. Included reorganized ASL franchises in Boston, Fall River and Pawtucket, Fletcher managed to form a nine-team New England Division in time to start the 1933 fall season.\n\nWith the New England Division finally a reality, the USFA and ASL had aggregated control of the professional game on the East Coast. One more step solidified that control. On October 16, 1933 Nat Agar retired as president of the ASL and the organization reorganized. The two divisions, Metropolitan and New England, would operate as separate leagues under the umbrella ASL organization which was controlled by a three-man board. Even though the two divisions were the competitive leagues, it was American Soccer League, Inc. that formally held the affiliation with the USFA and given the sole right of interstate professional competition.\n\nThe original Soccer War badly destabilized US soccer governance at the national and league level. In addition, the Great Depression massively impeded the financial capacity of soccer owners. These two factors led to the scope of the American Soccer League eroding through the early 1930s. And, as the reach of the ASL narrowed, any hopes of a national soccer system forming during the mid-20th century also expired in part due to the continuing power struggle and lack of cohesion between the USFA and the state associations.\n\n1966-67: The Silver Age\n\nWhile the rest of the world embraced the modern game, the lack of direction in the U.S. doomed the sport to decline and obscurity in all but a few pockets of the country. Two major factors changed that. First, the 1960s was a period of change and expansion in the North American major sports league landscape. During the decade the American Football League and American Basketball Association were formed as competitors to the established National Football League and National Basketball Association. Also, the National Hockey League began a rapid period of expansion. Second, within that context, the 1966 FIFA World Cup held in England ratcheted up interest in the game to a new level in large part because the event was broadcast live on color television for the first time.\n\nIn the spring before that World Cup, FIFA met in New York City. Three North American groups were represented with an interest in forming a major league. The World Cup, held in July, was a massive success.\n\nThat summer one group named themselves the North American Soccer League and planned to begin play in 1968. The other two groups merged to become the National Professional Soccer League. For the most part, the ownership of these new teams were made up primarily of groups who already owned teams in the other major league sports.\n\nIn August, the NASL received sanctioning from the U.S. Soccer Football Association. Merger talks occurred over the next month with the NASL planning to have all-star and European teams playing in each city in 1967 and a full league to start in 1968. The NPSL ruled out the merger, moved forward with plans for a 1967 season as a 12-team “outlaw league”, and landed a $1 million television deal with CBS.\n\nLater in 1966, FIFA attempted to mediate a merger between the newly-organized leagues but failed to come to an agreement. In late December, FIFA officially sanctioned the NASL as the only U.S. major soccer league. Football associations in various countries warned that their players would be suspended if they signed with the non-sanctioned NPSL.\n\nWanting to avoid a failure, in February 1967, FIFA stated that players who signed with the NPSL would not be banned for life. In addition the organization urged the USSFA to immediately sanction the NPSL. While most domestic clubs, FIFA and other European clubs wanted the merger, the major stumbling blocks were the NPSL’s low television contract and the NASL’s exclusive 10-year sanctioning.\n\nBecause of a lack of a true professional game in the U.S., both leagues needed to look abroad for players. The NPSL opened their season on April 16 with 10 teams made up of mostly foreign players. A month and a half later, the 12-team United Soccer Association (renamed from the NASL that March) opened their “mini-league” with full imported foreign teams playing under contract to the domestic clubs. Merger talks continued to be held during the season.\n\nThe USA ended their “mini-league” on July 14 when the Los Angeles Wolves (represented by the Wolverhampton Wanderers) defeated the Washington Whips (represented by Aberdeen F.C.) 6-5 on an own-goal in sudden death overtime to win the 1967 Final before 17,842 at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. The NPSL completed their season on September 9 when the Oakland Clippers won the second-leg of the final against the Baltimore Bays 4-1 before 9,037 at Oakland-Alameda Coliseum taking the championship with a 4-2 aggregate.\n\nA merger between the leagues was reported to be announced the day before the NPSL final. But, it never materialized when, the day after the final, the NPSL filed an $18 million trust suit in federal court against the USA, USSFA, FIFA and the Canadian Soccer Football Association alleging a conspiracy to drive it out of existence. The suit alleged the groups blacklisted foreign players who signed with the NPSL and that USSFA officials who approved the sanction were given jobs in the USA. The suit also sought to enjoin the USA from fielding teams until the NPSL was recognized.\n\nMerger talks continued between the leagues while the case moved forward. In mid-November a federal judge ordered organized soccer to show cause why it should not be ordered to end its boycott of the NPSL. With the lawsuit pending, the two leagues formally agreed to a merger on December 7 with the new league taking the USA’s old North American Soccer League moniker. The NPSL dropped its suit soon after.\n\nThe battle was a costly one for all involved. It was reported that none of the teams in either league made money. The Baltimore Bays, owned by the Baltimore Orioles, lost $400,000 and the NPSL’s Philadelphia Spartans, owned by the Rooney family, lost $500,000 and folded after the merger. The PIttsburgh Phantoms of the NPSL had the worst of it losing $900,000 and also folded.\n\nThe 1968 season was similar to the prior one. The league was popular enough to continue but attendance wasn’t large enough to offset the costs and clubs continued to lose money. The league imploded, dropping from 17 teams to five for the 1969 season. But a more conservative approach allowed it to survive through the early 1970s until renewed interest led to a period of rapid expansion in the latter part of that decade.\n\n2009-11: The Soccer Warz\n\nIn August 2009, Nike sold its interest in the United Soccer Leagues to NuRock Soccer Holdings instead of a conglomerate of USL First Division owners. These clubs plus a few others broke away from the USL, formed a new North American Soccer League and applied to the USSF for Division II sanctioning.\n\nThe USL issued press releases claiming the breakaway clubs may have been in breach of contract and the league could seek litigation to protect its interest. The USSF found that three of the breakaway NASL teams had binding contracts with the USL for 2010, but that left neither league with the minimum number of teams to be sanctioned for that season. In December the USSF stripped sanctioning from the USL First Division and refused to sanction the NASL for 2010. After weeks of negotiation, the USSF announced it would run an interim Division II league for the 2010 season made up of the 12 NASL and USL clubs.\n\nFollowing that 2010 season, the NASL formally admitted all the breakaway teams and, with enough members, was given provisional Division II sanctioning in November for the 2011 season. The USL ceded the Division II tier to the NASL and reorganized the remaining USL First and Second Division teams into the Division III USL Pro league for the 2011 season.\n\n2015-18: The End of the Modern Era\n\nA new order had been established but one that none involved appeared happy with. The truce between the parties always seemed temporary and the status quo quickly disintegrated.\n\nIn September 2015 the NASL accused US soccer of antitrust violations if the USSF went ahead with the adoption of a new set of criteria for professional league sanctioning. The league accused the federation of colluding with Major League Soccer to protect the Division I league’s monopoly. The USSF ignored the NASL and adopted its new Professional League Standards.\n\nThe Wanderers began the year in a round-robin with other New York teams for a spot in the National Challenge Cup quarterfinals. But the club came bottom of the four teams and failed to advance. In fact, over its history, the Wanderers never had much success in the competition only making the Eastern Semifinals twice.\n\nThe first half of the 1931 American Soccer League season was a reversal of fortune as the Wanderers battled the New York Giants for the league lead. At the end of the half, the Wanderers finished second one game down to the Giants. But, the club lodged a protest with the ASL because the Giants had been scheduled to play one more game than the Wanderers.\n\nThe league did nothing. That disrespect seemed to be the last straw for Nat Agar and he disbanded the Brooklyn Wanderers before the beginning of the fall ASL season. Agar soon became president of the league. But a tradition had been created and the Brooklyn Wanderers name didn’t disappear for long.\n\nRebirth\n\nThe American Soccer League began to disintegrate in earnest at the beginning of the 1932 season. The seven-team league lost three New York teams on its opening weekend due to the financial difficulty of scheduling one New England game per road trip. The Hakoah club also wanted to withdraw but was prevented by the league. The four remaining teams played a truncated six-game round robin in the first half.\n\nBefore the fall season, the ASL attempted to plug their increasingly leaky dike by adding a few new clubs. To keep a foothold in the New York area, at the beginning of September, just a few short weeks before the season opener, the league granted P.J. Flannery a franchise for the Brooklyn territory. The new club named themselves the Brooklyn Wanderers and, as tradition would have it, shared Hawthorne Field as their home grounds with Hakoah F.C. Also, as tradition would have it, the club ended the fall yet again mid-table finishing fifth out of nine teams.\n\nThe first half of the 1933 American Soccer League season saw a complete separation between the New York and New England clubs. The Wanderers finished third out of four teams in a six game round robin season. Any pretense that the ASL was a major league had now disappeared.\n\nBefore the second half of the 1933 ASL season, the league went through a major reorganization. Nat Agar was removed as president and the league formally split into two separate organizations: the Metropolitan and New England Divisions. While still a professional league, this restructured ASL ran on a lower level in terms of both scope and finances.\n\nOnly three clubs remained in the New York-based Metropolitan Division: Brookhattan; New York Americans; and Brooklyn Wanderers. The Metropolitan Division returned to a more traditional late fall to late spring soccer schedule and, during the fall, began adding clubs to bolster their ranks ending up with a full complement of eight clubs by late December 1933.\n\nThe borough of Brooklyn had two teams in the league that fall: the Wanderers and the Celtics. Brooklyn Celtic F.C. was a newly organized club that, confusingly, had the same name as an older club that was competing in the amateur Metropolitan Soccer League. The ASL Celtics’ home ground was Commercial Field (now Hamilton Metz Field in the Wingate neighborhood) while the Wanderers continued to call Hawthorne Field home.\n\nThe league’s winter break started after matches scheduled for December 25. The Wanderers lost their game to the New York Americans 1-2 at Starlight Park and had compiled a record of four wins, two draws and six losses. Over the break, most ASL teams played their first round National Challenge Cup matches but the Wanderers were absent from the tournament.\n\nAt some point before the American Soccer League resumed its schedule on January 21, 1934, the Wanderers merged with the Queens-based Hispano F.C. (once a member of the “Soccer War”-era Eastern Soccer League). The merged club was renamed Brooklyn Hispano F.C. and took on Hispano F.C.’s dismal 0-0-7 league record rather than the Wanderers’ much more middling record. The new aggregation shared a home grounds at Commercial Field alternating dates with Brooklyn Celtic.\n\nBrooklyn Hispano played much better in the second half but, burdened with Hispano’s seven losses, ended their first ASL season next to last in the standings. The club remained a stalwart of the league through the post-war years. Hispano won a few league championships and two National Challenge Cup championships during this time, including a “double” in 1943.\n\nA bit of background is helpful to understand the history of the next version of the Brooklyn Wanderers. Brooklyn Celtic played three seasons in the American Soccer League but was expelled after the 1935-36 season for failure to pay fees assessed by the league. That August, Brooklyn’s St. Mary’s Celtic Soccer Club joined the ASL to fill the gap left by the withdrawal of Brooklyn Celtic F.C. For a couple of years, Brooklyn Celtic attempted to be reinstated to the league through legal means but ultimately failed.\n\nSt. Mary’s Celtic had a fairly successful run during its time in the league. While it never won the ASL championship it did lift the National Challenge Cup in 1939. But, the club struggled financially during the 1941-42 season and the franchise was sold that summer to former referee, Bob Graham.\n\nGraham quickly named the club Brooklyn Wanderers and invested in renovating Celtic Park, St. Mary’s home grounds, which was renamed Brooklyn Oval for opening day. The Wanderers were a good team during these post-war years but never managed to take home any hardware.\n\nThe End of the Wanderers\n\nNear the end of the 1947-48 season, Bob Graham died suddenly. The club found itself needing to find new ownership before 1948-49 season. Two games into that season, the Graham family sold the Wanderers franchise to Brooklyn’s Hakoah A.C. A member of the amateur National Soccer League of New York, Hakoah quickly withdrew from that league, dispersed all the club’s current players to other teams, and restocked the club with their own players. The club dropped the Brooklyn Wanderers name in favor of their own Hakoah A.C. name.\n\nHakoah lasted in the American Soccer League through the 1955-56 season but, like the Wanderers, never won anything. Before the 1956-57 season, Hakoah merged with the New York Americans. The new Hakoah of New York aggregation was a juggernaut and took the league championship in their first three years of existence. The club disbanded after the 1963-64 season.\n\nWhile the clubs carrying the Brooklyn Wanderers name were never highly successful on the field, the important soccer tradition that the name carries shouldn’t be denied. The Wanderers were a vital part of the early U.S. soccer landscape and should remind us that the connection between a club and the community that supports it is just as important as wins, losses and draws.\n\n- Dan Creel\n\nA Brief History of Jack Hynes\n\nJack Hynes played in the ASL for 23 seasons. Born in Scotland, his family moved to the United States when he was 13. He began playing professionally for Brooklyn St. Mary's Celtic in 1935 at the age of 15. In the 1938 National Challenge Cup (now the U.S. Open Cup) final, Brooklyn St. Mary's Celtic by Chicago Sparta 3-0 in Chicago with Hynes coming on late for Brooklyn when he was only 17.\n\nHe joined the US Army during World War II and was injured in the Battle of the Bulge in 1944. That injury left him with shrapnel in both legs and no feeling in his left calf. After leaving the military in 1946, he returned to playing soccer again.\n\nIn 1949, Jack was the key piece for the attack of the New York Americans. He led the team in goals and helped them advance to the ASL championship where they lost to the Philadelphia Nationals. Jack was also a pivotal part of the United States World Cup qualifications in 1949. The team was in group nine with Mexico and Cuba. Jack played the full ninety minutes in each of the four matches helping to advance to the 1950 World Cup, but was left off of the World Cup squad when he criticized the team selection for the qualification matches.\n\nHe continued to play in the ASL after his National Team fall out. In 1956 he received the ASL MVP award at the age of 36 while playing with Brooklyn Hakoah. In the fall of 1959, he joined Colombo as a player-coach.\n\nColombo: 1959-1960 Season\n\nColombo was a dominant team. In a league that contained US National Team greats like Benny McLaughlin, they finished the season after 18 games with 15 wins and a +45 goal difference. Their team contained Americans and international players from Europe and South America.\n\nAnthony Bonezzi was an Argentine midfielder that played for both the United States and Israel's national teams in 1961. Carlos Bustamente was a US striker that teamed with Bonezzi on Colombo, Brooklyn Italians, and Israeli teams. In 1959, just prior to joining Colombo, he was a part of the Montreal Canadian Alouettes FC which won Canada's title, the Carling's Red Cap Trophy. These players would go on to finish second and third in goals, with teammate Mario Zelaschi placing fourth. All three combined for 35 goals that season when the league average was 34.7 goals. Of the ten teams, those three players out scored eight of them.\n\nDuring this time, the ASL gave two points for a win and one for a tie. Colombo finished in first with 31 points and Ukrainian Nationals finished with 26 in under 20 matches.\n\nOther notable players:\n\nJoe Corbo (Germany)\n\nJohn Comazo (Italy)\n\nPeter Tagios\n\nLuiz Sansone (Argentina)\n\nManager: Peter Castelli\n\nOwner: Luigi DiFilippo\n\nFinal Standings G W T L GF GA PTS\n\nColombo 18 15 1 2 70 25 31\n\nUkrainian Nationals 16 12 2 2 49 21 26\n\nNew York Hakoah 16 7 4 5 31 22 18\n\nBrooklyn Italians 15 7 1 7 30 25 15\n\nBaltimore Pompeii 13 6 1 6 34 27 13\n\nFall River SC 13 5 3 5 26 27 13\n\nGalicia SC 16 4 5 7 32 40 13\n\nNewark Portuguese16 5 2 9 24 39 12\n\nFalcons SC 16 3 3 10 25 52 9\n\nUhrik Truckers 17 2 2 13 26 69 6\n\nASL Leading Scorers (Through March 20, 1960)\n\nM.

Jack Hynes retired at he end of the 1959-60 season and became a successful coach as he led Monsignor Farrell Lions to not lose a single match during the seasons from 1987-1994. Bonezzi and Bustamente went to play for Beitar Tel Aviv in Israel. They were banned after playing their first match due to Israel’s no foreign players rule but were later reinstated. In 1967, they were both in an accident which left Bustamante permanently injured and killed Bonezzi. Mr. DiFilippo continued his tailoring business in New York for the next 45 years.\n\n- Andy Rittenhouse"
