        "text": "Death of the Video Banda, an Integral Piece of Modern Culture.\n\nRecently while walking through a neighbourhood where I grew up, in Mombasa, I encountered a place that brought back so many memories of my teenage years. I sometimes try to roll back the years with walks down memory lane, literally. There it stood, still as it was before, structurally, maybe just a bit rustier after years of Mombasa humidity. But the aura around it just seemed off, like a fallen empire, with only those who experienced it having true tales of its former glory. Its template is similar to many such places across Africa, an iron sheet structure, with mostly wooden benches inside, projectors or sizeable TV screens. Video cafés is what the sophisticated will call them, ‘football viewing centers’ a more general continental term, ‘bandani’ if you grew up at the Coast.\n\nThe video banda’s transition to a societal mainstay is intertwined with changing consumers’ entertainment tastes and preferences. In the 90s it was the undisputed home for action movies (the kind of setting that gave DJ Afro a career), when video cassette players were still finding their way to the homes of the average Kenyan. Many had their first interaction with Jean-Claude Van Damme and Cynthia Rothrock in video bandas. Sarafina too, a much loved film reawakening the patriotic and pan-African spirit across Africa, found a home in the bossom of the video banda. It was a low-budget substitute to the luxuries of the movie theatres in the big towns and the then yet to be widely afforded video cassette player for the common mwananchi, making it a perfect fit for many low and middle-income settlements at the Coast. All this lay the foundation for the video banda’s real moment of greatness at the turn of the millennium, the increasing popularity of the English Premier League on our shores. Just like it offered a cheap avenue to movie access, so did it for European football, which Coast locals would tell you is aired ‘kwa dish’, pay TV. The dishes then for the behemoth digital satellite TV service provider DSTV/Multichoice were as big as those you would associate with NASA, adding to their grandeur. The video banda business model was simple, the proprietor paid for the monthly subscription premium package offered by the Pay TV service provider. The costs and profit from the venture would be offset by paying customers at the banda every other weekend. For as little as 20 shillings (sometimes less) one could watch the biggest teams in England and the rest of Europe playing. It nurtured the fanaticism and cult-like following for Manchester United, Arsenal, Liverpool and Chelsea a bit later, the original members of the ‘Top 4’ as the league ranking of the top clubs is commonly known.\n\nSo if the video banda is a preserve of many settlements across Africa, why my appreciation of it from a Coastal platform? It’s simple, because it offered a much-needed new frontier for merging of cultures, especially with the Coast being a hub of different cultures. In the video banda there was no religion, no political alignment, just a gathering of people united by love for the beautiful game of football. It broke many social barriers and stereotypes, it was the only place a fledgling teenage boy could trade banter (read heavy Coastal insults, in jest of course) with someone as old as his father, grandfather even, with no repercussions. When such gatherings happen weekly then it becomes more than a pastime, it is a way of life, much like in the old days when people gathered in barazas. So many bonds were forged in the video banda, culminating in regular attendees joining hands in the face of each others’ periods of tragedy in life. Many medical bills and funeral expenses were met with the backdrop of relationships built in the video banda. There was no alcohol drunk in the video banda (at least in these Coastal parts), making it neutral for people of different faiths, a stark contrast to the preferred social venues of football watching these days…restaurants, bars, even mangwes (palm wine joints) have graduated to the levels of airing live football matches. Sunflower seeds were a favoured snack in the banda, sellers of the commodity ultimately grateful for the ready market the video banda provided. A multi-faceted ground for entrepreneurship.\n\nIn the 2000s, the unwritten script for characters in the video banda was almost always the same, be it at the ‘Maracana’ in Kisauni or the banda next to Shukrani Café in Malindi. There was always a Liverpool fan, often advanced in age, who would hide in the shadow of his club’s past greatness (until recently), and most times exaggerate the number of years he’s been a Liverpool fan. The constantly hopeful Arsenal fans, at times hoping against all hope, logic and reason. I would have described them as mad, if I wasn’t one myself. The club somehow seems to boast an ever-relevant fanbase in number, no matter the disappointments on the pitch. Cult. Then there were the Manchester United fans, probably the most entitled and arrogant of the lot, they lived through the greatest period in their club’s history and were keen to constantly remind everyone of this. For some reason they chose Arsenal fans as their favourite banter recipients even after Chelsea came into the glory fold. Part-time football fans, full-time bullies. One thing the Arsenal and Manchester United fans were united in was castigating Chelsea fans as the Johnny-come-lately of the football scene. No amount of José Mourinho titles earned them favour in the eyes of the two sets of fans, at the time, they could do nothing right. Most Chelsea fans were accused of an Israelites-like exodus from Arsenal. There was also the conveyor of fake news, this one belonged to any team. At a time when the mobile phone handset wasn’t in most people’s hands and when it was it wasn’t as smart a phone as it is today, the player transfer news were left to be peddled like political propaganda. Wide access to the Goal website later ended the fake news merchant’s career, after a good run where he would declare top signings for his football club when even the club manager himself had no inkling of such. All these characters made for quite a potent mix of pure comedy, there was never a dull moment. You went to the video banda to forget your troubles and forget them you did.\n\nWith time, competition made the product offering by Pay TV service providers affordable for more households, some residential flats also offer a Pay TV option as part of the rental costs, add to that the Kenyan ingenuity in ‘illegal’ connections and cost-sharing, internet streaming of live matches and you can tell the video banda is in its dying embers of relevance. Regardless, its place in Coastal people’s recent modern culture is cast in stone. It taught and bred healthy competitive spirit, resilience to withstanding mocking and light-hearted banter, more importantly it taught everyone, young and old, how to live with other people of different backgrounds. I can’t think of any other setting presently that would bring together such a diverse collection of people, and Coastal society is lesser because of that. But just like the video banda broke the mould with its entrance into our lives, so must it exit the scene and die a natural death. So, three cheers for the video banda, a place of its time, deserving of being celebrated not mourned.\n\n15 Taveta proverbs and their English translations.\n\nThere’s a common misconception that the Taita and Taveta are one tribe, they certainly are not. They are two tribes speaking two different languages. They can pass as one ‘community’ though, because that’s a broader terminology that factors in constant interaction and having some things in common. Over the years they have mingled and intermarried and because of their geographical proximity, it is only normal that ways of living have been borrowed and exchanged, tongues too. However, to acknowledge what sets them apart is to keep their respective history and culture alive. Before jumping to their proverbs, let’s first know who the Taveta are and their differences from the Taita.\n\nThe Taveta mainly inhabit the lands between the Tsavo National Park and Tanzania, up to the slopes of Mt. Kilimanjaro. The rest of Taita Taveta County, the most hilly part, is mainly inhabited by their more popular neighbours, the Taita. The Taveta-inhabited area is flatter in comparison. Notable interactions the Taveta have had have been with the Taita, Pare, Chaga and Maasai. The Taveta language, Kitaveta, is lexically and grammatically close to Kichaga of the Chaga people of Tanzania. The Taita on the other hand have subgroups of the Wadawida and the Wasaghalla and speak Kidawida and Kisaghala, languages from the Saghalla/Pare subgroup of the Northeast Coastal Bantu, they also have clans, kichuku or vichuku each occupying their own territorial area of hills. Early pictures of Taveta warriors have them looking not much different from Maasai warriors.\n\nA British colonial administrator Sir Harry Johnston lived among the Taveta in 1884 and noted of the experience as such, “They appear to number some 4,000 souls. Some of the men being both tall and robust, occasionally attaining 6 feet. Their figures are often models of symmetry and grace. They also bear an excellent reputation among the Coast traders for honesty and friendliness.” In his notes, he placed their language as midway between Kikamba and Kichaga.\n\nNow to the proverbs of the Taveta people, a chance to understand and appreciate their culture and values. It will come as no surprise that the compilation was done by A. C. Hollis, another British colonial administrator, who lived among them in 1910. It gives me no joy that for us to trace our history we have to go through records by Colonial administrators, but therein lies the challenge, to do better in documenting our own culture and heritage in an era that is very conducive technologically. I’ve tried my best to place fitting practical scenarios to the proverb compilation, I will welcome any possible corrections.\n\nEsikie mbeho niye esongeria moto. It is the one who feels cold that approaches the fire. The proverb has shades of “before you judge a man, walk a mile in his shoes”. You can not fully understand what someone is going through or why they are behaving the way they are until you are placed in the same situation as them. A message of empathy.\n\nIdeghe imwe likaremwa kuiya teheshigha kucha. If one bird ceases singing the dawn will not stop. A harsh reminder that the world will not cease to exist after your passing on. People will mourn your death for a while of course, but ultimately life will go on. We are mortal beings, and just a minute entity of what makes humanity.\n\nIdio la mwana mkiwa lijimisha moto. Its literal translation is “the poor child’s banana will be blamed for extinguishing the fire”. The scenario depicts an orphaned child taken in by close kin, if the fire goes out when roasting bananas (staple food for the Taveta), it is the extra banana and in turn the child’s presence that will be blamed for depleting the resource. A painful reminder of how terribly we treat the lowly in society.\n\nIwato lifumie lafuma. Literally means “a leg which has gone out has gone out”. It is used to encourage commencement of ideas and commend progress, however small it might be. To put it in the words of one of ‘Kenyans On Twitter’ business success stories, “Breakthroughs only come once you have started something” – @osumo_brad.\n\nKaa ya mfole teiwa. The town of the coward is not cried in. Not every slight provocation should be met with aggression, sometimes it is better to walk away to avoid a calamitous ending. A warning to those that are quick to anger.\n\nKisimefwa usitaghe. Don’t abandon hope while you are still alive. Certainly words to live by. Life is full of comebacks and success stories after remarkable feats of resilience, as long as there is life and good health then there is hope. You can almost always turn a situation around if you keep trying.\n\nKukengwa na kusowa, keba kukengwa. Not sure how this will go down with most of you but the literal translation to this is “between being cheated and losing altogether, it is better to be cheated”. A proverb that seems to encourage finding a consolation out of the whole scenario no matter how difficult, even in cases of unfaithfulness.\n\nMundu ena ngingo teesowa kiraro. A man who owns a mat will not miss a sleeping place. A mat, and a decent one at that, seemed like a luxury. Then, as now, privilege was noted and acclaimed. Life is easier when you are a person of means.\n\nMuvyi wedi touikaa na izyaka. A fine arrow does not remain in the quiver. A morale-booster more than anything else, especially when one is going through serious trials. To remind them that it is the best ones who are truly tested because they are more than capable of handling it. A bit like Biblical Job’s tribulations to put his piety to test or “mti wenye matunda ndio hupigwa mawe”.\n\nTeri ya kidombo teiliwa. The sand or ground which is sat on is not eaten. A typical African proverb that frowns upon laziness. You will not get anywhere by idly sitting on your behind, one has to go out and earn their daily bread.\n\nTeta mboha amu na ngungu ina masikio. Speak softly for the wind has ears. The proverb comes from the common belief that not everyone means well for you, therefore you should always be discreet in your affairs, especially when touching on a sensitive subject.\n\nUkakoma nyoka, mkome na kamwe. If you kill a snake, kill it entirely. I would like to think it doesn’t necessarily allude to total annihilation of a foe lest they later get a chance at revenge, rather, if you have taken on a task, do it professionally at the first instance to avoid recurring challenges that will end up making it costlier than it should have been.\n\nUkatufa mate, temehundukia momoni. Spit saliva can never return to the mouth. A proverb preaching caution, some things can never be undone, angry speech for instance. “Speak when you are angry and you will make the best speech you will ever regret” comes to mind.\n\nUkasowa igombe usioghe mani. Because you lack an ox, do not bewitch the grass. Jealousy is a disease, it can blind you to the gains you can make from your neighbour prospering. In the proverb’s scenario, the neighbour’s ox can be borrowed to till your land. Something that will not happen in the absence of the ox.\n\nUsirighe mundu usimudawa. Do not insult a man you have not beaten. Complacency in anything will lead to your downfall. You can never be too ready for a challenge. Many a favourite have been overcome by underdogs in competition.\n\nArticle made possible by reviewing the source below:\n\nA. C. Hollis Taveta proverbs compilation: https://academic.oup.com/afraf/article-abstract/IX/XXXV/255/31135?redirectedFrom=PDF\n\n15 Digo (Mijikenda) Proverbs, their English translations and practical use.\n\n“Proverbs in every community give an insight on culture, values and beliefs of the community. They are like a window or tour into the heart of the community.” – @MtaitaMkauma\n\nWith that tweet summing up everything about the essence of this article, let’s journey to the heart of the Digo community through 15 of their proverbs.\n\nAlume mbere, alume nyuma. Its literal translation is “men infront, men behind”. It is used to encourage overall responsibility, courage and proactive nature in a group. Those being led by a leader should be ready to step up into the leader’s shoes in their absence.\n\nBahari taina msena. The ocean has no friend. Used to warn of the ocean’s ‘fickle’ nature. It has no loyalty, not even to experienced fishermen, sailors or swimmers. On a bad day anyone can face the ocean’s wrath and drown.\n\nCha mfupi chiriwa ni mure. Something belonging to a short person is eaten by a tall person. The proverb encourages long-term planning and vision. The best executed plans are those that factor in the future and changing seasons, not just instant gratification.\n\nChila nyumba ina msehowe. Every house has its sigh. The proverb is commonly used to advise married couples going through tough times or disagreements, preaching perseverance for there is no perfect household. Every household has its own fair share of troubles.\n\nDzogolo kuika sio dawa ya kucha. The cock crowing doesn’t cause the break of dawn. The proverb’s message is that of never overestimating your importance in someone’s life or to a cause. Some things will happen with or without your input. It is a great reminder to always remain humble.\n\nKusagala bure si kama kunyendeka bure. To sit for nothing isn’t the same as walking for nothing or with no intended purpose. Like all African cultures, the Digo frown upon laziness. If you sit idly you don’t give yourself the chance to even find luck, like picking up dropped money or something precious, which could have happened if you had taken a walk or strolled around.\n\nMairi mairi Mwatunya wachimbirwa na gari. Doing two things at once made Mwatunya miss the bus. Orderliness and preparedness is a virtue in African culture, if you don’t prepare beforehand chances are you will miss a great opportunity by hurriedly trying to do everything at once just before the deadline.\n\nMchetu karuswa na ndiro. A woman is not seduced by crying. While chivalry and romantic gestures are celebrated and find a home in every generation, desperation and begging for love are the surest way for a man to lose the respect of his peers and the woman herself. The Twitter world would advise against being a ‘simp’.\n\nMlatso tauchimbirana wala taurichana. Blood doesn’t run away from each other or leave each other. Just like The Godfather sequel, the Mafia or the Samurai, the Digo and African elders were also proponents of a strict code of honour in family set-ups. No matter what, you don’t give up on family.\n\nMnazi mmwenga una uchi wani? What palm wine do you get from one palm tree? A message of unity of purpose. For there to be enough palm wine for drinkers or revellers, more than one palm tree must be tapped. Basically carrying the message “If you want to go fast go alone. If you want to go far, go together.”\n\nMtsimba mbira naye aendza atsimbirwe. The one who digs a grave also wants to have a grave dug for him. As Africans we value coming together to give a decent burial to a departed family member or a member of the community. People remember the contribution (not necessarily material) that one makes towards burying another, and when the time comes they too will be decently buried.\n\nMvyere mtsape mairo, ela kumshinda marifwa. Run past an old man all you want but you won’t beat his wisdom. For a society to prosper there must be a good balance of youthful vigour and elderly wise counsel in action. We must never underrate or ignore the wise words of the elders, they have seen it all for there is nothing new under the sun.\n\nNg’ombe siru ina mkamiwe. An angry cow has its own person to milk it. Even the most stubborn of souls will have one person who can calm them down. It can be used to counsel those looking for spouses, they should seek the ones who are their peace or bring out the best in them.\n\nNyumba ya mndzaka taina hanga. In the house of a bachelor there is no mourning. Usually a wake-up call to young men taking too long to marry. If a bachelor dies, the funeral wake will be where the other members of his family are, for he has no wife or children for people to come and comfort. Bachelorhood is not celebrated.\n\nUkahomba moho ukaphya mivuzi. You had sex in the fire and your pubic hair got burnt. Sounds vulgar but wise counsel from the elders in African culture is not complete without cautioning against a life of sexual decadence and promiscuity. In this particular case, the proverb makes everyone fully aware, if not bluntly, of the existence of sexually transmitted infections (that have an itching or ‘burning’ effect) if one is not careful.\n\nAre these Digo proverbs relatable to some from your community? Please share some and let’s make it an African proverb telling week.\n\nWith gratitude to the Bible Translation and Literacy organization for their compilation of proverbs from Kenyan communities.\n\nHonouring Abdalla Mwasimba and traditional Swahili poetry.\n\nOn Wednesday night media houses reported that a literary great of the Swahili poetry genre, Abdalla Mwasimba, had passed on. He hailed from Matuga, Kwale County but found a second home in Kaloleni, Nairobi where he died on Tuesday evening. Born in 1937, his generation of Swahili poets had the art directly passed down to them by those in the 19th century who truly romanticized Swahili poetry from its 18th century beginnings. He was one of a dying breed who understood that it wasn’t enough to recite a poem reading through like an essay, it had to be sung. A fading art. This week’s post aims to celebrate his legacy by bringing back to life one of his memorable poems ‘Nini raha ya pombe?’, as well as celebrating Swahili poetry and its early towering giant proponents on whose shoulders Abdalla Mwasimba stood on.\n\nSalamu nyingi salamu, Nazituma waungwana,\n\nNazituma muadhamu, Ziwafikie vijana,\n\nKuna na watu makamu, Mabibi hata mabwana,\n\nWalevi nielezeni, Raha ya pombe ni nini?\n\nMlevi mwana wa watu, mwenye heshima na jina,\n\nMlevi kwake si kitu, mizozo na kugombana,\n\nMlevi sifa za utu, Kwake hazikulingana,\n\nWalevi nielezeni, Raha ya pombe ni nini?\n\nAlewae hujisifu, Mimi nina mali sana,\n\nNinazo mali lufufu, Nyumbani zimejazana,\n\nJirani tukimshufu, Kumbe ushindie dola,\n\nWalevi nielezeni, Raha ya pombe ni nini?\n\nMlevi akishalewa, Hana mkwe wala mwana,\n\nYoyote humtania, Kisha na kumtukana,\n\nSikazi neno kufyoa, Lisilo ncha na jina,\n\nWalevi nielezeni, Raha ya Pombe ni nini?\n\nPombe japo ni nduguyo, Njiani mmefatana,\n\nYataka mkaze moyo, Ndipo mtasikizana,\n\nKwa matusi atoayo, Budi mtasukumana,\n\nWalevi nielezeni, Raha ya pombe ni nini?\n\nMlevi yatakuuma, Eti kwamba natukana,\n\nSitukani ninasema, Tusijetukazozana,\n\nMlevi ni kama nyama, La hitilafu hakuna,\n\nWalevi nielezeni, Raha ya pombe ni nini?\n\nThe poem has four-line stanzas with the last line of every stanza ‘Walevi nielezeni, Raha ya pombe ni nini?’ being repeated to emphasize the poem’s main theme, which is self-explanatory. It also has rhyme schemes, with the mid rhyme and end rhyme rhyming in every stanza, creating a musical tone. All these characteristics are consistent with traditional Swahili poetry works, the earliest of which were written in Arabic script before missionaries introduced Latin/Roman script for writing Swahili language and of utenzi classification (describing heroic deeds).\n\nOne of the earliest known written Swahili poetry works is Utendi/Utenzi wa Tambuka (Tabuk is a city in Saudi Arabia), written in 1728 by Bwana Mwengo bin Athumani. The epic poem depicts the triumphs in battle of the early followers of Prophet Muhammad. The little that is known about Bwana Mwengo bin Athumani is that he wrote in the palace court of the Sultan of Pate, he notes in the poem that he was commissioned by the Sultan to write the epic. The poem covers a period of 628 to 1453 and depicts Ali ibn Abi Talib (cousin and son-in-law to Prophet Muhammad) as the main protagonist in victorious battles over the Byzantines (a continuation of the Roman empire) and their Emperor Heraclius.\n\nAnother early written Swahili poem and my personal favourite is Utenzi wa Shufaka (Poem of mercifulness). This poem’s writer is unknown, either they chose anonymity in name or sadly as fate would have it the legacy of their work was meant to outlive their name. The poem depicts Angel Jibrail/Jibril (Gabriel) and Angel Mikail (Michael) in disagreement over man’s compassion threshold. They agree that in the past man was full of compassion but Mikail believes those days are gone and presently man is cold-hearted. Jibril on the other hand keeps faith in humanity. They decide to test man by descending to earth, in Medina and taking up human form in two different capacities. Jibril as a severly ill man outside the mosque and Mikail as a healer in the marketplace. The local people pity Jibril and contribute money for him to go and see a healer. He requests they take him to a healer he knows in the marketplace, which they do. Once there, Mikail upon diagnosing Jibril, says he can heal him from the mysterious illness but only by using the blood of a young man offered in a sacrifise. Even further, the young man must be a surviving 7th born child in a family where the other 6 siblings died in infancy. Only one young man around Medina fits this description, Kassim, son to the wealthiest man in the locality. Again, unbelievably taking heed, the locals proceed to Kassim’s parents’ house to inform them of Jibril’s situation and the healer’s conditions for healing him. The parents sorrowfully agree to offer their son in sacrifise believing it could be his destiny to give his life to save another but on condition that Kassim himself agrees to it. The poet takes quite some time detailing Kassim’s parents’ heavy burden and their improbable selfness, only topped by Kassim himself agreeing to lay down his life for a total stranger. Kassim, his parents and the local people, all in sombre mood, head back to Mikail and Jibril where the former issues one last crashing condition…that Kassim’s father be the one to take his son’s life. He does so. The two angels vanish as Kassim’s parents and the people around Medina prepare for his funeral. Back in heaven, Mikail agrees with Jibril that humans still have incredible compassion in them. They both request God to resurrect Kassim. Impressed by the humanity in Medina, He agrees. Jibril and Mikail descend to Kassim’s parents’ home now taking the human form of travellers in need of food and drink. Even in the middle of their mourning, they help the two strangers. Their trials, tribulations and suffering come to an end here as the Angel Jibril invokes God to not only resurrect Kassim but also his other 6 siblings that died in infancy. The whole community rejoices at the miracle they’ve witnessed. The poem ends with Angels Jibril and Mikail however agreeing that the goodness and compassion witnessed in Medina will not be there in the far future, with vanity being the order of the day. The poet declares they are living in such a time.\n\nUtenzi wa Shufaka is considered by many to be the finest Swahili literary work of its age. Its only known living manuscript, in Arabic script, is held in the library of the German Oriental Society, a scholarly organization in Germany dedicated to study the languages and cultures of Asia, Oceania and Africa. It was sent there by Dr. Ludwig Krapf in 1854. In the ongoing efforts by Africans and other people of colour to have artefacts stolen from them and stored in museums in Europe and America returned home, I pray Utenzi wa Shufaka’s manuscript is one of the items we succeed in bringing back to our continent.\n\nWestern scholars initially categorised Swahili poetry as an Islamic genre, mostly because the plots depicted Islamic communities and had Quran references as seen in Utenzi/Utendi wa Tambuka and Utenzi wa Shufaka. But the 19th century generation of Swahili poets moved towards the secular, narrating issues of social and political interest. An example was Muyaka bin Mwinyi Haji al-Ghassaniy (1776-1840) from Mombasa who wrote on love, infidelity, sexual exploits of members of the Mombasa society of his time and societal issues.\n\nAbdalla Mwasimba falls into this category of poets who raised awareness on societal issues. He served the nation commendably as a radio presenter for the Voice of Kenya and on Idhaa ya Kiswahili, now Radio Taifa, reciting poems in his typical melodious fashion. He was one of those that carried classical Swahili poetry and literature into the modern era, a resolute defender of the fading genre, a role which now lacks an obvious replacement. I say fading because TV programmes like Sanaa ya Kiswahili on KBC that played a key role in keeping Swahili literature alive are not as popular today as they were in the 90s and early 2000s. Kudos to the new generation custodians of Swahili language and all its literary branches fighting the good fight on social media, you are the ones to keep the spirit of Abdalla Mwasimba alive. Like the great poets before him, he no longer belongs to us, he now belongs to the ages.\n\nArticle was made possible by researching the following articles:\n\nhttps://www.researchgate.net/publication/242291454_Critical_Artistry_in_Utenzi_wa_Shufaka by Hamsa Mustafa Njozi, University of Dar es Salaam, Tanzania.\n\nMuyaka bin Mwinyi Haji al-Ghassaniy: https://exhibits.lib.ku.edu/items/show/6015\n\nhttps://www.google.com/amp/s/mariam181.wordpress.com/2016/08/25/shairi-nini-raha-ya-pombe/amp/\n\nThe Shungwaya Mystery and Probable Origin of “Mgalla Muue na Haki Umpe”.\n\nGrateful for all the curiosity and interest on documenting our history, culture and heritage that readers have generated over the course of this blog. In time I will effectively research on all requested topics and much more, if God wills. On this week’s post I’ve zeroed in on the Shungwaya link as shared by the Mijikenda, Taita and Pokomo. As per readers’ requests, researched materials on the three communities seem not interacted with well enough on the digital space. Shungwaya of course is the melting pot of many cultures, chief among them being communities of Bantu alignment, as per conventional and examinable academic discourse and curricular in the country.\n\nIn many ways, Shungwaya is our Garden of Eden. Easily believed but hard to trace. Book of the Zenj/Kitab al Zanuj, a c. 1900 publication placed it on Southern Somalia’s coast, between River Juba and the Bur Gau inlet. Thomas Spear, a historian known for The Kaya Complex (1978) and Kenya’s Past: An Introduction to Historical Method in Africa (1981) works, who based a lot of his findings on the foundation of the Book of the Zenj is a staunch defender of the Shungwaya origin story. It is from Shungwaya that the Oromo/Galla community are said to have raided and expelled the Mijikenda, Pokomo, Taita and other Bantu communities (for other discourse away from this article I will refrain from using the term Galla, I will explain why down the article). The earliest out of Shungwaya were the Digo, who settled south of Mombasa and established the first kaya. The rest followed, the Pokomo settling in Tana River, the Taita moved inland tracking the Galana River to where they are presently settled in the Taita Hills. The rest of the Mijikenda went on their path continuing south to settle on various points between Malindi and Mombasa. The Mijikenda and Pokomo speak languages of the Sabaki subgroup of the Northeast Coastal Bantu, believed to have developed at some point when they were crossing the Kenya-Tanzania border heading to the Somalia coast. The Taita speak Dawida, of the Chagga subgroup and Saghala, of the Saghala/Pare subgroup of Northeast Coastal Bantu. Spear believes the Taita underwent a language change after migrating from Shungwaya and took to speaking their Dawida and Saghala tongues after settling among ‘Dawida speakers’ and ‘Saghala speakers’ they found in the Taita Taveta region. The Mijikenda can recall seven age sets from the time of their migration to the early 20th century, with each set approximated to have lasted 50 years. This puts their migration from Shungwaya somewhere in the mid-16th century, fitting Shungwaya’s timeline of existence from 12th to 17th century before its collapse.\n\nSome oral literature from the Mijikenda community as detailed by Thomas Spear points to the raiding and expulsion by the Oromo/Galla not as a result of needless aggression by the Galla but as revenge for one of their own killed by some members of the Bantu-speaking communities. The killing happened in what was believed to be an initiation ceremony for a certain age set, where a youth killed a member of the Galla tribe to prove his manhood.\n\nCould this be the origin of “Mgalla Muue na Haki Umpe”?\n\nIt is from that incident Thomas Spear notes, that the Galla tried to apply some form of restorative justice. They asked for ‘blood money’ in compensation for the killing from the Bantus, something you would think was a reasonable penalty for the magnitude of the crime. For some reason, probably the unwillingness to shoulder the burden of one person’s mistake, the Bantu communities failed to pay the compensation. The Galla took matters in their own hands and expelled the Bantu communities from Shungwaya.\n\nTo some historians, notably Morton and James De Vere Allen (described as one of the original historians in the African continent, he was brought up in Kenya by Australian parents), the Shungwaya origin story doesn’t hold water, especially as portrayed by Thomas Spear. For the Galla to have asked for ‘blood money’ there must have been such an agreement in the first place as to scales of compensation, if the communities existed in virtue. Almost an impossibility if the Galla were indeed the ones who were just the ‘new neighbours’ in Shungwaya. The time between their arrival to the area and them expelling the other communities would be too little to establish such agreements. And if indeed such scales of compensation had been agreed, why would the Bantus refuse to honour it knowing the resulting consequences would be dire?\n\nMorton alludes that the Shungwaya origin story in its present stature and link to Bantu communities was nowhere in people’s knowledge before 1895. He traces its first appearance in publication to the Book of the Zenj/Kitab al Zanuj c. 1900, which he in turn believes was an attempt to rewrite history. Written by Fadhili bin Omari, a court clerk in Malindi, the book glaringly omits the Segeju, a community who as equally to anyone else should have been part of the Shungwaya origin story if ever it was a realistic one. The Segeju have kinship relations to the Digo and the Bajun people. Morton claims Fadhili bin Omari was a Segeju himself and part-Pokomo but went ahead to describe himself and his al-Bauri family name as descendants of ‘high pedigree Arabs’ to hide his African ancestry and gain favour from British and Zanzibari officials. In the eyes of Morton, if the publication bears some intentional omissions or bias, why should its core subject matter be believed? Dr. Krapf did mention Shungwaya in 1848, where he believed to be the place of origin of all Swahilis, but his vision or idea of Shungwaya was a ruined town in the Lamu Archipelago opposite Pate Island, on the mainland. Another issue with Shungwaya is if it was such a sizeable state or civilization, why did the Portuguese never mention it in text but Malindi and its inhabitants featured heavily in their records during the same time Shungwaya is believed to have been in existence? Morton offers an alternative origin theory, that the communities developed or originated from close to where they presently are, in Mangea/ Mt. Mangea, a sizeable hill west of Malindi. Plausible?\n\nNow to my reasons for refraining to use the Galla name for the Oromo people. The Oromo believe it to be a derogatory term coined from Abyssinian tongue to mean someone uncultured, uncivilized or an outright savage. The Oromo themselves believe they are the native inhabitants of Eastern Africa and that all stories of their aggression and invasions were fabricated by Abyssinian rulers, court historians and monks to paint them as newcomers. For instance, the tale of the Galla invasion of Ethiopia was first put in text in 1590 by an Abyssinian monk called Bahrey who begins his writings with the line, “I have begun to write the history of the Galla in order to make known the number of their tribes, their readiness to kill people and the brutality of their manners…”. So did the Oromo ever take up arms or show aggression? The Oromo agree they did, but in the spirit of a national liberation movement to liberate themselves from European-aided Abyssinian occupation of their legitimate land, never as raids or invasions in Ethiopia or elsewhere. It is a sensitive subject that requires wisdom in approach. In that spirit, to mitigate the severed relations, I feel the wisest thing would be to drop the Galla name that seems to some evoke nothing but pain in some.\n\nWith myself lacking any scholarly standing to authoritatively declare what is true or false from the whole Shungwaya origin story and that of the Oromo people, I can deem the whole experience reading through it as a cautionary tale. If we don’t adequately document our own history, someone else will, and sometimes not with the best intentions. We are presently living our future generations’ history, let’s strive to correctly capture it and save them the agony of assumptions and fabrications.\n\nThe article was possible by researching through works of Martin Walsh and James de Vere Allen as they dissected Thomas Spear’s Shungwaya and Morton’s total doubt of it.\n\nSources:\n\nMijikenda Origins: A Review of the Evidence, a journal by Martin Walsh.\n\nReview: Shungwaya, the Mijikenda, and the Traditions, by James de Vere Allen.\n\nThe Oromo People: https://scholar.harvard.edu/erena/oromo\n\nBehind The Music; Malaika, Fundi Konde and His Guitar.\n\nThe unfortunate thing about telling the story of legends who came up at a time when documenting history as it happened wasn’t exactly our forte is that you will probably miss out on crediting some of the supporting cast or originators that helped set up the legends’ paths to greatness. This is especially the case when revisiting our early music where intentionally (the entertainment industry is a cut-throat business) or unintentionally, a lot of early pioneers’ efforts have gone unrecognised, especially on the songwriting leg of the journey. As a result, there have always been undertones about what is really what and what isn’t when honouring the great musicians from the early generation. The song Malaika for instance has a number of ‘owners’, from here all the way to Tanzania. Fadhili William Mdawida, the music great from Kenya’s Coast, is widely acknowledged as the first to record Malaika in 1960, together with his band Jambo Boys but over the years some sort of middle ground has been reached to allow Adam Salim from Tanzania the honour of being the first to write the original version of the song in 1945, and to be fair, Adam Salim’s backstory fits the Malaika lyrics like a glove to a hand. Other Malaika claimants like Lucas Tututu from Mombasa and Grant Charo haven’t had such as strong a case. Staying in Nairobi and working as a mechanic in 1945-1946, Adam Salim fell in love with a girl, Halima Ramadhani Maruwa. Still a young man in search of a meaningful life, Halima’s parents would disapprove of him as their daughter’s suitor and marry her off to a wealthy established man. For one who took such a blow, it’s only right that his pain, which luckily for us was expressed through the gift of songwriting, was recognised hand-in-hand with Fadhili William’s recording-worthy voice. Fadhili William himself had to take a back seat and watch the South African songstress Miriam Makeba propel Malaika to far greater heights with the song ending up being synonymous with her, Harry Belafonte and Boney M on the global stage. Invited to perform in Kenya by Tom Mboya in the early years of the nation coming to birth, Miriam Makeba would be coached in Swahili by veteran musician David Amunga in readiness to converse and perform, a victory for the language (think Sho Madjozi). Having had her put through listening to Malaika so she could perform it on stage as his own personal wish, the charismatic politician would also leave a lasting mark on the song. Tom Mboya hurriedly scribbled the lyrics to the song on a piece of paper for Makeba, mixing up two songs. He mistakenly added the catchy “pesa zasumbua roho yangu” line that was absent in the earlier versions of the song. The line came from Fadhili William’s other song by the name ‘Pesa Zasumbua Roho Yangu’. Miriam Makeba would run with this fitting new addition.\n\n‘Pesa zasumbua roho yangu\n\nNami nifanyeje, kijana mwenzio\n\nNashindwa na mali sina we\n\nNingekuoa Malaika‘ – the verse carrying the additional ‘Pesa zasumbua roho yangu’ line.\n\nThe same music industry realities and tussles faced Fundi Konde and his music, with one of his famous songs Ajali Haikingiki having its ownership contested by Paul Mwachupa and Henry Timothy Mwanyae. It is important to note that the above mentioned names contesting these famous songs either rightfully or fuelled by the desire to share in the glory, were in most cases not strangers to one other and were all accomplished musicians in their own right. Adam Salim claimed Fadhili William was his protégé singing in the Nairobi nightclubs in the 50s, Grant Charo claimed he first recorded Malaika in a band, with Fadhili William playing the mandolin. Paul Mwachupa too performed with Fundi Konde on numerous occasions. It gives credence to betrayal as an inherent part of the entertainment business, just as they say it is in love. It is more than likely that they collaborated in making these masterpieces, it is the degree to which that happened that varied and will forever be up for debate. Amidst all these uncertainties, the Kilifi-born Fundi Konde has his stature as a pioneer of Kenyan contemporary music cast in stone, his timeline of influencing music on our shores can be well traced. It is prudent to put in ‘contemporary’ because it is impossible to trace our musical history before the recording generation and I must be careful not to discredit Taarab with its history dating back to the 19th century. Music is almost as old as speech and language, and transcended the drum, itself notably a 5500 BC creation. As for Taarab, to really put the genre in correct context and rightful honour as per its depth, richness in culture and heritage, i’ll say that if tracing the history of Kenyan contemporary music was an essay, then Taarab would be a PhD thesis. I have nowhere near enough researched knowledge to be an authority on Taarab on this blog, hopefully with the help of others, a day will come that I will have a voice on the genre. Until such a time, I will revere it from a distance.\n\nI look for two things when rating music, the storytelling aspect and a musician’s ability to play an instrument (sorry, it is what it is). Why the bias? My view is that for a musician to be regarded as truly great, they must be scholarly, learning all that pertains to their craft. Mastering a musical instrument is a big part of that. It explains why many people I’ve come across feel that my music taste is trapped in a time warp somewhere in the past, I find modern day music mostly hard to love, finding the two features merged has become a rarity. You now get a picture why I easily took to researching Fadhili William, Fundi Konde while labelling Taarab as a daunting task, it’s because I’ve been a fan of the two music legends for many years. They perfectly fit my idea of musical greatness. Same goes for Mzee Joseph Ngala (a favourite of mine), Them Mushrooms and others. I will endeavour to give the latter two roses while they can still smell them, featuring their works in future posts on the blog.\n\nFundi Konde’s musical instrument playing ability has gone down in lore and legend. He was the first man from East Africa to record music playing the electric guitar, which he purchased after coming from South Asia where as a member of the Entertainment Unit of the Kings African Rifles he entertained fellow soldiers during World War II. By 1945, his unit had already performed 350 shows and recorded 10 songs at Dum Dum Studios in Calcutta, notes The Guardian’s Graeme Ewens. That he became a sound engineer in his later years is testament to his scholarly approach to music. The storytelling in his music is also worth anyone’s ear and time, Ajali Haikingiki is a notable reference.\n\n“Ni chombo imara chenye thamani, kilichopasishwa Uingerezani, kilinguruma Likoni kikatiririka, wale pasenja wakafelea baharini…” A verse in Fundi Konde’s ‘Ajali Haikingiki’.\n\nIn the song he details a tragedy at the Likoni channel which for many years has been without a face, at least to me and I’m sure many others. For years we only got to feel for Dereva Kombo, the only casualty of the tragedy mentioned in the song. I traced the song’s backstory to a tragedy that befell the Verjee family. Coming from a wedding in Tanga, Tanzania, the vehicle carrying members of the Verjee family skid through the ferry and into the Indian Ocean. A member of the Verjee family was seeking information on the tragedy in a 2010 edition of the Old Africa magazine. I’ve seen efforts to help his cause on Facebook, where he has recognised Fundi Konde’s Ajali Haikingiki as a fitting tribute.\n\nSome of Fundi Konde’s other notable works are Majengo Siendi Tena, Kipenzi Waniua Ua and Tausi Ndege Wangu. In all these songs he borrowed from the Cuban styles of beloro, chacha and rumba. That’s the beauty of history, the more you dig, the more you find, most times finding channels that you were not even initially after. That is exactly the case here, as I found Brazilian beautiful football origins in slavery and African N’golo/Engolo roots in my blog post tracing early Kenyan football influences in Mombasa and beyond, so did I find Cuban rumba’s origins in slavery, oppression and the African Abakuá and Yuka. Rumba was a disguised form of protest and just getting by for the enslaved Africans who arrived in Cuba in as early as the 16th century. It is a broad subject to be serialized. In Fundi Konde’s case he merged the Cuban influences from his time serving in the Kings African Rifles and his early music knowledge from a Catholic school in Waa where he learnt to read music and play the flute. Even prior to joining the King’s African Rifles, Fundi Konde was a small-time musician at the Coast, performing in joints where palm wine flowed in plenty, Graeme Ewens deduces. He couldn’t combine the music by night and his day job at the department of health and was fired. A blessing in disguise because it is shortly after that he decided to join the King’s African Rifles. It gave our music landscape a chance to experience a Fundi Konde-fuelled by Cuban influences.\n\nThere is too much history, culture and heritage in music for someone to be allowed to make bad music. People like Fundi Konde, Paul Mwachupa, Henry Timothy Mwanyae, Fadhili William, Grant Charo and Lucas Tututu dedicated their whole lives to the art. By all means sing, it’s well within your rights as stipulated in the Kenyan Constitution but if you are embarking on the professional music path please put in the work that these masters and many others put in. If we couldn’t give them roses while they could still smell them, let us at least live up to the incredibly high standards that they set.\n\nThe article was made possible through reviewing other researchers’ work on the subject:\n\nGrame Ewens’ Fundi Konde eulogy: https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.theguardian.com/news/2000/jul/21/guardianobituaries\n\nOyunga Pala’s Tracing the Roots of Benga: https://www.theelephant.info/culture/2017/10/19/tracing-the-roots-of-benga/\n\nhttps://spinditty.com/genres/Malaika-Song-and-the-Age-Long-Theme-of-Love-Poverty-and-Rivalry\n\nTracing Early Kenyan Football’s Roots in Mombasa and Beyond.\n\nI stumbled on the above photo on Coastweek magazine a few months ago and I’ve been trying to research on early football in Kenya ever since, with a focus on how the Coast influenced it, or pioneered it if you prefer. I was impressed by how well-organised and managed they looked for a football team in Kenya in the 1930s. Also, if they had trophies on display then there must have been rival football clubs to them at the time, most likely just as competitive and well-organised. Sadly, there has been little or no information on them and their then rivals available, so far. We will hopefully change that by welcoming a concerted research effort of writer and readers, with any possible corrections from readers just as key to the process. A certain Captain Musa M. Ittiso had sent the photo to Coastweek magazine on behalf of the Burke family to rectify an error and seek assistance, the photo had first appeared on the cover of a 2013 edition of the Old Africa magazine but had wrongfully labelled Mr. James A. C. Burke as the gentleman on the left. An understandable error because the gentleman on the left is white and would match the English name. Luckily, the real Mr. Burke had his descendants alive, with one of his granddaughters living in Mombasa, thus prompting the correction. James A. C. Burke hailed from Trinidad and Tobago and was educated in Britain, most probably where the seeds of what we assume to be a football managerial career were planted. He came to Kenya in the 1920s to practise law (on one occasion he was remembered and honoured posthumously for his contribution to the legal practice in Mombasa, with his grandson presented a token and a photo of his grandfather at the Mombasa High Court) and was known to be a proficient swimmer, swimming across the channel from Mombasa Club to English Point. He died in Kenya in 1947. However, the identification process ends there, with the Burke family themselves seeking any possible information on the 1930s Mombasa team Mr. Burke was involved with.\n\nMy first thought on where more information on early football in Mombasa could be found was Mombasa Sports Club, having been founded in 1896 surely there must have been some form of early football records despite the club being cricket-predominant at the time. I found more than I had hoped for. On Mombasa Sports Club’s history page, there is record of a football match on October 8th, 1904 between Europeans and CMS Boys, the freed slaves from the Church Mission Society Settlement in Frere Town, a match which CMS Boys won. “It was a bit hot for Europeans and on the Sahara Desert sports ground the advantage went to those not wearing shoes”, describes the official match report. Remarkable.\n\n“This is a grant in perpetuity, free of cost, by Salim bin Khalfan, Liwali of Mombasa, to Sir Arthur Henry Hardinge (Her Majesty’s Commissioner and Consul General of East Africa Protectorate) and to Ralph Bertie Peter Cator (HM Judge) and others, as Trustees of Mombasa Sports Club”, reads the original title deed of Mombasa Sports Club as highlighted on their history page.\n\nAs previously highlighted in my poem ‘It tolls for thee; The Frere people and the historic Kengeleni bell’ in this blog last week, the freed slaves in Frere Town had roots in Nyasaland (Malawi), Mozambique, Zambia and Zimbabwe. And it’s in Mozambique where I feel could be the origin of the football knowledge and I assume style that the CMS Boys had to outsmart the British in that particular match, resilience to the sweltering heat of Mombasa notwithstanding. This based on me being a lifelong student of the game of football and its history. It must have taken a unique effort to beat the founders of the game, when the game was still in its infancy in the country. I attribute this to the fact that Africa’s greatest football export, Eusébio da Silva Ferreira, fondly referred to as Panthera Negras (Black Panther), came from Maputo, Mozambique. He went on to play for Portugal and would score a whooping 733 goals in 745 matches in his professional career. Notably, 473 goals in 440 matches for his beloved Benfica and 41 goals in 64 matches for his adopted nation. He won the Ballon d’Or in 1965, and was runner-up in 1962 and 1966. If you have watched footage of Eusébio you will notice that he combined flair with great athleticism, raw power and a trademark ferocious right-footed shot. It’s the flair bit that I feel could give further credence to my thinking that the football played in Kenya’s Coast has Mozambican roots.\n\nCoastal football in Kenya, Mombasa notably, has a distinctive style from that played in other parts of the country. Leisurely played on the sandy beaches, it prioritises flair and flamboyance over an ‘ends justify the means’ result-driven approach. Given an opportunity, the average football fan in Mombasa would sign a mercurial Neymar over a work-horse N’golo Kante for their team any given day, and twice on Sunday. Nutmegs (chobo) are received with great excitement by the crowd, kanzu even more so. I think it’s Mombasa’s famous son in football coaching circles, Twahir Muhiddin, who once commented post-match, “Japo wametufunga, vyenga tuliwala” (They might have won, but we constantly dribbled past them/played the more sleek football). The tag line is Mombasa Raha after all, no time for unpalatable dull football. It’s no wonder that during every FIFA World Cup, outside the favelas of Rio de Janeiro and the country boundaries of Brazil itself, you’d find the next loyal supporters of the Brazilian national team in Old Town Mombasa and Kisauni. Their flowery style resonates with what the locals here consider football in its purest form. Therein lies a common link from my Eusébio and Mozambique inference, the Brazilian Ginga.\n\nMozambique was ruled by the Portuguese for over 4 centuries, Brazil ruled by the same colonial master for a little over 3 centuries. Beginning in the 16th century, very many slaves were taken from Angola and Mozambique to the vast sugarcane plantations in Brazil taking with them their culture, a piece of it being the Capoeira. The Capoeira was a form of martial arts that fused fighting and dancing. The Capoeira itself is likened to the Angolan N’golo/Engolo, a spiritual dance providing a link to the afterlife, channeling ancestors in the dance that involves kicking, slap boxing and walking with one’s hands. The powers that be wary of the enslaved practising martial arts, banned the Capoeira. But it would find a rebirth in football through the Ginga. The Ginga (literally meaning rocking back and forth) is the fundamental footwork of Capoeira. They would continue practising the Capoeira through the ground movements of Ginga in the pretence of being totally focused on playing football not knowing they were developing a style that would conquer the football world for generations.\n\nThe British may rightfully claim to be the originators of football with its present set of rules globally, and the game was indeed introduced to Brazil by a Scotsman (Thomas Donohoe) but it’s the Brazilians who took the game to another supernatural dimension through Ginga. The British founding the game in Kenya is also not in doubt, Mombasa Sports Club as a platform for the growth of the game as we’ve seen, came to be from the wily British way of having natives of lands they colonised ‘hospitably’ offering their land to them. But there’s a mystery or a missing link somewhere, the British style is too workman-like and rigid for them to have been the proponents of the brand of football played in Mombasa and its environs. My sentimental self prefers the freed slaves from Mozambique link. The CMS boys might not have beaten the British with a refined Ginga style, but they certainly could have with athleticism and natural flair born from their upbringing around Capoeira/Engolo practise.\n\nI know some fanatics of Gor Mahia F.C (who I support) and AFC Leopards would probably ask, if Coastal football has such a rich heritage why is it that it is they who went on to dominate Kenyan football and not teams from the Coast? My answer would be that Coastal dominance was definitely witnessed on the national football scene even though short-lived. The now defunct Feisal F.C (founded in 1940) won the Kenyan Premier League in 1965, on the 3rd year of the league’s formation. They shared a great rivalry with Liverpool F.C Mombasa (which was later renamed Mwenge), with Liverpool F.C Mombasa finishing second to Feisal F.C when they won the Kenyan Premier League in 1965.\n\nWhile Feisal were predominantly Swahili, Liverpool had an Indian and Goan influence (Goa itself was ruled by the Portuguese for four and a half centuries, giving another possible angle of shared cultures between the Portuguese colonies, through trade both in goods and humans). Setting the tone for the kind of community rivalry that propels the growth of football in a country, think Liverpool and Everton in England or Celtic and Rangers in Scotland. Gor Mahia and AFC Leopards would follow suit. Feisal F.C and Liverpool F.C Mombasa’s influence transcended the club scene, they provided key players to Kenya’s national side. Liverpool F.C Mombasa’s great Goan goalkeeper and captain Albert Castanha, nicknamed ‘The Cat’, represented Kenya in both football and athletics. He is widely regarded as the greatest all-round Kenyan athlete of Goan ancestry. Feisal F.C gave to the nation the dynamic duo of Ali Sungura and Ali Kajo. Ali Kajo notably scored the last goal for Kenya Colony and the first goal for the new Republic of Kenya. They are just a few examples of the players from the two clubs that went on to represent the nation, I will hopefully highlight more.\n\n“Then there was Ali Kajo who played at the centre…everyone knew he was lazy and hated to run. The rest of the team just fed him the ball as he grudgingly ran to the edge of the penalty area, where if it was given to him on the plate, two to three feet from his right leg, he could kick it so sweetly it would fly five feet off the ground and even burst through the older fraying parts of the net. The crowd would go wild even as the ground staff rushed to darn the net.” Ali Kajo as described by Hartman de Souza (a Goan who lived in Kenya as a boy in the 1950s and 1960s) in his memoirs featured in Cyprian Fernandes’ ‘Stars Next Door’.\n\nThe reason why the Coastal dominance of the football scene was short-lived is up for debate but I suspect that the hands-on British influence on the game locally, that came a few decades after Mr. James A. C. Burke and his Mombasa Football Club of the 1930s, could have played a part. Ray Bachelor, an Englishman, became Kenya’s first manager in 1961 and would later manage Nakuru AllStars, leading them to winning the inaugural Kenyan Premier League in 1963. This was a time British football was thriving, with England winning the World Cup in 1966, Celtic from Scotland winning the European Cup (now the Champions League) in 1967 and England’s Manchester United winning it the year after. With the pragmatic British style of efficiency over exuberance reaping rewards, it could be that Ray Bachelor laid the ground for dismissing the flamboyance of Coastal football as an effective way of winning. It could also be that those who were picked for the national side from the Coast were asked to drop their mesmerizing Ginga lest their places went to someone else, and would probably slowly rub the loss in identity to their teammates back at club level when they went back. Even at club level British influence gradually increased with Feisal F.C even having a Scotsman among their ranks leading up to the 1960s, Jimmy Linden, an expatriate who worked as a technical manager at the cement factory in Bamburi and went on to be capped by the Kenya national team. Linden is remembered by Hartman de Souza as a hit with the crowd adept at playing the ball further forward and jumping over tackles to get to it, the crowd nicknamed him Beberu, in a fond way. Feisal F.C’s solitary league title win in 1965 was sadly Coastal football in its dying embers. It remains the one and only league win by a team from the Coast, to date.\n\nThe flamboyant football and talent in Mombasa remains in abundance but I feel it’s the belief that the style can indeed conquer all on the national scene once again that is gone. If I never get to see a league title won by a Coastal team in my lifetime, at least I am certain of one thing, I will always be presented with the chance to use Twahir Muhiddin’s words, “Japo wametufunga, vyenga tuliwala”.\n\nThe article was made possible in no small part thanks to:\n\nCoastweek Magazine and Cyprian Fernandes writing on the Goan influence in Liverpool F.C Mombasa.\n\nMombasa Sports Club’s detailed history.\n\nGinga and Capoeira history detailed here by Amrisha Parashar: https://www.redbull.com/in-en/ginga-%E2%80%93-the-brazilian-lifestyle#:~:text=The%20origins%20of%20this%20football,came%20from%20Angola%20and%20Mozambique.\n\nHistorian Dr. Desch-Obi detailing Capoeira and its origins.\n\nHartman de Souza memoirs in Cyprian Fernandes’ ‘Stars Next Door’: https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.scroll.in/article/883054/as-a-goan-child-growing-up-in-kenya-in-the-1950s-i-saw-football-change-and-history-being-made\n\nIt tolls for thee; The Frere people and the historic Kengeleni bell.\n\nThe bell tolls for thee, a poem was once told,\n\nTo warn a people Sir Henry Bartle Frere-freed, in a Frere Town thus called,\n\nOf Arab slave traders oncoming, with hearts brute and cold,\n\nFrom Nyasaland they came, Mbotela a popular name,\n\nA Frere tribe now known, in all but official name.\n\nInhumanely treated from land to sea, the bell a welcome safeguard,\n\nTo toll from Kengeleni to Kisimani, the final rearguard,\n\nSlavery was later gone, so came a Church in tow,\n\nThe bell to now summon, a people in prayerful bow,\n\nAll of 300 kgs in weight of history and copper, its myth would grow.\n\nOften as things go, the bell would have a price,\n\nWith muted tolls it would go, a molten prize belittled in worth,\n\nAlmost 200 years of history gone, a bell signifying a community’s birth,\n\nThen came a replica, for hopefully 200 years more, in an area now seemingly patrolled,\n\nThat too would go, in circumstances inadequately probed.\n\nA culture punitively robbed, from a people deservedly freed,\n\nWith little hue and cry, from a society now accustomed to greed,\n\nThere is no respite from suffering, for a people stolen from Nyasaland,\n\nFor they must denounce their heritage, to really belong to this motherland,\n\nA bell will finally toll to close an eroded chapter, for a Frere tribe so constantly wronged by enslaver to modern-day captor.\n\nFootnotes:\n\nFrere Town is in present-day Kisimani area, Mombasa, a settlement for freed slaves rescued from Arab slave traders by the British Royal Navy in the 19th century while aboard Arab slave vessels on their way to the slave market in Zanzibar. The slaves were stolen from Tanganyika and lands as far as Nyasaland (Malawi), Mozambique, Zambia and Zimbabwe. The settlement was named after British colonial administrator Sir Henry Bartle Frere, who helped in suppressing the Zanzibar slave trade.\n\nThe historic bell at Kengeleni was used to warn the locals of advancing Arab slave ships and slave raids. It was later used as a call to Church and prayer to the ACK Emmanuel Church (completed in 1889), just opposite the site of the bell, for those that adopted Christianity. The original bell weighed 300 kgs and was made of copper. Both the original and the replica that replaced it were stolen.\n\nOf the 600 acres bought by Sir Henry Bartle Frere for the settlement of the freed slaves, only close to 50 acres remains for the Frere community, in Kisimani area, with the community blaming successive governments for grabbing their land. The settlement initially stretched all the way to Nyali, Mkomani and Kongowea area.\n\nThe Frere tribe have never been officially recognised by the Kenyan government, with them having to associate with Mijikenda roots during application for ID cards, their Nyasa roots are not acknowledged. All this despite having many prominent Frere descendants like Leonard Mambo Mbotela, Bango maestro Mzee Joseph Ngala and former parliamentarian Joe Khamisi.\n\nThe timeline of events and images was captured through readings from DW’s ‘Documenting Frere Town’s slave history for the next generation’ (Diana Wanyonyi) and Herman Kiriama’s publication ‘The Landscapes of Slavery in Kenya’: https://doi.org/10.1080/21619441.2019.1589711\n\nRekindled love; My day with Kisauni’s Bilima Youth FC.\n\n“Ana mguu mzuri wa kushoto lakini hajajua kuutumia vizuri”, a voice comes from the other side of the technical bench. It’s the voice of coach Ali, reacting to a missed scoring opportunity by one of his players, he feels he should have comfortably put the ball away with his left foot after a great through ball from midfield. It’s Sunday morning, some minutes to 8am and we’re midway through the first half of the game. I’m a very late sleeper on every other day of the week and my Saturday nights and Sunday mornings are usually for paying my sleep correction debt, that i’m here this early means this is something special. The level of dedication by the technical bench and the players to be ready for a game at this time of the day, almost every Sunday, is of paid professionals’ level but that’s not the case. The next voice paints you a clearer picture of the exact reality…“Na wameenda wapi kina Katilaa? Walikuwa hapa saa hii tu. Ama wameenda kwa mama wa kuuza mitai? Ndiyo mambo yao sana”, the team manager Sylvester ‘Rambo’ Omala reacts upon no longer seeing a few faces next to the bench that were supposed to be putting on bibs and preparing to warm up. At the mention of mitai, which are pastries popular at the Coast that go well with tea, and the stealthy disappearance of some to go and get them before hurrying back, you realise this is not an adult set-up all through but a few grown-ups mentoring children. Children who occasionally lose the fight to their sweet tooth weaknesses.\n\nI’m at Bilima ground, Bakarani (in Kisauni) at Rambo’s invitation, seated on the technical bench (for complete imagery, old tires dug halfway into the ground) next to him, coach Ali and coach Dulla. We’re watching Bilima Youth under 16 team. In truth, some are closer to age 12 than they are to 16 and would be part of the under 12 set-up were it not for high dexterity with the ball at their feet. They are just so good in comparison to their agemates that it would be detrimental to their football development to constantly pit them against far lesser opposition. It’s been an open invitation for me to come and watch the team for quite some time. But a mixture of unavailability and general disillusionment by the game (i’m a long-suffering Arsenal fan, a vicious cycle of disappointment has that effect on you) meant it’s almost a year later that I’m honouring it. The game ends in a 2-2 draw and i’m greatly impressed by ‘Ramos’. He dealt with the pressure from far stronger, taller and older opponents (some had their chins looking well-acquainted to the Bic shaving razor) with both great awareness and a sneaky side to his game. They all have aliases based on their on-pitch strengths, similar to the famous footballers they are named after. ‘Suarez’, ‘Iniesta’, ‘Pogba’ and ‘Messi’ are some of the others. I miss out on seeing ‘Iniesta’ in action (out with a groin injury, though I have previously seen bewitching video footage of him sent to me by ‘Rambo’), ‘Pogba’ and ‘Messi’ (who i’m informed is the team’s star player but is in Kaloleni with his parents).\n\n“If they are good enough then they are old enough.” – Legendary Manchester United manager Sir Matt Busby.\n\nAs they warm down after the game, coach Ali relays the coming week’s schedule. He noticed they were quick off the blocks at the start of the game but ran out of ‘gas’ towards the end, so it’s going to be ‘loading’ week…enhancing their fitness levels through intense training. He enquires on everyone’s availability and one player asks to be excused, he is the one to look after his little brother the coming week as his parents go to work. To which coach Ali promises to speak to the boy’s parents on the issue (hinting he will request his wife to look after the little kid so his player doesn’t miss training). It’s the first introduction to how much of a family unit Bilima Youth team are. The morning part of Bilima Youth team’s day is done and they part, to be back at 2pm for the under 12 side’s game. It is a requirement for every member of the youth set-up to be there, even the under 16s, playing or not.\n\nCoach Ali invites me to his home, just a short distance from the field, to have tea and mahamri, where ‘Rambo’ is a regular, as are the kids. While there I understand why it was easy for him to hint that his wife could help out in baby-sitting. She is just as madly in love with football as her husband and willing to make sacrifices for the sake of Bilima Youth team. Sacrifices that have included taking in Samson ‘Messi’ Ngala on school days, with his parents living far away in Kaloleni, ensuring better schooling and close football nurturing. Also, willingly letting a corner of her home be literally turned into something similar to a football club’s boot room. Coach Ali is always shopping for second hand football boots for the team, a few pairs are never enough, every pair will come in handy. Her knowledge of the game as I noticed through our talks over brunch can put many to shame, pointing out some of the players’ strengths and weaknesses in great detail, from games she has attended. That she also gets medals as part of the coaching set-up is entirely deserved.\n\n‘Rambo’ then takes me through the youth set-up’s history, Bilima team has been there as a local team entity for years but it’s only 3 years ago that they moulded the youth set-up into a serious entity, with the end goal being youth empowerment and bringing hope back to Kisauni. He tells of how they lost their first game 8-0 (a time when they hadn’t known each player’s strengths and suitability in different positions) and his promise to the other team’s coach that every time they meet there will be a decrease in the goal deficit, upto a point there will be no overwhelming favourites in matches between the two. It came to pass, they beat the team now on the odd occasion, an inspiring tale. They have gone on to win many tournaments, some bringing rewards and others false or unfulfilled promises, from private and government would-be sponsors alike. As with any volunteering initiative (the coaching staff all have other jobs and hustles, speaking volumes of their dedication to use their spare time to nurture the team with no financial reward), there have been challenges, mostly in funding…football boots and other training equipment have to be bought, snacks too. There have also been invites to tournaments in Turkey and Sweden, tournaments that could hold the key to unlocking the kids’ futures. Despite the challenges in raising funds for the travel (now put on hold due to Covid 19), he maintains they will achieve the target, somehow. He is a resilient character, listening to him I take heart as well. Of all their victories, to him the one that will live long in memory is managing to secure fee scholarships for some of the players, Serani Secondary School notably being of great help here. Noble. The manager and coaches have never let education take a back seat.\n\nWe go back to the field for the afternoon under 12’s game and here ‘Suarez’ spares no time to impress, striking the crossbar from the edge of the box with the goalkeeper left flat-footed. All this while carrying a niggling knee injury, i’m told. At this point i’m Bilima Youth team through and through, having had the team’s DNA ingrained in me through the day. I get a little carried away cheering on the team, it had been long since this happened. We (yes, we) shortly after concede from a counter-attack and I get somewhat worried by how we’re playing out the ball from the back after going a goal down and try to make a point to ‘Rambo’. He responds that the under 12’s game is generally to give the players confidence in their game, no disappointment with whatever result, the children will play how they know. I’m so used to seeing Arsenal capitulate in these circumstances and completely self-destruct but there’s no David Luiz here. The playing out from the back style, unfazed, is vindicated. It draws out the opposition and we hit back with two swift counter-attacks of our own, later slowing down the pace of the game and ultimately winning 2-1. There are no overly-joyous celebrations by the team, it’s just another day at the office.\n\n“When you start supporting a football club, you don’t support it because of the trophies, or a player, or history, you support it because you found yourself somewhere there; found a place where you belong.” – Arsenal legend Dennis Bergkamp.\n\nI pull aside coach Ali and ‘Rambo’ to congratulate them on what they have going here and inform them that if their invitation to me was meant to have an honorary ambassador for a day, then they gained more…a fan for a lifetime. They rekindled my love for the beautiful game. They saved the day. Not all heroes wear capes, sometimes they wear little football boots. I leave, softly singing Ferré Gola’s song Vita Imana…“ekomi lokola ndembo ya makolo imana na vita eh BILIMA na Mazembe, sanga balende lipopo”…loosely translated to “love has become a rivalry, like a football match between AS Bilima in Kinshasa and TP Mazembe (two teams that enjoyed a great rivalry in DRC)”. One day we will sing songs referencing the greatness of Kisauni’s Bilima and i’ll be there for it.\n\nThe team manager Sylvester ‘Rambo’ Omala is on Twitter: @Fundraizzer\n\nContact him with ideas of training drills or any form of support you would wish to uplift Bilima Youth FC with.\n\nYouth and ethical blogging, internet use.\n\nI learnt of @AfroBloggers and their noble #WinterABC2020 challenge to promote Africa’s emerging voices on Twitter recently, writing on a given topic each day. This happens to be day 15 of the 22-day challenge and I’m late to the party but I’m jumping on board as a new entrant regardless. Today’s topic is writing about an issue that is so close to your heart. I’ve decided to champion the cause of ethical internet use by the youth, something I feel we can all resonate with and that can also have history judge us harshly if we fail to adhere to.\n\nBy the universe’s own doing, every generation is suited to the needs of the environment present at the time. Our great-grandparents and those that came before them had great knowledge of the natural environment because from it came everything that constituted a full life in their day, including nature’s ability to heal. The generation that came after them had interaction with education, in the western sense, aptly fitting the vocational opportunities that came with the needs of the rising urban centres. Television later came for the next generation, giving a clear glimpse of distant lands and foreign cultures previously imagined through radio and books. Feeding that curiosity bore the adventurous spirit of travel, that is tourism in its present behemoth state, an industry in itself.\n\nGoing by that same yardstick, the internet is this generation’s adaptability tool to present society’s ever-growing needs. While almost everyone now has a brush with the internet in their day-to-day lives, Whatsapp and its exaggerated cautionary messages from the elderly (God bless their innocent internet souls) is living testament, it’s the young who are most adept at its use. But with great power comes great responsibility. And that is what the internet is, a powerful tool that can drive change but at the same time something with the potential to set back a generation’s progress if used unethically.\n\nIf the youth have any doubt about the change they can bring, they only need to go back to many liberation movements across Africa. Most were driven by the hot-bloodedness of youth. It certainly was the case in Kenya during the armed struggle where our most famous class of heroes, the Mau Mau, included key youthful figures like Musa Mwariama who was 24 and Muthoni Kirima, 21, in 1952 (the year the British government declared a state of emergency). Most of the other fighters were barely in their 30s at the time, with the leader Dedan Kimathi being only 32. The forest is no longer the most important political asylum within Africa, neither is the bullet an answer to the problems we currently face but those to shape their countries’ destinies remain the young, smartphone in hand.\n\nThere’s a lot of good that has come from the internet in Africa, blogging for instance. Travel blogging and vlogging has made many young Africans cultural goodwill ambassadors of their countries in everything but official title. Fashion and lifestyle bloggers have brought back the embrace of African fabric and style. Food bloggers, with their recipes of both local and global cuisines, have helped snatch glorious kitchen victories from the jaws of hapless cooking defeat in many homes. The art of storytelling has been kept alive through creative writing blogs, reliving our ancestors’ victories of yore, bringing honour back to our people. Same goes for those blogging on fitness, business, ‘Do It Yourself’ tutorials…the positive examples are endless.\n\nBut there have been downsides to internet use as well, not least during high political temperatures in a country. Africa being how it presently is, that’s almost every other day. It’s always election time somewhere in Africa, or something close to it. The kind of negative internet use and blogging that involves selling your soul, literally. For a few coins, we trend hashtags to tarnish named political adversaries of the paying master, regardless of what they stand for. Or getting paid to trend hashtags to sanitize some politicians from glaring misdeeds. I realise trending a hashtag for many young bloggers across Africa could be the difference between getting the next meal, rent and being hungry, homeless. However, the buck must stop somewhere. The reason we are resorting to this kind of survival is because we continue to enable those failing us to stay in power. The political piece on your blog offering an honest and impartial view of things as you see them could be the once in a lifetime message that sips to the ground and is widely accepted, shaping and informing clear thought to both young and old heading to the ballot. Maybe, just maybe, ultimately getting the deserving leaders elected into office.\n\nAs bad as Covid 19 has been for business, it has brought the realisation that the future belongs to virtual workspaces, an area the young generation can have complete mastery of. The days of exclusive brick-and-mortar work stations are numbered, except for some skeleton staff, especially in the service industry. This opens a whole new window for the virtual office assistant concept to be accepted in Africa. With organisations themselves seeing this as an easy route to have work done without the burden of employee-related taxes, insurance and benefits. They will be dealing with ‘independent contractors’, if you will. Herein lies an opportunity for the young generation to define the nature of this workspace in Africa. There is a certain proverb…”we have not inherited this land from our forebearers, we have borrowed it from our children”…it clearly shows the kind of debt we owe future generations, let’s ethically shape our future and theirs with the powerful gift that is the internet."
