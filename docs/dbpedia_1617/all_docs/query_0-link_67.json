        "text": "Veteran Canadian international winger Junior Hoilett has signed a one-year contract with Scotland’s Hibernian.\n\nThe 34-year-old from Brampton, Ont., was with Scotland’s Aberdeen most recently, signing a short-term contact in February that lasted the remainder of the season.\n\nHoilett has won 63 caps for Canada and saw action in all three games at the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.\n\nBefore Aberdeen, Hoilett had been without a club since his contract with the Vancouver Whitecaps expired at the end of the year. His club resume also includes stints with England’s Blackburn Rovers, Reading, Queens Park Rangers, Wales’ Cardiff City and Germany’s FC St. Pauli and SC Paderborn 07.\n\n“Junior is someone who has been on our radar, especially after his positive end to the season with Aberdeen,” said Hibs head coach David Gray. “Throughout his career he’s played at a very high level and adapted well to Scottish football last season.\n\n“He adds extra options and quality to the final third, alongside leadership and experience to the dressing room.”\n\nIn 15 games with Aberdeen, Hoilett contributed to 11 goals (eight assists and three goals), with eight of those coming in the final five games of the season.\n\n“I enjoyed my time at Aberdeen and I got a good taste of Scottish football up there,” Hoilett told Hibs TV. “The fans are passionate, and football is like a religion up here.”\n\nThe Canadian Press"
