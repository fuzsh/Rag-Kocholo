We are therefore delighted to announce the appointment of Julie McNeill as the new Gaffer of The Hampden Collection. Julie has worked up through the ranks of our fabulous poetry section to lead the team into the future.\n\nJulie explains, “I’m excited to help shape the next chapter for The Hampden Collection and keep poetry, culture, and people at the centre of our footballing life. We are a nation of storytellers. Let’s tell Scotland’s stories with pride. Thank you to all those who have supported and encouraged me. I hope I can do you all proud.”\n\nIn 2021, The Hampden Collection announced plans to build the world’s biggest open-air football museum. In 2024, we achieved our ambition, and 21 sites are now demarcated across Glasgow with signs and plaques. Our mission is to shine UNESCO stars on our creation, and therefore, we are formally announcing the new organisation of The Football’s Square Mile Company Limited. This not-for-profit organisation is led by three Directors: David Coutts, Richard Young, and Graeme Brown.\n\nDavid explains, ‘It’s been an exciting year for us all involved with The Hampden Collection and Football’s Square Mile. We have moved to a more formal structure with Graeme, Richard, and I becoming Directors of The Football’s Square Mile Company Ltd. I’ll be the Company Secretary, and in keeping with the fun part of our objectives, and to recognise our Scotch Professors contribution to Latin American football, I’ll become ‘El Presidente’ for Football’s Square Mile. Viva la football revolution!’\n\nOver the last three years, we have been explaining football’s global ties and how football and cricket collided in the 19th century to create the beautiful game we know today.\n\nRichard explains, “Having spent a sporting lifetime telling all I encountered about the symbiotic relationship between cricket and football and how their conjoined efforts triggered the association football explosion upon the world, it is now joyous to watch the looks of astonishment and genuine shock on the faces of cricketers and footballers alike as Glasgow’s forgotten sporting legacy to the world emerges as the best story they have never heard.\n\nThey have now…Football’s Square Mile!”\n\nThe formalised legal structure and the new organisation are fitting ends to the first chapter. Graeme Brown explains, “It’s been a privilege and an honour to establish The Hampden Collection as a leading voice in promoting the rich story of Scotland’s footballing history. The last 7 years have been thrills, spills, laughs, and roars whilst we have built a squad of 14 dedicated volunteers. Julie is one of life’s trailblazers, and I am so excited to see where she takes The Hampden Collection next. I am looking forward to concentrating on our Football’s Square Mile UNESCO ambitions with #Restore1stHampden, a project 9 years in the making, at its core.”\n\nThe final words are left to thank everyone who has been part of this unbelievable journey. If you think the last 7 years were bonkersly brilliant.\n\nYou ain’t seen nothing yet…..\n\nFootball’s Square Mile – Brand Launch\n\nAnnouncement – Sunday 2nd June 2024\n\nOver the last 11 days, we have celebrated the installation of 14 signs and 7 plaques in Football’s Square Mile. This demarcation of 21 football heritage sites enables everyone from across Glasgow, Scotland, and the world, to visit the world’s biggest open-air football museum.\n\nWe have been gearing up for our FSM Launch Video. A work of genius, filmed at 2nd Hampden to inspire all the lovers of football to learn this story.\n\nWe are encouraging everyone to go out and visit all 21 sites. All you need is a pair of shoes and a phone, and you will be drawn into the world of the Scotch Professors, who gave the world the modern game.\n\nThe following review from Eve Coutts sums up the ethos of what we have built:\n\n‘Football’s Square Mile is a fun day out for everyone! Glasgow becomes an exciting scavenger hunt for football history. The plaques are easy to spot and the QR codes are very user-friendly. The stories of Scottish football history are concise yet interesting allowing even non-football fans (like me) to enjoy the tour as well!’\n\nThere is a buzz is in the air with many people sending us photos of our plaques and signs – so what’s stopping you? Get out there and start exploring for yourself. There are no queues, no tickets required, and this is open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week for you to enjoy.\n\nOur motto is ‘Go Big or Go Home’, and we have to thank our amazingly talented Creative Designer, Ashley Rawson, for another genius idea. If you are going to launch a new brand. Do it in style.\n\nWe are delighted to announce that we have set up The Football’s Square Mile Company Limited, a not-for-profit organisation to protect the world’s biggest open-air museum and promote the ‘Greatest Story Rarely Told’. This is the next big step in The Hampden Collection adventure.\n\nWe would like to thank every single person and organisation who has supported our journey.

We asked our guests: Where is 3 Eglinton Terrace? This address is the fabled site of the founding meeting of Queen’s Park Football Club.\n\nThe reaction was a common one. There was no definitive answer given, as it had been a mystery for over 155 years at the time. Prospective theories had identified the potential site as 400 or 404 Victoria Road.\n\nOn 21st August 2023, The Hampden Collection published its theory on the research conducted on the following webpage: https://hampdencollection.com/3-eglinton-terrace/. We concluded a theory of 26 Prince Edward Street as our proposed location of 3 Eglinton Terrace.\n\nThe 3 Eglinton Terrace story is a key part of the ‘Story of Football’ and is a site within our Football’s Square Mile project. Therefore we asked Historic Environment Scotland (HES), as an independent authority, to assess all the available information, including theories put forward by others, to determine their interpretation of the location of 3 Eglinton Terrace.\n\nHere is the outcome of this assessment:\n\n‘Having looked at the various sources available to evidence the location of 3 Eglinton Terrace, the founding place of Queen’s Park FC, HES have concluded that the tenement block at 400-404 Victoria Road is the likely location. As 3 Eglinton Terrace is not specifically identified on any known map, this conclusion has been reached through the evidence of the Glasgow Street Directories, where the re-numbering of Eglinton Terrace addresses through into current Victoria Road addresses can be traced.‘\n\nWe are extremely grateful to HES for completing this assessment and providing their independent opinion, which is now available for all parties to use in interpreting this historic site.\n\nThe Friends of Glasgow Necropolis Join\n\nThe Football’s Square Mile Alliance\n\nAnnouncement – Sunday 28th April 2024\n\nThe Hampden Collection reaches another significant milestone with the Friends of Glasgow Necropolis joining our Football’s Square Mile Alliance. Within Football’s Square Mile, there are three cemeteries: Glasgow Necropolis, Southern Necropolis, and Cathcart Cemetery.\n\nWe are delighted the Friends of Glasgow Necropolis join the Friends of Southern Necropolis and Friends of Cathcart Cemetery in our mission to make them UNESCO sites, and promote the world’s biggest open-air football museum. These organisations volunteer their precious time and expertise to preserve these sites and promote the importance of prominent figures of Glasgow’s past.\n\nRuth Johnston, Chairperson of Friends of Glasgow Necropolis, explains, “The Friends of Glasgow Necropolis fully supports Football’s Square Mile Alliance’s bid for UNESCO World Heritage status. The Glasgow Necropolis was opened in 1833 and was the first garden cemetery in Scotland, with 3,500 memorials designed by some of Glasgow’s most important architects and sculptors.\n\nWilliam Dick, Secretary of the Scottish Football Association, has his services to football commemorated at Glasgow Necropolis. As highlighted in our free guided tours, his monument is perhaps the earliest known sculpture of a laced leather football in the world. On the sporting front our cemetery also has memorials to five Scottish Rugby capped players and one of the golfing Doleman family.”\n\nGraeme Brown, Hampden Collection Founder, explains, “Football’s Square Mile has 21 sites, which stretch across Glasgow City and Glasgow Southside, and we are delighted to welcome another like-minded organisation into our Alliance. We now have 21 organisations supporting our UNESCO ambitions as we enter the project’s next phase on the detailed demarcation process for each of them.”\n\nYou can find out more information about Friends of Glasgow Necropolis and their free tours, which run throughout the year at their brilliant website – Friends of Glasgow Necropolis Website\n\nRory Bryce Appointed Football’s Square Mile’s\n\nHeritage Officer\n\nAnnouncement – Friday 12th April 2024\n\nSince its opening on the 13th of June 2021, our Football’s Square Mile’s mission has gained traction to showcase the 21 heritage sites across Glasgow, which make up the world’s biggest open-air football museum.\n\nWe have now reached a critical stage in our programme, and we are delighted to announce we have appointed Rory Bryce as our new Heritage Officer, who will lead our UNESCO campaign mission.\n\nRory graduated from the University of Stirling with Distinction in 2022 obtaining an MSc in Heritage. His dissertation focused on the heritage elements present within football in Scotland and how fan-led Heritage initiatives have led the charge in preserving, promoting, and maintaining the heritage of football clubs around the country.\n\nWhile studying, he started working at New Lanark World Heritage Site as their World Heritage Coordinator, liaising with UNESCO, contributing to UNESCO Scotland projects, and driving forward New Lanark’s World Heritage Management Plan. He was also responsible for designing New Lanark’s interpretation, curating exhibitions, managing volunteers, and delivering their learning programme.\n\nFurthermore, Rory is the administrator and host of The Forgotten Football Podcast, a football history and heritage project which has been active since 2023. One of his personal goals is to create a map of every former football ground in Scotland.\n\nGraeme Brown, Founder of The Hampden Collection, explains, “We are thrilled Rory has joined our team as we start the next stage of our project on the demarcation of each site. Rory’s knowledge, experience and drive will be fundamental to successfully navigating through the UNESCO application process.\n\nThis is not just a project, it’s a once-in-a-generation opportunity to showcase the rich history of Scottish football to the world. The momentum is building through the dedication of our voluntary team and the invaluable support of our Football’s Square Mile Alliance members.”\n\nRory, added, “I wrote about The Hampden Collection for my dissertation in 2022, so this is a great full circle moment for me. I appreciate the confidence and trust in me to support the delivery of this trailblazing project which will showcase Scottish Footballing history to the world.”\n\nYou can find out more about our UNESCO mission here at the following website –\n\nThe Victoria Bar and Queen’s Park Cafe joins the\n\nFootball’s Square Mile Alliance\n\nAnnouncement – Sunday 7th April 2024\n\nThe Hampden Collection Team has been extremely busy over the last 12 months, as we forge relationships with key organisations to support our long-term UNESCO mission. We are delighted to announce the 20th member of our Football’s Square Mile Alliance, the Victoria Bar and Queen’s Park Cafe, situated on Victoria Road, both of which are in the heart of the world’s biggest open-air football museum and bookend the famous Eglinton Terrace.\n\nOur latest FSM Alliance Ambassador, Annie Kane, Manager of both pubs, explains further, ‘The Victoria Bar and Queen’s Park Cafe, situated on Victoria Road, are, first and foremost, community pubs at their heart. Over the years, many football historians and fans have enquired about 3 Eglinton Terrace and the founding meeting of Queen’s Park Football Club.’\n\n‘Therefore, we are delighted to join the Football’s Square Mile Alliance to support telling this story, and the wider Glasgow and Scotland footballing story through its UNESCO ambitions.’\n\nWe are thrilled to have these two great pubs of Victoria Road onboard and look forward to promoting the rich footballing history of the local area to all those who want to learn the story of the Scotch Professors.\n\nYou can find out more information about Football’s Square Mile here at the following link: https://www.footballssquaremile.com\n\nThe Friends of Southern Necropolis Joins The Football’s Square Mile Alliance\n\nAnnouncement – Monday 1st April 2024\n\nThe Hampden Collection announces an exhibition in Munich ahead of the opening match of the Euros showcasing how a Scottish Tycoon created the First Euros.\n\nThe Hampden Collection, the Football History Group, has hatched a plan to showcase the footballing world how a Scot designed and created the first European Championship in 1909, long before the first official European Championship was held in 1984.\n\nSir Thomas Lipton created a tournament aptly called the Sir Thomas Lipton Trophy, which was competed by four national footballing giants – England, Italy, Switzerland, and Germany – and was held in the Italian city of Turin. The inaugural tournament was held in 1909, and a further competition was held in 1911. This international tournament became the template for not only the European Championships, but the template for the FIFA World Cup, and is thanks to another visionary Scot.\n\nThe proposal came to light via an enquiry through The Hampden Collection website. Graeme Brown, The Hampden Collection Founder, explains, “We received a message from Professor Martine Noshitnie of The University of Boxenhop in Germany, and explained how she wanted to showcase this wonderful piece of history for the upcoming European Championships. With representatives of The Hampden Collection heading to Munich for the opening game, it was a complete no-brainer to help the Professor set up an exhibition for the Tartan Army to visit while they were in the city.”\n\nDavid Coutts, Company Secretary of The Hampden Collection, explains further, “Members of our team are on the road to Munich, and when we heard there was an opportunity to put on another #Fitba150 event in the host city, we jumped at it. The exhibition will showcase one of the great Marketeers of the 19th and 20th centuries, and we will have our pals from the Friends of Southern Necropolis along to help tell Sir Tommy’s story, whose final resting place is in this cemetery located in the Gorbals.”\n\nThe Friends of Southern Necropolis have joined The Football’s Square Mile Alliance, and we are delighted they have jumped aboard to promote the legends buried within the cemetery, which they spend countless hours upkeeping.\n\nDavid explains further on the plan, “Sir Thomas was known for his flamboyant marketing techniques, and we will re-create his most famous Glasgow exploit in Munich. At 1pm on Friday 14th June 2024, we will herd five pigs through the centre of Munich to highlight the opening of the Professor’s exhibition.”\n\nJulie McNeill, Hampden Collection Poet In Chief, explains the impact of Martine’s story, “This year marks the 50-year anniversary of the lifting of the ban on women’s football in Scotland, and its important to showcase the work on and off the field of these amazing women, who once again are smashing glass ceilings to promote their work. I look forward to meeting Martine and giving her the platform she deserves to showcase her work to the masses.”\n\nThe extravaganza will finish in true Sir Tommy Lipton style, when Martine, and The Hampden Collection Team will take to the sky in a hot air balloon and issue bio-degrable exhibition leaflets to the fans below. This will conclude another fascinating and trailblazing #Fitba150 event.\n\nTickets for this event, which will include talks from Martine on her detailed research, a few history lessons on how Scotland invented the beautiful game, and a few poems from our legendary Poet In Chief Julie McNeill, are available on our website for a very limited time only………Until 12pm on April Fool’s Day.\n\nThe Hampden Collection Is Six Years Old Today\n\nAnnouncement – Saturday 30th December 2023\n\nOnce a year, on this day, we reflect on the year gone by. A year where so many things have happened. A year of The Hampden Collection Squad working away telling Scotland’s footballing story in a way which continues to surprise, enchant and demonstrate the importance of Scotland’s role in the development of the world’s most important and beautiful people’s game. This is also a day to remind folks why we are here and what has happened so far.\n\nThe Hampden Collection has powered on to what we have today –\n\nA core team of 10 volunteers, with a huge array of talents including poets, historians, tour guides, artists, and our wonderful Professor, celebrating the history of both the men’s and women’s game.\n\nThe original footprint of 3 Hampden Parks has expanded into the Football’s Square Mile, which was finalised this year – 21 sites to promote and celebrate with an ultimate mission of protecting them through seeking UNESCO World Heritage status.\n\nThe Football’s Square Mile Alliance of 18 organisations, including the Scottish Football Association, and the key decision makers in the City – namely Glasgow City Council and Glasgow Life, as well as other amazing organisations who have supported us along the way.\n\nThis year, our second of #Fitba150, has been full of memories. In true Hampden Collection style, here are the 21 moments of 2023 in no particular order from the team. These exhibit the underlying ethos of what we do – turn heads, make friends, invest our considerable talents into a cause we all love, and have a lot of fun along the way.\n\nNo. 1 – Callum Beattie and our own Barry Kirk swapping shirts after a singsong in Hampden Bowling Club.

With Euro 2024 beckoning, there is indeed further festive cheer with a generous donation to Hampden Bowling Club, which sits on the site of the Tartan’s Army’s first official home – the 1st Hampden Park. A fantastic £600 has been raised through the sale of the ‘Scotland’s Player of the Year T-Shirt’, with £5 from every sale donated to support Hampden Bowling Club’s restoration plan and maintain it as a site of pilgrimage for the Tartan Army foot soldiers.\n\nMore and more football fans are learning the importance of the 1st Hampden site, where Scotland invented the modern passing and running game and created the template for every football ground ever built.\n\nMartin Riddell, Chair, Association of Tartan Army Clubs (ATAC), explains, “The historical importance of Hampden Bowling Club cannot be overstated and is a key piece in the jigsaw of how Scotland introduced the game of football to the world. The turf and the pavilion are of huge significance, not just to Scottish football but to every corner of the planet where the beautiful global game is celebrated, enjoyed, played and watched.”\n\nThe Hampden Collection forged the relationship between ATAC and Hampden Bowling Club through the Football’s Square Mile Alliance, which brings together a range of organisations supporting the bid to make the site of the 1st Hampden, and 20 other sites within Glasgow’s Southside, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. This donation follows the £650 donated to Hampden Bowling Club in 2022, as part of the #Fitba150 celebrations of the 150th anniversary of the world’s first international football match held at West of Scotland Cricket Ground on St Andrew’s Day 1872.\n\nThe ‘Scotland Invented’ t-shirt became a hit among the Tartan Army faithful, explaining Scotland’s contribution to the game, including two-man offside, season ticket, and the crossbar. Both of these t-shirts are now proudly on display within the Hampden Bowling Club pavilion, showcasing this site’s crucial footballing history and growing friendship with the Tartan Army.\n\nWill Moffat, President of Hampden Bowling Club (HBC), explains, “Hampden Bowling Club SCIO is delighted with this further donation and says a massive thank you to every member of the Tartan Army. The respect for their dedication to the heritage of football without prejudice is invaluable to the game.\n\nHBC and it’s members pride themselves in clawing on to the maintenance of the Pavilion and site of 1st Hampden. This is an ongoing worthy challenge and ATAC’s wonderful gifting from sale of Shirts will be used well regarding protecting football heritage on the site. The front door of Hampden Bowling Club will be forever open to The Tartan Army with the Tartan Army’s own ‘Fiona The Pheasant’ welcoming you in.”\n\nIn true Tartan Army style, The Hampden Collection invites the entire football family of 3.5 billion people to visit Football’s Square Mile, learn how Scotland created the beautiful people’s game, and enjoy Scotland’s famous hospitality on your journey through footballing history.\n\nYou can find out more here about the importance of all 21 sites within the world’s biggest open-air football museum at the following link – https://www.footballssquaremile.com/\n\nThe Western District Cricket Union\n\nJoins The Football’s Square Mile Alliance\n\nAnnouncement: Thursday 30th November 2023\n\nThe Western District Cricket Union (WDCU) oversees cricket in the West of Scotland area and is one of the oldest cricket league structures in the United Kingdom. These member clubs have been at the forefront of cricket for generations and instrumental in developing other team sports, such as association football, rugby, athletics, hockey and tennis.\n\nThe relationship between cricket clubs and the establishment of association football, whether played domestically or internationally, has been well documented in recent months, including today’s anniversary of the world’s first international football match held at West of Scotland Cricket Ground in 1872. The importance of this relationship has been a little-known one, and the sterling work of the Hampden Collection and its #Fitba150 programme of events has brought this story to the public eye.\n\nThe Hampden Collection’s #Fitba150 Event celebrated the 150th anniversary of the world’s first international football match at West of Scotland Cricket Ground on 30th November 2022\n\nRichard Young, Author of As The Willow Vanishes and member of The Hampden Collection Team, explains, “The forgotten legacy of the cricket clubs is its involvement with association football from the beginning. Alongside Queen’s Park Football Club, they were the pioneers and promulgators of the explosion of modern football, which caught the public’s attention very quickly. Many of these early football teams were principally cricket clubs who played football as a winter sport to keep fit, and were located in Football’s Square Mile.”\n\nIn 1873, Queen’s Park Football Club gathered seven cricket clubs to form the Scottish Football Association and the Scottish Football Challenge Cup, changing the footballing world forever. Clydesdale, Kilmarnock and Vale of Leven Cricket Clubs, three surviving WDCU members, signed up at the meeting in the Dewar’s Temperance Hotel in Bridge Street in 1873, and remain part of the foundation of what would become the beautiful people’s game.\n\nThree of the original pioneering cricket clubs – Vale of Leven, Kilmarnock and Clydesdale\n\nKhizar Ali, WDCU Chairman, stated, “We support the Football’s Square Mile campaign because it recognises cricket’s founding contribution to association football in Scotland. This contribution demonstrates the power of teamwork, people working together as clubs, and what can be achieved, on and off the field of play, irrespective of the sport. The Hampden Collection’s mission for UNESCO status for Football’s Square Mile tells cricket’s story within the footballing world and the many cricket sites located within it.”\n\nBryan Clarke, WDCU Secretary, added, “It has been a joy to watch the last 18 months as the important role of the early cricketers and their clubs have played out in articles and interviews. As a cricketer, I am filled with pride, and as a football fan and a Scot, I am forever learning about our sporting legacies and having nothing but respect for those before me. Their original endeavours mean so much to over 3.5 billion people who now play or watch football around the world today. Cricket has to support Football’s Square Mile and the UNESCO status bid, and we are delighted to be involved.”\n\nKhizar Ali and Bryan Clarke holding the McCulloch Cup, one of the T20 trophies of the WDCU\n\nThe Western District Cricket Union joins the growing membership of the Football’s Square Mile Alliance, supporting the mission to recognise the cradle of the world’s biggest cultural sporting phenomenon and make it a UNESCO World Herigate Site.\n\nYou can find out more here at – https://www.footballssquaremile.com/\n\nThe Rose Reilly Pub Joins\n\nThe Football’s Square Mile Alliance\n\nAnnouncement: Saturday 18th November 2023\n\nWe are delighted to announce The Rose Reilly Pub has joined The Football’s Square Mile Alliance, and supports our UNESCO mission to promote and protect the world’s biggest open-air football museum. The Rose Reilly celebrates one of Scotland’s greatest women’s footballers and a true Scotch Professor, who laced up her boots in Scotland, France and Italy, and cemented herself as a legend by winning the pre-cursor to the Women’s World Cup with Italy in 1984.\n\nOn this day in 1972, 11 Scots strode onto a frozen Ravenscraig Park in Greenock to create history against England: The World’s first international women’s football match. Among their ranks was Rose Reilly, a young woman who would become an icon for female footballers across Scotland, France, Italy and the world. The Rose Reilly Pub in Govanhill, opened in 2022 with this trailblazer’s name above the door and sits on the site of a special place for the Tartan Army, originally called The Hampden Bar. This site has been a congregation point for pre and post-match discussion as far back as the 1880s, and is one of the 21 sites listed within Football’s Square Mile.\n\nBarry Kirk, Chief of Comms of The Hampden Collection, explains, “We were very excited when we heard about the plans to open a new pub on the site of the ‘Old Hampden’. This watering hole was a much-loved stop-off point by the Tartan Army on the ‘Road To Hampden’, and we were delighted they chose the name of one of Scotland’s trailblazing women’s footballers to hang above the door. Our mission is to celebrate the incredible history of Scotland’s football heritage, including Scotland creating the international fixture in both the Men’s and Women’s game.”\n\nThe Rose Reilly is situated on Albert Road, Govanhill, and is in the heart of Football’s Square Mile within a thriving and diverse district of Glasgow’s Southside. In 2023, the new Football’s Square Mile website was launched in partnership with the Scottish Football Association, Glasgow City Council and Glasgow Life, to promote the Scottish pioneers, ‘aka Scotch Professors’, who created the beautiful game. We are delighted to add The Rose Reilly pub to this growing list of ambassadors, who are supporting The Hampden Collection’s mission to promote Glasgow as ‘The Spiritual Home of World Football’, and we invite all of the 3.5 billion members of the footballing family to come and visit.\n\nSteven Clark, Proprietor of the Rose Reilly, explains, “The Rose Reilly is an old-fashioned community pub in the heart of Football’s Square Mile, named in honour of one of Scottish Football’s true living legends. Whilst reflecting a passion for the history of the local game, the pub also welcomes non-football fans and has become central to social life in the Govanhill area, with a varied range of local and international drinks and a cosy atmosphere.”\n\n“We are delighted to join the Alliance as we have a shared interest in protecting the heritage of the area, be it the fantastic history of Scottish football or the fabled watering holes that have been around for as long as all the Hampden Parks have.”\n\nProfessor Fiona Skillen, Glasgow Caledonian University, explains further, “Much of the history of the women’s game in Scotland has been overlooked, or worst still, forgotten. The game has a long history and it’s important that we celebrate its millstone and pioneers. Rose Reilly is one Scotland’s greatest players.”\n\nThis is another milestone in our UNESCO journey to promote the history of the Men and Women’s game within the cradle of the world’s most popular sport.\n\nYou can find out more about The Rose Reilly, and the other sites within Football’s Square Mile on our website.\n\nThe Hampden Collection Celebrates Scotland’s Footballing and Cricketing Shared History at East Kilbride Cricket Club\n\nNews – 15th November 2023\n\nOn Saturday 11th November, The Hampden Collection Team attended East Kilbride Cricket Club’s Annual awards night to celebrate the shared history of cricket, football and the power of teamwork. A magical evening was spent at the Club Awards Dinner recognising the club’s sporting success and its work of the ladies with the development of children, girls, and women into the playing of cricket, irrespective of gender, race, colour, creed or ability.\n\nRichard Young, Author of As The Willow Vanishes, said, “We were honoured to attend this special event and share our experiences and opinion about being part of a team. The Glasgow Football Tour, As the Willow Vanishes, the Scottish Football Poets and many others, are all members of The Hampden Collection Team, which allow the public to ‘walk’ back through time along the paths of the past. The individual echoes, and some of the little-known historical sites within ‘Football’s Square Mile’ have a set of stories which forever change your opinion of cricket, and celebrates how cricket and football collided in the 19th century to create the beautiful game.”\n\nIn 2023, two new walking tours were launched celebrating the links between cricket and football. The ‘As The Willow Vanishes Walking Tour’ starts in Glasgow City Centre and walks to Clydesdale Cricket Club, where tourers experience the journey of how the cricket clubs of the 19th Century were essential to the explosion of football in Glasgow. The Subway Footy Tour is a whistle stop tour round Glasgow’s underground, and explains the story of how international football was created by Queen’s Park Football Club at the West of Scotland Cricket Ground.\n\nLindsay Hamilton, Founder of the Glasgow Football Tour, explains, “The atmosphere at East Kilbride on Saturday night was magical. There was a special energy in the room. People celebrating, catching up, sharing ideas, supporting one another, like any good team does. This team effort has been essential to the growing success of the tour business, as we invite the footballing world of 3.5 billion to hear Glasgow’s story as The Spiritual Home of World Football.”\n\nThe evening showcased the wonderful efforts of Moon Mughis and Nayma Shaikh who have both been nominated for the Scottish Women in Sport awards on 24th November.\n\nJulie McNeil, The Hampden Collection’s Poet-In-Chief, explains, “What a warm welcome we received at East Kilbride Cricket Club. It was a great honour to be asked to come along and share the work of the Hampden Collection and celebrate the rich shared history of football and cricket. I read an original poem I wrote in dedication to two East Kilbride superstars Moon Mughis and Nayma Shaikh both of whom are nominated for Scottish Women in Sport awards for their services to cricket.”\n\n“Given the fact that I was inspired to start writing football poetry because of my own daughter watching the Women’s National Team it was fitting that this poem celebrated another mother-daughter team. East Kilbride Cricket Club is a warm and welcoming place where women have brought fresh life and energy into the throng. It was a real privilege to play a small part in their celebrations and to gift them a poem on behalf of the Hampden Collection team in recognition of our shared histories and values.”\n\nWe would like to thank East Kilbride Cricket Club for allowing us to take part in their celebrations and being part of their team for the evening.\n\n150th Anniversary of the Opening of Hampden Park\n\nAnnouncement – 25th October 2023\n\nToday, The Hampden Collection celebrates the 150th Anniversary of the opening of the 1st Hampden Park, as part of its #Fitba150 celebrations. The 1st Hampden set the standard for all modern football stadia and was the world’s first purposefully-built, enclosed international football ground.\n\nAs part of the celebrations, we are delighted to announce Clydesdale Cricket Club has joined the Football’s Square Mile Alliance, supporting the ambition to make the cradle of modern football a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The endorsement from Clydesdale celebrates the shared history of Queen’s Park and the cricket clubs of Glasgow, who were the ignition switch for the beautiful game in Scotland and its export around the world.\n\nToday is an auspicious occasion for Scottish Football and World Football. On 25th October 1873, Queen’s Park Football Club opened Hampden Park with their first Scottish Cup match against Dumbreck and won the game 7 – 0. Queen’s Park set the evolving standard for the football ground, creating three iterations of Hampden Park, culminating in the current 3rd Hampden, which by 1937 had the capacity of over 183,000 fans.\n\nGraeme Brown, Founder of The Hampden Collection, explains, “The 1st Hampden is the jewel in the crown of Football’s Square Mile, and is the template for every football ground ever built. Queen’s Park developed the modern passing and running game on this ground, and the Scotch Professors exported this beautiful game to the world. We encourage all the lovers of the beautiful game to come and visit to hear the story of our mission to make this a UNESCO World Heritage Site, along with the other 20 sites within Football’s Square Mile.”\n\nFurthermore, today marks the 150th Anniversary of Clydesdale Football Club’s first competitive match, where they beat Granville 6 – 0 in their first match in the Scottish Cup.\n\nRichard Young, Author of As The Willow Vanishes, explains, “The importance of the Clydesdale Cricket Club story hasn’t been appreciated, let alone known, by most of the club’s membership. However, in its 175th year in 2023, the club’s anniversary celebrations revealed how important it was to developing Scotland’s sporting landscape and how this legacy is an integral part of the club’s DNA .”\n\nThe importance of Queen’s Park and Clydesdale is clearly illustrated by how they combined at the dawn of association football, and led to the explosion of football across Glasgow, Scotland and the world:\n\n7 of the 8 clubs that created the Scottish Football Association and the Scottish Cup were principally cricket clubs.\n\n13 of the original 16 entrants for the first Scottish Challenge Cup were principally cricket clubs.\n\nOver 1,800 cricket clubs were in operation in the Glasgow area between 1848 and 1914 and turned to football to keep fit during the winter – a fact that is only now beginning to resonate with countless researchers and sports historians.\n\nThis combination of Queen’s Park pioneering role, combined with the infrastructure and networks deployed by their local cricket clubs, explains how Glasgow became the ‘Football Capital of the World’ by the end of the 19th Century.\n\nAlistair Bleach, President of Clydesdale, commenting on the support for Football’s Square Mile, explains, “Clydesdale is one of Glasgow’s most important sporting institutions with a history steeped in cricket, rugby, hockey, athletics, tennis and football.\n\nWe are delighted to have our sports club designated within Football’s Square Mile, recognising our founding contribution to Association Football in Scotland, where our Founder, Archibald Campbell, was the first President of the Scottish Football Association. We are excited to be part of The Hampden Collection’s mission for UNESCO status and look forward to telling our story to the world.”\n\nMore information about our UNESCO mission and all the sites contained within Football’s Square Mile is found here – https://www.footballssquaremile.com/\n\nINTRODUCING FOOTBALL’S SQUARE MILE\n\nA sports heritage walking trail for Glasgow\n\nSFA Press Statement\n\nWednesday 6th September 2023\n\nThe Scottish FA is today pleased to announce its support and membership of the Football’s Square Mile Alliance which has been formed to recognise, preserve, and promote some of the earliest and most significant origins of association football in Scotland.\n\nLed by Graeme Brown, and a like-minded and talented group of volunteers and enthusiasts working collaboratively as The Hampden Collection (“the Hampdeners”), the Football’s Square Mile project has very humble beginnings but lofty ambitions.\n\nBilled as the world’s biggest open-air football museum, Football’s Square Mile contains 21 football heritage sites which collectively represent the point of origin for the modern passing, running and combination game, a game that is now enjoyed by 3.5 billion people around the world today.\n\nGraeme Brown, Founder of The Hampden Collection, explains: “Football’s Square Mile is free of charge, with no queues, no opening or closing times, and accessible to every football fan on the planet. Our new website explains the roots of the beautiful people’s game and we are inspiring people to learn more about Scotland’s pioneering role in the evolution of world football.”\n\n“Our objective is to achieve UNESCO world heritage status for Football’s Square Mile and celebrate the Scotch Professors who took their game to every corner of the footballing world.”\n\nIan Maxwell, Scottish FA Chief Executive: “Through our planning for a number of significant Scottish football anniversaries between 2022 and 2024, the Association has been impressed by the work undertaken by The Hampden Collection to promote, and contextualise, the rich and diverse history of the Scottish game.\n\n“The group’s delivery of a contemporary series of #Fitba 150 events exploring the early history between cricket and football, the birth of men’s and women’s international football, and the first international match between Scotland and England was genuinely inspirational.\n\n“The Football’s Square Mile project provides a fascinating insight into the people, places, and events that have helped to shape the story of Scottish football, and I’m delighted that we have been joined today in pledging support for the project by our longstanding friends from Glasgow City Council and Glasgow Life.\n\n“The Scottish FA looks forward to working with The Hampden Collection and its fellow Football’s Square Mile Alliance partners in the future development of this exciting project.”\n\nChair of Glasgow Life, Bailie Annette Christie said: “Football’s Square Mile Alliance will celebrate Glasgow’s rich football heritage and tell the story of how international football at Hampden developed over the years. It’s a fascinating and exciting project that promises to bring visitors to Glasgow to discover how international football flourished here and reveal more stories of Scottish football.”\n\nHampden Bowling Club Smashes Membership Record Attracting 20,000 Country and International Members, as Football Fans Flock To Support The World’s Most Important Football Site\n\nSaturday 1st April 2023\n\nOver the last six years, there has been a unique project showcasing the site of the world’s first purposefully-built, enclosed international football ground – aka 1st Hampden. Hampden Bowling Club, in partnership with The Hampden Collection, has pursued a groundbreaking mission to restore its beloved pavilion and grounds to secure the legacy of this magnificent sporting site.\n\nIn the year of Hampden Park’s 150th anniversary, Hampden Bowling Club launched two new membership categories. Firstly, its Country membership appeals to Scotland-based Tartan Army Fans from outside the Glasgow boundary. Secondly, it’s trailblazing international membership category for those based abroad who want to support the rebuilding of the Home of World Football. The success of this campaign has been beyond all expectation.\n\nWill Moffat, President of Hampden Bowling Club, explains, “The interest has been exceptional with members joining from all over Scotland from within the Tartan Army ranks, who understand the importance of maintaining their first home. The most exciting recognition is from international football fans embracing the cradle of the modern game in Glasgow. All our new members want to rebuild the home of the Scotch Professors, who took their game to every corner of the planet and showed it to the locals. We’ve had members sign-up from New York to New South Wales and Buenos Aires to Tokyo. They all understand the importance of our site and are signing up in their droves to deliver our restoration plans.”\n\nThe importance of this site to world football is undeniable, as every football ground ever built has followed the 1st Hampden template created by Queen’s Park Football Club in 1873. Furthermore, this is where Scotland perfected the modern passing and running game, which is now played or watched by over 3.5 billion people today.\n\nGraeme Brown, Founder of The Hampden Collection, explains, “Our mission has always been to #Restore1stHampden, as this is the centrepiece of Football’s Square Mile, the world’s biggest open-air football museum. We are delighted to support the Bowling Club team as we launch our plans for our next edition of #Fitba150, celebrating the world’s first international football match here in Glasgow. To mark the occasion, we have donated one of our ‘Ludum Unum’ limited edition shirts to the club for a unique prize draw. This exceptional shirt will be launched, as 1st Hampden celebrates its 150th anniversary in October, later this year.”\n\nThe next ambition is to smash through the 35,000 membership barrier, a nod to the record attendance of 2nd Hampden, and then plough on to break the 183,724 mark, which was the 3rd Hampden capacity by 1937.\n\nWill Moffat explains, ‘Every new country and international member will be entered into the prize draw for this beautiful top, and the lucky winner will be presented with their gift at the 1st Hampden on the day of the Scotland v England match on 12th September 2023. This football shirt is a fantastic prize and a nod to ‘Game One’ of International Football, and we are eternally grateful to The Hampden Collection for their continued support.\n\nA recent uptaker of this fantastic membership offer is a senior Tartan Army stalwart, who wrote on their membership form, “In my view, what you guys are doing goes hand in hand with what the Tartan Army is doing to promote the National Team. I saw someone on Twitter had joined the Hampden Bowling Club, so it seemed a no-brainer to spend £20 on Country Membership to support the cause.”\n\nTo win this exceptional gift, you must become a Country or International member by 31st August 2023. Here is the website link with all the membership categories and form for completion.\n\nGood luck!\n\nThe Hampden Collection Celebrates its 5th Birthday –\n\nAn organisation set up to protect the Hampden Park Legacy and promote Scotland as the Home of Football\n\nFriday 30th December 2022\n\nOn this day in 2017, Queen’s Park played Albion Rovers in the Scottish League Division 1 at the 3rd Hampden Park. Before the game, and during half-time, a short film was played on the big screens showcasing the 3 Hampden Parks. This was the next step in promoting the existing campaign to #Restore1stHampden, and launched the new campaign to #KeepHampdenRoaring.\n\nThis is where the acorn was sown of a new organisation called The Hampden Collection, with one straighforward mission statement, ‘Promote, Protect and Celebrate the 3 Hampden Parks and all who played on them’. This is an all-encompassing objective, supporting the history of Scottish Football, and the Scotch Professors, both men and women, who took the modern passing and running game to the world.\n\nAt the time, the sites of the 1st Hampden and 3rd Hampden were under threat, and had the potential of suffering the same fate as 2nd Hampden: aka Cathkin Park, and become a relic of football history. The 1st Hampden pavilion and site had reincarnated as Hampden Bowling Club and Kingsley Rose Gardens, but were on the brink of extinction; and the SFA was eyeing up a potential move to Murrayfield. Without the 1st and 3rd Hampden, the last 5 years would not have happened. They have been the centrepiece of everything we do, and we have built around them to create the world’s biggest open-air football museum – Football’s Square Mile, with the ambition to protect them, and many other sites, for generations to come.\n\nThe last 5 years are well documented. You may have been one of the 22,000 visitors to our website, read some of the 1,000’s of posts on Facebook and Twitter, visited the 1st Hampden Mural, explored the countless articles in the papers, interviews on Radio, TV and Youtube, and attended Hampden Collection events. The Hampden Collection Juggernaut continues to go through the gears and we hope you are enjoying the journey.\n\nLessons Learned\n\nThere are three key lessons from all of this work, which we take into the next 5 years:\n\nLesson 1 – The history of Scottish Football, and its place as the creator of the beautiful people’s game, is wrapped up in the Hampden Park Legacy and Football’s Square Mile. Without maps, or the ability to see, feel, touch or sit within these buildings and sites, the world will never fully understand the legacy of the Scotch Professors. These men and women exported the modern passing and running ‘Scottish Game’ to the Football Family of 3.5 billion people around the globe. These landmarks are precious and they must be protected.\n\nLesson 2 – The grand architects and master stadium builders of Queen’s Park Football Club, and the 1700+ Cricket Clubs of the Greater Glasgow area, are the reasons why Football exploded into the greatest cultural phenomenon the world has ever seen. The world plays the Scottish game, and we need everyone to learn this story to take our ‘baw’ back from those who think the ‘Home of Football’ is somewhere else.\n\nLesson 3 – Everyone has the ability to be a historian. As soon as you have the confidence to tell a story based on facts, then you are a historian. This football history is your history, my history, our history and everyone’s history. This is not someone’s history. Nobody owns this, and it is certainly not intellectual property. This statement is to encourage everyone who dabbles in our football culture, and commend those who have a profession in researching football history. You are the small acorns, who may one day become the mighty oaks telling the world this story.\n\nReflections\n\nIf you had asked the populace in 2017, ‘Where is the site of the 1st Hampden?’, they would have pointed at the current national football stadium.\n\nIf you had asked them in 2017, ‘Who invented football?,’ they may have said Scotland, but may not have had all the facts to back it up.\n\nIf you asked, ‘What’s the plan to take our baw back?’, people would point to the group of football fans who are pushing this story. The Copa90 video for the Euros showcased this – if you haven’t seen it then you must have a peak – https://youtu.be/4N6NL0JGS9Y\n\nAnd there are stark reminders of the knife-edge some of these buildings are standing on. Clincart Farm being a prime example, where there is a lot of angst out there about the building being demolished. If you are one of those people, then please ask yourself the following questions:\n\nAre you are a member of Queen’s Park Football Club?\n\nAre you a member of the Queen’s Park Football Club Committee?\n\nDid you have a campaign to designate the site or save it in the last 5 years?\n\nIf your answer is ‘no’ to these questions, and you were aware of the site’s significance and are annoyed at its demolition, then the inquest starts with you.\n\nOur mission is to save as many buildings and landmarks as possible, but we are a volunteer organisation, with limits. We implore everyone to follow this example, and do it in a positive fashion.\n\nOur Future\n\nThis is not a solo mission, and The Hampden Collection is not the only organisation promoting this story. We are playing our part in cultivating an interest in Scotland’s pioneering role in football, and having a lot of fun along the way.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nOur four #Fitba150 events in November 2022, created free entry for over 500 people; with coverage tweeted by UEFA, FIFA and appeared on the news as far away as Japan.\n\nEstablished the World Home of Football Poetry, with three poetry collections and containing 126 poems about the beautiful game.\n\nCreated the 100-foot mural dedicated to the Scotland 5-1 England game in 1882 on the rear of Hampden Bowling Club via a crowdfunder. This marked the 1st Hampden Park for all to see.\n\nConverted Hampden Bowling Club into a charitable institution and put it on the road to survival.\n\nEstablished the 3 Hampden Walking Tour with Glasgow Football Tour; showing over 300 people around the Hampden sites and telling them the story of football.\n\nPublished a chapter every Sunday at 830pm, for 256 weeks and counting; about the story of football. Each chapter is 220 words, requiring one minute of your time and is called Football Queens and Kings. There are 109 chapters remaining to be written.\n\nThe next 5 years are equally important and we have three simple objectives:\n\n#Restore1stHampden is the heart of everything we do – the mission started in 2015, when I became Secretary of Hampden Bowling Club and continues to this day through the Hampden Collection.\n\nContinue our UNESCO World Heritage Campaign for #FootballsSquareMile and build our Football Square Mile Alliance to make this a reality.\n\nCelebrate all the key anniversaries of football under our #Fitba150 programme of events.\n\nThese are some of the foundation blocks we have put in place for our mission. They have cost nothing, apart from a huge amount of volunteer effort, and encapsulate the Queen’s Park motto of ‘Ludere Causa Ludendi’.\n\nThank You\n\nThis is a massive thank you and congratulations to the team of fantastic volunteers and supporting organisations, who are delivering these projects and spreading the Scotch Professor story. This includes the great ties with the Tartan Army, who will play a massive role in everything we do in the next 5 years. As the saying goes, ‘No Scotland, No Party’.\n\nWe all know that this is the end of the beginning, and the fun is really about to start.\n\nAll the very best for 2023 and beyond.\n\nGraeme Brown\n\nGlasgow Building Preservation Trust Joins\n\nFootball Square Mile Alliance\n\nMonday 12th December 2022\n\nThe Hampden Collection is delighted to announce Glasgow Building Preservation Trust has joined our mission to promote and protect Glasgow’s footballing heritage.\n\n150 years ago today, on 12th December 1872, Third Lanarkshire Rifle Volunteers met in the Regimental Orderly Rooms in Glasgow’s East Howard Street to discuss the forming of a football club. Their objective was to create a ‘diversion’ from their military practice. Private Broadfoot proposed the motion; and Private Taylor seconded the motion. This is the same Joseph Taylor who played in the first international, and played alongside Billy Dickson and Billy MacKinnon for Queen’s Park Football Club; who were also members of the regiment.\n\nThe formation of Third Lanark FC clearly demonstrates the impact of the world’s first international football match, which was held 12 days earlier. Teams across Glasgow, and further afield, were formed after being inspired by the ‘Great Match’, and Thirds (or the Hi-Hi as they became known), became a powerhouse of Scottish Football. They were a founding member of the Scottish Football Association in 1873, and won the League Championship and two Scottish Cups; amongst other honours.\n\nThe sad and untimely death of Third Lanark in 1967 reminds the footballing world of the precious nature of football clubs, and their role not just in the community but in our national identity.\n\nWithin Football’s Square Mile there are three Third Lanark footballing sites:\n\nThe Regimental Orderly Rooms were situated in The Havelock Building, which was demolished and now is the site of a multi-story car park at St Enoch\n\nThe site of the first Third Lanark Ground, and more commonly known as Old Cathkin; is situated between Boyd Street and Dixon Road; and is now housing.\n\nThe site of New Cathkin Park; where Third Lanark took over the site of the 2nd Hampden and played there from 1903; is now a derelict football ground. The Jimmy Johnstone Academy continue to inspire the youth of today through football and do a fantastic job of maintaining what remains of the old ground.\n\nThese key sites are within the World’s Biggest Open-Air Football Museum; and The Third Lanark story is a powerful reminder to what happens to our footballing history and heritage, once the clubs who maintain them disappear from view. Therefore it is critical we gather momentum and gain support from key organisations such as Glasgow Building Preservation Trust to preserve what we have left.\n\nDavid Cook, Director of GBPT, explains, “Glasgow Building Preservation Trust is a charity that rescues, repairs and restores historic buildings at risk across the city, working with others to give redundant buildings a new purpose and return them to their communities. The Trust also delivers the much-loved annual Glasgow Doors Open Days Festival in September, and creates engagement projects to explain the city’s stories to its citizens.”\n\n“Sporting heritage can often be overlooked but forms a key part of our shared past, reflecting and influencing wider changes in our society and communities. The Trust is delighted to support Football’s Square Mile Alliance in celebrating the centrality of Glasgow to football’s global development.”\n\nThis is another hugely important step in building the foundations of the UNESCO campaign for Football’s Square Mile, and we look forward to working with GBPT on this hugely important long-term project.\n\nCathkin Park is synonymous with what happens to football clubs when they die. Those that make the pilgrimage are treated to a leap into our footballing past, where you can stand on the old terracing. The poem, ‘We are Scottish Football’, by Julie McNeill, was filmed at Cathkin by BBC Sport Scotland ahead of the opening of the 2022 Season. This gives a glimpse into what we are trying to protect and promote; and we encourage everyone to make the pilgrimage, and show their support to our UNESCO mission. This film also features footage from Dumbarton’s Stephen Watt; another club which celebrates its 150th anniversary later this month.\n\n#Fitba150 – The Clans Are Gathering\n\nWednesday 30th November 2022\n\nScotland gave ‘Fitba’ to the world and YOU are invited to be part of this historic event, stand on the spot where the first international was played – at the time it was first played – 150 years on.\n\nOver the last two weeks; which we have dubbed ‘Scotch Professor Fortnight’, The Hampden Collection and its Partners have held events at Clydesdale Cricket Club and the Scottish Football Hall of Fame; to celebrate both the birth of Men’s and Women’s international football.\n\nToday marks the finale with two events; one at the West of Scotland Cricket Ground to mark the 150th anniversary of the first men’s international football match on St Andrew’s Day 1872, and the other explaining the story of one of the ‘1972 Ravenscraig Pioneers’, who participated in the first women’s international football match. Both were Scotland v England; and both were organised by, and held in, Scotland.\n\nHere is what you need to know:\n\nEvent Three – #SCOENG1872 – The Clans Are Gathering\n\nThe Hampden Collection, West of Scotland Cricket Club and our partners, are holding a special event this St Andrew’s Day, Wednesday 30th November 2022, to celebrate the 150th anniversary of the World’s First International Football Match and the 150th birthday of the Tartan Army.\n\nOur #Fitba150 programme of events celebrates the Scottish roots of the beautiful game and explains the explosion of football across Glasgow, Scotland and the World. This football match lit the tinder, which had been building up for over 600 years, where Scottish Men and Women regularly played football in the villages and towns around Scotland. On your pilgrimage you will find out more about this fascinating story and celebrate with us the birth of the Tartan Army in 1872, where 4,000 foot soldiers made the trip to Hamilton Crescent to cheer on our country for the very first time.\n\nThe south gates will be open for public access from 1230pm until 3pm, where you can stand on the famous turf and our stewards (containing several volunteers from the Tartan Army Ranks) will explain the importance of this match. By the time Scotland organised this international in 1872, football was so popular that it had been banned by the King, recorded by a frustrated Minister about parishioners playing football on the Sabbath, and led to the creation of the World’s first football club in Edinburgh in 1824, notably called ‘The Foot-Ball Club’.\n\nThese legendary tales showcase the rich culture of Scotland’s footballing legacy and explain why, in 1872 and beyond, inspired Scots took their ‘baw’ to the furthest outposts of the World and taught locals the way we had been playing for centuries. These Scotch Professors require the ultimate recognition for creating the modern passing and running game, and setting the standards for all who play and watch football today.\n\nOur mission is to enable you to make the pilgrimage to the site of ‘Game One’, share your ‘Tartan Army’ stories and celebrate the most important footballing nation in the World. Why not come along and hear these stories and celebrate this momentous occasion with everyone? There wouldn’t be a footballing party without those pioneering trailblazers of 1872, and all the other Scotch Professors who followed them.\n\nLocation – The West of Scotland Cricket Ground, 40-44 Peel St, Glasgow G11 5LU\n\nTransport – Partick Train and Subway stations are very close by. Many bus routes travel along nearby Dumbarton Road.\n\nDresscode – Full Scotland Attire – Kilts/Trews (or whatever) – and possibly a brolly.\n\nEvent Four – A Rose Reilly Master Class\n\nOur final event is at 5:30pm on St Andrews Day at Glasgow Caledonian University. GCU are hosting a masterclass with a modern day Scotch Professor, and one of Scotland’s greatest living footballing exports. Rose Reilly has won the World Cup and is a legend in the women’s game, and will be interviewed by Dr Fiona Skillen.\n\nRecognised as Scotland’s greatest female footballer and voted the World’s Best Female Player in 1984, Rose captained the Italian squad that won the Women’s World Cup that same year – scoring one of the goals that saw the Azzurri defeat the US in the final in front of a 90,000 crowd at China’s National Stadium.\n\nRose’s enormous trailblazing contribution to the sport, inspiring girls and women to play, saw her inducted into the Scottish Sports and Scottish Football Halls of Fame and, in 2011, she was the first recipient of a special Professional Footballer’ Association Scotland Merit Award.\n\nYou can get your free ticket to this event at the following link:\n\nhttps://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/masterclass-with-dr-rose-reilly-tickets-444080676257\n\nSupport Our Mission\n\nWe want to get people talking about the pioneering role Scotland played at the dawn of association football in both the men’s and women’s game, and taught the world to play the ‘Scottish Game’.

This original ‘Great Match’ provided the ignition switch and launchpad for the explosion of football across Glasgow and Scotland, and led to the trailblazing Scotch Professors taking their beautiful game to the world.\n\nThis 150th anniversary of international football celebrates the first occasion where 4,000 Tartan Army foot soldiers marched to watch their heroes play. The game signalled the start of a love affair with their national football team, and our celebrations will immortalise the Tartan Army’s 150th birthday.\n\nGraeme Brown, Founder of the Hampden Collection, explains, “We’ve been building towards this anniversary over the last five years, and developed a platform to celebrate one of the most important moments in football. The world should recognise Scotland as the home of international football, where Queen’s Park set the template for all future matches, and established a legacy enjoyed around the world today. Our mission is to create memorable moments for everyone fascinated by Scotland’s pioneering contribution to the footballing world and tell this story to the masses.”\n\nFitba150 includes events involving two foundation clubs of Scottish Football, namely Queen’s Park and Clydesdale, who contested the first Scottish Cup Final. Both of these teams were the driving force behind the creation of the Scottish Football Association, which was created some short five months after the inaugural international match.\n\nQueen’s Park Football Club Director, Gregor Hall, commented, “The club is delighted to work with The Hampden Collection to create a highly entertaining and informative series of events. Queen’s played a pivotal role in organising the world’s first international football match, and we must celebrate these trailblazers and pioneers of the modern game.”\n\nClydesdale Cricket Club’s Vice President, Alistair Bleach, enthused about the upcoming anniversary, and the club’s involvement in a series of forthcoming celebratory events, explains, “The dear green fields of Glasgow have always been a place for emerging sports. These cricket clubs were often the origin or venue points for the rising popularity of team sports such as rugby, hockey and football. As Clydesdale enters its 175th year, we are celebrating its role at the forefront of the ‘football explosion’ alongside the efforts of Scotland’s other cricket clubs and Queen’s Park Football Club.”\n\nThe programme’s main event will feature a celebratory kick-off at West of Scotland Cricket Ground on St Andrew’s Day, featuring two of the great-grandchildren of one of Scotland’s players who featured in the first match. Joseph Taylor was a trailblazer for both country and club, playing at full-back for Scotland in the first six internationals, and featured in all of Queen’s Park’s Scottish Cup treble-winning team of 1874 to 1876.\n\nColin Mair, President of West of Scotland Cricket Club, explains, “The West of Scotland Cricket Club is delighted to host a commemorative event on the 150th anniversary of the world’s first international football match held here at Hamilton Crescent, Partick on St Andrew’s Day 1872. This match heralded the dawn of international football and shows how Glasgow and the then West cricket and rugby clubs were at the forefront of the football revolution, which now sees the game enjoyed around the world today by millions.”\n\nFurther events are planned for the Tartan Army to enjoy, concluding with the Tartan Army’s 150th Big Birthday Bash. This grand finale for #Fitba150 will be announced shortly.\n\nGraeme Brown explains, “#Fitba150 will kickstart a decade of celebrations, including major anniversaries of the Scottish Football Association, Clydesdale, Opening of the 1st Hampden Park, First Scottish Cup Final, and many memorable international and domestic matches.\n\nThis programme will illustrate clearly how Scotland was the dominant force at the dawn of football and why the Scotch Professors became the missionaries who taught the world their beautiful game. We are encouraging everyone involved in Scotland’s broad and rich landscape of football culture to celebrate and promote Scotland’s pioneering role to the world. This is a party for everyone to enjoy.”\n\nYou can find out more about #Fitba150 and everything we are progressing here at our website – http://www.hampdencollection.com and follow us on Facebook @TheHamdpenCollection and on Twitter: ScotchProfessors@Hampdeners\n\nThird Lanark’s Team Baths and Changing Room Unearthed In Archaeology Dig – Project Update\n\nThursday 16th June 2022\n\nArchaeology Scotland uncovers a true gem of Scottish Football Heritage finding the original Team Baths and Changing Room of 3rd Lanark’s Cathkin Park Football Ground.\n\nArchaeologists from Archaeology Scotland are currently excavating the remains of Cathkin Park, one of Scotland’s most iconic football grounds, located in the South Side of Glasgow. Cathkin Park was home to Third Lanark from 1904 until their untimely and infamous demise in 1967. Their ground was abandoned with the grandstand and pavilion being demolished in the 1970’s. Amazingly, the terracing that surrounds three parts of the ground still survive, and the remains stand in memory of the teams, players and fans that once graced this iconic footballing location. This iconic site forms part of Football’s Square Mile, which is the world’s biggest open-air football museum and The Hampden Collection is running a campaign to make this a UNESCO world heritage site.\n\nFollowing extensive geophysics of the grounds and through a previous smaller dig in 2017, the team were able to locate where they thought the original pavilion may be situated. Following careful excavation on Wednesday 22nd June, the team made an amazing discovery finding the original Team Baths and the original Changing Room of this iconic football ground.\n\nThe team explained their delight on Twitter – “If you thought yesterday’s find was amazing, we hit the jackpot today! We found the Third Lanark bath and changing room! An amazing find and a real piece of history. We can only imagine what these tiles saw and the players that once took an early bath here!”\n\nThis builds on earlier finds this week, which include the famous red and white colours of Third Lanark on newly discover floor tiles.\n\nThe team’s discover was again shared on Twitter – “Who needs the Alexander Mosaic in #Pompeii when you have got your very own football heritage mosaic on your doorstep at Cathkin Park.”\n\nDr Paul Murtagh of Archaeology Scotland and Project Lead, explains the importance of this inclusion focused project, “This programme is focused on working with New Scots, refugees and asylum seekers, and we feel that both sport and archaeology are ways in which we can engage with people from all over the world, help them learn about the history of Scotland and Glasgow, and help them settle into their new homes, make friends and have positive experiences.”\n\nThe project is running until the 26th of June, and members of the public are invited to come along with their brushes and garden rakes on the morning of Saturday the 25th of June between 1pm and 3pm to help clean up the terracing around the pitch, share stories and memories of the ground, and celebrate the life of Cathkin Park and all the football that took place there. The Jimmy Johstone Charitable Trust has been cleaning the Terraces since 2009 and it would be great for the public to come down and visit this remarkable site they are looking after, and give them a helping hand.\n\nYou can follow progress on the site via Twitter – Click Here – https://twitter.com/AdoptaMonument and for more details on the dig please check out the press release below, dated 9th June 2022.\n\nLost Glasgow Joins Football’s Square Mile Alliance Supporting UNESCO World Heritage Campaign – Press Statement\n\nThursday, 16th June 2022\n\nThe Hampden Collection is delighted to announce Lost Glasgow has joined the Football’s Square Mile Alliance, which celebrates and promotes the world’s biggest open-air football museum and campaigns to make it a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\n\nNorry Wilson, Founder of Lost Glasgow, explains, “Although I can’t play for toffee, Lost Glasgow is happy to support both the Hampden Collection, and the Football’s Square Mile Alliance’s bid for UNESCO World Heritage status. The modern game, which was born on the streets and playing fields of Glasgow, is this city’s gift to the world. From South America to Russia, the early game echoed to the shouts of Glasgow voices – that first Hampden Roar resonates still, and urges us on.”\n\nLost Glasgow is another brilliant addition to our growing Alliance of like-minded organisations promoting, protecting and celebrating Scotland’s unique footballing heritage, and their role as the grand architects of world football.\n\nGraeme Brown, Founder of The Hampden Collection said, “Our Alliance is growing, and we are thrilled Lost Glasgow has joined up, and will promote our mission through their website and social media pages. Their pages are devoted to Glasgow’s changing architecture and its people throughout the last few centuries, and football is a central part of Glasgow’s history. They will help us explain Scotland’s story to an avid audience by sharing, discussing and learning about the birthplace of modern football.”\n\nFootball’s Square Mile is the home of the Scotch Professors, as they colloquially became known, who created the passing, running and inclusive game of football, and transported it to every corner of the planet. The tie-up with Lost Glasgow will provide another important voice to engage people from across the world, and we cannot wait to share the stories and events celebrating the history of the beautiful people’s game.\n\nNew Archaeological Project to Uncover One of Scotland’s Most Iconic Football Grounds – Press Statement\n\nThursday, 9th June 2022\n\nArchaeologists from Archaeology Scotland are set to kick off an exciting new project to excavate the remains of Cathkin Park, one of Scotland’s most iconic football grounds, located in the South Side of Glasgow.\n\nCathkin Park was home to Third Lanark from 1904 until their untimely and infamous demise in 1967. Their ground was abandoned with the grandstand and pavilion being demolished in the 1970’s. Amazingly, the terracing that surrounds three parts of the ground still survive, and the remains stand in memory of the teams, players and fans that once graced this iconic footballing location.\n\nCathkin Park is the second football ground to have stood on the site. The site was first used by Queen’s Park when they built the Second Hampden Park there in 1884. Last year, Archaeologists from Archaeology Scotland excavated the First Hampden Park, the worlds first purposefully built, international football stadium, which was located just a few yards away from Cathkin Park, below the Hampden Bowling Club Green and Kingsley Rose Gardens.\n\nThis new project aims to uncover the remains of Third Lanark’s former pavilion, grandstand and turnstiles. Excitingly the archaeologists also want to reveal the original goals posts of the Second Hampden, goals that Scotland’s men’s team recorded famous historical wins, and where the early Scottish Cup finals were played.\n\n“This is an amazing opportunity for Archaeology Scotland to uncover one of the most important sporting sites in the country. This is the site where many of Scotland’s earliest victories came, when it was the site of the Second Hampden Park, but it’s also an important place for fans of Third Lanark. The ground now stands as a monument to their team, and as such it’s a real privilege to be able to explore, investigate and celebrate this important site” says Dr Paul Murtagh of Archaeology Scotland, who is leading the dig.\n\nHe continues “This project forms two strands of work for us, part of it is formed by our New Audience Project, which is funded by Historic Environment Scotland. This programme is focused on working with New Scots, refugees and asylum seekers, and we feel that both sport and archaeology are ways in which we can engage with people from all over the world, help them learn about the history of Scotland and Glasgow, and help them settle into their new homes, make friends and have positive experiences. The other part of the project is our field school, where archaeology students and interested members of the public can participate in the excavation by signing up to learn more about community archaeology and get their hands dirty.”\n\nEila MacQueen, Director of Archaeology Scotland comments that “The universal appeal of football makes this site an ideal candidate for our New Audience Project, which is funded by Historic Environment Scotland. The project is designed to engage audiences that would not normally have access to heritage or archaeology. In this instance, working in the south side of Glasgow, our aim is to work with people from lots of different backgrounds, whether they have been born and brought up in the area, or have just arrived, and especially those that may be asylum seekers or recent immigrants. Football and archaeology are great ways to bring people together.”\n\nGraeme Brown, Founder of the Hampden Collection, explains, “The 2nd Hampden and New Cathkin Park are a central part of Football’s Square Mile, the world’s biggest open-air football museum. This project provides another brilliant opportunity for everyone to engage in the football history within Glasgow’s South Side and dig to uncover more heritage and cultural treasures.”\n\nHe continues “This is another important step in our mission is to gain UNESCO World Heritage Status for Football’s Square Mile, cementing its status as the world’s most important football heritage site. The modern passing and running game was developed on these sites, and exported to the world, which is now played or watched by 3.5 billion people. This Archaeology Scotland Project is another fascinating step in the journey of gaining international recognition, and we encourage everyone to get involved and learn this story. The public’s support of these projects is critical to ensure we find out what lies beneath our feet and cataloguing for future generations to enjoy.”\n\nThe project will take place from the 15th of June until the 26th of June, and members of the public are invited to come along with their brushes and garden rakes on the morning of Saturday the 25th of June between 1pm and 3pm to help clean up the terracing around the pitch, share stories and memories of the ground, and celebrate the life of Cathkin Park and all the football that took place there.\n\nThe Hampden Collection announces\n\nThe Front Three of The World Home of Football Poetry\n\n– Press Statement\n\nThursday, 19th May 2022\n\nThe Hampden Collection announces new ‘Poetic Front Three’ to encourage the masses to put ‘pen to paper’ and herald their football heroes and experiences.\n\nJulie McNeill, Poet in Chief of the Hampden Collection, is delighted to announce the appointment of two leading Scottish poets to join the team. The World Home of Football Poetry has gone from strength to strength, gathering voices from across Scotland and internationally to celebrate the past, present and future of the beautiful game. Julie warmly welcomes Stuart Kenny and Susi Briggs to complete the Poetic Front Three.\n\nStuart Kenny: poet, creative writer, football fan and journalist, takes on the role of Makar of Primo Poetica. Our Primo Poetica Collection showcases the cultural heritage and passion for football from across the footballing spectrum. Stuart says, “It’s an absolute pleasure to join The Hampden Collection as Makar of the Primo Poetica Collection. My love of football is as much about the culture – the passion, the stadiums, the rivalries, the club and national legends – as it is about the game itself, and so much of that comes from the history of the game. There’s arguably nowhere more important to the history of the sport than Football’s Square Mile in Glasgow. I can’t wait to get delving into that history and encouraging and writing poetry which captures that visceral love for the game.”\n\nSusi Briggs joins the team as Wean’s Makar and is an award-winning author, storyteller and musician, advocating and promoting visibility and literacy of the Scots language. She writes songs, poetry, stories and picture books. Susi explains, “This project isna just aboot the beautiful game but the people, the community, the stories and the heritage that surrounds it. I am excited tae be involved wi helping tae raise awareness and encourage young folk tae engage with what is an incredibly important heritage site. A site that is not just significant nationally but globally as well. The Hampden Collection is such a wonderful discovery and one worthy tae be celebrated and amplified by community voices of all ages, languages and cultures. I’m proud and delighted tae be invited tae be the Wean’s Makar o the Hampden Collection.”\n\nJulie adds, “The Hampden Collection celebrates football and poetry in all languages, through the voices of Scotland and beyond. We are proud of the beautiful game’s origin story, and as the founders of Football’s Square Mile and our UNESCO World Heritage Campaign, The Hampden Collection is helping Scotland take its rightful place as the home of world football. I’m delighted to welcome leading Scottish Poets Susi and Stuart to The Hampden Collection Team, and excited to watch the poetry collections grow and flourish under their stewardship.”\n\nJulie will continue to head up the Scottish Women’s National Team Poets Society, as she said ‘she’s not ready to let that one go’, celebrating the great strides and shattered ceilings made by the women’s game in Scotland.\n\nIf you would like to be part of the Hampden Collection’s Poetry Collection the details are here:\n\nSWNT Poets Society (Celebrating our brilliant women in football) – Julie McNeill\n\nPrimo Poetica (First Poetry, for the love of the game) – Stuart Kenny\n\nBraw Words (Poetry from the mouths of babes) – Susi Briggs\n\nThe Hampden Collection announces\n\nFootball’s Square Mile Alliance – Press Statement\n\nFriday, 11th March 2022\n\nFootball’s Square Mile Alliance launched promoting Scotland as the World Home of Football and mission for UNESCO World Heritage Status\n\nThe Hampden Collection is delighted to announce another significant milestone forming the Football’s Square Mile Alliance. This Alliance consists of a growing group of organisations supporting our UNESCO World Heritage Status campaign, including Association of Tartan Army Clubs, West of Scotland Cricket Club, Queen’s Park Football Club, Archaeology Scotland, Society for American Soccer History, Hampden Bowling Club, Glasgow Football Tour, and Friends of Cathcart Cemetery.\n\nFootball’s Square Mile contains the birthplaces of Queen’s Park, Celtic and Third Lanark, the site of Rangers’ first game, and the final resting place of several Scotch Professors. These football titans shaped the beautiful game we know today, making Glasgow the world capital of football, which at one point had the three biggest football stadiums on the planet.\n\nThis Alliance launches on the 140th anniversary of one of the Scotch Professors’ most significant victories. On 11th March 1882, Scotland recorded a magnificent 5-1 victory over England in front of 15,000 spectators at the 1st Hampden Park. This game is immortalised in a 100ft mural on the back of the 1st Hampden Pavilion at Hampden Bowling Club. The mural features Charles Campbell, Queen’s Park captain and future SFA president, and Andrew Watson, the first black international player and captain. The Hampden Collection has set a 10-year goal to reach UNESCO World Heritage Status and aims to complete the mission by the 150th anniversary of this historic match.\n\nGraeme Brown, Founder of the Hampden Collection, explains, “There are so many anniversaries coming up in the next decade. As a start, the 150th anniversary of the 1st International is this year on St Andrew’s Day. Scotland created international football at the West of Scotland Cricket Ground in Partick in 1872, and we are delighted with the West of Scotland Cricket Club’s support through joining our Alliance. Next year we celebrate the 150th birthday of the Scottish Football Association, the first unified national football association on the planet, and the 150th anniversary of the opening of the 1st Hampden Park. The 1st Hampden Park set the template for every football ground ever built.\n\nThere are more anniversaries in the following years, including the 150th year of the Scottish Cup and the 150th anniversaries of incredible victories over our closest neighbours. Our mission is to celebrate these in style and ensure everyone learns about our mission to make Football’s Square Mile a UNESCO World Heritage Site.”\n\nGraeme Baxter, Vice-Chair of The Association of Tartan Army Clubs, explains, “We are delighted to give support to the Hampden Collection, especially given this year we are celebrating how Scotland invented the modern game. The campaign towards UNESCO status would give Scottish football a greater sense of identity, and drive more people to learn and understand the history of football, especially within Glasgow itself.”\n\nThe Scotch Professor is a worldwide phenomenon; as Tom McCabe, President of Society of American Soccer History, explains, “Scotch Professors brought the modern game to North America in the 1870s. The game came hand-in-hand with Scottish industry, so much so that Andrew Carnegie once said, ‘America would have been a poor show had it not been for the Scotch.’ Scottish influencers made their mark in American soccer as players, referees, and organisers of clubs and leagues.\n\nWe heartily support the mission to make Football’s Square Mile a UNESCO World Heritage Site and the true home of world football. American soccer, nae global soccer, would have been a poor show had it not been for the Scotch Professor!”\n\nThrough our Alliance Partner Archaeology Scotland, The Hampden Collection explored the campaign’s prospects with Historic Environment Scotland. Their insight into the UNESCO process was exceptionally beneficial and constructive, and the research into each of the landmarks within Football’s Square Mile has already begun.\n\nThis launch marks another significant step forward in our journey to promote Scotland’s incredible footballing heritage and its role as the grand architects of the world’s most popular sport. The plans for St Andrew’s Day 2022 are well underway, where the Tartan Army celebrates its 150th birthday, and during this year’s World Cup, we celebrate Scotland creating international football and the World’s game. These events, codenamed #SCOENG1872, will deliver a spectacular show for the Tartan Army, and all the Scotch Professor converts worldwide.\n\nWe are looking for like-minded organisations interested in this campaign and willing to help support our mission. Please get in touch through our contact page.\n\nThe Hampden Collection announces new Official Events Partner – Press Statement\n\nFriday, 4th March 2022\n\nOver the last 4 years, The Hampden Collection has created events to tell the incredible story of the 3 Hampdens and all who played on them.
