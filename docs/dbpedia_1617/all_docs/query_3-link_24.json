        "text": "Museums Galleries Scotland Recognition\n\nWest Dunbartonshire Council's Singer Sewing Machine Collection and Singer Archive is Recognised as a Nationally Significant Collection awarded by Museums Galleries Scotland for its outstanding collection of machines and artefacts relating to the Singer Sewing Machine Factory.\n\nThe collection offers a fascinating insight into the manufacture and development of sewing machines and is the largest collection of its kind in Europe. Included in the collection are several 'first' sewing machines from as early as 1850. The museum also has a rare first model of Singer's Number 1 and the first domestic model, the Turtleback.\n\nSinger Clock\n\nThe museum also holds the only known examples of the first sewing machines to have been manufactured in the UK along with the last sewing machine to be made at the Clydebank factory before it closed its doors in 1980.\n\nAlong with rare machines, the collection also documents the workings of the Singer factory, providing a unique picture of the area's industrial links and the social history of the 16,000 people who worked there.\n\nOld Singer Sewing Machine\n\nCllr Michelle McGinty, Convener of Educational Services, West Dunbartonshire Council, said \"The Singer factory in Clydebank is a big part of our history and touched the lives of nearly every family in Clydebank with the factory employing more than 16,000 locals. We are delighted to receive this national recognition for our collection and it is a credit to everyone over the years who have kindly donated their machines to the museum for others to enjoy.\"\n\nGala Queen 1940\n\nCllr John Mooney, Depute Convener of Educational Services, said: \"This is an exceptional collection which has been built up with the help of the community for over 100 years. Many residents will remember working at the factory or remember their parents telling them stories of life at Singers and how the factory brought work to the town. This is a very proud moment for everyone connected with the factory and it is important that we maintain the collection, not only for people to enjoy today, but for future generations.\"\n\nRay Macfarlane, Chair of Museums Galleries Scotland's Recognition Committee, said: \"The quality and importance of this collection is unequivocal and it is not only of national but of international significance. This is reflected in the collection being the largest in Europe of its kind and second only to the Smithsonian Institution globally.\"\n\nOld Singer Sewing Machine\n\nFiona Hyslop, Cabinet Secretary for Culture and External Affairs, said: \"The Scottish Government's Recognition Scheme identifies and supports the most important, best-quality, collections of historic artefacts and artworks held in our museums and galleries. \"Clydebank's fascinating Sewing Machine Collection and Singer Archive brings the number of Recognised Collections in Scotland to 39, held right across the country from Kirkwall to Annan, Dundee to Inveraray and of course now in Clydebank. \"I urge everyone with an interest in Scotland's rich culture and heritage to search out, explore and learn about the many historical treasures held in our brilliant Recognised Collections.\"\n\nSome of the rarest and most prized from the collection will be displayed permanently Clydebank Town Hall Museum and Gallery, Dumbarton Road, Clydebank.\n\nSewing machine collection and Singer archive at Clydebank Museum Video\n\nSewing machine collection and Singer archive at Clydebank Museum Video\n\nImages of Singers Factory\n\nClick on the large image to start the full screen slide show.\n\nFor General Enquiries\n\nYou can call us on 01389 737555\n\nor email Clydebank Museum\n\nIf you wish to make a Singer/Sewing Machine related donation please contact Andrew Graham.\n\nEmail: singer@west-dunbarton.gov.uk\n\nTel: 07920812685\n\nUse our online enquiry form: Submit our online enquiry form.\n\nOr write to us at:"
