        "text": "Scotland’s qualification for Euro 92 in Sweden marked a historic moment for the national football team, as it was the first time they had qualified for the European Championships. This achievement was a source of immense pride for the Scottish fans, known affectionately as the Tartan Army, who traveled in large numbers to support their team during the tournament.\n\nWhen the tournament began, the Tartan Army descended upon Sweden, bringing with them a wave of tartan, kilts, and a festive spirit. The Scottish fans were celebrated for their vibrant presence, creating a carnival-like atmosphere in the host cities. Their enthusiasm and friendly demeanor endeared them to locals and rival fans alike, reinforcing their reputation as some of the most devoted and good-natured supporters in football.\n\nScotland faced a tough group stage, drawn against formidable opponents: the Netherlands, Germany, and the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS). In their first match against the Netherlands, Scotland displayed a commendable effort but ultimately lost 1-0. The fans, undeterred by the defeat, continued to rally behind their team with unwavering support.\n\nThe second match against Germany was another challenging encounter. Despite a spirited performance, Scotland succumbed to a 2-0 defeat. However, the Tartan Army’s resolve remained strong, their support unwavering as they filled the stands with chants and songs, turning the matches into memorable spectacles.\n\nIn their final group match against the CIS, Scotland achieved a historic 3-0 victory, with goals from Paul McStay, Brian McClair, and Gary McAllister. This triumph was a testament to the team’s tenacity and the fans’ relentless support. Although Scotland did not progress beyond the group stage, the Tartan Army’s presence and the team’s spirited performances left an indelible mark on Euro 92.\n\nTartan Army – Sweden 92 is a photo series by Tony Davis that follows Scotland’s Tartan Army during UEFA Euro 92 in Sweden. Davis joined Scotland fans on the terraces for their group stage matches against the Netherlands and the CIS. The limited edition A5 photo zine contains 28 black and white photographs across 32 pages.\n\n“I’ve always been fascinated by the Tartan Army, ever since seeing the hordes of Scotland fans swamp the Wembley pitch in 1977 following that historic 2-1 win against England.\n\nAs a football fan primarily interested in the culture and atmosphere away from the action on the pitch, it was completely natural for me that when I started taking photos late 80s, the Tartan Army were right at the top of my lists of international football fan groups that I wanted to follow and document.\n\nApart from the obvious – Tartan everywhere, heavy drinking and non-stop singing of the Flower of Scotland – the thing that struck me most was their good nature and humour. From what I gather they’ve self-policed themselves since the early 80s, so there’s no sign of any trouble – just high jinks and a strong sense of identity and pride.” Tony Davis\n\nA renowned documentary photographer, Davis has spent several decades building an impressive archive of football culture photos that date back to the 1980s.\n\nDuring that era, Davis has covered multiple World Cups and European Championships, including Italia 90, Euro 92, USA 94 and France 98.\n\nDavis was born in Nottingham and studied photography in 1989-1991. His work has been featured widely in newspapers and magazines such as When Saturday Comes, 442, Total Sport, ID and The Face.\n\nDuring the 90s Davis undertook two major projects involving football grounds, Firstly ‘The Football Grounds of Great Britain’ and then later he rephotographed all the 92 again for an interactive installation at The National Football Museum.\n\nAlthough known for his Rave images, football is his main passion. He photographed football and its fans between 1989-2005 extensively, not only in the UK but all around the world.\n\nThe journey to and through Euro 92 exemplified the deep bond between the Scottish team and their supporters. The Tartan Army’s travels across Sweden showcased their unwavering loyalty and the vibrant culture of Scottish football fandom.\n\nWhy are Scotland football fans called the Tartan Army?\n\nScotland football fans are affectionately known as the “Tartan Army,” a nickname that reflects their deep-rooted cultural pride and distinctive presence at matches. The term “Tartan” relates to the traditional Scottish patterned cloth, symbolising the fans’ national heritage. This passionate group of supporters is renowned for their loyalty, traveling in large numbers to support the national team both at home and abroad.\n\nThe Tartan Army’s origins can be traced back to the 1970s when Scotland’s national team began to see more international success, particularly with their qualification for the 1974 FIFA World Cup in West Germany. Scottish fans, dressed in kilts and tartan scarves, made a noticeable and colorful impact at the games, earning a reputation for their friendly demeanor and enthusiastic support.\n\nOver the years, the Tartan Army has become synonymous with a festive and inclusive atmosphere. They are celebrated not only for their vibrant dress but also for their camaraderie and sportsmanship, often engaging in good-natured interactions with rival fans. This positive reputation has helped solidify the Tartan Army’s identity as a key part of Scottish football culture, representing both a love for the sport and a celebration of Scottish identity and tradition.\n\nDon’t miss out on Lower Block’s latest news and features.
