        "text": "On paper this would be a tough outing for the islanders, West having taken the spoils on their visit north pre-Christmas.\n\nTravel for the game was via Loganair flight to Glasgow on the Saturday morning something the whole squad continue to appreciate. Flying made possible by travel assistance from the Scottish rugby union and great flexibility shown by Loganair group bookings.\n\nThe travelling squad was once more showing several changes from the week before. Scott Rendall and Scott Russell recovering from illness, Neil Campbell available and a first outing of the season for Alan (Goose) Brown. All four bringing much needed experience and aggression to the side.\n\nThe game commenced with Orkney kicking to West of Scotland on a cold, still dry day. The game moved on to a 4G artificial pitch due to a frozen grass pitch. Orkney were looking sharp and focussed on defence and attack no doubt benefitting from flying down and a short bus trip to the ground. Both sides looking to play open hard aggressive rugby.\n\nOrkney were soon on the attack in the home half. Strong running from Scott Rendall, Neil Campbell and Alan Brown causing all sorts of problems for the home defence.\n\nEight minutes in Orkney were first to score after good approach play from forwards and backs moving the point of attack from one side of the field to the other. This created mismatches in the defensive line, and it was talismanic hooker Scott Rendall who benefitted after showing strength and footwork to leave three defenders prone on the ground as he went over for the score.\n\nConnor Hancock stepped up to take the conversion, but his personal kicking tee was no where to be seen after he had left it on the pitch post warm up. His attempted drop conversion narrowly missing. Fortunately said tee was located in an obscure place tucked in at the bottom of a bin.\n\nOrkney added to their lead soon after a penalty was awarded in front of the home posts about thirty metres out. Hancock now reunited with his tee making no mistake with the kick.\n\nFifteen minutes into the half Orkney were dominating possession and territory with West struggling for field position and possession.\n\nOrkney were soon applying pressure once more deep in the home half. West in possession but Orkney pinning them back. A west clearance kick was charged down in the in goal area and scrum Half Thomson gleefully accepted the ball falling in to his grasp for an easy try. Hancock adding the conversion.\n\nFollowing the re start it was time for West to enjoy a period of possession and pressure in the Orkney half and they began working hard in the forwards, running forcefully, and testing the defence.\n\nOrkney were defending well trying to turn ball over or force a mistake. The home side up to the task moved the ball wide right before switching play left under penalty advantage to put their big centre in to space and after evading a would-be tackler went over for a try subsequently converted.\n\nUnperturbed Orkney once more made it back up field and forced another penalty in a kickable position. Hancock slotting the ball through the uprights.\n\nWith half time looming West were in the Orkney half looking to add to their points tally. Orkney conversely looking to preserve their lead.\n\nShortly before half time West managed to engineer a try. Orkney looked to have cleared their lines. From a west lineout on halfway the ball was played out to their backline.\n\nPoor tackling by Orkney allowed the west winger space and he was good enough to evade two more attempted tackles to score near the posts allowing for an easy conversion.\n\nHalf time 18 – 14 to an Orkney side edging a pulsating contest.\n\nThe second half commenced with both sides looking to try and gain some breathing space on the scoreboard. The neutral observer looking for more of the same from the teams.\n\nIt was West who scored first in the second half and take the lead for the first time in the game. From good approach play by forwards and backs the ball was played wide to the full back coming in the line at pace to power over for the try. The conversion was good from out wide.\n\nOrkney reacted to this setback by going straight on the offensive following the restart forcing a penalty. Opting for a lineout they looked to get the score. Brown and Campbell coming close.\n\nA knock on by West led to a scrum in front of the posts. Hooker Scott Rendall had to go off for some treatment to a cut above the eye. His brother Craig coming on to replace him.\n\nFrom the scrum the ball was played right, Scott Russell being stopped short out wide. The ball was recycled and scrum half Thomson was cute enough to dive and ground the ball for an unconverted try putting Orkney back in the lead by two points.\n\nThe next ten minutes of play consisted of punch and counter punch both sides trying to force an opening but both defences up to the task. Orkney did almost prise the door open up the right wing but with a two on one the Orkney player opted to carry instead of pass to his winger and the door was firmly shut.\n\nIt was West who broke the deadlock. This time from a penalty awarded forty metres out in front of the posts. Their kicker making no mistake to regain the lead by a point.\n\nUnperturbed Orkney went back on the attack. They secured good lineout ball on the home twenty-two metre line and drove forward. As the drive lost momentum Thomson took possession of the ball and then basically danced his way through the defence to score a try in the corner despite home protestations the ball had been lost in the act of scoring. Hancock once more adding the extras from an acute angle.\n\nOrkney up by six points going into the final five minutes were looking to see the game out. West however had other ideas and set about getting a converted try of their own. They then worked their way up to the Orkney try line battering against determined defence. Rebuffed time after time.\n\nThis pressure told eventually, and the score came despite Orkney calls that the ball had been held up over the line. Close to the posts the home kicker easily slotted the conversion to put them a point ahead.\n\nCredit to Orkney they went back on the offensive looking to regain the lead. Thomson even attempting a seriously ambitious forty metre drop goal that barely went twenty.\n\nDespite their efforts Orkney were unable to breech the West defence and the whistle blew to end a thoroughly entertaining advert for National league rugby. Both sides embraced knowing they had put everything in to the game for their respective clubs.\n\nFinal score 31-30 on another day Orkney could have edged the contest but still managed to add two points to their league tally, something very few out with the Orkney squad would have envisioned prior to kick off.\n\nPlayer of the match for Orkney was awarded to the returning Alan Brown for his powerful running and defence. However, in games like these the whole squad deserves the plaudits for their skill, determination and attitude. Despite the drop goal attempt William Thomson also deserves a mention for his three tries.\n\nThis Friday sees Orkney rugby club well represented at the Orkney sports awards. Orkney men’s first team in the senior team category. Orkney under 16s in the young team category and Erland Drever in the volunteer category. I’m sure All club supporters, officials and players wish them well.\n\nThis Saturday sees Orkney back at Picky for the next fixture in National 3. Howe of Fife are the visitors and will provide a stern test to this team after a fairly comprehensive win on their own patch earlier in the season. Kick off is set for 1230hrs at the Picky centre pitch.\n\nThere will also be an internal fixture involving the over 30s versus the under thirties at the KGS rugby pitch KO 1400hrs.\n\nOrkney team: Owen Griffiths, Scott Rendall, Neil Campbell, Adam Watt, Sean Corrigal, Jon Tait, Craig Brough, Alan Brown, William Thomson, Connor Hancock, James Donohoe, Graham poke, Scott Russell, Jacob Heal, Jamie Hutchison subs; Craig Rendall, Kyle Robb, Glen Brough, Derek Robb\n\nToecruncher"
