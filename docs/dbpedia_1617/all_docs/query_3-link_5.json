        "text": "The 500 Festival archival collection is held by the organization in Indianapolis. This digitized collection was created to share the 500 Festival events and traditions with the community.\n\nThe online collection includes photos and documents from past and present 500 Festival events and programs.\n\nThis collection supports and promotes awareness to the important mission and framework of the Al-Mutanabbi Street Starts Here Coalition’s focus on the lasting power of the written word and the arts in support of the free expression of ideas, the preservation of shared cultural spaces, and the importance of responding to attacks, both overt and subtle, on artists, writers, and academics working under oppressive regimes or in zones of conflict despite the destruction of that literary/cultural content – and despite the destruction of that literary/cultural content….\n\nFounded in 1915 by James A. Allison, Allison Transmission is headquartered in Indianapolis with additional manufacturing facilities in Hungary and India. The Allison Transmission archival collection is held by the company at its global headquarters in Indianapolis. This digitized collection was created to share Allison heritage with the community in celebration of the company’s centennial in 2015.\n\nThe American Turner Topics, published since 1936, is the newsletter of the American Turners. The Turner movement, begun in Germany in 1811, stresses physical fitness and German culture. German immigrants brought the movement to the United States in the 1840s and in 1850 established a national Turner association that is today known as the American Turners. The newsletter contains reports on the activities of the national organization and of individual Turner societies, obituaries of Turner members, and articles about Turner history and philosophy.\n\nIn 1893 members of the Indianapolis German-American community living on the south side of Indianapolis broke away from the Indianapolis Socialer Turnverein to form the Indianapolis South Side Turners. This organization stressed physical fitness and the preservation of German culture and was a social and cultural center for German-Americans in the southern part of the city. In 1900 the South Side Turners built their hall, equipped with a gymnasium and meeting rooms, at 306 Prospect Street. The group sold the building in 1977 and today is based in German Park on South Meridian Street.\n\nThe Athenaeum Turners is a German-American organization founded in 1851 as the Indianapolis Turngemeinde. Its original emphasis was on promoting physical fitness and intellectual development, advancing the political interests of German-Americans, and preserving German culture. The Athenaeum, the Turners' home since its opening in 1893, served as a gathering place for the Indianapolis German-American community, and members of the Athenaeum Turners were prominent leaders in the political, business, educational, and cultural life of the city.\n\nThe creation of The Birds of Indiana Web edition was funded by a grant from the Library Fund of the Indianapolis Foundation. Special thanks for their continuing support goes to Indiana University Press and John Gallman, the Director. The Birds of Indiana is reproduced in this electronic edition by special arrangements with Indiana University Press for distribution in Marion County, Indiana. Orders for this book may be placed by calling Indiana University Press: 1-800-842-6796. NOTICE: Access to this Web site is limited to locations in Marion County, Indianapolis, Indiana, and to persons who are registered users of the Indianapolis Public Library. Such locations may include, without limitation, the following: all schools, public libraries, college and university campuses located within Marion County, Indiana.\n\nThe Hett Art Gallery and Museum at historic Camp Chesterfield in Anderson, IN houses 127 years of historical documents and photographs related to the movement and religion of Spiritualism, as well as primary documents and artifacts dating back over a century to the original formation of the Indiana Association of Spiritualists (IAOS) in its museum archives.\n\nIn partnership with the Chris Gonzalez Library & Archives and with support from the IU Indianapolis University Library Faculty Digitization Grant, this digital collection provides a unique glimpse into the early, organized GLBT community in a mid-sized, Midwestern city. Presently the collection includes digital versions of, The Screamer from 1966-67 and The Works, later renamed, The New Works News, “Indiana’s gay news magazine for gay men and women,” from 1982-1989.\n\nDuring the American Civil War (1861-1865), Indiana Governor Oliver P.Morton's staff recorded thousands of the governor's incoming andoutgoing telegrams in small, bound books. The governor and his staffcommunicated by telegraph with the highest and most prominentgovernment and military leaders in the North, including PresidentAbraham Lincoln and Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton. Researchers willfind many uses of these messages. Historians studying politics andmilitary planning at the highest levels of federal and state governmentduring the Civil War will find many important communications. Personsstudying the organization and actions of Indiana volunteer regimentsand batteries will gain useful insights. Biographers, local historians,and genealogists will all learn much from consulting these records.\n\nIn collaboration with the Indianapolis Public Library, University Library digitized a collection of Local Climate Data dating from 1940 to present. The data is recorded from the Indianapolis International Airport (NOAA) and is now available via the web. Also available are several weather related newspaper articles ranging from 1936-1971. Additionally, you can view a dynamic weather calendar to view precipitation and temperature dating back to the late 1800s.\n\nThe Columbus Indiana Architectural Archives was created to collect, conserve, preserve, and promote the use of records that document the architecture, engineering, and arts associated with the built environment of Columbus, Indiana and Bartholomew County. The archives' collection includes materials on both Historical and Modernist projects, including many of the 60 plus designs by world famous architects of the last half century that are located in Bartholomew County.\n\nClothing is often a little studied area of American history, but what people wore, how it was made and who made it can offer important insights into a nation's social history. Though clothes do not the man make, they can tell you much about the men, women and children who wore them, and about the society in which they lived. Conner Prairie, an Interactive History Park located in Fishers, Indiana, holds a valuable and substantial collection of historic clothing and accessories. Heretofore, the fragile condition of many of the garments has limited their access to the public. Now, thanks to the partnership of IU Indianapolis University Library and Conner Prairie, these objects may be seen and studied the world over.\n\nAlmanacs, with their calendars, weather forecasts and astronomical information, were often coveted possessions in early American households. Indeed, one 19th-century historian claimed that almanacs and bibles \"were the two books most likely to be found in Christian\" homes. Though now lost to history one of the very first books thought to be printed in North America was an almanac published in Boston 1639.\n\nThe Conner Prairie Rural History Project (2001-2003) was an effort to capture the fast disappearing rural landscape and heritage of Hamilton County, Indiana. Funded by the Legacy Fund of Hamilton County, the project conducted over 125 oral histories with farmers, business leaders, and local citizens who shared their memories of the county’s rural past. In addition, diaries, letters and photos documenting that heritage were collected and digitized for posterity.\n\nThe preservation and continuation of traditional crafts and their skills are important to American culture. The Conner Prairie craft collection is usually limited to museum guests, scholars, and other specialized researchers. By digitizing the collection and making it widely accessible o the internet these historic artifacts and the important story they tell will be available to a mass audience, including teachers and students. This collection consists of Conner Prairie traditional crafts featuring pottery, armsmaking, and blacksmithing.\n\nTransferware was an 18th-century English innovation in ceramic decoration in which copper-plate engravings were \"transferred\" to items via a \"tissue.\" No longer was it necessary to laboriously hand-decorate ceramics like tableware, basins or tiles. This early form of mass production was an immediate success and demand grew over the early nineteenth century. Manufacturers like Spode and Wedgewood found eager markets for their deocorative, durable goods, particularly in the United States.\n\nCrispus Attucks was Indianapolis' first segregated high school built for African-Americans in 1927. It was named after Crispus Attucks, a black man who was the first American to die in the Boston Massacre in 1770, a precursor to the American Revolutionary War. In 1986, the school converted from a high school to junior high school. This digital collection captures the history of the high school through its yearbooks (1928-1986), newspapers, and graduation programs. Special thanks to the Crispus Attucks Museum and its Board of Advisors for permission to digitize their valuable collection of historical documents.

Though its status as University is still in its infancy, it has much history as a college when it was officially founded in 1937. The archives at Hackelmeier Memorial Library contain within its collection a wealth of information representing the growth of the institution, so it has been a priority of the library to find a way to both preserve and promote that content. One source of such content is a faculty-supervised, student run publication called The Phoenix (spanning the years 1937-1981).\n\nOriginally entitled Hamilton County in 1900: Through a Young Person's Lens, this collection includes the photographs of Earl Brooks (1883-1968), who acquired a camera as a young man and took pictures between approximately 1897 and 1904 of friends, teachers, the countryside and events in central Indiana, California, Kentucky and Ohio. Photographs of the Hamilton County Township Schools taken between 1892 and 1909 are also included. At the turn of the century, County School Superintendent Ellis A. Hutchens announced his wish to have a photograph taken of every Hamilton County school and here are 68 of those photographs.\n\nAlso included is the Inter-State Directory Company's directory of Noblesville and Hamilton County Gazetteer for the years 1907-1908, a countywide residential and business directory. These projects were made possible by a joint project between the Hamilton County Historical Society and the Hamilton East Public Library.\n\nThe Herron Library is home to a growing and notable Fine Press / Book Arts collection approaching 1000 items. Artist Books offer unique expressions of art that reflect the qualities, functions, and structure of the book.
