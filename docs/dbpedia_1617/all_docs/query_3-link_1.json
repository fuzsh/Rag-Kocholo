        "text": "James I, King of Scots, had spent 18 long years as a prisoner of the English King before finally being released in April 1424. He headed home feeling rather resentful due to the long time that it had taken for his ransom to have been paid. As he arrived back in Scotland James was clearly determined to assert his authority. After being officially crowned at Scone in May 1424, the Scots Parliament was hastily convened. Amidst an array of proclamations, the ban on football was enacted.\n\nThere are a number of points which can be taken from this Act of Parliament. Firstly, football must have already been a popular activity enjoyed by the wider population for an Act of Parliament to have been required to ban it. Secondly, the activity must have been deemed by the King to be a distraction or a nuisance for this measure to have been taken. Finally, we can ascertain from future attempts to ban football in Scotland that the Act must have been limited in its impact. Similar bans would be attempted by subsequent Scottish monarchs in 1457, 1471 and 1491.\n\nBack in the 1970s, this football was discovered behind wooden panelling in the Queen’s bedchamber in the Royal Palace at Stirling Castle. It has been dated back to the 1540s and within the lifetime of Mary, Queen of Scots. The ball is made from an inflated pig's bladder which is encased by cow leather. The reason as to why the ball got lodged behind the wooden panels remains a mystery.\n\nIt is known that Mary, Queen of Scots watched football. After losing the Battle of Langside in 1568 Mary fled over the border and was initially held at Carlisle Castle. A letter describing her time at the castle mentions her leaving the castle to visit a playing green…\n\n... where 20 of her retinue played at football before her for 2 hours, very strongly, nimbly, and skilfully, without foul play, the smallness of their ball occasioning their fairer play…”\n\nSaint Eloi is the Patron Saint of Hammermen. The Incorporation of Hammermen is a traditional trade organisation which can still be found in towns and cities across Scotland. The incorporation covers a range of metalwork professions, from blacksmiths and sword makers to locksmiths and goldsmiths. This rare statue of Saint Eloi was discovered after being buried for centuries under the floor of the old Rutherglen Parish Church. It is the only statue of the saint to have survived the Reformation period in Scotland.\n\nIn Perth, football was an important activity amongst the Hammermen. In order to qualify as a master, an apprentice was required to present a high quality piece of work for inspection and would afterwards be required to pay a fee to the incorporation for a “banquet and football”.\n\nIn 1546 the apprentices in Perth were forbidden from leaving their place of work in order to follow their masters out to football games. The penalty for disobeying this rule was a fine of a “pound of wax” which was to be offered to “Sanct Eloy.”\n\nThis painting by artist and historian Stuart Gibbs depicts a scene of women playing football at harvest time in the Lanarkshire village of Carstairs. In August 1628, the local church minister, Rev. John Lindsay, angrily observed men and women taking part in “footballing, dancing and barley breaks.” The latter activity was a traditional harvest game played by mixed pairs of men and women.\n\nThe wrath of the minister was mainly down to the fact that these games had taken place on a Sunday. In the eighteenth century the Scottish Kirk believed that the Sabbath should be a solemn day solely devoted to the worship of God.\n\nIt is due to the Minister’s recording of this activity that Carstairs village is the earliest known location in Europe where women are known to have played at football.\n\nThe Latin text at the beginning of the football passage describes the organisation of a game with players being picked in turn. A description of a game then follows.\n\nThe text describes some skilful play, with references to the ball being passed and even the use of goalkeepers... “you defend the goal”. Although the text is mainly in Latin, some of the passages are repeated in Scots to assist with the learning. For example, “to give the hail” means “to give the goal”. “Hail” is a traditional term for “goal”. Although the original work of 1636 has not survived there are numerous copies of the book in existence dating from the late seventeenth and early eighteenth century.\n\nThis translation is kindly provided by Graham Robertson, Teacher of Classics and former pupil of Aberdeen Grammar School.\n\nFOOTBALL\n\nLet us pick teams:\n\nYou choose the first man.\n\nThose who are on our team come over here.\n\nWho are against us?\n\nKick the ball out so we can begin the game:\n\nCome on, kick it over here.\n\nYou defend the goal.\n\nTake the ball from him if you can do it.\n\nCome on, throw yourself in his way.\n\nRun at him.\n\nKick the ball back: very well done\n\nYou do nothing to score a goal with the ball\n\nThis is the first goal\n\nThis is the second, this is the third goal:\n\nDrive him back otherwise the opposition will come out on top;\n\nUnless you watch out he will take possession of the goal:\n\nUnless we play better we are done for:\n\nHa, the victory is with you; hurrah you’ve won!\n\nHe is very skilful with the ball\n\nHad he not been there, we would have won the victory,\n\nCome on, serve me,\n\nWe still have the stronger team.\n\nIn the Berwickshire town of Duns on Fastern’s E’en (Shrove Tuesday) the local townsfolk were traditionally summoned to their annual football game by “tuck of drum”. In 1724 Bailie John Grey tried to stop the game from taking place by confiscating the drum. Although the football game went ahead, the participants were very angry at the attempt to suppress an important local custom. This displeasure led to physical action and a riot broke out within the town.\n\nIn towns across Scotland, important announcements were made by tuck of drum. A drummer took part in a formal procession through the streets and proclamations were issued at important locations such as the Mercate (Market) Cross. The drum used at Duns has not survived and the one which is featured for the purpose of the story is from the Ayrshire town of Irvine. Although the exact age of the Irvine town drum is not known it is fairly typical of the type that would have been used in towns across Scotland during the 18th and 19th centuries.\n\nRobert Burns wrote this poem as a tribute to his friend David Sillar. David was a teacher from Tarbolton in Ayrshire who was a member of the Tarbolton Bachelors Club. This society had been co-founded by Burns in 1780. The poem contains the following lines…\n\nThe honest heart that's free frae a'\n\nIntended fraud or guile,\n\nHowever Fortune kick the ba',\n\nHas aye some cause to smile.\n\nWith this particular verse, Burns uses the activity of football as a metaphor for fate. The importance of football and other ball games in Scottish life can often be seen by its wide use in poems and ballads in the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries.\n\nThis observation was made by Dr Alexander Carlyle, Minister of Inveresk Parish, and relates to the Fishwives of Fisherrow in East Lothian. The account provides an early example of a women only football game in Scotland.\n\nAlthough football games were commonly played at Fastern’s E’en (Shrove Tuesday) with the players being split into “married” and “unmarried” teams, the vast majority of these contests were men-only affairs. The minister suggests that the hard working life of the fishwives resulted in them enjoying recreational activities which were normally associated with men. It also points to the collective strength and degree of empowerment that the women enjoyed within their local community.\n\nAnother example of a women only football match can be found at Lennel, near Coldstream in the Scottish Borders in 1786. That match took place on Ash Wednesday and ended in a draw as we are told that “darkness prevented victory being declared on either side”.\n\nWe are grateful to artist and historian Stuart Gibbs for granting us permission to use the sketch.\n\nIn 1815 Sir Walter Scott and the Duke of Buccleuch organised a football match at Carterhaugh near Selkirk in the Scottish Borders. Teams representing Yarrow and Selkirk took part in the contest; the Selkirk party were identified by slips of fir with the Yarrow men wearing sprigs of heath.\n\nThe ancient banner of the Buccleuch family was carried onto the field ahead of the game amongst a fanfare of pageantry. The Duke himself threw up the ball to start the game. The first game was won by the men of Selkirk after an hour and a half’s play. The second game was won by Yarrow after a gruelling contest which lasted more than three hours. A conclusive game could not be organised and the day ended in a draw.\n\nTo commemorate the occasion, two songs were published under the title of Ettricke Garland. Perhaps the most famous lines penned by Scott which relate to the Carterhaugh Ba’ game are the following…\n\nThen strip, lads, and to it, though sharp be the weather,\n\nAnd if, by mischance, you should happen to fall,\n\nThere are worse things in life than a tumble on heather,\n\nAnd life is itself but a game at football.\n\nScottish artist Alexander Carse painted this scene of a rustic football game in 1818. Although the exact location is not known, it is thought to be from the Scottish Borders area. Carse was particularly noted for capturing scenes of everyday Scottish life and there are three known paintings of football games attributed to him.\n\nThis painting depicts the rough and ready nature of a typical rural football game at a time of great change. Between 1750 and 1850 Scotland was gradually being transformed from a country that was overwhelmingly rural and agricultural into one which was becoming increasingly urban and industrial for a majority of the inhabitants.\n\nThe scene painted by Carse was once a common sight in many of Scotland’s villages and small towns. Today these annual folk customs can only be seen in the form of Hand Ba’ in the Scottish Borders and at Kirkwall in the Orkney Isles.\n\nLike Hope, many of the other members appear to be young men from affluent families, mainly from the New Town of Edinburgh. The club archive provides a fascinating insight into the level of organisation that was required to organise games. Bladders and leather casings had to be ordered for making up the footballs, fees were paid out for leasing parks to stage the matches, a “boy” was required to assist with getting the equipment and the park set up for the games.\n\nAdditional entries in the records refer to “hail sticks” (goal posts) and in a record from 1833, there is a handwritten note outlining playing rules. Hope organised the members into categories, depending on the days in which they were available to participate in the games. This ensured that the number of players could be regulated ahead of each of the games.\n\nThis magnificent silver medallion was the “prize” awarded to the football team of the 93rd (Sutherland) Highlanders when they defeated the Edinburgh University Football Club on 25th January 1851. As the medallion was presented to the full team rather than being awarded to one of the players it can be considered to be a sporting trophy and as such is the earliest surviving example of a football trophy.\n\nThe 93rd Highlanders won the match by 3 games [goals] to nothing and true to their word, the Edinburgh University Football Club presented this medallion to the regiment afterwards. A scene from the game, which took place at Holyrood Park in Edinburgh, is engraved onto the medallion which is in the collection of the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders Museum at Stirling Castle.\n\nBy the 1850s Hope was significantly involved in the temperance movement and could see the value of healthy outdoor recreation as an alternative to the vice of alcohol. What makes his set of football rules standout for the period is the fact that they were aimed primarily at a section of Edinburgh’s working class population.\n\nTwo points within the overall rules for the Stockbridge playground are of particular interest. Point 11 states that “those in the same shop or establishment, or… in the same occupation… should form themselves into Clubs for Games.” Point 9 addresses the types of games to be played by the clubs at the park and football is singled out with a set of playing rules included.\n\nThe passage referring to the rules reads as follows:\n\nThe Game of Foot-Ball is strongly recommended, as giving most exercise and fun in a short time.\n\nThere must be no kicking of shins, nor tripping – for these are apt to produce quarrels and hurts, and do not form part of the game.\n\nThe ball is not “hailed,” [scored] unless it is sent between the posts, by one of the side whose duty it is to send it through, and unless it touch the ground.\n\nIf the ball is sent through by one of the other side, it is not “hailed.”\n\nThe Ball should not be kicked out of bounds.\n\nWhen this occurs, it should be lifted up by the hand, and brought within bounds. The party thus lifting it, is entitled to a “free kick,” but the ball must not be lifted by the hand from the ground at any other time.\n\nThe British League Cap, to distinguish sides, cost 2d, is recommended.\n\nFormed in 1857 as a former pupils team linked to the Edinburgh Academy, the earliest records relating to the Edinburgh Academical club refer to the receipt of payments, including subscription fees, made in December 1857. David R. Lyall and Alexander Crombie are amongst the first of the committee members to be referenced in the club records.\n\nThe Academical Club was a powerhouse of rugby football in Scotland, providing leadership as the game expanded during the 1860s and supplying players for the Edinburgh select team and Scotland national rugby team from the 1870s onwards. The “Accies” in tandem with a number of the other leading rugby clubs was instrumental in creating uniform playing rules for the rugby game in Scotland in 1868 (informally referred to as the Green Book).\n\nAccies played a significant role in organising the first international match of 1871 (played at Raeburn Place, their home ground) and in the formation of the Scottish Football Union (Scottish Rugby) in 1873.\n\nGlasgow’s oldest Association club was officially constituted on 9th July 1867. A passionate debate over the name of the club included titles such as “Northern”, “Morayshire” and “The Celts”, reflecting the northern roots of many of its original members. Eventually “Queen’s Park Football Club” was agreed to, in recognition of the local park in Glasgow’s south side which hosted early games.\n\nSimilar to the Foot-Ball Club of 1824, Queen’s Park’s original ethos was that “its object shall be the recreation and amusement of its members”. Games were organised three times a week and the club members were divided up into teams. It would be August 1868 before Queen’s Park would find another opponent to play against. Matches against other clubs followed.\n\nAs well as organising the world’s first official international football match under Association rules, Queen’s Park took an active interest in the playing rules and set out to grow the game by organising exhibition games in other parts of Scotland. By doing so, the club quickly turned their short passing game into a Scottish style. In March 1873 Queen’s Park organised the meeting which led to the creation of the Scottish Football Association and Scottish Cup competition.\n\nIn this match, a Scotland team, made up entirely of members of the Queen’s Park Football Club, lined up against a formidable England team. Approximately 2,500 spectators paid a shilling to watch the game. Contemporary match reports describe the difference in playing styles between the two teams. Individual play was the predominant style of the England team who used skill, pace and brawn to pilot the ball forward.\n\nThe Scots, setting up in pairs, dribbled the ball but they also played short passes to play their way around their opponents. The game ended in a draw but the systematic blend of dribbling and short passing adopted by the Scots would go on to transform the association game. The match was considered a success and led to an “explosion” of football across Glasgow and the west of Scotland with dozens of clubs springing up almost overnight.\n\nThe meeting to institute the Scottish Football Association took place at Dewar’s Hotel in Glasgow on 13 March 1873. Joining Queen’s Park at the historic first meeting were the Clydesdale, Vale of Leven, Dumbreck, Third Lanark, Eastern and Granville clubs. An eighth club, Kilmarnock FC, submitted a letter of support.\n\nAn important decision within the inaugural meeting was that the clubs in membership subscribe towards the purchase of “a Challenge Cup to be played for annually.” The Scottish Cup competition was thus born.\n\nThe first committee and office bearers were voted in and the Constitution and Rules of the Association were agreed to and framed. The earliest pages of the Scottish FA cash book primarily cover membership subscriptions, the purchase of the cup and “11 silver gilt badges” and the hosting of the international match against England in 1874."
