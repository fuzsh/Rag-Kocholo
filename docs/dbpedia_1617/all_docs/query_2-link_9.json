        "text": "Staff Spotlight: Dr Jessica Purdy\n\nDecember 20, 2023 by standrewshistory\n\nBlog written by Dr Jessica Purdy. Jess is an Associate Lecturer in Early Modern History. Her research focuses on the social history of early modern England, particularly as it concerns the history of libraries and of reading, education and identity. You can follow her on X (formerly known as Twitter) @jessicagpurdy.\n\nI first fell in love with history, and the Tudors in particular, when I was eight years old. I was asked to do a project on Henry VIII in primary school, and I felt like the bee’s knees because my dad helped me to do it on Microsoft Word whilst most of my classmates’ projects were handwritten. Both of my parents continued to indulge my obsession with history – and still do to this day, no matter how much they grumble about me ‘already having enough books’. (Side note: is it even possible to have too many books?) As a teenager, I could often be found either with my nose buried in a book about the Tudors or watching the latest episode of some Tudor-based documentary with my dad. As an adult, not much has changed, except that I now spend a lot of time in castles and palaces as well (with occasionally animated discussions with the staff).\n\nMy love of history inspired me to pursue a degree in the subject, during which I spent time studying everything from the Norman Conquest to the Crusades to the Wars of the Roses and, of course, my beloved Tudors. After graduating with my undergraduate degree in 2014, I took a two-year hiatus from education before returning to pursue an MA in Library and Information Management, perhaps thinking I could pursue a career that would allow me to indulge in my other passion: reading! But a chance meeting with one of my former history lecturers led me to a PhD scholarship for a thesis on the history of parish libraries and reading practices in early modern England, which I completed in 2021.\n\nMy first lectureship was at Manchester Metropolitan University in 2021, and I joined the University of St Andrews in 2022, but I began teaching as a PhD student. It didn’t take me very long to realise how much I love it. For me, there’s nothing more exhilarating than a classroom of engaged and passionate students who are interested in discussing and debating all things early modern. I find my interactions with students really enriching and fulfilling, and I hope to be able to continue teaching for many years to come! When I’m not teaching on the Tudors or early modern social history, my research continues to focus on the history of libraries, books and reading. I’m currently thinking about the ways in which the books people read can help shape their identities and understand the world around them.\n\nIn my spare time, when I’m not reading or dragging people around castles, I enjoy a good hike around the Scottish countryside. I can’t lie: I’m something of a fair-weather hiker and I’ve yet to brave the Scottish elements on a hike. I much prefer to stay in and do some cross-stitch on a rainy day, with a nice cup of tea, a bit of chocolate and a good film!\n\nPostgraduate Spotlight: Zachary Brookman\n\nDecember 12, 2023 by standrewshistory\n\nZachary is a second-year History PhD candidate researching printing, bookselling, and library culture in the Swiss Confederacy on the eve of the Enlightenment. He can be contacted by email (zb28@st-andrews.ac.uk) and can also be found on Twitter (@ZBrookman).\n\nWhen I was ten or eleven years old, as my parents love to remind me, I wanted to be a rabbi. As a youth I was an avid reader—I used to sit on the stoop and voraciously read the mail while my sister and the rest of the kids on our block played street hockey—and I was endlessly fascinated by the narratives of the Torah and the myriad of commentaries that attempted to legitimate and explain them. I think I also probably enjoyed the appeal of being an authority on something, a resource that others could call on for advice or guidance.\n\nBut then I had my first cheeseburger, and suddenly rabbinical studies were no longer an option. As I progressed through high school in my native Montreal, I thought I might scratch this existential itch with medical studies. Always the overachiever, I was chosen as one of only a handful of final-year students who would receive the opportunity to shadow doctors in a variety of specialisms at the Jewish General Hospital on a weekly basis ahead of the jump to post-secondary education. After a brush with a particularly dismissive dermatologist and two successive weeks in the colorectal surgery department, it became clear that medicine was not for me.\n\nAnd so, I finally turned to my true calling, one that promised to provide me with all the exegetical intrigue of a rabbi and the problem-solving opportunities of a physician but with a fraction of the prestige, renown and salary offered by either position: the historian. I obtained my B.A. in History (Honours) with a minor in German at my hometown McGill University, during which time I had the opportunity to spend a semester abroad at University College London. I was much impressed by the comparatively smaller class size and seemingly higher attention to pastoral care, and vowed I would return to the UK as a postgraduate. True to my word, in 2021, with no Reformation course on offer that year, I was roped into an MLitt at this great University of St Andrews in the ‘History of the Book’. I have not looked back since.\n\nI am now in the middle of the second year of my PhD, having traded the sixteenth century for the seventeenth, studying printing, bookselling, and library culture in the Swiss Confederacy on the eve of the Enlightenment under the supervision of Professor Andrew Pettegree and Dr. Arthur der Weduwen. The Swiss Confederacy was, in many ways, an anomaly of early modern European statecraft: A multilingual (German, French, Italian, Romansch, Latin) and bi-confessional (Catholic and Reformed Protestant) defensive alliance of administratively diverse cantons that existed over much of the area of modern-day Switzerland from the fourteenth century to 1798. The unique cultural and political makeup of the Swiss Confederacy, I would argue, had enormous consequences for the seventeenth-century Swiss book trade both at home and abroad, allowing it to reimagine and reorient itself away from traditional markets as the Thirty Years’ War (1618-1648) devastated most of Europe. By looking at the Swiss book trade as a whole and accounting for all languages spoken and printed in the Swiss lands, my project seeks to paint a more complete picture of the factors and figures that made the Swiss Confederation the centre of multilingual printing in Europe in the seventeenth century. I am supported in these efforts by the Universal Short Title Catalogue, for which I proudly work as a postgraduate team member, and the Canadian Centennial Scholarship Fund.\n\nWhen I’m not drowning in (digital) piles of bibliographic references or questioning the voracity of a Genevan false imprint, you can likely find me at one of Fife’s many fabulous farmers markets with my brilliant partner Maud and our dog Bug or somewhere soliloquizing about Everton F.C.’s most recent outing. Although I read considerably less than I did when I was a boy (at least for pleasure), I am an avid collector of seventeenth-century Helvetica and am known to enjoy the occasional record fair as well.\n\nPostgraduate Spotlight: Basil Bowdler\n\nOctober 10, 2023 by standrewshistory\n\nBasil is a second-year Modern History PhD candidate investigating the Anglo-Dutch public sphere in the late seventeenth century. He can be contacted by email (bb219@st-andrews.ac.uk) and can also be found on Twitter (@BasilBowdler).\n\nBorn and raised in London, Basil’s love of history was first fed by the screen. Simon Schama and Elizabeth Taylor (i.e., Cleopatra) were early heroes of his. It took a little longer for Basil to appreciate historic buildings, though. Visiting the Vatican at age fourteen he flatly commented ‘I don’t believe in God, what am I doing here?’ Basil’s dad, a long-term employee at English Heritage, was speechless. Thankfully for his dad, Basil was lucky enough to be taught by three charismatic and passionate history teachers (Henley Henley-Smith, James Newton, and Benjamin Dabby), who helped him to focus his enthusiasm for history. After finishing school, Basil spent a year working in his local pub and travelled from St Petersburg to Shanghai by train. He firmly resists calling this a gap year.\n\nWhen he went on to study history at Oxford, Basil was initially drawn to late-medieval Britain. His undergraduate dissertation explored the masculinity of Edward III and his court’s chivalric culture. A second-year lecture on mass communication in fourteenth-century England was a watershed moment which ignited Basil’s interest in public politics and political communication. Two factors were decisive in his pivot towards the seventeenth century. The first was a third-year paper on Britain during the turbulent years of the Commonwealth and Oliver Cromwell’s Protectorate. The second was another film, The Draughtsman’s Contract. Having swallowed the Kool-Aid of all those wigs and flowery words, Basil went to Cambridge to study an MPhil in Early Modern History. There are many ways to look after yourself during a global pandemic. Spending nine months mostly in one room writing about patriotism and xenophobia during the reign of William III is not necessarily one of them.\n\nAfter a year back in London, Basil began his PhD in St Andrews in autumn 2022. His thesis focuses on Anglo-Dutch diplomacy and public relations from 1685 to 1713. In the face of a Dutch invasion of Britain and a century of economic and political conflict between the two peoples, how did the English and the Dutch manage to fight together against France for twenty-five years? Basil is trying to answer this question by focusing on the activities of Anglo-Dutch diplomats. Rather than viewing diplomacy as an elite and rather secretive business, he is keen to emphasise the lengths that seventeenth-century diplomats went to in order to actively shape public opinion abroad.\n\nAlongside his PhD, Basil is an associate of the Universal Short Title Catalogue and blog editor for the Northern Early Modern Network. He set up the St Andrews Early Modern Workshop this year, along with Zachary Brookman. At the end of the day, Basil goes back to St Salvator’s Hall, where he’s an Assistant Warden.\n\nWhen he’s not struggling to translate Dutch pamphlets or shutting down parties at 3am, Basil likes to unwind with a book or by going for a run. He’s finally come round to visiting old buildings too and is enjoying exploring the history of Scotland through its castles and churches. He still enjoys going to the cinema, though there’s always the risk that a good historical epic will convince him to go off and study something apart from the seventeenth century.\n\nStaff Spotlight: Dr Sarah Leith\n\nMay 4, 2023 by standrewshistory\n\nBlog written by Dr Sarah Leith. Sarah is an Associate Lecturer in the School of History, her work focuses on on environmental thought and spirituality in twentieth century Scotland. You can follow Sarah on twitter (@quarry_wood), or email hiscomms@st-andrews.ac.uk if you have a contribution to our alumni magazine.\n\nThere were two things which sparked my love of history at a young age: Blue Peter and my grandparents’ St Andrews ghost stories. Unfortunately, I never received a coveted Blue Peter badge, but I still very much love history and books, and I shall happily tell willing ears all about Archbishop Sharp’s phantom coach. Growing up in St Andrews, I was lucky to be surrounded by the remains of Scotland’s past, from the Cathedral to the Castle to the Swilcan Bridge. St Andrews has a rich heritage, and Mary Queen of Scots seems to have slept in an ever-increasing number of bedrooms in its historic centre. This includes a room next to my new office, but sadly I have no paranormal occurrences to report, as yet. Wait, what was that…\n\nBoth town and gown have inspired my history career. In 2010, I was given a red gown, ready to set off on the first of many pier walks. Following my graduation, I worked in the School of Modern Languages Office, and then as a museum assistant at the British Golf Museum. I knew I wanted to continue to combine town, gown and history, and, inspired by Professor Roger Mason, I began an MLitt in Scottish Historical Studies. Fast-forward six years, and pulling on a blue gown this time, I graduated with my PhD. (By the way, the University of St Andrews holds excellent graduation garden parties.)\n\nMy research considers twentieth-century Scotland, with my focus being on environmental thought and spirituality during this period. I am especially interested in nature writing, and my current research is about Dundee writer and hillwalker Sydney Scroggie, the author of The Cairngorms Scene and Unseen. An article I have written about Syd Scroggie’s writing and intellectual thought is being published by Northern Scotland. Feeling inspired, I am hoping that I shall soon be able to say that I have been up more than just the Lomond Hills! Within the School of History, I am an Associate Lecturer (Education Focused), as well as the Communications Director and the editor of our alumni magazine, The St Andrews Historian. If you would like to be included in our ‘Alumni News’ section, please do send me an email to the following address by the end of May 2023: hiscomms@st-andrews.ac.uk. I also run the social media pages and website of the Institute of Scottish Historical Research (ISHR), so please follow us @ISHRStAndrews!\n\nWhen I am not writing, talking or tweeting about history and literature, I enjoy sport and keeping fit. My proudest sporting achievement remains being appointed my school’s Captain of Tennis, and I still enjoy playing tennis and golf in the warmer months. In the winter, though, I am usually found at the gym or in a swimming pool. I am yet to brave the North Sea, but I am increasingly tempted by the Castle Sands pool, and paddle-boarding looks like a lot of fun. My great-grandfather used to swim from the pier to the West Sands, covered head to toe in grease for much-needed insulation, and he was also a + 1 golfer. I think it is safe to say that I shall attempt neither of these physical feats. According to Old Tom Morris, the ‘Grand Old Man of Golf’, all St Andrews bairns are born excellent swimmers and golfers; well, I hope I never bump into the ghost of a very disappointed Old Tom along Pilmour Links.\n\nStaff Spotlight: Joanna Hambly\n\nApril 5, 2023 by standrewshistory\n\nBlog written by Joanna Hambly. Joanna is a Research Fellow in the School of History, her work focuses on the archaeological heritage of Scotland’s coast. You can check out some of Joanna’s work on the SCAPE website here\n\nIn January 2009, I joined the small group of researchers chaired by Professor Chris Smout collectively known as the SCAPE Trust, in a project development role. The contract was supposed to last eight months. Fourteen years and many projects later, I am still here. You may not even know there are archaeologists (and even a geologist) who work out of the basement of the School of History.\n\nSCAPE carries out research on the archaeological heritage of Scotland’s coast. As part of our work, we document how coastal processes impact archaeological sites. We are revealing evidence from past environments and learning how climate change will impact Scotland’s coastal archaeological resource in the future. Our methods involve the communities where we are working. Including volunteers in coastal surveys and projects allows locally held knowledge to improve heritage records. Information about changes to the coasts experienced by the people living there is also of great value to us.\n\nWe are currently in the second year of a five-year project carrying out community coastal surveys, filling in some of the gaps along coastlines that have not yet had a systematic archaeological survey. We use predictive models to forecast how coastal processes and the impacts of climate change will affect coastlines to target our surveys (well our geologist Sarah does this part!). Despite the benefits of technology, there is no replacement for boots on the ground. That’s why Sarah and I walked a good deal of the coast from Inverness to Johnshaven between April and October last year in the company of a great many different and wonderful people.\n\nAlthough our research focuses primarily on Scotland, people worldwide are very interested in our approach and are eager to hear about our work. This takes us to many interesting places and brings international colleagues to Scotland to experience our stunning coastal heritage and learn from community projects going on around the country.\n\nIn life before St Andrews, I worked as an archaeologist in the commercial sector in the UK and France, held a four-year post on the UNESCO World Heritage Site of Abhayagiriya in Sri Lanka, and for ten years, managed community heritage services for the Heritage Trust of Lincolnshire. I have degrees in Archaeology and Quaternary Science.\n\nThis varied experience prepared me well to make the most of my hugely enjoyable and rewarding role within the School of History. Although a lot of the work is pure project management, there is always the opportunity, and indeed the necessity, to investigate and learn about an incredibly diverse range of subjects. One of these is Scotland’s earliest coastal manufacturing industry, salt making. My interest in this started many years ago when I directed the excavations of the sixteenth-century salt pans at Brora. I’m honoured to be editing a new book on the history and archaeology of the Scottish salt industry with Chris Whatley – which will be in the bookshops in September!\n\nOutside of work, you can find me in the garden, on a walk (usually at the coast), or helping out at the Wemyss Caves (which you should visit if you haven’t already done so).\n\nStaff Spotlight: Dr Bill Jenkins\n\nMarch 23, 2023 by standrewshistory\n\nBlog Written by Dr Bill Jenkins. Dr Jenkins is a Lecturer in Nineteenth-Century British History, his research focuses on the history of science in late eighteenth and early nineteenth-century Scotland. You can check out Bill’s personal website here or follow him on twitter @BillHWJenkins\n\nIn 1986 I was a rather unenthusiastic 19-year-old zoology student at the University of Aberdeen. I always had a passionate interest in history but was advised by family and teachers to concentrate on science at school. I dropped the subject with much regret at an early stage of my secondary school career. But my love of history never waned and I spent much of my free time as a teenager with my nose in history books. During that year, I came across a reference in a zoology textbook to a work entitled Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation by Robert Chambers. This was a great evolutionary epic published in 1844, 15 years before Darwin’s Origin of Species. This brief, passing reference made me wonder whether there was more to the history of evolution than the triumphalist accounts of Charles Darwin’s life and discoveries fed to undergraduate biology students and found in many popular science books.\n\nA few years later, in my early twenties, I found myself working in a bookshop in Glasgow. While life in many ways was good, it was not what I wanted to do for the rest of my days. Casting around for what to do next, it occurred to me that Chambers and his remarkable book would make a wonderful subject for a PhD. I approached Professor John Henry at the University of Edinburgh with my ideas, and to my delight, he agreed to supervise my project. Sadly for me, the stars failed to align and my funding applications were unsuccessful. So, a sadder but wiser man, I took a job as a desk editor with Longman’s higher education division in Harlow and set my sights on a career in publishing. At the same time, I still wanted to direct my passion for history towards some goal, so I studied for a degree at the Open University in my spare time.\n\nVarious editorial jobs subsequently took me to London, back to Glasgow, to Madrid, and then back to Glasgow again. Years and then decades went by, and I was now in my early forties. It seemed that there would never be a better time to make one final attempt to achieve my ambition to study for a doctorate in the history of science. I got in touch once again with John Henry at Edinburgh, who had been so enthusiastic about my ideas all those years ago. Fortunately for me, he was still there and still interested in my project and agreed to supervise it. To my joy, this time one of my funding applications came good and the rest, as they say, is history.\n\nHere I am, more than a decade later, teaching 19th-century British history at the University of St Andrews, with a monograph on Evolution before Darwin and a dozen or so journal articles to my name. F. Scott Fitzgerald once wrote that ‘there are no second acts in American lives’. I think I can conclusively demonstrate that, with a bit of luck and perseverance, life can have as many acts as you want it to have.\n\nPostgraduate Spotlight: Islay Shelbourne\n\nMarch 9, 2023 by standrewshistory\n\nIslay is a second-year Environmental History PhD candidate investigating how Californian perceptions of health and nature influenced the state’s experiences of the 1918-19 influenza pandemic. She can be contacted by email (igs1@st-andrews.ac.uk) and can also be found on Twitter (@islayshelbourne).\n\nGrowing up in Hertfordshire, Islay’s gateway to what she hopes is a lifetime of historical study came, as all good things do, by way of a book. Having blitzed through all the pony books the school library had to offer, her parents handed her War Horse by Michael Morpurgo, igniting a burning passion for the past. From here, Islay enjoyed a typical historian’s childhood filled with National Trust properties, Horrible Histories books and many episodes of Time Team. Any career aspirations in archaeology though were quickly assuaged at age 9, on her first and only dig when she realised quite how much mud was involved in the process.\n\nKnowing that her future lay in the past, Islay chose her undergraduate university before she chose her GCSEs and five years on started a BA in Modern and Contemporary History at Queen Mary, University of London. Here she enjoyed studying British, French, German and Russian history from the 1800s-present, as well as several Museum Studies courses and a swashbucklingly good module on the history of piracy. Islay was drawn to the study of scientific and technological advancement, but it was in her second and third-year medical history classes that she discovered her true passion for the history of science and medicine. Her undergraduate thesis, harking back to her early War Horse inspiration, investigated the work of the British Army Veterinary Corps during the First World War. She expanded on this subject in a talk on the Corps’ legitimizing efforts related to mange treatment for the Equine History Collective 2022 Conference.\n\nFollowing her undergraduate degree it was another book, Laura Spinney’s Pale Rider: The Spanish Flu of 1918 and How it Changed the World, which turned Islay’s attention to the history of the 1918-19 influenza pandemic and the development of virology as a discipline. She pursued this interest during her MRes Historical Research at the Institute of Historical Research, where she was also introduced to the field of environmental history. Equipped with a new methodological approach to studying the diseases of the past, Islay joined the rest of the world in gaining unfortunate first-hand experience of a pandemic while completing her MRes between 2019-2021. Her thesis applied Thomas S. Kuhn’s theory on the development of scientific revolutions to a study of British bacteriological debates on the aetiology of the 1918-19 influenza.\n\nIslay started her PhD in Environmental History in September 2021. She intended to complete an environmental history of the 1918-19 pandemic, focussing on how pandemic experiences changed people’s perceptions of nature. A year and a half on, her thesis has changed in scope and scale but not subject. Her provisional title, ‘In California the Prognosis is Good’ Legacies of Health and Nature in California and their Impacts on Reactions to the 1918-19 Influenza Pandemic’, now situates her research on Californian experiences of the pandemic. It will explore how the state’s citizens’ pre-existing understanding of health and nature influenced medical and lay responses to influenza in 1918.\n\nOutside of her PhD, Islay is a tutor for MO1008: Themes in Modern History, a Writing Retreat organiser with CEED, and is the Events and Social Media Assistant for the ERC-funded ‘Everyday Dictatorship’ Project. Islay is also the Website Officer for the Northern Environmental History Network.\n\nWhen not working, Islay continues to be an avid reader and also enjoys the challenge of learning Polish. Despite four years of classes, the grammar still gives her a headache! When she can find the time, she enjoys painting and digital art and is steadily befriending all of St Andrews’ cats.\n\nStaff Spotlight: Dr Elise Watson\n\nFebruary 24, 2023 by standrewshistory\n\nBlog written by Dr Elise Watson. Dr Watson is a historian of early modern print, gender, and religious coexistence, and a current staff member of the Universal Short Title Catalogue Project. She is also the Managing Editor of Brill’s Book History Online. You can follow her on Twitter at @elisewatson\n\nLike many historians and academics, I was an avid reader from birth. By the age of eight, I had polished off nearly every children’s book about anthropomorphic animals at the small public library in my hometown of Geneva, Illinois, and by high school I had finished the shelves on Shakespeare. It would have blown my tiny eight-year-old mind at the time to learn that one day, I would be done reading about warrior cats and Redwall Abbey and it would be my job to read, think, teach, and talk about books.\n\nIn 2017, I came to St Andrews as a Master’s student to study Reformation and book history, and knew immediately that this was the place for me. One PhD later, I am happily a postdoctoral researcher employed by the Universal Short Title Catalogue project, a website and search tool which allows users to search all books published in the first age of print. I get to teach courses on bibliography, work with materials in University Collections, and look at old books (albeit mostly on my computer screen) every single day. Looking at book data allows me to get to know seventeenth-century French melon sellers, learn about snowball fights, and investigate murders.\n\nMy interest in the Reformation led me to a PhD thesis on how print sustained marginalised religious communities in the seventeenth century. In particular, my project focused on the Catholic community in the Dutch Republic, today the Netherlands. This was a large minority that, although public practice of their religion was illegal, they nevertheless bribed the local police to let them worship anyway, built ostentatious house churches, and yes—printed and read their own books! I am particularly interested in the role women played in this book trade: in 2021 along with Nora Epstein and Jessica Farrell-Jobst, I organised a conference on gender and book history, and the resulting edited volume will (fingers crossed) come out this year, along with the book resulting from my thesis.\n\nI don’t spend all of my time buried under a pile of books. Since moving here I’ve become obsessed with the Scottish landscape in all its glory: coastal walks, hills, munros, foraging during wild garlic season, and even the occasional freezing dip in the North Sea. I’m always down to bake or prepare an elaborate spread, especially a summer barbecue, and am in a perpetual search for the darkest roast coffee in Scotland. However, the books are never far: in my spare time, I’m currently working on a research side project on the history of Christian apocalypticism and its importance in current right-wing conspiracy theories like QAnon.\n\nI also still do love to read for pleasure. If you came here for a recommendation, my current obsession is the novel Matrix by Lauren Groff, an imagined life of twelfth-century poet Marie de France where she becomes an abbess in rural England and transforms her convent into a visionary queer feminist utopia. The line Groff draws between the sacred and profane is one that I strive to emulate in my own research!\n\nPostgraduate Spotlight: Ruadhán Scrivener-Anderson\n\nFebruary 17, 2023 by standrewshistory\n\nRuadhán is a first-year PhD student working on the national identity and social status of Scottish army officers prior to and during the First World War. In his spare time, he is an enthusiastic historical reenactor. Connect with Ruadhán and follow him on Twitter (@1914_Subaltern).\n\nA native of Fife, Ruadhán has spent his whole life immersed in Scottish history. A childhood spent visiting castles, museums and battlefields fostered a general interest in the past. From the age of ten, after being given a book of soldiers’ accounts by his grandfather, the First World War became something of an obsession. Growing up in the historic recruitment area of The Black Watch, Scotland’s most famous regiment, it is perhaps unsurprising that this unit became the focus of his research. Some of his earliest memories are of playing with an old sword in a dusty attic; two decades later it would transpire that it had been carried to war by one of the men who are now the subject of his PhD.\n\nAttracted by the opportunity to study Scotland in the First World War, Ruadhán began his undergraduate degree in history at the University of Dundee in 2017. In the same week, he joined Scots at War Living History Society, a historical re-enactment group dedicated to portraying Scottish soldiers of the Great War. He discovered a passion for bringing the past to life. Unexpectedly, this hobby led to his first foray into academia. Whilst volunteering at the Black Watch Museum he contributed a short chapter to The Black Watch and the Great War (2020), edited by Fraser Brown and Derek Patrick, and realised that he quite liked writing about the regiment. Subsequently, his undergraduate dissertation examined the 1st Battalion, The Black Watch, during the retreat from Mons in 1914 and their portrayal in the media. This included a demographic study of the battalion, leading to the realisation that while over 90% of the soldiers were Scots, the officers who led them originated from places as diverse as Australia, Ceylon, Sweden and even Germany.\n\nNow set on a career as a historian and determined to get to the bottom of how Scotland’s military leaders were chosen, Ruadhán undertook a Master of Research degree under the supervision of Professor Graeme Morton. He focused on 147 regular (full-time, professional) officers of The Black Watch between 1902-1914. His dissertation analysed how national identity and social status affected the selection of officers in the army, and how these concepts shaped individual and group dynamics (spoiler: you can be Scottish without being born there!)\n\nHaving returned to Fife in 2022, Ruadhán’s PhD project examines the officers of The Black Watch from 1902 to 1918 (2087 individuals). Under the Supervision of Dr Derek Patrick and Professor Sir Hew Strachan, his research aims to establish how officers were selected in a Scottish regiment prior to and during the First World War with specific reference to the impact of national identity and social status on the process. Additionally, it examines leadership and esprit de corps through relationships between officers and soldiers under their command, analysing how they were affected by different national and social origins. Rather than studying battles and armies, this type of military history concerns everyday life and social activities, from the barrack room to the ballroom.\n\nIn addition to his PhD research, Ruadhán is a Senior Libraries and Museums Assistant with the university’s archival collections. He is frequently found exploring the depths of the archive or diving down rabbit holes of university or local history. Unwilling to leave his project at the office, he spends much of his spare time in the uniform of an Edwardian army officer, at the head of a long-suffering band of living historians and frequently up to his kilt in mud!\n\nPostgraduate Spotlight: Jessica Secmezsoy-Urquhart\n\nNovember 23, 2022 by standrewshistory\n\nBlog post by Jessica Secmezsoy-Urquhart. Jessica is currently in the fourth year of their PhD on the history of Renaissance disability at the University of St Andrews. Their thesis focuses on the royal court roles of neurodiverse fools and bodilydiverse dwarfs and giants with a court history and disability studies approach. They have written for or contributed videos on history, disability. and similar topics and issues to The Skinny, Film Stories, BBC Social, and BBC Scotland among others and are writing a novel, Life Goes On, about their Dede’s childhood in 1940-50s Istanbul they hope to publish after graduation. They can be contacted as a PhD Historian at jyesu@st-andrews.ac.uk , online as JessicaAKA., and as a writer at Bookseeker Agency.\n\nJessica Secmezsoy-Urquhart is a Scottish/Turkish, LGBT, autistic, disabled, and chronically ill working-class person near the end of a PhD in History at the University of St. Andrews. Leaving John Ogilvie High School at 16, the impact of their conditions on their studies at Langside college left the University of Glasgow admissions team unconvinced they could achieve the Higher grades (3 As) set as a conditional offer to get into the University of Glasgow to do an undergraduate degree in History/English. They did not achieve 3 As. They received an A, two A*s and an A in Advanced Higher English. They developed a firm interest in royal court, social, and cultural histories, especially of marginalised groups. However, it was their passion for disability activism and studies, hearing a story concerning a Plantagenet jester (who were usually disabled), and their love of the varied poor and rich disabled characters like Tyrion Lannister explored in A Song of Ice and Fire which finally made them to decide to focus specifically on the still understudied history of disabled court fools, giants, and dwarfs at European royal courts in the 1400s-1600s for their MA (Hons) thesis. Jessica achieved a First-Class Honours Degree in 2016 and was awarded the prize for best Medieval Dissertation of their graduating year.\n\nA one year taught degree at Glasgow saw them submit a thesis on the animal history of vermin and parasites but following rejection for funding they were unable to take up their PhD in 2017 and had to take a year out. This was an unexpected blessing as they wrote, directed, and produced their first short film, Constant Companion, a surreal exploration of intrusive thoughts, trauma, and abuse. This gave them experience collaborating on work with others in a new medium and gave them the chance to take up a contributor role for BBC Social which made them committed to making history more accessible via tv, podcasts, film, and internet content. At this time in late 2018, they took up a place for MScR History with Dr Cordelia Beatie and Dr Jill Burke supervising on Jessica’s thesis which they achieved a Distinction for and involved a deeper study into how Scotland’s royal court use of fools and wonders was both unique to its own culture but also part of a wider European trend. The work in particular made clear how under-utilised yet insightful Scottish archival accounts tied to the court are for Renaissance disabled history.\n\nSince 2019, Jessica has pursued a PhD at St Andrews entitled ‘The Book of the Disabled Courtier’ under (now retired) Professor Rab Houston, Dr Amy Blakeway, Dr Ana Del Campo, and Dr Sarah Carpenter. It looks at the royal court roles of neurodiverse fools and bodilydiverse dwarfs and giants with a court history, disability studies, and comparative focus on Renaissance England, Scotland, and Britain. It was after returning to uni following their first research trip to London that Britain entered lockdown. Working remotely with a shielding parent and disabled themselves, Jessica was forced to confront that ableism is so prevalent in modern Britain that the lives of the disabled were viewed less worthy during the pandemic and still are in this time only ‘post-pandemic’ for those who are low risk, despite what government policies might suggest. Such events have greatly increased Jessica’s existing commitment to telling good histories of Renaissance disability through a truly disability studies approach. During PhD they have tried to make videos and appear on podcasts to make disabled history as accessible as possible. They also hope to pursue teaching or a postdoc on the topic of how modern ableism found its origin in early modern imperial Britain between 1666-1800, which led roles like court fool and dwarf to disappear in a very different Britain and world."
