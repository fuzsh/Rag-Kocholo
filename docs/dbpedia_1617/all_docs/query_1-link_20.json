        "text": "The full WoSFL fixture list for 2024-25 has been published in the past week, while the draw has also been made for the first round of the South of Scotland Challenge Cup.\n\nAnd the picture was (very nearly) completed on Friday night when the West of Scotland Cup first and second rounds were re-drawn after an administrative error by league officials.\n\nOnly after the original draw was made on July 8 did the mistake come to light, when Petershill FC contacted WoSFL top brass to point out that they’d been kicked out of this season’s competition for fielding an ineligible player in the 2023-24 tournament.\n\nThe only tournament draw which has yet to be made is for the Scottish Junior Cup, which will take place on a date yet to be announced.\n\nWith the first round of WoSFL matches now just a week and a half away, coaches all over Ayrshire are fine-tuning their squads, with plenty of friendly action taking place across the region on Saturday.\n\nFriendly results
