        "text": "The ICC Men’s T20 World Cup 2024 in the West Indies and the USA will see the top 20 cricket nations from around the globe battle for the coveted trophy from June 1 to 29.\n\nThe ninth edition of the T20 World Cup will be the biggest one in the tournament’s history with 20 teams playing 55 matches across nine cities - six in the West Indies and three in the USA.\n\nWest Indies, who hosted the T20 World Cup in 2010, and defending champions England are the most successful nations in the men’s T20 World Cup with two titles each. However, both teams will miss their star all-rounders at the tournament.\n\nFormer West Indian captain Jason Holder was replaced by Obed McCoy due to an injury while Ben Stokes, who top-scored against Pakistan in the T20 World Cup 2022 final, opted out due to lack of fitness.\n\nWest Indies are in Group C while England are in Group B.\n\nThe much-anticipated India vs Pakistan Group A clash will be played at the Nassau County International Cricket Stadium in New York on June 9.\n\nThe last time India and Pakistan clashed at the T20 World Cup in 2022, Virat Kohli’s unbeaten 82 sealed an improbable victory for the inaugural champions against their arch-rivals.\n\nICC Men’s T20 World Cup 2024 teams and groups\n\nGroup A: India, Pakistan, Ireland, Canada, USA\n\nGroup B: England, Australia, Namibia, Scotland, Oman\n\nGroup C: New Zealand, West Indies, Afghanistan, Uganda, Papua New Guinea\n\nGroup D: South Africa, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Netherlands, Nepal\n\nThe top two teams from each group will progress to the Super Eight stage, which will see eight teams, divided into two groups of four, compete for semi-final spots.\n\nThe West Indies and the USA qualified for the World Cup as co-hosts.\n\nThe eight best-placed teams from the T20 World Cup 2022 - England, Pakistan, India, New Zealand, South Africa, Sri Lanka, Australia and the Netherlands - gained automatic qualification. Afghanistan and Bangladesh qualified through T20 team rankings.\n\nIreland and Scotland progressed through the European qualifier while Canada confirmed their berth by emerging victorious in the Americas qualifier. Papua New Guinea won the East Asia-Pacific qualifier. Nepal and Oman advanced from the Asia qualifier while Namibia and Uganda qualified from Africa.\n\nUganda’s 43-year-old off-spinner Frank Nsubuga will become the oldest player to play in a T20 World Cup if he takes the field in the United States and the West Indies.\n\nWest Indies, England, India, Australia, Pakistan, New Zealand, South Africa and Bangladesh have featured in all the previous eight editions. Meanwhile, USA, Canada and Uganda will be making their T20 World Cup debuts.\n\nUSA, Canada, Namibia, Scotland, Oman, Papua New Guinea, Uganda, the Netherlands and Nepal are the nine associate teams taking part in the competition."
