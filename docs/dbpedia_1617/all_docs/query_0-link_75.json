        "text": "There is just one warm-up match to go before the Scotland squad fly out to Germany for Euro 2024 - but who will be on that plane?\n\nAfter naming a provisional squad of 28, Steve Clarke must trim that to 26 players by Friday's midnight deadline - hours after that final friendly against Finland at Hampden Park.\n\nThere are fitness concerns for the head coach to weigh up, plus Lyndon Dykes and Ben Doak are out of the tournament after suffering injuries.\n\nAndy Robertson: Scotland aiming to create history at Euro 2024\n\nMorgan added to Scotland's provisional Euro 2024 squad\n\nScotland call up Conway as Doak pulls out of Euro 2024 squad\n\nScotland's Euro 2024 fixtures and route\n\nEuro 2024 fixtures, full schedule, groups and venues\n\nHere's a look at who is almost guaranteed a spot on the plane to Germany and those who might face an anxious wait to see if they make the cut...\n\nDecisions in defence\n\nStarting with the goalkeepers, Clarke named four in his initial squad with No 1 Angus Gunn and Zander Clark expected to travel but what will happen to Craig Gordon and Liam Kelly?\n\nIt is expected one will miss out, so the decision will come down to experience or game-time. Kelly featured in every league match for Motherwell but has just one cap for the national team. Gordon, however, has 74 caps to his name and at 41 years old, would bring experience, but has only played seven games since suffering a double-leg break in December 2022.\n\nIn front of the 'keepers, Jack Hendry, Ryan Porteous, Scott McKenna, Andy Robertson, Greg Taylor, Kieran Tierney and Liam Cooper will be in the squad, as will Grant Hanley who is back after fitness concerns plus Ross McCrorie and Anthony Ralston who are Clarke's right-back options after injuries.\n\nHowever, what will happen to John Souttar? The defender missed Rangers' last three games of the season and did not feature in the friendly against Gibraltar. With seven centre-backs in the squad - one may miss out.\n\nThe midfield make-up\n\nAgain Clarke will know the vast majority of his midfielders who will travel - including the likes of Ryan Christie, Billy Gilmour, Kenny McLean, John McGinn, Callum McGregor and Scott McTominay.\n\nBut what will happen to Stuart Armstrong and Ryan Jack? Armstrong - who has not played due to injury since mid-April - should return to training next week but is he fit enough? And the same question could be asked of Jack who came on for 17 minutes on Monday, having last played in March.\n\nStriker surprise?\n\nWith Dykes and uncapped Liverpool youngster Doak out, Che Adams and Lawrence Shankland give Clarke two options and James Forrest will provide width in the final squad.\n\nHowever, could the uncapped Tommy Conway also be heading to Germany? Clarke promoted the Bristol City striker from the U21 side - just 24 hours after he scored against Turkey - while Scotland struggled past Gibraltar.\n\nThe day before Scotland's squad needs to be finalised, Clarke also added in Lewis Morgan who has impressed in the MLS - scoring nine goals for New York Red Bulls this season.\n\nShould Conway or Morgan get a chance against Finland and impress, a place in the final 26 could await.\n\nScotland's Euro 2024 schedule\n\nScotland have history kicking off tournaments, having been drawn to face Brazil in the opener at World Cup 1998, a game they narrowly lost 2-1 to a second-half Tom Boyd own goal.\n\nThis time around the venue is the Munich Football Arena (Allianz Arena) where Steve Clarke's kick-off the opening match of Euro 2024 against hosts Germany on June 14.\n\nThe Scots also face games against perennial qualifiers Switzerland in Cologne on June 19, with Hungary - who reached the knockouts in 2016 - awaiting in Stuttgart on June 23.\n\nIf Scotland finish as one of four best third-placed teams...\n\nOne of:\n\nSunday June 30 - Group B winners vs third-placed side from Group A/D/E/F (RheinEnergieStadion, Cologne)\n\nMonday July 1 - Group F winners vs third-placed side from Group A/B/C (Waldstadion, Frankfurt)\n\nTuesday July 2: Group E winners vs third-placed side Group A/B/C/D (Allianz Arena, Munich)\n\nQuarter-finals\n\nIf Scotland finish first in Group A and win round-of-16 game...\n\nFriday July 5 (MHPArena, Stuttgart)\n\nIf Scotland finish second in Group A and win round-of-16 game...\n\nSaturday July 6 (Merkur Spiel-Arena, Dusseldorf)\n\nIf Scotland finish as one of four best third-placed teams and win round-of-16 game...\n\nOne of:\n\nFriday July 5 (MHPArena, Stuttgart)\n\nFriday July 5 (Volksparkstadion, Hamburg)\n\nSaturday July 6 - (Olympiastadion, Berlin)\n\nSemi-finals\n\nIf Scotland finish first in Group A, win round-of-16 game and win quarter-final...\n\nTuesday July 9 - kick-off 8pm (Allianz Arena, Munich)\n\nIf England finish second in Group A, win round-of-16 game and win quarter-final...\n\nWednesday July 10 - kick-off 8pm (Westfalenstadion, Dortmund)\n\nIf Scotland finish as one of four best third-placed teams, win round-of-16 game and win quarter-final...\n\nOne of:\n\nTuesday July 9 - kick-off 8pm (Allianz Arena, Munich)\n\nWednesday July 10 - kick-off 8pm (Westfalenstadion, Dortmund)\n\nAnd finally, the final...\n\nSunday July 14 - kick-off 8pm (Olympiastadion, Berlin)\n\nGet Sky Sports on WhatsApp!\n\nYou can now start receiving messages and alerts for the latest breaking sports news, analysis, in-depth features and videos from our dedicated WhatsApp channel!"
