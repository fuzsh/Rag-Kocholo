        "text": "Unbeknownst to all eight clubs in the league at the time, the 1920-21 NAFBL season would be the last one on record - Brooklyn Robins finished 3rd on points (12) behind New York FC (17) and league winners Bethlehem Steel (23). It wasn’t the prize they were seeking, however, after going out in the semifinal of the 1919-20 National Challenge Cup to Fore River, Robins were seeking retribution. Especially so after seeing that Fore River lost in the final to Ben Millers 1-2. In the 1920-21 tournament, the Robins eleven would find their way past their opponents, round after round. On November 25th, it was a convincing win over Columbia Graphophone 3-0; they snuck past Erie AA in the 4th round after a replay. Robins ran into Fore River in the quarterfinals but exacted their revenge with a 3-0 thumping. Interestingly enough, they ran into their sister club Tebo Yacht Basin in the semifinals, but proved why they were the top club and won 3-0 again. On April 19th, 1921, Brooklyn Robins Dry Dock FC made it to the final of the National Challenge Cup to play the two-time winner of their own St. Louis Soccer League, Scullin Steel FC.\n\nThe USFA National Challenge Cup Final annually rotated to a new neutral site; in Pawtucket, Rhode Island in 1918, Fall River, Massachusetts in 1919, St. Louis, Missouri in 1920 and Robins would take on the Scullin Steel eleven in the “City of Hills and Mills,” in the southwestern part of Massachusetts. The Final had returned to Fall River and according to the match report from the 1921 Spalding’s Guide to Soccer, “It mattered not to the fans of this section that the Fall River Rovers were not battling on the field that day. Fall River Fans rallied to the support of the game.” With an attendance listed at 8,000 it's easy to assume at least a few hundred made it up from St. Louis or New York for the final, but that level of interest from the neutral fans shows an immense level of interest in professional soccer at the time.\n\n“Robins twice before had been a strong bidder for the highest honors soccer has to bestow in this country, but on both occasions had missed out when the achievement of their greatest ambition seemed imminent,” reports Spalding’s. It was even well-known at the time that Robins had been close contenders and those losses galvanized their sponsors, Todd Shipyards, to spend the money in order to win the prize. The money was well spent too, “Robins exercised the famous short passing style of play that is common to the team comprising kickers from across the water.” Scullin’s dependence on American grit and determination, the kick and run style of play, was no match for the fancy footwork and quick passing of Robins’ forward line.\n\nThe score-sheet from the match report shows the game might have been slightly more interesting to begin with however, Scullin scored first with a goal from Charles Bechtold in the 15th and Robins’ Jack McGuire answered immediately in the 16th to make it even. Scullin Steel went ahead again just minutes later when Bechtold scored his brace. Unfortunately for Scullin, it was at that point that Robins took control of the match and three more players contributed to the win; Robert Hosie in the 29th, Peter Sweeney in the 64th, and George McKelvey finished off the evening with a fourth goal for Robins Dry Dock in the 71st. “Much credit must be given the speedy forward line of the brilliant Robins eleven. Their pace was remarkable. Sweeney, Hosie, McGuire, Ratican, and McKelvey - perhaps no swifter combination has been known to the soccer world of the present day.”\n\nBy the Spring of 1921, the NAFBL was collapsing as the teams at the top were looking for something higher profile and the teams at the bottom couldn’t afford to keep going as they were. Todd completed the merger of Tebo Yacht Basin FC, Robins Dry Dock FC, and for what it's worth, probably Tietjen & Lang. Manager Drysdale was able to recruit William Whitehead, Adam Smith, James Campbell, and Bill Fryer into the new team and headed into their initial American Soccer League (ASL) season as favorites to make some noise. The ASL was a combination of the old NAFBL with teams from the Southern New England Soccer League and hopes were high. However, the league hit a few snags in the beginning, and despite throwing $6,000 ($79, 476.49 in today’s money) at their newly minted franchise, Jersey City Celtics folded. According to David Wangerin in Soccer in a Football World, “The remaining seven clubs lasted the season, but winter postponements and apathy toward meaningless end-of-season matches - particularly when visiting teams had little financial incentive to travel - meant some did not fulfill all their fixtures.”\n\nThe increased costs of competing in the expanded area of the ASL and the issue of dealing with incompetent fellow ownership groups became a burden on teams like Todds who, by all accounts were still well-funded. However, with the economic stresses of 1921-22 combined with the haphazard way the new league was run, Todd Shipyards would not return for another season. Which was a shame too, because despite all the ailments of the league, Todds, led by the “Mac Attack” of Frank McKenna, Jack McGuire, and George McKelvey were putting on lively displays of attacking prowess. After 24 games played in the league, Todd Shipyards finished 3rd behind Philadelphia FC and New York FC, but boasted a +19 goal difference and a return trip to the National Challenge Cup final - against none other than Scullin Steel FC.\n\nScullin Steel FC didn’t switch leagues; they weren’t bogged down with upgrading their facilities or spending funds on long-distance away days. By and large, Scullin Steel remained the same club that they were the year before and they leveled all competition on their way to the Cup Final in 1922; 2-0 over Johnston City, 3-0 over Ben Millers, 3-0 again beating Pullman FC, and thumping Caledonia FC 4-0 in the semifinal. Scullin hadn’t given up a goal in the entire competition. Todds’ path was a little rockier; 5-3 over NY Field Club, 4-1 over Philadelphia Field Club, cutting it close with a 1-0 victory against Harrison SC, and just getting past Abbot Worsted in their semifinal, 2-1. Todd Shipyards was clearly dealing with a bit of pressure to return to the final and juggle that with the inconsistencies of league play in the ASL.\n\nOn March 19, 1922 Scullin Steel FC met Todd Shipyards FC for a rematch of the previous year’s National Challenge Cup Final. Scullin had every reason to feel that they had this one in the bag and had done everything possible to get to High School Field in St. Louis, Missouri - in front of 9,000 spectators and in their very own backyard. According to the match report, “until fifteen minutes before game time the rain came down in torrents.” The pitch was a muddy disaster and for the first half an hour, the home team were anchored as Todd Shipyards came in with their tails up. Jack McGuire, with an assist from Ratican, scored the first goal of the contest in the 17th and just two minutes later, he doubled their scoreline. Scullin Steel were shocked it would take them until nearly the end of the half to get back in the match but once they did, they never looked back, “The youth and stamina of the Scullins started telling. And once the Eastern veterans started to tire, the Scullins were by far the better team. The forwards played as they should, while the halfbacks broke up the combination play of the drydock eleven.”\n\nMuch of the ASL’s reorganization was caused by the withdrawal of wealthy businessmen and corporate backing from the league. Almost all of the clubs operating in the ASL were teams formed by ethnic, religious, and civic organizations formed by immigrant communities. Metropolitan teams included the First Germans of Newark, Hispano and St. Mary’s Celtic of Brooklyn, Irish-American and Scots-American of Kearny, and German-American of Philadelphia. The New England Division included clubs such as Boston Celts, Portuguese S.C. of Providence, Lusitania Recreation of Cambridge, St. Michael’s of Fall River, Scandinavians and Swedish-Americans of Worcester, and Gremio-Lusitano of Ludlow.\n\nThe ethnic tensions of the sport came to a head based on the non-Anglo European group that likely was most fully integrated into whiteness at the time. German immigrants had migrated to the U.S. much earlier than those from most other countries. As such, the German community, even newer immigrants, were much more accepted by the dominant culture. But, world events radically changed that viewpoint.\n\nIn the late 1930s, authoritarianism and nationalism were radicalizing many parts of the world. Facism and nazism was on the march in Europe. It was inevitable that conflict would break out and that the U.S. would be pulled into it. In 1939, war officially broke out in Europe after Nazi Germany invaded Poland on September 1 and, while still not formally involved, the U.S. felt the pull. That year, the ASL’s new season was scheduled to start on September 10.\n\nThe prior year, the Metropolitan Division had added two new clubs - Deutscher S.C from Baltimore and Hungarian of Bethlehem - for the 1938-39 season. The former, an amateur team, renamed themselves Baltimore German S.C. after they joined the league.\n\nAfter the Nazis invaded Poland, the Baltimore Germans, quickly decided to officially change their name. On September 6, the club announce the name had been changed to Baltimore Americans. At the same time, Bethlehem Hungarians moved to Allentown, dropped their ethnic nickname, and simply became Allentown S.C. A week earlier, another league club, Trenton Highlanders, had been taken over by Dover F.C. and became Paterson-Dover S.C.\n\nThe September 6, 1939 edition of The Brooklyn Daily Eagle noted:\n\n“The changing of names has been urged with increasing pressure recently by those demanding the complete Americanization of the sport. While the players and the immediate management are in the vast majority Americans, the clubs were originally sponsored by and had affiliations with hyphenated fraternal and welfare societies.”\n\nThe initial wave over, the rest of the Metropolitan clubs, including Philadelphia Germans, held off on removing their ethnic nicknames through the next season. But, that soon changed. Prior to the 1941-42 season, Passon F.C. of Philadelphia (often called Passon Phillies) became the Philadelphia Nationals. In December of 1941, after the Attack on Pearl Harbor, the ASL initiated an official policy to Americanize club names. Scots-Americans changed their names to Kearny Americans and the Philadelphia Germans became Philadelphia Americans. Brooklyn Hispano simply became Brooklyn and the club’s long-time unofficial nickname, the Red Devils, was used more often.\n\nAnd what of the New England Division? Those clubs never had similar transformations or the chance to do so. After the U.S. entered World War II, most of the New England teams had difficulty fielding squads due to the war duties of the players. The league never completed the 1941-42 season and faded away.\n\nThe transformation was complete when the Irish-Americans became Kearny Celtics for the 1942-43 season. During the war, the ASL was a 10-team league and fully half of them had patriotic names with the Philadelphia Nationals joined by four clubs called the Americans: Baltimore; Kearny: New York; and Philadelphia. The trend did ease somewhat in the short-term. Brooklyn quickly returned to the Hispano nickname and the Kearny Americans soon became better known by their unofficial nickname, Kearny Scots.\n\nCultural commentators have noted that we are presently in a second Golden Age of Television. The combined quality, diversity and popularity of current television programming has resulted in an era where television, traditionally a formulaic medium, has replaced film as the prestige format for visual creators.\n\nOne important factor in that is the myriad of streaming services that emerged over the last decade. As diverse content was created, these platforms gave instant and far-reaching access to shows that may have simply had cult status in prior years.\n\nSome cultural critics have even begun predicting that this Golden Age may be rapidly ending as media companies begin rolling out their own streaming services. Many envision that this will lead to content again being more costly, and thus, harder to access. As the easy access to a massive amount of content disappears so will the Second Golden Age of Television as viewership declines and content providers no longer see worth investing in as much prestige programming.\n\nI have started wondering if we may be in a new Golden Age of U.S. Soccer. The original Golden Age took place in the 1920s when the U.S. joined the rest of the world as a soccer-playing nation and the fully-professional American Soccer League brought in huge crowds. For some time we have been living in the Modern Age of U.S. Soccer. The Modern Age is roughly understood to be from the 1994 World Cup, through the launching of MLS in 1996 to the present day.\n\nI suspect that the Modern Era is ending or, perhaps, has already ended. Things are vastly better now than 20 years ago at the national level. MLS is a stable Division I league and has the highest number clubs of any top-level league in the world. The league is popular and can charge expansion fees in the $150 million to $200 million range. Also, the U.S. Soccer Federation is in the last few years of a lucrative marketing deal that has paid the federation more than $300 million in less than 20 years.\n\nOn top of that, the game has exploded at the local, grassroots level. The youth game, huge even in the pre-Modern Era, has continued to expand. Even more than that, the number of elite amateur, semi-pro and pro teams is larger than it ever has been. The game is no longer played at a high level in just a concentrated number of pockets. You can find high-quality soccer clubs in all parts of the country now.\n\nIn addition, the investment in the game is no longer happening just at the national level. The number of clubs with excellent front offices continues to grow. Clubs are doing a better job investing in operations, media and outreach. We continue to see the creation of enthusiastic communities of fans.\n\nSo, is this a Second Golden Age of U.S. Soccer? Given all of the above it seems one could make a valid argument for such. But, an important factor is still lacking.\n\nA huge problem with the sport in this country is the continued attempt to shoehorn the game into the traditional U.S. league-franchise model. That has worked for the other major U.S. professional leagues (and their minor league affiliates), and may have been required to get MLS off the ground, but such a model will always hamper the sport of soccer.\n\nWith all the great strides being made, access to the game is still highly problematic. One of the vital aspects of soccer isn’t just the game itself, it is the interconnectivity of the sport. Soccer games, clubs, leagues and organizations are never isolated. They always operate within a larger system that spans levels, competitions and territorial boundaries. It is both an intra- and inter-organizational game. It is a local, regional, national and international game all at the same time.\n\nMLS, and its formulaic version of top-level soccer, can, and likely will, continue to operate on its current owner-operator league-franchise model. But, as it is a soccer league, it will then always be capped as to its quality and popularity because it is inherently disconnected from the greater game. No matter how financially successful it is, it will always be hamstrung because It is not fully connected to the soccer community.\n\nWhile MLS can survive, without that institution’s vast resources, the lower levels of soccer face even larger barriers due the lack of interconnectivity. Without the organization that is fundamental to the sport, the overall soccer environment in this country has been, and continues to be, chaotic. Without a community that provides stability and engenders innovation, many clubs struggle to find an audience or even adequate playing facilities. For the clubs who are doing well league hopping, or straight out poaching, is the norm as they outgrow their current situations. For fans, it is often hard to figure out the landscape at a grassroots level. Diehards will make great effort to seek out their local clubs but the average soccer fan will likely end up devoting their attention to a far away MLS, Liga MX or Premier League club because doing so simply makes more sense.\n\nEven more troubling is the very real concern that a healthy burgeoning soccer environment will end even before it has a chance to begin. If the soccer powers continue to restrict access to the few and refuse to open the doors to a broader coalition then most of the innovators at the grassroots level will find it impractical to continue (or even attempt to join) the game. And, if that happens, then the U.S. soccer community will have access to an even-more limited version of the game controlled by a few moguls.\n\nWe can not and should not consider this a Golden Age of U.S. Soccer until the sport is fully integrated with the greater soccer community.\n\n- Dan Creel\n\nReaders may have noticed that a recent lawsuit brought by the USL against the UPSL for breach of trademark brought many soccer commentators to bemoan the return of new “soccer wars”. Why would a beef between leagues result in such an immediate and specific response? The simple answer is that a turf battle between soccer organizations helped doom the Golden Age of U.S. soccer. And, it is not hyperbole to say that the implications of that original “soccer war” continues to resonate until today. Sadly, top-level soccer in the U.S. seems unable to break a regular cycle of internecine wars. In order to give some background, in this article of Kicking Back we present a survey-style history course on American “soccer wars”.\n\n1924-25: An Opening Skirmish\n\nFollowing the 1923-24 season, the American Soccer League was on the ascendent. The league was stable and pulling in a good deal of fans. The league’s owners decided it was time to grow the eight-team league. They added three new clubs in New England (Boston, New Bedford and Providence) and brought in Fleisher Yarn, a top-notch Philadelphia amateur club.\n\nThe added clubs meant more games and the league pushed the schedule from 28 to 44 games. League owners began negotiations with the U.S. Football Association concerning their clubs’ ability to play in the National Challenge Cup (now called the U.S. Open Cup). ASL owners claimed that the additional league games would make it difficult for the clubs to schedule National Challenge Cup games during the season. But, a more practical reason for the disagreement was that the USFA made most of its annual income from the cup by taking a relatively high percentage of the gate receipts. And, after the association took its cut, the pro clubs found it not worth the loss of money when playing in front of smaller audiences when they had to play smaller clubs in the early rounds.\n\nA month before the league season started the ASL voted to withdraw from the NCC. The country’s other major pro league, the four-team St. Louis Soccer League, also voted to withdraw. These moves led to Bethlehem’s local newspaper, The Globe, to announce “Looks Like A Soccer War” in its August 11, 1924 edition.\n\nThe leagues hoped to hold a replacement tournament but their different schedules made the idea impractical. Instead, the ASL held a league cup in the spring with the winner, Boston S.C., playing the American Pro Soccer Championship against the winners of the St. Louis league, the Ben Millers. Boston took the three-game series two games to one.\n\nThe USFA blinked first and, at their May 1925 annual meeting, they decided to lower their percentage of the NCC gate receipts by over half. This made the competition more palatable for the pro clubs and both pro leagues re-joined the cup in the next year.\n\n1928-29: The Soccer War\n\nEven though a truce was called after the 1924-25 season, the ASL and USFA continued sniping at each other as each regularly threatened to sever relations with the other. In the summer of 1928, the ASL voted Nat Agar as its delegate to the USFA’s annual meeting. Agar was empowered by the league to get the USFA to agree to keep the National Challenge Cup from disrupting the ASL schedule or the league would again withdraw its clubs. Agar, manager-owner of the Brooklyn Wanderers and long-time major domo of New York soccer, was a prime mover in pushing the ASL to flex its muscles. Another such owner was Charles Stoneham who owned baseball’s New York Giants as well as the ASL’s New York Nationals. Stoneham wanted the ASL to become the preeminent U.S. soccer organization. Stoneham’s Nationals won the 1928 NCC. After that victory, he pledged that his club would never play in another USFA tournament, and he called for other major league pro baseball owners to form or acquire ASL clubs to grow the league.\n\nStoneham’s biggest idea was a push to have the ASL’s champions to be named the champions of the East. In addition, he recommended that a new western league of baseball-owned clubs be created, whose champions would be named champions of the West. Under this plan, the eastern and western ASL champions would meet for the national soccer championship. At this point, the NCC was the preeminent soccer competition in the US and, via that tournament, the two finalists were considered the champions of the east and west with the winner considered the national champions. Stoneham’s proposal would shake up the power structure of U.S. soccer in a major way including greatly weakening the position of the USFA.\n\nAgar came back from the July USFA meeting without a compromise and, in mid-September 1928, two weeks into the ASL season, the league voted to withdraw from the NCC. While the league owners voted to withdraw from the cup, three clubs decided to reject the boycott. Bethlehem Steel F.C., New York Giants S.C. and Newark F.C. ignored the league edict and registered for the tournament. These clubs saw financial benefits from playing in the cup and also rejected the Stoneham plan, in part because the league he wanted to create was a closed franchise model that would cap the number of clubs allowed to take part in his proposed national championship.\n\nOn September 27, the ASL suspended the three clubs from the league and fined each $1,000 for entering the NCC. On October 2, the USFA suspended the league. The grandfather of all soccer wars had begun in earnest.\n\nOn October 8, the three former-ASL clubs and five other eastern clubs quickly formed a new professional soccer league, the Eastern Soccer League, with the sanction of the USFA. The ASL felt the effects almost immediately. Due to the suspension, the ASL was operating as an “outlaw league” outside the sanctioning of the USFA and FIFA. Any player who played in such a league could also find themselves banned from signing contracts with sanctioned leagues domestic as well as international. As such, many foreign players decided to leave their ASL clubs rather than risk such a ban.\n\nStoneham’s New York Nationals were the hardest hit. On October 12, ten Nationals players quit the team before a match against the Wanderers due to the USFA’s suspension of the ASL. Most of these were former SC Hakoah Vienna players who joined the league after that club’s 1926 tour of the U.S. The Nationals played an impromptu exhibition with the Wanderers but had to cancel their next two games while they signed new players. In addition, a month later, the club moved from the Polo Grounds to the much smaller Innisfail Park in the Bronx.\n\nWhile most of the non-ASL clubs were semi-pro outfits, one, the Hakoah All-Stars, was a new club made up primarily of the former ASL Hakoah Vienna players. The first game of the new ESL was held on October 13 between the New York Giants and Bethlehem Steel.\n\nThe ESL included several teams from the Southern New York State Football Association. The SNYSFA saw the ESL as an encroachment on its territory and the Association’s president, Dr. G.R. Manning, resigned in protest. Nat Agar ascended to the SNYSFA’s presidency and withdrew the organization from the USFA.\n\nThe two pro leagues battled for fans during the fall. On December 23, the clubs from the ASL and the SNYSFA formed the American Soccer Association with the intention to challenge the authority of the USFA. In the spring, following the ASL regular season, the ASA held a cup for all the clubs in the ASL and the SNYSFA. As a counter, the USFA formed a new New York State Football Association and all the ESL teams entered a cup competition of the newly organized NYSFA.\n\nBoth pro leagues completed their 1928-29 seasons and moved forward with 1929-30 seasons. The ASL launched relatively early in mid-August in hopes of getting ahead of their rival. But the soccer war and the late-summer recession severely strained the finances of all clubs involved. As the soccer season began, it became glaringly obvious something needed to be done and the parties began formal negotiations.\n\nOn October 22, most of the ASL clubs were reinstated by the USFA. While the ESL continued play, the ASL suspended operations as the parties worked toward forming a new league. Two days later, in the middle of these negotiations, the “Black Thursday” stock market crash signaled the beginning of the Great Depression. “Black Monday” struck on October 29 and the Atlantic Coast Soccer League officially formed in the immediate aftermath. The first games of the merged league were played on November 9.\n\n1932: Everyone for Themselves\n\nThe 1931 American Soccer League (the ACSL was reorganized and renamed in the summer of 1930) season was the last one that it could be recognized as a true, stable major professional league. At the end of the ASL spring 1931 season, Nat Agar’s Brooklyn Wanderers’ sat in second place behind the New York Giants. Agar protested the championship results due to the Giants having one more game scheduled than Brooklyn. The protest was disallowed. Agar hosted a friendly at Ebbets Field against Glasgow Celtic for the next weekend. The USFA suspended Agar due to some issue with this game and he was forced to sell his interests in the Wanderers.\n\nNumerous franchise moves and foldings over a short amount ended with most of the old guard of owners out of the league by late 1932. The loss of stable finances and leadership led to a chaotic situation for professional soccer. As touched on in an earlier Kicking Back, the remaining New York contingent of ASL clubs withdrew from the league before the spring season began in an attempt to form a new, but ultimately doomed, competitor to the league.\n\nAnd there were even more battles during that year. After the tumultuous spring season, the USFA began plans to take control of pro soccer in the U.S. by directly promoting and organizing regional leagues. The governing body relied on the National Challenge Cup for income but the funds received were not enough and it was looking to the pro game for new funding sources. The state associations balked at the notion of the USFA circumventing their jurisdictions with rumblings that clubs could leave the USFA and operate as independents. The ASL responded to the USFA’s plan by electing the still-suspended Nat Agar as their new president.\n\nRather than embark on another protracted battle, the two sides decided on peace. The USFA reinstated Agar and the ASL agreed to allow its teams to enter the NCC. A few weeks later, Agar settled with the newly-formed National Soccer League by reinstating the New York Americans and entering a second New York club into the ASL.\n\n1933: The End of the Golden Age\n\nWhile the USFA and the ASL had an agreement, this understanding was not welcome at the state level. ASL secretary Sam Fletcher, former Providence F.C. player and owner, moved to organize a separate New England Division of the ASL. He was unable to field enough New England teams, and the ASL moved forward with only its four-team Metropolitan Division for the spring 1933 season.\n\nDuring that summer, Fletcher met with strong opposition from the New England state associations who disapproved of the ASL’s move to form a separate pro league that would not allow its clubs to take part in non-USFA cup competitions. With the fall season still not settled and hoping to stave off the ASL’s influence, the state associations attempted to form their own professional league but were not able to come to an agreement. Included reorganized ASL franchises in Boston, Fall River and Pawtucket, Fletcher managed to form a nine-team New England Division in time to start the 1933 fall season.\n\nWith the New England Division finally a reality, the USFA and ASL had aggregated control of the professional game on the East Coast. One more step solidified that control. On October 16, 1933 Nat Agar retired as president of the ASL and the organization reorganized. The two divisions, Metropolitan and New England, would operate as separate leagues under the umbrella ASL organization which was controlled by a three-man board. Even though the two divisions were the competitive leagues, it was American Soccer League, Inc. that formally held the affiliation with the USFA and given the sole right of interstate professional competition.\n\nThe original Soccer War badly destabilized US soccer governance at the national and league level. In addition, the Great Depression massively impeded the financial capacity of soccer owners. These two factors led to the scope of the American Soccer League eroding through the early 1930s. And, as the reach of the ASL narrowed, any hopes of a national soccer system forming during the mid-20th century also expired in part due to the continuing power struggle and lack of cohesion between the USFA and the state associations.\n\n1966-67: The Silver Age\n\nWhile the rest of the world embraced the modern game, the lack of direction in the U.S. doomed the sport to decline and obscurity in all but a few pockets of the country. Two major factors changed that. First, the 1960s was a period of change and expansion in the North American major sports league landscape. During the decade the American Football League and American Basketball Association were formed as competitors to the established National Football League and National Basketball Association. Also, the National Hockey League began a rapid period of expansion. Second, within that context, the 1966 FIFA World Cup held in England ratcheted up interest in the game to a new level in large part because the event was broadcast live on color television for the first time.\n\nIn the spring before that World Cup, FIFA met in New York City. Three North American groups were represented with an interest in forming a major league. The World Cup, held in July, was a massive success.\n\nThat summer one group named themselves the North American Soccer League and planned to begin play in 1968. The other two groups merged to become the National Professional Soccer League. For the most part, the ownership of these new teams were made up primarily of groups who already owned teams in the other major league sports.\n\nIn August, the NASL received sanctioning from the U.S. Soccer Football Association. Merger talks occurred over the next month with the NASL planning to have all-star and European teams playing in each city in 1967 and a full league to start in 1968. The NPSL ruled out the merger, moved forward with plans for a 1967 season as a 12-team “outlaw league”, and landed a $1 million television deal with CBS.\n\nLater in 1966, FIFA attempted to mediate a merger between the newly-organized leagues but failed to come to an agreement. In late December, FIFA officially sanctioned the NASL as the only U.S. major soccer league. Football associations in various countries warned that their players would be suspended if they signed with the non-sanctioned NPSL.\n\nWanting to avoid a failure, in February 1967, FIFA stated that players who signed with the NPSL would not be banned for life. In addition the organization urged the USSFA to immediately sanction the NPSL. While most domestic clubs, FIFA and other European clubs wanted the merger, the major stumbling blocks were the NPSL’s low television contract and the NASL’s exclusive 10-year sanctioning.\n\nBecause of a lack of a true professional game in the U.S., both leagues needed to look abroad for players. The NPSL opened their season on April 16 with 10 teams made up of mostly foreign players. A month and a half later, the 12-team United Soccer Association (renamed from the NASL that March) opened their “mini-league” with full imported foreign teams playing under contract to the domestic clubs. Merger talks continued to be held during the season.\n\nThe USA ended their “mini-league” on July 14 when the Los Angeles Wolves (represented by the Wolverhampton Wanderers) defeated the Washington Whips (represented by Aberdeen F.C.) 6-5 on an own-goal in sudden death overtime to win the 1967 Final before 17,842 at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. The NPSL completed their season on September 9 when the Oakland Clippers won the second-leg of the final against the Baltimore Bays 4-1 before 9,037 at Oakland-Alameda Coliseum taking the championship with a 4-2 aggregate.\n\nA merger between the leagues was reported to be announced the day before the NPSL final. But, it never materialized when, the day after the final, the NPSL filed an $18 million trust suit in federal court against the USA, USSFA, FIFA and the Canadian Soccer Football Association alleging a conspiracy to drive it out of existence. The suit alleged the groups blacklisted foreign players who signed with the NPSL and that USSFA officials who approved the sanction were given jobs in the USA. The suit also sought to enjoin the USA from fielding teams until the NPSL was recognized.\n\nMerger talks continued between the leagues while the case moved forward. In mid-November a federal judge ordered organized soccer to show cause why it should not be ordered to end its boycott of the NPSL. With the lawsuit pending, the two leagues formally agreed to a merger on December 7 with the new league taking the USA’s old North American Soccer League moniker. The NPSL dropped its suit soon after.\n\nThe battle was a costly one for all involved. It was reported that none of the teams in either league made money. The Baltimore Bays, owned by the Baltimore Orioles, lost $400,000 and the NPSL’s Philadelphia Spartans, owned by the Rooney family, lost $500,000 and folded after the merger. The PIttsburgh Phantoms of the NPSL had the worst of it losing $900,000 and also folded.\n\nThe 1968 season was similar to the prior one. The league was popular enough to continue but attendance wasn’t large enough to offset the costs and clubs continued to lose money. The league imploded, dropping from 17 teams to five for the 1969 season. But a more conservative approach allowed it to survive through the early 1970s until renewed interest led to a period of rapid expansion in the latter part of that decade.\n\n2009-11: The Soccer Warz\n\nIn August 2009, Nike sold its interest in the United Soccer Leagues to NuRock Soccer Holdings instead of a conglomerate of USL First Division owners. These clubs plus a few others broke away from the USL, formed a new North American Soccer League and applied to the USSF for Division II sanctioning.\n\nThe USL issued press releases claiming the breakaway clubs may have been in breach of contract and the league could seek litigation to protect its interest. The USSF found that three of the breakaway NASL teams had binding contracts with the USL for 2010, but that left neither league with the minimum number of teams to be sanctioned for that season. In December the USSF stripped sanctioning from the USL First Division and refused to sanction the NASL for 2010. After weeks of negotiation, the USSF announced it would run an interim Division II league for the 2010 season made up of the 12 NASL and USL clubs.\n\nFollowing that 2010 season, the NASL formally admitted all the breakaway teams and, with enough members, was given provisional Division II sanctioning in November for the 2011 season. The USL ceded the Division II tier to the NASL and reorganized the remaining USL First and Second Division teams into the Division III USL Pro league for the 2011 season.\n\n2015-18: The End of the Modern Era\n\nA new order had been established but one that none involved appeared happy with. The truce between the parties always seemed temporary and the status quo quickly disintegrated.\n\nIn September 2015 the NASL accused US soccer of antitrust violations if the USSF went ahead with the adoption of a new set of criteria for professional league sanctioning. The league accused the federation of colluding with Major League Soccer to protect the Division I league’s monopoly. The USSF ignored the NASL and adopted its new Professional League Standards.\n\nOn February 10, 1941, indoor soccer made its debut in Madison Square Garden when the four New York clubs of the American Soccer League played a tournament. The first two games were played with 20-minute halves. The winners of the opening bouts played in the final that evening. That game had 15-minute halves.\n\nIn the first matches, Brooklyn Hispano defeated the New York Americans 3-1 and Brookhattan beat Brooklyn’s St. Mary’s Celtic 2-0. In the final, Brookhattan and Hispano battled to a 1-1 draw. Nearing midnight, a five-minute overtime was unable to break the tie.\n\nThe 10,000 fans in attendance were presented with a helping of soccer combined with hockey when the Brookhattan and Celtic match broke out to a scrum. Brookhattan’s goalkeeper, Johnny Bryndza, got the worst of it coming out of the tussle with a swollen eye and needing four stitches before he could resume the match.\n\nThe biggest culprit wasn’t the players but the playing surface. The matches were literally played on the terrazzo concrete surface of the Garden’s floor. Players were constantly slipping, sliding and falling. Fergus Hunter, the Celtics goalkeeper, broke a finger sliding for a ball and needed hospitalization for that and other arm injuries. Brookhattan’s center forward, Rudie Kunter, limped off after a bad kick to the leg and was out of the lineup for weeks. More seriously, Mike Briscoe, Brookhattan’s left halfback, needed to spend the night in hospital due to concussion sustained during a scrum.\n\nThese games were a real success and a double-header between ASL clubs was held the evening of May 6 at Madison Square Garden. Brooklyn Hispano took on St. Mary’s Celtic which was followed by the ASL champions, Scots-Americans of Kearny, N.J., meeting an all-star team made up of the New York Americans and Brookhattan clubs.\n\nThe clubs learned their lesson from the winter exhibition and installed a rolled dirt surface over the Garden’s hard flooring. In addition, padded walls were added for further protection. Competitive rule changes were also made. The penalty area and offsides were removed and unlimited substitutions were allowed.\n\nCeltic defeated Hispano 4-1 in a game marred by a three-minute fight. In the second match, the Brookhattan-New York Americans aggregation defeated the Scots-Americans 3-2. Around 9,000 were in attendance to watch the festivities.\n\nWhile smaller indoor soccer tournaments continued, big-time indoor soccer never took hold in the mid-twentieth century. But it wasn’t lack of interest that caused the downfall. Experiments to come up with a coating for the Madison Square Garden flooring were unsuccessful. And, plans were indefinitely put on hold because rubber matting was unobtainable due to war-time rationing. Without an answer, American Soccer League clubs were not willing to play on the hard surface because of the risk of injury.\n\nThe popularity of the indoor game wasn’t limited to New York. In spring of 1950, the amateur National Soccer League of Chicago held a 13-week indoor soccer season between the six top Chicago clubs. Three games were played each Sunday afternoon and were televised on channel 4 by WBKB, the local CBS affiliate.\n\nWhile other amateur leagues held indoor tournaments or leagues, the NSL’s competition was the most successful indoor soccer league at that point in the history of the game and regularly drew crowds in the 1,000 to 2,000 range. After the first couple of years, the number of clubs grew to over a dozen and the league was split into two divisions with promotion and relegation between them. Games continued to be broadcast Sundays on WGN-TV. The NSL’s indoor league lasted at least through the mid-1960s.\n\n9 November 1918\n\nAt Bethlehem Steel Field, Bethlehem Steel F.C. defeated New York Shipbuilding Corp. F.C. three goals to nil in the first round of the 1918-19 National Challenge Cup. Originally to be played during October, the game was delayed because of quarantines put in place due to the second wave of the deadly 1918 influenza pandemic.\n\nBased in Camden, New Jersey, New York Ship F.C. was one of a number of soccer clubs that was created in the U.S. by shipbuilding companies during wartime. The club played in the South New Jersey league during their brief existence and folded soon after the end of the war.\n\nOn the other hand, Bethlehem Steel was probably the greatest team of this period in U.S. soccer. The team was the the current national champions having won the 1917-18 National Challenge Cup, and had won three of four losing the other in the final. The club has also won four of the previous five American Cups.\n\nBut the 1918-19 season may have been the best of all. Their roster was littered with a veritable who’s who of players, including: full backs Jock Ferguson and Sam Fletcher; inside forward Fred Pepper; outside forward Tommy Fleming; and center forward Harry Ratican.\n\nIn April, the club went on to win the 1919 National Challenge Cup by defeating Paterson F.C. 2-0 in the final, and then the 1919 American Cup a week later over the same opponent and by the same score. Bethlehem Steel then took the “treble” in mid-May by clinching the National Association Football League professional championship.\n\n13 May 1934\n\nThe end of the initial season of the reorganized American Soccer League’s Metropolitan Division was only a couple of weeks away. The league was due to finish at the end of May only the top two clubs in running for the championship. At the end of April, the Irish-Americans of Kearny, New Jersey were well clear of second place New York Americans. But the New Yorkers had a number of games in hand while the Irish had basically finished their league season.\n\nWith the race all but over, the rest of the league played their final league games that day and the following Sundays of May. The Irish-Americans were in the middle of making a run at the New Jersey State Cup. They had won their semifinal the previous Sunday and the final against Caledonian F.C. of Paterson was scheduled for the following Sunday. During the break, they scheduled an exhibition on May 13 against the Scranton Miners at the latter’s home pitch.\n\nThe New York Americans needed to piece together a string of wins during May to win take the league championship. That day they defeated bottom-dwellers the German-Americans of Philadelphia 3-2. The next Sunday they defeated Brooklyn Hispano 3-0 at Commercial Field in Brooklyn while, on the same day, the Irish-Americans won the New Jersey State Cup by blanking the Caledonians 2-0. The New Yorkers’ victory meant that a final match on May 27 at home at Starlight Park against the Irish would decide the league. But the New York Americans’ momentum didn’t last and the Irish ultimately took the championship.\n\n13 February 1987\n\nThe Minnesota Strikers defeated the San Diego Sockers 3-2 in the middle of the 1987-88 Major Indoor Soccer League season. The teams were among a handful of clubs that had survived the collapse of the North American Soccer League in 1985 by moving to the indoor game. Indoor soccer was the most popular form of the game in the U.S. at this transitional time of the sport’s history.\n\nBoth clubs ended up winning their respective divisions, but while the Strikers lost in the divisional finals, the Sockers won the championship by defeating the Cleveland Force 4 games to none in the best-of-seven game series. The Sockers were the most dominant indoor team of the eighties and were in the middle of a staggering run of 10 championships in 11 seasons.\n\n5 March 2008\n\nIn their first game of group play in the Algarve Cup, the U.S. Women’s National Team defeated China 4-0 at Municipal Stadium in Albufeira, Portugal. The USWNT had won four of the past five invitational tournaments and had no trouble at that year’s group stage. Two days later they blanked Italy 2-0 then, on March 10, shut out Norway 4-0.\n\nThe final on March 12 was not as easy. Their opponent, Denmark, had also topped their group without conceding a goal. But, unlike the high-scoring Americans, the Danes had ground out three 1-0 victories against Germany, Denmark and Finland. The final was also a low-scoring affair with Abby Wambach breaking the 1-1 deadlock with a goal in the 50th minute. The U.S. held on to the 2-1 lead to take home their sixth Algarve Cup.\n\n- Dan Creel\n\nThe Wanderers began the year in a round-robin with other New York teams for a spot in the National Challenge Cup quarterfinals. But the club came bottom of the four teams and failed to advance. In fact, over its history, the Wanderers never had much success in the competition only making the Eastern Semifinals twice.\n\nThe first half of the 1931 American Soccer League season was a reversal of fortune as the Wanderers battled the New York Giants for the league lead. At the end of the half, the Wanderers finished second one game down to the Giants. But, the club lodged a protest with the ASL because the Giants had been scheduled to play one more game than the Wanderers.\n\nThe league did nothing. That disrespect seemed to be the last straw for Nat Agar and he disbanded the Brooklyn Wanderers before the beginning of the fall ASL season. Agar soon became president of the league. But a tradition had been created and the Brooklyn Wanderers name didn’t disappear for long.\n\nRebirth\n\nThe American Soccer League began to disintegrate in earnest at the beginning of the 1932 season. The seven-team league lost three New York teams on its opening weekend due to the financial difficulty of scheduling one New England game per road trip. The Hakoah club also wanted to withdraw but was prevented by the league. The four remaining teams played a truncated six-game round robin in the first half.\n\nBefore the fall season, the ASL attempted to plug their increasingly leaky dike by adding a few new clubs. To keep a foothold in the New York area, at the beginning of September, just a few short weeks before the season opener, the league granted P.J. Flannery a franchise for the Brooklyn territory. The new club named themselves the Brooklyn Wanderers and, as tradition would have it, shared Hawthorne Field as their home grounds with Hakoah F.C. Also, as tradition would have it, the club ended the fall yet again mid-table finishing fifth out of nine teams.\n\nThe first half of the 1933 American Soccer League season saw a complete separation between the New York and New England clubs. The Wanderers finished third out of four teams in a six game round robin season. Any pretense that the ASL was a major league had now disappeared.\n\nBefore the second half of the 1933 ASL season, the league went through a major reorganization. Nat Agar was removed as president and the league formally split into two separate organizations: the Metropolitan and New England Divisions. While still a professional league, this restructured ASL ran on a lower level in terms of both scope and finances.\n\nOnly three clubs remained in the New York-based Metropolitan Division: Brookhattan; New York Americans; and Brooklyn Wanderers. The Metropolitan Division returned to a more traditional late fall to late spring soccer schedule and, during the fall, began adding clubs to bolster their ranks ending up with a full complement of eight clubs by late December 1933.\n\nThe borough of Brooklyn had two teams in the league that fall: the Wanderers and the Celtics. Brooklyn Celtic F.C. was a newly organized club that, confusingly, had the same name as an older club that was competing in the amateur Metropolitan Soccer League. The ASL Celtics’ home ground was Commercial Field (now Hamilton Metz Field in the Wingate neighborhood) while the Wanderers continued to call Hawthorne Field home.\n\nThe league’s winter break started after matches scheduled for December 25. The Wanderers lost their game to the New York Americans 1-2 at Starlight Park and had compiled a record of four wins, two draws and six losses. Over the break, most ASL teams played their first round National Challenge Cup matches but the Wanderers were absent from the tournament.\n\nA Brief History of Jack Hynes\n\nJack Hynes played in the ASL for 23 seasons. Born in Scotland, his family moved to the United States when he was 13. He began playing professionally for Brooklyn St. Mary's Celtic in 1935 at the age of 15. In the 1938 National Challenge Cup (now the U.S. Open Cup) final, Brooklyn St. Mary's Celtic by Chicago Sparta 3-0 in Chicago with Hynes coming on late for Brooklyn when he was only 17.\n\nHe joined the US Army during World War II and was injured in the Battle of the Bulge in 1944. That injury left him with shrapnel in both legs and no feeling in his left calf. After leaving the military in 1946, he returned to playing soccer again.\n\nIn 1949, Jack was the key piece for the attack of the New York Americans. He led the team in goals and helped them advance to the ASL championship where they lost to the Philadelphia Nationals. Jack was also a pivotal part of the United States World Cup qualifications in 1949. The team was in group nine with Mexico and Cuba. Jack played the full ninety minutes in each of the four matches helping to advance to the 1950 World Cup, but was left off of the World Cup squad when he criticized the team selection for the qualification matches.\n\nHe continued to play in the ASL after his National Team fall out. In 1956 he received the ASL MVP award at the age of 36 while playing with Brooklyn Hakoah. In the fall of 1959, he joined Colombo as a player-coach.\n\nColombo: 1959-1960 Season\n\nColombo was a dominant team. In a league that contained US National Team greats like Benny McLaughlin, they finished the season after 18 games with 15 wins and a +45 goal difference. Their team contained Americans and international players from Europe and South America.\n\nAnthony Bonezzi was an Argentine midfielder that played for both the United States and Israel's national teams in 1961. Carlos Bustamente was a US striker that teamed with Bonezzi on Colombo, Brooklyn Italians, and Israeli teams. In 1959, just prior to joining Colombo, he was a part of the Montreal Canadian Alouettes FC which won Canada's title, the Carling's Red Cap Trophy. These players would go on to finish second and third in goals, with teammate Mario Zelaschi placing fourth. All three combined for 35 goals that season when the league average was 34.7 goals. Of the ten teams, those three players out scored eight of them.\n\nDuring this time, the ASL gave two points for a win and one for a tie. Colombo finished in first with 31 points and Ukrainian Nationals finished with 26 in under 20 matches.\n\nOther notable players:\n\nJoe Corbo (Germany)\n\nJohn Comazo (Italy)\n\nPeter Tagios\n\nLuiz Sansone (Argentina)\n\nManager: Peter Castelli\n\nOwner: Luigi DiFilippo\n\nFinal Standings G W T L GF GA PTS\n\nColombo 18 15 1 2 70 25 31\n\nUkrainian Nationals 16 12 2 2 49 21 26\n\nNew York Hakoah 16 7 4 5 31 22 18\n\nBrooklyn Italians 15 7 1 7 30 25 15\n\nBaltimore Pompeii 13 6 1 6 34 27 13\n\nFall River SC 13 5 3 5 26 27 13\n\nGalicia SC 16 4 5 7 32 40 13\n\nNewark Portuguese16 5 2 9 24 39 12\n\nFalcons SC 16 3 3 10 25 52 9\n\nUhrik Truckers 17 2 2 13 26 69 6\n\nASL Leading Scorers (Through March 20, 1960)\n\nM.

Jack Hynes retired at he end of the 1959-60 season and became a successful coach as he led Monsignor Farrell Lions to not lose a single match during the seasons from 1987-1994. Bonezzi and Bustamente went to play for Beitar Tel Aviv in Israel. They were banned after playing their first match due to Israel’s no foreign players rule but were later reinstated. In 1967, they were both in an accident which left Bustamante permanently injured and killed Bonezzi. Mr. DiFilippo continued his tailoring business in New York for the next 45 years.\n\n- Andy Rittenhouse\n\nOne of the great things about digging into the history of U.S. soccer is that there is so much there to uncover. Because it’s not a well-trodden path, hidden gems are always just waiting to be uncovered. But, if you do it for any amount of time, an underlying theme occurs over and over again no matter the era.\n\nU.S. soccer has seemingly never been able to build a stable and substantial club league system. Time and again soccer in this country has swung from a patchwork system of under-resourced grassroots organizations to a top-heavy setup where one big league controls the entire sphere of influence. Club league soccer in the U.S. has always historically been in a tenuous situation and it is easy to name all the leagues and clubs who failed from not building things the “right” way. But, we shouldn’t also assume that all these failures are based entirely on the incompetence of those league and club leaders because succeeding in an unsound system is sometimes next to impossible. The original United Soccer League is a textbook example of a league trying to find a better way but ultimately failing due to the circumstances they found themselves in. The outdoor professional game after the 1983 season was in dire straits. The North American Soccer League was down to nine teams; less than half of its size in 1980. And many of those teams were barely hanging on. The American Soccer League continued to be the only lower league.\n\nFormed in the early 1930s from the ashes of the first major U.S. pro soccer league, the ASL spent most of its history as a semi-pro regional league made up of ethnic clubs from the northeast. In the 1970s they followed the lead of the NASL and went through an era of rapid expansion and “Americanization” to, by 1976, become a national league with clubs spanning the country. But, for a league with severely limited resources, this over-expansion was unsupportable and, just a few years later, the league was back to being only made up of teams based in the eastern U.S.\n\nIn the winter after the 1983 season, the ASL was down to six active teams and one team, the Rochester Flash, planning on re-activating after spending the prior season inactive. Going into the January meetings in Atlanta, league officials, based on inertia if nothing else, planned to continue for another season in 1984. Early on at the meetings, the Pennsylvania Stoners decided to go “dormant” for the 1984 season with club president, Dr. Bill Burfeind, also resigning as league president.\n\nThings quickly went from bad to worse as a dispute over the league’s expansion franchise rights in Fort Lauderdale sparked a revolt. Ingo Krieg, owner of the Jackson Tea Men (who jumped to the ASL after the NASL’s 1982 season) and chairman of the league’s expansion committee, granted a local group, led by former Fort Lauderdale Striker, Ronnie Sharp, the Fort Lauderdale ASL franchise. But the rights to South Florida, belonged to the owner of the dormant New York United franchise and the dormant Miami Americans franchise, Jimmy Sorrentino.\n\nBy this point in time, the ASL was plagued not only by chronic underfunding, but also by a league structure that kept power in the hands of members who no longer had active teams in the league. The league had a mechanism that enabled clubs to go “dormant” but still allowed owners of those clubs full privileges like any active club. During the league meetings in January 1984, two active clubs went dormant: the Stoners; and the Oklahoma City Slickers. That brought the total number of dormant teams to 11 (including the technically still-dormant Flash) and only four active teams considering continuing for the 1984 season: the Tea Men; the Carolina Lightnin’; the Dallas Americans; and the ASL version of the Detroit Express.\n\nSeeing a broken situation, Krieg and the Bob Spears, owner of the Dallas Americans, took their clubs and established the United Soccer League over the weekend during the ASL meetings. Sonny Van Aarnem, the owner of the Express, and David Fraser, former owner of the Slickers, quickly joined the new league along with the new Fort Lauderdale Sun franchise owned by Sharp. The new league also hoped to add a franchise in El Paso and was in talks to convince the Tampa and Tulsa NASL franchises to join. All this left the ASL with one returning franchise (Carolina), one returning from dormancy (Rochester), and four expansion franchises (New York, Fort Lauderdale, Cleveland and Orlando).\n\nBy late February, with the writing on the wall, Bob Benson, owner of the Carolina Lightnin’, bowed out and new Charlotte-based club joined the USL. The Charlotte Gold had basically the same operations as the Lightnin’ but under different ownership. Similarly the USL’s Oklahoma City Stampede, owned by David Fraser, was in effect the old Slickers organization transferred to a new club. The Flash also soon fled the ASL for the new league along with three new franchises: the Buffalo Storm; the New York Nationals; and the Houston Dynamos. In April, the Express ultimately decided against joining the USL due to its being unsanctioned by the USSF, but the club never rejoined the ASL and quickly dissolved after not finding a home in an indoor league. The ASL, without any active teams, never launched their 1984 season and faded into history.\n\nThe USL began its inaugural 1984 season with nine teams in three divisions: Northern; Southern; and Western. The league’s philosophy was based on financial austerity and slow growth. While club budgets were higher than those in the ASL they were much lower than the NASL’s rampant spending. The season ran from mid-May to mid-August with teams playing a 24-game schedule. Playoffs were held at the end of August.\n\nThe league had a similar shootout and points system as the NASL. Although the Sun and the Stampede ended the season with similar 15-9 records, the Stampede edged out top honors with 127 points, 5 more than the Sun. But, the Stampede was knocked out of the playoffs in the semifinals by wild card winner Houston. On September 1, the Fort Lauderdale Sun took home the first USL championship by winning a shootout in the third game of the finals against Houston. When all was said and done, the first USL season was a success. With crowds in the low four figures, a modest success to be sure, but in 1984, any successful season for a professional outdoor soccer league was something to be proud of. All nine teams completed their full schedules and none of the franchises had folded before the league’s winter meetings.\n\nTwo big changes occurred after the season. In September, the Sun’s owner, Ronnie Sharp, was forced to sell the team to a group of local investors due to the consequences of his involvement in a drug smuggling operation. And, in December, Fraser moved the Oklahoma City club to Tulsa and renamed the team the Tulsa Tornadoes. But massive changes were soon to come.\n\nDuring February 1985, the USL and NASL held discussions of a possible merger. The NASL’s financial situation was desperate and only a handful of teams were interested in fielding an outdoor season in 1985. The USL was interested in the financial backing the NASL owners were able to offer. The merger talks ended unfulfilled and, in early March, the Buffalo, New York, and Rochester clubs had not met the USL’s financial requirements and dropped out of the league. Rochester went dormant yet again, but never returned. At the end of March, the NASL suspended operations. In quick succession, Jacksonville folded. Charlotte, who had been trying to join the NASL, also folded. And Houston withdrew from the USL and decided to play as an independent club in 1985.\n\nWith the addition of the expansion El Paso/Juarez Gamecocks, the USL was down to a four-team league. And with little time before the start of a new season, the league had to quickly come up with a new game plan. In a fascinating parallel to the 1969 NASL season (where the number of teams in the league had plummeted from 17 to 5), the USL decided to split the 1985 schedule into two parts. The first part was the exhibition USL Cup series where each team would play a home and home series against each other for a six-game series. The USL Cup series would from mid-May to late June. The second part was the regular season USL Championship which would start a week later. In the Championship, each team would play home and away twice for a 12-game regular season. Other reports had the clubs playing three additional games versus non-league teams that would count in the standings for a 15-game regular season. Playoffs were scheduled for the week of August 19 where the top two teams would meet in a best-of-three game series.\n\nThe rebranded South Florida Sun added an additional wrinkle called the Invitational Cup. This cup was a series of eight (later cut down to six) home exhibition games to be held on off dates during the USL Cup and championship series, against touring international teams and possibly the Toronto Blizzard and Minnesota Strikers; the two remaining inactive NASL teams. The known scheduled opponents at the beginning of the season included the Strikers, the U.S. Men’s National Team, the Bermuda Men’s National Team, and a team of Strikers All-Stars when the season started.\n\nPer usual, at the beginning of the year, the ASL clubs took part in the opening stages of the National Challenge Cup (now the U.S. Open Cup). In February, the league clubs met to settle pending issues for the 1932 season including a schedule opening on the first weekend of March. A few days before the season started, the four New York clubs (the Americans, Giants, Hakoah All-Stars and Newark Americans) announced that were refusing to take part in the opening weekend schedule and were in talks to create a new eight-team Metropolitan League. That weekend the New York teams don’t play their scheduled games and offer to withdraw from the ASL due to the financial inability to continue the schedule of playing one New England team per road trip (the clubs preferred to play two games on those road trips).\n\nA couple of days later, three of the teams officially withdrew from the ASL Hakoah’s offer to withdraw was refused and the ASL continued as a four-team league along with the Boston, New Bedford and Pawtucket team. The reduced six-game home and away spring schedule ran through April.\n\nThe New York clubs were unable to get their new league off the ground and filled their spring dates playing a variety of exhibition games. These included a Newark City club that either replaced the Newark Americans or was a reorganized version of the Newark Americans. Hakoah joined the exhibition schedule in May after requesting that the ASL not schedule any more games for them.\n\nThe fall season of the ASL began the weekend of September 17 with six total teams, the five teams from the spring season plus new clubs in Brooklyn and Fall River. As a side note, the New Bedford club at this point was Sam Mark’s franchise that was previously the Fall River club by way of the New York Yankees.\n\nAt the same time, the New York Americans and the New York Giants, along with the Queens-based Bohemian Americans, began playing exhibitions as warm-ups for the opening of the National Soccer League on October 2. The league was announced to have eight total members. Two games took place on the opening day of the NSL: the New York Americans and New York Nationals played to a 4:4 draw at Starlight Park; and the Bohemian Americans defeated the Newark Rangers at Clark’s Field in Newark.\n\nWho were these two new teams? And what happened to the Giants and Newark City clubs? To answer the first, on October 1, Charles Stoneham sold the Giants to D.W. Bremmer of the Indiana Flooring Company and the team was renamed the New York Nationals. Perhaps already the most confusing sports club naming history somehow got even more confusing! The Indiana Flooring F.C. joined the ASL in 1924 and was bought by Stoneham in 1927. Stoneham was the owner of the New York Giants baseball team but, because there was already a team with that name in the ASL, he renamed them the New York Nationals. In 1930, the Giants renamed themselves the New York S.C. so Stoneham renamed the Nationals the New York Giants. And, became the Nationals again the day before the NSL debuted.\n\nThe Newark Rangers are more of a mystery. It’s not know if they are a continuation of the Newark City club noted above that took part in exhibitions against the New York Americans and Hakoah clubs or a completely new club formed for the NSL.\n\nOther than those two games, no other NSL games were played on the opening day but news reports noted that four other teams from Brooklyn, Westchester and Astoria were supposed to enter the competition next when when the eight-team schedule was completed. But, the next Sunday, only one NSL game is reported to have been played: the Bohemian Americans and the New York Americans played to a 2:2 draw at Starlight Park.\n\nAnd, after only three games, the NSL was over. On October 12, the New York Americans and a new club, the New York Field Club, joined the ASL and the NSL folded. New York F.C. was made up of many of the players from the Giants/Nationals team. But the club was unable to play its first scheduled game that weekend because the owner was unable to sign the players in time for the match. The club began its season in earnest the following weekend. It is unknown what happened to the Newark Rangers club.\n\nThe addition of the two New York teams made the ASL an eight-team league. But, after only one game, Sam Mark’s New Bedford club folded. Two weeks later, the club was replaced by the Bohemian Queens franchise. The new Fall River club took the fall season championship.\n\nIn 1933, the ASL reorganized yet again by creating formal Metropolitan and New England Divisions with the New England teams seemingly not taking part in the league at all during the spring half. And with that, the fracturing of the first major U.S. soccer league into lesser regional semi-pro leagues was basically complete.\n\n- Dan Creel\n\nCover photo of Brookhattan FC, courtesy of the club.\n\nI’ve written before about the Fall River Marksmen and the old American Soccer League several times, but, for those unfamiliar, here’s the elevator pitch. The ASL was the dominant soccer league in the northeast United States from 1921 to the early 30’s. Clubs like Bethlehem Steel and Fall River dominated the league and the National Challenge Cup (eventually renamed the US Open Cup). The best players in the country played in this league. It outdrew baseball teams at the time. And then, it all ended.\n\nIn preparation for this column, I’ve been researching a player from that era. While I am not going to be talking too much about that process (there will be an article eventually), I do want to scrape the surface to make a point. Because Fall River Marksmen is such an interesting story to me, I decided to pick a player to research. As I dug into this player’s life, I realized how little is known about these players. They came and went from the soccer world. Like all professional players, they eventually retired and went on to live their lives, had families, got day jobs - they moved on.\n\nAnd the country moved on as well. Other sports began to dominate the conversation. The rise of the NFL, MLB, and the NBA relegated soccer to a marginalized space. Sure, people played the sport but it no longer dominated headlines. The names of players from the ASL era were almost completely forgotten. And sadly, USSF seems completely unconcerned about preserving this history. MLS has become the dominate brand of the sport and the only focus of those in power. Leagues that came before are almost entirely ignored, as if soccer began in this country in the mid 90s. In fact, American soccer might be the only major sport that refuses to celebrate its history in any meaningful way.\n\nThis indifference has meant that memorabilia, memories, the players are almost all gone. I can’t imagine how difficult it would be to be the dominant player of a generation and then to be forgotten for the rest of your life. We see athletes struggle with adjusting to regular life all the time, but this group of players has been almost entirely erased from soccer consciousness. The old black and white photos cry out for attention, but for many time has erased any memory of the players beyond box scores.\n\nI have been known to question the methods and style of Pro/Rel advocates online, but that group should be celebrated for its focus on the rich soccer history of this country. Focusing on that history is important, even vital, for the long-term success and sustainability of the game in this country. Pretending that MLS is something without precedent ignores the lessons that could be learned from the leagues that came before. The success of the NASL in the late 60s and early 70s dwarfs the crowds that MLS regularly draws now, even 25 years since founding. Go back and watch the videos of the Cosmos from that era, you see a league that captured the imagination of the country. This should be celebrated, not ignored. And, more importantly, lessons should be drawn to replicate that success.\n\nInitially, there were only four clubs, we know of, founded as early as 1892 and played a bit of a round robin for two years; however, the economic boom of the gilded age (1870s to end of the 1880s) came to a screeching stop just before 1894, in what is referred to as the “Panic of 1893.” These clubs didn’t stop playing soccer, it was just more intermittent for several years; they would have to find competition against teams of visiting sailors or travel by rail to play clubs some distance away. Shortly after an economic recovery, Vampire Association Football Club was formed in either 1896 or 1897—it very well could be 1896 and they simply didn’t play their first matches until the following year.\n\nUnlike some of the bigger clubs in San Francisco, Vampires were based out of Alameda, about a 45-minute drive from The City nowadays; however, the Bay Bridge wasn’t constructed until 1933 so in order to play away matches, they would have to take a ferry off the Alameda Mole to cross the bay. VAFC seem to initially have hosted their home matches at the Alameda Cricket Club grounds and a few of the cricketers played for the new football side. Other members of the Vampires team came from the San Francisco Yacht Club and most of the team were English expats. “… and they generally had money,” Brian Bunk tells us in his SoccerHistoryUSA podcast, “… this makes them a bit different than most of the soccer hotbeds in the United States, where the players tended to come from more blue-collared type occupations. The Vampires, on the other hand, were mostly white-collared workers; clerks, bankers, and accountants.”\n\nThey came from Yacht Clubs, Cricket Clubs, Athletic Clubs and the white-collared business professionals who brought with them the understanding of football, were privileged enough to have had access to some of the aforementioned Goth literary classics during their formative years. Vampire Association Football Club were established, perhaps, shortly after Bram Stoker’s seminal novel Dracula had been published in May of 1897. Rudyard Kipling’s Poem, The Vampire, was also released in 1897—which makes the year an oddly influential year for Gothic Horror and vampirism. Considering the players for Vampires, were clerks, bankers, accountants and independent business owners, it’s likely they ran in the same circles as landlords and property investors—those who would laughingly take ownership of the socially derogatory expression “Vampire” and use it as a mascot for a newly formed football side. There’s no way to know if this is true, but its as good a guess as any. There’s also the likelihood that they came to consensus, while inventing a name for their side, that Vampires just sounded good and scary.\n\nAccording to The History of Soccer in the San Francisco Bay Region website, maintained by David Litterer, “… soccer first made its appearance in Northern California in the late 19th Century; soon the California Football League, Western League and other circuits were founded, which eventually led to the formation of the California State Football Association in 1902.” Just two years later, the State FA would launch the State Cup as well as the Bellis Perpetual Trophy. Vampires were amongst the early powerhouses of these competitions, along with names like Union Works, Burns, and of course, they’re local rival, the Barbarians—who can boast having won the State Cup three times and the Bellis Trophy once. Litterer provides the lists of silverware in the Vampires’ case: State Cup in 1907, 10, 14 and the Bellis Trophy 1910 and 11… and looks like they did the triple in 1910."
