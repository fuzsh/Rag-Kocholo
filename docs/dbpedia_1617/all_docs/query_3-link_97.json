        "text": "It’s a good museum which relies on Titanic exhibition which is very good. Only downside for me was seeing signs which seemed to show there was an audio tour, but when I asked on way out about it, staff didn’t know anything about it.\n\nWe went for a Lego event which my son really enjoyed. I found the Titanic exhibition fascinating and very moving. Lots of interactivity and excellent labels. The history of Southampton was also great. We’ll almost certainly be back as your ticket gets your re-entry for a year\n\nThis was a nice day out after living in Southampton for 12 years. I’ve never actually visited so I thought it was about time I have to say was a bit bigger than I thought it was going to be. As for the Titanic side of things it was okay it’s difficult because you know you’re not gonna see too much from something that sank to the bottom of the ocean but I was partly expecting a little more. Overall, a good day out and kids would love it\n\nIt’ll give you chills. It’s a very interesting place. So many activities too for kids. Only thing we didn’t like is the hot drinks in the cafe. Ordered 4 and all of them were 3/10. The museum itself is 8.5/10\n\nIt was really a nice experience for me and my family. We could relate to some of the displays as we had watched the Titanic movie. The public needs to keep on offering condolences to southampton, especially for visitors/foreigners like us. It was really emotional."
