        "text": "#FirstSports: Rift Between Manchester United Players & Manager Erik Ten Hag | First Sports With Rupha Ramani All is not well with Manchester United, a club with a glorious history that is now struggling to game up. Man United‚Äôs slump is not just restricted to the field but has also stretched to the dressing room with reports of rift between the players and their manager Erik Ten Hag. --- Football | Manchester United | Erik Ten Hag | Jadon Sancho | Cristiano Ronaldo | EFL Cup | First Sports | Rupha Ramani | Firstpost | Sports News #football #manchesterunited #manutd #eriktenhag #firstsports #rupharamani #sportsnews #firstpost\n\n19/22 Predictions! A great win for Ireland last night, however I think if that game was replayed, it would probably go the other way. As expected their set piece came off second best, and untypical of South Africa, they failed to capitalise on their opportunities. However the stats suggest Ireland have the best defence in the World, and that clearly showed last night. I can't wait to see these teams play again and a South Africa Vs Ireland final doesn't seem that unlikely! Next up Scotland Vs Tonga. Seems like a pretty straight forward win for Scotland, and the bookmakers actually have the exact same win margin of 25 points. One interesting thing I have noticed from this game though is that I have only a 72.4% chance of Tonga actually scoring a try, while this may seem quite high, i can assure you it is not! If Scotland are to really set a mark on this competition, I would love to see them keep Tonga to 0!

Confident in being the next club granted approval to join, we strongly advocate for expanding the National Rugby League men's and women's competitions to 20 teams as soon as feasible. This expansion should ensure sustainability where clubs, players, and communities can prosper. We believe that the South Island of #NewZealand has all the inputs for early success, similar to what was seen with the Melbourne Storm. We believe Rugby league is the premier sport in Australasia, given its extensive reach across the entire Pacific. We acknowledge and respect the efforts of everyone involved in the bid application process, from #PNG to #WesternAustralia. As part of the #rugbyleague community, we aim to collectively strengthen and cement rugby league's position as the leading sport in the Southern Hemisphere. The below analysis was completed on Australian fans in 2021; we plan to share similar data on the New Zealand and Pacific markets in the coming weeks. #NRL\n\nRegional Rugby in Ireland works because historically Ireland has been devided regionally. In NZ they have also been historically regional, in Scotland the Highlands and Lowlands etc... In Wales we have always been tribal (one valley will never support another), and as a result regions have never worked. It could be argued we should have gone with the 9 club option. 3 clubs west, 3 east and 3 in the centre. Supporters would have come out of the woodwork to support their valley or city. Arguably the crowds are woeful because people do not identify with the regional sides. Grassroots rugby is also too far removed from the regions. Does someone in Pontypridd identify with Cardiff? Perhaps the WRU need to rethink rugby in Wales or it may continue to decline. üè¥Û†ÅßÛ†Å¢Û†Å∑Û†Å¨Û†Å≥Û†Åøüè¥Û†ÅßÛ†Å¢Û†Å∑Û†Å¨Û†Å≥Û†Åøüè¥Û†ÅßÛ†Å¢Û†Å∑Û†Å¨Û†Å≥Û†Åøüè¥Û†ÅßÛ†Å¢Û†Å∑Û†Å¨Û†Å≥Û†Åø\n\nWe had a lovely day yesterday at the 75th Steele Bodgers at Grange Road. EBCam were delighted to once again host at this wonderful event. We enjoyed a fantastic meal, followed by a great game of rugby. It was a beautiful, crisp autumnal day, the sun shone and as you can see from the photo we were all wrapped up with lots of layers. #ebcamemployeebenefits #ebcamfinancialplanning #employeebenefits #privateclient #independentfinancialadvice\n\nFootball Australia Explores Unprecedented Privatisation Plans Involving Matildas, Socceroos, and A-Leagues. Football Australia has ventured into uncharted territory by considering the sale of rights to the Matildas, Socceroos, and the A-Leagues for a whopping 99-year duration, marking a groundbreaking privatisation endeavour in Australian football. Under the plan, a new legal entity, referred to as a \"special entity\", would be created to manage and commercialize the rights of these teams and leagues. This move is seen as a significant step towards securing the financial future of football in Australia....

For me, it comes down to the fact that when compared to other high-profile sports, elite Rugby players play too much, get absolutely battered week-in week-out for quite frankly relatively pitiful remuneration. No matter how much tinkering is done with rules, governance, player vs country contracts, concussion protocols, etc. this lack of money going to its stars leaves the sport more vulnerable than ever for someone to come along with a big cheque and mix things up a bit. The inevitability of this is almost palpable but the nuanced cause and effect, fragmentation and revolution it may cause is up for debate. In the meantime, I'm looking forward to a nice day out on Saturday attending European Professional Club Rugby (EPCR)'s showcase Championship Cup, final Stade Toulousain Rugby v Leinster Rugby at Tottenham Hotspur Football Club, who knows I might have to go to #Riyadh to watch it next year! üòâ RugbyDAO World Rugby AYNE - are you not entertained? podcast Public Investment Fund (PIF)\n\nGoPNG should request the Australian Government to use the funds to finance and upgrade the semi professional Domestic Competition (Digicel Cup) into a fully integrated Professional Competition (Tier 1) like the NRL or Super League where the socio-economic benefits far outweigh the benefits to be gained from a PNG NRL Club in the Australian NRL Competition. Even the NRL doesn't see it as commercially viable for their expansion. The Hunters Pathway Program is a failed program so it should not be a basis to push for a License. NRL Bid is a political agenda and not commercially driven so its going to kill Rugby League in the Country. Going forward, you would hardly see local Digicel Cup players wearing the Kumuls jersey! Its a recipe for disaster! 'It is D-Day‚Äô: Peter V‚ÄôLandys prepared to walk away from PNG NRL expansion bid"
