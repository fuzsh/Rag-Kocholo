Well, almost anyway.\n\nReal Madrid and Chelsea announced on Wednesday evening that the Belgian goalkeeper will join Los Blancos on a six-year contract subject to a medical on Thursday, after which he will be presented at the Santiago Bernabeu.\n\nAt the same time, the clubs also confirmed that Mateo Kovacic will swap the Spanish capital for the English one on a season-long loan as soon as Courtois' deal was completed.\n\nThe London Evening Standard reported on Wednesday morning that the loan would include an option to buy, while reports coming out of Spain insisted that no such clause would be a part of the agreement.
