        "text": "Scotland was one of the earliest modern footballing nations, with Glasgow club Queen's Park early pioneers of the game throughout the UK. More clubs formed in Scotland, resulting in the commencement of the first major competition in 1873, the Scottish Cup, then the founding of the Scottish Football League in 1890. With the official sanctioning of professionalism, the Old Firm of Celtic and Rangers became dominant in Scotland, and remain so, although other clubs have enjoyed brief periods of success too.\n\nThe first officially recognized international football match took place between Scotland and England in 1872. Over time, Scotland began to play regularly against the other home nations too, and then on a yearly basis with the establishment of the British Home Championship in 1883. Scotland didn't compete against a nation from outside the British Isles until 1929 when they played Norway in Bergen, following which they began to contest regular friendly matches against other European sides. Scotland first competed in a major tournament when they qualified for the 1954 FIFA World Cup. They have qualified for a further seven World Cups since, although have exited at the group stage each time. Scotland have also qualified three times for the UEFA European Championships, in 1992, 1996 and the COVID-19 delayed 2020 tournament; failing to progress past the group stage each time.\n\nThe Scottish Football Association (SFA) were prominent in the administration of football since the early days of the game, and in 1882 agreed with the other home-nation associations on a uniform set of rules. They continue to play a role in this, with the SFA currently forming part of the International Football Association Board along with each of the other home-nation associations and four representatives from FIFA.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nThe game started to become popular in Scotland following the development in London in 1863 of the first ever rules of association football, established by The Football Association. Scottish football clubs started to be formed towards the end of the 1860s and 1870s,[1] notably Queen's Park who were early pioneers of the game throughout the UK.[2][3][4][5] The first officially recognised international football match took place in 1872 between Scotland and England at the West of Scotland Cricket Club's ground in Glasgow. The Scottish Football Association was formed in 1873, and the first official competition in Scotland commenced that same year, the Scottish Cup. The game in Scotland progressed further with the founding of the Scottish Football League in 1890, and the official sanctioning of professionalism in 1893.\n\nQueens Park's insistence on remaining amateur saw their early prominence in Scottish football fade, and the Old Firm of Celtic and Rangers became the dominant clubs. Celtic won six successive league titles during the first decade of the 20th century, during which time they also became the first club to win the league and Scottish Cup in the same season (the \"double\"). They also won four successive titles the following decade.[6] In the inter-war years, Rangers won 14 of the 20 league titles competed for,[6] and a few years after the end of the Second World War were the first club to win all three major domestic competitions in the same season in Scotland (the \"treble\"). Both Old Firm clubs have since won nine successive league titles; Celtic from 1966 to 1974 and then again from 2012 to 2020, and Rangers from 1989 to 1997. Rangers have won the league championship a total of 55 times, a joint world record.[7][8][9] Other clubs have enjoyed brief periods of success: Heart of Midlothian and Hibernian during the late 1940s and 1950s[10][11] and Aberdeen, and to a lesser extent Dundee United, in the early 1980s.[12]\n\nFollowing the first international in 1872 between Scotland and England, over the next 50 years the national side played exclusively against the other three Home Nations – England, Wales and Ireland.[13] The British Home Championship was established in 1883, making these games competitive. Scotland won the first ever championship, and won outright on ten occasions up to the First World War and shared the title on a further 6 times with at least one other team.[14] Scotland played their first match outside the British Isles in 1929, beating Norway 7–3 in Bergen. Scotland then contested regular friendly matches against European opposition and enjoyed wins against Germany and France before losing to the Austrian \"Wunderteam\" and Italy in 1931.[13]\n\nScotland took part in their first major international tournament when they qualified for the 1954 FIFA World Cup in Switzerland, and then again in 1958 for the World Cup in Sweden, failing to progress from the first round in both tournaments. After a barren spell in the 1960s, Scotland qualified for the 1974 FIFA World Cup in West Germany, where the team was unbeaten but failed to progress due to inferior goal difference. The national side also qualified for the 1978 FIFA World Cup in Argentina, amidst unprecedented publicity and optimism.[15] They failed to win either of their first two games, and a win over the Netherlands wasn't enough to prevent another first round exit.[15] The national side qualified for the next three World Cups in 1982, 1986 and 1990, but also exited at the first round in each. Scotland qualified for the finals of UEFA European Championship for the first time in 1992, and repeated the feat for the 1996 Euros in England. A further major tournament was reached when they took part in the 1998 FIFA World Cup in France, but then went over 20 years without qualifying for a major tournament. Scotland finally ended this barren run when they qualified for the COVID-19 delayed Euro 2020 tournament.\n\nThe Scottish Football Association (SFA) were prominent in the administration of football since the early days of the game. In 1882 they met up with other home-nation associations and agreed on a uniform set of rules for football. The home-nation associations went on to form the International Football Association Board (IFAB) to approve any changes to the rules. It was a proposal by the SFA that led to the offside rule being changed in 1925, where a player would now be onside if a minimum of two (instead of three) opposing players are between him and the goal line. IFAB continues to meet twice a year, once to decide on possible changes to the rules governing football and once to deliberate on its internal affairs. The organisation is now made up of representatives from the SFA, the other three home-nation associations, and the Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA). Each home-nation association has one vote and FIFA has four. IFAB deliberations must be approved by three-quarters of the vote, which translates to at least six votes. Thus, FIFA's approval is necessary for any IFAB decision, but FIFA alone cannot change the Laws of the Game – they need to be agreed by at least two of the home-nation members. As of 2016, all members must be present for a binding vote to proceed.[16]\n\nPre-1860\n\n[edit]\n\n1824\n\n[edit]\n\nThe first documented club in the world dedicated to football, Foot-Ball Club, is formed in Edinburgh.[17][18]\n\n1860s\n\n[edit]\n\n1867\n\n[edit]\n\nScotland's oldest club in continuous existence and longest established club Queen's Park is formed.[19]\n\nQueen's Park compile \"The Rules of the Field\", a set of rules based on the common Association rules of the time, but with notable changes to the offside rule.[2]\n\n1868\n\n[edit]\n\nQueen's Park play their first match against another club, the newly formed Glasgow-based team Thistle.[20]\n\n1870s\n\n[edit]\n\n1870\n\n[edit]\n\nThe first representative match is played between England and Scotland, although this is not considered to be an official international match.[21][22]\n\nIn the absence of an organising body for football in Scotland, Queen's Park join the English Football Association.[23]\n\n1872\n\n[edit]\n\nQueen's Park become the first ever Scottish football team to participate in official competition when they play in the 1871–72 FA Cup semi-final against Wanderers, the match ends goalless. Queen's, however, can not afford to extend their stay long enough for the tie to be replayed and are forced to withdraw.[24]\n\nRangers are formed in March. In May, Rangers play their first ever match, a friendly against Callander, drawing 0-0, played at Fleshers' Haugh (now known as Glasgow Green).[25]\n\nScotland and England draw 0–0, played at the West of Scotland Cricket Club. This is recognised by FIFA as the first official international match.[21]\n\n1873\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Scottish Football Association (SFA) is formed.[24]\n\nThe first Scottish Cup competition begins.[24]\n\n1874\n\n[edit]\n\nQueen's Park defeat Clydesdale 2–0 to win the inaugural Scottish Cup.[26]\n\n1876\n\n[edit]\n\nScotland defeat Wales 4–0 in the first international between the two countries.[27]\n\n1877\n\n[edit]\n\nVale of Leven win the Scottish Cup for the first time after beating Rangers 3–2 in a second replay – thereby becoming the first team other than Queen's Park to win the trophy.[26]\n\n1880s\n\n[edit]\n\n1881\n\n[edit]\n\nDr. John Smith becomes the first player to score a hat-trick in a Scottish Cup Final, netting all three of Queen's Park's goals in a 3–1 win over Dumbarton.[28] The final is a replay after the first match was won 2–1 by Queen's Park but declared void due to a protest from Dumbarton.[29]\n\nAndrew Watson wins his first cap for Scotland, becoming what is widely considered to be the world's first black person to play football at international level.[30][31][32]\n\nThe first known women's match to be played under football association rules takes place at Easter Road. A team representing Scotland beat England 3–0, with Lily St Clare becoming the first ever recorded female goalscorer.[33]\n\n1882\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Scottish Football Association, the Football Association (England), the Football Association of Wales and the Irish Football Association meet on 6 December and agree on one uniform set of rules for football. They also establish the International Football Association Board (IFAB) to approve changes to the rules (a task that they still perform to this day).[34][35]\n\n1883\n\n[edit]\n\nDumbarton win the Scottish Cup for the first time, defeating Vale of Leven 2–1 in the 1883 Scottish Cup Final.[26]\n\n1884\n\n[edit]\n\nThe British Home Championship (also known as the Home International Championship) becomes an annual competition contested between the UK's four national teams, Scotland, England, Wales and Ireland.[36] Scotland go on to win the first championship after winning all three of their matches.[37]\n\nScotland defeat Ireland 5–0 in Belfast in the first international between the two countries.[38]\n\nQueen's Park reach the 1884 FA Cup Final, but lose 2–1 against Blackburn Rovers.[39]\n\n1885\n\n[edit]\n\nRenton win the Scottish Cup for the first time, defeating Vale of Leven 3–1 in the 1885 Scottish Cup Final.[26]\n\nArbroath defeat Bon Accord 36–0 in the first round of the Scottish Cup, a record scoreline in a major competition in British football. Jock Petrie scores 13 goals in the game, the highest number of goals by a player in a single game in competitive British football.[40]\n\n1886\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Scottish Junior Football Association is formed. The term \"junior\" refers to the level of football played, not the age of the players.[41]\n\nThe first Scottish Junior Cup competition begins.[41]\n\n1887\n\n[edit]\n\nHibernian win the Scottish Cup for the first time, defeating Dumbarton 2–1 in the 1887 Scottish Cup Final.[26]\n\nThe SFA instructs all its member clubs to withdraw from the FA Cup and to cease any further participation in that competition.[23]\n\nFairfield Govan defeat Edinburgh Woodburn 3–1 in the first Scottish Junior Cup final.[41]\n\n1888\n\n[edit]\n\nRenton defeat West Bromwich Albion 4–1 in a challenge match between the holders of the FA Cup and Scottish Cup.
