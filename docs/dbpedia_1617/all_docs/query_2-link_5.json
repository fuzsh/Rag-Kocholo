        "text": "Sometimes browsing newspaper archives for one thing can lead you into a wholly unexpected direction of research when you stumble across something else by chance. While the stories of Andrew Watson and other non-white amateur footballers in 1870s Glasgow, and the Leith-born professional John Walker, are comparatively well-known, I think I am right in saying that the existence of two black players in 19th-century Scottish junior football has been lost to time, until now. The Romeos turned out to be a fascinating family for a number of reasons; hopefully there is more to discover about their early years, in football and in their wider lives. Here is what I have been able to discover so far. Please be aware, this article does include some racially offensive language from the original sources.\n\nThe autumn of 1907 saw a host of British newspapers reprint an article detailing the birth of “a genuine Black Irishman” in Dublin. The story concerned a baby born to inhabitants of the Somali Village that formed one of the “attractions” at that year’s Irish International Exhibition, but the barely-disguised mirth with which the press recounted the details spoke volumes about the supposedly amusing “Black Irishman” trope that recurs often in Anglo-American culture of the 19th and early 20th century. Fuelled by an ugly cocktail of: the now-discredited race science of the era; a hierarchy of racism in the United States that placed Irish Americans barely above African Americans; and bunk theories about Irish people descended from survivors of the Spanish Armada, its persistence can be seen in the inclusion of “black Irishman” characters in the highly popular minstrel shows that toured Victorian Britain. Suffice to say that the press would have been unlikely to hail a child born in similar circumstances at, say, one of London’s exhibitions as a “black Englishman” in the same manner.\n\nThe Scottish Referee of 12th November 1894 contained an earlier example of the same trope in action. The paper’s junior football correspondent, writing under the pen name “The Mite”, was reporting on a first round South-Side Junior Cup tie between two Glasgow teams, Benburb and Kelburn, played at Benburb Park in Oatlands. “Benburb maintained their good form”, he wrote of the home side’s 4-3 win, “and the inclusion of Romeo (a black Irishman) evidently tickled the supporters, with whom he seemed very popular”. The writer’s patronising tone is evident even from this brief description of the player; he – and, by implication, the crowd – clearly regards Romeo as a curiosity, as much a music hall act as a footballer, even as he describes Romeo’s “instrumentality” in Benburb taking an early two goal lead (he seems to have scored the second goal, although the reporting is a little vague). Perhaps the “black Irishman” label was born from an assumption about Romeo’s background, having heard that the young man came from the Garngad, a deprived industrial neighbourhood in the north-east of Glasgow that was home to a large community of Irish Catholic immigrants. In actual fact, while he did have Irish heritage on his mother’s side, his father’s origins were from somwhat further afield.\n\nThe story of the Romeos of Garngad, who would go on to become one of the most prominent families in this tight-knit working class community, begins with one John Romeo, who seems to have arrived in Glasgow as a young man of about 23, in around 1872; his name does not appear in the 1871 census, but he married a local woman, Catherine Gorman, in the city in January 1873. At this time, he was living on one of Glasgow’s oldest medieval streets, the Drygate, and his occupation was ‘copper works labourer’ – perhaps at the Tharsis Sulphur and Copper Works, in the Garngad? Little detail is known of John’s background, or what brought him to Scotland, although on the marriage register he gives his parents’ names as Anthony Romeo, a master tailor, and Grace, née Phillips. Later, on his only census entry in 1881, John’s birthplace is recorded as Tobago in the West Indies. We can infer from newspaper descriptions of his footballing sons that John was black, and may well have been descended from enslaved Africans. On account of their surname, and the dark-skinned appearance of later generations arising from their diluted black ancestry – it has been suggested that the Romeos may have had either Italian or Romani heritage, although this is speculative. Another possibilty is that it derives from a slave name given to an ancestor; these frequently had classical or Shakespearean allusions, cruelly mocking enslaved individuals by renaming them with ironic allusions to high European culture. What religion John was raised in is unknown. Catherine was from an Irish Catholic family, and their children would be raised in that faith, but the fact they had a Church of Scotland marriage suggests that John did not arrive in Scotland as a Catholic – perhaps casting further doubt on any perceived Italian connection. The young couple’s first child, a girl named Grace, was born within a year of the marriage, but sadly died before her first birthday. Another six children followed, but in the harsh environment of industrial Glasgow, two more died in childhood. The four who survived were Terence John (born 1875), James (1879), Rebecca (1882) and Rose Ann (1884).\n\nThe aforementioned 1881 census entry finds the Romeos establised in Garngad, living at 36 Villiers Street; John is still working as a labourer, and this hard, physical lifestyle would doubtless contribute to his own early passing. He died in 1887, suffering from bronchitis and dropsy, aged only 38. Garngad was a tough neighbourhood, prone to outbreaks of sectarian violence, and the sudden lack of a father’s influence may have led to the Romeo sons beginning to run wild in the area. In 1888, James was one a group of local 9-year-olds who appeared in the police court for breaking the windows of a nearby Methodist church, although the charge against him was not proven. Perhaps football proved to be a more constructive outlet for the boys’ energies. Exactly which of the pair – if not both – took up the game is not a simple matter to ascertain, given Victorian journalists penchant for referrring to working class footballers – of any race – merely by their surname; but their ages at the times that the name of Romeo appears in match reports allow us to make educated guesses. The first such reference occurs just a couple of weeks before the Benburb – Kelburn match, when the Referee reports that Romeo of Townhead Hibernians, a juvenile team, was expected to play against Benburb for St Mungo in a Scottish Junior Cup tie. It was a prestigious match in junior football’s premier competition, and the clash at Arrol Park in Springburn was reckoned to be the “big thing” in the city’s junior fixtures that week. The match finished as an exciting 2-2 draw, but Romeo isn’t mentioned in the subsequent report, so it is unknown whether he did actually feature; but the very fact he was considered demonstrates that he was already a player with a considerable local reputation. As Terry was then 19 and James only 15, it surely must have been the former who was thought capable of playing at such a level. The name of Townhead Hibs makes clear they were a team rooted in the local Catholic community; the player’s association with such a club would have no doubt provided further justification for the “black Irishman” label being lazily thrown around. Whether they saw him at first hand in this tie or not, Romeo’s name had now definitely come to the attention of the Benburb officials, leading to his subsequent appearance for them. This particular incarnation of the Bens – not directly related to the later Govan-based team of the same name, who would become somewhat associated with a Protestant Unionist identity – wore green and were referred to as “the Home Rulers” in the press. Indeed, the name of the club almost certainly derived from the 1646 Battle of Benburb in County Tyrone, an important event in the nationalist tradition. So young Romeo’s appearance for them would have further reinforced his “Irish” credentials.\n\nDespite causing a stir with his appearance for Benburb, it would appear Terry made no further headway in junior football – perhaps his colour contributed to him being seen as little more than a novelty. The next time the Romeo name appears in the press is August 1896, when the Daily Record reports on what it distastefully terms “the ‘Paddy’ riot” in Garngad. One of the area’s periodic outburts of sectarian conflict had been set off by an Orange walk, and an answering march the following day by a group of young Catholic men, who went around Garngad playing tin whistles and shouting anti-Orange slogans before throwing stones at the windows of several Orangemen’s homes. Amongst those convicted for their part in the disturbances was James Romeo (irrelevantly described as a “half-caste” by the Record). It would seem, however, that the younger brother was also making progress with his own football career. Amongst the team lineups carried by the Referee during the 1898-99 season, the name of Romeo – sometimes spelled as Roamio or even Romico – appears several times on the right wing for Townhead Primrose. Like the Hibs, Primrose were a juvenile team, so this is likely to have been 19-year-old James rather than Terry, who was by now 23. At the end of that season, a Romeo was also featuring in the Public Works’ Competition for the factory team of D.Y. Stewart & Co., a cast iron pipe manufacturer whose foundry was on Charles Street in Garngad, close to Villiers Street. In a mildly racist, but otherwise highly effusive, piece on Romeo following Stewarts’ 4-0 victory over Milton Iron Works in the final of the tournament at Saracen Park, the author of the Referee‘s front page column, “The Referee’s Note Book”, wrote:\n\n“One swallow does not make a summer, nor does one man make a team, but one individual star of magnetic radiance can blaze in a firmament of minor constellations, and so it was on Saturday. Romeo, a young lad despite his skin, for he is a coloured gent, was far and away the best man on the field, and his play won the match; and yet a more modest, quiet, retiring, and gentlemanly player does not exist, and proof was offered by the temptations put in his way after the match, yet meantime he has decided to abide as a junior.”\n\nThe Mite’s match report heaped further praise on Romeo, “a coloured youth, who will yet be a great footballer. He was far and away the pick of the field, and three of Milton’s men could not hold him, which testifies to his rare ability”. A week later, the “Note Book” column expressed satisfaction at the reaction to its praise of Romeo, once again confiding that the player was unwilling to turn senior despite being “much pestered… by agents”, this time going so far as to claim that “Romeo’s wooers are an East End of Glasgow and a Liverpool club, both in the first divisions of their respective Leagues”. With a little luck, might one of the brothers have gone on to be amongst the earliest black professional footballers, displaying his skills at either Celtic Park, Anfield or Goodison? Whether there was any truth in these rumours, or it was a case of journalistic exaggeration, there is no further word of a Romeo joining a senior club, indeed he was still turning out for Stewart’s in January 1900 when they fought out a three-times replayed tie against Rockbank in the North-Eastern Junior Cup, and when they faced Parkhead Athletic in the same competition a year later. Once again, the lack of any first name leaves us having to exercise our judgement as to which brother made such an impact in the D.Y Stewart team, given that it was not an age-restricted side. The 1901 census gives no solutions; by now head of the family, Terry had moved a short distance away to Gourlay Place off Garngad Hill, where all three of his surviving siblings were living with him and his wife Agnes. Both Terry and James give their occupations as ‘foundry labourer’, so there is every possibility that both worked for Stewarts. Given the apparent absence of the Romeo who turned out for Benburb from the juniors thereafter, it would make more sense for young James, fresh out of the juvenile ranks, to be the one causing such a stir five years later. On the other hand, when one tries to square the description of the “gentlemanly” Romeo with what is known of the two brothers lives, it fits rather more easily with Terry.\n\nOf the two brothers, Terry certainly appears to have led the more ‘respectable’ lifestyle. As the oldest son, and having lost his father when he was 14, he must have felt the responsibility to settle down and act as the head of the family after his marriage. Having already been a proxy parent to his siblings, he unofficially adopted his niece Catherine following the untimely death of her mother, his sister Rebecca, in 1906. During the First World War, Terry joined up with the Royal Irish Fusiliers – a nod to his maternal heritage – and saw active service in the Balkan campaign, being promoted to acting Corporal.\n\nJames, in contrast, had difficulty avoiding trouble on the Garngad streets, where tensions between the Catholic populace and the (mainly Protestant) police were never far from boiling over. In April 1903, he found himself in court for his part in another “riot”. A local man had been arrested for a breach of the peace, but the officers escorting him to the police station were set upon by a group of young men and forced to seek refuge inside a hardware shop. They were then pursued into the premises by the mob, a “band of roughs”, who were able to free the prisoner. Police reinforcements eventually rescued their colleagues, and the ringleaders of the riot were subsequently arrested, James amongst them. He was duly sentenced to sixty days’ imprisonment for his part in the trouble. Other brushes with the law were somewhat opportunistic: in September 1905, under the chortling headline “Robbed by Romeo”, the Record reported that “a coloured man, bearing the somewhat romantic name of James Romeo” had been given thirty days for stealing ten shillings from a drunk man lying in the street. Records from Perth Prison show that, by 1906, James had been imprisoned on ten occasions.\n\nAfter Terry’s return from the war, he and Agnes moved to 31 Turner Street. In 1926, Terry suffered a double tragedy, firstly with the death of Agnes in May; then, in November, James too passed away, suffering from pleurisy, aged ony 47. At the time of his death, James had once again been living in his older brother’s home, at Turner Street. Terry remarried soon afterwards, to Margaret Brady, who was thirty years his junior. Perhaps he was partly motivated by a desire for children of his own, his marriage to Agnes having been childless. In fact, he and Margaret went on to have nine children together, meaning the Romeo name would continue to be well known in the Garngad down through subsequent generations.\n\nDespite the brothers’ brushes with footballing fame, it was probably their sister Rose Ann who was the best known member of the family, and even after her marriage to James Monaghan in 1905 was univerally known in the area as Rosie Romeo. Indeed, although referred to in reports as a married woman, it was under her maiden name that she appeared in the news later that year, when she was caught up in yet another “riot”, requiring hospital treatment for a cut on her arm after being assaulted with a bottle. Rosie’s local celebrity was such that she mixed with some of the entertainment stars of the day, and Glasgow comedians Tommy Morgan and Jack Radcliffe made a point of inviting her to their shows in town. However, there was little glamour in day to day life in the Garngad, which continued to be plagued by violence. The interwar period was the era of No Mean City and the razor gangs in Glasgow, and it may be more than coincidence that one prominent local street gang in the Garngad bore the name of the ‘Romeo Boys’. Active from at least 1928, the gang can’t have involved the family directly – James was dead, Terry was settled down and over 50, and the next generation was yet to come along – but their reputation may well have inspired the choice of name. The moniker was quite long-lived by gang standards, appearing in the newspapers as late as 1947 – it’s possible some of Terry’s sons could even have been involved by that stage; the eldest, Terry junior, turned 17 that year.\n\nGlasgow’s formidable chief constable, Percy Sillitoe, made it his mission to smash the gangs by meeting force with superior force. Officers were encouraged to be “harder than the hard men”, and a sustained period of renewed violence in the area around Turner Street in 1933-34 coincided with the introduction of a new beat constable in the Garngad that personified Sillitoe’s approach, and who would become notorious. 23-year-old James Robertson, a burly ex-blacksmith from Fife, was confrontational, violent and a sectarian bigot; to local residents, he was known simply as ‘Hitler’. It is instructive to note that Robertson, far from restricting himself to gonig toe-to-toe with the younger and rowdier element of the populace, also gained a reputation for making inappopriate remarks and adopting an aggressive approach even to older and less obviously troublesome members of the community, such as Rosie Romeo, who was nearing 50 years of age. Police complaints records detail one example, when ‘Hitler’ was needlessly antagonistic in dispersing an inoffensive group of middle-aged locals – including Rosie and her future second husband, James McInally – as they got off a bus upon returning from a picnic. The increasing antipathy between constabulary and community reached boiling point in May 1934 when police aggression led by Robertson provoked yet another riot. This time, the conflict escalated into media controversy when several female witnesses, having the temerity to dispute the police version of events in the subsequent court cases, found themselves charged an ultimately imprisoned for perjury; an injustice that led to a vociferous public campaign to win their freedom.\n\nAmidst the poverty and violence, from 1920 onwards the Garngad had a more positive outlet for its young men’s energies with the foundation of something it had previously lacked – its own junior football club. Founded by a local priest, St Roch’s were an instant success and – only two years after their foundation – won the “double” of the Scottish Junior League title and the Scottish Junior Cup. The star of the team was a lad who would go on to join Celtic and bcome the greatest goalscorer in that club’s history, and indeed of British senior football – Jimmy McGrory. Himself born in the Garngad to Irish Catholic immigrants, McGrory came along at just the right time, when St Roch’s provided a supportive local environment in which to develop his talents at a relatively high level – something that hadn’t been available to earlier generations like the Romeo brothers, perhaps contributing to them drifting away from the game.\n\nRosie Romeo died in 1943, leaving Terry – despite being the oldest – as the last surviving of the siblings. He passed away in 1961, having lived to the age of 85. Today, many Romeo decendants still live in Glasgow, as well as in the Manchester area. By the time Terry died, on account of the notoriety gained from its violent reputation and the perjury scandal, the Garngad itself had been ‘rebranded’ by the authorities to become Royston, although the old name still lives on locally. While the area is much changed, and the streets and factories where the original Romeos lived and worked have been mostly swept away, St Roch’s F.C. survive as a reminder of earlier times, and today is very much a socially-conscious and community-focused institution. In recent years, the club’s ground has been renamed in honour of McGrory, and visitors there on matchdays will see prominence amongst the fans’ banners and flags given to messages welcoming the city’s latest generation of refugees and asylum seekers from around the world, a century and a half after John Romeo, the original “Black Irishman”, arrived in the Garngad and started a dynasty.\n\nYes, I’m still alive! I apologise to my loyal reader for the long gap since the last post on here. I did actually start writing this piece about 18 months ago, but got into a rut when it wouldn’t quite take the shape I wanted it to. I should really have moved on to something else, but I’d written enough of it that I wanted to eventually come back and finish it before moving on. Now that’s out of the way, there are a few more ideas in the pipeline…\n\nIt is Saturday 11th December 1937 at the Port of Liverpool, and the liner SS Themistocles of the Shaw, Savill & Albion Line is readying for departure to Tenerife, then Cape Town, and onwards to Australia. Already on board are two young men bound for the Cape, about to return home; but a dramatic intervention is set to change their plans. Racing towards Liverpool before the ship sails are Paddy Travers and Tom Colquhoun, manager and director of Clyde F.C. respectively, intent on one of Scottish football’s most dramatic and unusual signing bids. This is the story of how three South African players came to be in Scotland in search of a career, and the last gasp dockside intervention that kept one of them on these shores.\n\nTravers – who had joined Clyde only the previous month, after ending a 14-year stint as manager of Aberdeen – was by no means unfamiliar with either the qualities of South African footballers or the rigours of the sea voyage to their homeland. An innovative manager, his appreciation for wider horizons beyond the domestic scene had been fired by an early coaching stint in Norway. At Pittodrie, he recruited players from Ireland and the United States during the 1920s and took the team on several foreign tours, including three visits to South Africa. It was a country that obviously lent itself to Travers’ global recruitment strategy. South Africa had a working class football scene that was relatively well-established in comparison to those in the other white-dominated Dominions of the Empire, where the game was often marginalised in sporting culture and generally confined to recent immigrants. In South African society, cricket and rugby appealed to middle-class English speakers who clung to their British origins for social reasons, while the latter was also enthusiastically adopted by Boer farmers who enjoyed its rugged, combative play. This left a toehold for football, originally introduced by British soldiers, as a game that could attract a more working class, English-speaking element; for this reason, it became a more attractive source of overseas talent for the British game than the more overtly “foreign” countries in continental Europe and South America that had been quick to take up the sport with enthusiasm. It should also be noted that, whether through ideas of noble amateurism, as promoted by the gentlemen amateurs of the Corinthians – who had organised the first British football tour to the Cape in 1897 – or simply due to the game’s modest support base, South African footballers were unpaid, and the prospect of a professional career in Britain would have been highly attractive to the leading local players.\n\nTours had provided numerous cultural exchanges between Britain and South Africa ever since the Corinthians visit. The first FA touring XI followed in 1910. In the other direction, a team of black players from the Orange Free State toured Britain in 1899, albeit this was treated as an ‘exotic’ novelty in a time when black South Africans had not yet had much opportunity to take up the game seriously. The first visit by a team of white South Africans took place in 1924, and was the catalyst for British clubs taking an interest in recruiting players from South Africa. Liverpool were the pioneers in this regards, signing two members of the 1924 squad in Gordon Hodgson (who would go on to play for England) and Arthur Riley. Aberdeen became the first British professional club team to tour South Africa, visits in 1927 and 1931 alerting Travers to the potential talent source in the local scene. By the team his Dons visited for a third time in 1937, two South Africans (Billy Strauss and Herb Currer) were members of the touring party, while two more (Pat Kelly and Stan Williams) were signed up after being spotted during the tour. Amongst the fifteen matches played were two at Johannesburg: a 3-0 win against a Southern Transvaal team on 29th May, in which the name of O’Sullivan appears amongst the home team’s forward line, and a 4-2 defeat against a Transvaal select on 12th June, where one of the local side’s goals was a header scored by their powerful centre-forward, Milligan. These would also have been amongst the names stored away by Mr Travers for future reference.\n\nOn the 4th of October that year, the Dundee Evening Telegraph reported that three young footballers from South Africa had arrived in the city: 26-year old inside-right John O’Sullivan of Marist Brothers F.C., along with 23-year old centre-half Robert Styles and 20-year old centre-forward Dudley Milligan, both of Johannesburg club Rangers. Accompanying them was a canary, brought along by one of the players, and – more significantly – the man repsonsible for arranging their visit, James Elder of Johannesburg. A retired engineer, Mr Elder had spent forty years working in Rhodesia and South Africa, but was originally from Dundee. According to the Telegraph report, he had heard the players were interested in trying for a career in Scottish football and had stepped in to sponsor their trip, choosing his home city because of his contacts there and his enduring fondness for Dundee F.C. Sailing from Cape Town on the Dunbar Castle, the party had docked at Southampton on the Saturday, and had reached London later that day in time to watch the First Division match between Arsenal and Manchester City at Highbury before travelling on to Dundee by train. Arriving on the Sunday, the players would have stopped off at their lodgings, the home of one William Elder – doubtless a relative of their sponsor – at 19 St Matthew Street, before going to meet Dundee manager Andy Cunningham at Dens. With Monday being a public holiday in the city, the trio were back at the ground the following afternoon to see Dundee take on Third Lanark in a league match, and reportedly enjoyed watching the Dark Blues’ 2-1 win. They would then began training with the team on the Tuesday, the intention being that they would spend a few weeks getting match fit and settling in to Scottish conditions before potentially playing in some trial matches. Other clubs were taking note of the players too; during the match, the trio were introduced to Paddy Travers – who was of course already familiar with them from the Dons’ tour, and was at this time reported to be interested in O’Sullivan – and to the Arbroath manager Bob McGlashan, who invited them to watch the match against Celtic at Gayfield on the following Saturday. It was also suggested in the Dundee papers that Arsenal had expressed an interest in Milligan during the players’ London sojourn – although this may just have been Elder’s way of drumming up further interest in his charges.\n\nThe party accepted McGlashan’s invitation, and Milligan and O’Sullivan were at Gayfield to see Arbroath record a memorable 2-0 victory – their first ever (and still, only) competitive win against Celtic. Also amongst the 9500 crowd that day were three Yorkshire cricketers holidaying in the area, including England Test batsman Maurice Leyland. One sportsman not present was Robert Styles, who was instead turning out for Dundee ‘A’ in their Scottish Alliance fixture against Rangers ‘A’ at Dens. Dundee had fielded Hugh O’Neill, of Fife junior club Blairhall Colliery, as a trialist at centre-half in their previous Alliance fixture, and had intended to do so again – but he declined to play once it became apparent that Celtic were moving to sign him. Despite the original plan that the South Africans would have a longer acclimatisation period before taking part in any matches, Styles was then thrown in at short notice after just a few days training. He made a good impression in Dundee’s 2-1 win; unsurprisingly, he faded later in the game after a fine start, but “did fairly well for a fellow not quite at concert pitch”, as the Courier put it. The following week, on Saturday 16th, he again featured for the Alliance team, as did Milligan; both performed well, but this time the Dundee reserves went down 3-0 to Hearts ‘A’ at Tynecastle. For some reason, the two trialists appeared as “Wilson” and “Jackson” on the team lines. On the same day, O’Sullivan was also in Alliance action, for Clyde ‘A’, and impressed as they trounced Third Lanark ‘A’ 6-1 at Shawfield.\n\nBy now, the performances of the three players in their appearances so far had heightened the level of interest from other clubs in their services. For his part, however, Andy Cunningham had cooled on two of them, and wanted to give further consideration only to Milligan. The Courier‘s Don John advised readers that the three players would likely decide to leave Dundee as they wanted to stick together. It was reported that Hearts were now showing an interest in Milligan, but it was Clyde that were willing to look at all three together. On Saturday 23rd the trio turned out for Clyde ‘A’ in their 3-1 defeat against Hearts ‘A’ at Shawfield, Milligan scoring the Bully Wee’s only goal. At the same time, Clyde’s first team were playing out a goalless draw against Hearts at Tynecastle that kept them rooted to the bottom of the First Division table with only one win from their fourteen games. After the match, it emerged that club manager Russell Moreland had decided to resign. Employed in more of an old-fashioned administrative role, Moreland’s request to be allowed to take charge of team selection had been refused by the directors, so he was quitting to concentrate on his Glasgow sports shop business instead. Almost immediately, Paddy Travers – a former Clyde player – was being linked with the job, although chairman John McMahon was quick to deny the club had settled on any particular candidate. The board met to deliberate on the matter later that week, but still no decision was taken.\n\nIf the uncertainty at Shawfield was having an effect on the South Africans’ career prospects, that was nothing to developments back in Dundee. On Wednesday 27th came the shock news that Dudley Milligan had been operated on in the city’s Royal Infirmary after contracting appendicitis, casting doubt on the trio’s plans. Although the operation went well, a specialist reckoned he would need three months break from football, and may have to celebrate his 21st birthday the folowing month in hospital. That same week, it was also reported that the South African Football Asssociation, clearly concerned by the number of their players heading for the English and Scottish leagues, would be meeting to consider a ban on such transfers, excepting where the players were British-born.\n\nWith their intention to remain as a trio scuppered, Styles and O’Sullivan moved on to England during Milligan’s convalescense. Whether they had trials with any further clubs is unclear, but they apparently spent time in London and then Liverpool, where they were joined in December by Milligan after his discharge from the infirmary. At this time, Milligan was the subject of an approach from Leicester City, which he turned down; presumably as a result of his medical issues, he had already set his mind on returning home, and passage was booked on the Themistocles. But he hadn’t reckoned on the determination of Paddy Travers. News of his widely-expected departure from Aberdeen had broken on 6th November, and after his subsequent appointment by Clyde he officially took over as manager at Shawfield on the 23rd. Despite an upturn in form, he was still as keen as ever to scour the globe for new talent, with one of his first acts being to invite New York-based player William McInnes for a trial. But he had evidently decided that Milligan’s rumbustious play was just what he needed to get his new team up the league table. And so came that dramatic dash to the Liverpool dockside, the tempting offer of a susbtantial signing-on fee, and the last-minute decision to “abandon ship” and return to Scotland. The surviving passenger list serves to dramatically illustrate the event: the name of James Elder remains in the list of those embarking on the voyage; those of Milligan and Styles have been crossed out.\n\nIn the end, neither Styles or O’Sullivan found any compelling reason to stay on. Those two evcentually left the country on 4th February 1938, sailing from Southampton to Cape Town on the Edinburgh Castle. Shortly after arriving home, Robert Styles gave an interview to The Star, a Johannesburg newspaper, sharing an insight into his experience – an early appearance by the trope of the foreign player airing his negative experiences to the media in their home country, then the story finding its way back to the British press. The interview was soon syndicated to UK papers, appearing under headlines such as “Not All Glamour in Professional Football” (in the Birmingham Evening Despatch, May 1938). Styles expands at some length on his disillusionment with what he encountered during his time in Scotland. He talks of the precarious nature of players’ careers, the paltry remuneration (unless boosted by a substantial signing-on fee, which happened rarely), and the lack of time given over to training; meaning that even professionals found it necessary to combine their football with other work or study, so as to support themselves in later life. He reveals that while on Merseyside he spoke with his compatriot, Arthur Riley. Although he had by then been with Liverpool for thirteen years, Riley apparently gave several reasons he regretted becoming a professional, and had advised Styles, “don’t take the plunge”. He felt that the supposed glamour of the sport often blinded individuals to the harsh realities. Despite all this, Styles says he would still have taken his chances had he received a signing-on offer he felt was worth the risk; this explains his decision to disembark along with Milligan when the latter received just such an incentive from the Clyde representatives. Perhaps there were hints that the club may make a similar offer to Styles, or else there were whispers another Scottish club might? The player gave a Glasgow address as his last UK residence on the Edinburgh Castle passenger list, suggesting he must have gone back north with Milligan. If any such offer was forthcoming, it wasn’t enough to tempt Styles.\n\nThe impression painted of John O’Sullivan by Styles suggests the oldest of the three – “much wiser than I” – was perhaps a little less idealistic and naive than the others were at the outset. Whereas Styles and Milliigan were very much open to the idea of a career in the game, it seems O’Sullivan was just out for an adventure and to satisfy his curiousity about the life of a professional, and simply laughed off various approaches from scouts. Given that his last address on departure was given as Liverpool, it would appear he didn’t bother to follow the others back to Scotland and treated the rest of the trip as a holiday. In the end, and despite their contrasting perspectives, both seemed equally happy to return to the amateur ranks in South Africa after their taste of the professional life.\n\nDudley Milligan went on to have a frutiful career in the “Mother Country”. Fully recovered from his illness, he finally made his Scottish League bow on 3rd January 1938. Playing at inside-right, it was a scoring debut as Clyde and Third Lanark served up a thrilling 3-3 draw at Shawfield. His time with Clyde was short, and after scoring nine goals in only ten league appearances he joined Chesterfield in November, the English Second Division club paying “a substantial fee” for his services. His physical approach, honed by experience of playing rugby in his youth back in South Africa, was a huge success at Saltergate, and it brought him to the attention of the Irish FA selectors. Milligan’s parents were Irish, which was enough to qualify him for international recognition, and on 15th March 1939 he played and scored in Ireland’s 3-1 Home Championship defeat against Wales at Wrexham. Unfortunately, the outbreak of war later that year meant that he would have no further opportunity to add to his caps, but he did go on to play club football in Ireland while working as a welder in Belfast during the war years, with colourful spells filled with goals and controversy guesting for Linfield, Larne, Distillery and Dundalk, before resuming his Chesterfield career postwar. He also turned out for Walsall and Bournemouth & Boscombe Athletic before ending his career in the Irish League with Ballymena United in 1949. He subsequently returned home to South Africa in 1952, and died in Johannesburg in 1970 at the age of 54.\n\nAlthough Milligan’s time at Clyde was brief, he successfully helped Travers’ team climb out of relegation trouble, finishing fifteenth out of twenty at the end of the 1937-38 season. His departure midway through the following campaign meant he missed Clyde’s run to the 1939 Scottish Cup final. Scoring the opening goal as they beat Motherwell at Hampden to lift the trophy was another South African forward signed by Paddy Travers shortly after Milligan, Dougie Wallace. Two years earlier, he had lined up alongside Milligan in the Transvaal team that had defeated Travers’ Aberdeen. Wallace’s Scottish-born son Gordon also became a footballer and, appropriately enough, played for the club in England that had started the South African trend – Liverpool. As for Paddy Travers, he went on to serve Clyde as manager for eighteen years, and continued to look to South Africa as a source of talent, with Clyde teams in the early postwar years featuring the likes of Roy Davies, Alf Ackerman and Ken Hewkins. The latter was in goal when Travers led Clyde to a second Scottish Cup triumph in 1955, setting the seal on two decades of South African imports by Travers that mostly managed to find a hint of the glamour that professional football in Scotland could – just occasionally – offer.\n\nThis piece has its origins in the Wikipedia article on the Kinning Park ground, which I have no compunction about repurposing here as I wrote it in the first place! Never having staged league football or first-class cricket, it had somewhat fallen through the cracks in terms of recognition, hence it taking until 2020 before anyone thought to put it on Wikipedia at all, but it was a genuinely significant venue in its day, and my initial intention to write a brief snub snowballed into something much longer…\n\nTravelling along the M8 motorway west of central Glasgow today, looking down on the modern industrial units (and occasional sandstone survivor) around Scotland Street West, it’s difficult to picture this area as it once was – a place of fields and streams, a semi-rural idyll favoured for recreation by the city’s sporting youth. But here, somewhere below the eastbound carriageway was the site of one of the leading sports venues around Victorian Glasgow. Its story is one of the growing industrial city, and the inevitable encroachment of the modern metropolis on the once-peaceful countryside a historic cricket field.\n\nBut even as early as 1893, that earlier world was already lost. The Scottish Referee‘s cricket correspondent, “Mid-On”, in a piece for their “Cricket Notes” column titled “Something for the “old boys”” clearly sets out his stall with an appeal to nostalgia. The writer goes on to vividly describe his memories of Kinning Park as it was thirty years before, a time when there was not only the expanse of the Clydesdale cricket ground but also other fields used by minor cricket clubs to the east and even an archery ground to the north.\n\nKinning Park in the mid-19th century was barely a settlement at all, just an obscure locality on the road from Glasgow to Govan and Paisley, situated in a narrow sliver of Govan parish belonging to Renfrewshire as it reached down to the Clyde. It was part to the Pollok Estate, and decidedly rural in character, even though nearby Tradeston had been laid out and built up as an expansion of the city in the 1790s. The landowner, Maxwell of Pollok, had vague plans at this time for a prestigious development of villas for the middle classes based on Regent’s Park in London, but nothing came of this scheme.\n\nThe Clydesdale Cricket Club was formed in 1848 and started out on a field at Kinning Park rented from a Mr Tweedie, whose stated occupation of “cow feeder” certainly evokes a bucolic atmosphere. Unfortunately, Mr Tweedie was not impressed by the damage to his grass – the cow’s presumably took a similarly dim view – and so for the 1849 season they decamped about 500 yards to the west, where they rented a new field from the similarly rustic-sounding Mr Meiklewham, roughly on the corner of West Scotland Street and Lambhill Street.\n\nClydesdale opened this new ground on 30th June 1849, with a match against Barrhead. Within a couple of years, the young club would be attracting far more prestigious opposition. A three-day match beginning on 18th September 1851, described by the Glasgow Herald as “the great cricket match… which is exciting such an intense curiosity all over Scotland”, was billed by that newspaper as Scotland v England. More accurately, it was a Glasgow Select – effectively, Clydesdale augmented by a few English professionals – against the All England XI, one of the touring teams that were the biggest draws in an era before county or Test cricket. This team boasted stars such as Alfred Mynn and Fuller Pilch, as well as John Wisden of Almanack fame. As was usual in such matches, the visiting eleven would play an “odds match” against a local twenty-two, to ensure a more even contest. A large crowd was clearly anticipated, with a grandstand and stalls erected, and the printing tent of London-based cricketing entrepreneur Fred Lilywhite on hand to provide scorecards. The occasion was a great success, with around eight thousand spectators no doubt delighted by Glasgow’s 33-run victory – despite the sterling efforts of Wisden, who took twenty wickets.\n\nGames of this sort took place with regularity at Kinning Park over the next fifteen years, with teams variously billed as Clydesdale, Glasgow or Scotland taking on glamorous touring teams, with the All England XI being joined on the fixture lists by the United England, United Ireland and United South of England XI’s (all of these also being odds matches, so none of the cricket staged at Kinning Park is categorised as first-class). This was the era that Mid-On was looking back wistfully on: his prose mixes comforting nostalgia (“the summer days were summer days in those days”) with regret that the popular game of his youth has been supplanted (“Thirty years ago, cricket was, and not football”) and pointed detail implying his disapproval of the upstart sport and its drive towards professionalism (“What about gates? There was no thought of money-making in the days I speak of”). As he attempts to describe the idyllic setting, he becomes positively rhapsodic:\n\n“I’m nearly dazed in writing the above, and on the Saturday the ladies turned out – oh, yum, yum – and the galaxy of youth and beauty congregated on the daisy-spread field, meandered round the “boundarie” with their masculine attendants, habited in their blazers.”\n\nAt which point, Mid-On presumably stopped writing and went for a lie down. If the scene he describes seems hard to imagine today, it must have been scarcely more believable when he wrote it. Even when the last of the great fixtures against the touring teams took place in 1866, the relentless march of urbanisation and industry was starting to close in around the Kinning Park boundary, with railway lines, factories and tenement housing for artisan workers springing up all around. By 1871, the settlement itself had grown from rural backwater to the status of an independent police burgh (albeit the smallest in Scotland, with an area of just 108 acres). The changing social and political face of industrial Clydeside was reflected in the election of five working class men to the new burgh council, and the forming of the Kinning Park Co-operative Society. You were more likely now to encounter a trade union activist than an archery enthusiast on your way to the cricket, with paved streets rather than country lanes beneath your feet.\n\nWith land for development at a premium, the cricketers’ days at Kinning Park were already numbered. In 1874 the club were informed by Maxwell of Pollok (grandson of the one mentioned above), that it was required for a new goods yard to be built by the Caledonian Railway, whose General Terminus line ran nearby. The landowner did, however, offer a choice of alternative grounds elsewhere on the Estate, and at the end of the 1875 season Clydesdale left Kinning Park for the leafier surroundings of nearby Pollokshields, and the open spaces of their new Titwood ground.\n\nIt wasn’t yet the end for sport at Kinning Park, however. The new game of association football was already rivalling cricket’s popularity amongst fashionable young sportsmen. Clydesdale’s football section was formed around 1872, and with the prestige attached to the club name quickly achieved prominence. They were a founder member of the Scottish Football Association in 1873 and participated in the inaugural Scottish Cup tournament; Kinning Park staged its first cup tie in the opening round, a 6-0 win against Granville, with Clydesdale going on to reach the final. When the railway development came, it swallowed up part of the cricket field, but enough land for a football pitch remained. Before they too flitted to Titwood, Clydesdale’s footballers played one last season at Kinning Park. Events around one of their final games there, a friendly match against The Wednesday in April 1876, illustrate the cramped surroundings that the venue now operated amidst. With a large crowd wanting to see the famous Sheffield club, a grandstand was hastily built on the north side of the pitch. This held around 1000 spectators, while a further 6000 were around the ropes. Perhaps half as many again, however, were locked out, and many did whatever they could to seek alternative vantage points. There was a worrying moment when a shed roof behind one goal – from which around 200 were watching – collapsed, although fortunately there were no serious injuries.\n\nA couple of weeks prior to the Wednesday match, Clydesdale had hosted Rangers. They were evidently impressed by the facilities on offer, because they became the new tenants of the ground that summer. Having started out on Glasgow Green, Rangers had graduated to their first enclosed ground at Burnbank in 1875-76, but the West End location hadn’t proved popular with their already burgeoning support. The move to Kinning Park took them to the south-western fringe of Glasgow for the first time, where they would make their permanent home. Rangers officially opened their new ground on 2nd September 1876, against Vale of Leven.\n\nDuring Rangers’ tenancy of the ground, Kinning Park was chosen by the SFA to host the 1881 Scottish Cup final between Queen’s Park and Dumbarton. Every previous final had been held either at Hamilton Crescent, a spacious cricket ground such as Kinning Park had once been; or at the first Hampden, the most developed football venue then in existence. At a time when interest in football was ever-growing, a large attendance was clearly to be expected for this clash between two of the leading teams in Scotland, but the organisers seemed unconcerned by the cramped location; perhaps the difficulties at the Wednesday match had been forgotten five years on. The weather was fine for the match on Saturday 26th March, and anything up to 20,000 people made their way through the streets of Kinning Park to the ground, making it the largest attendance seen at any match in Scotland up to that point – “beyond anything experienced in the history of football”, as Glasgow’s Evening News put it. The grandstand was packed to capacity well before kick-off, with long queues at the gates. Standing areas became equally packed, with fears that the wire “ropes” would struggle to contain the throng, but officials and police just about managed to maintain order. With viewing difficult, fans clambered anywhere they could for a better look: atop walls, or from railway trucks on the adjacent sidings; some reportedly demolished a small building and fashioned the bricks into a rudimentary platform. Somehow, amid the chaos, the match got underway.\n\nIn a well-contested match, Harry McNeil put defending champions Queen’s Park ahead early on, only for Robert “Sparrow” Brown to equalise for Dumbarton. With the second half degenerating into something of a battle, Johnny Kay put Queen’s back in front, despite Dumbarton vociferously claiming that the ball had previously gone out of play. There was no more scoring, so Queen’s had – apparently – retained the trophy. Amicable relations seemed to have been restored as the two teams adjourned for a post-match tea, but it subsequently emerged that Dumbarton had submitted a protest to the referee on the grounds that spectators had encroached on the pitch, disrupting play. The SFA committee controversially upheld the protest and declared the result void. A report in the London-based paper Bell’s Life suggested that the match would be played again in midweek, with either Kinning Park or, more intriguingly, Maryhill Barracks considered as venues. The latter, opened in 1872, had extensive recreation grounds for military use, but never regularly hosted civilian football. Were the SFA considering the radical step of replaying the game without spectators, the public firmly excluded beyond the Barracks’ formidable stone walls? If so, the Scottish Cup may have had its first closed-doors final long before COVID intervened in 2020 and 2021.\n\nIn the event, it was decided that Kinning Park would host once again, with the date fixed for Saturday 9th April. Extensive precautions were taken to prevent the disorder seen at the first game, with temporary stands installed behind both goals and the inadequate ropes reinforced by wooden barriers at the weakest points. Another sizable crowd assembled, perhaps around 15,000 this time; again there were many watching from outside the ground, with wily local residents charging fans to watch from nearby windows. Rangers, unhappy that people had scaled their clubhouse roof at the first match, looked to prevent a repeat by having it freshly tarred for the occasion. Already angered at having to play again – they lodged a formal protest against the SFA decision – Queen’s Park channelled their frustration in the early stages and blew Dumbarton away, with Dr John Smith recording the first ever Cup final hat-trick within the opening half hour. In another bruising contest, with several players limping before half time, Queen’s held firm, and despite James Meikleham pulling one back early in the second half, the Cup was theirs.\n\nAlthough the replayed final had passed without incident, the scenes at the first match must have contributed to Kinning Park never again being chosen to host a major fixture. Rangers continued to play there for a further six years, and during this era athletics events were also squeezing into the tight confines of the ground. The inaugural Rangers Sports took place there in August 1881, while Clydesdale Harriers, Scotland’s first open athletics club when they formed in 1885, used Kinning Park for training and events; although there was no formal link, their membership had a significant overlap with that of Rangers. One notable football match in this period was a friendly in February 1886 when visitors Airdrieonians ran riot, winning 10-2 in what remains Rangers’ all-time record defeat. The 1886-87 season would be Rangers’ last at Kinning Park, with the ambitious club increasingly frustrated by the cramped conditions and inability to expand capacity. That season was the last in which Scottish clubs were permitted to enter the FA Cup and Kinning Park staged its final competitive fixture in the quarter-final on 19 February 1887, Rangers beating Old Westminsters 5-1 in front of a crowd of around 5 or 6,000. The age of the gentlemen amateurs was fading fast…\n\nFor the following season, both Rangers and the Harriers would move further out from the city towards Govan, where they would open the first Ibrox Park. The final football match at Kinning Park, before this last vestige of green was finally swallowed up, took place a week after the FA Cup tie. Perhaps fittingly, it was the “Moderns” against the “Ancients” – a team of present-day Rangers members against a side from the earliest days of the club, when they had casually kicked a ball about on Glasgow Green. It was an appropriate postscript to Mid-On’s world of leisurely summer entertainment for the middle classes. The age of professional sport played by and for the working masses was now at hand.\n\nContinue reading “Archers to Artisans – the Changing Face of Kinning Park” →\n\nAlthough I’m originally from Glasgow, I’ve lived in Derby for the past 17 years, so I wanted to mention the local team on here sooner or later. As this unusual little story covers one of their trips to Scotland, I thought it would fit in well.\n\nSteve Bloomer looked deathly pale at the best of times. The greatest goalscorer of his era and prototype footballing celebrity he may have been, but with his slight frame and pallid complexion his appearance on the pitch scarcely created the picture of health that his achievements might have led one to expect. But right now, with a steam locomotive thundering past within touching distance and nothing but a thin rail to prevent him from plunging into the dark waters of the Firth of Forth 150 feet below, the man nicknamed “The Ghost” could be forgiven if he looked even more spooked than usual.\n\nIt is April 1899, and Derby County are in Scotland to play a couple of end-of-season friendlies. But today, they have the distinction of being the first, and probably last, football team to walk across the great engineering wonder of the age, the Forth Bridge. And as his teammate Jimmy Methven would later recall, none found the experience more nerve-wracking than Bloomer.\n\nIf he had lost his cool atop the bridge, this was something Bloomer rarely did in front of goal. But less than two weeks earlier, his composure had also been found wanting when he faced up to an equally imposing Victorian edifice, Sheffield United’s 18½-stone goalkeeper William “Fatty” Foulke, in the FA Cup Final at the Crystal Palace. With Derby leading 1-0 through John Boag’s early goal, Bloomer was clean through on Foulke but inexplicably spurned the scoring chance. It was the turning point of the match, with the Blades going on to score four times in the last half hour and carry off the trophy. Finishing as runners-up for the second year running, Derby’s sense of frustration at the opportunity wasted was surely only compounded when they concluded their First Division campaign with a 1-0 win against the same opposition at the Baseball Ground a week later. This time Bloomer got the better of Foulke to score the winner and complete his best-ever season’s tally of 30 goals, and Derby finished an indifferent ninth in the First Division table.\n\nThere was little time to reflect on this achievement, however, with Derby about to embark on a short tour to Scotland and the North of England, stopping in nearby Buxton for the first of four games in five days. The team had used Buxton F.C.’s Silverlands ground for their pre-Cup Final training camp, and had arranged to return and play the Combination club as a token of thanks. The match took place on Tuesday 25th April, and although Buxton took the lead Derby went on to equalise through an goal before goals from Bloomer and Harry Allen secured a 3-1 win. After dining with their opponents, they set off by train for Edinburgh that night.\n\nTwo matches had been arranged against teams from the Scottish First Division on the next two days. On the Wednesday, Derby faced a stiff test against Heart of Midlothian, who had finished second in the league. In front of a crowd of 3,000 at Tynecastle, Bloomer put Derby ahead in the 5th minute. Willie Michael then equalised for Hearts, despite strong claims of offside from the visitors. The home side then went ahead early in the second half through the great Bobby Walker before young Irish forward Tommy Shanks secured a draw for Derby. Both teams treated the game rather more seriously than might have been expected of a friendly, with The Athletic News describing the second half play disapprovingly as “very coarse”.\n\nThe following day, Derby travelled through to the West of Scotland, where they would face Partick Thistle. This was a time when Thistle still played at their old Meadowside ground in Partick, and when the burgh was still independent of Glasgow. On paper, it was an easier match for Derby; Thistle had finished second bottom of the First Division and were due to face a re-election vote, which would subsequently result in them losing their top flight place to Kilmarnock. Securing a visit from the FA Cup finalists was, therefore, seen as something of a coup for the club, but unfortunately the fine weather from the match in Edinburgh was not repeated. It rained heavily, and a much smaller than anticipated crowd meant a financial loss for Thistle. In the first half, Derby were far too strong for their opponents: Bloomer opened the scoring, Shanks added the second from a corner and Bloomer netted a third. It could have been worse for Thistle, with efforts from Bloomer and Boag missing by inches and Hugh McQueen denied the fourth when the half time whistle blew just before his shot entered the net. The hosts rallied in the second half, Frank Waddell – on trial with Thistle from junior club Glasgow Perthshire – scoring on his debut and Geordie McNicoll adding a second, but despite a strong finish they were unable to snatch a draw.\n\nThe exact date of the visit to the Forth Bridge isn’t recorded, but it’s reasonable to assume that the Derby players were resting in Edinburgh on the Wednesday after their overnight journey from Buxton, and went on their excursion some time on Thursday before travelling onwards to Glasgow. The reason that they were able to make the historic crossing was that one of the players was acquainted with a Mr Paton, an official of the bridge’s operators, the North British Railway, who arranged for one of the railway employees to act as guide to the footballers. Jimmy Methven spent over thirty years at Derby as player and manager, but was originally from Ceres in Fife, not far from the North British route taking the line from the bridge towards Dundee; he had also previously played for Edinburgh-based St Bernard’s, and had lived in the capital where the railway had its headquarters, so it’s entirely possible he had the relevant contact. Not that Derby’s travelling party was short of candidates, with Boag, McQueen, Robert Paterson, Johnny May, Billy MacDonald and Charlie Leckie all being Scots-born, while John Goodall – although born in, and capped for, England – had been brought up in Ayrshire. It was when Methven’s reminiscences were serialised by the Derbyshire Football Express in the 1920s that the full details of the adventure were revealed, the irrepressible full-back giving the impression he was at least one of the ringleaders:\n\n“We put pennies on the lines for the fun of seeing the trains flatten them, and every time one roared past, the players hung to the sides of the bridge for dear life, none more affectionately than Steve Bloomer.”\n\nMethven and Bloomer were friends and colleagues for a long time, both joining Derby in 1891 and spending fifteen years as teammates. Later, after becoming manager, Methven would bring Bloomer back for his second stint at the Baseball Ground following a spell at Middlesbrough. Methven’s recollections make it obvious that he relished teasing his normally ice-cool friend. It’s tempting to conclude that he may have had a deliberately selective memory in singling out Bloomer, who could have hardly been the only one of the Derby party to feel a hint of panic as they were buffeted in this exposed and dangerous location. Happily, however, the rest of the bridge walk passed without incident and all would safely return to the less hazardous business of playing football matches. There might have been yet another match in Scotland, Dundee having issued a late invitation for Derby to appear at their Carolina Port ground on Friday, but they were committed to playing Newcastle United on the Saturday and would already be en route to Tyneside by then, so had to decline. No doubt exhausted from the heavy playing schedule, the constant travelling and their exertions on the Forth Bridge, Derby went down to a 4-1 defeat at St James’ Park, with Allen scoring their consolation goal. The players were doubtless pleased to then depart for their close season break, with the Scottish members of the team returning north once again for the summer while the rest travelled on to Derby.\n\nSince the 1899 tour, Derby County have made only a single return visit to Tynecastle, when they played a benefit match for Hearts star Tommy Walker in April 1938. There would be some sightseeing activities for the Derby players this time around too, such as visiting Edinburgh Castle and going on a motor tour of the Borders. There would also be a drive to see the Forth Bridge in the company of Walker; on this occasion, however, everyone was content to marvel at the famous old structure from a safe distance. Back in Derby, Steve Bloomer had only just returned home from another adventure, having been sent on a cruise to Australia in a vain attempt to improve his ailing health. He died on 16th April, less than a week after another generation of Derby players had gazed upon the famous bridge that he had, albeit reluctantly, dared to walk across four decades earlier.\n\nThe reaction last week was very kind – so here, by popular demand (sort of), is the concluding part of Fred Stoessel’s life story. If you missed the first part, where have you been? Well, never mind, you can catch up on Fred’s life prior to the First World War here.\n\nIt took a while for the political machinations in Europe to make their effects felt in Dundee, where the cricket season continued as normal and the Hibs squad assembled for their forthcoming campaign. Hopes were initially high, manager Pat Reilly having retained key players such as Fred Stoessel and the Second Division’s top scorer Collie Martin, and adding some more promising juniors. But by the time the Greens kicked off the new season at Dunfermline, war had been declared and already two of the team had signed up to serve. Fred played in the first three league matches, then the opening Qualifying Cup tie against Forfar. The 4-0 reverse in that match proved to be his farewell to Tannadice, for the time being; the following week, the local papers were reporting that Fred Stoessel had “joined the colours”.\n\nThe regiment Fred joined was the 2/1st Scottish Horse, intended for service on the home front rather than overseas. By the end of October they were stationed at Kettering in Northamptonshire, which enabled Fred to resume his football career. He joined Kettering F.C., who were struggling at the foot of the Central Alliance, scoring in his first match as they ran out 3-1 winners against Loughborough Corinthians. Over the rest of the season, Fred helped them improve to a respectable mid-table finish and run up some big wins, including 6-0 against Sutton Junction, 8-1 against Grantham Avenue (Stoessel playing “a prominent part”, according to the Loughborough Echo) and 9-1 against Leicester Imperial (including two Stoessel goals).\n\nLater in 1915, the regiment were posted to Alford in Lincolnshire, and in August Fred was turning out for a Scottish Horse cricket team against Louth and District. He had seemingly tired of life on the home front, however, as he then transferred to a new regiment, the 1/1st Lovat Scouts (which became the 10th (Lovat Scouts) Battalion of the Queen’s Own Cameron Highlanders the following year). By the end of 1915 he was on the front line at the Dardanelles in Turkey, taking part in the Gallipoli Campaign. There, Fred was reunited with his old teammate Willie Linn, who had joined up with the Royal Naval Division, and the two were able to take part in impromptu footballl matches – albeit with Turkish shells falling within a few hundred yards as they played. Shortly afterwards, Fred’s regiment were redeployed to Egypt, where he was again on the football field, starring in an “international” between Scottish and English regiments and setting up a goal in the 2-2 draw.\n\nBert Stoessel was also in the forces, and news that both brothers had been wounded reached the Dundee papers in June 1917. In Bert’s case, he had been posted to Egypt and then France, where he had been wounded on two occasions. Fred was now in Salonika, Greece, and hospitalised with a fractured arm. He eventually came through the war unscathed, however, and after being demobbed from the Army in April 1919 he immediately returned to Dundee.\n\nNotwithstanding his sojourn at Kettering, Hibs still retained Fred’s registration in Scotland, the club having chosen to keep paying all their players who had been away on service. After one wartime season, the Second Division had closed down in 1915; Hibs had then competed in the Eastern League until that too was mothballed in 1918. When Fred and other demobbed players returned during the 1918-19 season, therefore, the club was playing friendly matches only. He was able to play in a few late season fixtures, mainly against junior opposition but also including one against the other Hibernian, from Edinburgh. Willie Linn was back too, and they briefly resumed their partnership on the left before leaving the club at the season’s end. As life began to move back towards normal, Fred was on the cricket field again too in 1919, now turning out for local clubs Roineach Mhor and Downfield, and the Dundee Corporation XI.\n\nFor the 1919-20 football season, Fred joined Arbroath in the revived Eastern League. He made his debut in a Qualifying Cup derby against Arbroath Amateurs, but didn’t look entirely up to speed despite a 5-1 win. The Hibs were also in the Eastern League, but Fred didn’t feature against his old club; the first meeting at Tannadice was early in the season, before he had signed for Arbroath. He was absent when they clashed again at Gayfield in October; intriguingly, the Arbroath Herald stated he was rested “on account of wedding festivities”, but without elaborating. No member of the Stoessel family appears to have got married around this time – indeed Fred himself seems never to have wed – so the event remains a mystery. He did play when the teams met in January in a secondary competition, the Northern League, a 2-2 draw played at Gayfield in a blizzard. The Herald reported that Fred was one of the few who stood out in what they described as “excruciatingly bad” weather.\n\nHaving left Arbroath, Fred signed for Forfar Athletic in September 1920 and debuted against Brechin City in the Qualifying Cup. Forfar were then playing in the Scottish Alliance, primarily against reserve teams of Scottish League clubs, but even at this modest level he failed to make the expected impact, and was dropped in October. “Stoessel has fallen far short of what was anticipated,” commented the Forfar Herald, “his timidity is most marked”. Approaching his 30th birthday, it seemed Fred’s career was winding down, and over the next year or so he was an itinerant player. He ended that season appearing for Dunkeld and Birnam in the Perthshire Consolation Cup. In 1921-22, he briefly turned out for Downfield in junior football, had a stint with amateur club Roineach Mhor, then returned to Dunkeld and Birnam for the Perthshire Cup. It was something of a surprise, then – or perhaps just an indication of how badly Dundee Hibs were struggling – that he ended the season once again turning out for the Tannadice club in Scottish League football.\n\nThe League had finally reintroduced the Second Division, for the first time since the war, but with two of the new intake scheduled to be culled at the season’s end. A dreadful run of form had left Hibs on the brink of finishing in the bottom two, and amidst Pat Reilly’s increasingly desperate attempts to turn things round, he brought Fred Stoessel back to the club. On 8th April he played his first competitive game for Hibs in eight years and helped them to a 1-0 win over Dunfermline at Tannadice, but their performance was unconvincing. Two days later, another poor showing resulted in a 1-0 defeat at home to East Fife, who played half the game with ten men. “Stoessel failed to do anything with the many opportunities he got”, pronounced the Courier. Two days after that, Hibs played Dundee in a benefit match for Willie Linn, but this time Fred wasn’t in the line-up alongside his old colleague. The experiment of bringing back the former star, had failed; Fred never turned out for the club again, and Hibs lost their League status at the end of the season. By the following weekend he was once again turning out for Dunkeld and Birnam, as they lost 3-1 against Blairgowrie Amateurs in the Atholl Cup final.\n\nFred wound down his sporting career over the next year or so, playing for Dunkeld Juniors in the Perthshire Junior League in 1922-23 and then making his final cricket appearances for Inverary (another Dundee club) in the summer of 1923. Some time after that he left Tayside for good, and it appears that family connections took him initially to Yorkshire. As far back as 1913, when he was linked with a transfer to Bradford, it had been noted in the press that the move may appeal as Fred had family nearby. The 1911 census shows that his sister Florence and her husband were then living in Leeds, and another sister, Gertrude was staying with them. Oldest brother Alexander was still in Scotland at this time, but by the 1920s he too was living in Leeds. While Bert had been in Dundee until war broke out, he served with the York and Lancaster Regiment and the West Yorkshire Regiment. He eventually settled near Leeds in the 1930s, in Pudsey, after spells in Stockton-on-Tees and Derby.\n\nWhile Alexander and Bert would both remain in the Leeds area for the rest of their lives, Fred was soon on the move again. His last UK address, at 35 The Drive in the Cross Gates area of Leeds, is given in the passenger list for HMS Montclare of the Canadian Pacific line, which sailed from Liverpool on 10th March 1927 bound for Saint John, New Brunswick. Fred was off to build a new life in the Canadian prairies, and appears to have spent some time in Alberta before finally settling in Saskatchewan.\n\nThe next time we hear of Fred is in 1929, in the pages of the Saskatoon Star-Phoenix, and it was because he was back on the football pitch. Although the Saskatoon Football Association league contained at least three teams representing the city’s Scottish community, Fred was playing for a military side, the 21st Battery, suggesting he had had gone back into uniform since arriving in Canada. He made his league debut in the inside-left position as the Gunners opened their season with a 2-0 defeat to one of the Scottish sides, the Callies. While he played regularly that year, there’s little mention of Fred over the next few years except for an appearance for the City Cricket Club in 1931 – perhaps suggesting he was on military duties elsewhere.\n\nA few years later, Fred was at the Dundurn Military Camp, about 25 miles south of Saskatoon and undergoing a massive expansion in the mid-1930s. Still playing football, he appeared for Dundurn United in 1934 and was one of their better players as they lost 9-5 on aggregate to Saskatoon Thistles in the Provincial Shield competition. The following year he was with the wonderfully-named Dundurn Potato Bugs, who had newly joined the Saskatoon Football Association. Profiling the team, the Star-Phoenix noted Fred Stoessel’s pedigree with Dundee Hibs and Arbroath. Nearing his 45th birthday, and no doubt in deference to his age and loss of pace despite the modest standard, Fred had by now dropped back into the left-half position from his former wing berth. In 1936 he was back on the cricket field in Saskatoon, taking part in an exhibition match where he “stole the spotlight with some lively hitting” on the way to a score of 42. In 1937, he was playing football for the Callies. The last big game of Fred’s career was at the beginning of the 1938 season. Now a 48-year old veteran, he played left back in a trial match to select a Saskatoon all-star team that would face the Islington Corinthians, an amateur select team from London then coming towards the end of an extraordinary year-long, 95-match, world tour. Sadly, Fred didn’t make it to the final XI so was unable to round off his career with an appearance in this prestigious fixture.\n\nDespite retiring from sport and being almost in his fifties, Fred once again heeded the call when another World War broke out, and he was amongst the “originals” of the Saskatoon Light Infantry who departed for Europe, being part of the first contingent of Canadian troops to cross the Atlantic in December 1939. This meant a brief return to Scotland for Private Stoessel, with the ships docking on the Clyde before proceeding to Aldershot. Little about his personal experience of the Second World War is known, but we can gain some idea of where he might have served. The initial plan to deploy Canadian troops on the continent in 1940 was abandoned following the Dunkirk evacuation, and they spent much of the next few years in the UK until finally seeing large-scale deployment in the Allied invasion of Sicily in 1943. Fred didn’t quite serve throughout the conflict, and was not amongst the select band of originals who also returned to Saskatoon with the regiment in October 1945, but he had served up until the previous year.\n\nReturning to postwar Saskatoon, football and the military continued to be big parts of Fred’s life. Although no longer playing, he remained involved by acting as a referee or linesman in local matches in the late 1940s and early 1950s. When Saskatoon Airport, which had been an Air Force base during the war, returned to civilian use, some of the barracks were converted into a Veterans Home, and Fred was employed here as a caretaker until retiring in 1955. He was active in the Royal Canadian Legion for the last thirty years of his life and was a pallbearer at numerous funerals of former comrades. Fred himself passed away in October 1974, just short of his 84th birthday, and was buried in the Soldiers Field of Woodlawn Cemetery in Saskatoon – the end of a long and varied life spanning three continents on the fields of sport and battle.\n\nI wanted to begin this blog with something Dundee United-related, and I had randomly fallen into researching Fred’s life, simply because his surname and birthplace suggested a more cosmopolitan backstory than was usual for his era (and because trawling through newspaper archives becomes much, much, easier when you’re tracing an uncommon name). Fred was by no means a big star, but it was comparatively easy to put together a lot of detail about an interesting life and career spanning three continents. So here we go, with our first random poke into the corners of sporting history…\n\nIn recent decades, Dundee United supporters have grown accustomed to seeing players from around the globe represent the club, with the 2020-21 squad featuring the likes of Cameroon international Jeando Fuchs, Adrián Spörle from Argentina and Swiss goalkeeper Benjamin Siegrist. In the club’s early days as Dundee Hibernian, the focus was closer to home, with most of the players recruited from local teams. Amongst the various Scottish and Irish surnames in the 1913-14 team, one more unusual name stands out, and that belonged to another player whose family origins lay close to the Alps: Fred Stoessel.\n\nFred pictured in the Dundee Courier, 8th December 1913\n\nNewspaper image © The British Library Board.

With thanks to The British Newspaper Archive (www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk).\n\nFrederick Charles Stoessel was born in the Battersea area of London towards the end of 1890, and by the time of the 1891 census his family were living in Rosenau Road, close to Battersea Park: parents Alexander and Ellen, and their six children – oldest son Alexander junior, four daughters and then baby Fred. Alexander senior, who worked as a “chef de cuisine” (i.e. a head chef), had been born in Basel, Switzerland, in 1854 before coming to London – presumably for restaurant work – where he married Ellen, who was originally from Sussex. They first lived in Brixton, where the four oldest children were born, before moving to Battersea. Within the next few years, however, they were on the move again , to Scotland – another son was born in Edinburgh in 1894, and by the time of the 1901 census the Stoessels had settled in Dundee, living at 1 Forebank Terrace near the foot of the Hilltown.\n\nAs far as the Dundonian public were concerned in the early years of the twentieth century, the most notable bearer of the Stoessel name was not the chef but the Russian imperial general, Anatoly Stoessel, who frequently featured in news coverage of the 1904-05 Russo-Japanese War as he sought to defend the besieged Russian garrison at Port Arthur in Manchuria from the Japanese. The Dundee Football Post was no doubt delighted to introduce a local angle to their coverage in September 1904, with the revelation that one of Alexander’s daughters had written to their famous namesake and received a signed visiting card in return (this snippet appeared next to a cartoon of questionable taste titled “Two Attacks”, that likened the task facing the “little Jap” at Port Arthur to that of the Dundee forwards in that day’s match against Rangers at Dens Park. As it turned out Dundee’s attack was blunted in a 3-0 defeat; the Japanese forces would ultimately achieve a more impressive result, leading to the formerly celebrated General Stoessel being court-martialed for surrendering).\n\nBack in Dundee, it was to be young Fred’s sporting prowess that would keep the Stoessel name in the local press in the coming years. During the 1906-07 season, he was playing for the 3rd XI of Dundee Rangers in the Dundee City Boys League. His name first appears in print in October 1906, around the time of his 16th birthday, when he is listed to appear at outside left against the Glenmore 3rd XI in a Dundee Juvenile Cup tie. He must have impressed that season, as by February he was picked to appear for Dundee against Perth in an inter-city representative match. Stoessel and Rangers went on to clinch that season’s Boys League title, beating Anchorage in a play-off after the two teams finished level on points. He began the following season with the Rangers before switching to another local leam, Waverley, in the Dundee and District League. By the end of that season, Stoessel is to be found lining up for one of the city’s top junior teams, Dundee Violet, as they took on Harp in the final of the Kiddie Charity Cup. This match was played on Clepington Park, so it might just have been Fred’s first appearance at the ground that would be renamed Tannadice when taken over by the newly-formed Dundee Hibs the following year.\n\nGradually, Fred was building a reputation, winning the Dundee and District League with Violet in 1909-10. The Courier reported in December 1909 that he impressed the junior international selectors attending the Consolation Cup tie with Brechin Hearts, despite Violet’s 3-2 defeat. International recognition wasn’t forthcoming, although later that season Stoessel was chosen as a reserve for the team representing the Dundee and District League against the Inter-County League. It was a similar story in January 1911 when he again only made the reserve list for the Forfarshire Junior Association team to play their Perthshire counterparts. He was, however, selected for the Dundee and District League team to take on the Forfar and District League at Tannadice in April. The 1911 census tells us that, away from football, 20-year-old Fred was employed as a municipal clerk with the Dundee Gas Commissioners. The family were still at Forebank Terrace, but Fred’s father had died in 1908 and the five oldest children had by now left home, leaving only Ellen, Fred and younger brother Bert.\n\nFred parted company with Violet that summer, but there was as yet no route for him into senior football, and he joined league rivals Dundee North End for the 1911-12 season. He soon came back to haunt his old teammates, as North End hammered Violet 5-1 in September; “Stoessel was in great form … and had a good say in the big win”, reported the Evening Telegraph. This time round, Fred’s form was enough to secure him a place in the Forfarshire team when Perthshire again visited Tannadice in February. In the opinion of the Tele, he was one of only two Forfarshire forwards to reach “the necessary standard” in the resulting 1-1 draw. Odd, then, that he was only a reserve when the Dundee and Forfar leagues clashed again in March.\n\nWith neither club having enjoyed a particularly successful season, Stoessel left North End in the summer of 1912 to re-sign for Violet – but it proved to be a short-lived return, as he was finally about to graduate to the senior ranks. Signing for Dundee F.C. on amateur forms, he took part in a pre-season public practice match, lining up in his usual outside left position for the “Reds” as they ran out 4-1 winners over the “Blues”. Fred certainly made an impact in front of the 10,000 crowd at Dens Park, his performance being described as “a clever exhibition” by the Courier and “sprightly” by the Tele, but he had been recruited with the reserve team in mind. Dundee ‘A’ were newly elected to the Central League, and an “eager and active” Fred was instrumental in them opening the campaign with a 4-1 win against Alloa Athletic at Dens. The winger, however, suffered a foot injury that would rule him out for much of the season.\n\nLeaving Dundee at the end of the campaign, Fred moved across the road to join Dundee Hibernian, where he would line up alongside his former Violet teammate, inside left Willie Linn. He made his Scottish League debut in Hibs’ opening Division Two match of the season, a goalless draw with St Johnstone at the Recreation Grounds in Perth. He scored his first league goal two weeks later, an equaliser in a 1-1 draw with Leith at Old Logie Green. Hibs, under manager Pat Reilly, went on to have a fairly successful league season, finishing third – their highest position since entering the league in 1910. However it was the Scottish Qualifying Cup that provided some of the highlights of the season.\n\nAfter beating Brechin City in the first round, they faced Dunfermline Athletic at Tannadice and won 3-0, with Stoessel opening the scoring; he “played cleverly, and his goal was brilliantly taken”, according to the Courier. Thanks to a gift scheme run by Hibs supporters, there was a bonus for Fred, who won a cruet set! This win gave Hibs entry to the Scottish Cup itself, but the “Q.C.” run was by no means over. Subsequent wins over East Stirlingshire and Forfar Athletic put them through to a semi-final with Caledonian, of the Highland League. Hibs were hot favourites to make the final, but a 1-1 draw at Tannadice – a poor performance, with Stoessel one of the few on form – meant a difficult trip to Inverness for the replay. But against physical opponents at a snowy Telford Street, Hibs ran out 2-0 winners, with Fred scoring both goals and being proclaimed the hero of the game in the Dundee press. The final pitted Hibs against Second Division rivals Albion Rovers, and took three matches in Edinburgh to settle, with the first game at Tynecastle and replay at Easter Road both finishing 1-1. Rovers had clearly identified Fred as a threat and gave him special attention that effectively subdued his perfomances. The teams returned to Tynecastle for the second replay and it was the Coatbridge club, coping much better with the dreaful conditions, that ran out comfortable 3-0 winners.\n\nAlthough Fred subsequently missed a number of matches in January due to injury, his form had clearly attracted attention. During the cup run, he had been linked with a move to Bradford City in the English First Division (who were managed at the time by future Dundee Hibs manager Peter O’Rourke). After Hibs’ interest in the Scottish Cup had begun and ended in a 5-0 defeat at Airdrie, there were reports that he had been the subject of bids from Liverpool and Preston North End, but although a transfer seemed imminent, he remained at Tannadice. By the end of the season, Fred had had made seventeen league appearances and scored six goals. Despite offers from elsewhere, he was happy at Tannadice, and duly signed on again for another season.\n\nBefore the new football season got underway, Fred turned his attention to cricket. In those days, the summer sport still commanded a good deal of popularity in urban Scotland, and he was one of a number of professional footballers in Dundee who played. Fred was a member of the Dundee Victoria club, who played close to Tannadice on a field at Wester Clepington, and played primarily as a middle order batsman. His name first appears in 1911, initially playing for their second team, the Victoria XI, occasionally alongside his younger brother Bert, before gradually appearing more regularly for the first eleven. By the summer of 1914 Fred was a well-established club member, and in July took part in a novelty cricket match against a team of ladies during the club’s fancy dress carnival, showing his affinity with his adopted homeland by playing in a kilt. But the participants little realised their summer fun was about to be curtailed. The same edition of the Courier that reported on the carnival also covered the ongoing intrigue around the assassination of an Austrian Archduke in Sarajevo three days earlier…\n\nTo be continued…"
