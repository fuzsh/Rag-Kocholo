West of Scotland Football Club was formed in 1865. It began as an off-shoot of the West of Scotland Cricket Club, itself established at Hamilton Crescent, Partick, Glasgow in 1862.

Initially play was confined to contests between club members. West played their first inter-club rugby against Edinburgh Academicals at Hamilton Crescent on 15th November 1867 (a win), with a return game at Raeburn Place on 14th December (a loss). West's distinctive yellow and red striped jersey was introduced as part of a new strip approved at the 1871 Club AGM, replacing the original club colours of blue.

West were amongst the founder members of the Scottish Rugby Union (SRU) in 1873 and enjoyed much early success. They were championship winners several times in the 1880s and 1890s and produced a great many Scottish internationalists through their early history.

In 1890 W.H. Kidston, one of Scotland's great rugby personalities, was elected as the first Club President. He had played for West and Scotland and was Honorary Secretary for 18 years prior to his election as President. He was to the fore when the SRU was formed and later became President of that organisation. He died in 1929.

Activities at West ceased with the outbreak of war in 1914 and did not recommence until the 1919/20 season. The war saw the deaths of many fine West players. A number of local clubs, including Clydesdale and Partickhill, did not survive the war and West gained new players following their closure.

On field success declined in the late 1920s and 1930s but West remained a popular club with a large membership.

Play ceased with the outbreak of war in 1939 and did not begin again until the 1945/46 season. During the war accounts were settled and arrangements cancelled with the Cricket Club at Hamilton Crescent. When hostilities were over, a letter was received from the Board of the Cricket Club saying that they did not see their way to permit the Football Club to return to Hamilton Crescent.

An agreement was reached with Kelvinside Academy to run a joint side and play at Balgray, Kelvinside's ground. This continued until 1951 when the numbers of Kelvinside's own players made it impractical for West to continue with the arrangement. The club was styled as Kelvinside-West during this period.

West continued to play without a home ground for many years. Games were played by arrangement at Glasgow Academicals, St Aloysius, Balgray, Glasgow University, and Old Anniesland. Despite this unusual situation the club continued to thrive.

The Burnbrae site at Milngavie was purchased by West for £1000 in July 1953. However, it would not be until 17th September 1960 and a further investment of £10,000 that the first game, against Glasgow High School FP, would be played at Burnbrae.

The 1960s and early 1970s would prove to be a period of great success and popularity for West, who saw an influx of talent as the only senior 'open club' in Glasgow. Notable players included David Sheldon, Tom Bottomley, Quintin Dunlop, Gordon Brown, Peter Brown, Alastair McHarg, and Sandy Carmichael.

In 1964 Peter Brown became the first West player to be capped since WWII. West were Joint Championship Winners with Hawick in 1965 and Championship Winners in 1971.

West's dominance declined as the 1970s progressed. In 1973 the Scottish League Championship was established replacing the old Scottish Unofficial Championship. West were initially placed in the top tier but were unable to maintain this position, their 'golden era' at an end.

The first 'midi' and 'mini' youth sections were established at West in the 1980s.

The onset of the professional era in the mid to late 1990s hit hard at West, who slid to Premier Division Three. There was a decline in support for the club and subsequent financial pressure.

The mid 2000s to early 2010s saw a resurgence in fortunes. West won the Scottish Rugby Shield in the 2005/06 season, were Premiership Division Three Champions in 2006/07, and Premiership Division Two Champions in 2007/08. West played in Premiership Division One between 2008 and 2011, being relegated at the end of the 2010/11 season.

In the 2021/22 season West's First XV play in Scottish National League Division Three. The Second XV play in the BT National Reserve League Division 2, and the 2A XV play in BT West Reserve League Division 1. The Women's team (The Burnbrae Belles) play in the Tennent's National League Division 1. There is an occasional 'golden oldies' team, known as the Burnbrae Bulls, and an active Junior & Youth Rugby Section and development centre.
