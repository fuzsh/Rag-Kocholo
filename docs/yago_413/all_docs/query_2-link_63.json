        "text": "Samuel L. Jackson is everywhere in the Marvel-verse this year — but when it comes to his old pal Quentin Tarantino, the actor is notably missing from the director’s new flick, “Once Upon a Time in Hollywood.”\n\nJackson appeared in six of the eight films Tarantino wrote and directed, starting with 1994’s “Pulp Fiction.” Since then, he’s played both major roles and bit-part cameos, making him Tarantino’s most frequently tapped actor — so it seems odd to see him suddenly MIA.\n\nThough the actor remained mum about it, he hinted last summer that the “Inglorious Basterds” director had simply never called.\n\n“I have no idea. I just haven’t heard from him,” the 70-year-old told Cinemablend when pressed about his participation in “Hollywood.”\n\n“I’m insulated. I’ve been doing ‘Captain Marvel.’ ”\n\nJackson, whose films cumulatively have grossed more than any other actors’, has had a very full plate this year in the superhero world, with consecutive appearances in “Captain Marvel,” “Avengers: Endgame” and “Spider-Man: Far from Home,” all as the eye-patched Nick Fury.\n\nBut a busy schedule never seemed to get between him and a Tarantino film before.\n\nIn 2004, Jackson made a brief cameo appearance in “Kill Bill Vol. II” as Rufus, the piano player at a wedding, even though he was also voicing one of the leads in “The Incredibles.”\n\nIn 2009’s “Inglourious Basterds” Jackson surfaced as the narrator in two scenes.\n\nRumors swirled during the summer of 2017 that the 56-year-old Tarantino was considering Jackson for a major part in “Once Upon a Time in Hollywood.”\n\n“Samuel L. Jackson likely also will play a lead in the film, not a surprise since he is to Tarantino what Clarence Clemons was to Bruce Springsteen,” sources told Deadline’s Mike Fleming Jr.\n\nTarantino’s latest feature, which stars heavyweights Leonardo DiCaprio, Brad Pitt and Margot Robbie, hits theaters Friday.\n\nReps for both Jackson and Tarantino didn’t return repeated requests for comment."
