        "text": "VOICE OVER: Rebecca Brayton WRITTEN BY: Nick Spake\n\nThe Marvel Cinematic Universe, the DC Extended Universe, and the Monsterverse are all great examples of cinematic shared universes, but did you know that noted auteur Quentin Tarantino's movies are all connected in ways you might not expect? WatchMojo explains how the, uh, Tarantinoverse reveals itself, from the Vega brothers in \"Reservoir Dogs\" and \"Pulp Fiction\", to the Fox Force Five in \"Pulp Fiction\" and \"Kill Bill\", and the ever-present Red Apple Cigarettes.\n\nHow the Tarantino Movies are Connected\n\nLong before there was an MCU, Quentin Tarantino was constructing his own cinematic universe - although we’re not sure how his R-rated “Star Trek” movie would fit in... Welcome to WatchMojo and today we’ll be discussing how the Tarantino Movies are Connected. Just so you know, if you haven’t seen all of his films yet, there may be some spoilers ahead - so you have been warned.\n\nFrom early on in his career, fans of Tarantino’s work have been picking up on little details that seemingly connect his films together. In a 2016 interview with the Australian talk show “The Project,” Tarantino confirmed that his movies are indeed intertwined - although it’s a bit more complex than you might think. As Tarantino explains it, a majority of the films he has directed and written exist within the Realer-Than-Real Universe, while a select few take place in a separate Movie Universe. So, for example, “Reservoir Dogs” and “Pulp Fiction” are both set in the Realer-Than-Real Universe. But, if Vincent and Jules were to go to the movies, they’d see something like “Kill Bill” or “From Dusk till Dawn.” The only film Tarantino has directed that’s not part of either universe is “Jackie Brown,” which was an adaptation of the novel “Rum Punch” and thus sets itself in the Elmore Leonard Universe. Coincidentally, another film set in the Elmore Leonard Universe is Steven Soderbergh’s “Out of Sight,” which sees the return of Michael Keaton as Ray Nicolette.\n\nPerhaps the most famous connection in the Realer-Than-Real Universe is between Vincent Vega in “Pulp Fiction” and Mr. Blonde, aka Victor Vega, in “Reservoir Dogs.” It’s no coincidence that they share the same surname, as these criminals are brothers. Tarantino actually tinkered with the idea of a crossover movie about the Vega brothers, although it would’ve been tricky to pull off since both men die in their respective films. Plus, since actors John Travolta and Michael Madsen have obviously aged since the early ‘90s, a prequel wouldn’t make sense at this point either. In “Reservoir Dogs,” Vic also mentions that he has a parole officer named Seymour Scagnetti, who’s presumably related to Jack Scagnetti in “Natural Born Killers,” which originated from a Tarantino screenplay.\n\nThe Vegas aren’t the only characters who bridge this universe together: in “Django Unchained,” a member of the Smitty Bacall gang is named ‘Crazy’ Craig Koons, and he happens to be an ancestor of Captain Koons, Christopher Walken’s character in “Pulp Fiction. Pete Hicox, a member of the Domergue Gang in “The Hateful Eight,” is the great great grandfather of Archibald ‘Archie’ Hicox from “Inglourious Basterds.” Speaking of the Basterds, Sgt. Donny Donowitz, aka The Bear Jew, is the father of film producer Lee Donowitz from “True Romance,” which Tarantino wrote. It’s even been speculated that Jimmy’s wife Bonnie in “Pulp Fiction” is the same nurse that Nice Guy mentions in a deleted scene from “Reservoir Dogs,” as well as the same Bonnie mentioned in “True Romance.” Or maybe Tarantino just really likes the name Bonnie. Plus, given their stunt backgrounds, we also wouldn’t be surprised if there’s a connection between Kurt Russell and Zoë Bell’s characters in “Death Proof” and “Once Upon a Time in... Hollywood.”\n\nJust to keep things extra interesting… The Realer-Than-Real Universe and the Movie Universe are separate, but that doesn’t mean they can’t intersect. Tarantino has described Winston Wolfe from “Pulp Fiction” as a crossover character who isn’t relegated to a single universe, although we’ve yet to see him in another film. “Kill Bill” takes places in the Movie Universe, but “Vol. 2” contains a subtle reference to “Django Unchained,” which is set in the Realer-Than-Real Universe: when Budd is burying the Bride alive, we can spot a grave that reads Paula Schultz. Although not confirmed, many believe she was bounty hunter Dr. King Schultz’s late wife - or at least some sort of relation. So, does that mean Schultz is a crossover character too?\n\nTwo characters who’ve repeatedly popped up in both universes are Texas Ranger Earl McGraw and his son, Edgar McGraw. Earl made his first appearance in “From Dusk till Dawn,” which was written by Tarantino and directed by Robert Rodriguez. Although Earl dies in that film, this didn’t stop him from resurfacing alongside Edgar in “Kill Bill: Volume 1.” In “Grindhouse,” another collaboration between Tarantino and Rodriguez, Earl broke out the cowboy hat again in the Rodriquez-directed “Planet Terror” and shares another conversation with his son in the Tarantino-directed “Death Proof.” The McGraws appear in “From Dusk till Dawn: The Series” as well, although they’re played by different actors.\n\nArguably the most intriguing link between the Realer-Than-Real Universe and the Movie Universe lies within Mia Wallace’s failed television pilot “Fox Force Five.” As Mia tells Vincent in “Pulp Fiction,” the show would’ve centered on an all-female secret agent team. Whether it was intentional or not, the five members Mia describes bear a striking resemblance to the ladies of “Kill Bill.” There’s a blonde leader named Somerset O’Neil, who could be Elle Driver, a Japanese kung fu specialist, i.e. O-Ren Ishii, an African-American demolition expert, i.e. Vernita Green, and a French fox who specializes in sex, i.e. Sofie Fatale. Finally, there’s Mia’s character, Raven McCoy, “the deadliest woman in the world with a knife,” not unlike Beatrix Kiddo.\n\nIn addition to characters, Tarantino has created several fictional brands that have appeared across his cinematic universes. The fast food chain Big Kahuna Burger is most prominently displayed in “Pulp Fiction” when Vincent and Jules interrupt Brett’s breakfast. However, the chain is also referenced or visible in “Reservoir Dogs,” “Death Proof,” “Four Rooms,” “From Dusk till Dawn” and “Once Upon a Time in… Hollywood.” A Big Kahuna bag even pops up in Robert Rodriguez’s “The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl,” although we doubt that’s part of any Tarantino universe.\n\nRick Dalton stars in an ad for Red Apple cigarettes in “Once Upon a Time in... Hollywood.” But, that is far from the first time this fictional cigarette brand has surfaced in a Tarantino movie: it’s also featured in “Pulp Fiction,” “From Dusk Till Dawn,” “Four Rooms,” “Kill Bill” and “The Hateful Eight.” Another notable brand created by Tarantino is G.O. Juice, which can be seen in both “Death Proof” and “Kill Bill.” And, let’s be honest: there isn’t a Tarantino fan who hasn’t wanted to bite into a tasty Big Kahuna burger and wash it down with G.O. Juice.\n\nJust to clarify, the Realer-Than-Real universe doesn’t exist in our universe per se, as Tarantino has rewritten history on more than one occasion. In “Inglourious Basterds,” Adolf Hitler doesn’t commit suicide with Eva Braun: he gets shot, then blown to smithereens with a theater full of other Nazi Party members. In “Once Upon a Time in… Hollywood,” actress Sharon Tate and her house guests aren’t murdered by the Manson family. Instead, it’s the three Manson family members who’re killed by Rick Dalton, Cliff Booth, and a dog. Actually, considering “Once” and “Basterds” exist in the same universe, could Dalton’s Nazi movie “The 14 Fists of McCluskey” be a recreation of the “historical events” that happened in “Basterds”? Hmmmm...\n\nWhat’s more, Tarantino himself has acted as a constant presence in his movies: over the years, he’s appeared as Mr. Brown in “Reservoir Dogs,” Jimmie in “Pulp Fiction,” Chester in “Four Rooms,” Richard in “From Dusk Till Dawn,” Warren in “Death Proof,” and multiple characters in “Django Unchained,” just to name a few. Are all of these characters related somehow or do they just so happen to look like Tarantino? Actually, there are quite a few actors Tarantino likes to cast regularly: so, like, is the Buddy Holly waiter played by Steve Buscemi in “Pulp Fiction” really Mr. Pink in disguise? Okay, at this point we’re probably overanalyzing things. So, as Vincent would say, “I think we should be leaving now.”"
