        "text": "Oscars 2020: Brad Pitt wins Best Supporting Actor\n\nQuentin Tarantino loves to show up in his movies, similarly to directors like M. Night Shyamalan and Alfred Hitchcock. ometimes his cameos are pretty short and sweet, as he turns up in voice or just walking through a scene. Other times, he is a full character with many lines and on-screen moments, giving himself some killer quotes.\n\nDoes Quentin Tarantino have a cameo in Once Upon A Time in Hollywood?\n\nThe short answer is yes, he does. However, unlike most of his cameos, there’s a small difference.\n\nThis time Tarantino is not physically seen on screen but instead just his voice his heard.\n\nIn the post credit scene Rick Dalton, played by Leonardo DiCaprio, is seen filming a TV commercial for Red Apple Cigarettes.\n\nOff screen, a director is heard giving Dalton advice on how best to sell the cigarettes - and that voice is Tarantino’s.\n\nFans may not only recognise the voice of Tarantino, but also the cigarette brand Dalton is selling, as these have also made cameo appearances in his films.\n\nMost famously, Uma Thurman’s characters Mia and The Bride in Pulp Fiction and Kill Bill have been seen either smoking, holding the packet or walking past billboards for the famed brand.\n\nThey have also showed up as early as Reservoir Dogs, Tarantino’s first film, where his character Mr Brown had them stashed in his car.\n\nInvalid email\n\nWe use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Read our Privacy Policy\n\nWhat other cameos has Quentin Tarantino had in his films?\n\nQuentin Tarantino’s roles in his films have ranged from big parts to just a quick turn.\n\nIn his first film, Reservoir Dogs, Tarantino plays Mr Brown, one of the heist crew who sadly meets his end pretty early, though viewers have to wait until near the end of the movie to discover his fate.\n\nTarantino plays Jimmie in Pulp Fiction, who offers his house for Jules (Samuel L Jackson,) Vincent (John Travolta) and Winston Wolfe (Harvey Keitel) to clean up their accidental kill.\n\nIn Jackie Brown, Tarantino also takes an off-screen role as he plays the voice on Jackie’s answering machine, while in the Kill Bill Vol. 1, he features as a masked corpse, so could be completely missed to those not looking hard enough.\n\nIn Kill Bill Vol. 2, Tarantino makes his first cameo as the voice of a director off screen, before his Deathproof cameo returns to his more sizeable roles as he plays the bartender, Warren, during the infamous lap dance.\n\nTarantino’s second turn as a corpse comes in Inglourious Basterds, where he plays a dead Nazi being scalped.\n\nIn Django Unchained, Tarantino has two cameos: he plays one of the Australian cowboys who are looking to buy Django (Jamie Foxx) as a slave, and one of the Ku Klux Klan 'bag heads' who go to lynch Django.\n\nAnd finally, Tarantino does his third off-camera voice role as the narrator in The Hateful Eight."
