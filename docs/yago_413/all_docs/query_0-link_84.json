        "text": "Watching Movies at a young age\n\nZastoupil encouraged his love of movies, and accompanied the young Tarantino to numerous film screenings. Tarantino's mother allowed him to see movies with adult content, such as Carnal Knowledge (1971) and Deliverance (1972). After his mother divorced Zastoupil in 1973, Tarantino was later sent to live with his grandparents in Tennessee. He remained there for about six months to a year, before returning to California.
