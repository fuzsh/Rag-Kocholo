        "text": "Samuel L. Jackson is revealing why he loves working with Quentin Tarantino.\n\nAmid the Pulp Fiction 30th Anniversary celebration, Jackson opened up about why he likes being part of Tarantino’s films.\n\n“Tarantino films are very different in that, yes, they are character-driven,” Jackson told AP on April 18. “So when you read a Tarantino script, you all of a sudden find yourself knowing you’re going to have a lot to say about who you are and how you feel about things rather than reading five pages of, ‘OK, drive fast, look this way, the car is going over a curb.'”\n\nHe continued, “So there are a lot of more things that you have to embody as a character and bring with you to do it. The fact that I spent years and years in theater helped me a lot to embrace what Quentin does. And he appreciates it in another way because he knows that I’m used to giving speeches, and I like it.”\n\nAfter working in Tarantino’s Pulp Fiction, Jackson went on to appear in films like Jackie Brown, Kill Bill, Inglorious Basterds, Django Unchained and The Hateful Eight. Jackson also appeared in True Romance, a film directed by Tony Scott in 1993 and written by Tarantino."
