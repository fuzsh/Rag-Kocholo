        "text": "I'm really looking forward to Inglourious Basterds. I expect it will be brimful of puerile in-jokes, pop-culture references and gratuitous violence, while being entirely lacking in moral gravity and transcendental style. Indeed, I shall be terribly disappointed if it's not. That is what I have come to expect from Quentin Tarantino, and that is what I like.\n\nMy feelings about Tarantino seem to have followed the reverse trajectory to those of many of his erstwhile fans, who hailed Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction as evidence of the Second Coming but with each new film have grown increasingly teed off, as though they were waiting for him to morph into Michael Haneke. I doubt Tarantino has the desire, the intellectual rigour or even the life experience to mature into the popular idea of a \"serious\" cineaste, and I say thank God for that. We've got enough films like The Reader as it is.\n\nI don't set out to be contrary, but you know how things are. One minute you're laughing your socks off at Observe and Report, and then, when you scan the critical consensus in the confident expectation of that warm and fuzzy sensation of having your judgment corroborated, you get hit in the face by such a blast-wave of invective that you start questioning your own opinion. For about five minutes, anyway. If I've learned anything in all my years of filmgoing, it's that I'm right and everyone else is wrong. Odds are, they'll come round to my way of thinking in a few years' time, the way they finally saw the light about Heaven's Gate, and The Thing, and Death Proof. Well, maybe not that last one, but you get my drift.\n\nOne of the reasons I like Tarantino more than I used to is that his women's roles have been getting stronger. One can't expect adolescent fanboys to get excited about this - they prefer girls to be seen and not heard, preferably dressed in punk-stripper outfits - but it works for me. Reservoir Dogs was notably oestrogen-free, and while there was a little more chick-activity in Pulp Fiction, it was the boys who got all the best lines. But, surprisingly for a director whose early screenplays reduced women to walk-ons and prostitutes (yes, True Romance, I'm looking at you) and whose imitators continue to plough that furrow (yes, Guy Ritchie, I'm looking at you), Tarantino has since shown himself to be one of those rare directors who film actresses so they appear like real people rather than airbrushed fantasy objects.\n\nJackie Brown, of course, was a welcome showcase for the glory that is Pam Grier. I'm not a fan of Uma Thurman, but she's magnificent in Kill Bill, where Tarantino encourages her to be ugly, at the unkempt extremes of physical endurance, in a way that only makes her more attractive. As for Death Proof, if you haven't seen the version with Vanessa Ferlito's lapdance, you've missed out; it's the opposite of demeaning, and a celebration of the female physique with a proper belly and bottom. Only a director who really likes women could film them like this.\n\nAnother reason I enjoy Tarantino's movies is that we're both partial to the same genres. As an addict of 1970s kung fu, I can't say I felt let down when Kill Bill cobbled together many of the cliches of my favourite Shaw Brothers canon, including a simple, vengeance-propelled plot, extreme bloodiness and extraordinary choreography. The elements themselves might not be original, but the way Tarantino tweaks them into a gung-ho cinematic pop-art collage is. The only other director who pulled off this trick with such panache is Jean-Luc Godard, who in the 1960s pick'n'mixed his Hollywood bonbons to create something derivative yet at the same time deeply personal. You could never mistake a Godard film for the movies he is referencing.\n\nThe comparison may help explain why Death Proof flopped. It borrows elements from exploitation, yet it isn't in any respect an exploitation movie. It's not even commercial. It's an art film, dammit, but fun. You wait. One day you'll see it my way."
