        "text": "Zed's dead baby, Zed’s dead. Join http://www.WatchMojo.com as we count down our picks for the Top 10 Deaths in Quentin Tarantino Movies.\n\nFor this list, we’re looking at key moments in Quentin Tarantino movies that left us shocked or laughing. Since Tarantino movies are well known for being violent, the content in this video is pretty graphic as well, so here is your warning. And of course, since this list is about deaths, there will of course be spoilers ahead. You have been warned.\n\n#10: The Brittle Brothers\n\n“Django Unchained” (2012)\n\nIn the lead up to this moment from the 2012 western, Django and Schultz are travelling through the Bennett Plantation. While the doctor is discussing a deal with the owner of the property, the titular Django takes the opportunity to search for his former owners, the Brittle Brothers. After being offered a flashback sequence for context to make the impending kills even more satisfying, we witness Django kill the first Brittle brother, following it up with a witty one-liner. He then kills another sibling before the doctor joins him to finish off the third. Every slave is shocked – probably in a good way – and so we are – definitely in a good way.\n\n#9: Bill\n\n“Kill Bill: Vol. 2” (2004)\n\nThis was the one scene everyone had waited for throughout the two “Kill Bill” volumes: the death of Bill. After our heroine kills everyone else who participated in her wedding chapel massacre, Beatrix Kiddo goes after the titular Bill. The confrontation between her and her former lover is short, but revealing. And after The Bride has said what she needs to say, she ends Bill’s life. How? With the Five Point Palm Exploding Heart technique that she was secretly taught by master Pai Mei. A surprisingly emotional moment is added to the scene when Bill takes a brief moment to make peace with his killer. It’s spectacular, it’s dramatic and it’s a fitting end to the story.\n\n#8: Arlene, Shanna, ‘Jungle’ Julia & Lanna\n\n“Death Proof” (2007)\n\nIf you thought Pam’s death was gory, think again. In this scene from the exploitation horror flick, four women leave a bar and drive off into the night while blasting their music at high volume. Unfortunately, they’ve been targeted by Stuntman Mike, a serial killer who kills women with his death-proof car. After smashing Pam’s skull on the dashboard, he moves onto the foursome, crashing into their car at high speed. What makes this scene particularly special is how the crash was shot and edited: it’s viewed from several different angles and we see precisely how each of the women died via slow motion. It’s violent, gross and unforgettable.\n\n#7: Melanie Ralston\n\n“Jackie Brown” (1997)\n\nIn “Jackie Brown,” Louis Gara isn’t exactly known for his patience, but unfortunately, Melanie decided to annoy him on a very bad day. After the money trade with Jackie in the fitting room, Melanie goes out and mocks Louis and his partner for their incompetency. This irritates Louis to the point that he tells her not to say another word. Despite the threat, Melanie quips ‘‘Okay, Louis\" and it’s the final straw; Louis loses his temper and shoots Melanie dead. Oops…\n\n#6: Brett\n\n“Pulp Fiction” (1994)\n\nThis is probably the most well known scene in “Pulp Fiction,” and for good reason. Vincent Vega and Jules Winnfield, who work for gangster Marsellus Wallace, are after a man named Brett, because he’s stolen from their boss. After they appear at his apartment, the thief soon discovers that the pair isn’t there to eat cheeseburgers. Jules decides to demonstrate how well he knows the Biblical passage referred to as Ezekiel 25:17 by reciting its words and gunning down Brett with Vincent’s help. With its dark humor and excellent acting, this scene clearly shows just how well written Quentin Tarantino movies can be.\n\n#5: Vincent Vega\n\n“Pulp Fiction” (1994)\n\nFor this entry, we remain in the world of “Pulp Fiction” and turn our attention to the unexpected death of Vincent Vega. Unable to leave his gold watch behind, Butch returns to his apartment despite the knowledge that he’s wanted by Marsellus and his crew for winning the boxing match he’d been paid to throw. After spotting a gun on the counter and hearing the sound of a toilet flush, Butch realizes he’s not alone and points the gun toward the bathroom door. Vega waltzes out only to be confronted by Butch, and the tension between the two, along with some fatefully timed toast, ultimately results in this surprising but notable death.\n\n#4: ‘Monsieur’ Calvin J. Candie\n\n“Django Unchained” (2012)\n\nAfter some complications, the papers to free Broomhilda are finally signed by both parties. However, Calvin Candie isn’t giving up his slave THAT easily and requests a last handshake from Schultz. After the doctor’s refusal, Candie makes a threat and insists his request be followed through. But that’s when things go bad, because, while feigning the act, Schultz takes out a gun and shoots Calvin straight in the heart, instantly killing the brutal plantation owner. Even though the decision ultimately costs the doctor his life, this scene remained a gratifying end to a despicable character.\n\n#3: Matsumoto\n\n“Kill Bill: Vol. 1” (2003)\n\nThe influence of anime in “Kill Bill” is very clear, but it’s particularly evident during this completely animated flashback scene showcasing O-Ren Ishii’s origins. After seeing her parents die before her eyes, the half-Japanese, half-Chinese army brat swore revenge on the man who killed them. Two years later, the 11 year old would get it by assassinating the Yakuza crime boss in his bed. Surprisingly, especially for a Tarantino film, this scene made us empathize with the villain. Even though the death of O-Ren’s bodyguard Gogo is pretty brutal too, it’s hard to deny the artistry and satisfaction found by watching Matsumoto meet his end.\n\n#2: Adolf Hitler & the Cinema Massacre\n\n“Inglourious Basterds” (2009)\n\nAfter seeing her entire family die at the hands of Hans Landa, Shosanna Dreyfus takes the opportunity to get her revenge by organizing the killing of the Nazis’ top leaders. What’s the plan? With the leaders, including Adolf Hitler himself, set to attend the premiere of a Nazi propaganda film at Dreyfus’ own cinema, she and her colleague/lover – along with the titular Basterds – will destroy the theater and everyone in it. The plan works, with the cinema going up in flames and the Basterds personally ensuring Hitler’s death by submachine gun – however, not all of the heroes and heroines make it out alive. While the scene couldn’t have been further from what happened in real life, almost everybody would agree that it still made for a very fulfilling – albeit strikingly violent – climax.\n\nBefore we unveil our top picks, here are a few honorable mentions.\n\n- Louis Gara\n\n“Jackie Brown” (1997)\n\n- Mr. Blonde\n\n“Reservoir Dogs” (1992)\n\n- The Bear Jew Kills a Nazi\n\n“Inglourious Basterds” (2009)\n\n- Stephen\n\n“Django Unchained” (2012)\n\n- Budd\n\n“Kill Bill: Vol. 2” (2004)\n\n#1: Marvin\n\n“Pulp Fiction” (1994)\n\nAfter killing Brett in his apartment, Vincent and Jules leave in their car with Marvin, the last survivor. Shocked to have made it out alive, Jules begins to think that their very close brush with death was God’s way of telling him to quit his job as a hit man. Incredulous and uncomprehending, Vincent turns back to ask Marvin’s opinion about his partner’s decision. But while doing so, Vincent unintentionally shoots Marvin in the face, which leaves blood and brains all over their car. Coming completely out of the blue, Marvin’s demise is definitely the best and the most surprising death out of any of Tarantino’s films and that’s why it tops our list.\n\nDo you agree with our list?
