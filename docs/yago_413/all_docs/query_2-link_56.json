        "text": "How many Quentin Tarantino movies does the director cameo in?\n\nQuentin Tarantino is known for his pioneering work as a director, making stylish black comedy and action movies drawing inspiration from genre filmmaking and classic low-budget exploitation pictures. What’s not as well-known is his extensive acting career. Tarantino has actually starred in far more movies than he’s written or directed.\n\nIncluding cameo appearances, Tarantino has starred in no fewer than 27 feature films as an actor in some capacity. But this includes movies made by other filmmakers. Tarantino himself has only made 14 movies in total taking short films into account, while writing the screenplay for additional two and helping to produce two others.\n\nAmong these movies, we’ve seen several standout Tarantino performances. There’s his convincing performance as Mr Brown in Reservoir Dogs, his feature film directorial debut, in which he more than holds his own alongside all-time acting greats like Harvey Keitel and Steve Buscemi. And his hilarious turn as put-upon house husband Jimmie in the final of Pulp Fiction.\n\nThen there are the ones that stand out for the wrong reasons. Such as the bizarre footplay scene he wrote for himself in the Robert Rodriguez-directed horror flick From Dusk Till Dawn. Or his nonsensical cameo as an Australian miner in Django Unchained, which is so bad that it manages to derail the movie despite its brevity and lack of importance.\n\nSo, how many of his own films is he in?\n\nCumulatively, Tarantino has acted in 13 of his own movies, 12 of which he’s directed, with the other being his From Dusk Till Dawn writer-actor credit. These numbers include short films, uncredited, non-speaking roles, and movies that only feature his voice, such as his part as narrator in The Hateful Eight or his cameo on the answering machine in Jackie Brown.\n\nThere’s only one feature film that Tarantino’s directed in which he himself doesn’t also act. That film is Kill Bill: Volume 2, which is in fact the second part of a double-movie saga. Tarantino apparently didn’t feel the need to insert himself into the second instalment of Kill Bill, as he’d already appeared in Volume 1 of the saga, as one of O-Ren Ishii’s Crazy 88 gang of fighters.\n\nOtherwise, Tarantino has a full house of appearances in his own feature-length movies. His cameos have become an ever-present element of his films that fans are always on the lookout for. That is, when he doesn’t spoil it for us."
