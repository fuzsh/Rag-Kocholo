        "text": "All of Quentin Tarantino’s movies in order of release and chronological order, too. Plus, we look at the connections between his films, and what’s next for the legendary director.\n\nAuteur Quentin Tarantino was set to tap out as a director after his tenth and final film, The Movie Critic. Things have since changed, with his next film up in the air.\n\nNo new movies will follow his tenth, according to Tarantino, but he’ll leave behind an illustrious career, with projects many have called some of the best movies ever.\n\nWhether you’re new to his filmography or want to revisit it, below are all the Tarantino films to add to your list and the different ways to order them.\n\nContents:\n\nQuentin Tarantino movies in release order\n\nQuentin Tarantino movies in chronological order\n\nWhat are the Quentin Tarantino movies he didn’t direct?\n\nAre Quentin Tarantino’s movies connected?\n\nWhat is Quentin Tarantino’s next movie?\n\nQuentin Tarantino movies in release order\n\nTarantino’s first movie was Reservoir Dogs, back in 1992. His most recent release was Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, in 2019.\n\nQuentin Tarantino movies in release order:\n\nReservoir Dogs (1992)\n\nPulp Fiction (1994)\n\nJackie Brown (1997)\n\nKill Bill: Volume 1 (2003)\n\nKill Bill: Volume 2 (2004)\n\nDeath Proof (2007)\n\nInglourious Basterds (2009)\n\nDjango Unchained (2012)\n\nThe Hateful Eight (2015)\n\nOnce Upon a Time in Hollywood (2019)\n\n1. Reservoir Dogs (1992)\n\nAlthough Tarantino had directed short-form projects before, Reservoir Dogs was his first major, feature-length motion picture.\n\nHe kicked his career off with this succinct crime/thriller, which tells the tale of six criminals who land in hot water when a diamond heist goes awry. It’s a sweaty and unpolished film, with Tarantino’s signature quippy dialogue and shock factor.\n\nReservoir Dogs would also mark the start of long-term working relationships between the director and several actors, including Michael Madsen and Tim Roth.\n\n2. Pulp Fiction (1994)\n\nThe granddaddy of them all. Credited with defining modern Hollywood, Pulp Fiction is considered one of the greatest films ever made. Interwoven tales of mobsters, boxers, and hitmen unfold in a non-linear narrative filled with Tarantino’s trademark dialogue.\n\nAlthough it was only his second movie, it would seal Tarantino’s style and deliver his first Oscar nominations. It was a quick turnaround too, coming out in 1994 only two years after Reservoir Dogs\n\n3. Jackie Brown (1997)\n\nIt was another three years before Jackie Brown, the hidden gem of QT’s filmography (if such a thing can exist), was released in 1997.\n\nStarring the iconic Pam Grier, the drama/thriller has a warmer and more romantic tone. It follows a charming flight attendant embroiled in a smuggling plot and is full of double-crosses and desperate attempts to outwit the law.\n\n4. Kill Bill: Volume 1 (2003)\n\nQuentin Tarantino’s first full-blown action flick, Kill Bill is his coolest film and entered Uma Thurman’s ‘The Bride’ into the genre’s hall of fame.\n\nWith heavy doses of influence from Eastern cinema, in Kill Bill: Volume 1 a vengeful woman sets out on a mission to kill her former allies who betrayed her on her wedding day.\n\nCathartic, stylized, and brilliantly edited, Kill Bill worked as a seamless transition to early 2000s filmmaking for Tarantino.\n\n5. Kill Bill: Volume 2 (2004)\n\nComing out one year after its predecessor, Tarantino sees the Kill Bill story as one saga and would have preferred to release them as one huge epic instead of splitting it into two halves.\n\nThat said, there’s nothing bad about watching Volume 2 in isolation. It’s a tonal departure from the first, with The Bride slowly hunting the man who betrayed her. It feels like a Western movie in some areas, and a patient samurai film in others.\n\nTarantino has hinted at doing Kill Bill 3, he enjoyed making them so much.\n\n6. Death Proof (2007)\n\nTarantino’s attempt at girl power, Death Proof is an outlier in his filmography as it’s a smaller road movie that wasn’t an obvious follow-up to the likes of Pulp Fiction. But nothing Tarantino does is obvious, so that tracks.\n\nIn Death Proof, a psychotic stuntman stalks and murders young women with his car, until he meets a group of friends who turn the tables on him.\n\nWith awesome stunt work, gratuitous violence, and some charming characters played by actresses at the start of their careers, Death Proof shouldn’t be skipped.\n\n7. Inglourious Basterds (2009)\n\nInglourious Basterds is the most Hollywood-glazed Tarantino movie. Full of huge names like Brad Pitt and Christoph Waltz, and employing overseas talents like Diane Kruger and Mélanie Laurent, this war movie was an awards hit.\n\nIt’s about a group of Jewish-American soldiers embarking on a mission to assassinate Nazi leaders during World War II, while characters of different nationalities face their dangers elsewhere.\n\n8. Django Unchained (2012)\n\nBy 2012, Tarantino could do pretty much whatever he wanted, with whoever he wanted, regardless of how commercial the project’s potential was or wasn’t.\n\nThis meant a Western starring Jamie Foxx, Leonardo Dicaprio, and Kerry Washington (on the cusp of her Scandal breakout role) wasn’t just on the cards but was given a large budget.\n\nDjango Unchained follows a freed slave who teams up with a German bounty hunter to rescue his wife from a ruthless Mississippi plantation owner.\n\n9. The Hateful Eight (2015)\n\nTarantino was truly in his Western era in the 2010s, and that continued with The Hateful Eight, one of his most self-indulgent films, for better or worse.\n\nComprised of long stretches of dialogue set in a snowed-in Wyoming cabin, Samuel L. Jackson leads a star-studded cast in this mostly one-location thriller.\n\n10. Once Upon a Time in Hollywood (2019)\n\nOnce Upon a Time in Hollywood is Tarantino’s revisionist history take on the Manson murders.\n\nUsed as a backdrop, the infamous tragedy sets the stage for the director to explore the changing tides of cinema, and the washed-up characters left in its wake.\n\nAlthough he still cast the usual suspects for the project, Dicaprio and Pitt included, he also used a slew of younger stars from the next generation down, such as Margaret Qualley, Dakota Fanning, and Margot Robbie as Sharon Tate.\n\nQuentin Tarantino movies in chronological order\n\nTo watch Tarantino’s movies chronologically, start with Django Unchained, which is set in 1858.\n\nQuentin Tarantino movies in chronological order:\n\nDjango Unchained: set in 1858\n\nThe Hateful Eight: set in 1877\n\nInglourious Basterds: set in 1941–1944\n\nOnce Upon A Time In Hollywood: set in 1969\n\nPulp Fiction: set in the 90s\n\nReservoir Dogs: set in 1992\n\nJackie Brown: set in 1995\n\nKill Bill: Volume 1: set in 1999\n\nKill Bill: Volume 2: set in 2003\n\nDeathproof: set in 2007\n\nWhat are the Quentin Tarantino movies he didn’t direct?\n\nTarantino worked on but did not direct True Romance, Natural Born Killers, From Dusk Till Dawn, and Planet Terror.\n\nMovies Tarantino worked on but did not solo-direct:\n\nTrue Romance (1993): writer\n\nNatural Born Killers (1994): story treatment\n\nFour Rooms (1995): vignette di\n\nFrom Dusk Till Dawn (1996): writer\n\nSin City (2005): guest director for one scene\n\nGrindhouse: Planet Terror (2007): producer\n\nAre Quentin Tarantino’s movies connected?\n\nTarantino said some of his movies share the same universe. However, they don’t follow a sensical timeline or connect in the same way other movie universes do.\n\nIn 2016, Tarantino said (somewhat confusingly), “There’s the ‘Realer Than Real’ universe, and all the characters inhabit that one. But then there’s this ‘Movie’ universe.\n\n“So, From Dusk Till Dawn, Kill Bill, they all take place in this special Movie universe. When the characters of Reservoir Dogs or Pulp Fiction go to the movies, Kill Bill is what they go to see, From Dusk Till Dawn is what they see.”\n\nBasically, Tarantino views his stories of murderous brides, vampires, and grindhouse flicks as the kind of thing you’d find in a cinema in his fictional universe. Meanwhile, stories like Reservoir Dogs, True Romance, and Inglorious Basterds are Tarantino’s version of the real world.\n\nThere is also a strong theory that characters such as Vic Vega (Reservoir Dogs) and Vincent Vega (Pulp Fiction), Pete Hicox (The Hateful Eight) and Archie Hicox (Inglourious Basterds), and Lee Donowitz (True Romance) and Donny Donowitz (Inglourious Basterds) are related to one another.\n\nThe Realer Than Real Universe:\n\nMy Best Friend’s Birthday\n\nReservoir Dogs\n\nTrue Romance\n\nNatural Born Killers\n\nPulp Fiction\n\nJackie Brown\n\nInglorious Basterds\n\nDjango Unchained\n\nThe Hateful Eight\n\nOnce Upon a Time in Hollywood\n\nThe Movie Universe:\n\nFrom Dusk Till Dawn\n\nFrom Dusk Till Dawn 2: Texas Blood Money\n\nFrom Dusk Till Dawn 3: The Hangman’s Daughter\n\nKill Bill: Volume 1\n\nKill Bill: Volume 2\n\nGrindhouse: Death Proof\n\nGrindhouse: Planet Terror\n\nWhat is Quentin Tarantino’s next movie?\n\nQuentin Tarantino’s next movie is unknown following the reports his in-development film The Movie Critic has been scrapped.\n\nTarantino scrapped The Movie Critic because he couldn’t land on the right story he wanted to tell, as first reported by Deadline.\n\nIt was going to be about a critic in 1970s California who reviews mainstream movies for an adult magazine called The Popstar Pages, with Brad Pitt set to star.\n\nWith controversy surrounding Pitt due to abuse allegations and Tarantino’s artistic process perhaps strained by the pressure and finality of a final film to bookend his career, it’s being said that he’s coming up with a new idea."
