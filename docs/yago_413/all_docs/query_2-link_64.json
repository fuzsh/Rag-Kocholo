Also I’m pretty sure in Nation’s Pride, the yank who says “I implore you - we must destroy that tower!” is Quentin’s voice with an accent.\n\n[quote=“G”][quote=“RatQuiRit”]Maybe it was just rumors.

Crazy Kenneth”]where was Castellari?[/quote]\n\nI was wondering the same thing, and where was Bo Svenson.[/quote]\n\nI think Castellari can be seen behind Brad Pitt during the I-talion scene. Bo Svenson’s in Nation’s Pride - “We have to destroy that tower!”\n\n[quote=“G”][quote=“RatQuiRit”]Maybe it was just rumors.

Though you are right.\n\nJust saw the movie for the first time and I also wondered where QT cameo was. I have to watch it again to see that nazi scalped thing. Oh and yeah I also looked for Enzo Casteliari but didn’t saw him.\n\nI just read something interesting:\n\nIn the scene where Col. Landa (Christoph Waltz) strangles Bridget von Hammersmark (Diane Kruger), the hands doing the strangling are those of Quentin Tarantino.\n\nENZO G. CASTELLARI’s CAMEO in the movie:\n\nHe’s right in the background in the scene where Christoph Waltz meets Diane Krüger with Brad Pitt&Co for the first time after (minor SPOILER:) he found out that she works for the Allies.\n\nIn one shot, even though out of focus, he’s also right in the middle of the screen, framed by Waltz and Krüger."
