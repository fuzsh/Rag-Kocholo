I have a feeling, by the time this year is over, we will all have seen\n\nMy Best Friend’s Birthday.\n\nThere’s screenshots and other info at *********\n\n[NOTE FROM THE ADMIN: please no advertising for commercial sites.\n\nyou can get the adress i censored if you contact through instant messenger or email.]\n\nSebastian, have you see MBFB?\n\nI know what site it is. I already ordered it.\n\nHow old is this news? God, I am so behind.\n\nyou can order the unfinished film at\n\nwww.superhappyfun.com\n\neither on VHS or DVD-R\n\nand yes, it is legal.\n\nPlease send in your reviews, thoughts or whatever.\n\nI just watched it (or at least whats existing footage) and I think its awesome!\n\nQT practically plays his character Clarence from TR, including the “i’d fuck elvis” speech.\n\nits a great little film, although the quality is totally bad and its not finished at all (i’d say 1/3 of the film is complete, if that).\n\n[quote]I just watched it (or at least whats existing footage) and I think its awesome!\n\nQT practically plays his character Clarence from TR, including the “i’d fuck elvis” speech.\n\nits a great little film, although the quality is totally bad and its not finished at all (i’d say 1/3 of the film is complete, if that).\n\n[/quote]\n\nI was wonderin' if you, or anybody else who owns the movie for that matter, would be willing to submit a transcript from \"My Best Friend's Birthday\" for the site. That'd be awesome for those of us who don't own the flick or, in my case, don't have, to quote Dick Ritchie in T.R., \"A pot to piss in or a window to throw it out of\", rendering me unable to produced a measly 20 or so bucks to order the movie from SuperHappyFun. It's a poor-pathetic life bein' broke. Anyway, just a request/suggestion on behalf of those who would enjoy such a thing. Later.\n\nM.W.\n\nI updated the Site (filmographies → my best friends birthday) with a nice photogallery for easier downloading.\n\nif you want to buy it on VHS or DVD-R go to www.superhappyfun.com\n\nif you want to know more about the film itself i recommend the book by Jami Bernard (there’s a huge link to a description on the main page). really insight information in that book. i read it twice and will read it again.\n\nPlease.\n\nIf somebody bought that from www.superhappyfun.com on DVD-R, please SHARE IT on kazaa or whatever… my VHS copy got fucked up!\n\nor send me a copy on CD!"
