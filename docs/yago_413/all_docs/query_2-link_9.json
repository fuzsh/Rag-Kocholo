        "text": "This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now. Have an account? .\n\nQuentin Tarantino has made 12 cameos in his career.\n\nSix of those cameos came in his own films, with five being physical appearances plus one as a narrator.\n\nHe has also cameoed in other movies and TV shows, such as \"The Golden Girls\" and his friend Robert Rodriguez's \"Desperado.\"\n\nVisit Insider's homepage for more stories.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n'The Golden Girls' (1988)\n\nTarantino managed to get a small cameo as an Elvis impersonator on an episode of \"The Golden Girls\" just as he was starting out in Hollywood.\n\nIn the episode, he plays one of many Elvis impersonators — if you look closely you can see Tarantino center-left in the beige suit, just behind and to the left of the impersonator with the guitar.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n'Reservoir Dogs' (1992)\n\nThis was Tarantino's first real cameo — with actual lines. And it started off a series of appearances in his own films that could be argued are 'small roles' rather than actual cameos.\n\nIn \"Reservoir Dogs,\" Tarantino plays Mr. Brown, who delivers a classic pop-culture-inspired Tarantino speech about his interpretation of Madonna's \"Like a Virgin,\" before (spoiler) his untimely demise.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n'Pulp Fiction' (1994)\n\nTarantino was nominated for best director for \"Pulp Fiction\" and won best original screenplay for the film, but he also acted in it, too, as Jimmie — the guy whose house Jules and Vincent clean up a murder in with the help of Mr. Wolf.\n\nTarantino originally considered playing Lance, the character who assists Vincent resuscitating Mia, but he eventually decided he wanted to be solely behind the camera for Mia's overdose scene.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n'Desperado' (1995)\n\nTarantino pops up in this sequel to \"El Mariachi,\" directed by his friend Robert Rodriguez. In his brief scene, Tarantino seems to sport some sort of Mexican accent in his first couple of lines before speaking in his normal voice and telling a joke about a bartender and urination.\n\nThe scene, unsurprisingly, ends with blood.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n'Girl 6' (1996)\n\nThis cameo, in retrospect, seems curious as Spike Lee and Tarantino have a long-standing feud that was sparked in 1997 after Lee criticised Tarantino's use of the N-word, which Lee thought was excessive, in Tarantino's film \"Jackie Brown.\"\n\nSince then, Lee has boycotted \"Django Unchained\" while Tarantino vowed never to work with Lee again. This cameo in Spike Lee's \"Girl 6,\" in which Tarantino plays a film director, is the only time they worked together.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n'Little Nicky' (2000)\n\nTarantino played an eccentric, blind preacher in this Adam Sandler comedy, and appeared in several slapstick-laden scenes in which his character can sense Nicky is from hell and gets himself into more and more accidents.\n\nIt's a cameo very suited to the film, and Tarantino clearly gives it his all.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n'The Muppets' Wizard of Oz!' (2005)\n\nThe Muppets' movies always have cameos and celebrity appearances in them, and Tarantino played himself in \"The Muppets' Wizard of Oz.\" In his scene, he pitches some rather unsuitable suggestions to Kermit the Frog for the climax of their \"Wizard of Oz\" production, including samurai sword fights, Japanese anime, and blood baths.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n'Death Proof' (2007)\n\nTarantino played Warren, a bar-owner, in \"Death Proof,\" his least-discussed film.\n\nAccording to Eli Roth, Tarantino actually drank real shots in his scenes and ordered the rest of the cast to do so, too, in order to make the scene look and feel more realistic.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n'Sukiyaki Western Django' (2007)\n\n\"Django Unchained\" wasn't the first Django Tarantino appeared in. It was actually Takashi Miike's very camp 2007 film \"Sukiyaki Western Django,\" the title of which is a play on the genre \"spaghetti western.\"\n\n\"Sukiyaki\" is a Japanese dish served with noodles. In his cameo, Tarantino plays an ageing gunslinger and cuts an egg out of a snake in the opening scene — which is actually one of the least bizarre moments of the movie.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n'Inglourious Basterds' (2009)\n\nTarantino appears twice in \"Inglourious Basterds.\" He appears later in the film as an American GI in the film-within-the-film \"Nation's Pride.\"\n\nIn it, he faces away from the camera and says, \"Colonel, I implore you.\"\n\nHis more noticeable cameo comes earlier in the film as a german soldier getting scalped by the bastards.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n'Django Unchained' (2012)\n\nTarantino's character in this Django film is much less capable than the one in Miike's movie. Here, he plays an Australian miner transporting Jamie Foxx's Django.\n\nNot only is his character pretty incapable (he gets duped by Django and then blown up by his own dynamite), but the director also proves himself to be incapable of an Australian accent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n'The Hateful Eight' (2015)\n\nTechnically, this may not count as a cameo since he doesn't actually appear on the screen.\n\nBut it was still a surprise to hear Tarantino's unmistakable voice pop up halfway through the film in between the first and second acts. Tarantino explains that the audience has missed something crucial during the preceding shoot-out: someone poisoned the coffee.\n\nRead more:\n\nQuentin Tarantino said he's fighting 'a war for movies' against Marvel, 'Star Wars,' and James Bond\n\nThe director of 'Independence Day' says Quentin Tarantino's strict 'no phones' policy could cause more problems than it's worth\n\n4 pieces of modern technology that Quentin Tarantino refuses to use, from email to Netflix\n\nRead next\n\nAdvertisement"
