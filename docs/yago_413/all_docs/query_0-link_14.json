        "text": "(after snorting itching powder) \"AAAAHHH! I AM IN HELL!\" - Clarence\n\nAs much as this is a prequel/original movie to True Romance, this feels like Tarantino's Clerks.\n\nIt's an amateur production made by amateur film-makers and amateur actors, but that's all part of the charm. Personally, I enjoy Tarantino's particular brand of acting; that fast-talking, smug movie-expert wannabee. His character is essentially Christian Slater from True Romance, and it was a real pleasure to hear him resite his own dialogue that we saw 6 years later and put his own spin on it.\n\nAlso, there's some crazy stuff that happens here:\n\n- Tarantino talks about committing suicide when he was 3 years old, and his salvation being The Partridge Family.…\n\n- where is she?\n\n- who?\n\n- the girl with the asshole\n\n- there's girls without assholes?\n\nThis is just a student film and only half of a student film actually because the rest of it was lost but it is still great.\n\nTarantino has made one of the best student films i have seen and he didnt even went to film school.\n\nLike most student films it had it’s flaws: the music was too loud, most of the acting sucked and the movie was just a bit silly at times. Still it had good writing, both the story and the dialogue was interesting and actually pretty funny. This proved to me that Tarantino is great at comedy even though…\n\nAction! – Three Auteurs: DJ Tarantino & The Cinephiles Squad\n\nSo as we wrapped up our first auteur David Fincher, we are moving on with the bro among all the film bros, Quentin Tarantino, as we explore the man's work with a few exceptions as always. So let's not wait any second and lets talk about this little short film...\n\nAnd where do one begin? How about the fact that this was made in 87 but it feels like an underground 60s project including questionable acting, head-scratching scenes and running gags and an overall script that doesn’t even feel like something the writer/director would come up with. There are talks about movies, there are unreasonable amount of swearing, there are some…\n\nQuentin Tarantino-Community-Weekend\n\nTarantino Rewatch: Bonus Chapter 1\n\nWith a budget of only $ 5,000, My Best Friend's Birthday is Quentin Tarantino's actual directorial debut, but it was never completed and therefore never officially released. I have now completely looked at the remaining 36 minutes of this work for the first time, after having seen a few excerpts here and there, and it is somehow difficult for me to finally rate the result.\n\nOn the one hand, of course, I have the Tarantino fan glasses on and, on the other hand, the film is immature and incomplete, plus the fact that the available quality is pretty bad. Nevertheless, it is interesting to take a look at this early work, because the…\n\nYour ass is grass, and I'm the lawnmower!\n\nVery weird to rate this, much less review it, so I'm just going to go along with what feels right and honest. Almost humbling to see that even Tarantino was at some point incompetent. If anything, this helped solidify to me a part of the magic that comes to Quentin's films and what makes them so good: It's not just his dialogue, it's how the dialogue is presented and spoken. When you give solid writing to someone with, uh, less than solid acting abilities, you're going to get less than stellar results. Add incredibly choppy editing, and it is hard to really call this a \"film\" at all. My Best Friend's Birthday…\n\nMickey’s girlfriend dumps him, and his friend Clarence arranges for a sex worker to entertain him on his birthday. An interconnected story concerning relationships and a psychotic pimp unravels.\n\nThe first film by Quentin Tarantino. Produced on a micro budget by amateur filmmakers using borrowed equipment. This film was notoriously cobbled together from the remaining footage, following a fire at the processing lab. This perfect storm of circumstances results in a disjointed, unfocused, choppy and cheap ‘student’ film - though it’s frankly amazing that anything coherent has been assembled at all.\n\nFlourishes and sensibilities which would help to define Tarantino’s work are evident in this film - the slick dialogue loaded with pop culture references, overlapping exchanges, charismatic lowlives, the…"
