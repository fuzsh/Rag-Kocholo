        "text": "Parvathamma Rajkumar (6 December 1939 â€“ 31 May 2017) was an Indian film producer and distributor. She was the wife of Veteran Kannada actor Rajkumar. She produced successful films featuring Rajkumar and their sons Shiv Rajkumar, Puneeth Rajkumar and Raghavendra Rajkumar under the production house named \"Poornima Enterprises\". Actresses who found fame in her productions include Malashri, Prema, Rakshita, Sudha Rani and Ramya. She was awarded with a doctorate from Bangalore University.\n\nAmongst the awards she has received are the Phalke Academy award, Kannada Rajyotsava and a lifetime achievement award from the Government of Karnataka. By 2012, she had produced 80 films. She has spoken in defence of Kannadigas, regarding Karnataka's position in interstate water disputes and against infringement of the Kannada film industry's works.\n\nShe established a family firm for film production called Sri Vajreshwari Combines or Poornima enterprises. The first movie she produced was Trimurthi with her husband in a lead role; Trimurthi was a great success. Her brothers S.A. Chinne Gowda, S.A. Govindaraj, and S.A. Srinivas are also film producers.\n\nShe has produced over 80 films and launched her three sons as film stars. Her most successful films with her husband in a lead role include Trimurthy, Haalu Jenu, Kaviratna Kalidasa and Jeevana Chaitra. She produced Anand, Om, Janumada Jodi and several other movies with her older son Shiv Rajkumar in lead role. Her son Raghavendra Rajkumar played the lead in Chiranjeevi Sudhakar, Nanjundi Kalyana, Swasthik and Tuvvi Tuvvi Tuvvi. Her youngest son Puneeth starred in Appu, Abhi and Hudugaru.\n\nParvathamma was born in Saligrama of Mysore district of the erstwhile Kingdom of Mysore on 6 December 1939 to Appaji Gowda and Lakshmamma, as the second of eight children. Singanallur Puttaswamaiah, her future father-in-law, placed a silver coin in her cradle and allegedly vowed to make her his daughter-in-law. Aged 14, she married his son Rajkumar on 25 June 1953. They have five children together: sons Shiva, Raghavendra and Puneeth, and daughters Lakshmi and Poornima. Rajkumar died on 12 April 2006 of cardiac arrest.\n\nParvathamma was taken to MS Ramaiah Memorial Hospital on 14 May 2017 to treat her for weakness. On 17 May, she was shifted to the intensive care unit after she had difficulty in breathing and was on assisted ventilation, following which a tracheotomy was performed on her to ease breathing. Also, she had developed metastasis despite having been treated for a malignancy a few years previously. She had a cardiac arrest at 4:30 a.m. (IST) on 31 May 2017. Efforts to revive her failed and she was pronounced dead at 4:40 a.m. (IST). It was reported that \"malignancy had spread to the lungs and liver\"."
