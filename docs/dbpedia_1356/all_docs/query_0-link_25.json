        "text": "Sylvian Patrick\n\n·\n\nFollow\n\nPublished in\n\nSylvianism\n\n·\n\n4 min read\n\n·\n\nMar 6, 2014\n\n--\n\nWhen “The Artist” was hailed as an experiment and glorified three years back, I had a tinge of anger and a sense of pride that our Indian cinema tried this 24 years back. In fact, Pesum Padam took the contemporary milieu and gave the silent spin to it. That’s why it’s on our list\n\nPesum Padam (1987)\n\nPesum Padam is a story of a young jobless graduate (Kamal Hassan) who could less than afford a complete meal in a day. He chances upon a drunk millionaire (Sameer Khakkar). He kidnaps the millionaire and takes his place to live a luxurious life at a star hotel named “Pushpak”. He meets a young girl (Amala) who stays in his room and both fall in love. On the other hand, a hired killer (Tinu Anand) who wants to kill the millionaire tries to kill Kamal mistaking him for the millionaire. The rest of the story forms what happens to the life of that jobless guy and his sweet silent love story.\n\nThe movie is a satirical black comedy that takes a potshot at the attitude of an ordinary man who takes advantage of a situation he is in.\n\nWhy is it special?\n\nThe movie is silent. No dialogues whatsoever. And the film solely relies on the acting talents of actors and background score\n\nThe brilliant acting of every actor in the movie especially the lead protagonists — Kamal and Amala.\n\nAlmost a near perfect screenplay as the scenes need to be conceived to make sure that people need not speak out. The characters don’t speak sign language. They only emote without words.\n\nA brilliant score by L Vaidyanathan that carries the movie. If not for the music, this movie would have become a vain attempt\n\nThe cinematography (Gowri Shankar) and art direction (Thotta Tharani) that enabled the film to be without dialogues. The movie relies on the camera work especially the framing and the planning behind the composition of scenes is so perfect.\n\nWhy is it on the list?\n\nFor trying to bring back the silent era in cinema.\n\nFor the vision of Singeetham Sreenivasa Rao who wrote, directed and co-produced the movie with his friend Shringar Nagaraj\n\nAlthough it can’t be considered as a Tamil movie technically, I still had to put this on the list for the vision and innovation. It was a true “Indian” movie — there is at least one technician/actor is involved from significant movie industries in India (except for Bengali).\n\nTrivia\n\nThe movie was released in 5 “languages” — they changed only the titles, but separate censor certificates were obtained for individual languages. It was called Pushpak in Hindi, Pushpaka Vimana in Kannada, Pushpaka Vimanamu in Telugu and Pushpaka Vimanam in Malayalam.\n\nThe hotel called Pushpak in the movie was Windsor Manor in Bangalore now owned by ITC.\n\nPushpak (Hindi) won the National Award for Best Popular Film in 1988\n\nThe movie was lauded by critics and was screened in the Cannes (don’t know the details correctly). It is still making rounds in film festivals — last year it was taken to Shanghai Film Festival\n\nSingeetham Sreenivasa Rao was arguably the most successful collaborator with Kamal Hassan — Raja Paarvai, Aboorva Sagotharargal, Michael Madana Kamarajan, Magalir Mattum, Kadhala Kadhala and Mumbai Express.\n\nL Vaidyanathan composed music for more than 170 films, but we got only a few movies to his credit in Tamil. Probably, the most famous one was Ezhavathu Manithan — which had just Bharathiyar songs. He was the elder brother of L Subramaniam and L Shankar. He started his career as an assistant to GK Venkatesh — (now you understand where I am coming to) — he was a close friend of Ilaiyaraaja. Ilaiyaraaja whenever talks about L Vaidyanathan reminisces about his days in their house and how L Vaidyanathan’s mother used to take care of him like her children. Probably, the most enduring legacy of L Vaidyanathan is that he scored the theme music of Malgudi Days.\n\nThe movie won many awards — it opened at the International Film Festival of India, was part of the Critics’ Week at the Cannes and won the National award for wholesome entertainment.\n\nFinally, if you think if this movie made any money, the movie ran successfully for 100 days with a wonderful reception from the audience. Kamal recently quipped that they spent only Rs.35 Lakhs for the whole movie while he was spending the same amount every day on the sets of Vishwaroopam\n\nYouTube link to the movie"
