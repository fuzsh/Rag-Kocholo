With the world accelerating towards a deadline of being less carbon-dependent by 2050, India, on the other hand, has vouched for the same by 2070. The efforts need celebration, but the extension of almost two decades has been where the country has not focused on a holistic perspective when it comes to inclusive and sustainable development. In the current era, the challenges are immense and the raging effects of global warming and climate change having negative repercussions with the onslaught of newer disease outbreaks brought on by global warming will only imperil India’s focus in the coming years ahead. We have witnessed the spread of Covid-19 and its disastrous consequences on the social life as well as economic consequences, and also the current war between Russia and Ukraine which had a major impact on economic, social and ecological security. Governments seem to have lost vision in the current atmosphere with their limited aim of growth as only being economics forgetting that in the 21st century, growth is less about economics but ecological sustainability. The fundamental questions all stakeholders from policy makers to industry and education need to ask is how are they sensitized towards creating an inter-generational equity and a fair distribution of resources equally for all without inhibiting anyone’s progress to live in a socially resilient and fair world. This chapter aims to discuss global policies that will influence countries and the policies that governments must work towards being enabler of change for a cleaner, low-carbon environment with the necessary stop-gaps. The policies that Global South countries must work towards despite exacerbating poverty, lack of resources and agrarian distress with the influx of new-age emergent technologies to cushion the inevitable crisis we have pushed ourselves to where the outcomes could be disastrous with no returns.\n\nKEYWORDS Policies; Emergent Technologies; Ecological Protection; Global Warming; Poverty Alleviation\n\n1.1 INTRODUCTION India is at the ­cross-​­roads on the R ­ ussia-​­Ukraine crisis due to its heavy dependence on fossil fuels. Though the country may be experimenting with alternate sources of energy, that still remains in the making as formidability and familiarity do not remain anywhere in the near horizon. India imports a significant percentage of its crude oil from Russia and relies more on Russia for military hardware DOI: 10.1201/9781003331117-1\n\n1\n\n2\n\nIoT and Analytics in Renewable Energy Systems (Volume 1)\n\nand defence technologies but still remains the world’s second largest importer of crude oil. India’s oil import requirement was 85.5% in ­2021–​­2022, whereas in ­2020–​­2021, its requirement was 84.4% of its crude oil. This specifically speaks about the volume of oil importation and equally in the current era where opportunities can be created in greening the economy. It is here that governments working with global policy makers must work on fresh policies to strategically tackle global warming and climate change challenges by shifting to alternate sources of fuel and harvesting emergent technologies to create a sustainable and inclusive planet. In the past decade, there have been many changes to India’s buying oil. A country like India that is pivoted to be the most populated country in the world by 2023 has some serious challenges from education, healthcare to employment and accessibility to resources. The primary reason is that majority of India’s populace come from the bottom and middle of the economic pyramid. It is a definite challenge fighting for resources for a sustainable and inclusive ecosystem. India, with its growing population, is driven by its heavy dependence on energy. Businesses, healthcare facilities and the entire gamut of services in the formal and informal sector are engineered and driven by energy. In fact, a few trends in the recent past reveal India’s demand for energy. Iraq, Saudi Arabia and UAE are the leading sources of crude oil imports for India. Iraq emerged as the leading exporter of crude oil to India in recent years, replacing Saudi Arabia. Some other nations, which exported crude oil to India over the years, are as follows:\n\ni. UAE has in the last 4 years emerged as the third major exporter of crude oil to India. It was among the top five countries earlier. Kuwait remains to be one of India’s biggest suppliers as well. ii. ­Latin-​­American country Venezuela was among the leading exporters of crude oil to India. iii. Mexico has emerged as a leading exporter of crude oil among the ­ Latin-​­ American countries. iv. Nigeria continues to be a leading exporter to India; the share of imports from Angola has reduced in recent years. v. Iran was among the top three countries from which India imported crude oil until 2­ 018–​ ­2019. India stopped importing crude from Iran in 2019 onwards due to a­ lliance-​­building efforts with the USA in clamping down on Iran on uranium enrichment. vi. The USA remains India’s prominent supplier of crude oil. In fact, the countries Iraq, Saudi Arabia and UAE make up 63% of the total value of crude oil imports to India.\n\nHowever, it is only in ­2021–​­2022 do we see Brazil and Russia being the leading countries to supply crude oil to India. As the third largest consumer of oil in the world, India’s consumption is that of 5% of the global consumption. When we analyse these facts, we realize that India faces greater troubles in the energy sector and the solutions should be immediate as its is a developing country and requires greater policy insight to address a difficult scenario due to the growing population and traffic congestion on roads that indirectly affect the growth of its economy. Today, due to its population and its heavy reliance on fossil ­fuel-​­based electricity, India remains the third largest electricity producer in the world with 1,393 TWh generation in FY 2­ 019–​­2020, and almost 99.99% of the population have access to power supply. Even on the dependence on electricity, India has surpassed China and Russia with electric grids having an installed capacity of 399.470 GW as of 31 March 2022. Renewable energy plants, which include large hydroelectric plants, constitute 38.2% of total installed capacity. The energy sector in India is strengthened by fossil fuels such as coal, which make up the largest percentage of India’s energy needs. Though the government has come up with plans of d­ e-​­commissioning ­coal-​­powered plants, coal remains India’s bedrock for generation of energy. With the ratification of the Paris Climate Accord, India being an unwilling partner to transition its economy to an economy of low carbon by 2050 has made a promise of becoming a totally l­ow-​­carbon country by 2070. It is to be observed that India aims to transform almost 50% of its economy by relying on ­non-​­fossils or alternate sources of\n\nPolicies for a Sustainable Energy-Dependent India\n\n3\n\nenergy by 2030 with the International Energy Agency briefly estimating that due to India’s population, the increase of an additional 1,200 GW seems evident where this amount is more than what the European Union had utilized in 2005. The demand for cooling too is increasing tremendously. It has always remained a big challenge for India to shift to electricity, as the country in the early days relied on firewood, cow dung and agricultural waste. These traditional uses of fuels were found to be highly toxic and carcinogenic, not only causing illness but also affecting air quality. The particulate matter such as NOX, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (­PAHs), carbon monoxide, formaldehyde and other pollutants poses a severe threat to health of individuals and damage to the environment. The World Health Organization asserts that almost more than 400,000 people die or suffer health hazards due to inhaling indoor pollution caused by traditional sources of fuel, further leading to climate change and damage to forests and ecosystems. With newer policies being framed did the governments realize the dangers and shifted slowly to electricity or combustion technologies or clean burning fuel, creating a more sustainable alternative to traditional burning of fuel. Another primary cause for individual cases of disease is the inability to treat sewage, being a primary reason for pollution of surface and groundwater. The major sewage treatment plants in India that are owned by the government are not operational many times. It is these unfiltered wastes that remain stagnant and flood urban areas releasing contaminated particles into the groundwater. Had India have effective policies to address the water pollution and environmental issues with a full onslaught of electricity supply, a few of India’s ­socio-​ ­economic and environmental problems may remain a myth but we find them becoming an unnecessary hazard to contend with. A large country like India must not only have electricity supply round the clock to guarantee its economy is running, but it is also equally important to ensure that water woes, sewage treatment plants and pollution monitoring sites have a ­full-​­scale supply of electricity. India as an emerging economy with deepening infrastructure drive by policymakers, accelerating exports and cost of living going up makes it more challenging for the citizen with the hunger for more coal as shifting to alternate sources of fuel is not anywhere close in the horizon. With our current energy needs only growing with the current statistic of 4.7 times every year for the next two decades speaks of population explosion and the demand for energy for household appliances and a growing economy that seems to be faltering in comparison to the richer countries. Though policy makers are working for ­long-​­term securities in energy supply with environmental and economic needs, providing uninterrupted supply remains a Herculean task. An economy that is playing catch up with the rich countries and our competitors is scaling up employment opportunities, developing ­ ulti-​­lateral automobile makers vying to get human skill for jobs, and manufacturing abilities with m a percentage of the India clientele and to elevate their profit margins. There have been challenges in attracting international investment in domestic hydrocarbon as NELP failed to incentivize large international energy corporations. In this particular area, India will have to work hard to acquire hydrocarbon reserves abroad. India endeavoured to invest in countries like France and the USA by acquiring nuclear reactors to fuel domestic power plants and ensuring access to critical technologies but failed due to logistic and economic issues in setting up ­foreign-​­built nuclear reactors. It has also been reported that a large percentage (­307 million Indians) do not have access to electricity and an even larger percentage (­505 million Indians) are still dependent on biomass. We need policies in infrastructure development and skill that battles macrocosmic external issues, e.g. the ­Indo-​­USA nuclearization deal, import of oil from the Gulf countries or the Middle East. In the current times due to skirmishes among India’s energy partners, e.g. America and Iran, India has had to diminish oil imports or trading with Iran.\n\n1.2 THE NEED FOR POLICIES ON ALTERNATE SOURCES OF ENERGY TO POWER INDIA’S ECONOMY India faces strategic challenges to meet its energy needs and lacks policies to shift to alternate sources of energy, which is the need of the hour. China’s One Belt, One Road initiative has given the country the due fillip in disturbing India’s access to energy. It is primarily for this reason that\n\n4\n\nIoT and Analytics in Renewable Energy Systems (Volume 1)\n\nwe should shift to alternate sources of energy or n­ on-​­renewable sources like solar, wind and cleaner fuels. In this way, pollution can be curbed, our cities and towns can be cleaner and greener, and we can easily accomplish the ratification of a truly l­ow-​­carbon economy by 2070, though we were asked to commit to 2050. The policies that India needs to focus on also require constant innovation and foster dialogue with our alliance partners, as all countries have to work with each other to accomplish a n­ et-​­zero emissions and to decelerate global warming and climate change. Policy makers have to analyse that India’s energy security is fragile and under immense pressure due to its dependence on fossil fuels that are imported, international monopolies, opaque pricing policies and regulatory uncertainty. India’s policy makers measures to amplify energy security by changing to clean energy, consistent policies require the country to sustain the momentum especially where one of its biggest policies is guaranteeing electricity to every city and remote part of the country by the end of 2022. Though work has been initiated, and almost half of India’s villages today receive electricity and the others have more ground to cover, the outcome is yet to be studied as supplying electricity on a ­round-­​­­the-​­clock basis will not only prove costly but a colossal challenge. A few policies that are being worked out are as follows: i. Installation of biomass pelletizing units. ii. Distribution of ‘­efficient biomass chullahs’. iii. Distribution of solar irrigation pumps and being financed through NABARD and government financial support. iv. Alternate ­non-​­conventional energy sources need to be explored to make them accessible and technologically economical like tidal or geothermal energy. v. The NMEEE (­National Mission for Enhanced Energy Efficiency) has a tremendous responsibility to organize a comprehensive cost analysis of the accessible efficient technologies and technological products in a diversified ecosystem, especially in healthcare, housing, agriculture and transportation. vi. Policy makers have to ensure at the state or national level that they should reach out to personnel and engineers to ensure that energy efficiency and standards and regulatory practices are nimble and remain well established with constant checks and balances. In this way, the informal sector has opportunities to grow and more employment opportunities can be created, reducing economic pressures. vii. The ­auto-​­fuel efficiency should be constantly upgraded for cleaner, greener and sustainable planet. viii. Solar Energy Corporation of India Limited aims to grow and develop storage solutions to bring down prices through demand aggregation. The temporary solution will be for India to increase its dependence on coal and disincentivize investment on imports. Policy makers should have a clear understanding of regulatory clearances and have to ensure that they work towards improving labour productivity in order to increase coal manufacture and develop efficiency of distribution before phasing out coal and simultaneously drafting newer policies and finding solutions as India invests on renewable energy. As of now, the Hydrocarbon Exploration and Licensing aims to offer policy makers leeway in decision making with discretion, diminish administrative or bureaucratic struggles, reduce delays and encourage the idea of revenue sharing and freedom of marketing and motivating its citizenry to shift to alternate sources of energy by reducing a portion of tax for its payees. We have witnessed with the ­Russia-​­Ukraine war that policy makers are in no uncertain terms waking up to the reality of being ­energy-​­dependent discussing new tax structure in the sale of energy and import to enhance the competitive aspect of the economy. The challenges and struggles with demand getting hoarse for the world to be low carbon or no carbon by 2050 and 2070, the India Energy Security Scenarios is proposed to effectively address energy concerns from coal to renewable energy. With new digital tools being developed to study and analyse for future policies on diversifying energy demand and\n\nPolicies for a Sustainable Energy-Dependent India\n\n5\n\nsupply that will resolve energy conundrums with the demand growing due to population pressure and employment creation in the informal and formal sector. The Energy Security Scenario analyzes and explores India’s energy scenario in supply sectors such that all includes all fuel generation ecosystems to suit demands accordingly. The new digital framework and tools make allowance for interactions from an individual level to a societal and industrial level to make prudent energy choices, and to discover a vast or ­multi-​­dimensional gradient of results for the ­country – ​­from carbon emissions and imports reliance to land utilization. India has established energy relationships with Myanmar, Vietnam and Gulf countries. The ­Indo-​­US Nuclear Deal opens up energy opportunities in nuclear energy facilitated through advanced technology and nuclear fuel. With the demand more like a clarion call, India has sought to engage with Australia and China.\n\n1.3 CONCLUSION There is a growing clamour in Global South countries in energy and security due to existing economic and social conditions where we are witnessing significant energy transformations from complete electrification to a paradigmatic shift to renewable energy with severe disturbances due to the energy price rise in the globalization and increasing of prices of oil and natural gas. In the current era, policy makers in India have to realize that India needs to augment its research with skills construing innovatively to deal with constant alterations in the energy region. Though there remains much scope, we fail to see return on investment as carbon emissions are yet high and the only possible or viable solution will be when the aggressive push for renewables becomes a reality, which will help us ratifying the goal of 2070, i.e. a ­carbon-​­free world. Policy makers have to shift attention from ­short-​­term goals and aim for the future in a strategic, balanced manner, as the planet’s life is at stake and more significantly poor countries will have to confront the worst of it and endure the hardest struggles from economics to social improbabilities. It is time for renewables and emergent technologies to transform our energy sector with innovation at the heart of all energy policies.\n\nBIBLIOGRAPHY Barreto, L., 2001: Technological learning in energy optimisation models and deployment of emerging technologies.

So, whatever IoT devices we are using with some sort of protocols and parameters, we should be able to manage and know the measures and estimation of power consumption, interoperability, price forecasting, etc. One of the major constraints and possible challenges of IoT-SG is the security and uneven distribution of processing data from transmission lines, distribution substations, smart meters, and other sources. In the present era, smart grid IoT technologies are beneficial energy management solutions. It’s a two-way data interchange between networked gadgets and hardware that recognizes and responds to human wants. It’s also less expensive than the present power system. In this paper, we focus on how smart grid is an efficient way to estimate and manage energy efficiency and power demand, which will give a clear picture to the end users in an elaborate way.\n\nDOI: 10.1201/9781003331117-2\n\n7\n\n8\n\nIoT and Analytics in Renewable Energy Systems (Volume 1)\n\nKEYWORDS Internet of Things; Smart Grid; Interoperability; Data Analytics; Power Demand\n\n2.1 INTRODUCTION: GENERAL This paper reviews the solutions for challenges faced by the end users and consumers in ­power-​ ­based grids, namely, power quality and reliability. This paper focuses on advanced metering infrastructure (­AMI) technologies and smart meters (­SM) that enable the analyzing of the power grid by displaying a ­two-​­way communication scheme. Reference [1] gives the overview about the SMs and sweep the attainability of SM for power quality and reliability monitoring. It kickstarts with the wireless technology of SMs and such advanced communication techniques that enable AMI [1]. The main point of this article is to look at the smart grid’s communication necessities and to launch all IoT protocols and their standards. First, it covers the fundamentals of communication technologies, such as the Manufacturing Message Specification (­MMS) protocol in local area networks (­LANs) and Management Plane Protection (­MPP) in ­wide-​­area network (­WAN) will use this technique to ­ ulti-​­agent systems expose flaws of the practice, such as IoT protocol performance employing m (­MAS) and ­micro-​­grid. With the help of internet services, they analyze the data and display them on the dashboard, which is very ­cost-​­effective and caters to ­high-​­end communication requirements. Most importantly, in the case of security, they consider IoT protocol Quality of service (­QoS) [2]. This paper conveys that in order to make the I­ oT-​­based smart ­grid–​­enabled devices more efficient and reliable, ­high-​­quality uninterrupted electricity is needed. A cyberattack on IoT devices has the effect of bringing the energy grid to a halt. As we all know, the main difficulty with this approach is security, as the gadgets are all connected to the internet, leaving the smart grid vulnerable to catastrophic assaults. Due to the enormous number of nodes and domains in an I­ oT-​­SG, it has a broad attack surface for ­denial-­​­­of-​­service attacks. And, this leads to huge economic and financial losses [3]. In this paper, IoT is presented as the key application technology for the smart grid. Because SG is a data communications network connected to the power grid to acquire and analyze data from transmission lines, distribution substations, and customers, they’ve demonstrated the link between IoT and SG. Some IoT designs in Singapore are examined, as well as the requirements for IoT adoption, IoT applications, and services, as well as challenges and future developments [4]. This paper reviews the requirements and the role of IoT and SG for a smart city. Since there is a huge surge in IoT demand for communication between devices, energy and internet efficiency have become more important. So, by these kinds of vital requirements, many developed countries came up with their IoT projects. This summarizes the architecture for the smart city for the correct usage of infrastructure and to overcome the challenges faced by IoT. This paper also discusses about the economic issues faced while equipping smart city with basic communication [5]. This paper states the applications of IoT in smart grid with its challenges and solutions. The vast development of energy interfaced with IoT leads to smart electrical power grid which in turn increases the efficiency in power plants. This also talked about the I­oT-​­SG challenges regarding security and data issues, but has improved a new level with interoperability and such technical cases. Reference [6] focuses on the avenues where ­IoT-​­SG are deployed along with the key points on challenges faced in this process. This paper states the applications of IoT in smart grid with its challenges and solutions. The vast development of energy grid and with IoT leads to the electrical power grid which caused in a way that its technology increases the efficiency in power plants. This also talked about the I­ oT-​­SG challenges regarding security and data issues, but has improved a new level with interoperability and such technical cases. So, this patent focused on the investigation of ­IoT-​­SG and discussed the key points and challenges that lie ahead [7]. The I­ oT-​­based power regulating system for smart grid applications is the subject of this article. As we all know, IoT devices are used to analyze and regulate data as well as to provide effective power supply to the system. This system is able to capture the power used and analyze the electrical parameters. This paper also uses the “­­Things-​­speak” software\n\nA Review on Internet of Things with Smart Grid Technology\n\n9\n\nto obtain the ­real-​­time data used by the consumer and the source company, which is providing the power to reduce their billing costs. And, the consumers can be aware about the updated amount of power usage [8]. The aim of the paper is to minimize the costs of power usage along with smart energy management controlling the demand and supply side management. This trend follows reducing costs without implementing limits on consumption by instead choosing the reduction of power in the peak hours with the consumer’s preferences and to avoid a blackout. The above try makes the balance in the demand response side. The estimation of cost algorithm will be based on usage and time with sensory information from the end users [9]. This idea of the paper performs with the one of the fundamental demanding situations of IoT, i.e., security. In this paper, the threats and capacity answers of the IoT primarily based on totally clever grid are analyzed. As statistics and conversation technologies (­ICT) evolved and were carried out in conventional electricity systems, the development of clever grid ­cyber-­​­­physical-​­systems (­CPS) will increase too. They focus on cyberattack and make us understand the vulnerabilities and solutions to the problem and give us the next task of research with ­cyber-​­SG [10]. This paper reviews that the smart grid in the power system wants a proper utilization of energy usage and has a vital role. This is monitored and analyzed by the SMs. But these SMs have some problems to sort out. And one of them is no ­point-­​­­to-​­point interaction between devices. So these energy SMs control and survey with the help of WIFI module and calculate the energy usage. These collected data are then uploaded to the cloud, which will be utilized by the consumers. This finally conveys that this is a great step for IoT automation toward digital India [11]. This paper works with power quality management in wireless sensor network (­WSN) in smart grid technology. To get flow with efficiency and reliability, sufficient power supply should be defined. This patent reviews the grid sharing model using ­WSN-​­based communication and its implementation. This makes the system an environment based on power quality. Appropriate structures and controls were established and analyzed for managing the overall performance of a tracking machine within the smart grid [12]. This blockchain primarily based totally get entry to protocol makes the unique ­add-​­directly to the ­IoT-​­SG technology. Through this proposal, the information is securely introduced to the provider companies from their respective SMs. The ­node-­​­­to-​­node (­P2P) communique collects information from the SMs of customers and transfers it to the blocks after verification. This literally works as the broker between the power stations and users and thus makes it private and confidential. It is mainly used for recording information in a secure way [13]. This plays with the smart grid infrastructure and its architecture in a field area network (­FAN). The utilization, tracking, and control of diverse renewable energy sources are the maximum outstanding functions of smart grid infrastructure for agriculture applications. This paper describes the implementation of an IoT primarily based on totally wireless strength control gadget and the tracking of climate parameters of the usage of a smart ­grid–​­based infrastructure. The concepts depicted in this paper give an answer for all three clever grid hierarchical networks in subject location networks to attach a big variety of devices [14]. In this article, a secure machine learning engine is proposed for the Internet of Things (­IoT)-​­enabled grid. There is a lot of power distribution involved with the smart grid, so it is important to secure it properly. Advanced energy management and interface controlling agents are proposed to optimize energy utilization in difficult situations, like when the power system is strained. A flexible Demand Side Management (­DSM) is proposed to adapt quickly in these situations. A specific resilience model is proposed to control intrusions in smart grids and used with Machine Learning (­ML) classifiers from unwanted entities [15]. This paper discusses about the collaboration of IoT with the smart grid environment. Its contribution of ­IoT-​­SG has gained immense potential due to its various innovation features. This mainly focuses on research ideas with IoT with SG and encourages scientists to make more and more innovations by understanding the role of IoT with SG, which together demonstrates enormous growth potential that smart grids open up regarding awareness for new interdisciplinary research [16]. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive overview of ­IoT-​­aided smart systems, covering the current architecture, applications, and prototypes of these systems. Since the traditional grids are unidirectional, they can’t adjust with some new features. SG offers ­ bi-​­ directional flow between providers and\n\n10\n\nIoT and Analytics in Renewable Energy Systems (Volume 1)\n\nconsumers. So, IoT enables SG, which requires connectivity and tracking along with upcoming research directions [17]. Reference [18] initially talks about the basic features of cloud computing and explains how cloud computing can be extended to the scenario where it is possible to realize fog computing adaptation for ­real-​­time analysis. Here it is possible to examine the data facilities at the premises of the users and to p­ re-​­collect the cloud data which aids in enabling the SG consumers with faster speed of communications. Cloud computing fails in the terms of quality of experience like low latency, etc. They also illustrate various algorithm models such as architecture, cost for ­real-​­time situations, etc. [18]. In this paper, they propose a new type of computing strategy to give solutions to ­location-​­aware, latency optimization. To regulate this, a f­og-​­based architecture and programming is enabled. So, existing technologies and techniques hardly utilize the fog computing nodes in the smart grid. This coordinator periodically measures the information that is metered from the resources. This fog computing is also able to manage all the given tasks at a time. The obtained results are to be different from traditional grids [19]. This article discusses a p­ rivacy-​ ­preserving framework for energy management on the smart grid. The data collected from the users are very confidential and to be protected, which is revealed to the cloud servers for ­Q-​­learning strategy. During the process of ­Q-​­learning, the data which split at the beginning stage are kept in random shares to avoid privacy issues. Along with this, edge computing is also being processed to implement an additive ­secret-​­sharing protocol [20].\n\n2.2 ­IoT-​­ENABLED SMART GRID WITH ENERGY EFFICIENCY IN VARIOUS ASPECTS 2.2.1 Radio Networking They develop and integrate both energy harvesting (­EH) and cognitive radio (­CR) approaches in this research to overcome SG difficulties including severe channel circumstances and low battery power. IoT connects with the smart grid environment to get benefits such as interoperability, interconnectivity, etc. EH and CR constitute a new phase of networking with ­IoT-​­SG. CR, which is a wireless communication, enables the IoT with detecting which channels are in use and which are not and prevent unwanted connection between devices [21].\n\n2.2.2 Cyberattacks In this paper, they announce the framework for SG, i.e., dependable time series analytics. It has the ability to provide dependable data transforming from the cyber physical system to aim for refining raw data and further rebuilding on it based on the matrix factorization method. This makes it possible to exchange raw time series data between the CPS and the objective system. It primarily involves a huge number of smart items that are connected via networks [22]. In this paper, they had an investigation regarding their collected infrastructure, and they proposed a general scalable mitigation approach called minimally invasive attack. This algorithm is able to withstand the timely detection. As we know that one of the key challenges of smart grid cyber security is their characteristic that leads to technical power failure. They also displayed some simulation to show the reliability for this approach [23]. The gist of this paper mainly conveys the authentication between smart grid users and service providers against various security attacks. These attacks are simulated with the help of quantum key that are generated for the verification of the proposed smart grid system and explains why security is a major concern in SGs. IoT has been expanded with large number of branches with the ability of transmission and communication, which has entered various levels of internet. With the above justification, smart grid faces various s­ ecurity-​­related issues and is withstood by the mutual authentication of users and providers [24]. This paper gives awareness on the vulnerabilities to cyberattacks, and they test smart gird systems in a ­real-​­world implantation effectively called test beds. These vulnerabilities arise from information communication technologies nature inherently.\n\nA Review on Internet of Things with Smart Grid Technology\n\n11\n\nTest beds are used to find productive solutions against cyberattacks. These test beds are used to test the information that came from the user side and neglects the cyberattack capabilities. And, they also give recommendations for ­security-​­orientated aspects [25]. They discuss an approach termed smart grid security categorization in this study, which is designed for complicated circumstances such as sophisticated metering infrastructure. These methodologies result in a standard classification in an organization. Analysis collected through these methodologies is transferred to these organizations to get a valid report. The Strategic and Governance Services Centre (­SGSC) related to some risk analysis assigns a system of security class. These SGSC offers a path for decision makers about these security aspects also to maintain the correct functionalities to the proposed system [26].\n\n2.2.3 ­Energy-​­Efficient Management This paper focuses on cost optimization from smart homes under ­price-​­based demand response program. The development of IoT smart devices enables to make a strategy via demand response programs to work efficiently. They also proposed certain technical terms regarding the management of power usage of ­IoT-​­enabled homes like ­wind-​­driven bacterial foraging (­WBFA) and bacterial foraging optimization (­BFO) algorithms. This WBFA strategy responds to demand response programs against this major problem, which is the limitation of consumers’ knowledge in the demand side [27]. This research offers a Deer Hunting Optimization (­DHO) and Crow Search ­Algorithm-​­Based Energy Management System (­EMS) for distribution systems using an IoT platform and a hybrid approach (­CSA). With the aid of IoT, the major goal of this concept is to regulate electricity transmission and monitor metered data to end users. With the support of IoT, this proposed approach allows service providers to be more flexible in their operations [28]. This paper mainly discusses elaborately about simulation tests and collected data from an electricity management system whose main objective is to minimize the high amount of load voltage values from the production from the prosumer. The above experimental research is based on Elastic Energy Management (­EEM), which enables data from the source to be transferred with correct maintenance with flexible features. The data are collected from a message broker called MQTT protocol. Using this node, various searching procedures were used in the EEM [29].\n\n2.2.4 Edge and Fog Computing In this paper, a new f­og-​­enabled ­privacy-​­preserving data aggregation is introduced. This proposal differs from the traditional smart grid communication with false data injection attacks. Just like managing a large group of IoT systems is a challenging task, data aggregation for next generation SG is also an issue. FESDA is a ­fault-​­free equipment even if we make changes in the SMs. It also evaluates its performance through aggregation and decryption [30]. This invention covers MapReduce apparatus for handling huge amounts of data with flexibility at the distribution end. As a result, whenever a wireless IoT node covers sensor data sets, MapReduce runs the procedures and sends the results to the grid. This section has significantly decreased consumption in huge networks while also enhancing the smart grid. Since a wireless IoT edge causes congestion, it employs WIERBS technology to alleviate it, resulting in lower operational latency and improved performance [31]. This paper gives an insight about another major challenge in IoT, i.e., managing a large volume of data. To overcome this issue, edge computing is introduced. These data are processed at the edge of the IoT network, near to the embedded devices that gather the data. IoT even makes small concerns to be networked and interconnected to each other to follow the protocols of measuring and analyzing with the SG. Smart grid also consists of a large amount of sensor data. Edge computing is used to manage all the networks like these kinds of sectors in smart grid [32]. This paper carries out the concept of data processing before it is transmitted for deeper data mining intelligence. This presents an ­edge-­​­­node-​­aware framework, namely, distributed computing, which brings enterprise applications closer to data sources such as local edge servers. Since smart grid is\n\n12\n\nIoT and Analytics in Renewable Energy Systems (Volume 1)\n\nan effective tool of energy management domain such as SMs renewable sources, etc., with the rise of transforming network structure toward green environment, edge node is adapted in a n­ ode-­​­­to-​­node manner [33]. This paper mainly talks about the demand side management in the smart grid with IoT and cloud computing. It initially talks about the traditional power grids and creates awareness about wastage of energy and money. This method creates a massive ­demand–​­supply disparity, resulting in exorbitant prices. They offer an application of IoT and cloud computing in this work, which provides a customer load profile that can be managed remotely by service businesses. This can be done through installing project circuit board, which can be accessed via web portal [34].\n\n2.2.5 Applications, Fault Analysis, and Distributions This paper reviews the ­knowledge-​­based analytics that maybe used to observe the Stuck at fault condition in advanced metering infrastructure meters, which stores the data in the form of charges. This corrects the abnormal variation and predicts what cell is going to be stuck in the AMI meter. Since the grid uses sensor data for analyzing and for monitoring the IoT devices, it has to go through the process wherein the AMI meter plays the main role in k­ nowledge-​­based data processing strategy in smart grid [35]. This paper talks about the basic architecture of IoT with smart grid technology and is followed by the key technologies of I­oT-​­SG. It is evident that in the past decade there is no established technology which aids in realizing smart electric power sector that has the capacity to compensate the production with the demand side of consumers. Smart grid becomes a vital part of transmission, which combines with IoT to monitor, control, and connect in the electrical system. It also discusses about the deployment of IoT technologies that increases the potential of smart grid development and will be able to overcome the fundamental challenges [36]. This paper discusses the study of application of big data and ML in the emergence of the next power system. Connectivity plays an important role in this new grid infrastructure, which is one of the domains of IoT. The integration of big data and I­oT-​­SG makes efficient metering of load with proper estimation of cost. Again, the IoT with smart grid technology plays with its major challenge, i.e., security becomes a critical issue. Big data and ML still try to overcome the security issue [37].\n\n2.2.6 ­Blockchain-​­Based IoT This study describes a hybrid block chain approach for 5G networks, in which the service provider deploys both private and public broker platforms (­MEC). We use block chain technology with an IoT device identification to make data easier to access and secure. This research looks at how ­IoT-​ ­SG devices are properly identified. This scenario also combines block chain technology with a 5G network to identify and report IoT fraud in the smart grid. In addition to this technology, they analyzed various consensus algorithms from the respective feasible hybrid block chain [38].\n\n2.3 ­REAL-​­TIME APPLICATIONS OF ­IoT-​­ENABLED SMART GRID 2.3.1 ­IoT-​­Based Smart Applications This paper introduces a special feature called smart plugs that enhances IoT for establishing hybrid connected system and also compromises the demand for existing response of end users. Since I­ oT-​ ­SG being a complicated process, we can’t give preference for every device, instead of that we are using smart plugs. These smart plugs can’t be installed as such, it has to prestored in the domains of microprocessor before using. This also discussed about the current plug technologies and limitations to overcome this hybrid monitoring system [39]. This paper designs the model and implementation of ­IoT-​­based smart energy meter as we know that SM uses advanced metering infrastructure, they enhance ­two-​­way communication between servers and consumers. Such kind of infrastructure makes flexible benefits to the power system easy and reliable. This also talks about cyberattacks to the power researchers. So, to avoid the basic carelessness and some security concerns it is mandatory\n\nA Review on Internet of Things with Smart Grid Technology\n\n13\n\nto utilize SMs. This also integrates with IoT fabrication to connect with hardware technologies [40]. This paper gives an idea to defeat the challenges faced by the current smart grid through various measures. By implementing these IoT techniques, end users and operators are able to maintain the supply of resources, and reduce operation and maintenance cost by using smart appliances. As of now, cyber security being a vital challenge for the demand side, it can be performed through combining analog and digital aspects in this task [41]. Through the selection of mobile couriers, this article presents a future notion of smart grid in smart cities. This is commonly utilized in smart city “­pervasive sensing paradigms” for sharing data applications. This perspective has broadened the IoT mission, which now includes radio frequency identification (­R FID) sensors, readers, and other devices. As a consequence, we’re providing smart cities with a hybrid d­ ata-​­gathering platform. This connects with the city’s base station, data access points, and data couriers. This concept plays with the mobile functioning protocols to gather data with some limitations [42].\n\n2.4 ­IoT-​­BASED SMART GRID ARCHITECTURE This paper reviews the smart grid architecture by enabling adaptivity in IoT. Since we were using a huge amount of electric power in the previous decade, we blindly ignored the estimation of data. This paper researches how to integrate the ­state-­​­­of-​­art information with the existing adaptivity in the smart grid. This literally means to reconfigure IoT service parts without other service parts stopping working. Therefore, proactively adapting devices with this kind of context fluctuation becomes a concern [43]. The motive of this paper is to convey the challenges, issues, and opportunities for the development of SG. Smart grid is accelerating to meet the electricity demand providing a way toward ­eco-​­friendly era in a reliable manner. This ­two-​­way communication feature in SG being a more efficient property, they use an application of renewable energy resources, s­ elf-​­healing distribution intelligence, etc. This paper also gathered information about the upcoming opportunities for the development of a smart grid environment [44]. This article examines the IoT application, as well as addresses the necessary smart grid and data collecting criteria using the feature known as power Internet of Things. It’s a smart service system that makes extensive use of modern information technology and artificial intelligence to enable ­human–​­computer interaction. Power Internet of Things exclusively integrates various infrastructure resources and updates the level of power system communication. It designs a ­full-​­service coverage of power Internet of Things and guides for the future planning of communication [45].\n\n2.5 DETECTION FOR ­IoT-​­ENABLED SMART GRID SYSTEM This study provides a probabilistic incremental clustering approach for analyzing energy consumption from current smart meters, which may be represented by load patterns retrieved from load data. This suggested technique performs a pattern reading trip on existing load patterns before switching to new load patterns from smart meters. Some of them are experimented with real data set and are evaluated by combining clustering, which outperforms this type of algorithm. Plus, this strategy displays the drift through its results [46]. This paper reviews the intrusion detection system (­IDS) designed for smart grid that collects data from a power plant. Smart grid satisfies both services company and end consumers in a ­two-​­way communication model. Because the smart grid confronts security issues as a result of vulnerabilities in IoT systems, which produce security risks that affect smart applications, a rising demand for IDS tailored for IoT to combat ­IoT-​­related security assaults that exploit particular security weaknesses has emerged. Since IDS acts as a data check tool, it can also be used for ML and DL [47].\n\n2.6 RECENT ADVANCEMENTS IN ­IoT-​­SMART GRID TECHNOLOGY Signcryption with proxy ­re-​­encryption approach is used to meet the security needs of IoT connection in this article. Because the smart grid platform’s IoT devices create a large quantity of data that\n\n14\n\nIoT and Analytics in Renewable Energy Systems (Volume 1)\n\nmust be handled and saved in the cloud server, it must be maintained and authorized independently. Since signcryption with schemes for SG is facing difficulty from more bandwidth, the paper proposes a light weight certificate based signcryption (­CBSERE). This minimizes the commutation and communication cost along with increased security [48]. The goal of this study is to tackle the resource allocation problem of the smart grid’s radio access network slice. Since this is term is not familiar in this technology, deep reinforcement learning is deployed. This also discusses the ­real-​ ­time application with the mapping of RAN to DRL. This also promotes 5G network which is and interconnected network that shows great potential with features of slicing. There is a picture clear virtualization between the industries to make it reliable and flexible. So, considering these service characteristics, a smart RAN slice is proposed to get simulation results through DRL (­reducing the cost) [49]. They provide an overview of smart grid in this article, with its adaptable characteristics and many roles in the power distribution system. With ­day-­​­­by-​­day enhancement in technology, there will be a huge demand for electrical supply for its production. With the development of the distribution system, the rising demand is also increasing with the speed of maintaining the smart grid infrastructure. This paper discusses the broad scope of reliable and efficient deployment of smart grid technology in the power sector [50].\n\n2.7 CONCLUSION As of now, we all know that IoT with some emerging technologies like smart grid or renewable energy is being most wanted for consumers and for efficient processes. We have given a clear picture of how the end users can handle the device or smart appliances by knowing how they analyze the data and being aware of the price clustering and power demand. We have also adapted the technology that when one cycle of process of data observation and the resultant price was higher than expected, it automatically adjusts the usage and efficiency of the device or appliance that enabled ­IoT-​­SG to get the estimated price of the power that has been issued. Communication is an important enabler of smart grid systems. The smart grid is expected to use a wide range of communication technologies for future advancement. The use of communication technologies in the smart grid is influenced by application demands, geographic locations, surroundings, regulation, price, and other factors. The deployment of IoT technology at various levels of the smart grid has been covered in this chapter. It has been demonstrated that new types of applications and architectures, such as improved smart metering infrastructure, m ­ ulti-​­agent systems, and fog computing, have been enabled by the technologies. These provide benefits like autonomy, scalability, mobility, and resiliency, among others. Security and efficiency are still issues to improve the efficacy of IoT; future research should focus on this.\n\nREFERENCES 1. Al-​­Turjman, F. and Abu Jubbeh, M., 2019.

This network needs a suitable, safe, and reliable structure to meet the goals of intelligence. There are two types of data in smart grids: physical measurements and variable states. This information is collected every 2–4 seconds and used to estimate the status of the network. Current systems can only detect destructive data due to incorrect measurements of measuring instruments and cannot detect malicious data injection by attackers. This research has investigated and identified this attack in the smart grid mode vector estimation. In both cases, the attack vector injects inaccurate data at random, and attackers seek to enter any data to create an error in estimating the network state vector without the target being a specific component of the state vector. In this type of attack, from the beginning, it seeks to form a suitable data vector so that it is considered to create its error in a specific component of the network mode vector.\n\nDOI: 10.1201/9781003331117-3\n\n17\n\n18\n\nIoT and Analytics in Renewable Energy Systems (Volume 1)\n\n3.1 INTRODUCTION Today, electricity is the main source of energy consumption in the world. In the early days, electricity was generated and consumed locally, i.e., small power plants were built in each region for fulfilling energy consumption needs of that region. With the industrialization of countries, the electricity demand increased sharply. The construction of small power plants no longer seemed logical, because the construction of large power plants and the transfer of electricity to distant places were not economically viable. The solution to overcoming this concern was introducing the concept of smart grids. Just as it is impossible to imagine a world without ­e-​­mail technology today, there will soon be a time when human life would not be conceivable without a smart grid. In such a system, communication links for transferring data and commands are vital; therefore, having uninterrupted communication is required for the reliable operation of electricity distribution and transmission networks. In addition to managing and protecting the network, ­real-​­time communication is also needed for an uninterrupted power supply to customers. As the population grows and energy demand expands, the electrical and low efficiency of traditional power distribution networks in the face of the burden imposed by customers requires intelligent energy management. The conversion of traditional energy networks to smart grids has led to a revolution in the energy industry [1]. The basic concept of smart grids is entwined with improving ­demand-​­side management and energy efficiency using advanced metering infrastructure and building a flexible and reliable power grid. Electrical energy flows from generating stations to consumers through a ­one-​­way hierarchical flow. This ­one-​­way, uncontrolled flow of electricity poses several challenges for traditional networks and their operators. Power outages can have irreparable economic and social effects. For example, the 2003 power outage in North America, which took 4 days, was caused by a relatively small fault and left about $6 billion to $13 billion impairments. Smart grids generally include power, information, and communication infrastructure, which require exchanging information and ­two-​­way telecommunications across the entire network. By using intelligent technology to make fundamental changes for making timely decisions in critical situations in production, transmission, distribution, and energy consumption, unwanted blackouts can be prevented, and in addition to providing customers with secure and stable electricity access, incurring additional costs can be avoided [2]. A smart grid brings many opportunities and challenges to the electricity industry. These challenges include high operating costs and lack of clear strategy, modeling complexity, data security and privacy, sufficient knowledge, and experience to use smart equipment [3]. The security challenge in smart grids, due to the variety of components, different ways of sending data, and the definition of different layers for these networks, is very diverse and complex. Despite the significant advantages of connecting further s­ ub-​­sections of smart grids, these connections can also make smart grids more vulnerable to malicious security attacks. Therefore, it is clear that the security of smart grids is one of the most important technical challenges in advancing the smartening of the electricity industry. ­Large-​­scale coverage of smart grids makes it possible to manage operations remotely, but the first concern is security against hackers, misuse, and malicious activities [4]. One of the attacks that have caught the attention of many researchers is the False Date Injection Attack (­F DIA) malware injection because traditional networks are unable to detect this attack, so attackers can distract the control center from making the right decision. This type of attack in smart grids has been investigated and identified in reference [5].\n\n3.1.1 History of Smart Electricity Networks The power grid structure, which has been delivering power to numerous consumers for years, is evolving rapidly, with a population growth of 25% since 1982. Traditional networks are\n\nSecuring Smart Power Grids Against Cyber-Attacks\n\n19\n\nFIGURE 3.1 Overview of a smart grid.\n\ninsufficient to meet this increasing demand, and constructing new generators to add to our power network is not logical. Therefore, smart grids are considered a new generation of power systems with advanced computing and communication technologies. ­Figure 3.1 shows an overview of an intelligent power grid. The purpose of a smart grid is to use telecommunications, information technology, and data science in the current grid to be more flexible, efficient, and capable. This rapid growth in size, scale, and complexity also has limitations. These constraints pose both national challenges, such as the security of the power system, and global challenges, such as climate change, which are expected to be highly controversial in the future. Although the grid is about 99.97% reliable today, power outages in a country like the United States still cost at least $150 billion a year (­about $500 per capita) (­only one outage). Electricity caused $4 billion to $10 billion in damage to Canada and the United States in 2003 [6]. In December 2007, the then President of the United States signed the Energy Independence and Security Act,\n\n20\n\nIoT and Analytics in Renewable Energy Systems (Volume 1)\n\nknown as the EIAS, which was formed to monitor the electricity power section, the third part of which was called smart grids [6]. The world’s first smart grid was introduced in March 2008, and the city of Boulder, Colorado, became the first smart grid city. Over the years, China has become the largest and most important global smart grid market. The Consumer Electronics Control (­CEC) recently reported that 26.53% of electricity generated in Japan in 2010 was from clean energy sources [7]. It is estimated that by 2030, $378 billion will be spent worldwide to build smart grids. Most of the cost will be contributed by ten countries. The main payers are the United States, Brazil, India, China, and several European countries. Modernizing transmission and distribution is also expected to provide the largest investment in the energy structure in the next 20 years. Designers’ goal is to use smart technology around the three main axes of subscribers, equipment, and communications. Given the above, it seems that the use of smart grids will be inevitable in the future. Therefore, this network needs to be further evalu"
