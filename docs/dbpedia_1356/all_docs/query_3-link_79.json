Patricia Clough and Jasbir Puar have been my secret sharers in this adventure of political thought for many years: thanks for all the aÂects (no, really). My colleagues at the New School, Gary Lemons, Kian Tajbaksh, Ifeona Fulani, M. Jacqui Alexander, Greg Tewksbury, Steve Caton, and Jan Clausen, were constant inspirations and keen critics. My colleagues at Florida State University, Jerri McGregory, Chris Shinn, Virgil Suarez, and Delia Poey, have provided me with many diÂerent intellectual and emotional resources to negotiate my new institutional contexts and to reconceptualize this project. The support of Ralph Berry, Robin Goodman, Leigh Edwards, Barry Faulk, Bruce Boehrer, and Dan Vitkus has been a solid spur to action these past few years. At diÂerent points in my career I have been lucky to find students who have been infinitely patient and creatively engaged, including Diane Roi, Taimur Khan, Louisa Solomon, Emily Sogn, Krishna Mali, Iskandar Zulkarnain, Jonathan Dean, Krysten Davis, and Kathryn Wright. I thank Saleh and Ginger Assadi for accepting me into their family. Much of what I have been able to write here would not have been possible without their generosity and aÂection. Sudeep Shrivastava always gave me his untiring help through these many, many years. Dustin Anderson and Andrew McFeaters provided productive points of intersection and contrast (as well as sculpted tile and the philosophy of the Red Sox). To Tarun, Puppy, and Kenny I can only say that without your friendship and ironic guidance this work would not have come to fruition. To Sarah Fryett: thanks for the mutations! The writing of this book was made possible by various grants and institutional support. The American Institute of Indian Studies Senior Research\n\nFellowship, the New School research support for archival work, Florida State’s first-year professor grant and Committee on Faculty Research Support (cofrs) grant have enabled this work to proceed apace. I would like to thank Ken Wissoker for his rigorous engagement with this project and for his encouragement, and I thank Courtney Berger for her meticulous and timely attention to the details of the manuscript. I would like to also thank the very helpful suggestions of the anonymous readers of the manuscript. All errors that remain are of course my own.

A deep, quasi-British-accented voiceover suÂuses meaning through a rapid machine-gun movement between orchestral crescendos and pounding dance beats, digitally massaged star images, logos, and intertitles (as the viewer looks through a lens and takes aim). The comforting voice tells us of Eros’s production of “spellbinding spectacles,” “magnificence beyond belief ” (a twirling Aishwarya Rai-Durga in Devdas), and “irresistible charm” (Sharukh as Devdas-babu). The voice continues: It’s the magical trance of Bollywood. For the past twenty-five years one name has cast a spell across the globe. It’s Eros Entertainment International. [Western urbanscapes, multicolored bowling balls, and the Statue of Liberty flow by in a quick montage.] As the largest Bollywood content provider . . . Eros will continue to bring you the best of Bollywood in times to come. At Eros it’s a vision to create, enhance, and distribute content across technological platforms. As a pioneer in international home video markets, for Bollywood Eros provides a catalog of over two thousand film titles and song compilations on dvd, vcd, and vhs. Eros launched the world’s first Bollywood pay-per-view service. [Kareena Kapoor in powder blue gyrates at the center of the crosshairs.] To repurpose its content for the broadband environment, Eros ventured into\n\nvideo on demand. To delight tv viewers all over, Eros launched the hugely popular satellite channels b4u and b4u-Music. For millions of netizens across the world erosentertainment.com is the sought-after Bollywood website. For those flying high, Eros oÂers enthralling in-flight entertainment on all prestigious international airlines. The state-of-the-art Eros postproduction studio is breaking new ground in creative ideation and design. Now [pause in music, a slow reedy lilt builds as we follow Aishwarya’s gaze to mark the pixels of a digital butterfly flitter across the screen and into the heavens] the extraordinary odyssey of Eros takes a big leap—film production and finance adds another splendid chapter in the dazzling saga of its pathbreaking success. Eros International is a fully integrated media company that’s taking Bollywood places.1 In a review of the top Oscar contenders for 2006, Manohla Dargis laments the kind of shifts that Eros hails as their crowning achievements: “To judge by how executives at major studios often talk about their business, in their discussions about closing windows, new platforms and emergent technologies, the movies themselves barely count. What counts is when you can watch a film on your cellphone, not if there is something worth losing your eyesight over. In the age of the incredible shrinking movie, content equals quantity, not quality . . . A nation of iPod-people, each staring at his or her individually downloaded film on the delivery system of his or her choice, seems a poor substitute for the oceanic feeling that comes with watching a film with a crowd, finding communion in the dark.”2 For Dargis an era of cinema exhibition is coming to the end of its particular duration, and the shape of things felt in cinema is reforming. In the pages to come, this duration and its untold mutations will form the basis of what I wager is a stochastic or nonlinear experience of Bollywood. Something untimely unfolds through the changing conditions of media consumption in globalizing India today. Something untimely, as when one is witness to a patterned dissolution of moviegoing practices in the dynamic topology or emergent forms of the new media. And this, for critics such as Dargis, signals the end of a certain anonymous community of viewing, the quantification of cin­ ema art, and the technological individuation of media consumption. In taking the cinephile’s lament as seriously as Eros’s global ambition, I argue for a media assemblage approach to the evolving problem of media and its habituations. There is a set of terms that will come to resonate throughout this text, and I will introduce them in their place, but here I would like to map their Introduction\n\n“domain of validity” and the disciplinary fields with which they are correlated.3 The overall aim of this book is to shift the analysis of audiovisual media from a representational frame where the image, discourse, narrative, signifier, and ideal are all in various ways master tropes that produce a linear causal relation to consciousness and identity. In observing media events whose eÂects are multiple, contradictory, implicative, and evolving, the necessity of making this shift came to me as an intuitive shock. When confronted with the protean embodiment of sensation through the time of these events, it seemed that all of my previous conceptual frames rendered the media event as the reproduction of the same or the similar. It was this shock that led me to a method of diagramming nonlinear processes of an assemblage that implicates bodies through their potential or capacity to mutate. By intervening in postcolonial media studies, film studies, new media studies, and eco-criticism, this study focuses on media as a contested production of sensation. In that regard, one dimension of this domain of validity is the cultural critique of identity (in terms of sexuality, gender, caste, class, religion, and transnationality) as an eÂect of discourse. For too long, representation has been thought in terms of an actualized product of given hierarchies of power. But what if representation is an event that performs anew with each repetition and with each new scene of circulation being an unpredictable but patterned trajectory of present conforming to past but open to future mutations?4 If so then what needs prior elaboration is not the production of representation but the viability of its event: How does an audiovisual stream contagiously “catch on”? How does audiovisual technology circulate regimes of signs and sounds such that they seem to “catch on” to the very bodies of newly globalized consumers? Pleasures circulate across populations and sensations proliferate paradoxes. The most banal media stream becomes a resource for a passionate attachment, and so Shahrukh “King” Khan reigns for over a decade as the premiere Bollywood attraction. Sensations resonate “at the point where body and population meet.”5 This is also precisely how Michel Foucault defined sexuality, and in pursuing this preindividual sense of sexuality as a question of the very movements of media events I argue for a notion of sexualization as a historical ecology of sensation. Sexuality emerges first as intuited sensation through the interactive capacities of the various elements of the assemblage, and then as codified contents, signs, or narratives. But the preindividual ecology of sensation is the very condition of the evolution of sexual identity itself, and that evolution is about the refunctioned bios in media technologies, the body in habituated populations, and the body Introduction\n\nmutating through these repetitive processes. Thus, I suggest that the key question of sexuality needs to be situated in a broader field of dynamic processes that take those very processes as objects to be tinkered with. (This notion of evolution as natural tinkering has been decisive in rethinking the various eÂects of bio/power, for instance through feedback loop relations.) A closely related aspect of this domain of validity is the conceptualization of the body as an assembling whole that is open to change through its own indeterminations. The feminist and queer multiplication of the gendered, raced, and sexed body’s resistant desires, pleasures, and intensities would mark this domain’s disciplinary intervention. Drawing on anti-racist, postcolonial, and queer feminist theory, this argument highlights how the human body has evolved its capacities to change and be changed (aÂectivity) by developing specific kinds of connections between technology, energy, memory, neuronal activity, and the flesh. And these connections cannot be adequately grasped as the body adding to its powers through prosthetic coupling. This would be the body as an amalgam of prostheses on a unified body as in some forms of cyborg theory. Instead, I focus on the body fluctuating across key thresholds, times, and technologies of digital control. This is the biopolitical domain of my study, and its disciplinary correlates are political philosophy and new media studies. Dargis suggests in the quote above that part of what is happening to film is its integration in portable computing interfaces that increasingly are shrinking in size and speeding up intensive consumption. But this gets at one of the important diÂerences between Eros as business model and Dargis as film critic: the privileged position of film as master organizer of media eÂects. What happens to the consuming body when cinema is refunctioned, or repurposed in new media, as Eros hopes and Dargis despairs? One of the most important responses to this question of the body in media is Vivian Sobchack’s film-based phenomenology, which reframes the question of the “cinesthetic” subject as follows: “What have we, as contemporary media theorists, to do with such tactile, kinetic, redolent, resonant, and sometimes even taste-full descriptions of the film experience?”6 Sobchack shifts the terrain of film toward a broader mediascape and then moors that shift by privileging cinema as the origin of its governing sensations. I have two arguments against this approach. First, my focus on the body’s aÂects modulated across these cultural and technological thresholds is committed to furthering ongoing explorations of the specific modes of address of Indian film genres as they articulate in feedback loop relations with active au-\n\nIntroduction\n\ndiences and the global restructuring of the financial, labor, aesthetic, and creative infrastructures of a variety of transnational media.7 The production of bodily aÂect is a continuous multiplicity, a multiplicity that is continuously varying with itself because of its intensive self-organizing activity and its open interfaces with outside forces, dynamics, and materialities. Also, given that the creation of surplus value within the aÂect economy fixates on the accumulation and revaluing of the aÂective capacities of life itself, this emergent aÂectivity implies that in the media assemblage there can be no privileging of cinema as original apparatus or industry. Second, the body under the conditions of the analog versus digital assemblage is a body that must be thought of as the site of creative indetermination before actual experience and before consciousness, at the level of what is called proprioception, which is the continuous monitoring of internal changes in the body by sensory nerve endings brought about by movement and muscular activity (i.e., the preindividual). As Susan Buck Morss, Mark Hansen, and Brian Massumi (in their diÂerent ways) have shown in their explorations of the nervous system, the aÂectivity of the body is a way of dynamically connecting with the world in all its profusion of sensation.8 It follows then that the media phenomenon as a set of events assembled together through feedback loop relations is never fully experienced at the level of consciousness, representation, or identity. And so it is precisely the body as preindividual (that is, individual and populational at once), self-organizing (a mutating multiplicity far from equilibrium and intuitively open to its own becomings), and dynamic (simultaneously stochastic and patterned) that now comes to be situated at the center of a given media assemblage. Finally, the domain of validity of this study is characterized by a thought of ontology as duration.9 This suggests a shift away from thinking of media eÂects as products legible on a passive body and toward the intensive processes of consumption that give a media assemblage its particular durations. Duration here is understood in terms of both the nested temporalities that are lived through the assemblage, and the duration it has as an entity in its own right. Like a sugar cube on fire, when audio-visual media catch on there is a specific duration and intensity to its forms that comes from the “internal resonance” of its various capacities and its singular aÂordances vis--vis its ecology.10 How do new forms of media come to dominance, and how can we best grasp their emergence in the preindividual, self-organizing, and dynamic bodies of its globalizing consumers? To account for this emergence we need a kind of analysis (the biogram, in Brian Massumi’s terms) that\n\nIntroduction\n\nunlocks the part of the media event that exceeds its actualization. As will become clear in subsequent chapters, the concept that to my mind enables such counteractualization is aÂect. The terms that I will develop in my definition of media assemblages are drawn from a variety of sources in feminist and queer philosophy, the physical and biological sciences, and biopolitical cultural criticism. For instance, one way of modeling the assembling body-in-media is to trace out a continuous movement (or qualitative multiplicity) of audiovisual information across a population as a contagion. The notion of contagion seems particularly apt for my purposes since a diagram of contagious multiplicities distributed across technological platforms through dynamic thresholds is a way of keeping in mind a postcolonial feminist resonance of contagion as racial miscegenation and sexual degeneracy,11 while also moving away from its analysis as metaphor (and resemblance) toward consideration of ontic durations of media pleasures that change in kind (i.e., qualitatively).12 In such a view, the capitalist circulation of sound movements in the production of consumerist aÂect becomes an element in an overall resegmentation of audience populations, all with a view for new sites, strategies, and possibilities for value creation and accumulation. But media contagions are like parasites that draw energy and information into a dissipative cascade of events whose causes are multiple and whose eÂects are nonlinear.13 The notion of contagion, thus, draws attention to processes that unfold through turbulent events that exceed their actualization.\n\nFlashback I began this book project twelve years ago through a consideration of how, in the context of Indian nationalism after independence, the iconography and discourse of Elvis Presley was deliriously re-created (as hybrid identity in representation) by the popular Hindi-Urdu film actor Shammi Kapoor. The connection, and its at least partial celebration, was of a piece with a politics of (reading) resistance rooted in discursive strategies, the performativity of gender, the political economy of the sign, and the disparate narratives of postcolonial subjectivation and desubjectivation as a shuttling of the gendered subaltern. Decisive here was the work of Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak. In some sense, the most challenging cultural studies work done in the fields of representational analysis in the 1990s was an ongoing conversation that began with the circulation of “Can the Subaltern Speak?” But perhaps we have yet to catch the full force of that brilliant question? Certainly in Introduction\n\nmy own work this missed opportunity took the form of an analytical method that deployed film as the “metaphoric” ground from which political forms would be read. For me a decisive shift has occurred in the thought of media over the years since 9/11. The memory of the suspended ashes of human flesh on the streets of Chinatown and Tribeca forcefully suggest that we return to the minoritized histories of globalizing and contested spaces through what Brian Massumi and Manuel Delanda call an “incorporeal materialism”; indeed, that event and the subsequent biopolitical settlement of the Bush administration caused me to reconceptualize a set of researches on communal riots and film exhibition practices that I had conducted for over a year in Bhopal, India (in 2000–2001, my first extended trip since 1991).14 My immediate aim in my Bhopal research initiatives was to understand the life of Lily Talkies, a brilliant movie hall built in 1971. I fell in love with pictures at Lily. And for the first time I began attending to the body and its sensations (situating the problem of sexuality in an assemblage context) in the social processes of viewing film, just as a certain analysis of the biopolitical state of exception was making itself felt throughout academia. A changing domain of validity started to take shape, and I began asking how to live an untimely love, a kind of complicit extraction, of India’s media assemblage as a diasporic Indian. What emerged was a cinephilia becoming tele-info-philia. But the love here also functions to open thought to the specific shock of bearing witness to the death of exactly that which you love: What does media pleasure have to do with the bare life of the state of exception? In what way are contemporary media assemblages and contemporary processes of biopolitical control creating new bodily modes of a potentializing power? These initial questions had to be themselves reformulated in light of the specificity of India’s postHindutva globalizing economy, where forms of digital-binary control in fact function through caste, communal, privatizing, and patriarchal lines of becoming whose history cannot be enclosed by either the rupture or the unity of discipline and biopower.15 This led me to pose how at the level of everyday experience new habituations regarding the future and its management were entering the nested spatiotemporal scales of my analysis: How had global risk management become folded into the media assemblage in India? Part of what is at stake in this study, then, is a reconsideration of the critical function of (Indian, Hindu, secular, Bollywood, diasporic) “culture” in postcolonial media assemblages. (In this regard the nation will be both key placeholder and site of displacement in elaborating the media assemblage of globalization; no national frame can exhaust the contagious dynamism of Introduction\n\ncontemporary media.) In short, I began developing a methodological prism through which a diagram of the relationship between global risk, terrorism, homo sacer, and the audiovisual movements of contemporary media assemblages in India becomes both legible and virtual. Most immediately, this eÂort brought me to the work of Madhav Prasad, Ravi Vasudevan, Geeta Kapur, Tejaswini Naranjana, Ashish Nandy, and Lalitha Gopalan. It is Gopalan’s text Cinema of Interruptions that provided me with the initial coordinates for an exploration of the new media assemblage in India and its diasporas. There are moments in her study of action genres in Indian cinema where the thought of what I am calling media assemblages (contagious and continuous multiplicities, or ecologies of matter, media, and sensation) proliferates beyond the dialectic of interruption and continuity—that is, moments where a certain complicity is marked and made strange by its becoming something else. Gopalan’s text pushes the terms of debate beyond their contemporary framings. She does this through the cinephile’s odd and always risky combination of marking pleasure and launching critique—an interpretive pleasure in cinema that is profoundly ethical and itself interruptive. For instance, the beloved song-and-dance sequences, despite their profilmic integration into narratives (e.g., in the work of director Mani Ratnam), do not, in Gopalan’s words, “totally escape their ability to circulate separately from his films to other economies of production and reception.”16 This line of flight traversing bodily and aural-imagistic economies limns the connectivities of what I will call India’s media assemblage. My initial thought spurred by Gopalan’s reading was that this separation is also a form of connectivity, continually unstable feedback loop relations across aleatory variables, stochastic channels of communication, technological-human substrates, and unpredictable but patterned trajectories. It is precisely this multiform connectivity of the circulation of film music that moves cinema from fetish object into the broader dynamics of the media assemblage. Indeed, this is an aspect of the production and consumption of the Hindi film music industry that from its inception in the 1930s has necessarily involved film music in volatile connectivities. Even though, as Alison Arnold argued in a still-relevant article on film music, song-and-dance sequences were more often integrated with narrative flow in the first phase of film music (roughly from 1931 to 1965), what needs to be posed, even more so today given the changes in sound recording and consumption (consider Ray Dolby in India, both his decisive trip to the country in 1963 and the emergence and proliferation of this technology of sensation along with portable stereos in the 1970s and 1980s), is the actual shift Introduction\n\nin aÂective flows, or intensive consumption from narrative to song-dance movement.17 Thus the diÂerences across media—say from the cinema hall, to dvd, to cell phone ringtones, to jpeg/mpeg, to the Internet, not to mention from dialogue to song—could also be addressed as the qualitative, intensive shifts in the modulation of noise-desire-information-aÂect: namely, media synaesthesia.18 Crucial here is that, like many digital technologies, the shift into digital modulation happens at a level below experience in the neural activity of the embodied mind;19 one definition of mpeg (the acronym for Moving Pictures Expert Group), for instance, suggests that the mpeg algorithm achieves a higher rate of compression by storing only the changes, or intervals from one frame to another, instead of each entire frame. The video information is then encoded using a technique called dct (Discrete Cosine Transform) that prepares the data for compression and reduction. According to one source, “mpeg uses a type of lossy compression, since some data is removed. But the diminishment of data is generally imperceptible to the human eye.”20 This example highlights how contemporary forms of digital control (encryption) are changing the nature of the body’s functional connection to quickly reconfigured media technologies at a level below, or better, before perception (the media event), where the brain’s activity of “neural filling-in” is retrained and reinvested. And it is precisely here, at the preindividual level, that I situate the argument around sexuality in this book: ecologies of sensation modulate and potentialize the body’s pleasures and distribute them as contagions across segmented populations not as master scripts that normalize but as self-organizing codes that modulate and tinker. To my mind, Gopalan’s theory of Indian cinema as a constellation of interruptions enables this deterritorialization of film becoming media, where a dynamic threshold between text, media, sensation, and bodies becomes thinkable. The force of this insight was brought home to me when I began research into the everyday travails and pleasures of a cinema owner in Bhopal and the diverse populations that flowed through his exhibition space. My friendship with the cinema owner, Varun Moolchandani, was enabled through a certain camaraderie that my cousin Sudeep Shrivastava, a professor of economics, and I shared with his graduate students. Varun was my cousin’s star student. Brilliant, charismatic, and entrepreneurial, Varun is the scion of one of the most prominent business families in Bhopal. Although at one time the family members were staunch supporters of the centrist Congress Party, today the family leads the Hindu business community in supporting the Hindu Introduction\n\nchauvinist Bharatiya Janata Party. As refugees from Punjab after partition, Varun’s family settled in Bhopal and started Raj Radios. In 1971, using profits from the very successful radio retail business, the family established Lily Talkies. Lily was once the pearl of movie exhibition in Bhopal. Located between the old Muslim city and the new Hindu-dominated urban sprawl communities, as if between two legacies of postcolonial modernity, and facing one of the beautiful lakes of the city, it attracted a strong “family-oriented” business and was considered among the best serviced and cleanest of the city’s thirteen theaters. Throughout Lily’s early years (1971–1982), its owners had the ear of Indira Gandhi when push came to shove—for instance, during protracted and (often bitter) labor disputes. Usually the owners got their way, but in the years to come the contestation between the layers of the Hindu-Sikh-elite management-owners and the Muslim-subaltern staÂ would come to aÂect the life of Lily Talkies with ever-renewed intensity. From the mid-1990s, the traditional cinema exhibition business in the state was in rapid decline. Thus, after years of suÂering severe losses, the family was forced to shut down Lily Talkies when, at the end of 2005, the police raided the theater for censorship infringement. By that time Varun had already launched another media retail venture—selling dj equipment and producing training cds—and he claimed to dominate 70 percent of the market share in the state. By 2005, business was growing rapidly. The career of this one Sindhi family, as their lives and work traverse the singular media assemblage of globalizing India by negotiating and creating within it, points to one of the central arguments of this book: namely, the question of what is at stake in the thought of a media assemblage—in the very “experience” of indetermination and of what it is to create something new today. I pursue this question by considering diÂerent media events and their dynamic thresholds across aÂects and nested spatiotemporalities. I consider the possible biograms of “first day, first show events” in Bhopal (chapter 1). Following the insights of recent critics who have suggested that closer attention to exhibition is crucial for situating the precise nature of cinema’s biopolitics, I look at one of the organizing events of Indian cinema—notably the practice of attending first day, first show events. In so doing I reconstruct an experience of going to an opening of Mohabbatein (dir. Aditya Chopra, 2000) at a single-screen talkie in Bhopal. In subsequent chapters I tie this experience to the qualitatively diÂerent experience of the media event in the multiplex. In looking at the kinds of continuities and displacements from the single screen to the multiplex, I mark how the moment of exhibition is still what cannot be brought within the algorithms governing digital encryp10 Introduction\n\n1.

Digital rights management technologies notwithstanding, the changing technologies and functions of the media piracy economies destabilize the production of value of any particular media assemblage. This far-fromequilibrium condition suggests that the media assemblage’s social field is a site of indetermination because, at a basic level, it is the site of a struggle for securing image-sound contents and habituations.21 But this indetermination is deepened as soon as we move into the realm of image-sound consumption where we confront an analog body open to its own outside forces of futurity, creating the new as well as circulating the pirated—that is, the oscillation between a flight out of time as naturalized habit (the shock) and a continuous multiplicity of movement. Bringing thought to these many infolding but never fully actualized becomings is one way of touching the Untimely.\n\nEnter the dj The cosmopolitan dj is the guru of the media assemblage.

It is a rhythmic synaesthesia. To think about this emergence—as digital technologies shift, converge, but also qualitatively diÂerentiate embodied perception, dynamic interfaces, and divergent intervals—the evolving problematic returns again and again to aÂective control and becoming across media platforms. AÂective assemblages of bodies, populations, and media function through a kind of sticky symbiosis of what Baruch Spinoza called “relations of motion.” In India, as also in Hong Kong (but for very diÂerent reasons), two figures of time—utopia and nostalgia—have assumed a new centrality in contemporary theorizations of media and politics in their postmodern mode.22 This study, both informed by and departing from the terrain of those debates, privileges modalities of movement, and as such it follows from my central aims—from representation to diagram, cyborg body to assemblage, and from product to duration—that entail a focus on unpredictable but patterned trajectories within and of populations (becomings, or the untimely). In the pages that follow I give very diÂerent examples of such movements, some of which are folded into others and some are parasitic on another, but none of which resemble or analogize each other. Here, the styles and infrastructures of Hindi-Urdu cinema become newly global—its becoming as Bollywood. Thus, my first methodological move was to isolate and multiply the figures of time, or the sensorimotor circuits that could strategically be diagrammed in their moment of dominant and minority becomings. As such a certain topology of dynamic change, or what above I have called an ontology of duration, emerges across media technologies, audience populations, bodies, and spatiotemporalities. In chapters 2 through 4, my argument is divided into four parts that are involved in each other and mutually constitutive of each other yet do not form a dialectical progression.23 In the first part, I consider the potentializing excesses of film culture as sites for mapping this cinema’s contagious multiplicities. My method is to look at the changing nature of cinema, notably its functional connectivities as well as its evolving capacities to aÂect and be aÂected through its proximate populations, its many bodies, microspaces, and speeds, technological promiscuities, consumerist habituations, genre segmentations, and proliferating interfaces. What emerges is a new diagram of the movements constituting the durations of Bollywood’s media assemblage. The question that arises is what is the function of this potentializing excess? Or, what specific political charge should we “assign” to this excess given the informational nature of contemporary media assemblages? 12 Introduction\n\nThere are variations in the use of this term in this text, but I see these variations forming a kind of regularity. On the one hand, my use of the term excess stands in contrast to those forms of cultural criticism that would locate political subjectivity at the chaotic center of excess and then fold that center into a narrative of resistance to (hetero)normativity. At the most basic level, the shift from representation to diagram necessitates a thought of media assemblages that exceeds the signifier and its attendant regimes of meaning or indeterminacy. This excess, however, is not a site of any straightforward (human) resistance, but rather is embedded in patterned (recurring) processes of nonlinear and co-dependent emergence. Thus, the question of excess can never be reduced to a possible identity position, but rather must be seen as potential dimensions of change within a media assemblage. The ontology of duration suggests that as media habituations evolve over time and across populations, mutations and variations (excess) spontaneously form their own trajectories (self-organization) that may become the starting point for a general phase transition (or global restructuring and refunctioning) of the media assemblage itself. This is the nonhuman, or preindividual, form of excess that I argue for in this book, and one that I return to in the conclusion.24 Initially, I trace a first movement from cinema cultures to media assemblages, where the dominance of the framings of image-sound, culture, and narrative of film criticism are put to flight along another trajectory involved in thinking and feeling the interpenetrating, co-implicated, and continuous multiplicities of the human-media interface (hmi). In the second part of the book, I consider the rise of the multiplex in India as an example of the overall transformation in the nature of film culture: the media assemblage of a globalizing Bollywood that I sketched in my first section finds specific interfaces and connectivities in newly multiplexed bodies. This emergence can be understood again in terms of the shifts in the management of cinema’s risky excesses: audience-body, population-community, and theater-space have all been problematized in exhibition practices as sources or sites of contagion and possibly nonrecoupable, nonproductive expenditure. The multiplex in India seeks to resolve the problems associated with the single-screen theater in India by drawing on a technology that I am linking on the one hand to the non-resident Indian (nri) and on the other to the history of loitering bodies that have evolved from north Indian bazaar culture. The second movement, then, is from populations segmented in the single screen to a transnational and multiplicitous regime of sensation. In the final chapter, I consider the regime of sensation (the sensory-motor schema) launched, habituated, and Introduction 13\n\ninterrupted in the proliferation of insurancial and astrology technologies on Indian satellite tv. Here, I focus the diagram on elements of the media assemblage that take us from sexuality as identity to aÂect as bodily schema; I am specifically concerned with the image-sound connectivities of what I will call the ittafaq image (both chance and concordance in Urdu-Hindi and Arabic) as a continually deforming and reforming (topological) image center marking the emergence of risk technologies across contemporary media.25 I focus on two contemporary social practices common to both South Asia and the diaspora: insurance and spiritual healing. I tie the transformations in narrative and characterization in Bollywood melodrama to shifts in concepts of temporality, sexuality, and risk in the wake of the “financialization of everyday life” in India: that is, a movement from discursive constructs to political ontologies of capitalist time.26\n\nInterval This study situates the media assemblage of globalizing Bollywood through specific case studies. It flows from a desire to shift focus from (sexual, religious, caste, gender, racial, and class) identity and its representations as a form of identity suture and begin the rather more dubious but nonetheless crucial diagram of representational and nonrepresentational conjunctures and functionalities. This diagram will chart the co-dependent emergence of perception-technologies, rhythms, intensities, spaces, bodies, and temporalities that constitute contemporary film and new media practice in India and the diaspora. Such a thought of cinema would keep open the tensions and contradictions of the eÂects and functionality of representation, but by deploying a pragmatic approach to language the sign becomes continuous with the material practices, or aÂections, of the body that an assemblage viably connects.27 I will explore this dual line of thought by considering diÂerent relations of motion among technologies of the body that I argue are transforming contemporary Bollywood within and through the very idioms of that cinema. The biopolitics of Bollywood’s assemblage elicits correlated eÂects of power at the autonomic level of the preindividual,28 in habits and collective enunciations that give a specific rhythm to its subjectivities and organizes its aÂects, fantasies, pleasures, and consumer pedagogies around a series of recurring processes peculiarly suited to the needs of a liberalizing postcolonial economy. At the same time, these processes are potentialized (excess\n\n14 Introduction\n\nas unpredictable but patterned trajectories) by the proliferation, or better, contagion of a diÂuse counterfeit economy. Throughout the mediascape of globalizing India we are becoming attuned to a moment of radical flux and profound retrenchments. We can discern the abstract potentialization of human technological matter and material capture as idealized abstraction, or put in another way, media syn­ aesthesia as corporate logo. One consequence of this conjuncture is that all modes of potentializing excess in the body (aÂectivity) are always also open to various mechanisms of branding aÂect in the global economy. Thus the media assemblage of globalizing India finds new functionalities, dynamic thresholds, and articulations at a moment when we must see that recent economic and financial crises throughout the world have created disturbing and volatile social eÂects by correlating unemployment, massive displacements of populations, poverty, and social and political unrest. The recent ouster of the Hindu chauvinist government in India (fronted by the Bharatiya Janata Party [bjp]) by emergent and residual social forces—both from the Left and the Right, not to mention in the capitalist-oriented diaspora—shows that India has been profoundly aÂected by these global changes. Is the present moment, then, merely another case of what Antonio Gramsci once symptomatized as the specific liminality of the 1930s in fascist Europe? That, as Gramsci put it, the “old is dying and the new cannot be born: in this interregnum a great variety of morbid symptoms appear.”29 Morbid? Yes, if we realize with what aÂectivity—those multiple fluxes that vibrate, interrupt, and reassemble with qualitatively diÂerent intensities—this morbidity functioned under fascism, indeed at the level of aÂect such morbidity, even at its most murderous, was all life, nonnarrative vibrations moving through bodies and populations and moving them in unexpected ways. Yes as well, if we can think of the dis-ease of morbidity as contagion, as an unfolding process of constitutive openness, a sense of volatile bodies—the nexus of indetermination—framing perception before, and then beyond perception. A return to the event of framing, its virtuality, its constitutive outside (to think creatively with both Mark Hansen and Fredric Jameson—I will return to both thinkers in subsequent chapters),30 this interregnum—this between-regimes—is the temporality we will attempt to address in a new thought of cinema’s re-mediatization in the postcolonial context of Hindi-Urdu popular culture. The nonlinear dynamism of the globalizing media assemblage of Bollywood yields multiple and paradoxical eÂects. This new sensorium for transnational media technologies and industries unfolds at many levels. A sensorium is a particular regime not only of pleasure but more generally Introduction 15\n\nconstituted habituations of aÂect at the preindividual, subsensate level, keeping in mind that the preindividual is the mutational interface-limit between the subject and multiple populations.31 It is a thought that must begin with the digital in order to constitute the specificity of what it is in the process of displacing. This is the basic premise of all the chapters that follow. The diagram that emerges articulates a double movement of an untimely becoming. What are those untimely aÂects being created today through the multiple movements that constitute popular Hindi-Urdu media? The newmedia critic Mark B. N. Hansen, whose work I engage with in more detail in subsequent chapters, draws on the philosopher Gilbert Simondon to define aÂectivity as a mode of bodily experience that forms durations of dynamic connectivity through unstable because stochastic feedback loops. Between the individual and the preindividual, the personal and the impersonal, thought is drawn to aÂectivity: “Whereas perception appeals to structures already constituted in the interior of the individuated being, ‘aÂectivity indicates and comprises this relation between the individualized being and preindividual reality: it is thus to a certain extent heterogeneous in relation to individualized reality, and appears to bring it something from the exterior, indicating to the individualized being that it is not a complete and closed set [ensemble] of reality.’ ”32 In keeping with the general avant-gardist spirit of Deleuzian art and media criticism, Hansen takes the notion of aÂectivity in the direction of a new experience of human becoming media. My argument in this book will be that this mode of bodily experience is also the primary mode of branding popular media under globalization the world over, and that it is unfolding in India in singular ways, as both potentialization and containment, control and becoming. How do we live this double movement otherwise? It is toward creative indetermination as an activation of the singular openness of the body that an untimely experience of embodied media draws us. What is to become of Indian film criticism through such an engagement with the spatiotemporality of the body in the new media? As S¿ren M¿rk Petersen has recently noted, framing the various forms of media in relation to their material practices is nothing new, although it is seldom done. For instance, scholars in television studies have studied the physical and aural eÂects of watching television instead of only focusing on the content broadcasted; cyberculture critics have shown how the physical setting of Internet cafs is a part of the construction of gender, and how the placement of computers in the home demonstrates their primary use and which members of the family are using them.33 As Petersen argues, these analyses follow tech16 Introduction\n\nnologies becoming mundane and habitual and chart how new connectivities subtly alter the perception of our embodied timespaces. These processes inform all aspects of contemporary life across heterogeneous populations, and thus call for a multidisciplinary framework: in a phase transition, where the ontologies (durations) of consumption are serially tweaked producing quantum eÂects, a pragmatic combination of disciplinary formations helps to illuminate diÂerent facets of this new assemblage. In this study, then, media studies oÂers a body neurally implicated in audiovisual technologies of memory; postcolonial studies oÂers the critique of global capital as a violent and value-yielding machining of gendered, raced, and sexed population flows and the subjugation of historical contents and forms of sociality; feminist literary studies oÂers an attention to the resonances of narrative unfolding the expressions of a dissociated self, with an insistence on the material eÂects of language in and through the situated body; and political philosophy oÂers the strategies of correlating bodies and technologies as biopower. Foucault, in his 1978 lecture “Security, Territory, Population,” defined this last concept as “the set of mechanisms through which the basic biological features of the human species became the object of a political strategy.”34 It is in fact biopower that brings together these disparate lines of enquiry by directing our attention to the aspects of preindividual forms of power, where sensation vibrates in the creative indeterminacy between habit and its repetition. In this time of deterritorializing and reterritorializing media how is it that Hindi-Urdu cinema has come to assume the characteristics of a “national” cinema, and has done so for the first time? For unlike most national cinemas throughout the later half of the twentieth century, Hindi-Urdu commercial cinema was never a state-sponsored project. Tom O’Regan defines national cinemas as “simultaneously an aesthetic and production movement, a critical technology, a civic project of state, an industrial strategy and an international project formed in response to the dominant international cinemas (particularly but not exclusively Hollywood cinema).”35 Now clearly popular, Hindi-Urdu cinema has been organized by a commercial ethic, one that, even when it was one with a nationalist or postcolonial civic project, maintained the necessity of the commercial character of Bombay filmmaking (these contradictions and legacies are still quite legible in censorship practices, as I show in chapter 3). On the one hand, as I shall argue, “Bollywood” (and I am fully aware of the gross inadequacies of this term) has never had a deeper global market penetration, and the impact of south Indian film populations, specifically south Indian directors, on Bombay cinema has enabled its Introduction 17\n\nentry into many new circuits. On the other hand, given the massive surge in Hollywood ticket sales spurred by the multiplex boom (2 billion rupees, in 2006), Bollywood is also confronting the gradual weakening of its own market dominance by becoming a “national” commercial cinema (even as nonHindi–based cinemas in the south and in West Bengal continue, reinvent, and deepen their own regional dominance). These multiple becomings have their own speeds, and nothing but a teleology could yield predictions at a moment of such thoroughgoing restructurings. I will, however, suggest certain tendencies in the social, bodily, technological, institutional, and commercial reorganization of Hindi-Urdu popular media, each of which has a duration that penetrates the others, thereby forming new “contact actions” and new relations of motion. For example, the contact action among digital technologies, new intellectual property laws (digital rights management), and encryption algorithms has yielded a new regime of capture and passage within the media assemblage, and the experience of media in India has been transformed by these elements of its ecology because they have expanded, accelerated, and controlled the capacities (aÂects) of production, circulation, and consumption.36 Building on the notion of the “production of locality” in the apparatuses of globalization by Hardt and Negri, this articulation of contact actions by processes of assembling media ecologies is the site of a double movement of homogenization (overcoding of information and identities) and heterogenization (marketable diÂerence but also unpredictable potentialization).37 Within such a regime of overcoding and potentialization it is all the more necessary to follow closely the emergence of preindividual embodied perception and temporalities of consumption; these processes continue to deform and reform the topography of India’s media assemblage. One important place to diagram this aÂective restructuring is in the creative engagement with processes of “branding” in piracy cultures. Taking this example as paradigmatic, the argument throughout this study is that an ecology of sensation specific to India’s experience of globalization is restructuring and refunctioning the temporalities of Hindi-Urdu media experience. What is at stake is the specific conception and practice not only of the temporal processes of “sexual becoming,”38 but more radically of habituated dispositions toward the very future itself: insurance and astrology meet Bollywood in a new ecology of sensation (cf. chapter 4). My research into exhibition practices and film population norms in a “nonmetro” north Indian city, Bhopal, and my interviews with South Asian Bollywood fans in the New York metropolitan area have focused on India’s new media assemblage.39 The analysis of 18 Introduction\n\nsuch an assemblage calls for a method that focuses on the changing nature (or functionality) of specific kinds of connectivities (or intervals) between bodies—technological bodies, (non)human bodies, filmic bodies, and pulsive, proprioceptive bodies—toward a biogrammatics of media intervals. A media interval is an emergent property of variously connected flows, human and nonhuman energy, capital, timespaces, and image-sound flows. In one of its capacities it functions as a gateway tracking the gradients of the very flows from which it emerges. Intervals thus organize these flows, and by assembling novel mechanisms and forms of connectivity and resonance they establish a phase separation from the flows through which they emerge. Intervals are the qualitative durations constituting the continuous multiplicity of a media assemblage, their mode of self-organization. Potential examples of such intervals are intermissions, shot length, exhibition schedules, rates of data transmission, attention spans, event anticipation, the public lifespan of a media stream (“catchy” media), and the evolution of a given media habituation. Obviously such a capacious notion of the interval can easily become so diÂuse as to lose its analytic force, where any randomized gap in a flow becomes a decisive interval. It is important then to specify a set of concepts (drawn largely from biopower analyses) that can help us adjudicate the important interval from the unimportant one. First, media intervals are stochastic and patterned; as gradient-tracking gateways for a heterogeneous set of flows they organize statistically controlled populations of media culture that will always also swerve from their given trajectories (what I term in my conclusion clinamedia). Second, intervals render assemblages in perpetual nonequilibrium conditions, and yet they are more or less consistent over the lifespan of that singular assemblage. Third, and following from the second assumption, media assemblages are temporally bound structures through which definite sets and forms of information circulate, thereby producing variations that can form further novel assemblages (dissipative phase transitions). In these eddies of media various forms of energy and matter dissipate irreversibly through the interval gateway. Media assemblages are nonequilibrium dissipative structures,40 with turbulent and mutating image-sound forms (infolding processes) and neuronal resonances that self-organize through the operations of the interval.41 My contention, to be tested in the pages that follow, is that singular intervals reconfigure the fluctuations of media assemblages into contagious patterns of sensation, information, and resonance. This book comes out of the belief that contemporary film and media studies must address the kind of contagion that audiovisual movement Introduction 19\n\nhas become. Neither formalist analyses of film culture nor representational theories of subjectivation addresses the particular interval involved in the global becoming of control media: namely, the bodily dispensation of the digital. That untimely interval is in the production of aÂect, in the co-dependent emergence of human populations and media technologies. The interval happens in the very interaction of all the various elements of a media assemblage; those in-between processes through which constituting powers enable modes of negotiation and flight, processes that render relations of force at once most visible and least vulnerable. (That is also why diÂerent strategies of writing are called for to inhabit the same book.) It is in the interval, says Giorgio Agamben, where the question of the biopolitical subject itself can be posed. The interval is neither an absence or lack nor merely production; instead, it is a remainder. The interval subject can only be conceived “in terms of a process of subjectivation and desubjectivation— or rather as an interval or remainder between these processes.”42 It is here, in the emergent capacities of biological life, which is radically repurposed across the processes and technological substrates of media assemblages, that following Agamben, Deleuze, and Foucault we locate a certain ambiguity, a risk. This ambiguity is to diagram the event of media assemblages as an untimely becoming: to go, as Deleuze states, “back into the event, to take one’s place in it as in a becoming, to grow both young and old in it at once, going through all its components and singularities. Becoming isn’t part of history; history amounts [to] only the set of preconditions, however recent, that one leaves behind in order to ‘become,’ that is, to create something new.”43 To take a risk beyond calculation or the promise of security, to move thought along another trajectory traversing the political, biological life and remediated aÂects, is to give oneself to the promise of a future that remains untimely.\n\n20 Introduction\n\none\n\n“First Day, First Show”: Bollywood Cinemagoing and the New Sensorium\n\n“First day, first show.” It’s a common phrase throughout India, sure to bring a smile to both speaker and interlocutor: a recognizable coding of one of South Asian cinema’s singular events. It conjures up images of Bollywood faithfuls gathering, struggling, and scrambling to be one of the elect few to say, coolly, “Dekhli [saw it]—first day, first show.” In this quintessentially Indian experience, one that is being re-created by new media practices and global consumerist habituations, we can see how fans from economically and socially diverse communities are renegotiating older structures of film and media culture today. Over the past six years, I have had the privilege to explore this film culture in various sites in India (Bhopal, Mumbai, Bangalore, Delhi), the United States (Times Square and Jackson Heights in New York, and Artesia in California), and the United Kingdom (Birmingham, Manchester, and London). The chapters that follow build on these sitespecific encounters, drawing most heavily from my extended research into new media assemblages in Bhopal—the City of Lakes and the capital of Madhya Pradesh. Bhopal is a city that was torn through by a rampaging death-gas secreted by a Union Carbide plant in December 1984, which killed thousands and thousands of mostly poor Muslim people within hours, and which continues to claim the lives of fifteen people each month. It is also the city of my birth and home to my father’s extended upper-caste, middle-class Hindu family. Historically it was a walled-in city ruled for over a century by the Begums of Bhopal, the Muslim descendants of its founder the Afghan\n\nDost Mohammed Khan. Today, Bhopal is a segregated city: the old gated city, home to the now minority Muslim population, is overwhelmingly poor and overcrowded; the new Bhopal, Hindu dominated, is home to politicians, state legislators, landowners, businesspeople, and Dominos Pizza (and the Dalit workers who service them).1 Of the thirteen movie theaters in the city (all owned by Sikhs or Hindus), only three of them are in new Bhopal. The rest are all in the Muslim-majority areas of the erstwhile walled city. The diÂerence is not only in location but can be seen in terms of numerous factors such as accessibility (quality of roads, density of traÂic, availability of parking, etc.), regular programming clientele (“family” or soft porn genres, all-male clientele or gender mixed; single teenagers or families; poor, middle class, or rich; day or night crowds; Muslim or Hindu), services (box oÂice, types of intermission snacks, ushers and “crowd control,” cleanliness of toilets, lighting, drinking water), and theater “attractions” (Dolby sound, star and director visits, faade design, mtv-style digital advertisements and billboards, date of construction, style of architecture; condition of balcony, dress circle, stall seats; climate control via fans vs. water-cooled air, privatized dedicated power generators, etc.). This spectrum of diÂerences indexes the emergence of a new kind of connectivity across the multiple dynamic thresholds of media technologies, cultural forms, subjectivities, neighborhoods, regions, nations, ideologies, and perception; it indexes as well the complex relationship between the new media and the changing strategies of India’s globalizing elites. Very simply, all these new connectivities imply a fundamental shift in the sensations of cinema. Certainly today cinematic practices, not just the cinematic image, are indissociable from the Internet, Dolby sound, or satellite tv as folds of each other. And certainly the form of bodily attention— ­exteroception, proprioception,2 interoception; in short, aÂect—produced through the cinematic sound-image and its constitutive intervals (practices, institutions, sensori-motor circuits, and spatiotemporalities) has fundamentally changed in being folded into the new media. Thus, if a qualitatively diÂerent human-media interface is coming into dominance through these technologies and the active bodies of media consumers, then the thought of cinema itself must change. We chart these becomings through diagramming the body’s sensations in and through the nonlinear dynamics of this new media assemblage. But whose body? And which media technologies? In response, two initial “method” problems present themselves. First, does this suggest that all bodies, regardless of gender, religion, class, caste, race, sexuality, etc. 24 Chapter One\n\nare equally implicated in this new dynamic threshold? Second, does this assume that satellite, Internet, and cable, etc. have transformed the totality of film-media culture in postcolonial India where access to and knowledge of such technologies are themselves technologies of social and economic exclusion and control? To my mind these two questions should be reposed as: How can we think of the transformation in Bollywood cinema’s ecology of sensation in the era of its new media assemblage as a qualitatively diÂerent kind of solicitation of the body’s essential creativity, its openness as a center of indetermination—in short, its virtuality? Simultaneously, how can we think of the assemblage’s specific form of power—as a violent machining, as the reproduction and containment, or reframing of deeply entrenched and repeatedly produced inequalities, clichs, and habituations across heterogeneous populations, a human multiplicity structured in dominance? Throughout this study I attempt to hold these lines of critique in productive tension: namely, Bollywood’s global media assemblage as a historically specific unfolding of virtualization-containment, the unpredictable but patterned emergence of new media habituations. This approach follows through on Bernard Stiegler’s startling suggestion that a “people”—ethnic, racial, national, regional, populational—is not defined by its past (memory, culture, traditions, “genius”) but by its future; that is, by the line of mutation that orients it to a technologically constitutive outside, by its assembling along a machinic phylum. I will return to the question of the machinic phylum in the next chapter. Here I take up my initial point of departure and pursue some founding elements of this changing diagram of media, exhibition space, bodies, and power: Bollywood’s biogram.3 Consider the site for this first day, first show: Jhumpa Talkies. Like thousands of other ardent fans I went to the first day, first show of Mohabbatein at Jhumpa, which is located in the Jahangirabad section of Bhopal— an overwhelmingly poor, and largely Muslim section of town. As such, I was warned repeatedly that there would be a mad rush for tickets and I was incurring needless danger by venturing into that part of town. Jahangirabad has a reputation: it is a highly policed subsection of the city, known as much for its narrow, potholed, underserviced streets and overcrowded slums as for the crime that, say the police, justifies their continual presence. In 1992, in the wake of the demolition of the Babri Masjid by Hindu nationalists, it was this neighborhood that was first engulfed by communal violence. The hostility subsequently spread throughout old Bhopal, where it was aided and abetted by the police and the army.4 Eight months after the screening “First Day, First Show” 25\n\nof Mohabbatein at Jhumpa, this same neighborhood movie hall would become the site of renewed communal violence as the blockbuster Gadar (dir. Sharma, 2001) sparked a national controversy by its chauvinist depiction of the partition of India and Pakistan. But that was all yet to come, or it was already in the narrativized past. It was the day after Diwali, and I made arrangements with my eighteenyear-old friend Abhishek (a lower-middle-class, upper-caste Hindu who never misses a first day, first show) to meet me at 10 am. I got to Jhumpa before he did—but not nearly early enough, even though the show was supposed to be at 12:30. By 10 am the line for the balcony seats, dress circle, and box seats was already beyond the outer gate. There were hundreds of people, mostly men, milling about the courtyard. Jhumpa is a single-screen theater, with seating for around twelve hundred. It is built in the molded concrete style of late 1970s and early 1980s movie halls in Bhopal—namely, a cross of classical art deco and administrative functionalism where shooting molded spires tiled with crumbling marble frame impassive grey blocks that are hidden behind faded white and red lime-paint. There are no fewer than three gates through which one must pass in order to get inside the theater: the outer gate leads into the hexagonal courtyard, whose centerpiece is the gnarled remains of an ancient tree; the heavily guarded theater gate leads into the inner courtyard lined with refreshment stands; and the final gate leads inside to the dress circle and stalls on the first floor, or up the staircase streaked in red paan juice to the balcony and box seats.5\n\nThe Connectivity of Art Deco Here I will pause to consider the relations of motions established between a particular design style and exhibition timespace. Generally, the design of the art deco talkie in India is thus a series of enfolded half circles that funnel through strategic gates of passage and blockage, with the molded facades oÂering modernity, speed, and intensive image-sound. Art deco had a singular life in the Indian media assemblage; in spilling far beyond exhibition space it links experiences of consumption through a postcolonial temporality, and I will consider it a form of connectivity in this assemblage. No doubt, in its dominant spatial aesthetic, cinema in India has always been associated with a spatial and temporal disjuncture. Here the postcolonial temporalities of colonial materiality—European technology, African primitivist design, and a modernizing drive into the past and future at once— connect with the sensational intervals produced in the event of this material 26 Chapter One\n\nassemblage’s functioning. It is not that the movement from village to city to diaspora and back is recapitulated or resembles the disjuncture of the stylized body within cinema and the disciplined body within exhibition space. Rather, we can speak of nested temporalities that have their own aÂordances in relation to various populations of material and phenomena. The movement invoked by the modernist ethos of the post-1950s talkie should be understood as a pedagogy of national belonging and a reductive coding (or subtractive image) of a potentializing excess of sensation. Taken together this combination could be seen as an extension of what Gilles Deleuze calls cinema’s sensory-motor schemata, but already this implies that we are no longer only considering what is specific to cinema but also what is specific about its becoming something else—a media assemblage. Consider the articulation (functional connectivity as dynamic feedback loop) of visual and musical style and exhibition space: India’s art deco talkies deform into the globalized multiplex.6 If we compare, for instance, the diverse visual and aural styles of Bimal Roy’s Devdas (1955) and Sanjay Leela Bhansali’s Devdas (2002) with the art deco talkies of the 1950s and the multiplex of today’s globalizing India, we can discern how diÂerently the media body can be articulated with cinematic space (I will return to these cinematic examples in the next chapter). Art deco was a popular international trend that surfaced in Europe between 1910 and 1935. As a ubiquitous aesthetic style, art deco aÂected all aspects of world design including fashion, crafts, housewares, jewelry, statuary, architecture, and interior decoration.7 Of heterogeneous origins with multiple branches, art deco was insistently modern, and as such it formed an assemblage with the machine age in its technologies, imagery, and graphics. As Lucy Fischer notes, not only did art deco adopt “a rhetoric of the mechanical,” it also utilized new technologies of fabrication. In its commercial production, art deco employed synthetic materials like plastic (Bakelite, Lucite, Vitrolite) and metal (chrome, stainless steel, aluminum, and wrought iron). Stylistically, art deco was known for its streamlined, geometric, and symmetrical patterns—traits associated with Western industrialization. In keeping with art deco’s stark high-tech facades, color was often reduced to the basics: black, white, and silver. Not unlike modernism itself, art deco was tied to the city and thus deemed the “skyscraper style.” In its articulation of Western modernity, art deco also echoed various avant-garde movements. Through constructivism and futurism, technology became central to art deco’s form; from cubism came a practice of pure form itself; and from German expressionism came distortion eÂects.8 “First Day, First Show” 27\n\n2.

Rai.\n\nMore significant in terms of its colonial and postcolonial deployment, art deco also assembled disjunctive temporal dispositions—enfolding its futurist tendencies into a pronounced fetishism for the “primeval.” Like many styles of the era, it was influenced by what Euro-American elite culture understood as “traditional and even primal forms.” Specifically, art deco evinced a fascination with the racialized and “primitive” other, as rendered through a litany of tropes. In Fischer’s words: “From Egypt where King Tutankhamen’s tomb had been discovered in 1922, Deco embraced Pharaonic imagery (from sphinx heads and scarabs to cats). From the broader Middle East, Deco recycled the Assyrian/Babylonian ziggurat structure—a pyramidal, terraced tower. So popular was this motif (as the base of furniture or objets d’art) that an entire strain of Deco came to be known as ‘zigzag moderne.’ From pre-Columbian Mexico, Deco drew upon the sunray image; and from Africa, it took the stylized mask as well as such materials as ivory and animal skins (zebra and tiger).”9 Colonial flows of commodities, images, populations, and desire gave form to art deco by enfolding coded temporalities of exotic primitivism with the material duration of its substances, spaces, and media events. In these disjunctures a diagram of a postcolonial untimely emerges, with interruptions of linear progress embedded or nested in the intervals of its material and expressive form. Art deco formed a machinic assemblage with Hollywood from its inception. Art deco greatly influenced set design through the work of a series of art directors associated with particular studios (e.g., Van Nest Polglase at rko, Stephen Gooson at Fox, and Cedric Gibbons at mgm). As Fischer notes, art deco left its stamp not only on film costuming (especially that of women),10 but even the physiognomy of actors was used to create art decoinspired designs. Further, an aesthetic of art deco informed the graphic idiom of many movie posters of the era as well as the font and layout of studio logos (rko and Twentieth Century-Fox, for example). Finally, art deco had a tremendous eÂect on the architectural design of American movie theaters, especially those elegant and luxurious spaces (such as Radio City Music Hall in New York) known as picture palaces. Donald Albrecht suggests that the ubiquity of the art deco mode on movie screens helped to popularize contemporary design in America: “The adoption of architectural modernism by the popular arts had [a] notable eÂect. . . . It successfully promoted the modern style to the general public, making it both more accessible and more palatable.”11 In this light, look at art deco palaces like Eros, New Empire, or Regal Talkies in Mumbai (and recall that art deco was the style of choice for “First Day, First Show” 29\n\ntalkies throughout much of India well into the 1970s). On a more modest scale, consider the Eagle Theater in Jackson Heights, Queens (made famous perhaps most recently by Suketu Mehta in his memoir of a diasporic’s life in Maximum City),12 or the design of three film posters from Homi Wadia productions: Lootaru Lalna (dir. Homi Wadia, 1938), The Return of Toofan Mail (dir. Aspi, 1942), and Magroor (dir. R. D. Mathur, 1950). In these theaters, the bodies invited to take their place in such monuments to urban modernity were epic, echoing, modernizing bodies—these image-sound-spaces give oÂ desires of a directional, intentional movement and a buÂered reverberation of sound. The lines of these beautiful structures give the impression of a rapid march, or better, a race into the future; as such, they play on and articulate the motion of the movement-image itself— of, say, the 1950s Hindi-Urdu social film, one of the most popular genres of this cinema, and one centered on the unfolding of a narrative space that was simultaneously linear and iconic. Keep in mind here Ravi Vasudevan’s famous deployment of Geeta Kapur’s notion of the iconic. He argued that the aesthetics of frontality and iconicity arises from mass visual culture, in instances ranging from the relationship between deity and devotee to the enactment of religious tableaux and their representation in popular artworks such as calendars and posters. When I refer to the iconic mode, I use the term not in its precise semiotic sense to identify a relation of resemblance, but rather as a category derived from Indian writing in art history that has been employed to identify a meaningful condensation of image. The term has been used to situate the articulation of the mythic within painting, theater, and cinema, and it could be conceived of as a cultural work that seeks to bind a multilayered dynamic into a unitary image. In Kapur’s definition, the iconic is “an image into which symbolic meanings converge and in which moreover they achieve stasis.”13 All three of the film posters mentioned above are deeply influenced by the framing devices of art deco,14 and as such they attempt diÂerent multilayered bindings to yield the unitary image. In the first, the exotic decomoderne costume of the action legend Fearless Nadia (Mary Evans Wadia) is supplemented with a montage of equestrian action shots, while the stitched double frame forms arrows of motion. In The Return of Toofan Mail the painted photographic heads of the lovers hover above the linear action of gun, train, and masked avenger. In the colorized Magroor, the bright strip of film and the scaled headshots mix frontality with the eÂect of contoured waves of color. Thus, in the art deco–cinema assemblage that produces bodily eÂects through both built space and image montage, the stasis of the iconic itself 30 Chapter One\n\n4.

We might say that this is its immediacy and its intuited felt sensation, an almost hectic motion. On the one hand, and at the level of nationalist ideological coding, this intuition of movement is transfigured through the nationalist image of a postcolonial nation that had existed forever but was nonetheless rapidly developing through fixed five-year plans.15 On the other hand, given its promiscuous anti-traditionalism, its hybrid genealogies, and its explicit ties to modern scripts of gender and sexuality, Indian art deco’s iconic frontality is persistently in excess of nationalist pedagogies, which gave it its irresistible aura of transgression. And that is why space becomes intensive aÂect, an interval internal to the multiplicity of relations becomes operative throughout the assemblage. Moreover, if we consider Bollywood’s art deco in terms of aural style—one that always doubles and departs from the iconic image—we can chart more broadly the heterogeneous eÂects at the level of the body of the kinds of nationalist primitivisms and pan-Asian hybridisms that marked the global musical repertoires of such brilliant music directors as S. D. Burman (with Dev Anand), Shankar Jaikishen (with Raj Kapoor), Naushad (with Dilip Kumar), and O. P. Nayar (with Guru Dutt). No rigorous consideration of art deco in 1950s Indian cinema can overlook the specificity of the songand-dance track as it provided both the quintessential staging ground for art deco’s aesthetic and also the potential for an entirely diÂerent kind of excess (the O. P. Nayar-Shammi Kapoor connection, with its creative mixtures of cabaret rumba rhythms, bhangra folk dances, and “light” pop music, would be exemplary in this regard). Returning to my initial argument, we see that forms of connectivity— in this case between exhibition space, design style, and aural hybridity— enable specific relations of motion across a media assemblage. At the level of meaning and ideology, particular codings of iconicity take on aÂective actions as bodies moved through and are moved by the events (pathwaysblockages, surface-screens: intervals) of a given assemblage. In these spaces where narratives unfold, media intervals distribute bodily intensity and qualitative duration, which feed back to modulate diÂerent elements of the assemblage and thus form gradients of various flows. Here distinctions between public and private space, modernity and the primitive, and stasis and flow enter into mobius-strip formations, inhere in each other as elements of each other, and produce zones of creative indetermination. The art deco talkie was one such zone, and in India the serial events associated with art deco yielded intensive populations of consumers who were habituated not through an image or story but through the patterns of pragmatic interac32 Chapter One\n\ntions within the assemblage. The swerve of such self-organizing patterns (the clinamen, or swerve, in media: clinamedia) is unpredictable, and it is in that irreducible chance of something going awry that we can say once again that such media events exceed their actualization.\n\nSituating First Day, First Show Let us pursue this patterning of interactions in the case of the first day, first show I attended. I found, to my surprise, that the experience of “first day, first show” can be a rather strenuous physical activity that demands diÂerent kinds of strategies for success. Success here is defined as occupying a ticketed seat with your acquaintances as the lights go out. This was something I learned when I tried to attend the first show of Mohabbatein (dir. Aditya Chopra, 2000). At the time (October 2000), there had been a series of films that had roared through Bhopal—Dil Pe Mat Le Yaar, Shikari, Aaghaz, Dhai Akshar Prem Ke, Jis Desh Mein Ganga Rehta Hai, etc.—all of which received little attention. Indeed, both Aaghaz and Dil Pe Mat Le Yaar ran for only about one week (although both would later have an indefinite lifespan on satellite and cable tv in north India and in the Hindi-Urdu–speaking diaspora). The critics all declared that the audiences (the “masses” and the “classes,” the classic audience binary in Indian film journalism) simply were not interested in any of the stories and precious few of the songs. But with the coming of Diwali (the Hindu New Year, and usually the season for new bigbudget film releases), things seemed to be diÂerent. A building curiosity about the new releases slowly crept through the city—the aÂective contagion of anticipation launched and spread by tv shows, film magazines like Stardust and Filmfare, radio shows, interviews, song prereleases, videos of the dance sequences, and rumors. And then the simultaneous release of Mission Kashmir (dir. Vidhu Vinod Chopra, 2000) starring Hrithik Roshan and Preity Zinta and the blockbuster Mohabbatein with Amitabh Bachchan, Shahrukh Khan, and Aishwarya Rai was like a filmgoer’s fantasy come true. Mohabbatein’s story is familiar, but it has a particular globalized twist. As a “remake” (in the hybridizing vein of recent Bombay cinema oriented toward the non-resident Indian, or nri) of Dead Poet’s Society (dir. Peter Weir, 1989), Mohabbatein, a neologism meaning “many loves,” tells the story of Gurukul College. The name references upper-caste Hindu institutions of Vedic learning, but in this cosmopolitan recasting the models are various elite north Indian boarding schools for boys such as the Doon School or Amitabh Bachchan’s own alma mater Sherwood College in Nainital.16 For the past “First Day, First Show” 33\n\ntwenty-five years, Gurukul’s imperious principal, Narayan Shankar—played by the megastar of the millennium, Amitabh—has run the college on “Parampara, Anushasan, aur Pratishta” (or tradition, discipline, and honor). In other words, he runs the college on fear. The boys fear him and he thinks that their fear is a sign of their devotion. As the story unfolds, three young men enrolled at Gurukul fall in love with three young women, two of whom are from the neighborhood and one is enrolled in the all-women’s college next door. They all know, however, that love is forbidden in Gurukul because years earlier a student had fallen in love with Narayan’s daughter and, without even talking to the student, Narayan expelled him from the college. In desperation, Narayan’s daughter Megha (Aishwarya Rai) committed suicide. Although the tragic event was long ago, the rumors linger and the girl’s ghost continues to haunt. Meanwhile, a music instructor, Raj Aryan (Shahrukh Khan), is hired. The instructor insists that love is the inspiration for music, and he encourages the three students to reject Narayan’s somber discipline and instead pursue their loves with abandon. After a series of catchy songs “picturized” in Switzerland, along with volatile dramatic scenes, we learn that Raj is none other than the luckless student whose love was sacrificed to Narayan’s stubbornness. And so the scene is set for the epic generational struggle between fear and love, tradition and postcolonialism; and with a title like Mohabbatein you can guess who wins in the end. It is a familiar narrative, with a familiar visual style. Yash Chopra (the producer and the director’s father) is legendary not only for his evolving visual style but also for the “exotic” locales of his movies. By “exotic” I mean European: Chopra was recently given an honorary citizenship by the government of Switzerland in recognition of the profound contribution his films have made to Swiss tourism; indeed, a lake was renamed in his honor.17 But Chopra also has diversified his exoticism of Europe—the actual setting for his idealized, Hinduized Gurukul is a palace near Wiltshire, England. Thus, part of what is being marketed as traditional Indian culture in Hindi films today is not simply a Sanskritized and chauvinistic brand of “na­tional” memory, but one with global ambitions as well. Keep in mind that more and more of the profits from high-budget “A-grade” Hindi films come from “foreign exchange”—that is, collections from overseas territories, mostly in the United Kingdom and in North America. We can, then, appreciate this other simple fact: the Hindi film industry has actually profited from the considerable devaluation of the rupee over the past twenty years. The situation puts this film industry in a particularly curious position: it selectively sells a chauvinistic brand of national culture, thereby paying its debts to (Hindu) 34 Chapter One\n\nnationalism, while its financial and profit base is increasingly oriented toward the centers of capitalist accumulation in the West (this is a tendency of profit accumulation as much as ideological alignment, and given the devaluation of the dollar globally, there may soon be a reorientation toward the euro). Thus the nation is involved in a double movement that, on the one hand, in its name and through its discourses attempts to secure the image to a certain normalizing pedagogy (Narayan’s “Parampara, Anushasan, aur Pratishta”), while on the other hand, floating or probabilistic logics of global risk assessment and the aÂective landscapes of an exoticized Europe deterritorialize cinema’s infrastructures. Call this new connectivity the denationalizing finances of Bollywood’s nationalist media assemblage. These codings, contagions, narratives, and images give expressive force to the act of procuring a ticket for first day, first show. Generally, ticket checking happens only at the gate, but on a first day, first show for such blockbusters as Mohabbatein the groundskeepers, ticket collectors, and police work together to mobilize the three gates and the outer and inner courtyards as modes of diÂerentiation, both population control and codification of desire. For us, standing in the back of an interminable queue and still in the outer courtyard, getting tickets seemed out of the question. I thus started looking around for other options. The nature of the gathering was a complex pattern of social relations and lines of force. Even the loiterers—those who weren’t in line, and probably had no hope or even desire to see the show—were hanging out and watching the crowd while partaking of, commenting on, and contributing to the festival-like atmosphere and its specific spectacles. But the loiterers were almost entirely men, and this is an important aspect of how urban space and masculine performativity give to the event of media exhibition the suspense of an open threat.18\n\nLoitering and the Swerves of Media The loiterer at the scene of exhibition is male, urban, working class, and often from subaltern castes. This “subject” can easily become the agent of a romantic assimilation of loitering within an idealized discourse of cinema culture’s resistance to bourgeois norms. But what if first and foremost loitering as a practice internal to the swerve of media is situated within varying sets of functionalities, sensations, gradients, norms, identities, capacities, and connectivities? This view would also include thinking historically of the evolution of the habituations of a media assemblage, the history of ecologies of sensation. I will return to the question of loitering in the next “First Day, First Show” 35\n\nchapter, where I trace the emergence of the “malltiplex” in liberalizing India. Here I would like to anticipate that argument by noting that the malltiplex comes largely from the set of practices associated with the single-screen talkie, which in turn emerged from forms of consumption and circulation embedded in precolonial and colonial Indian bazaar culture. More specifically, habituations of media such as loitering have enfolded the bazaar into the bourgeois public sphere at the level of the autonomic body. But this is not without mutation: my contention is that the talkie and the malltiplex should be understood as diÂerent technologies of biopolitical control as well as embodiments for the creative indetermining of the very regimes that give them a relative stability. This is so because the assemblage of media that is the talkie or the malltiplex reorders time and sensation at the aÂective interface between bodies in population and technological evolution. In thinking through the diagram of this emergence, we are led to consider the ethnographic and historical work of Kajri Jain, Sandria Freitag, Woodman Taylor, Stephen Hughes, Rajat Kanta Ray, Christopher Pinney, and others who argue for a movement away from the static discourses of sovereign individualism to the embodied practices of value that circulate in the stratified but dynamic networks of Indian bazaar culture.19 Most of these scholars have focused almost exclusively on the relationship between indigenous forms of vision and image circulation in colonial and postcolonial contexts by exploring the scopophilic mechanisms relating drishti, nazar, bhakti, and darshan (all diÂerent figurations of vision within Hindu and Muslim popular and sacred culture) to the materiality of the visual. In pursuing the implications for embodiment, I argue that the imagistic regimes of circulation that constitute the dynamism of the bazaar should be put into a broader media ecology or assemblage. One way of doing this is by following through on Kajri Jain’s brilliant suggestion that the bazaar calendar image is not simply a text or sign to be read but rather a circulating or animated object that “as the common element between diÂerent constellations of value, draws them into a relationship where it becomes possible for value to switch tracks, to jump from one economy to another, drawing their subjects into each other’s networks.” She continues: “For the heterogeneous genealogies I have described do not inhabit diÂerent spaces, nor do they inhabit the same rectangular space of an image printed on cheap, flimsy paper. As modes of value they must form themselves as fleeting constellations between the image, other bodies or objects, and the quality, rhythm and intensity of time at a given moment. It is these heterogeneous qualities of time within postcolonial modernity that lie beyond what meets the ocularcentric eye.”20 Jain’s 36 Chapter One\n\n6. Sidewalk bazaar in Mumbai, 2004.

Rai.\n\nwork helps us, first, to question the privileging of vision in contemporary accounts of embodiment in popular culture in India; second, to situate the materiality of temporality in the rhythms of embodied practices; and finally, to explore the heterogeneous production of value across these relations of motion. In this chapter and the next, I take up Jain’s challenge to South Asian media studies by focusing on the changing practices of loitering and “time pass” in the contemporary movement from the talkie to the malltiplex. In its practices, popular Hindi-Urdu cinema has become a loitering technology. Loitering, in fact, is its mode of becoming, but this is what it has incorporated from the assemblages from which it has evolved. In bazaars or mandis, and then later at first day, first show screenings, or in the cinema lobby during intermission, loitering created self-organizing (patterned but unpredictable) traÂic: jams, exchanges, interruptions, muscle contractions and extensions, density, gazes, clusters, and aÂective and population flows. Loitering is what popular media does in its nonlinear circulation. Through it and in it, the body waits for incoming and ongoing connections and modulated connectivities, the movements of which have defined class, caste, and gender power, or gradients of access across technological platforms and exhibition spaces in India. As we shall see, the occasion of first day, first show is an assemblage of bodies, some loitering and some “authorized,” waiting for the inaugural unfolding of a media event. The authorized bodies either hold a ticket or go about acquiring one by standing in the queue or buying from scalpers. The loiterers are what give the first day, first show its mela-like (or festival) quality. Loiterers come mostly for the spectacle, and in standing, sitting, leaning, wandering—fokat mein (the colloquial Prakritderived phrase meaning having no exchange value)—without definite purpose or intention, they add density to the scene of exhibition. The first showings, indeed the first weekend, determine the future of any given film: a full house on the first weekend is the sign positive of a healthy return on investment, and the black marketeers whose money laundering schemes are the financial life of Bombay cinema breathe a sigh of relief. This assemblage is today undergoing a qualitative change, a phase transition as indigenous financial infrastructures and aesthetic forms are transformed by transnational capital, Hollywood production companies, new insurance products, and the synergies of the new media. What are the coordinates of this changing media topology that derives new value as it were fokat mein? As a modality of nonlinear dynamics, loitering could be situated within a genealogy stretching back to the creation of an indigenous capitalist class in the colonial bazaar of the late nineteenth century and the 38 Chapter One\n\n8.

Rai.\n\ntwentieth, or indeed back further to the precolonial bazaar, to the proliferation of bhakti cults, and also to the experience of bhava in rasa theory. The weekly bazaars, the seasonal melas, the marketing towns or mandis, and the holiday festivals that punctuated and gave rhythm to indigenous production between rabi and kharif (or spring and autumn) crops throughout the twentieth century were in fact media assemblages. As one colonial report on Chalisgaon taluka (in Maharasthra) in the 1890s put it: “The local bazaars . . . in the district are of very little importance as places for the disposal of any but small parcels of produce, the ryots [agricultural workers] re­sort to them as an outing, to hear the news, and to meet friends and acquaintances [more] than for serious business.” Or consider another even more telling colonial account of Taloda’s (Maharasthra) weekly bazaar in the late nineteenth century: No more picturesque scene can be imagined than Taloda marketplace on Friday. On one side are piles of sugarcane, chillies and vegetables of diÂerent kinds, with heaps of wheat, gram, linseed and other grain. The main road is fringed with dealers on the smallest scale from copper moneychangers to venders of whiÂs of tobacco, whose stock-in-trade can be reckoned in piece. In the main marketplace, under white canvas booths are cloths of all kinds and colours, brass and copper vessels, stone and glass beads, brass and tin bracelets, armlets, anklets and all the other rings with which the Bhil damsel adorns herself, kerosine, oil, and the hundred and one trifles into which the tinsmiths’ ingenuity twists its tin cases, cheap cutlery, looking-glasses and Birmingham toys. The crowd is as varied as the wares. Guzars, Marathas, Gujarati Banias, Marwadis, Bhils of the plains, Powras from the Akrani with their quaintly bedecked womenfolk, and that village shy-lock, the Rohilla, besides coppersmiths, carpenters, potters and other artisans jostle one another, haggling and bargaining in their languages and as many patois, and raising a din and an atmosphere as diÂicult to describe as to forget. Considerable number of Powras attend the market, bringing grain and jungle produce such as charoli seed, mhowra flowers, honey, bees’ wax, lac, gum and resin. As there is no cart trade from the Akrani, produce of all kinds has to be brought on bullock or by head loads.21 In other words, people came to the local bazaars to check the prices, to relax their minds and bodies, to feel new sensations in the circulation of goods and rumors, or to just be and become. Now each of these elements of this media assemblage—price, mental state, aÂect-sensation, being and 40 Chapter One\n\nbecoming—is in fact translated by one word in Hindi: bhava. Indeed, bhava seems particularly relevant to understanding the stratified resonances of the loitering media assembled in the bazaar. As an experience of both value production and aÂective potentiality, bhava would be a kind of nonlinear movement from stimulus (vibhava), autonomic response (anubhava), and conscious reaction (vyabhicari bhava).22 The broad semantic range of bhava in Hindi today helps us to configure loitering in its various aspects, or in other words as a mode of the nonlinear. My argument here is that loitering is the general condition of aÂectivity—that is, of capturing value and producing sensation—of the media assembling body in the ecology of sensation that traverses the single-screen talkie to the contemporary malltiplex. This parceling of time, its divisibility and its continuous rhythms, acts on the body directly, producing both new habituations as well as potentially new assemblages. Loitering is the very condition of evolution in media assemblages. And the coils of control are in these relations of motion,23 which is to say that the analysis of a media assemblage such as Bollywood can take no comfort in intellectual production as “resistance” retrieval.24 The loitering mode is at once precolonial, colonized, and postcolonial, as aÂective dispositions with very diÂerent histories fold into, or nested within, each other in the event of media. This means that loitering media is not a gaze reducible to a subject position, but a mechanism of connectivity, memory, interruption, pause, lingering, stuttering; and also “time pass” (I return to this phrase in the next chapter). Loitering is an aesthetic and a critique of bourgeois citizenship, even though the claim of belonging that may be legible in the practice cannot create an identity. Loitering always borders the misfit, a practice on the edges of propriety and property. This is why all loitering media traÂics in the pirated. It is the loitering nature of Indian media that has enabled the gradual but thoroughgoing refunctioning of every element of the assemblage itself: the shrinking of the average shot duration in editing practices globally, the emergence of the halting, jerky camera style in new multiplex-oriented genres, the transformation of the ittafaq image (chance-harmony becoming fate-risk; see chapter 4), and the quotidianization of characterization in Bollywood acting are all elements that form new resonances in loitering media technologies but without resemblance or metaphoric condensation. To be more specific, each of these new aspects of Bombay cinema has emerged because there has been a change in the diÂerent durations of media; a shift in its speed, acceleration, flow, direction; a change in a given domain of validity. A modulation of duration: loitering. Ea"
