The goal of this conference is to bring together researchers and practitioners from both academia and industry to focus on understanding the present-day security threats and to propose and discuss counter-measures to defend against such attacks. In the past few years, the enthusiastic participation of a large number of delegates in diﬀerent AIRCC–organized conferences, like the International Conference on Network Security and Applications (CNSA), International Conference on Networks and Communications (NECOM), International Conference on Web and Semantic Technology (WEST), International Conference on Wireless and Mobile Networks (WIMON), the First International Conference on Advances in Computing and Information Technology (ACITY), reﬂect the fact that the parent body of the Academy and Industry Research Collaboration Center (AIRCC) is successful in providing a platform toward promoting academic collaboration. We believe that this spirit of co-working was further strengthened during CNSA 2011. The CNSA 2011, NECOM 2011, WEST 2011, WIMoN 2011 and AICTY 2011 committees invited original submissions from researchers, scientists, engineers, and students that illustrate research results, projects, survey works, and industrial experiences describing signiﬁcant advances in the areas related to the relevant themes and tracks of the conferences. Thanks to the authors whose eﬀort as reﬂected in the form of a large number of submissions for CNSA 2011 on diﬀerent aspects of network security including Web security, cryptography, performance evaluations of protocols and security application, etc. All the submissions underwent a scrupulous peer-review process by a panel of expert reviewers. Besides the members of the Technical Committee, external reviewers were invited on the basis of their specialization and expertise. The papers were reviewed based on their technical content, originality, and clarity. The entire process, which includes the submission, review, and acceptance processes, was done electronically. This hard work resulted in the selection of high-quality papers that expand the knowledge in the latest developments in networks security and applications. There were a total of 1,285 submissions to the conference, and the Technical Program Committee selected 195 papers for presentation at the conference and subsequent publication in the proceedings. The book is organized as a collection of papers from the 4th International Conference on Network Security and Applications (CNSA 2011), the Third International Conference on Networks and Communications (NeCoM 2011), the Third International Conference on Web and Semantic Technology (WeST 2011), the Third International Conference on\n\nVI\n\nPreface\n\nWireless and Mobile Networks (WiMoN 2011), and the First International Conference on Advances in Computing and Information Technology (ACITY 2011). This small introduction incomplete would be without expressing our gratitude, and thanks to the General and Program Chairs, members of the Technical Program Committees, and external reviewers for their excellent and diligent work. Thanks to Springer for the strong support. Finally, we thank all the authors who contributed to the success of the conference. We also sincerely wish that all attendees beneﬁted academically from the conference and wish them every success in their research. David C.

This paper investigates the problem of output regulation of the unified chaotic system (Lu, Chen, Cheng and Celikovsky, 2002). Explicitly, state feedback control laws to regulate the output of the unified chaotic system have been derived so as to track the constant reference signals. The control laws are derived using the regulator equations of C.I. Byrnes and A. Isidori (1990), who solved the problem of output regulation of nonlinear systems involving neutrally stable exosystem dynamics. Numerical simulations are shown to illustrate the results. Keywords: Unified chaotic system, output regulation, nonlinear control systems, feedback stabilization.\n\n1 Introduction Output regulation of control systems is one of the very important problems in control systems theory. Basically, the output regulation problem is to control a fixed linear or nonlinear plant in order to have its output tracking reference signals produced by some external generator (the exosystem). For linear control systems, the output regulation problem has been solved by Francis and Wonham (1975, [1]). For nonlinear control systems, the output regulation problem has been solved by Byrnes and Isidori (1990, [2]) generalizing the internal model principle obtained by Francis and Wonham [1]. Byrnes and Isidori [2] have made an important assumption in their work which demands that the exosystem dynamics generating reference and/or disturbance signals is a neutrally stable system (Lyapunov stable in both forward and backward time). The class of exosystem signals includes the important particular cases of constant reference signals as well as sinusoidal reference signals. Using Centre Manifold Theory [3], Byrnes and Isidori have derived regulator equations, which completely characterize the solution of the output regulation problem of nonlinear control systems. The output regulation problem for linear and nonlinear control systems has been the focus of many studies in recent years ([4]-[14]). In [4], Mahmoud and Khalil obtained results on the asymptotic regulation of minimum phase nonlinear systems using output feedback. In [5], Fridman solved the output regulation problem for nonlinear control systems with delay, using Centre Manifold Theory [3]. In [6]-[7], Chen and Huang obtained results on the robust output regulation for output feedback systems with nonlinear exosystems. In [8], Liu and Huang obtained results on the global robust output regulation problem for lower triangular nonlinear systems with unknown control direction. In [9], Immonen obtained results on the practical output regulation for bounded D.C. Wyld et al. (Eds.): ACITY 2011, CCIS 198, pp. 1–9, 2011. c Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2011\n\n2\n\nV. Sundarapandian\n\nlinear infinite-dimensional state space systems. In [10], Pavlov, Van de Wouw and Nijmeijer obtained results on the global nonlinear output regulation using convergencebased controller design. In [11], Xi and Ding obtained results on the global adaptive output regulation of a class of nonlinear systems with nonlinear exosystems. In [12][14], Serrani, Marconi and Isidori obtained results on the semi-global and global output regulation problem for minimum-phase nonlinear systems. In this paper, the output regulation problem for the chaotic system [15] has been solved using the regulator equations [2] to derive the state feedback control laws for regulating the output of the Coullet chaotic system for the important case constant reference signals (set-point signals). The unified chaotic system is an important chaotic system proposed by J. Lu, G. Chen, D.Z. Cheng and S. Celikovsky ([15], 2002) and this chaotic system bridges the gap between Lorenz system ([16], 1963) and Chen system ([17]. The unified chaotic system includes Lorenz system, Chen system and L¨u system ([18], 2002) as special cases. This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, a review of the solution of the output regulation for nonlinear control systems and regulator equations has been presented. In Section 3, the main results of this paper, namely, the feedback control laws solving the output regulation problem for the unified chaotic system for the important case of constant reference signals has been detailed. In Section 4, the numerical results illustrating the main results of the paper have been described. Section 5 summarizes the main results obtained in this paper.\n\n2 Review of the Output Regulation for Nonlinear Control Systems In this section, we consider a multi-variable nonlinear control system modelled by equations of the form x˙ = f (x) + g(x)u + p(x)ω ω˙ = s(ω)\n\n(1) (2)\n\ne = h(x) − q(ω)\n\n(3)\n\nHere, the differential equation (1) describes the plant dynamics with state x defined in a neighbourhood X of the origin of IRn and the input u takes values in IRm subject to the effect of a disturbance represented by the vector field p(x)ω. The differential equation (2) describes an autonomous system, known as the exosystem, defined in a neighbourhood W of the origin of IRk , which models the class of disturbance and reference signals taken into consideration. The equation (3) defines the error between the actual plant output h(x) ∈ IRp and a reference signal q(ω), which models the class of disturbance and reference signals taken into consideration. We also assume that all the constituent mappings of the system (1)-(2) and the error equation (3), namely, f, g, p, s, h and q are C 1 mappings vanishing at the origin, i.e. f (0) = 0, g(0) = 0, p(0) = 0, h(0) = 0 and q(0) = 0. Thus, for u = 0, the composite system (1)-(2) has an equilibrium (x, ω) = (0, 0) with zero error (3).\n\nOutput Regulation of the Unified Chaotic System\n\n3\n\nA state feedback controller for the composite system (1)-(2) has the form u = α(x, ω)\n\n(4)\n\nwhere α is a C 1 mapping defined on X × W such that α(0, 0) = 0. Upon substitution of the feedback law (4) in the composite system (1)-(2), we get the closed-loop system given by x˙ = f (x) + g(x)α(x, ω) + p(x)ω (5) ω˙ = s(ω) State Feedback Regulator Problem [2]: Find, if possible, a state feedback control law u = α(x, ω) such that (1) [Internal Stability] The equilibrium x = 0 of the dynamics x˙ = f (x) + g(x)α(x, 0) is locally exponentially stable. (2) [Output Regulation] There exists a neighbourhood U ⊂ X × W of (x, ω) = (0, 0) such that for each initial condition (x(0), ω(0)) ∈ U , the solution (x(t), ω(t)) of the closed-loop system (5) satisfies lim [h(x(t)) − q(ω(t))] = 0.\n\nt→∞\n\nByrnes and Isidori [2] have solved this problem under the following assumptions. (H1). The exosystem dynamics ω˙ = s(ω) is neutrally stable at ω = 0, i.e. the system is Lyapunov stable in both forward and backward time at ω = 0. (H2). The pair (f (x), g(x)) has a stabilizable linear approximation at x = 0, i.e. if ∂f ∂g A= and B = , ∂x x=0 ∂x x=0 then (A, B) is stabilizable, which means that we can find a gain matrix K so that A + BK is Hurwitz. Next, we recall the solution of the output regulation problem derived by Byrnes and Isidori [2]. Theorem 1. [2] Under the hypotheses (H1) and (H2), the state feedback regulator problem is solvable if, and only if, there exist C 1 mappings x = π(ω) with π(0) = 0 and u = φ(ω) with φ(0) = 0, both defined in a neighbourhod of W 0 ⊂ W of ω = 0 such that the following equations (called the regulator equations) are satisfied: (1)\n\n∂π s(ω) ∂ω\n\n= f (π(ω)) + g(π(ω))φ(ω) + p(π(ω))ω\n\n(2) h(π(ω)) − q(ω) = 0 When the regulator equations (1) and (2) are satisfied, a control law solving the state feedback regulator problem is given by u = φ(ω) + K[x − π(ω)] where K is any gain matrix such that A + BK is Hurwitz.\n\n(6)\n\n4\n\nV. Sundarapandian\n\n3 Output Regulation of the Unified Chaotic System The unified chaotic system ([15], 2002) is one of the paradigms of the three-dimensional chaotic models described by the dynamics x˙ 1 = (25α + 10)(x2 − x1 ) x˙ 2 = (28 − 35α)x1 + (29α − 1)x2 − x1 x3 + u x˙ 3 = x1 x2 − 13 (8 + α) x3\n\n(7)\n\nwhere x1 , x2 , x3 are the state variables, u is the control and α ∈ [0, 1]. In ([15], 2002), Lu, Chen, Cheng and Celikovsky showed that the system (7) bridges the gap between the Lorenz system ([16], 1963) and the Chen system ([17], 1999). Obviously, the system (7) becomes the original Lorenz system for α = 0, while the system (7) becomes the original Chen system for α = 1. When α = 0.8, the system (7) becomes the critical system or the L¨u system ([18], 2002). Moreover, the system (7) is always chaotic in the whole interval α ∈ [0, 1]. In this paper, we solve the problem of output regulation for the unified chaotic system (7) for tracking of the constant reference signals (set-point signals). The constant reference signals are generated by the scalar exosystem dynamics ω˙ = 0\n\n(8)\n\nIt is important to note that the exosystem given by (8) is neutrally stable, because the exosystem (8) admits only constant solutions. Thus, the assumption (H1) of Theorem 1 holds trivially. Linearizing the dynamics of the unified chaotic system (7) at x = 0, we get ⎡ ⎤ ⎡ ⎤ −(25α + 10) 25α + 10 0 0 ⎢ ⎥ 0 A = ⎣ 28 − 35α 29α − 1 ⎦ and B = ⎣ 1 ⎦ . 0 0 0 − 31 (α + 8) The system pair (A, B) can be expressed as A1 0 B1 A= and B = 0 λ 0 where the pair A1 =\n\n−(25α + 10) 25α + 10 28 − 35α 29α − 1\n\nand B1 =\n\nis completely controllable and the uncontrollable mode of A is 1 λ = − (α + 8) < 0 3 for all α ∈ [0, 1].\n\n0 1\n\nOutput Regulation of the Unified Chaotic System\n\n5\n\nThus, the system pair (A, B) is stabilizable and we can find a gain matrix K = [ K1\n\n0 ] = [ k1\n\nk2\n\n0]\n\nso that the eigenvalues of A1 + B1 K1 can be arbitrarily assigned in the stable region of the complex plane. (The uncontrollable mode λ will always stay as a stable eigenvalue of A + BK.) Thus, the assumption (H2) of Theorem 1 also holds. Hence, we can apply Theorem 1 to completely solve the output regulation problem for the unified chaotic system (7) for the tracking of constant reference signals generated by the exosystem dynamics (8). Case (A): Constant Tracking Problem for x1 Here, we consider the tracking problem for the unified chaotic system (7) with the exosystem dynamics (8) and the tracking error equation e = x1 − ω\n\n(9)\n\nSolving the regulator equations for this tracking problem, we obtain the unique solution 3ω 2 π1 (ω) = ω, π2 (ω) = ω, π3 (ω) = 8+α\n\n(10) 3ω φ(ω) = 8+α ω 2 + (2α − 9)(8 + α) Using Theorem 1 and the solution (10) of the regulator equations, we obtain the following result. Theorem 2. A state feedback control law solving the constant tracking problem for x1 for the unified chaotic system (7) is given by u = φ(ω) + K[x − π(ω)], where φ and π = [ π1 π2 π3 ] are as given in Eq. (10) and the gain matrix K is given by K = [ K1 0 ] with K1 chosen so that A1 + B1 K1 is Hurwitz. Case (B): Constant Tracking Problem for x2 Here, we consider the tracking problem for the unified chaotic system (7) with the exosystem dynamics (8) and the tracking error equation e = x2 − ω\n\n(11)\n\nSolving the regulator equations for this tracking problem, we obtain the unique solution 3ω 2 π1 (ω) = ω, π2 (ω) = ω, π3 (ω) = 8+α\n\n(12) 3ω φ(ω) = 8+α ω 2 + (2α − 9)(8 + α) Using Theorem 1 and the solution (12) of the regulator equations, we obtain the following result. Theorem 3. A state feedback control law solving the constant tracking problem for x2 for the unified chaotic system (7) is given by u = φ(ω) + K[x − π(ω)], where φ and π = [ π1 π2 π3 ] are as given in Eq. (12) and the gain matrix K is given by K = [ K1 0 ] with K1 chosen so that A1 + B1 K1 is Hurwitz.\n\n6\n\nV. Sundarapandian\n\nCase (C): Constant Tracking Problem for x3 Here, we consider the tracking problem for the unified chaotic system (7) with the exosystem dynamics (8) and the tracking error equation e = x3 − ω\n\n(13)\n\nSolving the regulator equations for this tracking problem, we obtain the unique solution ω(8+α) π1 (ω) = ω(8+α) , π (ω) = , π3 (ω) = ω 2 3 3 (14) φ(ω) = (6α − 27 + ω) ω(8+α) 3 Using Theorem 1 and the solution (14) of the regulator equations, we obtain the following result. Theorem 4. A state feedback control law solving the constant tracking problem for x3 for the unified chaotic system (7) is given by u = φ(ω) + K[x − π(ω)], where φ and π = [ π1 π2 π3 ] are as given in Eq. (14) and the gain matrix K is given by K = [ K1 0 ] with K1 chosen so that A1 + B1 K1 is Hurwitz.\n\n4 Numerical Simulations We consider the constant reference signal as ω ≡ 2. For numerical simulations, we choose the gain matrix K = [ K1 K 1 = [ k1\n\nk2\n\n0 ] where\n\n0]\n\nis determined using Ackermann’s formula [19] so that A1 + B1 K1 has stable eigenvalues {−2, −2}. Case (A): Constant Tracking Problem for x1 Here, we take α = 0 so that the unified system (7) becomes the Lorenz system [16]. A simple calculation gives K = [ K1 0 ] = [ −34.4 7.0 0 ] . Let x(0) = (8, 9, 4). The simulation graph is depicted in Figure 1 from which we see that the state x1 (t) tracks the signal ω ≡ 2 in 6 sec. Case (B): Constant Tracking Problem for x2 Here, we take α = 0.8 so that the unified system (7) becomes the L¨u system [18]. A simple calculation gives K = [ K1 0 ] = [ −26.1333 3.8 0 ] . Let x(0) = (6, 5, 8). The simulation graph is depicted in Figure 2 from which we see that the state x2 (t) tracks the signal ω ≡ 2 in about 14 sec. Case (C): Constant Tracking Problem for x3 Here, we take α = 1 so that the unified system (7) becomes the Chen system [17]. A simple calculation gives K = [ K1 0 ] = [ −24.1143 3.0 0 ] . Let x(0) = (7, 1, 4). The simulation graph is depicted in Figure 3 from which we see that the state x3 (t) tracks the signal ω ≡ 2 in about 35 sec.\n\nOutput Regulation of the Unified Chaotic System\n\n7\n\n10\n\n8\n\n6\n\n4\n\nω=2 2\n\n0\n\n−2\n\nx (t) 1\n\n−4\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\nTime (sec)\n\nFig. 1.

This paper investigates the global chaos synchronization of hyperchaotic systems, viz. synchronization of identical hyperchaotic Bao systems (Bao and Liu, 2008), and synchronization of non-identical hyperchaotic Bao and Xu systems. Active nonlinear feedback control is the method used to achieve the synchronization of the chaotic systems addressed in this paper. Our theorems on global chaos synchronization for hyperchaotic Bao and Xu systems are established using Lyapunov stability theory. Since the Lyapunov exponents are not required for these calculations, the active control method is effective and convenient to synchronize identical and different hyperchaotic Bao and Xu systems. Numerical simulations are also given to illustrate and validate the various synchronization results derived in this paper. Keywords: Chaos synchronization, nonlinear control, hyperchaotic Bao system, hyperchaotic Xu system, hyperchaos, active control.\n\n1 Introduction Chaotic systems are dynamical systems that are highly sensitive to initial conditions. This sensitivity is popularly referred to as the butterfly effect [1]. Chaos synchronization problem was first described by Fujisaka and Yemada [2] in 1983. This problem did not receive great attention until Pecora and Carroll ([3]-[4]) published their results on chaos synchronization in early 1990s. From then on, chaos synchronization has been extensively and intensively studied in the last three decades ([3]-[25]). Chaos theory has been explored in a variety of fields including physical [5], chemical [6], ecological [7] systems, secure communications ([8]-[10]) etc. Synchronization of chaotic systems is a phenomenon that may occur when two or more chaotic oscillators are coupled or when a chaotic oscillator drives another chaotic oscillator. Because of the butterfly effect which causes the exponential divergence of the trajectories of two identical chaotic systems started with nearly the same initial conditions, synchronizing two chaotic systems is seemingly a very challenging problem. In most of the chaos synchronization approaches, the master-slave or drive-response formalism is used. If a particular chaotic system is called the master or drive system and another chaotic system is called the slave or response system, then the idea of the synchronization is to use the output of the master system to control the slave system so that the output of the slave system tracks the output of the master system asymptotically. D.C. Wyld et al. (Eds.): ACITY 2011, CCIS 198, pp. 10–17, 2011. c Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2011\n\nGlobal Chaos Synchronization of Hyperchaotic Bao and Xu Systems\n\n11\n\nSince the seminal work by Pecora and Carroll ([3]-[4]), a variety of impressive approaches have been proposed for the synchronization for the chaotic systems such as PC method ([3]-[4]), t he sampled-data feedback synchronization method ([10]-[11]), OGY method [12], time-delay feedback approach [13], backstepping design method [14], adaptive design method ([15]-[18]), sliding mode control method [19], active control method ([20], [21]), etc. Hyperchaotic system is usually defined as a chaotic system with at least two positive Lyapunov exponents, implying that its dynamics are expanded in several different directions simultaneously. Thus, the hyperchaotic systems have more complex dynamical behaviour which can be used to improve the security of a chaotic communication system. Hence, the theoretical design and circuit realization of various hyperchaotic signals have become important research topics ([22]-[24]). This paper has been organized as follows. In Section 2, we give the problem statement and our methodology. In Section 3, we derive results for the chaos synchronization of two identical hyperchaotic Bao systems ([25], 2008). In Section 4, we discuss the synchronization of hyperchaotic Xu ([26], 2009) and hyperchaotic Bao systems. Section 5 contains the conclusions of this paper.\n\n2 Problem Statement and Our Methodology Consider the chaotic system described by the dynamics x˙ = Ax + f (x)\n\n(1)\n\nwhere x ∈ IRn is the state of the system, A is the n × n matrix of the system parameters and f is the nonlinear part of the system. We consider the system (1) as the master or drive system. As the slave or response system, we consider the following chaotic system described by the dynamics y˙ = By + g(y) + u (2) where y ∈ IRn is the state of the slave system, B is the n × n matrix of the system parameters, g is the nonlinear part of the system u is the controller of the slave system. If A = B and f = g, then x and y are the states of two identical chaotic systems. If A = B and f = g, then x and y are the states of two different chaotic systems. In the active nonlinear control approach, we design a feedback controller which synchronizes the states of the master system (1) and the slave system (2) for all initial conditions x(0), z(0) ∈ IRn . If we define the synchronization error as e = y − x,\n\n(3)\n\nthen the synchronization error dynamics is obtained as e˙ = By − Ax + g(y) − f (x) + u\n\n(4)\n\n12\n\nV. Sundarapandian and R. Suresh\n\nThus, the global synchronization problem is essentially to find a feedback controller so as to stabilize the error dynamics (4) for all initial conditions, i.e. lim e(t) = 0\n\nt→∞\n\n(5)\n\nfor all initial conditions e(0) ∈ IRn . We use the Lyapunov stability theory as our methodology. We take as a candidate Lyapunov function V (e) = eT P e, where P is a positive definite matrix. Note that V is a positive definite function by construction. We assume that the parameters of the master and slave systems are known and that the states of both systems (1) and (2) are measurable. If we find a feedback controller u so that V˙ (e) = −eT Qe where Q is a positive definite matrix, then V is a negative definite function on IRn . Thus, by Lyapunov stability theory [27], the error dynamics (4) is globally exponentially stable and hence the states of the master system (1) and slave system (2) are globally exponentially synchronized.\n\n3 Synchronization of Identical Hyperchaotic Bao Systems In this section, we apply the active nonlinear control method for the synchronization of two identical hyperchaotic Bao systems ([25], 2008). Thus, the master system is described by the hyperchaotic Bao dynamics x˙ 1 x˙ 2 x˙ 3 x˙ 4\n\n= a(x2 − x1 ) + x4 = cx2 − x1 x3 = x1 x2 − bx3 = kx1 + dx2 x3\n\n(6)\n\nwhere x1 , x2 , x3 , x4 are the state variables and a, b, c, d, k are positive real constants. The slave system is also described by the hyperchaotic Bao dynamics y˙ 1 y˙ 2 y˙ 3 y˙ 4\n\n= a(y2 − y1 ) + y4 + u1 = cy2 − y1 y3 + u2 = y1 y2 − by3 + u3 = ky1 + dy2 y3 + u4\n\n(7)\n\nwhere y1 , y2 , y3 , y4 are the state variables and u1 , u2 , u3 , u4 are the nonlinear controllers to be designed. The four-dimensional Bao system (6) is hyperchaotic when a = 36, b = 3, c = 20, d = 0.1 and k = 21.\n\n(8)\n\nGlobal Chaos Synchronization of Hyperchaotic Bao and Xu Systems\n\n13\n\nThe synchronization error is defined by ei = yi − xi , (i = 1, 2, 3, 4)\n\n(9)\n\nA simple calculation yields the error dynamics as e˙ 1 e˙ 2 e˙ 3 e˙ 4\n\n= a(e2 − e1 ) + e4 + u1 = ce2 − y1 y3 + x1 x3 + u2 = −be3 + y1 y2 − x1 x2 + u3 = ke1 + d(y2 y3 − x2 x3 ) + u4\n\n(10)\n\nWe choose the nonlinear controller as u1 u2 u3 u4\n\n= −ae2 − (k + 1)e4 = −(c + 1)e2 + y1 y3 − x1 x3 = −y1 y2 + x1 x2 = −e4 − d(y2 y3 − x2 x3 )\n\n(11)\n\nSubstituting the controller u defined by (11) into (10), we get e˙ 1 = −ae1 − ke4 , e˙ 2 = −e2 , e˙ 3 = −be3 , e˙ 4 = −e4 + ke1 We consider the candidate Lyapunov function 1 1 2 V (e) = eT e = e1 + e22 + e23 + e24 2 2\n\n(12)\n\n(13)\n\nwhich is a positive definite function on IR4 . Differentiating V along the trajectories of (12), we find that V˙ (e) = −ae21 − e22 − be23 − e24\n\n(14)\n\nwhich is a negative definite function on IR4 since a and b are positive constants. Thus, by Lyapunov stability theory [27], the error dynamics (12) is globally exponentially stable. Hence, we have proved the following result. Theorem 1. The identical hyperchaotic Bao systems (6) and (7) are exponentially and globally synchronized for any initial conditions with the nonlinear controller u defined by (11). Numerical Results For the numerical simulations, the fourth order Runge-Kutta method with time-step 10−6 is used to solve the two systems of differential equations (6) and (7) with the parameter values as given in (8) and the active nonlinear controller u defined by (11). The initial values of the master system (6) are taken as x1 (0) = 10, x2 (0) = 5, x3 (0) = 20, x4 (0) = 15 and the initial values of the slave system (7) are taken as y1 (0) = 2, y2 (0) = 25, y3 (0) = 5, y4 (0) = 30 Figure 1 shows that synchronization between the states of the master system (6) and the slave system (7) occur in about 4 seconds.\n\n14\n\nV.

Synchronization of the Identical Hyperchaotic Bao Systems\n\n4 Synchronization of Hyperchaotic Bao and Xu Systems In this section, the nonlinear control method is applied for the synchronization of two different hyperchaotic systems described by the hyperchaotic Xu system ([26], 2009) as the master system and the hyperchaotic Bao system ([25], 2008) as the slave system. The dynamics of the hyperchaotic Xu system, taken as the master system, is described by x˙ 1 = α(x2 − x1 ) + x4 x˙ 2 = βx1 + rx1 x3 (15) x˙ 3 = −γx3 − lx1 x2 x˙ 4 = x1 x3 − mx2 where x1 , x2 , x3 , x4 are the state variables and α, β, γ, r, l, m are positive real constants. The dynamics of the hyperchaotic Bao system, taken as the slave system, is described by y˙ 1 = a(y2 − y1 ) + y4 + u1 y˙ 2 = cy2 − y1 y3 + u2 (16) y˙ 3 = y1 y2 − by3 + u3 y˙ 4 = ky1 + dy2 y3 + u4 where y1 , y2 , y3 , y4 are the state variables and u1 , u2 , u3 , u4 are the nonlinear controllers to be designed. The four-dimensional Xu system (15) is hyperchaotic when α = 10, β = 40, γ = 2.5, r = 16, l = 1 and m = 2.\n\n(17)\n\nGlobal Chaos Synchronization of Hyperchaotic Bao and Xu Systems\n\n15\n\nThe synchronization error is defined by ei = yi − xi , (i = 1, 2, 3, 4)\n\n(18)\n\nA simple calculation yields the error dynamics as e˙ 1 e˙ 2 e˙ 3 e˙ 4\n\n= a(e2 − e1 ) + e4 + (a − α)(x2 − x1 ) + u1 = ce2 + cx2 − βx1 − y1 y3 − rx1 x3 + u2 = −be3 + (γ − b)x3 + y1 y2 + lx1 x2 + u3 = ke1 + kx1 + mx2 + dy2 y3 − x1 x3 + u4\n\n(19)\n\nWe choose the nonlinear controller as u1 u2 u3 u4\n\n= −ae2 − (k + 1)e4 + (α − a)(x2 − x1 ) = −(c + 1)e2 − cx2 + βx1 + y1 y3 + rx1 x3 = (b − γ)x3 − y1 y2 − lx1 x2 = −e4 − kx1 − mx2 − dy2 y3 + x1 x3\n\n(20)\n\nSubstituting the controller u defined by (20) into (19), we get e˙ 1 = −ae1 − ke4 , e˙ 2 = −e2 , e˙ 3 = −be3 , e˙ 4 = −e4 + ke1 We consider the candidate Lyapunov function 1 1 2 V (e) = eT e = e1 + e22 + e23 + e24 2 2\n\n(21)\n\n(22)\n\nwhich is a positive definite function on IR4 . Differentiating V along the trajectories of (21), we find that V˙ (e) = −ae21 − e22 − be23 − e24\n\n(23)\n\nwhich is a negative definition on IR4 since a and b are positive constants. Thus, by Lyapunov stability theory [27], the error dynamics (21) is globally exponentially stable. Hence, we have proved the following result. Theorem 2. The non-identical hyperchaotic Xu system (15) and hyperchaotic Bao system (16) are exponentially and globally synchronized for any initial conditions with the nonlinear controller u defined by (20). Numerical Results For the numerical simulations, the fourth order Runge-Kutta method with time-step 10−6 is used to solve the two systems of differential equations (15) and (16) with the parameter values as given in (17) and the active nonlinear controller u defined by (20). The initial values of the master system (15) are taken as x1 (0) = 20, x2 (0) = 10, x3 (0) = 8, x4 (0) = 12 and the initial values of the slave system (16) are taken as y1 (0) = 12, y2 (0) = 26, y3 (0) = 15, y4 (0) = 20 Figure 2 shows that synchronization between the states of the master system (15) and the slave system (16) occur in about 3 seconds.\n\n16\n\nV.

This paper investigates the stabilization of large scale discrete-time linear control systems by observer-based reduced order controllers. Sufficient conditions are derived for the design of observer-based reduced order controllers for the large scale discrete-time linear control systems by obtaining a reduced order model of the original linear plant using the dominant state of the system. A separation principle has been established in this paper which shows that the observer poles and controller poles can be separated and hence the pole placement problem and observer design problem are independent of each other. Keywords: Model reduction; reduced-order controllers; stabilization; dominant state; observers; discrete-time linear systems.\n\n1 Introduction Reduced-order model and reduced-order controller design for linear control systems has been widely studied in the control systems literature ([1]-[9]). Especially in recent decades, the control problem of large scale linear systems has been an active area of research. This is due to practical and technical issues like information transfer networks, data acquisition, sensing, computing facilities and the associated cost involved which stem from using full order controller design. Thus, there is a great demand for the control of large scale linear control systems with the use of reduced-order controllers rather than the full-order controllers ([1]-[3]). A recent approach for obtaining reduced-order controllers is via obtaining the reduced-order model of a linear plant preserving the dynamic as well as static properties of the system and then working out controllers for the reduced-order model thus obtained ([4]-[8]). This approach has practical and technical benefits for the reduced-order controller design for large scale linear systems with high dimension and complexity. The motivation for the observer-based reduced order controllers stems from the fact that the dominant state of the linear plant may not be available for measurement and hence for implementing the pole placement law, only the reduced order exponential observer can be used in lieu of the dominant state of the given discrete-time linear system. D.C. Wyld et al. (Eds.): ACITY 2011, CCIS 198, pp. 18–27, 2011. c Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2011\n\nStabilization of Large Scale Discrete-Time Linear Control Systems\n\n19\n\nIn this paper, we derive a reduced-order model for any linear discrete-time control system and our approach is based on the approach of using the dominant state of the given linear discrete-time control system, i.e. we derive the reduced-order model for a given discrete-time linear control system keeping only the dominant state of the given discrete-time linear control system. Using the reduced-order model obtained, we characterize the existence of a reduced-order exponential observer that tracks the state of the reduced-order model, i.e. the dominant state of the original linear plant. We note that the model reduction and the reduced-order observer design detailed in this paper are discrete-time analogues of the results of Aldeen and Trinh [8] for the observer design of the dominant state of continuous-time linear control systems. Using the reduced-order model of the original linear plant, we also characterize the existence of a stabilizing feedback control law that uses only the dominant state of the original plant. Also, when the plant is stabilizable by a state feedback control law, the full information of the dominant state is not always available. For this reason, we establish a separation principle so that the state of the exponential observer may be used in lieu of the dominant state of the original linear plant, which facilitates the implementation of the stabilizing feedback control law derived. The design of observer-based reduced order controllers for large scale discrete-time linear systems derived in this paper has important applications in practice. This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we derive the reduced-order plant of a given linear discrete-time control systems. In Section 3, we derive necessary and sufficient conditions for the exponential observer design for the reduced order linear control plant. In Section 4, we derive necessary and sufficient conditions for the reduced-order plant to be stabilizable by a linear feedback control law and we also present a separation principle for the observed-based reduced order controller design. In Section 5, we present a numerical example. Conclusions are contained in the final section.\n\n2 Reduced Order Model for the Linear System Consider a discrete-time linear control system S1 given by x(k + 1) = Ax(k) + Bu(k) y(k) = Cx(k)\n\n(1)\n\nwhere x ∈ IRn is the state, u ∈ IRm is the control input and y ∈ IRp is the output of the linear system. We assume that A, B and C are constant matrices with real entries of dimensions n × n, n × m and p × n respectively. First, we suppose that we have performed an identification of the dominant (slow) and non-dominant (fast) states of the given linear system (1) using the modal approach as described in [9]. Without loss of generality, we may assume that xs x= , xf where xs ∈ IRr represents the dominant state and xf ∈ IRn−r represents the nondominant state of the system.\n\n20\n\nV. Sundarapandian and M. Kavitha\n\nThen the system (1) takes the form Ass xs (k + 1) = xf (k + 1) Af s y(k)\n\n= [ Cs\n\nAsf Bs xs (k) + u(k) xf (k) Af f Bf xs (k) Cf ] xf (k)\n\n(2)\n\nFrom (2), we have xs (k + 1) = Ass xs (k) + Asf xf (k) + Bs u(k) xf (k + 1) = Af s xs (k) + Af f xf (k) + Bf u(k) y(k) = Cs xs (k) + Cf xf (k)\n\n(3)\n\nFor the sake of simplicity, we will assume that the matrix A has distinct eigenvalues. We note that this condition is usually satisfied in most practical situations. Then it follows that A is diagonalizable. Thus, we can find a nonsingular matrix (modal matrix) P consisting of the n linearly independent eigenvectors of A such that P −1 AP = Λ, where Λ is a diagonal matrix consisting of the n eigenvalues of A. We introduce a new set of coordinates on the state space given by ξ = P −1 x\n\n(4)\n\nThen the plant (1) becomes ξ(k + 1) = Λ ξ(k) + P −1 B u(k) y(k) = CP ξ(k) Thus, we have\n\nΛs ξs (k + 1) = ξf (k + 1) 0 y(k)\n\n= CP\n\n0 Λf\n\nξs (k) ξf (k)\n\nξs (k) + P −1 B u(k) ξf (k)\n\n(5)\n\nwhere Λs and Λf are r × r and (n − r) × (n − r) diagonal matrices respectively. Define matrices Γs , Γf , Ψs and Ψf by Γs P −1 B = (6) and CP = [ Ψs Ψf ] Γf where Γs , Γf , Ψs and Ψf are r × m, (n − r) × m, p × r and p × (n − r) matrices respectively. From (5) and (6), we see that the plant (3) has the following simple form in the new coordinates (4).\n\nStabilization of Large Scale Discrete-Time Linear Control Systems\n\nξs (k + 1) = Λs ξs (k) + Γs u(k) ξf (k + 1) = Λf ξf (k) + Γf u(k) y(k) = Ψs ξs (k) + Ψf ξf (k)\n\n21\n\n(7)\n\nNext, we make the following assumptions: (H1). As k → ∞, ξf (k + 1) ≈ ξf (k), i.e. ξf takes a constant value in the steady-state. (H2). The matrix I − Λf is invertible. Using (H1) and (H2), we find from Eq. (7) that for large values of k, we have ξf (k) ≈ Λf ξf (k) + Γf u(k) i.e.\n\nξf (k) ≈ (I − Λf )−1 Γf u(k)\n\n(8)\n\nSubstituting (8) into (7), we obtain the reduced-order model of the given linear plant (1) in the ξ coordinates as ξs (k + 1) = Λs ξs (k) + Γs u(k) y(k) = Ψs ξs (k) + Ψf (I − Λf )−1 Γf u(k)\n\n(9)\n\nTo obtain the reduced-order model of the given linear plant (1) in the x coordinates, we proceed as follows. Set Qss Qsf P −1 = Q = , Qf s Q f f where Qss , Qsf , Qf s and Qf f are r × r, r × (n − r), (n − r) × r and (n − r) × (n − r) matrices respectively. By the linear change of coordinates (4), it follows that ξ = P −1 x = Qx. Thus, we have\n\nξs (k) ξf (k)\n\nxs (k) =Q xf (k)\n\n=\n\nQss Qsf Qf s Q f f\n\nξs (k) ξf (k)\n\n(10)\n\nUsing (9) and (10), it follows that ξf (k) = Qf s xs (k) + Qf f xf (k) = (I − Λf )−1 Γf u(k) or\n\nQf f xf (k) = −Qf s xs (k) + (I − Λf )−1 Γf u(k) Next, we make the following assumption.\n\n(H3). The matrix Qf f is invertible.\n\n(11)\n\n22\n\nV. Sundarapandian and M. Kavitha\n\nUsing (H3), the equation (11) becomes −1 −1 Γf u(k) xf (k) = −Q−1 f f Qf s xs (k) + Qf f (I − Λf )\n\n(12)\n\nTo simplify the notation, we define the matrices −1 −1 Γf R = −Q−1 f f Qf s and S = Qf f (I − Λf )\n\n(13)\n\nUsing (13), the equation (12) can be simplified as xf (k) = Rxs (k) + Su(k)\n\n(14)\n\nSubstituting (14) into (3), we obtain the reduced-order model S2 of the given linear system S1 as xs (k + 1) = As xs (k) + Bs u(k) (15) y(k) = Cs xs (k) + Ds u(k) where the matrices As , Bs , Cs and Ds are defined by As = Ass + Asf R, Bs = Bs + Asf S, Cs = Cs + Cf R and Ds = Cf S\n\n(16)\n\n3 Reduced Order Observer Design In this section, we state a new result that prescribes a simple procedure for estimating the dominant state of the given linear control system S1 that satisfies the assumptions (H1)-(H3). Theorem 1. Let S1 be the linear system described by x(k + 1) = Ax(k) + Bu(k) y(k) = Cx(k)\n\n(17)\n\nUnder the assumptions (H1)-(H3), the reduced-order model S2 of the linear system S1 can be obtained (see Section 2) as xs (k + 1) = As x(k) + Bs u(k) y(k) = Cs x(k) + Ds u(k)\n\n(18)\n\nwhere As , Bs , Cs and Ds are defined as in (16). To estimate the dominant state xs of the system S1 , consider the candidate observer S3 defined by zs (k + 1) = As zs (k) + Bs u(k) + Ks [y(k) − Cs zs (k) − Ds u(k)]\n\n(19)\n\nDefine the estimation error as e = zs − xs . Then e(k) → 0 exponentially as k → ∞ if and only if the matrix Ks is such that E = As −Ks Cs is convergent. If (Cs , As ) is observable, then we can always construct an exponential observer of the form (19) having any desired speed of convergence.\n\nStabilization of Large Scale Discrete-Time Linear Control Systems\n\n23\n\nProof. From Eq. (2), we have xs (k + 1) = Ass xs (k) + Asf xf (k) + Bs u(k)\n\n(20)\n\nAdding and subtracting the term (Asf − KsCf )Rxs (k) in the right hand side of Eq. (20), we get xs (k + 1) = (Ass + Asf R − Ks Cf R)xs (k) + Asf xf (k) −(Asf − Ks Cf )Rxs (k) + Bs u(k)\n\n(21)\n\nSubtracting (21) from (19) and simplifying using the definitions (16), we get e(k + 1) = (As − Ks Cs )e(k) − (Asf − Ks Cf )[xf (k) − Rxs (k) − Su(k)] (22) As proved in Section 2, the assumptions (H1)-(H3) yield xf (k) ≈ Rxs (k) + Su(k)\n\n(23)\n\nSubstituting (23) into (22), we get\n\nwhich yields\n\ne(k + 1) = (As − Ks Cs )e(k) = Ee(k)\n\n(24)\n\ne(k) = (As − Ks Cs )k e(0) = E k e(0)\n\n(25)\n\nFrom Eq. (25), it follows that e(k) → 0 as k → ∞ if and only if E is convergent. If (Cs , As ) is observable, then it is well-known [10] that we can find an observer gain matrix Ks that will arbitrarily assign the eigenvalues of the error matrix E = As − Ks Cs . In particular, it follows from Eq. (25) that we can find an exponential observer of the form (19) having any desired speed of convergence.\n\n4 Observer-Based Reduced Order Controller Design In this section, we first state an important result that prescribes a simple procedure for stabilizing the dominant state of the reduced-order control plant derived in Section 2. Theorem 2. Suppose that the assumptions (H1)-(H3) hold. Let S1 and S2 be defined as in Theorem 1. For the reduced-order model S2 , the feedback control law u(k) = Fs xs (k)\n\n(26)\n\nstabilizes the dominant state xs if and only if the matrix Fs is such that As + Bs Fs is convergent. If the system pair (As , Bs ) is controllable, then we can always construct a feedback control law (26) that stabilizes the dominant state xs of the reduced-order model S2 having any desired speed of convergence. In practical applications, the dominant state xs of the reduced-order model S2 may not be directly available for measurement and hence we cannot implement the state feedback control law (26). To overcome this practical difficulty, we derive an important theorem, usually called as the Separation Principle, which first establishes that the observer-based reduced-order controller indeed stabilizes the dominant state of the given linear control system S1 and also demonstrates that the observer poles and the closed-loop controller poles are separated.\n\n24\n\nV. Sundarapandian and M. Kavitha\n\nTheorem 3 (Separation Principle). Suppose that the assumptions (H1)-(H3) hold. Suppose that there exist matrices Fs and Ks such that As + Bs Ks and As − Ks Cs are both convergent matrices. By Theorem 1, we know that the system S3 defined by (19) is an exponential observer for the dominant state xs of the control system S1 . Then the observer poles and the closed-loop controller poles are separated and the control law u(k) = Fs zs (k)\n\n(27)\n\nalso stabilizes the dominant state xs of the control system S1 . Proof. Under the feedback control law (27), the observer dynamics (19)) of the system S3 becomes zs (k + 1) = (As + Bs Fs − Ks Cs − Ks Ds Fs ) zs (k) +Ks [Cs xs (k) + Cf xf (k)]\n\n(28)\n\nBy (14), we know that xf (k) ≈ Rxs (k) + Su(k) = Rxs (k) + SFs zs (k)\n\n(29)\n\nSubstituting (29) into (28) and simplifying using the definitions (16), we get zs (k + 1) = (As + Bs Fs − Ks Cs ) zs (k) + Ks Cs xs (k)\n\n(30)\n\nSubstituting the control law (27) into (3), we also obtain xs (k + 1) = As xs (k) + Bs Fs zs (k)\n\n(31)\n\nIn matrix representation, we can write equations (30) and (31) as\n\nBs Fs As xs (k + 1) xs (k) = zs (k + 1) zs (k) Ks Cs As + Bs Fs − Ks Cs\n\n(32)\n\nSince the estimation error e is defined by e = zs − xs , it is easy from equation (32) that the error e satisfies the equation e(k + 1) = (As − Ks Cs )e(k)\n\n(33)\n\nUsing the (x, e) coordinates, the composite system (32) can be simplified as\n\nxs (k + 1) es (k + 1)\n\n=\n\nBs Fs As + Bs Fs 0 As − Ks Cs\n\nxs (k) es (k)\n\n=M\n\nxs (k) es (k)\n\n(34)\n\nStabilization of Large Scale Discrete-Time Linear Control Systems\n\nwhere M=\n\nBs Fs As + Bs Fs 0 As − Ks Cs\n\n25\n\n(35)\n\nSince the matrix M is block-triangular, it is immediate that eig(M ) = eig (As + Bs Fs ) ∪ eig (As − Ks Cs )\n\n(36)\n\nwhich establishes the first part of the Separation Principle namely that the observer poles are separated from the closed-loop controller poles. To show that the observer-based control law (27) indeed works, we note that the closed-loop regulator matrix As + Bs Fs and the observer error matrix As − Ks Cs are both convergent matrices. From Eq. (36), it is immediate that M is also a convergent matrix. From Eq. (35), it is thus immediate that xs (k) → 0 and es (k) → 0 as k → ∞ for all xs (0) and e(0).\n\n5 Numerical Example In this section, we consider a fourth order linear discrete-time control system described by x(k + 1) = Ax(k) + Bu(k) (37) y(k) = Cx(k) where\n\n⎡\n\n2.0 ⎢ 0.4 A=⎣ 0.1 0.7\n\n0.6 0.4 0.3 0.9\n\n0.2 0.9 0.5 0.8\n\n⎡ ⎤ ⎤ 1 0.3 ⎢1⎥ 0.5 ⎥ ⎥ ⎦, B = ⎢ ⎣1⎦ 0.1 1 0.8\n\n(38)\n\nand C = [1\n\n2 1\n\n1]\n\n(39)\n\nThe eigenvalues of the matrix A are λ1 = 2.4964, λ2 = 1.0994, λ3 = 0.3203 and λ4 = −0.2161 Thus, we note that λ1 , λ2 are unstable (slow) eigenvalues and λ3 , λ4 are stable (fast) eigenvalues of the system matrix A. For this linear system, the dominant and non-dominant states are calculated as in [9]. A simple calculation shows that the first two states {x1 , x2 } are the dominant (slow) states, while the last two states {x3 , x4 } are the non-dominant (fast) states for the given system (37). Using the procedure described in Section 2, the reduced-order linear model for the given linear system (37) is obtained as xs (k + 1) = As xs (k) + Bs u(k) y(k) = Cs xs (k) + Ds u(k)\n\n(40)\n\n26\n\nV.

Hence, we can construct reduced-order observers and observerbased reduced-order controllers for this plant as detailed in Sections 3 and 4.\n\n6 Conclusions In this paper, sufficient conditions are derived for the design of observer-based reduced order controllers by deriving a reduced order model of the original plant using the dominant state of the original linear system. The observer-based reduced order controllers are constructed by combining reduced order controllers for the original linear system which require the dominant state of the original system and reduced order observers for the original linear system which give an exponential estimate of the dominant state of the original linear system. We established a separation principle in this paper which shows that the pole placement problem and observer design problem are independent of each other.\n\nStabilization of Large Scale Discrete-Time Linear Control Systems\n\n27\n\nReferences 1.

Classification refers to associating a given fingerprint to one of the existing classes already recognized in the literature. A search over all the records in the database takes a long time, so the aim is to reduce the size of the search space by choosing an appropriate subset of database for search. Classifying a fingerprint images is a very difficult pattern recognition problem, due to the small interclass variability, the large intraclass variability. This paper presents a sequence flow diagram which will help in developing the clarity on designing algorithm for classification based on various parameters extracted from the fingerprint image. It discusses in brief the ways in which the parameters are extracted from the image. Existing fingerprint classification approaches are based on these parameters as input for classifying the image. Parameters like orientation map, singular points, spurious singular points, ridge flow and hybrid feature are discussed in the paper. Keywords: Singular points, Ridge flow, Orientation map, Spurious singular points, Multiple classifier.\n\n1 Introduction The authentication of a person requires a comparison of her fingerprint with all the fingerprints in a database. This database may be very large (e.g., several million fingerprints) in many forensic and civilian applications. In such cases, the identification typically has an incongruously long response time. The authentication process can be fastened by reducing the number of comparisons that are required to be performed. A common strategy to achieve this is to partition the fingerprint database into a number of classes. A fingerprint to be identified is then required to be compared only to the fingerprints in a single class of the database based on its features. The well-known Henry’s Classification scheme divides a fingerprint structure into three major classes or patterns namely Arch, Loop and Whorl. These classes are further divided by researchers into arch, tented arch, left loop, right loop, double loop and whorl. Figure. 1 displays an algorithmic flow for selection of features and classification of fingerprint. Beginning with generation of orientation map or ridge flow, it follows the flow to be used for different methods for classification. D.C. Wyld et al. (Eds.): ACITY 2011, CCIS 198, pp. 28–39, 2011. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2011\n\nReview of Parameters of Fingerprint Classification Methods Based on Algorithmic Flow\n\n29\n\nOrientation map helps to locate singular points. It is possible to get false/spurious singular points while search for genuine singular points. Hybrid class is formed by the combination of the orientation map, ridge flow or real singular points. Features are extracted by using the above techniques followed by classification of fingerprint. These features can be given as input to neural network, clustering algorithm, hidden markov model, rule based approach, genetic algorithm, etc to improve the performance of classification method.\n\nFig. 1. Algorithmic approach for classifying fingerprint image\n\n2 Related Work This section glances through various fingerprint classification methods based on the parameters extracted. The following parameters are used for differentiating between various methods: Orientation map, Singular points, spurious singular points, Ridgeline flow and Multiple parameters based methods[31]. 2.1 Orientation Map Orientation map describes the orientation of the ridge-valley structures. The Direction Field can be derived from the gradients by performing averaging operation on the gradients, involving pixels in some neighborhood [23]. Wei and Chen [14] have suggested an improvement in the computation of direction field which gives more accurate information about the ridges and the valleys as shown in figure 2.\n\nFig. 2. Smoothed Orientation Field\n\n30\n\nD. Parekh and Rekha Vig\n\nCappelli et al. [8] have presented a new approach for fingerprint classification which uses masks for partitioning orientation image. Dynamic masks help to bring stability during partition process. Sylvain et al. [9] uses direction map to capture features which is given to Self Organizing Map for further classification. Guo et al. [10] have presented a statistical approach for fingerprint classification using Hidden Markov Model (HMM). HMM is like a finite state machine in which not only transitions are probabilistic but also output. Feature vector is obtained by getting the local orientation for each block. This observation vector is fed as input to HMM. Krasnjak and Krivec [11] have used quad tree principle to divide the direction map according to homogeneity,which is used as feature vector for neural network using MultiLayer perceptron. Xuejun and Lin [12] have proposed an algorithm based on genetic programming for fingerprint classification. In this paper genetic programming tries to explore a huge search space which cannot be done by human experts.Features are generated from orientation field using genetic programming. Jiang et al. [13] have given a combined classification approach by performing exclusive and then continuous classification [26]. In exclusive classification, first clustering is performed to form similar groups of data in the database then the query image’s orientation field is compared with the cluster representative which reduces search time. In continuous classification the query images orientation map is compared to the fingerprints in the received cluster. Luping Ji, Zhang Yi [15] have presented classification approach using Support Vector Machine (SVM). SVM is a learning theory useful in pattern classification. Four directions (0, π/4, π/2, 3π/4) are used for orientation field representation. Fingerprints are then classified using the output of the trained classifier. Sivanandam and Anburajan [16] have used neural network for classification. Jiaojiao Hu, Mei Xie [18] have introduced a classification technique using combination of genetic algorithm and neural network. Orientation field is given as input to genetic programming process. Features are given as input to backpropagation network and Support Vector Machine (SVM) for classification of fingerprints. 2.2 Core and Delta Points Within the pattern areas of loops and whorls are enclosed the focal points which are used to classify fingerprints. These points are called as core and delta. The delta is that point on a ridge at or in front of and nearest the center of the divergence of the type lines. The core is present when there is atleast one ridge that enters from one side and then curves back, leaving the fingerprint on the same side as shown in figure 3.\n\nFig. 3. Right Loop with core (red) and delta (green)\n\nReview of Parameters of Fingerprint Classification Methods Based on Algorithmic Flow\n\n31\n\nApproaches for singularity detection operate on the fingerprint orientation image. Poincare index proposed by Kawagoe and Tojo (1984) is an elegant and practical method to detect singular points. It is computed by algebraically summing the orientation differences between adjacent elements [22]. Poincare index is evaluated for every pixel in the directional image. M.Usman, Assia Khanam [19] have suggested an optimal way of locating core point by extracting the region of interest. Wang and Zhang [1] have enhanced the fingerprint image to reduce the effect of noise and detected singular points using Poincare Index. Feature Vector is obtained by finding the region of interest [24] using core point. Finally clustering algorithm is used for classification.Liu and Zhang [2],Klimanee and Nguyen [3] and Msizia and Ntsika [5] have preprocessed image and have presented a novel way of locating core and delta points. Classification is done by defining rules based on the number of singular points.Classification is performed using principal axes in [3]. Srinivasan and Rakesh [4] have proposed a technique based on neural network. They have used PCA (Principal Component Analysis) to reduce the size of the feature space. Singular points detected are then given to SOM (self-organized map) which is an unsupervised learning neural network. 2.3 Ridgeline Flow The flow of the ridges is an important discriminating characteristic. It is not always easy to effectively extract ridges from noisy fingerprints. It is a parameter more robust than singular points. The ridge line flow is usually represented as a set of curves running parallel to the ridge lines as in figure 4; these curves do not necessarily coincide with the fingerprint ridges and valleys, but they exhibit the same local orientation.\n\nFig. 4. Tracing of Ridges\n\nAndrew [6] has described a classification technique based on the characteristics of the ridges. Two new classifiers have been presented in the paper. The first classification described is by using Hidden Markov Model (HMM). In fingerprint image the direction changes slowly hence HMM is suitable here for classification. The ridgelines are typically extracted directly from the directional image, then the image is binarized and thinning operation is performed, features are extracted that denotes the ridge behavior. The second classification described is using Decision Trees. Features are extracted and classified using a decision tree approach. Features are extracted at significant points on the ridges and a decision tree is constructed\n\n32\n\nD. Parekh and Rekha Vig\n\nbased on the questions about the features and the relationship between those features. Neeta and Dinesh [7] have presented an approach for classification based on ridge flow. To reduce computation high ridge curvature region is extracted using Sobel operator and direction map. HRC is calculated based on the values of the slope within the block. After locating HRC, Ridge tracing is performed. Hye-Wuk and Lee [17] have published classification approach using HMM. Features are extracted from orientation field by locating the direction of the extracted ridge which is then taken as input for HMM for designing fingerprint models. 2.4 Removal of Spurious Singular Points Accuracy in finding singular points is reduced if the image is of poor quality as shown in figure 5.\n\nFig. 5. Spurious Singular Points (yellow)\n\nZhou et al. [20] work is based on DORIC (Differences of Orientation values along a Circle) feature an extended form of Poincare Index. These are given to Support Vector Machine to design classifier. F.Magalhães et al.[29] uses constraints to remove extra singular points by treating them as centeroid if they are too close and deleting a pair of core and delta if distance between them is less than threshold. N.Johal et al.[30] presents an algorithm to fine tune orientation map by finding the direction of gravity. Blocks are found whose slope is in the range of 0 to pi/2 to obtain singular points. 2.5 Multiple Classifier Different parameters potentially offer extra information about the patterns to be classified, which may be exploited to improve performance of algorithm. Jain, Prabhakar, Hong [21] have come up with a novel scheme to represent ridges and valleys of a fingerprint. It uses orientation field to detect core and delta points. 2 stage classification is done, firstly K nearest neighbor to find most likely classes and secondly neural network for further classification.Zhang,Yan [25] have used core and delta points and ridge flow as feature vector. Using singular point, ridge is traced in opposite directions to find the turn number. It then uses rules for classification. Wang,Chen [14] is based on singular points and orientation map. Their feature vector includes number of singular points, angle from delta to core, average of the directions in region of interest. Further, Fuzzy Wavelet Neural Network is used for classification.Wei and Hao [27] have used singular points and ridge flow mthods for feature extraction. In the first level ridgelines are classified and classification is done based on it. In the second level the ridge count between singular points is used for further classification.\n\nReview of Parameters of Fingerprint Classification Methods Based on Algorithmic Flow\n\n33\n\n3 Conclusion and Future Work Fingerprint classification is a challenging pattern recognition task that has captured the interest of several researches during the last 30 years. A number of approaches and various feature extraction strategies have been proposed to solve this problem.A Parameter based flow diagram has been generated which will provide a base for the user to understand the approach used for building the algorithm for fingerprint classification. Various approaches of fingerprint classification like rule based, neural network based, genetic algorithm based, ridge flow based reveals that neural network based classification provides better results compared to other techniques. Neural Network using back-propagation algorithm gives good results as it learns complex relationship but it consumes a lot of time for training. In Future we would like explore various pre-processing techniques so as to get accurate orientation map followed by final classification result.\n\nReferences 1.
