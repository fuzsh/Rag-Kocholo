        "text": "Reclaiming our History | Decoding the Ramayana: The *real* Shri Ram: Whether he was a \"bad husband\" and what is 'Ram-Rajya'? (Part-VIII)\n\nAuthor's Note:Please visit -The 'Real' Ramayana/ Ram-Rajya- to read the other parts of this series, so as to be able to fully understand or grasp the contents of this one.\n\nNow, let us discuss as to: *who* was this great woman -Kaikeyi, rather: where did she hail from.[Do read: Part-VI and Part-VII - so as to get the drift.]Also:an overview of some ancient clans and the etymology of the word 'Hindu'.\n\nKaikeyi (very likely) belonged to a group of people that was collectively known as the 'Arya' or the 'Aryaee'. This group originated in modern Kashmir (ancient: Kashyap-pur, after Rishi Kashyap - and it is from Kashyap-pur that modern 'Kashmir' derives its name.]\n\nThe 'Arya' or the 'Aryaee' people were noble-minded, noble-hearted or noble-natured people. They followed a 'way of life' that was distinct. Noble-heartedness gained precedence over everything else. Over a period of time - when the population grew, and various groups fanned out in search of greener pastures, they still (largely) retained this noble 'way of life'. They did not indulge in slave-taking or pillaging, they did not harm the children, the elderly and the sick, they did not harm the livestock, especially the cows; and they did not molest or rape women. They did not kidnap or covet other people's spouses either. This is because: such acts were against the Arya 'way of life'.\n\n[We will discuss about the origins of this group in our subsequent posts.]\n\nSome groups of the 'Arya' or the 'Aryaee' worshiped the Sun (Surya); others worshiped the Moon (Chandra), the Nags (the serpents) and the Fire (Agni).\n\nAs for the Nag-worshipers, we can still find traces: Anant-Nag, Shesh-Nag.\n\nOver a period of time, as the population grew, various groups branched out in different directions - in search of greener pastures (and also to escape the intense cold weather). Certain groups, including the fire-worshiping clans, first moved to 'Sapta-Sindhu' (ancient Punjab, and thiswould have been a much larger area than we know of today) and established themselves there.\n\nLater on, some of them (members of various Arya clans, that is) moved to ancient Persia and beyond. Some moved to ancient Kamboja. Our ancient texts tell us that there were two Kambojas: eastern and western Aśvakas(on either side of what is today known as the Hindu Kush) - covering areas that come under modern Iran (ancient Persia), modern Afghanistan, the Balti areas, etc. Certain Avesta-speaking tribes or clans from ancient Persia too may have migrated to ancient Kamboja.\n\n[Groups of various Arya clans moved to ancient Bactria (Bakhtria) and beyond. And: over a period of time, some retained their Arya 'way of life', others lost much of their 'Arya-ness', if I can call it thus. Some possibly lost their 'Arya-ness' to such an extent that they may have turned into and/or been referred to by the other Arya groups as: Mlechhaor Yavana. The latter were the terminologies or names assigned to savage barbaric groups or tribes [such as: the Sakas, the White Hunas, the Red Hunas, etc.]\n\n[Note: The name Afghānistān, comes from the Sanskrit word Upaganasthan, meaning: 'land of the allied tribes'. We can say: Upaganasthan was the Vedic name of Afghanistan.\n\nIt was also known as Gandhara.\n\nIn ancient times: the horse was a much sought-after animal or means of transport in these parts (ancient Kambojas). So much so that it became indispensable and an integral part of the people's lives. The people took pride in horsemanship. In Sanskrit, ashv means 'horse'. The generic term for these horsemen was Ashvaka (or Aśvakan) - in Sanskrit.\n\nThey were also known as: Assaka - derived from the Prakrit Assa (meaning: horse). Aśvaka/Aśvakan or Assaka literally meant: someone connected with the horses: a horseman, or a cavalryman or \"breeder of horses\".\n\nAśvaka is also interpreted as 'land or home of horses'. Kamboja is regularly mentioned as \"the country of horses\" (Asvanam ayatanam), and it was perhaps this well-established reputation that won for the horse-breeders of ancient Suvastu and surrounding areas (modern: Bajaur and Swat) the designation Aspasioi (from the Old Pali aspa) and Assakenoi (from the Sanskrit asva - \"horse\").\n\nAshv became Aspa or Asp in ancient Persian, while Ashvaka (or Ashvakan) became Aspagan and Sthanbecame Stan. So, thanks to the excellent breed of horses and the sharp horsemanship of the people there, Upaganasthan gave way to Aspaganistan (Persian). ... And over time Aspaganistan became: Afghanistan.]\n\nThe Kambojas were famous for their horses (ashv or aśva) and as expert cavalry-men (aśva-yuddha-Kuśalah). Ashvakas (or Aśvakas), 'horsemen', was the term popularly applied to them. The Aśvakas inhabited Eastern Afghanistan, and were included within the more general term: Kambojas.\n\nThey (the Aśvakas) were especially engaged in the occupation of breeding, raising and training war-horses, as also in providingexpert cavalry services to outside nations (sort of: freelancing). Hence: they also constituted an excellent class of warriors (Kshatriyas).\n\nMuch later: some of these Kambojas (various groups, tribes or clans from these parts) moved eastwards; and while some got absorbed along the way, others kept going eastward and established a third Kamboja, better known as: Kambuja Desha (modern Cambodia and surrounding areas.)\n\n[Note: It is possible that after a period of time some of the Arya clans that had moved to ancient Persia returned to 'Sapta-Sindhu'. However, due to the passage of time and other cultural crosscurrents (e.g. influence of the Avesta-speaking people), their language and phonetics too may have undergone some alteration. Therefore, due to the changed phonetics, they now referred to 'Sapta-Sindhu' as Hapta-HAndu. [Just like Ashv became Asp.]\n\nThe Avesta-speakers probably also referred to 'Sapta-Sindhu' as Hapta-HAndu.\n\n'Sindhu' is a reference to the sacred River Sindhu (also: River Indus). Sapta = Seven. [The Sarasvati River is now lost.]\n\n'Hindu' is derived from 'HAndu', which in turn is derived from 'Sindhu'.\n\nIn Old Persian the 'S' for Sindhu becomes 'H' (due to lack of phonetics). Therefore: Sapta Sindhu becomes Hapta HAndu. 'HAndu' later became 'Hindu'.And thereafter: the name 'Hindu' has stuck.]\n\nHope we are reasonably clear on this.\n\n... Lets get back to Kaikeyi.\n\nKaikeyi was from the Kekaya Mahajanapada (kingdom) and hailed from a [Kshatriya] clan known as the 'Kekaya', 'Kaikaya' or the 'Kaikeya'. Hence her name was Kaikeyi (i.e. belonging to the Kaikeyas) - it also refers to the ruling family of the Kekaya clan, to whom Kaikeyi belonged. She was the daughter of the mighty Ashwapati (Aśwapati; or the 'Lord/Master of Horses') - a long-term ally of Ayodhya.\n\nThis clan may not have been 'free-lancers', i.e. they may not have been part of clans or tribes that provided expert cavalry services to outside nations or to invaders.\n\nHer brother Yudhajeet (who later became the 'Ashvapati') - too was an ally of Ayodhya. Yudhajeet and Bharata (Kaikeyi's son) conquered the neighbouring kingdom of Gandhara and built the city of Taksha-sila (named after one of Bharata's sons: Taksha.) Bharata built yet another city - Pushkala-vati(named after his other son: Pushkala.) Pushkalavati is modern Peshawar.\n\nTaksha and Pushkala were Bharata and Mandavi's sons. Mandavi was Sita's cousin and the daughter of Kushadwaj - the younger brother of Sita's foster-father Sheeradwaj. [Sheeradwaj is best known as RajaJanak. But 'Janak' was actually the title forall the kings of Viveha - also known as Janakpuri.]\n\nTaksha-sila: to the east of the river Indus (the Sindhu Nadh), was known to Alexander and the Greeks as: Taxila.\n\nPushkala-vati (meaning: Lotus City): to the west of the river Indus, was known to Alexander and the Greeks as: Peukelaotis.\n\nLater: the sons and descendants of Bharata ruled this region from Takshasila. Takshashila, the place where the famed university existed, gets its name from Taksha (son of Bharat). Bharat - as we know, was the younger brother of Shri Ram. Taksha ruled over the kingdom of Taksha Khanda, which even extended beyond modern-day Uzbekistan, and Tashkent - the present day Uzbek capital also gets its name from Taksha/Takshashila.\n\nLakshman had two sons, Angada and Chandraketu (with his wife Urmila). Shri Ram (as per the advice of Bharat) founded the kingdom of Karupada (in the Western regions) - for Angada and the kingdom of Chandrakanti (in the Northern regions: Malwa country) - for Chandraketu.\n\n[Urmila was Sita's sister and the daughter of Sheeradwaj - Raja Janak.]\n\nShatrughna had two sons, Suvahu and Shatrughati (with his wife Shrutakirti). The former became king of Mathura, and the latter ruled in Vidisha. [Shrutakirti was Sita's cousin - daughter of Kushadwaj- and sister of Bharata's wife, Mandavi.]\n\nRam and Sita's twins: Kushruled from the Southern parts of Koshala, while Luv ruled from Northern Koshala. Shri Ram set up the city of Kusha-vati (near the Vindhya ranges) - for Kush, and the city of Shravastipur - for Luv.\n\n………………………………………………………………….\n\nKaikeyi's clan (the Kekayaor the Kaikeya clan) was (very likely) a fire-worshiping 'Arya' clan or Agnihotris - originally.\n\n[Madri of the Mahabharatahailed from yet another such 'Arya' clan known as the 'Madras', 'Madrakas' or the 'Medes' (also: Madai) - which too had migrated to ancient Persia; later on: some of them probably returned to 'Sapta-Sindhu'. Gandhari was an 'Arya' hailing from ancient Gandhar.]\n\nBoth the Madras (or the Madrakas), and the Kekayas (or the Kaikeyas) were the direct descendants of Raja Yayati's son: Anu. Yayati's other sons were: Puru, Yadu, Turvasha and Druhya.\n\nPuru started the Puruvansh(the Puru lineage), while the eldest - Yadu - started the Yaduvansh(the Yadu or the Yadav lineage).\n\nPuru is the progenitor of the Puru clan i.e. the Bharatas (from which 'Bharat-Varsh' derives its name).\n\nThe Suryavanshi Ikshvaku clan or the KshatriyaSun-worshiping Ikshvaku clan is a part of the 'Puruvansh'. The most famous personality of this clan has been: Ramchandra Dasaratha Ikshvaku, best known as: the 'Warrior-Saint' - Bhagavan Shri Ram. [The Ikshvaku clan is also known as: Raghuvaṃśa or Raghukula after Raghu - a valourous king of this clan, lineage or dynasty. Raghu was an ancestor of Shri Ram.]\n\n[Ikshvaku: In Sanskrit = Ikṣvāku. In Pāli: Okkāka.]\n\nAnother famous personality from the Puru clan (or the 'Puruvansh') is Siddhartha Śuddhodana Śākya, best known as: the 'Sage-Prince' - BhagavanShri Gautam Buddh. He is also referred to as: Śākyamuni. [Muni and Buddh = an enlightened person.]\n\nHe hailed from the Kshatriya Suryavanshi or the Sun-worshiping Śākya clan.\n\n[Please Note: When I say Shri Ram was a 'Warrior-Saint', it should not (in any way whatsoever) be construed as an inclination towards celibacy or a propensity towards asceticism. (That can be attributed to Bhagavan Shri Gautam Buddh, not to Shri Ram.)\n\nA slight examination of the nature of the relationship between Ram and Sita will make this amply clear. Of all the emperors (Samraat) and kings (Rajas), only Ram has been a one-woman man: ek-patni. And this itself is the unmistakable indicator: it not only speaks volumes about Ram and Sita and what they shared; but it also says a lot about Sita and her influence on Ram. Don't you think?\n\nAnd: none of it (even remotely) point towards 'celibacy' or 'asceticism'. As to: how all this has managed to unfailingly eludethe 'scholarly' eyes and 'sharp' minds of various people and entities - is beyond me though. Perhaps: I am not as 'scholarly' or as 'sharp-minded' myself. :)\n\nFrankly: it does not take any effort to figure out that Ram and Sita were (and remain) soul mates in every sense of the word. [It is always: Sita-Ram or Siya-Ram.]\n\nStrangely: we have whole bunches of 'knowledgeable' characters that misrepresent what Sita's 'Agni-Pariksha' was all about, and then blithely twist certain texts to say that: 'Ram subjected Sita to purification rituals since her chastity was questioned'...!\n\nHa...!!\n\nUnfortunately: there is nocure for self-inflicted ignorance, and we have no shortage of such ignoramuses. :( :( :(\n\nWe will of course discuss what Sita's 'Agni-Pariksha' actually means, in our next post.]\n\nFor now: lets get back to where we left off.\n\nYayati's eldest son, Yadu - is the founder of the ChandravanshiYadavvansh or the Moon-worshiping Kshatriya Yadav clan. The most famous member of this clan is: Krishna Vasudev Yadav, best known as: the 'Soldier-Statesman' - Bhagavan Shri Krishn.]\n\n... Lets return to Kaikeyi.\n\nThere is a strong possibility that she may have hailed from the 'Kekaya' or the 'Kaikeya' clans settled in ancient Suvastu (modern: Swat Valley). I say this, 'coz I have come across a 'Ramji's seat' in that area, during the course of my readings. Also: the Kekaya clan is said to have dwelt between Gandhara and the Vipasa Nadi (modern: Beas river).\n\nThese areas were a mix of breathtaking landscape interspersed with rugged terrains and mountains. ...And horses. In ancient times, the horse was a much sought-after animal or means of transport here. So much so, it was indispensable and an integral part of the people's lives.\n\nIt was on account of their supreme position in horse (Ashva) culture that the ancient Kambojas were also popularly known as Ashvakas, i.e. horsemen. Their clans in the Kunar and Swat valleys (ancient: Suvastu) have been referred to as Assakenoi and Aspasioi in classical writings, and Ashvakayanas and Ashvayanas in Pāṇini's Ashtadhyayi (Aṣṭādhyāyī, meaning: \"eight chapters\".)\n\n[The Classical writers used the respective equivalents Aspasioi or Aspasii (Hippasii) and Assakenoi (or Assaceni/Assacani).]\n\nThe aadi kavi (the 'first poet') Maharshi Valmiki has also documented Kaikeyi's skills as a warrior (including her skills with horses) - in the Ramayana.\n\nIt is possible that these people (some tribes and clans of the Kambojas including the Kaikeyas) were originally 'fire-worshipers' or 'Agnihotris' (or maybe Suryavanshis or Sun-worshipers even). Later, due to their affinity for horses and the fact that they became expert horsemen, probably influenced some groups (or maybe one group, clan or tribe that was most attached to the horse) to worship the horse or give it the pride of place in their culture.\n\nI say this: 'coz one of the avatars - an extension of the more famous 'Dasavatara' that we have - is the Hayagreeva (with a human body and a horse's head).\n\n[Based on our discussions so far, in this series, I hope it is amply clear by now that the 'Dasavatara' essentially portrays the evolution of the earth, and the evolution of the human species as well.]\n\nThis one group or tribe that was most attached to the horse (probably) became known as the 'Children of the Horse' or 'Son of the Horse' - the Aspzai. The Greeks called them the Aspasioi. [Panini's Ashvakayanas is very likely an amalgamation of two words: Ashvaka + Tanaya. Tanaya = son and Asva = horse, while: Ashvaka = horsemen.]\n\nMuch later, thanks to various crosscurrents that blew over this land, the asp became Esop.\n\nThus: after a long, convoluted and eventful journey that spanned not just centuries but eras (yugs), some of the Ashvaka first became Aspagan, then Aspzaii.e. Ashvakayanas (Aspasioi to the Greeks) and finally the Esopzai- better known as the Yusufzai.\n\n[To my mind: It is Kaikeyi's Arya background and her Kshatriya nature that prompted her to uphold 'Arya-dharma' and 'Kshatriya-dharma' (the 'way of life' or the 'guiding principles' of an Arya, and that of a brave-heart i.e. of a warrior or a Kshatriya). The same goes for Ram and Sita too.It is Kaikeyi's noble nature and iron-will that would have prompted Ram and Sita to seek her help - for the greater good.]\n\nKaikeyi undoubtedly would have been an extremely beautiful woman and a class warrior. But she was also made of pure damascene steel, don't you think? How else she might have been able to withstand the scorn, ridicule, etc hurled at her for so many years? DittoManthara. [Ravana succumbed, remember? Do read - Part-III.]\n\nWithout these two great women's steadfastness and noble-heartedness, a lot of good would not have been achieved. What say you?\n\nParting shot:It is important that we cleanse our ancient texts of all the mistranslations, misinterpretations and impurities that have seeped in over time... the sooner the better. 'Coz not only our understanding of the Ramayanis totally wrong, our understanding and interpretation of the Mahabharatatoo is wide off the mark. Why - you ask? Well, since we have not been able to understand and figure out the awesome technologies and the camouflaged language (metaphors, imagery, etc) mentioned in them, we have, therefore, taken the easy way out: by blithely turning our pracheen itihasa (ancient history) into excessively moralistic discourses, confrontation between 'good' and 'evil' and sundry soap opera-style narratives - involving revenge, jealousy... and the like.\n\nIncidentally: we do not have a concept of 'evil' in our culture. This is because we have the concept of 'Chareiveti'. [Do read:Link.]\n\n(Do stay tuned…)\n\nPictures:TheHayagreeva (also: Hayagriva).\n\n↧\n\n↧\n\nReclaiming our History | Decoding the Ramayana: The *real* Shri Ram: Whether he was a \"bad husband\" and what is 'Ram-Rajya'? (Part-IX)\n\nAuthor's Note:Please visit -The 'Real' Ramayana/ Ram-Rajya- to read the other parts of this series, so as to be able to fully understand or grasp the contents of this one.\n\nWhat does'Maryada Purushottam'mean?The*truth*about the much-trumpeted 'Lakshman Rekha', and some thoughts on:*what*the 'contemporisation' of the Ramayan and the Mahabharata has achieved.\n\nThe Ramayana is not a discourse about a woman's 'chastity', 'purity' or 'devotion' to her husband. It is not a story of triumph of 'good' over 'evil'. It is nota story about morality: including excessive morality or soap-opera-style narratives. It is not a story about magical beings or supra-magical powers.\n\nUnfortunately: it is us that have turned it into all of these... and more.\n\nThe Ramayan - is a romance; a romance like no other. It also tells us about the people (a completely different set of humans), society, knowledge, technologies and the 'way of life' that prevailed in another era (yug) - the Treta Yug (the 2nd era).\n\nIt is a part of our ancient history (pracheen itihasa) as well as a testimony (or treatise) about how men and women - together - can achieve great things, and thereby undo a lot of social ills despite considerable odds: through sheer dint of action. In other words: through Karm Yog.\n\nThe Ramayana is not about excessive and foolish display of noble-heartedness vis-à-vis a possible adversary. Ram is nota one-dimensional, frozen-faced, celibate and wannabe ascetic either. He is absolutelynot a Sri Chaitanyadev-like figure for sure. Ram is a warrior, a red-blooded Kshatriya and an Arya as well. His primary concern is the welfare of his kingdom and of his praja (subjects). His aim is to secure the borders of his kingdom and undo various social ills and negative perceptions prevailing in society (at that time and era). And he knew how to find a way - to achieve all of this - despite the many constraints placed on him by various entities that wielded a lot of influence and power (that were even greater than the king). And despite the many dynamics resulting out of the accepted rules and norms prevalent in society in that era. [Do read: Part-I and Part-VII - to get the drift.]\n\nThat is why Ram is known and hailed as a 'Maryada Purushottam' i.e. as someone who can not only overcome various constraints put forth by an assortment of entities, rules and norms - but also achieve certain tasks that are good for the people and for society. ['Maryada Purushottam' does not mean 'Perfect Man' or 'Ideal Man'. A 'Maryada Purush' = one who accepts the prevalent rules and norms (maryada) and abides by them. Ram (and Sita) did not accept the injustices of their time. They chose to undo them instead. [Do read:Part-I and Part-II.]Hence: Ram is a 'Maryada Purushottam' (and not a 'Maryada Purush'). And unlike Bhagavan Shri Gautam Buddh, he did not have any inclination or propensity towards 'celibacy' or 'asceticism'. Let us be clear on that. He was a 'Warrior-Saint' or a 'Rajarshi' - simply because he was concerned about and worked for the welfare of his praja(people). Ram's memory lives on because of his extraordinary life and because of his extraordinary reign, which was obviously a period of great peace and prosperity, making Ram-Rajya a reference point. People only remember the very good or the very bad. No one has been (nor will ever be) able to etch their name in the heart, mind and soul of the people - on the strength of *anything else*.]\n\nRam knew how to preempt an unwanted situation, rather than wait for the consequences to materialize (which would have made things even more difficult and complicated). His handling of Sugreeva's brother Bali (also: Vaali) - is an indicator of this. Those who go about beating-around-the-bush should perhaps answer what did Garuda gain by displaying innocent faith and extreme noble-mindedness vis-à-vis the smiling fire-breathing Nag(dragon) in 1962.\n\n[Btw, the Arya Nag-worshipers are not to be confused with this Nag.]\n\nRam's handling of the situation turned Ayodhya, Kishkindhya, Jamvanta Nagari and Lanka into staunch allies, and thereby ensured peace. Ram, Lakshman, Sugreeva, Angad, Hanuman, Jambavan, Vibhishan, et al became personal friends. Thisfurther ensured that there was no loss of precious lives and property in unwanted skirmishes, and that there was no unnecessary drainage of time, energy and resources - in fighting each other or being wary of each other.\n\nElse: the situation would not have been much different from what we now find between India, Kukri-land, Lama-land and Dragon-land.\n\n[Also: Videha, Kosala, Kashi and Kekaya Mahajanapada (kingdom) were already allies - due to the presence of Sita, Kaushalya, Sumitra and Kaikeyi respectively.]\n\nIf you read the Mahabharata, you will find echoes of Ram (and his handling of Bali) in Krishna and the way he handles certain situations. In the Srimad Bhagavad Geeta, Krishna pays the highest tributes to Ram, while describing that unseen abstract force known as the divine:\n\n\"I am the Wind among the purifiers, and Shri Rama among the warriors.\"\n\nRemember: Krishna is not describing himself. He is talking about the best of creation and action. [To my mind: in a way he is also paying his 'gurudakshina' - and Krishna was much better placed than all of us put together - to know the real story of Ram and Sita, minus all the 'embellishments'. However, when he mentions Ram, do remember that he is also implying Sita. 'Coz Ram and Sita are inseparable. It is always Sita-Ram or Siya-Ram.]\n\nMuch later, in the current era (i.e. in the 4th era or the Kali Yug) we find echoes of Ram and Krishna in Chanakya. The latter's actions (along with protégé Chandragupta Maurya) saved this great land from being plundered, and our culture and 'way of life' from being annihilated by Mlechhas (the white python that had arrived at the gates of ancient India.)\n\nHowever: Ram could not have achieved all that he achieved without the help and support of Sita, Kaikeyi and Mandodari.\n\nSimilarly: Krishna could not have achieved all that he achieved without the assistance of his paternal aunt: Kunti and that of his sakhior best friend - Draupadi.\n\nIf Ram and Krishna are known to have played the role of a 'balancing force' (i.e. have been equated with Vishnu or Narayan) in their respective eras - since their actions helped society and civilization to flourish well, then Sita, Kaikeyi and Mandodari (in Ram's case) and Draupadi and Kunti (in Krishna's case) have played the role of Narayani.\n\nRam, Sita, Krishn, Chanakya, et al are Karm Yogis. Their actions were for the greater good and have helped society (i.e. Nishkam Karm). Whatever they have done was for Loka Kalyana.\n\nRam, Sita, Krishna and Hanuman are humans. Their divinity is a matter of faith and I have no comments to offer on that: 'coz to each his (or her) own. To me: they have always been humans; the kind of humans that one would love to have a conversation with over cups of steaming hot masala chai or filter coffee.\n\nFrankly: if we are to observe closely, we will find Ram and Krishna to be very similar. They both come across as quiet, intense, knowledgeable people that are also perceptive and possess great foresight. They do not come across as boastful or flamboyant characters. [At least to me.]\n\nHowever: the image that we have of Krishna is the one courtesy the 'Raas-Leela'. But Krishna and the 'Raas-Leela' or the 'Gopis' have absolutely nothing to do with each other. 'Coz all of these are later additions, very likely: in the last millennium or so. And much of it has gained credence and momentum thanks to the well-known Bhakti Movement.\n\nWe are told that Krishna sang and danced with the Gopis (or the 'milk-maids') as a young boy. In reality: he would have been a student in Rishi Sandipan's ashram - being put through a rigorous training regimen (wherein he would be busy learning math, science, economics, literature, the ancient texts, warfare, and the like.)\n\nYet, we believe the Krishna-Gopi stories or the Radha-Krishna stories. :)\n\nDespite knowing that Radha and Krishna were not even contemporaries! Krishna lived in the 3rd era - the Dvapar Yug. While: Radha appears through Jayadeva's 'Geet-Govind' (also: Gita Govinda) - and that is barely a millennium old.\n\nIt is possible that Radha may have been a Meerabai-like figure and was part of an earlier reform movement that predated the Bhakti Movement - by a few centuries. And she may have been a devotee of Krishna (and probably also composed and sung Bhajans dedicated to him). Over time: the lines have blurred, and Radha and Krishna have become entwined, so much so that they have become part of our psyche. And just as Meerabai's \"love\" for Krishna is celebrated, Radha's \"love\" for Krishna too is celebrated - but with considerably greater fervour.\n\nBut does that mean Krishna and Radha have ever interacted?\n\nNo.\n\nDoes that mean Krishna had anything to do with Vrindavanever?\n\nNo.\n\nDoes that mean Krishna had anything to do with all the numerous 'Raas-Leela' stories?\n\nNo.\n\nYet, all of these have become an inseparable and integral part of his persona...!\n\n[Frankly: some of these stories came about to essentially inculcate some ethics and values - such as: to leave aside one's pride or ego in order to be truly enlightened, and to put forth the merits of humility and service to mankind, etc. Or in order to mainstream some groups of humans like the third gender i.e. the tritiya prakriti. While several other stories came about since people simply wanted to amuse themselves. However: none of these stories were meant to be taken at face value or literally. Many of them are allegorical and some of them can simply be ignored.]\n\nSometimes what we create transcends reality... and envelopes it as well. Even to such an extent: that we come to totally accept and believe in it - as actual events or as reality.\n\n...And just as it has happened to Krishna, so it has happened to Ram and Sita.\n\nRam and Sita were humans. But the humans of the Treta Yug (or the Dwapar Yug) would have been nothing like us - 'modern humans' of the 4th era (the Kali Yug) - in any way whatsoever; be it: in strength, height, appearance, caliber, knowledge, intelligence, and so on and so forth. And their principles or 'way of life' would have also differed vastly from ours.\n\nStrangely: the current versions of the Ramayana(or for that matter: the Mahabharata) do not dwell on any of this.\n\nFrom whatever we can figure out (or gather) is: there are references to a variety of aircraft (vimanas), awesome technology (including: 'holographic images' and advanced medical science) as well as powerful weaponry (astrasand shastras) - but the current versions of the Ramayan (or the Mahabharata) do not dwell on any of them at all...!\n\nAll of these have been blithely referred to as 'trickery' or 'illusion', and then attributed to either super-human powers or to magic...!\n\nAs for the powerful weaponry: they have been reduced to ordinary bows and arrows. Humans (like Ram, Sita, Kaikeyi, Vibhishan, etc) have been brought down to the level of 'modern humans' - complete with a love for weepy, soap-opera-style narratives. A human Ravana has been depicted with 10 physical heads (while 'dasanan' or the ten-headed one was just an allusion to Ravan's great intelligence, vast ego and possibly: 10 kingdoms). Unfortunately: various jokes, etc have also been weaved around his (supposedly) ten heads (e.g. how he might have fed all those 10 heads, how he slept, and the like) - and this too has contributed towards strengthening the perception that he was a gigantic figure with 10 heads.\n\nOther groups of humans have been turned into monkeys, bears... and even birds! Yes, birds.\n\nTell me: how many folks (rather generations) have been and are totally convinced that Garuda and Jatayu were birds?!!\n\nWell...?\n\nUnfortunately: a lot of effort (misinterpretation, mistranslations, flights of fantasy, contemporisation, etc) have gone into turning Shri Ram into an 'avatar' or 'physical manifestation' of Shri Vishnu; a lot of effort have gone into turning a fiery Sita into a groveling, weepy, helpless character. A lot of effort has gone into turning Kaikeyi and Manthara into villainous figures. And a lot of effort has gone into turning Ravana into a 'demon' and the very incarnation of 'evil'.\n\n...And we have happily believed all of this and lapped them up, and what's more, learnt it all by rote too: even though we do not have a concept of 'demon' or 'evil' - in our culture!\n\nBut why only this? We absolutely believe and accept what is popularly known as the 'Hindu Trinity', despite not having such a concept...!!\n\nFrankly: given our propensity towards learning by rote and inclination towards trusting hearsay, we have never even bothered to read - let alone examine or scrutinize the narratives - for irregularities, impurities and contemporisation ('add-on'). We have simply accepted whatever has been dished out to us - even by the ones that have a clear amnesia with respect to: Mary, Joan or Padmini, or by the ones who feel that the epitome of romance (or fair-mindedness) - is to bury alive a beloved. Or by the ones that have been trying their bestest to label people as 'celibate' - as soon as they (the supposedly 'celibate' ones) attain even an iota of greatness.\n\nEven one reading of what is today known as the Valmiki Ramayan will bring out the discrepancies in the narrative - very clearly and without much ado. There have been clear mistranslations and misinterpretations: due to a complete misunderstanding of the advanced weaponry and technologies mentioned; due to a lack of understanding of what the many different groups of humans were all about (the modern versions of whom are today known as: tribal people, backwards, etc) and due to various people's utter inability to decode the camouflaged language (metaphors, imagery).\n\n...And also due to multiple attempts to contemporise it [for the sake of stage-shows, bigger audience, etc.]\n\nI have said this before and I say it again. That: after the demise of the Gupta era, this land has undergone huge turbulence. What a wondrous land was ancient India, what scientific and technological advances were achieved - until the Gupta era - is well documented by greats like: Varahamihira, Aryabhatta, Brahmagupta, Pingala, Bhaskaracharya, Sushruta, Charaka, et al. But what has been achieved after that?\n\nThe light of education and knowledge was extinguished from every home across the length and breadth of the country - barring the ones that belonged to those that were chameleon-like.\n\nThe only means of entertainment was stage shows, street plays, melas (fairs) and the like. And (hence) the only way to carry forward (and ensure the survival of) what was our ancient history (pracheen itihasa) was through these stage shows, street plays, emotion-filled poetry, songs, wandering theatres and wandering minstrels. And is it very difficult to figure out what has happened?\n\nOne result of it is very clearly in front of us: the much-celebrated 'Ram-Leela', wherein: even Vibhishan's effigy is burnt with much gusto, despite him having been a friend and ally of Ram...!\n\nToday: it is an accepted fact that what is known as the Valmiki Ramayana - is the work of several people, besides the 'aadi kavi' or the first poet - MaharshiValmiki.\n\nValmiki Ramayana is the \"aadi\" (original) Ramayana. It is an accepted fact that the ValmikiRamayana originally consisted of five parts: starting from the 'Ayodhya Khanda' to the 'Yuddha Khanda' and that: the Bal-khanda and the Uttar-khandachapters (of the Valmiki Ramayana) were later additions.\n\nAmazingly: the much-bandied-about 'Lakshmana Rekha' story (in the 'Aranya Khanda') is notpart of the original, the Valmiki Ramayana.\n\nThis 'story' can be attributed to Tulsidas and his very fertile as well as emotional imagination and disposition (that was also a clear refection of his times.) And to his magnum opus, the widely popular: 'Ramcharitmanas' (which is also: Tulsidas' version of the Ramayan). Very likely: the entire conversation between Sita and Lakshman is his creation.\n\n[In the 'Lanka Kanda' of the 'Ramcharitmanas', Mandodari rebukes Ravan on his vociferous claims of valour - by hinting that his claim of strength and valour is shallow... since he could not even cross a small line drawn by Shri Ram's younger brother Lakshman.]\n\nQuite obviously: Tulsidas' excessive Bhakti and zeal to turn Ram into 'avatar' of (what he considered to be) Shri Vishnu - may have motivated him to weave such (imaginary) events and anecdotes into the narrative.\n\nAnd given the passage of time and other factors (including the huge popularity of the 'Ramcharitmanas' + the turbulence that this great land underwent), lines have become blurred and this imaginary story of the 'Lakshman Rekha' has (unfortunately) become a part and parcel of Ram and Sita's story.\n\nToday: this 'add-on' story is bandied about everywhere...! But with what result?\n\n[There is a very good chance that the entire conversation between Sita and Lakshman is Tulsidas' creation. Do read and decide for yourself.]\n\nAlso:Hanuman, Sugreeva, Angad and the 'Van-nar Sena' were humans, notmonkeys. The Rikshas were humans (forest-dwellers with a bear totem) - and not bears. The kinnars were humans (forest-dwellers with a tiger-mask or totem). Yet the narrative has clearly turned them into animals: monkeys and bears...!\n\nJatayu has been turned into a bird(!) though he was very much a human - belonging to a group of people that worshiped the vulture (or maybe the bald eagle).\n\nHanuman was the finest pilot of his era (hence he was variously referred to as: Maruti, Pavan-putra and Vaayu-putra). So, he would - no doubt - have been able to fly a variety of aircraft (vimanas). However: he wouldn't have been able to uproot trees, swallow the Sun or indulge in what is clearly 'monkey-business'. Ditto: the 'Van-nar Sena' (or the army consisting of forest-dwelling humans). [The 'Van-nar Sena' was not 'monkey-army' or 'an army of apes'.]\n\nTherefore:there has been a whole lot of misunderstanding, misinterpretation, mistranslation (including tweaking) weaved into the original narratives, apart from astonishing flights of fantasy - that has seeped in, in the last millennium or so - and all of this have resulted into distorted stories and perceptions.\n\n...There's more.\n\nMaharshi Valmiki has documented Kaikeyi's skills as a warrior (including her skills with horses) - in the Ramayana.\n\nHowever, all of a sudden we find Kaikeyi being described as: 'an unsteady woman, on account of her feminine nature...'\n\nWell, someone, somewhere clearly did not understand as to: why Kaikeyi did what she did, and why Ram along with Sita and Lakshman straightaway went to Dandaka Aranya (via Chitrakoot) - the moment he was asked to go into exile. And has therefore, tweaked the narrative. In the process: not only has a great woman been turned into a villainous figure, but also yet another great woman has beenlabeled as a scheming old hump-back. And: what's worse, the story itself has taken a completely different detour. [Do read: Part-VI and Part-VII - in order to get the drift.]\n\nWe also find:Kope Bhavan or 'Anger Room'.\n\nThis is a language and terminology of a much later time and era. One that is much closer to our current times: more specifically, it is a pre-renaissance-era language or lingo.\n\nFrankly:one can find clear and unmistakable echoes of the pre-renaissance era - in what is today known as the Valmiki Ramayan. [Do read and decide for yourself. But make sure to put on your thinking cap - while you are at it.]\n\n[Valmiki was originally a forest-dweller (Van-nar) belonging to the hunter (vyadh) community. In his youth, he was a brigand (dashyu) that looted people of their valuables. Later he changed, left his wayward ways and became a learned and venerableperson. Thereafter, he came to be known as: Maharshi Valmiki.]\n\nNow, whether Valmiki witnessed the events firsthand or heard it through another or from several persons, he would have simply documented certain facts and happenings. And these would have made for some to-the-point cut-and-dry narrative.\n\nUnfortunately: other people - down the ages (and especially in the last millennium or so) - have added their own perspective and thinking to it - in an attempt to 'flesh-out' the cut-and-dry original narrative. [None of these later embellishments is difficult to figure out though.]\n\nI say this 'coz: there are some quite erotic descriptions of Sita. I am unable to ascribe this to the 'aadi kavi' (the first poet) - MaharshiValmiki.\n\nThis has to be Mahakavi Kalidas' doing. And he has penned his version of the Ramayan too: known as the Kalidas Ramayan or the Raghuvamsa(also known as: the Raghuvamsam).\n\nPlus: It is very likely that all the separation related (viraha) stuff is Kalidas' contribution.\n\nKalidasa was particularly known for his fine exploitation of the sringara(erotic) element in his verse.\n\nMaharshi Valmiki and Kalidasa were two great poets - in their own right. But their eras, lives, disposition and outlook were totally different. And therefore, undoubtedly, their perceptions and thinking too would have differed greatly.\n\nMahakavi Kalidasa was an extremely... umm, romantic poet, i.e. his forte and genre was romance; the 'aadi kavi' Maharshi Valmiki was not.\n\nHence: I cannot believe that Valmiki would have been interested to know or document Sita's 'feminine charms'... etc, etc.\n\nStrangely: one finds similar erotic descriptions of Draupadi. And this too cannot be Maharshi Vedvyas's doing. It has got to be a latter-day kavi'swork.\n\nIn Part-I, we have mentioned about the sheer number of re-telling and versions of the Ramayana. And even if we are to only consider what is today known as the Valmiki Ramayana, we must remember that the manuscript of this work (whatever we have, that is) is not the one written by Valmiki himself.\n\nThis is because: a manuscript is not eternal. All manuscripts have a limited lifespan. And the ones that our ancients wrote on had a lifespan of about 600-650 years. Therefore, it is imperative that beforethe lapse of this said time period, these manuscript(s) had to be copied. And from the time Maharishi Valmiki wrote it - until now: it would have been copied innumerable times.\n\nAnd this is important: since with the passage of time and eras (yugs), language changes, phonetics change, the meaning of words and phrases change, society changes, perception changes, outlook changes, there are changes in the principles, norms, 'way of life', and so on and so forth. In fact, even the terrain and the flora and fauna (humans, plants and animals) do not remain the same.\n\nAnd it is unlikely that any manuscript would remain immune to various aspects of these changes... from successfully weaving their way into it.\n\nWhat?\n\nHowever: do also spare a thought regarding *what* gets altered and how, then takes on *what* hue and flavour, and finally: *what* it morphs into... and in the process *how* much knowledge and information is lost - forever, as a result of 'contemporisation'.\n\n[We will continue our discussions in the next post...]\n\n(Do stay tuned…)\n\nPicture:An illustration of MaharshiValmiki.\n\n↧\n\nReclaiming our History | Decoding the Ramayana: The *real* Shri Ram: Whether he was a \"bad husband\" and what is 'Ram-Rajya'? (Part-X)\n\nAuthor's Note:Please visit -The 'Real' Ramayana/ Ram-Rajya- to read the other parts of this series, so as to be able to fully understand or grasp the contents of this one.\n\nWho really was 'Jatayu'?The*myth*behind: 1.'Ravana slashing Jatayu's wings and Sita throwing down her jewellery.' 2. 'Ram fighting his twins: Luv and Kush'. Some thoughts on:the much-derided number:'33 crore', Krishna's 16000*wives*and *what*the 'contemporisation' of the Ramayan and the Mahabharata has achieved. [Do read: Part-IX– to get the drift.]\n\nLets continue from where we left off...\n\nTell me: how many folks (rather generations) have been and are totally convinced that Garuda and Jatayu were 'birds'?\n\nA whole lot of them... right?\n\nJatayu has been turned into a bird(!) though he was very much a human - belonging to a group of people that worshiped the vulture (or maybe the bald eagle). In other words: he belonged to a group or community that had a vulture totem or a bald eagle totem.\n\nAnd this group may have had something to do with Garuda. Meaning:it was probably a sub-group or a sub-clan of the one that Garuda belonged to.\n\nGaruda was not an eagle, but a human that belonged to a group or community with an eagle totem (or perhaps a falcon totem). He (very likely) hailed from the foothills of the Himalayas or surrounding areas. And if we are to read our ancient texts we will find: that there clearly has been a mortal Vishnu, a mortal Shiv, a mortal Parvati, a mortal Vaishnavi (now MataVaishno Devi or Maa Sherawali), a mortal Kaali (Bhadrakaali), a mortalGaruda... and so on.\n\nPerhaps they were part of the 1st era: the Satya/Sat/Krita Yug or the early part of the 2nd era: the Treta Yug.\n\n[Given the greatness of their deeds (keerti) they have been hailed and elevated to the status of the divine, or the unseen and formless forces or energies of the cosmos, also known as: Shiv, Vishnu, Kali and Shakti. Our ancients knew the constellation 'Aquila' as 'Garuda'.]\n\nJatayu and his brother (Sampati) were part of a clan or group that perhaps was an offshoot of the one that Garuda belonged to.\n\nYet they have been turned into birds...!\n\nIn the Ramayana, wherever different kinds of humans or technology have been mentioned, and all of it is far more advanced technology (than what we see today) - the later-day translators and writers have got confused.\n\nThe narrative tells us: the bird - Jatayu - heard Sita's cries for help and rushed to save her from being forcibly carried away by Ravana. She cried loudly and sought assistance, then threw down her jewellery, instructing Jatayu to inform Ram. Meanwhile: Ravana slashed Jatayu's wings and the great bird fell down - mortally wounded. Later: Ram and Lakshman found the dying Jatayu, who narrated the events and urged them to find Sita (and recover her from the clutches of the nefarious Ravana). Shortly afterwards, Jatayu succumbed to his wounds. We are also told that Ram and Lakshman wept and lamented - on hearing about Sita's abduction.\n\nBut Jatayu was not a bird...!\n\nRavana and Sita were (apparently) in Ravana's aircraft - the pushpak vimana. And it would have been a tightly closed vimana with no open windows etc. [As we know from our experiences with modern aircraft (or vimanas), we absolutely cannot open windows - while in the air. Ravan's Pushpak Vimana may have been far more superior or advanced than whatever aircraft we have today; but it couldn't have been an open-topped one, or a contraption with open windows. For sure.]\n\nSo the question of Sita's loud cries, throwing down of jewellery, or instructing Jatayu - does not arise.\n\nOr for that matter Ravana's merciless slashing of Jatayu's wings - with a sword.\n\nTherefore: this whole bird angle or throwing-down-jewellery angle or slashing of wings, etc, etc... cannot be Valmiki's work.\n\nAll of it is most certainly the result of the fertile imaginationof one or more later-day 'kavi' or poets' work, or that of one or more later-day dramatists.\n\nFrankly: these sort of things (high on emotion and fantastic narrative) help stage plays and street plays. Some centuries ago - given our situation - people would not have understood technology, aircraft, advanced weaponry or advanced medical science. Nor could these be depicted in stage plays, etc. Therefore: the story has taken a detour. ...And what we have with us today is (clearly) much '-embellished' version(s).\n\nValmiki is unlikely to have witnessed what happened @ Ashok Vatika. And therefore, he is absolutely unlikely to have written anything about it.\n\nAnd so: all that we read... are clearly the work of later 'kavis' (poets or dramatists) and a result of their imaginary narratives and add-on events.\n\nIn the process: humans too have turned into monkeys, bears, and even birds...!\n\nValmiki's original narrative would (very likely) have been some to-the-point, dry stuff. In the sense: he would have listed down some events, names, etc; and of course the weaponry, technology, et al.\n\nOther people (down the ages) did not quite figure out the technological aspects (due to a combination of factors: the difficult times, change in language, phonetics, perception, norms, et al)... and so, in an effort to 'flesh-out' the narrative (and to 'contemporise' it as well) - they have given it some other 'embellishments'. The result of all of this has been: that the story itself has taken on a different hue.\n\nAs you can see: from the 'Jatayu episode' and also from the 'Lakshman Rekha' incident. [Do read:Part-IX.]\n\nThe latter is the work of a much later-day 'kavi' or poet - Tulsidas and his version of the Ramayan [the 'Ramcharitmanas' - which is widely popular.]\n\nTulsidas was part of the Bhakti Movement and was also instrumental in starting what we know as: the Ram-Lila.\n\nSome stuff can be attributed to Mahakavi Kalidasa, or to Sri Chaitanyadev (who too was a part of the Bhakti Movement), and others (like: Krittibas Ojha). But we must remember that: none of these people were contemporaries of Valmiki. And hence have clearly relied on their respective imagination - and this in turn has been a reflection of their respective times (which is much closer to our current times.)\n\nAlso: someone, somewhere obviously did notunderstand as to: why Kaikeyi did what she did, and why Ram along with Sita and Lakshman straightaway went to Dandaka Aranya (via Chitrakoot) - the moment he was asked to go into exile. And has therefore, tweaked the narrative. In the process: not only has a great woman been turned into a villainous figure, but also yet another great woman has been labeled as a scheming old hump-back. But: what's worse, the story itself has taken a completely different detour.\n\nMuch heavy weather has been made about Dasarath's demise. However, if we are to read carefully, we will find the narrative also stating that Dasarath was very aged and suffering from a variety of old-age related ailments (jaragrasht); and that: he was extremely keen to get Ram's coronation over and done with.\n\nTo my mind: this is because, his physicians may not have given him a clean bill of health, and perhaps may have sounded the alarm bell too. And this in turn prompted Dasaratha to want to complete the succession process - as soon as possible.\n\n[We have already discussed the Shravan Kumar episode, the supposed 'curse' on Dasaratha and the birth procedure of Shri Ram and his siblings. There too, technology (advanced medical science) came into the picture. Later-day folks have not understood any of it, and so... the narrative has (unfortunately) changed. Do read:Part-V.]\n\nHowever: undoubtedly, all of these later-day 'embellishments' (heavy-duty, emotional stuff) would have helped draw bigger crowds @ stage plays, street plays, melas, Ram-lila, et al.\n\nFrankly: Valmiki (very likely) heard the story of Ram and Sita from other sources - and documented it, in his own way (and in the language that was spoken in his times). Much of it may have remained un-deciphered (by later-day translators, due to change in phonetics, etc), and so: the imaginations of various people have come into play - so as to 'fill in the blanks'. And this has undoubtedly and automatically 'contemporised' the narrative - without much ado.\n\n'Coz none of these later-day folks (poets, dramatists, singers, artists, painters, translators, et al) have witnessed that era (Treta Yug) - first-hand, and therefore: they would have (very obviously) relied on what they saw and found around themselves or gathered from a generation or two before them - in order to 'fill in the blanks'. [And all of this has without doubt resulted in the 'contemporisation' of the narrative.]\n\nThe entire narrative about Sita and Valmiki's ashram is a later-day 'add-on'.\n\nAs for the erotic descriptions of Sita [See: Part-IX]: I am aware that Vatsayan wrote the 'Kama-Sutra', and many of us have read Kalidasa's poems.\n\nHowever, what I am trying to say is this: that Valmiki was neither Vatsayan-like nor Kalidasa-like. So, his outlook and disposition would have been very different, and he would have only documented some events, names, technology, etc. [Btw, Valmiki was not Tulsidas-like or even Sri Chaitanyadev-like either. Valmiki was simply Valmiki - the 'aadi kavi'.]\n\n[Incidentally: Sri Chaitanyadev hailed from a region (Gauḍa, Gour, Gaur) which is part of the ruined city of Lakhnauti - and is associated with Lakshman. The city's ancient name was Lakshmanavati; 'Lakhnauti' is just the corrupted version - due to mispronunciation. This beautiful city was ransacked, plundered and razed to the ground by droves of barbaric Mlechchas. As to whether: Gauda, Gour or Gaur had anything to do with Garuda or not - I don't quite know.]\n\nMaharshi Valmiki is unlikely to have witnessed the events of the Ramayana himself. He has (very likely) gathered the details from other people (various learned persons and maybe from his teachers even.) I say this because: the Mahabharata has a far more detailed narrative despite having awesome technology, etc (though it too - sadly - has fallen prey to later 'embellishments' and 'contemporisation'.)\n\nHowever, none of that negates the fact that it is far more detailed. And the likely reason for this is that: Maharshi Vedavyas has been a major player in the happenings and events of the Mahabharata. He has not only witnessed the events - first-hand, but has also partaken in them. As you know, he was MaharshiParashar and Satyavati's son - born out of a short-term 'Gandharva vivaha'.\n\nAnd thus: the narratives (in the Ramayana) describing Ram fighting his twins - Luv and Kush (without knowing they were his twins, that is) - is also a later-day 'add-on'.\n\nI say this 'coz: I see a similar narrative in the Mahabharata too; where Arjun fights his son Babruvahan - withoutbeing aware that Babruvahan is his son.\n\nNow, why this likeness or similarity in the events/narrative - you may ask.\n\nThe answer to this is that: there have been some efforts invested (by a succession of people) in order to turn both Ram and Krishna into 'avatars' or 'physical manifestations' of Shri Vishnu (i.e. of what various people thought to be Shri Vishnu).\n\nAnd: some efforts have gone into turning Arjun into a (sort of) 'part' or 'manifestation' of Shri Krishna (and hence, by extension: a 'part' of Shri Vishnu as well).\n\n[In the process: two reformers and Karm Yogiswho were also Kshatriyas - Ram and Krishna, have been turned into Sri Chaitanyadev-like figures; a fiery Sita has been turned into a weepy, helpless character, Ravana has turned into the very incarnation of 'evil'; two great women - Kaikeyi and Manthara - have been turned into villainous characters; while two other great women - Draupadi and Kunti - have been conveniently sidelined, and a weak-willed Yudhisthira has come to be gloried as the 'Dharmaraj' or the very 'incarnation' of 'dharma' or righteousness...! :)]\n\nThese stories of Ram and Arjun fighting their respective sons - their own flesh and blood - and being defeated by them, was perhaps weaved into the narratives in order to reinforce the perception that since they (Ram and Arjun) were 'avatars' of Shri Vishnu, none - except their own flesh and blood - can defeat them.\n\nI see some echoes of these stories in the Rustam-Sohrabstory. [Rustam was a Persian hero and a favorite of King Kaykaus. Now, whether Kaykaus had anything to do with the ancient 'Kekeya', 'Kaikaya' or the 'Kaikeyas' - the clan from which Kaikeyi hailed - I do not know.]\n\nA few centuries ago there have been various movements: reform movements - yes, but also movements to debate the 'supremacy' of Shiv, Vishnu, Shakti - over each other...! An assortment of humans have led these various movements and they have squabbled - essentially to gain greater influence (for themselves and for their respective groups), though all of it has been routed through some or the other narrative or movement.\n\nThe names of Ram, Sita, Krishna, et al have (unfortunately) notremained immune to these various entities, movements and debates.\n\nRam is not 'avatar' (in the way some entities think or in the manner in which certain entities want to project him). Ram was a great human and a king (raja) - a 'Chakravarti Raja' at that. Meaning: he ruled over a vast kingdom. [Ram's memory lives on because of his extraordinary life and because of his extraordinary reign, which was obviously a period of great peace and prosperity, making Ram-Rajya a reference point. People only remember the very good or the very bad. No onehas been (nor will ever be) able to etch their name in the heart, mind and soul of the people - on the strength of *anything else*.]\n\nKrishna too was a human, a great human (a Yug Purush); he was also a 'guru' or guide and a king (raja). He too looked after the welfare of his praja (people) and avoided unnecessary bloodshed (i.e. the unnecessary loss of precious lives and property) - by moving to Dwarka. However: in due course, he successfully freed this great land of the spectre of the all-constricting Magadhan Python.\n\nSitting in Dvarka (also: Dvaravati) - this great man kept an eagle-eye over this great land, and did whatever had to be done - for the greater good (Loka Kalyana or Loka-sangraha).\n\nBoth Ram and Krishna were Kshatriyas (or warriors). Though much effort has gone into turning them into 'avatars' of (what various people - a majority of whom belonged to the priestly class - believed to be) Shri Vishnu. But allofthis is thanks to the 'efforts' of other people and movements. Neither Ram nor Krishna was Sri Chaitanyadev-like figures, and so their thinking or their outlook and disposition too would have been vastly different. As humans of totally different eras or yugs, they would have been nothing like us - 'modern humans' of the 4th era (the Kali Yug) - in any way whatsoever; be it: in strength, height, appearance, longevity, caliber, knowledge, intelligence, and so on and so forth. And their principles or 'way of life' would have differed greatly from ours.\n\nAlso: Krishna and Jambavan are unlikely to have met - ever, since both belonged to completely different eras (Treta and Dvapar - respectively). And hence: Krishna would have nothing to do with Jambavati either.\n\nAs we already know, he had nothing to do with the 'Gopis', the 'Raas-Leela' or with Radha. Or for that matter: with Meerabai. [Do read: Part-IX.]\n\nAs for his supposed 16,000 wives (some even put the figure to: 16,108) and 180,000 (supposed) sons: well, these are stories that later people created in order to amuse themselves. And therefore: they should be ignored (meaning: they should not be mixed with Krishna's persona or narrative in any way whatsoever). Many of these stories can be traced to the various movements, especially to the Bhakti Movement, various cults, and emotional and romantic poets; as well as to the kirtans, 'Raas-Leelas' and to figures like Sri Chaitanyadev.\n\n[If we are to examine the many stories associated with his supposed 'wives', it does become clear that many of these stories were later-day creations either for amusement purposes or to bring forth or convey some or the other lessons, values or ethics. Or in order to mainstream some marginalized groups like the tritiya prakriti (the third gender). Some of the stories were a result of cults, movements, paintings, poems and stage plays. Come to think of it: it is very likely that Krishna was only married to Rukmini, and that makes him the only king (apart from Shri Ram of course) to have been: ek-patni. Echoes of the Krishna-Rukmini story can be found in Sir Walter Scott's lovely poem: Lochinvar. That our ancient texts and literature have traveled far and wide is indisputable. The great German writer and artist - Goethe - has accepted that MahakaviKalidasa's work inspired him.]\n\nActually: a lot of these stories (about Krishna's 'wives') are allegorical. Just like 33 crore to our ancients meant: 'infinity'. And they used this figure (33 crore) to indicate that the unseen and formless forces of the universe are everywhere: omnipresent, omnipotent and omniscient. Whatever could be seen with our mortal eyes: plants, water-bodies, rocks, stones, soil, mountains, the sky, the elements, animals, people, the stars, the planets, et al - were part of (or physical 'manifestations' of) the formless forces of the cosmos. Creation is infinite. And for our ancients, 33 crore meant precisely that: infinity.\n\nThrough whatever could be viewed with our mortal eyes, the unseen and formless forces of the universe 'manifested themselves' (or in other words: could be 'seen'). Meaning: it was a medium for everyone to \"see\" the otherwise unseen and formless forces of the universe or the energies behind the cosmos (no matter what name has been assigned).\n\nTherefore: this figure - 33 crore - is not meant to be taken literally. [Also: at one point in time - when our friendly colonizers held sway - Indians were 33 crore, and the friendly colonizers were 3 lakh in number. For some great persons (freedom fighters, etc) these 33 crore Indians represented the divine.]\n\n[Note: It does not mean (in any way whatsoever) that there are 33 crore 'gods' in our pantheon; at least: not literally.]\n\nSimilarly, through the 16000 'wives' and 180,000 'sons' it is essentially being conveyed that: Krishna is part of every mortal: man, woman and child (and vice versa) - and that he represents all that is good and worthy. [Hence: these figures are not to be taken literally.]\n\nFrankly: all these stories are primarily a product of the many cults and movements that sprang up in Krishna's name (in much later times and era). And much of it can be attributed to the very well-known Bhakti Movement. [Members of this movement considered themselves 'married' to Shri Krishna.]\n\nTherefore: 'sons', 'wives' et al should not be taken at face value.\n\nEven our raags or ragas were classified as 'husband', 'wife' and even 'son'. Rāginī is a term for the \"feminine\" counterpart or \"wife\" to a rāga. The rāga-rāgini scheme from about the 14th century aligned 6 \"male\" rāgas with 6 \"wives\" (rāginis) and a number of sons (putras) and even 'daughters-in-law'.\n\nThe holiest of our ragas is Shri Bhairavi (another name for Maa Kaali - a part of Maa Shakti - the names assigned to the 'feminine' energies of the cosmos.) [Do read:Link.]\n\nThe corresponding raga of Shri Bhairavi is the Raga Bhairava (Bhairav or Bhairava is another name for Shiv - the 'moving' force behind the cosmos - and this force or energy (as per our ancients) must remain inert so that there is no cosmic turbulence (i.e. tandav nritya).\n\n[Incidentally: Shiv and Vishnu are one and the same: Hari-Hara. Hari = Vishnu. Hara = Shiv. Vishnu = Vish + Nu (Vish = poison). 'Shiv' spelt backwards is 'Vihs', i.e. 'Vish' or poison - in another form.]\n\nThere is a third raga - Raga Velavala - that is also referred to as the Ragaputra Velavala (i.e. 'son' of the raga Bhairava.) It is a soothing morning raga to be sung with a feeling of deep devotion and repose. The very auspicious Raaga Hamsadhwani - is a part of Raga Velavala (to be sung in the morning). [Velavala is Sanskrit. This raga is now known as the 'Bilaval thaat'; it also appears in the Sikh tradition. You can listen to this raga (Raag Alhaiya Bilaval): Link1(Ustad Rashid Khan), Link2(Pt. Bhimsen Joshi), Link3(Kishori Amonkar), Link4(Pt. Jasraj – 1/2) and Link5(Pt. Jasraj – 2/2.]\n\nTherefore: 'wives', 'sons', etc is not to be taken literally.\n\n[We will continue our discussions in the next post...]\n\n(Do stay tuned…)\n\nPicture:An illustration of 'Ravana forcibly carrying off Sita'.

Wodehouse\n\n\"He spoke with a certain what-is-it in his voice, and I could see that, if not actually disgruntled, he was far from being gruntled, so I tactfully changed the subject.\"\n\nWords from Bertie to describe Jeeves' reaction re his lack of enthusiasm about going on a Round-The-World cruise. Needless to say, Jeeves has been trying his bestest to get Bertie to go, even procuring some literature from the Travel Bureau... and attempting to give it to him (instead of the morning paper). I mean: right after Bertie has downed one of Jeeves' miraculous 'Worcester Sauce' and has had the top of his skull fly up to the ceiling and back, and right after he has barely retrieved his eyeballs (after they had shot out of their sockets and rebounded from the opposite wall like racquet balls) and replaced them in position.\n\n\"... if not actually disgruntled, he was far from being gruntled...\"\n\nClassic.\n\nThe Code of the Woosters is a novel by P. G. Wodehouse, first published on 7 October 1938, in the United Kingdom by Herbert Jenkins, London, and in the United States by Doubleday, Doran, New York. It was serialized in The Saturday Evening Post (US) from 16 July to 3 September 1938 and in the London Daily Mailfrom 14 September to 6 October 1938.\n\nThis is my fourth full-length novel (after 'Thank You, Jeeves', 'Right Ho, Jeeves' and 'Joy in theMorning') featuring two of Wodehouse's best-known creations, Bertie Wooster and his gentleman's gentleman - the inimitable Jeeves. ['Carry On, Jeeves' consisted of 10 short stories that made for a delicious hors d'oeuvre.]\n\nActually, it's good that I read 'Right Ho, Jeeves' before venturing into reading this one; 'coz it is a sort of continuation of the Gussie Fink-Nottle and the Madeline Basset saga.\n\nAnd since the 'Code of the Woosters' is to never let a pal down, Bertie always finds himself totally involved.\n\nMaybe: the Woosters have never heard of PayPal. Or probably think that the considerably high-quality Wooster chickens won't come home to roost - ever.\n\nGussie, as you know is Bertie's fish-faced pal and the world's leading authority on newts (and their love life). Here he is conducting an experiment: trying to study the effects of a full moon on newts... and their love life. Apparently: the guy newts wiggle their tails at the gal newts.\n\nMethinks: once Gussie and the proponent of 'stars-are-god's-daisy-chain' (Madeline Basset) are married, they can conduct yet more experiments - together. This time: about the effects of the stars on newts and their love life. They can then spend hours together - gazing lovingly at newts and talking about them.\n\nWhat a match! Made in heaven, no doubt.\n\nHowever, in this novel we encounter a much self-assured and confident Gussie: one who is totally unlike his orange-juice guzzling nervous avatar that we encountered in 'Right Ho, Jeeves'. I mean: the one whose orange-juice had to be spiked with lots of gin for him to be able to make a speech in front of some schoolboys and their guardians. Or for him to be able to tell Madeline what he thinks and feels about her.\n\nThis new-found self-assurance is courtesy Jeeves' priceless advice, which Gussie follows diligently by first thinking up and then noting down the many character failings of people like the sly Sir Watkyn Bassett and the bulldoggish Roderick Spode - in excruciating detail (in a small, leather-bound notebook).\n\nUnfortunately, while extracting a fly out of (Sir Watkyn's young niece) Stephanie 'Stiffy' Byng's eye, he (unwittingly) drops this precious notebook, which firstlands in Stiffy's not-so-safe hands and then finds it's way elsewhere - including lodging itself inside a prized silver 'cow-creamer'.\n\nIncidentally, Madeline sees Gussie extracting that fly (out of Stiffy Byng's eyes) and then catches him again, this time: when he is innocently searching Stiffy's stocking (while they were adorning her legs!) - for that precious notebook. Result: she instantly calls off their wedding (on both occasions), and decides to 'make Bertie happy' instead.\n\nBertie manages to keep his composure and pleads Gussie's cause - in all earnestness.\n\nIn this novel, there are three covert operations: 1. Operation 'pinch the silver cow-creamer' (or else Uncle Tom loses out on a prized collector's item, or worse: Aunt Dahlia (and by extension Bertie) has to let go of that French culinary maestro Anatoleand bid goodbye to his culinary wonders forever.) 2. Operation 'pinch the policeman's helmet' (else Stiffy's wedding plans with Harold 'Stinker' Pinker will come a cropper.) 3. And the most important operation of all: Operation 'to somehow recover a certain leather-covered notebook' (before it falls into the clutches of Sir Watkyn or Roderick Spode.)\n\nAnd as fate would have it, Bertie finds himself to be a part (rather, at the centre) of all the three operations, thanks to his generous spirit, friendly disposition and gallant, chivalrous nature.\n\nIts another matter though that he has to depend on Jeeves' supreme fish-powered intellect - in order to extricate himself from all sorts of tangle(s) including from being scaffolded, lynched, or engaged (by a sudden quirk of fate).\n\nThere is an implied operation too: Bertie's attempts to keep both Madeline and Stiffy at bay and thus safeguard his free-spirited bachelorhood.\n\nBertie has in fact arrived at Totleigh Towers to achieve a couple of tasks: 1.To swiftly patch up the sudden rupture in the engagement of Gussie and Madeline Bassett. [Gussie has sent him urgent summons.] 2. The recovery of the 'cow-creamer' - which is now being zealously guarded by the hulky Roderick Spode besides a local police constable.\n\nHow did Bertie land himself with task # 2?\n\nWell, his (favourite) Aunt Dahlia browbeat him into it. She first sought his help - to dupe an antique dealer into selling an 18th-century 'cow-creamer' - to adorn Uncle Tom's collection. Failing which, he was then asked to show some sleight of hand (and feet) and recover it from right under the nose of Sir Watkyn. [The latter has audaciously duped the good Uncle Tom by employing some underhanded tactics involving lobsters and cold cucumbers; gained possession of the 'cow-creamer' (ahead of Uncle Tom) and then spirited it away to Totleigh Towers. ...And has been diligently guarding it ever since.]\n\nBertie isn't too keen about taking on the 'responsibility' of recovering that cow-creamer though. However, Aunt Dahlia surmounts all of his vehement protestations by being most un-dahlia-like. She dangles the culinary magic that her French Master-chef Anatole conjures up (and to which Bertie is devoted to) as bait - by threatening to sever his standing invitation to her place (for a meal).\n\nThe way to a man's heart is through his stomach. Indeed.\n\nThe major characters: apart from Aunt Dahlia, Uncle Tom, Gussie, Madeline (and of course Bertie and Jeeves), we get to meet: Sir Watkyn Bassett, Roderick Spode, Stephanie 'Stiffy' Byng, the Rev. Harold 'Stinker' Pinker, Sir Watkyn's butler - Butterfield, Constable Eustace Oates, Stiffy's dog - Bartholomew, and the mysterious 'Eulalie'.\n\nThe scenes are set in Totleigh Towers - owned by Sir Watkyn Bassett (who is now engaged to marry Roderick Spode's aunt.) Harold is the local curate (and an old pal of Bertie's.) Roderick Spode is the leader of a fascist organization called the Saviours of Britain. Bartholomew (the dog) causes Bertie to sail onto the top of a chest of drawers - like an eagle, and Jeeves to climb onto to a cupboard - like a swallow. Even something as innocuous as an umbrella makes its presence felt. However, the mere mention of 'Eulalie' thwarts the big-built and intimidating Spode and stops him on his tracks.\n\nAs to: what 'Eulalie' is - do read this delightful book to find out. I won't play the spoiler.\n\nMy twopenceworth: The manner in which Stiffy and Bertie give Sir Watkyn apoplexy and much else - reminds me of the Hrishikesh Mukherjee-directed evergreen classic: 'Golmaal'. There: Utpal Dutt's character, Bhavanishankar, has shades of Sir Watkyn; the irreverent Lakshmanprasad - played by Amol Palekar (in a double role) - displays some Bertie-like hues, while Urmila (essayed by Bindiya Goswami) may fit into the role of a desiStiffy Byng.\n\nDo read this book and then watch the movie - if in doubt.\n\nEven the manner in which Bertie and his Aunt Dahlia first try to thwart Sir Watkyn and Constable Oates' combined attempt to search Bertie's room in their quest to find the elusive police helmet; and then make light of the whole incident (after the butler, Butterfield, arrives with it on a silver platter: having recovered it from the flowerbed right outside Bertie's window) - reminds me of the delightful and much-watched Bangla movie 'Basanto Bilap'.\n\nThis Dinen Gupta-directed 1973 classic stars Soumitra Chattopadhyay and Aparna Sen. The rest of the cast comprises of very competent actors like: Sumitra Mukherjee, Kajol Gupta, Sibani Bose, Kanika Majumdar, Amarnath Mukhopadhyay, Gita De, Tarun Kumar, Shyam Laha, Haridhan Mukherjee, Bankim Ghosh, and Bengal's evergreen trio of fun and laughter: Robi Ghosh, Anup Kumar and Chinmoy Roy.\n\nSoumitro (as the boisterous, slightly impish Shyamsundar Bose) works at a bank. His closest friends are: Robi Ghosh, Anup Kumar (as Lalitaka Lalu) and Chinmoy (as Siddhartha aka Sidhu). There is Aparna (as the feistyAnuradha Singha) and friends (Sumitra, Kajol, Sibani and others.)\n\nDo watch the movie to figure out what I mean. Hint:watch out for the morning after the poster-pasting adventure scene, when some people turn up demanding that their ladder and bucket - be returned forthwith; and the boys (Soumitro, Robi, Anup and Chinmoy) are happily asleep after all the previous night's 'hard work'.\n\n[Both - the ladder and the bucket - was lost the previous night, as a collateral to the poster-pasting adventure, thanks to Anup Kumar's comic zeal: which caused him to trip over the sleeping hostel maid. The latter awoke, created a ruckus and endeavoured to catch him. Everyone, including some neighbours wake up too; in the melee Anup and gang barely manage to escape, leaving the ladder behind. They tackle the hostel guard by dumping the gum-filled bucket over his head.]\n\nMy verdict:The Code of the Woosters runs through 14 chapters and 286 pages. As usual, it makes for a breezy read. There is a lot of interplay between Jeeves and Bertie, so enjoy! [Do try to read Right Ho, Jeeves before this one, that way you will know the background better.]\n\nThe production quality of the book is good, barely any editing errors (one perhaps, if at all).\n\nThe book jacket cover is in a (sort of) parrot green and blue combo. PG Wodehouse appears in a lighter shade of purple, The Code of the Woosters appears in black. The effect is muted and rightly so, 'coz it allows for the figure on the cover (with a torn painting adorning his neck) to grab our attention - instantly. It is the one and only Bertie Wooster - without a shadow of doubt. [Actually: he has had a painting smashed on his head, yet not seeing stars! Bertie is superhuman indeed. :)]\n\nPlus: I thought that Jeeves had politely objected to and then ensured that there were no facial hair on Bertie except for eyebrows and eyelashes. But I see a mustache. [Probably Jeeves was on a longish vacation.]\n\nFrankly: the cover reminded me of Tintinand one of his adventures: where there's a painting of Captain Haddock's look-alike ancestor - Sir Francis Haddock (who lived in the reign of Charles the Second.) It is: 'The Secret of The Unicorn' - I think.\n\nIn his zeal to demonstrate to Tintin and Snowy the swashbuckling exploits of his illustrious ancestor (vis-à-vis the dreaded pirate - Red Rackham) as animatedly as he could, Captain Haddock downs several bottles of rum and with a cutlass in hand proceeds to enact it all. At the end of it, he takes a tumble and proclaims 'victory' (Red Rackham lies dead! With a yo-ho-ho and a bottle of rum !) By then, Sir Francis Haddock's torn portrait has engulfed his happy face.\n\nI really loved reading 'The Code of the Woosters'. Especially because: it gave me an opportunity to venture into Soumitro territory. I am now hoping that at least one of the remaining ones will gift me with an opportunity to write about Gregory Peck too. :)\n\nSanta Claus - are you listening?\n\nBtw, Wodehouse has a fascination for Archimedes and his famous whoop: Eureka. He is also a Charles Dickens fan - with a particular fondness for 'A Tale of Two Cities' (as can be understood from several references to Sidney Carton). Wodehouse is very likely a fan of Tintin and Captain Haddock and by extension, of their Belgian creator: Hergé as well.\n\nHowever: Since Jeeves is a sharp legal-eagle minus the briefcase, I would have been most keen to know his views on Fido Dido Inretail. After all: the big print giveth and the fine print taketh away. And I would have also loved to know his take on the 'inbhestment' climate in Didi's Poschimbongo apart from the sudden SPoon-Elep'hunt' tango to the tune of 'Kejri Re...' :)\n\nOr about the new species of evolved human discovered @ the Gardens of Eden: Dhonicus Cricketus X-Mas Giftus.\n\nDetails of the book:The Code of the Woosters/ Author: P.G.

(Part-XI)\n\nAuthor's Note:Please visit -The 'Real' Ramayana/ Ram-Rajya- to read the other parts of this series, so as to be able to fully understand or grasp the contents of this one.\n\nWhat does 'Shri Ganesh' and the 'Hamsa' represent? Why is Shri Ganesh a 'son' of Shakti? What are: 'Sanaatan Dharma', 'Brhaman', 'Vedic' and the 'Upanishad'? Some thoughts on: the soul, AUM - the sound of primal energy and the \"Dvividha nishtha\" or the 2-fold path.\n\nIn Part-X, we briefly discussed the auspicious Raga Hamsadhwani.\n\nHamsa = a bird. Either the white swan or the bar-headed white goose. The white swan is called Raja-Hamsa, literally: the royal swan.\n\nThe white swan is a 'vaahan' or 'vehicle' of Maa Sarasvati - the goddess (or symbol) of learning, knowledge and wisdom (all of it of a higher plane.)\n\nIt is also associated with Brhma - the name of the cosmic force (or energy) that sustains and supports creation (and stands for Buddhi+ the creative and discretionary energies in humans). [The energy or force that our ancients called \"Brhmaa\" signifies Creation. And this force emerges out of the \"lotus-naval\" of the energy that our ancients called: Vishnu (Vish = poison). Here \"lotus\" is a metaphor. A lotus grows in muddy water, yet remains untouched by it. Brhmaa or Creation emerges out of poison (Vishnu), yet remains untouched by it.]\n\nWithout all that Maa Sarasvati represents or symbolizes, Shrishti or Creation cannot be sustained.\n\nMaa Sarasvati is referred to as a 'daughter' of Shiv and Parvati (Durga). Essentially to mean: that strength and power(i.e. Shakti and Shiv) must be paired with (or come along with) knowledge and wisdom (i.e. Sarasvati) - for it to work well.\n\nEven Maa Lakshmi (the 'goddess' or symbol of wealth, prosperity, wisdom and plenty) is considered as a 'daughter' of Shiv and Parvati (Durga).\n\n[Through Maa Sarasvati and MaaLakshmi - we can 'see' positive and auspicious qualities or aspects, like: wisdom, knowledge, etc. Incidentally: Lakmé is the French pronunciation for 'Lakshmi'.]\n\nShri Ganesh is also considered as a 'son' of Shiv and Parvati (Durga).\n\nShri Ganesh represents: great retention power or vast intelligence (as symbolized by the elephant head and elephant's memory). The big head = thinking big.\n\nThe elephant-head: represents calm disposition, intelligence, perceptiveness, knowledge and wisdom. [The light of wisdom = Surya-Kotti Samaprabha; as radiant as a million Suns.]\n\nThe small eyes = concentration.\n\nThe small mouth and the bent trunk (Vakra-Tunndda) = less noise and more efficiency[as in: \"empty vessels makes the most noise\"]. The bent trunk is an allusion to or indicates: one who is not given to boasting or talking unnecessarily, or in other words: one who is not ignorant.\n\nThe big elephant ears = great listening ability. [Remember: it is 'listening' and not merely 'hearing'.]\n\nThe single tusk = retaining the good and discarding the rest. Also: non-extravagant. [In a way: Paramahamsa.]\n\nThe big body (Maha-Kaaya) = immense strength: to stop all obstacles or negativeness - in the path of good deeds or actions.\n\nThe large stomach = not constricted; digests or accepts everything (all that life has to offer) without being affected.\n\nThe swift mooshika-vahana(the 'mooshika' or the mouse as 'vehicle') - represents: swiftness(obviously), but a mooshika finds its way through all kinds of terrains and tears down all sorts of obstacles (vighn) - with its sharp teeth. And since Shri Ganesh rides it (the mooshika being his 'vaahan' or vehicle) - the latter remains under control and cannot take Shri Ganesh (or all that he represents) for a ride. That is: lack of negative greed or desire.\n\nThe parasu or axe = to strike down all obstacles in the path of good deeds.\n\nThe rope + lotus = to pull you closer to the goal + to pull you away from negative aspects, thinking, etc. [A lotus: grows in muddy water yet remains untouched by it.]\n\nThe palm in abhaya mudra = blessings + reassurance.\n\nThe tasty Modakas = the rewards of one's single-minded efforts [Karm Yog.]\n\nAll that Shri Ganesh symbolizes can achieve any goal or purpose together: Nirvighnam Kuru Me Deva Sarva-Kaaryessu Sarvadaa. [When one prays to Shri Ganesh, one is essentially praying to be bestowed with all these qualities so as to be able to surmount all odds and complete a good deed or task successfully - always (Sarvadaa). Hence, Shri Ganesh is worshiped before the commencement of any auspicious task.]\n\nOur ancients chose the symbol of an elephant-head since the elephant is associated with intelligence, wisdom, great retention capacity and strength. Also: a herd of elephants know or rather can judge from where or which part of a swift stream it was safe to cross - without getting carried away by the water currents. In earlier times, engineers preferred to wait and watch the elephants cross - in order to figure out the safest spot - rather than depend on their instruments, calculations or judgement.\n\n\"Durga\" or \"Shakti\" represents \"strength\". Only through this (i.e. strength or effort) can one acquire (i.e. create) knowledge, wisdom, prosperity, etc... and all of these (qualities) together can overcome all kinds of obstacles. These (qualities represented by Shri Ganesh, Maa Sarasvati and MaaLakshmi) in turn enrich \"Shakti\" (i.e. strength or effort). They complement each other. Whenever they are utilized together, none of it is mis-used or mis-directed.\n\nTherefore: Shri Ganesh, Maa Saraswati and Maa Lakshmi are also worshiped during Durga Puja or Dussehra and during Deepavali as well (besides during several other occasions of course.)\n\nSo: though Shri Ganesh is not a person, yet... He is a 'son' of Shiv and Shakti (Durga).\n\nShri Ganesh represents or 'manifests' positive or noble traits (since these cannot be seen with mortal eyes and possess no form). One way of 'seeing' them is through (the idol of) Shri Ganesh, and it is advised that one must endeavour to achieve these positive traits too. Positive or noble traits (or qualities) are worthy of reverence (i.e. worship). [The same principle is applicable to Maa Lakshmi, Maa Sarasvati, et al.]\n\nOpposite traits or qualities (to the ones mentioned above) such as: ignorance, half-baked knowledge, boastfulness, lack of perspective, vanity, an illusion of knowledge or a lack of intelligence, et al are negative traits or qualities. It is advised that one endeavours to let go of them - at the earliest. [And needless to say, these negative traits are not worthy of worship either.]\n\nThere are many symbolism, metaphors and imagery that are a part-and-parcel of the 'Sanaatan Dharma' or the timeless 'way of life'. [Sanaatan = timeless. Dharma = way of life.]\n\nShri Ganesh and Hisbeing a 'son' is just one of them. Shri Ganesh is also 'Vighn Vinashak' or the 'remover of all obstacles' - that may appear in the path of any good deed or purpose.\n\nIn other words: by incorporating all that Shri Ganesh (as well as Maa Lakshmi or MaaSaraswati) represents or symbolizes, we can overcome all kinds of obstacles and odds - in the path of any good deed or action. [Nirvighnam Kuru Me Deva Sarva-Kaaryessu Sarvadaa.]\n\nRemember: whatever Shri Ganesh, Maa Saraswati and Maa Lakshmi represents are a 'part' of Maa \"Shakti\". 'Coz only through \"Shakti\" (i.e. through strength or effort) can one acquire (i.e. create) knowledge, wisdom, prosperity, etc... and all of these (qualities) together can overcome all kinds of obstacles. And it is precisely for this reason that it is euphemistically said that: MaaShakti (Durga) 'created' them.\n\nHence: Shri Ganesh, MaaSaraswati and Maa Lakshmi are also symbolically referred to as Her'son' or 'daughter'.\n\n[Shri = honorific. Maa = Mother.]\n\nLets return to the 'Hamsa'.\n\nThe Hamsa is an important element in the symbology found in this ancient Vedic faith - the Sanatan Dharm - and represents: wisdom and beauty.\n\nThe Hamsarepresents perfect union, balance and life. A constant repetition of the word \"hamso\" changes it to \"Soaham\", which means: \"That I am\" or \"I am He\". Hence, the hamsa is often identified with the (unseen and formless) Supreme Spirit (also known as: the Paramaatma or the Parameshwar; the Ultimate Truth, the Ultimate Realityor the Ultimate Knowledge).\n\nOr in other words: the Brhman. [It is not a reference to any group, community or people in any way whatsoever. But another name for the unseen and formless energies of the cosmos: the Supreme Spirit or the Supreme Being; also known as the Paramaatma or the Parameshwar; the Ultimate Truth, the Ultimate Reality or the Ultimate Knowledge. The Brhaman is the source of everything, the cause. The Vedanta is all about searching out the cause. The cause is Brhaman.]\n\nHam-sa when inverted reads as sa-ham, which in Sanskrit means: 'the oneness of the human and the divine'.\n\n[Our soul or the aatmanis a part of the divine (i.e. our aatman is a part of the formless forces or the energies of the cosmos). The Sanskrit words most closely corresponding to soul are \"Jiva/Atma\", meaning the individual soul or personality, and \"Atman\", which can also mean soul. The Atmanis seen as a portion of the Brahman (the Supreme Being or the Supreme Soul - the source of everything, the cause).\n\nWhat is today known as Hinduism contains many variant beliefs on the origin, the purpose, and the fate of the soul. For example, advaita (monism) or non-dualistic conception of the soul accords it union with the Brahman, the absolute uncreated (the cause; the Supreme Being or the Supreme Spirit), in eventuality or in pre-existing fact. Dvaita or dualistic concepts differ from this, instead identifying the soul as a part and parcel of the Supreme Soul (the Brhaman), but that it never loses its identity. This is where we as an individual get an identity. According to our ancient texts, this identity exists eternally; the soul neverdies. It only transmigrates from one body to another body. And therefore Karm Yog is important. 'Karma' or 'Karm Yog' is not punishment, but an opportunity to redeem oneself. Shri Krishna talked about Dvaita.]\n\n[Note: This is what Shri Krishna said about the aatman:\n\n'Na jãyate mriyate vã kadãchinnãyam bhootvã bhavitã vã na bhooyaha,\n\najo nityaha shãshvato'yam purãno na hanyate hanyamãne shareere.'\n\nTranslated: 'the aatma is never born nor does it die. Similarly, it is not re-created to come into existence. Since, the aatma is not born, is eternal and imperishable, it has existed since time eternal and does not die even though the body dies.' - the Srimad Bhagavad Gita: Chapter 2 Verse - 20.\n\nAs Arjuna stood in the battlefield of Kurukshetra, he was overcome with feelings of weakness and confusion - since he faced the prospect of killing his own kith and kin. Shri Krishna, who was his charioteer in the battlefield, sought to allay his fears by teaching him about the distinction between the physical body (which is impermanent) and the soul oraatman(which is permanent):\n\n'vāsānsi jīrNāni yathā vihāya navāni grihNāti naro.aparāNi.\n\ntathā śarīrāNi vihāya jīrNānyanyāni sanyāti navāni dehī.'\n\nTranslated:\"Just as a human being puts on new garments, casting off old and worn-out ones, the soul similarly takes up residence within new material bodies, giving up the old and infirm ones.\" - the Srimad Bhagavad Gita: Chapter 2 Verse - 22.\n\nHe also said:\n\n'nainaṃ chindanti śastrāṇi nainaṃ dahati pāvakaḥ\n\nna cainaṃ kledayantyāpo na śoṣayati mārutaḥ'\n\nTranslated: I am the spirit/soul... the atman: any weapon, elements of life or any danger cannot destroy me. I am eternal... energetic.\n\nSri Krishna describes (to Arjuna) the human soul as something that cannot be cut by weapons, cannot be burnt by fire, cannot be drowned in water, cannot be blown by the wind.\n\nWeapons cleave It not, fire burns It not, water wets It not, wind dries It not. This self cannot be cut, not burnt, nor get wet, nor dried up. It is eternal, all-pervading, stable, immovable and ancient. This [self] is said to be un-manifested, unthinkable and unchangeable. Therefore, knowing This to be such you should not grieve - the Srimad Bhagavad Gita: Chapter 2 Verse - 23.]\n\nDuring pranayama, which is a yogic exercise of breath control, the inhalation is believed to sound like \"ham\", while the exhalation is believed to sound like \"sa\". Thus, a hamsa came to epitomize the prana, the breath of life.\n\nMantras were not devised by the ancient seers or the ancient sages (learned persons, like Rishis, Munis, etc) but were 'revealed' to them by (i.e. were derived from) nature, creation and the universe or the cosmos.\n\nAjapa (A + Japa = No + Chant) is the primal Mantra.\n\nThis chantless Mantra pervades the breath going in and out, the subtle sound 'sah' going in and the subtle sound 'ham' going out. (Sa = Siva, Vishnu, Lakshmi, or Gauri [Parvati or Sakti]; Ham = I am; so = Parvati.) As one chants this subtle-sound Mantra 'soham', a derivative of 'sah-ham', 'Hamsa' comes into being by inversion. Soham, Hamsa and AUM (Pranava) are equipotent.\n\n[OM or AUM is the sound of primal energy, the sound of the universe itself. Space in Sanskrit is 'Vyoma', and this too contains the sacred sound of primal energy: OM or AUM. It is very likely that the Universe (Brhmaand) is shaped like a conch (shankh), and that is why the sound of primal energy or the sound of the universe is: OM or AUM. This sound does not require any external stimuli whatsoever: it is Anahith Nadh.]\n\nSoham is the unintonated sound of normal breathing, meaning: 'I am He.' [\"aham\" + \"sa\"]\n\n[The awareness that one is inseparable from or is a part of the divine i.e. a part of the Brhaman or the unseen energies of the cosmos - exists only in enlightened persons.]\n\nHamsa, meaning 'Swan' as in RamaKrishna Parama-Hamsa, stands for an ascetic - Hamsan.\n\nThe Hamsa is seen as a symbol of purity, detachment, divine knowledge, cosmic breath (prana) and the highest spiritual accomplishment. It is supposed to transcend the limitations of creation - for it can walk on the earth, fly in the sky (air) and swim in the water. Just as the swan or hamsa lives on water but its feathers do not get damp, similarly a Hamsan (or an ascetic) tries to live in this material world full of Maaya, yet remains detached and is not impacted by its transient and illusionary nature.\n\nThe hamsa is supposed to possess the ability to separate the water from the cream (in milk). The hamsa's ability to separate milk and water symbolizes the need to discriminate between good and bad and the eternal and evanescent.\n\nAny learned or knowledgeable person(s) that have been able to only imbibe the good or the positive aspects of his or her learning or knowledge (i.e. has been able to understand the true essence of knowledge and learning) is known as: 'Paramahamsa'.\n\n[Sri Ramakrishna Paramahamsadev is a shining example. This great man was the 'guru' i.e. teacher and guide to the great Swami Vivekananda.]\n\nShri Krishna too has been compared to the 'Hamsa' and to the magnificent peacock. [Ram and Krishna are one and the same: as Ramakrishna.]\n\nShri Krishna is a Hamsan or 'ascetic' in the sense that whatever he did was not for any personal motives or gains. His was selfless service (Nishkam Karm) for the greater good (Loka-sangraha or Loka Kalyana.) And so were the deeds of Siya-Ram, Kaikeyi, Manthara, Lakshman, Hanumanji, et al.\n\n[However, being a 'Hamsan' or 'ascetic' - due to their selfless service towards society and towards humanity - does not make either Ram or Krishna 'celibate'.]\n\nThis over-glorification (or even glorification) of 'celibacy' is not part of our ancient culture, but a result of later misunderstandings and mistranslations (including by aliens).\n\nOne cannot renounce (tyag) anything unless and until one has experienced it (bhog).\n\nThis ancient Vedic faith - the 'Sanaatan Dharma' - has space for both: the activeand the renouncer.\n\nThe verse \"gnanayogena saankhyaanaam, karmayogena yoginaam\" comes before \" karmaNi eva adhikaaraste maa phaleshu kadaachana, maa karma phala hetuH bhuH maa sanghaH astu akarmaNi \" in the Srimad Bhagavat Gita (which is universally renowned as the jewel of India's spiritual wisdom.)\n\n\"gnanayogena saankhyaanaam, karmayogena yoginaam\"\n\nMeans: \"People who already have a meditative bent of mind can take up renunciation, while the rest of the folks (including Arjun) who are yet to have that mindset are better off taking to an active lifestyle.\"\n\nShri Krishna’s \"Dvividha nishtha\" or the 2-fold path is not exclusive of his doctrine of \"Karm Yog\" - the art and science of achieving perfection in action.\n\nPeople who already have a meditative bent of mind can take up renunciation - that is their path.\n\nWhile the rest of the folks (including Arjun) who are yet to have that mindset are better off taking to an active lifestyle - that is their path.\n\nThis ancient Vedic faith or the 'Sanaatan Dharma' - was neverenvisaged as a 'religion', simply because: the word 'religion' or its connotations were unknown to our ancients. Therefore: there is no 'religion' or 'ism' associated with \"puja\" or \"homa\" or \"chantings\" or \"mantras\" or \"prasad\" or for that matter: withanythingpertaining to this ancient and timeless 'way of life'.\n\nYes, 'Sanaatan Dharm' is a 'way of life'. [Sanaatan = ancient or timeless, Dharm = path or way of life.]\n\nIt is essentially an accumulation and reflection of the wisdom and illumined knowledge (jnana) - that our ancients (men and women) derived or gathered from nature and from creation. There is no \"founder\". 'Sanaatan Dharm' was never a cult movement or any movement for that matter, to unite people under a single \"founder\", simply because there has never been a \"founder\". 'Sanaatan Dharm' was nevermeant to be a 'religion' or 'ism'; it is essentially a blend of wisdom, illumined knowledge and Vigjnana - that can be acquired only when one open's his or her mind's eye (i.e. one's manas-chokhshu).\n\nThis ancient Vedic faith is a 'way of life' and the stress is on 'dharm', meaning: 'to do one's duty whatever the obstacles in one's path'. [Dharmalso meant: endeavouring to follow the right principles whatever the situation one may be confronted with.]\n\nVedic = from the Veda. 'Veda' comes from the Sanskrit root 'Vid' which means: 'to know' and this in turn has given rise to 'Vidya' or knowledge. So, 'Sanaatan Vedic Dharma' is the treasure-trove of timeless knowledge - which OUR ancients gathered or learnt from nature (Prakriti), universe (Brhmaand) and space (Vyoma) - and then accumulated within the four Vedas and its other tributaries like the Upanishads, the Purans and so on. Hence: this timeless knowledge isessentially a 'way of life'.\n\nUnfortunately: today 'dharm' or 'dharma' is automatically taken to mean 'religion' or 'ism'. And 'Sanaatan Dharma' has turned into 'Hindu-ism'...! [Thanks to 'knowledgeable' aliens and their spiritual disciples.]\n\nYet: 'Dharm' for our ancients did not mean 'religion'. It was given the colour of religion by later day (mis)interpreters and alien translators who either misunderstood the words/phrases or did not have adequate phonetics/words/vocabulary in their language. Or maybe: willfully misinterpreted it.\n\nThe word 'religion' never existed in this ancient Vedic faith: the \"Sanaatan Dharm\". It was never a cult movement or any movement for that matter, to unite people under a single \"founder\", simply because there has neverbeen a \"founder\". So, when 'knowledgeable' people write about or lecture us on secularism, it is a futile activity. They only end up displaying their gigantic ignorance 'knowledge'. Sanatan Dharma was never a 'religion' or 'ism'; and hence, Sanaatan-Dharmis or Sanaatan-hearts do not understand this peculiar concept of 'religion' or 'ism', nor do they view things through such a prism.\n\n[Note:The term Upanishad is derived from upa (near), ni (down) and sad (to sit), i.e., sitting down near a spiritual teacher (guru) in order to receive instruction in the Guru-shishya tradition. Upanishad also means 'setting at rest ignorance by revealing the knowledge of the supreme spirit...'\n\nA gloss of the term Upanishadbased on Shankara's commentary on the Katha and Brihadāranyaka Upanishads equates it with Ātmavidyā, that is: \"knowledge of the Self,\" or Brahmavidyā i.e. \"knowledge of Brhama.\" Shankara derived the word from the root \"sad\" (to destroy, to loosen, to reach) with Upa and ni as prefixes and kvip as termination and equated it's meaning with the destruction of ignorance. Therefore, Upanishad means Brhama-knowledge by which ignorance is loosened or destroyed. The treatises that deal with Brhama-knowledge are called the Upanishads and so, pass for the Vedanta. The different derivations together make out that the Upanishads give us both spiritual vision and philosophical argument. In the Upanishads the spiritual meanings of the Vedic texts are brought out and emphasized in their own right. [However: given the passage of time and the seepage of various 'impurities' as well as mistranslations, it is up to us to separate the grain from the chaff, so to speak.]\n\nThe authorship of the Upanishads is unknown, but some of their chief doctrines are associated with the names of particular sages such as: Aruni, Yajnavalkya, Bâlâki, Svetaketu, and Sândilya. The Upanishads belong to the class of sruti, or 'revealed literature', uttered by the learned sages in the fullness of an illumined understanding of the truth (Brhaman). According to tradition, there were over two hundred Upanishads, but the philosopher and commentator Shankara (who lived sometime between 509 and 820 C.E.) only composed commentaries to eleven of them, generally regarded as the oldest ones. The Muktika Upanishad lists 108 Upanishads. According to Panini's Ashtadhyayi (also known as: Panineeyam), the total number of Upanishads was 900. Patanjali too puts the number at 900. Hence: it appears that most of them are lost forever.\n\nUnfortunately: the demise of several languages and ancient groups (clans or tribes), as well as the systematic conversion of indigenous people, the adivashis or vaanvashis (tribal) - all over the world, to some or the other organized 'ism' - has had devastating effects vis-à-vis written and oral history, heritage, art, crafts, knowledge, ancient texts, languages, culture and folklore. We simply have no idea of what has been lost - forever.\n\nIf we are to reclaim some of our lost glory - it is important that we revert to 'Sanaatan Dharm' instead of persisting with 'Hinduism' and cleanse all the unwanted aspects that have seeped in or crept in over time (the kind that great humans like Krishna, Ram, Sita et al successfully fought against.)\n\n[We will continue our discussions in the next post...]\n\n(Do stay tuned…)\n\nPicture:The majestic white swan, Shri Ganesh and Sri Ramakrishna Paramahamsadev.\n\n↧\n\n↧\n\nReclaiming our History | Decoding the Ramayana: The *real* Shri Ram: Whether he was a \"bad husband\" and what is 'Ram-Rajya'?

[Do read Part-XI– to get the drift.]\n\n'Sanaatan Dharm' isall about 'Karm Yog'. It is about the art and science of achieving perfection in action. It is about doing one's work with pride and doing it well (with full responsibility). It is about doing one's duty (towards society and towards humanity), no matter what the odds.\n\nBhagavan Shri Krishna's immortal words from the Srimad Bhagavad-Gita [Chapter 2 Verse - 47]:\n\n|| karmaNi eva adhikaaraste maa phaleshu kadaachana,\n\nmaa karma phala hetuH bhuH maa sanghaH astu akarmaNi ||\n\nMeaning: \"Thy business is with the action only, never with its fruits; so let not the fruits of action be thy motive, nor be thou to inaction attached.\"\n\nKrishna - the handsome King of Dvarka (Dvaravati) and a fountainhead of knowledge and wisdom advises us: that in anysituation, we must make a conscious decision and do our best to uphold it - despite the odds. Remaining inactive or being a fence-sitter is notan option. Also: one must not worry about the result, outcome or the consequences of one's action or decision - since that is not in our hands. Our focus should be on doing our duty and doing it to the best of our ability.\n\nHe also says that: everything happens due to our action only (including: misguided actions and lack ofaction.) Hence: we must not blame any external factors for whatever situation we find ourselves in. Everything happens due to our action only (and that includes the consequences of our misg"
