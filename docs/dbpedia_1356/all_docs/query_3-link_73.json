The occupied position during the sleep can affect the healthy functioning of our bodies, especially if you consider the fact that 95 percent of us sleep every night in the same position. • Sleeping on your back This is the most common way of sleep, and studies have shown that carries affordable health care use. This position gives the organs more space. It is considered that the effect is even greater if the knees are slightly bent and raised, thereby reducing pressure on ankles. In this way the blood circulates through the body more easily. For those who snore during sleep this position is the happiest combination. Also this position is not recommended for pregnant women because of the way that comes to reduction of blood circulation in the placenta. Sleeping on the side According to many people the most comfortable posture during sleep. The spine is in a perfect position and has good support. This position is also known as the fetal position. But here are a few recommended items that should be preserved. There is a need to have a higher pillow and to sleep on the right side of the body because the heart should work easier. For some individuals this situation leads to problems with proper breathing and partial closure of the airway. The reason is that gravity forces the tongue to come in contact with the gums and thus leads to partially closing the airway, and this happens if the person is using the mouth breathing while sleeping. • Sleeping on your stomach This position is considered as the worst position to sleep. Apart from the neck there is created pressure on other internal organs. When you sleep on your back it comes to reducing breathing. If you sleep on your stomach, your face is “crowded” on the pillow and it increases the likelihood of occurrence of wrinkles. If you sleep on your stomach and you cannot let it go try sleeping without a pillow, to reduce the negative effect of this sleep position.

Engagements 2/5/2015, Bangalore, India: Punyakoti is a collection of firsts for the global animation industry and Indian animation industry. It is the first Sanskrit animation film the world is ever going to see, it is the first crowd sourced animation film being created in India, together, it marks a huge milestone worldwide. Infosys’ HR professional, Ravi Shankar, discovered Sanskrit very late in his life. The language drew him to the 5000 years of collective wisdom our ancestors left for us and future generations. Ravi also writes books for children, his story adaptation of ‘Punyakoti’ was published in Sanskrit – that’s when he realized, in a time and age where current generations were leaving Sanskrit behind, it was time to make Sanskrit more accessible, young and relevant. Ravi’s script is inspired by 'Punyakoti' a Kannada folk song that narrates the story of a confrontation between a cow and a tiger, Punyakoti explores the growing issue of man- animal conflicts. The film is comprised of 31 scenes, the project is open to independent animators, animation studios and schools to pick up a scene and contribute. Punyakoti has also roped in the legendary composer Sir Illairyaraja, Ravi says, “When I wrote PunyakotiI narrated the story to him, he liked it, blessed me and agreed to make the music.”Ravi adds, “Punyakoti is our story. The message of living a life of honesty and living in harmony in nature is universal. It needs to be collectively owned and told by all of us.” Punyakoti has launched it’scrowd fundingcampaign on 1st June 2015 on Wishberry – they are looking to raise Rs.40 Lakhs (around $62,800) in 60 days. Although they went live just a day ago, they have already attracted high profile supporters, Manoj Kannoth, (National award winning director),Anvar Ali (award winning poet and writer), Dr RN Nagaraj (a noted Sanskrit scholar) MD Pai (former CFO of Infosys), Swaminathan Dandapani (chairman of Manipal Hospitals) and Dr.AmeetaJadav (Dean of the Art Institute of Atlanta) The film will be completed in 2016, provided they reach their crowdfuding target.

While most children were spending their vacations playing video games or learning new skills, this group of children from the Chetinad Township near kovilambakam used their time to set up a food stall in their area, with delicious items prepared by the residents. The sale proceeds were later donated to the nearby orphanage in the form of Rice bags and necessary groceries. 'This interaction with the orphans has helped them to become more socially responsible citizens', said the parents. To make this a sustained and continuous monthly process, this group which calls itself The Chetinad Children’s Committee, has recently joined hands with FACES- SHARE TO CARE Movement started by Mrs.Lellapalli Sridevi (Rex Karmaveer Gold medal winner- United Nations).Mrs. Sridevi connects s c h o o l / c o l l e g e children to the nearby orphanages and makes the communities to support and adopt orphanages through F A C E S ( F o o d , Aid, Clothing, Education, Shelter).
