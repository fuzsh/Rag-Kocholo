        "meta_description": "Marma: Directed by Sunil Kumar Desai. With Anand, Kishori Ballal, Hemashree, Master Hirannayya. Recently engaged to Anand, tall and attractive Sudha, heads out to his farmhouse near Pune for a celebration, and goes missing for about 3 days. She contacts them, seriously injured, from a hospital bed, they bring her home, and she informs them of getting lost, ending up in a wooden house, where she saw the lifeless of a woman, and a crazed killer, who attacked and wounder her, and for proof she shows them a button that she managed to snatch from the killer's jean jacket. Anand accompanies her to the location, but they are unable to locate the house. Then the entire family's life is turned upside down when Sudha claims that she has been sexually molested by the very same killer. They install alarms, hire a watchman, and virtually fortify the house. Despite of this Sudha claims that she is being watched, and the killer enters the house at will. Their attempts to cure her with the assistance of a Tantrik is of no avail, and she refuses to co-operate with Dr. Rao, a Psychiatrist, leaving the question open whether she has a mental illness or the killer is an entity from another unknown dimension.",
