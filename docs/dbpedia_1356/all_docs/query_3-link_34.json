The series is presumably named after the mantra Aum Namah Shivaya.\n\nPlot\n\n[edit]\n\nThe plot centers around Lord Shiva and brings Hindu theology to life in a series of interconnected stories. The serial begins with the creation of the universe and the other Devas, then guides the viewer through Shiva's marriage to Sati, Sati's death, Shiva's marriage to Parvati, and tales of many devotional acts, demonic battles, and important religious events (such as the creation of the twelve Jyotirlinga). It ends with events covered in the Mahābhārata and the blessing of the hero Arjuna by Shiva.\n\nAccording to the show's introduce the material used to construct the show's plot and the script was extensive. Sources listed are the Vayu Puran, Shiv Maha Puran, Skand Puran, Ling Puran, Tantra Chooramani, Valmiki Ramayan, Swetashwar Upanishad, Vaman Puran, Varah Puran, Koorma Puran, Rudra Yamal Tantra, Padma Puran, Devi Bhagwat Puran, and Bhagwat Puran. Director Dheeraj Kumar, a devotee of Lord Shiva, oversaw nine years of research to ensure that Om Namah Shivay's story was complete and accurate;[3] nonetheless, the opening credits begin with an apology for any errors that may have been made in the series.\n\nCast\n\n[edit]\n\nSamar Jai Singh as Bhagwan Bholenath Shivashankar\n\nYashodhan Rana as Bhagwan Bholenath Shivashankar Kamadeva | Kaamdev\n\nGayatri Shastry as Shaktiswaroopa Devi Parvati & other forms of Shakti\n\nManjeet Kullar as Shaktiswaroopa Devi Sati\n\nPriyanka Putran as Devi Kaushiki\n\nJagesh Mukati as Agra Puja Ke Gauriputra Vignaharta Mangalmurti Shree Ganesh\n\nSaurabh Agarwal as Devsenapati Kumar Skand Kartikeya\n\nRajeshwari Sachdev as Kamdevpatni Devi Rati\n\nAmit Pachori as Srishti Ke Palanhar Jagatpalak Jagdishwar Bhagwan Shree Hari Vishnu\n\nAnita Kulkarni/Reena Kapoor as Vishnupriya Devi Lakshmi\n\nSunil Nagar as Shristi Ke Rachnakar Parampita Brahmadeva\n\nMona Parekh as Veenavadini Devi Saraswati\n\nSandeep Mehta as Devrishi Narad\n\nKishori Shahane Vij as Rajkumari Sumati / Devi Sandhya]] / Devi Chhaya\n\nSameer Dharmadhikari as Prithvi Samrath Manuputra Raja Priyavrata\n\nRoma Bali as Dakshaputri Rohini / Barhismati\n\nJyoti Joshi as Buddhpatni Ila / Ila / Suryaputri Tapti\n\nSandeep Mohan as Rama / Maharaj Vajrasena\n\nSiraj Mustafa Khan as Dwarakadheesh Bhagwan Shree Krishna\n\nSanjay Swaraj as Swargaadipati Devraj Indra\n\nShailey Chowdhary as Indrani Devi Shachi\n\nFirdaus Mevawala as Devguru Brihaspati\n\nBhakti Narula as Gurumata Tara\n\nSantosh Kumar Shukla as Chandradeva\n\nDharmendra Rana as Varundeva\n\nGautam Chaturvedi as Rajkumar Bhadrayu / Samrat Yudhishthira / Vasu\n\nShalini Kapoor Sagar as Rajkumari Karkati, wife of Kumbhakarna\n\nChand Dhar as Shukracharya\n\nGajendra Chauhan as Daksha / Kartriveerya (Sahasrabahu)\n\nKshama Raj as Prithvi Maharani Devi Veerni/ Devshilpi Patni Ghritachi\n\nVirendra Razdan as Devshilpi Bhagwan Vishwakarma\n\nNimai Bali as Jalandhara / Suryaputra Shanidev/ Duryodhana / Sindoorasura\n\nRajesh Shringarpore as Arjuna\n\nGufi Paintal as Mama Shakuni\n\nSarvadaman D.

Sharang Dev composed music and Abhilash provided lyrics.[4]\n\nUnity is created in the series by using the same songs for different scenes, or even the same melodies with different lyrics, to soundtrack a recurring theme or situation. For example, the creation of each Jyotirling is accompanied by a chorus of the song \"Ajar Amar Shiv Shankar.\" \"Dharm Na Janu,\" sung by the boy Upmanyyu in episode 58, later becomes the melody for the song \"Jeevan Kya Hai,\" which the young Markandeya sings in episode 168; each child sings to seek Shiva's protection through prayer. Indra, Narada, and the Devatas sing \"Om Shri Tripund Dhari\" to ask rescue from Shiva in episode 56; Sachi then sings the same melody as a prayer to Shakti, \"Jai Shakti Dayini Maa,\" in episode 100.\n\nContinuity is also created between different performers with music. For instance, the song \"Maha Shivratri Aayi\" is sung by Shiva's first wife Sati, and then by his second wife Parvati, both celebrating the great festival of Maha Shivaratri.\n\nHome video\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 2003, Om Namah Shivay was released as a two-part, 42-DVD set, distributed by Madhu Entertainment and Media. It includes an option for English subtitles and a choice of four languages for audio (Hindi, Tamil, Telugu, and Malayalam).[5]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
