Language

French and Arabic are the official languages of Comoros, but locals also speak Comorian or Shikomor. Comorian may sound like Swahili, but it has Bantu origins. Inhabitants of each island have their own dialect and slang.

Currency

The official currency of the Comoros is the Comoros franc (KMF), which is equivalent to 100 centimes. Notes come in denominations of KMF 10,000, 5,000, 2,500, 1,000, and 500. Credit cards are not widely accepted, but some hotels will take them. Restaurants and hotels also accept foreign currency, but to be safe, bring only euro and US dollars. There are ATMs in Moroni, but they are unreliable, so it is best to carry sufficient cash or traveler’s checks.
