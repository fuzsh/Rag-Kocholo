        "text": "The Comoros Islands are situated in the Indian Ocean off the south-eastern coast of Africa. Comoros comprises three islands: Ngazidja, Mohéli, and Anjouan. The descendants of Arab traders, Malay immigrants and Africans contribute to the islands’ complex ethnic mix. The Comoros are densely populated with a population of 773,000 in a total area of 1,862 sq km. Islam is the major religion and three languages are spoken here: Arabic, French, Comoran. The Comoros were ranked 159/188 on the U.N.’s Human Development Index in 2015. They need to focus on combating hunger and malnutrition. Furthermore, infant mortality is relatively high, with a rate of 36 per 1,000. The maternal mortality rate is 172 per 100,000 births.\n\nSOFIA assisted the small hospital of the Catholic Mission at Moroni (Comoros Islands) with the provision of a solar electric system, which guarantees reliable and green energy. The running of a health center is the only official way to serve the predominantly Comorian people. The installation of the solar system has resulted in a huge saving on operational expenses and contributed to the health center’s sustainable development.\n\nStatus: Completed"
