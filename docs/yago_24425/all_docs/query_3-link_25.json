        "text": "The Comoros, officially the Union of the Comoros, is an independent country made up of three islands in southeastern Africa, located at the northern end of the Mozambique Channel in the Indian Ocean. Its capital and largest city is Moroni. The religion of the majority of the population, and the official state religion, is Sunni Islam. As a member of the Arab League, it is the only country in the Arab world which is entirely in the Southern Hemisphere. Comoros proclaimed their independence on July 6, 1975. It is also a member state of the African Union, the Organisation internationale de la Francophonie, the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, and the Indian Ocean Commission. The country has three official languages: Shikomori, French and Arabic. The sovereign state consists of three major islands and numerous smaller islands, all in the volcanic Comoro Islands with the notable exception of Mayotte. Mayotte voted against independence from France in a referendum in 1974, and has since then never been administered by an independent Comoros government, and continues to be administered by France as an overseas department. France has vetoed United Nations Security Council resolutions that would affirm Comorian sovereignty over the island. Mayotte became an overseas department and a region of France in 2011 following a referendum which was passed overwhelmingly.\n\nComoros is officially referred to as the Union of Comoros and it is an independent archipelago island country in the Indian Ocean situated at the northern end of the Mozambique Channel. It is located off Africa’s eastern coast between northeastern Mozambique and northwestern Madagascar. Neighboring countries to Comoros are Seychelles to the northeast and Tanzania to the northwest. The country’s capital city is Moroni, located in Grande Comore. The country’s official languages are French, Arabic, and Comorian, and Islam is the main religion. Comoros has diverse culture from its religion, food, fashion, music and even architecture. All these aspects of culture portray a mixture of diverse cultures that were brought into the country by French, Portuguese, and Arab traders.\n\nComoros may have been inhabited by people of Malayo-Polynesian descent by the 5th or 6th century CE and possibly earlier. Others came from nearby Africa and Madagascar, and Arabs also made up a significant portion of the early population. The islands did not appear on a European world map until 1527, when they were depicted by the Portuguese cartographer Diego Ribero. The first Europeans known to visit the archipelago, somewhat later in the 16th century, appear to have been Portuguese. The Englishman Sir James Lancaster visited Grande Comore about 1591, but the dominant foreign influence in the islands remained Arabian until the 19th century. In 1843 France officially took possession of Mayotte, and in 1886 it placed the other three islands under its protection. Administratively attached to Madagascar in 1912, Comoros became an overseas territory of France in 1947 and was given representation in the French National Assembly. In 1961, a year after Madagascar became independent, the islands were granted internal autonomy. Majorities on three of the islands voted for independence in 1974, but most of the inhabitants of Mayotte favoured continuing French rule. When the National Assembly of France held that each island should decide its own status, Comorian President Ahmed Abdallah (who was deposed later that year) declared the whole archipelago independent on July 6, 1975. Comoros was subsequently admitted to the United Nations, which recognized the integrity of the entire archipelago as one nation. France, however, acknowledged the sovereignty of only the three islands and upheld the autonomy of Mayotte, designating it a “territorial collectivity” (i.e., neither a territory nor a département) of France in 1976. As relations deteriorated, France withdrew all development and technical aid from Comoros. Ali Soilih became president and attempted to convert the country into a secular, socialist republic. In May 1978 a coup led by a French citizen, Col. Robert Denard, and a group of European mercenaries brought Abdallah, the exiled former president, back into power.\n\nComorian residents call their Country Masiwa , “the islands,” or refer to the individual name of each island. Zisiwa za Komor is a translation of the French words for the country. “Comoro” comes from the Arabic qumr , “the moon” or qamar “whiteness”. Although Comorians practice Sunni Islam of the Chafeite rite, their social organization is matrilineal and residency is matrilocal. Social life is characterized by a widespread system of exchange, which, in turn, creates customary ceremonies and rituals ( aida, shungu ), particularly the Great Weddings ( ndoola nkuu, arusi ). Everyone participates as a member of a given lineage or age group, or as a member of a gender-specific association. Comorian is a Bantu language that looks like, but is not related to, Swahili; each island has its own way of speaking it. The language contains many words of Arabic and French origin. All Comorians receive a Koranic education and learn to write their language in Arabic characters. Formal education is given in French.\n\nThe islanders reflect a diversity of origins. Malay immigrants and Arab and Persian traders have mixed with peoples from Madagascar and with various African peoples. Most of the islands’ inhabitants speak island-specific varieties of Comorian (Shikomoro), a Bantu language related to Swahili and written in Arabic script. Comorian, Arabic, and French are the official languages. French is the language of administration. Most Comorians are Sunni Muslims, and Islam is the state religion.More than two-thirds of the people live in rural areas, and most of the population is centred on the two larger islands; Grande Comore contains about half of the country’s population, Anjouan about two-fifths, and Mohéli less than one-tenth. The capital, Moroni, is the country’s most populous urban area. The birth and death rates are both high in Comoros, and, although infant mortality is a major problem, the population growth rate is about twice the world average. About two-fifths of the population is younger than age 15.\n\nThe Union of Comoros is an African Island nation in the Indian Ocean. The island is located north of Mozambique Channel and borders Mozambique, Madagascar, Tanzania, and Seychelles. The country sits on an area of 1660 square kilometers, and is the third smallest country in Africa. Comoros is one of the least populous countries with a population of only 790,000 people, but it is one of the most densely populated countries in the world. Half the population is below the age of 15 years while 34% of the population lives in urban areas. There are three major ethnic groups in the country with several ethnic minorities. Some of the smaller ethnic minorities in the country of Comoros include the Chinese, French, Dutch, British, and Portuguese. These minority groups arrived in the country during the colonization of Africa in search of slaves. Most of these minority groups have their ancestry in the countries of origin. The majority of expatriates working in Comoros are from the ethnic minority.\n\nComoros, an independent state comprising three of the Comoro Islands in the Indian Ocean, off the coast of East Africa. A fourth island of the Comorian archipelago, Mayotte, is claimed by the country of Comoros but administered by France. The volcanic islands of the Comorian archipelago have been called the “perfumed islands” for their fragrant plant life and are known for their great scenic beauty. The four main islands of the archipelago—“four small effervescent stones, wedged between the nearby large red island [Madagascar] and the Mozambican coast,” in the words of the Comorian writer Sitti Saïd Youssouf—combine African, Arabic, Malagasy, and French influences and were once important in the significant Indian Ocean trade between East Africa and Asian ports such as India and Japan.\n\nComorian residents refer to their country’s “island” as Mashiwa or by their respective names. Zisiwa za Komor is a French translation of the country. “Comoros” is derived from the Arabic words qumr, “moon”, or “whiteness” of Qamar. Despite the Comorians belonging to the Sunni Muslims of the Chafi’i school, their place of residence, as well as social structure, remains matrilineal. Social life is characterized by a vast system of exchanges. This system of exchange creates some noteworthy rituals and ceremonies, like shungu and Aida. Additionally, there are the grand wedding ceremonies that the culture is known for, called ndoola nkuu and arusi. All join as members of a particular pedigree or age group, or as members of a particular gender association.\n\nAlthough Comoros are a rather liberal Muslim country, in Comoros culture, it is disrespectful for women to expose their shoulders, much of their chest, knees, and especially stomach and lower back. Wear shirts or shawls that cover these areas. Locals will not expect foreign, non-Muslim women to cover their heads. When swimming, local women are fully dressed. Foreigners are not expected to do this, but shorts and a swimming shirt is more respectful than a bikini or topless swimming. Men should wear shorts below the knee, though this is less offensive than a woman doing so. Public affection between men and women is not acceptable, though one may rarely see a Comorian man and woman holding hands briefly (in the nightclubs some locals seem to ignore Muslim convention).\n\nComorians are typically from ancient African origins. Locals practice Sunni Islam, and the society is matrilineal. The presence of Islam can be traced back as early as the 11th century. Comorians give importance to family ties, and this has made the population a united cultural and social group. Conflicts are more a result of poor social, political and economic management than ethnic clashes. The history of the islands is characterized by colonization, slave trade, sultanate battles, and Madagascan raids. The Africans first colonized the Comoros islands in the 8th century with the presence of Islam as a civilization and religion recorded as far back as the 11th century. Between that time and the 15th century, Comoros saw the evolution of its chiefdoms into sultanates as more and more Muslim Arabs set up camp on the islands. Commerce flourished and slave trade became commonplace during what is known as the era of the “battling sultans,” which continued for another four centuries.\n\nThe Comoros consists of the four main islands: Ngazidja (French: Grande Comore), Mwali (French: Mohéli), Nzwani (French: Anjouan) and Maore (French: Mayotte), the contested island of Mayotte is administered by France. Nearest Countries to the Comoros are Mozambique, Tanzania, Madagascar, and the Seychelles. The combined area of the volcanic archipelago (including Mayotte) is 2,235 km², compared, the island nation is slightly smaller than Luxembourg or also slightly smaller than the U.S. state of Rhode Island. Comoros has a population of 770,000 (2015). Capital and largest city is Moroni on Grande Comore. Spoken languages are Comorian (Comorian Swahili, a Bantu language), French, and Arabic. Islam is the official state religion, 98% of the population are Sunni Muslims.\n\nIn Comoros, you will often find men wearing the kandu with a kofia on their head while women wear the boubou, shiromani, salouva or bwibwi. The kandu is often embroidered on the collars and sleeves and the kofia, a small white cap, is adorned with elaborate embroidered patterns made with golden threads. Local women can often be seen sewing kofias while sitting in the market or on their doorsteps. Coming from the island of Anjouan, the shiromani is a large traditional and colourful cloth with beautiful patterns that covers almost the entire body of Comorian women. They wear it daily, at work or during a ceremony, often with their faces adorned with ground sandalwood paste. The salouva, a large piece of fabric tied at the chest, is an elegant traditional dress, mainly worn by women in Anjouan and Mohéli. The boubou is a simple dress worn by many women in everyday life, while the bwibwi is the local name for the burkha.\n\nThe Union of the Comoros is a developing nation located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa. Comoros consists of three islands–Ngazidja (also known as Grand Comore), Moheli, and Anjouan–that cover about 900 square miles. A fourth island, Mayotte, officially changed status from a French “collectivity” to an actual French Department in March 2011. All four islands are within the consular jurisdiction of the U.S. Embassy in Antananarivo, Madagascar. Ngazidja is home to the capital city, Moroni, and is the most developed of the three islands. Facilities for tourism are limited and telecommunication links are unreliable. French, Arabic, Swahili, and Comoran are spoken. Even though, Arabic and French are the official languages, most people speak Comoran, a mixture of Arabic and Swahili.\n\nThe Comoros Archipelago—comprising Grande Comore (Njazídja), Anjouan (Nzwani), Mayotte (Mahore), and Mohéli (Mwali)—was originally named by Arab sailors who visited the islands in the late 6th century. They called them Juzu el Kumar (“islands of the moon” in Arabic) because of their brightness during the full moon. Before the arrival of the Arabs, Africans of the Wamakuwa and Bantu tribes had been living on the islands, organized in clans, and had originated the Comorian language, which is still spoken today. The Comoros was also visited by sailors from East Asia, Persia, and Israel. More Arabs arrived on the islands between the 12th and 17th centuries, transforming their social structures and introducing sultanates. The Comorians are a blend of settlers from the past: Iranian traders, mainland Africans, Arabs, and Malagasy. In the early 15th century, Portuguese visited the region. (In 1527, the Comoros islands appeared on a world map designed by Portuguese cartographer Diego Roberso.) Sailors from the Netherlands, France, and other European countries, all attracted by the islands’ geographically strategic position eventually followed them. In the early 17th century, pirates used the Comoros as a base from which to attack and rob merchant vessels. In 1841, King Andreanantsuli of Madagascar, having previously declared himself sultan of Mayotte, sold the island to the French. Later in the 19th century, Ramanetaka, another Malagasy king, formed a relationship with the local authorities on Mohéli, modifying its system of local rule and establishing another sultanate. The Comoros became a French protectorate in 1886. They were placed under the authority of the French governor general of Madagascar in 1908 and given their own internal administration in 1912.\n\nThe history of the Comoros extends to about 800–1000 AD when the archipelago was first inhabited. The Comoros have been inhabited by various groups throughout this time. France colonised the islands in the 19th century, and they became independent in 1975. There is uncertainty about the early population of Comoros. According to one study of early crops, the islands may have been settled first by South East Asian sailors the same way Madagascar was. From around the 15th century AD, Shirazi slave traders established trading ports and brought in slaves from the mainland. In the 16th century, social changes on the East African coast probably linked to the arrival of the Portuguese saw the arrival of a number of Arabs of Hadrami who established alliances with the Shirazis and founded several royal clans. Over the centuries, the Comoros have been settled by a succession of diverse groups from the coast of Africa, the Persian Gulf, Southeast Asia and Madagascar.\n\nOfficially the Union of Comoros, Comoros is an island nation in the Indian Ocean. It is located off eastern Africa’s coast. It sits on the northern end of the Mozambique Channel, between northwestern Madagascar and northeastern Mozambique. The capital is Moroni. Its surface area is 1,862 sq. km. Comoros is Africa’s third smallest country in terms of land area. Its population is 798,000 making it the 6th smallest by population. Its population density is one of the highest in Africa. The islands’ culture and history are diverse. The Union of Comoros has three official languages, Comorian, Arabic, and French. There are four main islands including Grande Comore (Ngazidja), Moheli (Mwali), Anjouan (Nzani), and Mayotte (Mahore). There are also many smaller islands. The island of Mayotte has not been governed by Comoros, instead the French administer it as an overseas territory. In 1974, all of the islands voted for independence from France except Mayotte. France has used its veto power on U.N. Security Council affirming Comoros’ control over the island. The people of Mayotte, on March 29, 2009, voted to become an oversea department of France in 2011. The country is a member of Francophonie, the African Union, Arab League, Indian Ocean Commission, and Organization of the Islamic Conference. Since 1975, numerous coups have occurred. In Comoros, half of the population lives below the poverty line.\n\nImages"
