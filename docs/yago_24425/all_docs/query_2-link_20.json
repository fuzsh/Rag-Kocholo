        "text": "Prayer Profile\n\nThe Mwali of the Comoros Islands The Mwali Comorian live on the islands of Moheli and Anjouan in the Islamic Republic of the Comoros, located in the Indian Ocean between Madagascar and the African nation of Mozambique. The Comoros chain consists of four main islands along with several smaller ones. The island of Moheli, which is also known as Mwali, is one of the smallest islands of the Comoros, and only 5% of the country's population lives there.\n\nThe Mwali Comorian are a blend of settlers from the past: Iranian traders, mainland Africans, Arabs, and Malagasy. Because of poor economic conditions, the islands receive monetary and technical support from other countries.\n\nIn 1975, all the islands of the Comoros, with the exception of Mayotte, declared their independence from France, who had ruled them since 1947. The islands then became known as the Federal Islamic Republic of the Comoros.\n\nWhat Are Their Lives Like?\n\nMoheli is largely plateau that averages 1000 feet in elevation. The valleys are fertile and the hillsides are covered with thick forests. Many of the Mwali Comorian work as farmers or fishermen, while a few breed cattle, sheep, goats, and donkeys. A large number work in industries that produce vanilla and perfume.\n\nThe islands of Moheli and Anjouan are very poor and undeveloped. The basic diet of the Mwali Comorian consists of rice, potatoes, corn, fish, coconuts, and bananas. Other crops that are grown are sweet potatoes, citrus fruits, and pineapples.\n\nAlthough many of the young people now wear Western style clothing, traditional clothing is still common among the adults. In town, a Comorian man will typically wear a white cotton garment and a knee-length shirt, sometimes with a white jacket and white skull cap. When he goes out of town, he wears a long cloth sarong (colorful skirt). Most women wear long, colorful cotton dresses, with bright shawls as face coverings.\n\nPolygamy (the practice of having more than one spouse) is an acceptable practice among the Mwali Comorian. Children are expected to help with the farming, fishing, and caring of the animals. For recreation, the Mwali Comorian enjoy dancing, singing, and playing instruments, especially horns and drums.\n\nAbout 25% of the Mwali Comorian are literate and speak either Swahili, French, and/or Arabic as a second language. Their language is a dialect of Swahili and a part of the Niger-Congo linguistic family. French and Arabic are the official languages of the islands.\n\nWhat Are Their Beliefs?\n\nThe majority of the Mwali Comorian are Shafiite Muslim, yet mosque attendance is very low. Mixed with their Islamic practices is a strong involvement in occultism and spirit possession.\n\nTraditionally, the Mwali Comorian have been very resistant to any kind of religious change; however, they are gradually becoming more receptive.\n\nWhat Are Their Needs?\n\nThe physical needs of the Mwali Comorian are numerous. Major problems on the Comoros islands include poverty, disease, and hunger. A struggling economy results in very high unemployment. In addition, there is a shortage of hospitals and doctors, and many people suffer from illnesses and chronic malnutrition. Because of a poor water supply, good hygiene is lacking. Such problems contribute to a high death rate, especially among young children.\n\nThe spiritual needs of the Mwali Comorian are even greater than their physical needs. Though there is freedom of religion on the islands, evangelism is not well received by these Shafiite Muslims. Their commitment to Islam, along with their involvement in occult practices, has made the Mwali Comorian difficult to reach.\n\nOnly portions of the Bible have been translated into their Swahili dialect. Their Islamic mentality has made it difficult to reach these people. Consequently, there are very few known believers.\n\nPrayer Points\n\nAsk the Lord of the harvest to send forth laborers to the Mwali Comorian.\n\nAsk the Lord to speed the completion of the translation of the Bible into their language.\n\nPray that God will reveal Himself to the Mwali Comorian through dreams and visions.\n\nPray that God will give the small number of Mwali Comorian believers boldness to share Christ with their own people.\n\nTake authority over the spiritual principalities and powers that are keeping the Mwali Comorian bound.\n\nAsk God to raise up an army of intercessors for the Mwali Comorian.\n\nPray that Christian radio broadcasts, evangelical literature, and the Jesus film will be made available to the Mwali Comorian.\n\nAsk the Lord to bring forth a triumphant Mwali Comorian church for the glory of His name!\n\nSee also the following related groups:\n\nthe Comorian of Mayotte; the Ngazija Comorian of Comoros; the Nzwani Comorian of Comoros; and the Ngazija Comorian of Madagascar.\n\nStatistics\n\nLatest estimates from the World Evangelization Research Center.\n\nTHE PEOPLE\n\nPeople name: Mwali\n\nCountry: Comoros\n\nTheir language: Mwali (Swahili)\n\nPopulation:\n\nLargest religion:\n\nChristians: 0%\n\nChurch members: 0\n\nScriptures in their own language: Portions\n\nJesus Film in their own language: None\n\nChristian broadcasts in their own language: Available\n\nMission agencies working among this people: 0\n\nPersons who have heard the Gospel: 5,900 (25%)\n\nPersons who have never heard the Gospel: 17,600 (75%)\n\nTHEIR COUNTRY\n\nCountry: Comoros\n\nPopulation:\n\nMajor peoples in size order:\n\nMajor religions:\n\nNumber of denominations: 6"
