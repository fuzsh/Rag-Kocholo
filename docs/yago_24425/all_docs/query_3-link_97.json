        "text": "The Malagasy language is not strictly confined to Madagascar but it is also spoken in Mayotte, one of the four islands which constitute the Comoros archipelago. The inhabitants of Mayotte are, in fact, divided between two very distinct mother languages, one is Shimaore, a Bantu dialect similar to the dialects spoken in the other three islands, the other is Malagasy, an Austronesian language. In turn, Malagasy is represented by two distinct varieties, one is the Kibosy Kimaore, a name which simply means ”Malagasy of Mayotte” (this name is sometimes used to indistinctly denote both varieties) and the other is the Kibosy Kiantalaotsy. It is usually stated that Kibosy Kimaore is close to the Northern Madagascar varieties, while Kibosy Kiantalaotsy is very close to Mahajanga Sakalava (Glottolog classifies Mahajanga Sakalava and Kibosy Kiantalaotsy as twin varieties). While we clearly confirm the cladistic position of Kibosy Kimaore, we find that Kibosy Kiantalaotsy is not particularly close to Mahajanga Sakalava, but it is closer to the Sakalava dialects of the South-West of Madagascar. Moreover, Kibosy Kiantalaotsy seems to be rather the result of multiple contributions from Madagascar than the offspring of a single dialect or a few dialects. Our outcome is based upon the comparison of the two Mayotte varieties with sixty different Madagascar varieties.\n\nThe dialects of Madagascar belong to the Greater Barito East group of the Austronesian family and it is widely accepted that the Island was colonized by Indonesian sailors after a maritime trek that probably took place around 650 CE. The language most closely related to Malagasy dialects is Maanyan, but Malay is also strongly related especially for navigation terms. Since the Maanyan Dayaks live along the Barito river in Kalimantan (Borneo) and they do not possess the necessary skill for long maritime navigation, they were probably brought as subordinates by Malay sailors. In a recent paper we compared 23 different Malagasy dialects in order to determine the time and the landing area of the first colonization. In this research we use new data and new methods to confirm that the landing took place on the southeast coast of the Island. Furthermore, we are able to state here that colonization probably consisted of a single founding event rather than multiple settlements.To reach our goal we find out the internal kinship relations among all the 23 Malagasy dialects and we also find out the relations of the 23 dialects to Malay and Maanyan. The method used is an automated version of the lexicostatistic approach. The data from Madagascar were collected by the author at the beginning of 2010 and consist of Swadesh lists of 200 items for 23 dialects covering all areas of the Island. The lists for Maanyan and Malay were obtained from a published dataset integrated with the author's interviews.\n\nIn a context where repetition in primary school is still a central problem in Malagasy public schools, it is important to question the contribution of preschool, a solution recommended to fight against repetition, as well as the profiles of these pupils who repeat. Preschoolers have an advantage because they learned the mother tongue as early as preschool and they perform better compared to non-preschoolers. This text presents some elements of the problem of repetition during the first years of primary in public schools. It also explains the results of research on impact of preschool education on pupils educational path and the continuation of their studies. Then, the article presents the results of study of pupils from public primary schools of the first year in the province of Antananarivo. This study aims to identify the profiles of pupils who are most likely to repeat in the first year of primary school. Analysing the data using the ICHC-MGK (Implicative and Cohesive Hierarchica..."
