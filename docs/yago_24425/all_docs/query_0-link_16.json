        "text": "Did you know that Arabic is the fifth most common primary language in the world?\n\nThere are approximately 313 million people who speak Arabic. That number increases to 422 million people when you include non-native speakers or those who speak Arabic as a secondary language. The only languages that are more widely spoken are Mandarin, English, Hindi, and Spanish.\n\nIn this post, we’re going to discuss the Arabic language in use today. You’ll learn which countries speak Arabic as a primary language and about countries where Arabic is a recognized minority language. We’ll also discuss countries where there are large populations of Arabic speakers, though it is not a primary language.\n\nWe’ll break this down a bit so that you understand the demographics of these countries, the population of Arabic speakers, and the dialect of Arabic you’ll find in different locations.\n\nArabic Dialects in Use Today\n\nArabic is in the same language family as Aramaic, an ancient language that is still in use in some areas today. Throughout time, the ancient language has influenced many cultures and you can find roots of Arabic in several regions.\n\nThe Island of Sicily, for instance, has its own language (Sicilian) which residents are currently trying to preserve. As part of Italy, the recognized language taught is school is now traditional Italian. The Sicilian language has many root words that are Arabic and Greek in origin, from different eras in history where these people occupied the land.\n\nArabic is also a primary or recognized language in many parts of the world. In these different regions, the language has developed with influences from the people in those areas. This results in many different dialects which are related, and often understandable to other Arabic speakers, but still distinct in their own right.\n\nThere are many dialects of Arabic spoken today, but they are divided into a few main categories. These include Classical Arabic also called Quranic, Modern Standard Arabic, and Colloquial Arabic.\n\nClassical Arabic\n\nClassical Arabic has spoken in the 7th-9th centuries AD. This is also called Quranic because it’s the form of Arabic that the Quran was written in and it’s the standard literary form for the language. This is the language used in religious texts, as well as some fiction and poetry.\n\nModern Standard Arabic\n\nModern Standard Arabic is the currently recognized and taught form of the language. This is the language used in education and written communication by Arab speakers. It would be the form of Arabic that you’re most familiar with in business dealings or any formal communication.\n\nModern Standard Arabic is used in trade, business correspondence, and the language most professional texts adhere to, such as books or content used by Universities. This is also a standard dialect and many Arabic speakers do use Modern Standard Arabic, but pronunciations often differ. As with any language, regions, backgrounds, and influences will alter the way words are spoken.\n\nColloquial Arabic\n\nThis is the daily Arabic or the specific dialect used in the region. There are many dialects, and some are very similar to each other. However, some differ so drastically that they can be difficult to understand, even to native speakers of a different dialect.\n\nThe most common of colloquial Arabic dialects are Egyptian, Maghrebi, and Gulf.\n\nThe Egyptian dialect is spoken in Egypt.

There are other language traditions mixed into the Egyptian dialect, such as Turkish and English.\n\nMaghrebi is another very popular dialect. Also called Darija or Derja, the language continuously changes, and new terms are added to the lexicon. The dialect has adopted Modern Standard Arabic terms, as well as other languages that include Italian and French.\n\nThe Gulf dialect is popular in the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar, and some parts of Saudi Arabia.

In essence, the Gulf dialect is a collection of dialects that are similar to each other, but with some distinctly geographic terms depending on where you are.\n\nCountries Where Arabic Is the Primary Language\n\nAs a primary language, Arabic is popular in the Middle East, Africa, and Asia.
