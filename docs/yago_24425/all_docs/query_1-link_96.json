The network coverage is strong around the Moroni area but tends to get weaker as you move farther out. You can buy prepaid credit and get 2G and 3G wireless services. Telma also offers 4 G LTE services as well. Locals call SIM cards ‘SIMSIM’s and you can get one almost anywhere on the island. However, do buy them from the official stores so you do not pick a fake SIM. Buy a SIM on arrival at the airport while credits can be purchased at most stores and supermarkets. Dial #123# to check your balance.\n\nThe island nation of Comoros was first discovered by the Europeans in 1505. It was visited by the Portuguese at first and later was colonized by the French in 1841. Comoros has been conquered and ruled by various people such as Persians, Africans and Indonesians. Arabs and Persians settled in small numbers in islands like Madagascar in the ancient past. Malayo-Indonesian people also settled in sizable numbers along with Bantu speaking people from the African mainland. The Shirazi Persians who arrived later established Islam as the dominant religion.\n\nThe nation was used for its agricultural products that were exported to other lands. The sale of spices and slaves with other countries along the Indian Ocean encouraged the economy to thrive. Comoros attained independence from France in 1975. However, the island of Mayotte decided to keep its connections with France. The island of Comoros has always been under the influence of various coups and civil unrest. Most islanders have to rely on subsistence farming for a livelihood. Comoros tourism is also noted for its picturesque beaches. However, the history of political unrest has hampered any growth to promote tourism in the island nation.\n\nComoros is a group of islands at the north end of the Mozambique Channel in the Indian Ocean. The island nation lies between Madagascar and the southeast African mainland on the east coast of Africa. Grande Comore, Moheli, Anjouan and Mayotte are the islands from northwest to southeast. The islands emerged from the floor of the Indian Ocean due to volcanic activity.\n\nThe nation is famous for its coral reefs, coastal areas and the broad expanse of open sandy beaches. You can find recent lava flows in a few coastal areas. While other lava rushes are covered by smooth rocks and eroded reminders of activity.\n\nGrande Comore is the largest of the islands while Moroni is the capital that lies in the shadows of a volcano on the west coast. Moheli is the smallest island of the group consisting mainly of a plateau. Shipping is restricted due to a strong sea swell while the hillsides are covered by thick forests.\n\nArt and Music\n\nComoros culture is rich and has diverse origins. The island is a thriving example of Swahili culture with influences from Malay immigrants and Arab traders. Graffiti is deep-rooted in the culture and is now globally recognised. Basketry, woodcarving, jewellery making and embroidery are traditional forms of art expressions. Comorian music has a blend of French, Arabic, African, Indian and Western sounds.\n\nThe music is unique to the island and depicts various cultures and styles. The Comorian version of Zanzibar's music called twarab is a popular genre. Some leading music bands include Sambeco and Belle Lumiere. Violin and oud are the Comorian instruments that accompany twarab musicians.\n\nFood and Drink\n\nComoros traditional food is influenced by Arab and French flavours. You get a fusion of sorts with European cuisine with an East African twist. Sauces are spiced with cardamom, nutmeg, cinnamon, cloves and vanilla essences poured over rice dishes. Meat or fish is a typical Comoros food with goat meat being popular. Beef is reserved for special occasions while cod, fish, crab, lobster-based cuisine are also widely eaten.\n\nMust-Try Comoros National Dishes\n\nMkatra foutra (fried bread with coconut water), Pilaou (spicy meat and rice), M'tsolola (fish and green plantain with coconut milk stew), Langouste a la Vanille (boiled lobster in vanilla sauce), Poutou (a hot sauce made with chilli peppers, onion and lemon), Mataba (Cassava leaves)\n\nMust-Try Comoros National Drinks\n\nCastle Beer, Wine, Soft Drinks, Coconut Water\n\nHospitality\n\nComoros is an Islamic country where religious laws and customs are respected. Foreigners are not expected to expose and women need to be covered conservatively. Locals are tolerant of non-Muslims and friendly. Drinking alcohol in public is disrespectful and restaurants serve alcohol only to foreigners. Elders are respected and greeted with 'kewsi' as a gesture. Locals are happy to talk to tourists. However, do not hand over money, sweets or gifts. It destroys the human connection as locals begin to see you as a rich westerner. It is advised to ask permission for photographs to avoid violent reactions.\n\nComoros island tourism welcomes you to relax on picture-perfect beaches on the northwest coast.\n\nCheck out Comoros history in the capital, Moroni with Arab influences.\n\nVisit the National Museum of Comoros or bring home spices from the local markets.\n\nDip in the turquoise blue waters of Mitsamiouli Beach to find yourself in paradise.\n\nVisit the bottomless saltwater lake on the north coast of Grand Comore.\n\nSpend time watching turtles hatch their eggs at Itsamia.\n\nEnjoy fantastic humpback whale watching as they splash in the water in Moheli.\n\nHike a volcano crater to Karthala for fabulous views and adventure treks.\n\nComoros Weather | COM Climate\n\nThe best time to go to Comoros is the months from April to November.
