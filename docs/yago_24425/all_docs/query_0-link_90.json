        "text": "The pace of life is relaxed here, and there’s no set ‘trail’ to follow. Visiting the Comoros is about kicking back and getting into the local rhythm, and with so few tourists it makes a pleasant change from the well-trodden routes of much of East Africa. Our Comoros holidays and tours are for those who want more than just lying on the beach. We offer the chance to discover a forgotten and enchanting world.\n\nCulture\n\nArabic and French are the official languages, but most people here speak a form of Swahili. You’ll find it easier if you know at least a few phrases of French.\n\nThe population is predominantly Sunni Muslim. However, traces of pre-Islamic belief still exist, with soothsayers who claim to be able to read fortunes and cast spells.\n\nThe majority of the population are descended from slaves brought from the mainland, mixed with people of Malay, Polynesian, Arabic and Malagasy origins. Polygamy is still fairly common here, and marriage ceremonies can be very elaborate – don’t miss the chance to see one if you’re invited.\n\nWhen to go on holiday to Comoros\n\nThe best time to visit the Comoros is between March and October, which is the cooler season, when less rain falls. Outside of this time temperatures can be high, with a lot of rain, and strong tropical storms can occur.\n\nStart planning your trip to Comoros"
