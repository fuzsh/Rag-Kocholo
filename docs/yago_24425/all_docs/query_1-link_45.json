The low educational level of the labor force contributes to a subsistence level of economic activity, high unemployment, and a heavy dependence on foreign grants and technical assistance. Agriculture, including fishing, hunting, and forestry, is the leading sector of the economy. It contributes nearly 40% to GDP, employs 80% of the labor force, and provides most of the exports. The country is not self-sufficient in food production; rice, the main staple, accounts for the bulk of imports. The government is struggling to upgrade education and technical training, to privati ze commercial and industrial enterprises, to improve health services, to diversify exports, to promote tourism, and to reduce the high population growth rate. Continued foreign support is essential if the goal of 4% annual GDP growth is to be reached in the late 1990s.\n\nGDP: purchasing power parity - $424 million (2001 est.)\n\nGDP - real growth rate: 1% (2001 est.)\n\nGDP - per capita:purchasing power parity - $710 (2001 est.)\n\nGDP - composition by sector:\n\nagriculture: 40%\n\nindustry: 4%\n\nservices :56% (2001 est.)\n\nInflation rate - consumer price index: 3.5% (2001 est.)\n\nLabor force:\n\ntotal : 144,500 (1996 est.)\n\nby occupation: agriculture 80%, government 3%\n\nUnemployment rate:20% (1996 est.)\n\nBudget:\n\nrevenues : $27.6 million\n\nexpenditures:$NA, including capital expenditures of $NA (2001 est.)\n\nIndustries: tourism, perfume distillation\n\nIndustrial production growth rate: -2% (1999 est.)\n\nElectricity - capacity: 16,000 kW (1991)\n\nElectricity - production: 19 million kWh (2000)\n\nElectricity - consumption per capita:17.67 million kWh (2000)\n\nAgriculture - products: vanilla, cloves, perfume essences, copra, coconuts, bananas, cassava (tapioca)\n\nExports:\n\ntotal value: $35.3 million (f.o.b., 2001 est.)\n\ncommodities: vanilla, ylang-ylang, cloves, perfume oil, copra\n\npartners: France 46%, US 18%, Singapore 18%, Germany 9% (1999)\n\nImports:\n\ntotal value: $40.9 million (f.o.b., 1993 est.)\n\ncommodities: rice and other foodstuffs, consumer goods; petroleum products, cement, transport equipment\n\npartners: France 34%, South Africa 14%, Kenya 7%, Pakistan 4% (1999)\n\nDebt - external: $225 million (yearend 2000 est.)\n\nEconomic aid:\n\nrecipient: $10 million (2001 est.)\n\nCurrency: 1 Comoran franc (CF) = 100 centimes\n\nExchange rates: Comoran francs per US dollar - 557.09 (January 2002), 549.78 (2001), 533.98 (2000), 461.77 (1999), 442.46 (1998), 437.75 (1997)\n\nnote: prior to January 1999, the official rate was pegged to the French franc at 75 Comoran francs per French franc; since 1 January 1999, the Comoran franc is pegged to the euro at a rate of 491.9677 Comoran francs per euro\n\nFiscal year: calendar year\n\nCommunications\n\nTelephones: 7,000 (2000)\n\nTelephone system: sparse system of microwave radio relay and HF radiotelephone communication stations\n\ndomestic: HF radiotelephone communications and microwave radio relay\n\ninternational: HF radiotelephone communications to Madagascar and Reunion\n\nRadio broadcast stations: AM 1, FM 4, shortwave 1 (2001)\n\nRadios: 90,000 (1997)\n\nTelevision broadcast stations:NA Televisions: 1,000 (1997)\n\nTransportation\n\nRailways: 0 km\n\nHighways:\n\ntotal:880 km\n\npaved: 673 km\n\nunpaved :207 km (1996)\n\nPorts and harbors: Fomboni, Moroni, Mutsamudu\n\nMerchant marine:\n\nTotal 6 ships (1,000 GRT or over) totaling 139,779 GRT/205,369 DWT\n\nships by type: cargo 6\n\nnote: includes some foreign-owned ships registered here as a flag of convenience: Malta 1, Pakistan 1, Turkey 1 (2002 est.)\n\nAirports: 4 (2001)\n\nAirports - with paved runways:\n\ntotal: 4\n\n2,438 to 3,047 m: 1\n\n914 to 1,523 m: 3 (2001)\n\nMilitary\n\nMilitary branches: Comoran Security Force\n\nMilitary manpower - availability:\n\nmales age 15-49: 145,509 (2002 est.)\n\nMilitary manpower - fit for military service:\n\nmales: 86,455 (2002 est.)\n\nMilitary expenditures - dollar figure: $6 million (FY01)\n\nMilitary expenditures - percent of GDP:3% (FY01)\n\nTransnational Issues"
