        "text": "The Comoros is a volcanic archipelago off Africa’s east coast, in the warm Indian Ocean waters of the Mozambique Channel. The nation state’s largest island, Grande Comore (Ngazidja) is ringed by beaches and old lava from active Mt. Karthala volcano. Around the port and medina in the capital, Moroni, are carved doors and a white colonnaded mosque, the Ancienne Mosquée du Vendredi, recalling the islands’ Arab heritage.\n\nThe Comoros archipelago consists of four main islands aligned along a northwest-southeast axis at the north end of the Mozambique Channel, between Mozambique and the island of Madagascar. Still widely known by their French names, the islands officially have been called by their Swahili names by the Comorian government. They are Grande Comore (Njazidja), Mohéli (Mwali), Anjouan (Nzwani), and Mayotte (Mahoré). The islands’ distance from each other—Grande Comore is some 200 kilometers from Mayotte, forty kilometers from Mohéli, and eighty kilometers from Grande Comore—along with a lack of good harbor facilities, make transportation and communication difficult. Comoros has lots of sun.\n\nKey Cities\n\nKey cities in Comoros include: Moroni, Moutsamoudou, Fomboni, Domoni, Sima, Ouani, Mirontsi, Mkiriwadjumoi, Koni-Djodjo, Moya\n\nHistorical, Cultural facts & Religion\n\nEuropean colonial powers agreed that the Comorian archipelago would come under French rule in 1886–87, and it became an overseas territory of France in 1947. Three of the islands gained independence in 1975. The islands’ history of political unrest, however, has hampered efforts to promote tourism\n\nIslam is the dominant religion, and it influences Comoros’ culture and traditions deeply. Customs should be respected, though locals are generally tolerant of outside cultures. Many people also believe in earthly spirits and the power of djinn, which is derived from African, Arab and Madagascan traditions.\n\nBrief Country History\n\nIt is believed that the first people to visit the Comoros islands were the Phoenician sailors. Bantu-speaking Africans were the earliest settlers of Comoros and evidence of their habitation on the islands is found from the 6th century. Traces of this culture have merged with sequential African, Malagasy, and Arab waves. Shirazi emigrants started to arrive in the country sometime after the 10th century AD.\n\nIn the 16th century, a number of social changes took place on the East African coast. Most of these changes were possibly related to the Portuguese arrival. This led to the influx of numerous Hadrami Arabs who forged coalitions with the Shirazis and established some royal clans.\n\nAs the centuries went by, Comoros was occupied by a series of diverse communities from Madagascar, Southeast Asia, the Persian Gulf, and the African coast. Explorers from Portugal were the first to visit the archipelago in 1505.\n\nThe French Parmentier brothers visited the islands in 1529. Besides these two brothers, Portugal was the only other country that visited Comoros in the 16th century. It was in the 17th century when the Dutch and British started arriving in the country and the Ndzwani Island was soon made a key supply location on the eastern route. Ndzwani Island was governed by a Sultan who frequently tried to expand his power to the islands; Mwali and Mayotte. Ngazidja was disunited and was at some point divided into 12 kingdoms.\n\nLanguage (s) Written & Spoken\n\nThe official languages of Comoros are Comorian, French and Arabic. Comorian (or Shikomoro) is a Bantu language closely related to Swahili. It is by far the most spoken language in the country, 96.9% of inhabitants speak island-specific varieties of Comorian (Shikomoro), a Bantu language related to Swahili and written in Arabic script. Comorian, Arabic, and French are the official languages.\n\nImportant Types of Commerce in Comoros\n\nComoros is an island country in the Indian Ocean situated in the northern end of the Mozambique Channel. The country comprises of three main islands in the Comoros Archipelago and several other minor islands. The archipelago is located between the African coast and Madagascar, with no land border between the two. Comoros covers a total area of approximately 785 square miles, making it one of the smallest countries in the world. It also claims 120 square miles of the territorial sea. The capital city is Moroni, located on the Ngazidja, the largest island of the Comoros Archipelago. Comoros has a population of 850,680 people, making it one of the most densely populated countries in the world. The country is heavily reliant on the fishing and tourism industries.\n\nComoros is one of the poorest countries in the world with very few natural resources. The country has an estimated GDP per capita income of $700 and a very high unemployment rate of 14.3%. Agriculture is the leading sector in the economy, accounting for 38.4% of the workforce in Comoros. The current priorities for the government are poverty reduction and economic growth. The high population density and growth, especially in the agricultural zone has affected agricultural production since agricultural land is being converted to settlements. The fiscal policies are continuously constrained by the high civil service wage bill, erratic fiscal revenue, and external debts. Industrial activities such as manufacturing and processing do not contribute much to the economy. The principal industries involve those processing cash crops for export. Other industries are mainly geared towards meeting domestic demand. Here are some of the notable industries in Comoros.\n\nAgriculture\n\nFishing\n\nForestry\n\nTourism\n\nLanguage Services US and others will provide working with Comoros\n\nExporting products from Comoros acts as one of the major contributions to its GDP. Success in export & international trade relies on clear communication. Culturally effective interpretation and translation are essential for building respectful, confident, and resilient business relationships. Clients exporting from Comoros and internationally will add value to their export propositions when utilizing French and Arabic language services. Misunderstanding on labeling or certifications during export & international trade can result in a loss of a shipment, particularly with perishable goods that are time-sensitive. In an industry where time is of the essence and accuracy is essential, Professional translation and interpretation can help you avoid these mistakes."
