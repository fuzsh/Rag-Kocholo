It changes the names of the autonomous islands in languages other than English and French.\n\nISO 3166-1 Newsletter Number V-7, dated 2003-01-14, shows the change of the official name of the Comoros from Islamic Federal Republic of the Comoros to Union of the Comoros. The change was reported on this page on 2002-05-22.\n\nOn 2001-12-23, a referendum was held on a new constitution, which passed by a majority of almost 77%. The constitution provides that the country's name will be Union des Comores, and it comprises the autonomous islands of Anjouan, Grande Comore, Mayotte, and Mohéli. Mayotte is in fact a territorial collectivity of France, and has been since 1976. Before that it had been part of the Comoro Islands protectorate. The new Comoros constitution would allow Mayotte to rejoin the country on an equal basis with the other three islands. Paraskevas Renesis reports that Anjouan and Mohéli adopted their fundamental laws (constitutions) on 2002-03-10, and Grande Comore followed suit on 2002-04-07. Their status has therefore changed from governorates to autonomous islands.\n\nI have recently acquired newer population figures for the divisions of the Comoros.\n\nCountry overview:\n\nShort nameCOMOROS ISO codeKM FIPS codeCN LanguageComoran Time zone+3 CapitalMoroni\n\nThese islands, along with Mayotte, were a French protectorate at the start of the 20th century. On 1912-07-25, they became French colonies. They gained full independence on 1975-07-06, leaving Mayotte behind as a French possession (by a local vote).\n\nOther names of country:\n\nDanish: Comorerne, Den Islamiske Forbundsrepublik Comorerne\n\nDutch: Kamaran, Comoren, Unie der Comoren (formal)\n\nEnglish: Union of the Comoros (formal)\n\nFinnish: Komorit\n\nFrench: Comores fp, Union f des Comores (formal)\n\nGerman: Komoren f\n\nIcelandic: Kómoreyjar\n\nItalian: Comore fp\n\nNorwegian: Komorene, Den islamske forbundsrepublikk Komorene (formal) (Bokmål), Komorane, Den islamske sambandsrepublikken Komorane (formal) (Nynorsk)\n\nPortuguese: Comores, Comoros, União f das Comores fp (formal)\n\nRussian: Коморы, Союз Коморских Островов (formal)\n\nSpanish: Comoras fp, Unión f de las Comoras fp (formal)\n\nSwedish: Comorerna, Komorerna\n\nTurkish: Komoros\n\nOrigin of name:\n\nArabic qamar: moon\n\nPrimary subdivisions:\n\nComoros is divided into three autonomous islands.\n\nAutonomous IslandHASCISOFIPSPopulationArea(km.²)Area(mi.²)Capital AnjouanKM.ANACN01259,099424164Mutsamudu Grande ComoreKM.GCGCN02295,6651,148443Moroni MohéliKM.MOMCN0335,387290112Fomboni 3 islands590,1511,862719\n\nHASC: Hierarchical administrative subdivision codes.\n\nISO: Codes from ISO 3166-2.\n\nFIPS: Codes from FIPS PUB 10-4.\n\nPopulation: 2003-09 census (provisional results).\n\nTerritorial extent:\n\nThe territory of each autonomous island includes one major island of the Comoro Archipelago and the islets in its immediate vicinity.\n\nThe UN LOCODE page for Comoros lists locations in the country, some of them with their latitudes and longitudes, some with their ISO 3166-2 codes for their subdivisions.
