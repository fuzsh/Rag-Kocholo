        "text": "Comoros Film & Photography Production Services & Camera Crews\n\nAre you a media company, brand, ad agency or production company looking for film / photography production support or shooting crew in the Comoros? Contact us for trusted fixers, producers, directors, DoPs, videographers, photographers, and full shooting crews tailored for the specific needs of your project.\n\nFilming in the Comoros\n\nFor an introduction to shooting in the Comoros see below notes on film locations, permits, when to shoot, unique local stories, costs, tax incentives, crews, talent, equipment, communications, art department, studios, post facilities, visas and work permits for filming, transport, film-friendly accommodation, and safety advice.\n\nComoros Film Locations\n\nThe Comoros is an African island archipelago in the Indian Ocean made up of 3 islands: Ngazidja (Grande Comore), Mwali (Mohéli), and Nzwani (Anjouan). The nearby island of Maore (Mayotte) is claimed by Comoros, but administered by France.\n\nThe islands are volcanic and surrounded by coral reefs making for beautiful paradise-island film locations including dhows sailing by palm-lined white sand beaches, tropical mountain landscapes, and waterfalls.\n\nAgricultural film locations include plantations of nutmeg, vanilla, cloves, pepper, jasmine, perfume essences (ylang-ylang), and copra.\n\nLife on Earth (1979-) filmed in the Comoros.\n\nFilm locations can be divided into three islands:\n\nNgazidja (Grande Comore)\n\nGrande Comore is the largest island in the Comoros.\n\nMoroni is the capital and main entry point by air. Film locations of note include the photogenic Ancienne Mosquee du Vendredi (Old Friday Mosque), Zawiyani ya Salmata Hamissi Mosque, Volo Volo market, and the winding alleys of the Medina section.\n\nGrande Comore paradise beaches of note include Mitsamiouli beach, Itsandra beach, and Chomoni beach.\n\nMount Karthala is an active volcano and the highest point of the Comoros.\n\nLac Salé is a beautiful salt water crater lake location.\n\nThe Comoros offer some great underwater photography options. Vailheu Bank and Massiwa wreck are two dive sites of note.\n\nMwali (Mohéli)\n\nMohéli is the smallest of the islands.\n\nIt known for its natural beauty with beautiful beaches, baobab trees, and range of fauna such as Livingstone bats, whales, and nesting turtles.\n\nItsamia is a great place to photograph green turtles eggs hatching.\n\nMoheli Marine Park is a good place to photograph sharks, humpback whales, and coelecanths.\n\nNzwani (Anjouan)\n\nAnjouan is known for its waterfalls and lush vegetation.\n\nThe town of Mutsamudu is built in the Shirazi/Swahili style.\n\nDomoni is a city of interest to filmmakers and photographers.\n\nComoros Film Location Permits\n\nMost locations are possible given time, money and the right approach. It is illegal to photography of government buildings, military installations, and other key infrastructure such as ports, train stations, and airports, without the permission of relevant authorities. You could be fined, have your photographic equipment confiscated, and risk arrest. Please contact us for location specific information.\n\nWhen To Shoot?\n\nThe islands have a tropical climate with temperatures cooler and wetter at higher altitudes. The hot and humid wet season, which experiences cyclones, runs from November to April. The cool, dry season from May and October is the best time to film for weather. For monthly weather statistics please see here.\n\nThe Comoros is a predominately Muslim nation where holidays such as Ramadan are observed.\n\nPublic holidays may affect timing, availability and costs. See here for public holiday dates in the Comoros.\n\nUnique Local Stories\n\nBrands are looking for local stories that match their brand narrative. Our local teams are a great lead for sourcing those unique stories and characters.\n\nIf you are looking for stories for your next shoot, send us your brief and we will pitch you ideas.\n\nIf you have a unique story you would like to pitch to a brand anywhere in the world, pitch us your idea. We have well-established processes to ensure that your ideas are properly seen and protected.\n\nCosts & Tax Incentives\n\nCosts. Locations, local talent and support crew are inexpensive but since little to no filming infrastructure exists all key crew and equipment must be brought in from abroad. Because the Comoros are so isolated, prices of imported goods tend to be more expensive than the rest of East Africa. Our Comoran fixer will negotiate local deals and provide the appropriate level of production support to match every budget.\n\nTax Incentives. At present there are no tax incentives for foreign commercials or films shooting in the Comoros.\n\nFilm Crew & Talent\n\nCrews. Comorian, French, and Arabic are the official languages. The Comoros has a very small local pool of directors, directors of photography and stills photographers. Key crew needs to be brought in from abroad.\n\nContact us if you are looking for a director, DP, photographer, videographer (cameraman / camera operator), camera assistant (focus puller), sound operator, grip, gaffer, stylist, hair and makeup, PA / runner, production driver, or any other film crew for your shoot in the Comoros.\n\nTalent day rates and buyouts are reasonable and negotiated on a personal level.\n\nThe official languages are French, Arabic, and Comorian.\n\nThe Comoran people are a blend of African, Arab and Malayo-Indonesian. Other talent looks need to be cast abroad.\n\nComoros Film Equipment\n\nEquipment. You will need to bring in all camera, grip and lighting equipment from abroad.\n\nCommunications. Internet slow and unreliable.\n\nCommunication is key. Our agility and global experience allows us to customise the right communications systems for every shoot.\n\nWeb posted casting, scouting, and videoconferencing.\n\nFor clients that are unable to attend set we offer a virtual video village solution. This dedicated and secure high-resolution video streaming platform allows clients from one or multiple timezones to view setups without compromise and to participate in real-time with the team on set. Separate systems can be set up for the discrete conversations that are required to make a job run right. Working remotely with our local teams reduces your content production costs, turnaround times, carbon footprint, and risks associated with unpredictable global events.\n\nArt Department, Studios, Backlots, & Post Production\n\nArt department and set construction is very basic.\n\nStudios and backlots. None exist at present.\n\nPost Production. Post abroad.\n\nVisas & Work Permits\n\nAll nationals are required to have visas to enter the Comoros. Visas are available on arrival. Contact your closest Comoran embassy or representative for more information. US passport holders see here for more information.\n\nTransport & Accommodation\n\nTransportation Infrastructure is quite basic. Most roads are paved but narrow and slow going, particularly during the wet season. Our Comoran fixer organises safe and reliable 4WD transportation. Getting between islands is best done by boat or plane. Services are limited so book ahead. Prince Said Ibrahim International Airport is located on Grande Comore. Several international airlines service flights to the Comoros.\n\nAccommodation.
