Its beautiful indigenous people are said to be descendants of Arab traders, Malay immigrants, Malagasy and continental African people with an intricate ethnic mix of the Antalote, Cafre, Makoa, Oimatsaha, and Sakalava ethnic groups.\n\nThe main spoken language is Comoran, which is similar to Swahili but has elements borrowed from Arabic language. In addition they also speak languages Malagasy, Swahili, Arabic, French and Makua.\n\nIslam is the dominant religion in the country with about 99% Muslim Comorians following the religion. Christianity and other religions have approximately 1% of the population.\n\nThe country’s national emblem is a green flag symbolising the color of Islam, with a crescent moon and four white stars, that represent the four islands."
