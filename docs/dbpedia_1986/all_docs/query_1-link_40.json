        "text": "$29.95\n\nRetirement can be a jungle of decision-making. What sort of assets to invest in? How long will your money last? Are you eligible for any age pension?

Add the challenges of finding the right advice, understanding new products that keep evolving, estate planning, volatile markets, unexpected events such as GFC and COVID-19, and continual changes to our tax, superannuation, age pension and aged care regulations … Above all, how do you value and nurture your greatest assets – your health and your relationships?\n\nThis book will be your guide for the rest of your life. In the simple style for which Noel is renowned, the book covers all the above topics and many more.
