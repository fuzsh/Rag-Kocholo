        "text": "This is a new book. Condition: Brand New.\n\nThe fastest growing demographic in Australia are retirees, with the number of people over 75 expected to double within 10 years. Retirement is often touted as a worry-free time - but it's also a time full of unique challenges.\n\nRetirement can be a jungle of decision-making.\n\nWhat sort of assets will you invest in?\n\nHow long will your money last?\n\nAre you eligible for any age pension?\n\nIs downsizing right for you?\n\nHow much should you spend now, and how much would you like to leave to your kids?\n\nAdd the challenges of finding the right advice, understanding new products that keep evolving, estate planning, volatile markets, unexpected events such as the global financial crisis and COVID-19, and continual changes to our tax, superannuation, age pension and aged care regulations... Above all, how do you value and nurture your greatest assets - your health and your relationships?\n\nThese are just a few of the major issues covered in Retirement Made Simple - by acclaimed financial expert Noel Whittaker, who has been writing about these issues for more than 35 years\n\nThis updated edition of Retirement Made Simple includes the major superannuation and pension changes that took effect in July 2023 and this book will be your guide for the rest of your life. In the simple style for which Noel is renowned, the book covers all the above topics and many more. It will become your indispensable guide on what we hope will be a happy, healthy and prosperous retirement.\n\nAnother gem from Australia's most trusted personal finance author. An excellent, no-nonsense guide to taking control of your future - Stephen Miles, Investment Editor, Sydney Morning Herald, The Age\n\nNoel's greatest gift is his ability to explain complex matters in everyday terms - Des Houghton, former editor, Sunday Mail\n\nThis book fills a big gap - seniors need all the financial literacy they can get, and now more than ever - Ian Henschke, National Seniors Australia\n\nNoel Whittaker has a rare ability to translate complex matters into plain English. This book is a must read for anybody who is retired or planning for it. - Anthony Deceglie, Editor, Sunday Times"
