        "text": "He joined as a trainee Education Officer in Brisbane in 1983, progressing to roles in radio and TV around Australia and internationally, winning numerous local, national and international media awards.\n\nIan first worked in ABC Children’s/Education making radio and TV programs for schools before moving into TV Current affairs. He produced and reported for Behind the News, Landline, Countrywide, 7.30 Report, Four Corners, Australia Network, and Stateline before shifting to radio with 891 Mornings in 2011 and Drive in 2016.\n\nABC Adelaide Local Content Manager, Graeme Bennett said “Ian’s contribution to the ABC over the past 34 years has been significant. It’s certainly been a great career. Ian’s time at 891 ABC Adelaide, underpinned by his decades of newsgathering and story-telling experience has won the respect of our growing audience. I acknowledge and thank him for his role in keeping 891 a key part of so many people’s daily lives. On behalf of the whole station and the broader ABC I wish him all the best for the next stage of his life.”\n\nIan reflected “I started at the Film and TV School in the Sound Workshop in 1980 and had the privilege of being trained by ABC greats like Robert Peach, the founder of AM and PM, and legendary late night announcer Arch McKirdy.”\n\n“This training helped me get a job with what was then the Australian Broadcasting Commission. I went on to work in TV in many different areas before coming ‘home’ to radio again in 2011.”\n\n“I thank the ABC for a wonderful career. It began when we used film, audio tape and typewriters and finished in the era of silicon chips, satellites and smartphones. I’ve had a host of extraordinary opportunities, including working on an ABC/AusAid project in Cambodia, studying at Oxford, covering the 1997 Hong Kong Handover, reporting for Four Corners and BBC World, being a staff-elected Director on the ABC Board, hosting Stateline and of course being part of a number one radio station renowned for community engagement”, Ian said.\n\nHowever, retirement won’t be an idle time. “I’m looking forward to spending every school holidays with my young daughters. I’m also planning to write, return to teaching and do some advocacy work in the not-for-profit sector.”\n\nIan’s final day on 891 ABC Adelaide will be Friday 9 December. His replacement will be announced in early 2017.\n\nFor more information\n\nLaila Ferrier\n\nMarketing Coordinator - SA ABC Local Radio\n\nferrier.laila@abc.net.au"
