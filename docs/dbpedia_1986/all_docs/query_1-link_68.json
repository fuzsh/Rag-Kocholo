        "text": "Schiller, a regular reporter on the Network Ten’s “The Project”, panellist on Fox Sports and Triple M announcer, replaces Ian Henschke, who retired at the end of 2016.\n\nThe appointment indicates a move towards sport and humour in the key shift, although Schiller has broadened his scope in recent years to include reporting on major events for The Project.\n\nSchiller’s return to the Adelaide airwaves represents a departure from the past in more ways than one for the local ABC station.\n\nSchiller will only present Drive from Monday to Thursday, with Evenings presenter Peter Goers taking over the show on Fridays. A nationally syndicated show presented by singer Christine Anu will be broadcast locally in the Friday and Saturday evening shifts.\n\nAdelaide-born Schiller will continue to work on The Project and Fox Sports’ “Back Page” program.\n\nHe began his career in radio, including a long stint as a breakfast presenter on Nova in Adelaide, before expanding into television.\n\nABC Adelaide manager Graeme Bennett said Schiller would bring a “new approach” to the shift.\n\n“Our new Drive show will still have a strong news of the day focus but Jules’ background in humour and comedy will make the drive home as much fun as it is informative,” he said in a statement.\n\n“And like many South Australians, Jules is a bit of a sports nut. We’re really excited to bring something new to Adelaide radio.”\n\nSchiller also indicated his approach would be focused on entertainment.\n\n“I have more ideas for this show than the Britannia Roundabout has entry points and after seven years reporting current affairs for The Project, five years at Fox Sports and once co-hosting Cleo’s Bachelor of the Year Awards, I’m confident I have the right mix to entertain Adelaide on the drive home,” he said in a statement.\n\nThe ABC said Schiller would begin in the 4-6pm shift from early February."
