        "text": "About 44,000 older Australians will miss out on cost of living relief following a Coalition's amendment to a bill which would have substantially expanded access to the Commonwealth Seniors Health Card.\n\nThe Social Services and Other Legislation Amendment (Lifting the Income Limit for the Commonwealth Seniors Heath Card) Bill would have raised the income thresholds for seniors who could access to the card from $57,761 to $90,000 for singles and from $92,416 to $144,000 for couples (combined). This would make more people of age pension or veteran pension age eligible for medical and pharmaceutical concessions plus a range of other state and council concessions.\n\nMore than 44,000 newly eligible CSHC holders were expected to benefit within the first year of implementation and an additional 52,000 card holders would get access to the card by 2026-27.\n\nHowever, the Opposition tacked on an unrelated amendment to the bill in the Senate on Wednesday night preventing it from passing into law and requiring seniors to wait at least an additional month before it can come into effect.\n\nThe bill will have to go back to the House of Representatives but Parliament is currently not sitting and will not return until October 25, which is Budget week.\n\nThis will be the earliest opportunity for the government to attempt to pass the legislation again.\n\nThe Commonwealth Seniors Health Card allows older Australians ineligible for a Pension Concession Card to access cheaper medicines under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS), bulk-billed doctor visits (at the discretion of the provider) and the lower thresholds of the PBS and Extended Medicare safety nets. Some states and councils have concessions available to these card holders, including discounts on rates and licences.\n\nShe said it needed to explain to older people why it was blocking cost of living relief at a time when it was most needed.\n\n\"This delay will mean eligible older Australians will continue to have to pay more to get medicines and go to the doctor until the bill passes into law,\" Ms Rishworth said.\n\nThe work bonus is the amount an age pensioner can earn through paid work before their pension is reduced by 50 cents in the dollar.\n\nThe government has proposed legislation before the Lower House which would add a one-off temporary $4000 increase to a pensioner's current annual work bonus \"bank\", raising it from $7800 to $11,800 this year. This proposal was announced after the Jobs and Skills Summit.\n\nThe measure is designed to enable pensioners who want to work to immediately boost the supply of labour to help meet shortages.\n\nSeniors' advocacy group the Combined Pensioners and Superannuants Association said increasing the work bonus was mainly good for pensioners already on it, but it was doubtful other pensioners would take it up in great numbers.\n\n\"The temporary, trial nature of the increase in work bonus may be a barrier for pensioners interested in earning employment income, because the increase may well cease after June 30, 2023,\" said policy manager Paul Versteege. \"It's important to extend the trial to, say, June 30, 2024."
