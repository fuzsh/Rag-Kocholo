        "text": "Forbes based rural and lifestyle property specialists Johnston Rural Group are excited to bring to market Cramorie – a refined rural lifestyle holding in an idyllic location on the edge of historic Forbes – with access to the Lachlan River.\n\nCramorie is a special rural lifestyle package that enjoys a prime location just 3km southeast of the historic Forbes town centre in an accessible albeit private and secluded setting. The focal point of the property is undoubtedly the stylish 4 bedroom weatherboard homestead (c.1900’s) which has commanding views out towards the Lachlan River over its small farming and grazing paddocks.\n\nThe property comprises of approximately 5.357 hectares (13.23 acres) of gently undulating and highly productive river flats which occupy five separate land parcels. Cramorie not only provides a wonderful place to live but is also a functioning small agricultural asset with a strong catalogue of ancillary improvements including a large fully enclosed machinery / storage shed with mezzanine, horse stable complex, set of cattle yards, three bay carport, workshop, dog kennel and chook run.\n\nMarketing agent Sam Johnston stated that “Cramorie has already generated a significant amount of enquiry after being on the market for less than a week. Enquiry has come from a number of places including Forbes and its surrounding towns, Sydney, Melbourne, the South Coast and Central Tablelands.”\n\nHe then went on to say that “Given Forbes’ recently reported population growth projections and emerging business opportunities within the shire, it is clear that Forbes is now being seen as a ‘go to area’ with investment upside on the horizon.”\n\nCramorie is being offered for sale by Expressions of Interest (EOI) with expressions closing at 12 noon AEST Thursday 15th June 2023. A detailed information memorandum and price guide are available on request with inspections by appointment only.\n\nShow your love and appreciation for your mother and support a local initiative to raise funds for a charity.\n\nParkes resident Marion Unger will be selling flowers from her garden on the front lawn of the Lutheran Church in Currajong Street (opposite Parkes Public School) from 8:30am tomorrow, Saturday 13th May. Her bunches start from $5 for the smallest size. The bunches of chrysanthemums, the traditional Mother’s Day flower, come mostly from Marion’s garden. She will be donating the money to a children’s ministry in Cambodia. She has attached a small card with information about the ministry to every bunch. Contact Marion on 0447 165 229 for more information.\n\nAustralia’s largest provider network, UnitingCare Australia has welcomed the Albanese Government’s announcement to give more than 250,000 aged care workers a much needed pay rise.\n\n“Older people and their families, workers providing care, and the families who rely on those workers. This overdue pay rise will go a long way toward dealing with the cost-of-living crisis the lowest paid workers are currently facing,” said UnitingCare Australia National Director, Claerwen Little.\n\n“We know that investing in our aged care workforce is essential for the well-being of older Australians. This increase will help attract and retain skilled workers and we reaffirm our pledge to pass on this additional funding to staff.\n\n“UnitingCare Australia was the first national aged care body to publicly support a 25% pay rise for workers in March 2022. We boldly costed the ask and put our support behind our workforce.\n\n“Millions of Australians depend on the care sector every day to provide vital services that support individuals and communities to thrive. As the largest and fastest growing employer in the country, the opportunity for the care sector to be transformational for Australia’s future is boldly evident. We have an historic opportunity to advance gender equality through a strengthened care workforce,” said Ms Little.\n\nParkes and Forbes Shire Councils are ensuring that children are safe and secure when travelling in vehicles with free child restraint checks by Authorised Child Restraint Fitters in Parkes on Friday 12 May 2023 and Forbes on Saturday 13th May.\n\nThe Councils’ Road Safety and Injury Prevention Officer, Melanie Suitor, says that these free child restraint checking days will now be held bi-annually as they are usually well patronised and are important in ensuring the safe travel of young children.\n\n“Due to the success of previous events, we’ve received funding to offer this service twice a year to residents in Parkes and Forbes – one round of checking days will be held in late November/early December and the other round will be in April/May,” Ms Suitor said.\n\nThe upcoming child restraint checking days will be held in Parkes on Friday 12 May from 11am – 3pm in the carpark at Kelly Reserve and in Forbes on Saturday 13 May from 10am – 2pm in the Bunnings carpark.\n\nThe correct fitting and adjustment of child restraints is vital. Research shows that two out of three child restraints are not being used properly and this puts children at risk of injury in the event of a crash.\n\n“Most of the restraints we have checked at previous events have had minor problems that needed fixing to ensure the safety of the child – such as tightening and untwisting straps, fitting gated buckles and correcting the seatbelt’s path through the restraint.\n\n“It is important to have your child restraint checked regularly after prolonged use and installed correctly before use to ensure that your precious cargo is safe,” Ms Suitor said.\n\nBookings are essential – phone 6861 2364 to secure your place. Information about the child restraint laws, the types of restraints and advice on moving children from one restraint type to the next will also be available.\n\nCentral West Libraries has announced the chosen book for this year’s One Library One Book community read.\n\nDianne Yarwood’s bestselling novel The Wakes has been chosen for the innovative program in the Central West that takes the traditional book club concept to the next level.

It is already making a name for itself as a bestseller and will be filmed for TV, ” she said.\n\nThe Service NSW Business Connect program, which provides small businesses with free, tailored business advice from independent advisors who have experience running their own business, is supporting the City of Sydney’s Reboot webinar series to help small businesses and people across NSW looking to learn, innovate and grow a business.\n\nLeaders from some of Australia’s most successful companies will share their inspiring stories, valuable insights and practical tips across a range of business topics in free, weekly webinars from 2–30 May.\n\nThe free webinars will include The Man Cave and STUFF CEO Hunter Johnson on setting up a purpose-driven business and Snuggle Honey CEO Julie Mathers and Birdsnest founder Jane Cay on the secrets to rapid online growth.

Repeat with the butter and fritter mixture.\n\n3. Serve fritters with avocado, bacon, cherry tomatoes, rocket and sweet chilli sauce.\n\nINGREDIENTS\n\nCrust Ingredients\n\n1½ cups roughly chopped dates\n\n½ cup roughly chopped almonds/cashews\n\n½ cup shredded coconut\n\n½ tsp vanilla essence (optional)\n\n2 tbsp melted coconut oil\n\n4 drops Young Living’s Lemon essential oil\n\nCheesecake Filling Ingredients\n\n2 cups raw soaked cashews\n\n½ cup coconut milk\n\n½ cup maple syrup or honey (to taste)\n\n2 tbsp fresh lemon juice\n\n1/3 cup melted coconut oil\n\n1 tsp vanilla essence\n\n4 – 6 drops Young Living’s Lemon essential oil (to taste)\n\n1 cup sliced strawberries\n\nStrawberries for decorating (optional)\n\nInstructions\n\n1.
