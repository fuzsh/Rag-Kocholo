        "text": "Nearly 50,000 people attended a game of domestic cricket at Adelaide Oval this week, and many of them happily waved placards including the logo of a breakfast cereal, or wore empty fried-chicken buckets on their heads.\n\nA new Jeep was given away between innings, and the electronic hoardings flashed up a passing parade of big-ticket sponsors.\n\nBut the clincher – why the SACA knows it really isn’t in Kansas any more – was the television ratings for the BBL T20 match between the Adelaide Strikers and the Hobart Hurricanes.\n\nSome 167,000 Adelaide people tuned in to the second session of the round robin match. In the modern media world, that’s a huge number.\n\nTo put that into sharper perspective, about 237,000 Adelaideans tuned into the Crows’ stunning elimination victory over the Western Bulldogs last September.\n\nThe top-rating program in Adelaide last year – the AFL Grand Final – garnered 296,000 local viewers, and the Cricket World Cup final pulled in 223,000.\n\nThe national team’s first one-day international against India on Tuesday drew only 118,000 Adelaide viewers to Nine’s coverage of the prime-time second session.\n\nIn Melbourne, one of that sports-mad city’s two Big Bash franchises – the Stars – was left without a major sponsor after retailer Dick Smith went under. They signed up telecommunications company Optus to a long-term sponsorship deal within 24 hours.\n\nHowever…\n\nNetwork Ten has been replaying the exciting last over of the Strikers’ innings again and again after a technical stuff-up all but destroyed viewers’ enjoyment of the match.\n\nAs the match was in the balance, the coverage suddenly switched to a shopping channel – an infomercial for a massage chair.\n\nIt’s obviously a technical trap for all the networks in the era of multiple digital channels.\n\nA few weeks ago, a documentary on Seven Mate about NFL legend Joe Namath and his Superbowl-winning New York Jets switched halfway through to coverage of tennis, without explanation.\n\nRadio holidays over\n\nThe first radio ratings survey period of the year begins next week and regular presenters – and some newbies – are returning from holidays on Monday. The summer fill-ins will go back to their day jobs.\n\nABC 891’s new line-up will begin on Monday, with Ali Clarke taking the morning shift, replacing Ian Henschke, who moves to drive.\n\nAlso returning to his desk next week is the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Adelaide, Professor Warren Bebbington.\n\nHe has promised to make an announcement this month on the future of the university-run community station Radio Adelaide, including new ownership.\n\nBeware the stock market\n\nStock photos are occasionally a necessary evil for news websites, when footage or imagery of an event isn’t available.\n\nBut editors can look like fools – or worse – when something goes wrong.\n\nSBS hosted a story from India’s NDTV on its site this week which provides an appalling example.\n\nThe story was the almost unimaginable tragedy of the Adelaide family of six who died after a road crash in India.\n\nWhile it originated in India, SBS should have removed it. The image is stock – from Wikipedia, no less.\n\nNaughty corner\n\nActor Sean Penn’s adventure into amateur journalism was a mixed bag.\n\nHis first achievement was enormous – gaining an exclusive interview with the Mexican drug kingpin Joaquin “El Chapo” Guzman.\n\nHowever, he fell at the next hurdle – conducting a sensible interview and writing a sensible article.\n\nHis self-important 10,000-word piece for Rolling Stone has a stream-of-consciousness style reminiscent of bad poetry.\n\nSo, in the tradition of Make the Pie Higher, Media Week has constructed a free-verse poem from phrases and sentences in the article. We hope you enjoy Everything I say to everyone must be true.\n\nEverything I say to everyone must be true\n\nThe look in his eye is far away, but locked dead on me.\n\nMy speculation goes audio. I hear chain saws. I feel splatter.\n\nAnother day’s fight is lost.\n\nDick in hand I do consider it among my body parts vulnerable\n\n… and take a fond last look.\n\nThere is no doubt this is the real deal.\n\nWhat is it that removes all doubt from a man’s eyes?\n\nIs it power?\n\nNods follow. I move. And, when I do…there he is.\n\n(At this moment, I expel a minor traveller’s flatulence –\n\nwe escape its subtle brume.)\n\nTwo bouncing birds side by side\n\nthrough the thermals\n\nover the mountainous jungle.\n\nEspinoza is the owl who flies among falcons.\n\nIt seemed such a strange dream.\n\nDo you have any dreams? Do you dream?\n\nWhere are you dying tonight?\n\nTop of the class\n\nSouth Australia-raised and educated journalist Helen McCabe this week quit her post as editor-in-chief of the Australian Women’s Weekly after six years in charge of the venerable magazine.\n\nShe deserves accolades for bringing strong news values to the Weekly, including scoops such as last year’s interview with disgraced “wellness” blogger Belle Gibson. McCabe has also kept circulation losses to a minimum – at least compared to other glossy mags – and successfully established a digital presence for the Weekly.\n\nMedia Week is published on Fridays."
