        "text": "And now to the ABC, which is grappling uneasily with this problem: if their guests aren't politicians, but do have political affiliations, should they be declared? For example...\n\nVirginia Trioli: Let's take a look at today's papers, we're joined now by Liberty Sanger a partner at Maurice Blackburn lawyers. Liberty good morning\n\nLiberty Sanger: Hello\n\n— ABC News Breakfast, 10th April, 2013\n\nLiberty Sanger is one of the regular reviewers of the morning's papers on ABC News Breakfast. That particular day a month ago, she dealt with the PM's visit to China...\n\nLiberty Sanger: We now absolutely see a Prime Minister who is very comfortable on the international stage where once we might have thought there was some hesitation about her foreign affairs credentials.\n\n— ABC News Breakfast, 10th April, 2013\n\nAnd the Coalition's new broadband policy...\n\nLiberty Sanger: It won't be as fast, for everybody, if you want the very fast speeds you'll be paying for that yourself...\n\n— ABC News Breakfast, 10th April, 2013\n\nMost of what Ms Sanger had to say was clearly supportive of the Gillard government. At the end of the segment, Virginia Trioli said this...\n\nVirginia Trioli: Now someone on Twitter has asked that we please disclose Liberty Sanger's Labor connection when you present your opinions. We have done so before and I'm happy to do so again.\n\nLiberty Sanger: Yes I am a member of the Labor Party and I am married to Senator David Feeney.\n\n— ABC News Breakfast, 10th April, 2013\n\nThat's the David Feeney who is a factional leader in the Victorian ALP, and was a major player in the ousting of Kevin Rudd.\n\nShortly afterwards, another viewer tweeted...\n\n(Robert Atkinson) Every guest now needs to disclose their political leanings!\n\n— Twitter, 10th April, 2013\n\nTo which Virginia Trioli responded...\n\n(Virgina Trioli) If they are party members, yes they do. We always have.\n\n— Twitter, 10th April, 2013\n\nWell, no, they always hadn't. For example, in March...\n\nBeverley O'Connor: Well for a look at today's newspapers we're joined by Liberty Sanger a partner at Maurice Blackburn lawyers, and she's with us in the studio, lovely to see you Liberty.\n\nLiberty Sanger: Good morning ...\n\n— ABC News Breakfast, 6th March, 2013\n\nNo mention of Labor party membership in that segment. And even after Virginia's tweet...\n\nVirginia Trioli: Let's take a look the Monday papers, we're joined now by Mohammed El-Leissy a cultural youth worker at the Islamic Council of Victoria, Mohammed good morning...\n\nMohammed El-Leissy: Good morning.\n\n— ABC News Breakfast, 15th April, 2013\n\nNo questions about party membership there either.\n\nBut soon after that, things changed. Perhaps because a formal complaint was made to the ABC about Ms Sanger's affiliations not being declared. Audience and Consumer Affairs responded to the complainant on April the 19th...\n\nMs Sanger's political affiliations are relevant and should be disclosed ... the program accepts that a clearer disclosure at the beginning of the segment should be made in the future.\n\n— Mark Maley, ABC Audience and Consumer Affairs, 19th April, 2013\n\nAnd for a while, News Breakfast was punctilious...\n\nVirginia Trioli: For a look at today's papers we're joined by Liberty Sanger, a partner at Maurice Blackburn lawyers and as we established a couple of weeks ... well no several weeks ago when we asked her, a member of the Labor party. Good Morning Liberty, how are you?\n\nLiberty Sanger: Good Morning, I'm well thanks.\n\nMichael Rowland: Good Morning\n\n— ABC News Breakfast, 1st May, 2013\n\nVirginia Trioli: It's nice to have you on board, can I ask you, are you a member of a political party?\n\nMohammed El-Leissy: Yes the Liberals.\n\nVirginia Trioli: Excellent, thank you for that.\n\n— ABC News Breakfast, 29th April, 2013\n\nTalkback radio is a bit trickier. You never know who's calling in. For instance, on ABC 891 in Adelaide a few weeks back, morning host Ian Henschke took this call from someone he introduced as...\n\nIan Henschke: ... a mother, and a concerned mother, Ruth Beach is her name, she's a lawyer ...\n\n— ABC Radio 891, Mornings with Ian Henschke, 7th March, 2013\n\nRuth Beach was concerned about a number of incidents of indecent behaviour that children had witnessed, or been victims of, on buses on their way to school.\n\nRuth Beach: ... and my view is these children have a right to be safe ...\n\n— ABC Radio 891, Mornings with Ian Henschke, 7th March, 2013\n\nAnd fair enough. The issue got plenty of traffic.\n\nIan Henschke: We're talking to Ruth, worried mother, about her teenage girl. Damien Mills is the candidate for Kingston in the upcoming elections. Is it state or federal candidate, Damien?\n\nDamien Mills: No federal, Ian. Good morning.\n\nIan Henschke: Good morning, Damien.\n\n— ABC Radio 891, Mornings with Ian Henschke, 7th March, 2013\n\nDamien Mills had a brief say; Ruth Beach had almost ten minutes. But it was only right at the end of that chat that Ms Beach told Ian Henschke this...\n\nIan Henschke: ... clearly you've struck a real chord with our listeners, Ruth.\n\nRuth Beach: Yeah, look I should say as well Ian, I'm the Greens candidate for Adelaide. It was interesting you had another candidate call in ...\n\nIan Henschke: Thanks for declaring your interest, I didn't realise that when you contacted us ...\n\n— ABC Radio 891, Mornings with Ian Henschke, 7th March, 2013\n\nBut if Ms Beach had declared her candidacy when she called in, would Ian Henschke have given her so much time?\n\nIf, just three days earlier, the ABC's Q&amp;A program had known that James Harrison of Toorak was not just a Greens member, but the Greens candidate for the Federal seat of\n\nHiggins, would they have played his long video question to Julie Bishop about climate change?\n\nJames Harrison: Your leader, Tony Abbott, has continually questioned the validity of credible scientists from around the world...\n\n— ABC1, Q&amp;A, 4th March, 2013\n\nMaybe not. Here's someone called Paula phoning in to Ray Hadley on Sydney's 2GB in support of a Labor candidate for Federal parliament...\n\nPaula: I'm a, been a member of the ALP for about fifteen years now, and I'm actually the junior Vice President of the Hinchinbrook branch ...\n\nRay Hadley: Well you see the problem, seeing you declared all that Paula, if I allow you to continue unabated here as a member of the ALP for whatever length of time I give you I'll be obliged to then afford the same luxury to someone from the opposition to come on and ...\n\nPaula: Oh that's fair enough ...\n\nRay Hadley: Yeah well it's not really because ...\n\nthat's not really exciting radio, Paula, having members of the ALP or members of the Coalition or the Liberal Party on for long periods of time telling us about their given candidates in seats across any part of Australia, let alone in Western Sydney or South-Western Sydney.\n\nRay Hadley: Hello?\n\nPaula: All right.\n\nRay Hadley: OK?\n\nPaula: OK.\n\nRay Hadley: All right.\n\n— Radio 2GB, The Ray Hadley Morning Show, 26th March, 2013\n\nAnd that was that. You can understand Ray not wanting to get embroiled in a political tit for tat. But it'd be sad if the few people who are sufficiently engaged to join a political party, and sufficiently up front to say so, find themselves kept off the airwaves as a result.\n\nBack on News Breakfast, the new rule is slipping. Three weeks ago, Virginia Trioli was sticking firmly to it...\n\nVirginia Trioli: First of all, we're asking everyone, in this election year, are you a member of a political party?\n\nTim Wilson: Yes.\n\nVirginia Trioli: Which one?\n\nTim Wilson: I'm a member of the Liberal party.\n\nVirginia Trioli: Excellent\n\nTim Wilson: That's on the public record already.\n\n(No, no)\n\n— ABC News 24, 24th April, 2013\n\nBut then, just last week...\n\nVirginia Trioli: Let's take a look at today's papers. We're joined by Tim Wilson from the Institute of Public Affairs, Tim, good morning...\n\n— ABC News 24, 8th May, 2013\n\nWhoops, no party affiliation question. Personally, I'd much rather know who funds the Institute of Public Affairs. But that's another story."
