        "text": "ABC Stateline\n\nKeogh - Rejection of the Petition 11 August 2006\n\nThis version of the transcript has been edited by Dr Robert N Moles\n\nPresenter: Ian Henschke\n\nPatrick Emmett, producer and interviewer\n\nAlexis Keogh, Henry Keogh's Daughter\n\nKevin Foley, Acting Attorney-General\n\nKevin Borick QC\n\nIan Henschke\n\nYesterday, Henry Keogh's third petition for mercy was refused. He's now served 12 years of his 25-year sentence. During that time his family and a number of key legal figures have given him unfailing support. His mother died last year but his daughter has vowed to continue the fight. Patrick Emmett has the story.\n\nAlexis Keogh\n\nI remember the first visit to Yatala [prison]. That hit home. That's when I realised what was going on. I don't know how to describe how it felt. As a nine-year-old seeing dad like that, it's just taken his manhood away and his dignity away and everything. And to have all your friends and everything believing that you're a murderer's daughter is really hard to deal with, I guess.\n\nPatrick Emmett\n\nIt was 12 years ago when Alexis Keogh saw her father sent to gaol for 25 years after one of South Australia's most controversial murder trials. Henry Keogh, a financial adviser, was found guilty of drowning his fiancée Anna-Jane Cheney as she took a bath. The Crown said the motive was five insurance policies worth over a million dollars which he had forged her signature on. But while the years have passed, the controversy hasn't. The campaign to free him, led by leading legal identities, has continued unabated. Yesterday, their third petition for mercy was refused.\n\nKevin Foley\n\nThe people of South Australia can be comforted in the knowledge that a two-and-a-half year exhaustive examination by the Solicitor-General, one of the most senior legal officers of this State, has concluded that there is no doubt in his mind as to the guilt of Henry Keogh. The overwhelming body of evidence showed very clearly that Mr Henry Keogh is guilty of a terrible, terrible crime; and I just appeal to those that, for whatever motivation, for whatever reason, continue to put the family of Anna-Jane Cheney through so much torment. Please end their nightmare and let's allow her family to get on with their lives.\n\nAlexis Keogh\n\nI heard on the news Kevin Foley saying to accept his guilt. There's no guilt there to accept. And we're not giving up, so the fight's not over.\n\nPatrick Emmett\n\nAt 21, Alexis Keogh works as a builder's labourer and pursues her love of drawing; but her love for her father is still one of the strongest parts of her life. She and her sisters and the rest of her family still fervently believe he's innocent.\n\nAlexis Keogh\n\nAs times goes by people think it would get easier but it actually doesn't because the older you get, the more things happen that you wish dad was around for. Like, my sister got married last year. You'd want your father to walk you down the aisle but obviously he couldn't be there.\n\nPatrick Emmett\n\nThe Keogh legal team says it's not surprised by yesterday's decision.\n\nKevin Borick QC\n\nIt was not unexpected but it's extraordinary that it took four years to come out and say that there was nothing wrong with what happened at the trial.\n\nPatrick Emmett\n\nIt seems pretty damning of your case on behalf of Henry Keogh. What's your response to that?\n\nKevin Borick QC\n\nWell, we don't see it as damning at all. It sets out some of the facts but it doesn't tell the whole story by any means.\n\nPatrick Emmett\n\nWhat the Keogh legal team have strenuously argued is that forensic evidence at his trial that he grabbed his fiancée by her leg to drown her was badly flawed. But yesterday the State Government said that while some of that evidence might be open to criticism, it was only part of the case.\n\nKevin Foley\n\nIt is important to understand that the case against Mr Keogh was never dependent on the pathology evidence alone. For example, in his address to the jury the prosecutor, Paul Rofe QC, said and I quote \"If this was just pathology evidence then Keogh should be acquitted\".\n\nKevin Borick QC\n\nWithout the forensic evidence, the pathology evidence, there's no possible way you could get a conviction, and the pathology evidence was totally and hopelessly flawed.\n\nPatrick Emmett\n\nTo support the government's case, Kevin Foley says Anna Jane Cheney had 15 bruises on her body at the time she died. He said there was evidence Henry Keogh had cheated on his fiancée with two women.\n\nKevin Foley\n\nThe combined weight of the circumstances is more than enough to prove Mr Keogh's guilt. Moreover, the lies told by Mr Keogh to several people, including Ms Cheney's father and the police, shortly after her death can be viewed as an attempt to conceal the full value of the insurance he had taken out on her life.\n\nPatrick Emmett\n\nThey also say that your case ignores the weight of circumstantial evidence in this case. What's your response to that?\n\nKevin Borick QC\n\nWe do not ignore the weight of circumstantial evidence. We know about the, obviously know about the insurance policies, and there's a lot of background to them. Anna-Jane Cheney did know of their existence and of course some of them had been cashed in.\n\nPatrick Emmett\n\nWhat was the reason for those insurance policies?\n\nKevin Borick QC\n\nHe was setting up an insurance business and it was common for people in business to write policies for members of the family. It's common that people sign their partner's documents from time to time.\n\nPatrick Emmett\n\nDespite the government's pleas to stop, the Keogh legal team says this isn't the end. They'll still pursue appeals through the courts, but they believe the South Australian legal system will struggle to judge itself and it needs outside intervention.\n\nAlexis Keogh\n\nI'm confused as to how they can honestly come to this decision. Being a daughter or not, looking at this outside of the fact that I'm his daughter, I can see how obvious it is there's mistakes that have been made. And I think there needs to be an independent review of it, someone outside of the State who isn't involved, who doesn't perhaps know anything about it at all.\n\nKevin Borick QC\n\nWithout doubt, if the situation occurred in the United Kingdom where they have the Criminal Cases Review Commission, there's no possible way that this conviction would stand up.\n\nPatrick Emmett\n\nA lot of people believe your dad is guilty.\n\nAlexis Keogh\n\nI know my dad is not capable of doing that. I've never doubted it and, no matter what a jury decides, I still will never doubt it. So I'll keep fighting for him just like the rest of my family has. If someone is innocent you just, unlike - you just don't give up.\n\nIan Henschke\n\nAnd the Cheney family has declined interviews and asked that the media respect their privacy.\n\nTop of Page\n\nThe materials on this site are the copyright of Networked Knowledge.
