        "text": "Dominique Bayens | Hardly a week goes by where we don’t read or hear a story about how tough many people are finding the going at the moment. Some of you can expect to see a few more dollars in your pocket, though, with a rise in the pension taking effect from today. Now, how much that helps you battle the rising cost of inflation is a whole other question. Singles who get the aged pension, disability support, pension and carer payment will get an extra $37.50 a fortnight, taking the pension to $1,064 for couples. It will go up by 56.40 cents a fortnight to 1600 $4. There may also have been some changes to the single jobseeker payment and ABS study. If you are on the aged pension though, I’d like to hear from you. How adequate is it right now? Can you make ends meet given the current living pressures? 1305 40 5222? Let’s hear from Ian Henschke, who is the chief advocate for National Seniors Australia. Ian good morning.\n\nIan Henschke | To you to Dom. Yes, those figures you’ve given are the amount it’s increased by, but they roughly now you’re talking about 27,000 for a single and about 14,000 for a couple because it’s hard to keep up with it because the inflation rate over the last year has been almost touching 8%, so there’s been a 4% increase, which is basically to make up for what you’ve lost in purchasing power over the last six months and what National Seniors is asking the Government to do is adjust the pension quarterly, in other words, every three months instead of every six months when inflation is running away. And I mean, I don’t want to give you a math lesson too early in the morning, but if you’ve got an inflation rate of 8%, $100 will only buy you $92 worth of goods, if you see what I mean. That’s how it works. So that’s why people, when they go to the supermarket or they, you know, have a bill that’s gone up, they say, gosh, you know, I’m spending a lot more this year and I’ve got a lot less coming in. But the pension is adjusted for cost of living. So this is this adjustment is not a boost to the pension. It’s simply adjusting for cost of living. And of course, the other thing that I say to people who are struggling is make sure that you’ve got your concessions and make sure you know what concessions are available to you, because a lot of people, they get to pension age or they’ve just starting out, you know, in that area and they go, Oh, I didn’t realise I was eligible for this or I was eligible for that. So we’ve got a thing called the National Seniors Concessions Calculator. You can go there and find out what’s available. So a senior, for example, who’s 67 in WA I think the age levels there, they can get some concessions. A pensioner gets state concessions in addition to the Federal Government pension. And you’ve also got a concession for what they call a Commonwealth Seniors Health Card holder. So you really have to sort of sit down and study what you’re eligible for. But I’ll give you some good news, Dom. Guess what? Western Australia is the place to live. So the reason I say that is because I’m talking to you from South Australia and a pensioner getting state concessions in South Australia gets a bit over a thousand. The pensioner in Western Australia gets over 1700 dollars in state concessions. So you’re getting that in addition to the pension from the State Government So the State government in WA would be the most generous in Australia in terms of providing concessions. So make sure you’re getting those in addition to your pension.\n\nDominique Bayens | You say that we’re the most generous in Australia at the moment, but can you paint a picture of how tough those on a pension are doing it right now with the cost of living just seeming to go up by the week?\n\nIan Henschke | They are doing it tough, but this is one of the difficult things in Australia because you’ve got some people who are doing okay, some people who are doing quite well and some people are doing very poorly and the people that are doing it the toughest are those that don’t own their own home. See, the real problem with the pension system in Australia is that really expects you to own your own home. If you are paying rent, then that’s where you really do find it extremely difficult. Now a survey was done a few years ago. It was called fixed pension poverty. We actually were part of that National seniors and we recommend it to the government that there be an independent body. Look at the adequacy of the pension in Australia to try and pick up those 20% of people who are living in poverty on the pension. And there and we found that they almost directly correlated with those people that don’t own their own home. I know there are costs in owning your own home and people ring up and say, Well, I’ve got to pay the rates in, etc. but you do get some concessions, as I said, state government concessions for rates and sewerage and water. But if you are in the rental market, can you imagine what it’s like if you’re paying? Let’s just say $300 a week for a one bedroom flat? Well, if you’re pensioners 26, $27,000, you’re almost paying half the amount in rent and then you get a small rent subsidy from the government, which is called a rent allowance. But it’s not enough to cover the rents. I mean, I’ve heard of people who were paying $240 a week for a one bedroom and they’ve gone up to 360 in a year. Now you can’t cope with that. And a lot of places I mean, you’re talking from a beautiful part of the world. There a lot of those places that people like to go on holidays. They’re now having things like Airbnbs and so it’s rental The rental market is becoming very well. It’s very high demand and people are paying so much money in rent that they haven’t got enough left that left over. So that’s the people that are really struggling.\n\nDominique Bayens | Ian Henschke My guest on ABC South Western great Southern chief advocate for National Seniors Australia. If you’re on the aged pension, I’d love to hear from you today. How adequate is it and are you able to make ends meet at the moment given the current living pressures? 044892604. This text says they won’t even allow pensioners to earn more than a lousy $90 a fortnight, $45 a week, $1 over that, and they take it out of their pension. This isn’t a handout, it’s earnings. Now that’s something that you advocate for. Is that right, Ian?\n\nIan Henschke | Yeah. Well, that’s not strictly correct. That would be the amount that you get. I’d have to go back and have a look at that figure, but it doesn’t sound right. I think that’s the amount you get if you talk about earning. But if you want to work, for example, when people say that they’d like to go out and do a bit of work and often because there are 400,000 job vacancies in Australia at the moment, often people are being asked to work and sometimes when they get to retirement age, the employers are even saying, look, could you stay on for another year or two because we’re really desperate. Now if that person goes and works, they the government has a system called a pension work bonus where you’re allowed to earn $7,800 before it starts to affect your pension. They made an increase last year because we asked them to change the system, but all they did was give an extra $4,000 in bonus, which brings it to 12, almost 12,000. So really, you’re talking about $1,000 a month. Break that down to a week. That’s $250 If you do $30 an hour, if you’re working and sometimes on weekends, you’d get more than that. You’re basically talking about one day a week. So the problem at the moment is that anybody who’s struggling and goes out and gets a job and goes and helps the community by working after they do that one day, then they lose $0.50 off their pension and they pay income tax as well. So you’ve got this problem where you’re getting a double whammy. So what we’re saying to Jim Chalmers, the Treasurer and the upcoming budget and this time we’ve gone into him with a modelling economic modelling done by Deloitte’s, the top agency that the Government and others use. And we’ve said, can you model this? And they’ve modelled it and they’ve said that if you have twice the number of pensioners working that we’ve got at the moment, the Government’s actually going to make money, out of income tax and this is a government that desperately needs money. Why wouldn’t you say at this point in time in our history where we’ve got 400,000 job vacancies, if you’re a pensioner and you want to keep working, just pay income tax. Now you may set the rate slightly higher. You may want to make an adjustment or for whatever reason, but just let them work. So that they get the community benefits. It’s a win for the pensioner, it’s a win for the Government and it’s a win for the economy. Now we have to do this, so anyone out there who supports that idea, write to Jim Chalmers. Now Jim Chalmers, Parliament House, Canberra you know, send a letter. But when they, turn up in his office because I’m actually going to Canberra on Thursday this week and I am going to be saying that in, the run up to the budget, let these pensioners who are struggling, who don’t have a lot of income and assets and they want to go out and work, make them work let them work.\n\nDominique Bayens | And we’ll have to leave it there. Thank you so much for coming on."
