The policy prescriptions include raising the pension age again, delaying when superannuation can be accessed, allowing people to work more hours without losing the aged pension, increasing training programs for older workers, and pushing for an end to age discrimination in the workforce.\n\nRead More\n\nOlder workers to be encouraged back into the workforce\n\nOne of the key messages from Treasury’s Intergenerational Report, released yesterday, is that Australia will have a dwindling pool of workers over the next 40 years as the population’s average age increases.

And advocates say it’s time to get rid of the bureaucratic redtape.\n\nRead More\n\nAgeing population sparks calls to cut senior workforce tax barriers\n\nWith the Australian population set to age, the Institute of Public Affairs (IPA) says the government needs to “remove unfair tax and red tape barriers stopping Australian pensioners, veterans, and students who want to work.” Research Fellow at the IPA Saxon Davidson told Oliver Peterson on Perth Live that Australia needs to emulate New Zealand where pensioners are not punished for working, “Leading surveys show that twenty per cent of pensioners would rejoin the workforce if these unfair barriers were removed.”\n\nRead More\n\nLet Pensioners Work\n\n“Age-old problem needs future-proofing” is missing an important component in the worker shortage debate, the harsh treatment by the Federal Government of aged Australians and other pensioners who would otherwise like to continue working.Let’s look after our own better and remove the incomes test.

IPA research, and the federal government’s own figures, show Australia faces a housing shortage of more than 252,000 houses over the next five years and the nation’s worker shortage remains at record highs. A key driver on the current pressure on Australia’s housing market is the federal government’s unplanned increase to the migration and international student intake, which has pushed rental prices to record highs and absorbed new housing stock.\n\nRead More\n\nLabor’s punitive plan to further regulate the casual economy will exacerbate Australia’s $32 billion worker shortage crisis\n\nA plan that could remove our right to be casual workers if we have a “regular pattern of work” will only make it harder for Australians trying to enter the workforce, writes Saxon Davidson.\n\nRead More\n\nWorker shortages hit WA\n\n“Job number one for Premier Cook is to fix Western Australia’s worst-in-the-nation worker shortage levels, which is stifling business performance and punishing customers,” Mr Davidson said. “We are calling on Premier Cook to lead the charge in National Cabinet to have discriminatory tax and red tape barriers that are preventing our pensioners, veterans, and students removed to alleviate this crisis and he deserves bipartisan support,” said Mr Davidson. “Removing unfair barriers on pensioners, veterans, and students is a no-regrets policy which will get more Australians who want to into work, more money into local economies, while increasing tax revenue, and providing a critical source of dignity and self-esteem to our most experienced Australians,” said Mr Davidson.\n\nRead More\n\nIan Henschke speaks to the incredible value of employing Senior Australians | 6PR\n\nWe’re going to keep pushing the government to bring in this policy that we’ve been fighting for the last couple of years, which is let the pensioners work and simply pay income tax. In other words, just a fair rate of taxation, which is what they have in New Zealand, where they have many, more people in the workforce than we’ve got here. And we really should be following the same example as New Zealand. And I think we can do it and I know that there’d be plenty of listeners out there who say, Look, I’ve worked all my life, I want to retire. That’s fine, for you.

If you’re a pensioner and you earn $226 a week, which is only about one and a half days of work a week, you then start to lose 50 cents in the dollar on your welfare payments.

This is not because pensioners in Australia do not want to work. Research has shown that around one in five want to work, but do not, because of unfair tax and red tape barriers.The solution is to follow New Zealand’s approach by removing all red tape on pensioners, students, and veterans. This would mean that these Australians could earn as much income as they would want, without losing their pension payments or welfare benefits. Of course, they would still pay income tax like every other Australian worker. Removing all red-tape and barriers for Australian pensioners, veterans, and students to get back into the workforce, without suffering significant financial penalties, is a simple and effective policy measure that is good for them and good for our nation. More Australians working means higher government revenue through income tax, GST, and payroll tax, which can be reinvested into infrastructure and used to pay down our debt.\n\nRead More\n\nGeoff is 79. He had to come out of retirement to support his family by mowing lawns\n\nMr Campbell says all of his family’s expenses have increased significantly, including food, fuel and power. But he emphasised that he loves keeping active through rewarding work and said his business, which has recently grown to eight employees, is now booked out several months in advance. National Seniors Australia CEO Ian Henschke told SBS News the number of older Australians “severely” impacted by rising living costs is expected to rise over the next 12 months. “We have a very complicated social security system in Australia, which means that if you do work, you actually get penalised for working if you’re on a pension, beyond a certain amount.”\n\nRead More\n\nCost of living crisis forces thousands of pensioners back to workforce\n\nRetired Australians are returning to the workforce as the cost of living crisis makes it harder for older people to live off the pension. Over 3700 retired teachers returned to New South Wales classrooms in the last 12 months, and thousands more are looking for jobs, with one in five pensioners wanting to work more. However, older people risk losing their pension if they make over $11,800 of income a year, an amount advocacy groups say isn’t enough to live off of.” The vast majority of people who go back to work do so because they need the money,” the Chief Advocate at National Seniors Australia, Ian Henschke, said. “ We should take a leaf out of New Zealand’s book and simply let people on a pension work and pay income tax.”\n\nRead More\n\nOlder Australians hit hard by cost of living crisis\n\nThe results showed 90 per cent of respondents were concerned about keeping up with rise of living costs, while 25 per cent were “extremely concerned”. “If you’re an older person renting or on a low income, you’re more likely to be hit hard by rising living costs,” National Seniors Australia chief advocate Ian Henschke said “The age pension is adjusted twice a year in March and September. Rather than have pensioners wait six months, government should increase payments quarterly when inflation is high,” Henschke said. “Another key measure would be to exempt work income from the income test for all government payments, so recipients can work more without penalty.”\n\nRead More\n\nNational Seniors call for cost-of-living relief in budget submission\n\nNational Seniors Australia is calling on the Federal Government to address rising living costs in the Federal Budget, by indexing the pension more often and letting pensioners work without penalty. Chief Advocate, Ian Henschke said the budget was an opportunity for the government to index the Age Pension more frequently during times of high inflation. With more than 400,000 job vacancies it should also let pensioners and other government payment recipients work more without penalty, he said. “Older Australians are an integral part of the economy, but with high inflation, uncertain markets and cost of living pressures, government would do well to boost seniors’ confidence,” Mr Henschke said.\n\nRead More\n\nRetirees asked to help fill labour shortages in Warrnambool as council tries new approach\n\nNational Seniors Australia chief advocate Ian Henschke said Australia could learn from New Zealand’s approach, with about 24.7 per cent of people over 65 still working in that country. “We’ve heard of people [in Australia] where they work up until a certain hour and then they tell their employer, look, if I work beyond this, I start to lose too much from my pension,” Mr Henschke said. He said Australia needed a fairer system that did not reduce pension benefits when a retired person worked. Instead, they would be taxed in an income bracket that included their new income and their pension payments.\n\nRead More\n\nIan Henschke Chief Advocate for National Seniors Australia emphasises that the work bonus for pensioners should just be the beginning of national reforms | A Current Affair\n\nIan Henschke from National Seniors Australia. I think we need to recognise that we’ve got a jobs crisis in Australia, 450,000 plus jobs going begging and we’ve got 4.5 million Australians over 65. Ian says the work bonus should just be the beginning of major reforms in the system. He’d like to see Australia follow in the footsteps of New Zealand, where pensioners can work as much as they like without losing benefits. New Zealand has a workforce participation rate of 71%, we’ve got 66%, they’ve got 5% more of their population working and most of it is older workers. That’s where they’re getting their workforce from. Let’s take the handbrake off the economy and let those pensioners work and let those retirees work.\n\nRead More\n\nLet people work | by Ian Henschke | Chief Advocate National Seniors Australia\n\nAUSTRALIA is facing a workforce crisis it’s never seen before. Job vacancies are approaching half a million, dragging business and economic growth down and fuelling a cost-of-living crisis. The hardest hit sectors include agriculture, hospitality, mining, tourism, and the caring industries. The Federal Government has raised the yearly permanent migration quota by 35,000 – but workforce shortages are not going to be solved by immigration alone. We need to boost participation and support people with limited income and savings to earn more. We also need to boost tax revenue to pay for health, aged care, and other social services. To fix these economic and socioeconomic challenges we must “let people work”.\n\nRead More\n\nRecord number of Australian pensioners are marching back to work\n\nAccording to the Bureau of Statistics, an army of Australian workers over the age of 65 are marching back to work, pushing the number of pensioners employed beyond pre-pandemic levels. Breaking the record with 689,000 pensioners employed around Australia, the pandemic, labor shortages and an increase in the amount a pensioner can earn are all contributing factors. Ian Henschke, Chief Advocate for National Seniors Australia, told 6PR Afternoons host Jo McManus that Australia should stop looking to overseas workers to fill the labor shortage.\n\nRead More\n\nWhat Australia’s seniors can expect ahead of 2023\n\nA variety of changes will come into effect as of this week which will affect Australia’s elderly.

Job vacancies are approaching half a million, dragging business and economic growth down and fuelling a cost-of-living crisis. These labour shortages put pressures on food prices, affect supply, and export earnings. National Seniors Australia’s submission to the white paper recommends policies to support workforce participation throughout a person’s life to boost income and savings in later life. One of the key barriers to workforce participation is our punitive tax and transfer system. Centrelink payment recipients are unfairly punished if they work, creating the biggest sources of inequality in Australia.\n\nRead More\n\nOLDER AUSSIES PUSH BACK ON RETIRED LIFE\n\nEarning enough to lead a comfortable lifestyle is one of the reasons why Rick Cullen continues to run a law firm at the age of 75. “That’s part of it,” Cullen says. “But it’s probably more because I find work as interesting as it’s ever been. National Seniors Australia chief advocate Ian Henschke reckons ageism is the biggest barrier to employment for older Australians.

Companies are tapping into the mature-age workforce to help plug the gaps across many industries including retail, health, hospitality and administration sectors. Many of those jobs could be filled by older Australians, said Ian Henschke, National Seniors Australia chief advocate. “The government must act quickly, clearly, and decisively to send a signal to pensioners and veterans they’re needed, valued and free to keep working, re-enter the workforce or work more,” he said.\n\nRead More\n\nNew report shows ‘alarming’ care sector vacancies\n\nYet another report has highlighted the worrying extent of job vacancies within Australia’s aged care and disability care sector, with the newly released National Skills Commission 2022 Skills Priority List revealing a 12% annual increase in jobs shortages.National Seniors Australia Chief Advocate, Ian Henschke described the findings as alarming.\n\nRead More\n\nChannel 9 | Today | Karl Stefanovic interviews Val Dempsey 2022 Senior Australian of the Year\n\n5 October, 2022.\n\nRead More\n\nCheaper drugs and medical appointments thwarted as opposition adds amendment to crucial bill\n\n“The temporary, trial nature of the increase in work bonus may be a barrier for pensioners interested in earning employment income, because the increase may well cease after June 30, 2023,” said policy manager Paul Versteege. “It’s important to extend the trial to, say, June 30, 2024. “CPSA would like to see changes to the current Centrelink employment income reporting requirements, which are unnecessarily onerous, complicated and punitive for pensioners taking advantage of work bonus.” National Seniors Australia has been campaigning for Australia to follow New Zealand’s example and allow working pensioners to keep all their pension regardless of how much they earn, while paying tax on their gross income which would include their pension.\n\nRead More\n\nLaunceston FM | In great support of letting pensioners work\n\n5 October 2022.\n\nRead More\n\nABC News | National Seniors Chief Advocate Ian Henschke | Interview\n\n1 October 2022.\n\nRead More\n\nPension pain: ‘Four per cent, will it make a difference to people?

The government has now agreed to let pensioners earn an extra $4000 this financial year from December.\n\nBut Gibson said the change will barely “scratch the surface” because it’s “only lasting for about six months”.

He suggested allowing the elderly to work more – without it affecting their pension – would solve several problems. “They’ve made a small adjustment to the work bonus, but you really have to take the hand break off the system and say go for it, go out and work and pay income tax,” Henschke said.\n\nRead More\n\nMore workers like Betty, 75, could solve this sector’s woes\n\nWith the aged care industry facing an estimated shortfall of 35,000 workers this year, attracting and retraining experienced staff like Adelaide-based Ms Hurrell is critical for employers. Ms Hurrell is a case in point. She works 30 hours a fortnight but would “certainly” take on more shifts if work rules for pensioners were relaxed further. She said she needed the extra money because the cost of living was surging and she and her husband had been responsible for supporting their grandson since their daughter died 12 years ago. “It seems to me that the government is telling us what we can do and what we can’t do, which doesn’t make sense,” she said of the pension rules.\n\nRead More\n\nAustralia news live: Gina Rinehart accuses government of being out of touch with pensioners over tax threshold\n\nRinehart adds her voice to groups including National Seniors Australia and the National Farmers Federation which have called for pensioners’ pay from labour to be subject only to regular income tax, rather than reducing their pension. “We are an ageing nation that has a participation rate of mature age workers less than the OECD average,” she said, urging the government to encourage pensioners and veterans to continue working during “an acute worker shortage”. “Work income should be exempt from assessment with pensioners simply paying income tax like everyone else.\n\nRead More\n\nPensioners can earn more, but how long will this bonus last?\n\nMr Henschke is calling for a dramatic change to the retirement system. ‘‘If you want to help older people reduce the 500,000 job vacancies, then you need to get Centrelink off their backs,’’ he said. National Seniors supports the idea of allowing age pensioners to work with their income taxed as normal wages. That would mean pensioners would pay tax once the tax-free threshold had been breached. ‘It would all get reconciled at the end of the year with your tax return,” Mr Henschke said. ‘‘If we get the response that pensioners are telling us we would – in other words, if 20 per cent of those aged between 66.5 and 75 wanting to work – that would be 200,000 people. The result would be a net benefit to the budget,’’ Mr Henschke said.\n\nRead More\n\nPensioners incentivised to ‘pick up the tools again’ across key industries\n\n“We have jobs coming out our ears because every business is crying out for staff and we know locals want to help out and relieve the pressure,” he said. “Some might work one shift a week but haven’t been able to do more because it affects their pension. “Often these people are local former employees who have critical skills such as coach drivers, or chefs, and want to help out, but it’s just not worth putting their retirement incomes at risk for a few extra shifts.\n\nRead More\n\nJohn Roskam: Jobs Must Go To Australians First\n\nSenior Fellow of the Institute of Public Affairs, John Roskam, argues that heavy penalties on pensioners working must be scrapped to help alleviate Australia’s crippling nation-wide worker shortage.\n\nRead More\n\nPension work test changes: Seniors can earn more before penalties\n\nThe federal government will change the pension work test and increase the amount age pensioners and veterans can earn before being financially penalised. The measure is only temporary and is set to end 30 June 2023. National Seniors described it as a “good start” but criticised the government for not changing the income reporting requirements. National Seniors chief advocate Ian Henschke said one of the biggest disincentives for age pensioners and veterans to get back into the workforce was the onerous reporting of any income earned to Centrelink, and the fear of losing payments if they got it wrong. “We are very happy to see the Jobs and Skills Summit take seriously our campaign to let pensioners work as a means of addressing the jobs and skills shortage,” he said.\n\nRead More\n\nHardgrave | Allowing pensioners and veterans to work without losing their pensions\n\n5 September 2022.\n\nRead More\n\nJack is 72 and cannot afford to retire.

Measures to allow working seniors to earn extra income without losing their pension was a key outcome from this week’s Jobs and Skill Summit. Under a new scheme, pensioners will receive a one-off income credit and are able to earn up to $4000 extra a year. However, many advocacy groups for older Australians believe the changes don’t go far enough. “The $4000 announced last Friday was a nice step,” Mr Henschke said. “You do not stop being an asset to your society when you are 66.5 and you are put on a pension.”\n\nRead More\n\n$4000 WORK CREDIT FLASH IN PAN BUT MAY GET SENIORS WORKING\n\nSeniors shouldn’t get too excited about the $4000 increase in the amount they can earn without losing some of the age pension.

Mr Dutton said in June it was known there was an “acute problem” within the economy and more workers were needed. “There would be hundreds of thousands, potentially, of workers, in the workforce now,” he said during a media conference on Wednesday. “Hundreds and thousands of days of work being completed that would add to our country’s productivity.”\n\nRead More\n\nA fast fix for the jobs summit: let retirees work without docking their pension\n\nWith historically low unemployment and “we’re hiring” signs all over the place, there’s an understandable push for more skilled migrants. There’s a session on it at the jobs summit on Friday morning. But there’s a quicker fix: an untapped source of hundreds of thousands of skilled workers, who are already in the country, many of whom would like to work but would be penalised for it. Age pensioners who earn more than a minimal amount from paid work (A$490 a fortnight for singles) lose 50 cents out of every extra dollar they earn in reduced pension payments. It’s a powerful disincentive. $490 a fortnight is $245 per week: that’s about nine hours’ income for a worker on the minimum wage with a casual loading. Relaxing the income test – or at least the test on income from work – would have benefits beyond helping to meet our immediate need for skills and experience.\n\nRead More\n\nThe Project | Australia’s workforce shortage | Could Retirees Help Fix Australia’s Skill Shortage?\n\nIn healthcare, hospitality and education, workers are in seriously short supply.

The outspoken state treasurer has thrown his weight behind a push to lift the income level at which pensioners get taxed, arguing that many older citizens would work if they did not face the threat of losing their benefits. “We have a grey army of workers who want to get out there and work but there is no incentive to do so,” Mr Kean told The Australian Financial Review.\n\nRead More\n\nWhy we should be sceptical about skill shortage claims\n\nEconomists and experts say Australia’s workforce shortage could be filled by attracting workers with higher wages and recruiting from the underemployed, those with mild disabilities and pensioners. Ahead of the Jobs and Skills Summit this week, the federal government faces calls to use the tightened labour market to fix low wage growth and access the 1.3 million who remain unemployed or underemployed, including 200,000 people with mild disabilities, and up to 400,000 people on the age pension who want to work more. National Seniors Australia is running a Let Pensioners Work!

Rebekah Sharkie, the Federal Independent MP for Mayo near Adelaide since 2016, and Australia’s richest person Gina Rinehart, believe over-65s should be able to work more without losing their benefits.

John Stanley checks in with Ian to see if the prospect of a different government could mean that senior Australians could see a different approach taken to changing these rules so that seniors can work more.\n\nRead More\n\nPensioners could alleviate the aged care staffing crisis – but will Labor lift the income threshold?\n\nAge pensioners are well suited to working in aged care, and many do, but pension income rules mean they must limit the amount they work to avoid being taxed at the highest marginal tax rate. With the benefits of working for longer well established, and the aged care sector in the midst of an intense worker shortage, there is a growing chorus calling for pensioners to be able to earn a higher income before a punitive tax rate kicks in. New Zealand’s pensioners are not penalised for earning additional income. The participation rate of over 65s working in New Zealand is 25% compared with Australia’s 14%.\n\nRead More\n\nWar drones, sea mines needed to defend north: Rinehart\n\n“I hope with the new government a better decision is made in the interests of West Australians and northern Australia, to relocate the planned navy maintenance investment away from the people and port of Fremantle, and relocate to the north-west, to Cape Preston,” said Mrs Rinehart after Saturday’s election rout of Scott Morrison’s Coalition government. Mrs Rinehart reiterated her belief that senior citizens and defence force veterans should not lose their pensions if they choose to work for an income, saying both the community and the economy would be better off if they were able to participate more at a time of labour shortages. “Enabling our economy to grow via urgent and significant tape cuts is the best way to increase jobs and opportunities for our youth, our females and our entire population, and the best way to enable wage increases and standards of living to rise, in turn providing revenue for necessities like, healthcare, emergencies, police, kindergartens, our elderly and more.”Restrictions on stopping pensioners and vets from working, restrictions that mean they can only work for a few dollars a week without losing all or part of their pensions, and onerous paperwork, must go urgently,” she said.\n\nRead More\n\n9 NEWS | ‘I’m not sure I will survive’: Pensioners pushed into poverty as cost of living soars\n\nMany pensioners who shared stories of struggling to survive on the age pension would not give their names, out of shame or a fear that they will be seen as a burden to their families. “We’ve got roughly one in four older Australians living in poverty. And the fastest growing group of people who are in poverty are single women who are renting.” Ian Henschke is the Chief Advocate for National Seniors, a not-for-profit organisation that campaigns for better outcomes for older Australians. He argues that if pensioners were allowed to work without their pension being cut, it is likely that their combined efforts would contribute more income tax and a greater boost to Australia’s GDP that the savings recouped from the government by cutting their pension. “Don’t penny pinch off the pensioners. Change the taxation system,” he says.\n\nRead More\n\nEditorial | Seniors left sitting on the bench\n\n18 May, 2022.\n\nRead More\n\nREBEKHA SHARKIE TO INTRODUCE BILL TO CUT RED TAPE, NOT CUT PENSION PAYMENTS | FEDERAL MEMBER FOR MAYO | MEDIA RELEASE\n\nThe Federal Member for Mayo Rebekha Sharkie has today committed, if re-elected, she will introduce legislation in the first sitting of the new Parliament to allow senior Australians to work without unfair penalties to their pensions. “It simply makes moral and economic sense to introduce legislation that will allow our seniors to remain or re-join the workforce and not be unfairly penalised for it.” Australia is in the midst of a labour crisis and we have a willing and able workforce ready to go.

He said a National Seniors survey showed one in five pensioners wished to continue working, but only 2.9 per cent were. He said this meant that Australia was missing out on hundreds of thousands of keen and skilled workers, which had a flow on effect to the economy.”Increasing the Pensioner Work Bonus in 2 levels, one for those working in the city, and another for those wishing to work in regional areas where the worker shortage is even more critical, is a viable way to address our immediate labour shortage and will pump billions back into the economy – it truly is a win/win/win,” Mr Pietzsch said.\n\nRead More\n\nCalls to let seniors work without affecting their pension\n\nWith thousands of job vacancies needing to be filled across the country, there are growing calls to allow seniors to work without taking away their aged pension.\n\nRead More\n\nAbsentee overload\n\nAn explosion of COVID-19 cases in WA is intensifying staffing woes, directly impacting businesses which continue to bear the brunt of skills shortages.

The aged pension was first designed and developed in Australia more than a hundred years ago and it’s acknowledged parts of it were modelled on the New Zealand scheme. That’s interesting, because today, all New Zealanders of the pension age are free to work as much as they want, without losing their pension. They just pay income tax. If Australia is the land of the ‘fair go’, then why can’t we give older Australians a go, and let pensioners work?\n\nRead More\n\nSouth Australian industries call for pensioners to return to work amid severe shortages | 7NEWS\n\nThe state’s hospitality sector is screaming out for workers, but many who could fill the jobs are reluctant to put up their hand.

Not only are there plenty of seniors able to work, they are willing. Did you know as many as one in five aged pensioners would consider it? How do we know this? National Seniors asked them. Our recent poll of almost 4000 older Australians revealed 20 per cent of those on the aged pension say they would consider a return to work and 16 per cent have already done so. Now given there are more than two and a half million older Australians on the pension, that would mean a boost to the workforce of more than 500,000 people.\n\nRead More\n\nSo many willing to work\n\n23 April 2022 | ‘ABSOLUTE SENSE’: There is growing support for a push to allow pensioners to work\n\nwithout being penalised once their working week exceeds seven-and-a-half hours.\n\nRead More\n\nSeniors’ lobby says plan could be election winner\n\nA National Seniors survey of around 4000 older Australians in February revealed that a fifth of pensioners would consider re-entering paid work after retirement.

They get to keep their money when they earn it, and they just pay tax. When the pensioner works the pensioner gets 50 cents in the dollar taken away. And then when they earn above the, tax threshold, which I think is about 32,000 when they get another 19 cents to take it away. So they’re paying the highest marginal tax rates of any individuals in Australia effectively. Now, why is that? It’s because Someone somewhere sees the pensioners welfare. And when they see it as welfare, they say, oh, well, you’re not really entitled to keep any of that money.

Many retirees would be happy to work for a few extra years, at least part time, to postpone dipping into their superannuation nest eggs, during which time of course they also would be paying income tax. More important, they would be contributing to an economy in which nine in 10 jobseekers unfortunately lack the requisite training needed for the vast majority of available roles, according to new analysis by the federal Department of Education, Skills and Employment.\n\nRead More\n\n3AW Drive | Ian Henschke Interview\n\nSo if you add all that up, party, this is a no-brainer.

Are over the age of 50, right? So as they head towards their pension date. At the moment, they know that if the Aged care home or the home care provider says to them, would you like to work every weekend for us? Because we do need people on the weekends, they’ll discover very rapidly, but once I’ve worked on that Saturday, the Sunday, they’ll start losing 50 cents in the dollar, and they’ll say, look, it’s not working.\n\nRead More\n\nPension system changes needed to keep older Australians in work\n\n“If the government exempted work income from the income test for those with limited savings it would boost their income and savings in retirement, and boost the productivity of the nation,” Mr Henschke said. “We will nudge millions of Australians into, not out of, work.” The idea has support from business groups and figures. Mining magnate Gina Rinehart said the change would help ease the nation’s skills crisis. “We are a supporter of the government changing its policy where pension arrangements are concerned, so that pensioners can work should they so choose, without onerous tax resulting from their decision to work,” Ms Rinehart said.\n\nRead More\n\nABC Breakfast program interview Ian Henschke\n\nWe say, we need workers in aged care.
