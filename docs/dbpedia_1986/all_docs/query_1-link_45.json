Maness (Ph.D., University of Illinois, Chicago 2013) is an assistant professor and the academic associate for the curriculum on information strategy and political warfare (698) at the Naval Postgraduate School. He is also the director of the DoD Information Strategy Research Center at NPS. His research includes operations in the information environment, specifically in cyberspace, cyber strategy, and power dynamics and interactions among states in cyberspace. Current research includes the collection of all state-initiated cyber incidents, cyber-enabled information operations, and information campaigns for the years 2000-2020, called the Dyadic Cyber Incident and Campaign Dataset (DCID) 2.0. These data are to be open-sourced and publicly available and will give scholars and practitioners new tools to uncover the dynamics of cyber and information conflict within and through cyberspace. Other current research is measuring escalation within and through cyberspace by capturing DIME events enacted with cyber operations, and the target state’s responses to these combined foreign policy actions, cyber operations’ role in the Russo-Ukraine war, influence operations from China and Russia, and sponsored research with ONR and NRP. His forthcoming book, Cyberwar versus Cyber Realities 2.0, is a second edition of his 2015 book with Oxford University Press. Another book proposal on escalation is in negotiations. He has also published Cyber Strategy (2018, Oxford) and Russia’s Coercive Diplomacy (2015, Macmillan) as well as several top journals in security studies.

One model that has become respected both in academic and military context is the \"Magic Diamond\" model developed by Dr. Gordon McCormick. The model involved four key elements or players, with mirrored strategies for their interactions. Each element will have a \"mirrored\" strategy, in which the way in which it imposes or aids insurgency is one image, and where the way that it interacts with counterinsurgency is the reflection. This model develops a symmetrical view of the required actions for both the Insurgent and COIN forces to achieve success. In this way the counterinsurgency model can demonstrate how both the insurgent and COIN forces succeed or fail. The model's strategies and principle apply to both forces, therefore the degree the forces follow the model should have a direct correlation to the success or failure of either the Insurgent or COIN force.\n\nWayne Porter\n\nSenior Lecturer, CAPT USN (ret)\n\nExpertise: Co-Director, CORE Lab, Director, Littoral Operations Center\n\nPh.D., Information Science, Naval Postgraduate School,\n\nnwporter@nps.edu\n\n831-747-0998\n\nDr. Wayne Porter, CAPT, USN (ret), is a Senior Lecturer in the Defense Analysis and Systems Engineering Departments of the Naval Postgraduate School, where he also serves as Co- Director of the CORE Lab and Director of the Littoral Operations Center.

Dr Porter contributed the chapter, The Value of System Dynamics Modeling in Policy Analytics and Planning in the textbook, Policy Analytics, Modelling, and Informatics: Innovative Tools for Solving Complex Social Problems, Springer Publishing (2018). Wayne’s doctoral dissertation was an action research case study in which he used system dynamics to model the Steinbeck Innovation Cluster strategy he helped develop linking the technology and innovation of Silicon Valley with the agriculture and aquaculture industries of Monterey County, California and the Salinas Valley. Articles describing concepts of that strategy have appeared in the Financial Times and Forbes Magazine. Dr. Porter was recently named a Lifetime Achiever by Marquis’ Who’s Who in America. His civilian and military awards include the Ellis Island Medal of Honor, the Vice Admiral Rufus B. Taylor Award for Professional Excellence in Naval Intelligence, the Defense Superior Service Medal, four Legions of Merit, and the NATO Meritorious Service Medal.

My research focuses on the study of international security, conflict processes, ethnic politics, statistical methods, and computational modeling. I am particularly interested in building new linkages between micro- and macro-level evidence in the study of armed conflict, both within and between states. My first book project, The Breakdown of Peace, examines the political economy of symbolic national attachments and the emergence of domestic mass violence. The central argument is that the political pursuit of violent fragmentation is less likely to succeed in countries with strong mass media structures, because such structures generate opportunities for political entrepreneurs to successfully deploy inclusive mobilizational appeals on a national scale. This framework thus endogenizes the emergence of intra-state security dilemmas, by describing the structural conditions under which divided group loyalties are more likely to emerge. It also overturns much of the conventional wisdom concerning the relationship between media and collective violence by demonstrating that mass communication networks, which have frequently been blamed for stoking inter-group animosities, can actually serve as powerful forces for domestic peace and stability. Concurrently, I am also developing independent and collaborative projects on alliance formation, nationalism, war severity, and the emergence of the modern state system.\n\nAmelia Weld\n\nFaculty Associate - Research\n\nExpertise: Global ECCO, Strategic/Serious Games, Partnership Building\n\namsimune@nps.edu\n\n831-656-6297\n\nAmelia Weld is a Faculty Associate for Research with the GlobalECCO project funded by the Regional Defense Fellowship Program.

In 2018 he was recognized as a Distinguished Alumnus of the Naval Postgraduate School. LTG (Ret.) Wendt has published multiple articles, and today teaches Command and Leadership as a Professor of Practice at the Naval Postgraduate School in the Department of Defense Analysis. LTG (Ret.) Wendt brings significant guest speakers into his Command and Leadership courses who are strategic leaders from military, business, interagency, international and other fields, and he serves as the moderator when these guest speakers provide their “Fireside Chats” to the entire assembled Naval Postgraduate School student body. LTG (Ret.) Wendt speaks Arabic and Korean, and retired from active uniformed military service in 2021 as the Commander of the NATO Special Operations Headquarters. In addition to working today as a Professor of Practice at Naval Postgraduate School, LTG (Ret.) Wendt also currently serves as one of two DOD Senior Mentors in Korea. PUBLICATIONS Eric P.

I also have conducted ethnographic fieldwork with Turkana pastoralist warriors in northwest Kenya. They also have a high degree of combat exposure – with about half of adult male mortality due to combat in cattle raids. I am interested in how Turkana organization for war has influenced their susceptibility to combat stress and moral injury. I have interviewed hundreds of warriors about their combat experiences, moral beliefs about warfare, combat stress symptoms, and moral injury. Before starting as an assistant professor at NPS I was a Donald R. Beall Defense Fellow in my department. Before that I was a postdoctoral research fellow at ASU’s Institute of Human Origins and a member of the Adaptation, Behavior, Culture and Society research group in the School of Human Evolution and Social Change. Before that, I was a postdoctoral researcher at the National Institute for Mathematical and Biological Synthesis and, before that, earned by PhD at the University of California, Davis in the Cultural Evolution and Human Behavioral Ecology Labs. I am also a US Air Force veteran with six years of service as a civil engineering officer with deployments to the UAE and Afghanistan."
