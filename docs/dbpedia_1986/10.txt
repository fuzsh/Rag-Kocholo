Journalist Ian Henschke is moving to morning radio in Adelaide.

The Stateline presenter for the past decade is to host 891 ABC Adelaide's morning program in 2011.

He has worked on a range of other ABC TV programs too over the years, including The 7.30 Report, 4 Corners, Countrywide, Landline and for the Australia Network.

"I am thrilled that I can bring together my passion for South Australia with my absolute love of broadcasting," he said.

Another addition to 891 ABC Mornings will be Conversations with Richard Fidler from 11:00am to noon.

Fidler went to high school in Adelaide and launched his performance career as a busker in Rundle Mall.

He is best remembered by many for his role in comedy trio Doug Anthony Allstars.
