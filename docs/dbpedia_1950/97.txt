Story[]

Official Description[]

Many moons ago, in the ancient kingdom of Persia, King Shahraman and his young son, the Prince, were at war with Maharajah of India. They were helped by a Vizier who betrayed the Maharajah and allowed the Persian army to sack the palace. When the palace was plundered, the Vizier asked the Prince to steal a magic dagger which was locked up in the Maharajah's vaults, under heavy guard. Little did the Prince know, however, that the Vizier had his greedy eye on quite another prize: the Sands of Time![1]

And so it was the Prince's dagger that struck home and the Vizier breathed his last. The Sands of Time came back to bless the people of India. And long may those good souls continue to live in peace and felicity, for our hero - the Prince - dwells on, forever in their hearts![2]
