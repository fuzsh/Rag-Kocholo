We are talking flip phones that were anything but smart and whose defining features were having a color screen and being able to text with your friends.\n\nSo, just how did a company mange to squeeze a full Prince of Persia experience onto a device with less memory and space than your modern refrigerator? Well, Gameloft went back to the original Prince of Persia roots to craft a title, that while modern, feels very old-school in the process.\n\nLet’s take a look at the game and join us as we talk a little about how the game plays, feels, and if it was worth your time to pick up back in the early 2000s.\n\nAbout Author"
