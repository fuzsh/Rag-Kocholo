Over these years, I've had the pleasure of working with dozens of amazing development teams and incredible projects. Lately, though, I've felt a waning interest in new releases. It‚Äôs become difficult to truly dive into new games or projects under development with the same enthusiasm I used to have. Honestly, these days I rarely play anything besides the random single-player title. This doesn't mean I've lost that burning passion for creating the \"dream game,\" though, haha üòÅ . One of the most striking examples of such a project I've come across during development was WorldBox by Maxim Karpenko. I first encountered it at some DevGamm event, and it was mind-blowing. This game truly earns the brief description of a \"God simulator.\" It's an incredibly immersive sandbox experience, comparable to the feeling you get when you first play Minecraft. Speaking of passion projects, there's one idea I keep coming back to year after year. It never saw the light, but it remains one of the most ambitious works I‚Äôve ever been a part of. Wake The Dragon - a Hotline Miami clone (as Nigel Lowrie himself once called it üòÉ ), created entirely by a solo developer! And this is true - gameplay-wise, it was indeed a Hotline Miami-inspired top-down shooter, but with a few unique mechanics: - Dozens of types of different weapons: from pistols in two hands to a minigun and a flamethrower. - Imagine level design with explosive red barrels and environments you could completely destroy if you wished. The level design encouraged both strategic pathfinding and pure, chaotic fun ‚ò† - The animations in this project deserve special attention! The developer worked hard to make all the animations as smooth as possible while maintaining variety. To enhance the quality, a form of motion capture was recreated: complex stunts, such as somersaults, were filmed from a top-down perspective using a GoPro, and then carefully redrawn frame by frame in a pixel art style. - Headshot mechanics implementation in a top-down shooter (upon timely aiming directly at the enemy). - Enemy \"finishing\" mechanics - a dozen different \"fatalities\" that involve interacting with nearby objects. Perhaps the fact this game never saw the light is one of my biggest professional regrets to this day, primarily because my own interest in this project has never faded. What do you think? How relevant could this idea be in the realities of 2024? Attaching a video from way back in 2018 for review.\n\nIs it right to label horror as a game genre? Recently I was wondering about the definition of horror in relation to video games. And I came across an interesting idea that I want to share with you. Especially since I have a lot of professionals subscribed to me, who have a lot of different released projects under their belt. It will be a pleasure to enter into a discussion with you about the following :) ‚†Ä So here's what I'm talking about. While watching the MADiSON stream, I caught myself thinking that horror can't be considered a genre in the context of video games. After all, genre in our industry is defined by gameplay mechanics - the things that distinguish games from any other media. Horror is about the gaming experience, about emotion, not about gameplay. ‚†Ä Every genre of video games is characterized by one or more key mechanics without which it cannot be imagined: ‚†Ä - Shooter - shooting - Action-adventure - a set of mechanics for overcoming obstacles - Platformer - vertical movement - RPG - a set of mechanics for creating your own game style - Racing - driving a vehicle ‚†Ä Some genres (which mostly came about due to a few specific projects that twisted their original genre) don't have unique or fundamental mechanics, but just balance a lot of them. This is the case with souls-likes relative to action rpgs, metroidvanias relative to action-adventure/platformers, immersive sims relative to rpg/stealth, and so on. ‚†Ä And horror games have no such thing. Let's talk through examples, mechanically: ‚†Ä - Silent Hill is an action-adventure game - Alien: Isolation and Amnesia are stealth actions - Dead Space - shooter - MADiSON - p'n'c adventure ‚†Ä In addition, the prefix survival is often added to horror, which I think is also wrong. Survival for me logically characterized by the fact that the player needs different ways to maintain several parameters of the life of the character. And in horror games there are rarely more than two: physical and mental health. In that case, any game with gameover is a survival. ‚†Ä Horror is about mood and emotion (note that none of the genres I listed above are characterized by this). It's a whirlwind of stealth, puzzle, action, shooter - it's different everywhere. But the basic formula and core mechanics are not here. FNAF doesn't even have a movement option, MADiSON doesn't have enemies, Amnesia doesn't have a combat system. So perhaps it's more accurate to classify horror as the narrative component of a game? To put it on the same ladder as drama, comedy, and so on? Or perhaps I'm missing something? As I said in the beginning, I'd be happy to have a discussion on this :) #gamedev #gamesindustry #videogames #gamer #gaming #horror #horrorgame\n\nRecently, I've been joking with my team about playing Super Mario Bros 2 during the work day. It's patently false of course. While I'm not what one might consider a gamer, I think Mario Bros 2 is one of THE most creative games of all time. From a marketing perspective it does so much to empower the user, think about experience creatively, and view teamwork in a very utilitarian way. Nintendo Entertainment System's Super Mario Bros 2 empowers the user by allowing users to have different experiences within the same board space. As the user, I get to decide if chucking eggs at Birdo at the end of boards 1-1, 1-2, and 1-3 is how to best fulfill my gameplay! Conversely, if I prefer to grab a magic potion and whisk my team away to the frozen tundras of level 4, I can choose to have that experience. The fact that the potions provide a door to a \"dark\" version of reality where you can jump into tubes, or in this case vases, and travel to a distant place is magical. . .or Sci-Fi. In Super Mario Bros 2, the characters do not merely represent player 1 and player 2 as they did in the predecessor. Each character has unique attributes that make your experience on any given board completely different. From the levitating prowess of Peach, to the erratic bicycle kick of Luigi in mid-air, your interaction with the board is directly correlated with the attributes of that character. Each character brings certain skills to the gameplay that is strategic. Try riding a carpet without Peach and you may find completing the board to be cumbersome. This game gets me thinking about approaches to problems differently. It's not just the idea of warping across multiple levels or flying through the air or jumping on Killer whale water spouts. What amazes me about this is the decision outcomes the designers made in order to make this 2-D side scrolling game so epic. How do you move from one elevation to another? You can climb a vine (avoid ladybugs whenever possible) or ride. . .wait for it. . .a rocket! How do you remove enemies from the board? When stomping on turtles with your butt gets old, try digging up some rutabagas or wrangling some snakes and throwing them at your assailants. It is these things and many more that makes these 2-D pixelated characters into the brand champions they are today. Marveling at them and appreciating the Monty-Pythonesque ludicrousness of the design choices make this one of my favorite ways to study and dissect creativity. #Creativity #problemsolving\n\n\"Parasite in City\" is a gripping survival horror game known for its challenging gameplay and unique pixel art style.

This meticulous approach is evident in titles like the \"Metal Gear Solid\" series and \"Death Stranding,\" where the level of intricacy often blurs the line between virtual and reality. In \"Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater,\" players must navigate a jungle, dealing with hunger and injury in real time. Kojima designed a system where wounds need specific treatments: leeches are burned off with a cigar, and broken bones must be set and bandaged. The food system is equally detailed, with animals and plants offering different nutritional values and spoilage rates, forcing players to strategize their supplies. \"Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain\" showcases a dynamic weather system that impacts gameplay, where sandstorms reduce visibility and rain dampens footsteps, offering stealth advantages. Even the animal behavior is realistic, with sheep acting differently based on their environment. \"Death Stranding\" features a complex package delivery system where weight and balance affect movement, and terrain and weather conditions add to the challenge. A social system allows players to leave supplies and signs for others, fostering a sense of community in the game's desolate world. Kojima's games are rich with cinematic influences, drawn from his love for movies. Influences from filmmakers like Stanley Kubrick and Alfred Hitchcock are evident in his storytelling techniques, camera angles, and pacing. The cutscenes are known for their cinematic quality, blurring the line between film and interactive media. His passion for films influences character and setting design. In \"Metal Gear Solid,\" Revolver Ocelot is inspired by Spaghetti Westerns, complete with dramatic revolver duels. In \"Death Stranding,\" collaborations with directors and actors like Guillermo del Toro and Mads Mikkelsen bring cinematic depth to the game. Kojima's love for food also appears in his games. In \"Metal Gear Solid 3,\" the survival and hunting mechanics reflect his appreciation for food's role in culture and storytelling. These mundane aspects add realism and immersion, making his games more engaging. Hideo Kojima's work is a testament to his dedication to detail and storytelling. His ability to blend intricate gameplay mechanics with cinematic narratives creates an immersive and unforgettable experience, continually pushing the boundaries of what video games can be.\n\nIt's been 30 years since the simulation game princess maker 2 was launched and now they are doing a remaster I think called princess maker 2 regeneration https://lnkd.in/e3DEhvQQ This game is basically like, super fancy tamogachi. Quite a few other games I know of use this model of a turn based character leveling up simulation with other attachments to it. for example: path of wuxia uses this model but they add on to it a tactical combat system so you level up on your \"turns\" and when you hit certain story points or side quests you enter the tactical combat phase. https://lnkd.in/ehhd6Zt8 Another one that consistently is in the top charts of mobile games and I will die on this hill that this is one of the best made games is Uma Musume. Uma musume combines the \"raising\" simulation part along with a gacha monetization of popular characters into a roguelike loop. It's really incredible what it does and it does it at an extremely high quality. https://lnkd.in/eNFBdsSe If you want to delve into some history of some really deep raising sims that also spawned games like Chinese parents https://lnkd.in/eHJdmHSb Princess Maker is really one of the original pioneers that really hit it big in this genre.\n\nPac-Man is one of the most iconic video games of all time, but how well do you really know it? Let's find out! Here are ten facts about Pac-Man. Give yourself one point for each one you already knew. Then, share your score in the comments without looking anything up! 1. Original Name: Pac-Man was originally called \"Puck-Man\" in Japan. The name was changed to avoid potential vandalism that could easily alter the \"P\" to an \"F.\" 2. Creator: Pac-Man was created by Toru Iwatani, a Japanese video game designer who was just 25 years old at the time. 3. Inspiration: The design of Pac-Man was inspired by a pizza with a slice missing. Iwatani wanted to create a game that would appeal to women and couples, unlike the violent space shooters of the time. 4. Ghost Names: The four ghosts in Pac-Man are named Blinky (red), Pinky (pink), Inky (cyan), and Clyde (orange). In Japan, their names are Oikake, Machibuse, Kimagure, and Otoboke, respectively. 5. Ghost AI: Each ghost has its own unique AI behavior. Blinky chases Pac-Man directly, Pinky tries to position itself in front of Pac-Man, Inky‚Äôs behavior is a combination of Blinky‚Äôs and Pinky‚Äôs, and Clyde switches between chasing Pac-Man and wandering off. 6. Gameplay Phases: Pac-Man's gameplay alternates between two distinct phases: the \"chase\" phase, where the ghosts actively pursue Pac-Man, and the \"scatter\" phase, where the ghosts temporarily disperse to their respective corners of the maze. 7. Post-Level 21 Gameplay Switch: The game accelerates and becomes more challenging as you progress through the levels. By level 21, the ghosts reach their maximum speed, and after level 21, the game changes so that ghosts do not turn blue or become edible when Pac-Man eats an energizer, making it all about evasion for 235 more levels. 8. Kill Screen: The game has a \"kill screen\" at level 256 due to a bug that causes the right half of the screen to be garbled, making it impossible to complete the level. 9. Pac-Man Fever: In the early 1980s, there was a hit song called \"Pac-Man Fever\" by Buckner & Garcia, which reached #9 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. 10. World Record: The perfect score in Pac-Man is 3,333,360 points, achieved by eating every dot, energizer, fruit, and blue ghost across all 256 levels without losing a single life. Billy Mitchell was the first to achieve this feat in 1999. --- How many did you know? Share your score in the comments below! Remember, no cheating! üü°"
