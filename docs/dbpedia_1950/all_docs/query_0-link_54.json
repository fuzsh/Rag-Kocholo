        "text": "Sabretooth\n\nOct 27, 2017\n\n5,322\n\nIndia\n\nMay 3, 2022\n\n#101\n\nAs a Mumbaikar, this one is a big ouch, even if I don't care for Ubisoft.\n\nEoin\n\nOct 27, 2017\n\n7,128\n\nMay 3, 2022\n\n#102\n\nShould just release a remaster of the original with 4K, 60fps, new lighting, new models & textures. Kinda the treatment Nintendo gave to OoT 3D where it's improvements to the original experience without being a ground up remake.\n\nUbisoft already fucked up a relatively basic remaster with the PS3 version of Sands of Time and its never-patched audio issues, so I think I'm glad they went with a remake for this one.\n\nSwitch version is getting canned, isn't it?\n\nI think that will depend on what kind of resources Ubisoft Montreal get to throw at it and how they decide to develop it. It's hardly going to be their main focus, but if they remake it in Anvil that might allow for a Switch version. Ubisoft Quebec got Immortals running on Switch so I think there's some chance of a similar port for this.\n\nUnless the Switch is superseded by the end of its development, which is a completely plausible scenario.\n\nIt looked terrible so its a good choice but I have no idea why they gave a new studio such a big project.\n\nThe studio isn't really new, it was founded in 2006 by Gameloft and bought by Ubisoft in 2008. It's been a mobile studio for most of that time though. I think Ubisoft's aim was fairly clear - to give their now-huge mobile studio a chance to do a console game. The choice of game was pretty good too since it was popular, ran on older hardware, and they had a known solid base to work from. It really shouldn't have run into too many issues, but it's clearly had a troubled development between the terrible art choice, the impact of Covid, and probably some other troubles we don't know about.\n\nSunBroDave\n\n\"This guy are sick\"\n\nOct 25, 2017\n\n13,762\n\nMay 3, 2022\n\n#103\n\nIn my opinion India studio did exactly what Ubisoft made them do with budget and time. Issue is that Ubisoft wanted quick cashgrab but fans said no after reveal so they had to delay it. And then they got bad reaction after bad reaction for their reveals of other projects so no they know they need a win so they moved it to Montreal.\n\nThat sure is a lot of conjecture. The only thing we can say with confidence is that they're doing a\n\nBeaconofTruth\n\nDec 30, 2017\n\n3,673\n\nMay 3, 2022\n\n#104\n\nLooking forward to Ubisoft Montreal also finding a way to make a prince of Persia game with little to nothing to represent the Prince being Persian.\n\nDanarchyReigns\n\nOct 25, 2017\n\n35,467\n\nMay 3, 2022\n\n#105\n\nWow, the one Ubi title I was interested in, and it's in development hell. Bravo.\n\nSo that's Skull & Bones, Beyond Good & Evil 2, and this on the list of Ubi Vaporware. Any I'm forgetting?\n\nMay 3, 2022\n\n#106\n\n\"Regroup on the scope\"?\n\nFrom what they showed this looked like a straight remake of the original with a graphical upgrade and very little in the way of changing the actual structure and size of the levels. Whats happened to this game to need such a delay from the first release date they announced?\n\nWhat happened is that it hardly even looked like a \"graphical upgrade\" and they got a lot of backlash from it.\n\nNot without good reasons, either, since it's a beloved series that deserved a lot more budget and proper effort for its soon-to-be-20-years-later revival.\n\nNANA\n\nOct 26, 2017\n\n2,909\n\nMay 3, 2022\n\n#107\n\nShould've been sooner. If you're not going for a RE2/3 level of remaking then give me a remaster and call it a day.\n\nRaigor\n\nMay 14, 2020\n\n15,503\n\nMay 3, 2022\n\n#108\n\nWhat makes you think they had access to a big budget for that Remake ?\n\nBig budget compared to what they were doing prior to the Remake. I meant this.\n\nOf course Ubisoft was never going to give them the budget of Ubi MTL or Massive Entertainment but still.\n\nDeleted member 8579\n\nOct 26, 2017\n\n33,843\n\nMay 3, 2022\n\n#110\n\nI mean it looked terrible and seemed like it had a shoestring budget. I'm surprised Ubisoft actually care at this point as they clearly didn't to begin with.\n\nShinobiBk\n\nOne Winged Slayer\n\nDec 28, 2017\n\n10,134\n\nMay 3, 2022\n\n#111\n\nWhat disastrous development this was\n\nTo be fair, what they showed was possibly one of the worst looking PS4 games I've seen. The backgrounds were fine for the most part but the character models looked ripped straight from a PS3 game and there was like no shadows at all\n\nDreamboum\n\nOct 28, 2017\n\n23,211\n\nMay 3, 2022\n\n#112\n\nGuys i think it's more than graphix. Ubisoft literally have their own subcontractors built in to shit out assets. It has to be more than that\n\nRover_\n\nJun 2, 2020\n\n5,279\n\nMay 3, 2022\n\n#113\n\njust make a fucking new game in the series instead of wasting this much time and money on a remake, ffs.\n\nTambini\n\nOct 25, 2017\n\n5,582\n\nMay 3, 2022\n\n#114\n\nIt looked bad visually, the problems with development must have ran deeper than just the visuals though\n\nGrips\n\nOct 5, 2020\n\n5,612\n\nMainframe\n\nMay 3, 2022\n\n#115\n\nMakes sense that Ubi Mtl studio took the reins.\n\nThis game and Chaos Theory is what I belive defined Ubisoft MTL going forward.\n\nm_shortpants\n\nOct 25, 2017\n\n12,254\n\nMay 3, 2022\n\n#116\n\nHonestly, it looked fucking terrible when they showed it.\n\nScrap it and start over.\n\nSlayven\n\nNever read a comic in his life\n\nOct 25, 2017\n\n96,180\n\nMay 3, 2022\n\n#117\n\ndo the Mumbai studio have other projects, because it is not a good sign if they yanked their sole reason for being\n\nRisingStar\n\nOct 8, 2019\n\n4,849\n\nMay 3, 2022\n\n#118\n\nBig oof for Ubisoft India teams.

I'm so happy they are shifting the game to them now.\n\nThe Sands of Time is one of my all time favorite game and the best one in the series, this makes me really pleased :D\n\nThey can take all the time in the world as long as they release it when Ubisoft Montreal is fully satisfied with it.. so I can fall in love with the game all over again and keep replaying it over and over and over again like the original :-)\n\nAprikurt\n\n▲ Legend ▲\n\nOct 29, 2017\n\n19,099\n\nMay 3, 2022\n\n#120\n\nJust replay the original. It still holds up remarkably well for a 20 year old title. And yeah, it's still one of the best games of all time, no questions there.\n\nShame we got two edgelord sequels, a lame reboot, a game that has Gylenhaal tie in all over it, and nothing else for two decades.

The game must have been in a bad spot gameplay wise as well to be completely taken away.
