Ubisoft Celebrated 35th Anniversary of Prince of Persia With Three Announcements\n\nThe Prince of Persia brand made three announcements at this year's Ubisoft Forward. Among them was a new release date for the remake of The Sands of Time, which is unlikely to please fans.\n\nPrince of Persia is another brand that marked its presence at this year's Ubisoft Forward. Besides Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown and The Rogue Prince of Persia, Prince of Persia: Sands of Time Remake was also showcased... although it's not quite what fans were anticipating.\n\nLet's start with the most important thing - Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time Remake has a new, tentative release date. As it turns out, we will have to wait until 2026 for this game.\n\nFurthermore, a new update for Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown was presented, and it was announced that the story DLC for this production, titled Mask of Darkness, will be released in September of this year."
