        "text": "Ubisoft’s remake for Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time has emerged from the shadows once again. After several delays and the development studio changing from Ubisoft Prune to Ubisoft Montreal, fans have finally gotten a release window for the remake at Ubisoft Forward on Monday. According to the showcase, Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time Remake is scheduled to release in 2026.\n\nThe developers shared a brief visual teaser of the game showing a candle being relit after time rewinds. Other than that and the release year, the developers didn’t share any new details.\n\nUbisoft originally planned to release Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time Remake in 2021. In spring 2023, a developer Q&A and FAQ shared the game was at the “conception phase.” However, developers assured players the game was “very much alive,” but just in an “early stage of development.”"
