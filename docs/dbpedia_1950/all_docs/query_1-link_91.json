        "text": "Prince of Persia is a video game franchise created by Jordan Mechner, originally developed for the Apple II Computer. Through the various titles, the series has been developed and published by many different companies: the first two games in the series, Prince of Persia and Prince of Persia 2: The Shadow and the Flame, were developed by Brøderbund; in recent years Ubisoft has developed the games, starting with Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time.\n\nThe Prince\n\n[edit]\n\nMost people think time is like a river that flows swift and sure in one direction. But I have seen the face of time, and I can tell you: they are wrong. Time is an ocean in a storm. You may wonder who I am or why I say this. Sit down and I will tell you a tale like none you have ever heard. [First and last lines in the Trilogy].\n\nI am the architect of my own destruction. So this is it, what is written in the timeline cannot be changed. Come for me then. In my quest to destroy the sands of time, I have been the one to create them. * Let all who read this know, the courage and valor of those who fought and fell for the Maharajah. We sought the power of the Sands of time, most found only death, my self among them. But the mask of the Wraith gave me a second chance to travel back through time and change my fate.\n\nThis mural shows the impossible. But the mask of the Wraith gave me a second chance, there might still be hope.\n\nYou had your chance to take me, you won't get another!\n\nI am the Prince of Persia, and the King of Blades!\n\nFather, I have brought us honour and glory.\n\nTrust not a man who has betrayed his master, nor take him into your own service, lest he betray you too. I learned the truth of this, to my sorrow, the day we arrived in Azad as the Sultan's honoured guests.\n\nWhen a man is faced with his own death, he finds the impossible less of a barrier.\n\nHe now had his prize, but for some unknown reason coveted the Dagger as well. Well, I would give him what he sought. I would plunge it into his foul and treacherous heart!\n\nFinding my way to the baths from here should be easy. I'll just ask the next sand creature that I come across - 'Excuse me, could you direct me to the baths please? Thank You!' 'Don't mention it! I used to be a bath attendant back when I was alive!'. *imitating Farah* 'I'll meet you at the baths!' She orders me around as if I was a servant! It's my own fault. With women, you have to show them you're in charge right from the start, or they'll walk all over you! I've been too indulgent. Probably because I felt sorry for her. Well, it stops now! From now on, she'll have to toe the line. (pause) That is, assuming I can find her.\n\nI could marry her! After all, she is a Maharajah's daughter. A conquered one, but still, her blood is royal. . . . All right, I've decided. I will marry her. I'll tell her the first chance I get.\n\nMy father's army sacked your palace, captured you as a slave; you have every reason to hate me...now you want me to trust you?\n\nI had faced my enemy, I had looked into his eyes, and I had lost...everything.\n\n....and though I fought until the desert sands themselves were red with blood; I could not bring back the dead.\n\nTo live forever...when those I loved are dead, and I to blame? I choose death.\n\n(when you die) No no no, that's not the way it happened. Shall I start again?\n\nMadness.. what magic is this?\n\nDespite all the warnings that I would fail, I have vanquished the Empress and prevented the creation of the sands of time. I have defeated the Dahaka, and fate itself.\n\nI had saved my own life- and did not even know it.\n\nYou had your chance to take me; you won't get another.\n\nNo, Kaileena, you can change your fate, I have done so! A terrible beast was destined to take my life, but I have freed myself from-\n\nI do not want to hurt you, Kaileena... But I cannot allow that to happen!\n\nI've been thinking, Kaileena. There is little for you on this island, and there will be less still once I have stood before your Mistress. Come with me to Babylon, you'll have a chance to start a new life, free from the evils of this place.\n\n(warcry) For Babylon!\n\nThis storm shows us no mercy. We shall respond in kind!\n\n...For the first time in my life... I am afraid.\n\nDo not worry Kaileena, No harm will come to you in Babylon.\n\nYou will pay for what you have done to my people!\n\nTo undo what I have done? Surely you must think I'm a fool.\n\nWhat if...What if Kaileena didn't die in the Past, but in the Present. The Sands would be created...but the Maharajah would fail to find them. They'd never be brought to his palace, and I'd have never released them! The Dahaka will have no business with me!\n\nI have seen the error of my ways, and I have atoned for the transgressions of my past...I am no longer that person.\n\nExperience has taught me that wishful thinking only leads to disappointment.\n\nI am the Architect of my own Destruction.\n\nDIE, YOU BASTARD!\n\nYou will pay for this transgression.\n\nI have more important matters to attend to.\n\nI will only be given a second chance... to fail.\n\nI died!\n\nDeath! Death to all who stand in my way.\n\nFather would be proud.\n\nWhy is it that everytime disaster strikes I find myself without a proper blade?\n\nJust call me.... Kakulookia.\n\nVizier (Zurvan)\n\n[edit]\n\nYour majesty - I trust you will remember your promise. The Maharajah's treasure vaults lie within.\n\nInside the hourglass is a marvel that no living man has seen. Alas, only the dagger can unlock the sands of time, and it belongs to a greater one than I; a young prince, dearer to his father than all the wealth of India. Perhaps he would oblige...\n\nAh, you must be the Prince of Persia, come home at last! Too late, I'm afraid.\n\nGive me the dagger; you have unleashed the sands of time. I can undo what you have done... Give it to me!\n\nA wild tale indeed. I have a simpler version. A Persian soldier, lusting for glory, entered the chambers of the Maharajah's daughter, and was slain by me...\n\nFarah will make an excellent Queen, after we make some... Modifications.\n\nI am Zurvan, God of Time!\n\nThis is not what the dagger promised!!\n\nFarah\n\n[edit]\n\nWhy did I trust you; why didn't you trust me?\n\nIf it comforts you to mock me then by all means continue, but you are so focused on killing him that you've thrown strategy completely out the window! You could have died...\n\nKakolookiyam...\n\nWhat is your favourite colour?\n\nI saw what you did in the workshop, and what the Old man said is true. You are a Prince.\n\nIf this tomb is to be ours, at least the dagger will be buried with us. And... we are together.\n\nYou don't understand, I need that dagger to-\n\nWhat is he like... your father?\n\nLook! A crack!\n\nPrince? You're a Sand monster?... You lied to me all this time! Stay away from me!\n\nYou are right to be cautious, but fight as bravely as you may, you cannot defeat this enemy! The Sands will spread! They will consume... Everything! I have heard it said that you are kind as well as brave. Please, help me find the hourglass...\n\nPrince, There's still something I don't understand... How did you really know my name?\n\nListen to this: [reading] \"Love is life, so if you want to live, die in love, die in love if you want to stay alive\".\n\nI'll cover you!\n\nSeven years? What are you talking about?\n\nI owe you thanks... But why did you invent such a fantastic story? Do you think me a child, that I would believe such nonsense?\n\nWait... I don't even know your name.\n\nKaileena (Empress of Time)\n\n[edit]\n\nI had hoped the Dahaka would kill you, I had hoped Shahdee would keep you from the island or the towers would finish you off; I even cursed the sword I gave you and yet you did not die!\n\nBe free now Prince, Your journey is at an end.\n\nHow dare you stand before me and admit failure, You should have died to protect me!\n\nYou may wonder why I would let this come to pass. So many dead, and Likely more to follow, an Empire reduced to rubble, a Prince cast to the streets and hunted like a common criminal. But I had seen the timeline, and of all the outcomes lay bare to me, this one held the most promise of them all, for the Prince would have an opportunity to set things right. Watch now, see the thing of which I speak...\n\nPrince, of all the possible futures, this one held the most promise, but something has changed...\n\nHaha, It will take more than a simple sword strike to penetrate my defences!\n\nYou should know that it was not love that drove him, but duty. I was his responsibility, and he had made a promise, a promise that was now broken and undone. Like all mistakes he had made, the Prince intended to fix this. A noble goal to be certain, but a selfish one as well. For he was motivated to ease his own pain.\n\nI have activated the Island's portals. You will travel to his time, engage him at sea and kill him... Kill them all!\n\nAnd so the Prince and Farah separated. She sought to save lives, he to end them.\n\nI have seen your future... And it does not look good.\n\nThis world was not meant for me, but there are others, and I will find my place just as you have found yours.\n\nYou are wasting your time, I can see the future!\n\nAs our ship lay sinking in the harbour, The Prince found himself in a city quite different from the one he had left behind...\n\nI told you to leave and yet you kept coming back. I began to wonder, if you could change your fate, perhaps I could change mine!\n\nLet time run its course.\n\nI have known my whole life that what is written in the timeline cannot be changed!\n\nThey say knowledge is power but I say it is a poison. Knowing the exact date and manner of her death torments her. The closer it draws the greater her pain.\n\nThen you know I have no choice.\n\nThen I choose to live... And for you to die!\n\nEven if you don't want to kill me, you will... The Timeline demands it!\n\nSome believed that when the Prince journeyed to the Island of Time to escape death that he returned alone. The amulet destroyed, the Dahaka appeased,the Empress dead, the Prince was free at last. But this is not how it happened. The truth is that he chose to save me from my destiny. In doing so he set me free…and doomed us all…\n\nI am sorry prince but only one of us can cheat fate today...\n\nFool! I am the Empress Of Time! I know your every move before you do it!\n\nI've already told you. I have foreseen my future to die at your hands. But like you, I decided to change it!\n\nThe Dark Prince\n\n[edit]\n\nNow you see what happened when you try to help people? You die!\n\nAll that is yours is rightfully mine... and mine it will be!\n\nYou really do have a way with women. Those you don't get killed can't get far enough away from you.\n\nI did not spin myself out of the ether, I was not conjured by some mad vizier. I am you! Your rage, your pride, your selfish ways; they give me form and substance!\n\nSeasons change, tastes change... but people? People never change, and you delude yourself believing otherwise...\n\nYou mean to kill me then, to cut me down like all your other enemies? Swing that sword Prince! We've seen how well that works.\n\nDo you think you would be here now if not for me? How many times did I save you? How many times did I unblock your path, take down your enemies, remind you of your mission? While all you did was cry about your father and Kaileena and Farah, how everything bad always happens to you! Boo-hoo, Prince!\n\nIf I am selfish, Prince, it is because you are. If I am ruthless and reckless and lacking in morals it is because you are.\n\nSuch violence! Your anger serves only to feed me. So I have to ask, have you really changed? After all I am right here standing before you!\n\nBlue? That's not my favourite colour.\n\nWhile I admire your bravado... It would be wise for you to show some respect!\n\nI am your untapped potential, your unrealized dreams! I am part of you.\n\nTick tock, Prince. Tick, tock.\n\nTime is precious. Time is fleeting. Time... Is something you have very little of.\n\nWould you like to have a drink?\n\nSo what now? Perform another Grand Rewind? Or maybe go back to the Island Of Time to return to a moment where he didn't die, maybe, saving a damsel in distress along the way?\n\nMaybe Babylon is better off in Zurvan's hands.\n\nYou call yourself a warrior!? Ha Ha!\n\nI have nothing but noble intentions~\n\nYou self-righteous BAST---(The prince cuts him off)\n\nNo no NO! We are so close!\n\nNo! what are you doing?\n\nDo not ignore me! Do not leave me behind! NOOOO! [Last words].\n\nThe Old Man\n\n[edit]\n\nGo then, my Prince. But know this. Your journey will not end well. You cannot change your fate. No man can.\n\nAll hail the Prince of Persia, the greatest hero this city has ever known. You have saved the people of this city and we have come to return the favor.\n\nDialogue\n\n[edit]\n\nOld Man: The Island of Time. The place when the sands were created. The place from which the Maharaja stole the Hourglass.\n\nPrince: And what if I could reach this Island?\n\nOld Man: They say the Maharajah found portals there. Where one could pass backwards through time.\n\nPrince: Back through time to the birthplace of the Sands… Something terrible happened when our army traveled to the Maharajah's palace.\n\nOld Man: You found the sands of time.\n\nPrince: Worse… I opened them.\n\nOld Man: Whosoever shall open the sands must die…\n\nPrince: I was forced to kill those I fought beside. Those I had loved.\n\nOld Man: But now an unstoppable beast chases you…\n\nPrince: For the first time in my life, I am afraid.\n\nOld Man: And you will die.\n\nPrince: I used the sands themselves to reverse time. Making it as if the hourglass was never opened.\n\nOld Man: The Beast. The Dahaka is the guardian of the timeline. You were supposed to die, so it will catch you and see to it that you meet your fate.\n\nPrince: It’s better to try than to wait here for death.\n\nOld Man: Madness! Even if you manage to reach the island. You'll still have to face the empress of time!\n\nPrince: I will travel back in time and prevent the sands from ever being made. If there are no sands, the Dahaka will have no quarrel with me!\n\nOld Man: Go then, my prince. But know this, your journey will not end well. You cannot change your fate. No man can.\n\nFarah: So it's true, he was a traitor?\n\nPrince: Take this, return it to your father's treasure vaults...guard it well...\n\nFarah: I owe you thanks, but why did you invent such a fantastic story, do you think me a child, that I would believe such nonsense?\n\n[Prince kisses Farah]\n\nFarah: [pushes him away] I said I owe you thanks. You presume too much.\n\n[Prince rewinds time]\n\nFarah:...Such a fantastic story, do you think me a child, that I would believe such nonsense?\n\nPrince:...You're right, it was just a story [gives her the dagger].\n\nFarah: Wait, I don't even know your name...\n\nPrince: Just call me...Kakolookiyam...\n\nShahdee: You will never reach our shores alive!\n\nPrince: For your sake...You better hope I don't!\n\n[Fight ensues]\n\n[Shahdee Raises sword and scars the prince]\n\nPrince: Urgh! YOU BITCH!\n\nShahdee: It seems the Empress overestimated your abilities.\n\nPrince: The Empress?\n\nKaileena: Prince, of all the possible futures, this one held the most promise...but something has changed.\n\nPrince: Do not worry, Kaileena, no harm will come to you in Babylon...I promise.\n\nPrince: [touches water and reverts back from being the Dark Prince] Water seems to fight this corruption... Why didn't you tell me this?\n\nDark Prince: [chuckles] What? And ruin all the fun?\n\nFarah: Do you think you could move a little faster?\n\nPrince: You're more than welcome to come down here and try it yourself! (mumbles) Seven years, and still nothing has changed...\n\nFarah: Seven years? What are you talking about?\n\nPrince: It was... er... figure of speech!\n\nFarah: There's something very odd about you.\n\nDark Prince: [chuckles] She has NO idea.\n\nFarah: I will cover you!\n\nPrince: Please don't; You're liable to hit me.\n\nPrince:*gets hit by an arrow* OUCH!\n\nFarah: Oops, sorry!\n\nPrince: Wait, Farah!\n\nFarah: How do you know my name?\n\nPrince: Yes...um...I...\n\nDark Prince: I eagerly await your response.\n\nPrince: I have heard tales of a beautiful...and brave Princess of India. One who has travelled to Babylon to punish an evil Vizier who has caused her...great distress.\n\n(Farah raises her bow, readies an arrow, and aims toward the Prince)\n\nDark Prince: See? Now she's going to kill us.\n\nFarah: Try moving the switch forward.\n\nPrince: With my luck it will probably spring some horrible trap, or summon sand monsters, or bring about the end of the world!\n\nFarah: Would it kill you to show a little optimism?\n\nPrince: Experience has taught me that wishful thinking only leads to disappointment.\n\nDark Prince: With the ability to manipulate time itself, you had the chance to become the greatest king the world has ever known. What wars you could have fought; what monuments you could have erected in your honor; what women you could have kept. But you have failed me, Prince. You grew soft and sympathetic; my attempts to convince you to seek glory fell on deaf ears. So, I bided my time; waiting for the proper moment to strike. You do not deserve what you have been given, control over the world's greatest empire. With the power of the Sands at your command you could rule the world. You have squandered it Prince, I will do it justice, and so it should be *mine*!\n\nPrince: You are just a parasite, you deserve NOTHING!\n\nDark Prince: But don't I? Have I not earned it? Do you think you'd still be here if not for me? How many times did I save you? How many times have I unblocked your path, cut down your enemies, remind you of your mission? While all you did was cry about your father, and Kaileena, and Farah, how everything bad always happens to you. Boo hoo, Prince!\n\nPrince: Your words are empty, have always been empty. You are just a desperate, selfish spirit.\n\nDark Prince: If I am selfish, Prince, it is because *you* are. If I am ruthless and reckless and lacking in morals, it is because *you* are. I did not spin myself from out of the ether, I was not conjured by some mad vizier; I am *YOU*.\n\nPrince: No, I have seen the error of my ways, and I have atoned for the transgressions of my past. I am no longer that person.\n\nDark Prince: Seasons change, tastes change. But people... people never change. You delude yourself believing otherwise. Do not fight me. Set down your sword; embrace me. Do you mean to kill me then, to cut me down like all your other enemies? SWING THAT SWORD, PRINCE! We'll see how well that works. Such violence, your anger serves only to feed me. So I have to ask, have you really changed? After all, I'm still right here standing before you.\n\nPrince of Persia (2008)\n\n[edit]\n\nElika: I just want to know that I can rely on you... people can... well they can…\n\nPrince: And you have a lot of experience with people?\n\nElika: I have experience of men doing stupid things for women!\n\nPrince: Well I only ever do stupid things for myself\n\nPrince: You're an attractive lady.\n\nElika: I've got a brain too.\n\nPrince: Pity you're wasting both!\n\nElika: And you're the one to lecture me on that?\n\nPrince: I've good looks and brain then?\n\nElika: One you rely on too much and the one you don't use at all!\n\nPrince: There is nothing wrong with a good look!\n\nElika: Gold glitters, but it's what you buy with it that counts.\n\nPrince: The corrupted sold their souls? What's the going rate?\n\nPrince: We'll be fine… I hope…\n\nElika: I'm alright… it's nothing…\n\nPrince: It looks like it…\n\nPrince: Say, the next time you want to win your daughter back, you could just try giving her a pony, the apocalypse doesn't really cut it!\n\nPrince: I hope that hurt!\n\nElika: He can't hear you.\n\nPrince: He can't?! And you're an ugly mother too!\n\n[Elika gives him a look]\n\nPrince: What?\n\nPrince: See, you don't always have to wait for things; you have to make things happen!\n\nElika: Is that so?\n\nPrince: Look around you, we could die in the next five minutes, then where would waiting have got you? I'd rather die trying than waiting…\n\nElika: Maybe you're right… if you want something… if you REALLY want something, you shouldn’t wait…\n\nPrince: Yeah?\n\nElika: So? What are we waiting for? [walks away]\n\nPrince: Scary guy this alchemist then?\n\nElika: He can make the corruption act for him, he shapes it, makes it become what he wishes.\n\nPrince: There was a potter I knew like that… oh the things she could do with her hands.\n\nPrince: Hrrm… imagine this, full of water, surrounded by nature, your own private oasis in the middle of desert, hey Princess?\n\nElika: That's me! All about excess!\n\nPrince: Did you have your own hand maidens too?\n\nElika: You can feed that part of your imagination yourself!\n\nPrince: Run, jump, ... die, repeat..., run, jump, ... die, repeat... I'm starting to get the hang of this...\n\nPrince: Much more of this and I might start talking to myself... No you won't... No, I might, really.\n\nPrince: Anything else you think you should be telling me?\n\nElika: You're an idiot.\n\nElika: Patience brings its own rewards.\n\nPrince: So does walking into a harem covered in chocolate.\n\nPrince: Why did you have cages in your town square.\n\nElika: How do you think we scared our children? 'Be good, or you'll go in the cage and Ahriman will get you'.\n\nPrince: For real?\n\nElika: We held animals in there for market, you idiot.\n\n[Prince jumps off the tower and Elika saves him]\n\nElika: You idiot.\n\nPrince: I knew you'd catch me.\n\nElika: What if I was unconscious?\n\nPrince: ...I didn't think of that.\n\nPrince: You can't act like this. Giving up now is like you didn't even care that you lost those things.\n\nElika: That's a good speech. Where'd you pick it up?\n\nPrince: Two silver coins from a fortune-teller in Babylon.\n\nElika: Why are you doing this? Why are you helping me? You're not doing it for me, are you? I've seen how you look at me... I've seen that look before...\n\nPrince: Now look, you're cute, but not 'stay to fight a dark god' cute.\n\nElika: Would you have helped... if my father had asked you?\n\nPrince: He's not that cute either.\n\nElika: Wow compared to you I'm a saint!\n\nPrince: Hey, I've helped many little old ladies in my day.\n\nElika: Yeah only if they had attractive daughters.\n\nPrince: Then I helped them too!\n\nPrince: Want to play a game? Come on, it'll be fun!\n\nElika: The World's about to end and you want to play a game?!\n\nPrince: Might as well die happy.\n\nElika: What sort of game is this?\n\nPrince: Well, I see something and you have to guess what it is.\n\nElika: How can I guess that?\n\nPrince: You just guess.\n\nElika: Grass.\n\nPrince: No.\n\nElika: Rock.\n\nPrince: No.\n\nElika: This is a stupid game.\n\n...\n\nPrince: Want another go?\n\nElika: No... Path.\n\nPrince: No.\n\nElika: This is impossible!\n\n...\n\nPrince: The game would be easier if we played it by the rules.\n\nElika: There are rules?\n\nPrince: Yeah. I tell you the first letter.\n\nElika: Then why didn't you do that?\n\nPrince: You didn't give me a chance.\n\nElika: *sigh* Can we get to the Fertile Ground?..\n\n...\n\nPrince: S.\n\nElika: Are you still playing that game?\n\nPrince: S.\n\nElika: Sky.\n\nPrince: Hey! You got it! Okay, your turn.\n\n...\n\nPrince: Come on, your turn.\n\nElika: For what? Uhm... C.\n\nPrince: Corruption.\n\nElika: Yes. Can we go on?\n\n...\n\nPrince: S.\n\nElika: Sky again?\n\nPrince: Now you're getting it!\n\nElika: You picked 'sky' again?\n\nPrince: No, but you're getting the hang of the rules.\n\nElika: Ah, thanks, they're so complex I was worried they might evade me.\n\n...\n\nPrince: S.\n\nElika: Scar.\n\nPrince: No.\n\nElika: Scarf??\n\nPrince: No.\n\nElika: Shrine?\n\nPrince: Aha! No.\n\nElika: I give up.\n\nPrince: It's too soon to give up.\n\nElika: I give up!\n\nPrince: Soulless Follower of Ahriman!\n\nElika: I am amazed no one threw you overboard on your sea trips.\n\n...\n\nPrince: G.\n\nElika: Are you still playing?\n\nPrince: G!\n\nElika: Gauntlet.\n\nPrince: Yes!\n\nElika: You wanna make this game harder?\n\n...\n\nPrince: Wanna play the game again for forfeits?\n\nElika: No.\n\nPrince: Ugh. I wish I hadn't eaten that curry goat.\n\nPrince: Girl falling down the sky, should have taken that as a sign. Nothing is that easy.\n\nElika: If you need any consolation, I was glad you were there to land on.\n\nPrince: Nice collection of dust you have here.\n\nPrince: I'm not here. Someone else is doing this crazy stuff.\n\nPrince: And I thought today was going to be a quiet day.\n\nElika: Huh, you should've changed your fortune teller.\n\nPrince: How did I get into this...and what is this that I've got into?\n\nPrince: This place is the back of the back of beyond.\n\nPrince: Is this an average day for you?\n\nElika: Does it look like it?\n\nPrince: He isn't exactly polite; he barely knows us and he's trying to kill us.\n\nPrince: Sure, climb up the roof. It's not like gravity killed anyone.\n\nPrince: [astonished] You're good!\n\nElika: Better than you know.\n\nElika: [pointing to the Hunter] He needs to get away from there!\n\nPrince: Hey! Get away from there!\n\n[the Hunter descends to them]\n\nPrince: There you go.\n\nElika: No, here we go.\n\nPrince: Oh oh.\n\n[after defeating the enemy]\n\nPrince: Now that should teach you something!\n\nPrince: Aw! Don't pull so hard!\n\nPrince: Sharp sword and empty horizon. Sometimes that's all a man needs... sometimes.\n\nPrince: Anything to eat around here? I'm getting hungry.\n\nPrince: How do I get myself into these messes?\n\nPrince: Heard about magic, talked about magic. Never seen it before.\n\nPrince: There's more adventure here than in your average life span.\n\nPrince: I had to get here 200 years after civilization left.\n\nPrince: This day is gonna age me a month.\n\nPrince: I should have listened more to my mother.\n\nPrince: These trousers were new!\n\nPrince: Temple, yes. Altar girls and gold, no. This place needs a lot of work.\n\nPrince: Temple guards, pirates, crazed mobs... huh, those were the good times.\n\nPrince: I like your top.\n\nElika: I think I have a spare if you'd like it.\n\nPrince: Corruption... looks bad, feels bad... smells terrible.\n\nPrince: Ready to face certain death again?\n\nPrince: Ah, I'm really starting to feel this in my shoulders. You couldn't give my a back rub, could you?\n\nElika: That's right; I couldn't.\n\nPrince: Settle down, find a girl, adventuring will kill you. I think my mother was right.\n\nPrince: Gods, monsters, crazy women... [laughs] What's the difference?\n\nPrince: I hope that smell isn't me... or you.\n\nPrince: This place is crazier than a boat shop in a desert town.\n\nPrince: Ahriman, Ormazd, corruption, corrupted. Why couldn't I have fallen in a canyon full of lost amazons?\n\nPrince: More of this and I'll be wearing out my gauntlet.\n\nElika: Where did you get that thing anyway?\n\nPrince: Oh, you know... just... found it.\n\nPrince: Rocks dropped on me, monsters coming from the grounds, dark gods... What did I do wrong?\n\nPrince: [starts humming] Doo doo doo... Oh sorry, I forgot you were there.\n\nPrince: Do corruption stains come out?\n\nPrince: Well they said I couldn't find my own donkey in a sandstorm, well here I am and proving them right.\n\nPrince: Oh, you're heavier than you look!\n\nPrince: I think we just found another way to get killed. Is this ever going to stop?\n\nPrince: It's much nicer now; nothing’s trying to kill us.\n\nPrince: Nice little trap… shall we take the bait again?\n\nPrince: How are you gonna spend your day? Oh, I don't know. Maybe I'm gonna get eaten?\n\n[the Hunter comes down from the windmill]\n\nPrince: Finally something I can hit!\n\nPrince: Dying is easy, staying alive is hard. But I like the challenge.\n\nPrince: There are plenty of ways to get killed in this place.\n\nPrince: I'm going to have blisters on my blisters by the time we finish.\n\nPrince: I'm trying not to think. If I realize what's happening here, I might just lose it.\n\nPrince: Do you believe it? I've still got sand in my shoes… and worse places!\n\nPrince: You're pretty fit for a princess.\n\nPrince: Much more running! I'm gonna need new shoes and new feet!\n\nPrince: Here I am fighting someone else's war. The one thing that I didn't want to do with my life.\n\n[at the corrupted Temple]\n\nPrince: When I die I want to come to a place exactly… unlike this.\n\nPrince: You don't act like a princess.\n\nElika: How do princesses act?\n\nPrince: All the money, none of the sense. Don't know which end of a camel eat and which end-\n\nElika: I know which end of a camel does what.\n\nPrince: A princess. A real princess.\n\nElika: What about you? Who are you?\n\nPrince: There's not a lot to tell.\n\nPrince: Your turn to tell me something.\n\nElika: You've still not said where you got the gold.\n\nPrince: I found it.\n\nElika: You found it... You're a thief!\n\nPrince: I'm an adventurer.\n\nElika: You're a thief!\n\nPrince: I reclaim abandoned property.\n\n...\n\nPrince: I was a few days from here. I'd heard rumours of a tomb. A little bit of digging, a small amout of hiding and... Forget one donkey. I could've loaded twenty, thirty... If those guards hadn't turned up. Still, I got away with enough to keep life pleasurable for a few more years.\n\nElika: You robbed the dead?!\n\nPrince: It's a lot easier than robbing the living...\n\n...\n\nPrince: [to himself] Why am I being punished? Sure, I took a little gold, but the owner had been dead for three hundred years. It's not like he was going to do anything with it.\n\nElika: Who's out there waiting for you?\n\nPrince: Whole world full of people.\n\nElika: Is there no one you've got close to?\n\nPrince: Trust yourself and you don't need to.\n\nElika: Trusting your own judgement can get lonely.\n\nPrince: You rely on someone else, they'll just let you down.\n\nElika: You haven't let me down.\n\nPrince: You haven't known me long enough.\n\nElika: Tell me about your family.\n\nPrince: I don't have a family.\n\nElika: Well, you come from somewhere.\n\nPrince: Yes, and I'm going somewhere else.\n\nPrince: You had to pick this religion? You couldn't have picked one where all the evil creatures were I don't know... slightly angry sheep?\n\nPrince: This part looks a bit tricky.\n\nElika: Worried that you may break a nail?\n\nPrince: Now that’s humor.\n\nPrince: Keep your eyes open.\n\nElika: Why are you so jumpy?\n\nPrince: I'm not jumpy. There's 'quiet' and 'too quiet'.\n\nElika: Everything looks quiet.\n\nPrince: Don't say it's quiet, don't ever say it's quiet.\n\nPrince: Now what?\n\nElika: That way, on the plate.\n\nPrince: Have you guys never heard of stairs?\n\nPrince: You know, I've thought about settling down… Milling flour for a living.\n\nElika: Really?\n\nPrince: (laughs) Are you kidding? How boring would that be?!\n\nPrince: I've never seen a girl… you know… do… what you do…\n\nElika: You must have been looking for girls in the wrong places.\n\nPrince: I thought this was all a legend!\n\nElika: I thought this was all there was.\n\n[when the Hunter made them drop down]\n\nPrince: You think you got us? You think it's easy? We're coming back for you!\n\n[Prince stays silent for a few seconds]\n\nPrince: … If we can find a way out of here.\n\n[to Elika]\n\nPrince: Here take my hand. Hey, take all of me!\n\n[at the last battle with the Alchemist]\n\nPrince: Hey, I'm a legend! I'll live forever anyway!\n\n[the Prince stays silent for a second]\n\nPrince: Wow… that sounded better in my head than out loud.\n\nPrince: Now it's your turn. Tell me something about you.\n\nElika: Like what?\n\nPrince: I don't know… something like… your last boyfriend?\n\nElika: Never had one.\n\nPrince: Never?\n\nElika: Never.\n\nPrince: If you never had a boyfriend… then…\n\nElika: I'm very well read.\n\nPrince: But sometimes it's better to experience in person.\n\nPrince: Well, here we are… the both of us… in the dark\n\n[the shadow monsters screech]\n\nElika: Saved by the yell.\n\n[after the Prince fell]\n\nElika: Watch your footing.\n\nPrince: I did; I watched it fall away.\n\nElika: In Ormazd his name…\n\nPrince: That's it, keep praying; keep praying for the both of us! It's very generous of you to risk my life for your God!\n\nAhriman: She is dead. Dead for eternity, but I will be free.\n\nAhriman: I shall be free. Where then will the light be? What candle will shine in the darkness now that she is gone?\n\nAhriman: The power of this place wanes, and when I am free, she will already have been forgotten.\n\nAhriman: She has blinded you with her light, burned you with her will until it became yours. Reclaim your destiny.\n\nAhriman: What injury have I done to you that you have not done to me?\n\nElika: You rob the graves!\n\nPrince: It's called Tomb Raiding.\n\n[after Prince being rescued by Elika]\n\nPrince: You have a good grip.\n\nElika: I've been practising.\n\n[after Prince being rescued by Elika]\n\nPrince: That was tickling."
