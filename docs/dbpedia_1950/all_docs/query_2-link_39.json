        "text": "You may recall that Ubisoft is currently in the process of developing a remake of Prince of Persia: Sands of Time. The game was originally released in 2003. Unfortunately, the game has been going through some development hell for years now, including development of the game changing to a different studio.\n\nWell, there has been some new news, courtesy of Ubisoftâ€™s presentation today. It has been officially announced that the remake of Prince of Persia: Sands of Time will be releasing in 2026. Back when it was first revealed in 2020, the game was originally slated to release in 2021, making it 5 years since the Prince Of Persia: Sands of Time remake was originally intended to release.\n\nSource"
