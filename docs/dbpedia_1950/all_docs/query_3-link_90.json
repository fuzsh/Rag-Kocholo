Download Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time (Aug 19, 2003 prototype) from external mirror\n\nA prototype of Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time for the PlayStation 2.\n\nNotes\n\nHas debug utitlities and a cheat menu.\n\nDEBUG CONTROLS:\n\nDPAD UP-> Enables Freecam. DPAD LEFT -> Changes Weapon. DPAD DOWN-> Increases\\ Decreases Health. DPAD RIGHT -> Spawns Farah (works only in levels she's in). SELECT -> Game Over. R3-> Fly Mode.\n\nMiscellaneous Notes:\n\nGame is emulatable (in PCSX2): Yes (as of March 17, 2021).\n\nGame contains dongle protection: No.\n\nDifferences\n\nUses an older version of the Ubisoft logo compared to the retail/final version, this logo can also be found in the demo of the game released as a part of Jampack Winter 2003.\n\nThe cinematic that follows the logo (which is a short version of the intro cinematic) is a different version of the one in final version, most notable showing an extra scene of a desert.\n\nThe cinematic leads to the game logo which is again different from the retail version and similar to the one in the Jampack Winter 2003 version.\n\nThe main menu lacks the \"Extra Features\" option but instead has the options \"Special Load Map\" and \"Special\" which have functions as discussed in the previous section.\n\nAs previously mentioned, the intro cinematic is a slightly modified version. After the cinematic ends, the balcony is again visible for a second, unlike the retail version which has a clean transition.\n\nThe enemies' weapons create a blue trail when swung.\n\nThe cinematic of the prince unleashing the sands is unfinished. Sharaman has an extra dialogue, he adds \"I hope your Palace has room for some insignificant treasures from India\" before presenting the hourglass to the Sultan of Azad.\n\nThe weapons of sand enemies drop after they are absorbed and their texture stays for a second before disappearing.\n\nThe prince has a battle rage scream that has a chance of playing when absorbing enemies.\n\nThere is an additional cutscene after the first fight showing Farah terrified and running away on seeing the prince.\n\nThere is an additional entrance to the second guest room that avoids a long route.\n\nBefore entering the second guest room (using the normal entrance), it is possible to go through the debris as they lack collision on the other side and replay the first guest room again.\n\nThe life upgrades lack sound effect.\n\nIn the cutscene where prince meets Farah for the first time, she is seen having the sword of the avenging warrior, this is normally the case only in the Tower of Dawn section.\n\nThe scarabs can be vaulted over and parried, allowing the player to execute much more combos on them compared to the final version.\n\nThe sound effect of various actions are different as compared to final version. Some examples include moving boxes, breaking cracked walls, etc.\n\nAll the pullable levers and hanging levers in the prototype have wooden handles as opposed to metal handles in the final version.\n\nThe wall behind the ladder that gives access to the lever at the end of palace defense puzzle is missing.\n\nThere is some kind of text in the wall beside the lever mentioned above that is not present in the final version.\n\nAt the very end of the booby trapped courtyard, there is a rotating lever to open the door as compared to a pressure plate in the final version.\n\nA lot of doors are grilled in the prototype unlike the final version where they are solid.\n\nFarah doesn't die when she is left behind in the segment after the fight with sand king. In general, leaving Farah behind doesn't seem to cause problems in this version unlike the final version where it can cause game-overs or even softlocks.\n\nThere are lot of destroyable objects blocking the path at the entrance of the warehouse.\n\nAt the end of the warehouse segment, there is a hanging lever instead of a pressure plate to open the final door.\n\nThe cutscene that plays when the above mentioned door is exited is missing. Cutscenes showing doors being closed missing is a common occurrence throughout this version.\n\nSands birds can be vaulted over and countered, but the physics and animations can be quite buggy when these moves are executed.\n\nAll cutscenes involving moving ladders have a glow effect indicative of the friction caused between the ladder and the wall.\n\nWhen the breakable walls that lead to life upgrades are broken, the wall is instantly sealed as if the life upgrade was already obtained. When cheat is used to bypass the wall, the corridor leading to the life upgrade is present and behaves normally.\n\nAt the end of the corridor after exiting the baths section, there are scarabs present.\n\nThe pressure plate that opens the door at the entrance of the messhall is present in a different location and the cutscene that plays after the door is opened is slightly different.\n\nThere is an extra pressure plate to open the above mentioned door from the inside.\n\nAt the first floor of messhall, there is a breakable wall instead of a door.\n\nBeside the lever that opens the door to the second floor of messhall, there is a bronze metal version of the game logo. This version of the logo becomes a common occurrence throughout this version.\n\nIn the small room after crossing the drawbridge, the two door and the rotating lever that controls them are missing.\n\nThe sand vortexes after at the broken bridge segment, the segment after and the cavern of ladders segment are missing. However, they are present when loaded using the special load map feature in the menu.\n\nThe door to the entrance of the waterfall area is opened with a rotating lever instead of a pressure plate as in the final version.\n\nThe underground reservoir area has a slightly different ambient sound.\n\nThe wooden trapdoor covering the metal door that leads to the sultan's harem has a slightly different design.\n\nThe grills present in harem have a different design.\n\nThe statue that needs to be moved so that Farah can access the switch to the exit door of harem is missing.\n\nThe doors and the levers that controls them in the corridor between harem and the hall of learning is missing.\n\nThe hall of learning features the servant enemies instead of the blue enemies. All the fights after this point seem to have some variance in terms of the enemies featured as compared to the final version.\n\nThere is a rotating lever instead of a pullable lever for opening the exit door in the hall of learning.\n\nThe path leading to observatory has a different design.\n\nSome walls hiding the scenery in the hall of learning courtyards is invisible.\n\nThe sand birds present in this area are missing.\n\nThere is an extra rotating lever in this area that opens only some of the doors that the only lever in the final version opens. The normal lever opens the remaining doors in the prototype.\n\nThe torture chamber area is in a pretty unfinished state. Levers and pressure plates that are needed for traversing without cheats are missing.\n\nAt the entrance of the tower of dawn, there is an extra pressure plate that opens the grills of the elevator.\n\nThe long cutscene after the hourglass cinematic is pretty bugged.\n\nThere is a minor design difference in the long swing pole right after \"the setting sun\" save.\n\nThe vizier's clones have a different knockdown animation.\n\nThe cutscene where the prince knocks the real vizier through the grill ends abruptly and the game returns to the main menu.\n\nScreenshots\n\nOrigin\n\nDisc front.\n\nFiles\n\nFile Type Date Size SHA-1 PS2 - Prince of Persia Preview.bin File 2020-06-11 12:20:56 1.21 GB 3be770cf003133ef3a1799981a6dcf71e3377304 PS2 - Prince of Persia Preview.cue File 2020-06-11 11:56:45 96 bytes 7546faa61b33b6f367faab0c102e3fd5d5a256d1 PS2 - Prince of Persia Preview.jpeg File 2021-03-14 11:12:39 1.12 MB 033367775215a184fe2ca010f6d127dc1aacef79\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nA huge thanks to SolidSnake11 for doing the initial research on this prototype!
