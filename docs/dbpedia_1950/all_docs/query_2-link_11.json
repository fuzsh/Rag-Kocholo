        "text": "Back in 2003, Prince of Persia released the Sands of Time, a historic game within the franchise. Playable for systems like the GameCube, PlayStation 2 and more, this game instantly grew a large fanbase.\n\nThen, only a few years back, it was announced that the famous title was getting a remake for next-gen consoles.\n\nHere is everything we know about the Prince of Persia: Sands of Time remake.\n\nWhen Will the Sands of Time Remake Release?\n\nThis is a touchy question. While the Prince of Persia: Sands of Time remake was announced back in 2020, there has been no definitive release date or release window. In fact, in 2021, Ubisoft announced that the game was being pushed back indefinitely.\n\nNot a good sign, right? Well, in 2022, it was revealed that a brand-new team was taking over the production of the game. For some, this was exciting, but for others, this just meant that the delay of the remake was further down the road.\n\nNow, in 2024, there have been exact dates released or even a year that the game is supposed to be released, but many are hoping to see the game come to light by the end of 2024 or early 2025.\n\nAs for now, those waiting for the Sands of Time remake will have to be more patient. Hopefully, we see a release date soon, though.\n\nRelated: An NPC In Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown is Voiced by Text to Speech\n\nWill the Sands of Time Remake be Playable on PS5 and Xbox?\n\nWhen first announced back in 2020, the game was set to release on PS4 and Xbox One. There probably would have been a port to Xbox Series X and PS5, but its original release was set to release on the old-gen consoles.\n\nWith how much the game has been put off, it would be simply ludicrous for Ubisoft to release the title on old-gen consoles. It is safe to assume that the game will be playable on both PS5 and Xbox Series X.\n\nHow much the game will cost, though, is still unknown. With the prices of games being raised recently, it wouldn’t be wrong to assume the remake may be more than the usual $59.99 USD. Hopefully, though, that is not the case.\n\nWill the Sands of Time Remake be Playable on Nintendo Switch and PC?\n\nPC fans can rejoice in knowing that the game will be available for Microsoft Windows. Nintendo Switch fans, though, have not gotten any news on the game’s release on their platform.\n\nIt wouldn’t be unheard of to see the game released on the Switch, but at the moment it is unlikely. A wide majority of new releases that are meant for all platforms have not been getting a release on the Switch, at least not right away.\n\nThere could be a port for the handheld console in the future, though. There is always hope.\n\nRelated: Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown Demo Announcement Leaked Ahead of the Game Awards\n\nWhat Will the Prince of Persia Remake be Rated?\n\nStanding with its roots, the Prince of Persa: Sands of Time remake will be a rating of T for Teen. Ubisoft’s website has the rating listed to include blood, partial nudity, sexual themes and violence. The original title was not too provocative or violent, so the remake will probably be no worse.\n\nThe game has a lot of intense action, though, so those who are looking for a more milder game should look elsewhere. The Prince’s controlling of time allows for some awesome fighting mechanics within the game, making it stand out from other sword-fighting RPGs.\n\nWill the Sands of Time be Multiplayer?\n\nIt can only be assumed that, no, the Prince of Persia: Sands of Time remake will not be multiplayer. The original game is a single-player puzzle-adventure game, and it would only make sense for the remake to stay the same.\n\nUbisoft has made it clear that they want the game to pull in new fans too, so their work has been dedicated toward the graphics and fighting mechanics, hoping to make it one of the better titles released in the modern age.\n\nThe original title was already a hit with gamers, so having a remake that focuses on taking everything that was loved in the original and heightening it, will be an absolute blast to play.\n\nStay tuned to Insider Gaming for more Prince of Persia: Sands of Time remake news and updates."
