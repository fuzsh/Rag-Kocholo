        "text": "Hi, I’m Romain. I’m not going to use the third person here.\n\nI’m a composer who grew up sandwiched between Nintendo games and 1980s family movies. However, I like to think my taste and abilities keep being shaped by various newer and incredible things people are doing nowadays. Born too poor to afford a music education and too pigheaded to do anything I was told as a kid, I am self-taught. Rumor has it I was playing TV themes by ear on my dad’s cheap organ before I turned 4, I made a lot of music with 16 bit computers like the wonderful Amiga (being active in the “demoscene”), but today I use the latest Cubase Pro and record live instruments as well.\n\nAt 17 I sold my first couple of tunes to a budget PC game developer. At 21 I was hired as the sole sound artist at Gameloft, a position that gradually evolved to hiring teammates around the world and becoming the audio director for the whole company. I did that for 6 years, then co-founded and co-managed a now defunct game dev studio called Yullaby. We made unimportant games, but we’re proud that they were programmed very well and ran fast. One of them was a puzzler called Magnetis, whose Steam version got stolen by someone in Russia who’s been getting our sales revenue for a few years now. Running a business is incredibly difficult and taught me many valuable lessons. In 2010 I became a full-time freelancer. I have lived in 4 countries, two of which don’t use roman characters. I once named a French wine for the Japanese market. I once scored an 18 second animation that was made by Hayao Miyazaki’s nephew-in-law to show him privately as an homage. He wasn’t pleased. My boss once asked me, in absolute seriousness, how much I thought it would take to get Myamoto to leave Nintendo and move country to come work for the company, making plagiarized java games. You read that right. They used a tune of mine at SXSW 2014 for a crowd-controlled game played on a giant screen. I am starstruck at the idea of meeting any famous badminton player. I don’t know how to write a bio and everything you’ve just read I copy-pasted straight from my Tinder bio.\n\nBut most of all, I aim to create music and audio that engages you deeply and that – if applicable – will stay in your head so much that you’ll hate me for it. I like to always try to find something new or unexpected to infuse my work. I’m extremely curious and love to experiment, and I’ll always push things in new directions if given the opportunity.\n\nLinkedIn Profile ›"
