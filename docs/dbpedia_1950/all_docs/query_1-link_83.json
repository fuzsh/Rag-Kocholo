Not reimagine it.\n\nEdited June 12 by Abby_TheLastofUs\n\nI still want a sequel to the 2008 game and a remaster for the ps5! Would plat that game over and over again I swear, it's jsut so much fun!\n\nBut I'll take this until then, the sands of time was always a breath of fresh air\n\nthen again if anyone can fuck it up it's either ubisoft or EA\n\nOmg it's not a fucking remake remake abby....that's just the remake still in the works\n\nOn 6/10/2024 at 10:20 PM, Copanele said:\n\n2026???

They just deleted the original poop remake and they are remaking it\n\n8 hours ago, csakegyuj69 said:\n\nOmg it's not a fucking remake remake abby....that's just the remake still in the works\n\nIt's a \"remake remake\" in the sense that they're having to, more or less, redo everything that was done up until the switch in developers from scratch.\n\n8 hours ago, csakegyuj69 said:\n\neveryone shat on the graphics of the trailer so now they are going back and redoing everything to have awesome graphics\n\nYeah, because it looked like shit. And even then, Ubisoft wasn't satisfied with what the developers had produced either given how much money they had already funneled into the damn thing.\n\nBut that's also on Ubisoft for giving such an iconic game with high expectations behind it to a relatively new and seemingly inexperienced development team, followed by then just handing them money and bailing like an absent father, only to then finally come home after several years and be surprised that said money wasn't being put to good use. There is such a thing as being too hands-off, which is exactly what appears to have happened here. It wasn't just the graphics... but they still were shit.\n\n14 hours ago, Copanele said:\n\nChill your pantaloons amigo 😂 it's just hilarious to me that they release AC and Far Cry games like they're products in a factory yet for some reason a remake of an old game gives them an unusual amount of headache.\n\nAnd it is a remake of a remake, Abby is right. They just deleted the original poop remake and they are remaking it\n\nmate that is exactly why they're having trouble I swear.\n\nYou can't go from copy pasting far cry and assassins creed for years to actually doing something new, even if that new is a remake, in a blink of an eye. 🤣\n\nOn 6/10/2024 at 3:20 PM, Copanele said:\n\n2026??? What, are they brainstorming which part of the original game should they cut just to add it as a \"DLC Super Deluxe Pocket Sand Edition mission \" at $150?\n\nThey had a pre-order bonus with a classic outfit of all things. Ubisoft probably stepped in after all the Valhalla DLC to add classic challenges. 😂\n\n15 hours ago, csakegyuj69 said:\n\nOmg it's not a fucking remake remake abby....that's just the remake still in the works\n\nyou try make a AAA game then. everyone shat on the graphics of the trailer so now they are going back and redoing everything to have awesome graphics\n\nNo one said the graphics have to be awesome, but they should also be up to the industry standard unless you are an Indie developer, which Ubisoft is not. They should also not have an obvious model duplicate sitting in the background. 😂"
