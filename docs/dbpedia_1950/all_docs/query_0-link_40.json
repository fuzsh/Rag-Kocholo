        "text": "Yeah, about that ... I had played the original on the Xbox 360 so during the beginning of the trailer I was thinking \"Oh, yeah, I suppose that's what it looked like when I played it\" only to find out that's their Remake Graphics on the Xbox One / PS4 systems.\n\nThis should not have been greenlit. If a studio shows these graphics at their vertical slice during pre-production, you either send them back do the drawing board, give another studio a chance, or you cancel the project outright. This does more damage to the brand than whatever sales it will manage would recoup. Shit, I'm not even sure it won't simply flop altogether.\n\nGeez, the comparison with the PS3 version (not even PC's!) of Forgotten Sands makes it even more painful.\n\nSo this is apparently coming from Ubisoft Pune. I guess this was an experiment from Ubisoft HQ to see what the studio could do, since they're a former studio from Gameloft (famous for making quick off-brand games for smartphones) that got acquired 12 years ago.\n\nSince then, this studio had only been working on QA for other games and just dance titles. It's definitely not the pedigree we'd expect for picking up an otherwise strong franchise, but it reportedly has over 750 employees!\n\nI do agree that opportunities need to be given to new teams seeking ambitious projects, but that doesn't justify how something like this trailer gets greenlit.\n\nIt's not just bad for Ubisoft Pune, it's bad for Ubisoft and it weakens the value of the Prince of Persia franchise.\n\nI also don't get how they brag about doing motion capture and implementing the latest Assassin's Creed engine for the game, just for everything to look so.. indie-ish.\n\nSo this is apparently coming from Ubisoft Pune. I guess this was an experiment from Ubisoft HQ to see what the studio could do, since they're a former studio from Gameloft.\n\nGreat that they took the time to make the experiment, I expect no less from a huge publisher. But the sight of this thing should never have left Ubi's office. It gives second-hand embarrassement."
