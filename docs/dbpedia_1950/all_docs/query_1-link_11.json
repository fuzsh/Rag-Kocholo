        "text": "April 30, 2021\n\nস্টোরিলাইন ভালই। কিশোর বয়সীদের জন্য ভাল বই। ক্লাস ফোর ফাইভে থাকতে পড়লে বেশি ভালো লাগতো।\n\nবাংলা অনুবাদ পড়েছি। মনে হয়েছে পুরো মুভিটারই একটা লিখিত রূপ। শুধু পর্দায় আরো এক্সাইটিং ছিল ব্যাপারটা। কিন্তু অনুবাদটা বেশি ভাল লাগেনি। অনেক জায়গাতেই আক্ষরিক আর প্রচলিত কথার বাইরে অনেক শব্দ বা বাক্যের গঠন ছিল। যেগুলা আরও সাবলীল হলে অনেক ভাল লাগতো।\n\nRead\n\nJanuary 24, 2015\n\nThe book revolves around the prince having come into ownership of a dagger which lets him turn back time without it being noticed by anyone after the fact, but someone who took over the city wanted to take it back and the princess he is assigned to help princess Tamina also took it from him for a little while. Eventually there is a happy ending and he helps his brother who is starving find chickens on the rooftops of the buildings where he is around looking for a meal. It took me two days to finish\n\nJanuary 16, 2020\n\nI found this at the bookstore for $1 so I got it - mostly because Jake is on the cover. That itself is worth a dollar. Turns out there are some other stills from the film in the middle of the book, so that's pretty cool.\n\nToo bad about the story though. Nothing interesting there.\n\nJune 6, 2013\n\nPRINCE OF PERSIA By James Ponti. 148 pages. Disney Company.\n\nOnce, in a small village, there was a boy named Dastan. He had a brother named Yusef and they were just any people from the village before everything changed for those two boys. One day, some Persians were passing by, and Yusef got on the way of one of the Persian’s horses. The man of the horse feel off and started slapping the boy until Dastan threw an apple at the man. Both of the boys started to run and the Persians at last trapped Dastan. Just before they were going to execute Dastan, the King came and said not to kill the boy and since Dastan did not have any parents the king adopted him because of the skills he saw on the boy and the brother went with Dastan. Twelve years later, the Persians attacked a small city and at the end they asked the princess if she wanted to marry Dastan. The princess refused until she saw the dagger he had. Dastan had picked up that dagger in a war. One of Dastan’s stepbrothers set up Dastan to make look like he killed the King. So the princess and Dastan ran off and Dastan found out that the dagger was a time machine that led you to the past. The princess took it away from him and ran off. Then the two found themselves and at last they became friends and had a journey to bring the dagger to the Gods but one of Dastan’s stepbrother, which wanted the dagger to become a powerful King. This story was interesting because it has a lot of action, however it was hard to follow.\n\nOctober 28, 2014\n\nPrince of Persia : The Sands of Time -- 2,7/5\n\nnah, tamat juga.\n\npunya filmnya tapi belum sempat nonton. Entah kenapa malah baca buku tipis ini duluan. aku sebenarnya lebih berharap buku prince of persia akan setebal the assasin creed. tapi ini cuma 160 halàman, jelas detail ceritanya kurang. apalagi ada sisipan gambar Pangeran Dastan yang cast film. bayangan tentang Pangeran Dastan yang ada di kepala saya tumpang tindih dengan cast itu.\n\nmasih ada sekuelnya ya? endingnya gantung. hm?\n\nNovember 8, 2016\n\nThis is a book for younger readers. I have read it a few times, but I put it down for my most recent one. It is about a man, who was a orphan, but was adopted by the king and ended up having 2 older brothers. During a raid of another land, they emerge victorious, and the Princes gift to the king is deadly, but the Prince doesn't know it. It kills the king & the prince becomes a wanted criminal.\n\nApril 1, 2024\n\nLibro basado en la película, ni más ni menos. No es una obra de arte ni lo pretende, es un libro muy rápido y corto que te puedes leer en un rato. Tiene el inconveniente de que se nota que se apoya mucho en la película o asume que la has visto, por lo que no hay casi nada de descripciones ni construcción del entorno, son casi todo diálogos o secuencias de acción; de forma que si no has visto la película estas desubicada y no visualizas realmente.\n\nJune 1, 2017\n\nIts just write up of a movie , not even a script with details.\n\nDecember 13, 2018\n\nPretty good for a Jr. Novel, but I wish it had the whole ending of the movie in it...\n\nAnd more photos in the middle would've been nice.\n\nJuly 15, 2019\n\nA nice adventures novel is full of romance. Whenever you think of a prince the first name that comes in your mind is 'Prince of Persia'.\n\nJuly 27, 2019\n\nIt doesn't offer much in the way of substance, but Prince of Persia is a suitably entertaining swashbuckler -- and a substantial improvement over most video game adaptations.\n\nAugust 29, 2021\n\nNo esperaba mucho y aún así me decepcionó\n\nMay 28, 2018\n\nMe encantan los videojuegos, la película y el libro también\n\nJanuary 3, 2017\n\nThe way the story was put wasn't very exiting but I like the creation of the story. Because it started with a poor kid who was looking for food in the trash. Then when his owner sent him to get food in the rich city with money. He saw a person getting whipped by the persian army for no reason. So he stood up and threw the apple to the commanders face. Then they chased him on the roofs until he fell into the kings feet. So then the king was so amazed that he made him his new son. After 10 years later the boy and his 2 brother were commanders and they were about to attack a allied city because they found out that they were trading weapons with the enemies. Without their fathers permission they attacked the city and they planned it out. While the walls were broken. The boy and his men went to the temple to attack the leaders. The princess had the power and gave it to their best soldier to run away with it. Then the boy found their soldier and they had a sword fight and got back the power\n\nThe boy trapped the princess and the boys brother was about to behead her since she didn't tell where her secrets are. Then the boy knocked the sword away and spared her. After the war they had a feast. When the King had the toast drink. He died after that and they found out someone poisoned him. Then the boy and the girl became friends. Then the boy got accused of poisoning the king by his own brother. So the boy and the girl got kicked out. Then he secretly went back to tell his uncle of what his brother is doing to become the king. But then he later realizes that he poisoned the king so his brother can over take the throne. So then they had an epic battle and the boy won and became the king and went back to his original home.\n\nThis entire review has been hidden because of spoilers.\n\nOctober 1, 2010\n\nAs a teacher it is my responsibility to read over all the books I bring into my classroom for my students. This junior novelization of this movie appealed to many of the boys in the room, but I wasn't entirely sure because I didn't necessarily feel the movie was exactly geared for young kids. The movie had a great deal of death and fight scenes, so while I knew the book was going to follow the storyline of the movie, I just wanted to make sure it wasn't too graphic.\n\nThe book is most certainly easy reading and it will be a fun read for most students, especially those that love this game or fantasy adventure novels. The story is short, the sentences easily digestible by readers at the 7th grade level, and the story doesn't require a lot of thought. I found the book not to be graphic in the description of deaths and the there is nothing objectionable in terms of language or sex. The Harry Potter books are more controversial.\n\nStudents will enjoy this book especially after they have seen the movie. This was a good addition to my classroom library.\n\nJanuary 24, 2014\n\nSudah lama beli buku ini tapi belum terbaca sampai hari ini.\n\nPada dasarnya buku ini adalah film Prince of Persia itu sendiri, cuma perbedaannya adalah buku ini tidak seseru filmnya.\n\nMungkin karena buku ini terbitan Disney jadi agak sedikit 'maksa' walaupun sebenarnya aku senang-senang aja bacanya. Tapi kembali lagi, aku nggak begitu suka. Mendingan nonton filmnya karena Jake Gyllenhaal ganteng banget.\n\nOke, deh.\n\nAugust 10, 2016\n\nKing Sharaman adopts a street urchin named Dastan. Little did he know that his adopted son would be the driving force behind saving his kingdom from his brother, and royal advisor, Nizam. A good example of why movies, and their adaptations, are worse than real books. I certainly hope the movie is better than the adaptation.\n\nMay 19, 2011\n\nPasir waktu, Persia, Kerajaan, Perebutan kekuasaan, Puteri cantik.\n\nOctober 25, 2011\n\nThe story is based on the movie script, and I love the movie.\n\nMarch 27, 2012\n\nlost of action and fantasy very good\n\nMay 17, 2013\n\n3.5\n\nEasy to read. The font was huge (which is a plus for me). Liked the artwork inside the book."
