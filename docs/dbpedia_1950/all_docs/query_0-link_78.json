        "text": "Persia as a place doesnât seem like an ideal setting for a video game but it is home to one of the most iconic individuals in the business today, the Prince of Persia. He was born way back in 1989 when a man by the name of Jordan Mechner developed Prince of Persia for PCs using a technology called Rotoscopy. The game was probably the first platformer ever developed complete with evil Vazirs, deadly spike traps, rickety platforms and not to mention the traditional damsel in distress. Once the franchise was picked up by French publisher/developer Ubisoft they transformed it into one of the most popular franchises in recent times and even though there hasnât been any official announcement till date, the world eagerly awaits a Prince of Persia game for next gen consoles. But till then, why donât you just sit back, relax and try out Gameloftâs mobile version of The Two Thrones which is as good if not better than the console version.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow unlike its console version, the mobile version of this game doesnât bother with a story and through still pictures of half naked moaning women (donât ask) you come to know that your kingdom is under attack from an evil Vazir and you and your tweaked out alter ego, The Dark Prince have to save it from his clutches. The single player campaign is divided into seven chapters which can be finished pretty quickly except for the last chapter that may tempt you to eat your phone. Once youâre done with the single player campaign you can tackle the survival mode which as the name suggests has you taking on a barrage of enemies in an attempt to see how long you can survive the onslaught.\n\n__PAGEBREAK__\n\nLike a lot of Gameloftâs action titles, The Two Thrones is 2D side scrolling platformer that allows you to play as both the light hearted Prince as well as his tweaked out alter ego, the Dark Prince. Just like in the console version each mission offers a healthy balance of action as well as platforming elements and what impressed me the most was that even though itâs a 2D game, the Prince boasts of a well detailed repertoire of moves and finishers. Platforming, which basically translates to jumping, wall running, swinging etc. is a breeze to pull off as well and youâll only get a bit frustrated (itâs a PoP game at the end of the day so deal with it) during the timed missions (which are very few anyway). If you donât feel like hammering away on the 5 key you can take enemiesâ down in a single swipe thanks to some pretty nifty stealth kills but once youâre up against the bosses, itâs back to hammering the 5 key to weaken them and finishing them off using context sensitive actions.\n\nOne thing that the mobile version does better than itâs console counterpart is that it makes your life easier with the use of liberal checkpoints which means that anytime you die in the game youâll hardly have to backtrack (Bravo!). On the flip side the gameâs pretty short and there isnât a ton of enemy variety as well; you have your minotaurs, zombies and guards. As far as sound goes youâre not going to get anything over here except for a couple of bleeps and a highly annoying drum roll that kicks in as and when you kill someone.\n\nMinor annoyances aside this game is a blast to play and Gameloft has done a brilliant job in porting all the platforming as well as action elements to mobile phones; if you like the franchise&mldr; scratch that, if you like action platformers, you owe it to yourself to play this game."
