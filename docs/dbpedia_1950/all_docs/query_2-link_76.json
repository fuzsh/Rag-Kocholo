        "text": "Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time (film) In the 6th century, a Persian street urchin named Dastan, after defending a boy caught stealing an apple, is spared, and then adopted by the noble King Sharaman. He is raised alongside Sharaman’s sons Tus and Garsiv, and grows into a strong young warrior. Later, Dastan, driven to prove his worth, leads an attack on Alamut, a peaceful holy city which is reported by spies to be supplying weapons to Persia’s enemies. When the king is assassinated and Dastan is accused of the crime, he must join forces with a feisty and exotic princess, Tamina, to prevent a villainous nobleman from possessing an ancient dagger capable of releasing the Sands of Time, a gift from the gods that can reverse time and allow its possessor to rule the world.
