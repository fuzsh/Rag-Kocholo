It was at this point that Mechner got an unexpected puzzle idea and questioned what would happen if one of the game's fall-away floors fell on a trap tile below.\n\nPrince of Persia's entanglement with Hollywood continued in 1988 when one of Mechner's colleagues insisted that he add combat to the game. The response was ambivalent at first, but he was jolted toward the end of the year when he played a near-complete version of the game and found that it simply wasn't that fun. Mechner concluded that Prince of Persia, as it was, lacked clear goals, a visual indicator of progress, setbacks and triumphs, and human opponents blocking players from the the final goal. \"Everything should move you closer or further away from your goal, otherwise it's just window dressing,\" he said. In an attempt to address these issues -- and capture \"that Indiana Jones feeling\" -- the game's scope was dramatically reduced (from 50 levels to ten) and the level editor was thrown out entirely.\n\n[Credit: Ricky Derocher; source: MobyGames]\n\nMechner turned to film yet again in order to capture the spirit and motion of Prince of Persia's sword duels. The Adventures of Robin Hood (from 1938 and starring a 28-year-old Errol Flynn) served as inspiration, with Mechner studying and deconstructing the fights to find their most fluid and elegant parts -- he eventually lifted about 6 seconds of profile footage for his game. Given its indispensable contribution to the Prince of Persia franchise, it's hard to believe combat was such a late addition before the Apple II version saw its gold master in September 1989.\n\nAt this point, many players have discovered and enjoyed the game in conversions that are far removed from that Apple II debut -- the classic version was included in certain editions of Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time, the SNES version was included in Wii copies of Prince of Persia: The Forgotten Sands, and an excellent Gameloft remake is available on Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation Network.\n\n\"I think it's really cool that Prince of Persia, 25 years later, we're still talking about Prince of Persia, and that Prince of Persia games are still being made, and that there have been so many versions of it over the years,\" Mechner told me after his presentation. \"And not just games, but also the movie, the Lego, graphic novels. So, yeah, the original game is what started it all, but more people have discovered it through the later versions than was even possible.\""
