        "text": "It was inevitable—retailers are vying for your Prince of Persia Forgotten Sands purchase and are pulling out the preorder bonuses to win you over. If you preorder from Gamestop you get a code to unlock the Forgotten Arena mode, which is basically an endurance challenge that throws more and more enemies at you in waves. Amazon shoppers will get a $5 discount on the Prince of Persia Gameloft mobile game.\n\nIf Best Buy is your retailer of choice, you’ll get a playable skin that makes the Prince look like the Sandwraith. He took on this ghostly, tortured form in Warrior Within, which allowed him to stalk his past self and rewrite history. It’s a nice piece of continuity and the wraith looks great in HD, but I’m sure some fans would have preferred a chesty Jake Gyllenhall skin based on the new movie.\n\nKeep in mind these bonuses are exclusive to the PS3 and 360 versions—we’ll have to wait and see if the distinct Wii version gets any preorder goodies."
