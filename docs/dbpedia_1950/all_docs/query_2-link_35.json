        "text": "Ubisoft has given a brief update on its missing in action Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time remake, which has had a troubled development and still lacks a formal release date.\n\nOriginally announced back in 2020 for release the following year, work on the game was rebooted when development dragged on and the project was then moved from Ubisoft Mumbai to Ubisoft Montreal.\n\nUpdates from the project have since been scarce, though Ubisoft broke cover last night to state that the game was still very much in development and had recently \"passed an important internal milestone\".\n\n\"Development is progressing,\" Ubisoft said. \"We look forward to sharing more in the future!\"\n\nThe update comes as a bit of a surprise, as Ubisoft previously said it would have nothing more to share in 2023. Indeed, producer Jean-Francois Naud said fans \"should not expect to hear more about the game this year\" back in May - but perhaps there's still time for something more, maybe at The Game Awards next month?"
