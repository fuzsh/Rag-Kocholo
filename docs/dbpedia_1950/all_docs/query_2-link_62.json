        "text": "Ubisoft has confirmed that the upcoming Prince Of Persia: Sands Of Time Remake will release before April 2022.\n\nREAD MORE: The best thing I bought on Steam wasn’t even a video game\n\nIndustry analyst Daniel Ahmad confirmed the details of the conference call on which the news was announced on Twitter yesterday (May 11).\n\nInitially scheduled to release on January 21, the game was delayed by Ubisoft on December 8 last year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPrince Of Persia: Sands of Time Remake was then indefinitely delayed at the beginning of this year, as the team stated they needed “more time to complete the game”.\n\nReleased in 2003 for the PlayStation 2, Xbox and GameCube, Prince Of Persia: Sands Of Time was a platforming action-adventure game. Sands Of Time itself was a reboot of the 1989 SNES game, Prince of Persia.\n\nThe earnings call also highlighted Ubisoft’s fiscal performance. Despite the ongoing global COVID-19 pandemic, last year was one of Ubisoft’s strongest performing years since 2012 – 2013.\n\nRecommended\n\nAssassins’s Creed Valhalla was one of the company biggest releases during that period. Net bookings increased 50 per cent year-on-year for the franchise and Valhalla was also the fastest selling game in the series so far.\n\nUbisoft confirmed several upcoming titles will also release before April 2022. These include the open-world sports game Riders Republic and Roller Champions, a free-to-play competitive multiplayer sports game.\n\nUbisoft’s financial report arrives almost a year after sexual misconduct allegations filed within the company were leaked publically. CEO Yves Guillemot responded to the allegations by pledging a company-wide overhaul of new measures to combat sexual harassment and misconduct.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nElsewhere, Sony reportedly told analysts that it expects PlayStation 5 console shortages will continue until next year.\n\nHigh-demand and “scalping” have caused ongoing shortages of the consoles since its November 2020 release. Numerous retailers have introduced steps to combat online scalping."
