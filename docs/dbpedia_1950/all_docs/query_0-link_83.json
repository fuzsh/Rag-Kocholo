        "text": "Prince of Persia: Warrior Within has finally made the leap from console to iPhone.\n\nThe death-defying action game is now available on the App Store, coming to iPhone and iPod touch by way of an earlier console release.\n\nGameloft is the first publisher to attempt the ambitious feat of porting a full console game to Apple handhelds having done so already with Driver and Rayman 2 - no compromises, no cuts, just the full PlayStation 2 game optimised to run on iPhone.\n\nIt's an impressive technical accomplishment, to say the least.\n\nOur preview of the game last month hinted at some potential issues with the technical performance, though hopefully these have been cleared up.\n\nThe game consists of 12 chapters chronicling the Prince's effort to destroy the powerful relic known as the Sands of Time.\n\nWhile the original console version had twice as many chapters, it's not clear if the 12 in this iPhone version are just the first dozen chapters or enlarged to include all 23 from the original release.\n\nPrince of Persia: Warrior Within is available for iPhone and iPod touch at a price of $9.99/Â£5.99."
