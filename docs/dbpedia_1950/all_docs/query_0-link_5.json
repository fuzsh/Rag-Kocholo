        "text": "Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time is a 2D action platform game for mobile phone based on the better known 3D action platform game of the same name. The Vizier of the Maharaja of India betrayed his master and helped the Persians to sack his master's palace in exchange for a magical dagger. Thing go horribly wrong after the prince steals this magical dagger from the Vizier.\n\nGameplay incudes platforming and defeating enemies with a sword. Along the way new abilities are acquired to overcome obstacles like running along the wall, wall jumping and rolling. Enemies include bats and sand creatures with hammers or a bow. After a sand creature is defeated the prince has to finish it off with the dagger to kill it for good. If this move isn't performed, the creature will rise again. Sometimes crates have to be moved to reach certain places. Potions for restoring health and upgrading max health can also be found."
