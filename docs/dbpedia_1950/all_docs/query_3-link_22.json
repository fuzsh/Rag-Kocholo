        "text": "1 person found this review helpful\n\n0\n\nThe game in itself is pretty good, be it that the camera and waves of enemies are pretty bad, but it's an old game and is understandably pretty dated and in its infancy. However, ther's one scene in the game, the elevator, that should have been cut in atari 2600 days, but Ubisoft being Ubisoft, they didn't. Ubisoft has always been good at graphics but mediocre to (very) bad at gameplay (excluding rayman series), and this scene really showcases Ubisofts lack of knowledge and skills in this department on an epic scale (don't care how old the game is, if you develop a fight where you have to defend someone I'm willing to put up with the camera, but not with controls that lath unto an enemy while you have to go around fast, making it nearly impossible to do it, that's not an old game thing, that's a Ubisoft thing. (I'm a big fan of AC Creed but they always lack in gameplay and fighting when compared to other contempory games). Since, it's not on an emulator you have to do the fight all over again (no savestates) ans see what you're controller has cooked up for you this time. But overall, game has pretty good platforming and good ideas (no doubt from a good creative team who probably (like ac creator) don't work for Ubisoft anymore.\n\nBut this version is pretty bad. Steam en Ubisoft were too busy cashgrabbing to provide some patches for it too work properly on modern systems. After you are initially greeted with a blank screen it's not so hard to set it up properly with the help from some (unpaid might I add)forum members. This requires a bit of know how that's a little beyond basic. So, many gamers who aren't that much into the whole pc config thing and just want to play a game can say bye bye to their cash while Steam and Ubisoft are laughing all the way to the bank. The making of a seperate config file and releasing it as optional patch couldn't take more than one hour of work from on of both companies. But apparantly they couldn't be bothered as long as they get their monry, there really is no problem. Quality products are probably not something they are aiming for or can be bothered with. The key binding in this version of the game is atrocious (it refuses to acknowledge the existence of two of my official xbox One controller buttons) and the input lag is a real problem at some points. Sometimes I start the game and the screen goes mental on me, straight alt F4 won't take it out of the game (so maybe use something as super F4 if you're as dumb as me and bought this version of the game) and because the screen is all messed up there's nothing left except hard resetting your PC (a very big NONO) which I have been forced to do. To summarize: not a bad game, can see why it's a classic. But if you really want a joyful experience FOR THE LOVE OF GOD DON'T PAY FOR THIS CASHGRAB VERSION BUT USE AN EMULATOR INSTEAD.\n\nNo one has rated this review as helpful yet\n\n0\n\nNot Recommended\n\n1.8 hrs on record\n\nthe movement is amazing and the combat is decent, but dear lord the amount of jank here is too frustrating. constant camera changes throwing off your jumps and a combat tutorial that keeps throwing enemies at you to do a specific move but doesn't register that you actually did it stopping you from continuing the game. There are probably ways around these issues but having to spend hours researching forums and installing fixes itsn't worth my time especially when there are superior PoP games to play"
