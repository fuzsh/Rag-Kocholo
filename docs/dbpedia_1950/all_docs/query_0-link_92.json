        "text": "Itâs an amazing app and the movement is smooth. Itâs entertaining and the setting of Persia adds like a reasonable state to the choice of clothing and hair. But I have two things that might make it way better, at least for me. They are so small that I didnât want to give it a 4 and a half rating. One: Maybe you can play it horizontally so the control to move left or right can be more comfortable. Also, the spikes usually come from out of nowhere and I (probably not the only one) who does way to much. I should be more patient but itâs happened too many times. But these are what feel/experienced. Itâs still a good game, and like I said, these problems are really small and didnât stop me from putting in 5 stars. So yeah thatâs my review. 5/5 would keep it alive. (Sorry).\n\nAfter seeing this game through an ad, I immediately wanted to check this game out due to itâs gameplay similarity to Geometry Dash. The graphics are very commendable especially from Ketchapp. The models are nice to look at, the animations are smooth, and the level backgrounds add a lot to the environment. The only nit picks I have are with the gameplay and how precise they can be, and I also recently found a glitch that prevented me from beating a level. It was a level sequence where the player would drop down five levels of platforms, three blocks long with two spikes on the left side, however on the last step the player just dies no matter where I jump. Iâve tried doing this with both control modes, Iâve tested where the jump will land and it did not change anything. Somehow there must be a broken kill-some area on one of those platforms, so I do hope that this is fixed\n\nSo far this has been one of the best parkour games I have ever played. donât listen to all of the reviews some of these people have posted. they have no idea what theyâre saying. If youâre stuck on a level, just wait until you get a chance to skip it for an ad. if you donât like getting ads, then just turn your WiFi off. Easy as that. smh... so first off, animations are just super smooth and nice to play, the game is also very fun and addicting and the graphics, models, and clothes are pretty good. donât know why they stopped updating this game."
