        "text": "After the relative disaster that was Prince of Persia 3D, it seemed a bit odd that someone still wanted to make another 3D version of the game. Except this time, it was created by UbiSoft Montreal, and they actually turned it into an amazing game by essentially starting the franchise from scratch. The creative director of The Sands of Time was Patrice Désilets, who later created the Assassin’s Creed franchise, while Jordan Mechner contributed the story and stood by the team as an advisor.\n\nThe hero is an entirely different Prince from the old games – here he’s following his father into invading another kingdom. During the battle, he seizes a mysterious artifact known as the Dagger of Time, and in the process, releases an evil that turns nearly everyone in the castle into sand demons. This dagger allows him to control time – this allows for a whole bunch of nifty powers, but mostly importantly, you can turn back time to undo any of your mistakes.\n\nAs if that innovation alone wasn’t awesome enough, UbiSoft went ahead and rewrote all the rules of platforming – it’s rare that you actually have to jump from platform to platform. Instead, you’re given a prince that has all of the swift moves of a ninja. Each room is a puzzle of crazy architecture that you solve by running along walls, swinging on poles or climbing up columns. It gives the same sense of spiraling vertigo that the old games did fifteen years prior, but with less frustration. The incredible fluidity of the Prince’s movements are what makes this a true sequel to the original Prince of Persia.\n\nAs for the moves, the team was inspired by Hong-Kong action movies such as Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and the Jet Li action films. We also watched several Capoeira documentaries – it’s a Brazilian fighting style that intricately melds martial arts with stylized dance.\n\n– Yannis Malat, producer\n\nThe castle as a whole is a grand masterpiece, perhaps only rivaled by the architecture in Ico, and it comes as no surprise that Fumito Ueda’s creation had a direct influence on the visual direction for The Sands of Time. The camera alternates between the behind-the-back and fixed camera angles, so there’s rarely a problem in judging distances. Each location also has a scenic view you can switch to via button press. There are also a few puzzles, which mostly consist of pulling levers and pushing boxes.\n\nWhile most of the game is spent crawling up ledges, running through the usual series of dangerous traps and dashing up walls, you do spend a fair amount of time fighting monsters. The combat system feels a bit sluggish at first, but the Prince has a fair number of moves that allow him to block, react and attack enemies swiftly. His most impressive move is when he strikes enemies while leaping over their heads, for which the game likes to switch to a particularly cinematic camera angle.\n\nAll enemies have to be finished off with the Dagger of Time, lest they stand right up again. The Dagger can also be used to turn enemies into sand statues, which leaves them open to be cut in half. The only real challenge is that the game tosses a ton of enemies at you at one time, often for a period of several minutes before you get to move onto the next segment. The battles are still fun, but they’re really just intermissions between the real meat of the game.\n\nThe Prince narrates the tale through the game, and while he’s an arrogant, unlikable bastard (with a slightly lame visual design), it’s easier to find sympathy for his ally by necessity – Farah, the bow-wielding princess of India. Since the Prince belongs to the army that invaded her country, she’s sceptical towards him at the beginning, but soon the two recognize they have to work together as the only two human beings left. She acts as your guide and helps you solve puzzles, and also provides backup in combat from a distance. Surprisingly, the love/hate banter between the two is written as well as it is acted, and actually adds a little bit of emotion to the plotline. In a way, Farah finally gave Mechner the opportunity to realize his “princess and mouse” idea for the never created Prince of Persia 3 – except the princess was the mouse.\n\nThe Progenitor of Farah is not the princess in Prince of Persia 1, but the mouse. The little white mouse that, when the Prince gets himself stuck at a certain point, (…) comes through the bars of the gate, steps on the pressure plate and allows him to continue.\n\n– Jordan Mechner, Interview with Gamespot\n\nEverything about this game is so extraordinarily well done, that the only thing lacking is the anticlimactic boss fight (against the evil vizier, naturally, who schemed this all from the beginning) but even that is nullified by the awesome ending. It’s not hard to see why many publications awarded this the Best Game of 2003.\n\nThe Sands of Time originally came out for Windows PCs, GameCube, PlayStation 2 and Xbox. Gameplay and graphics are about the same among all versions, although the GameCube suffers a little bit from muffled audio. They have slightly different bonuses too – the GameCube version links up with the Game Boy Advance Sands of Time to unlock new levels in that game, as well as the Macintosh version of Prince of Persia on the GameCube. You can also unlock the first game in the PlayStation 2 and Xbox versions, but you get them by triggering a hidden switch in the game instead. The Xbox version additionally has Prince of Persia 2, but only in the North American release. In an amusing nod to the series’ roots, if you enter a code after beating the game, you can play a 3D model of the first level of the original Prince of Persia, even though it’s missing most of the hidden areas. The enemy won’t spawn either, so you can go directly to the exit, which leads to a room full of beer and a huge poster of the development staff.\n\nIn 2010, UbiSoft decided to give The Sands of Time and its two sequels, Warrior Within and The Two Thrones, a facelift. Released as Prince of Persia Trilogy HD for the PS3, these new versions polish up many of the textures to make the game look better in HD resolutions. Although the 3D models are mostly the same, the change is very noticeable, as can be seen on the screens below. Since this compilation is a PS3 exclusive, a big bullet point for its marketing was the support of 3D hardware.\n\nThe PC version is available DRM free at GOG.com.\n\nScreenshot Comparisons\n\nPrince of Persia: The Sands of Time – Game Boy Advance (2003)\n\nPrince of Persia: The Sands of Time – Mobile (2004)\n\nSeries Navigation<< Prince of Persia 3DPrince of Persia: Warrior Within >>"
