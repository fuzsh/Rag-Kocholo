        "text": "When is the Prince of Persia The Sands of Time remake release date? Back at Ubisoft Forward 2020, a remake of cult platforming classic ‘Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time’ was announced. However, the game has run into numerous roadblocks throughout its development so far, and its launch date has subsequently been delayed multiple times. e now have a new Prince of Persia The Sands of Time remake release date window locked in.\n\nHaving originally released in 2003, the tale of the unnamed Prince has since been enjoyed by millions the world over. The Sands of Time series would go on to produce two direct sequels: 2004’s ‘Prince of Persia: Warrior Within’ and 2005’s ‘Prince of Persia: The Two Thrones’. Additionally, Ubisoft later released ‘Prince of Persia: The Forgotten Sands’ – which served as a narrative gap-filler between the first two games – in 2010. Fans are desperate for the series to be back in some capacity, so when can we expect this Sands of Time remake?\n\nPrince of Persia The Sands of Time remake release date window\n\nThe Prince of Persia Sands of Time remake will arrive some time in 2026. This broad release window was confirmed by Ubisoft during its 2024 Ubisoft Forward presentation.\n\nThe game has been delayed several times. Having originally been given a January 21, 2021 launch date at 2020’s Ubisoft Forward event, the remake was initially delayed to March 18, 2021. It was then indefinitely delayed when Ubisoft took to Twitter on February 5, 2021 to share the news. Ubisoft PR lead Antoine Leduc-Labelle told The Verge back in 2022 that Ubisoft was “no longer targeting a FY23 release” for the Sands of Time remake.\n\nNow, we finally have a new release window that sounds realistic enough for Ubisoft to not delay the game again.\n\nPrince of Persia The Sands of Time remake platforms\n\nWhen it was first revealed, Ubisoft said that the Sands of Time remake was going to be released on PS4, Xbox One, and PC. However, its most recent update during 2024’s Ubisoft Forward didn’t mention platforms at all.\n\nWhile we still fully expect it to release on PlayStation and Xbox platforms, we’re unsure if it will still be coming to last-gen consoles. With how many times the game has been pushed back and the fact we won’t be seeing it until 2026, Ubisoft could choose to enhance the game even further and release it on only the current-gen PS5 and Xbox Series X|S consoles.\n\nPrince of Persia The Sands of Time remake gameplay\n\nHere you can find the gameplay overview released at Ubisoft Forward 2020. Here you get to see some early footage of the Sands of Time remake, and hear from some of the developers.\n\nGenerally speaking, the core identity of the game remains the same as the original. It’s still an action adventure game, the levels will be almost identical, and very little is changing when it comes to characters – original voice actor for The Prince, Yuri Lowenthal, is even back to voice and mo-cap him.\n\nHowever, you will see enhancements to the visuals, the combat, the camera, and various other aspects to help modernize the experience."
