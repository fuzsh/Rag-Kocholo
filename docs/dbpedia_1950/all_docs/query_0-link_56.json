The Prince of Persia franchise is a series of action-adventure video games centered around a prince in ancient Persia. The first two games were developed in the 1980s and 1990s. Ubisoft later acquired the rights and rebooted the series in 2003 with Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time, spawning several sequels. The franchise includes games across multiple platforms, a 2010 film adaptation, and is considered a predecessor to Ubisoft's Assassin's Creed series.",
