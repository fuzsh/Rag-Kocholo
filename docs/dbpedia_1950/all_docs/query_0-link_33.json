        "text": "I've been asked by a few people to share my experience about going from well known AAA studios like Blizzard and WB, to a smaller lesser known studio like Bit Reactor. The truth is that there isn't too much difference if you're motivated, looking to improve and most importantly you have good managers, leaders, and colleagues. I view managers like I view insurance companies. Everything is cool when there are no problems. It's only when problems arise, you see who you're really dealing with. Whether it's a small or large studio, a bad manager will kill your experience and your growth. At WB and Blizzard I was given quite a lot of freedom by the Leads and the AD. I initially had to prove myself before this happened, but with hard work and showing that I was dedicated to not only improving myself, but improving the team, I was allowed to investigate new pipelines for the character team. They started out small and grew in size over the year I worked there. In slight contrast at Bit Reactor, I was given that freedom instantly. The major difference is you share a bit more work and because of that, it's harder to hide. But the experience can be quite similar to larger studios. When you're at a smaller company, there is often an expectation that you're going to share more of the workload because a company with a smaller headcount means there just has to be more problem solvers. Smaller companies can't eat the cost like a large AAA studio can, so that freedom to investigate and improve pipelines is earned pretty quickly. If you're at a larger company and want to stand out, looking for pain points in production, finding ways to fix them, and sharing that knowledge with the team is a great way to show that you're thinking about more than just yourself or your portfolio. If you're at a smaller company, see above paragraph. It's the same but just with fewer team members. If you've read this and have a different experience, tell me. Sharing this kind of stuff is important as people evaluate studios in this very rough time in our industry. As always keep pushing for interviews, connecting with people, and building those \"bridges\". Investing in yourself is going to pay off for future you. ❤️ #aaa #videogames #indiegames"
