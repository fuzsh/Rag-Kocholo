        "text": "Gameloft has confirmed that the Prince of Persia series is coming to iPhone.\n\nEarlier in the week, a teaser video was released for a \"New Gameloft game\". Although no name or details were given, it was clear that iPhone gamers would soon be delving into the Prince's Arabian worlds.\n\nThe Principal of it all\n\nIn a Gameloft podcast, the game was revealed as Prince of Persia: Warrior Within. There's also a trailer to watch which doesn't really give anything away about how the iPhone version will play.\n\nThe video shows the Prince running through deserted streets, within a dark swirling force following closely behind. Jump to nine minutes into the podcast to check it out for yourself.\n\nIt's also not clear whether this will be a full 3D adventure like its console counterparts, or a more simple side-scrolling platformer. We'd guess at the latter.\n\nPrince of Persia: Warrior Within was originally the sequel to Sands of Time on the PC and various consoles, so if you've played the time-bending Tomb Raider-like platformer, the story should hopefully follow on from it.\n\nNo word on when the release will be, but we'll keep you posted."
