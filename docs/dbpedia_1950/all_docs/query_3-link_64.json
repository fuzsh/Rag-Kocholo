        "text": "Publisher: Ubisoft | Developer: Ubisoft Montpellier | Platforms: PS4, PS5 (Reviewed), Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, Nintendo Switch, PC\n\n“Mobile graphics trying real hard.” [Carlos, Watchu Been Playin’ 11]\n\nAt first blush, Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown isn’t the most impressive-looking game. It’s aesthetically-pleasing — the boss battles, in particular, shine with excitement and visual flourishes — but it does come off as an elevated mobile game graphically. It’s really no wonder that it runs great on Switch. Everything else, though? Top of the line. The gameplay is buttery-smooth and precise; reminiscent of old-school 2D Metroidvanias where if you’re not perfect against bosses…it’s kind of your fault. Perfect and still not able to take them down? Grab one of many substantial upgrades or amulets to give you an edge. About the only downside is that it takes a while to get going — double-jump is a game changer that should be doled out earlier in the game — but once it does, get ready for those Sands of Time-esque puzzles that push you just enough. And while the game is decidedly old-school in feel, it’s still refreshingly modern when it comes to checkpoints, an innovative memory shard system, and — probably to the chagrin of “real gamers” — a guided system option to give you a nudge when you’re done banging your head against a wall not knowing you don’t have the right ability quite yet. Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown is a side-scrolling gem. Don’t miss it.\n\n“Every time you get a bigger ability, the game sucks you back in. The moment I got my air dash, I was like ‘Yup! Back in it!'” [Dalan, Watchu Been Playin’ 11]\n\n9.0/10 – Buy Now\n\nQuotes from our Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown review discussion:\n\n“You want to drop those memory shards because: ‘Ooh, I couldn’t get over there, but now that I have my MOVES, I can go back to that!'” – Carlos\n\n“That memory shard takes a picture of the entire screen. Why am I not using that?” – Dalan\n\n“You need to not make any mistakes to beat these bosses.” – Carlos\n\n“[Reminds me of] Mega Man X2, almost every single boss, you see that life draining on the boss bar…but you also see your life draining. You know you’re about to die. Last moment, all the platforms are gone. You got one bullet left, you jumped in the air. You shoot the boss, you land on the spikes, but you’re ALIVE.” – Dalan\n\n“That is, uh…pretty much every boss in this game.” – Carlos"
