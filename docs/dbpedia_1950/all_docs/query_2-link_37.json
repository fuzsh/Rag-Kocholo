        "text": "Ubisoft’s Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time Remake has not had the best of time during its development. Announced back in 2020, the game was in the works at Ubisoft Mumbai/Pune, however following a less-than-stellar first showing, the project was moved over to Ubisoft’s Montreal studio with assistance from the publisher’s Toronto branch. During Ubisoft’s Forward Showcase, the publisher officially ‘re-announced’ the game with a 2026 release year.\n\nIn celebration of Prince of Persia’s 35th anniversary, Ubisoft had a little block sectioned out during its showcase dedicated to the much loved IP.\n\nAlongside the announcement for updates to Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown and The Rogue Prince of Persia, the team offered the smallest hint of a second first-look at the since-rebooted Sands of Time Remake.\n\nThough the teaser offered essentially nothing in the way of new details, they did announce that the game is planned to release in 2026.\n\nAs mentioned, following the development struggles, the remake was essentially rebooted and handed off to a different team, and so the extended wait makes sense. That said, with a 2026 release window, it’s clear that things are still quite early.\n\nKitGuru says: What do you think of the teaser? What was your opinion of the first attempt at the remake? Should Ubisoft have even given a release year for The Sands of Time? Let us know down below."
