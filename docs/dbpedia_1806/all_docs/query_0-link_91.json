        "text": "Borys Burrough’s record of the designing, carving and gilding of a new Auricular frame for a rediscovered Van Dyck portrait.\n\nThis journal is a record of the process of designing and making a new frame for a portrait by Van Dyck belonging to the Bowes Museum in Durham. It resulted from a competition which the Bowes Museum instituted in May 2017, for a wood-carving student from the City & Guilds of London Art School to present a design for such a frame; the winner of the commission would then carve the piece as a final year project. There were specifications within the brief: one of the historic frame styles deemed suitable for the painting was Auricular, and I decided that I would create a frame in this style.\n\nAs a woodcarver at the beginning of my career, to have the opportunity to re-frame a Van Dyck portrait is dream commission, especially as I have a particular interest in and history working with picture frames. Before I started my ornamental woodcarving course I worked for the well-known framemaker and dealer Rollo Whately, whose workshop in the West End of London is a treasure-trove of beautiful antique frames. I worked as his assistant for five years, gaining skills in restoration, gilding and toning, and – above all – a love for antique frames. Rollo was able to help me with this commission by allowing me to use an early 17th century British Auricular frame to study, and as a model in my early designs.\n\nIn August 2017, after researching the Auricular style by looking at further examples of frames in Ham House, Richmond, and in the National Portrait Gallery, I made drawings of my design and sent them to the Bowes Museum in a presentation document. Following this, in September 2017 a Memorandum of Agreement was reached, and, after feedback on my initial designs in October (which included a modification of the brief), I redesigned the frame almost completely. I then carved sample sections which I took up to the Bowes Museum in the November, and after this successful meeting I was given the go-ahead to begin carving the frame.\n\nThe monthly journal which follows is a record of the process.\n\nMay 2017\n\nThe brief which I had received announced that the Bowes Museum was mounting a competition for a student from the Art School to create a new frame for the portrait of Olivia Boteler Porter (c. 1630-40) by Van Dyck.\n\nVan Dyck (1599-1641), Olivia Boteler Porter, c.1630-40, o/c, 72.4 x 61 cm.; uncleaned and cleaned states; Bowes Museum, County Durham\n\nThe sitter was Queen Henrietta Maria’s lady-in-waiting, Olivia Boteler Porter (d. 1633), the wife of Anthony Van Dyck’s friend and patron Endymion Porter, whom she married in 1619. While in England, Van Dyck painted a number of portraits of different members of the family. Olivia Porter was the daughter of Sir John Boteler and Elizabeth Villiers, niece of the Duke of Buckingham. The red carnation in her hair might be an heraldic motif, since it appears in other images of female members of the Villiers family.\n\nHer dress is white with large sleeves, with a gold brooch on the corsage, and she wears a pearl necklace and earrings. She is presented within a simulated oval which is larger than the canvas. The painting was identified as being by Van Dyck following an investigation by Dr Bendor Grosvenor which subsequently became the subject of a Channel 4 documentary shown in March 2014.\n\nThe Bowes Museum listed a number of historic frames of the period which were deemed suitable for the painting, from which I chose the Auricular: it was a dominant style from the period when the portrait was painted, and is therefore often found on portraits by Van Dyck. ‘Auricular’ means literally ‘of the ear’, and was a free-flowing interpretation of organic and cartilaginous forms, animal or marine in nature, sometimes combined with foliage and scrolls or volutes. Framemakers working in London embraced this fashion with enthusiasm, using it for pictures from the 1630s to the 1680s (Penny, 2014, p.3). I also enjoy the sculptural nature of the ornament and thought it would be a good challenge to design a frame in this style and would also test my carving skills.\n\nJune 2017\n\nChristiaen van Vianen (fl. 1600-67), The Dolphin Basin, 1635, silver, Victoria & Albert Museum\n\nI began my research by going to the V & A Museum to study the silver Dolphin Basin by Christiaen van Vianen. This is an amazing piece of silverwork, and luxury objects like this (in the popular European Auricular style) were very much sought after. Van Vianen (who worked for both Charles I and Charles II) and Dutch craftsmen like him came to London and set up workshops to cater to this new taste and the growing market it spawned.\n\nTwo great Dutch dynasties of gold- and silver- smiths were involved with the creation of various versions of the Auricular style. One was the Van Vianens – Paulus (ca. 1570–c.1613/14), generally credited with much of the development of the style, and his brother Adam (the father of Christiaen).\n\nIsaack Luttichuys (1616-73), Portrait of a young lady, 1656, o/c, 99 x 82 cm., in original ‘Lutma’ frame; Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam\n\nThe other was the Lutma family, whose name is now given to a type of 17th century Dutch Auricular frame which incorporates flowers and foliage..\n\nJacob Lutma (1624/44–54), after Johannes Lutma the Elder (1584–1669), Festivitates Aurifabris (…) / Verscheide Snakeryen dienstich voor Goutsmits, Beelthouwers, Steenhouwers, en alle die de const beminnen (Plate 4), 1654-78, etching & engraving, 8 7/8 x 7 5/16 ins (22.6 x 18.6 cm.), Metropolitan Museum of Art, NY\n\nDescendants from both these families spread their designs through the medium of engraved prints.\n\nMichiel Mosyn (b.1630), after Gerbrand van den Eeckhout (1621-74), Veelderhande Niewe Compartimente (title page in Latin), c.1650-74, etching & engraving, 9 7/16 x 7 ½ ins (24 x 19.1 cm.), Metropolitan Museum of Art, NY\n\nAnother Dutchman who helped to diffuse this style was the painter Gerbrand van den Eeckhout, who designed several series of prints of cartouches and decorative objects in the Auricular Style; his most famous series was Areolae (above).\n\nI also researched the Auricular by visiting various museums, and photographing and drawing some of their frames to assimilate the style. Amongst others I visited Ham House in Richmond, which holds some of the finest examples of early 17th century British Auricular frames.\n\nSir Peter Lely (1618-80), Elizabeth Murray, Lady Tollemach, later Countess of Dysart & Duchess of Lauderdale with a black servant, c.1651, Ham House, National Trust\n\nUnknown artist (possibly Gilbert Jackson; fl.1621-43), Portrait of an unknown lady in red, c.1630, o/c, 117 x 89 cm., Ham House, National Trust\n\nTwo of the Auricular frames which I found at Ham House greatly influenced my designs: those on Lely’s portrait of Elizabeth Murray with her black servant, and on the unknown lady in red, possibly by Gilbert Jackson.\n\nIn October 2016 a conference, ‘The Auricular Style: Frames’, was held at the Wallace Collection in London, with speakers delivering papers on various different aspects of this subject. After the conference I had numerous meetings with one of the speakers, Gerry Alabone (Senior Conservator at the National Trust and the Head of Frame Conservation at the Art School) who was very helpful in showing me many different examples of Auricular frames from his archive.\n\nJacob Simon, the former Chief Curator of the National Portrait Gallery and author of The art of the picture frame [1], also presented a paper, ‘Documenting developments in the taste for Auricular framing in England, 1620-1700’, which has been particularly helpful for my project. He argues that Charles I and his court were great collectors of European Old Masters, and that these pictures would often have come with elaborate frames, especially those from Italy. This would have created new expectations among collectors for elaborate gilded frames such as the ‘Sansovino’. Most of the frames made in Britain would have been executed by craftsmen with close links to the continent, especially to the Netherlands – from where ideas were imported both through the movement of the craftsmen themselves, and via engraved designs, as we have already seen.\n\nJuly 2017\n\nRollo Whately has an early 17th century British Auricular frame in his collection, and I was able to borrow it for study. During this period British paintings (and necessarily, of course, their frames) began to be standardized in size; for half-length portraits the frame thus has an ideal aperture of 30 x 25 inches, or 76 x 63.5 cm. The portrait of Olivia Boteler Porter measures 72.4 x 61cm., which is roughly in proportion to the standard size, and so I used Mr Whately’s frame as a template for my design drawings, first by creating a photomontage of the portrait within this period Auricular frame.\n\nVan Dyck, Olivia Boteler Porter, c.1630-40, montaged into Auricular frame; collection of Rollo Whately\n\nThe frame is in original condition and has a scroll-topped grimacing lion mask at top centre, with a monster mask at the bottom and stylised foliage. Rollo Whately has dated his frame to the 1630s, and this accords with Jacob Simon’s judgement, given in in his paper at the Wallace Collection conference:\n\nThere were several standard frame patterns which were used in the 1630s and subsequently. For the most part these were frames in the Auricular style. They can be categorised by the differing mask types which crown the frame, or by other distinctive features: The lion mask at top centre and paws, highly stylized. The sides of the frame are like a flat skin, the edges of which are irregular and curling. The scroll-topped grimacing mask at top centre, with a monster mask at the bottom and stylised foliage……\n\nAuricular frame (collection of Rollo Whately); reverse\n\nThe Whately frame is carved from oak which is 2.5 cm. (or one inch) thick, with mitred and lapped construction at the front (after the style of a Northern European cassetta), and an applied pine back frame (which also creates the rebate), secured with tenons. The frame is symmetrical on the vertical axis­­­­­-.­­­\n\nAuricular frame (collection of Rollo Whately); mask at base of frame\n\nIt is covered on the face with a thin layer of gesso, and is oil-gilded in the pale gold with a lovely flat tone and flakiness which is so typically English. In A history of European picture frames, for instance, we are told that frames in the British Auricular style are ‘almost invariably gilded in a blond gold, which picks up the pale skin tones of the contemporary school of portraiture’, and that they also worked by ‘isolating a painting from the dark walls of the period, which would be wainscoted or covered in tapestry or leather’ [2].\n\nAugust 2017\n\nI made my initial design drawings and sent them to the Bowes Museum in a presentation document.\n\nFirst design: replica of Auricular frame, 1630s, collection of Rollo Whately\n\nMy first proposal was a carved replica of Rollo Whately’s frame, made in pine, and of the same construction, with the pine back frame. The width of the frame rail would be 9.5 cm. (14.5 cm. for the mask at the top centre), whilst the depth (including the back frame) would be 4 cm. for the main structure, and 6.5 cm. for the top mask, 5 cm. for the mask at the bottom.\n\nI like the way in which the long sides have cornucopiae curling up from the corners, and flowers just above them which resemble carnations – amongst the characteristic twisting and scrolling Auricular forms. These flowers could be seen as an echo of the heraldic red carnation in Olivia Porter’s hair.\n\nSecond design: a more eclectic solution based on various sources\n\nMy second proposal was my own design, freely adapted from the frame above but incorporating elements from the frames at Ham House, and from other Auricular patterns in Gerry Alabone’s archive. This would be made in exactly the same way and to the same dimensions. There was a new grimacing mask crested by a wavy scroll at the top centre, and the long sides were redesigned to flow in a more ‘feminine’ way. I kept the monster’s mask at the bottom centre, with its bat wings and flanking scrolls from the Whately frame.\n\nSecond design: alternative top mask\n\nI also included a drawing of an adaptation (from my first design) of the mask at the top, because I wanted to substitute two more scrolls for the feline whisker pouches in the original frame.\n\nSeptember 2017\n\nI received a Memorandum of Agreement drawn up by Tim Crawley, the Head of Historic Carving Department at the City & Guilds London Art School; this indicated a timetable for sample sections to be carved and gilded, to be taken up to the Bowes Museum for final approval in November.\n\nOctober 2017\n\nIn response to my designs I received a letter from Matthew Read, who is the head of the new Centre for Art, Craft and Design at the Bowes Museum.\n\nMatthew came to this position and to the frame project after the commission was offered to me in May 2017; his participation was therefore much more recent, and he had new ideas for the type of frame he wanted me to make, modifying the brief from his own point of view, and also incorporating other opinions from his colleagues. This is an extract from his letter:\n\n‘Several members of the Bowes team have reviewed the design and we have the following feedback:\n\nWe feel the grotesques are broadly overbearing in relation to the subject matter and could be replaced with more feminine motifs or themes. Maybe the Auricular theme could be expanded further to include both an historical and modern perspective? I see the frames have both Auricular forms and what appear to be auricular flowers? The auricular flower in modern times has a particular association with the north; the jewel that shines through coal dust and mining grime so would resonate with our North-East audiences.\n\nWe recognise the student has invested heavily in the process of researching the frame. It would be nice to see the student’s personal perspective and interpretation represented in the design and overall philosophy. At present there is a sense of generating what may be regarded as a high quality and skilled reproduction rather than new and explorative work.\n\nA final personal thought, to balance the historic research and retrospective nature of the design, a sense of the contemporary and looking forward could be introduced in the form of some clear space or undecorated sections (consideration perhaps of the sitter and artist as promoting the latest fashion and ideas of their time?) This could of course also be manifested in modifying the nature of angular detail in the carving etc.\n\nWe strongly encourage the student to more overtly make the work their own, to reflect their ownership and philosophy in the design…’\n\nThird design, incorporating suggestions from the Bowes Museum; detail of crest\n\nI began to recast my designs in the light of this response from the Bowes Museum. For example, I replaced the top centre grotesque mask with a more ‘feminine’ cartouche, in which you can make out a vial or bottle, inspired by the story of a poison, ‘Viper Wine’, told me by Matthew Read. Olivia Porter is said to have used this substance, and since she died around the time this portrait was painted, it seemed like a fitting reference to her tragic story. ‘Viper Wine’ was an elixir that ladies in the court of Charles I took to make themselves more beautiful; it worked by numbing their faces and plumping their cheeks, very much as Botox is used today, and (again, rather like Botox) it was in fact a poison made from snake venom, and could certainly have been very harmful, if not fatal.\n\nThird design; detail of ornament at base\n\nI replaced the grotesque mask at the bottom centre with the form of a scallop shell containing within it double pearl drops, which refer to the earrings Olivia Porter famously wore in her portraits. I also cleared some of the space in my design by removing a few more ornate elements and simplifying the forms; and finally I restored the pair of scalloped swags from the Whately frame two-thirds the way up the long sides, since they echo the neck line of her dress, and have pearl drops – again reflecting the pearls contained in the painting.\n\nI sent this design to Matthew Read at the Bowes Museum quite soon after receiving his letter, as I was anxious that we were now behind schedule in the timetable set out in the Memorandum of Agreement, and I wanted to know how he would respond to my new ideas.\n\nI also wanted him to understand the philosophy behind my work. I felt that my design must remain historically faithful to the Auricular style, which – although polymorphous and playful – still has a grammar and an accepted arrangement of ornament which must be respected. If this style were to be subverted too far, I think that the frame might look like a post-modern joke, and would be completely inappropriate for an artist like Van Dyck.\n\nMatthew’s response to this was positive, and I felt that he had confidence in my approach.\n\nSample rail\n\nThe next step was to carve a length of the frame as a sample of the finished piece. This was incredibly useful as it allowed me to see how my design would look like in three dimensions, and – perhaps more importantly – I gained insight into how these frames would have been produced.\n\nFourth design: revisions\n\nFourth design: further revisions; the drawing montaged onto the Van Dyck portrait\n\nI then changed my frame design, starting with the bottom rail. I decided that the shell form in the centre was too obvious, and so I replaced it with a bold clean leaf shape which also forms a sort of residual grotesque mask. In the centre of this I set the pendant double pearl drop which echoes Olivia Porter’s earrings. The flow of the design continues from the centre outwards, with the bat’s wings and scrolls.\n\nI continued to rearrange the design of the long sides, moving the shapes and forms around to get a more fluid feel. Designing these lateral rails has been the hardest part of the whole process, and for some time every variation felt unsatisfactory. I think that this is because the flow created by the top and bottom rails starts from the centres, and naturally takes the eye away horizontally; however, I had been unable to achieve an equally nice vertical movement on the sides. There seemed instead to be an awkward chunkiness about them that I continued to struggle with. After rearranging the flow of scrolling leaves, I added a pair of much bolder primula auricula flowers – at first rising up from the acanthus leaf corners, and later moving them up between the top corners and the swags and pearls.\n\nI also refined the design of the ‘Viper Wine’ cartouche until I was much happier with it.\n\nCarving the design as a sample\n\nI began to carve the trial sections I would later take up to show the Bowes museum.\n\nI modelled the Viper Wine cartouche in clay to work out how it would look in three dimensions, and then I carved a trial version.\n\nI gessoed both of the trial lengths, with a mixture made from whiting (calcium carbonate ground to a fine powder), and rabbit skin glue (approx. 1:10 ratio rabbit skin granules to water). Gesso is mixed to a consistency ideally like that of single cream and brushed on in many layers – ten, in this case. It can be sandpapered when dry, or, in this case, smoothed with wet rags.\n\nI then applied a pale grey/yellow bole. Bole is a coloured clay, mixed with weaker rabbit skin glue, which is used to enable the gold leaf adhere to the gessoed surface.\n\nOnto the bole goes the oil gilding. I used a one-hour size (the glue the gold sticks to): in other words, the size is left for an hour to go tacky, and then the gold leaf is laid onto it.\n\nI toned and distressed both rails, leaving the bottom one slightly cleaner. The mixture I used to tone the gold was composed of dry pigments, pumice powder and watercolour, diluted with water.\n\nNovember 2017\n\nVan Dyck, Portrait of Olivia Boteler Porter, and the trial sections of the proposed frame\n\nAfter I had prepared the trial carved and gilded sections, I went back to the design and revised it further. I then took both the sample sections and the latest design up to the Bowes Museum to show them to Matthew Read; at this point we were also able to examine the trial sections in relationship to the portrait. Matthew was, I hoped, sufficiently satisfied by my work to give me the go-ahead to begin carving the actual frame.\n\nDecember 2017\n\nI now transferred my final design to the wood and began carving the first piece of the frame – the bottom rail.\n\nJanuary 2018\n\nWhen I returned to the Art School after the Christmas holidays I redesigned the side rails of the frame for the final time. Having had a few weeks away from the drawing allowed me to see it again with fresh eyes, and I felt that with the changes I made at this point, the design was much stronger. There is now an S-shaped scroll at the lateral centres, interlocking with a smaller scrolling leaf, from which the design seems to flow away. The ornament feels softer and has a melting quality that I find much more pleasing and in keeping with the rest of the design.\n\nBottom rail carved; lateral rails drawn in\n\nI had been quite disheartened by the response from the Bowes Museum to my original designs, back in October. I thought that the suggestion that the museum did not actually want an historically faithful replica of an Auricular frame was a major setback; I felt very uncomfortable about subverting the style. Now, three months later, I realized that having gone through the struggle of creating an original design I had learnt a great deal more about the Auricular style – and design in general – than if I had been allowed to carve a faithful replica.\n\nWith the carving of the bottom rail complete, and a strong and coherent design for the whole, I was confident that I could create a frame which would complement and even enhance the portrait of Olivia Porter; and also that the design might stand the test of time.\n\nThree rails completed\n\nThe carving finished\n\nThe frame gessoed\n\nThe gilding completed\n\nThe gilding toned, and the frame finished\n\nVan Dyck, Portrait of Olivia Boteler Porter in her new Auricular frame\n\nA note on the Bowes Museum portrait\n\nVan Dyck, Olivia Boteler Porter, c.1630-40, o/c, 72.4 x 61 cm., Bowes Museum, County Durham\n\nThe sitter was formerly identified as Queen Henrietta Maria (1609-1669), wife of Charles I. However, this portrait differs from all known images of the Queen. The sitter was instead the Queen’s lady-in-waiting, Olivia Boteler Porter (d. 1633), the wife of Anthony Van Dyck’s friend and patron Endymion Porter, whom she married in 1619. While in England, Van Dyck painted a number of portraits of different members of the family. The white satin dress with long puffed sleeves was intended as a classicising note of timelessness. Olivia Porter was the daughter of Sir John Boteler and Elizabeth Villiers, niece of the Duke of Buckingham. The red carnation in her hair might be an heraldic motif, since it appears in other images of female members of the Villiers family.\n\nThe sitter is shown half-length. Her dress is white with large sleeves, and has a gold brooch at the front. She wears a pearl necklace and earrings. Her hair is brown and in ringlets and has a red flower in it. She is within what appears to be a simulated oval which is larger than the canvas.\n\nThere is a note in the archive in John Bowes’ handwriting of paintings he bought in the 1860s from Madame Lepautre, one of his regular dealers. This includes a portrait of Henrietta of England (presumably Henrietta Maria, wife of Charles I) and a portrait of a lady of the same period, both bought on the same day. The actual bill from Lepautre for this purchase doesn’t give any details of the paintings – just ‘2 pictures’. John may have written the list as an aide-memoire when he was compiling the catalogue – the handwriting looks more like the 1870s than the 1860s.\n\nThe painting was identified as being by Sir Anthony Van Dyck following an investigation by Bendor Grosvenor which subsequently became the subject of a Channel 4 documentary shown in March 2014.\n\nDiagram from the Bowes Museum, showing how the canvas would be fitted into the new frame (canvas & frame surface are at the bottom)\n\n*******************************************************\n\nBibliography\n\nHubert Baija, Auricular Frames in the Netherlands, conference abstract; Auricular style: frames\n\nD.

The Auricular in its context. The exhibition title is KWAB – Dutch Design in the age of Rembrandt. ‘Kwab’, the Dutch for ‘lobe’, is better translated in this case as ‘Auricular’, the idiomatic name for a type of ornament and the associated style which developed during the late 16th-early 17th century, primarily in The Netherlands. Describing this style is no easy feat without becoming very metaphorical. Art journalist Stefan Kuiper of the Dutch newspaper Volkskrant describes it like this:\n\n‘Its characteristics are instantly recognizable, consisting of everything that is squashy and organic: folds of skin, strands of muscle, ear lobes, bones, spiral shells and slugs. What typifies it is its defiance of any logic. The Auricular has no up or down, no inside or out, there are just free flowing forms, intangible, like cigarette smoke.’[1]\n\nHis is a more charming summary, compared with the Van Dale dictionary of the Dutch language on ‘kwab’ – ‘a soft lump of fat or meat’.[2] It is a style which came – amongst other sources – out of the grotesque motifs which, shortly before, had been all the rage in Italy [3]. The Dutch version of the Auricular gained much of its impetus through the work of three silversmiths – the brothers Paulus and Adam van Vianen, and Johannes Lutma.\n\nAdam van Vianen, ewer with lid, Utrecht, 1614, silver gilt (gilded later), 25 x 14 x 9 cm., Rijksmuseum Amsterdam\n\nThe starting point, as well as the highlight, of the exhibition is the ewer which Adam van Vianen produced in 1614. It was commissioned by the Amsterdam guild of silversmiths, in remembrance of Adam’s brother Paulus, who had died shortly before in Prague. This in itself was unusual, since Adam worked in Utrecht, and most guilds were not too keen to promote work by craftsmen from outside their own city. The ewer was owned by the guild until the latter was abolished at some point after 1794, and in 1821 it was sold for a meagre 166 guilders – in today’s money around €1,600, or £1,400 [4]. Despite the relatively small worth put on it, it was not melted down for its value in silver, but passed into a Scottish collection. Over 150 years later, in 1976, the ewer was offered at auction. The Rijksmuseum was able to purchase it for their collection, for 700,000 guilders (nowadays, around €840,000, or £740,000).[5] It is somewhat surprising that not one of the major British museums managed to or seemed to want to retain it.\n\nThe Rijksmuseum acquired the ewer some time ago, but has only now decided to organise an exhibition around the Auricular ornament which defines it – or, it could be said, around the ewer itself, which helped to catalyze in Amsterdam a flowering of the style which had evolved partly around the figure of Paulus van Vianen at the court of Prague.\n\nAs seems to be a lasting trend in exhibitions, KWAB opens with a video screening [click image to view]. The film that is shown is not a documentary of the style: it is restricted to showing Adam van Vianen’s ewer in close-up and loving detail.\n\nAdam van Vianen, ewer with lid, 1614, silver gilt, detail of lizards inside the bowl; detail of handle\n\nIt is now possible to look at the inside, which is normally hidden – at the lizards nuzzling each other, and the swirling shapes of water snakes and ripples around them. On the outside, meanwhile, a monkey sits at the bottom, carrying a clam shell on its back from which the cup of the ewer pours upwards; whilst on the brim of the cup a female body leans over, and from her shoulders the handle of the ewer flows down the side of the cup, spiralling into the crinkled edge of the clam shell, towards the base. The whole ewer was made out of a single sheet of silver, apart from the lid and inner cup in the bowl. Looking at all these magnified images on the video underlines the importance of this object. The small room which follows the screening of the film offers a sequel to it: several carefully selected objects, prints and drawings outline the birth of Dutch Auricular ornament.\n\nHendrick Goltzius, Bacchus with a drinking vessel, Haarlem, c. 1596, engraving, 25 x 18.3 cm., & detail, Rijksmuseum\n\nAn engraved print by Hendrick Goltzius – whose work the Van Vianen brothers must have known – shows some of the first steps into the world of the Auricular. It is one of his best-known, perhaps: an engraving of Bacchus holding an Auricular bowl (for more on Goltzius’s part in forming the style, see ‘Auricular ornament in Dutch Architecture (1610-1675)’ by Dr Pieter Vlaardingerbroek).\n\nPaulus van Vianen, basin with scenes from the story of Diana & Actaeon (one of a set with a ewer), Prague, 1613, silver, 40 x 50 cm., Rijksmuseum Amsterdam\n\nSuch images were almost certainly present in Paulus van Vianen’s mind when he travelled to Prague. There, in the service of the Bohemian Emperor Rudolph II, and amongst other sympathetic artists, he further developed the Auricular style, and, during his visit to his brother Adam in 1610, probably passed on his enthusiasm for this relatively new genre of ornament. Besides items by Paulus such as the Diana & Actaeon basin, above, the museum is also showing some of Adam van Vianen’s early Auricular work.\n\nThis powerful opening is immediately followed by the central object of the exhibition. In the first large room, the ewer Adam made in honour of his brother stands sovereign, on a pedestal. The room is otherwise filled with drawings, prints, furniture, embossed leather and paintings, offering a wide array of work in the early Auricular style. In this room it is apparent how the design of the exhibition enhances both the artefacts and their placing in the room. If the reflection of the light on the lid of the ewer does not attract your attention, the halo on the floor probably will.\n\nBarend Graat (1628-1709), Pandora, 1676, o/c, 113 x 102 cm., Rijksmuseum\n\nIt is evident that the ewer received wide acclaim immediately after it was made. The Rijksmuseum has assembled three paintings depicting the very same ewer in various sizes. In fact, an entire room could have been filled just with paintings depicting this object (in the Auricular conference, held at the Wallace Collection, London, in 2016, the ewer was the single object to be mentioned in almost every paper).\n\nAdam van Vianen (attrib.), design for a basin, Utrecht, c. 1610-27, black chalk, pen & brown ink on grey paper, 23.4 x 28.9 cm., Nationalmuseum Stockholm\n\nThere are some stunning and evocative designs for metalwork by Adam van Vianen on display, which are almost drawings for sculptures; this particular room reveals more of the ripples caused by the Auricular style in the art historical pond. The design, above, like the related border of the Diana & Actaeon basin, also reveals the accuracy of the 19th century name for the style in its use of cartilaginous and sinewy ornament.\n\nDutch school, gilt leather wall hanging, c.1650–60, Skokloster Castle, Sweden. Photo: courtesy of the Rijksmuseum\n\nLeather wall hangings covered with Auricular ornaments and a table cloth made with embossed leather from Sweden show that the style was appreciated abroad from an early stage in its development (in this context, see too the abstract, ‘Gilt leather: a creative industry avant la lettre’, by Dr Eloy Koldeweij).\n\nThe engraved ornament by Theodorus van Kessel in his Constighe Modellen (or ‘artful examples’), made after designs by Adam or his son Christiaen van Vianen between c.1646-52, probably never assisted greatly in spreading the fame of this new ornament, but did help to spread Adam’s reputation. The Auricular style was also taken up by furniture makers, and several tables in the exhibition show, in their carved wooden bases, how the intrinsic properties of the medium influenced the visual effect of the ornaments.\n\nJohannes Lutma (1584-1669), drinking cup, Amsterdam, 1641, silver, 7.8 x 15 x 20.3 cm., Rijksmuseum Amsterdam\n\nThe silversmiths of Amsterdam (members of the same guild which had ordered the Van Vianen ewer in 1614) also influenced the later development of the style. One of the most important artists in this guild was Johannes Lutma, who came from North-West Germany and had worked in Paris before settling in Amsterdam in 1621. He arrived there too late to have been involved in the commissioning of the ewer[6], but he had been a colleague of Paulus van Vianen, and quickly rivalled the quality of the latter’s work and that of his brother. Like them, he began to sign and date his work. Once more, the work of a silversmith was the subject of famous painters like Jacob Backer and Rembrandt, and Lutma himself was also the subject on several occasions.\n\nPublicity photo from the exhibition showing, centre left, one of the gates from the choir screen of the Nieuwe Kerk, Amsterdam, by Johannes Lutma, c. 1650, brass\n\nThe magnificently elaborate and intertwined brass choir screen which he designed for the Nieuwe Kerk in Amsterdam is one of his best-known works, massive in scale and conception, with a long crest of pierced, spiky waves of Auricular ornament.\n\nThe exhibition widens its focus at this point, and looks at the work of the braziers – the brass-workers – who used Auricular decoration for the furnishing of church interiors. Through this means the Auricular style could spread easily between large cities; and, from the middle of the seventeenth century, objects in this style progressively entered the houses of the middle class. Picture frames and furniture were the first objects available for purchase by a larger group of collectors.\n\nRembrandt (1606-69), The Holy Family, 1646, oil/ wood, 46.8 x 68.4 cm., Museumslandschaft Hessen, Gemäldegalerie Alte Meister, Kassel\n\nRembrandt himself employed Auricular ornament at times, and was also in possession of plaster casts of works by Adam van Vianen, according to the inventory made when he went bankrupt – although Reinier Baarsen states in the exhibition catalogue that the mythological subject matter of these particular objects is more reminiscent of Paulus than of Adam van Vianen. Next to the drinking cup by Lutma hangs a painting of the Holy family by Rembrandt. Within the image he painted a frame-like border and a curtain on a rail; the curving top of the painted border clearly shows Auricular motifs, combined with classically-inclined sides and Baroque ornaments along the base.\n\nNicolaes Maes, (attrib.; 1634-93), The Holy Family (after Rembrandt), c.1646-50, red chalk, blue chalk, brown & red wash on vellum, 22.8 x 27.9 cm., Ashmolean Museum, Oxford\n\nA drawing attributed to Nicolaes Maes, also in the exhibition, gives a better impression of what the original work by Rembrandt might have looked like, with a fully-developed Mannerist arched top decorated with skeletal and cartilaginous forms.\n\nUnknown framemaker, Auricular frame, Netherlands, c. 1650-60, gilded limewood, 55 x 47 cm., Rijksmuseum Amsterdam\n\nFramemakers themselves had a wide array of materials to choose from at this point, since ebony workers like Herman Doomer were changing the variety of woods in vogue for both frames and furniture. For Auricular designs, however, a much softer type of wood than ebony or oak was necessary: something relatively easy to carve and which could imitate the melting forms of Auricular silverwork. For these the framemakers usually preferred to work in limewood, which is quite soft, with a short grain that is excellent for carving the soft and bulbous shapes required. The exhibition shows one especially fine example of an empty Auricular frame from the Rijksmuseum’s own collection. All the motifs in this frame are evocative of marine shapes and sea creatures, with fish- and frog- like masks at top and bottom – although the top corners are carved into elephants’ heads, the trunks transmuting into scrolling spiral shells.\n\nCornelis Jonson van Ceulen I, Portrait of Jasper Schade, Utrecht, 1654, o/c, 113.5 x 91 cm., unknown framemaker, Auricular giltwood frame, 1654; Rijksmuseum Twenthe, Enschede\n\nCornelis Jonson van Ceulen I, Portrait of Cornelia Strick van Linschoten, pendant to Jasper Schade, above; Utrecht, 1654, o/c, 113 x 90 cm., unknown framemaker, Auricular giltwood frame, 1654, & detail; Rijksmuseum Twenthe, Enschede\n\nThis pair of Dutch Auricular frames is far more refined than the empty Rijksmuseum frame; they may have been made in Utrecht, as both sitters and painter lived there, in the city of the Van Vianens [7]. In comparison, the empty frame may possibly have a provincial origin. The Van Ceulen frames epitomize the Auricular style as it was adapted to picture frames, the carving appearing effortlessly adapted to mimic the dissolving forms of silverware.\n\nUnknown painter, Portrait of Nicolaes van der Merct, 1662, oil on copper, 11.5 x 8.7 cm.; unknown framemaker, oval Auricular frame, 1662, gilded limewood; private collection, Germany\n\nAnother possibly provincial example of a made-to-measure Auricular frame is found around the anonymous portrait of Middelburg merchant Nicolaes van der Merct. The framemaker may have been inspired by a source similar to the engraved cartouches published by Lutma and other artists; although again his work is less fluid and well-integrated than theirs.\n\nJacob Lutma, after Johannes Lutma, ‘Hans von Aachen painting Paulus van Vianen in a decorative cartouche, Amsterdam, 1653, etching/engraving, 22.4 x 18.4 cm., Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam\n\nIn the case of the Van der Merct portrait, the frame surpasses the quality of the painting, making it a very interesting object. As the catalogue points out, the Auricular ornaments are combined with classical laurel festoons; this is characteristic of 17th century Netherlandish giltwood frames, which might mingle classical, Auricular and Baroque elements with inventive ease [8].\n\nAnonymous Amsterdam craftsman, dolls’ house made for Petronella de la Court, 1670-90, the Picture Gallery; Centraalmuseum, Utrecht\n\nGerard Hoet, Sleeping nymph in a cave, lying on the left, Amsterdam, c.1674, oil/panel, 13.2 x 16.5 cm.; unknown framemaker, Auricular frame, Amsterdam, 1674, gilded limewood; & above, hanging in Petronella de la Court’s dolls’ house; Centraalmuseum, Utrecht\n\nGerard Hoet, Sleeping nymph in a cave, lying on the right, Amsterdam, 1674, oil/panel, 13.2 x 16.6 cm.; unknown framemaker, Auricular frame, Amsterdam, 1674, gilded limewood; & above, hanging in Petronella de la Court’s dolls’ house; Centraalmuseum, Utrecht\n\nPerhaps even more impressive are the two tiny frames which come from a 17th century doll’s house, owned and furnished by Petronella de la Court between 1670 and 1690. Most of the frames in this particular doll’s house – still completely intact with all its furnishings – are Auricular; two landscapes by Johan van Huchtenburg have very similar frames to Hoet’s, and are of probably similar date [9]. Only the scale of the ornaments relative to the paintings indicates that these frames are not on the large format works we might think that we are looking at in a photo…\n\nGabriel Metsu (1629-67), Man and woman at a virginal, Amsterdam, c.1665, oil/panel, 38.4 x 32.2 cm., National Gallery, London\n\nAuricular frames remained fashionable well into the 17th century, regularly showing up on paintings of interiors, as in excellent examples by Gabriel Metsu and Emanuel de Witte. It is ironic that neither painting is today in an Auricular frame, but on the other hand such paintings usually show rectangular ebony frames hanging alongside elaborately carved gilded settings, which might form a centrepiece, or frame a particularly precious painting. Both styles co-exist happily in interiors where stark black-&-white floor tiles and white walls are offset by opulent textiles and silverware.\n\nJohn Norris (attrib., ?1642-1707), ‘Sunderland’ frame, c.1672-75, giltwood, on Sir Peter Lely (1618-80), Portrait of the Duke of Lauderdale, c.1672-75, o/c, 128.4 x 100.4 cm, Ham House, National Trust\n\nChristiaen van Vianen, Adam’s son, continued his workshop after the death of his father in 1627, moving several years later to London, where he became one of the foremost silversmiths in the fashionable style of the Auricular. This had begun to establish itself in Britain at around the same time, or slightly earlier – at the end of the reign of James I and the beginning of Charles I’s, when the court was open to various influences from the Netherlands and Italy. Inigo Jones and Van Dyck were of major importance in this respect [10] . Auricular ornaments were actually applied to picture frames in Britain before anywhere else, and became fashionable as early as the 1630s. By the 1660s a new version of the style had appeared; these are now referred to as ‘Sunderland’ frames, from the collection of the Earl of Sunderland at Althorp [11]. The major differences between the Dutch and British Auricular style are that the latter is carved in a more shallow relief, and the sight edge is not linear but flows irregularly over the outer edge of the canvas[12].\n\nHans Gudewerth the younger, Epitaph for Heinrich Ripenauw, Eckernförde, c. 1650-1651, oak, painted brown around 1880, with paintings, painted with oil on panel, 340 x 175 cm., Evangelisch-utherische St. Nikolaikirche, Eckernförde\n\nThe last two rooms demonstrate how the Auricular style was expressed elsewhere in Europe. In countries surrounding the Netherlands, the idiosyncratically lobe-like quality of the Dutch Auricular style was not replicated [13]. In the North-German town of Eckernförde, the most important woodworker in the Auricular style was Hans Gudewerth the Younger. As in Britain, he had a different approach to the style, but his was to treat it more in terms of free-standing ornamental elements, rather than as an integrated flow of motifs around the frame – this may seem almost like an anticipation of the Rococo.\n\nUnknown cabinetmaker, cabinet, Paris, c.1640, façades: pine, poplar & pearwood, ebony veneer; interior: ebony, pear wood, ivory, bone, purpleheart, iroko, palisander, pewter, mirrored glass, drawers of padauk, 216 x 190 x 64 cm., & detail; Nationalmuseum Stockholm; detail, courtesy of Nationalmuseum, Stockholm; photo Hans Thorwid/ Nationalmuseum\n\nThe last room is reserved for one of the very rare pieces of French Auricular furniture. As a style it seems to have been a bit too much for the French taste, and it never achieved quite the popularity it did in The Netherlands, Britain, Germany or Sweden: see Marika Takanishi Knowles, ‘Who’s afraid of the French Auricular?’. However, this Parisian cabinet, on loan from Stockholm, is decorated in full Auricular style. It is displayed in a room with four columns, each carrying a screen depicting detailed images of the cabinet; the video can also be seen here. The columns are decorated with black and white stripes, reminiscent of the columns of Daniel Buren in the Cour d’Honneur in Paris…\n\n…and from these columns it’s a small step to the exhibition designer, Keso Dekker, who deserves an honourable mention. He is widely acclaimed as a designer for ballet and dance theatre productions, and has come up with a setting for this exhibition which cannot be overlooked; the graphic quality of his work offers a striking contrast to the 17th century Auricular.\n\nThe Rijksmuseum has published a well-composed book to accompany the exhibition, written by Reinier Baarsen, the senior curator, with Ine Castelijns van Beek. Since no definitive work on the Auricular has appeared in some time, it was decided not to publish a regular catalogue, but rather a comprehensive book, containing a section of catalogue entries. There is a Dutch and an English edition.\n\nKWAB is a very successful example of how a subject with a fairly narrow focus can be the basis for an ambitious and thorough presentation. Based on extensive research, a convincing picture is painted of the rise, blossoming and dissemination of the Auricular style. The exhibition is starred with objects which represent the peaks of their respective genres, and which ride on the expertise of the various disciplines involved. It is definitely worth visiting, and the catalogue is also a valuable addition to any art historical library. One mild criticism: the subtitle for the exhibition, ‘Dutch design in the age of Rembrandt’, following the strong ‘KWAB’, is unnecessary; this show does not need a link to the popular ‘Dutch design’ of recent decades, nor to ride on the shoulders of the giant Rembrandt – ‘Auricular style’ is enough in itself.\n\nThe exhibition runs from 30 June – 16 September 2018 at the Rijksmuseum.\n\n***********************************\n\nMaarten van ‘t Klooster studied art history at VU University in Amsterdam and graduated the Master of Curatorial Studies at VU University and University of Amsterdam.

These motifs derive originally from the popularity of marine ornament in Italy in the 16th century, and the decoration of grottoes, fountains and Mannerist sea creatures designed by artists like Buontalenti.\n\nChristiaen van Vianen (fl. 1600-67), The Dolphin Basin, 1635, silver, V&A\n\nThey also suggest something of the importance of the sea to the Dutch, who were economically partly dependent on the fishing industry –\n\n‘The herring fishery reached its zenith in the first half of the seventeenth century. Estimates put the size of the herring fleet at roughly 500 busses and the catch at about 20,000 to 25,000 lasts (roughly 33,000 metric tons) on average each year in the first decades of the seventeenth century.’ [14]\n\n– but were even more deeply engaged in sea-borne commerce. By the second half of the 16th century, Baltic trade was controlled by the Dutch, who then expanded into the Mediterranean, and in the early 17th century into the Atlantic, to capture trade with the Americas [15]. Marine decoration was therefore symbolic and patriotic, as well as an expression of the intense contemporary curiosity about the physical world.\n\nThe empty frame displayed in the exhibition is also notable, and especially intriguing for the elephants’ heads which are one of its most distinctive features.\n\nUnknown framemaker, Auricular frame, Netherlands, c. 1650-60, gilded limewood, 55 x 47 cm., Rijksmuseum Amsterdam\n\nCornelis Bisschop, Young woman and a cavalier, early 1660s, o/c, 38 ½ x 34 ¾ ins (97.8 x 88.3 cm.), Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York [not in exhibition]\n\nIn his weighty two-volume catalogue of the Netherlandish paintings in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Walter Liedtke mentions – unusually – the frame on the work above, by Cornelis Bisschop:\n\n‘The painting’s carved and gilded frame is remarkable, and possibly original to the picture. The canvas is unusually close to square in format, and neither it nor the frame has been cut down, suggesting that Bisschop himself may have put them together… C.J. de Bruyn Kops considers the frames likely to have been made in the Netherlands during the 1660s. A pair of frames in very similar Auricular style, but without the elephant heads and lion’s muzzle at the top, are original to portraits of Jasper Schade and his wife, dated 1654, by Cornelis Jonson van Ceulen the Elder…’ [16]\n\nThese frames are indeed slightly related, in the similar flow of undulating spiral shells around the frieze; however, the Van Ceulen pair is composed almost completely of marine motifs, with dolphins’ heads at the lateral centres, whilst the Bisschop frame flows less smoothly, and has, as well as the elephants’ heads at the top corners and the lion’s muzzle at the top centre, noted by Liedtke, an ambivalent but earthy animal mask at the bottom.\n\nLeft: Auricular frame, c. 1650-60, 55 x 47 cm., Rijksmuseum; & right: Cornelis Bisschop, Young woman and a cavalier, early 1660s, Metropolitan Museum of Art; elephant’s head corner motif on both details\n\nThe empty frame displayed in the Kwab exhibition is another step on again from the Bisschop frame; it is proportionately heavier and deeper, the Auricular motifs piling up against each other with less control over the morphing of one form into another, while the froglike mouth at the bottom is almost comic in its effect [17]. However, the elephant heads at the top corners are, paradoxically, beautifully integrated into the flow of ornament at that point – the trunks scrolling into the tops of the spiral shells and the ears echoing the lobes of various kinds which fold around it.\n\nThese elephants are striking in their size, and in the way in which they dominate the frame, stretching over almost two-thirds of the top rail and reaching well down the sides. In contrast, the elephant heads on the Bisschop frame are tiny, hardly integrated, and need to be searched for to be seen. They are also more naturalistic, standing out from their Auricular setting, whereas the elephants on the empty frame have been translated entirely into an Auricular idiom.\n\nThe significance of elephants is intriguing; why have they been adopted into the generally marine genre of animals associated with the Auricular (saving the odd lion, leopard, and eagle)? Well, although Amsterdam imported large amounts of ivory by the seventeenth century[18], the whole live elephant was a still a rarity in Europe, known through descriptions such as Pliny’s:\n\n‘…the Elephant… commeth neerest in wit and capacitie, to men: for they understand the language of that country wherein they are bred, they do whatsoever they are commanded… and withall take a pleasure and delight both in love and also in glorie… they embrace goodnesse, honestie, prudence, and equitie…’ [19]\n\nHendrick Gerritsz Pot, The glorification of Prince Willem I, o/c, 1620, Frans Hals Museum\n\nKarel van Mander, writing two years after that translation of Pliny, in 1603-4, states that: ‘The Elephant means the king, and the Egyptians used it to mean that’[20], and Laura Orsi, in an essay which quotes Mander, produces in evidence of this a Dutch echo of Mantegna’s Triumphs of Caesar – The glorification of William I, by Hendrick Pot, where three hefty elephants carry Faith, Hope and Charity along, in front of William of Orange [21]. (This frame is pre-Auricular, with scrolling Sansovinesque cartouches supporting the base). The elephant was therefore just the right material for use in an impresa as a symbol of kingship, good governance, intelligence, and general goodness.\n\nRembrandt (1606-69), An elephant, 1637, black chalk on paper, Albertina, Vienna\n\nRembrandt’s famous elephant, captured in several drawings, is probably a portrait of Hansken, who travelled through Europe from about 1630 to the 1650s and was in Amsterdam in 1637, the date of the drawings. Rembrandt used these observational sketches in two Biblical works – according to Leonard Slatkes, for the animal’s symbolic properties[22]; however, the nature of the drawings is accurate and scientific, in a similar way to Leonardo’s work.\n\nThe Golden Age in the Netherlands appreciated accuracy and scientific observation; it did not only inherit a system of symbols based on the natural world – it investigated that world with more rigour and curiosity than ever before. Anatomical dissection was a part of this; according to Rina Knoeff,\n\n‘In the early modern Republic, the rise of commerce brought with it an advancement and social upgrading of artisanal skills and knowledge. With regard to the investigation of nature, this particularly resulted in the collection and skilful preservation of natural objects and in the development and perfection of techniques of dissection, vivisection and injection.’ [23]\n\nDissection, however, was not purely dispassionate, it was an investigation of ‘God’s divine handiwork’:\n\n‘…an anatomical dissection had the same function as reading the Bible – it was considered an important means to know God, through the works of His creation.’ [24]\n\nThe symbolic and the scientific might thus go happily hand-in-hand.\n\nDr Allison Stielau discounts a direct interaction of this contemporary fascination with dissection with the cartilaginous and lobe-like nature of the Auricular, but admits that there are links:\n\n‘One thread running through discussion of Auricular ornament has been the desire to link it causally to 17th century anatomical research, particularly dissection. While there is little evidence to support this claim, it is undeniable that Auricular frames share with contemporary anatomical illustration an aesthetic of rippling fleshiness.’[25]\n\nPaulus van Vianen, basin with scenes from the story of Diana & Actaeon (one of a set with a ewer), Prague, 1613, silver, 40 x 50 cm., Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam\n\nThe work of the Van Vianens can also hardly be described other than by using words such as cartilaginous, sinewy or vertebrate, whilst the very term ‘Auricular’, even though coined in the late 19th century, pertains to the folds and curves of the ear. However, apart from actual dissections, there was an associated medically-related fashion, as it were, and this was a sort of extension of the kunstkammer, where the collection of objects of beauty, natural interest and exoticism was extended (particularly by doctors) to the collection of rather more macabre items – ‘skeletons from executed criminals and the stuffed skin of a woman… the bladder of a man… a human skin in a frame…a shirt made from human intestines’[26]. The curiosity and freedom from moral constraint which led to these collections was mirrored in the thirst to examine, dissect and display specimens from every available source. The elephants who appeared in Europe seldom did so for long, dying in fires, drowning in ditches, or simply succumbing to the fatigue of being walked across the Continent; and their corpses were always pounced upon by local doctors, and also needed to be preserved from souvenir-hunting collectors.\n\nAll these various concerns and interests could be said to be represented in the form of the Auricular frame. In Britain, the later wave of designs, from the 1650s and 1660s, had a particular name:\n\n‘Leather work’ is how such frames were known in the trade to artists and craftsmen, at least from the 1670s. The name occurs as a ‘leatherwork gilt frame’ in Mary Beale’s accounts in 1677 and 1681, and as a ‘guilt leatherworke frame’ in the records for Peter Lely’s estate in about 1680. The term appears as ‘leatherwork’ in the accounts of Grinling Gibbons for architectural woodwork at St Paul’s Cathedral in 1697 and at Hampton Court Palace in 1701…’ [27]\n\nSir Peter Lely (1618-80), Elizabeth Murray, Lady Tollemach, later Countess of Dysart & Duchess of Lauderdale with a black servant, c.1651, Ham House, Richmond, National Trust\n\nThis relates, of course, to the broken and irregular contour of such frames, and their shallow profile with rolled and concave edges, all of which mimicked (it is supposed) the outline and behaviour of an animal hide, scraped and stretched out to be used for vellum, as a written or pictorial surface, or left in a coarser form, to function as a shield or cartouche. These hide-like shapes were also open to symbolic interpretation, so that they might become the Nemean lionskin which Hercules wore, with paws and lion’s mask carved at the corners and top centre of the frame (above, on the frame of Lely’s Elizabeth Murray), conveying strength and semi-divinity (so useful as a shorthand for monarchy or nobility). The same is true of the eagles devouring serpents which sometimes crop up in the corners of frames.\n\nThus it could be said that the Auricular frame was, in some ways, a collection of ornaments, motifs and symbols which encapsulated many aspects of life in the 17th century. There were marine elements, looking back to fashionable Italian sources – aesthetically unusual and striking, scientifically interesting, but also expressive of a patriotic pride in such things as Dutch domination of the sea (or its British competition). There were features recalling animal skins – sometimes lions’ or eagles’ skins, endowed with their properties of kingship, divinity, courage, etc.; there were sudden topical eruptions, such as the elephants’ heads, with their own symbolism and their own connection with collectors’ passions and anatomical curiosity; there were associated animals, mascarons of Green Men to bring luck, stave off evil spirits or just invoke the beauty of the botanical world. There were more stylized tokens of anatomical knowledge: bones, cartilage, loops and folds of flesh, which represented both the mystery of God’s creation and the pragmatic investigation of its mechanics. Sometimes elements from other frames and styles crept in; floral pendants and swags, bay leaves, architectural mouldings or scrolls, lending a classical cast, a feminine floweriness or Apollo’s gifts of music, art and poetry. All life, so to speak, is there in the Auricular frame.\n\nUnknown painter, Portrait of Nicolaes van der Merct, 1662, oil on copper, 11.5 x 8.7 cm.; unknown framemaker, oval Auricular frame, 1662, gilded limewood; private collection, Germany\n\n***********************************\n\n[1] Stefan Kuiper, ‘Bij kwab zijn er slechts vrijelijk vervloeiende vormen, ongrijpbaar als sigarettenrook’, Volkskrant, 24 June, 2018 – translation by the author.\n\n[2] Van Dale dictionary of the Dutch language, ‘kwab’\n\n[3] See, too, Adriana Turpin, ‘The development of an Auricular style in Florence, c.1600-40’, an abstract, on Auricular Style: Frames, as an indication of Buontalenti’s part in shaping the Auricular, and that of Italians generally\n\n[4] For calculating the historical to present-day value of the guilder; for details of the purchase, see Vereniging Rembrandt\n\n[5] Ibid.\n\n[6] For a rapid overview of Lutma’s output, search the Rijksmuseum’s collection under his name.

This account concentrates upon Kingston Lacy, Dorset (NT) and begins with a brief description of Ham House, Richmond (NT), where at least one later addition to the collection of 17th century Auricular-framed portraits seems to have been provided with a complementary revivalist frame.\n\nFig. 1 Edward Cornelius Farrell (c.1775-1854), One of a pair of silver-gilt dishes engraved with the arms of Fetherstonhaugh within an elaborate cartouche after Stefano della Bella, London hallmark & maker’s mark ‘E.F.’, date mark for1824, diam. 15 in (38 cm), Uppark, West Sussex, NT 138009\n\nAuricular revivalism was apparently rather episodic, not only in relation to picture frames. A pair of silver-gilt dishes at Uppark, West Sussex (NT 138009; fig. 1), was acquired or commissioned in1824 from Edward Cornelius Farrell by Sir Harry Fetherstonhaugh, 2nd Bt., friend and art adviser of the future George IV [1]. Although the borders of the dishes exhibit Auricular ornament in the 17th century manner, this was not a style for which one can claim a conspicuous ‘revival’.\n\nHam House\n\nFig. 2 The Long Gallery looking North, Ham House, Richmond (NT)\n\nThe ensemble at Ham (fig. 2) has been described by Jacob Simon as:\n\n‘…a showcase for carved-and-gilt Auricular frames. The various types coexist happily and create a remarkable spectacle, their intricate forms catching the available light…These patterns could be scaled up or down according to the size of the picture. They are mostly of oak with pine back frames, some with their original pegged mortise-and-tenon joints intact, but further research is needed to be confident about materials and also about the precise status of each frame. Researchers have suggested that various of the Sunderland frames may be later in date.’ [2]\n\nIn 1994, Alastair Laing and Nino Strachey first realised that although the number of pictures in the Ham Long Gallery in 1844 was identical to the number in 1683, some had flown the coop and others were replacements, suggesting that the frames are not all coeval [3].\n\nFig. 3 Sir Peter Lely (1618-80) , Sir William Compton, 1650s, o/c, 48½ x 39 in (123.2 x 99.1 cm), in a later (18th century?) carved & gilded Auricular frame, Ham House, Richmond, NT 1139946\n\nJacob Simon deduced that the Auricular frame of the 1650s portrait of Sir William Compton (NT 1139946) was made to match ‘probably in the 18th century’ (fig. 3). He described the portrait as being ‘housed in an 18th century variation on a Sunderland frame, with rosettes at the top corners’, noting of the Ham Gallery that ‘several of the Sunderland frames are likely to be later copies’ [4]. The history of these additions has not yet been fully clarified, but Laing and Strachey suggest that they may well have continued into the 19th century, which – given the long tradition of antiquarianism at Ham – is very likely. Indeed, there is more evidence at Ham for 19th century revivalism [5].\n\nThe National Portrait Gallery\n\nAn incident at the National Portrait Gallery indicates an early interest in the reproduction of Auricular frames. In May 1871, George Scharf, then the Secretary of the Gallery [6], received the 5th Earl Spencer’s permission to copy frames at Althorp, Northamptonshire. Henry Critchfield, of 35 Clipstone Street, now Great Portland Street, London, who also provided extensive services to the National Gallery [7], then received an order to visit the house and the following month, produced an estimate for new ‘Sunderland frames’, a reference to Robert Spencer, 2nd Earl of Sunderland (1641-1702), diplomat, statesman and the creator of the Althorp gallery, whose name became attached to the most developed form of the British Auricular frame. Critchfield estimated for the reframing of two portraits in the National Portrait Gallery, neither of which is today framed in this style, so the frames – if ordered – have disappeared [8]. Critchfield and Scharf’s neo-Elizabethan frame made in 1865 for the National Portrait Gallery’s portrait of Bess of Hardwick (c.1600; NPG 203) indicates that antiquarian framing was on the Gallery’s agenda [9].\n\nThe Ashmolean Museum\n\nAuricular revivalism also made an appearance at the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford, in the person of Chambers Hall (1786-1855), who bequeathed drawings and paintings by Raphael and other Old Masters to the University collections in 1855 [10].\n\nFig. 4 Sir Peter Paul Rubens (1577-1640), St. Barbara pursued by her father, o/panel, 6⅛ x 8⅛ in (15.5 x 20.7 cm) in a carved & gilded Auricular frame, before 1855, Chambers Hall Bequest (1855), The Ashmolean Museum,Oxford,WA1855\n\nFig. 5 Sir Peter Paul Rubens (1577-1640), St Clare of Assisi, o/panel, 5¾ x 8⅝ in (14.6 x 22 cm), in a carved & gilded Auricular frame, before 1855, Chambers Hall Bequest (1855), The Ashmolean Museum, Oxford, WA1855.179\n\nFig. 6 Sir Peter Paul Rubens (1577-1640), The sacrifice of Noah, o/panel, 7⅜ x 11¼ in (18.7 x 28.8 cm), in a carved & gilded Auricular frame, after 1855, Chambers Hall Bequest (1855), The Ashmolean Museum, Oxford, WA1855.176\n\nFig. 7 Sir Peter Paul Rubens (1577-1640), The Annunciation, o/panel, 5½ x 10⅜ in (14.2 x 26.4 cm), in a carved & gilded Auricular frame, after 1855, Chambers Hall Bequest (1855), The Ashmolean Museum, Oxford, WA1855.171\n\nThe Hall Bequest includes four sketches by Sir Peter Paul Rubens of c.1620 in similar Auricular frames, of which two seem to date from Hall’s time and two are probably later (figs 4-7) [11]. Jon Whiteley observes that Hall bought a set of tools in 1828 and that he made and restored frames:\n\n‘All clearly show his taste for frames carved in a variation of the Sunderland pattern which was common in the 17th Century but must have seemed coarse and heavy to his contemporaries.’ [12]\n\nLowther Castle, Cumbria\n\nFig. 8 Attributed to the Studio of Sir Peter Lely, Portrait of a lady, o/c, 50 x 40 in (127 x 101.6 cm), ex-Lowther Castle, Cumbria\n\nA portrait of a lady, on the art market in 1989, ascribed to Sir Peter Lely’s Studio, was sold ‘in a Sunderland-type frame’ with a provenance from ‘The Earl of Lonsdale, Lowther Castle’ (fig. 8). The carving is flat, with a mask at the centre of the base, and curious bunches of grapes in the centres of the vertical elements of the frame, which seems to be a 19th century creation [13].\n\nNone of these cases heralded a significant re-adoption of the Auricular style for framing relevant 17th century portraits [14]. In fact, and this is probably a result of ignorance, apart from Ham House, I only know of one other collection in which a revival of Auricular picture frame-making can probably be traced and which accordingly forms the substance of this paper.\n\nKingston Lacy\n\nFig. 9 Sir Peter Lely (1618-80), Sir Ralph Bankes, c.1665, o/c, 50 x 40½ in (127 x 102.9 cm), in a carved & gilded Auricular frame, before 1814-15, Kingston Lacy, Dorset, NT 1257049\n\nThe collection of pictures at Kingston Lacy, Dorset, which was given by Ralph Bankes to the National Trust in 1981, has been described by Alastair Laing as ‘perhaps the oldest established gentry collection of paintings in Britain, many of which can be traced back to lists compiled in the 1650s’ [15].\n\nFig. 10 Sir Peter Lely (1618-80), Arabella Bankes, Mrs. Gilly, c.1660-65, o/c, 50 x 40 in (127 x 101.6 cm), in its original carved & gilded Auricular frame, Kingston Lacy, Dorset, NT 1257043\n\nFig. 11 After Sir Peter Lely (1618-80), Mary Bankes, Lady Jenkinson, c.1660-65, o/c, 50 x 40 in (127 x 101.6 cm), in its original carved & gilded Auricular frame, Kingston Lacy, Dorset, NT 1257047\n\nFig. 12 Sir Peter Lely (1618-80), ‘Mr Stafford’: almost certainly Edmund Stafford of Buckinghamshire, c.1660-65, o/c, 50 x 40½ in (127 x 102.9 cm), in its original carved & gilded Auricular frame, Kingston Lacy, Dorset, NT 1257044\n\nFig. 13 Sir Peter Lely (1618-80), Elizabeth Trentham, Viscountess Cullen, c.1660-65, o/c, 50 x 40½ in (127 x 102.9 cm), in its original 17th century carved & gilded Auricular frame, Kingston Lacy, Dorset, NT 1257046\n\nIts founder, the builder of the house [16], Sir Ralph Bankes (1631-77; fig. 9) [17], was a friend of Sir Peter Lely, and four Lely portraits, all of c.1660-65, survive in 17th century Auricular frames: two of Sir Ralph’s sisters, Arabella Bankes, Mrs. Gilly (NT 1257043; fig. 10) and Mary Bankes, Lady Jenkinson (NT 1257047; fig. 11); together with ‘Mr Stafford’: probably Edmund Stafford of Buckinghamshire (NT 1257044; fig. 12) [18] and Elizabeth Trentham, Viscountess Cullen (NT 1257046; fig. 13), who was ‘notorious for her beauty, extravagance and immorality’ [19].\n\nFig. 14 Sir Anthony van Dyck (1599-1641), Sir John Borlase, c.1637-8, o/c, 54 x 42½ in (137.2 x 108 cm) in its original carved & gilded Auricular frame, Kingston Lacy, Dorset, NT 1257065\n\nFig. 15 Sir Anthony van Dyck (1599-1641), Lady (Alice) Borlase, c.1637-8, o/c, 54 x 42½ in (137.2 x 108 cm), in its original carved & gilded Auricular frame, Kingston Lacy, Dorset, NT 1257066\n\nSir Oliver Millar noted of the pair of Van Dyck portraits of Sir John Borlase and Sir Ralph Bankes’s sister, Lady (Alice) Borlase (c.1637-8; NT 1257065- 6), that they are the earliest paintings at Kingston Lacy to have coeval ‘fine Auricular frames’ (figs 14-15) [20].\n\nFig. 16 Studio of Sir Anthony van Dyck (1599-1641), Charles I, late 1630s, o/c, 54⅝ x 43¾ in (138.7 x 111.1 cm), in its original carved & gilded Auricular frame, Kingston Lacy, Dorset, NT 1257097\n\nFig. 17 Studio of Sir Anthony van Dyck (1599-1641), Henrietta Maria, late 1630s, o/c, 53¼ x 43¼ in (135.2 x 109.8 cm) in its original carved & gilded Auricular frame, Kingston Lacy, Dorset, NT 1257101\n\nThe pair of Van Dyck studio portraits of Charles I (NT 1257097) and Henrietta Maria (NT 1257101) have similar frames of approximately the same date (figs 16-17).\n\nFig. 18 Samuel van Hoogstraten (1627-78), Trompe l’oeil of a framed necessary-board, 1662-63, o/panel, 21¼ x 23¼ in (54 x 59.1 cm), Kingston Lacy, Dorset, NT 1257236\n\nThe collection also includes a trompe l’oeil by Samuel van Hoogstraten, depicting a necessary-board within an Auricular frame (1662-3; NT 1257236; fig. 18), which was probably at Kingston Lacy by 1731 and certainly by 1814-15 [21]. Indeed, Kingston Lacy is one of the Trust’s houses, like Ham House and Chirk Castle, North Wales, in which Auricular frames abound. At Ham and Chirk, each panel of the Long Gallery’s woodwork, dating from the 1630s and the 1670s respectively, is hung with a portrait in an Auricular frame.\n\nSir Peter Lely’s The Penitent Magdalen\n\nFig. 19 Sir Peter Lely (1618-80), Nicholas Wray, c.1655, o/c, 45 x 33 in (114.3x 83.8 cm), in a carved & gilded Auricular revival frame, Kingston Lacy, Dorset, NT 1257102\n\nFig. 20 Sir Peter Lely (1618-80), The penitent Magdalen, c.1650-55, o/c, 64¼ x 55⅝ in (163.2 x 141.3 cm), in a carved & gilded Auricular revival frame, partly c.1760?, Kingston Lacy, Dorset, NT1257099\n\nSir Ralph Bankes paid, before 1659, ‘£20’ each ‘w[i]th frames’ to Lely for a portrait of the copyist, Nicholas Wray (NT 1257102; fig. 19), and for one subject picture, The penitent Magdalen, (NT 1257099; fig. 20) [22]. So are we looking at original ‘Lely’ frames around these two pictures? The answer has to be ‘No’. The Wray portrait frame has clearly been cut and lengthened at the sides with a somewhat alien section of Auricular style carving, typical of unexplained and eclectic alterations to other frames in the house.\n\nFig. 21 Fragments of an Auricular frame, carved & gilded wood, Kingston Lacy, Dorset.\n\nA list of leftover ‘Marbles and Carvings’ at Kingston Lacy compiled in 1858 reveals that they included frames and parts of frames. Elements of dismantled Auricular frames survive (fig. 21) [23]. The canvas of Lely’s The Penitent Magdalen has been extended by just over eight inches on the left and the frame has been extensively altered. The obvious areas of alteration are in the cresting and in the equivalent section, including the mask, at the base (fig. 20). Neither looks 17th century, nor does the style of the carving.\n\nFig. 22 Fragments of a picture frame incorporating a male mask similar to that of the frame of Lely’s The penitent Magdalen.\n\nA fragment of a similar male mask (NT1256744.2.2; fig. 22) suggests that The penitent Magdalen frame was originally one of a pair.\n\nThe history of the display of The penitent Magdalen can be traced in some detail. In Sir Ralph Bankes’s chambers at Gray’s Inn, London, it was part of a collection of 36 pictures, which were listed in 1659 [24]. At Kingston Lacy, the picture was first recorded in 1731, when it was treated by George Dowdney, a painter and restorer [25]. It was hanging in the Great Parlour in 1762 and 1772 [26], together with the rest of the Lelys, which indicates that it was hung in conformity with them and so was probably still its original size. The Lely series was seen in 1762 by Sir Joshua Reynolds, who wrote: ‘I never had fully appreciated Sir Peter Lely until I had seen these portraits’ [27].\n\nThe pre-1814-15 picture-hanging diagrams\n\nFig. 23 Picture-hanging plan of the Saloon at Kingston Lacy, showing Lely’s Penitent Magdalen (no. 23; centre top), already extended in size, flanked by two ‘50 x 40 in.’ Van Dyck portraits (nos 22 and 24) of Sir John and Lady Borlase, before 1814-15, ink & watercolour on paper, mounted on card, Kingston Lacy, Dorset, NT 1253625.\n\nA picture-hanging diagram of the Saloon on a paper remnant of a hand-screen (NT 1253625; fig. 23), one of three made before 1814-15 [28], shows for the first time the size of The penitent Magdalen in relation to other paintings [29]. Flanking it was the pair of portraits by Van Dyck of Sir John Borlase and his wife, Lady Borlase (1637-8; figs 14-15) in their original Auricular frames. The Van Dyck portraits are accurately depicted in the hanging diagram as being smaller than Lely’s extended The Penitent Magdalen. They measure 54 x 42½ in., and The Penitent Magdalen measures 64¼ x 55⅝ in. after its extension by 8¼ in. on the left side. This alteration had already been carried out when the hand-screen diagram was made, so the presumption must be that the present frame was already around the painting.\n\nThe 18th century origins of the Auricular revival at Kingston Lacy\n\nFig. 24 George Dowdney (fl. 1730s), Henry I Bankes, dated 1734 on reverse, o/c, 29½ x 23¾ in (75 x 60 cm), Kingston Lacy, Dorset, NT 1257151\n\nHenry I Bankes (1698-1776) commissioned George Dowdney to clean and restore the Kingston Lacy pictures in 1731. Dowdney’s list is the first record of the pictures in the house and he painted Bankes’s portrait in 1734 (NT 1257151; fig. 24) [30]. Henry I himself listed the pictures at Kingston Lacy in 1762 (revised 1775) and 1772, and to him has been ascribed the inauguration of the Auricular revival in picture frames there. In 1994, Alastair Laing stated that:\n\n‘It was probably also Henry [I] who had so many of the pictures framed or reframed, probably by local craftsmen, and often with imitations of the superb 17th century ‘Sunderland’ frames on Sir Ralph’s Peter Lelys. These are the first such historicizing frames dating from the 18th century to have been identified anywhere.’ [31]\n\nThe Auricular revival frames at Kingston Lacy may indeed derive from the 18th century [32]. In 1986, John Cornforth also noted that ‘a number of the frames in the Auricular style incorporate mid-18th– century ornamental motifs, as if they were 18th-century essays in the 17th-century style’ [33].\n\nFig. 25 After Sir Anthony van Dyck (1599-1641), The Princes of the Palatinate, o/c, 54 x 58 in (137.2 x 147.3 cm), in a carved & gilded Auricular revival frame, c.1760?, Kingston Lacy, Dorset, NT 1257115\n\nFig. 26 After Sir Anthony van Dyck (1599-1641), The three eldest children of Charles I, o/c, 48 x 54 in (121.9 x 137.2 cm), in a carved & gilded Auricular revival frame, c.1760?, Kingston Lacy, Dorset, NT 1257117\n\nThe frames of two portraits after Van Dyck, The Princes of the Palatinate (NT 1257115; fig. 25) and The three eldest children of Charles I (NT 1257117; fig. 26) have crestings which are markedly rocaille. If these two frames date from around 1760, then the inserted cresting and the central section below, including the mask, of Lely’s extended The penitent Magdalen (figs 20 & 22), may be contemporaneous. Fragments of frames in store may also date from that period (figs 21-22).\n\nFig. 27 Massimo Stanzione (1585-1656), Jerome Bankes, Naples, c.1655, o/c, 50 x 40 in (127 x 101.6 cm), in a carved & gilded Auricular revival frame, partly c.1760?, Kingston Lacy, Dorset, NT 1257045\n\nThe inserted top central section of the frame of Massimo Stanzione’s portrait of Jerome Bankes (fig. 27) seems also to be be an 18th century survival, and the inspiration for the crestings of the Auricular revival frames which were presumably made for the Library before 1814-15.\n\nFig. 28 Studio of Sir Anthony van Dyck (1599-1641), Richard Weston, 1st Earl of Portland K.G., o/c, 84 x 48 in (213.4 x 121.9 cm), in a carved & gilded Auricular revival frame, before 1814-15, Kingston Lacy, Dorset, NT 1257109\n\nFig. 29 Edward Altham (1622-94), Self-portrait as a hermit, Rome, c.1680-90, o/c, 93 x 65 in (236.2 x 165.1 cm), in a carved & gilded Auricular revival frame, before 1814-15, Kingston Lacy, Dorset, NT 1257111\n\nCornforth illustrated two examples of what he felt might be 18th century revivalist frames: around the portrait after Van Dyck of Richard Weston, 1st Earl of Portland, KG (NT 1257109; fig. 28) and the self-portrait of Edward Altham as a hermit (NT 1257111; fig. 29) [34]. However, Henry I Bankes’s grandson, William Bankes (1786-1855), declared that he intended ‘to alter all the library frames and Lord Portland and Mr Altham to correspond with Charles and his Queen [Van Dyck Studio; figs 16-17] and Sir J. and Lady Borlase [by Van Dyck; figs 14-15]’, all four of which retain their original 17th century Auricular frames [35]. This would suggest that the two matching frames around the portraits of ‘Lord Portland and Mr Altham’, which have hung together in the Saloon since 1762, were probably made for the pictures when the Library was also rehung before 1814-15.\n\nFig. 30 After Guido Reni (1575-1642), The Adoration of the Shepherds, o/c, 48 x 36 in (121.9 x 91.4 cm), in a carved & gilded Auricular revival frame, c.1760?, Kingston Lacy, Dorset, NT 1257096\n\nFig. 31 Jacob Huysmans (c.1630-96) after Sir Anthony van Dyck (1599-1641), Cupid preparing his bow, before 1659, o/c, 52 x 40 in (132.1 x 101.6 cm), in a carved & gilded Auricular revival frame, c.1760?, Kingston Lacy, Dorset, NT 1257118\n\nTwo other paintings – The adoration of the shepherds and Cupid preparing his bow – are in matching Auricular revival frames (figs 30-31), with rocaille crestings and a prominent shell below. Apart from the additions to the sides, these two frames probably date from the 18th century, like the other similar frames and parts of frames that have already been noted, particularly the frames of the two group portraits after Van Dyck (figs 25-26). Their crestings are also similar to that of Lely’s The penitent Magdalen (fig. 20). The first is a copy (NT 1257096), adapted to a rectangular format, after Guido Reni’s octagonal The adoration of the shepherds, once in the Walpole Collection at Houghton, Norfolk, and now in the Pushkin State Museum of Fine Arts, Moscow (inv.1608) [36]. The Reni copy (fig. 30) made its first appearance at Kingston Lacy in the Saloon picture-hanging diagram, drawn up before 1814 to 1815 (fig. 23).\n\nFig. 32 Nicolaes Berchem the elder (1620-83), Landscape with herdsmen, s & d 1655, o/c, 86 x 72 in (218.4 x 182.9 cm), in a carved & gilded early 19th century frame, Kingston Lacy, Dorset, NT 1257110\n\nIt was then hanging to the right of Berchem’s large Landscape with herdsmen (fig. 32), which Sir Ralph Bankes acquired through Sir Peter Lely and which was re-framed in the early 19th century (not in Auricular style), as part of a group that included Lely’s The penitent Magdalen (above the Berchem), flanked by the Van Dyck portraits of Sir John Borlase and Lady Borlase. The adoration of the Magi may then already have been in its present frame in view of the adjacent 17th century and later Auricular style frames. Huysmans’s Cupid preparing his bow (NT 1257118; fig. 31), has been in the Bankes collection since the 17th century [37]. It was also listed in the Saloon in the 1814-15 picture-hanging diagram. By 1856, both pictures were in the North Parlour, when the Huysmans Cupid was clearly in the same frame (‘in gilt frame with large carved ornament over’) [38], and by 1905, both pictures were back in the Saloon [39].\n\n19th century Auricular revival frames\n\nFig. 33 Pompeo Batoni (1708-87), Henry II Bankes, Rome, s & d 1779, o/c, 39 x 28½ in (99.1 x 72.4 cm), Kingston Lacy, Dorset, NT 1257055\n\nThe squire of Kingston Lacy from 1776 to 1834 was Henry II Bankes (1757-1834), politician and historian, who was painted by Batoni in Rome in 1779 (NT 1257055; fig. 33), and who was interested in pictures and Old Master drawings.\n\nFig. 34 The Saloon, Kingston Lacy, Dorset (NT)\n\nHe altered and redecorated the Saloon (the Great Hall of the 17th century house) in the 1780s, when it was already the main room for hanging pictures (fig. 34). The pre-1814-15 picture-hanging diagrams revealing the changes to the display of the Saloon, Library and Billiard Room, including the extension of Lely’s The Penitent Magdalen, are possibly in the handwriting of Henry II Bankes, but the picture hangs were presumably devised in consultation with his son, William Bankes (1786-1855), who was vigorously collecting paintings for the house in the early 19th century and who – after his father’s death in 1834 – transformed Kingston Hall, which he renamed Kingston Lacy, in honour of a prominent medieval owner of the estate [40].\n\nThe Library\n\nFig. 35 The Library, Kingston Lacy, Dorset (NT)\n\nFig. 36 Picture-hanging plan of the Library at Kingston Lacy, before 1814-15, ink & watercolour on paper, mounted on card, Kingston Lacy, Dorset, NT 1253624\n\nIn the Library, we have proof that alterations were made to the Auricular frames of the paintings hung above the bookcases (fig. 35) and that the hang was enriched before 1814-15, the date of one of the three picture-hanging diagrams (fig. 36).\n\nFig. 37 Attributed to Gerard Seghers (1591-1651), St. Ambrose, o/c, 45 x 56 in (114.3 x 142.2 cm), in a carved & gilded Auricular revival frame, before 1814-15, Kingston Lacy, Dorset, NT 1257057\n\nFig. 38 Attributed to Gerard Seghers (1591-1651), St. Jerome, o/c, 45 x 56 in (114.3 x 142.2 cm), in a carved & gilded Auricular revival frame, before 1814-15, Kingston Lacy, Dorset, NT 1257048\n\nFig. 39 Attributed to Gerard Seghers (1591-1651), St. Augustine of Hippo, o/c, 45 x 56 in (114.3 x 142.2 cm), in a carved & gilded Auricular revival frame, before 1814-15, Kingston Lacy, Dorset, NT 1257059\n\nFig. 40 Attributed to Gerard Seghers (1591-1651), St. Gregory the Great, o/c, 45 x 61 in (114.3 x 154.9 cm), in a carved & gilded Auricular revival frame, before 1814-15, Kingston Lacy, Dorset, NT 1257050\n\nThe room was then hung, much as it is now, with six Lely portraits and four larger paintings of Doctors of the Western Church, attributed to Gerard Seghers, also in Auricular style frames (NT 1257057; 1257048; 1257059 and 1257050; figs. 37-40) [41].\n\nWilliam Bankes commended his father’s taste in moving the Lelys to the Library above the bookcases: ‘the fine family portraits are admirably placed in it [the Library], and I should be at a loss how to dispose them elsewhere’ [42]. However, he proposed ‘to alter all the library frames…to correspond with Charles and his Queen (figs 16-17) and Sir J. and Lady Borlase (figs 14-15)’ [43]. Although the four Lely portraits flanking the Library chimneypiece are in almost matching 17th century ‘Sunderland’ Auricular frames, the two Lely portraits on the end walls, each hung between two Doctors of the Western Church by Seghers, have frames with distinctive pierced crestings and with shells in the centre beneath. These two Auricular revival frames around portraits of Sir Ralph Bankes and his wife’s uncle, Charles Brune [44], correspond in style to the frames around the four Doctors of the Western Church. These changes were presumably made before the 1814-15 picture-hanging plan of the Library (fig. 36) [45].\n\nNow hanging over the Library chimneypiece is Stanzione’s brooding portrait, painted at Naples c.1655, of Jerome Bankes (NT 1257045; fig. 27), Sir Ralph’s younger brother. This has the same type of pierced cresting that has already been doubted as 17th century, and the frame has been cut in several places [46].\n\nFig. 41 George Sandars (1774-1846), William John Bankes, 1812, watercolour on ivory, 11½ x 9½ in (29 x 23.6 cm), Kingston Lacy, Dorset, NT 1251251\n\nFig. 42 Sir John Hayter, R.A., (1792-1871), William John Bankes, 1833, oval, o/board, 11½ x 9¼ in (28.5 x 23.5 cm), Kingston Lacy, Dorset, NT 1257128\n\nHenry II Bankes continued his father’s revivalist taste for the Auricular during his rearrangement of the collection under the influence of his son, William Bankes (figs 41-42). The arrangements of father and son are recorded in the 1835 inventory, whereas the 1856 inventory [47], drawn up after the death of William’s brother, George, who only outlived him by a year, is the document which charts William’s further embellishments. These were on a grand scale. From 1835-41, William Bankes employed Charles Barry to transform the interior, which was further elaborated by refined Italian carvers and by Baron Marochetti’s bronzes celebrating the Bankes’s loyalty to the crown during the Civil War. The Emperor Augustus’s supposed boast about Rome is inscribed above one of the Staircase landing doorcases, beneath his Antique portrait bust: ‘I found it brick and left it marble’, which is very much what Bankes achieved in his transformation of Pratt’s 17th century house.\n\nWilliam Bankes, the contemporary of Byron at Trinity College, Cambridge, traveller in Egypt and the Levant, and – thanks to his friendship with the Duke of Wellington – a precocious collector of Spanish paintings during the Peninsular War, was almost entirely responsible for the acquisition of the Old Masters at Kingston Lacy, which include paintings by Sebastiano del Piombo Titian, Tintoretto, Rubens and Velázquez [48]. Like his father, he concentrated his best pictures in the Saloon, where his Spanish pictures were hanging in 1835 (fig. 35). He also took a close interest in picture frames.\n\nFig. 43 Circle of Raphael, The Holy Family with the infant St. John in a landscape, ‘The Kingston Lacy Raphael’, c.1516-17, o/panel, 30 x 21 in (76 x 53.3 cm), carved walnut frame by Pietro Giusti of Siena, 1853-6, Kingston Lacy, Dorset, NT 1257083\n\nHis premier commission was the almost surreally precise carved walnut frame for the so-called ‘Kingston Lacy Raphael’, The Holy Family with the infant St. John in a landscape, now demoted to Circle of Raphael, which he commissioned from Pietro Giusti of Siena in 1853 (NT 1257083; fig. 43) [49]. Might Bankes have known Chambers Hall, whose Auricular revival frames survive in the Ashmolean (figs 4-5) and who published a book about the peregrinations of a Raphael Holy Family, perhaps inspired by the ‘Kingston Lacy Raphael’[50]?\n\nIn 1841, following his second arrest for a homosexual act in a public place, Bankes fled to France and then to Italy, basing himself in Venice. He was outlawed, but the family tradition is correct that in 1854, when he may have had a terminal illness, he came surreptitiously to Kingston Lacy to inspect his continuing works there [51].\n\nFig. 44 The ‘Spanish Picture’, ‘Golden’ or Spanish Room, 1838-55, Kingston Lacy, Dorset (NT)\n\nFor the framing of three of his Spanish pictures in what he called the ‘Spanish Picture’ or ‘Golden’ Room (fig. 44), Bankes employed the Venetian carver, Giuseppe Foradori, who made – in Bankes’s own words – the ‘gloriously carved frames for the three central pictures’, then above and flanking the chimneypiece, which were made in Venice and were being gilded in London in November 1850 [52].\n\nFig. 45 Diego Velázquez (1599-1660) & studio, Philip IV of Spain, c.1626-8, o/c, 78½ x 42½ in (199 x 108 cm), sold 1896 from Kingston Lacy, still in the giltwood frame made by Giuseppe Foradori in Venice & gilded in London (November 1850), Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum, Boston, Massachusetts; P26e18\n\nAmong them and still in Bankes’s frame was the lost jewel of the collection, sold in 1896 to Isabella Stewart Gardner and now in her Museum in Boston (P26e18): Velázquez’s full-length portrait of Philip IV of Spain (fig. 45). Bankes described these frames as being ‘in the Venetian manner’ [53]. The decoration of the room is indeed more Venetian than Spanish, incorporating a ceiling and gilded leather hangings from the palazzo Contarini degli Scrini, Venice.\n\nFig. 46 Juan Bautista Martínez del Mazo (c.1612 – 67), o/canvas, reduced sketch after Velázquez’s Las Meninas (Prado, Madrid), 56 x 48 in (142.2 x 121.9 cm), in giltwood frame made by Giuseppe Foradori in Venice & gilded in London (November 1850), Kingston Lacy, Dorset, NT 1257140\n\nFig. 47 Attributed to Francisco de Zurbarán (1598 -1664) Saint Augustine, Bishop of Hippo (354-430) in meditation, c.1620-24, o/c, 90 x 51 in (228.6 x 129.5 cm), in giltwood frame made by Giuseppe Foradori in Venice & gilded in London (November, 1850), Kingston Lacy, Dorset, NT 1257131\n\nForadori’s remaining two picture frames are of a similar ‘Sansovino’ character. They were designed for Juan Bautista Martínez del Mazo’s reduced oil sketch after Velázquez’s Las meninas (NT 1257140; fig. 46) and Saint Augustine, Bishop of Hippo (354-430) in Meditation (NT 1257131; fig. 47) attributed to Francisco de Zurbarán.\n\nFig. 48 Carved, painted & gilded cartouche in the Auricular style in the Spanish Room at Kingston Lacy, 1838-55, 23¾ x 55½ in (60 x 140.7 cm), carved, painted & gilded wood, NT 1254746.4, which is fixed above Pedro Orrente (1588-1645), ‘Moses at the burning bush’, o/c, 10½ x 42½in (26.7 x 107.9 cm), Kingston Lacy, Dorset, NT 1257137\n\nFig. 49 Carved, painted & gilded cartouche in the Auricular style in the Spanish Room at Kingston Lacy, 1838-55, 23¾ x 55¼ in (60 x 140.5 cm), carved, painted & gilded wood, NT 1254746.5, which is fixed above Pedro Orrente, ‘Samson with the lion’, o/c, 10½ x 42½ in (26.7 x 107.9 cm), Kingston Lacy, Dorset, NT 1257138\n\nThe Auricular style makes an unexpected entry into the Spanish Room’s eclectic décor in the form of two complementary but not identical cartouches, fixed above a pair of oblong pictures by Pedro Orrente (figs 48-49). With their even grander companions in a more marked ‘Sansovino’ style, they are among the most elaborate picture labels ever made.\n\nThere is therefore at Kingston Lacy compelling evidence of Auricular revivals. It is to be hoped that these initial investigations will be borne out by physical evidence during examination of the frames and by documentary proof when the Kingston Lacy archive is more thoroughly investigated.\n\n***********************************************\n\nChristopher Rowell is the National Trust’s Curator of Furniture (2002-); Chairman of the Furniture History Society (2013-); and a member of the UK Reviewing Committee on the Export of Works of Art and Objects of Cultural Interest (2015-).
