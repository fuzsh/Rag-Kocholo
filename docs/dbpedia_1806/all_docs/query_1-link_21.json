He drove for Spirit, Osella and Zakspeed, and his drives all either started or became available midseason. He tried to get Dutch sponsors in various ways, such as by putting a one-page advertisement in De Telegraaf newspaper. Reputedly, when Niki Lauda was asked about him, he referred to him as \"rattengott\" – literally \"God of the rats\". Rothengatter, unlike many fringe drivers who waited for phone calls from F1 teams that never came, attracted personal sponsorship which allowed him to 'buy' his place in the low-budget teams, bringing in much needed money to them and allowing him to drive F1 when he otherwise would most likely have missed out. Rothengatter later entered into sports management, as a manager for Dutch F1 driver Jos Verstappen. He is co-founder of EVBox.\n\n7 .

Nevertheless, he returned the following year with ATS for four races, but qualified only once, at Watkins Glen. After Formula One, he returned to Formula 3 for another three years, winning two rounds of the European Championship and finishing second in the series to Alain Prost. From there he moved to one-make Renault racing, where he remains to this day. His sons Jeroen and Sebastiaan are also racers.\n\n8 . Jan Flinterman ( 1919 - 1992 )\n\nWith an HPI of 46.80 , Jan Flinterman is the 8th most famous Dutch Racing Driver .
