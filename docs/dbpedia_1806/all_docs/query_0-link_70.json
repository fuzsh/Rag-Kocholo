        "text": "Holiday homes Netherlands\n\nGo on a holiday and enjoy some freedom: rent a holiday home in the Netherlands.\n\nDiscover all the special places, go to Limburg, known for its hilly landscape and Burgundian cuisine. In the southern part of the country there is plenty to do, from amusement parks to a visit to the caves in Valkenburg.\n\nOr rent a holiday home in Zeeland, the province by the sea with wide and clean sandy beaches and nice cosy cities such as Middelburg or Breskens.\n\nGelderland is also a great choice for a holiday home in the Netherlands. Enjoy the peace and quiet in Lochem or stay in a holiday home in the Hoge Veluwe. Where you can enjoy the vast heathland, dense forests and many wetlands.\n\nHoliday home for rent in the Netherlands\n\nThe Netherlands is a fantastic versatile holiday destination. Visitors to the country are impressed by the Dutch cities, the nature reserves, the abundance of water of course and the rich culture and history it offers. A cottage in the Netherlands can be a great choice for your upcoming holiday.\n\nAnd the nice thing is, there are plenty of lovely last minute holiday homes in the Netherlands.\n\nWater sports holiday in the Netherlands\n\nThe Netherlands is a water sports country par excellence. If you look at the map you will see that Holland is completely intersected with water. Many people like to travel around the country by boat.\n\nBut also good are the holiday homes in Holland near one of the major water sports areas. So that you, as water sports enthusiasts, can enjoy the water from your own comfortable holiday spot every day.\n\nAnd if you want something different for a day, there is plenty to do in the area. Go for example to the Frisian lakes. Or the Loosdrechtse Plassen on the border of Utrecht and North Holland.\n\nAnd for many people, the water in Zeeland will be an enormous attraction. For example, the Grevelingenmeer with all its extensive water sports facilities. A unique area for surfers.\n\nEnjoying the Dutch coast\n\nAnd we haven't even mentioned the largest water sports area. Because wherever your cottage in the Netherlands is, the beautiful North Sea coast is often nearby. It is true that the magnificent sandy beaches are popular with tourists.\n\nFrom Zeeland to Den Helder, Holland has beautiful sandy beaches. It is great to enjoy on warm and sunny days. But it is just as nice to take a lovely walk when the wind or even storms and the sea goes wild.\n\nFor surfers, the beach is the walhalla when the wind is strong. And then we haven't mentioned the wadden coast of Groningen and Friesland at all. It is also impressive and worth a visit.\n\nVisiting our dikes, dams and bridges\n\nThe Netherlands is low-lying. Wherever your holiday home is in the Netherlands, chances are that the area is just above or below sea level.\n\nThe land is largely conquered from the water by land reclamation and by placing large sea walls, dikes and dams. All good to visit during your holiday. Large waterworks such as the Afsluitdijk or the Oosterscheldedam are definitely worth a visit.\n\nBut also the 19 windmills at Kinderdijk which keep the polders of the Alblasserwaard dry. Or the Wouda pumping station near Lemmer, the largest still functioning steam pumping station in the world. Each and every one of them are impressive buildings.\n\nOften you will find a good exhibition about how the country is protected from the water. An excellent day trip from your holiday home. Especially if the weather is not so good and you cannot enjoy the water yourself.\n\nThe Dutch wetlands and marshes\n\nWith the location below sea level, much of the Dutch country is naturally marshy peat or marshland. Or in another way, it has become a beautiful symbiosis of land and water. You will find many beautiful nature reserves in Holland to enjoy.\n\nOf course the Oostvaardersplassen, which gained international fame thanks to the documentary the New Wilderness. But also the wonderful surroundings of the Biesbosch or the Green Heart. And less known, but at least as beautiful: The Weerribben in Overijssel.\n\nFrom one of the holiday cottages in Holland you always have a number of beautiful nature reserves and 'wetlands' in your area. Make use of it and enjoy this beautiful country.\n\nForest walks in the Netherlands\n\nVisitors can enjoy the dense forests in the Netherlands. For example, go to the Utrechtse Heuvelrug with the dog. In this area you will find dense deciduous and coniferous forests and during a walk you will come across a range of wildlife.\n\nAnd that goes all the way to the Veluwe, the largest lowland nature reserve in northwest Europe. This large, green area on the map is an enormous forest, interspersed by beautiful open fields and heathland.\n\nThe Hoge Veluwe national park is worth a visit, but other areas such as Veluwezoom national park are also highly recommended. Where else do you have the chance to see red deer or wild boar? And in the future perhaps again wolves? The first have already been spotted."
