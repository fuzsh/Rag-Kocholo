Andre "Dries" van der Lof (born 23 August 1919 and died 24 May 1990) was a Dutch businessman and racing driver who participated in the 1952 Dutch Grand Prix. Together with Jan Flinterman, he was the first Dutch driver to race in a Formula One championship race.

Prior to racing in Formula One, he raced in rallies and some other national events in the Netherlands. Van der Lof owned a factory that manufactured electrical cables.

The 1952 Dutch Grand Prix was the first Dutch event to be included as part of the Formula One championship. To drum up local excitement, the event organizers funded van der Lof's seat on HW Motors. He completed 70 of the 90 laps in the race, but was not classified in the race results because he failed to complete 90% of the race distance.

Later in his motor racing career, he purchased a Maserati 250F, which he used to compete in historic races until the 1980s.
