Despite never having seen it in any kind of real size or resolution!\n\nDoes anyone know anything about this one?\n\nThe link appears to be broken so I can't see the picture.\n\nThat is a pretty picture! Rare for royals to be pictured in such an intimate pose, or that may be just me. I find it a lovely one.\n\nIt's a first-timer for me also and when I past it in Google Images it only says honeymoon, that's it.\n\nIt's a combination of: this is a super \"off-duty\" picture; they are exceptionally lovely and happy and sweet together here... and Astrid, who seems about to laugh her head off.\n\n(Small side inquiry of 'Leo did you do that to her dress, or are you trying to make it better'? ...Or both. )\n\nI wouldn't be surprised if they were on honeymoon (they both look so young), but I wouldn't be surprised if it were some other time."
