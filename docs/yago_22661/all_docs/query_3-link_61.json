        "text": "The baby name Astrid combines Scandi cool with a long history of use and an offbeat, strong sound.\n\nThanks to Allison for suggesting our Baby Name of the Day.\n\nDIVINE BEAUTY\n\nAstrid evolved from the Old Norse Ástrídr. The first element means god; the second, beauty, so the meaning of Astrid is often given as “divine beauty.”\n\nVariant spellings over the years include Æstriðr, Ástríðr, Estrid, Estrith and Astrith.\n\nROYAL NAME\n\nThe name appears on royal family trees from the Middle Ages through the twentieth century.\n\nThe tenth century Astrid of the Obotrites, Queen consort of Olof Skötkonung, King of Sweden.\n\nAstrid Svendsdatter was a Danish princess from the same era. Her son went on to become King Sweyn II of Denmark. She later married Robert, Duke of Normandy – making her stepmom to William the Conqueror.\n\nAstrid of Sweden, born in 1905, became Queen of Belgium when she married monarch Leopold III. She was wildly popular, and her tragic death in a car accident at a young age added to her mystique.\n\nPrincess Astrid of Belgium was Queen Astrid’s granddaughter. Born in 1962, she’s now the Archduchess of Austria-Este.\n\nPrincess Astrid of Norway, born in 1932, spent more than a decade serving as official hostess for her father, the King, after her mother’s passing. This royal married a commoner, and was better known as Mrs. Ferner.\n\nFAMOUS ASTRIDS\n\nThanks in part to the high-profile royals, the baby name Astrid has traveled the world.\n\nYou might have heard of:\n\nVenezuelan telenovela actress Astrid Carolina Herrera Irrazábal.\n\nBarcelona-born actress Àstrid Bergès-Frisbey played a mermaid in Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides, though she’s spent most of her career in Europe.\n\nBrazilian singer Astrud Gilberto. Even if you don’t recognize her name, chances are that you’ve heard her sing – she’s the haunting voice in “The Girl from Ipanema.”\n\nAstrid Kirchherr met Stuart Sutcliffe back when the Beatles were an undiscovered bar band playing Hamburg. Her photographs of them remain favorites.\n\nSwedish writer Astrid Lindgren penned the Pippi Longstocking series. Pippi is the fiercely independent, improbably strong and surprisingly sensible daughter of a sea captain, best known for her red braids. (She claims that Pippi is a nickname for Pippilotta.)\n\nBY the NUMBERS\n\nThe baby name Astrid remains a staple in Denmark, Norway, and Sweden – a classic heritage choice.\n\nBut it’s also been popular in France, sometimes spelled Astride. In recent years, Franco-Belgian detective television series Astrid et Raphaëlle might deserve credit for the name’s appeal.\n\nThe real story is the rise of Astrid in the US.\n\nIt’s long been used in small numbers, and Astrid first charts in the US Top 1000 in 1905.\n\nBut Astrid really started to trend in the 1990s, returning to the US Top 1000 in 1995 and 1996, before leaving again.\n\nThe name returned from 2004 to 2005.\n\nSince 2013, the baby name Astrid has marched up the popularity charts, reaching an all-time high of #399 in 2023.\n\nWhat explains the name’s discovery in the US?\n\nPopular culture, of course.\n\nASTRID in INDIE MOVIES\n\nOne possibility for the 1990s spike? The Beatles’ early history was in the spotlight.\n\n1994 indie film Backbeat included Astrid Kirchherr, played by Sheryl Lee. The actress had just dominated pop culture as Twin Peaks’ doomed Laura Palmer. So even if the movie wasn’t a box office smash, it might’ve gotten enough press to tip Astrid into the rankings – at least briefly.\n\nThe 2004-2005 bump in use might be down to an indie movie, too. Dark and distrubing coming-of-age film Thirteen included a character named Astrid. While it’s mostly forgotten now, it was a Sundance award winning and netted an Oscar nomination for Holly Hunter.\n\nVIKING PRINCESS\n\nFast forward to 2008.\n\nThe American adaptation of The Office was a smash hit for NBC. Bumbling manager Michael Scott welcomed a baby with another character, Jan Levinson. Sort of. Michael asks his team to throw Jan a baby shower and tells them that the baby would be named Astird. (Not a typo. That’s what Michael announces his future daughter will be named.)\n\nMichael also insists the name means “Viking princess.”\n\nNot surprisingly, this doesn’t help the name.\n\nBut a very different Viking is about to change everything.\n\nDRAGON RIDERS of BERK\n\nBritish author Cressida Cowell published How to Train Your Dragon in 2003. Sequels followed, with a dozen books released, the final in 2015.\n\nThe books follow Hiccup Horrendous Haddock the Third, an awkward boy growing up in the Viking village of Berk. He’s clever and capable, but not in the way Viking warriors are expected to be, and so he’s having a rough time when we first meet him.\n\nBut then he meets a dragon named Toothless and everything changes.\n\nIn the third book, Hiccup meets a ferocious swordfighter named Camicazi. She’s as brash and fearless as Hiccup is cautious and thoughtful, and the two become unlikely friends.\n\nThe book inspired a 2010 animated adaptation. Hiccup remains the main character, along with Toothless, the dragon he befriends. Camicazi is there, too. Only she’s been renamed Astrid.\n\nThere’s an immediate jump in the name’s use. And by 2013, the baby name Astrid returns to the US popularity charts at #981.\n\nHow to Train Your Dragon hasn’t slowed down since, and the name Astrid has soared, too.\n\nMovie sequels followed in 2014 and 2019. Animated series Dragon: Riders of Berk and Dragons: Defenders of Berk debuted on Cartoon Network in 2012. Other animated series have followed.\n\nNow a live action version of the original movie is in production, expected in 2025. Nico Parker, known for her role in The Last of Us, will co-star as Astrid.\n\nSCANDI COOL with PLENTY of STRENGTH\n\nStrong, brief, and nickname-proof, the baby name Astrid has become a mainstream favorite in the US.\n\nScandi parents choose nicknames like Asti and Sassa, but chances are an American Astrid won’t shorten her name.\n\nAstrid appeals to parentsseeking something distinctive and interesting, feminine but frills-free, changing from misunderstood import to mainstream favorite.\n\nRight now it remains an intriguing option for a daughter. Familiar, powerful, and yet fresh and different, too.\n\nWhat do you think of the baby name Astrid?\n\nFirst published on April 16, 2009, this post was updated on June 27, 2024."
