        "text": "Queen Astrid of Belgium lived a short but happy life before her shock death during a holiday in Switzerland.\n\nBorn to the Swedish Royal Family in Stockholm where she spent her childhood, Astrid was the third child and youngest daughter of Prince Carl and Princess Ingeborg (of Denmark).\n\nShe and her siblings received a strict education and were raised without much luxury, attending a boarding school where lessons were taught in French.\n\nFollowing school, Astrid attended a finish school before beginning work for charitable causes as was expected of Swedish royals.\n\nThe Courier-Mail reported on the details of Queen Astrids upbringing, saying she and her sisters had been raised to be independent and care for themselves.\n\nAfter finishing school Princess Astrid chose to work at an orphanage in Stockholm, helping to care for the children.\n\nAstrid was considered an eligible bride for a number of European princess, with the successful suitor Prince Leopold of Belgium, the Duke of Brabant.\n\nAt the time of their meeting, Prince Leopold had been introduced to a Swedish princess thought to be a suitable match, however in March 1926 he met and fell in love with Princess Astrid.\n\nREAD MORE: Belgian royal family comes out of lockdown for special outdoor activity\n\nThe announcement of their pending nuptials was released by the Belgian royal palace on behalf of King Albert I and Queen Elisabeth of Belgium.\n\nIt read: \"The Queen and I,\" declared Albert, \"would like to announce to you the impending marriage between Prince Leopold, Duke of Brabant and the Princess Astrid of Sweden. We are convinced that the princess will bring joy and happiness to our son. Leopold and Astrid have decided to join their lives without any pressures or reasons of state.\n\n\"Theirs is a true union among people with the same inclinations.\"\n\nQueen Elisabeth said: \"It is a marriage of love... tell it to our people. Nothing was arranged. Not a single political consideration prevailed in our son's decision.\"\n\nPrincess Astrid and Prince Leopold did indeed live a happy life together, marrying in 1924.\n\nThey were married twice - once in a civil ceremony in Stockholm and again in Belgium for a religious service.\n\nPrincess Astrid was quickly adopted by Belgium, even more so because she was adored by her husband.\n\nThe couple had three children - Princess Josephine-Charlotte in 1927 and Prince Baudouin in 1930 and Prince Albert in 1934.\n\nKing Albert I died in a climbing accident the same year as the birth of their third child whom was named after his grandfather.\n\nPrince Leopold ascended the throne as King and Astrid became Queen.\n\nQueen Astrid was a hands-on royal, working closely with Belgians with a focus on disadvantaged women and children.\n\nIt was August 1935 when Queen Astrid died in a tragic accident, leaving her husband to spend the rest of his life mourning her.\n\nThe couple left Albert who was only one in Belgium and took a private holiday to Switzerland with their eldest children Josephine-Charlotte and Baudouin.\n\nThe family spent the time enjoying the outdoors including hiking.\n\nThe King and Queen sent their children back to Belgium on August 28 and stayed to enjoy some time alone together.\n\nIt was on August 29 that the couple decided to go for one last hike in the mountains before returning home.\n\nThere are two versions of what happened next. The first reports King Leopold driving the car with Queen Astrid seated next to her husband holding a map with the chauffeur sitting in the back.\n\nIt was reported that the Queen had pointed something out to Leopold and he took his eyes off the road for just a second causing the car to veer off the road and down a steep slope, slamming into a pear tree.\n\nQueen Astrid, who had opened her door to try and get out of the vehicle, was thrown from it on impact, dying instantly. She was only 29.\n\nKing Leopold was also thrown from the vehicle and according to a police report suffered only minor injuries including cuts to the head. The chauffeur was not injured.\n\nA second version of the story has the Queen sitting alone in the backseat of the car at the time of impact and her part of the vehicle feeling the full force of the tree upon impact, causing her death.\n\nWitnesses reported hearing Leopold screaming Astrid's name following the crash. Some reports describe a devastated Leopold holding his wife's body next to his chest when help arrived.\n\nThe King was so distraught he is said to have had the vehicle from which the Queen was thrown sunk into a deep part of the Lake Lucerne (Vierwaldst√§ttersee) in Switzerland.\n\nQueen Astrid 'lay in state' on August 31 with mourners allowed to view the body. Her funeral was held on 3 September, 1935.\n\nThe Queen's head was partially bandaged to conceal part of her face, a rosary laced in her hands and was surrounded by purple violets.\n\nIt is said that tens of thousands of people attended the viewing of her body resulting in long lines, with a similar number attending the funeral.\n\nNews reports at the time state that it had been raining from midnight the night before, suiting the sombre mood of the occasion.\n\nThe funeral car was draped in \"a canopy of gold and black\" and the Queen's crown was placed on top of the coffin.\n\nKing Leopold walked behind his wife's coffin and was described as looking \"drawn\". Queen Astrid was laid to rest in the royal vault.\n\nBoth Belgium and Sweden were in mourning following Astrid's death, with the countries collaborating to design a stamp dedicated to her late-Queen.\n\nA commemorative chapel was built in Switzerland at the site of the crash and it is still a popular destination for tourists.\n\nA nearby museum displays memorabilia of the tragic royal, including some macabre inclusions such as part of the pear tree the vehicle struck and a shard of glass from the windscreen.\n\nSources for this article include Wikipedia and The Courier-Mail Trove archives 1933-1954."
