        "text": "She was young, beautiful, adored by her people and mother of the future king. Then one August day, a car crash cut her life short and plunged the nation into an unprecedented wave of grief.\n\nFor Belgians, the death of 36-year-old Princess Diana evokes poignant memories of their own princess -- Astrid, who came from Sweden to marry the heir to the Belgian throne in 1926.\n\nLike Diana, Astrid acquired a fairy-tale aura. She was Belgium's \"Queen of smiles.\" Like Diana, she was loved for her beauty, her charitable works and the casual, relaxed style she brought to a stuffy court.\n\nAnd like Diana, she died in a car crash before reaching the prime of life, leaving young children behind.\n\nDiana's death Sunday came 62 years almost to the day when King Leopold III lost control of his Packard 120 on a lakeside road in Switzerland. On Aug. 29, 1935, the car plunged off the road, killing his 29-year-old wife instantly.\n\nIn a curious coincidence, Diana's car crashed a few yards from the Place Reine Astrid, the Paris square named for the Belgian queen.\n\nUnlike Diana, Astrid became queen. Her two sons became kings of Belgium.\n\nThe current monarch, Albert, was only 13 months old when Astrid died. His elder brother Boudouin, who was 4 years old when their mother died, ruled from 1951 until his death in 1993. Their older sister Josephine-Charlotte is Grand-Duchess of Luxembourg.\n\nAstrid acquired near-mythical status in Belgium.\n\n\"She is still referred to with extraordinary nostalgia,\" historian Pierre Wyvekens wrote in 1992. \"Her life might have made a wonderful story if only it had not been tragically cut short in its first chapter.\"\n\nToday there are no fewer than 16 streets and squares in Brussels that bear her name.\n\nAstrid, nicknamed \"the swan of the north\" for her graceful beauty, outshone her husband in the public's affections almost from the moment she arrived from Sweden.\n\nAfter her death, many Belgians blamed Leopold for the crash. He was driving fast on the twisting road beside the Vierwaldstaeter Lake and escaped with minor injuries after the car spun off the road.\n\nHe remarried in 1941 when Belgium was under Nazi occupation. He had three children with his new wife Princess Lilian.\n\nIn 1944, accusations he collaborated with the Nazis forced Leopold into exile. He returned in 1950, but a storm of protests brought Belgium to the brink of civil war and forced him to abdicate the following year. Leopold died in 1983 at age 81.\n\nPhoto by The Associated Press\n\nBelgium's Queen Astrid died at the age of 29 in a 1935 car crash in Switzerland, leaving her young children motherless. Like Princess Diana, Belgium's \"Queen of smiles\" had acquired a fairy-tale aura."
