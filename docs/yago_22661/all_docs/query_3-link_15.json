Mother: Estrid OF THE OBOTRITES (979-1035)\n\nIndividual Events and Attributes\n\nOccupation frm 1019 to 1035 Queen Consort of Norway\n\nMarriage\n\nA medieval representation of Saint Olaf.\n\nSpouse Olaf II OF NORWAY (995?-1030) Children Ulfhilde (Wulfhilde) OF NORWAY (1023?-1070) Marriage Feb 1018\n\nIndividual Note\n\nAstrid Olofsdotter (Norwegian: Astrid Olavsdatter; English: Aestrith) (died 1035) was the Queen Consort of King Olav II of Norway.[1]\n\nAstrid was born to King Olof Skötkonung of Sweden and his Obotritian mistress Edla. She was the half sister of King Anund Jacob of Sweden and sister of King Emund the Old of Sweden. It is said, that she and her brother Emund was not treated well by their stepmother, Queen Estrid of the Obotrites, and that they were sent away to foster parents. Astrid were sent to a man named Egil in Västergötland.[2]\n\nAstrid was married to King Olav in Sarpsborg during 1019. In 1016, it had been decided that Norway and Sweden should come to more peaceful relations by a royal marriage alliance. Noblemen of both countries tried to arrange a marriage between King Olav of Norway and the half sister of Astrid, Princess Ingegerd Olofsdotter of Sweden. King Olof of Sweden agreed at first but broke his promise. King Olav was supposed to have married Astrid's half sister, Olof Skötkonung's legitimate daughter Ingegerd Olofsdotter of Sweden. Ingegerd was, however, after his father's wishes instead married to Yaroslav I the Wise, Grand Prince of Novgorod and Kiev.[3] Some sources claim that Astrid replaced Ingegerd by the wish of her father. Other sources claim that the marriage took place against the will of her father, by the cooperation of King Olav of Norway and the Swedish jarl Ragnvald Ulfsson.[4]\n\nAstrid was described as beautiful, articulate and generous, and well liked by others. She was probably the mother of Wulfhild of Norway (10201070), wife of Ordulf, Duke of Saxony. She was the stepmother of King Magnus the Good, with whom she had a good relationship. In 1030, she was widowed when her husband was killed. She left Norway and settled in the Swedish court, where she had a high position. When her stepson Magnus visited Sigtuna on his way to claim the Norwegian throne, she gave him her official support and encouraged Sweden to do so as well.\n\nNOTES:\n\n1 Astrid norsk drottning (Historiska världar)\n\n2 Astrid Olavsdatter  utdypning (Store norske leksikon)\n\n3 Yaroslav the Wise (Encyclopedia of Ukraine, vol. 5. 1993)\n\n4 Olav 2 Haraldsson Den Hellige  utdypning (Store norske leksikon)\n\nSOURCES:\n\nAdam of Bremen\n\nHistoria Norwegie\n\nSnorre Sturlason\n\nLagerqvist, Lars O.
