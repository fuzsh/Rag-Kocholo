The main primary sources which have been used in the preparation of the present document are English translations of Snorre´s Heimkringsla series of Sagas which is generally dated to [1230], Morkinskinna dated to ten years or so earlier , to a lesser extent Orkneyinga Saga which was probably written not long after 1200, and the Historia Norwegie, of uncertain date in the late 12th century, which was written in Latin in Norway . Little help is available from surviving charters. The printed edition of the 22 volumes of the Diplomatarium Norvegicum is available on-line . However, only sparse relevant genealogical information relating to the families of the Norwegian kings and nobles is available in these charters. Nine diplomas have survived for the 11th century, and 91 for the 12th century, but the majority consist of Papal documents addressed to Norwegian kings or bishops, or otherwise indirectly relate to Norwegian matters, and contain little information which is relevant for present purposes beyond the names of specific kings.\n\nExactly how the early sources written in Norway, such as the Historia Norwegiæ, fit with the Icelandic Sagas is obscure. Andersson and Gade, in the introduction to their translation of Morkinskinna, suggest that they derive from the works of early 12th century Icelandic historians Ari þorgilsson and Sæmundr Sigfússon . Whatever the truth of their origin, the Icelandic Sagas and the Norwegian histories are mutually compatible and few factual discrepancies can be observed between them. On paper at least, lengthy genealogies can be compiled from these sources which link all the main protagonists within complex family groups, related through the male and female lines. However, it is evident that the Sagas especially use lineage as a means of emphasising social continuity. In addition, they were written up to three centuries after the events which they purport to recount. The difficulty is therefore to decide how far they are merely works of historical semi-fiction and the extent to which the information which they contain is historically accurate.\n\nAn analysis of the factual accuracy of the documentation is best approached by dividing the overall period into three chronological sub-periods: 9th century and before, 10th and 11th centuries, and 12th century and after. As far as the earliest sub-period is concerned, the early ancestry of the Norwegian kings is shrouded in mystery and confused by legendary descents. The Historia Norwegie narrates a descent of Harald I \"Hårfagre\" King of Norway (whose death is reported in [830]) from \"rex Ingui\", whom it says was reputedly the first king of the Swedish realm, from where settlers came to \"Trondemia\" [Trøndelag] . Snorre´s Ynglinga Saga records a chief named Odin in the city of Asgaard, in Asaland in \"Asia\", who, it says, led his people westward first to \"Gardarike\" and then south to \"Saxland\", before heading north where he died in \"Swithiod\" . The exploits of Odin´s descendants in Sweden are described in succeeding chapters of the Saga, culminating in the accession of the brothers Yngve and Alf . Ynglinga Saga links the Swedish line with the kings of Norway, recording a line of descent which is completely different from the one found in the Historia Norwegie, until the supposed great-grandfather of King Harald \"Hårfagre\" . There is no reason to suppose that either of these descents is anything other than legendary. However, the last three generations as recounted in the two sources coincide and are reproduced below in Chapter 1.A of this document, in square brackets and marked Improbable Lineage.\n\nThe second sub-period starts with the reign of King Harald I and the first three or four generations of his alleged descendants. The reign of King Harald is reported both in the Sagas and the Historia as improbably long and his descendants as improbably numerous. For example, according to the Historia Norwegie he reigned for 73 years and had sixteen sons . His seven successor kings of Norway, up to and including Harald III \"Hardråde\" King of Norway whose succession is dated to 1047, are recorded as sons of King Harald I or his second to fourth generation direct descendants in three different male lines. Little information is recorded in the sources about the ancestors of these successor kings other than their names. While the existence of the different kings can be corroborated, mainly from English primary sources, the suspicion persists that their actual family relationships to each other were much less certain than the Icelandic and Norwegian primary source documentation leads us to believe. The families of these kings who ruled before 1047 are set out in Chapter 1.B of this document, marked Doubtful Lineage. No attempt has been made to assign square brackets among this family group as there appears to be no factual basis on which to decide whether some lines are any more or less historically certain than others. From the reign of King Harald III, some hints can be found which suggest that we may be on somewhat firmer ground. These hints are found in the works of the early 12th century Icelandic historians Ari þorgilsson and Sæmundr Sigfússon, who were precursors to Snorre and possibly also to the Historia Norwegie as mentioned above. Firstly, Ari þorgilsson, in his extant Íslingabók, indicates tantalisingly that the book is a revision of an earlier version minus the genealogies and kings´ lives , without indicating the date of that early version or any more details. Secondly, a poem dated to [1190] reviews ten Norwegian kings from Harald I \"Hårfagre/Harfagri/Fairhair\" forwards as Sæmundr inn fródi [the Wise] told . These suggested earlier works no longer exist. However, if the hints are correct, it is possible that the precursors to the surviving primary sources dated from the mid- to late-11th century and were roughly contemporary with the reigns of Kings Harald III and Olav III (from 1047 to 1093), which may give some comfort about the factual accuracy of the Saga and Historia narratives relating to the families of these kings. In addition, few factual inconsistencies can be identified within either the Historia Norwegiæ or the Heimskringla series of Sagas with respect to this period: the genealogies of the Scandinavian rulers reconstructed from these sources fit neatly together and their chronology appears robust. This contrasts with the shaky chronology of the early rulers of Orkney described in Orkneyinga Saga , which provides genealogical details which purport to link the successive jarls of Orkney into a single family whose ancestry is traced back to Earl Rognwald the Powerful, a leading supporter of Harald I \"Hårfagre\" King of Norway . The precise chronological problems of the early chapters of Orkneyinga Saga are discussed further in the introduction to the chapter on the Jarls of Orkney in the document SCOTLAND, MORMAERS, EARLS, LORDS. The families of the Norwegian kings who ruled from 1047 to 1161 are set out in Chapter 1.D of this document.\n\nAs far as the last sub-period is concerned, we appear to be on solid ground, with the exception of the question of descent from imposters which is discussed further below. The last entry in the Heimskringla series of Sagas concerns King Magnus Erlingsson, and appears to be dated to 1177, presumably shortly before the last Saga in the series was written. If this is correct, its account of 12th century Scandinavian events is nearly contemporaneous and is therefore probably comparable in accuracy to primary sources produced in other parts of Europe. The families of the Norwegian kings who ruled from 1161 to 1319 are set out in Chapter 1.E and F of this document.\n\nWhatever the factual reliability of the Sagas, they represent our principle source of information concerning the medieval Norwegian kings. If they are dismissed as unreliable, there is little other basis from which the genealogies of Norwegian royal and noble families can be reconstructed.\n\nThe practice of accession to the throne by royal bastards survived in the Norwegian royal family well into the late 13th century, contrasting sharply with other European monarchies during the middle medieval period. For example, King William I \"the Conqueror\" (succeeded in 1066) was the last illegitimate king of England, King Arnulf (crowned emperor in 896) was the last illegitimate German king, and no French kings are recorded as having been of illegitimate birth. There are numerous examples of monarchs in other European countries who practised concubinage during the 11th to 13th centuries, and many cases where their illegitimate children enjoyed prominent careers. King Henry I of England is particularly noteworthy for having produced a large number of illegitimate offspring for whom their father arranged high-profile marriages to advance his political aims. The uniqueness of the Norwegian case centres on the equality of treatment between the legitimate and illegitimate candidates for the succession. Again, using the family of the English king Henry I as a contrasting example, the nomination of his powerful illegitimate son Robert Earl of Gloucester as his father's recognised heir never seems to have been considered as a serious possibility after the death of the king's only legitimate son in 1120. In the case of the Norwegian kings, the monarch's \"unofficial\" partners appear from the primary sources to have been generally accepted at court. Harald \"Gille\", king of Norway from 1130 until 1136, is the last king for whom a report has been found which records his maintaining relationships both with his official wife and one of his mistresses at the same time, although King Haakon IV, who succeeded in 1223, was the last Norwegian king who is recorded as being illegitimate. The case of King Harald includes the narration in Snorre's Saga of Magnus the Blind and of Harald Gille of the king's murder by his rival Sigurd \"Slembdjakn\", the success of the plot depending on the murderer's advance knowledge of the identity of the partner with whom the king was planning to spend the night . The case of King Sigurd Haraldsson (who died in 1155) is also significant. His six children are recorded as having been born to six different mothers (although their paternity is disputable in the case of two of them), while there is no record of the king having contracted any \"official\" marriage. Three of his supposed illegitimate children succeeded to the Norwegian throne.\n\nThe widespread acceptance of accession by royal bastards had another result in the Norwegian royal family, unique among all European ruling families at the time. This was the ease with which imposters were accepted at court, and eventually succeeded as kings, despite what now seem to be very dubious claims if the reports in the Sagas are to be believed. The likelihood that imposters would emerge appears to have increased because the Norwegian kings routinely sent away their infant sons, legitimate and illegitimate, to distant parts of the country soon after birth for fostering by trustworthy noblemen. This was presumably to reduce the risk of their being murdered by other family-members, which must have been a distinct possibility if they had remained at court. The acceptance of imposter claims appears, from primary sources such as the Heimskringla, to having depended solely on their successfully completing an ordeal by fire (walking over red-hot plough-shares), backed-up by personal testimony from the claimants' mothers. The cases of King Harald \"Gille\" and King Sigurd \"Slembidkjan\" provide an interesting contrast. Snorre records the arrival in Norway from Ireland of the future King Harald, who claimed to be the son of King Magnus III, some time in the early years of the 12th century during the reign of King Sigurd \"Jorsalafare\", who would have been his legitimate half-brother . The narration in the Saga inspires little confidence in the truth of Harald's story, but it portrays his arrival in a positive light, praises his easy personality and treats as inevitable his eventual acceptance as King Sigurd's successor. A few years into King Harald's reign, Sigurd \"Slembidkjan\" emerged with a similar story, also claiming to be King Magnus's son. In his case, the treatment of the story in the Saga is sceptical and his portrayal extremely negative, presumably influenced by the Danish backing which he received for his claim . The impression left on the reader is that good leadership qualities were considered more important by Norwegian king-makers than royal blood. King Sigurd \"Slembidkjan\" left no recorded descendants. However, all later Norwegian kings descend from King Harald \"Gille\". There is therefore a distinct possibility that all kings of Norway who succeeded to the throne after 1136, when King Harald was murdered, had no genetic link at all with their predecessors. This possibility seems to have been of little concern to contemporaries.\n\nAnother remarkable case is that of King Sverre who succeeded in 1184 and from whom all subsequent Norwegian kings were descended (see Chapter 1.F). According to the Saga of King Sverre, he came to Norway from the Faroe Islands in [1177], the year after being told by his mother that his real father was King Sigurd Haraldsson, after having spent the first twenty four years of his life as one of the sons of a Faroese nobleman . The Saga records no challenge to this claimed paternity, for which there appears to have been no proof apart from his mother's word, and which was (which seems very convenient) first raised more than twenty years after the death of his putative father. The source makes no reference to Sverre having to prove his paternity by ordeal which, as noted above, had been a common practice in the Norwegian royal family when similar situations had arisen previously. Ironically, King Sverre is recorded in the Saga as having been more careful when arranging the accession of his own son Haakon for, on his deathbed in 1202, he declared that Haakon was his only living son specifically to avoid any subsequent successful claims by imposters .\n\nIn 1319, the Norwegian throne passed to a member of the Swedish royal family who was the grandson of the last Norwegian king of Norway Haakon V. In common with the thrones of Sweden and Denmark, the Norwegian throne passed through the female line to the family of the dukes of Pomerania and the Wittelsbach dukes of Bavaria. The Norwegian kings between 1319 and 1448 are shown in outline form only in Chapter 2 of this document. From 1449, the Norwegian crown was united with the Danish crown when Christian Duke of Oldenburg was chosen as king of Denmark and Norway. The union with Denmark lasted until 1814, from which date the kings of Sweden also ruled as kings of Norway. Norway finally regained its independence in 1905.\n\nChapter 1.

The Historia Norwegie names \"Halfdanus Niger\" as son and successor of \"Guthrodum Regem Venatorem\", recording that he died after falling through the ice while travelling across a frozen lake \"Rond\" . Snorre recounts that, after his father's death, his mother took Halfdan to Agder where he became king when aged eighteen, at which time he went to Vestfold and divided that kingdom with his half-brother Olaf . He extended his domain to other parts of eastern Norway, probably also to the Sognefjord area on the west coast. He died, aged 40, after falling through the ice while riding over Rykinsvik bight. According to the Saga of Halfdan the Black, different districts claimed the honour of being Halfdan's burial place, and to satisfy all of them his body was divided into four parts and buried in Raumarik, Ringarik, Hedmark and Vestfold . m firstly RAGNHILD [Thora], daughter of HARALD \"Gullskiegg/Goldbeard\" King at Sogn & his wife Selware ---.

KINGS of NORWAY [872]-1028  DOUBTFUL LINEAGE\n\nHARALD, son of HALFDAN \"Swarti/the Black\" King of Vestfold & his second wife Ragnhild ([853/54] or 860-Hogaland 933, 934 or 940, bur Haugar in Karmtsund, near the church in Haugesund) . The Historia Norwegie names \"Haraldus Comatus\" as son and successor of \"Halfdanus Niger\", recording that he reigned for 73 years and had 16 sons . Snorre names Harald as the son of Halfdan \"the Black\" & his second wife . According to Snorre, Harald was ten years old when he succeeded his father as King at Vestfold . He conquered the area around Trondheim where Haakon Grjotgardson Jarl of Haalogaland accepted his overlordship. He was supported by the Jarl of Möre. The local rulers farther south joined forces against Harald, but were defeated in the naval battle at Hafrsfjord, after which Harald became ruler of all Norway as HARALD I \"Hårfagre/Harfagri/Fairhair\" King of Norway. He corresponded with Athelstan King of Wessex, and dispatched a mission to England led by Helgrim and Osfrid who presented Athelstan with an ornate warship at York . During his lifetime King Harald divided his kingdom between his sons and gave them all the title king. He decreed the title hereditary in the male line, and that his descendants in the female line should have the title Jarl. He granted:\n\nVingulmark, Raumarike, Vestfold and Thelamark to his sons Olav, Björn, Sigtryg, Frode and Thorgils;\n\nHedemark and Gudbrandsdal to his sons Dag, Hring and Ragnar;\n\nRingerike, Hadeland, Thoten and their dependencies to his sons by Snæfrid;\n\nHordaland and Sogn to his sons Hrorek and Gudrod;\n\nHalogaland, North More and Raumsdal to his son Eirik;\n\nhis son Guthrom retained the lands which he already controlled;\n\nthe land north of Trondheim to Halfdan \"the Black\", Halfdan \"the White\" and Sigrod.\n\nThe division resulted in major disputes between his sons about who would inherit the overall kingship . The dating of this division is difficult to assess, but from the chronology of events recorded by Snorre it appears to have occurred before the birth of King Harald's son Haakon, which is dated to [919]. King Harald abdicated in 930 \"when he was 80 years old\" in favour of his son Erik, died three years later in 933, and was buried \"under a mound at Haugar in Karmtsund, near the church in Haugesund\" .\n\nm firstly ASA Haakonsdatter, daughter of Jarl HAAKON Grjotgardson [Ladejarl] & his wife ---.

Snorre names \"Gyda, daughter of King Eirik of Hordaland brought up as foster-child in the house of a great bonde in Valdres\", narrating that, when King Harald asked for her hand she refused, saying that she would only marry the person who ruled the whole of Norway, which inspired him to conquer the country . Snorre records their marriage in a later passage .\n\nm thirdly SVANHILD, daughter of EYSTEIN \"Glumra\" Jarl of the Uplanders [in Kristian and Hedemarken] & his wife ---.

Snorre names \"Ragnhild the Mighty, a daughter of King Eirik from Jutland\" as one of the wives of King Harald, commenting that \"it is said that he put away nine wives\" when he married her . According to Snorre, \"Queen Ragnhild the Mighty\" lived three years after she came to Norway .\n\nMistress (1): ---. The name of King Harald's first mistress is not known.\n\nMistress (2): THORA Mosterstang, daughter of ---. Snorre names Thora Mosterstang \"from Moster connected with Kare Aslakson of Hordaland\" as the mother of King Harald's son Haakon .\n\nIn addition to the sons referred to below, the Historia Norwegie names \"sextus Gunrodus decimus Eusteinus, XI Iorundus, XIII Ynguar, XIV Truggui, XV Ringr, XVI Rolfr\" as sons of \"Haraldus Comatus\" .

He was named after, and brought up by, \"Guthorm the Duke\" who ruled Viken and the Uplands in the king's absence . After the death of Guthorm's fosterfather at Tunsberg, King Harald installed his son Guthorm as chief in his place . In his father's division of territories, he was confirmed as king in the land from Glommen to Svinasund and Ranrike . He was killed by Solve \"Klofe\" while defending Viken against attack , dated from the chronology of the passages to after his father's division of his territories.\n\n2. HALFDAN \"Swarti/the Black\" (-Trondheim [932]). Snorre names \"the eldest Guthorm, Halfdan \"the Black\" and Halfdan \"the White\" twins and Sigfrod fourth\" as the four sons of King Harald and his wife Asa .

After attempting to murder his half-brother Erik at a farm at Solve in More, Halfdan was reconciled with Erik after Guthorm Sindre intervened with King Harald . On his father's abdication in favour of Halfdan's half-brother Erik, Halfdan \"also took a king's high seat\" ruling over Tröndheim \"with the consent of all the people\". He died suddenly at a feast in Tröndheim 2 years later, \"the general report was that Gunhild [wife of his half-brother Erik] had bribed a witch to give him a death drink\" .\n\n3.

Under his father's division of territories, the land north of Trondheim was granted to Halfdan \"the Black\", Halfdan \"the White\" and Sigröd . Halfdan \"the White\" was killed in battle in Eistland [Estonia], fighting alongside his brother Halfdan the Black , dated from the chronology of the passages to after his father's division of territories.\n\n4.

Snorre names \"the eldest Guthorm, Halfdan \"the Black\" and Halfdan \"the White\" twins and Sigfrod fourth\" as the four sons of King Harald and his wife Asa . Under his father's division of territories, the land north of Trondheim was granted to Halfdan \"the Black\", Halfdan \"the White\" and Sigrod . Sigröd was chosen as king at Tröndheim after the death of his brother Halfdan. After his father's death he took \"all the revenues of the Tröndheim country\" with which his half-brother King Erik I was \"very ill-pleased\".

Snorre records that he was fostered by \"the herse Thorer Hroaldson\" after his mother's death , in a later passage that this was in the Fjord district . Under his father's division of territories, Halogaland, North More and Raumsdal were granted to Eirik . He succeeded in [930] on the abdication of his father as ERIK I \"Blodøks/Blood-axe\" Over-King of Norway. He conquered Viken in 934 after defeating his half-brothers Olav King of Viken and Sigröd King of Tröndheim at Tunsberg . His support diminished after the return to Norway of his half-brother Haakon, and he fled in [935/36] to Orkney where he established himself as king and took to piracy because he had little land. The Historia Norwegie records that he was deposed after ruling one year and fled to England where he was baptised and appointed \"toti Northimbrie comes\" by King Athelstan . Clare Downham discusses other sources which cast doubt on the co-identity of Erik I King of Norway with Erik King of York . King Athelstan established him as vassal king at York in 939, on condition that he and his family accepted baptism . He was expelled from York in 940 by Athelstan's successor King Edmund I . Orkneyinga Saga records that Earls Arnkel and Erlend, the sons of Turf-Einar joined ex-King Eirik after he was expelled from Northumbria by Edmund King of England and that they sailed to the Hebrides, looted in Ireland and Strathclyde, until they were killed in battle against Olaf King of Northumbria . He returned as King of York after a Danish revolt 947-948, but was driven out in 949 by Olaf Sihtricson. Florence of Worcester records that \"quondam Danica stirpe progenitum, Yrcum\" was made king of Northumbria, undated but dateable to [949] from the context . After the latter was deposed, Erik became king of York once more 952-954 until the Northumbrians rose against him and defeated him. He was killed by Maccus son of Harald Sihtricsson King of Limerick. Simeon of Durham records that \"the last of the kings of [Northumbria] Eiric\" was killed by \"Muccus the son of Onlaf\" . m ([922]) GUNHILD, daughter of --- ([910/20]-after 970). The primary sources are contradictory concerning Gunhild's parentage. According to the Historia Norwegie, she was GUNHILD, daughter of GORM den Gamle/the Old King of Denmark & his wife Tyre, this source recording the marriage of \"Ericus Blothex\" and \"de Dania Gunnildam Gorms Stultissimi Danorum regis filiam ac Thyri\" and specifying that she was \"malificam et iniquissimam\" . According to Snorre, she was the daughter of Ozur \"Tote\", a Finn who lived in Halogaland , in a later passage stating that she was \"clever with much knowledge and lively but a very false person and very cruel in disposition\" . Snorre names \"Eyvind Skreyja and Alf Askman\" as brothers of Gunhild, when recording that they joined the army of Harald Eirikson and were killed in battle . Her birth date range is estimated from her allegedly having nine sons by her husband, who were probably born in the range [935/50] if the indications in Snorre's narrative are correct. If this is correct, she was probably older than her brother Harald King of Denmark, assuming that her Danish origin is correct. Gunhild returned to Orkney with her sons after her husband's death , departing in [spring/summer] 955 for Denmark where her sons were granted fiefs by King Harald. The Historia Norwegie records that she returned with her sons to \"fratrem suum Haraldum regem Danorum\" after her husband was murdered . After her son succeeded as king of Norway, she was known as the \"King mother\" and exercised considerable influence in governing the country . She returned to Orkney with her surviving sons after the defeat of her son King Harald in [965] at Limfiord .

According to Snorre, in [955] he was adopted as foster son by Harald King of Denmark who \"set him on his knee\" , which implies that Harald was not yet an adult at the time. He defeated and killed his uncle in battle and succeeded him in 960 as HARALD II \"Gråfeld/Greyskin\" King of Norway. According to Snorre, his nickname was earned after he bought a grey skin from a trader from Iceland, all his retainers following his example .

He was ransomed by \"Olauo suo cognato\" who had been sent as ambassador to \"rege Ruscie\" . He left Garderike for Norway, meeting his first wife in Vindland where he remained for 3 years until she died, after which he adopted a marauding lifestyle .

Consistent with Hlawitschkas hypothesis concerning the identity of Burislaw/Burizleif of the Wends, discussed in Chapter 4 of the document MECKLENBURG, Gyda/Geira is shown with alternative Wendish and Polish ancestry. Snorre names \"Geira, Gunhild and Astrid\" as the three daughters of \"in Vindland a king called Burizleif\", recording that Geira was queen in the part of the country in which Olav landed when returning from Garderike.

He defeated Erik Haakonsson Ladejarl Regent of Norway at Nesjar and succeeded in imposing himself 1016 as OLAV II King of Norway. The Gwentian Chronicle records that \"Eulaf came to the island of Britain to Menevia and devastated Dyved\" in 1021 . He reunified Norway, by incorporating the interior eastern parts of the country and the Vik area. He imposed a feudal system of administration modelled on Normandy, where he had spent time in his youth. The heads of the major farming families entered his service as vassals (\"lendmenn\") in return for receiving revenues from royal farms and a share of fines imposed by the courts. He completed the process of Christianisation of Norway, became head of the church in Norway and appointed a national bishop, placed under the supervision of the Archbishop of Bremen. Ecclesiastical administration was organised under an Act passed by a national meeting (\"riksting\") in 1024. In alliance with Sweden, King Olav defeated Knud King of Denmark in a naval battle off Scania. However, his Swedish allies deserted him, and revolt broke out against him in Norway. He was forced into exile in 1028 by King Knud, who imposed himself as king of Norway. Olav sought refuge in Russia with his brother-in-law Iaroslav Grand Prince of Kiev. He was defeated and killed on his return to Norway in 1030. Adam of Bremen records that King Olav died \"IV Kal Aug\" and that he reigned 12 years .

His date of birth is suggested by Morkinskinna which records King Magnus´s twentieth birthday the following spring, dateable from the context to 1044 . He was recalled from Novgorod by chiefs from the Trondheim area who were dissatisfied with Danish rule, and installed in 1035 as MAGNUS II \"the Good\" King of Norway. He claimed the throne of Denmark in 1042, on the basis of an alleged agreement with King Hardaknud in 1039. He also claimed the throne of England on the same basis, maybe with the support of Queen Emma . He threatened to invade England but was too preoccupied with conquering Denmark to carry out the threat . He was master of Denmark before the end of 1046.

Morkinskinna names (in order) Gudrødr Hálfdan Ingibjorg Gunnhildr, Haraldr as the children of Sigurdr sýr and his wife Ásta daughter of Gudbrandr . The Historia Norwegie names Harald as son of \"Siwardus Scroffa rex montanus\" & his wife . Morkinskinna refers to Haraldr Sigurdarson as uncle of Magnus II King of Norway, but in a later passage recites his descent from Harald hárfagri to Sigurdr hrisi to Hálfdan, father of Sigurdr sýr, the father of Haraldr . Wounded at the battle of Stiklestad in support of his half-brother King Olav II in 1030 when he was 15 years old, he fled to Russia where he served in the army against the Poles and Wends . He made his way to Constantinople, where he served in the imperial army under George Maniakis and was made chief of the imperial guard by Empress Zoe . He was imprisoned on accusations of having defrauded the emperor of treasure, but was able to escape and make his way back to Russia . According to Snorre, he wanted to marry the \"beautiful young niece\" of Empress Zoe, \"carried her away by force\" while he made his escape from Constantinople but allowed her ashore \"with a good retinue to escort her back to Constantinople\" . This story is not corroborated in Byzantine sources. Morkinskinna recounts the same story but refers to the lady as the maiden Maria without specifying any relationship to the empress . William of Malmesbury alludes to the same episode when he says that Harald \"was exposed to a lion, for having ravished a woman of quality, [and] strangled the beast by the bare strength of his arms\" . He was in Jerusalem in 1034 . He became Joint King of Norway with his nephew Magnus I in 1046, and succeeded him in 1047 as HARALD III \"Hardråde\" King of Norway. He founded the city of Oslo in 1048. He defeated Svend II Estridsen King of Denmark at Nissa in 1062, but made peace at Gota in 1064. He claimed to succeed to the throne of England after the death of Edward \"the Confessor\" King of England, landed in Scotland where he joined forces with Tostig Godwinsson, brother of Harold II King of England. After defeating the Northumbrians at Gate Fulford near York 20 Sep 1066, he and his army were defeated by King Harold's forces at Stamford Bridge 25 Sep 1066, where both he and Tostig were killed. Snorre records that King Harald was fifty years old when he died and that his body was transported to Nidaros and \"buried in Mary church which he had built\" . Morkinskinna records that King Harald´s body was brought back to Norway by Skuli Tostigson and that he now lies buried at Elgisetr where Archbishop Eysteinn had him delivered .\n\nm ([1044]) IELIZAVETA Iaroslavna, daughter of IAROSLAV I \"Mudriy/the Wise\" Vladimirovich Grand Prince of Kiev & his second wife Ingigerd Olafsdottir of Sweden (-after 25 Sep 1066). Snorre records the marriage of King Harald and Elisabeth \"called by the Northmen Ellisif\" daughter of \"King Jarisleif \", specifying in a later passage that \"the Swedish king Olaf was brother of [her] mother\" . Morkinskinna records the marriage of Haraldr Sigurdarson and King Yaroslav and Queen Ingigerdr daughter Elisabeth, the Norsemen call her Ellisif after Harald´s return from Constantinople . Snorre records that \"Queen Ellisif came from the West with her stepson Olaf and her daughter Ingegerd\" after her husband was killed .\n\nMistress (1): THORA Thorbergsdatter, daughter of THORBERG Arnesson [Arnung] from Giske & his wife Ragnhild Erlingsdatter ([1020/25-after 1066). Morkinskinna records that King Harald had married the daughter of Thorbergr Árnason Thóra . Snorre names \"Thora, daughter of Thorberg Arnason\" as mother of King Harald's sons Magnus and Olav, in a later passage clarifying that she was \"Fin Arnason's brother's daughter\" . Her birth date range is estimated on the assumption that her relationship with King Harald started around the time of his accession to the Norwegian throne, corroborated by the fact that her son King Magnus was old enough to have fathered a son before his death in 1069. She gave birth to a son by another relationship, as shown by Snorre recording that her grandson \"Hakon was fostered by Thorer of Steig in Gudbrandsdal, who was a brother of King Magnus by the mother's side\" , although no indication has yet been found of the identity of Thorer's father. It is assumed that this relationship predated her relationship with King Harald, as it is likely that Thorer was older than his half-brother King Magnus to have been chosen as foster-father for his nephew. According to Europäische Stammtafeln , Thora Thorbergsdotter is identified with Thora who was the wife of Svend II King of Denmark and mother of King Svend's son Magnus. Christiansen considers that this identification is far-fetched, considering Thora's age at the time of the supposed marriage . There appears to be another chronological problem: the proposed consecration of Thora's son Magnus at Rome is best explained if he was King Svend's oldest son, which would place his birth (and therefore his parents' marriage) in the late 1030s. Morkinskinna records that King Harald left his wife Thora and his daughter Máría in Orkney when he sailed for England .\n\nKing Harald III & his wife had two children:\n\n1. INGEGÄRD Haraldsdatter.

Snorre records the marriage of \"Olaf, the Danish King Svein's son\" and \"Ingegerd, a daughter of King Harald and sister of King Olaf of Norway\" . Morkinskinna records that King Olav married his sister Ingigerdr to óláfr, the son of Danish king Sveinn, dated from the context to soon after Olav succeeded as sole king in Norway .

Morkinskinna records that King Harald had promised his daughter Máría to Eystein Orri when they returned after their invasion of England in 1066 . Snorre records that \"Maria, a daughter of Harald Sigurdson\" died \"a sudden death the very day and hour her father King Harald fell\" .

MAGNUS Haraldsson ([1045/50]-Nidaros 28 Apr 1069, bur Nidaros). Snorre names Magnus and Olav as the sons of King Harald and Thora . Morkinskinna names the older Magnus, the younger Óláfr as the two sons of King Harald and the daughter of Thorbergr Árnason Thóra . The Gwentian Chronicle records that \"Macht son of Harallt came to Wales with a great army and the Prince Grufudd and Macht with combined forces proceeded against the Saxons and returned to Wales with great spoil\" in 1059 . The dating of this passage seems early for it to apply to Magnus, son of Harald III King of Norway, but no other contemporary with this name has so far been identified to whom it can apply. If the identification is correct, Magnus must have been born earlier than indicated above. Another possibility is that the Gwentian Chronicle is indicating one of the brothers of the future Harold II King of England, incorrectly named. Magnus may have fought with his father at Stamford Bridge 1066 . His birth date range is estimated on the assumption that his father's relationship with his mother took place around the time of his accession to the Norwegian throne. He succeeded his father in 1066 as MAGNUS II King of Norway, jointly with his brother Olav, ruling in the northern part of the country for two years .

He succeeded in 1093 as HAAKON II King of Norway. Snorre records that, when Magnus son of King Olav III was proclaimed king at Viken, the \"Upland people on hearing of King Olaf's death chose Hakon, Thorer's foster-son\" and that he was proclaimed king of half Norway in Trondheim . Snorre records that King Magnus travelled north to Trondheim to impose his authority but that Haakon died on the mountains while out hunting ptarmigan, aged \"full twenty five years old\", and was buried at Christ Church . Morkinskinna records that after Haakon died, the people of Trondheim took Sveinn, the son of Haraldr flettir (Despoiler) as their king, adding that King Magnus forced him to flee to Denmark where he remained until he became reconciled with King Eysteinn Magnusson .\n\n4.

Morkinskinna records that Skjaldvor sister of King Magnús berfoettr married Sigurdr Hranason .

Snorre records that his sons Eystein, Sigurd and Olav took the kingdom of Norway after their father's death, recording that Sigurd was 13 or 14 years old when he was chosen king . Albert of Aix records that \"frater regis de Nortwega, Magnus\" arrived at the port of Ascalon and, in a later passage, that he helped besiege Sidon by sea . Assuming that the reference to Norway is correct, \"Magnus\" is presumably an error for \"Sigurd\".

According to Morkinskinna, King Magnus arranged the marriage of his son Sigurdr to Malcolm king of the Scots his daughter when in Orkney . This clearly refers to the same person as Biadmunia as Morkinskinna adds that the ages of the children as five and nine, as recorded in Orkneyinga Saga. However, the suggestion that her father was King Malcolm is clearly anachronistic in view of the king´s death in 1093. Morkinskinna records that Sigurd left the daughter of King Malcolm of the Scots behind in the west and did not wish to be married to her after his father died . m firstly (divorced 1128) as her first husband, MALMFRID Mstislavna, daughter of MSTISLAV I \"the Great\" Grand Prince of Kiev & his first wife Christine of Sweden (-after 1137).

Snorre names \"Christina, a daughter of King Sigurd the Crusader and Queen Malmfrid\" as the wife of Erling . Morkinskinna names Kristín as the daughter of King Sigurdr jórsalafari and Queen Malmfrídr . This is confirmed by the Saga of King Sverre which records the marriage of \"Ragnhild daughter of Earl Erling and Kristin Kings-daughter\" and \"Halkel son of Jon Hallkelsson\" .
