        "text": "At an evening ball, Astrid, a Swedish princess, danced all night with Leopold of Belgium. And as the night progressed, Leopold and Astrid never left each other's side. Some months later, King Albert I and Queen Elisabeth of Belgium invited the press to the royal palace in Brussels. \"The Queen and I, declared Albert, would like to announce to you the impending marriage between Prince Leopold, Duke of Brabant and the Princess Astrid of Sweden. We are convinced that the princess will bring joy and happiness to our son. Leopold and Astrid have decided to join their lives without any pressures or reasons of state. Theirs is a true union among people with the same inclinations.\"\n\nIn Stockholm, on 4 November 1926 civilly and religiously in Brussels on 10 November, Princess Astrid married Crown Prince Leopold of Belgium, the son of King Albert I of Belgium and his wife, Queen Elisabeth, born Duchess Elisabeth in Bavaria. It was a happy and devoted marriage. Astrid was enthusiastically adopted by the Belgians. She was widely loved for her beauty, charm and simplicity. Her public and official engagements irradiated enthusiasm. In 1927 Leopold and Astrid had a daughter, Princess Jos√©phine-Charlotte. Their first son, Prince Baudouin eventually succeeded his father as King of the Belgians."
