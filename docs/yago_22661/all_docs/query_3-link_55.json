Snorre records the birth of Olav son of Harald \"Grenske\" & his wife in Summer 995, implying that he was born after his father was killed[248]. The Historia Norwegie names \"Olauum perpetuum regem Norwegie\" as son of \"Haroldum Grensca\" & his wife[249]. According to William of JumiÃ¨ges, Olav was christened [998] at Rouen[250]. He defeated Erik Haakonsson Ladejarl Regent of Norway at Nesjar[251] and succeeded in imposing himself 1016 as OLAV II King of Norway. The Gwentian Chronicle records that \"Eulaf came to the island of Britainâ¦to Meneviaâ¦and devastated Dyved\" in 1021[252]. He reunified Norway, by incorporating the interior eastern parts of the country and the Vik area. He imposed a feudal system of administration modelled on Normandy, where he had spent time in his youth. The heads of the major farming families entered his service as vassals (\"lendmenn\") in return for receiving revenues from royal farms and a share of fines imposed by the courts. He completed the process of Christianisation of Norway, became head of the church in Norway and appointed a national bishop, placed under the supervision of the Archbishop of Bremen. Ecclesiastical administration was organised under an Act passed by a national meeting (\"riksting\") in 1024. In alliance with Sweden, King Olav defeated Knud King of Denmark in a naval battle off Scania. However, his Swedish allies deserted him, and revolt broke out against him in Norway. He was forced into exile in 1028 by King Knud, who imposed himself as king of Norway. Olav sought refuge in Russia with his brother-in-law Iaroslav Grand Prince of Kiev. He was defeated and killed on his return to Norway in 1030. Adam of Bremen records that King Olav died \"IV Kal Aug\" and that he reigned 12 years[253]. Soon after his death he was seen as a national hero, and considered a saint. m (Feb 1019) ASTRID Olofsdottir, illegitimate daughter of OLOF \"Skotkoning\" King of Sweden & his mistress ---. Snorre names \"Emund, Astrid, Holmfrid\" as the children of King Olof by his concubine Edla, specifying that Astrid was brought up in West Gautland in the house of Egil[254]. Adam of Bremen records that the wife of Olav King of Norway was \"rege Sueonumâ¦filiam\"[255]. The Historia Norwegie records that Olav married \"soror Margarete\" after his betrothal to the latter was terminated by her marriage to \"rex Iarezlafus de Ruscia\"[256]. Snorre records the marriage of King Olav and \"Astrid, daughter of the Swedish king Olaf\"[257]. Her marriage was arranged to appease Swedish opposition to King Olav II's recently assumed rule. She remained in Sweden with her daughter when her husband left for Russia[258]. Mistress (1): ALVHILD [Elfhildis], daughter of --- (-after 1047). Snorre names \"Alfhildâ¦the king's slave-womanâ¦of good descent\"[259]. According to William of Malmesbury, she was English and captured by the Norwegians. Morkinskinna records that King MagnusÂ´s mother grieved for her son when he died[260]. King Olav II & his wife had one child:"
