        "text": "Template:Norwegian Royal Family\n\nPrincess Astrid, Mrs. Ferner (Astrid Maud Ingeborg; born 12 February 1932) is the second daughter of King Olav V and his wife, Princess Märtha of Sweden. She is the older sister of King Harald V of Norway and younger sister of the late Princess Ragnhild.\n\nLife[]\n\nPrincess Astrid was born on 12 February 1932 at Villa Solbakken to the future King Olav V and Crown Princess Märtha. She was baptized in the Palace Chapel on 31 March 1932 and her godparents were: her paternal grandparents, King Haakon VII and Queen Maud of Norway; her maternal grandparents, Prince Carl and Princess Ingeborg of Sweden; her maternal aunt, Princess Astrid, Duchess of Brabant; Elizabeth, Duchess of York (later Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother); her grandaunt, Princess Thyra of Denmark; her granduncle, Prince Eugen of Sweden; and Prince George of the United Kingdom. Princess Astrid was named after her maternal aunt, paternal grandmother, and maternal grandmother.[1]\n\nPrincess Astrid grew up on the royal estate of Skaugum in Asker and was privately educated during her childhood. During World War II, she joined her family fleeing the Nazis and spent the war with her mother, brother and sister in exile in Washington, DC.[2] Following the royal family's return to Norway she attended Nissen's Girls' School and graduated with the examen artium university entrance exam in 1950.[3] She then studied economics and political history for two years at Oxford University.\n\nHer Confirmation took place on 9 May 1948 in the Palace Chapel.\n\nThe princess later learnt other skills including dressmaking and cooking and pursued her interests in handicrafts.Template:Cn Princess Astrid studied ceramics with Halvor Sandøs.\n\nPrincess Astrid's mother died on 5 April 1954 from cancer at age 53 when Astrid was 22 years old.Template:CN From her mother's death until her brother's marriage in August 1968, Princess Astrid was the senior lady of the court and acted as first lady of Norway, working side-by-side with her father on all representation duties, including state visits.[1] Princess Astrid raised her family in Vinderen; she now lives in Nordmarka, Oslo. Her hobbies include knitting, embroidery, reading and painting porcelain.Template:Cn\n\nIn 2002, the Government granted the Princess an honorary pension in recognition of all her efforts on behalf of Norway both during and following her years as first lady.[4] In 2005, she took part in ceremonies marking the 60th anniversary of the end of World War II, including the unveiling of a plaque marking the Norwegian monarch's exile in London.[5]\n\nIn February 2012, Princess Astrid celebrated her 80th birthday with a private dinner at the Royal Palace in Oslo.[6]\n\nMarriage and children[]\n\nPrincess Astrid married divorced commoner Johan Martin Ferner in Asker Church on 12 January 1961. Together, the couple have five children, seven grandchildren, and as of 2023, three great-grandchildren.[7]\n\nPatronages[]\n\nTemplate:Prose Princess Astrid is chair of the board of Crown Princess Märtha’s Memorial Fund which provides financial support to social and humanitarian initiatives carried out by non-governmental organisations.[8]\n\nShe is a patron of several organisations.
