Nice custom, does anyone know how it arose?\n\nThe myrtle crown is a swedish Custom. There is also the custom to wear myrtle that came from the UK. Queen Vicotoria did it first and her granddaughter Margaret planted a peace from Victoria's myrtle bush at Sofiero and her daughter Ingrid again planted a peace from her mother's bush at Fredensborg.\n\nLast edited: Jan 22, 2014\n\nVasillisos Markos\n\nSerene Highness\n\nJoined\n\nMay 24, 2009\n\nMessages\n\n1,160\n\nCity\n\nCrete\n\nCountry\n\nUnited States\n\nYes, I read that both royal brides transplanted pieces of the myrtle in their crowns to their new homes. Very nice custom. IMO, however, the myrtle crowns do not look good perched on top of the veil and seems out of place with the beautiful gowns.\n\neejm\n\nCommoner\n\nJoined\n\nJun 14, 2008\n\nMessages\n\n20\n\nCity\n\nMount Juliet\n\nCountry\n\nUnited States\n\nToday most royal brides who have separate civil and religious ceremonies have different dresses as well, but the civil wedding ensemble is usually a suit or a very simple dress. While she wore the same veil for her two weddings (although she wore the veil differently for each) Astrid had two very different and very opulent dresses for each ceremony. I wonder if her family paid for one dress and Leopold's paid for the other?\n\nThe two were also only allowed four hours alone together after the civil ceremony as they had not yet had their religious wedding."
