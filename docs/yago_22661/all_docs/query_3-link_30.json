As with the case of Denmark, it is impossible to distinguish myth from fact, assuming that there is any fact, in the narratives contained in early primary sources. The lists of kings of Sweden in the earliest sources are completely different from each other, and any attempt to reconcile them appears futile . The names of these semi-legendary kings have not been copied into this document. It is probable that some of the confusion results from competing kings ruling in different parts of the country at the same time. It is likely that Gotland, Uppsala and Vermeland/Raumarik in the west each had its own monarchs, although there appears to be no proof in primary sources that this speculation is correct. This uncertainty in the early king lists leads to difficulties in the numbering of the later kings. For example, there is considerable confusion over the numbering of the different kings named Erik prior to the accession of the king who is generally known as Erik XII in 1344. In this document, these earlier kings named Erik have not been assigned numbers.\n\nAn outline genealogy of the first dynasty of Swedish kings, who ruled in the 10th and 11th centuries, can be reconstructed from available primary sources (see Chapter 1). After the extinction in the male line of this first dynasty in 1060, the Swedish throne was assumed by Stenkil Ragnvaldson whose connection with the preceding dynasty appears tenuous. His father is recorded in Heimkringsla, written nearly two centuries later although possibly based on earlier sources which no longer survive, as Jarl in Västergötland in the south of Sweden (see Chapter 2.A). Stenkil is described in different sources as nepos of the previous king Emund or as his son-in-law. There is no way of judging which of these hypotheses might be correct. It is also possible that there was no family relationship at all, but that a connection was invented by later chroniclers to emphasise continuity between the two dynasties. As will be seen below, few primary sources have been found which confirm the family relationships in the dynasty of kings founded by Stenkil.\n\nIn the late 11th and 12th centuries, three new dynasties of Swedish kings emerged, none of which appears to have been related to the others (Chapter 2.B, C and D). Power switched between these dynasties throughout the period. The impression is that, during the 10th to 12th centuries, different nobles established themselves in different parts of the country which was later unified into Sweden, and that during this period there was little united government. One explanation may simply be geographical. For example, developments around Uppsala in eastern central Sweden would have had limited access westwards across the mountain ranges which form the backbone of the Scandinavian peninsula. There may also have been limited communication with groupings established further south because of the chain of lakes which lies across central Sweden south of a latitudinal line drawn from Eskilstuna in the east to Karlstad in the west. These geographical limitations would also have discouraged contact with neighbouring countries further to the west and south. The Swedes would not have had easy access to the ripe pickings in the British Isles and along the mainland European coast from Friesland to the northern Iberian peninsula, which provided such tempting prizes for their Viking neighbours in Norway and Denmark. Sweden´s focus would more naturally have been directed eastwards to southern Finland and western Russia, with contact in those areas being motivated by trade rather than plunder. Dating also presents a problem during this period. Insufficient sources have been found to indicate that the precise dates attributed to most of these kings in secondary works are reliable. In addition, few matrimonial alliances are recorded during this period between the Swedish kings and other ruling families apart from with their neighbours in Norway and Denmark, which suggests relative isolation and a rather stunted level of development as a unified national entity.\n\nGreater stability and continuity in the rulers of Sweden can be observed from the mid-13th century with the accession of King Valdemar of the Folkingaätten dynasty (see Chapter 3). From this time, matrimonial alliances with foreign dynasties multiplied, including connections with families who ruled in northern Germany and Poland as well as with the other Scandinavian monarchies. Inheritance of the crown settled within the same family, although a shortage of male heirs among the Norwegian, Danish as well as Swedish royal families resulted in temporary personal unification of some or all of the Scandinavians thrones. The Swedish and Norwegian crowns were united from 1319 to 1344 and from 1362 to 1363, the Danish and Norwegian thrones from 1381 to 1387, and all three were combined from 1389 to 1448.\n\nSources for early Swedish history are sparse. Snorre´s Heimkringsla series of Sagas and Morkinskinna include some information relating to Swedish kings. However, the factual accuracy of these works is debatable, especially relating to events before the 12th century. This question is discussed more fully in the introduction to the document NORWAY KINGS. Adam of Bremen and Saxo Grammaticus both include some information relating to Sweden. There appear to be no surviving contemporary Swedish-produced sources to complement this foreign documentation, another factor pointing to the under-development of the territory at that time. The first volume of the Diplomatarium Suecanum presents Swedish charters from 817 to 1285 . However, the compilation includes only about thirty documents dated to before the mid-12th century, and none of these include any relevant information relating to the Swedish kings or their families. It is somewhat surprising that even Papal documentation addressed to Swedish bishops does not name the Swedish kings. Even after the mid-12th century, the charters contain little relevant genealogical detail, in contrast to similar documents produced in other European countries.\n\nChapter 1. KINGS of SWEDEN to 1060\n\nAccording to Heimskringla of Snorre Sturleson , the early kings of Sweden were as follows. There is little reason to be confident about the order and dating of these kings. If their names are correct, it would appear to extend the known history of the Swedish kings back to the early 9th century.\n\n1.BJÖRN [I] \"Ironside\" .\n\n2.ERIK [I] Björnson .\n\n3.ERIK [II] Raefilson .\n\n4.BJÖRN [II] . Reigned at Uppsala.\n\n5.EMUND . Reigned in the south.\n\na)ERIK [III] Emundson (-[880/85]) . Snorre records that \"Eirik Eymundson king of Sweden\" conquered Vermaland and areas to the north to Svinasund, calling the territory \"West Gautland\", and appointed Hrane Gauzke as jarl . Snorre records the death of King Eirik Eymundson when King Harald had been \"ten years king of all Norway\" . As the dating of the accession of King Harald \"Hårfagre/Harfagri/Fairhair\" is itself open to doubt, this is of little use in calculating the precise date of death of King Erik.\n\ni)BJÖRN [III] Erikson . Snorre names Bjorn as son of Eirik Eymundson when recording that he was \"king of Svithjod for fifty years\" .\n\n(a)ERIK [IV] . Snorre names \"Eirik the Victorious and Olaf, the father of Styrbjorn\" as the sons of Bjorn Eriksson .\n\n(b)OLOF . He was Olof Bjarnarson according to the 13th century Knytlinga Saga . Snorre names \"Eirik the Victorious and Olaf, the father of Styrbjorn\" as the sons of Bjorn Eriksson .\n\n(1) [STYRBJÖRN [Björn] \"den Starke/the Strong\" (-killed in battle [Fyrisvellir] near Uppsala [985]). He was the son of Olof Bjarnarson according to the 13th century Knytlinga Saga . (see below).]\n\n6.ERIK Arsael . [1001].\n\nAdam of Bremen names \"Ring cum filiis Herich et Edmund\" as kings \"apud Sueones\", specifying that \"Anund, Bern, Olaph\" were among his predecessors . As can be seen, there is no way to reconcile the reconstruction according to Adam of Bremen, combined with Saxo Grammaticus, with the list in Heimskringla until the accession of Erik \"Segersäll/the Victorious\" King of Sweden, dated to the mid-980s.\n\n1.ANUND .\n\n2.BJÖRN .\n\n3.OLOF .\n\n4.RING . Adam of Bremen names \"Ring cum filiis Herich et Edmund\" as kings \"apud Sueones\", specifying that \"Anund, Bern, Olaph\" were among his predecessors . The paragraph is undated but precedes one dealing with events in 936. Two children:\n\na)EMUND .\n\nb)ERIK . Three children:\n\ni)EMUND Erikson . Adam of Bremen records that \"Emund filius Herici\" reigned in Sweden , the paragraph being undated but following the one which records the succession of Emperor Otto III in 983.\n\nii)BJÖRN Erikson . Saxo Grammaticus names him as father of Styrbjorn in the passage quoted below, although Knytlinga records a different parentage (see below). No source has been found which names Björn in his own right. m ---. The name of Björns wife is not known. Björn & his wife had [two] children:\n\n(a) [STYRBJÖRN [Björn] \"den Starke/the Strong\" (-killed in battle [Fyrisvellir] near Uppsala [985]) . He was the son of King Björn according to Saxo Grammaticus . He was the son of Olof Bjarnarson according to the 13th century Knytlinga Saga . Saxo Grammaticus records that Sturbionus, Suetici regis Biornonis filius was deposed by patrui Olaui filio, Erico, despite help from Haraldum [Harald I King of Denmark], cui Thyra mater extitit, cum sorore Gyritha supplex migravit...quanto illi eiusdem sororis sue matrimonium...permisit, dated to [984/85], noting that King Harald armis Sclavia potitus appointed Sturbiorno duce to lead apud Iulinum [presumably Jomsborg]...illius provincie oppidum...militum . Saxo Grammaticus records that Styrbjörn was killed in battle while trying to regain his throne . The primary source which confirms the location of this battle has not been identified.] m as her first husband, TYRE Haraldsdatter, daughter of HARALD I \"Blåtand/Bluetooth\" King of Denmark & his [first wife Gunhild ---] (-18 Sep [1000]). The primary source which confirms her first marriage has not been identified. She married secondly ([987], divorced) as his [third] wife, Bołeslaw of Poland, or (less likely) as his [---] wife, Burislaw Prince of the Wends. The Historia Norwegie, when recording her third marriage, says that \"sororem Sweinonis regis Tyri\" had earlier been betrothed to \"dux quidam de Sclauia\" . Follow the two hyperlinks for discussion about the identity of her second husband. She married thirdly (Tønsberg 998) as his third wife, Olav I Trygveson King of Norway. Snorre records Tyre's flight to Norway from her second husband and her subsequent marriage to King Olav . The Historia Norwegie records the marriage of King Olav and \"sororem Sweinonis regis Tyri\" . Adam of Bremen records the marriage of \"Olaph Trucconis filius\" and \"a Dania superbissimam Thore\" soon after he returned to Norway after exile in England . Adam of Bremen records that, after the death of her husband, his wife starved herself to death .\n\n(b) [GYRITHA of Sweden . Gyritha and her alleged marriage are only referred to in Saxo Grammaticus, who says that King Styrbjörn granted King Harald his sister in marriage after seeking his help after being deposed: Saxo records that Sturbionus, Suetici regis Biornonis filius was deposed by patrui Olaui filio, Erico, despite help from Haraldum [Harald I King of Denmark], cui Thyra mater extitit, cum sorore Gyritha supplex migravit...quanto illi eiusdem sororis sue matrimonium...permisit, dated to [984/85] . m ([984/85]) as his [third] wife, HARALD I \"Blåtand/Bluetooth\" King of Denmark, son of GORM \"den Gamle/the Old\" King of Denmark & his wife Tyre \"Danebod\" (before 935-Jomsborg 1 Dec [986/87], bur Roskilde Cathedral).]\n\niii)OLOF Erikson . He is named as Eriks father, and uncle of Styrbjorn, by Saxo Grammaticus (see below). No source has been found which names Olof in his own right. m ---. The name of Olofs wife is not known. Olof & his wife had one child:\n\n(a)ERIK (-[994/95]) . Saxo Grammaticus records that Sturbionus, Suetici regis Biornonis filius was deposed by patrui Olaui filio, Erico, despite help from Haraldum [Harald I King of Denmark], cui Thyra mater extitit, cum sorore Gyritha supplex migravit...quanto illi eiusdem sororis sue matrimonium...permisit, dated to [984/85] . He succeeded as ERIK \"Segersäll/the Victorious\" King of Sweden.\n\n- see below.\n\nERIK, son of [OLOF Erikson of Sweden] & his wife --- (-Uppsala [994/95]) . Snorre names \"Eirik the Victorious and Olaf, the father of Styrbjorn\" as the sons of Bjorn Eriksson . Saxo Grammaticus records that Sturbionus, Suetici regis Biornonis filius was deposed by patrui Olaui filio, Erico, despite help from Haraldum [Harald I King of Denmark], cui Thyra mater extitit, cum sorore Gyritha supplex migravit...quanto illi eiusdem sororis sue matrimonium...permisit, dated to [984/85] . The following source suggests that Erik received Polish help in deposing his cousin: one manuscript of Adam of Bremen records that \"Hericus rex Sueonum\" made a treaty with rege Polanorum Bolizlao and that Bolizlaus gave filiam vel sororem to Herico . This treaty can probably be dated to [985], consistent with the likely birth date of Eriks son Oluf (see below). At that time, although Bolesławs father Mieszko still ruled Poland, he was old and his son was probably already active on his own account. This suggestion is also consistent with King Eriks receiving Polish support when he expelled King Svend from Denmark in [987], and a Polish marriage being arranged as part of the terms of Svends later release from Jomsborg (see Chapter 4 in the document MECKLENBURG). He succeeded as ERIK \"Segersäll/the Victorious\" King of Sweden. Adam of Bremen records that \"rex Sueonum Hericus\" invaded Denmark and expelled Suein, derelictus a Deo, frustra sperans in ydolis suis, dated to after 987 when Svend succeeded as king . Saxo Grammaticus provides some further detail . Adam also records that King Erik was converted to Christianity and baptised in Denmark, but suggests that he may have relapsed into paganism on returning to Sweden . According to Snorre, Erik died \"in a sickbed at Uppsala 10 years after the death of Styrbjörn\" , and in another passage that his wife was a widow in 994 .\n\nThere is considerable confusion between the sources regarding King Eriks marriage(s):\n\n[m firstly ([before 980?] [repudiated?]) [as her first husband,] SIGRID [Storråda/the Haughty], daughter of \"Skoglar\" Toste & his wife ---. . Snorre records that Toste had a daughter...proud and high-minded...Sigrid who married \"the Swedish king, Eirik the Victorious, and had a son by him...Olaf\" and, in another saga, that after his first wife died [named Gunhild by Snorre] the Danish king Svein Tjuguskeg married Sigrid the Haughty, a daughter of Skoglartoste, and mother of the Swedish king Olaf noting that by means of this relationship there was great friendship between the kings... . Fagrskinna also names Sigrid, mother of King Olof, as daughter of Skoglar-Tosta . These reports directly contradict all the sources quoted below (and in the document DENMARK KINGS) which indicate the Polish princess as the widow of the Swedish king and second wife of Svend (and also that she was the lady who was Storråda/the Haughty). Hlawitschka, as part of his discussion about the wives of Erik King of Sweden and Svend King of Denmark, attempts to resolve the confusion by suggesting that King Svend married firstly the composite person Gunhild, daughter of Skoglar Toste . This possibility cannot be dismissed, but the suggestion, in particular that Svends first wife was named Gunhild, is uncorroborated by primary sources except Snorre. The attempt also does not explain Snorres reference to Skoglar Tostes daughter marrying the Swedish king, by whom she was mother of his successor (which also contradicts other sources). Another possibility is presumably that Sigrid, daughter of Skoglar Toste, married firstly the Swedish king (as his first wife) who repudiated her, and secondly married the Danish king (also as his first wife) who may have repudiated her as well, in which case the confusion in the sources could be attributed to both Svends wives being named Sigrid. That is the solution which is shown here, for presentational purposes only, with no guarantee that it is correct.]\n\nm [secondly] ([985?]) as her first husband, SIGRID [Syritha] [Czcirada/Czirada/więtosława] [Storråda/the Haughty] of Poland, daughter of MIESZKO I Prince of Poland & his [first/seventh wife --- or [eighth] wife Dobrava [Dobroslawa] of Bohemia] (-[after Summer 1015]). Thietmar refers to the mother of \"filiis Suenni\" as \"Miseconis filia ducis, soror Bolizlavi successoris eius et nati [=cognati?, [eius?] referring to Svend?]\", commenting that a viro suimet [=Svend] diu depulsa non minimam cum cæteris perpessa est controversiam (\"long exiled by her husband this woman suffered no small amount of controversy\") [suggesting her repudiation, as discussed further below] . As these events occurred only about 15/20 years before Thietmar was writing (in [1012/18?]), his report is probably as reliable as could be expected. Adam of Bremen (writing [1075/85]) broadly reflects the same information, recording the marriage of King Svend and \"Herici relictam, matrem Olaph\" , another manuscript stating that \"Hericus rex Sueonum\" had made a treaty with rege Polanorum Bolizlao·and that Bolizlaus gave filiam vel sororem to Herico . Her two marriages are further confirmed by Adam who records that [her son by her first marriage] Olof King of Sweden (Olaph sane, qui post obitum patris Herici regnum super Suevos accepit) invaded Denmark, expelled infelicem Suein a regno and conquered the kingdom (et ipse optinuit Daniam), but that Olof restored Svend in regnum suum, eo quod matrem suam habuerit\" . Neither Thietmar nor Adam name the Polish kings supposed daughter. Saxo Grammaticus (writing about a century after Adam) confirms her name (but not her family origin) and two marriages, noting that King Svend married \"Syritha Suetiam\" after she was unsuccessfully wooed by Olav I King of Norway, and naming Olof King of Sweden as King Svend's stepson . Morkinskinna names \"Sigridr en stórráda\" as mother of the lady Ástrídr sister of two kings, Knútr the Great and Óláfr the Swede who married Jarl Úlfr sprakaleggr . Her name and second marriage are confirmed, and her first marriage suggested, by Saxo Grammaticus who states that King Svend married \"Syritha Suetiam\" after she was unsuccessfully wooed by Olav I King of Norway, and also refers to Olof King of Sweden as King Svend's stepson . The name Sigrid/Syritha could of course be a Norse/German adaptation of a Polish name. Hlawitschka analyses secondary sources which discuss Sigrids Polish origin, including those which propose alternative Polish names Czcirada/Czirada or więtosława . She married secondly ([995?]) as his second wife, Svend I \"Tveskæg/Forkbeard\"King of Denmark. Thietmars reference to Svend repudiating his second wife appears corroborated by Saxo Grammaticus who records that, after his father's death, Olof returned to Sweden [from Denmark] with \"his mother Syritha, and stayed there exercising his sovereignty under his mother's tutelage\" (Erici filius Olavus cum matre Syritha Suetiam repetivit, ibique degens regnum materno arbitrio subiectum habuit) . This passage suggests that Olof arrived in Denmark with his mother on her second marriage and returned to Sweden with her (presumably after Svend repudiated her), when he was still a minor. At some point, Sigrid presumably left Scandinavia and returned to her native homeland as the Encomium Emmæ Reginæ records that \"Cnuto\" [and his brother?] visited Sclavoniam in [Summer] 1015 and brought back matrem suam, quæ illuc morabatur [who was staying there] . The date of Sigrids death is not known. Sigrid of Poland was studied by Rafal T. Prinke (his article has not been studied in detail as it is in the Polish language) .\n\nKing Erik & his [second] wife had [two] children:\n\n1.OLOF ([985/86?]-[1022]) . Adam of Bremen names Olav as son of King Erik & his (unnamed) wife who later married Svend King of Denmark . Snorre names \"Olaf the Swede\" as the son of \"the Swedish king, Eirik the Victorious\" and his wife Sigrid . According to Saxo Grammaticus, after his father's death, he returned to Sweden [from Denmark] with \"his mother Syritha, and stayed there exercising his sovereignty under his mother's tutelage\" . He succeeded as OLOF I \"Skotkonung/under-King\" King of Sweden.\n\n- see below.\n\n2. [HOLMFRID . Snorre records the betrothal of \"Svein, a son of Earl Hakon, and Earl Eirik's brother\" and \"Holmfrid, a daughter of King Olaf the Swedish king\", although the chronology appears to suggest the likelihood that she was the sister rather than daughter of King Olav . If that is correct, the identity of her mother is uncertain, especially bearing in my mind the confusion in the sources relating to Eriks wife/wives. m SVEN Haakonsson Ladejarl of Norway, son of Jarl HAAKON Sigurdsson \"the Mighty\" & his wife Thora Skagadatter (-1016).]\n\nOLOF, son of ERIK \"Segersäll/the Victorious\" King of Sweden & his [second] wife Sigrid [\"Storråda/the Haughty\"] of Poland ([985/86?]-[1022]) . Adam of Bremen names Olav as son of King Erik & his (unnamed) wife who later married Svend King of Denmark . His date of birth is suggested based on the likely date of his parents marriage, after his fathers accession (see above). The question of Olofs age is confused by the two apparently contradictory texts of Adam of Bremen and Saxo Grammaticus, quoted below, which record Olofs invasion of Denmark. Snorre names \"Olaf the Swede\" as the son of \"the Swedish king, Eirik the Victorious\" and his wife Sigrid . He succeeded as OLOF I \"Skotkonung/under-King\" King of Sweden. Adam of Bremen records that Olof King of Sweden (Olaph sane, qui post obitum patris Herici regnum super Suevos accepit) invaded Denmark, expelled infelicem Suein a regno and conquered the kingdom (et ipse optinuit Daniam), but that Olof restored Svend in regnum suum, eo quod matrem suam habuerit\" . This passage in Adam is difficult to interpret. Considering the likely marriage date of Olofs parents (after his fathers accession to the Swedish throne, see above), King Olof was probably under 10 years old when his father died. On the other hand, Adams report suggests that he was acting as an adult at the time. Another perspective is provided by Saxo Grammaticus (writing about a century after Adam) who records that, after his father's death, Olof returned to Sweden [from Denmark] with \"his mother Syritha, and stayed there exercising his sovereignty under his mother's tutelage\" (Erici filius Olavus cum matre Syritha Suetiam repetivit, ibique degens regnum materno arbitrio subiectum habuit) . This passage suggests that Olof had not invaded Denmark at all, but had arrived there with his mother when she married King Svend and had returned to Sweden with her (presumably after Svend repudiated her, see Thietmars comment) when he was still a minor. He converted to Christianity and was baptised as \"JACOBUS\" .\n\nm ([before 1000]) ESTRED [of the Obotrites], daughter of ---. Adam of Bremen records that \"Olaph rex Sueonum\" married \"filiamque Sclavorum Estred nomine de Obodritis\" . Wigger dates the marriage to before 1000 . Hlawitschka suggests that, if Estred was actually de Obodritis, she must have been the daughter of Obodritenfürsten Mistui (ca. 967-990/95?) and sister of des um 1022 verstorbenen Fürsten Mistislav (ca. 990/95-1018) . However, he highlights Lübkes Regesten which suggests a connection with Wagria and that her father was Sederich (Mstidrag?) einen Wagrierfürsten , although Hlawitschka also notes Adam of Bremens description of Slavic peoples of the Baltic coast which suggests that Adam knew the distinction between the Obotrites and Wagrians (\"Populi Sclavorum multi, quorum primi sunt ab occidente confines Transalbianis Waigri; eorum civitas Aldiburg maritima. Deinde secuntur Obodriti, qui nunc Reregi vocantur, et civitas eorum Magnopolis [Mecklenburg]\" ). Lübke provides information about Sederich, Mstivoj and Mstidrag elsewhere . The general problem of defining the different peoples in the southern Baltic coast, and their territorial jurisdictions, is discussed in the Introduction to the document MECKLENBURG (the leaders named by Hlawitschka have not been identified in that document).\n\nMistress (1): EDLA, daughter of ---, from Vinland. Snorre names \"Edla, a daughter of an earl of Vindland\" as the concubine of King Olof .\n\nKing Olof & his wife had two children:\n\n1.INGIGERD Olafsdottir ([1000/03]-10 Feb 1050) . Snorre names \"the king's daughter Ingegerd\" when recording that she was used as intermediary to effect a reconciliation between her father and Olav Haraldson King of Norway, and that her marriage to the Norwegian king was proposed . Adam of Bremen names \"filius Iacobus et filia Ingrad\" as the children of \"Olaph rex Sueonum\" and his wife Estred, specifying that Ingrad married \"rex sanctus Gerzlef de Ruzzia\" . Morkinskinna names Queen Ingigerdr the daughter of King Óláfr the Swede as wife of King Yaroslav [of] Russia . Her birth date range is estimated based from the birth of her oldest child in 1020, and her youngest known child in [1036]. Snorre records the betrothal of \"Ingegerd the king's daughter\" and \"King Jarisleif from Russia\" . The Historia Norwegie records the marriage of \"sororem Olaui Sueonensis Margaretam\" and \"rex Iarezlafus de Ruscia\" at her brother's instigation, after her betrothal to Olav of Norway was terminated . It is more probable that she was the daughter rather than sister of King Olof if it is correct that she had ten children by her husband. She is referred to as IRINA in Russian sources . The Primary Chronicle records the death of \"the Princess wife of Yaroslav\" 10 Feb [1048/50] . m (1019) as his second wife, IAROSLAV I Vladimirovich Grand Prince of Kiev, son of VLADIMIR Grand Prince of Kiev & his first wife Rognoda of Polotsk ([978]-20 Feb 1054).\n\n2.ANUND JAKOB (-[1052]) . Adam of Bremen names \"filius Iacobus et filia Ingrad\" as the children of \"Olaph rex Sueonum\" and his wife Estred, in a later passage clarifying that the son was \"Anund dictus est Iacobus\" . He succeeded his father in [1022] as ANUND JAKOB King of Sweden. m as her first husband, GUNHILD Svensdatter, daughter of Jarl SVEN Haakonsson & his wife Holmfrid of Sweden (-1060 or after). The primary source which confirms her first marriage has not yet been identified.

Snorre records that Toste had a daughter...proud and high-minded...Sigrid who married \"the Swedish king, Eirik the Victorious, and had a son by him...Olaf\" and, in another saga, that after his first wife died [named Gunhild by Snorre] the Danish king Svein Tjuguskeg married Sigrid the Haughty, a daughter of Skoglartoste, and mother of the Swedish king Olaf noting that by means of this relationship there was great friendship between the kings... . Fagrskinna also names Sigrid, mother of King Olof, as daughter of Skoglar-Tosta . These reports directly contradict all the sources quoted in the document DENMARK KINGS which indicate the Polish princess as the widow of the Swedish king and second wife of Svend (and that she was Storråda/the Haughty). Hlawitschka, as part of his discussion about the wives of Erik King of Sweden and Svend King of Denmark, attempts to resolve the confusion by suggesting that King Svend married firstly the composite person Gunhild, daughter of Skoglar Toste . This possibility cannot be dismissed, but the suggestion, in particular that Svends first wife was named Gunhild, is uncorroborated by primary sources except Snorre. The attempt also does not explain Snorres reference to Skoglar Tostes daughter marrying the Swedish king, by whom she was mother of his successor (which also contradicts other sources). Another possibility is presumably that Sigrid, daughter of Skoglar Toste, married firstly the Swedish king (as his first wife) who repudiated her, and secondly married the Danish king (also as his first wife), in which case the confusion in the sources could be attributed to both Svends wives being named Sigrid.

The reference to \"nepos\" would be consistent with Stenkil having been King Emund's stepson. He succeeded in 1060 as STENKIL King of Sweden. Adam of Bremen records the death of \"in Sueonia rex Stinkel\" and that after this \"duobus Hericis\" fought each other for the kingdom , the passage undated but following the record of the Norman conquest of England in 1066.

He succeeded in 1229 as KNUT King of Sweden. The Icelandic Annals record the death in 1234 of \"Kanutus longus rex\" .] [m firstly ---. This first marriage is suggested to explain the marriage of King Knuts son Holmger to the daughter of Filip Lavransson who married his fathers widow (see below, although the primary source which confirms that she was the mother of Holmgers wife has not been identified) . Sjöström suggests that a sister of rijksjarl Ulf Fase (children of Karl den döve Riksjarl of Sweden, who was killed in battle Oct 1220 at Lihula, western Estonia) was Knuts first wife and mother of Holmger, based on a certain landed inheritance [a share of land at Sko] of Holmger and some heraldic indication on Holmgers tombstone ]. m [secondly] ([1229/30?]) as her first husband, HELENA Pedersdotter, daughter of PEDER Strangesen, drost, high seneschal of Denmark, [de iure uxoris] Lord of Kalundborg castle [Sjaelland] & his wife Ingeborg Esbernsdatter, heiress of Kalundborg. Hakonar Saga names Helenu...dóttur Pétrs Stranga-sonar as möder (mother) of Holmger Knutson (and therefore wife of King Knut) and records her second marriage with Filipus . As noted above under her husbands possible first wife, the chronology suggests that Holmger was born from an earlier marriage of his father. If that is correct, mother in this extract was used in an extended sense. Another issue is that these mentions in the Hakonar Saga only appear in two manuscripts (the Flateyjarbök and the Stockholm manuscript), not in two others (the Codex Frisianus and the Eirspennil manuscript), which in any case may suggest the possibility of a later mistranscription . Helenas mother was the daughter of Esbern Snare, founder of Kalundborg fortress, and his third and last wife Helena Guttormsdotter. The dating of Helenas marriage is suggested by her husband allying himself with a powerful Danish family, in order to challenge Valdemar II King of Denmark who continued to support his nephew Erik \"Läspe/the Lisper\" King of Sweden, deposed as king in 1229 (see below) . She married secondly Filip Lavransson, who was named in the 25 Jul 1282 charter cited below. King Knut & his [first wife] had one child:\n\n(1)HOLMGER Knutson (-beheaded [near] Gästrikland 1248, bur Sko kloster near Enköping, Upland, Sweden ) .

He claimed the throne again in 1247 in the Folkunge Rising, but in 1248 he was defeated at the battle of Sparrsätra (Åsunda district near Enköping) by forces of King Erik XI and Birger jarl, and was captured and beheaded . This rebellion is recorded in Hakonar Saga . Benedictus germanum Svevorum Gothorumque Regis recalled discordia inter...Regem Sveworum et nobiles viros Dominum Hulmgerum et Dominum Philippum, qui quoniam in mortem Principis procerumque eius...fuerunt machinati... and their wives assets forfeited to the crown, in a charter for Skokloster dated 25 Jul 1282 . m ([before 1247]) [his stepsister,] HELENA Filipsdotter i Sko, daughter of FILIP Lavransson & [his wife Helena Pedersdotter] (-after 25 Jul 1282) .
