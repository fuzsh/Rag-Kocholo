        "text": "Alexandra Feodorovna (Russian: Александра Фёдоровна; born 12 Feburary 1932), nee Princess Astrid of Norway, was Empress of Russia as the consort of Emperor Mikhail II from her husband's accession in 1956 until his death on 17 January 2015. The second daughter of Olav V of Norway and Princess Martha of Sweden and an older sister of Harald V, Alexandra gain immense popularity in her adopted country for patronage of many organizations and down to earth personality. She was most notable for founding one of Russia's successful organization for assisting children and adults with dyslexic, as herself has it.\n\nLife[]\n\nPrincess Astrid was born on 12 February 1932 at Villa Solbakken to the future King Olav V and Crown Princess Märtha. She was baptized in the Palace Chapel on 31 March 1932 and her godparents were: her paternal grandparents, King Haakon VII and Queen Maud of Norway; her maternal grandparents, Prince Carl and Princess Ingeborg of Sweden; her maternal aunt, Princess Astrid; Elizabeth, Duchess of York (later Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother); her grandaunt, Princess Thyra of Denmark; her granduncle, Prince Eugen of Sweden; and Prince George of the United Kingdom. Princess Astrid was named after her maternal aunt, paternal grandmother, and maternal grandmother.\n\nPrincess Astrid grew up on the royal estate of Skaugum in Asker and was privately educated during her childhood. During World War II, she joined her family fleeing the Nazis and spent the war with her mother, brother and sister in exile in Washington, DC. Following the royal family's return to Norway she attended Nissen's Girls' School and graduated with the examen artium university entrance exam in 1950. She then studied economics and political history for two years at Oxford University.\n\nThe princess later learnt other skills including dressmaking and cooking and pursued her interests in handicrafts.[citation needed] Princess Astrid studied ceramics with Halvor Sandøs.\n\nPrincess Astrid's mother died on 5 April 1954 from cancer at age 53 when Astrid was 22 years old.[citation needed] From her mother's death until her marriage in January 1956, Princess Astrid was the senior lady of the court and acted as first lady of Norway, working side-by-side with her father on all representation duties, including state visits. Her hobbies include knitting, embroidery, reading and painting porcelain.[citation needed]\n\nIn 2002, the Government granted the Empress an honorary pension in recognition of all her efforts on behalf of Norway both during and following her years as first lady. In 2005, she took part in ceremonies marking the 60th anniversary of the end of World War II, including the unveiling of a plaque marking the Norwegian monarch's exile in London.\n\nIn February 2012, The Empress celebrated her 80th birthday with a private dinner at the Winter Palace In St. Petersburg.\n\nMarriage[]\n\nIn 1952, The Romanovs paid an state visit to Norway for diplomatic relations. Astrid was introduced to Tsarevich Mikhail (later Mikhail II) during this visit. The two were both quite taken with another, spending time walking together in the Royal Gardens and exchanging looks at each other. They met again at the coronation of their cousin, Elizabeth II. Their parents eventually caught on this growing relationship and the two were engaged on July of 1953. The marriage was accepted in both respected countries, as this further solidified Norway and Russia's friendly relations. However, the wedding was called off for a while after the death of Astrid's mother, Martha who died of cancer in 1954.\n\nOn January of 1955, Astrid arrived in St. Petersburg with the companionship of her older sister, Princess Ragnhild after the birthday of Empress Elena. The two were both greeted warmly by the Romanov Imperial Family and the Russian people, who were excited to have a new Tsarevna. Upon Astrid's conversion to Russian Orthodox, she took the name Grand Duchess Alexandra Feodorovna. Although, she faced a bit of backlash as the previous Empress, Alexandra was rather unpopular with the people. Nevertheless, Mikhail defended her choice in name, however in private He'd often called her by her birth name and in public and formal occasions referred to her as Alexandra. The couple were married on January 21, 1955 at the Imperial Chapel of the Winter Palace.\n\nTsarevna[]\n\nDuring her brief tenure as Tsarevna, Alexandra was referred as the \"Tsarevna Alexandra\" or by close friends at the Russian court as \"Sashenka\" to avoid confusion with her grandmother-in law. Alexandra and Mikhail resided at Anichkov Palace, which was previously lived in by Mikhail's parents. Alexandra won the hearts of her new people immediately as Mikhail did for her down to earth and warm personality. Alexandra had a complex relationship with her mother-in-law, Elena Feodorovna who was rather strict with the young woman but eventually warmed up to Alexandra. Alexandra and Emperor Alexei had friendly relationship.\n\nAlexandra, struggled at learning Russian but excelled at learning French, the official Russian court language. Until the early 1960s, Alexandra would often speak to her subjects in French or have it be interpreted. Before becoming Empress, Alexandra often helped the Empress preparing luncheons, formal balls, and state dinners. As well as, attending charity events with her and visiting villages and the countryside of Russia."
