        "text": "The little Albert is only 1 year old when his mother Astrid (photo) dies in a tragic car crash in Küssnacht am Rigi, Switzerland, at only 29 years of age. Her 3 children are raised by different governesses, and later by their stepmother Lilian Baels.\n\nDue to the Second World War; Albert spends a great deal of his youth abroad. In 1951, his elder brother Boudewijn is installed on the throne at only 20 years of age as King Leopold III abdicates in an attempt to restore political stability in Belgium.\n\nIn 1959, Paola is being presented to the Belgian people. At Zaventem Airport, she is welcomed by the Prince of Liège and his father, Leopold III, and of course the Belgian press. \"The kindness and beauty of the blonde princess from the South quickly conquered the Belgian hearts\", the newspapers report.\n\nThe wedding takes place on 2 July 1959 and is followed nationwide. The ceremony is even broadcast on television. The 21-year-old Paola is in tears when she says \"yes\" to Albert.\n\nThey have 3 children: Filip (1960), Astrid (1962) and Laurent (1963). However, their parents are abroad a lot and this affects their bond with the children.\n\nHowever, the couple straightens things out at the beginning of the eighties. There are different versions about who saved the marriage. It is believed that the late King Boudewijn and Cardinal Suenens played a role as mediators. Others claim that their daughter Astrid played a crucial role, bringing their parent back together via the Charismatic Movement.\n\nIn a rare public interview at the occasion of her 70th birthday, Paola briefly raises the subject. \"We had our problems, but now we tell each other that we were made for each other. Now we are really happy.\"\n\nIn 1993, Albert becomes the new King of the Belgians after the sudden death of King Boudewijn. Albert soon adapts to his new role, while Paola needs some time to get used to it.\n\nThe news brings the royal couple once again in the eye of the storm, especially when Albert refuses to recognise Delphine as his daughter. The only time that Albert makes a small reference to the issue, is in his 1999 Christmas address: \"The queen and I have thought of the crisis that we went through, now 30 years ago. This crisis was highlighted recently. We wish not to go into this much deeper, it's part of our private life.\"\n\nAs a person, Albert is quite the opposite of what his elder brother Boudewijn used to be. Whereas the deeply religious Boudewijn used to live an austere life, Albert has a more exuberant lifestyle: \"He's extravert, quick to laugh, careful and intelligent, and he likes a good meal with a glass of wine\", is the cliché.\n\n\"While Boudewijn symbolised the old, aristocratic values, Albert is more a grand-bourgeois type\", an insider claims.\n\nAlbert likes taking a ride on his motorbike. As he gets older, the sun seems to be shining for him again, although he has to undergo open-heart surgery in 2000. However, he recovers well. The bond with Paola seems stronger than ever now the king is in his seventies.\n\nIn May 2013, Delphine starts legal action to get a DNA sample from the members of the royal family to prove that she is indeed Albert's daughter. However, this doesn't persuade King Albert to admit that she is his illegitimate daughter.\n\nHis peace is also disturbed by his youngest son Laurent, who makes some controversial trips to a number of countries like Congo. Laurent is declared persona non grata at the palace, but things are straightened out again."
