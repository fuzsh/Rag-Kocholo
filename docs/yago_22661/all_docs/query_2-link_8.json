Thank you for introducing him to us!\n\nhttp://crossoflaeken.blogspot.com/2009/01/tragedy-of-leopold-iii.html\n\nEvents would put this patriotism to a stern test. At the age of 12, Leopold saw his country overwhelmed by invading German forces during World War I. Leopold and his siblings were sent to safety in Britain. Their parents remained in Belgium, exposed to all the dangers of war. Reduced to a small strip of territory near the North Sea, King Albert, in collaboration with the armies of the Entente, led the Belgian army in trench warfare against the Germans for the next four years. Queen Elisabeth remained at her husband's side, devoting her time to the care of wounded soldiers and Belgian refugees.\n\nLeopold soon insisted on returning to Belgium to take part in the defense of his country. Accordingly, at the age of 13, he became the youngest infantryman in the Belgian army. Throughout the war, the young prince alternated between school at Eton and \"vacations\" with his regiment. His father, King Albert, had instructed the regiment's Colonel: \"Make him dig trenches, so that he may know what it is like to have blistered hands.\" Every morning, therefore, Leopold used to fill fifty sandbags to reinforce the parapets. He also undertook the complete course of training for the infantry recruit - physical exercises, lessons in handling arms and grenade throwing, drill and the maintenance of equipment.\n\nSoon, Leopold, still only 13, insisted on being taken to the front line. By Providence, he survived many dangers. On one occasion, he manned an advance post within pistol range of the enemy. Another time, he was nearly hit by a bombshell, but his companion, a 65-year-old soldier, pushed him out of the way in the nick of time.\n\nAllied victory and the return of peace saw Leopold and his family return to Brussels, in a newly liberated Belgium. The popularity of the Belgian royal family, widely admired at home and abroad for their wartime heroism, knew no bounds.\n\nIn 1926, Leopold married Princess Astrid of Sweden, a beautiful and gracious young woman. Leopold and Astrid were deeply in love. In 1927, they had a daughter, Princess Josephine-Charlotte, and, in 1930, a son, Prince Baudouin. (A third child, Prince Albert, would be born in 1934, after Leopold's accession to the throne). In the year of Baudouin's birth, Astrid, raised as a Lutheran, converted to Catholicism, the faith of her adopted country. She did so, however, without any pressure from the Belgian royal family, out of genuine religious conviction. Leopold found great happiness in his marriage and family life.\n\nMeanwhile, he worked hard at understudying his father, King Albert, and preparing himself for his eventual role as sovereign. He was especially concerned with the plight of the Belgian Congo, irresponsibly exploited. In 1925 and 1933, Leopold undertook extensive tours of the Congo, and, both times, returned with apt criticisms of the colonial regime and suggestions for reform.\n\nIn 1934, while Leopold and Astrid were vacationing in Switzerland, King Albert died tragically in a mountaineering accident in Belgium. Deeply shocked and grieved, Leopold and Astrid returned to Belgium immediately for the King's funeral. Some days afterwards, Leopold swore his accession oath in Brussels, becoming King Leopold III of the Belgians. On this solemn occasion, Leopold declared: \"I give myself entirely to Belgium.\"\n\nHis reign would be characterized by misfortune. In 1935, the year after his father's death, Leopold lost his wife under equally tragic circumstances, in a terrible car accident in Switzerland. Injured himself, and shattered by grief and shock, the King returned to Belgium for his wife's funeral. Against his doctor's orders, he insisted on following Queen Astrid's hearse on foot for four miles. To Astrid's close friend, Anna Sparre, the devastated King confided: \"My life is over.\"\n\nLeopold had lost, not only his beloved wife, but his Queen, his chief support and close collaborator in his royal function. Yet, despite his terrible personal grief, he persevered, alone, devoting his energies to Belgium, during a period of mounting political tension in Europe. Hitler and Stalin were threatening; World War II was fast approaching.\n\nRe: King Leopold III (1901-1983), Queen Astrid (1905-1935) and Princess Lilian (1916-2002)\n\nElena Tue Oct 25, 2011 10:12 pm\n\nRe: King Leopold III (1901-1983), Queen Astrid (1905-1935) and Princess Lilian (1916-2002)\n\nElena Tue Oct 25, 2011 10:22 pm\n\nPrincess Lilian, second wife of King Leopold III.\n\nhttp://crossoflaeken.blogspot.com/2011/01/princess-lilian-loved-and-loving.html\n\nRe: King Leopold III (1901-1983), Queen Astrid (1905-1935) and Princess Lilian (1916-2002)\n\nMata Hari Tue Oct 25, 2011 10:25 pm\n\nI am learning so much about the Belgian royal family!

To an extent, this did occur, both in Switzerland, where she died, and in Belgium:\n\nhttp://crossoflaeken.blogspot.com/2010/08/st-astrid-of-kussnacht.html\n\n\"Central to the pious cult of Astrid's memory, of course, was the scene of the tragic car accident, heavily laden with Catholic symbolism. While the numberless flowers, wreaths and candles deposited there in the aftermath of the tragedy were universal signs of mourning, many of the mourners explicitly portrayed their visit as a pilgrimage. The Feasts of All Saints and All Souls, November 1 and November 2, 1935, saw the peak of this religious activity. Then, in June, 1936, came the solemn, poignant consecration of the Queen's memorial chapel and the \"King's Cross\", marking the place where Astrid died in her husband's arms. Msgr. Colle, chaplain of the Belgian Royal Court, offered Mass in the presence of Belgian war invalids, other Belgian mourners, and Belgian, Swedish and Swiss dignitaries. King Leopold was too overwhelmed with grief to attend, although there were rumors that he visited the site incognito as early as May, 1936.\n\nIn Belgium and Küssnacht, both regions rich in Catholic lore, Astrid's memory became swiftly associated with devotion to Our Lord, Our Lady and the Saints. The Cross, the Crown of Thorns in the memorial chapel, and many accounts of the Queen's death, recalling the Passion of Christ by placing unusual emphasis upon the shedding of Astrid's blood, suggested she was a kind of Martyr-Queen. The immaculate, white stone Cross, and the radiant figure of Astrid, clad in a flowing white robe, in a central, stained-glass window of the shrine, together with the sculpture of the Virgin Mary over the entrance, linked the Queen of the Belgians to the Queen of Heaven. Astrid's image was flanked by that of her father-in-law, Albert I, in military uniform; after Astrid's death, a combined cult of the tragically lost King and Queen sprang up in Belgium.\"\n\nRe: King Leopold III (1901-1983), Queen Astrid (1905-1935) and Princess Lilian (1916-2002)\n\nMata Hari Wed Oct 26, 2011 8:06 am\n\nI find this incredibly moving.

She was a very shy person naturally, so it is remarkable that she was able to form such a spontaneous, direct rapport with her adopted people.\n\nAstrid's childhood friend, Anna Sparre, wrote a wonderful memoir of her friendship with the Queen, Astrid mon amie. In the book, there is a scene of Astrid kissing and comforting a young child, who was weeping and wailing, and later on telling Anna, who had been present: \"You think I wasn't sincere; well, you're wrong. I couldn't help myself, he was so upset, the poor little one.\"\n\nRe: King Leopold III (1901-1983), Queen Astrid (1905-1935) and Princess Lilian (1916-2002)\n\nMay Fri Oct 28, 2011 12:48 am\n\nLilian's Cardiology Foundation:\n\nhttp://crossoflaeken.blogspot.com/2011/07/princess-lilian-cardiology-foundation.html\n\n\"In Le mythe d'Argenteuil (2006), Michel Verwilghen gives a full and detailed account of the development of the Princess Lilian Cardiology Foundation (pp. 309-314). Established in 1958 in Brussels, the institution combined the scientific interests and charitable inclinations of the second wife of King Leopold III. Following the widely publicized, successful surgery of her teenaged son, Prince Alexandre, who had been suffering from a cardiac abnormality then inoperable in Belgium, by Professor E. Gross at the Children's Hospital in Boston, Lilian began to receive appeals from other Belgians for help in obtaining similar care in the United States for their loved ones. Initially on an informal basis, the Princess responded generously to the requests, supplying financial assistance and organizing administrative and moral support for the patients. Her thoughtful and compassionate approach extended through their whole experience; during the transatlantic flight, sufferers were provided with companionship, children were given gifts to raise their spirits. (Little girls received dolls, for instance).\n\nAs the Princess' work expanded, she decided, at the suggestion of Belgian diplomat Joseph Jennen, to form a non-profit organization to perpetuate her enterprise. Accordingly, on December 10, 1958, she created the Fondation Cardiologique Princesse Lilian. The press, all too often brutally abusive of Lilian, had the good grace to give this accomplishment, at least, appreciative treatment; only Le Drapeau Rouge, a Communist, and, not surprisingly, violently anti-monarchist paper, saw fit to sneer at her efforts. At the outset, the headquarters of the Princess' foundation was placed across the street from the Royal Palace of Brussels, at 14 Rue Bréderode. It would later be moved to Ixelles, a suburb of Brussels. A close friend of Leopold and Lilian, Ernest-John Solvay, presided over the organization for the first few years of its existence. After the King, the Princess and their children left Laeken for the country estate of Argenteuil, in 1961, however, Solvay was replaced by Fernand Collin, a financier, jurist and professor at the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven. For a number of years, a former secretary of King Leopold, Charles Everarts de Velp, served as the secretary of Princess Lilian's foundation. The institution's administrative council included eminent Belgian personalities from the worlds of business and politics, such as Camille Gutt, former member of the World War II cabinet of Prime Minister Hubert Pierlot.\"\n\nRe: King Leopold III (1901-1983), Queen Astrid (1905-1935) and Princess Lilian (1916-2002)\n\nElena Fri Oct 28, 2011 8:06 am\n\nI really feel that I am getting to know these great ladies.

One of the most beautiful of my life, hearing the first cry of my first child! You were so pretty, and later, so handsome! But this, you do not like people to tell you, or, at least, not too bluntly. Since then, so many joys, so many sorrows!\n\nRe: King Leopold III (1901-1983), Queen Astrid (1905-1935) and Princess Lilian (1916-2002)\n\nMay Sat Nov 05, 2011 9:38 pm\n\nHere is a post with a link to a recording of a speech by King Leopold, addressed to the USA on October 27, 1939. The speech outlines the reasons for Belgium's policy of independence and neutrality, and emphasizes the role of Belgium in trying to maintain the peace in Europe.\n\nhttp://crossoflaeken.blogspot.com/2011/11/king-leopolds-broadcast.html\n\nRe: King Leopold III (1901-1983), Queen Astrid (1905-1935) and Princess Lilian (1916-2002)\n\nMay Mon Nov 07, 2011 9:57 pm\n\nThe mother of Princess Lilian, Anna Maria de Visscher:\n\nhttp://crossoflaeken.blogspot.com/2010/07/anna-maria-de-visscher-mother-of.html\n\nAnna Maria de Visscher was the scion of respectable bourgeoisie, the daughter of a mayor and the granddaughter of a minister. Her ancestors included illustrious figures, such as the Comte Félix de Muelenaere, a member of the National Congress that founded the Kingdom of Belgium, and three times Foreign Minister between 1831 and 1841. In 1905, Anna Maria married Henri Baels, a rising young Ostende shipowner, lawyer and politician, to whom she bore eight children, six daughters and two sons.\n\nDuring the Nazi invasion of Belgium, while her husband, the Governor of West Flanders, circulated constantly to alleviate the plight of his province, Madame Baels worked for the Red Cross. The young Lilian assisted her mother in her task, transporting wounded French and Belgian soldiers by car to the St. John Hospital in Bruges, simultaneously flooded by refugees. She also helped to evacuate the elderly from the hospice of Alost, which was within the combat zone, exposed to enemy fire.\n\nAs the military situation headed towards disaster, however, Madame Baels decided to leave for France to bring two of her daughters, then ailing, to safety. Lilian drove the family car. At a restaurant in Bernay, near Lisieux, the news of the Belgian capitulation reached the four women. At Paul Reynaud's infamous broadcast, branding the Belgian king a traitor and felon, French and Belgian officers began vilifying Léopold III, tearing apart his photograph on the front cover of a magazine. Horrified, Lilian indignantly rebuked the officers. One spitefully retaliated by seizing the Baels' car key and throwing it into a ditch. After obtaining a replacement, the ladies proceeded to the south of France, renting a villa in Anglet, near Biarritz.\n\nMadame Baels would have many sorrows in the years to come. Her husband and her son were unfairly accused of cowardice and treason, while her daughter Lilian was battered by gossip and slander. According to Lilian's account, as recorded in Un couple dans la tempête (2004), the news of her secret marriage with King Léopold upset and worried her mother, who foresaw that it would provoke a political storm. \"My little one, you don't know what's in store for you. It will be appalling, they will all attack you, you will have a terribly hard life,\" she is quoted as saying (pp. 36-37). Anna Maria Baels, née de Visscher, died of heart failure in 1950, while the question of the King's return from exile was still being decided. On the grounds that her arrival, at such an emotional moment, might sway the people in Léopold's favor, Lilian was prevented from returning to Belgium to bid farewell to her dying mother."
