        "text": "(1901–83). Crowned king of Belgium in 1934, Leopold III reigned when World War II erupted in 1939. His refusal to follow the Belgian government into exile after Germany invaded his country in 1940 aroused Belgian opposition to his rule. His return to the throne in 1950 led to the threat of civil war and eventually forced him to abdicate.\n\nLeopold was born in Brussels, Belgium, on November 3, 1901. He was the elder son of King Albert I. Leopold served as a private soldier during the final campaign of World War I. In 1926 he married Princess Astrid of Sweden, and they had three children: Joséphine-Charlotte, Baudouin, and Albert. Astrid died in an automobile accident in August 1935.\n\nLeopold became king of Belgium following his father’s death in 1934. He favored an independent foreign policy but not strict neutrality. He withdrew Belgium from its defensive alliance with France and from the Pact of Locarno—a peace agreement among Germany, France, Belgium, Italy, and Great Britain—after Germany occupied the Rhineland in 1936. Determined to resist German aggression with help from Britain and France, he sponsored construction of a line of defense facing Germany.\n\nAfter the outbreak of World War II, Leopold assumed supreme command of the Belgian army. In 1940, when the Germans invaded Belgium, he ordered his army to surrender and refused to flee with officials to form a government-in-exile in England. His actions were widely resented in Belgium, and he brought further criticism by his marriage in 1941 to a commoner, who was said to be pro-Nazi. Leopold was held prisoner by the Germans at his palace at Laeken until 1944 and then in Austria until the end of the war, when he went into exile in Switzerland. In a plebiscite held in Belgium on March 12, 1950, a small majority of the Belgians voted in favor of Leopold’s return to the throne. He resumed office on July 22, but protests immediately arose. He delegated his powers to his son Baudouin on August 11, 1950. On July 16, 1951, he abdicated, and the next day his son was crowned King Baudouin I.\n\nLeopold continued to live in Laeken, the traditional home of Belgian kings, until his son’s marriage in 1969. Critics of Leopold felt that his residence in Laeken gave him too much influence over King Baudouin. Leopold died in Brussels on September 25, 1983."
