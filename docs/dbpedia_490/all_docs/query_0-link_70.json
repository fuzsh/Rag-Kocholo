        "text": "THE singing-songwriting duo have been releasing music since 2016, but they've shot to fame in 2023 thanks to their major label debut album.\n\nThe War and Treaty's music mixes all types of different genres, but they're breaking barriers in the country music scene.\n\nWho are the members of The War and Treaty?\n\nThe War and Treaty consists of the husband-and-wife duo Michael Trotter Jr. and Tanya Trotter.\n\nTanya Trotter is an American musician, actress, and author from Washington D.C.\n\nShe grew up singing in choirs at her Baptist church services and while attending Catholic school.\n\nShe was also a choir member at Morgan State University in Baltimore, Maryland, where she majored in psychology.\n\nTanya's first big break was her role as Tanya in Sister Act 2: Back in the Habit.\n\nShe starred as a choir member alongside Whoopi Goldberg, Lauryn Hill, Sheryl Lee Ralph, and Jennifer Love Hewitt.\n\nIn 1994, she released her debut album, Natural Thing, which hit the 58th spot on the US R&B/Hip Hop Albums chart.\n\nIn 1995, Tanya received a nomination for Best New Artist at the Soul Train Awards.\n\nShe signed with Sean Combs' Bad Boy Entertainment in 1996 but was released from her contract in the early 2000s.\n\nBefore starting The War and Treaty in 2014, she was involved in musical theater productions.\n\nHer songs were also featured in hit Hollywood movies, including Tyler Perry's 2008 film The Family That Preys.\n\nMichael Trotter Jr. also began singing long before the duo started, beginning his musical career during a stint in Iraq in 2004.\n\nHe taught himself how to play piano on a confiscated keyboard, and sang songs at memorial services held for fallen soldiers.\n\nMichael won Military Idol, the US Army's version of the hit singing competition, American Idol, during a competition in Germany.\n\nWhen he was discharged from the military, he met Tanya, and the rest was history – musically and romantically.\n\nThe two founded The War and Treaty in Michigan in 2014.\n\nSince then, they've headlined shows and opened for a diverse group of artists, including Al Green, Brandi Carlile, John Legend, and Van Morrison.\n\nIn 2016, they released their duet album, Love Affair, under the name Trotter & Blount.\n\nBy 2017, they released Down to the River, an EP described as a mixture of blues, country, soul, bluegrass, and gospel genres.\n\nIn 2018, their debut album, Healing Tide, garnered critical acclaim, with Rolling Stone comparing the duo's sound to Tina and Ike Turner.\n\nTheir second studio album, Hearts Town, came out in 2020.\n\nIn May 2022, they signed a major label deal with Universal Music Group Nashville.\n\nThe War and Treaty released their major label debut album, Lover's Game, on March 10, 2023.\n\nIn 2023, they also became the first black duo to be nominated for the Country Music Association Award and the Academy of Country Music Award for Duo of the Year.\n\nIn August 2023, their collaboration with country star Zach Bryan, the song Hey Driver, peaked at #14 on the Billboard Hot 100.\n\nThe War and Treaty are also up for two Grammys at the 66th Annual Grammy Awards, scheduled for February 4, 2024.\n\nThey're nominated for Best New Artist, and Best American Roots Song for their hit single, Blank Page.\n\nThe duo may have started as an indie collaborative, but with 5.5 million monthly listeners on Spotify, they've proven they're destined for stardom.\n\nHow long have they been married?\n\nMichael and Tanya have to be on the same page when it comes to their musical collaborations, but the duo aren't aligned when it comes to how they met.\n\nTanya claims the duo met at a festival in Maryland in the early 2010s, where she was volunteering and Michael was performing.\n\nMichael says he noticed Tanya on the big screen in the 90s, in the hit movie Sister Act 2: Back in the Habit.\n\nHe reportedly told his parents \"That's my wife right there.\"\n\nIn an interview with NPR Music, Tanya recalls: \"His personality drew me in initially and then the sparks started to fly.\"\n\nShe added: \"I knew that I was hooked.\"\n\nWithin years, the duo fell in love, but not before \"playing the back-and-forth game of love,\" depicted in their single and album, Lover's Game.\n\nIn a 2022 interview with People, Tanya said: \"We did play all those games.\"\n\n\"Michael actually threw my phone number away. I really had to call around trying to figure out his phone number.\"\n\nThe duo ended up tying the knot in 2014, but it hasn't been smooth sailing ever since.\n\nOn The War and Treaty website, Tanya writes: “When you look at a married couple like Michael and I, people see the happiness and they see us on stage. They see the love.\"\n\nShe adds: “But they don’t understand that we’re just like any other couple. We have our ups and downs.”\n\nDespite their ups and downs, the musical and romantic duo prove they've got the talent, strength, and love to take the music industry by storm.\n\nDo they have any kids?\n\nMichael Trotter Jr. and his wife, Tanya Trotter, don't just blend musical genres – they also have a blended family.\n\nThe couple are parents to four children.\n\nThey have two girls and two boys.\n\nTanya had her first child, a son when she was 19.\n\nHe is now in his late 20s, with a degree in finance, and an affinity for health and fitness.\n\nMichael also has two daughters from a previous marriage.\n\nIn an interview with Black and Married with Kids, Tanya describes Michael as a great dad and partner: \"He’s an incredible father, he’s [also a] loving, patient, sensitive husband.\"\n\nThe duo also share a son, Legend, born in 2011.\n\nTheir son, now a teenager, is also musically inclined, going so far as to give his famous parents some pointers."
