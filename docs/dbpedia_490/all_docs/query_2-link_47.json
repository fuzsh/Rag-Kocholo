        "text": "Getting back on the road has allowed The War & Treaty to deal with unfinished business.\n\n“Hearts Town,” the critically acclaimed third album by award-winning husband-wife Americana duo from Albion, Mich. (now based in Nashville), was released last September, in the midst of the pandemic. Michael Trotter Jr. and Tanya Blount Trotter did what they could in terms of virtual performances, including the Ann Arbor Folk Festival and an episode of PBS’ “Austin City Limits,” but it wasn’t quite the same.\n\nNow, says Michael — who produced “Hearts Town” — “We can say what we couldn’t say before, during the pandemic, in-person and out loud.”\n\n“We’re grateful to be able to get back out there to the fans, getting to see them again and adjust to all the changes we went through last year,” Tanya adds.\n\nThe War and Treaty’s road schedule includes headlining this weekend’s Lake Orion Music Festival as well as upcoming tours with John Legend and Lauren Daigle. it also comes in the wake of the duo’s Academy of Country Music Awards team-up with Dierks Bentley, who they met three years ago, to covering U2’s “Pride (In the Name of Love)” on stage at the Station Inn in Nashville — a moment Michael says was much needed after getting word that Rounder Records, which distributed “Hearts Town,” had stopped actively promoting the project. The duo is also featured on Bentley’s new EP, “Live From Telluride.”\n\n“At that point we were feeling like, ‘Is it worth it?’” he recalls. “We were just heartbroken, like people were giving up on us. But now we realize you’ve got to just get out of yourself and keep doing what you’re here for.\n\n“The goal is to give as much love as we have. We got so much support and respect and love after (the ACMs), other artist reaching out and saying ‘You’re one of us. This is going to lift us up.’ I just want to stay in creating what I love, with my wife. That’s where I am now.”"
