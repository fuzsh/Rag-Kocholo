        "text": "Now that Festival International’s lineup has been announced, it’s time to start planning your schedule. Which bands will you see? What food will you eat? What will you wear?\n\nIt’s necessary to have a game plan.\n\nProgramming Director Lisa Stafford says, “2018 brings a number of bands from countries such as Colombia, Finland, Haiti, Gambia and Mali.”\n\nFestival organizers have hand-picked three groups you don’t want to miss.\n\nMore: What's your treasure worth? Find out and help FIL\n\n“These bands are new and noteworthy to add to your Festival playlist,” she says.\n\nIbibio Sound Machine (Nigeria/London)\n\nLed by London-born Nigerian singer Eno Williams, Ibibio Sound Machine is a blend of African and electronic elements inspired by West-African funk, disco, modern post-punk and electro.\n\nIbibio Sound Machine mixes weird and wonderful folk stories, spoken in Williams’ mother’s native tongue, Ibibio. Think Afro-electro with performances incorporating bright clothing and dancing.\n\nCheck out their self-titled debut album to prepare for the show on Friday, April 27 at Scene Laborde Earles Fais Do Do.\n\n“They will only perform once, so people should really make an effort to see their show,” says Stafford.\n\nWar and Treaty (United States)\n\nThis soulful American band has the most interesting story. As a soldier deployed in Iraq, Michael Trotter Jr. was encamped in one of Saddam Hussein’s private palaces and learned to play on an upright piano that once belonged to the dictator himself.\n\n“I wrote my first song after my captain was killed,” Trotter recalls. “I sang it for his memorial in Iraq.”\n\nSoon after, he began singing at memorial services for other fallen soldiers. He placed first in Military Idol, the army’s version of American Idol and shortly after met Tanya Blount.\n\nBlount is a seasoned performer whose musical influences include Mahalia Jackson, Dolly Parton, Sister Odette and Aretha Franklin. The two were drawn to each other, got married and started making music together.\n\nWar and Treaty blends roots, blues, soul, folk, bluegrass and gospel for a toe-tapping performance. Check out their latest album \"Down the River\" to get a sample of their rich sound.\n\nMydy Rabycad (Czech Republic)\n\nThis group is noted as one of the most productive bands in Czech Republic. This will also be the first time the Czech Republic will be represented on-stage at Festival International.\n\nThe members met at a summer camp when they were 15 years old and have been playing music together ever since. Mydy Rabycad is known to be the leading band of electro swing. However, their latest album combines electronic sounds and extravagant looks — they’ve even termed it “Glamtronic.\"\n\nMydy Rabycad develops their own genre of music with no apologies. Get ready for a colorful, fun-filled performance and check out the latest album, \"M.Y.D.Y.\"\n\nThese three bands have something unique to offer, but don’t stop there. Stafford recommends a few other noteworthy bands, including Making Movies, Amythyst Kiah, and, of course, crowd favorite, Lisa LeBlanc."
