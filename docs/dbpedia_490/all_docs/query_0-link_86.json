        "text": "Do yourself a favor and take a male vocalist who plays the keyboard, a female vocalist who plays the tambourine, a cello player, a mandolin or a guitar player, a little bit of Classical, Soul, Folk, Americana, and Love Filled Revival convicting lyrics. Put it in a blender; turn that blender on high for about 10 seconds to 90 minutes. Pour it into a bottle and label it AWESOME and you will get the sound of The War and Treaty.\n\nIn June of 2013 the husband and wife musical duo of Michael Trotter Jr and Tanya Blount- Trotter became official with a release of some songs they had recorded LIVE at Blue House Studios in Silver Spring, MD. Although the evening was filled with Oohs and Aah from a room filled audience the two walked away feeling like something was missing. After consulting with one another the duo decided to add a third instrument to enhance their already complicated sound. Little did they know that the universe had something totally different in mind, and in 2014 that epiphany would strike forth in the form of a gentle, well- dressed, well- groomed cello player named Thillman Benham who studied at Ithaca College in Ithaca, NY. After meeting Mr. Benham in a café at an Open Mic the three spoke about possibly joining forces to create a more allomorphic style that would promise to be more riveting and chilling then either of them had ever experienced.\n\nWith their first full show being a success performed in front of a packed amped audience at the Hard Rock Café on the Inner Harbor in Baltimore, MD the three decided to make things official and in July of 2015 the once loved duo evolved into a soon to be household wanted trio called The War and Treaty.\n\nThe trio has yet to record professionally however 2016 proves to be a non stop, put your foot on the gas kind of year and at the fact alone the leading lady of the group is kicking up her high heels and twirling her purse on her finger. Tanya says, “I just believe music should be a fun experience and that is what we are having, a whole lot of bold, phosphoric, untapped, and unapologetic fun.”\n\nAside from convicting you with their pure sound and raw musical talent The War and Treaty experience includes one of our world’s greatest yet lost art form; the art form of Story-Telling. Each song is filled with heart throbbing nonstop excitement from the experiences of Michael writing on the banks of the Euphrates River (Baghdad, Iraq) while serving in the 1-6 Infantry Regiment 2nd Brigade 1st Armoured Division of the US Army to keep sane from the perils and dangers of war. Or Tanya sharing stories of witnessing one of the greatest producer/song writers of our time Arif Mardin compose a song just for her. To having tea time with the honorable Julie Andrews, Whoopi Goldberg, and the late James Colburn while filming on the set of the hit movie Sister Act 2: Back In The Habit. You’ll feel compassion as you listen the story of Thillman naming his two cellos, to the trio sharing their most passionate and deepest moments of fear, regret, and triumph. These stories will compel you to want more because you need more. Their approach to every stage is honest and gentle until the beast is unleashed. Some songs include the soul stirring foot stomping revival sound of “Hi Ho”, or they may dazzle their audience with an eerie feeling with their song “Criminal.” Nonetheless to sit in a War and Treaty concert is to sit right in the presence of something you know is going to last for ever or as they would say “Para Siempre.”\n\nWith Countries such as United States of America, Switzerland, Germany, Kuwait, Canada, and the UK on their list of places they have performed in their individual quest the trio are elated at the opportunities that await them world wide. “Music is the best thank you that God could have ever given to humanity, and we intend to return his favor with some thanks of our own.” Michael Trotter Jr."
