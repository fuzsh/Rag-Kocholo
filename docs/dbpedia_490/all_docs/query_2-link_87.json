        "text": "In this 75th Anniversary year of the CBF, the work you are making possible is more important than ever. You continue to make a tremendous impact through your foundation by coming together with your peers throughout our legal community to make it possible for thousands of people in need to get critical legal help and make the legal system more fair, accessible, and equitable for all. Click the link below to see some examples of how you have continued to make a real difference over the past year while building a fairer and better justice system for the future. https://lnkd.in/gbzSQcpG\n\nHopefully this tradition will continue for Owen graduates as they begin their next chapter. Building great teams requires empathy for your teammates. Getting to know and understand each other builds trust. Trust allows for team members to admit vulnerabilities and great teams are formed when we step in to protect our teammates. I worry that much of this has been lost in a work-from-home environment that could lead to viewing teammates as a means to an end where trust is never fully established.\n\nCentral to the R-MA experience is the emphasis on fostering positive personal growth. Every member of our community, including students, faculty, and staff, is bound by an honor code that states, \"As a student of Randolph-Macon Academy, I pledge on my honor not to lie, cheat, or steal, nor tolerate those who do. I will behave in a way that reflects well on myself, my family, and Randolph-Macon Academy.\" This code is more than words; it is a commitment to continuous personal and collective betterment at R-MA. Learn all about our Honor Code by reading one of our latest blog posts: https://hubs.ly/Q02dGjxg0\n\nThe Power of Representation Representation matters. The underrepresentation of Black individuals in leadership roles perpetuates a cycle of non-inclusivity and lack of awareness. A mere 3.2% of executive or senior-level positions are held by Black professionals, a glaring disparity that undermines the effectiveness of diversity and inclusion initiatives. \"Diversity is being invited to the party; inclusion is being asked to dance,\" says VernƒÅ Myers, VP of Inclusion Strategy at Netflix. Organizations must actively elevate Black voices in decision-making roles to dismantle systemic barriers. This includes implementing mentorship programs and leadership development initiatives and ensuring diverse perspectives are present at the table. Dive into our blog post, \"Unmasking the Barriers: The Journey of Black Americans with Disabilities in the Workplace\" Part 2 of 5, https://lnkd.in/g73x_ZYr At Baker Consulting, we understand the complexities of creating accessible and inclusive workplaces. Our READI2B framework is designed to help organizations navigate this journey with empathy, courage, and strategic vision. We work closely with businesses to assess their current practices, identify areas for improvement, and develop comprehensive plans that prioritize the needs of marginalized communities, including Black Americans with disabilities. Reach out to us today to learn how we can support your organization in dismantling barriers and embracing equity. #DiversityEquityInclusion #DEI #EquityForAll #InclusionMatters #Accessibility #Equality #Disabilities #WorkplaceCulture\n\nLast year, the U.S. Department of Education reported that Black educators make up only 9% of the teacher workforce. Of these, a staggering 76% are women. Despite their critical roles, Black women are often left out of key professional development and DEI initiatives that address the unique challenges they face. üìù The Reality: ‚ñ´Ô∏èProfessional development often focuses on Black educators as a whole, educators of color, or Black male educators. ‚ñ´Ô∏èAccording to the \"Black Women Thriving\" survey by Every Level Leadership: * 75% of Black women feel their organizations don‚Äôt fully utilize their skills. * 63% don‚Äôt see a clear career advancement path. * 71% would leave their current job for better pay or promotion opportunities. üîç The Impact: ‚ñ´Ô∏èHigh burnout rates ‚ñ´Ô∏èInadequate support ‚ñ´Ô∏èFear of voicing concerns due to stereotypes like the ‚Äúangry Black woman‚Äù These leads to feeling: ‚ñ´Ô∏èUnderutilized and undervalued ‚ñ´Ô∏èStagnant in their careers ‚ñ´Ô∏èCompelled to shrink themselves for safety ‚ñ´Ô∏èLeft out of professional development and DEI efforts ‚ñ´Ô∏èOverlooked, despite their invaluable contributions At Black Girls Teach, we‚Äôre changing this narrative. Through our BLOSSOM framework, we provide the mentorship and coaching needed to prepare Black women for leadership roles. Our approach fosters self-awareness, reflection, communication, and adult learning strategies that acknowledge our identity as Black women. Our Services: ‚ñ´Ô∏èLeadership Cohort for Rising Leaders: Comprehensive training to cultivate future school leaders. ‚ñ´Ô∏è1:1 Coaching for Current School Leaders: Personalized support to enhance leadership skills and effectiveness. ‚ñ´Ô∏èLeadership Trainings for District Leaders: Strategies to strengthen leadership pipelines and retention, with a focus on Black women educators.

Biggest takeaways - more scrutiny needed of the growing and elaborate ESG ecosystem being built up by corporates - whilst a veil of silence grows on rising attacks on human rights defenders trying to do the daily work of - yes you guessed it - scrutinizing business. Surely a paradox worth unravelling."
