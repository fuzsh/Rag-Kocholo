        "text": "1.1K\n\nFirst African American couple (with her husband Michael) to perform at the American Country Music Awards\n\nSister Act 2 vocalist\n\nTanya Blount Trotter is married to Michael Trotter, Jr. Together they are the musical group, The War and the Treaty. They make impassioned soul music born of traditional folk, country, R&B, and spirituals. They are the most dynamic and versatile married couple performing in music today. And they have an amazing story to tell.\n\nAs The War and the Treaty, Tanya and Michael Trotter and their band perform live, like they did with Dierks Bentley at the 56th Academy of Country Music Awards in April 2021. They cut studio albums, like Love Affair (2016), Healing Tide (2018), and Hearts Town (2020.) Michael and Tanya met in 2010 in Maryland. She heard him performing at an event at which she was a volunteer and “he smashed it. I wanted to work with him,” and they did “but something very unique and strange was happening.” They got closer and closer…until that 4th of July. They were together when fireworks went off and Michael lost complete control. It was then that he confessed that he was a war veteran who had served in the United States Army and was honorably discharged in 2007. He’d had a brutally hard time of it—and Tanya, who had suffered from depression, recognized the signs of PTSD. She called the VA, stopped her life, put her dreams on hold, and with a high level of empathy and true love, got him the counseling and care he needed and stayed with him 24/7. “Love saved my life,” Michael says. “My life’s Love saved my life.” You can hear the love in their music. www.thewarandthetreaty.com"
