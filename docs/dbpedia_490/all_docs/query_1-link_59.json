        "text": "Download ESingle Announcement\n\nThe War And Treaty Release Two Songs from Upcoming Rounder Debut\n\n\"Jealousy\" and \"Hustlin'\" are Available Today\n\nDynamic Husband and Wife Duo to Perform on GRAMMY Telecast\n\nThis Sunday, January 26\n\nJanuary 24, 2020 - Nashville, TN - When it comes to making music with both extraordinary passion and exceptional chops, few acts today can surpass the sheer excellence of The War And Treaty. Newly signed to Rounder Records - and named the 2019 Emerging Act of the Year by Americana Music Association - the husband-and-wife team of Michael Trotter Jr. and Tanya Blount-Trotter deliver a dynamic sound that joyfully blends Southern soul with elements of gospel, country, rock-and-roll, and blues.\n\nToday, The War And Treaty are releasing two tracks from their forthcoming debut album for Rounder. With its spellbinding intensity, \"Jealousy\" unfolds in a masterfully orchestrated sound that merges soaring harmonies and kinetic beats, symphonic strings and scorching guitar work. And on \"Hustlin',\" cascading piano tones and gently lilting rhythms build a beautiful contrast to the song's moody meditation on perseverance and grit. The tracks are available today via all digital service providers.\n\nOn Sunday, January 26, The War And Treaty will perform on the 62nd Annual GRAMMY AwardsÂ®, which airs at 8:00 PM ET/5:00 PM PT on the CBS Television Network. They will join current nominees Jack Antonoff, Camila Cabello, Gary Clark Jr. and John Legend along with Debbie Allen, Joshua Bell, Common, Misty Copeland, Lang Lang, Cyndi Lauper in a tribute to longtime GRAMMY executive producer Ken Ehrlich. They will perform \"I Sing the Body Eelctric\" from the film Fame.\n\n\"We used to sit around the TV watching and dreaming about performing on the GRAMMYs one day,\" marvels Michael Trotter. \"Being part of the Fame tribute with so many incredible artists we've admired for years feels like a fairy tale. Our dreams have come true, and we're so honored to lend our voices to the tribute for Ken Ehrlich, longtime producer of the GRAMMYs and the groundbreaking television series Fame, and to acknowledge the importance of music education.\"\n\nDespite the deep sense of communion that infuses their music, Michael and Tanya hail from wildly different backgrounds. Originally from just outside Washington, D.C., Tanya discovered her supreme vocal skills at a young age and promptly pursued a career in music and acting. Meanwhile, Michael grew up in Cleveland and D.C., spending part of his childhood in homeless shelters and later enlisting in the U.S. Army. While stationed in one of Saddam Hussein's palaces several years after 9/11, he gained access to a piano and quickly captivated his fellow troops with his powerful vocal presence. Soon tasked with writing and performing songs in memoriam to his unit's fallen soldiers, Michael cultivated a distinct songwriting voice that he further developed upon returning home.\n\nAfter he and Tanya shared the stage at a music festival, the two began creating music together, eventually marrying and forming The War And Treaty. Their EP Down to the River arrived in July 2017, and the duo made their full-length debut with Healing Tide - a widely acclaimed effort. The Associated Press called them, \"...a powerhouse R&B duo who sound as though they were born to sing together,\" while Billboard went on to claim that, \"The music world...has definitely shown that it's ready to love The War and Treaty.\"\n\nAlong with completing the follow-up to Healing Tide, The War And Treaty spent much of 2019 touring with the likes of Brandi Carlile and Jason Isbell, as well as joining the legendary Al Green for a run of dates at such iconic venues as Radio City Music Hall.\n\nDownload John Legend Tour Announce\n\nThe War And Treaty Tapped to Open for John Legend on Bigger Love 2020 Tour\n\nPowerhouse Duo Michael Trotter, Jr. and Tanya Blount-Trotter\n\nTo Release New Album Hearts Town August 14, 2020\n\nFebruary 6, 2020 - Nashville, TN - Fresh off a triumphant performance on the 62nd Annual GRAMMY Awards, The War And Treaty -- the husband and wife team of Michael Trotter, Jr. and Tanya Blount-Trotter -- have been invited to open for John Legend on his Bigger Love 2020 tour, announced this morning.\n\nThe tour will kick off on August 12 in Dallas and visit more than 25 cities across North America this summer including New York, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Boston, Dallas, Seattle, Dayton and more before wrapping on September 25 in San Diego.\n\nThe War And Treaty have been in the studio putting the finishing touches on Hearts Town, their debut album for Rounder, slated for release on August 14, 2020. Last month, they released two tracks from the LP: \"Jealousy\" and \"Hustlin',\" which are available via all digital service providers.\n\nThe duo, named the 2019 Emerging Act of the Year by Americana Music Association, earned tremendous acclaim for their full-length debut, 2018's Healing Tide. The Associated Press called them \"a powerhouse R&B duo who sound as though they were born to sing together,\" while the Los Angeles Times praised their \"joyful mix of gospel, soul and Americana best carried through the raw, rafters-reaching power of their voices.\"\n\nAlong with completing their new album, The War And Treaty spent much of 2019 touring with the likes of Brandi Carlile and Jason Isbell, as well as joining the legendary Al Green for a run of dates at such iconic venues as Radio City Music Hall.\n\nThe Bigger Love Tour pre-sale tickets will go on sale February 11-12 from 10:00 am to 10:00 pm local time.

Michael Trotter explains, \"That song's saying, 'if I have five more minutes to love you, it's going to be the best damn five minutes of my life.\"\n\nThe video for \"Five More Minutes\" offers a nuanced take on the song's heartrending but ultimately redemptive origin story. Michael reflects, \"After years of falling in and out of financial and mental depression, I had finally had enough. I was ready to take my own life. But in my darkest moment, where I was ready right then and there to end it all, my wife Tanya asked one last thing of me: 'Just give me five more minutes. Stay with me. Just five more minutes to love you.' And something in her eyes, something in her hands convinced me to give her that five more minutes.\"\n\nHearts Town arrives as the follow-up to 2018's Healing Tide, a widely acclaimed effort that recently saw The War And Treaty named Emerging Act of the Year by Americana Music Association. Mainly recorded at Blackbird Studio and featuring such esteemed musicians as Jason Isbell, Jerry Douglas, and Punch Brothers guitarist Chris Eldridge, Hearts Townwas produced by Michael and co-produced by Tanya and the duo's longtime music director Max Brown. And while the album unfailingly harnesses the thrilling vitality of their live set, each song spotlights The War And Treaty's heart-on-sleeve storytelling and poetic simplicity with greater impact than ever before.\n\nWhen it came time to choose a title for the album, they quickly landed on Hearts Town-the Nashville duo's adoring nickname for their ardently devoted fanbase. \"Hearts Town is a neighborhood strictly made up of people who all share the same kind of heart: hearts that love, hearts that heal, hearts that don't see division,\" says Michael. \"There's all different types of people within that neighborhood, but they're still somehow all working together-which is exactly the kind of town we want to live in.\"\n\nTrue to the unbridled spirit of The War And Treaty, Hearts Town opens on \"Yearning,\" a powerful introduction to the album's narrative of loving without limit. In its tender reflection on life's most urgent questions, Hearts Town turns to the subject of death on the darkly charged but undeniably hopeful \"Beautiful.\" Graced with Tanya's operatic vocal work and a smoldering guitar solo from Jason Isbell, \"Beautiful\" looks back on the final days of Tanya's mother, Judith May Blount, and finding peace in her passing.\n\nAnd though a lighthearted tone is evident on tracks like \"Jubilee,\" Hearts Town achieves a pensive complexity on its title track, partly sparked from Michael's experience as a wounded warrior who served in the Iraqi War..\n\nOn \"Take Me In,\" the final track to Hearts Town, The War And Treaty make an impassioned plea for unity in times of division. \"Right now a lot of people are feeling so deeply engulfed in pain and surrounded by negativity, and sometimes you just need to hear that you're good,\" says Tanya. \"That's the whole idea behind Hearts Town: no one's trying to change what you think or how you talk or anything else about you. You're just fine the way you are.\"\n\nSince forming in 2014, The War And Treaty have amassed a following as eclectic as their sound itself, a bluesy but joyful fusion of Southern soul, gospel, country, and rock-and-roll. Known for a live show nearly revival-like in intensity, the duo endlessly creates an exhilarating exchange of energy with their audience, a dynamic they've brought to the stage in opening for the legendary Al Green and touring with the likes of Brandi Carlile and Jason Isbell.\n\nWith their debut EP Down to the River arriving in 2017, they released Healing Tide in August 2018 and earned immediate critical praise. The following year, The War And Treaty bolstered their reputation as a phenomenal live act by appearing at leading festivals, in addition to inking their deal with Rounder. And at the start of 2020, the duo won over new fans by taking the stage at the 62nd Annual GRAMMY Awards, performing alongside icons like Cyndi Lauper, John Legend, Gary Clark Jr., and Common.\n\nAs their fanbase continues to expand exponentially, The War And Treaty feel more and more inspired by the Hearts Town community and its boundless potential for mutual uplift. \"This is a place where everything that is broken can be fixed,\" says Michael. \"Hearts Town is a place where you can come broken and open, regardless of your past, and find love just like we have.\"\n\nDownload Take Me In\n\nThe War And Treaty Premiere \"Take Me In\" via Garden & Gun\n\nNew Album Hearts Town Set for September 25 Release\n\nTour Dates with John Legend Confirmed for 2021\n\nAugust 14, 2020 - Today, Tanya Blount-Trotter and Michael Trotter Jr. - the musical duo known as The War And Treaty - have released \"Take Me In,\" from their eagerly-anticipated new album Hearts Town, out September 25.\n\n\"Take Me In,\" -- the track which closes Hearts Town -- is a rousing, gospel-tinged, piano-fueled epic that calls for unity amidst times of deep division. Listen to it HERE.\n\nMichael Trotter reflects, \"We were seeing so much anger in the world as we were making this album, so we wanted to give people something that told them, 'Stop looking for the next Dr. King or Malcolm or Mother Teresa and start looking for the first you.\"\n\n\"Right now, a lot of people are feeling so deeply engulfed in pain and surrounded by negativity, and sometimes you just need to hear that you're good,\" adds Tanya.\n\nGarden & Gun shared an exclusive preview of \"Take Me In\" with their readers yesterday. \"Tanya and Michael Trotter have voices that will stop you in your tracks,\" wrote Dacey Orr Sivewright, adding \"This September, the Nashville-based duo will release Hearts Town, an album chock full of the staggering vocal highs and uplifting themes that fans have come to treasure.\"\n\nHearts Town is the follow-up to The War And Treaty's acclaimed 2018 debut Healing Tide. During the past year, the duo maintained a steady touring schedule that included engagements opening for Al Green, Brandi Carlile, and Jason Isbell. They were featured on a multi-artist tribute that aired on the 62nd annual GRAMMY telecast in January, and a few weeks ago, they were among the performers on a star-studded virtual fundraiser for Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden.\n\nThey are confirmed as the opening act on John Legend's upcoming tour (rescheduled from this summer to 2021).

Michael Trotter explains, \"We often come into relationships with our guards up because we have experienced pain from love. And too often when we enter our next relationship, we expect that pain again. But not in this love that I have found with my wife, Tanya.\"\n\nHe continues, \"When our relationship has no hurt and it just plain feels good, we start to question if it's really real because everything that has been real to us has come wrapped in pain. We start imagining a world where it's not too good to be true and that world is Hearts Town... Hearts Town is a place where you can come broken and open, regardless of your past and find love, just like we have.\"\n\nListen to \"Hearts Town\" HERE.\n\nEarlier this week, the duo performed their latest single \"Five More Minutes\" on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert's \"Play at Home\" series. Watch the performance HERE.\n\nHearts Town is the follow-up to The War And Treaty's acclaimed 2018 debut Healing Tide. Rolling Stone's Fall Album Preview notes, \"The Nashville duo's second album promises to be a more nuanced, musically diverse offering than their jubilant Buddy Miller-produced debut, 2018's Healing Tide. Featuring an appearance from Jason Isbell, the new self-produced effort shows off a fuller breadth of husband-and-wife pair Michael Trotter and Tanya Blount Trotter's far-ranging influences.\"\n\nDuring the past year, the duo maintained a steady touring schedule that included engagements opening for Al Green, Brandi Carlile, and Jason Isbell. They were featured on a multi-artist tribute that aired on the 62nd annual GRAMMY telecast in January, and in late July, they were among the performers on a star-studded virtual fundraiser for Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden.\n\nThey are confirmed as the opening act on John Legend's upcoming tour (rescheduled from this summer to 2021).

The duo will be joined by their longtime musical director, guitarist, and co-producer Max Brown. The event, which can be found HERE, will kick off at 12:00 noon Central/1:00 PM Eastern and will stream on the group's Facebook page and YouTube channel.\n\nHearts Town has already inspired tremendous critical praise.\n\nWriting in Rolling Stone, Jonathan Bernstein observed, \"Transforming trauma into catharsis has become the pair's calling card as they've turned into one of Nashville's most thrilling new acts,\" and proclaimed Hearts Town \"the band's huge leap forward of a second album.\"\n\nIn David Chiu's profile of the duo in Newsweek, he wrote, \"Beginning with their 2017 EP Down to the River and their album Healing Tide a year later, The War and Treaty have developed a following for their mix of Americana, gospel, rhythm and blues and pop as well as the duo's powerful singing. That eclectic blend continues on their new record Hearts Town, and so does their message of healing amidst despair.\"\n\nThe Associated Press' Scott Stroud wrote, \"Comparisons are risky here, but you can hear the kind of label-defying versatility found in classic Staples Singers songs and the contemporary work of John Legend. The duo's power emanates from the interchangeable lead singing of two people with glorious voices, elegant when offered up together or apart.\"\n\nNPR Music's Ann Powers and Robin Hilton discussed Hearts Town on All Songs Considered this morning. \"You hear all the wisdom of their experience in this music, and that fierce determination to find joy, and find power, and thrive,\" said Powers. Her co-host Robin Hilton concurred, saying, \"So much of this record just screams 'Hell yeah, life! Life! Hell yeah!' It just celebrates the miracle of being here at all.\"\n\nNo Depression's Andy Crump noted, \"Putting the task of soothing the country's troubled soul on a single album is probably unfair, but Hearts Town, the sophomore album from The War and Treaty, out this Friday, can at least partly shoulder that burden.\"\n\nDacey Orr Sivewright of Garden & Gun summed up the duo's appeal: \"Tanya and Michael Trotter have voices that will stop you in your tracks.\"\n\nThe War And Treaty are confirmed as the opening act on John Legend's upcoming tour (rescheduled from 2020 to 2021).\n\nA full list of dates is below.\n\nThe War And Treaty - 2021 Dates Supporting John Legend\n\n8.11 Grand Prairie, TX - Verizon Theatre\n\n8.12 Sugar Land, TX - Smart Financial Centre\n\n8.14 Nashville, TN - Ascend Amphitheater\n\n8.15 Atlanta, GA - Cadence Bank Amphitheatre at Chastain Park\n\n8.17 Sunrise, FL - BB&T Center\n\n8.18 St. Augustine, FL - St. Augustine Amphitheatre\n\n8.20 Vienna, VA - Wolf Trap Concert Hall\n\n8.21 Atlantic City, NJ - Borgata\n\n8.23 New York City, NY - Radio City Music Hall\n\n8.24 New York City, NY - Radio City Music Hall\n\n8.26 Philadelphia, PA - The Met\n\n8.27 Ledyard, CT - Grand Theater at Foxwoods Resort Casino\n\n8.28 Lenox, MA - Koussevitzky Music Shed at Tanglewood\n\n8.30 Boston, MA - Rockland Trust Band Pavilion\n\n9.1 Toronto, ON - Budweiser Stage\n\n9.2 Sterling Heights, MI - Michigan Lottery Amphitheatre at Freedom Hill\n\n9.4 Huber Heights, OH - Rose Music Center at The Heights\n\n9.5 Highland Park, IL - Ravinia Festival\n\n9.9 Woodinville, WA - Chateau Ste.
