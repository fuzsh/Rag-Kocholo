        "text": "Simple E (born Erica Williams in Oakland, California) was a female rapper from the 90’s. In 1994, she released her only album, “Colourz Uv Sound” which peaked at #88 on Billboard’s R&B Albums chart.\n\nHer first single, “Play My Funk” peaked at #72 on the Billboard Hot 100, #14 on Billboard’s Hot Rap Singles chart, #21 on Billboard’s Hot Dance Music\\Maxi-Singles Sales chart, and #55 on Billboard’s Hot R&B Singles chart in April of 1994, staying on the chart for 14 weeks. The song was featured in the Wesley Snipes movie, “Sugar Hill.”\n\nThe follow-up single, “Blue Jeans” failed to make any impact on the charts and after that, it seemed as if Simple E has faded into obscurity.\n\nTo see the music video for “Play My Funk,” go to:\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSgIb4-qafo\n\nTo see the music video for “Blue Jeans,” go to:\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NegfUXggpI0\n\n[updated on 08-17-12]\n\nRate this:\n\nSolid HarmoniE were a British pop girl group that originally included members Rebecca “Beki” Onslow (born on January 3, 1975 in Swansea, Wales), Melissa Graham (born on October 10, 1975 in Coventry, England), and Mariama Goodman (born on December 25, 1977 in Lambeth, London).\n\nIn 1996, the group released their first single, “Got 2 Have Ya” which failed to chart at all. In 1997, Mariama left Solid HarmoniE to care for her mother and she was replaced by Elisa Cariera (born on June 16, 1978 in Orlando, Florida).\n\nWhen Rebecca and Melissa were in the United States with their manager, they met Elisa at her father’s restaurant. Elisa was asked to sing a few lines and after that, Melissa asked Elisa to join the group. As they returned to the UK, Mariama came back to Solid HarmoniE and the group became a quartet.\n\nIn 1997, Solid HarmoniE released their self-titled debut album which charted in the Netherlands, Sweden, Finland, and Norway, but surprisingly, not the United Kingdom. In the United States, they were the opening acts for boy bands Backstreet Boys and N’Sync.\n\nSolid HarmoniE’s second single, “I’ll Be There For You” peaked at #18 on the UK Singles chart, #9 in the Netherlands & Sweden, and #10 in Finland.

The song charted moderately well in the Netherlands, Switzerland, Sweden, Norway, and Finland.\n\nThe fourth single from the album, “I Wanna Love You” peaked at #20 on the UK Singles chart. It also charted moderately well in the Netherlands and Sweden.\n\nSolid HarmoniE’s last single, “To Love Once Again” peaked at #55 on the UK Singles chart and #46 in the Netherlands. In 1999, the group disbanded. Melissa went on to do a solo music career while Mariama joined the British R&B group, Honeyz.\n\nElisa and Rebecca continued with Solid HarmoniE and introduced new member, Jenilca Giusti (born on August 21, 1981 in Bayamón, Puerto Rico) in 2000. They were working on a new album, but unfortunately, it was never released. By 2003, Solid HarmoniE was no more.\n\nRebecca released her only solo single, “Wake Up” in 2002. Today, she has moved to the United States, is married, and has a child. She is working on becoming a solo artist in America.\n\nIn 2000, Melissa started her own solo career and released two singles, “Bulletproof” (which peaked at #89 in Germany) and a cover version of Belle Perez’s “Hello World.” She was working on her solo album that was supposed to be released in 2003, but it never happened. Melissa left her music career to care for her ailing father. Today, Melissa is now works as a songwriter.\n\nMariama stayed with Honeyz until 2000, but came back in 2006 until the group’s split in 2009. Elisa Cariera was working on a solo album, but it has yet to be released.\n\nJenilica participated in the Puerto Rico talent singing contest, “Objetivo Fama” where she finished in 5th place in 2006. She has continued to appear in plays and in 2007, she released her self-titled debut album. Jenilica is working her next album which has yet to be released.\n\nIn 2013, Solid HarmoniE announced that they were working on a comeback with the line-up consisting of Elisa Cariera, Beki Onslow and Melissa Graham. They started recording and doing photoshoots in March. Mariama Goodman (who was one of the original members of the group) will not be joining the new line-up due to her involvement with R&B band Honeyz.\n\nTo see Solid HarmoniE’s official Facebook page, go to:\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/Solidharmonie2013Official\n\nTo follow Solid HarmoniE on Twitter, go to:\n\nhttps://twitter.com/SolidHarmoniE1\n\nTo see a video for “I’ll Be There For You,” go to:\n\nTo see a video for “I Want You to Want Me,” go to:\n\nTo see a video for “I Wanna Love You,” go to:\n\nTo see a video for “To Love Once Again,” go to:\n\nTo see a video for “Got 2 Have Ya,” go to:\n\nRate this:\n\nTanya Blount (born on September 25, 1977 in Washington, DC) is an R&B singer, actress and author.\n\nShe attended Morgan State University where she got a a major in psychology and was a member of the university choir.
