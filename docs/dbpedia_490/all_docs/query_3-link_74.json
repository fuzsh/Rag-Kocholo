The project aims to use the Tang collection to support academic research, build broader and more diverse museum audiences, commission fresh interpretations of artwork to enhance scholarship, and strengthen an appreciation of, and facility for, humanistic inquiry. The project is supported by a grant from The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation."
