        "text": "Music had been part of both their lives before they met. Michael, who grew up in a homeless shelter, served two tours in Iraq, where he began writing tributes to fellow service members who lost their lives in the line of duty. He first learned to play the piano when he found one in the basement of a palace that had belonged to Saddam Hussein. Tanya Blount was featured in “Sister Act 2,″ in which she dueted with Lauryn Hill and had released a well-received album before being signed to Sean “Puffy” Combs’s Bad Boy label, but her career had stalled out.\n\nAfter releasing a contemporary gospel and R&B album as Trotter & Blount, the pair began to explore other musical avenues. “I didn’t even know that Americana even existed,” says Tanya over a Zoom call the day after the duo appeared on the Macy’s 4th of July Fireworks broadcast.\n\nShe says their plan paid particularly close attention to three groups: The Carolina Chocolate Drops, who explored country music’s Black roots; the Lone Bellow, whose energy Tanya compares to that found in a gospel revival service; and the Civil Wars, another male/female duo, who Tanya says created “an intimacy with their voices — hearing it was like floating on water. And when they did go apart to sing different notes, even when they weren’t looking at each other, they would sound as one.”\n\nThe Trotters initially spent six hours a day practicing that kind of vocal intimacy. And their lyrics are equally intimate. One of their songs, “Five More Minutes,” was born in a moment when Michael, whose military service left him with post-traumatic stress disorder, was considering suicide, and Tanya begged him for five more minutes until help could arrive.\n\nBesides touring with country superstar Bryan, The War and Treaty appear on his song “Hey Driver,” a nostalgic look at Southern life. The two acts first met when they were part of Willie Nelson’s Outlaw Music Festival. After another meeting at an awards show, Bryan texted the outline of the song to the Trotters and asked them to send a voice memo of the chorus. Bryan posted it on social media not realizing that The War & Treaty had their own record deal. “We were like ‘You’ve got to take that down bro,’” laughs Michael. An authorized studio recording featuring the Trotters’s vocals and Michael’s piano playing was quickly made and has gone platinum.\n\nEven with that kind of connection to the headliner, The War and Treaty know that being the opening act at a stadium show poses its own set of challenges.\n\n“It’s still frightening,” says Michael. “The reality is they’re not there for you. They don’t know you. But you have an opportunity to introduce yourself, and to let them know that they’re there for something they didn’t even know they were there for, so what happens is we create our own reality and take that stage like it’s ours — because it is, for 45 minutes.”\n\nDespite being part of major country award shows and tours, The War and Treaty have shown no indication they’ll be sacrificing their rootsy sound to get country radio airplay. A single released last month, “I Called You By Your Name,” has lyrics that include references to the Old Testament, a frantically strummed banjo, and a plunged trumpet evoking early New Orleans jazz and gospel shout bands.\n\nMichael, who bemoans how much of modern country seems to be made for those who “don’t want to think,” says the song, which describes finding hope during life’s darkest moments, “is for the country music fan who misses the old school days where you love the story lines and you love the songs and the message.” As for the music, he says “There’s a history lesson in that song that has been omitted from the historical books of our country, and that’s that there’s this thin line between bluegrass music and shout music in a Black gospel church.”\n\nThe Trotters are keenly aware that they’re purveying a sound of unity and hope in a time when society is divided and many are struggling. “We’ve always stood in the place of love, and it’s not always easy to stand in that position,” says Tanya. “But people need to know that love is the only emotion that will sustain itself in the long term.”\n\nTHE WAR AND TREATY\n\nOpening for Zach Bryan at Gillette Stadium, Foxborough, Wednesday, July 17, at 7 p.m."
