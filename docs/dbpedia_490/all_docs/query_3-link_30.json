        "text": "When the Civil War ended, America could turn outward again. The islands in the Pacific dotting the path to China were alluring. As were the raw materials in the Caribbean and South American countries only recently freed from Spanish colonization. So while men in government devised plans to conquer these places, white women were instrumental in the implementation and efficacy of American imperialism. On the receiving end, women were both victims and resistors of American imperialism. To understand more deeply, this episode will explore and contrast the experiences of women in Hawaii and the Philippines. Both nations were annexed, one peacefully, the other violently. As always, when we discuss armed conflict, sexual violence against women is present, so trigger warning for discussion of rape and sexual assault.\n\nAmerican imperialism in the Americas and Pacific goes back before the Civil War. In the 1820s and 30s missionaries traveled to distant places to uplift and Christianize the indigenous people that lived there. Their goal was to convert these “heathens'' and help them embrace a Western, Christian lifestyle. People believed that male missionaries, traveling without a wife, would be unable to resist the exotic women they encountered abroad, so married men were preferred. These ceremonies were often rushed with husband and wife knowing very little about one another before being shipped to some remote location. Sybil Moseley Bingham married her husband after only knowing him a couple of weeks. They sailed to Hawaii 12 days after they were married! Bingham wrote in her journal, \"I believe God appoints my work… and it is enough for me to see that I do it all with an eye to his glory.\" What’s important here is that white women were seen as essential to the success of the mission because they would civilize the men. They were also complicit in religious imperialism, not just bystanders. ​\n\nHistory.com\n\nShe and other royal family members fled Kamehameha’s attack. Her grandmother, Kalola fell sick as they fled and they stopped to rest, but the two women and their entourage were taken captive. Kalola was forced to offer her granddaughter as a future bride to Kamehameha in order to secure peace. Maui came under the rule of a unified Hawaii and 11-year old Keōpuolani awaited marriage to her mom’s half-brother.\n\n​Keōpuolani & Ka’ahumanu:\n\nThat said, Keōpuolani became the highest ranking wife of Kamehameha when they married five years later, giving her immense power over the newly unified islands. She gave birth to at least 11 children, but only 3 survived to adulthood and two went on to be kings. Her children were considered sacred, so sacred Kemehameha would lie on his back and place them on his chest as a sign of their superiority to him. In Hawaiian tradition, her children were taken away to be educated by others. But Keōpuolani broke this tradition with her daughter, Nāhienaena. She was not a very politically involved woman and deferred to Kamehameha’s favorite wife Kaʻahumanu.\n\nOn the islands, Kaʻahumanu had become regent to Keōpuolani’s son after Kamehameha died. Their roles were essentially King and Prime Minister. In the aftermath of Kamehameha’s death, she was instrumental in putting down a rebellion from the island Kauaʻi by capturing the island's leader and forcing him to marry her. When he died, she captured his son and made him marry her too. The kingdom secured, Ka'ahumanu went about a plan to modernize and solidify her influence. ​\n\nThey set to work building New England-style frame houses, which looked odd on the beaches of Hawaii, and a church. They helped the Hawaiians craft a written language and created a reading primer in Hawaiian. To aid in their mission, they translated the Bible and preached Christian ideas.\n\n​​The Hawaiians had little interest in what the missionaries found important. Hawaiians were hunters and foragers, the New Englanders were farmers. Hawaiians wore very little clothing, still the New Englanders taught them to sew. But since traditional Hawaiian religion was already declining, this was a way the missionaries could build connections.\n\nSketch of the King and Queen at the Theater in London, Public Domain\n\nA rather racist portrayal of the King and Queen's visit to Britain, Public Domain\n\nAmerican Missionaries:\n\nKa’ahumanu stayed on as regent of Kamehameha II, further cementing her power and influence. In 1830, she banned the Hula and as part of her path toward Christinizing and westernizing Hawaii. The Hula was and is a sensual mimetic religious dance performed before the king to honor the gods or praise the chief. It was a symbol of polytheism in a rapidly Christianizing Hawaii. She and the king negotiated treaties with the encroaching American businessmen who had sugar and pineapple plantations on the island, granting them free trade on the islands and the opportunity to represent themselves in Hawaiian courts– a dangerous move.\n\nThe Americans and the missionaries thought little of the Hawaiian people. Maria Loomis wrote in 1820: “Indolence may be considered as a native characteristic. Little to excite them to action they spend many precious hours in sleep. Their women do no work of any consequence, they think it rather a disgrace.” Her condemnation of the “lazy Hawaiians” reveals how little she understood their culture.\n\nMary Chapin, wrote in 1832: \"Is this that land of heathenish darkness, where gods which their own hands had made usurped this way—where the true God was not known? Is Jesus formed and living here?\" She was obviously discouraged and frustrated at this clash of cultures. But, two months later, she gradually admitted \"Although much enlightened, still they are ignorant people, and need much instruction.”\n\n“A Missionary Preaching to the Natives under a Screen of platted Cocoa-nut leaves at Kairua” drawing by William Ellis, 1823\n\nHula, Public Domain\n\nThere was clearly a difference between the desires of the elites in Hawaii and the average Hawaiians. The throne passed between Hawaiian monarchs several times, the traditional monarchy was replaced by a constitutional monarchy, relations with Americans became tense, and the throne finally landed on Hawaii’s first and only female monarch: Queen Liliuokalani. ​\n\nLili'uokalani was bold as heck and drafted a new constitution to restore native rights and powers. In response, an executive committee that was tasked with deciding whether Hawaii should become part of the US, a process called “Annexation” brought in the big guns, literally. Marines off the warship USS Boston surrounded the Queens palace and placed her under house arrest in a bloodless coup in 1893. While there she spent her days looking out upon her kingdom and sewing a vast quilt that told her story. She later wrote an autobiography about that experience. She said, “That first night of my imprisonment was the longest night I have ever passed in my life; it seemed as though the dawn of day would never come. I found in my bag a small Book of Common Prayer… It was a great comfort to me.\"\n\nQueen Liluokalani's quilt, Wikimedia Commons\n\nIolani Palace, Public Domain\n\nLibrary of Congress\n\nNow this was an interesting event even from a US perspective. This coup was performed without express permission from the US State Department. Within the US, annexation of new lands was hotly debated. Americans supported missionary work and expansion of US power, but deeply embedded racism led many to fear the inclusion of so many indigenous people. Despite this, American President Benjamin Harrison signed the treaty, but before the Senate could approve it, Grover Cleveland replaced him as president and withdrew the treaty. Cleveland was anti-imperialism and demanded an investigation into US actions in Hawaii. They found that Americans were in the wrong and ordered them to lower the US flag from Hawaiian buildings, and restore Queen Liliuokalani to power. But the new Hawaiian president, Sanford Dole, the descendent of missionaries and owner of a large pineapple plantation, refused arguing the US had no right to meddle in Hawaiian affairs. The Provisional Government proclaimed Hawaii a republic in 1894, later recognized by the United States.\n\nQueen Liliuokalani wrote of this experience: “a paper was handed to me… which, on examination, proved to be a purported act of abdication for me to sign. It had been drawn out for the men in power by their own lawyer… For myself, I would have chosen death rather than to have signed it; but it was represented to me that by my signing this paper all the persons who had been arrested, all my people now in trouble by reason of their love and loyalty towards me, would be immediately released. Think of my position, – sick, a lone woman in prison, scarcely knowing who was my friend, or who listened to my words only to betray me, without legal advice or friendly counsel, and the stream of blood ready to flow unless it was stayed by my pen.\"\n\nUS imperialism in Hawaii was bloodless. It involved the work of countless women teaching reading and writing, spreading faith and integrating themselves and their families into Hawaiian lands, businesses, and culture. The effect was the same: indigenous people were stripped of their autonomy over their own lands. It is the only case in this period of US imperialism where the US overthrew a recognized and legitimate constitutional monarchy.\n\nKingdom of Hawaii History, Public Domain\n\nBut not all American women held these notions of Filipino inferiority. Helen Calista Wilson, wrote about the horrors she observed in A Massachusettes Woman in the Philippines. She described a merciless American teacher whipping an indigenous Filipino boy for not attending schoolShe said, “The little fellow shrieked with the pain, and the other children, thoroughly frightened, stopped their ears, shut their eyes, and wept with him.” One can assume this was a pattern of behavior in such racially charged climates.​\n\nPhilippine-American War:\n\nAfter the defeat of Spain in 1898, the US bought the Philippines from Spain at the treaty meeting in Paris and annexed Puerto Rico and Guam. Instead of independence, the Philippines became an American territory, or colony, transferring one colonizer for another– in a very undemocratic process. For the Filipinos who fought alongside the Americans in that war, this was a betrayal. Aguinaldo had received advanced notice of the treaty and resumed fighting. A guerilla war ensued for the next 17 years. Filipino women and their families were both caught in the conflict and active participants in it.\n\nIn 1899, Rudyard Kipling looked back on four centuries of British imperialism and encouraged the rising American empire to do the same. He wrote:\n\n​\n\n“Take up the White Man’s burden--\n\nSend forth the best ye breed--\n\nGo send your sons to exile\n\nTo serve your captives' need”\n\nHis use of masculine terms ignored the fact that white women joined the “sons” in “exile.” In exile, or robust, often Christian, cities, Filipino women lived among the invaders and refused to submit.\n\nFilipino women were caught between competing Filipino and American definitions of masculinity. They were active agents in their society serving in the public sphere as shopkeepers, saloon operators, and in brothels. At the forefront of many economic transactions with American service men and formed a sort of active resistance against them. When servicemen cheated them out of money, they raised prices. Americans remarked that women operated most of the businesses, but his observation is hard to take at face value because emasculating foreign men by saying their wives did everything was also a tool of imperialists.​\n\n\"He Can't Let Her Go,\" Library of Congress\n\nA cartoonist in the Philippines captured this perfectly with a quip about Filipino male laziness. Portraying two women doing all the work while the men sit in the background, he wrote, “Why make a fuss about the ‘White Man’s Burden’? The native girls did not.” Clearly gender norms differed within these societies and Filipino women were caught in the middle.\n\n​\n\nAs often happens in war zones, Filipino and American women earned money as prostitutes. Sexually transmitted diseases were rampant in both the American and Filipino forces, so instead of finding alternative sources of income for these women, they decided to subject the Filipino women, not men or white women to demeaning inspections. Filipino women of course resisted by forging documents, hiding among civilians, and disappearing when inspectors came by.\n\nPhilippine-American War, Wikimedia Commons\n\nWomen's Resistance:\n\nFilipino women resisted US occupation of the Philippines militarily as well. Some estimates suggest that one in ten guerilla insurgents was a woman. American men, heavily influenced by traditional gender norms, did not suspect the active resistance of Filipino women who helped move weapons, funnel escapees, and undermine US control on the islands. American officials concealed women’s involvement by insisting the continued resistance was due to a few male leaders, not a general resistance from an outraged population sick of colonial rule.\n\nLiving in a war zone was chaos, though, and rarely do women as a group fare well. There were reports of individual men seizing and holding Filipino women as personal sex slaves. Caught in a time and place where usual law and order protections were abandoned for military strategy, these women experienced unimaginable horror. Women were often spotted carrying weapons through the countryside where most of the fighting occurred, this was more likely for personal protection than for the overall military strategy. One woman who was not able to defend herself was stabbed 13 times by fellow Filipinos who had aligned with the US.\n\nFor American soldiers, the conflict was complicated. Caught up in the prevailing racism many contributed to the horrors while others were repulsed by it. For Black soldiers, the war was complicated because they were fighting an enemy with dark skin degraded by white men with similar words. One soldier wrote home to his parents about the plight of civilians: “The town… was surrendered to us a few days ago, and the two companies to occupy the same. Last night one of our boys was found shot and his stomach cut open. Immediately orders were received from General Wheaton to burn the town and kill every native in sight; which was done to a finish. About 1,000 men, women and children were reported killed. I am probably growing hard-hearted, for I am in my glory when I can sight my own gun on some dark skin and pull the trigger.\"\n\n\"Over our blood and our dead bodies\": In 1899, Filipino women crafted a poem of resistance that was widely published. They said:\n\n​\n\n“When, when at every house they enter,\n\nShould they violate every woman they capture?\n\nThese are the acts of brutality in war.\n\nThis is the height of cruelty in battle.\n\nLet us fight for our independence\n\nAnd struggle, till the last fighter breathes\n\nNever again should we let anyone conquer us\n\nOver our blood and over our dead bodies.”\n\nTheir position was clear. Their struggle was one of personal defense as well as Philippine nationalism and they were not backing down. Women in rural areas faced unimaginable dangers as scorched earth tactics were used to route out Filipino insurgents. Entire villages were burned to the ground and survivors were forced into occupied territories as refugees.\n\nAginaldo’s wife, Hilaria del Rosario, was the head of the Philippines Red Cross during the war and also held extreme nationalistic perspectives. She wrote: “We must, therefore, think of the best means to defend our Philippine country, even by treacherously, killing them, one by one which, in the long run, will exterminate them, since we are short of arms, and have sufficient rights. Although we are women, we can aid you.” Women helped the resistance by hiding supplies and weapons in their homes. One woman who’s home was in sight of the American base was arrested, although she resisted in an epic brawl, and became one of only two women actually discovered for espionage work. Another mistress helped funnel funds from the city to the guerillas fighting outside. Although a trial took place, Americans were reluctant to try the woman, who had clearly been the instigator in this case. Women across the Philippines continued to resist colonization through the end of the war using strategic military tactics not taken seriously by the Americans.\n\nThe situation in the Philippines calmed after Emilio Aguinado was taken captive by the US. The US remained in control of the Philippines until it lost the islands at the outset of WWII. The Japanese attacks on both Hawaii and the Philippines taught the indigenous populations a bitter lesson in the limits of US protections. Aguinaldo embraced the Japanese, whom he imagined would finally give the Philippines their independence. After the war, the new, independent, Philippine republic rejected him as their future president.\n\nLibrary of Congress"
