        "text": "American music duo\n\nThe War and Treaty are an American husband and wife duo consisting of singer-songwriters Michael Trotter Jr. and Tanya Trotter.[1][2] Their debut studio album Healing Tide (2018), received critical acclaim upon its release. Soon afterwards, they released their sophomore album Hearts Town (2020), which featured a collaboration with American singer Emmylou Harris, and spawned the Triple A top 40 hit single \"Five More Minutes\".[3] In 2022, they signed to UMG Nashville, and released their major label debut Lover's Game (2023). Their collaboration with Zach Bryan on the song \"Hey Driver\" reached the top 20 on the Billboard Hot 100.\n\nIn 2023, The War and Treaty became the first black duo to be nominated for the Country Music Association Award for Duo of the Year;[4] along with being the first black duo to be nominated for the Academy of Country Music Award for Duo of the Year.[5] They have received two nominations for the 66th Annual Grammy Awards, including Best New Artist. An upcoming biopic based on the group’s life is set to be released.[6][7]\n\nCareer\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 2016, Michael Trotter Jr. and Tanya Blount released the duet album Love Affair as Trotter & Blount.[8] In 2017, The War and Treaty released the EP Down to the River, described as a mix of 'blues, gospel, soul, bluegrass, country' and heralded by Estey as 'a splendidly made immediate classic about conflict and redemption'.[9][10] Yet the two can sensually help heal the wounds from those confessional blasts with a sweet ballad like \"Till The Mornin’\" — they truly live up to the dynamic tension of their moniker.'[10]\n\nIn 2018, Rolling Stone reported The War and Treaty's debut album Healing Tide is due for release on August 10, 2018, describing the lead single as a 'joyfully relentless title track, reminiscent of classic Ike and Tina Turner rock-infused soul'.[11]\n\nOn September 25, 2020, The War and Treaty released their sophomore studio album, Hearts Town, on Rounder Records. On April 18, 2021 they joined Dierks Bentley for a performance of U2's \"Pride (In the Name of Love)\" for the 56th Academy of Country Music Awards.[12]\n\nThe group signed a major label deal with Universal Music Group Nashville in May 2022.[13] They performed a cover of \"It's Only Rock 'n Roll (But I Like It)\" alongside Brothers Osborne at the 56th Annual Country Music Association Awards on November 9, 2022 and surprise-released their second EP Blank Page on the same day.[14] Their major label debut album Lover's Game, was released on March 10, 2023.\n\nThe duo collaborated with American country star Zach Bryan on the track \"Hey Driver\" from his self-titled fourth studio album. The song debuted at number 14 on the Billboard Hot 100 marking the duo's first appearance on the chart.[15]\n\nDiscography\n\n[edit]\n\nStudio albums\n\n[edit]\n\nList of albums, with selected chart positions Title Album details[16][17] Peak chart positions US\n\nCurr.\n\nSales\n\n[18] US\n\nHeat.\n\n[19] US\n\nIndie\n\n[20] Love Affair[21]\n\n(as Trotter & Blount)\n\nReleased: March 4, 2016\n\nLabel: Seven49Group\n\nFormat: CD, Digital download\n\n– – – Healing Tide[22]\n\nReleased: August 10, 2018\n\nLabel: Strong World Entertainment (marketed and distributed by Thirty Tigers)\n\nFormat: LP, CD, Digital download[23]\n\n– 11 26 Hearts Town[24]\n\nReleased: September 25, 2020\n\nLabel: The War and Treaty Corporation\n\n(under exclusive license to Rounder Records and distributed by Concord Music Group)\n\nFormat: LP, CD, Digital download[25]\n\n70 – – Lover's Game\n\nReleased: March 10, 2023\n\nLabel: UMG Nashville\n\nFormat: LP, CD, Digital download\n\n56 – –\n\nEPs\n\n[edit]\n\nList of EPs Title Album details Down to the River[26]\n\nReleased: October 19, 2017\n\nLabel: Strong World Entertainment\n\nFormat: Digital download\n\nBlank Page[27]\n\nReleased: November 9, 2022\n\nLabel: Universal Music Group Nashville\n\nFormat: Digital download\n\nSingles\n\n[edit]\n\nAs a lead artist\n\n[edit]\n\nList of singles with selected chart positions, sales figures and certifications Title[17] Year Chart positions Album US\n\nTriple A\n\n[28] \"Hi Ho\"[29] 2016 — Down to the River \"Healing Tide\"[30][11] 2018 — Healing Tide \"Are You Ready to Love Me?\"[31] — \"Jealousy / Hustlin'\"[32] 2020 — Hearts Town \"We Are One\"[33][34] — Charity single \"Five More Minutes\"[35] 22 Hearts Town \"Everything New (Sessions)\"\n\n(with John Mark McMillan) [36] 2021 — Non-album single \"That's How Love Is Made\"[37] 2022 — Lover's Game \"Lover's Game\"[38] — \"A Sunday Kind of Love\"[39] 2023 — TBA \"Stretch Out\"[40] — \"Cold\"\n\n(Live from The Academy of Country Music Honors) [41] — Non-album single \"Called You By Your Name\" 2024 — TBA\n\nAs a featured artist\n\n[edit]\n\nList of singles with selected chart positions, sales figures and certifications Title[17] Year Chart positions Album US\n\nTriple A\n\n[28] \"America the Beautiful\"\n\n(Kristin Wilkinson and Matt Rollings featuring Trisha Yearwood, Keb' Mo', Amy Grant & The War and Treaty)[42] 2021 — Non-album singles \"The Times They Are a-Changin'\"\n\n(Nitty Gritty Dirt Band featuring Rosanne Cash, Steve Earle, Jason Isbell & The War and Treaty)[43] — \"Chuck-will's-widow\" (Video Mix)\n\n(Amy Ray featuring The War and Treaty & Michelle Malone)[44] —\n\nOther charted songs\n\n[edit]\n\nList of singles with selected chart positions, sales figures and certifications Title[17] Year Peak chart positions Certifications Album US\n\n[45] AUS\n\n[46] CAN\n\n[47] IRE\n\n[48] WW\n\n[49] \"Hey Driver\"[50]\n\n(Zach Bryan featuring The War and Treaty) 2023 14 —[A] 14 29 33\n\nRIAA: Platinum[51]\n\nARIA: Platinum[52]\n\nZach Bryan\n\nGuest appearances\n\n[edit]\n\nList of non-single guest appearances, with other performing artists, showing year released and album name Title Year Other artist(s) Album Ref. \"It's Only Rock 'n Roll (But I Like It)\" 2023 Brothers Osborne Stoned Cold Country [53] \"Hey Driver\" Zach Bryan Zach Bryan [50] \"From a Distance\" — More than a Whisper: Celebrating the Music of Nanci Griffith [54]\n\nAwards and nominations\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Ceremony Nominated Work Category Result Ref. 2019 Americana Music Honors & Awards The War and Treaty Emerging Artist of the Year Won 2020 Folk Alliance International Artist of the Year Won 2021 Pop Awards Band/Group of the Year Nominated [55][56] Americana Music Honors & Awards Duo/Group of the Year Nominated 2022 Won 2023 CMT Music Awards \"That's How Love is Made\" Duo/Group Video of the Year Nominated [57] Academy of Country Music Awards The War and Treaty Vocal Duo of the Year Nominated Americana Music Honors & Awards Duo/Group of the Year Won Country Music Association Awards Vocal Duo of the Year Nominated Grammy Awards Best New Artist Nominated [58] \"Blank Page\" Best American Roots Song Nominated\n\nNotes\n\n[edit]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
