        "text": "“When I was asked to come to Nashville to prepare a meal for the Luck Showboat, I jumped at the chance,” Runkle says. “Whenever I’m putting a menu together I start with the ingredients I want to showcase. For this menu I drew inspiration from Nashville’s role as a hub of Southern cuisine, and featured some of the most unique and delicious ingredients produced in the Southern US.”\n\nRunkle’s menu for The Mountain Valley dinner aboard the Luck Showboat fully embodied his vision, featuring pimento cheese; gulf oysters; and a meat-and-three course. Attention to detail and, most importantly, the origin of the ingredients, contributed to a multi-course meal that brought Showboat guests to the heart of the south.\n\nOur annual Potluck Dinner makes for an incredible kick-off to Luck Reunion each year with lush, locally-sourced food from Texas-based chefs and intimate performances from some of our most treasured Luck Family Artists. The Potluck Dinner Hosted by the Austin Food and Wine Alliance Benefitting Farm Aid upped the ante this year with a roster of six female chefs from the Austin and surrounding areas. Anita Jaisinghani of Pondicheri (Houston, New York), Bonnie Wright of Olamaie (Austin), Misti Norris of Petra and the Beast (Dallas), Jessica Sanders of drink.well (Austin), Kristen Kish of Arlo Grey (Austin), and Anne Ng of Bakery Lorraine (Austin, San Antonio) joined PotLuck host chef and longtime Luck collaborator Ben Runkle, of Austin's Salt and Time, to collaborate on an innovative multi-course menu. We were honored to host not only these acclaimed chefs, but also local farmers from the community like Carol Ann Sayle of Boggy Creek Farms, to an evening of food, drink, and music by Ben Dickey and the Godfather of Luck himself, Willie Nelson. Follow along as we travel back to the source with the help of our longtime sponsor Mountain Valley Water to get an inside look at this year’s Potluck Dinner. Watch above for more.\n\nAs a part of our Sources series with Mountain Valley Spring Water, Kam Franklin found a new source of inspiration in a solo trip and a new destination. Read Franklin’s own words on Joanna’s Backyard below.\n\nWhen I worked my full time job, I spent a lot of time daydreaming about vacations. I’d sometimes go as far as filling up a shopping cart with flights, hotels, resort stays, etc. but I’d never purchase it. The timing was always off. The money was always wrong, and I would always find a million other things that “had” to be done instead of relaxing. At one point, I had somehow convinced myself that I hated relaxing. Mainly because I thought that it meant that something in my life wouldn’t get done if I took a break. Thankfully, the universe had other plans for me.\n\nA few years ago, I had to learn how to stop living my life for other people. I am a recovering people pleaser, and the way people thought about me used to consume me. From my art to my body, I lived to cater to others. That is, until I realized how much I was draining, neglecting, and aging myself to keep that shit up.\n\nAt first, telling people no, drove them and me crazy. I hated the feeling that came with letting people down, but regaining control of my life and my time gave me the opportunity to seek out the adventures that actually mattered to me.\n\nAround that time, I started working on a song called, “Do Whatever”, with my band, The Suffers. Here’s the first verse:\n\n“Full on disclosure\n\nI’m not here for exposure\n\nI came to have a good time\n\nSo let me shine\n\nIt ain’t gotta be a weekend\n\nTo find that joy that you’re seeking\n\nSo treat yourself to something more and you’ll be fine”\n\nThis song is a reminder to live my life everyday unapologetically. While I quickly figured out how to explore this professionally, personally, I was still a wreck. After every tour, I would come home to the same empty house, drink at the same bars around my hometown of Houston, TX, and pretty much repeat this routine. I found myself getting more and more sedentary, and while my professional career was thriving, my personal life was sad.\n\nSummer 2018 took a huge toll on me emotionally and professionally. I parted ways with my longtime management, I cut off a lot people that I felt were contributing to my sadness, and I slowly started taking the steps to seek my own personal joy. I knew that I was going to be on the road until December 30th, so I started researching places to bring in 2019. After reading up on tons of places and flights, I decided on Barbados.\n\nOne night, I found a cheap red-eye flight that would get me there on the afternoon of December 31st. After a while, I took a deep breath, and clicked “purchase”. Over the next few months, I would tell everyone, not to brag, but because I needed to convince myself not to back out from going. The recovering people pleaser within me knew that if I told people I was going, I would have to go. I only knew one person that lived down there, but they were going to be gone on their own holiday by the time I arrived, so I was on my own.\n\nI knew that I wanted to immerse myself in as much of the local culture as possible, so I opted to share a home with someone on Airbnb. There was only one review for Joanna’s house (my host), and it was in French, which I don’t speak. However, the one photo that stood out to me had a clear view of the crystal clear ocean in her backyard. The price was right, and even though I couldn’t see much else in the photos, I took a chance and made a reservation to stay with her.\n\nAfter a long, two month tour, opening for Thievery Corporation, the day had finally come to fly out. To say that I was nervous is an understatement. I almost missed my flight because I was late to the airport, but minus all of the delays, I finally made it. When I arrived to Joanna’s house, she met me with open arms, snacks, tea, and rum. Her energy was so warm and welcoming. After she showed me to my room, she walked me to the back patio, and there it was. In my backyard for the next 9 days, the brightest, bluest ocean water I’ve ever seen. We were in St. James, Barbados. It’s a tiny neighborhood on the island that is filled with locals, quiet beaches, and gorgeous homes. You’re right on the water, so there’s a constant breeze everywhere you go.\n\nI swam everyday. Every single day. My phone only worked when I was on the house WiFi, but since I rarely at the house, I was able to take in everything around me without the constant distraction that is the internet. Every time I swam, I felt lighter. I walked everywhere, rode on packed buses, asked tons of people for directions, took a ride on a sunset catamaran tour, danced to soca and reggae music every night until I couldn’t feel my legs, sipped way too much rum, flirted with everyone I met, and I spent as much time in the sun as possible. What was the end result? Joy. Pure joy.\n\nEvery morning that I was greeted by the ocean in Joanna’s backyard, I thanked God for the moment. I was so grateful for the opportunity to see something so beautiful in what felt like my own private oasis.\n\nOn my final day there, I couldn’t stop crying. Not because I was sad to leave, but because I knew that Barbados had brought back to life. The ocean healed me. The locals reminded me how beautiful I am without makeup. The fresh Marlin and Roti everyday lead to me losing weight without even trying. It’s amazing what happens to your body with fast food is nowhere to be found. I don’t know if my future vacations will be as lovely as this one, but I look forward to finding new ways to to fall in love with nature, people, food, and myself.\n\nCatch Kam on the road with her band The Suffers and watch their latest music video below:\n\nThere are certain roads you go down throughout your life that don't change much. Maybe a stoplight is added, or a restaurant changes hands and it’s just not the same as it once was, or a gas station closes down with their sign left untouched only to remind you of how cheap things used to be.\n\nThe road I'm thinking of leads to Hanging Rock State Park in Danbury, NC. Since I was a teen, it has been a place I go to seek inspiration. I’m calmed by its endless beauty. The mountains stand proud and tall, comforting me as the rest of the world seems to go swiftly by. I feel so small amongst them. They remind me not to get caught up in myself, and to look around, to stay grateful. I go live my life, travel the world, meet new people, eat new foods, and then return home with a newfound appreciation of what once seemed like a given. The road hasn’t changed. I have.\n\nRunkle and Duplechan are planning their menu for the first Luck Social event at Willie Nelson’s Luck, Texas ranch, an intimate dinner and concert experience for 50 lucky guests. Runkle, chosen for not only his talent but also his dedication to local farms and sustainable agriculture, has been Luck’s Culinary Director for the past several years stepping into the role of Head Chef for charity dinners the night before Luck Reunion, and curating food trucks for the Reunion alongside the Austin Food and Wine Alliance. This year, Runkle is hosting Duplechan for a collaborative, family-style meal for the Social. Though they have an idea of their main dishes, the final choices will be made based on what is fresh and available as they head back to the source to Boggy Creek and Eden East farms in East Austin.\n\nThe two chefs immediately beeline for the small produce stand tucked behind the trees and original farm house at Boggy Creek to pick sheeling beans, butternut squash, fennel, and wild greens among other freshly picked produce for the Social dinner. Boggy Creek has been a staple in locally owned organic farms for over 20 years since its inception in 1992 and a source of community and inspiration for the quickly growing urban farming movement. Led by Carol Ann Sayle and the late Larry Butler, Boggy Creek has been described as “the center of the plate, the heartbeat of the local food scene,” by former Austin Statesman food writer Kitty Crider in Butler’s obituary after his passing in July. Both Runkle and Duplechan concur, expressing their appreciation and respect for Sayle and Butler and are greeted warmly by Sayle upon arrival. Sayle knows their favorites and their investment in clean produce and proceeds to take us on a full tour of the farm. Tucked behind the farmhouse and stand are rows of carefully placed crops, from squash to carrots to greens, each row has been immaculately tended by Sayle and her team. Rows of greenhouses full of herbs and a large pen full of chickens line the other side of the walkway and Sayle’s trusty farm dog nips at our ankles if we get too close to the flock. Runkle and Duplechan chat and laugh with Sayle as they make their final selections and are ready to head to the next location.\n\nRight down the road less than half a mile away, we arrive at our second stop of the morning, Eden East Farms (formerly Springdale farm). This area of East Austin is home to many local farms as much of the land is fed by Boggy Creek as it winds its way south to the Colorado River. Eden East now hosts a farm to table restaurant of their own offering weekly brunches and special occasion dinners. Tucked behind the outdoor restaurant seating is a small farm stand hosting not only East’s own produce from the grounds, but also offering selections from other locally grown, organic farmers as well. Tables are overflowing with veggies, local honey, microgreens, natural balms and salves made from local herbs and other goods. Here, the soil is so fertile we notice a stray squash growing right in the walking path. Runkle and Duplechan finish their shopping, gathering the last of the summer’s sweet peaches to be made into pies for the Social’s final course. We part ways as the chefs determine their final menus for the Social the next day.\n\nAmongst the newest of AmericanaFest participants, the Watson Twins spoke poignantly to the bliss of dodging the typical genre affiliation. Having collaborated with iconic indie acts such Jenny Lewis after a Gospel-heavy upbringing, the buzzed about pair shared their own fitting definition of the Americana platform. “It really gives people the opportunity to explore and really find their sound. You don't feel trapped into having to say, 'I do country, I do folk',” they said. The duo also delved into influence and the source of their creativity: “Someone said about our new record [Hustle and Shake], that it's 'country-soul'. Sure, if that's what you feel, that's awesome. We grew up in the church singing Gospel and that really was part of our fabric. But alongside that we were listening to Willie Nelson and Emmylou Harris and Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young and all those people and genres helped form how we sing and write today. Is Americana a catch-all? Maybe, and that's kick-ass.”\n\nAs the platform continues to develop its mission alongside artists looking to share their own tales through art, there is a common thread that stands out: Americana is an ode to the roots of our American culture, and the continuation of the narrative of our histories...straight from the source.\n\nphotos by Vivien Best\n\nEcho Park may seem like an unlikely place for the Luck Family to land, but even cowboys and outlaws made it in and out of Hollywood eventually. The Los Angeles neighborhood of Echo Park, just south of Silver Lake, has been home to music legends like Jackson Browne, Warren Zevon, and Gram Parsons over the years. It's rumored that the \"Burrito King\" restaurant down the street from the park on Sunset Blvd. is the very spot that influenced the Flying Burrito Brothers' name. Zevon's song \"Carmelita\" (also recorded by Flaco Jimenez, Dwight Yoakam, and Linda Ronstadt) recalls his time in the neighborhood: \"I hear Mariachi static on my radio/And the tubes they glow in the dark/And I'm there with her in Ensenada/And I'm here in Echo Park\". In recent years, Echo Park has quickly evolved into what has been called one of the hottest areas of the city. Eight-year-old Echo Park Rising, the community’s landmark music and arts festival founded by Liz Garo (founder of the local venue, the Echo) and KamranV (Chamber of Commerce President), has become a source of inspiration and evolution within LA’s creative landscape. We attended the fest with our friends at Mountain Valley Spring Water last weekend to dig into the community and culture of Echo Park that has come to serve as a vibrant source for creativity in LA.\n\nThe Grand Ole Echo (GOE), self-described as LA's \"country and not so country music showcase\", bridges the gap from the seemingly separated Texas and Nashville music scenes to that of Los Angeles. GOE's Jocelyn Romo reminded us that country roots run deep in California: \"This is is about as Western as you can get, literally. Its very easy to forget that there’s a great community for country music, for anything from like very traditional stuff to something a little bit more far out like Gram Parsons...that was all very much centered in California.\" GOE is just one of many widely varying showcases and events throughout the three day festival, including drawing workshops, free yoga and movement classes, wildlife walks around Echo Park Lake, and even a DJ workshop for kids.\n\nAs Echo Park and Echo Park Rising grow simultaneously, one constant remains in local venue the Echo. Liz Garo opened the venue in 2001, ten years before the launch of Echo Park Rising. Over the years the venue, alongside its festival extension, has grown into a staple for up and coming local acts and touring indie bands (including a few of our #LuckFamily members like Aaron Lee Tasjan and Cut Worms). Artist Theresa Wayman of Warpaint, popularly known as TT, has been living in Echo Park for over a decade and recalls the Echo as an establishment that marked the community long before it gained popularity: \"...It didn’t seem like anything was going to be happening down there or up here. There weren’t that many great restaurants up here on Sunset, and things were just really different. But the Echo was there. The Echo was happening, Echoplex was happening...I think that’s a really big point of interest and also has been establishing the culture here for so long.\"\n\nBoth the festival and the neighborhood are becoming permanent additions in the creative tapestry of Los Angeles. Like every creative hub, Echo Park is experiencing growing pains; but with the rising popularity of the festival and the supportive community, it continues to thrive. Fest attendee Paulina Ruiz said, “Echo Park is young and its happening and it’s changing, but that doesn’t mean that the youth is not going to survive here.” Echo Park Rising founder Liz Garo agreed and commented on the uniqueness of her community: “I think like a lot of the neighborhoods in LA it has a good mix of the old and new. There’s a lot of history here. It’s pretty diverse still but at the same time there’s new businesses coming. I think it’s a good little microcosm of what LA is, or can be, just with the different mix of people and different businesses and the independent culture.” And there’s no doubt about it, Echo Park is on the rise.\n\nBackstage, The War And Treaty expanded on their inspiration and intentions through music; elaborating on the past and how it feeds into current art. While both Michael Trotter Jr. and Tanya Blount Trotter grew up in the church, they had vastly different paths to music. “It quickly dawned on me that this was really something I wanted to do when I watched two of my favorite artists of all time, Ray Charles and Johnny Cash,” said Trotter Jr. “Their worlds just started opening up...and I just saw how music can really have an impact on inclusion. You see great artists back in the day always collaborating, like Ray and Willie Nelson, you know? The source, honestly, is just living, And then I met my wife...I said this out there on stage and I’ll say it again – over the course of walking in this life I've learned that love is the only key that's played out in life that is never out of tune. Blount Trotter added: “For me, I learned from my mom, an opera singer; and my brother who sang in the church – and dedicated the song [onstage at Newport] to my mom because my mother's death was actually my passageway into life, into my life. And I've had a struggle, it’s been a daily struggle: why can’t I just let her be free and let her spirit go?. And it’s because I had to look death in the face and say, 'you held your end of the bargain; you gave her peace.' And now I've got to hold my end of the bargain to her, and to myself, and live. And living is every moment that I'm in – this moment that I'm in with you all...I'm in the moment, entirely.”\n\nThe festival's sources are clear: artists and the folk family have the opportunity to come together despite differences. Jay Sweet, Newport Festivals Network executive producer, declares the festival as “the island of misfit toys”, which is fitting; as the acts curated defy genre. Sweet declared: “I mean, look, there may be an artist that has a radio hit but maybe [others] don’t....but that wasn’t really the goal or the criteria. The criteria is, like: Is it good? Does it stand the test of time? Is it something that’s going to carry over, Is it something that’s going to mean something?”.\n\nSweet’s description is apt: the festival breeds unique relationships between the “misfit toys” who land on the island. Just prior to cameo appearances with Jenny Lewis and Cheech & Chong, first-time Newport performer Lukas Nelson was stunned that he’d soon share the stage with two vastly different, but equally special, acts. “I don't really believe that saying...'the road to hell starts with good intentions,'” he said. “I think good intentions actually start good things. And being in this beautiful place -- a fort that never saw a battle? That’s incredible. That’s something I think that came from good intentions.”"
