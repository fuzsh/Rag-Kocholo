        "text": "It’s Monday. Let’s try and start this week off on a positive note.\n\nSo Saturday, I’m flipping through the channels to discover a channel playing Sister Act & Sister Act 2 back to back!\n\nBoth of these VHS’ were in heavy rotation in my childhood because they are pretty flawless. Just entertaining in every way. But for this post, let’s focus on the 2nd movie where “urban gangsta flava” saves the school!\n\nWe open with Whoopi rehashing the events of the first movie in a musical number for the gods!\n\nSeriously. This is not even 5 minutes into the movie and it’s already amazing. Sorry for the foreign language, but that’s all that I could find via the YouTube. When Whoopi yells, “Oh, I was a hoe!” I just can’t stop laughing.\n\nLong story short, Whoopi has to come revisit the nuns who protected her and save the school with her sass and musical abilities. She accepts after a classic Catholic guilt trip (so I’ve heard).\n\nShe meets the students who are so urban and anti-establishment and it’s all perfect. Let’s get a rundown of our characters:\n\nJennifer “Love” Hewitt as Prissy Snobby Girl\n\nSketch who can’t stay awake because he has a job\n\nCity High lead singer/Afrocentric one\n\nFrankay aka White Boy who raps\n\nTanya aka Flawless Vocal Goddess with copious access to Blue Magic\n\nAnd Lauryn Hill as Sassmaster Rita Wilson.\n\nAs with every single 90’s movie set in an urban setting, the kids react sorely to being educated, leading with Rita walking out of Whoopi’s tough love.\n\nThe relationship between the students and Whoopi lead to what is to my knowledge the greatest scene ever placed on film.\n\nI GOT THE FLOW,\n\nY’ALL GOTTA GO,\n\nSO GO GET YA BAGS SO YOU CAN GO,\n\nHO HO!\n\nI dare you to try and come up with a more hilarious moment than this. You can’t. Just stop.\n\nAnyways, after a series of pranks and more urban gangsta flava, Whoopi is teaching us the most valuable lesson.\n\n“If you want to be somebody, If you want to go somewhere, You better wake up and PAY ATTENTION!’\n\nKelly Clarkson lookalike is all, we need to liven this up.\n\nDROP THAT BEAT!\n\nWhoopi is all, “Talent, what?!” and is like, we’re turning you into a choir. No wonder you’re in the music class!\n\nBut before we get all the kids on board, let’s check in with our nuns!\n\nOH MY GOD YES.\n\nThis is all just great fun, but nothing is better than my lady and her jig yelling “Vote for me, and I’ll set you freeeeee!”\n\nI just love that.\n\nSome more plot, some more plot. Let’s skip to His Eye Is On The Sparrow.\n\nJust flawless. Completely and utterly flawless. The harmonies. The talent. Lauryn Hill has become a bit of a punchline, but for serious. She is so ridiculously amazing here. And Tanya! Why didn’t she have a better singing career? So pressed right now.\n\nAnyway, we get a montage and Lauryn Hill is back in the choir and we’re ready for our first performance!\n\nThe kids are still nervous about their reps and Afrocentric is leading the choir but his nerves are getting in the way!\n\nWhoopi is all, “This is trash. Scales and Arpeggios time.” But then a key change leads to a dramatic increase in talent and this…\n\nYAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAASS!!!!\n\nSeriously, this is amazing.\n\nBy sheer coincidence, the nuns are cleaning out a room and the high school was the best at singing in the 70’s and this will save the school. The kids are entered, Sheryl Lee Ralph (Rita’s mom) HATES music!\n\nHere’s a reenactment:\n\nThe accuracy though…\n\nThe Crispy villain guy is all huffy, the monks are on an adventure, and now we’re at the competition!\n\nThis turquoise choir sings Lord, Send A Revival and should have been the runner ups.\n\nThe intimidating stuffy choir also sings Joyful, Joyful and scares the kids into wanting to quit.\n\nWhoopi is all, be yourself and show off that urban gangsta flava!\n\nAnd now, the moment that you’ve all been waiting for!\n\nI can’t even begin to breakdown how amazing this is. If you don’t know the lyrics, you are LYING! Rita’s mom shows up and puts some fear, but Lauryn Hill is all talented and sounds amazing. Frankaaaay and Sketch rap. The ladies singing “Come and join the chorus!!!” blow my mind every time. The tenors hitting the “with the light of day, lord!” is such a sweet touch. It’s all just so good.\n\nMy personal favorite moment is the bodyrolls to Joyful, Joyful while Frankaaaay raps about Jesus.\n\nAnd then, the school is saved thanks to all the talent and Crispy is foiled. And Whoopi is not really a nun. THE END.\n\nExcept not!\n\nUgh, the 90’s were just so great.\n\nWe have a movie with a completely standard plot saved by amazing musical moments and hilarious acting. I could watch this movie every day.\n\nWhat are your favorite moments? Do you have fond memories watching these two movies? Let us know in the comments. I’ll let you sing backup when we perform Joyful, Joyful!\n\nFirst. HAPPY FRIDAY! We all made it through another long week. TURN UP my friends!\n\nSecond, if for some reason you don’t know who Lauryn Hill is or you don’t know about Sister Act 2, you have homework to do. Sister Act 2 was THAT movie back in the day and still SLAYS. I don’t want to talk about the fact that it came out in 1993 (Dear Lord I’m old). It was and is a PERFECT damn movie from beginning to end. Here’s one of several flawless moments…\n\n::dies laughing:: Never gets old….\n\nThis movie gave us a killer rendition of “His Eye is on The Sparrow” (Shout to Tanya Blount on that harmony tho!), “Joyful Joyful”, AND Ms. Lauryn Hill emerged to kill the scene. Her voice is out of this world extraordinary. No one compares. She sang her heart out in “Killing Me Softly” with The Fugees; so much so that it is the only version of that song that exists (No shade Roberta Flack). Then in 1998 she dropped a once in a lifetime album. “The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill” . This album STILL is relevant and perfect album. An album in which I revisit regularly. Ex-Factor? Can’t Take My Eyes Off of You? Tell Him? TELL HIM?!?!?!??! The album is just ***FLAWLESS!\n\nWoo now that I got that out of the way….. I think we know what happens next in her life….\n\nThe moral of the story is before I went to sleep last night I said, “I wonder if she’s been performing lately.” I jumped on YouTube. And y’all. She’s back. Her voice in this Stevie Wonder cover of “I Never Dreamed You’d Leave in Summer” gave me chills all over. GET INTO IT.\n\nShe also performed “Final Hour” and I got my entire life. Sounds NOTHING like the album version. She’s out here snatching wigs. Get READY!\n\nMUSIC. MUSIC!!!!!! THIS is the quality of music that we should be expecting form our artists. No one is making GOOD music like this on the regular anymore.\n\n“No one makes albums anymore.” ~ Beyonce\n\nWe’ve grown to comfortable with “pop music” and quick hits. We miss you Ms. Lauryn Hill. We miss music with a message. While Beyonce BETTER win all of the Grammys next year….I won’t be mad if Lauryn sneaks up with a new album and takes a couple. She deserves it.\n\nCan we also note how GORGEOUS she is? When she hits you with that smile at the end? Stunning. We LOVE you Ms. Hill!!!!\n\nOk I’m out y’all."
