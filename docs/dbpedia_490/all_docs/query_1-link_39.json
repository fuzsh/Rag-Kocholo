        "text": "\"I'm going to die out here,\" he thought.\n\nIn Iraq, Michael Trotter Jr. had been deemed the weak link by the other soldiers in his infantry unit because of his fear.\n\nKnowing that Trotter loved music, an officer led him one day to a piano in one of Saddam Hussein's bombed-out palaces that U.S. troops were using as a Forward Operating Base. There, Trotter taught himself to play the instrument and began composing memorial songs for fellow soldiers killed in action. In the process, he learned how music can heal.\n\nHe's been out of the Army for 11 years, but music remains his emotional outlet.\n\nHe formed a duo with his wife, Tanya Blount-Trotter, and after going through a number of band names, the couple settled on The War and Treaty.\n\nThey were the talk of last year's Americana Music Festival and Conference when they wowed the Cannery Ballroom in Buddy Miller's stead after he'd fallen ill.\n\nOn Aug. 10, The War and Treaty will release their first full-length album, \"Healing Tide.\" The project, which blends soul, folk, rock and gospel — Blount-Trotter calls that powerful sound \"musical gumbo\" — was produced by Miller and recorded over five days at his home studio in Nashville.\n\n\"I just completely fell in love with them,\" said Miller, who was introduced to the band by producer and musician Don Was. \"(Their sound) wasn’t a retro R&B thing that’s been done to death. It wasn’t anything you could put your finger on.\"\n\nMiller and the duo immediately hit it off upon meeting, and one day, said Trotter, Miller called the couple with a question: \"He was like, 'I’m sitting here watching YouTube videos of y’all with my friend Emmy. Do you know her?' \"\n\n\"Emmy who, Buddy?\"\n\nEmmylou Harris, a Country Music Hall of Famer, had fallen in love with the duo, too. She wound up singing on their album's rootsy, fiddle-laced eighth track, \"Here is Where the Loving is At,\" and even showed up to the studio with a batch of delicious homemade brownies on Trotter's birthday.\n\n\"Two days later, I tried (her recipe) and mine turned out like cornbread,\" said Blount-Trotter.\n\n\"We don't talk about it,\" joked Trotter.\n\n'I just sat at the piano and burst into tears'\n\nTrotter's path to music was a rocky one. Born in Cleveland, he and his mother were in and out of homeless shelters after escaping his abusive father.\n\nAt 19, he fathered a child; to support his young family, he enlisted in the Army. After basic training, he was stationed in Germany and then deployed to Iraq.\n\n\"In my unit of 986-plus soldiers, they identified me as the weak link because ... I was extremely terrified,\" he explained.\n\nEvery explosion sent a bolt of terror through his 6-foot-2-inch frame, and he couldn't control his despair and guilt when his friends were killed. Fifteen years later, he chokes up when describing those days: \"The hardest part is seeing yourself live through it when so many that you love and respect die.\"\n\nOne day, an officer, Capt. Robert Scheetz, told Trotter to follow him. \"I remember going down in the basement of the FOB — essentially one of (Hussein's) palaces — crawling over brick and mortar and soot and dirt and dust and sand, then getting into this room,\" Trotter said. \"There’s this piano, unscathed.\"\n\nWhen Trotter was off duty, he'd calm his fears by plonking out \"Mary Had a Little Lamb\" and \"Lean on Me.\" Eventually, he started composing his own songs.\n\n\"(The piano) was everything to me,\" he said. \"It was my friend. At times it was my confidante. ... There were many days and nights I just sat at the piano and burst into tears and I couldn’t control it. That was the one place where I felt like I didn’t have to.\"\n\nScheetz was killed in 2004 when his vehicle hit a roadside bomb. Trotter wrote a song in his honor. When he performed it at the memorial service, he saw firsthand how he could use music to help those who were grieving: \"That was the first time I got serious about writing songs because I saw what it could do. ... I remember saying, 'You know what? Music is bringing healing to these guys. This is amazing.' \"\n\nA chance encounter spawned a marriage and The War and Treaty\n\nBlount-Trotter, who grew up outside Washington, D.C., has been making music for most of her life. That's her singing \"His Eye Is on the Sparrow\" alongside Lauryn Hill in the 1993 movie \"Sister Act 2: Back in the Habit.\" A year later, she released her debut solo record, \"Natural Thing.\" Before the decade was out, she had been signed to Sean Combs' Bad Boy Entertainment, but the record she started there was never completed or released.\n\nThe two met in 2010 at a Maryland music festival that Blount-Trotter helped organize. Trotter, by then out of the Army, was one of the performers. Drawn by the depth and honesty in his songs, she ran across the field in high heels after his set and asked if he ever collaborated with other artists.\n\nThey exchanged phone numbers, but Trotter, wrestling with post-traumatic stress disorder and his insecurities, threw her number away. So she called him.\n\nThe two started working on music for a project Blount-Trotter and her brother had started. \"My brother couldn’t make it to the recording session so Michael put his vocals on the song and a friend of ours heard it,\" she remembered. \"She was like, 'Do you all hear that?' ”\n\nTheir voices meshed perfectly on the tape.\n\nBoth had been married before and had separately vowed never to do it again. But before long, they'd fallen in love, and got married.\n\nThey blended their families and welcomed a son, Legend (now 6, he spent the summer touring with his mom and dad).\n\nIt wasn't easy. The family moved frequently, bouncing between motels and friends' houses, and Trotter's untreated PTSD left him unable to hold a job. He hadn't even told his wife that he'd been in combat, wanting to keep those memories buried. But Fourth of July fireworks brought them all back.\n\n\"I’m crawling on the bed, screaming and crying, my children are crying, my wife is crying,\" he remembered. \"Finally when the dust settles, she’s like, 'You know you have to talk to me, right? Because that’s not normal.' \"\n\nHe started going to therapy and began writing up to a dozen songs a day about his experiences.\n\n\"I’m still finding out about what happened over there, because there’s layers to it,\" said Blount-Trotter, resting her hand on her husband's leg. \"When he’s ready to tell me, he tells me. When he’s not, he writes a song about it and I get to learn it that way.\n\n\"It's complex. ... But you have to choose to love like there’s no tomorrow.\"\n\nOn making joyful music: 'It's an act of service'\n\nIf you're within arm's reach of the Trotters, you will be hugged. Repeatedly.\n\nBut since their arms can't physically encircle every listener, their powerful voices do the job for them on \"Healing Tide,\" whether they're belting out the powerful \"Are You Ready to Love Me\" or sweetly singing the tender \"Little New Bern,\" an ode to the idyllic summers Blount-Trotter spent on her grandparents' farm in North Carolina.\n\n\"It's an act of service,\" said Blount-Trotter of The War and Treaty's exhilarating, joyous performances. \"To get up there and remind people how great they are, it’s a responsibility for us. We want to bring that joy to our audience.\"\n\n\"Our duty as human beings is to love one another ... (and) make sure that we all know just how much we matter,\" Trotter added. \"It’s not that we just matter, but we matter to one another.\"\n\nIf you go\n\nWhat: The War and Treaty\n\nWhen: 5 p.m. Aug. 22\n\nWhere: Grimey's New and Preloved Music (1604 Eighth Ave. S.)"
