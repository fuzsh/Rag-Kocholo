        "text": "Hollywood scriptwriters have been talking with the War and Treaty’s Michael and Tanya Trotter about their life story — and for good reason. It’s too dramatic to make up.\n\nA budding singer (Michael) lives in homeless shelters with his mom after leaving his abusive dad, joins the Army and is sent to the Iraq War, where he copes with post-traumatic stress disorder by writing songs about his dead colleagues on a piano in Saddam Hussein’s bombed-out palace.\n\nYears later, still dealing with suicidal thoughts, he meets a minor R&B star (Tanya) who helps him with his mental health. They fall in love, marry, have a child, launch a gospel-soul duo, and find massive fame and fortune in the mostly white world of country music.\n\nIt’s all true, except for the massive-fame-and-fortune part. But don’t be surprised if that happens, too.\n\nThe War and Treaty — a name partly inspired by something Tanya said to Michael after a spat — signed with Universal Music’s Nashville label, which last year released the duo’s fourth album, Lover’s Game. The War and Treaty’s current tour finds them opening two shows for the Rolling Stones in July and headlining a free concert June 21 at Levitt Pavilion in Arlington.\n\nI spoke with Michael and Tanya by video call from their home in Nashville. Our conversation has been edited for clarity.\n\nMichael, you were raised in a strict Christian household in Cleveland. I’ve read that your mom rigged your radio so you couldn’t hear contemporary music.\n\nOh, that’s very much true. I had an old AM radio from the ‘50s, and my mother stuck some things in there so the dial wouldn’t turn to the right where the R&B and hip-hop stations were. So that’s where my love for country music actually developed, because I fell in love with Willie Nelson and Patsy Cline, and I thought this was current music. I’d go to school and all the kids would be talking about Biggie and Tupac and the new Aaliyah, and I’m like, “Man! How about that new Johnny Cash song, ‘Ring of Fire’?” The kids would be like, “What the hell are you talking about?” Finally, my teacher said, “Michael? Come here. Some of those artists you mentioned, they’re not new. They’re dead.” It horrified me, man. But when I told my mom, she thought it was so funny.\n\nIn 2004, you were a U.S. Army soldier in Iraq, where you played piano in one of Saddam Hussein’s former palaces. Eventually, you wrote songs in tribute to colleagues who died. What led you to music in Iraq?\n\nPlaying Saddam’s piano really took my mind away from the war. If I sat down at the piano, I could be whisked away to Carnegie Hall or the Ryman or anywhere. But it wasn’t until a couple of soldiers were killed that I understood my true purpose was to be a healer, to use the piano and my vocal abilities to comfort people. I believe [music] saved my life, too. I’m healed all the time on the stage when I hear Tanya singing. I just let her vocals wash all over me and heal me.\n\nTanya, you had some success in the ‘90s under your birth name, Tanya Blount. You signed with Polydor and Bad Boy Records and sang alongside Lauryn Hill in 1993′s Sister Act 2: Back in the Habit. How did you merge careers with Michael?\n\nA lady had been raving about Michael and playing his song on the radio. And then I saw him performing at the Spirit of Love Festival in Maryland [in 2010], where I was performing. I couldn’t believe what I was watching. There weren’t more than 40 people out there, and Michael was performing like it was 50,000 people, really giving it his all. So I darted across the field to meet him. I jumped in heels first — no pun intended. My heels were literally getting stuck in the grass. But we met and exchanged numbers, and we talked for hours. And he wrote a complete record of songs about everything we talked about, which blew my mind. I’d never met anyone like him. We just fell in love, you know?\n\nThe War and Treaty has always fused gospel with blues, rock and soul. But more recently, you’ve made inroads into country music, which hasn’t always been welcoming to Black musicians. The Dallas-raised country singer Mickey Guyton told me she was warned about her songs sounding “too R&B.” But you’ve managed to keep a strong R&B element to your music.\n\nTanya: Mickey Guyton is a friend of ours. She highlights a lot of [Black country] artists, which is really important. We’ve been fortunate enough that our label told us to just be who we are. Is it a harder road? Of course it is. Because it’s a path that hasn’t been taken, you know? Artists like Michael and I, or Tyler Childers or Sierra Ferrell, we are not necessarily mainstream radio artists. But this is the path we’re going to take.\n\nMichael, you’ve talked about country music needing to move away from its “racial undertone.” What did you mean by that?\n\nWell, I think in our country a lot of healing needs to take place between those that look like you and those that look like me and all the others in between. And that trickles into other areas of our lives, like the music industry and country music. We’ve got to find a way to come together and recognize that, hey, we don’t have to carry the banners of hatred our parents and grandparents carried. We don’t have to live by the creeds and motives of the past. We don’t have to live by fear. We can live by love.\n\nIn 2022, the War and Treaty covered the Rolling Stones’ “It’s Only Rock ‘n’ Roll (But I Like It),” and now you’re opening for the band July 10 and 13 in Los Angeles. The Stones have always spoken about the huge debt they owe to American blues and soul artists. How do you see their role in Black music?\n\nMichael: They were a bold part of a pivotal moment in blues. People like Muddy Waters, at the tail end of their careers, they were struggling. Maybe he hadn’t made good financial decisions. And in the land of the free and the home of the brave, maybe he didn’t feel that brave. And how ironic is it that to his rescue would come white guys from another country with guitars and overzealous ideals, that they would resurrect him and allow him to ride off into the sunset as he should, as a hero of American culture? My dream is to look Mick Jagger and Keith Richards in their eyes and say, “Thank you for not forgetting about us. Thank you for seeing us for what we are: The true kings and queens of our country.”\n\nJohn Legend’s Get Lifted Film Co. is developing a movie based on your and Tanya’s lives. Do you worry about a possible Hollywood-ization of your story?\n\nMichael: No. Tanya and I have both read the script. We were very involved. The one thing we didn’t want is to have fluff. We wanted to be as real and honest as possible. We understand there are creative liberties people can take in Hollywood, and I’m proud to say not much was taken here. This story is strictly about love. In fact, the tagline is, “The war brought him music, but music brought him love.”\n\nI know what you’re thinking. Is there an obvious choice to play me? And someone has stepped up to the plate to play me … When you look at us and listen to us, it’s absolutely stunning to see how much we’re alike.\n\nWho is it?\n\nI’m proud to say the person to play me in this film is none other than Tom Cruise.\n\nThat’s hilarious! Seriously, though. Have you and Tanya thought about who should play you?\n\nMichael: I think Kenan Thompson would be a wonderful choice. I’ve seen a serious side of him that’s very reminiscent of myself. And for Tanya, I believe strongly in the acting abilities of Keke Palmer, who’s been stepping out into more serious roles recently.\n\nTanya: Fantasia would be great. She’s a great singer, and her story is very reminiscent of mine, being the underdog. I love Victoria Monét, too. She’d be wonderful. Her spirit is very humble. Very much like I was when I was that age.\n\nI saw you give Al Green a run for his money in 2019 when you opened for him at Toyota Music Factory. In October, you’ll open for Lyle Lovett at the Majestic Theatre, but on June 21, you’ll be the headliner for a free concert at Levitt Pavilion.\n\nTanya: We’re really excited to be a part of these Levitt Foundation events so the whole family can go. When I was [growing up in the Washington, D.C., area], there was a foundation much like the Levitt Foundation that allowed us to go see Kool and the Gang, Ashford and Simpson, all these bands. We couldn’t afford $75 tickets. So I’m looking forward to playing in the Dallas community for people who might not have the funds to come. I’m hoping we can help create some great family memories.\n\nDetails\n\nThe War and Treaty performs with opening act Jordan Nix on June 21 at 7:30 p.m. at Levitt Pavilion, 100 W.
