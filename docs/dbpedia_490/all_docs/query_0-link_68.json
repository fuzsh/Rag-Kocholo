        "text": "The 1979 song \"Ring My Bell\" was originally written for then twelve-year-old Lattisaw, as a teenybopper song about kids talking on the telephone.[4] When Lattisaw signed with a different label, Anita Ward was asked to sing it instead, and it became Ward's only major hit.[5]\n\nLattisaw recorded her first album for Cotillion Records at the age of 12 in 1979, under the direction of record producer Van McCoy.[6] However, it was not until she affiliated with Narada Michael Walden, a former drummer with the Mahavishnu Orchestra who was just beginning a career as a producer, that she found larger success.[6] Under Walden's direction, she scored several R&B hit albums between 1981 and 1986.[6] She also opened for the Jacksons' Triumph Tour in 1981.[7]"
