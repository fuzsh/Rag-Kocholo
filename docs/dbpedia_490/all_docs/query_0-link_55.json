        "text": "The War and Treaty, the duo whose riveting live performances and stirring recordings have earned them an ardent and loyal following among music cognoscenti in Nashville and beyond has signed with Rounder Records. Rounder President John Strohm remarked, “We are beyond thrilled to have the opportunity to work with The War and Treaty, a group that utilizes incredible vocal talent and extraordinary songwriting chops to deliver an affirming message of unity and inclusiveness that is very welcome in this age.” He continues, “They encompass many of Rounder’s genre traditions while crafting a fresh, exciting sound that is entirely their own.”\n\nThe husband and wife duo of Michael Trotter Jr. and Tanya Blount-Trotter is the subject of an in-depth profile that aired on CBS Sunday Morning on May 26. In the segment, veteran correspondent Conor Knighton recounts the couple’s compelling origin story, which touches on Michael Trotter’s experiences as an Iraqi War veteran and his struggles with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder; Tanya Blount-Trotter’s early career as a musician and actor; and brings us into their present-day lives as they balance the demands of making music together, marriage, and parenthood. View the story HERE.\n\nSince forming in 2014, The War and Treaty has won tremendous acclaim and accolades. NPR Music praised the couple’s “ecstatic, empowering sense of partnership that serves as the duo’s creative engine and core message,” while the Associated Press dubbed them “a powerhouse R&B duo who sound as though they were born to sing together.”\n\nThis month, the Americana Music Association announced the nominations for its annual Honors & Awards, and The War and Treaty received nods in two categories: Duo/Group of the Year and Emerging Act of the Year. The awards show will take place in Nashville on September 11.\n\nThe group, which just wrapped up a run of dates opening for Al Green, will be on tour all summer including support dates with Brandi Carlile and Jason Isbell. They will also perform at Floydfest, XPonential Music Festival, Edmonton Folk Festival, and Dierks Bentley’s Seven Peaks Music Festival.\n\nA full list of tour dates is below, and more shows will be announced in the coming weeks.\n\nThe War and Treaty’s debut for Rounder Records is slated for release in 2020.\n\n6.1 Riverbend Festival Chattanooga, TN\n\n6.6 WTMD First Thursday Festival Baltimore, MD\n\n6.7 Friday Cheers Richmond, VA\n\n6.8 Nelsonville Art & Music Festival Nelsonville, OH\n\n6.15 Beacon Park Detroit, MI\n\n6.22 Founders Fest Grand Rapids, MI\n\n6.23 Mechanic Street House Concerts Cleveland, OH\n\n6.24 The 9th Ward at Babeville Buffalo, NY\n\n6.27 FestivALL Charleston Charleston, WV\n\n6.29 Festival International De Jazz De Montreal Montreal, QC\n\n6.30 Levitt Pavillion SteelStacks Bethlehem, PA\n\n7.1 The Stephen Talkhouse Amagansett, NY\n\n7.3 Space Ballroom Hamden, CT\n\n7.4 L.L.Bean Summer in the Park Concert Series Freeport, ME\n\n7.5 The Colonial Theatre Bethlehem, NH\n\n7.6 Americana Rhythm & Roots Festival Newburyport, MA\n\n7.11 Under the Bridge London, UK\n\n7.13 North Sea Jazz Festival Rotterdam, NE\n\n7.20 Master Musicians Festival Somerset, KY\n\n7.24 The Freeman Stage Selbyville, DE\n\n7.25 Battery Park City’s River & Blues Annual Summer Concert Series\n\nNew York, NY\n\n7.26 FloydFest Floyd, VA\n\n7.28 XPoNential Music Festival Philadelphia, PA\n\n7.30 National Black Theatre Festival Winston-Salem, NC\n\n7.31 WFPK Waterfront Wednesdays Louisville, KY\n\n8.2 Providence Medical Center Amphitheater Bonner Springs, KS\n\n8.3 Peoria Civic Center Theater Peoria, IL\n\n8.4 Hinterland Music Festival St Charles, IA\n\n8.5 The Waiting Room Omaha, NE\n\n8.8 Snow Park Amphitheater Park City, UT\n\n8.10 Burnaby Blues & Roots Festival Burnaby, Canada\n\n8.11 Edmonton Folk Music Festival Edmonton, AB\n\n8.13 Tractor Tavern Seattle, WA\n\n8.14 Mississippi Studios Portland, OR\n\n8.16 Top Hat Lounge Missoula, MT\n\n8.17 Moonlight Music Festival Big Sky, MT\n\n8.18 Folks Festival Lyons, CO\n\n8.21 The Raccoon Motel Davenport, IA\n\n8.22 Turner Hall Ballroom Milwaukee, WI\n\n8.23 High Noon Saloon Madison, WI\n\n8.24 Porcupine Mountains Music Festival Ontonagon, MI\n\n8.26 Minnesota State Fair Saint Paul, MN\n\n8.27 Minnesota State Fair Saint Paul, MN\n\n8.29 Lake Superior Big Top Chautauqua Bayfield, WI\n\n8.30 Lake Superior Big Top Chautauqua Bayfield, WI\n\n9.1 Seven Peaks Festival Buena Vista, CO\n\n9.7 David Shaw’s Big River Get Down Hamilton, OH\n\n9.21 Pilgrimage Music & Cultural Festival Franklin, TN\n\n9.27 Levitt Shell at Overton Park Memphis, TN\n\n9.28 Roots N Blues N BBQ Festival Columbia, MO\n\n11.11 All The Best Fest (Nov. 11-15) Punta Cana, D.R."
