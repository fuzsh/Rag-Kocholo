        "text": "Nat King Cole, Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, and Mr. Sammy Davis Jr would be proud of this young man. Thrilling us all with songs from the past such as Soon I Will Be Done and Smile Michael Trotter jr is sure to win the hearts of the world with his talent. Noted for his works in the United States Armed Forces as a Army War Veteran (Iraq) Trotter is both humbled and thankful to be alive, yet the music doesn’t stop there. With his eager approach to any stage he reels all emotion in when it comes to relating to the world he both served and protected. In addition to being a prolific artist Mike is also a songwriter whose lyrics are filled with unparelled repertoire that ring with positivity such as “The world could be beautiful, if we would be beautiful. I know we are beautiful, so with that in mind lets be BEAUTIFUL”. Trotter is currently in the studio working with the Legendary Stacy Lattisaw on her return to the music world. In addition Trotter is working on his much anticipated solo debut album which is not yet scheduled to be released until 2014. He is married to the grammy Nominated Philanthropist Tanya Blount and together they have a son named Legend. When asked if it was any message he wanted to relay the world what would that be? Trotter quotes a passage from a book he is currently writing Life Is As Easy As ABC’s. He quotes “In life we all have a song to sing. Whatever song your life is singing make sure the melody is one of both peace and harmony. God will be pleased”."
