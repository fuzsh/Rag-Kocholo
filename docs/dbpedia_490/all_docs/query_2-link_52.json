        "text": "Date: July 29th, 2021\n\nVenue: Wolf Trap Filene Center\n\nVienna, VA\n\nGrab your dancing shoes and put on your Sunday best because we’re going to Church! It just so happens that this Church is a bit different though. What is normally known as Wolf Trap National Park for the Performing Arts, on this evening was transformed into the Church of The War and Treaty. For those not familiar, Wolf Trap Filene Center is a unique and beautiful venue located in Vienna, Virginia just outside of DC. 2021 marks the 50th anniversary of performances at this one-of-a-kind location. In fact, it’s the only National Park in America dedicated to the performing arts. It was my first time visiting and I was blown away by the sheer beauty and detail of the space. It’s certainly not your average stage in a park. In fact, this was one of the most state-of-the-art and cleanest venues I have ever been to, plus most of the staff were Park Rangers and local volunteers! How cool is that?! But like I mentioned, on this night, in particular, it was transformed into a (socially distanced) Church thanks to the power of The War and Treaty.\n\nThis power couple of Michael Trotter, Jr. and Tanya Blount Trotter, better known as The War and Treaty have been carving their names into the music industry as well as our hearts for years. I was ecstatic when I learned about this show and it was even cooler knowing that Tanya is from DC. To witness them on a stage like Wolf Trap was magical.\n\nBefore we get to the main event though, I want to talk a little about the band that kicked everything off. Just before the show begins Wolf Trap rings a bell that can be heard throughout the area, signaling guests to take their seats as the performance is about to begin. Then just a few minutes later over the speakers, we hear “Please welcome to the Wolf Trap stage, Conor and the Wild Hunt,” an Americana/Folk group led by Conor Brendan. They provided us with a 40-minute set that got our feet tapping with sounds that blended so well with the surrounding nature of the park. Among their songs were “Garden State” and a few new ones such as “No Plateau” which you can find on their upcoming record. Make sure to give them a follow and stay tuned for updates.\n\nShortly after, it was time for the service to officially begin. The band walked out, took their places, and shortly after Michael and Tanya came out to the sounds of “Hi Ho,” immediately set the tone right as the tambourine and their energy made the urge to dance too strong to resist. Then they ramped it up by giving us “Bare Knuckles” a song that just makes you want to groove and sing along, even taking the time to hit us with some classic covers like “Ain’t Too Proud To Beg” and “Respect” made all the better by Tanya and Michael’s voices as well as their shared chemistry.\n\nThen we got to hear a little bit of new music as Michael mentioned that they (mainly him, but she was his inspiration) had been writing a lot during the pandemic, the result being songs such as “Half On A Heart” and “1989.” The latter was written as a result of a recent visit to Cleveland in which he took his wife and son to visit a park he used to go to as a kid only to discover the park is now gone. It reflects on his childhood as he would also ride around with his family in their 1989 Lincoln Towncar Signature Series while his mom would sing “Glory Glory.” As the song came to an end, his mama appeared on stage to perform that same song acapella allowing us all to go on a journey through time with him.\n\nEarlier in the night Tanya had asked “Are You Ready to Love Me?” as if we weren’t already in love with her soulful and powerful vocals that also shine bright, much like the moon and as heard in “Hey Pretty Moon” off their new album ‘Hearts Town.’ The growl at the end and pure talent and emotion she brings to songs like that are unmatched.\n\nBefore the night came to an end they took us to New Orleans with the sounds of “Jeep Cherokee Laredo” which was accented by the horn section which had played behind legends like Aretha Franklin which made for a special show moment. Not to mention that the gentleman on trombones was also Tanya’s 8th-grade band teacher. How’s that for a full circle moment? In addition to a horn section, they were also joined by Therron Fowler and the Baltimore Urban Inspiration Choir. Together they truly gave us the gospel with songs such as “Down By the Riverside” and a moving performance of “Amazing Grace” before also inviting Tanya’s brother on stage as they all sang their song “We Are One.”\n\nThey then kicked the energy into overdrive for the finale with “Down to the River” as they ran back and forth across the stage while hitting some crazy soulful notes. In place of an encore, both Michael and Tanya then made their way into the crowd and through the aisles saying hello to the fans and much of their own family that had joined them to witness this memorable night of music.\n\nTheir show is one that from the moment they start until the very end you get this overwhelming feeling of joy, belonging, and like you’re just being given the biggest and best hug all throughout. From your favorite Photographic Ginger, this was certainly a night of music that I won’t soon forget and it’s a show you don’t want to miss. The War and Treaty will be touring across the US for the remainder of the year so make sure to check out when they’ll be near you and get your tickets now!\n\nIf you happened to capture any shots of the night, feel free to tag us on social media at Shutter 16 Magazine and throw in #Shutter16 and #TwitFromThePit for the world to see."
