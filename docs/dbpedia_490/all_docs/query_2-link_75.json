        "text": "Things keep moving — and in a good way — for the War and Treaty.\n\nLast year the married duo of Michael Trotter Jr. and Tanya Blount-Trotter, which hails from Albion, Mich., won critical raves for their first national label album, “Healing Tide.” The success led to an even bigger recording contract, with Rounder Records, along with a recent “CBS Sunday Morning” profile and plenty of tour opportunities, both on its own and with artists such as Al Green, Brandi Carlile and Jason Isbell.\n\nBut, as its fans know, the real victory is getting a chance to hear the War and Treaty, either on record or in one of its roof-raising (even when they’re outside) live shows…\n\n* Blount-Trotter says she and her husband, a U.S. Army veteran who’s been open about his struggles with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, have been both pleased and surprised with the upward trajectory of their career so far. “We could never have predicted any of this would happen. One person leads to another person. When we put out that (first) record in Albion, we could not have planned this or think it would go this way. But it’s awesome. It’s incredible what has happened and how everyone has just embraced us. It’s been absolutely mind-blowing.”\n\n* While “Healing Tide” got the duo — now based in Nashville — plenty of attention, Blount-Trotter expects the new Rounder deal will only elevate things further. “We’re excited to be on a lab el with such a great history and so many great artists on it. It’s a family label that’s really supportive and just really, really behind us. The first two records we put out we kind of did our own thing; ‘Healing Tide’ was distributed (national) but we didn’t have a label in place with the kind of support we needed for that project. So it will be great to get with a fully staffed label instead of just doing it ourselves.”\n\n* The War and Treat is looking an early 2020 release for its next album, according to Blount-Trotter. “We go into the studio in October and we have about 150 songs — Michael wrote most of them, I probably wrote two. (laughs) It’s a combination of a lot of different styles, kind of like ‘Healing Tide’ but a little more involved. We’ve infused more rock into our sound — still with a lot of soul, but a lot of rock, too. It’s big. We’ve been testing some of the songs out on our fans at different festivals we’re doing this summer and a lot of people called it kind of a stadium sound.” Trotter will be producing the album, though a “big name” guest producer is in discussion for one of the tracks.\n\n* The War and Treaty has also added horns to its lineup this year, which Blount-Trotter says “go in and out” of the performances. “We have a violinist who comes out on the road as well for some of the songs. We’ve kept that kind of roots foundation to what we do, but just expanded things a little more.”\n\n* Among this year’s highlights was touring with Al Green, an acknowledged hero who also has Michigan ties. “It was amazing,” Blount-Trotter says, “to sit on the side of the stage and literally watch history every night and what him do what he’s done for the last four or five decades. And for them to still be excited about the music and about him was just an incredible experience to watch. That’s magic.”"
