        "text": "Tracee Jahlees Marie Blount was born in Long Branch, NJ on September 18, 1984, and raised in Long Branch. She was born to Zell Blount and Carlos Polson. She departed this life on August 14, 2023, due to a car accident.\n\nTracee attended Long Branch High School and moved to Tinton Falls, NJ two and a half years ago. After she received her High School Diploma, she began attending Brookdale Community College in 2019, where she majored in Communication. She wanted to one day own a radio station but fell in love with Audio/Production and was to begin another year in September to complete that aspect of her interests. She always talked of moving to California to follow her dream after completing college. She worked at various jobs but really enjoyed driving a cab, number 8. Tracee was also an excellent player in pool and played on many teams with which she came home with numerous trophies. She carried her pool stick everywhere she went to get a couple games in wherever she ended up while going out. And yes, she won against many she played. Tracee was involved with Angela Traymon’s “Rysean’s Awareness” program each year working faithfully with the children’s activities. Tracee was a true hustler. If she could make extra money, she was always coming up with ideas to do so and you can best believe she did!\n\nShe loved all kinds of music, with Reggae being her favorite. Tracee had such a warm spirit and a beautiful heart. Her smile, laughter, and her presence lit up any room she entered, and she will forever be in our hearts always!\n\nHer family was everything to her and no one, I mean no one could ever say or do anything to anyone of them without her coming to their defense at any time. She was their crazy Aunt you could always call if they had a problem. She always had a nickname for family members and, some of her friends.\n\nTracee leaves to mourn her passing her mother Zell Blount, Long Branch, NJ; father Carlos Polson, Costa Rica; paternal grandmother Zoila Bailey, GA; aunts Shirlene Blount, NC, Lynn Blount, MA; and Carmen Salahuddin, GA; her siblings/half siblings Daethyn Blount, Sr., Long Branch, NJ, Christopher Blount (Meredith), Piscataway, NJ, and Heather Leak, VA, Bakim Winn, Asbury Park, NJ; Shahid Collins, Toms River, NJ, and Lydia Bynum, TX; nieces and nephews Ivelexa Feliciano, Long Branch, NJ, Daedra Blount, TN, Anthony Keane, NC, Ni-Daeya Blount, GA, Daethyn Blount Jr, Long Branch, Marcus Womack, Neptune, Daeyona Blount, GA, Devyn Blount, Neptune, Jaden Blount, Piscataway, Dilyn Blount, Neptune, Elias Blount, Piscataway, Stephon Leak, VA, Chase Blount, Piscataway, and Mason Ingram, VA; her grand nieces and nephews Amir Keane, Nova Davis, Carter Blount, Phoenix Parrish, Camryn Blount, Legacy Jones, Makenzie Boyd, Cevyn Blount, whom she loved dearly. She would take them to the park, pool, carnivals, arcade whenever they would visit. Messiah Miller who will be born on Tracee’s birthday September 18, 2023, would have been the light of her life along with his big brother Legacy, her heart; her close cousins Tanya Blount, Eljay Blount III, Jerry Watson, Andre Watson, Hasan Salahuddin, and a host of many loving great aunts, uncle, cousins, and many, many close friends; her Godmother, Sonya Range; her God-sisters, Nikki Morris, Pauline Williams, Lorinda Williams, Jhamena Range, Desha Grace, and Deaneira Thompson; her God-brothers Preston Whitfield, Jr., and Ricky McElroy."
