        "text": "Stacy Lattisaw Jackson (née Lattisaw; born November 25, 1966) is an American R&B singer from Washington, D.C., United States.\n\nCareer\n\nThe 1979 song \"Ring My Bell\" was originally written for then twelve-year-old Lattisaw, as a teenybopper song about kids talking on the telephone. When Lattisaw signed with a different label, Anita Ward was asked to sing it instead, and it became Ward's only major hit.\n\nLattisaw recorded her first album for Cotillion Records at the age of 12 in 1979, under the direction of record producer Van McCoy. However, it was not until she affiliated with Narada Michael Walden, a former drummer with the Mahavishnu Orchestra who was just beginning a career as a producer, that she found larger success. Under Walden's direction, she scored several R&B hit albums between 1981 and 1986. She also opened for the Jacksons' Triumph Tour in 1981.\n\nDuring the 1980s and early 1990s, Lattisaw had several US R&B hit singles, and a 1980 top 3 hit in the UK with her song \"Jump to the Beat\". She also scored three moderate hits on the US Hot 100 chart; \"Let Me Be Your Angel\" (US No. 21), \"Love on a Two-Way Street\" (US No. 26), and \"Miracles\" (US No. 40). She signed with Motown Records in 1986. She scored her only No. 1 R&B hit with duet partner Johnny Gill, titled \"Where Do We Go from Here\", in 1989. She retired from pop music in 1990 to concentrate on raising her family, although has performed gospel music in the years since. Lattisaw's last recorded appearance in secular music was singing background vocals on the Tanya Blount 1994 single, \"Through the Rain\". In 2010, Lattisaw's music career was chronicled on the TV One docu-series Unsung, in which she also appeared.\n\nDiscography\n\nStudio albums\n\nYear Album Peak chart positions Record label US\n\nUS\n\nR&B\n\n1979 Young and in Love — — Cotillion 1980 Let Me Be Your Angel 44 9 1981 With You 46 8 1982 Sneakin' Out 55 11 1983 Sixteen 160 26 1984 Perfect Combination (with Johnny Gill) 139 27 1985 I'm Not the Same Girl — — 1986 Take Me All the Way 131 36 Motown 1988 Personal Attention 153 24 1989 What You Need — 16 \"—\" denotes the album failed to chart\n\nCompilation albums\n\nThe Very Best of Stacy Lattisaw (1998, Rhino)\n\nStacey Lattisaw - The Cotillion Years 1979 - 1985 (2021, Robinsongs)\n\nSingles\n\nYear Title Peak chart positions Album US\n\nUS\n\nR&B\n\nUS\n\nDan\n\nUS\n\nA/C\n\nUK\n\nIRL\n\n1979 \"When You're Young and in Love\" — 91 — — — — Young and in Love 1980 \"Dynamite!\" — 8 1 — 51 — Let Me Be Your Angel \"Jump to the Beat\" — — — 3 11 \"Let Me Be Your Angel\" 21 8 — 34 — — 1981 \"Love on a Two Way Street\" 26 2 — 19 — — With You \"It Was So Easy\" — 61 — — — — \"Feel My Love Tonight\" — 71 36 — — — 1982 \"Don't Throw It All Away\" 101 9 — — — — Sneakin' Out \"Attack of the Name Game\" 70 14 — — — — \"Hey There Lonely Boy\" 108 71 — — — — 1983 \"Miracles\" 40 13 — — — — Sixteen \"Million Dollar Babe\" — 52 — — — — 1984 \"Perfect Combination\" (with Johnny Gill) 75 10 — — — — Perfect Combination \"Baby It's You\" (with Johnny Gill) 102 37 — — — — \"Block Party\" (with Johnny Gill) — 63 48 — — — 1985 \"I'm Not the Same Girl\" — 52 — — — — I'm Not the Same Girl \"He's Just Not You\" — — — — — — \"Can't Stop Thinking About You\" — — — — — — 1986 \"Nail It to the Wall\" 48 4 2 — 76 — Take Me All the Way 1987 \"Jump into My Life\" — 13 3 — 79 — \"Every Drop of Your Love\" — 8 — — — — Personal Attention 1988 \"Let Me Take You Down\" — 11 — — — — \"Call Me\" — 80 — — — — 1989 \"What You Need\" — 30 — — — — What You Need \"Where Do We Go from Here\" (featuring Johnny Gill) — 1 20 — — — \"Dance for You\" (featuring Johnny Gill) — — — — — — 1990 \"I Don't Have the Heart\" — — — — — — \"—\" denotes the single failed to chart\n\nSee also\n\nIn Spanish: Stacy Lattisaw para niños"
