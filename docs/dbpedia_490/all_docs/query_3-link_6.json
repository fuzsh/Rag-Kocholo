        "text": "In this second installment of Hallowed Sound, journalists from the USA TODAY Network examine the state of race in country music, scour the South in search of untold stories and shine a light on a new, eclectic generation of Black artists.\n\nRissi Palmer is a country artist, podcast host and advocate based in Durham, North Carolina. Last year, she launched “Color Me Country Radio” on Apple Music Country. The Color Me Country Artist Grant, which Palmer co-founded, has raised funds for dozens of marginalized artists and aspiring creative leaders in the genre.\n\nDURHAM, N.C. — Who knew 22 years ago when I began this musical journey that I was making a political statement by just being an 18-year-old Black girl from St. Louis?\n\nAt the time, I didn’t see it that way.\n\nMy story begins like so many. I dreamed of singing on big stages and hearing my music played on the radio. My family listened to Patsy Cline and Aretha Franklin with equal fervor. My first managers, also Black women, encouraged me to pursue my dreams of country music stardom in spite of not seeing myself reflected in the genre's artists.\n\nI moved to Nashville in 2000, singing at Tootsies until wee hours of the morning and playing writers’ rounds at the Bluebird Café. I endured rejection, which made me appreciate the big “yes” moments even more.\n\nAnd when I arrived in Nashville, no one was talking about race openly. I was told to keep my head down and let my work speak for itself, so I did.\n\nBut that didn’t keep it from coming up. I smiled and brushed off microaggressions on a regular basis (there was once a meeting at my record label about my hair being too much like an afro). I was told radio gatekeepers firmly said they wouldn’t play my music because of the color of my skin.\n\nMy work paid off in 2008, when I fulfilled a lifelong dream of playing the Grand Ole Opry. I became the first Black woman in 20 years to appear on the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart. Unfortunately, disputes with my record label brought my career to a screeching halt. I left Nashville in 2010. I felt largely abandoned by the industry, like an experiment that failed.\n\nDo I believe race is why I didn’t reach the level of stardom I’d hoped for? No. Do I believe that I faced hardships that my peers didn’t because of race? Yes, absolutely.\n\nIn 2019, race questions resurfaced, thanks to a certain rapper on an “Old Town Road.” Articles were being published by Black and white writers who didn’t seem to want to look deeper than Charley Pride, Darius Rucker, Mickey Guyton, Jimmie Allen and Kane Brown for the Black, Indigenous and people of color (BIPOC) contributions to country music.\n\nI understood them forgetting me, but how could you forget Linda Martell? DeFord Bailey? Lesley Riddle? Ruby Falls? Miko Marks? And the Black Country Music Association? I could go on and on.\n\nLast year marked five decades since the debut album of Martell — the first Black woman to play the Grand Ole Opry. Her album, “Color Me Country,” was the foundation on which all women of color in country have built their careers. She’s still the highest-charting Black woman in country history.\n\nI knew there were more stories that deserved to be told and preserved. With the encouragement of my friend Shellie R. Warren, I began doing interviews for what would become “Color Me Country Radio.”\n\nMy friend Kelly McCartney brought the show to the attention of Apple Music Country, starting this wild ride. “Color Me Country Radio with Rissi Palmer” debuted Aug. 30, 2020, with the mission of telling stories of Black, Latinx and Indigenous artists in country and Americana music. My life hasn’t been the same since.\n\nI had no idea that 2020 would also bring deaths of Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery and George Floyd. It broke an already cracked dam of race relations, causing us to take an unflinching look at institutions and how they have been affecting people of color, especially Black people.\n\nIt lit a fire under me. It was time to tell these stories, including my own, no matter how painful or ugly. And it was time for country music to see itself — complicated, omitted history and all.\n\nIn research for the show, I discovered so many artists with compelling stories. Artists like Sarge and Shirley West, who, as far as I know, were the first Black husband and wife country music duo. Contemporaries of Pride and Martell, they wrote with Tom T. Hall and toured the South in the Civil Rights era with a white band, playing regional oprys. Their music and lives were unknown to me, but thanks to an old Billboard Magazine, their son Joe West and his beautiful documentary about their lives, “A Song Can Change a Life,” I was soon a fan. Their episode was the first time some of their music had been heard since the 1960s.\n\nStories like the Wests' are precisely why “Color Me Country Radio” exists. This year has shown me the power of just simply acknowledging someone. It can change the trajectory of someone’s life.\n\nI also found inspiration in Cleve Francis, a Black cardiologist-turned-country singer signed for a time to Capitol Nashville; and Frankie Staton, a singer-songwriter with an unsinkable spirit. Together, they created the Black Country Music Association. When the industry appeared to turn a blind eye to them, they built their own table, providing artist development through songwriting seminars and showcases for industry tastemakers. Their ingenuity and resilience moved the needle. If they had finances to back up their vision, who knows what else they could have achieved?\n\nAs we pass the one-year anniversary of the show, I’m blown away by the victories and course corrections that have happened: Martell being honored with the Equal Play Award from CMT; the inclusion of six Black women in CMT Next Women of Country; Guyton’s release of “Black Like Me” — a song I never could have imagined being written in Nashville, let alone released — and her subsequent Grammy nomination, activism and career upswing; the influx of BIPOC artists into country music; panels and discussions on race; and the unexpected inclusion of my show in the Country Music Hall of Fame’s “American Currents” exhibit.\n\nOn the outside, this may look like problems being solved. However, the work has just begun.\n\nIt’s not enough for there to be a “vocal minority” fighting for change. This effort takes everyone. I’ve watched as a few artists found their voices this year, including myself, and used them to speak up about inequities, biases and injustices in Nashville. To those who have said nothing: It’s not OK to rely on the work of a few.\n\nEvery effective movement in our history happened because there was a belief that all concerned parties were moving as one. The same rule applies here. If you want to be seen as a change agent, then be a change agent. Start with your circle. Who are you employing? Who are you writing with? How are you looking out for those coming behind you? Are your statements or actions hindering those trying to do the work? If you aren’t concerned with those answers, then step out of the way of those who are. Martin Luther King Jr. said, “A social movement that only moves people is merely a revolt. A movement that changes both people and institutions is a revolution.”\n\nWhat the industry needs is a revolution, not a revolt. It’s not enough to see diversity onstage. It needs to permeate at every level.\n\nAnd the biggest observation I’ve made is a toxic culture in fandom. I watched Rachel Berry — a Black elementary school teacher and country music fan — in 2020 talk about how much she loved country music but felt unwelcomed at shows. There was a subsequent outpouring of support from fans and artists only to see in February 2021, Morgan Wallen’s sales skyrocketed after he was caught using a racist slur as a “playful” term for a friend.\n\nFor me, the hurtful part wasn’t the slur. It was reaction from fans and some industry insiders. I have screenshots of people calling me everything but a child of God for saying it was wrong. They tell us to get over it because “it’s no big deal” and “Black people use it all the time.” The hate is downright demoralizing.\n\nThere have been days when I wonder if the work is worth it. It seems to be a disease of the heart that plagues the whole country, not just country music.\n\nIn moments of sadness and mental exhaustion, I think about the good. Initiatives that the Academy of Country Music, Change the Conversation and Nashville Music Equality are taking; the diverse artists I’ve seen take the Opry stage this year; the amazing work of writers like Andrea Williams, Amanda Martinez, Marcus Dowling, Holly G., and so many others who examine hard truths and ask hard questions; the presence of websites and podcasts like The Black Opry and Also Pod, and the long overdue inclusion of Ray Charles in the Country Music Hall of Fame.\n\nI think about the Color Me Country Artist Grant fund that McCartney and I started this year with the Black Country Music Association in mind. It has given more than 50 BIPOC artists grants to pursue country music dreams; and I think about the allies that helped make it possible — Brandi Carlile’s Looking Out Foundation, Fiona Prine, Donald Cohen and CMT, among others. Race should never be the reason someone can’t pursue their dreams, and neither should money.\n\nThis chapter of my life and career is my love letter to every artist whose names we’ll never know or who are pushed to the margins of history. To every Black or brown child that ever had a dream, only to be told they can’t or shouldn’t aspire to it because of the color of their skin.\n\nIt’s also a love letter to country music, from someone who believes that music built on “three chords and the truth” should include everyone’s truth.\n\nHallowed Sound, Vol. 2"
