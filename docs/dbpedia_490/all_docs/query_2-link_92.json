        "text": "When two artists join forces to form a duo it may seem like an easy leap with a lot of potential musical upside — two heads being better than one — but logistically and financially it has serious implications that the COVID-19 crisis is making even more complicated: Double the need for revenue, double the risk of exposure to the virus, and double the travel constraints. We spoke with three established touring duos and asked how they’re making it through 2020 now that conventional touring is no longer an option.\n\nPenny and Sparrow, Americana twosome out of Austin, Texas, were on a hot streak. They released their acclaimed album Finch in 2019, followed by a national headlining tour that was set to finish up in Spring of 2020. When the pandemic hit the U.S. in March those shows were postponed to August, but by June they’d been cancelled. Like so many artists, Penny and Sparrow are not banking on their touring coming back any time soon, so they’re pivoting.\n\n“We’re creating a s***ton of music,” member Andy Baxter tells me from his home in Florence, AL. “Every day I’m working on the next record with Kyle...” But what makes this even more complicated is that Andy and his bandmate, Kyle Jahnke, live in different states. With immunocompromised family members in close proximity, they’re holding off on any travel for now, instead finding their creative flow through home studios, transferring recordings over the internet, and banking their art for future release. “Kyle and I have more reverted back to a mental state that’s like: ‘let’s just pretend that we never get to tour again. How would we make music?’”\n\nOn August 7th, Penny and Sparrow released their first project during quarantine: a double album, Live From Texas, recorded at their hometown show last year in Austin — doubling down on an old-school model of delivering music to fans. When asked if the duo has considered a nascent subscription model like Patreon, they admit that they talk about it often, but haven’t yet agreed on a vision that suits them. Or as Andy says, “I don’t feel like we’ve figured out how to dance with that partner yet.”\n\nThe sister duo Larkin Poe is an indie powerhouse in the rock and blues scene. Rebecca and Megan Lovell grew up playing music together since they were kids and it looked like 2020 was going to be a milestone year. It kicked off at the Grammy’s in January with their lauded release Venom & Faith being nominated for Best Contemporary Blues Album. And with a new album, Self-Made Man, about to come out, they hit the ground running with a full schedule of international shows, festivals and headlining dates. They made it to the Mahindra Blues Festival in Mumbai, India before the pandemic hit, forcing them to return home.\n\n“This was going to be our first ever ‘tour bus tour,’” says Rebecca. To anyone who might believe the “Almost Famous” version of musician life, being on a bus might seem like a given, but for artists trying to run a self-sufficient touring business, it can take many years to move from car to van to bus. Finally being able to afford an upgrade to travel accommodations and production specs are big feats that few independent artists ever achieve. “We’ve never been able to tour on a bus, and I think all of us were looking forward to that experience.”\n\n“This is not something that fans realize, but for many bands you tour at a deficit for years and years and by hook or by crook you keep going until you’re able to build up enough of a cachet to then start to fix the situation in ways so that you don’t go into the red — with the meet-and-greets and the merch and the alternate forms and diversifications of how you’re bringing in income. I think this is the same for any band that is making music left of center: you tour for years and years and then you finally start to make a little bit of cash and you’re like, ‘Yay, we can finally upgrade the show!’ Bring in a front of house engineer and finally deliver a consistent thing that we’re really proud of. But it makes it that much more difficult to hit a year like 2020 where you do have this massive expectation of the show you’re finally going to be able to give people and then to have to re-assess and be like, actually, you may need to throw all of this new sense of luxury out the window and really take it back to a different model of touring.”\n\nBut despite the disappointment and seemingly stifled momentum, Larkin Poe have set the bar high for how artists can translate their shows online. At the start of quarantine the duo partnered with VIP company VEEPS, and launched a series of live-streams to fans around the world. Their new album debuted in July and topped the charts as the #1 Blues album on Billboard. And to keep the energy going virtually, last week they announced a new multi-cam live-stream concert filmed in studio with partner Real Music TV.\n\n“We feel very lucky that we have this other facet to our career, which is the online presence,” says Megan. It’s a community the sisters have built through years of releasing free songs and covers on YouTube and social media — generating goodwill and love from fans — and it’s likely responsible for the continued success the band is seeing now despite tour cancellations. “Giving back to people goes a really long way in them wanting to step up and support you as artists,” Rebecca says.\n\nSoulful, joyful and bluesy duo The War and Treaty started 2020 by giving a knockout performance on the Grammys in January, and with opening tours for Jason Isbell and John Legend scheduled throughout the year, 2020 looked very promising. But in March things took a scary turn for the married musical pair when Tanya Blount-Trotter got sick after the Love Rocks benefit concert in New York City. She later tested positive for COVID-19. “Everything went to a halt and got cancelled.” says her husband and bandmate Michael Trotter Jr. “She got very ill and it was hard to stay away, so I did not. I stayed right by her side the entire time.” Thankfully Michael never showed symptoms or illness for the two months that Tanya battled the virus.\n\nAs Tanya was recovering, the duo got innovative and leaned on their teammates to get through the financial losses. “My wife, Tanya, is brilliant.” Says Michael. “She launched a t-shirt line in the vintage pinup community and we’ve been selling more merch than we ever have. We’ve also landed a couple of syncs with a Quicken Loans COVID commercial. I think for artists it’s very important for business teams and managers to actively go work now. You gotta get out there and get your hands dirty and look for those opportunities.”\n\nIn June, the video of George Floyd’s murder spread across the country, motivating world-wide marches and protests for police reform and an end to racial injustice. Putting their own fiscal needs aside, The War And Treaty took action and made art for the movement. They recorded and released a unifying anthem called We Are One and started selling a We Are One T-Shirt with proceeds of both going to the American Civil Liberties Union. “An artist's duty, as far as I'm concerned, is to reflect the times.” These are the wise words of treasured American singer/songwriter, musician, and activist Nina Simone. Surely, The War And Treaty are showing what it means to be artists in 2020.\n\n“For me, being a veteran, and a war veteran at that — having a heart for this country, gladly walking around wounded still — nothing wounds more than racism. We must search within ourselves; have some uncomfortable conversations, but still remember that we are all human beings on God’s green earth and that we have to work together for the common good. And you don’t get that through legislation. You don’t get that through mandates. You don’t get that through dictatorships. You get that through hearts.”\n\nLike The War And Treaty’s gospel-hued music, there is a spiritual pulse as he speaks to this year of revolution.\n\n“What I advise is for us to start right where we stand and realize that history belongs to us. It’s now our time. This is my time to speak. This is my time to say what will be allowed and what will not be allowed. Hate can’t live here. And we have to start by looking at each other face to face and saying that we want to fix this.”\n\n“We have not gone morally bankrupt in this fight. We are not tired. We are not defeated. We are not hopeless. We are very hopeful. And as long as there’s breath in our bodies, Tanya and I will always remain hopeful to believe we can come together as one.”\n\nAnd with that, Michael Trotter Jr., who has seen his wife through a two-month long recovery from Covid-19, weathered their career as a musical duo in upheaval, and witnessed the country he went to war for rife with tension and violence, delivers a power punch of optimism that has us looking to The War And Treaty and all the artists of the world for how to get through 2020 and maybe even be better for it."
