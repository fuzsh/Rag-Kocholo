        "text": "Today is another ‚ÄúWordless Wednesday.‚Äù My friend, Barbara Resch Marincel, is a sister blogger, an insightful writer, and a photographer extraordinaire. You can see one of her amazing works in the image on this post. The image reminds me of a dark time that is slowly changing with the glow of new light. And in that light, the flying birds speak to me of the wind of the Spirit. Barbara‚Äôs images are a gift to me, always bringing up a range of emotions.\n\nHere is a bit of how she describes herself on her blog, lifeisgrace.blog.\n\nBlogger, writer, photographer, in varying order. Finding the grace in the everyday‚Äîand the not so everyday, while living a full and creative life despite chronic pain and depression.\n\nIf you take a few moments of your day to visit Barbara‚Äôs blog, you will find enchantingly stunning photography that speaks of joy, pain, life and grace.\n\nBack to ‚ÄúWordless Wednesday.‚Äù So many reasons to be wordless. Some people may not have adequate words to express joy. Others cannot speak of deep sorrow. Some of us have no words because of pain, while others are wordless because they have fallen into the depths of depression.\n\nThere is no end to the reasons people are wordless, no end to the seasons in which they find they are without words. I have lived in that season many times, and in that place I could not speak of my pain because words were completely inadequate. I could not speak the pain out loud to any friend, and even for prayer, I had no words. Silence was my close companion.\n\nI love that my friend, Barbara, entitles her blog post ‚ÄúWordless Wednesday‚Äù every week, because in the middle of every week, she reminds me of my seasons without words. Her art is a reminder for me to give thanks that I survived those times, and celebrate that I am now on the other side of silence.\n\nBut will not forget that it is no small feat to get to the other side of silence. I must remember that it is not easy to endure silent, grief-filled times and to the other side of them. While living in my seasons of unspoken angst, one passage of Scripture brought me comfort and hope.\n\nThe Spirit helps us in our weakness; for we do not know how to pray as we ought, but that very Spirit intercedes with sighs too deep for words.\n\n‚Äî Romans 8:26 (NRSV)\n\nWhen grief has stolen our words, when we cannot speak and find ourselves in silence, may open our lives to hope, trusting the intercession of the Spirit‚Äôs sighs that are far deeper than words.\n\nThank you, my friend, for ‚ÄúWordless Wednesdays.‚Äù\n\nAnd thanks be to God for allowing me to move to the other side of silence.\n\nAmen.\n\nTo live without roads seemed one way not to get lost.\n\n‚Äî Naomi Shihab Nye\n\nIt might be good advice ‚Äî traveling a journey without roads. It would eliminate the decisions one must make when roads cross. It would eliminate the uncertainty when the path ahead seems unclear. We wouldn‚Äôt have to plot a course and explore all the possible routes. We might experience freedom on the journey that we have never before experienced.\n\nI have to admit, though, I am a person who is all about road metaphors for life. I am a lover of walking labyrinths and walking the sacred path. I am constantly assessing my journey by the many kinds of roads I travel. I rejoice on smooth, friendly roads and despair on rough, ominous roads. I walk my path with trust, experience courage and wise discernment at the crossroads, and believe that I will end my journey in hope.\n\nSo the idea of ‚Äúoff road‚Äù living is a new, and somewhat disconcerting, prospect. And yet I am intrigued by the quote of Naomi Shihab Nye, ‚ÄúTo live without roads seemed one way not to get lost.‚Äù\n\nSo I spent a few minutes pondering her words. With no roads, we might find ourselves discovering new places and making new paths, never fearing that we‚Äôre lost, but leaning into the exploration with anticipation. Without roads, we might wander aimlessly, passing beside astounding wonders we have not seen before. Without roads, we might find ourselves leaning into the beauty we find on our uncharted and circuitous path, beauty once hidden from us because we stayed on the road. Without roads, we might experience freedom on the journey.\n\nThe poet says that without roads, we don‚Äôt get lost. That may be a plus for us, since the fear of getting lost keeps us from the sheer, unbridled joy of exploration. Once we have dismissed that fear, we are free to roam, to discover and to observe all the beauty that lives off the path.\n\nI think Naomi Shihab Nye‚Äôs thought about the lack of roads is an interesting parable. Its a parable about real life, and the best lesson from it may be that it is our fear keeps us from the full and fresh experiences we could embrace. When we stick too close to the roads we have always travelled, we will experience only what exists on the roads and directly beside them, nothing more. But when we have thrown off the fear that holds us hostage, courageously take leave from our familiar path, and venture into the wilderness to wander freely, we might see and experience more than we ever thought possible.\n\nI‚Äôm not so sure this will work for me, but I plan to try some wandering that takes me far beyond my safe path. I plan to experience the emotion that comes from the fear of being lost. I plan to allow myself to be forced to place all my trust in where my heart takes me, and in God, who always gives grace to wanderers.\n\nSo the poet says I will not be lost, because there are no roads on my journey. I will not know what things I will see until they emerge before me. I may not know where I am, but I will not be lost.\n\nNaomi Shihab Nye wrote another poem that seems to speak to this very unfamiliar concept of traveling life‚Äôs journey without familiar paths to count on. These are her words:\n\nWhere we live in the world is never one place.\n\nOur hearts, those dogged mirrors,\n\nkeep flashing us moons before we are ready for them.\n\n‚Äï Naomi Shihab Nye\n\nWhat does it mean that our hearts ‚Äúkeep flashing us moons before we‚Äôre ready for them?‚Äù It sounds like a gift, that our hearts flash moons before us. It sounds like grace that, on our journey, we will see the wonder of God‚Äôs creation glowing above us in the night sky. We will be compelled to look up, gazing into a moon that changes constantly, reminding us of the waxing and waning of our lives and giving us hope to hold on to.\n\nThanks be to God for the freedom of the journey and the hope.\n\nI think often about roads, the roads that take people where they want to go, or not. I think with deep fondness about the terribly rough and broken roads we traveled in Uganda. The time was immediately after the horrific reign of Idi Amin that left the roads, and the entire country, in shambles. I remember the difficulty in traveling those rough, broken roads ‚Äî washed out, bombed out, neglected for years.\n\nI remember the fear of traveling those roads, the frightening military roadblocks, the pointed machine guns, the soldier‚Äôs demand for all that we carried in the vehicle and even the vehicle itself. I remember how some of our missionaries were left in the bush with their vehicle ‚Äúconfiscated‚Äù by the occupying army. I remember the roadblock murder of the dear Ugandan man who drove our mission‚Äôs supply truck.\n\nI think of traveling a road in the middle of the night that led to my brother‚Äôs funeral, made rough by grief. I think of the rough road I traveled in leaving my home of 32 years for a new and unfamiliar place. I can never forget my rough road through serious illness and difficult recovery.\n\nI think of roads that take people where they do not want to go ‚Äî to war, to prisons, to rehabilitation centers, to the sites of natural disasters. I think about the roads in disaster areas that are simply gone.\n\nI remember a song in a Christian musical of many years ago titled ‚ÄúRough Old Roads.‚Äù It told of the rough roads Jesus walked. The song‚Äôs climactic moment gave us these words: ‚Äúthe road that was roughest of all to walk was the road that led to the cross.‚Äù\n\nIt is appropriate for us during Lent to recall the rough roads Jesus walked, rough for so many reasons: rejection, danger, soul temptation, angry crowds and lynch mobs, and ultimately the rough road that Jesus walked to the cross, to his death. To learn of his roads means that we get a glimpse of our own. The roads we all walk.\n\nNone of us can avoid walking the rough and broken roads that appear before us, but it is in traversing those roads that we learn who we are. Rough roads force us to take the hard and narrow way, and thus become who we must ultimately become. Roads can wind around so that we are lost, thus inviting us to take the risk of vulnerability required for an unknown and uncharted journey. Our roads teach and challenge us. When the road ahead of us is rough or broken, our commitment to stay the course results in wisdom. I call it wisdom from the journey. Our rough, broken roads make us stronger and more resilient. The rougher they are, the more we change and grow.\n\nI could bore you with even more personal reflection about rough roads, but instead I want to share a moving poem written by Maren Tirabassi.* In the poem, she writes of broken roads and calls for a God who attends to all who find themselves on broken roads.\n\nHere are Maren‚Äôs moving words:\n\nI was praying this morning, God,\n\nfor all the people in Mozambique\n\nand Malawi and Zimbabwe,\n\nin the midst of the terrible losses\n\nfrom cyclone Idai ‚Äî\n\nthe deaths and injury and destruction,\n\nthe ongoing need for rescue\n\nand I learned that the roads are broken.\n\nI should have known ‚Äî\n\nthe roads between towns\n\nare impassable,\n\nthe bridges smashed, ports unusable.\n\nAlso those other paths ‚Äî\n\nelectricity, telephone, Internet,\n\nare gone as well.\n\nAnd I went from that\n\nflat-hand-on-the-newspaper prayer,\n\nto the jail and my meeting\n\nfor spiritual care\n\nand walked among others\n\nwith no access\n\nand realized that journey\n\nis not a parable for Lent\n\nfor these,\n\nyour children on the inside.\n\nAnd so holy Valley-uplifter,\n\nRough-place-leveler,\n\nI call you to attend\n\nto all who suffer broken roads ‚Äî\n\nbroken highways or heartways,\n\nor sometimes minds that cannot\n\nfind a way out of whatever\n\ndead end they are in,\n\nand teach me to pay attention, too,\n\nput my back against\n\nevery road block,\n\nbecome an opener of the way home.\n\nMay God make it so. Amen.\n\n*Maren served as a pastor in the United Church of Christ for thirty-seven years in Massachusetts and New Hampshire and is the author or editor of 20 books. You may read more of her creative and soulful writing at her blog, ‚ÄúGifts in Open Hands‚Äù at the following link:\n\nhttps://giftsinopenhands.wordpress.com/2019/03/21/10101/\n\nI was born and raised in the South and spent most of my life in the Bible Belt. In the Bible Belt, one can hear many sayings, expressions and idioms. One of the idioms I seemed to hear continually over the years was, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the Gospel truth!‚Äù Always as an exclamation.\n\nI learned that in life there is truth and there is Gospel truth. I learned that we need both. For instance, in my life at this moment, there is the truth that I am afraid. And there is also the Gospel truth that God watches over me through my fear.\n\nSitting on the cusp between daily dialysis and the possibility of a kidney transplant, I entertain varied thoughts and feel disparate emotions. One of them is definitely fear. Thankfully, I feel relatively well physically on most days, but my body never lets me forget that I‚Äôm sick. People who know say that a transplant would change my life, that I have become so used to being ill that I don‚Äôt know what feeling really well is like. I don‚Äôt know about that.\n\nWhat I do know is that the idea of a transplant is both frightening and enlivening. I also know that it may or may not happen. So I tamp down my emotions, tuck away my fear and basically try not to think about it. Where I am these days is in the place of; 1) not knowing and 2) knowing that God knows.\n\nAs I contemplated this today, I remembered a Gospel song I used to sing back in the day. I have not thought of the song in years, but today its melody ran through my mind over and over. Many well-known musicians have sung it, but the voice I remember most clearly is the voice of Mahalia Jackson.\n\nWhy should I feel discouraged, why should the shadows come,\n\nWhy should my heart be lonely, and long for heaven and home,\n\nWhen Jesus is my portion? My constant friend is He:\n\nHis eye is on the sparrow, and I know He watches me;\n\nHis eye is on the sparrow, and I know He watches me.\n\nI sing because I‚Äôm happy, I sing because I‚Äôm free,\n\nFor His eye is on the sparrow, and I know He watches me.\n\nWhenever I am tempted, whenever clouds arise,\n\nWhen songs give place to sighing, when hope within me dies,\n\nI draw still closer to Him, from care He sets me free;\n\nHis eye is on the sparrow, and I know He watches me . . .\n\nIn both Matthew and Luke, Jesus is sending his disciples out into the world. The Gospel of Matthew, chapter 10, begins with these words:\n\nJesus called his twelve disciples to him and gave them authority to drive out impure spirits and to heal every disease and sickness.\n\nIn the rest of the chapter, Matthew tells us that Jesus gives his disciples many instructions as he sends them out. Most importantly, he instructs them not to fear.\n\nAre not two sparrows sold for a penny? Yet not one of them will fall to the ground outside your Father‚Äôs care. And even the very hairs of your head are all numbered. So don‚Äôt be afraid; you are worth more than many sparrows. (Matthew10:29-31 NIV)\n\nTransplant or dialysis for the rest of my life? I don‚Äôt know which it will be, and that‚Äôs the Gospel truth! I do know that I am afraid, but whenever I fear the future, I am often reminded that I am never outside of God‚Äôs care. It is a good thing, an important thing, to know that to God, I am worth more than many sparrows. It‚Äôs the Gospel truth!\n\nI thought you might enjoy hearing a contemporary arrangement of ‚ÄúHis Eye Is on the Sparrow‚Äù performed by Lauryn Hill and Tanya Blount at this link: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=k7Pk5YMkEcg\n\nTucked away in my memory, there is a charming tale of a young boy. I‚Äôm not sure from where I remember the story, but I have known a few versions of it for many years. It‚Äôs one of my favorite parables. The story introduces us to young Peter, who grew up in a very poor family. Peter loved going to school and playing with his schoolmates.\n\nOn one particular school day, Peter noticed that his friends were laughing and chattering with excitement about the masquerade ball that was the yearly highlight of the town festival.\n\n‚ÄúI cannot wait for the ball,‚Äù Suzanne said excitedly. ‚ÄúI shall wear a beautiful costume of indigo silk, with a mask to match it.‚Äù\n\nWilliam said, ‚Äúl‚Äôm wearing red, a bright shiny red.‚Äù\n\nAnd Victoria gave every detail of the gown of purple velvet her mother was sewing.\n\nOne after another, the excited children described the colorful costumes their mothers would make for them ‚Äî green, purple, orange, yellow, pink, gold, silver. They told of the fine fabrics their fathers had purchased on their travels. Every mother had set aside the fabric for just this occasion.\n\nOne of the children noticed that Peter was not joining in on the gleeful conversation and walked up to him.\n\n‚ÄúPeter, what will you be wearing to the festival?‚Äù she asked.\n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôm not going to the festival,‚Äù Peter said, ‚ÄúI do not have fine clothes to wear and my family cannot buy cloth for a costume.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúBut you must come, Peter,‚Äù another friend said. And then others joined in.\n\nTheir mood changed from gladness to sadness, and since it was now a sad and somber time for Peter, he slowly started walking toward home.\n\nAfter he left, the children talked among themselves, wondering what they could do to help Peter get to the festival. William, who had been thinking through the dilemma, finally spoke out.\n\n‚ÄúI know! I don‚Äôt need so much cloth for my costume,‚Äù William said. ‚ÄúI can cut a small piece from my costume and give it to Peter. Perhaps his mother can sew it into something grand.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúYes! I can do that too,‚Äù said another. And then another, until all the children joined in. So they devised a plan to help Peter get to the festival ball.\n\nThe next day William arrived at school with a twinkle in his eye. In fact, all the children had twinkles in their eyes as they went to find Peter. Each friend brought to Peter a small scrap of cloth they had torn from their costumes. One after another, they gave Peter pieces of cloth of every shape and size. Small scraps snd larger pieces, blue, red, yellow and purple ‚Äî every color you could think of really.\n\nPeter was speechless, and if one looked closely, they might have seen a tear slide down his cheek. Peter took all the little pieces of cloth to his mother, who would take the scraps and do her magic with needle and thread.\n\nThe special day finally came, and the happy children arrived, each clothed in a bright, beautifully colored costume. When Peter arrived, no one recognized him at first, but there was a collective gasp in the room. He entered the room, tall and proud, wearing a black mask and a multi-colored, diamond patterned costume.\n\nWho was this person?\n\nIt was Peter, they finally realized, in amazement!\n\n‚ÄúLook at the beautiful red on his costume. It‚Äôs the same color as what I‚Äôm wearing!‚Äù\n\nAnother child said, ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs part of mine!‚Äù\n\nAnd each of Peter‚Äôs friends shrieked with happiness when they saw their own pieces of cloth cut into diamond shapes and sewn together on his costume. It was stunning ‚Äî from the gold brocade, to the shimmering red satin, to the verdant hue of the green taffeta, to the sparkle of the royal blue silk. All the children were happy about what they were wearing, but they were even happier about the small piece of cloth they had shared with Peter.\n\nPeter thanked them, having to speak very loudly to be heard over their happy exclamations.\n\n‚ÄúEveryone is happy tonight,‚Äù Peter said, ‚Äúbut I am the happiest one of all, because I am clothed in the love of my friends!‚Äù\n\nFrom that day forward, Peter‚Äôs friends called him ‚ÄúHarlequin.‚Äù And that‚Äôs the tale of how Harlequin came to be.\n\nSo what does this little tale have to do with anything. Last week, I happened to pick up a fluffy, white blanket that‚Äôs in our extra bedroom. I held it and remembered that my friend had brought it to me in the hospital when I was so sick. Her church had prayed over the blanket in a church service and sent it to me with love. I was in bed for a long time, and each time someone covered me with the blanket, I thought of the echoes of the prayers it held and the love of the friends who sent it to me. Like Harlequin, I was clothed in the love of my friends.\n\nAs I wait on a possible kidney transplant and wonder whether or not a transplant will be in my future, the one thing that comforts me is the love of my friends. The truth is that I am covered with an abundance of love. My friends from from all over the world are praying for me, breathing prayers for my well-being and my health, offering me ‚Äúcolorful pieces of fine cloth‚Äù in the whispered blessings they send to me.\n\nLast night, the depth of caring that friendship can offer became very clear to me when I received an incredible message from a friend of many years. The message was that he had begun the process of donating a kidney for me. Stunned by his announcement, emotions tender, I remembered all over again that I am clothed in the love of my friends.\n\nFor that, I am incredibly grateful.\n\nI have always thought of Lent as a spiritual journey we take alone, a solitary season of introspection and self-reflection during which we contemplate our own spiritual well-being and our relationship with God. For me, Lent has always been alone work. But what if it wasn‚Äôt? Suppose I experienced Lent with my community ‚Äî the close community of people with whom I share my spiritual life.\n\nI cannot help but recall the story of Jephthah‚Äôs daughter as told in Judges 11. When she faces a terrible crisis that will result in her death at the hands of her father, she makes only one request of her father. ‚ÄúDo what you must do, only grant me this one request: Give me two months to roam the hills and weep with my sisters.‚Äù\n\nSo she will take this journey up into the hills with her sisters ‚Äî to mourn, to reflect, to pray. She will not make this journey alone. She makes the journey with the sisters who surrounded her in life and now in death. They climb up into the hills together.\n\nLent‚Äôs forty days represent the time Jesus spent in the wilderness, enduring the temptation of Satan and preparing to begin his ministry. He was there alone, and most often the Lenten journey is a time for reflecting alone. But I think that perhaps there is spiritual benefit in making a Lenten journey together, in community, joining together through invisible rhythms of friendship and caring.\n\nAs I make my Lenten journey this year, in my mind I will take my community with me. There into my alone places where God comforts me in my contemplative moments, in my repentance and in my penitence, I will be more mindful this Lent of my spiritual circle of friends. I will make a covenant with them in my mind and heart. I will send them positive thoughts as they make their Lenten journey and I will pray for them intentionally and faithfully.\n\nIt will be a together Lent, inspired by the sisters who went into the hills with Jephthah‚Äôs daughter where they spent a season of grief in community, together.\n\nI hope that, together, we might embrace a sense of community as one of our Lenten spiritual disciplines, that we might journey together for these forty days, praying for one another, seeking together the serenity, the reflection and the transformation of Lent.\n\nIn that spirit of prayer, I leave with you this beautiful prayer written by Rabbi Naomi Levy:\n\nThe rabbi in me would like to offer a prayer for you.\n\nI pray you will learn to see you life as a meaningful story.\n\nI pray you will learn to listen to your soul‚Äôs insistent yearning.\n\nI pray you will learn to believe you can transform your life.\n\nI pray you will learn to live and shine inside your imperfect life\n\nand find meaning and joy right where you are.\n\nMost of all I pray you will uncover a great miracle: your extra-ordinary life.\n\n‚Äî From Hope Will Find You by Rabbi Naomi Levy\n\nYesterday was not my best day. All day long challenges got the best of me ‚Äî health challenges, schedule challenges, even bad haircut challenges. My sister of the heart, Donna, said I was cranky. My husband, Fred, said I should chalk it up to Ash Wednesday. Martie, my dear Little Rock friend, said that yesterday was the first day of Mercury in retrograde and that I should do my best to survive until it‚Äôs over on March 28th.\n\nI‚Äôm not so convinced of any of those explanations, but I‚Äôll let it be for now. Today is a new day, a day in which I have chosen peace for the beginning of my Lenten journey. Typically, the way I find peace is through music. So Pandora is on my sacred music station today. It would be an understatement to say that the music has lifted me today and has almost made yesterday‚Äôs fiascoes a dim memory.\n\nAs I listened, a song from my past brought sweet memories. Years ago, before I learned to renounce masculine pronouns to refer to God, I was inspired greatly by these words: ‚ÄúBecause He lives, I can face tomorrow.‚Äù We sang this Gospel song often to remind us of hope, of perseverance, of God‚Äôs faithfulness and of Christ‚Äôs resurrection. Today, those words and that melody on Pandora reminded me of those exact things. In spite of masculine pronoun referring to God, the music moved me as it has always done. The message has not changed. God has not changed. My faith in Christ has not changed. Thanks be to God!\n\nHere‚Äôs my truth as I follow my Lenten path, the abiding truth: ‚ÄúTomorrow‚Äù for me seems murky, with the path ahead unknown and somewhat disconcerting. I do not know if I will receive a kidney transplant or live on daily dialysis for the rest of my life. I do not know what tomorrow promises.\n\nBut this is as it has always been ‚Äî before illness and after. I never knew what tomorrow would bring, even in those days when I thought I was fearlessly and fully in control of my life. So it feels like a Lenten testimony of my faith to say that I do not know what tomorrow looks like for me. Leaning into the reality of the unknown future, I feel embraced in the consoling truth that ‚Äúbecause He lives, I can face tomorrow.‚Äù\n\nOf this, I am confident. Resting on this promise, I can move onto the Lenten path before me with refreshed hope and renewed faith. Amen.\n\nDo you ever just get tired of tending to yourself? I suppose that‚Äôs not a relevant question for a general audience. It is, however, a very relevant question for those of us who are aging and/or have chronic illnesses.\n\nI am in those categories: aging and ill. My life changed, as many of you know, in 2014 when I was diagnosed with end stage renal disease. That means my choice was dialysis for the rest of my life, a kidney transplant, or the unmentionable alternative which, very honestly, is death. I am told that without either dialysis or transplant, a person would be looking at two weeks.\n\nSo I tend to myself with all the medications, the medical appointments, the processes, the prevention measures ‚Äî every day. Sometimes it feels like all day. Without a husband who is an indispensable care partner, I would be sunk. To be honest, my needs require both of us to be constantly attentive, and it is exhausting.\n\nStill, I tend to myself, and I do sometimes get tired of having to. But I tend to myself largely without complaint and with unspeakable joy for the grace of being alive, of enjoying my family, my grandchildren, my creative pursuits and my ‚Äúone wild and precious life‚Äù as poet Mary Oliver would call it.\n\nTending to myself is not just being sure to address my physical health needs. It is even more important to me to tend to my spiritual well-being. One of the things that means for me is choosing a spiritual path for my Lenten journey. I have just one day to choose. Today is Ash Wednesday, an important day for penitents. ‚ÄúFrom dust you have come and to dust you shall return‚Äù is Ash Wednesday‚Äôs message. And then we must begin our Lenten spiritual path.\n\nI have to be honest by admitting that I have not yet chosen my path. It won‚Äôt be giving up chocolate. It won‚Äôt be as much giving as it will be receiving grace on the journey. So as I have contemplated what I will do, I have gathered some resources that I will share here.\n\nI hope you will tend to yourself through your Lenten journey, and I pray that Lent‚Äôs forty days will find you walking your sacred path. Breathe deeply. Reflect on your life. Pay attention to your heart. Attend to your soul. Count your gifts. Speak your prayers. Consider Christ‚Äôs journey to the cross. Listen for God‚Äôs whisper. Receive the grace that comes to you.\n\nAll go to the same place; all come from dust, and to dust all return.\n\n‚Äî Ecclesiastes 3:20\n\nA FEW RESOURCES YOU MIGHT USE DURING LENT:\n\nFirst of all, I would like to share with you the joy of walking a labyrinth or using a finger labyrinth during the days of Lent.\n\nYou might find a labyrinth near you in a church, a park or at a spiritual retreat center. You can search at the labyrinth locator website listed below. You may also invest some creative time by making a finger labyrinth like the one pictured. Instructions are at a link below.\n\nWalking the labyrinth is a spiritual discipline that invites us to trust the path, to surrender to the many turns our lives take, and to walk through the confusion, the fear, the anger and the grief that we cannot avoid experiencing as we live our earthly lives. ‚Äî The Rev. Dr. Lauren Artress\n\nWalking the labyrinth clears the mind and gives insight into the spiritual journey. It is a form of walking meditation that can enhance and deepen awareness of God. Labyrinth prayer is a contemplative spiritual discipline on a simple marked path. It is based on the ancient practice of pilgrimage.\n\nOn a pilgrimage, a pilgrim intentionally (1) leaves the world, journeying away from the noise and distractions of life, (2) eventually arrives and rests with Christ, and (3) returns home to live more deeply in God‚Äôs presence.\n\nThe labyrinth invites us to release, receive and return. Walking the labyrinth is not a newfangled technique to jumpstart your spiritual life. It is a slow, quiet, meditative practice that has historically attended to the desire to make a journey toward God. Laid in the floor of Chartres Cathedral in France around 1220, the labyrinth has been used by pilgrims for centuries.\n\nWhen you experience the labyrinth, you must give yourself to the path, leaving behind the noise and hurry of life. Just as you would pack simply for a pilgrimage, you offer your load to God as you begin your prayer journey. You move slowly toward the center and toward God.\n\nAt times you are close to the center. Further along the path, you may be farther from the center. This represents the reality of the spiritual journey. As you walk the labyrinth, you can see the center, but you can‚Äôt see how exactly you will get there, Sometimes you find you are making surprising turns that seem to take you farther away, not closer. However, if you stay on the path, you will get to the center. Then, you will follow the path from the center and move ‚Äúinto the world‚Äù to do justice and love mercy. Labyrinths can be a walking meditation, a spiritual practice or simply an opportunity to calm the mind and enjoy peace, quiet and reflection.\n\nFor resources on the labyrinth, visit https://www.gracecathedral.org/our-labyrinths/\n\nTo find labyrinths, visit The Labyrinth Society‚Äôs website: https://labyrinthlocator.com\n\nFor instructions on making a finger labyrinth, visit https://heatherplett.com/2015/01/make-finger-labyrinth-also-piece-art/\n\nLent 2019: With All Your Heart\n\nThis resource includes readings that tell the story of Jesus‚Äô entry into Jerusalem, his passion, and resurrection. https://www.umcdiscipleship.org/worship/lent-2019-with-all-your-heart\n\nLiving Well Through Lent 2019:\n\nPracticing Forgiveness with All Your Heart, Soul, Strength, and Mind\n\nLiving Compass offers a daily email devotional throughout Lent.

It is simply what it says, a prayer each day throughout Lent. http://onlineministries.creighton.edu/CollaborativeMinistry/Lent/Daily-prayers-00.html\n\nAnd my personal favorite, LIFT EVERY VOICE\n\nLift Every Voice is a Lenten resource from 2016 that is still relevant in 2019. It addresses America‚Äôs original sin of racism through the lens of Ignatian spirituality and includes daily readings. From Ash Wednesday through Easter Sunday, voices from throughout the Ignatian network will lament racial injustice in our communities and reflect on how the Gospel calls us to repent, pray, and act in solidarity with those affected by an enduring legacy of systemic and personal racial discrimination. https://ignatiansolidarity.net/lent-2016/\n\nToday, a friend‚Äôs blog posed a provocative question. It was provocative enough to stop me in my tracks. Likely, I was right in the middle of a tirade of complaints when this question challenged me. This was the question: ‚ÄúIf I let go of my complaints, what might be underneath?‚Äù *\n\nThe question presented a plethora of thoughts for me. It opened up that place underneath just for a second. But then I quickly moved back to the complaints. I have many. Or at least I believe I have many reasons to complain. But I‚Äôm realizing that complaints are surface things. They live outside of us and do not always reflect the inner emotions we are truly feeling.\n\nA complaint develops easily and blurts out what‚Äôs on the surface of our lives. It flows easily off the tongue and falls upon any willing listener. The empathy we receive from that willing listener keeps the complaints alive. If someone listens to us and responds with caring about our complaint, it is then cemented. We have given it life, perhaps life beyond what it deserves.\n\nThis brings us back to the probing question: ‚ÄúIf I let go of my complaints, what might be underneath?‚Äù\n\nIf gratefulness for the obvious graces that we have received replaced the urge to complain, we would be surprised at the result. If, instead of lodging a complaint, we spent some time exploring what lives ‚Äúunderneath,‚Äù we might well gain true insight into our emotional state.\n\nSo we would do well to ask ourselves what‚Äôs underneath the complaint we speak out loud? Is it true that our complaint rises from a deep place inside of us but hides the emotion there?\n\nIf my complaint, for instance, is that I am overworked, perhaps underneath is the constant feeling that I‚Äôm being taken advantage of. If my complaint is that I have to endure an illness, perhaps the feeling underneath is that I fear suffering, even death. If I am terrified of death, perhaps I am not certain I left a good and lasting legacy. If I‚Äôm languishing in retirement, perhaps the emotion ‚Äúunderneath‚Äù is that, now that I am not ‚Äúministering,‚Äù I am questioning my self-worth.\n\nYou might be asking why this is important. It is important because whatever lives inside of us holds the power to harm us physically, emotionally and spiritually. What could we do instead of complaining?\n\nWe might begin with silence that moves us a bit towards serenity.\n\nNext, we will practice mindfulness that helps center us.\n\nWe woukd do well to contemplate gratitude for the graces of life.\n\nThen we should pray for insight, comfort and healing, not only praying for what we need from God, but also listening for God, abiding for a while in God‚Äôs presence.\n\nThen we must take time for what might be the most important practice of all: introspection and self-reflection.\n\nOne of the primary goals of introspection is to better comprehend our inward life and to learn to focus it towards fulfillment of self. To go there is to invite vulnerability, healthy vulnerability that softens the hard places inside me that are wounded. Then we need to pull up from our inner resources just a little bit of courage.\n\nWhen all is said and done, each of us is given a critical choice: do we complain about all that is not right? Or does courage enable us to look underneath our complaints and discover what our true emotions are?\n\nFor myself, I have to ponder these questions: What am I grieving? What have I lost? What do I fear? Underneath my whining and complaining (which I am very apt to do) I will find a gift, a treasure that is my very soul and spirit, and the emotions that abide there.\n\nAnd as a bonus, I will have found a better way to live my ‚Äúone wild and precious life.‚Äù **\n\n* From A Network of Grateful Living\n\n** From a poem by Mary Oliver."
