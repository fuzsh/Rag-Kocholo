        "text": "Sister Act 2: Back in the Habit recently celebrated its 30th anniversary and Tanya Trotter from The War & Treaty took a moment to reminisce about her role in the movie. That's right, Trotter was a part of the iconic '90s film, working alongside Whoopi Goldberg, Kathy Najimy and Lauryn Hill.\n\nThe Cast of Sister Act 2 Reunites to Sing \"Oh Happy Day\"\n\nThe cast was back together again three decades later for a special rendition of \"Oh Happy Day\" during a recent episode of The View. They recreated the same scene from the film with Goldberg once again donning her nun costume.\n\nTanya Trotter Talks About Being in the Movie Sister Act 2\n\nTrotter was just a teenager when she appeared in the Sister Act sequel and says the experience \"completely changed\" her life. She says reuniting with her \"SA2\" crew was more emotional than she expected and there were lots of tears that were shed.\n\n\"It was absolutely insane to see them,\" she says in a video describing the reunion \"Just tears and joy. I don't know if everybody felt that way but I felt like that 17-year-old girl again that walked into that studio.\"\n\nWho Did Tanya Trotter Play in Sister Act 2?\n\nFans will find Trotter listed in the cast playing a character who is also named Tanya. She is listed as Tanya Blount — her maiden name before marrying her husband and duo partner Michael Trotter in 2014. In addition to her acting, Trotter had the opportunity to show off her vocal chops. It's clear she has had a gift for singing for quite some time."
