        "text": "CLEVELAND, Ohio -- It’s a cliché that music brings people together, but as with many of the hoariest cliches, there’s truth in the oft-said phrase. Michael Trotter Jr. and Tanya Blount-Trotter, better known as The War & Treaty, are the living embodiment as both a married couple and as artists.\n\nThe War & Treaty will perform in the cozy Cambridge Room at House of Blues Cleveland on Sunday, April 23. Tickets are $23 and are available at Live Nation."
