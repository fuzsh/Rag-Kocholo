        "text": "NEW YORK (WABC) -- As millions take to the roads, skies and rails to travel ahead of Thanksgiving, a major storm is impacting conditions from the Midwest to New England.\n\nThe system impacts the Tri-State area through Wednesday afternoon.\n\nA Wind Advisory is now in effect for E. Suffolk County with gusts up to 50mph. Coastal flood advisories and statements are in effect for the entire coastline.\n\nWindswept heavy rain will amount to a widespread 1.5-2 inches.\n\nClouds will break for some sun later on Wednesday followed by a bright but brisk Thanksgiving.\n\nChilly air will have some staying power into early next week with perhaps a bit of rain Sunday night into early Monday\n\nACCUWEATHER: Check the 7-day forecast here\n\nParts of northern New England may see some snow from this system.\n\nMaine, Vermont and northern New Hampshire are expected to get 3 to 7 inches of snow between Tuesday night and Wednesday.\n\nIf you are traveling upstate, the Buffalo area could see some significant lake effect snows as well If bands of heavier snow develop, they can also have gusty winds associated with them and even localized near blizzard conditions.\n\nRELATED: Everything to know about the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade\n\nThanksgiving marks the start of the holiday travel season, and many still haven't shaken last December's nightmare before Christmas, when severe winter storms knocked out thousands of flights and left millions of passengers stranded.\n\nU.S. airlines as a whole have been better about stranding passengers. Through October, they canceled 38% fewer flights than during the same period in 2022. From June through August - when thunderstorms can snarl air traffic - the rate of cancellations fell 18% compared to 2022.\n\nEven still, consumer complaints about airline service have soared, according to the U.S. Department of Transportation. There have been so many complaints, the agency says, that it has only compiled figures through May.\n\nInformation from AccuWeather and ABC News\n\nMORE ACCUWEATHER RESOURCES\n\nCheck AccuTrack Radar\n\nAir Quality Tracker\n\nNWS Advisories, Watches and Warnings\n\nSchool closings and delays\n\nFor weather updates wherever you go, please download the AccuWeather app."
