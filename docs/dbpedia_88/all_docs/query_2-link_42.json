        "text": "SAGINAW, Mich. (WNEM) - A strong winter storm arrived Friday night bringing heavy snow, strong wind gusts, blowing snow, and whiteout conditions at times. First Alert Weather Day for Saturday continues due to the strength of this storm and the impacts associated with it. In the following forecast below, we’ll go over all of the details regarding wind speeds, timing, snow accumulations, and lasting impacts of this storm. In summary though, we want you take away from this that this will be a very serious, strong storm moving through making this one of the most important weather days we’ve had in some time across Mid-Michigan.\n\nAlerts & Closings\n\nPlease visit the Weather Alerts section of our website for more specific details on the alerts current for your county. Overnight most warning were dropped except for counties along US 127. Other warnings were switched to advisories. On that page, any updates from the National Weather Service will be updated for the TV5 viewing area.\n\nFor weekend events, please give our School Closings & Delays page a check for updates!\n\nWind Forecast:\n\nWaking up Saturday morning, the center of the storm will be passing over the lower peninsula. Like any low pressure system in the center the winds are the weakest and become stronger the further out from the storm. As the low’s center passes through winds will be around 30mph. Don’t get use to the lower wind gusts because the back side of the storm moves through Saturday bringing wind gusts back to 40mph or higher. The wind direction will also be different. Due to the storm’s placements, winds will now be out of the northwest. The new wind direction will cause lake effect for much of the upcoming forecast. The wind is going to be one of the primary concerns because of the potential for power outages. Already outages have been reported in the TV5 viewing area. At this point in the storm, temperatures will be cooler leading to fluffier snow, so the combination of that and the wind will continue blowing snow concerns and drifting in wide open areas.\n\nSnow Totals:\n\nAs the storm exits Saturday morning, the First Alert snowfall map will reach the end of the forecast period. Already some snow totals that have been received are 12″ in Gladwin as of 6am. Bad Axe reported 4″ Saturday morning.\n\nOur latest snow map will pick up Saturday at noon and will only include the snowfall potential from the lake effect that will develop on the backside of the storm. Lake effect snow bands are expected due to the strength of the winds riding over the water. Snow bands will be able to dump a lot of snow in a short period of time and drop visibilities for drivers. We are highlighting our southern tier of counties and across the thumb region for higher snow totals for the remainder of the weekend.\n\nFirst Alert Hour-By-Hour Timing:\n\nSnow on the backside of the storm will be fluffier, and snowfall rate will not be as high as Friday evening. Better coverage of snow over mid-Michigan is for the morning before the storm leaves. After the storm exits, lake effect snow will be scattered and causing snow bands across the lower peninsula. With the snow being fluffier and the strong winds, blowing snow and low visibilities are expected. Be cautious while traveling. Use the image of the Hour-By-Hour below as an approximation, and continually check radar using the TV5 First Alert Weather app.\n\nLasting Impacts:\n\nA cold shot of arctic air comes in behind this storm keeping highs in the teens and lows in the single digits. With power outages possible, have a way to heat your home safely or hook up your generator if you have one. DO NOT run a generator indoors, even in a garage, and follow all operating instructions from the manufacturer. Make sure you have blankets, non-perishable food, and water on-hand too. In some instances, you may need to travel to a warming center or a relatives house (as long as they have power). With the arctic air swooping in and continued on-and-off lake-effect snow showers behind the storm, it may take several days for power to be restored in some areas.\n\nWith temperatures cooling down, road salt will also start to become more ineffective at the end of the weekend. Roads are going to stay icy, if not even snow covered, for many in our area even into Sunday. In worst case scenarios, some roads may stay icy and snowy even into Monday and Tuesday of next week. Overall, it’s going to take a couple of days before most travel turns back to normal behind this storm.\n\nStay safe and stay with your First Alert Weather Team for the entirety of this storm for the latest and most accurate updates!\n\nFor the rest of the weekend, the artic air will remain in place. Air temperatures will hover in the teens while wind chills will be in the single digits. Overnight lows will be bitter cold sitting in the single digits, and even colder wind chills.\n\nLater on Sunday the lake effect will start to slowdown. Snow chances remain for the new week, but remain lower due to the lake effect activity."
