        "text": "Weather Type: Advisory Watch Warning Dense Fog A Dense Fog Advisory is issued when widespread fog is expected to reduce visibilities to 1/4 mile or less over a large area for an extended period of time (2 or more hours). n/a n/a Freezing Rain A Freezing Rain Advisory is issued when freezing precipitation is expected, however ice accumulations are anticipated to be less than 1/4 inch.\n\nThese are generally issued 12 to 24 hours prior to the expected start of the event. n/a n/a Ice Storm n/a n/a An Ice Storm Warning is issued when freezing precipitation is expected with 1/4 inch or more of ice accumulation.\n\nThese are generally issued 12 to 24 hours prior to the expected start of the event. Winter Weather Hazardous winter weather conditions are occurring, imminent or likely. Conditions will cause a significant inconvenience and if caution is not exercised, will result in a potential threat to life and/or property. The generic term, winter weather advisory, is used for a combination of two or more of the following events; snow, freezing rain or drizzle, sleet, blowing snow. n/a n/a Winter Storm n/a Conditions are favorable for hazardous winter weather conditions including heavy snow, blizzard conditions, or significant accumulations of freezing rain or sleet. These watches are usually issued 12 to 36 hours in advance of the event.\n\nSpecific criteria are subjective based on region, however generally speaking significant and hazardous winter weather is defined as a combination of:\n\n1) 4 inches or more of snow/sleet within a 12-hour period or 7 inches or more of snow/sleet within a 24-hour period\n\nAND/OR\n\n2) Enough ice accumulation to cause damage to trees or powerlines.\n\nAND/OR\n\n3) A life threatening or damaging combination of snow and/or ice accumulation with wind. A Winter Storm Warning is issued when a significant combination of hazardous winter weather is occurring or imminent. Specific criteria are subjective based on region. The criteria listed below are consistent with the Chicago, IL (NWS) Office:\n\n1) Heavy snow of 6 inches or greater.\n\nAND/OR\n\n2) Heavy sleet of half inch or more.\n\nAND/OR\n\n3) Conditions meet the criteria for two or more separate warnings. Example: If you have Heavy Snow Warning conditions along with Wind Chill Warning conditions, a Winter Storm Warning will be issued. Blizzard n/a n/a A Blizzard Warning means that the following conditions are occurring or expected for 3 hours or longer within the next 12 to 18 hours.\n\n1) Snow and/or blowing snow reducing visibility to 1/4 mile or less.\n\nAND\n\n2) Sustained winds of 35 mph or greater or frequent gusts to 35 mph or greater.\n\nThere is no temperature requirement that must be met to achieve blizzard conditions. Snow Advisory* A Snow Advisory will be issued when 3-5 inches is expected to fall. n/a n/a Lake Effect Snow n/a n/a Lake effect snowfall of 6 inches or more in 12 hours or less, or 8 inches or more in 24 hours or less. Heavy Snow n/a n/a A Heavy Snow Warning will be issued if 6 or more inches of snow is expected in a 12 hour period. Blowing Snow A Blowing Snow advisory will be posted for events in which visibility is intermittently 1/4 mile or less. n/a n/a Frost A Frost Advisory is issued when the minimum temperature is forecast to be 33 to 36 degrees on clear and calm nights or generally with frost is expected to occur during the growing season.\n\nThe growing season in the US is generally defined as the period of time between the last occurance of a frost or freeze in the Spring and the first occurance of a frost or freeze in the Autumn. n/a n/a Freeze n/a A Freeze Watch is issued during the growing season when there is a potential for significant, widespread freezing temperatures within the next 24-36 hours.\n\nSee 'Frost Advisory' definition of the growing season. A Freeze Warning is issued when significant, widespread freezing temperatures are occuring during the growing season.\n\nSee 'Frost Advisory' definition of the growing season. Wind Chill** A Wind Chill Advisory will be issued when the wind chill is less than or equal to -20°F\n\nAND\n\nthe winds are greater than or equal to 10 mph.\n\nSee NWS Wind Chill Chart to calculate wind chill. n/a A Wind Chill Warning is issued when the wind chill will be less than or equal to -30°F\n\nAND\n\nthe winds are greater than or equal to 10 mph.\n\nSee NWS Wind Chill Chart to calculate wind chill.\n\nWeather Type: Advisory Watch Warning Severe Thunderstorm n/a A Severe Thunderstorm Watch is issued for a large area (roughly on the order of 100 square miles or more) by the Storm Prediction Center (SPC) when severe thunderstorms are possible in and near the watch area.\n\nSevere thunderstorms are defined as follows:\n\n1) Winds of 58 mph or higher\n\nAND/OR\n\n2) Hail 1 inch in diameter or larger.\n\nA Severe Thunderstorm Watch may also come with a qualifier that labels it as a \"Particularly Dangerious Situations\" (PDS). A PDS watch is issued at the discretion of the forecaster and is meant to emphasize an enhanced risk of extraordinary severe and life-threatening weather. A Severe Thunderstorm Warning is issued by the National Weather Service (NWS) when severe thunderstorms are occurring or imminent for a localized area specific to the storm and the areas expected to be impacted.\n\nSevere thunderstorms are defined as follows:\n\n1) Winds of 58 mph or higher\n\nAND/OR\n\n2) Hail 1 inch in diameter or larger.\n\nAND/OR\n\n3) A tornado is occuring or has recently occured with this thunderstorm*. Tornado n/a A Tornado Watch is issued for a large area (roughly on the order of 100 square miles or more) by SPC when severe thunderstorms capable of producing tornadoes are possible in and near the watch area.\n\nSevere thunderstorms are defined as follows:\n\n1) Winds of 58 mph or higher\n\nAND/OR\n\n2) Hail 1 inch in diameter or larger.\n\nA Tornado Watch may also come with a qualifier that labels it as a \"Particularly Dangerious Situations\" (PDS). A PDS watch is issued at the discretion of the forecaster and is meant to emphasize an enhanced risk of extraordinary severe and life-threatening weather. A Tornado Warning is issued by the NWS when a tornado is occurring or imminent. The area warned is a localized area specific to the storm producing the tornado and the areas expected to be impacted. When a tornado warning is issued, seek safe shelter immediately. Tornado Emergency n/a n/a A Tornado Emergency is a more notorious version of Tornado Warning issued (rarely) at the discretion of the NWS during significant tornado occurrences in highly populated areas. A Tornado Emergency generally means that significant, widespread damage is expected to continue and a high likelihood of numerous fatalities is expected with a large, strong to violent tornado. Wind A Wind Advisory is issued when the following conditions are expected for 3 hours or longer.\n\n1) Sustained winds of 31 to 39 mph\n\nAND/OR\n\n2) Wind gusts of 46 to 57 mph. n/a n/a High Wind n/a A High Wind Watch is issued when the following conditions are possible:\n\n1) Sustained winds of 40 mph or higher for one hour or more\n\nOR\n\n2) Wind gusts of 58 mph or higher for one hour or more. A High Wind Warning is issued when the following conditions are occuring or imminent:\n\n1) Sustained winds of 40 mph or higher for one hour or more\n\nOR\n\n2) Wind gusts of 58 mph or higher for one hour or more. Extreme Wind n/a n/a An Extreme Wind Warning is issued for surface winds of 100 knots (115 MPH) or greater associated with non-convective, downslope, derecho (NOT associated with a tornado), or sustained hurricane winds are expected to occur within one hour. Dense Fog A Dense Fog Advisory is issued when widespread fog is expected to reduce visibilities to 1/4 mile or less over a large area for an extended period of time (2 or more hours). n/a n/a"
