        "text": "Weather advisory in the United States\n\nA lake effect snow advisory was issued by the National Weather Service of the United States when lake effect snow may pose a hazard or is life-threatening. The snow must be completely caused by a convective snow development over a lake and not by a low pressure system. The criteria for this advisory vary from area to area.[1]\n\nPrior to the 2008â€“09 winter storm season, there was the lake-effect snow and blowing snow advisory, specific for when blowing snow another hazard expected in the advised area.[2] The Lake-Effect Snow Advisory for Lake-Effect Snow and Blowing Snow has since replaced it.\n\nOn October 2, 2017, issuance of the lake effect snow advisory has been discontinued altogether, and a winter weather advisory will now be issued when the above criteria are expected to be met.[3]\n\nExamples\n\n[edit]\n\nURGENT - WINTER WEATHER MESSAGE NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE SALT LAKE CITY UT 1136 AM MST FRI DEC 31 2010 ...LAKE EFFECT SNOW TO IMPACT THE WASATCH FRONT THROUGH MIDNIGHT TONIGHT... .A WELL DEVELOPED LAKE EFFECT SNOW BAND IS EXPECTED TO REMAIN INTACT INTO THE OVERNIGHT HOURS TONIGHT.
