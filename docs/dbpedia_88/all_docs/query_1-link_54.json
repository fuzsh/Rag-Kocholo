        "text": "CHICAGO (CBS)-- Overnight snow is causing slick road conditions for Friday morning commuters, particularly in Northwest Indiana, where very heavy lake effect snow already has dumped more than a foot of snow in some places.\n\nA winter storm warning is in effect for LaPorte County until 6 a.m. Saturday. A winter storm warning also has been issued for neighboring Porter County between 10 p.m. Friday and 6 a.m. Saturday. An earlier winter weather advisory rest of the area has since expired.\n\nWhiteout conditions are possible at times in Northwest Indiana. The National Weather Service warned people in LaPorte County should consider postponing any non-essential travel.\n\nWith the snow in addition to the 40 mph wind gusts, the National Weather Service called travel conditions \"dangerous to impossible.\"\n\nThis will bring snow rates between 2-3 inches per hour with significant travel impacts in Northwest Indiana. As of 10 a.m. Friday, LaPorte County had already had 12 to 18 inches of snow.\n\nBy Friday night, wind chills drop. Wind chills of -15 to -25 degrees are expected mainly west of the Fox River as well as interior parts of northern Illinois, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nBlowing and drifting snow in Chicago creates hazardous conditions with poor visibility on snow-covered roadways."
