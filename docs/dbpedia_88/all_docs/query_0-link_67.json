        "text": "A winter storm clipper system is expected to drop several inches of snow in parts of Michigan on Monday.\n\nHere’s a breakdown of expected snow totals in each area of Michigan:\n\nSnow in Southeast Michigan:\n\nFrom 4Warn Weather’s Ashlee Baracy: A cold front will bring scattered to numerous snow showers across Southeast Michigan today. Most accumulation is expected on grassy surfaces during the day. However, a rapid drop in temperatures to below freezing in the evening will allow for better pavement accumulation, especially in the Thumb region.\n\nIn fact, a Winter Weather Advisory has been issued for Sanilac county from noon until midnight on Monday. Expect bursts of lake effect snow showers in this area of the Thumb. When paired with high wind, visibility could be rapidly reduced in this area, along with deteriorating road conditions.\n\nMost of the Thumb could see around an inch of accumulation, but in areas closer to the water that will see heavier bursts, we can’t rule out total snow accumulation up to 3 inches. (Read more here)\n\nSnow in West Michigan\n\nFrom the National Weather Service in Grand Rapids: “Snowfall amounts will vary, but in general 2 to 6 inches of snow is expected west of Highway 131. Some isolated higher amounts are possible south of Saugatuck. Wind gusts of 40 to 50 mph near the lake will create areas of blowing snow. Be prepared for changeable travel conditions today.”\n\nA winter storm warning is in effect for areas including South Haven, Benton Harbor and Holland, expiring early Tuesday morning.\n\nSnow in Northern Lower Michigan\n\nFrom the National Weather Service: “Snow combined with gusty winds of 25-35 mph at times, will create hazardous travel conditions today, particularly along and west of US-131 in northern Lower Michigan. Temperatures dropping below freezing this morning could cause a flash freeze on roadways. Snow is expected to quickly diminish tonight.”\n\nSnow in Michigan Upper Peninsula\n\nFrom the National Weather Service in Marquette: “Lake effect snow showers continue today with blustery northwest to north winds. This will create hazardous road conditions across much of the U.P. Drive slow on snow covered roads and leave space between you and other cars.”"
