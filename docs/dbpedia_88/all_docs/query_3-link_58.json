        "text": "A lake-effect snow warning will begin on Monday for Chautauqua County.\n\nThe National Weather Service reports the warning is in effect from 10 a.m. to 7 a.m. Wednesday. Heavy lake effect snow expected with total snow accumulations of 7 to 12 inches in the most persistent lake snows with local amounts up to 15 inches across the Chautauqua Ridge. Winds gusting as high as 35 mph will produce areas of blowing and drifting snow.\n\nHeaviest lake effect snows will remain well south of the Buffalo Metro area.\n\nForecasters say travel could be very difficult to impossible. The hazardous conditions could impact the morning or evening commute."
