        "text": "BUFFALO, N.Y. – Heavy bands of lake-effect snow buried parts of the Great Lakes region and interior Northeast under feet of snow over the weekend, leaving travel bans in place and even forcing the postponement of an NFL playoff game.\n\nThe FOX Forecast Center said that because the Great Lakes remain free of ice and water temperatures are well above freezing, significant bands of heavy snow developed and created dangerous travel conditions across the region. Winds gusted up to 65 mph in some areas, including Buffalo, creating blowing and drifting snow.\n\nWHAT TO DO DURING A WINTER STORM POWER OUTAGE\n\nOfficials issued a travel ban for a good portion of western New York on Sunday as near-blizzard conditions and zero visibility made for dangerous driving. In some bands of lake-effect snow, the NWS estimated that snow was falling at 1-3 inches per hour.\n\n\"For those of you who are wondering why there may be a driving ban, I’m in the town of Cheektowaga,\" Erie County Executive Mark Poloncarz said in a video posted to X Sunday morning. \"It’s rough. It’s pretty bad out here. You can’t really see more than in the front of the hood of your car.\"\n\nSlippery roadways and gusty winds were a bad combination for trucks on major highways. This was just one semi that jackknifed and blocked all lanes of Interstate 90 near the New York-Pennsylvania state line. In Buffalo, the NWS clocked a wind gust of 64 mph.\n\nHOW TO WATCH FOX WEATHER\n\nOver 3 feet of snow in some spots\n\nThe Buffalo Airport measured 8.6 inches of snow on Sunday, breaking a daily record set in 1963. Overall, the storm total reached just over 13 inches, but many areas in western New York measured more than 2 feet of snow, with localized areas picking up over 3 feet. As much as 41.3 inches piled up in Hamburg, while 41 inches was measured in Derby.\n\nThe New York State Department of Transportation reported that it had 1,599 large plows, 148 medium plows, 37 snow blowers and 13 tree crew bucket trucks at the ready.\n\nPITTSBURGH STEELERS, BUFFALO BILLS GAME POSTPONED DUE TO HEAVY SNOW, WIND\n\nHeavy snow forces delay in Buffalo Bills' playoff game\n\nThe heavy snow in the forecast for Orchard Park, home of the Buffalo Bills' Highmark Stadium, forced the NFL to postpone Sunday's Wild Card matchup against the Pittsburgh Steelers until Monday – and the blizzard conditions pummeling the stadium over the weekend showed the forecast verified.\n\nOnce the snow stopped, it was a mad scramble to clear the stadium of several inches of snow.\n\nHERE'S HOW TO SURVIVE IF YOU GET LOST IN THE WOODS THIS WINTER\n\n\"Of course, for our Bills Mafia viewers, the Bills are actually looking for people to help them shovel out Highmark Stadium today,\" FOX Weather Meteorologist Katie Byrne reported from Buffalo Monday. \"Today, you’re going to get paid $20 an hour if you can do it. There’s going to be free food, but it’s ‘BYOS’ – bring your own shovel.\"\n\nThe game on Monday went as scheduled, with the Bills defeating the Steelers 31-17.\n\nA similar threat of heavy snowfall in 2022 forced a regular season game between the Cleveland Browns and Buffalo Bills to be moved to Ford Field in Detroit.\n\nMore heavy snow comes this week to western New York\n\nHOW TO PROTECT YOUR PETS IN WINTER WEATHER\n\nThere is no rest for the snow weary. While the Bills got their game in on Monday, it was a narrow window as another round of lake-effect snow is on the way from Tuesday through Thursday.\n\nA Lake Effect Snow Warning is in effect from later Tuesday through Thursday for as much as 1-3 feet of snow on top of many of the same areas that were buried over the weekend."
