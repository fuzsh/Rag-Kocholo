        "text": "The mixing of below-freezing air with large areas of air over a lake’s warm water can have a very snowy impact on the communities in the path of the wind-led weather pattern. This is a common-enough occurrence that we’ve termed it lake effect snow, something folks living east of the Great Lakes know all too well.\n\nLake effect snow forms when cold air moves over warm water, according to the National Weather Service. Most common in late fall and into winter, the heat and moisture coming from the relatively warm lake starts to form clouds as it mixes with the cold air above, generally brought south from Canada. The larger the lake, the greater the opportunity for the clouds to grow.\n\nHow does lake effect snow form?\n\nThe warmth and moisture of the lake transfers into the lowest portion of the atmosphere, and as the air rises clouds form and develop into a narrow band. Since water holds heat better than air, the winter months often see the below-freezing air passing over the water’s warmer air, causing lake water to evaporate into the air and warm it. The warmer, wetter air rises and cools as it moves away from the lake. The colder it gets, the more chance it has to return to land in the form of snow, which can easily fall at the rate of three inches per hour.\n\nRadar animation of lake effect snow forming over Buffalo, New York.\n\n“If the winds and temperatures are right, the air acts like a big sponge that sops up water from the lake and wrings it out on land,” the NWS says. If the wind is blowing in a direction that covers more of the lake, the air will take in more water. And the greater the temperature difference, the more water the air can absorb.\n\n“That moisture can make for a whole lot of snow,” the NWS says.\n\nA man clears his walkway with a snowblower in Adams, New York, during a lake effect snow storm that dumped over five feet of snow on the area, January 31, 2019. Footage by Scott J. McPartland.\n\nThese bands of snow continue beyond the lake and onto land, pushed by the wind. “Wind direction is a key component in determining which areas will receive lake effect snow,” the NWS says. “Heavy snow may be falling in one location, while the sun may be shining just a mile or two away in either direction.”\n\nWhat area gets the most lake effect snow?\n\nTypically, lake effect snow doesn’t travel much beyond 25 miles from the lake before falling, but it can last as far as 100 miles. The land’s topography can lead to the forcing of precipitation.\n\nEach of the Great Lakes—that’s Superior, Michigan, Huron, Erie, and Ontario, if you need to brush up on your geography—is capable of creating its own band of lake effect snow. Even the Great Salt Lake in Utah has the capability to generate lake effect snow.\n\nWith the wind typically pushing west to east across North America, the orientation of Lake Erie and Lake Ontario have the most opportunity to produce lake effect snow, which is why Buffalo, Rochester, and Syracuse are snow hotspots. Still, Lake Superior, Lake Michigan, and Lake Huron can produce lake effect snow (just ask northern Wisconsin, western Michigan, and northwestern Pennsylvania).\n\nA two-hour time-lapse of a lake effect snow band over Lake Erie on November 18, 2022. Courtesy NOAA.\n\nHow long does lake effect snow last?\n\nWhile lake effect snow events typically come as single-lake one-offs, such as a band forming over Lake Erie and then unleashing onto Buffalo to the east, when atmospheric parameters are favorable, bands from different lakes can merge to enhance the snowfall counts downstream, so to speak. So, if it all lines up just so, one example has a Lake Huron snow band eventually merging with a Lake Ontario band, meaning the folks in Rochester or Syracuse will get especially blasted.\n\n“Having an upstream lake effect snow band reinforce another band farther downstream makes the downstream band a better snow producer than it would have been by itself,” the NWS says. By having an upstream band for reinforcement, a single band can maintain its integrity longer.\n\nA lake effect snow storm can last only a few hours to several days. But the lake effect lessens as winter deepens. When the water becomes colder, it mutes the phenomenon. Lake Erie, the shallowest of the Great Lakes, can even freeze over, negating the lake effect.\n\nHow predictable is lake effect snow?\n\nAccording to the Cooperative Institute for Great Lakes Research, lake effect snow is still “notoriously hard to predict.”\n\nBruce Smith, NWS meteorologist, says a unique aspect of lake effect snow is the extreme variability that can occur in space and time. “It is not uncommon for sunny skies at a particular location to be quickly replaced by blinding, wind-driven snowfall in a matter of minutes,” he says. “Similarly, snowfall accumulations can vary from a trace to several inches over a short distance.”\n\nSo if there’s a lake effect snow warning issued for your area, it’s best to take heed and prepare for a potential snowy onslaught."
