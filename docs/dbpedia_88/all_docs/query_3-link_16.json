Friday's reporting:\n\nBreak out the heavy jackets: Winter is headed our way.\n\nAs a cold front pushes across the region Sunday night, temperatures in Erie County are expected to drop into the 20s and 30s starting Monday, with a little snowfall to boot.\n\nHere’s what to expect:\n\nNational Weather Service expects 2-4 inches of snow\n\nCold air pushing across Lake Erie is going to set up “pretty favorable conditions” for lake-effect snow beginning mid-morning Monday and heading into Tuesday, said Raelene Campbell, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Cleveland.\n\nCampbell said Erie County has an 80% chance of snow between Monday afternoon and Tuesday, with 2-4 inches possible by Tuesday. More accumulation is possible in certain local areas, she added.\n\nCampbell said the forecast shows an initial rain/snow mix Monday morning turning into snow by the afternoon.\n\nMonday is expected to have a high of 37 degrees and Tuesday a high of 33 degrees.\n\nCity of Erie parking regulations: What to know about odd-even winter parking rules\n\nNo icy conditions but drivers advised to take caution\n\nCampbell said she doesn’t expect severe icy conditions Monday or Tuesday. Winds will likely be around 15-20 miles per hour on Monday and will calm down by Tuesday.\n\nWhile not exactly blizzard conditions, Campbell still advised drivers to be mindful of the weather, especially during peak travel times.\n\n“It’s just the nature of lake-effect to have some heavier bursts of snow, which may quickly reduce visibility or quickly accumulate on roadways,” she said. “So, there is always a potential for motorists to be impacted and we always just recommend having a safety kit in your car just in case something were to happen.”\n\nAre you ready for snow? 'Farmer's Almanac' releases winter outlook for Erie, Great Lakes\n\nHow long will the snow last?\n\nCampbell said snowfall is expected to diminish beyond Tuesday with only a 30-40% chance of snow showers for Wednesday and Thursday.\n\nTemperatures, however, will continue to stay cold with a high of 36 degrees on Wednesday and a high of 39 degrees on Thursday.\n\n“The big thing is that it’s going to get much colder than it’s been thus far and more consistently colder,” Campbell said.\n\nWinter officially begins Dec. 21.\n\nMonday's snowfall will not be the first snowfall of the 2023-24 season. That came on Oct. 31, when roughly 2 inches of snow was reported at Erie International Airport.\n\nIn Erie, lake-effect snow occurs when cold air moves over the warm water of Lake Erie."
