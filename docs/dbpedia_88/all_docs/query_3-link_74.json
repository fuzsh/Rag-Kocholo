        "text": "NEW YORK (WABC) -- Buffalo and western New York could face dangerous blizzard-like conditions this weekend, prompting the Bills playoff game against Pittsburgh to be rescheduled.\n\nDuring a press conference Saturday, New York Governor Kathy Hochul announced the Bills game will now be played Monday, Jan. 15 at 4:30 p.m.\n\nHochul also took to X, formerly Twitter, and noted that the decision was made after speaking with emergency response teams, Bills leadership and the NFL.\n\nThe governor also announced a full travel ban for all passenger vehicles in Erie County starting at 9 p.m.\n\nHochul said snowfall rates of 2-3 inches per hour are anticipated and response teams are preparing for the \"worst-case scenario.\"\n\n\"It will not be safe to be out on the roads tonight,\" Hochul said, adding that the travel ban will allow crews to try stay on top of snow removal.\n\nHochul said the \"bullseye\" of the storm will hit early afternoon on Sunday, which led to the decision to postpone the game.\n\nA state of emergency was issued Friday by the governor ahead of the potentially life-threatening conditions in the region.\n\nBitterly cold air is expected to clash with intense lake-effect snow during this storm that could amount to 1-3 feet.\n\nAccuWeather says strong winds combined with the heavy snow could create whiteout conditions around Orchard Park, New York.\n\nRELATED: Winter storm to bring more rain, flooding, and then a freeze to NYC, Tri-State\n\nThe same winter storm dumped heavy snow across the Plains and Midwest, ushering in some of the coldest air of the season.\n\nThe cold was the biggest concern in the Dakotas. It was 11 degrees below zero F (minus 24 C) in Bismarck, North Dakota, on Friday morning, and forecasters warned the weekend would get even worse. It could reach 20 below F (minus 29 C) by early Sunday.\n\nNear-record cold in Kansas City made for a frigid NFL playoff game Saturday night between the Chiefs and Miami. The game time temperature was 7 below zero with a wind chill of 27 below.\n\nThe University of Kansas Health System set up a clinic and several first aid stations at Arrowhead Stadium.\n\n\"We could really get busy,\" emergency medicine physician Dr. Dennis Allin said at a briefing on Friday.\n\nSubscribe to the Weather or Not with Lee Goldberg podcast\n\nMORE ACCUWEATHER RESOURCES\n\nCheck AccuTrack Radar\n\nAir Quality Tracker\n\nNWS Advisories, Watches and Warnings\n\nSchool closings and delays\n\nFor weather updates wherever you go, please download the AccuWeather app."
