        "text": "CHICAGO (CBS) -- Lake effect snowfall is continuing to fall across the Chicago area, with some suburbs reporting 8 inches of snow or more already, and another inch or two possible by this evening.\n\nA Winter Storm Warning for northern and central Cook County is expiring at 2 p.m., but the National Weather Service went on to issue a winter weather advisory for Cook County through the late afternoon.\n\nAdditional lake effect snow is expected throughout the afternoon, mainly along the lakefront and downtown.\n\nWinter Weather Advisories for Will, DuPage, and Lake counties in Illinois also will expire at 2 p.m., but separate Winter Weather Advisories have been issued through 10 p.m. for Lake and Porter Counties in Indiana.\n\nIn Northwest Indiana, additional accumulations of 1 to 3 inches are possible the rest of the afternoon, mainly across the far northern portions of Lake and Porter counties.\n\nDrivers should expect slippery, snow-covered roads in areas seeing lake effect snow, making for a messy afternoon commute, particularly along I-80/94 and portions of I-65 in Northwest Indiana.\n\nSkies will clear out overnight, but temperatures will plummet to near zero.\n\nTONIGHT: LAKESIDE SNOW SWINGS TO NORTHWEST INDIANA. THEN CLEARING OVERNIGHT. LOW 1.\n\nSATURDAY: A SUNNY START. TURNING CLOUDY IN THE AFTERNOON. HIGH 22."
