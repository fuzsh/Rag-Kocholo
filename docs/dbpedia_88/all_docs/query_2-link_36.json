        "text": "This application allows you to search for National Weather Service Watch, Warning, and Advisories. There are currently three options:\n\n1. Search for Storm Based Warnings by Point\n\n2. Search of Watch/Warning/Advisories by County/Zone or by Point\n\n3. List Watch/Warning/Advisories by State/WFO by Year\n\n1. Search for Storm Based Warnings by Point\n\nThe official warned area for some products the NWS issues is a polygon. This section allows you to specify a point on the map below by dragging the marker to where you are interested in. Once you stop dragging the marker, the grid will update and provide a listing of storm based warnings found.\n\n2. Search for NWS Watch/Warning/Advisories Products by County/Zone or by Point\n\nThe NWS issues watch, warnings, and advisories (WWA) for counties/parishes. For some products (like winter warnings), they issue for forecast zones. In many parts of the country, these zones are exactly the same as the counties/parishes. When you get into regions with topography, then zones will start to differ to the local counties.\n\nThis application allows you to search the IEM's archive of NWS WWA products. Our archive is not complete, but there are no known holes since 12 November 2005. This archive is of those products that contain VTEC codes, which are nearly all WWAs that the NWS issues for. There are Severe Thunderstorm, Tornado, and Flash Flood Warnings included in this archive for dates prior to 2005. These were retroactively assigned VTEC event identifiers by the IEM based on some hopefully intelligent logic.\n\nSelect State:\n\nSelect County/Zone:\n\nStart Date:\n\nEnd Date:\n\nYou can otherwise search by lat/lon point. The start and end date set above are used with this option as well:\n\nLatitude (deg N):\n\nLongitude (deg E):\n\nOr drag marker to select coordinate:\n\nEventPhenomenaSignificanceIssued Expired\n\n3. List NWS Watch/Warning/Advisories by State/WFO by Year\n\nThis section generates a simple list of NWS Watch, Warning, and Advisories by state and year."
