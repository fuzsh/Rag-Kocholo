        "text": "The National Weather Service has issued High Wind Warnings and Lake Effect Snow Warnings across the region as a strong cold front tonight will bring a variety of severe weather conditions.\n\nLake Effect Snow Warnings begin at 10PM tonight as temperatures cool very quickly behind the cold front. The rapid drop in temperatures could result flash freezing, meaning any wet roads could turn icy early Thursday morning.\n\nHigh Wind Warnings cover much of central New York as gusts could reach as high as 60mph at times. Leading to the chance for downed trees and power lines.\n\nNotice how fast temperatures fall into the 30s this evening. With a high temperature of 67 degrees, Syracuse will likely experience a 30+ degree drop in temperatures within 6 hours.\n\nAs of early this morning, the center of the low-pressure system is moving east across the Great Lakes. Prefrontal warm winds this morning could boost our high temperatures today into the record books.\n\nA line of thunderstorms this afternoon with frequent lightning and strong winds, followed by heavy lake effect snow will make travel tonight and tomorrow dicey at best.\n\nThere's still uncertainty on exactly where the heaviest lake effect snow will hit Thursday. Widespread snowfall totals of 3-6\" across the Syracuse area is likely. Higher snowfall totals in the hardest hit regions are possible.\n\nCurrent forecasts are indicating a thin heavy band could produce 6-10\" of snow with isolated snowfall amounts up to 12\". Regardless of the exact snowfall totals, strong winds, icy/snow-covered roads are all but certain. Travel could be very difficult late tonight and through the day on Thursday. Make sure to take the proper precautions if you have to be on the roads.\n\nThankfully conditions improve drastically on Friday with warming temperatures and sunshine returning.
