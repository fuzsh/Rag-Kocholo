        "text": "WEST MICHIGAN â€” Our first Winter Weather Advisory of December has been issued for Oceana, Muskegon, Ottawa, and Kalamazoo counties starting Monday morning at 4 A.M. lasting until Tuesday at 4 A.M. Allegan, Van Buren, Berrien, and Cass coutnies are under a Winter Storm Warning from 4 A.M. Monday until 4 A.M. Tuesday.\n\nSnow accumulation is expected to reach between a trace to about 2 inches in most communities. In those counties with a Winter Weather Advisory, there's potential for up to isolated amounts measuring up to 5 inches. In counties under a Winter Storm Warning, snow accumulations may top 8 inches!\n\nWith a strong northwesterly wind, the lake effect snow will kick off early Monday morning. Light snow showers will be on and off throughout the day. The strong winds may have the potential to reduce visibility as blowing snow could become a road hazard. Gusts will be up to 50 mph. Speaking of road hazards, it'll be possible that roads could turn slick with the addition of snow. Plus, we haven't had a lot of chances to practice winter weather driving! Reduce your speed, turn on your headlights and drive safely!\n\nHere is a breakdown of when the snow showers begin:\n\nYour morning commute could start off slick, especially for those along the lakeshore. As of 5 A.M. Monday, the models predict lake effect will start for the lakeshore.\n\nBy 9 A.M. snow showers will become more scattered, bringing some minor accumulation to our central inland communities.\n\nBy the afternoon, expect some inland communities to see a taper in snow, while it remains persistent for lakeshore communities through the evening commute. Expect I-196 and I-94 to have some of the worst travel impacts in the evening, especially in Van Buren County."
