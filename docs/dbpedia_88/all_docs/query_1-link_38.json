        "text": "A Winter Weather Advisory continues in Berrien County until 1 p.m. Monday. These Winter Weather Advisories continue along the Lake Michigan shoreline due to persistent lake-effect snow.\n\nBlowing and drifting snow is expected to continue, which will make travel a little difficult in spots. Lake effect snow will fall in areas closer to the Lake Michigan shoreline, which will accumulate an additional few inches through the middle part of the week.\n\nDangerously cold air remains in our region for the next few days. All of our forecast area is under a Wind Chill Warning until noon Monday.\n\nMorning wind chills will be between -15 and -25 Monday and Tuesday, with afternoon wind chills only climbing to a few degrees below zero. This air continues into the week.\n\nHighs Monday and Tuesdaywill only be in the single-digits. Temperatures will dip well-below zero Sunday and Monday nights.Wind chills will likely stay below zero through Tuesday night. This is going to be an extended period of bitterly cold weather.\n\nAir temperatures will be in the 20â€™s starting Wednesday, but because of the winds our wind chills will be much lower. They will start in the teens and drop into the single digits as the day moves along."
