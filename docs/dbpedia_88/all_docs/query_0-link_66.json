        "text": "SALT LAKE CITY â€” A Winter Storm Warning has been extended to nearly all of northern Utah ahead of a weekend storms expected to bring heavy snowfall across the area.\n\nTRACK THE STORMS: Get real-time storm information by downloading the FREE Utah Weather Authority app\n\nThe extended warning, which originally covered northeastern Utah, was released by the National Weather Service just before noon. Two pushes of snow are forecast, with the heaviest coming between Saturday morning and into Monday.\n\nNorthern valleys are expected to receive 3-9 inches of snow accumulation, with 2-4 feet forecast for the northern mountains, with higher snowfall totals, maybe up to five feet, expected in the Upper Cottonwoods.\n\nOn Friday afternoon, the Salt Lake City office of the National Weather Service updated its forecast saying that there is a 60 percent chance that the Salt Lake Valley and areas to the south will see rain Saturday evening, which will decrease the snow amounts.\n\nThe Cache Valley and northern Wasatch Front may still see 8-15 inches of snow.\n\nGusty winds are also expected, with the strongest in the northern mountains and Uinta County. A 95 miles-per-hour gust was recorded in the Upper Cottonwoods and an 85 mph gust at Mt. Ogden.\n\nWATCH: Can anything be done to avoid snowstorm traffic catastrophes?\n\nThe first round of storms will begin Friday and could affect the evening commute. UDOT is warning drivers in the Salt Lake Valley that Friday's storm will bring \"significant blowing snow\" making for especially difficult travel conditions. Travelers should be prepared to use high caution as roads could be treacherous.\n\nState Road 210 in Big Cottonwood Canyon will be closed at 12:30 a.m. this evening for avalanche mitigation. The road is scheduled to reopen at approximately 8:30 a.m.\n\nA Code Blue has been called for in Salt Lake County, allowing for emergency shelters to open. Volunteers are needed for the Valley Behavioral Health location at 1020 South Main Street and First United Methodist Church at 203 South 200 East."
