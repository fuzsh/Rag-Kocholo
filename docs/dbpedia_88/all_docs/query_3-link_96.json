        "text": "Syracuse, N.Y. -- Travel across Upstate New York could be hampered by a strong storm system that could bring rain and lake effect snow just in time for the long Thanksgiving weekend.\n\nThe National Weather Service has already issued hazardous weather alerts for the middle of next week for rain, high winds and potentially heavy lake effect snow in the Buffalo area, the Tug Hill Plateau and the western Adirondacks.\n\nAn inch of rain could fall amid strong winds starting Wednesday, and that could change over to light snow across much of Upstate into Thanksgiving morning as temperatures fall behind a cold front. All told, the storm system could bring more than an inch of precipitation in the combination of rain and snow.\n\nThe storm system will bring in moisture from the southwest and then clash with a cold front from the west, setting the stage for snow through at least Thanksgiving Day.\n\n“Significant lake effect snow is possible east and northeast of Lake Ontario and Lake Erie mid to late next week, including Thanksgiving,” the weather service office in Buffalo said. “Travel for the holiday could be impacted.”\n\nIt’s too early to know how much snow would fall or where the heaviest bands of lake effect would be, the weather service said. Any significant snowfall is likely to steel clear of Central New York, Accuweather meteorologist Tom Kines said.\n\n“The winds are going to be more westerly, which should be able to keep the heavy lake effect snows north of Syracuse,” Kines told syracuse.com, “but anybody’s fair game for minor accumulation of snow next week.”\n\nWinds are likely to be strong Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday, with gusts up to 45 mph, the weather service said. That could make travel more hazardous in a variety of ways, from buffetting high-profile vehicles like SUVs to blowing snow across the road. High winds will also push wind chills down into the teens on Thanksgiving Day.\n\nKines and the weather service caution that a forecast five days away, especially for tricky-to-predict lake effect snow, still has many uncertainties. Among them: how much moisture the storm brings, when it collides with cold air, and what direction the winds will come from on Thanksgiving Day and beyond."
