        "text": "The winter storm warning has changed into a winter weather advisory, as of Monday night.\n\nSt. Joseph County, along with many other counties in our area, saw off-and-on snow flurries.\n\nThat type of snowfall is typical for a lake effect set-up, but the strong wind in many areas caused many problems.\n\nSouth Bend Police Department said, there were 27 crashes the SBPD responded to from 7am-10pm on Monday night.\n\nOne driver says, he wasn't the happiest about this snow, but this will allow new drivers to gain experience.\n\n\"I wish it wouldn’t have come at all to be honest with you after living here for so long you get used to it. The new kids of course haven't experienced it too much I do have a 17-year-old son who’s driving for his first time in the snow.\" saidRichard Warfield -Lives in Osceola.\"\n\nMost of our area was under an alert for winter weather in anticipation for lake effect snow and slick roads.\n\nBerrien County first started seeing this lake effect snow Monday morning and it will continue through Monday night.\n\nThose lake effect snow bands and the strong winds will cause issues.\n\nThe National Weather Service issued a WINTER STORM WARNING for Berrien and Cass Counties in Michigan, and Elkhart and eastern St. Joseph Counties in . A WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY was issued for northern LaPorte, western St. Joseph (IN), northern Kosciusko, all of Marshall, LaGrange and St. Joseph (MI) Counties.These alerts will be in effect until 4 AM EST Tuesday.\n\nOne minute it's snowing and blowing so hard that it's hard to see and the next the sun is brightly shining.\n\nIn Niles, there's a couple inches of snow on the ground in most areas.\n\nWSBT spoke with the Berrien County Road Department. They have several trucks on the roads spreading salt, but one of their biggest battles is with the blowing snow as it reduces visibility at times.\n\nWe also talked with to a spokesman for the Michigan Department of Transportation.\n\nHe said U.S. 31 and I-94 are in pretty good shape, but they have had accidents throughout the day.\n\nPlow crews are going to be on the roads all night until the lake effect is expected to taper off early tomorrow morning.\n\nLow visibility and lake effect snow bands caused issues for drivers in Berrien County late Monday morning.\n\nIn Elkhart, the snow itself isn't the main issue rather the very strong winds.\n\nThe snow appears to be sticking to the grass but is still creating some slippery patches on the roads.\n\nThe wet conditions on the roads could cause problems as the temperature drops.\n\nThe lane has since re-opened.\n\nBands of heavy lake effect snow will continue to impact some through the afternoon and into the evening.\n\nMost areas will see up to about 2\" of snow, but under the heaviest snow bands we could see 4-6\" or more.\n\nRoads will become snow covered, and roads that were just wet in the morning will become slick as temperatures fall into the 20s. This will make driving in the afternoon and evening a bit difficult.\n\nCrews were out early Monday pretreating the roads and laying down salt to help with road conditions in the later half of the day, but roads are still expected to be very slick in spots.\n\nThe snow will also be blown around by very strong winds, which could lead to reduced visibility at times.\n\nIf you want to see what roads look like before you head out the door, .\n\nNot only will we be dealing with the snow, Monday will be very chilly thanks to strong winds.\n\nWinds are expected to gust to around 40 miles per hour in the afternoon. While actual air temperatures will be in the upper 20s to low 30s, we'll be feeling like the teens at times!\n\nThe snow will start to come to an end overnight, though roads could still be slippery Tuesday morning.\n\nWhat snow we have accumulated will not stick around forever - we will be back to the low 40s by mid-week."
