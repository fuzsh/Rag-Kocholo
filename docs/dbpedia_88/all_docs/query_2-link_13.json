        "text": "We are going to have a wintry day across all of Michigan finally. The meaningful snow will be lake-effect, which means smaller areas of heavy snow. Here’s where we can expect the most treacherous driving conditions.\n\nThe lake-effect snow will produce areas of two to six inches of snow from what has fallen this morning through this evening. The heaviest snow could pile up to around eight inches in an area of southwest Michigan.\n\nThe Winter Weather Advisory/Warnings map will give you a really good feel as to where the snow will cause the most treacherous conditions. The pink-shaded counties of Allegan, Cass, Berrien and Van Buren are under a winter storm warning for up to eight inches of snow. The rest of the purple-shaded areas are in the winter weather advisory.\n\nA closer look at southern Michigan shows the cities under the winter storm warning and winter weather advisory.\n\nNorthern Michigan has winter weather advisories, too.\n\nSince this is lake-effect snow, there will be a sharp cut-off in snowfall totals from eight inches around Benton Harbor and Niles to one or two inches around Kalamazoo and Grand Rapids. Don’t forget the wind gusts up to 40 mph, which will make things extra treacherous.\n\nThe Thumb’s winter weather advisory is more for a combination of up to three inches of snow and wind gusts up to 40 mph. The eastern half of the Thumb will have the most snow. The Ann Arbor area and Detroit area should only see an inch or two of snow here and there.\n\nWith a north-northwest wind, the heaviest snow in northwest Lower Michigan will be up to six inches of total snow around Kalkaska, Cadillac and southern Grand Traverse County. The immediate Traverse City area will get two to four inches of snow today and this evening.\n\nThe whole state will have a windy afternoon with gusts around 40 mph. As the temperature drops into the upper 20s this afternoon, the snow will become a drifting/blowing type of snow.\n\nThe snow ends around midnight when the lake-effect process ends.\n\nFor those of you who don’t want to drive in this type of weather there is good news: Today is the only day of snow this week. Tomorrow will be a cold day without a lot of melting, but it will be a dry day. Roads should improve tomorrow. Wednesday we will be back to flirting with 40 degrees over most of Lower Michigan. An extended period of mild weather will last through at least Christmas.\n\nRELATED READING: Eastbound I-94 shut down for ‘multiple’ crashes"
