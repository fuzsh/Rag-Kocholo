Impacts possible in some health systems and in heat-sensitive industries.\n\n3\n\nMajor = This level of heat affects anyone without effective cooling and/or adequate hydration. Impacts likely in some health systems, heat-sensitive industries and infrastructure.\n\n4\n\nExtreme = This level of rare and/or long-duration extreme heat with little to no overnight relief affects anyone without effective cooling and/or adequate hydration. Impacts likely in most health systems, heat-sensitive industries and infrastructure. Wind Threat Potential for wind greater than 110 mph Potential for wind 74 to 110 mph Potential for wind 58 to 73 mph Potential for wind 39 to 57 mph Storm Surge Threat Potential for storm surge > 9 ft above ground Potential for storm surge > 6 ft above ground Potential for storm surge > 3 ft above ground Potential for storm surge > 1 ft above ground Flooding Rain Threat Potential for extreme flooding rain Potential for major flooding rain Potential for moderate flooding rain Potential for localized flooding rain Tornado Threat Potential for an outbreak of tornadoes Potential for many tornadoes Potential for several tornadoes Potential for a few tornadoes"
