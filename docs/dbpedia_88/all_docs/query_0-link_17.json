        "text": "CLEVELAND, Ohio - The first real snow of the 2023-2024 winter season might be upon us.\n\nThe National Weather Service issued a lake-effect snow warning at 10 a.m. on Monday, forecasting heavy snow from 9 p.m. Monday and throughout Tuesday.\n\nUpdate: Up to 16 inches is forecasted during lake effect snow warning\n\nThe worst of it is expected to hit Lake and Ashtabula counties, where 8 to 14 inches of snow is forecasted. In eastern Cuyahoga County, amounts could reach near a foot, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service in Cleveland said.\n\nThe forecast for Cleveland Hopkins International Airport in western Cuyahoga County calls for 4 to 8 inches, with 2 inches possible Monday night.\n\nThere could be significant impacts on Tuesday morning commute times, the weather service warned. Tuesday morning will have the highest chance of snow, at 80%. It will drop to 50% by midday.\n\nIn addition to snow, winds will pick up to 35 mph in some areas, blowing snow and reducing visibility.\n\nThe weather service recommends keeping an extra flashlight, food and water in your vehicle in case of an emergency.\n\nMore: Cleveland weather\n\nSo far, El Niño is making good on promise for a warm winter in Cleveland\n\nWhy are we getting what’s called ‘lake-effect’ snow?\n\nCleveland just had one of the mildest winters ever. Is it a fluke or climate change?\n\nColdest days in Cleveland history: years with most days below zero\n\nCleveland weather history: find weather details for any date since 1871\n\nThis is the typical time for lake effect snow, which is common in the late fall and early winter of the Great Lakes region. It occurs when cold air, usually from Canada, moves across the warm, open waters of lakes like Lake Erie. After the lake freezes over, lake effect snow is over.\n\nThis is the second expected snow for Cleveland this fall after 2.7 inches during an Oct. 31-Nov. 1 storm, as recorded at the airport.\n\nThe last snow warning in Greater Cleveland came on March 19 for Geauga County, one of the few in Cleveland’s previous mild winter. The last winter storm warning that resulted in multiple inches of snow occurred on December 23, 2022.\n\nAfter Tuesday, the lake effect warning should lift, with cloudy skies forecasted for Wednesday and Thursday morning. But expect rain by Thursday night, which will last into Friday.\n\nZachary Smith is the data reporter for cleveland.com. You can reach him at zsmith@cleveland.com."
