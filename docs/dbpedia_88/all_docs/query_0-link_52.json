        "text": "Summary: Students examine lake effect snow in the Great Lakes region, including how to forecast lake effect snow, where it might occur, and what effects it may have on the people of an area.\n\nYou Need:\n\n50 minutes\n\nMap of the Great Lakes region\n\nDownloads:\n\nData Sheet\n\nData Sheet Key\n\nSnowfall Map\n\nSnowbelt Map\n\nSnowstorm Forecaster Map\n\nModifying Cold Air\n\nOutbreak Cold Air\n\nProcedure\n\nAs a whole class, explore a map of the Great Lakes region.\n\nDistribute copies of (or project to class) snowfall and snow belt maps.\n\nAsk students to brainstorm how the temperature difference between the land and the water might affect snowfalls along the lake edge.\n\nCompare the snowfall and snow belt maps to a map of the Great Lakes region to answer questions found throughout the rest of the activity.\n\nPart 1\n\nEstimate the average snowfall in the following places:\n\nErie, Pennsylvania: 60 inches (152 centimeters)\n\nToronto, Ontario: 60 inches (152 centimeters)\n\nCalumet, Michigan (Upper Peninsula): 160 inches (406 centimeters)\n\nPeterborough, Ontario (north of Lake Ontario): 60-80 inches (152-203 centimeters)\n\nBoonville, New York (east end of Lake Ontario): 130-160 inches (330-406 centimeters)\n\nMancelona, Michigan: 120 inches (305 centimeters)\n\nToledo, Ohio: 20-40 inches (51-102 centimeters)\n\nPart 2\n\nUsing the snowfall map:\n\nTape strips of masking tape on the wall to represent each of the snow depths as they appear on the map. Label the strips of tape 20 inches, 40 inches, 60 inches, 80 inches, 100 inches, 120 inches, 140 inches and 160 inches (or metric equivalents) and place the labels at appropriate heights on the wall using the ceiling if necessary.\n\nWorking in small groups, students add the names of cities and towns (including their own area) to the appropriate average snowfall level on the wall or ceiling.\n\nPart 3\n\nAs a whole class, discuss causes of lake effect snowstorms and clues for predicting lake effect snowstorms.\n\nStudents complete data sheet.\n\nAs a whole class, discuss data sheet answers and the impact of heavy snowfalls on people who live in snow belt communities.\n\nQuestions to Consider:\n\nWhat kinds of businesses profit from snowstorms?\n\nWhat kinds of businesses lose money because of snowstorms?\n\nWhat do you think might be the consequences of lake effect snowstorms caused by city and industry pollution?\n\nWhat kinds of food crops can be grown in snow belt areas? Search for agricultural resource maps. North latitude will also have an effect.\n\nWhat do you suppose the Indians and fur traders did when they lived in these snow belt areas before snowplows, furnaces and international food transportation?\n\nWhat kinds of things do you do in snowstorms that are different from what you do on a sunny day in May?\n\nWhat is “good” weather? What is “bad” weather?\n\nWhat difference does it make when the weather is bad? Is good?\n\nHave you ever heard someone predicting the weather with a rhyme? Such as: ‘Red sky in the morning, sailors take warning?’\n\nWhat kinds of information do people use in predicting the weather? How would you find out which kinds of information are most helpful? Least helpful?"
