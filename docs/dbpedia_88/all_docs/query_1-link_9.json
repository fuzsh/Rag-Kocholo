        "text": "Governor Hochul today urged New Yorkers to prepare for another lake effect snow event that is forecast to bring one to three feet of snow to areas in Western and Northern New York, especially near Lakes Erie and Ontario, starting Tuesday afternoon and continuing through Thursday night. In Western NY, the most snow is expected to fall in the Buffalo Metro area and will be heaviest on Wednesday with rates up to 2-3 inches per hour. In Northern NY, the most snow is forecast for the Watertown area, Tug Hill, and northern Oswego County, and will also be heaviest on Wednesday with snowfall rates up to 2-4 inches per hour at times. Winds are expected to gust up to 35-40 mph, especially Wednesday, which will create blowing and drifting snow in both Western and Northern NY areas. Wind chills are forecast to dip down to the negatives or low single digits for several days, continuing through Sunday. The combination of wind, snow and freezing temperatures will likely make travel dangerous so drivers should avoid unnecessary travel especially on Wednesday. The lake effect snow event may also cause power outages in some locations.\n\n“While this next wave of weather isn’t expected to be as impactful as last weekend’s storm, New Yorkers should still be prepared,” Governor Hochul said. “Our State agencies are continuing to work around the clock to monitor conditions, clear the roads support localities. My top priority is to keep New Yorkers safe.”\n\nNew Yorkers are encouraged to sign up for emergency alerts by subscribing to NY Alert at alert.ny.gov, a free service providing critical emergency information to your cell phone or computer. For a complete listing of weather alerts and forecasts, visit the National Weather Service website at alerts.weather.gov.\n\nAgency Activities\n\nNew York State Division of Homeland Security and Emergency Services\n\nThe Division has activated the State’s Emergency Operations Center in Albany to coordinate the State's response throughout the severe weather event. The Office of Emergency Management is in contact with local counterparts and is prepared to facilitate requests for assistance, and State stockpiles are staffed and ready to deploy emergency response assets and shelter supplies as needed.\n\nNew York State Department of Transportation\n\nThe Department of Transportation is monitoring weather conditions and prepared to respond with more than 3,720 supervisors and operators. All field staff are available to fully engage and respond. All residencies in impacted locations will remain staffed for 24/7 operations with operators, supervisors, and mechanics throughout the duration of the event and priority cleanup operations. To support response and ongoing cleanup operations, the Department is deploying an additional 16 operators, 2 supervisors, two snow blowers, and four skidsteers with snowblower attachments and trailers to Western New York. This is in addition to the personnel and equipment previously deployed to the Region for the storm, which included 74 staff, including 54 additional operators, 11 supervisors, six equipment trainers, two Incident Command Support specialists and one safety representative; along with 25 large snowplows, three large snowblowers, two loaders and a grader.\n\nStatewide equipment numbers are as follows:\n\n1,612 large plow trucks\n\n152 medium duty plows\n\n51 tow plows\n\n38 snow blowers\n\n341 large loaders\n\n20 graders\n\nFor real-time travel information, motorists should call 511 or visit www.511ny.org, New York State's official traffic and travel information source.\n\nThruway Authority\n\nThe Thruway Authority is ready to respond to the lake effect winter storm in Western New York with 700 operators and supervisors available statewide. The Authority is shifting additional staff and snow fighting equipment from the Syracuse, Albany, and New York Divisions to support snow and ice operations in Western New York. Staff is currently monitoring the storm track and additional operators and equipment are on standby and will be deployed if conditions warrant.\n\nStatewide equipment numbers and resources are listed below:\n\n355 large and medium duty plow trucks\n\n10 tow plows\n\n65 loaders\n\nApproximately 118,000 tons of salt on hand\n\nVariable Message Signs and social media are utilized to alert motorists of winter weather conditions on the Thruway.\n\nThe Thruway Authority encourages motorists to download its mobile app which is available for free on iPhone and Android devices. The app provides motorists direct access to real-time traffic information, live traffic cameras, and navigation assistance while on the go. Motorists can also sign up for TRANSalert e-mails and follow @ThruwayTraffic on X for the latest traffic conditions along the Thruway.\n\nDepartment of Public Service\n\nUtility companies regulated by the Department of Public Service have approximately 5,500 workers available statewide to engage in repair and restoration efforts for the winter weather system this weekend. DPS staff will track utilities' work throughout the event and ensure utility companies shift appropriate staffing to regions that experience the greatest impact. If your service is interrupted, visit the DPS Utility Service Interruptions website for tips.\n\nNew York State Police\n\nState Police continues to monitor weather conditions and is deploying additional Troopers to impacted areas as needed. All State Police four-wheel drive and specialized vehicles, including snowmobiles, airboats, and utility terrain vehicles are staged and necessary equipment is being utilized for immediate response as needed. All emergency power and communications equipment are functioning appropriately.\n\nNew York State Department of Environmental Conservation\n\nDEC Emergency Management staff, Environmental Conservation Police Officers, Forest Rangers, and regional staff remain on alert and continue to monitor the developing situation and weather forecasts. DEC is coordinating resource deployment with agency partners and all available assets to targeted areas in preparation for potential impacts due to heavy snow.\n\nDEC reminds those responsible for the removal and disposal of snow to follow best management practices to help prevent flooding and reduce the potential for pollutants like salt, sand, oils, trash, and other debris in snow from affecting water quality. Disposal of snow in local creeks and streams can create ice dams which may cause flooding in nearby areas. Public and private snow removal operators should be aware of these safety issues during and after winter storms. Additional information is available online here.\n\nNew York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation\n\nNew York State Park Police and park personnel are on alert and closely monitoring weather conditions and impacts. Response equipment is being fueled, tested, and prepared for storm response use. State Parks has sawyer crews in Western New York and the North Country on standby for deployment for potential road clearing operations.\n\nSafety Tips\n\nWinter Weather\n\nService snow removal equipment. Use rock salt to melt ice on walkways, and sand to generate traction.\n\nWinterize your home and have heating sources inspected annually.\n\nIf you use heating oil, maintain an adequate supply.\n\nHave safe, emergency heating equipment available and use according to manufacturer’s instructions.\n\nInstall and check smoke alarms.\n\nProtect water pipes from freezing.\n\nTraveling in Winter Weather\n\nSome of the most important tips for safe driving include:\n\nDo not drive unless necessary.\n\nIf you must travel, make sure your car is stocked with survival gear like blankets, a shovel, flashlight and extra batteries, extra warm clothing, set of tire chains, battery booster cables, quick energy foods and brightly colored cloth to use as a distress flag.\n\nIf you have a cell phone or other communications device such as a two-way radio available for your use, keep the battery charged and keep it with you whenever traveling. If you should become stranded, you will be able to call for help, advising rescuers of your location.\n\nThe leading cause of death and injuries during winter storms is transportation accidents. Before getting behind the wheel, make sure that your vehicle is clear of ice and snow; good vision is key to good driving. Plan your stops and keep more distance between cars. Be extra alert and remember that snowdrifts can hide smaller children. Always match your speed to the road and weather conditions.\n\nIt is important for motorists on all roads to note that snowplows travel at speeds up to 35 mph, which in many cases is lower than the posted speed limit, to ensure that salt being dispersed stays in the driving lanes and does not scatter off the roadways. Oftentimes on interstate highways, snowplows will operate side by side, as this is the most efficient and safe way to clear several lanes at one time.\n\nMotorists and pedestrians should also keep in mind that snowplow drivers have limited lines of sight, and the size and weight of snowplows can make it very difficult to maneuver and stop quickly. Snow blowing from behind the plow can severely reduce visibility or cause whiteout conditions. Motorists should not attempt to pass snowplows or follow too closely. The safest place for motorists to drive is well behind the snowplows where the roadway is clear and salted. Never attempt to pass a snowplow while its operating.\n\nPower Outages\n\nPlanning:\n\nIf you use medication that requires refrigeration, most can be kept in a closed refrigerator for several hours without a problem - check with your physician or pharmacist.\n\nIf you have space in your refrigerator or freezer, consider filling plastic containers with water, leaving an inch of space inside each one –this will help keep food cold if the power goes out.\n\nPlan to have an alternative cooking source, such as a camp stove or outdoor grill. Follow appropriate safety rules for its use outside the residence.\n\nConsider buying a generator and follow the rules for using it outside the residence. Before installing a generator, be sure to properly disconnect from your utility electrical service. If possible, have your generator installed by a qualified electrician.\n\nHave extra blankets, coats, hats, and gloves on hand to keep warm.\n\nIf you have a computer, back up files and operating systems regularly. Turn off all computers, monitors, and other devices when they are not being used.\n\nIf you have an electric garage door opener, locate the manual release level, and learn how to operate.\n\nIf you have a telephone instrument or system that requires electricity to work, plan for alternate communication such as a standard tele-phone handset, cellular telephone, or radio.\n\nWhat to Do If the Power Goes Out\n\nTurn off or disconnect major appliances and other equipment, e.g., computers, in case of a momentary power surge that can damage these devices. Keep one light turned on so you know when power returns. Consider using surge protectors wherever you use electronic equipment.\n\nCall your utility provider to notify them of the outage and listen to local broadcasts for official information. Check with your utility to determine area repair schedules.\n\nCheck to see if neighbors and those with access or functional needs have power.\n\nUse only flashlights for emergency lighting - candles pose the risk of fire.\n\nKeep refrigerators and freezer doors closed - most food requiring refrigeration can be kept safely in a closed refrigerator for several hours. An unopened refrigerator will keep food cold for approximately four (4) hours. A full freezer will keep the temperature for about 48 hours.\n\nDo not use a charcoal grill indoors and do not use a gas stove for heat - they could give off harmful levels of carbon monoxide.\n\nStay warm by dressing in layers and minimizing time spent outdoors. Be aware of cold stress symptoms (i.e., hypothermia) and seek proper medical attention if symptoms appear.\n\nClose off rooms you do not need.\n\nTo Report an Electric Outage, Call:\n\nCentral Hudson: 800-527-2714\n\nCon Edison: 800-752-6633\n\nNational Grid: 800-867-5222\n\nNYSEG: 800-572-1131\n\nO&R: 877-434-4100\n\nPSEG-LI: 800-490-0075\n\nRG&E: 800-743-1701\n\nHeating Safety\n\nUse only safe sources of alternative heat such as a fireplace, small well-vented wood or coal stove or portable space heaters.\n\nWhen using alternative heat sources such as a fireplace, woodstove, etc. always make sure you have proper ventilation. Always follow manufacturer's instructions.\n\nKeep curtains, towels, and potholders away from hot surfaces.\n\nHave a fire extinguisher and smoke detectors and make sure they work.\n\nIf you use kerosene heaters to supplement your regular heating fuel, or as an emergency source of heat, follow these safety tips:\n\nFollow the manufacturers' instructions.\n\nUse only the correct fuel for your unit.\n\nRefuel outdoors only and only when the unit is cool.\n\nKeep the heater at least three feet away from furniture and other flammable objects.\n\nWhen using the heater, use fire safeguards and ventilate properly.\n\nFor more winter safety tips, visit dhses.ny.gov/safety.
