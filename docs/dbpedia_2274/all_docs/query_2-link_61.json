        "text": "In our Church ……\n\nThe Feast of Our Lady of Fatima\n\nThe story begins in the village of Fatima, Portugal, on May 13, 1917. Near that tiny village, the Blessed Virgin Mary appeared to three young peasant children: Francisco, Jacinta, and Lucia; ages 10, 9 and 7. As was the custom, these youngsters were tending their family’s sheep when “a Lady all in white, more brilliant than the sun… indescribably beautiful,” standing above a bush, appeared to the youngsters. From May through October 1917, the Lady appeared and spoke to the children on the 13th day of each month.\n\nNews of these apparitions began to spread throughout the region. The children recounted that the Virgin told them that God had sent her with a message for every man, woman, and child living in the century. She promised that God would grant peace to the entire world if Her requests for prayer, reparation and consecration were heard and obeyed. When it became known the Lady would visit the children for the last time on October 13, 1917, and had promised a sign that would convince the world she had appeared, many pilgrims made plans to attend. Nearly 70,000 people journeyed through the heavy rain and mud to the place of the previous apparitions to witness the predicted miracle.\n\nAfter what has become to be known as “The Miracle of the Sun,” the children were asked many times about what they had seen and been told. Their story never changed. The heart of Our Lady’s message to the world is contained in what has become known as the “Secret,” which she confided to the children in July 1917. The “Secret” actually consists of three parts. The first part of the “Secret” contained an urgent plea from Our Lady for acts of prayer and sacrifice to save souls, with particular emphasis on praying of the rosary and devotion to the Immaculate Heart of Mary.\n\nThe second part of the “Secret” specifically prophesied the outbreak of World War II. The third part was not revealed until 2000. Its revelation coincided with the beatification of Francisco and Jacinta. The vision supported and affirmed the immense suffering endured by witnesses of the faith in the last century of the second millennium.\n\nAdapted from: https://fatimachurchabq.org/our-lady-of-fatima-miracle\n\nOur Lady Help Of Christians\n\nThe Blessed Virgin Mary is a beautiful, beloved and essential figure in Christian life and in the Church’s calendar. She has been since the early days of the Church. Her feasts are as varied as the cultures of the world, with each having special traditions and customs. For example, the Church honours Mary every Saturday, recalling both the one full day that Jesus spent in the tomb and the traditional belief that Mary was the disciple who best kept the faith on that day.\n\nOn May 13, we commemorate the Memorial of Our Lady of Fatima which recalls the appearance of the Blessed Virgin to three young children in Portugal in 1917. Mary encouraged penance, conversion and praying the rosary, warning the world of a Great War and suffering, but that, “In the end, my Immaculate Heart will triumph“.\n\nThe Feast of Our Lady, Help of Christians, which is celebrated on May 24, dates back to the sixteenth century, which was not a peaceful time in Europe. In 1571, Catholics throughout the continent joined in praying the rosary in hopes of prevailing over military forces that had long sought to expand into Europe. These prayers were answered at the Battle of Lepanto on October 7, 1571, which is now the feast for Our Lady of the Rosary.\n\nMary Help of Christians, Patroness of Australia and of the Military Ordinariate\n\nTo rejoice in Mary is to celebrate God’s greatest creation – the vessel he fashioned to be his own mother, the woman who would bear him into the world. In the life of the “handmaid of the Lord,” we learn what it means to say “yes” to life in the Lord and to discover in him the meaning of life.\n\nWith maternal love for us, Mary wants what is best for us – she wants Jesus for us, so she urges us, “Do whatever he tells you” (John 2:5). Then she helps us as we lead others to know and love her Son too. Her feasts not only empower us to turn to her in prayer, but also to love Jesus and others with a greater love.\n\nSolemnity of the Ascension of Christ 21 May\n\nOn Sunday we celebrate the Ascension of Jesus into heaven. But what does this mean? In 2011 Emeritus Pope Benedict XVI wrote the following about the meaning of the ascension:\n\n[The ascension of Jesus] expresses our belief that in Christ human nature, the humanity in which we all share, has entered into the inner life of God in a new and hitherto unheard of way. It means that man has found an everlasting place in God.\n\nHeaven is not a place beyond the stars, but something much greater, something that requires far more audacity to assert: Heaven means that man now has a place in God. The basis for this assertion is the interpenetration of humanity and divinity in the crucified and exalted man Jesus. Christ, the man who is in God and eternally one with God, is at the same time God’s abiding openness to all human beings. Thus, Jesus himself is what we call “heaven”; heaven is not a place but a person, the person of him in whom God and man are forever and inseparably one. And we go to heaven and enter into heaven to the extent that we go to Jesus Christ and enter into him. In this sense, “ascension into heaven” can be something that takes place in our everyday lives.\n\nFor the disciples, the “ascension” was not what we usually misinterpret it as being: the temporary absence of Christ from the world. It meant rather his new, definitive, and irrevocable presence by participation in God’s royal power… God has a place for man!… In God there is a place for us!…”Be consoled, flesh and blood, for in Christ you have taken possession of heaven and of God’s kingdom!” (Tertullian)\n\nhttps://www.catholiceducation.org/en/religion-and-philosophy/spiritual-life/the-meaning-of-the-ascension.html\n\nAs Anthony Cleary, The Director of Mission and Identity at Sydney Catholic Schools explains: Today we associate a witness as someone who gives testimony to events that they have viewed or experienced. The disciples could certainly have done this. In Church Tradition however witness has more significant and powerful connotations, evoking a notion of martyrdom. Within the early Church many Christians gave witness to their beliefs through their martyrdom. Christ’s chosen disciples exemplified this. Today however we are not called to give up our lives in a physical sense but at the same time we are reminded by Christ that “if anyone wants to be a follower of mine, let him renounce himself and take up his cross and follow me” (Mk 8:34). Like the disciples we are called to be witnesses to the Risen Lord in word, deed and in faith. Like the disciples, we are called to be witnesses who are “full of joy”.\n\nIn our Community……\n\nMother’s Day Mass\n\nIt was lovely so see so many mothers and daughters at the College last week to celebrate our beautiful Mother’s Day Mass and supper. We were very fortunate to have Fr Steve Drum from St Charles Ryde Parish, celebrated the Eucharist with our many mums and daughters. He provided a beautiful reflection of the blessing of mothers through sharing his personal recount of his own Mum and family which he linked to the Gospel reading of the Visitation and Mary as our role model. A huge thank you to all who participating in the mass; Mrs Nelly Khoury, Claudia Khoury, Mrs Alannah Comerford, Ellie Comerford, Jasmine Comerford, Mrs Robyn Christopoulos, Lola Christopoulos, Daniella Agostino, Katelyn Lopes, Isabelle Mourani, Francesca Papallo, Antonella Papallo and Mrs Jana Gibson. Thank you to Mrs Melinda Alvarez for her coordination of the supper. Thanks to the following staff who supported the event: Ms Samantha Ison, Ms Emma Pracey, Ms Emma Hughes, Mrs Caroline Marsh, Ms Jen Dove, Ms Angela Bowland, Mr Matthew Iskander, Ms Grace Spurr, Mrs Caterina Faro, Mrs Antonina Arcidiacono, Ms Clare Scott, Ms Virginia El-Koura, Mrs Erin Healey. Thanks also to Mrs Erin Healey’s Hospitality students who were involved in preparing the supper.\n\nIn our Curriculum……\n\nYear 7 Religious Education\n\nThis week we highlight the great work Year 7 are doing in their RE classes and Assessment Tasks.\n\nYear 7 students have been exploring the unit What it means to be Catholic. They have been identifying key beliefs, values and practices of the Catholic Tradition and explore how these influence the life of Catholic communities. Year 7 students have been examining the organisational structure of the Catholic Church and identifying significant people and events within it.\n\nThe Year 7 students enjoyed their first RE unit and were able to express their knowledge and understanding of this unit in their first RE Assessment Task. This is what they were asked to do:\n\nYou have been appointed by the College Principal, Dr Anne Ireland, to create a ‘Welcome to Marist Sisters’ College Woolwich Booklet’. Your aim is to welcome new staff and students to the MSCW Community and help them to understand the charism and values of Mary as a Marist Woman of Action. Your booklet may be distributed to new staff and students at the College during ‘O-Week’.\n\nThe Year 7 students did a wonderful job creating their booklets. I would like to congratulate Natalie Pirrello and Amelia Bykova-Agrawal on creating exceptional Welcome to Marist Sisters’ College Woolwich Booklets. Please see a sample of their booklets below.\n\nMrs Caroline Morizzi, Religious Education Coordinator\n\nThis article on College life meets The Archbishop’s Charter for Catholic Schools – Charter #1, #2"
