        "text": "France is witnessing a decreasing number of priestly ordinations.\n\nAccording to figures compiled by La Croix, 114 new priests will be ordained in the country during 2018. This is a significant decline compared to 2017 when 133 priests were ordained.\n\nOf these 114 priests, 82 are diocesan, including a dozen from new communities or societies of apostolic life. Six are members of the Emmanuel Community while four are from the Neocatechumenal Way.\n\nThe dioceses which have the most new priests this year are Bordeaux and Paris, with six ordinations each. The decline is quite stark in Paris, which had ten ordinations in 2017 and 11 in 2016.\n\nThe dioceses of Lyon, Versailles and Fréjus-Toulon followed with five each and Evry with four.\n\nOn the other hand, there are also 58 dioceses that will not have a single ordination this year.\n\nIn addition to the territorial dioceses, the Military Ordinariate has ordained one priest as has the Mission de France, which covers worker priests.\n\nThree priests were ordained for the Paris Foreign Missions Society and will carry out their priestly ministry in the churches of Asia.\n\nTraditionalist communities produce 20 percent of new priests\n\nReligious congregations and communities will ordain 32 men this year. The Community of St. Martin leads the pack with eight ordinations to the priesthood. It expects to ordain another nine within a year.\n\nIn line with the trend in 2017, traditionalist communities that celebrate the pre-Vatican II Latin Mass, now called the “Extraordinary form of the Roman Rite”, continue to foster priestly vocations at a rapid rate\n\nYoung French priests are particularly well represented in this group. Three of them will be ordained for the Institute of the Good Shepherd, two for the Fraternity of St. Peter and two for the Institute of Christ the King.\n\nIn total, nearly 20 percent of priests ordained this year come from communities regarded as “traditional” or “classical” in orientation.\n\nDiscrepancies in statistics\n\nThe statistics compiled by La Croix differ from those issued by the Episcopal Conference of France (CEF) in June. This was also the case in 2017.\n\nIn fact, after having announced 117 ordinations in 2017, the CEF announced 125 for 2018. Thus, in contrast with La Croix, which recorded a decline, the CEF has observed a slight increase.\n\nThere are several reasons for this discrepancy. On one hand, the CEF has changed its method of calculation. But this year it included figures from the various religious communities, which it did not do last year. Among these are the Institute of the Good Shepherd and the Community of St. Martin.\n\nIn addition, the CEF included a number of foreign priests who were ordained in France, some of whom will serve for only a certain period in France or be at the service of communities whose mother house is in the country.\n\nThis is the case with the Community of St. John. Of its seven new priests this year, only two are French.\n\nNo longer as many priests as in the past\n\n“Previously, we based ourselves principally on the criterion of incardination (that is, the attachment of the priest to a diocese),” a CEF spokesperson said.\n\n“This year, we have given priority to the grassroots reality, counting priests who are effectively present in the dioceses,” the official continued.\n\nSimilarly, “members of certain congregations, such as the Vincentians and Eudists, have a community life, but are not properly speaking religious; so we have not counted them as such,” the CEF spokesperson said.\n\nThe CEF admits that these statistics are only an “evaluation” that gives an overall view. They do not claim to be exact.\n\nTwo lessons can be drawn from the figures. Firstly, it is astonishingly difficult, even for the CEF, to obtain precise figures.\n\nSecondly, the classical distinction between diocesan and religious priests no longer seems relevant to describe contemporary clergy."
