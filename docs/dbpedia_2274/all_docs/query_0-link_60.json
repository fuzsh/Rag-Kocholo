The Parish Pastoral Council for Responsible Voting (PPCRV), a church-backed poll watchdog, has requested data from the Commission on Elections' transparency server to investigate glitches that occurred during the Philippines' midterm elections. PPCRV chairperson Myla Villanueva said obtaining the server data could help determine if it matches the results from the central server and identify what caused the glitches. The group aims to ease public doubts by increasing transparency and understands the technical issues that occurred.",
