        "text": "The chaplaincy situation in the armed forces seems to be best regulated in the countries presented here at national level and at the same time, it seems to be the oldest one in comparison with the other sectors of the social sphere. One commonality across the countries presented here is that their armed forces dispose of military chaplaincy. Religious freedom for soldiers who have enlisted or are drafted into an organization that is not always capable of providing sufficient private sphere for such religious exercise is the main argument made in state-church regimes. In the military, religious freedom is mostly defined as a set of rights to practice one's religion including the right to access spiritual care. History After reading the national reports it is clear that the institution of military chaplaincy is a venerable one which has very deep roots placed in the history of each state and especially of each nation. In this way, a Romanian bishop said at the end of the 19 th century that we have a nation, because we had an Altar. In one form or another, depending on the national situation of each country, the military chaplaincy has existed in a recognizable form for more than 1600 years1. In fact, it is easy to observe this fact by reading the national reports where the army chaplaincy is founded very early in the national history of each European country. Actually the presence of the religious element extra murros ecclesiae, as chaplaincy in the armed forces is present all over Europe in different forms. The history of army chaplaincy goes back far in the history, and we can identify special army priests in 742 when the first German council2 took place in 1424, in Romania, in XVII century in Poland; the firstEnglishmilitary-oriented chaplains, for instance, were priests on board proto-naval vessels during the eighth century A.D. Land based chaplains appeared during the reign ofKing Edward I etc. As term, chaplaincy may not be found per seeven nowadays in some European societies, as is the case of the Balkan countries, but the spirit of this word is present in the institution of the military priest."
