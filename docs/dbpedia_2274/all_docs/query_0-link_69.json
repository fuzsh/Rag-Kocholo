        "text": "TERESA BENEDETTA\n\nIs Cardinal Schoenborn improbably trying to position himself as the successor to Bergoglio on Peter's Chair? I can think of no other reason for his apparent abandonment of all reason – and his reason, to begin with - in order to defend and buttress the indefensibly anti-Catholic positions of Bergoglio in AL. Apparently he does not think that being European will not be a handicap for him against an Asian or African papabile in the next Conclave. If so, his self-delusion is complete... Christopher Ferrara slams Schoenborn as hard as anyone can for his astonishingly anti-Christian defense of AL in Ireland recently.\n\nCardinal Christoph Schönborn:\n\nSophist in Chief\n\nby Christopher A. Ferrara\n\nFATIMA NETWORK PERSPECTIVES\n\nJuly 25, 2017\n\nSophistry is the use of subtly deceptive reasoning or argumentation to mislead the hearer. Perhaps sophistry is too generous a description of Cardinal Christoph Schönborn’s defense of the idea, introduced into the Church via Chapter 8 of Amoris Laetitia (AL), that people living in “second marriages” condemned by Our Lord Himself as adultery can receive absolution and Holy Communion while continuing to live as if they were married and indulging in the marital act.\n\nSchönborn’s arguments are not particularly subtle and could be refuted by any well-catechized child. But let us give him the benefit of the doubt and say that he is a sophist as opposed to someone who simply makes patently ridiculous arguments.\n\nDuring the same speech in western Ireland in which he revealed that he had (ludicrously) assured Pope Francis that AL is perfectly orthodox after it had already been published, Schönborn proposed one sophism after another in defense of Holy Communion for persistent public adulterers.\n\nWhile maintaining that AL upholds the Church’s infallible teaching on the indissolubility of marriage, Schönborn argued that “giving this answer is not an answer to all the single situations and cases that in everyday life we have to deal with.”\n\nNONSENSE. Our Lord Himself has given the “answer to all the single situations and cases” involving divorce and purported “remarriage”¬ — they all constitute adultery: “Whosoever shall put away his wife and marry another, committeth adultery against her. And if the wife shall put away her husband, and be married to another, she committeth adultery.” (Mark 10:11-12) Adultery is an intrinsic evil, always and everywhere wrong. There are no “single situations and cases” in which adultery can be treated as if it were not adultery for purposes of admission to the Sacraments.\n\n“Much more difficult is discernment,” Schönborn continued, “because you have to look closely, yes, in the light of the principles, but also at reality, where people stand, what is the drama of how did they come to a separation, to a new union, and so on.”\n\nNONSENSE. There is no gap between the moral law laid down by God and “reality” or “where people stand.” The moral precept is reality — a reality inscribed in human nature itself as a precept of the natural law that binds all men, no matter where they claim to “stand” or what “drama” they recite. Schönborn here proposes nothing other than the evil of situation ethics, which would destroy the entire moral edifice of the Church by reducing morality to a mere set of “general rules” that may or may not apply in a given situation.\n\nAnd that is exactly what AL purports to do:\n\n- “Therefore, while upholding a general rule, it is necessary to recognize that responsibility with respect to certain actions or decisions is not the same in all cases.” AL 302)\n\n- “It is true that general rules set forth a good which can never be disregarded or neglected, but in their formulation they cannot provide absolutely for all particular situations.” AL 304)\n\nNeed it be demonstrated that the appearance of such statements in a papal document is a catastrophe — indeed, a stage in the “final battle” over marriage and family of which Sister Lucia warned Cardinal Caffarra?\n\n“Moral theology stands on two feet,” said Schönborn. “Principles, and then the prudential steps to apply them to reality…. The question of discernment is the key question for the right handling of right relation between principles and concrete application.”\n\nNONSENSE. The negative precepts of the natural law, including “Thou Shalt Not Commit Adultery” — which is what Schönborn is here addressing — apply in the same way to all people regardless of their situation. There are no “prudential steps to apply to reality” nor any problem of “concrete application” of the divine and natural law forbidding adultery. People engaged in adulterous relations are obliged to cease those relations if they wish to be admitted to the Sacraments, no less than the Mafiosi that Pope Francis threatens to excommunicate must cease their lives of crime against the natural law.\n\n“The bonum possibile in moral theology is an important concept that has been so often neglected. What is the possible good that a person or a couple can achieve in difficult circumstances?”\n\nThe worst NONSENSE of all, as it reduces universally binding, exceptionless moral precepts to mere guidelines or benchmarks toward which people need only do the best they can under the circumstances, or what they deem “possible” for themselves. The Sixth Commandment thus becomes “Thou Shalt Do Thy Best Not to Commit Adultery.”\n\nThis sophist is the moral voice of the current pontificate. If this situation is not apocalyptic, then words have lost their meaning. We can only await, with fear and trembling, God’s dramatic resolution of a crisis unlike any the Church has seen before, in which even the foundations of the moral law are now under attack at the very summits of the Church.\n\nThe other very vivid reaction to Schoenborn's Bergoglideological descant in Ireland comes from Fr Vaverek, who has been a priest of the Diocese of Austin since 1985 and is currently pastor of parishes in Gatesville and Hamilton. His doctoral studies were in Dogmatics with a focus on Ecclesiology, Apostolic Ministry, Newman, and Ecumenism.\n\nA diptych for Cardinal Schönborn\n\nBy Fr. Timothy V. Vaverek\n\nTHE CATHOLIC THING\n\nJuly 25, 2017\n\nDuring a talk in Ireland, Cardinal Christoph Schönborn revealed that he had suggested to Benedict XVI that St. John Paul II’s Familiaris Consortio (FC) and Francis's Amoris Laetitia (AL) can be viewed as a sort of “diptych,” a pairing of artistic works that illuminates and transcends the meaning of each element. Benedict – he says – concurred, but did not accept the further assertion that FC is Platonic and AL is Aristotelean.\n\n[Dear Lord, I had not realized that the 'Sophist in Chief' had made such an outrageous claim which, of course, he knows Benedict XVI has no way of denying or refuting! It is terribly unfair of the Sophist to 'instrumentalize' Benedict XVI in this way. And of course, all the traditionalist-conservative voices who already have consigned Benedict XVI to the same infernal niche where they have consigned Bergoglio will jump at this 'testimonial' to prove their point…\n\nDiptych schmiptych! To even think of pairing the two documents is sacrilege in itself. In what way can a document that purveys falsehoods contradicting Jesus's own words be paired with a document that upholds in every way possible the splendor of Truth which is Christ himself – much less illuminate and transcend any Christian teaching at all? What shameless chutzpah for Schoenborn to even suggest that Benedict XVI would have concurred with his pairing!!!]\n\nThe Cardinal’s anecdote and subsequent discussion of morality suggest it might be good to consider his remarks in light of another diptych: Raphael’s Vatican frescos of The School of Athens and Disputation of the Holy Sacrament.\n\nThe Cardinal’s claim implies that John Paul’s theology of marriage and the family expresses idealistic principles, whereas Francis’s realism allows us to apply those principles to the nitty-gritty of daily life. Raphael famously depicted these contrasting philosophical approaches in the two central figures of the School of Athens: Plato, the idealist, whose raised hand points to the heavens, and Aristotle, the realist, whose outstretched hand is turned to the earth.\n\nRaphael, The School of Athens, 1509.\n\nThat the Cardinal wants to read AL as a realist interpretation of the alleged idealism of FC is evident from his description of the moral life. He maintains that “Moral Theology stands on two feet: Principles, and then the prudential steps to apply them to reality.” For him, this is carried out through a discernment of conscience, which interprets the ideals within the context of human limitations. This produces a “right relation between principles and concrete application.”\n\nThe Cardinal praises AL for encouraging “a responsible personal and pastoral discernment of all particular [marriage] cases.” Once complete, this discernment can then address the question of reception of Holy Communion.\n\nThe difficulty with approaches like this is that they are founded on an inadequate premise.\n\nChristian morality does not stand on two feet; it stands on the person of Jesus who is the principle – the source – of our moral life. Morality is nothing other than living united to Christ. In turn, Moral Theology is fundamentally the study of Jesus and our life in Him, not of abstract principles and their application\n\nThe teachings and commands of the Gospel are not philosophical expressions needing rational analysis to be validated and, then, implemented in daily life. They are the words and deeds of Jesus, the Word of God made flesh, which reveal to us in a humanly understandable way who God is and who we are. Jesus expresses the truth, which, as such, is already attuned to the realities of life.\n\nWhen Jesus says, “you shall not commit adultery” or “whoever divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery,” He is not presenting an ideal or something that cannot be adequately put into words. He is announcing the concrete truth about Himself and is assuring us that, as the faithful God who has become the Bridegroom, He will never abandon us. He is also describing in unequivocal terms the reality of marriage, fidelity, and indissolubility.\n\nWere these divine prohibitions merely abstract principles, then conscience would doubtless still find reasons for permitting remarriage after divorce. This would happen, not because such reasons are realistic or legitimate, but because without grace, fallen human judgment and concupiscence have rarely led to the discernment that marriage is, by nature, indissoluble. Jesus revealed this truth as a remedy for our weakness and to foster our well-being. Consciences that erroneously “discern” otherwise, therefore, cause suffering and need healing.\n\nRaphael, The Disputation of the Holy Sacrament, 1508\n\nThis brings us to Raphael’s diptych. The philosophers of Athens discuss wisdom in an entirely earthly setting surrounded by statues of mythical gods; the participants in the Disputation are united to each other and to the saints in heaven in giving worship to the living God who, in the person of the Word, has taken flesh as Jesus, who is in glory, and is present as the Eucharistic Host on the altar.\n\nThe earthly “disputants” are not engaged in partisan disagreement about who is adored in the Sacrament, but are instead discussing the wonder of that reality as members of the body of Christ, the Church.\n\nRaphael’s frescos remind us that fallen human reason can discern much, but does not entirely free itself from error (note the idols) or reach agreement regarding ultimate truths (Plato and Aristotle point in contrary directions), while God’s self-revelation in Christ gathers us in the Church to know, love, and praise him even as we seek to penetrate more deeply the mysterious reality of God and His works.\n\nChrist’s nuptial union with the Church is, like the Eucharist, a reality rather than an ideal. And it reveals the reality of human marriage. (Eph. 5:31-32) The Gospel teaching appears “idealistic” only because the Fall has clouded reason and weakened the will as regards the reality of marriage in the face of life’s difficulties. Through Faith, the reality of marriage – and the impossibility of a second union after divorce – stands out as clearly as the Eucharist.\n\nContrary beliefs and practices do not help anyone but keep them from knowing Christ more deeply and leave them suffering needlessly from the unrealities of their lives. Methods of discernment like the one proposed by the Cardinal cannot assist those in need or their priests. [How can Bergoglio and his theoretician/theologians fail to see that what they call 'discernment', which in their usage is equivalent to that 'primacy of individual conscience' which is a mantra of New Age, post-1968 modern man, really means that the individual sets himself up as the sole and best judge of what is good, without regard for objective goodness embodied by Christ himself, and that to do so is ultimately, self-deification? Bergoglio and company are, in effect, justifying and encouraging modern man's rejection of God.]\n\nWithout precise Christological criteria, fallen human reason and concupiscence cannot be expected to arrive at an accurate assessment of a first marriage, a second union, or the reception of Communion. All the more so when our Lord’s explicit prohibitions are treated as mere ideals. Such approaches are manifestly inadequate and unrealistic.\n\nAs long as Christian morality and doctrine are viewed as idealistic principles, their concrete meaning in life will be held hostage to the endless debates of diverse schools of philosophy and theology. Only when they are viewed within the Church as realities rooted in Christ and embraced in daily life will we be able to discover in them the true meaning of marriage, family, and all our joys and sorrows.\n\nBTW, if you did not barf enough at Schoenborn's elaborate calisthenics with the truth, you probably will effect an unscheduled and most unpleasant purgation with this slavering article by John Allen.\n\nhttps://cruxnow.com/analysis/2017/07/23/can-anything-burst-popes-media-bubble-nah-probably-not/?platform=hootsuite\n\nP.S. This piece really belongs here...\n\nAs the pope persists in refusing\n\nto answer the DUBIA himself,\n\nSchönborn et al speak for him\n\nA Roman prelate answers the Viennese cardinal's latest defense of AL\n\nAdapted from the English service of\n\nSETTIMO CIELO\n\nSandro Magister's blog\n\nJuly 25, 2017\n\nI have received this from an authoritative churchman and have agreed to publish it without revealing his name.\n\nEveryone is responding to the DUBIA\n\nexcept the pope. This time, Schönborn again…\n\nby ***\n\nOn July 13, 2017, Cardinal Christoph Schönborn, archbishop of Vienna, spoke for four hours in two conferences and a question-and-answer session at Mary Immaculate College in Limerick, Ireland.\n\nThe Austrian cardinal spoke in the context of the event \"Let's Talk Family: Let's Be Family,” which is part of a series of assemblies organized in preparation for the World Meeting of Families (1), under the direction of the new Vatican super-dicastery for the laity, family, and life, which will be held in Dublin from August 21-28, 2018.\n\nAfter reading the reporting on the event offered by the main specialized media outlets (2), I cannot help but note that when it comes to the DUBIA submitted to the pope by four cardinals, everyone is answering them except he himself; and that in this way, the chaotic chorus of most disparate comments and interpretations of “Amoris Laetitia” - which do anything but clarify for the faithful and confessors the problems raised by the document – has been further obscured by a new fog.\n\nThis is because the arguments offered by the archbishop of Vienna - at least as they have been reported by the most reliable media - are anything but convincing. Let’s take a look at the main ones.\n\n1. An inopportune reprimand\n\nIn the first place, Schönborn reprimands the cardinals for even bringing up the DUBIA. Because they asked respectfully for an audience, he accuses them of having pressured the pope, i.e., they could have asked for an audience, but without saying so publicly. Here are the exact words of the Austrian archbishop:\n\n“That cardinals, who should be the closest collaborators of the pope, try to force him, to put pressure on him to give a public response to their publicized, personal letter to the pope - this is absolutely inconvenient behavior, I’m sorry to say. If they want to have an audience with the pope, they ask for an audience; but they do not publish that they asked for an audience.”\n\nI wonder if Cardinal Schönborn has read and/or believes in the following words this pope has said about the discussions that had already arisen over the course of the two 'family synods' he convoked in 2014 and 2015, which has then continued [and intensified] after the publication of his AL. I present just a few passages:\n\n“One general and basic condition is this: speaking honestly. Let no one say: ‘I cannot say this, they will think this or this of me….’ It is necessary to say with parrhesia all that one feels. After the last Consistory (February 2014), in which the family was discussed, a Cardinal wrote to me, saying: what a shame that several Cardinals did not have the courage to say certain things out of respect for the Pope, perhaps believing that the Pope might think something else. This is not good, this is not synodality, because it is necessary to say all that, in the Lord, one feels the need to say: without polite deference, without hesitation. And, at the same time, one must listen with humility and welcome, with an open heart, what your brothers say. Synodality is exercised with these two approaches.”… (3)\n\n“Personally I would be very worried and saddened if it were not for these temptations and these animated discussions; this movement of the spirits, as St Ignatius called it if all were in a state of agreement, or silent in a false and quietist peace.” …(4)\n\n“The complexity of the issues that arose revealed the need for continued open discussion of a number of doctrinal, moral, spiritual, and pastoral questions.”… (5)\n\n“Have the courage to teach us that it is easier to build bridges than to raise walls!” …(6)\n\nPope Francis does nothing other than speak of parrhesia, of synodality, of making not walls but bridges.\n\n- He has said that he would have been concerned and saddened if there had not been animated discussions during the synod.\n\n- He has written in the very document that is the object of these animated discussions, meaning in “Amoris Laetitia,” that there is a “need for continued open discussion of a number of doctrinal, moral, spiritual, and pastoral questions.”\n\nAnd now this same pontiff, in spite of the aforementioned words, decides not to receive four cardinals who have humbly and legitimately asked for an audience. . . And they were supposed to have said nothing about this refusal? Cardinal Schönborn really has a strange concept of parrhesia!\n\nBut after this baseless complaint on the part of the archbishop of Vienna, we come to the more doctrinal questions.\n\n- “Moral theology stands on two feet: Principles and then the prudential steps to apply them to reality.”\n\n- In ‘Amoris Laetitia’ Francis “often comes back to what he said in 'Evangelii Gaudium', that a little step towards the good done under difficult circumstances can be more valuable than a moral solid life under comfortable circumstances.”\n\n- “The bonum possibil’ in moral theology is an important concept that has been so often neglected. […] What is the possible good that a person or a couple can achieve in difficult circumstances?”\n\nLet’s begin to analyze the first statement. What are the prudential steps for applying the principles of morality to reality?\n\nPrudence, recta ratio agibilium [Aristotle’s definition of prudence as ‘right reason applied to practice'] selects the means in view of the end; it does not select them arbitrarily, but is bound to the truth. As a result, prudence, in order to be such, cannot choose evil means, or intrinsically evil acts, that are necessarily always imprudent. In fact, a prudent act must be good in itself; if it is not good, it is not prudent. And to make an act good - and therefore potentially also prudent - intentions or circumstances are not always sufficient.\n\nThis is what the Church infallibly proposes for belief. Saint John Paul II taught this in the encyclical Veritatis Splendor:\n\n“Each of us knows how important is the teaching which represents the central theme of this Encyclical and which is today being restated with the authority of the Successor of Peter. Each of us can see the seriousness of what is involved, not only for individuals but also for the whole of society, with the reaffirmation of the universality and immutability of the moral commandments, particularly those which prohibit always and without exception intrinsically evil acts.” (7)\n\nThe end never justifies the means, therefore the end never makes an evil action prudent or proportionate to the ultimate end. So if it is true that “moral theology stands on two feet: Principles, and then the prudential steps to apply them to reality,” the cohabitation more uxorio of two persons who are not man and wife will never be a prudent application of the principles to the objective reality. (8)\n\nThe second statement praises small steps toward the good, above all those that are taken in a state of difficulty. But those actions which are always evil, regardless of the circumstances, are never a small step toward the good, but a step - more or less grave - toward the bad.\n\nMany small steps toward the good can be taken by persons living in a state of sin (charity, prayer, participation in the life of the Church, etc.), but what brings them closer to the good are certainly not the acts that constitute their state of sin: these are inevitably opposed to the journey toward the good, to the movement of the rational creature toward God, as Saint Thomas Aquinas would say.(9)\n\nThe third statement affirms the category of the possible good. This is a wonderful category if it is interpreted correctly (we think of the saying “Be good if you can” of Saint Philip Neri).\n\n- But it is misguided if one forgets the words of Saint Paul: “No temptation has overtaken you that is not common to man. God is faithful, and he will not let you be tempted beyond your strength, but with the temptation will also provide the way of escape, that you may be able to endure it” (10).\n\n- It is misguided if one goes against what has been infallibly defined by the Council of Trent: “But no one, however much justified, should consider himself exempt from the observance of the commandments; no one should use that rash statement, once forbidden by the Fathers under anathema, that the observance of the commandments of God is impossible for one that is justified.” (11)\n\n- It is misguided if, against the Catholic doctrine of justification, the doors should be opened - albeit in other terms - for invincible concupiscence of a Jansenist flavor, or to making social factors more influential than grace, or even than free will itself.\n\n3. “Amoris Laetitia” is Catholic: Schönborn guarantees it\n\nThe website Crux also reports one episode that the cardinal himself recounted:\n\n“Schönborn revealed that when he met the Pope shortly after the presentation of Amoris, Francis thanked him, and asked him if the document was orthodox. ‘I said, Holy Father, it is fully orthodox,’ Schönborn told us he told the pope, adding that a few days later he received from Francis a little note that said: ‘Thank you for that word. That gave me comfort’.”\n\n[Of course, others have pointed out right away that if Bergoglio himself had to ask Schönborn if AL was ‘orthodox’, it means he himself realized or knew it may have crossed the line into heterodoxy, or worse. Maybe he should have consulted theologians from the other side of the ‘ideological’ divide in the Church – not a sycophant like Schoenborn or a fence-straddler like Mueller - before he even published the exhortation.]\n\nThis account – even if it indicates the humility of Francis in asking for a judgment from his trusted theologians, does not change the fact that it should be the pope who gives responses to the theologians, to the bishops, to the cardinals - who with the required parrhesia and the encouragement of the pontiff himself express to him their grave preoccupations over the state of the Church. This, in fact, is truly divided and wounded by the contrasting interpretations with which “Amoris Laetitia” has been proposed by various episcopates.\n\n4. Conclusion\n\nCardinal Carlo Caffarra, in a speech before the scholastic committee of the Veritatis Splendor Institute of Bologna (12), identified some of the current challenges to which Christians have to respond: relativism, amoralism, and individualism.\n\nAbout amoralism, the then-archbishop of Bologna said:“I have spoken of amorality in a precise sense. In the sense that the statement according to which ‘there exist acts which, per se and in themselves, independently of circumstances, are always seriously wrong’ (Ap. ex. 'Reconciliatio et Penitentia' 17; EV 9/1123], has no foundation, [according to the present-day mentality].”\n\nCardinal Caffarra then warned against some pseudo-solutions to the aforementioned problems:\n\n“One first pseudo-solution is the evasion of the true and serious confrontation with these challenges. An evasion that generically assumes the face of fideism, of the rejection of the truthful dimension of the Christian faith. It is a real and proper lack of engagement, not necessarily intentional, in the serious and rigorous confrontation on the properly cultural level. It is evasion in a faith that is solely articulated and not examined, solely affirmed and not considered.”\n\nEvasion “in a faith that is solely articulated and not examined!” How many times do we hear the articulation of the words mercy, conscience, maturity, responsibility, etc., but with the rejection of a true search for the intellectus fidei, of the profound understanding of the reasons for faith. [Yeah, well, we really cannot expect this pope to give us - nor even lead us to - a profound understanding of anything, because he has nothing but boilerplate platitudes that sound meaningless or even absurd, pseudo-erudite phrases that amount to balderdash, and shallow ideas that are usually quite fallacious!]\n\nSchönborn’s argumentations have been situated ante litteram precisely by these considerations of Cardinal Caffarra concerning the substantial rejection (not necessarily intentional) of the “truthful dimension of the Christian faith”:\n\n-\"etsi veritas non daretur,” as if the immutable truth about man and the sacraments did not exist;\n\n- “etsi bonum non daretur,” as if there there were not an objective good to be done and an equally objective evil to be avoided, both of which are not determined but are discovered and chosen freely by man in conscience;\n\n- “etsi gratia non daretur,” as if man were forgotten by God in a situation-trap, where there is no other choice but to sin.\n\nFOOTNOTES\n\n(1) For more information see: www.worldmeeting2018.ie\n\n(2) Because Cardinal Schönborn’s statements have not been published in their entirety, I refer to what was reported on the website “Crux”, which among the websites consulted was the one that seemed most complete to us.

Antonio Spadaro, and by Marcelo Figueroa, the Argentinian Presbyterian minister chosen by Pope Francis to be the editor of the Argentinean edition of L’Osservatore Romano, which subsequently republished the article.\n\nSince articles in La Civilta Cattolica are vetted by the Vatican secretary of state, since L’Osservatore Romano is the Vatican’s own newspaper, and especially since both Spadaro and Figueroa are reputed to be close to Pope Francis, this article has garnered enormous attention in Catholic circles.\n\nAlso noteworthy is the article’s thesis: a contrast between what it terms “Pope Franciss’ geopolitics” and an “ecumenism of hate,” the authors’ term for the alliance between American Evangelical Protestants and Catholics, who have been drawn together “around such themes as abortion, same-sex marriage, religious education in schools and other matters generally considered moral or tied to values.”\n\nThe first point to note, of course, is that the “geopolitics” of a particular pope are not matters of faith and morals, and the faithful are free to disagree with them. The authors concede as much when they use their essay to attack, of all things, the Holy Roman Empire, the entity created when Pope Leo III crowned Charlemagne on Christmas Day in 800 and whose leader was prayed for by name in the Easter Exsultet for centuries.\n\nNo Catholic need have any more deference to what Spadaro and Figueroa claim, accurately or not, to be Pope Francis’s political vision than Spadaro and Figueroa show to the political vision of the many popes who supported the ideal of Catholic monarchy for centuries, or indeed to the political vision of more recent pontiffs who had a warmer appreciation of political parties opposed to legalized abortion and homosexual marriage than Spadaro and Figueroa do.\n\nIndeed, it is odd that Spadaro and Figueroa single out for criticism, of all the political movements in the world, one centered on agreement on Catholic teaching pertaining to matters of faith and morals.\n\n- American Evangelicals were not behind the teaching of the Catechism of the Catholic Church that “The inalienable right to life of every innocent human individual is a constitutive element of a civil society and its legislation.” (CCC, Section 2273).\n\n- American Evangelicals did not lobby to have St. John Paul II declare, in Evangelium Vitae, that “direct abortion, that is, abortion willed as an end or as a means, always constitutes a grave moral disorder, since it is the deliberate killing of an innocent human being…. No circumstance, no purpose, no law whatsoever can ever make licit an act which is intrinsically illicit, since it is contrary to the Law of God which is written in every human heart, knowable by reason itself, and proclaimed by the Church.”\n\n- Nor were American Evangelicals the impetus behind Pope Francis’s declaration, in Amoris Laetitia, that “There are absolutely no grounds for considering homosexual unions to be in any way similar or even remotely analogous to God’s plan for marriage and family.”\n\nNot only does the “ecumenical convergence” between Evangelicals and Catholics center on matters of clear Catholic teaching, but, for many Evangelicals, this “convergence” represents a conversion. When Roe v Wade was decided, many Evangelicals were indifferent to the prospect of legalized abortion or even somewhat supportive. It was the Catholic Church that was the center of opposition to legalized abortion in America in 1973. One would think that this conversion would be a cause for joy in Catholic publications, but for Spadaro and Figueroa it represents instead an “ecumenism of hate.”\n\nThere are, of course, legitimate criticisms to be made of both American Evangelicals and American pro-lifers.\n\n- Many American Evangelicals subscribe to a theological anti-Catholicism, and they actively seek to convert Catholics to Protestantism. These efforts are particularly pronounced in Latin America, where the region’s historic shortage of priests has left many Catholics poorly catechized and easily persuaded by Protestant arguments they have never been taught to counter.\n\n- And many Republicans have been quite cynical in their professed opposition to Roe v Wade, which remained the law of the land even after professed pro-life Republicans had appointed a majority on the Supreme Court.\n\nBut, despite this political failure, the American pro-life movement has at least succeeded in keeping abortion alive as a moral issue. No matter how cynically many Republican politicians treat abortion, it is hard to say that the pro-abortion position has become dominant in America when a major political party claims to take the opposite position, its presidents profess to support the opposite position, and at least some of the justices on the Supreme Court continue to dissent from the decision that is the focus of the opposition.\n\nIndeed, no one who pays any attention to American life can fail to notice that a substantial portion of the population does not accept the morality of abortion. The same cannot be said for many other Western countries whose politics Spadaro and Figueroa do not criticize.\n\nNeedless to say, these are not the criticisms Spadaro and Figueroa offer of the “ecumenism of hate.” Instead, they offer a potpourri of contemporary leftist tropes.\n\n- They assert that those whose politics they disagree with are motivated by “hate.”\n\n- They suggest that opposition to the legalization of abortion and gay marriage represents “the nostalgic dream of a theocratic type of state” and a “direct virtual challenge to the secularity of the state,” the same positions advanced by secularists for decades.\n\n- They attack American Evangelicals for being “composed mainly of whites from the deep American South,” sounding remarkably like Hillary Clinton bemoaning the “basket of deplorables.”\n\n- They fret about “Islamophobia,” something that also worries The Guardian, The New York Times, and Der Spiegel, but something that probably did not bother St. Pius V, who prayed for the victory of the Christian fleet he was instrumental in assembling at Lepanto, the date of which is marked on the Church’s calendar by the Feast of Our Lady of the Rosary.\n\n- They worry about man-made global warming, which has become a matter of faith for the secular left but whose scientific basis is still being disputed in peer-reviewed scientific articles, including recent papers by Nikolov and Zeller and Wallace, D’Aleo, and Idso.\n\n- They claim an affiliation with the “ecumenism of hate” for Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan, George W. Bush, and of course Donald Trump, but they do not offer any criticism at all of any leftist politician, political coalition, or political figure.\n\nIndeed, it is hard to avoid the conclusion that the main purpose of their essay is to bring about an alliance between the Church and the left, an alliance made difficult not just by Catholic teachings on abortion and marriage but by those Catholics whose votes are determined by those teachings.\n\nThey also come very close to suggesting that any opposition to non-Western immigration to the West is illegitimate, attacking members of the “ecumenism of hate” for being worried about “the migrants and the Muslims” and attacking moves to “build barrier-fences crowned with barbed wire.”\n\nThe Church, however, has always taught that immigration is a prudential matter, with Pope Francis telling the Spanish newspaper El Pais that “each country has a right to control its borders, who enters and who leaves, and countries that are in danger —of terrorism or the like — have more right to control them.” [He did? It is a statement belied by everything else he has said and done about this issue!]\n\nSimilarly, the statement issued by Benedict XVI on immigration in 2010 indicated that states have the right to regulate migration and defend their frontiers, and also recognized the importance of respecting a country’s laws and its national identity.\n\nSpadaro and Figueroa completely ignore the weighty reasons supporting calls for immigration restriction in both America and Europe, preferring to wail about a “narrative of fear” instead.\n\n- But America has admitted tens of millions of immigrants in recent decades, a massive influx that has depressed wages and caused great social disruption in many American communities.\n\n- In Europe, an influx of Islamic immigrants has resulted in numerous instances of terrorism and mass murder.\n\n- And future immigration into Europe has the potential to dramatically, and permanently, alter the continent that has been the center of the Church for centuries.\n\nAt this writing, for example, many thousands of immigrants from the Mideast and Africa are hoping to be admitted into Italy. If everyone in the Mideast and Africa who wanted to come to Europe actually did, that number would be many millions.\n\nGiven the very low birthrates in Italy and the very high birthrates in Africa and parts of the Mideast, it is easy to imagine unfettered immigration producing an Italy where Italians were outnumbered in their own country. At some point, such an Italy would be what Metternich quipped it was, merely a geographic expression.\n\nIt is not clear, though, that Spadaro and Figueroa would be bothered by such a radically transformed Europe. They write that “the Christian roots of a people are never to be understood in an ethnic way.”\n\n- So much for Belloc’s “The Faith is Europe, and Europe is the Faith.” - So much for Ireland being “the Land of Saints and Scholars,” so much for France being “the Eldest Daughter of the Church,”\n\n- So much for Croatia being the “Antemurale Christianitatis,” a title bestowed by Leo X.\n\n- So much, too, for this passage from Norman Davies’s great history of Poland, “God’s Playground,” of which I have always been particularly fond:\n\n“The Church’s path, therefore, is strewn with ambiguities. Sometimes, no doubt, the Church has failed the Nation. Sometimes, no doubt, it has closed its eyes to social ills and to political injustices. Sometimes, no doubt, it has proved itself to be unworthy of the Faith. But of the central fact, that the Catholic Church embodies the most ancient and the most exalted ideals of traditional Polish life across the centuries, there can be no doubt whatsoever.”\n\nSpadaro and Figueroa also claim that the “ecumenism of hate” employs a “Manichean language that divides reality between absolute Good and absolute Evil.” And this tendency does exist in American politics, as shown by George W. Bush’s Second Inaugural Address. But it is by no means confined to the Right, as shown by Hillary Clinton’s attack on “the basket of deplorables” and the continuing media assaults on Donald Trump and his supporters.\n\nIndeed, despite Spadaro and Figueroa’s invocation of Pope Francis’s “ecumenism … of inclusion, peace, encounter and bridges,” they seem remarkably uninterested in building bridges to anyone on their right, or even of trying to understand them.\n\nIn contrast to the American evangelicals and Catholics who incur the scorn of the powers that be by refusing to accept gay marriage and abortion, this, then, is the vision presented by Spadaro and Figueroa: a Christianity where the highest expression of Christian values is for Christian nations to cease to be Christian, both in terms of the laws they enact and the composition of their populations, with endless dialogue and bridge building for those on the left and scorn and condemnation for those on the right.\n\nIn his great eulogy for the courageous Cardinal Meisner, Benedict XVI spoke of the need for pastors who resist the dictatorship of the Zeitgeist. The vision presented by Spadaro and Figueroa does not challenge the dictatorship of the Zeitgeist in any significant respect. Indeed, they seem all too willing to serve as chaplains to the spirit of the age.\n\nMatthew Schmitz, literary editor of FIRST THINGS, has written a few insightful pieces off the beaten track since his landmark article last year describing how and why he finally saw the light about Jorge Bergoglio. In this contribution toe the UK Catholic Herald's print edition of July 28, 2017, he takes on the Spadaro-Figueroa tract on Bergoglian geopolitics and whatnot...\n\nWhy the Vatican is doing battle\n\nwith American culture\n\nThe pope's advisers have taken aim at US Christianity.\n\nHere's why this matters...\n\nby Matthew Schmitz\n\nCATHOLIC HERALD\n\nposted Thursday, 27 Jul 2017\n\nIn 1866, when Pope Pius IX’s secretary of state learned that the Habsburgs had lost the Battle of Sadowa, he exclaimed “Casca il mondo!” – the world is collapsing. “Good God,” he cried out as he struck his face, “what is to become of us?”\n\nFor decades, the popes had positioned themselves as the spiritual support of European powers challenged by revolution. The defeat of the Habsburgs cast the Church’s very survival into doubt.\n\nToday, threats as varied as Corbyn, Putin, ISIS and Trump have left the leaders of the liberal order – based on open borders, free trade and secular pluralism – feeling embattled.\n\nOn the night of Donald Trump’s election, Gérard Araud, the French ambassador to the US, tweeted, “After Brexit and this election, everything is now possible. A world is collapsing before our eyes.” Florian Philippot, the impish adviser to Marine Le Pen, retorted: “Their world is collapsing. Ours is being built.”\n\n[But]Once again, the pontiff was put forward as the bulwark of teetering powers. Fr Antonio Spadaro, a close adviser to Pope Francis, tweeted, “Who’s the world’s moral leader in this moment? Who leads the way? A voice emerges and continues to emerge.”\n\nThe men surrounding Francis see him as an indispensable support of a uniquely just political system. In a series of speeches on Europe, Francis has embraced that role, arguing that with the formation of the European Union, Europe finally “found its true self”. Europe had always had “a dynamic and multicultural identity”, but only since World War II has that identity been embodied in societies “free of ideological conflicts, with equal room for the native and the immigrant, for believers and non-believers”.Francis stresses diversity over identity, dialogue over agreement. (“If there is one word that we should never tire of repeating, it is this: dialogue.”)\n\nFor all else the men share, this is a view opposed to that of Benedict XVI, who called on Europeans to “embrace our own heritage of the sacred” and warned that “multiculturalism, which is so passionately promoted, can sometimes amount to an abandonment and denial, a flight from one’s own things”.\n\nBenedict XVI saw the Church and the liberal order standing in a deeply ambivalent relationship. If Francis is more optimistic that they can partner, it is perhaps because he desires both a liberal Church and a liberal politics – each ratifying the other in a kind of inverted integralism.\n\nIntegralism was the system in which church and state collaborated to secure man’s peace on this world and salvation in the next. Joseph de Maistre defended it with a formula binding pope to king: “No public morals nor national character without religion, no European religion without Christianity, no true Christianity without Catholicism, no Catholicism without the Pope, no Pope without the supremacy that belongs to him.” Essential to this arrangement was the idea that the state must be subordinate to the Church.\n\nToday a new kind of integralism operates, in which the Church is subordinated to the state as the two conspire to uphold liberal values. If one were to update de Maistre’s syllogism, it would go something like: No cheap consumer goods or avoidance of genocide without liberalism, no liberalism without true Christianity, no true Christianity without an undogmatic Church, no undogmatic Church without a liberalising Pope, no liberalising Pope without accountability to the age and freedom from tradition.\n\nIt is in this context that one must understand the Vatican’s recent sally against America in the unofficial papal organ La Civiltà Cattolica. Written by Fr Spadaro and Marcelo Figueroa, another papal confidant, the article is not merely an expression of anti-American spite or an attack on ecclesial enemies. It is an attempt to defend the liberal order against what is perceived, rightly or wrongly, as an existential threat.\n\nSpadaro and Figueroa believe that American Catholics and Evangelicals resemble ISIS, in that they have formed a “cult of the apocalypse” in which the “community of believers (faith) becomes a community of combatants (fight)”. Underlying this cult of the apocalypse is a “political Manichaeism”, a desire to identify “what is good and what is bad”, which ultimately “divides reality between absolute Good and absolute Evil”. Spadaro and Figueroa single out for censure a fringe website called Church Militant – perhaps less for its influence (which is minor) than for its martial name.\n\nIf an indigenous tribesman interrupted in his affairs by a Columbus or Pizarro had read the accounts those explorers sent home, he would have marvelled as I did while reading this document. Error and exaggeration bloom, as the authors survey an unfamiliar landscape. American deserts and wastes were once expected to disclose glittering El Dorados; today, obscure websites and forgotten thinkers are accorded capital significance. A minor stream of thought is plumbed as though it were the Northwest Passage; the Mississippi is disregarded. A position is attacked that no man defends, and the resulting massacre is set down as a famous victory. The authors depict themselves as heralds of the Prince of Peace, and Americans as savages painted with blood.\n\nYet for all their inaccuracies, Spadaro Figueroa have hit on something real. Americans are indeed more indulgent of both public religion and public violence than are their European counterparts. From prayer on the 50-yard line to stand-your-ground laws, from the First Amendment to the Second, Americans never seem to walk far from heaven or hell.\n\nSpadaro probably learned this from the writer and Catholic apologist Flannery O’Connor, on whom he wrote his thesis, but the man who has thought most deeply about Europe’s and America’s differing approaches to religion and violence is the French political scientist Pierre Manent. “For Europeans the abolition of the death penalty constitutes the most eloquent expression, the one dearest to their hearts, of their identity and their distinctive values,” he writes. “Europeans find the American retention of capital punishment almost incomprehensible.”\n\nIt is no coincidence that America is more comfortable with both religion and violence – in some strange way, the two go hand in hand. Only if public moral judgments are potentially legitimate can public violence be justified, or dogmatic distinctions upheld. Traditionally, the state “could inflict the death of the body, as the church ruled over and for souls and therefore could inflict the death of the soul.”\n\nNow Europe’s leaders have come to doubt the legitimacy of such judgments, and so, Manent explains, along with the church, “the secular state is itself becoming secularised”. No authority has the right to say who is worthy of receiving communion and who is not, who may live and who must die.\n\nAmericans are less confident that they can dispense with such judgments. “Since the risk of violent death at the hands of others never completely disappears, the right to self-defence cannot completely disappear” – thus capital punishment and the Second Amendment. Spadaro and Figueroa decry this as a barbaric version of the old integralism. For Manent, it is an acknowledgment of inevitable fact.\n\nAmerica’s savagery is all the more baffling to Europeans because the US is richer and less haunted by the past than are the nations of Europe. At once more advanced and more primitive, America is an unsettling sign that no amount of progress will reverse the effects of the Fall. [Which is the hubristic goal (i.e., to reverse the effects of the Fall! as if it were in the power of man to do that) of all post-Lucifer creatures who think themselves somehow better than God and his teachings - vide the authors and advocates of Amoris laetitia, to cite the best current example - which they claim do not apply to a human society that is 'drastically different' from what it was in Biblical times to which all Revelation dates. But the nature of fallen man has not changed at all - it has simply become more indulged by the Zeitgeist, and therefore, more prone to evil.]\n\nSpadaro and Figueroa hope to overcome conflict and sorrow. They dream of “inclusion, peace, encounter and bridges”, of “working against ‘walls’ and any kind of ‘war of religion’”. They join Francis in refusing to say “who is right and who is wrong”, since “at the root of conflicts there is always a fight for power”.\n\nWhen such sweet hopes are held out in an essay full of vehement rhetoric and stark dualisms, the chance of their realisation seems dim indeed. Certainly there is much to criticise in America today. But are Americans aberrant for believing that violence and religion must touch on politics – or are Europeans so, for thinking they need not?\n\nPope Francis and his advisers believe the Church must defend the system of open borders and celebratory diversity exemplified by liberal Europe. There are many things in that settlement a Catholic should value, but when hatred of borders extends to a refusal to fence the altar, and dislike of division overwhelms dogmatic distinctions, the Church begins to seem as imperilled as the world to which it clings.\n\nNonetheless, fears that the Church will fall with a collapsing world are mistaken. One day, the order championed by Francis, like the one blessed by Pius, will give way. The body of Christ, however wracked by conflict, will remain. [May it be so!]\n\nTERESA BENEDETTA\n\n'The Drunkenness of Noah', Bellini, 1551. His sons cover up his nakedness to save him from embarrassment.\n\nI'm glad someone picked up on a story from L'Osservatore Romano a few days back which was headlined by one of the news aggregators to the effect that \"Vatican sees priests as main obstacle to pope's teaching\", which if accurate, would imply that the article does indeed acknowledge this pope's 'teaching' is not being picked up and disseminated as it should be within the Church herself by those who have the duty to do so. Meaning priests and bishops. It's worthy of a big AHA! moment, and one wonders what kind of evidence the writers had to make such an acknowledgment, even if it was simply anecdotal as it would have to be since no one has brought up any scientifically sampled surveys on the issue...\n\nBut it does puzzle me that Fr. Pilon's title for this essay is \"A New – and Encouraging – Form of Collegiality?\" when he is talking about what he seems to think is the 'silent majority' of the world's priests who do not agree with many things this pope teaches but who simply choose not to speak up. But it is not 'collegiality' when majority of priests and bishops independently decide not to speak up against the pope when they disagree with him - because the notion of 'collegiality' as defined by Vatican II and as evoked here by Fr. Pilon means 'an agreement or consensus among bishops and priests together with the pope\", not just among themselves.\n\nIn everyday terms, one might simply call such an agreement or consensus against the pope a 'silent mutiny'. Which does not mean anything, of course, unless the mutinous priests and bishops demonstrate their fidelity to the faith by continuing continue to preach and practice the deposit of faith as orthodox Catholics have recognized it to be until March 13, 2013 - and the depredations into that deposit by a man elected to lead the Church of Christ, but instead has been wreckovating it into the church of Bergoglio.\n\nIs there a new - and encouraging -\n\nconsensus among priests against\n\nthe dicta of this pope?\n\nby Fr. Mark A. Pilon\n\nTHE CATHOLIC THING\n\nTHURSDAY, JULY 27, 2017\n\nA recent article in L’Osservatore Romano by an Italian priest who teaches biblical theology is yet another example of the way the present papacy seems to look at priests and bishops who do not join in lockstep with the pope. I’ve never heard of this priest, Giulio Cirignano, but, evidently, he has some standing with the present regime.\n\nThe good father is clearly echoing an attitude that is prominent among the closest members of the papal entourage when he says: “The clergy is holding the people back, who instead should be accompanied in this extraordinary moment. . . .The main obstacle . . . is constituted . . . by the attitude of a good part of the clergy, at levels high and low . . . an attitude, at times, of closure if not hostility.”\n\nThis has become a frequent refrain in the pope’s own comments, i.e., that many clergy are rigid, closed, and hostile when it comes to his innovative teaching and practice. In my lifetime, I’ve never witnessed this kind of hostility coming from the papal office toward those who are meant to be co-workers in the vineyard of the Lord.\n\nI try to imagine how such badgering of the clergy would have been looked at if it were a so-called “conservative” pope doing this. Suppose Pope John Paul II had been using this kind of language toward priests who were resisting his teaching. That great pope was anything but naïve, and he understood well that many clergy, including some bishops and cardinals, were resistant to the constant teaching of the church on matters like contraception, women priests, and divorce and remarriage. Yet never – to my knowledge – did he demean clergy who disagreed with him.\n\nOr I try to imagine what would have been the response of the world’s press, secular and Catholic, if it had become known, say, that John Paul II had refused an audience to a group of cardinals who rejected his teaching on communion for the divorced and remarried in Familiaris Consortio. Imagine how outraged the secular and liberal Catholic world would have been had that pope treated his own privileged counselors in such a manner.\n\nAnd yet Pope Francis seems to be the “Teflon” pope. No matter what he says or does in relation to the clergy and cardinals of the world, it doesn’t seem to affect his image as the compassionate, merciful, open pope. [As John Allen would say, the image is the narrative, and the narrative is still of a pluperfect pope who could possibly do no wrong, in the eyes of secular and liberal anti-Catholics.]\n\nMaybe this is all we can expect in a world where truth matters little compared with images. But there is something interesting in this article that I haven’t seen commented on. This particular article confirmed for me, in a backhanded sort of way, some things about the reception of the more controversial aspects of Amoris Laetitia, and how it all relates to the notion of collegiality laid down in Vatican II.\n\nThis Italian priest and the editors of the pope’s own newspaper obviously felt it quite necessary, or at least opportune, to browbeat clergy and bishops once again for their failure to get in line with the pope. And why? Perhaps it seemed urgent because this resistance was in fact not minor, but it involved a “good part of the clergy, at levels high and low.”\n\nEvidently, the urgency had to do with the fact that this resistance was quite widespread, and someone, somewhere hoped that a clever analysis by a theologian might reverse that trend.\n\nThe fact that this resistance is the real story struck me some time ago. [Depends how real and widespread such 'resistance' is.] Sure, you can count on the usual suspects like the German hierarchy, or the bishops from the pope’s own country, or from a tiny island diocese.\n\nBut the fact remains that the vast, vast majority of local Church hierarchies around the world are remaining silent, and a good number of individual bishops are openly confirming their flock in the traditional practice of the Church regarding communion for the divorced and remarried. [I hope this is at least 50 percent right in reality. Isn't it rather rash of Fr. Pilon to state this as a fact absent any real worldwide survey???]\n\nThis silence is itself the big story. It bespeaks the urgency of the matter. The Pope Francis contingent in the Church universal expected that the national hierarchies would fall in line quite easily. Yet this expectation is itself somewhat surprising, given the open resistance at the two synods to any such innovative practices as Communion for the divorced and remarried who had not received annulments.\n\nOnly the manipulations of the Synod and its results made it possible for these innovations to make their way into the pope’s exhortation. But the manipulators obviously thought that blind obedience would follow once the pope had spoken.\n\nIt didn’t. And what this grand silence really bespeaks, therefore, is collegiality in the true sense of that term. It seems the bishops of the world have great respect for the papal office and are hesitant to make any public display of disagreement that might embarrass the pope and undermine his office. A friend told me it was sort of like the sons of Noah covering the nakedness of their drunken father so that he would not be embarrassed. [But that's not true collegiality - when they actually disagree but only choose not to say so publicly, even when it has to do with one of Christ's most explicit teachings (when he directly confronted the problems of marriage, divorce and adultery - which were no different in Palestinian society 2000 years ago than they are today in the permissive era of a presumptuous Christ-substituting pope!)][/DIM]\n\nNonetheless, it’s simply a fact that the vast majority of bishops have not signed on to the interpretation of the Germans, the Argentineans, or the Maltese bishops. Nor have they given a rousing support to the “official” interpretation of Vienna’s Cardinal Schönborn. [True, insofar as there has not been a universal rush by priests and bishops to proclaim to the world through the media exactly where they stand on AL! In which the 'saving Noah from embarrassment' hypothesis would appear to be determinative!]\n\nOne of the ecclesiological purposes for calling Vatican II was to establish a certain re-balancing of the teaching on papal primacy in Vatican I. This balancing was, in fact, the teaching on collegiality, the close official relationship of all the bishops of the world to the pope, and the importance of collegiality in the exercise of the papal prerogatives.\n\nThe way this collegiality is exercised is complex. For instance, synods are a certain exercise of collegiality, but they do not exhaust the ways in which collegiality can take place.\n\nWe’ve now learned that one exercise of collegiality, perhaps not anticipated at that Council, may well occur through silence in the face of a possible case of papal overreach. [OK, Fr. Mark, what we have then is 'a collegiality of silence to save this pope from embarrassment' but cui bono???]\n\nFr.

It turns out Jeff Mirus at Catholic Culture had an earlier reaction...\n\nL’Osservatore Romano’s latest gambit:\n\nPreferring culture to truth?\n\n[Is this not SOP for preogressivist 'Catholics'?]\n\nBy Jeff Mirus\n\ncatholic culture.org\n\nJuly 24, 2017\n\nTo avoid choking, one can only smile at the latest essay in L’Osservatore Romano which claims that Pope Francis’s plan for renewal is accepted by the “people” but resisted by “priests and bishops”.\n\nTypical of Vatican periodicals during this pontificate, the article is long on cultural rhetoric and short on moral and doctrinal distinctions. Once again we see the Holy Spirit portrayed as the spirit of renewal at the expense of ceasing to be the spirit of truth.\n\nThe reader can hardly be surprised that the most recent example, an article by the Florentine theologian Giulio Cirignano, fails to identify particular issues on which anyone has advanced either a right or a wrong position. Instead, his approach is all smoke and mirrors.\n\nEntitled “The Conversion Asked by Pope Francis: Habit is not Fidelity”, the article rests on two claims offered without the slightest evidence:\n\n“Most of the faithful have understood, despite everything, the favorable moment, the kairos, which the Lord is giving to his community. For the most part, they’re celebrating.”\n\n“The clergy is holding the people back, who instead should be accompanied in this extraordinary moment…. The main obstacle…is constituted…by the attitude of a good part of the clergy, at levels high and low…an attitude, at times, of closure if not hostility.”\n\nIn other words, Cirignano asserts that such pastors seek to hold the people back “behind an old horizon, the horizon of habitual practices, of language out of fashion, of repetitive thinking without vitality.”\n\nWhy smile, then? Only because such statements will be affirmed only by partisans; they can never pass for clarity of thought. The author says absolutely nothing substantive. He praises and denounces entirely without evidence. We have listened to such drivel for years, always coming from those who desire status in a culture that has first abandoned the faith and then driven it away. Their sycophantic mantra amounts to nothing more than this: “Get with it! The future is now! The answer is blowing in the wind! It’s 2017! Oh, and by the way, resistance is futile.”\n\n[Mirus makes me realize I am not skeptical enough! Far from setting forth claims of implied widespread hostility to the Bergoglian Novus Ordo or New Order (generic, not referring to the Montinian liturgy) that is seemingly in command today, the writer (and OR) are instead simply magnifying and multiplying the literal 'straw men' Bergoglio sets up in his daily homilettes and other pontifications and trying to knock them down - or even burn them up! These strawmen constitute the permanent enemy (or legion of devils) that every ideological front must have to justify itself. Except, of course, that strawmen are always obviously strawmen, as fundamentally fictitious, but tactically and strategically crucial to those who set them up because they are 'easy to knock down'. It's all a game to them!]\n\nWhenever people speak or write in this way it is because they wish to justify some position or course of action which is likely to meet greater resistance if it is clearly articulated.\n\nFor Catholics, it is always at least potentially dangerous to say flatly: “The Church is wrong in teaching that behavior X is always immoral or that doctrine Y is always true.” Instead, Catholics who sell their souls to the dominant culture undermine Catholic beliefs by accusing those who wish to clarify them of “repetitive thinking without vitality.”\n\nTheir rule is simple: Never directly contradict what the Church teaches. Instead, insist on openness while attacking the character of those who seek clarity.\n\nAs a prime example, consider the Cardinals who asked to speak with Pope Francis about several serious questions which seemed to be blurred in the text of Amoris Laetitia. The Pope refused even to grant them an audience.\n\nInstead, in various interviews he denounced persons who raise such issues as “rigid”, as incapable of understanding the good he is trying to do — as being so stupid, apparently, that they have missed the whole point.\n\nUnsurprisingly, those who seek preferment, including the most prominent contributors to Vatican publications today, take exactly the same line.\n\nNote that such material is always published not as a rigorous argument but as a kind of celebration of the new order — a recognition, perhaps, of “the favorable moment…the Lord is giving to his community.” ['Favorable moment' for them, not for the one true Church of Christ.]\n\nFor this reason, the point of contention is never clearly identified with Church teaching. Instead, it is identified with the cramped and backward mentalities of those who, by defending the Faith, somehow prove that they do not want it to flourish. What, after all, is the first reason given for the sad failure of so many priests and bishops to appreciate the vision of Pope Francis? They have attained, wrote Cirignano, only a “modest cultural level”.\n\nTruly, we should not be smiling after all. We should be laughing out loud.\n\nTERESA BENEDETTA\n\nJuly 28, 2017\n\nGoodnight and goodbye, sweet Charlie!\n\nThe angels have borne you off to heaven, from where, in the bosom of God,\n\nyou will watch over the parents you left behind.\n\nProbably the most poignant photograph I have seen in years!

The event was sponsored by a local branch of Caritas Italiana, the Church’s aid and humanitarian organization.\n\nBonino, who supports an open-door policy for migrants, used her talk to promote the overturning of 2002 legislation that tightened Italy’s immigration laws. More than 500,000 migrants have entered Italy in the past three years, putting strain on local services and leading to heated disputes about how many refugees the country should accept.\n\nAn Italian radical leftist and human rights activist, Bonino served as Italy’s Foreign Affairs minister from 2013 to 2014. She had an illegal abortion at the age of 27 and then worked with the Information Centre on Sterilization and Abortion which boasted of performing over 10,000 abortions carried out using a homemade device operated by a bicycle pump.\n\nAlong with the late Radical Party member Marco Pannella, Bonino has long campaigned for civil rights and individual liberty, and fought for the legalisation of abortion and drugs as well as sexual and religious freedoms.\n\nIn 2016, Pope Francis praised Bonino as one of Italy’s “forgotten greats” for her work in helping refugees in Africa, saying in an interview that he recognized she thinks differently from the Church. “[I say] patience. You have to look at people, what they do,” he said. [And performing 10,000 abortions is what she did! Is this something this pope can overlook just because the woman preaches the same irrational immigration policy that he does? In the annals of this papacy, his defense of Bonino stands as a far more serious outrage than his off-the-cuff 'Who am I to judge?' even when taken in the context he said it (i.e., in defense of his appointment of Mons. Ricca to be the 'spiritual director' of the IOR!]\n\nAt Wednesday’s meeting, Bonino, who has fought against conscientious objection rights, told the audience she had agreed to speak in the church “because I come from a practicing Catholic family, but one that taught me to respect the opinion of others.”\n\nShe then claimed the world is overpopulated because of “poverty in Africa, where they are having children because they are poor” while Italy is facing “demographic decline” (Bonino and others like her believe sterilizing women and providing contraception is the answer).\n\nHer comment prompted entrepreneur and pro-life activist Alberto Cerutti to interrupt her talk. “I merely said out loud that, with her abortion choices, she is among those responsible for the population decline,” he told Intelligonews, “at which point I was forcibly escorted out of the church.”\n\nCerutti said afterwards he was incensed that, despite the earlier protests, the meeting went ahead and was used to promote such “propaganda” from the Italian Radical party. He said what happened was “not a war between Catholics, but a clash between believers and secularists” which should “make us think.”\n\nTwo other Catholics, Leandro Aletti, a gynaecologist, and Giorgio Celsi of “Ora et labora,” a pro-life group, also spoke out during the event, but their protestations were drowned out by boos and whistles. Present in the audience were several other well known radicals such as Silvio Viale who led the legalization of the abortion pill RU486.\n\nPolice meanwhile questioned the group of protesters who had been praying the Rosary outside the church, and asked to see their identification and documents. Aletti said some of the police sided with the protestors.\n\nThe organizers reportedly kept the church doors tightly closed throughout the talk so that the sound of prayer would not enter the place of worship.\n\nAccording to the Italian newspaper La Nuova Bussola Quotidiana, Aletti told Bonino that it was “absurd” to hear her arguments on immigration “from someone who does not accept our children.”\n\nBonino replied that they were old arguments that didn’t “scare” her. “I remain convinced of individual freedom, no one can tell you what to do, everyone chooses for themselves,” she said.\n\nShe then went on to say “we have no choice” but to regularize illegal immigrants “unless we want to drown them all in the Mediterranean.” [She recoils at undocumented intending immigrants drowning in the Mediterranean - under the circumstances, unfortunately, they can easily drown because of unsafe, overcrowded boats, but no one drowned them - but not that she was responsible for more than 10,000 embryo/fetal murders???? If Italy's abortionists whom she has led for decades had not been killing all those Italian babies in the womb, perhaps Italy would not have the demographic deficit it has.]\n\nThe head of the local Caritas office, Father Giovanni Perini, spoke in support of Bonino at the meeting, saying “we have no right to make life difficult for others” and accused anyone concerned about immigration of fuelling human trafficking, crime and exploitation. [Hey! Who is responsible for human trafficking, crime and exploitation in all this? The average European who opposes indiscriminate immigration for all the practical reasons it ought not to be allowed - and which he probably feels directly in a lesser quality of life because his government must stretch its resources to take care of illegal aliens - has enough daily problems of his own to face without having to be accused by bleeding-heart nincompoops of 'fuelling' major crimes!] He made no mention of the six million Italian children killed since abortion was legalized in the country in 1978.\n\nFather Marchiori, meanwhile, has become well known for such controversy (he twice invited pro-euthanasia campaigner Beppino Englaro to speak), but his bishop, Mons. Gabriele Mana, remained silent about the event. Despite campaigners making their concerns known to him, and the disclosure that the bishop did not agree with his priest’s actions, he said he did not want to take sides. He also reportedly made no effort to try to dissuade Caritas from sponsoring the event. [Well, Marchiori and Mana and the lcoal Caritas are certainly all typical of the CINOs who, like their lord and master, are really now out-and-out Bergoglians!]\n\nThe Register contacted the bishops’ office for comment but no one was available to take our call.\n\nDespite the depth of the controversy, it attracted little attention in Italy. For Italian journalist and bioethics expert Benedetta Frigerio, this is because supposedly intellectual civil, political and Church leaders don’t understand the situation which is visible to “simple, Christian people.”\n\nThe Church’s hierarchy is “very confused,” she said; people follow such leaders and become “ideological and confused themselves.” Others, she said, “feel lost, they don’t have a leader, and so they don’t take action and don’t know how to act.” Those who do fight, she added, are a small group, spread all over the country and so have minimal effect.\n\nShe believes the faithful and Church leaders are particularly confused on the issue of immigration, also during the pontificate of Benedict XVI, in that they believe all migrants must be welcomed. [Benedict XVI certainly never said that! Besides, in his time, the problem had not ballooned to what it is today because of Bergoglio's Lampedusa stunt very early in his pontificate.]\n\nFrigerio, who writes for La Nuova Bussola Quotidiana, told the Register July 28 it was a scandal that those Catholics firmly opposed to Bonino are equated with Islamist terrorist groups and accused of threatening peaceful coexistence. For a Catholic to defend Bonino who is so opposed to the Church, she said, is “really a disgrace\". [Well, tell that to your pope who considers Bonino \"one of Italy's contemporary greats\" despite her record on abortion!]\n\nSuch actions, she added, go “against the faith, against Jesus Christ. We’re not able to fight for Him anymore. We’re not able to take on our shoulders the hatred of our enemies but told to prefer to be at ‘peace,’ to think we are good, that we are loved for our ego, but not able to suffer [for our faith] anymore.”\n\nAletti recalled the words of Bl. Paul VI who said in 1977 that such non-Catholic thought within the Church will “become the strongest [force]. But it will never represent the Church's thinking. A small flock must remain, no matter how small it is.”\n\nGiovanni Ceroni, president of Italy’s Movement for Life in Biella, told La Nuova Bussola Quotidiana that the ultimate weapon in these circumstances is “the prayer of reparation and adoration of God.”\n\n“In our prayers we remember Bonino and the many who were present, so blinded by ideology, but especially that priest [who] gives so much scandal to the faithful.”\n\n“It’s possible to convert to Jesus,” he said, “by following the one True, Holy Church.” [Which is definitely not the church of Bergoglio, not the church this pope is imposing willynilly on the world's 1.2 billion Catholics!]\n\nTERESA BENEDETTA\n\nWith all due respect to the RORATE CAELI blogsite, the above post simply does not make sense. A rumor is a rumor. Until it is confirmed or not, no one can say whether the content of the rumor is true or untrue. That the rumor has been going round about SP is true, as the Rorate post itself reports. Just as rumors had been going round about the pope having named a commission to study some possible Bergoglian action on Humanae Vitae (HV).\n\nThe existence of the commission was denied to high heavens by the pope's closest associates until a few days ago, when the person he named to head the commission (whose members had been named - correctly, it turns out - in earlier reports on the 'rumor' by persons as well-informed and well-connected as Prof. Roberto De Mattei) disclosed in an interview with Vatican Radio that his group had indeed been asked to study the Vatican Archives for everything that had to do with the genesis, writing and final content of the anti-artificial contraception encyclical by Paul VI.\n\nOf course, that is not the same as studying possible changes to the encyclical that could be 'legislated' by one of his successors (I have yet to check out whether a papal encyclical can be changed or abrogated by another pope - it seems to me that 'unwanted' encyclicals are simply ignored, as Bergoglio has ignored Veritatis splendor altogether, or DOMINUS IESUS, which although not an encyclical was a document issued with the full approval of John Paul II specifically for the Jubilee Year that marked 2,000 years of Christianity.)\n\nBut why would the current research on HV be undertaken other, than to find out any possible chinks that could be unearthed to show that somehow, its promulgation was defective, and that therefore, it behooves this pope to make the necessary correcti0n(s)? Charitably, of course, one could suppose Bergoglio's intention is so that he can then issue a papal proclamation that \"HV remains the Church's final word on artificial contraception, so please, Catholics of the world - including those closest and dearest to me - stop impugning a pope I recently beatified!\"\n\nStete Skojec at 1Peter5 also immediately rebutted John-Henry Westen's article for LIFESITE NEWS about the supposed rumors on SP. Not to say outright as RC would later that 'These rumors are not true', only to try to prove how Westen's report could not possibly be true. None of which matters, because in this pontificate, what matters in practice is only what Bergoglio wants, says and does.\n\nAll I know is that with this pope, one can never be certain what he won't do or will do, so the prudent thing is to wait and see. I say this, even knowing that he has never yet failed to live up to what I would call a default assumption by those like me who continue to be appalled by his hubristic derring-do - namely, you can always count on him to do the anti-Catholic thing. (In fact, a good label for the Bergoglio papacy would be 'The anti-Catholic thing', a take-off on the name of the excellent blogsite by Robert Royal and company.)\n\nRealistically, what can he do about Summorum Pontificum? At the very least, he could go back to the status ante SP, before Sept 14, 2007, when SP went into effect – namely,that priests and groups wishing to use the traditional Mass have to get their local bishop's approval to do so.\n\n- Does that mean that those priests and groups now using the EF must start from scratch and get their bishop's approval before they can continue to pray the Mass form they prefer as they are now entitled to do? – And what about the other traditional groups like the FSSP (Fraternal Society of St Peter) besides the better known FSSPX (named after St Pius X), that had always been allowed, pre-SP, to continue using the traditional Mass under the tutelage of the Ecclesia Dei Commission? According to the rumor, Bergoglio would limit the use of the traditional Mass only to the FSSPX.\n\nCommon sense would imply that Bergoglio gets nothing but selfish satisfaction – and of course, the undying gratitude of all his fellow progressivists committed to the complete extirpation of the traditional Mass from the practice of the faith - by going to all the trouble of rescinding SP out of sheer spite, it would seem.\n\nBecause it does not have to be pointed out that SP does not impose the traditional Mass on anyone who does not want to have anything to do with it, and that the latter can go on 'blissfully' to their graves without ever having to think at all about the Extraordinary Form – so what rational reason is there that they have made their absolute opposition to the Mass of the Ages a 'point of honor' they would fall on their sword to defend?\n\nEarlier this week, however, Rorate caeli did provide us with a significant historical nugget in this translation of an article written as early as 1955 by one of the great writers of the 20th century, Paul Claudel. Published by the most important French daily, Claudel wrote against the idea of a Mass celebrated ad populum (facing the people) as early as 1955, a practice that almost immediately became de facto de rigueur with the imposition of the Novus Ordo a decade and a half later, even if nowhere in Vatican II's Constitution on the Liturgy (Sacrosanctum Concilium) is this ever legislated.\n\nMass facing the people means\n\nthere's no longer an altar\n\nby Paul Claudel\n\nLE FIGARO\n\nJanuary 23, 1955\n\nCourtesy of\n\nI wish to protest with all my strength against the growing practiCe in France of saying Mass facing the people.\n\nThe most basic principle of religion is that God holds first place and that the good of man is merely a consequence of the recognition and the practical application of this essential dogma.\n\nThe Mass is the homage par excellence which we render to God by the Sacrifice which the priest offers to Him in our name on the altar of His Son.\n\n- It is us led by the priest and as one with him, going to God to offer Him hostias et preces (Victims and prayers).\n\n- It is not God presenting Himself to us for our convenience to make us indifferent witnesses of the mystery about to be accomplished.\n\nThe novel liturgy deprives the Christian people of their dignity and their rights. It is no longer they who say the Mass with the priest, by “following” it, as the saying very rightly goes, and to whom the priest turns from time to time to assure them of his presence, participation and cooperation, in the work which he undertakes in their name. All that remains is a curious audience watching him do his job. Small wonder that the impious compare him to a magician performing his act before a politely admiring crowd.\n\nIt is true that in the traditional liturgy the most touching, the most moving part of the Holy Sacrifice is hidden from the view of the faithful. But it is not hidden from their hearts and their faith. To demonstrate this, during Solemn High Masses the sub-deacon stays at the foot of the altar during the Offertory, hiding his face with his left hand. We too are invited to pray, to withdraw into ourselves, not in a spirit of curiosity but of recollection.\n\nIn all of the Eastern rites the miracle of transubstantiation takes place unseen by the faithful, behind the iconostasis. It is only afterwards that the celebrant appears on the threshold of the sacred door, the Body and Blood of Christ in his hands.\n\nA vestige of this idea lingered for many years in France, where the old missals did not translate the prayers of the canon. Dom Guéranger protested energetically against those who had the audacity to do away with this custom.\n\nToday’s deplorable practice has turned the ancient ceremony upside down, to the great consternation of the faithful. There is no longer an altar. Where is it, this consecrated stone which the Apocalypse compares to the Body of Christ Itself? There is nothing but a bare trestle covered with a tablecloth, reminding us depressingly of a Calvinist workbench.\n\nNaturally, as the convenience of the faithful was held up as the guiding principle, it was necessary to rid the aforementioned table of the “accessories” cluttering it up: not only the candlesticks and the vases of flowers, but the tabernacle! The very crucifix! The priest says his Mass in a vacuum! When he invites the people to lift up their hearts and their eyes…to what? There is no nothing left in front of us to focus our minds on the Divine.\n\nIf the candlesticks and crucifix were kept, the people would be even more excluded than in the old liturgy, because then not only the ceremony but the priest himself would be completely hidden from view.*\n\nI would resign myself to this situation with the greatest grief, as henceforth, it would appear that not the slightest spiritual effort will be required of the common people. It seems necessary to stick the most sublime of mysteries in their faces, to reduce the Mass to the primitive form of the Last Supper and in doing so, change the entire ritual.\n\nWhat would be the meaning of 'Dominus vobiscum' and 'Orate frates' spoken by a priest separated from his people and requiring nothing of them? What then is the significance of the sumptuous vestments worn by those we have delegated as ambassadors to the Divinity?\n\nAnd our churches, would there be any reason then to leave them as they are?\n\n*My footnote:\n\nActually, the Benedettian 'six candles and a crucifix' minimum required for a Novus Ordo Mass table (how can it even properly be called an altar when it does not contain the requisite relic that every church ought to have in its altar?) does not obscure the celebrant at all.\n\nIn fact the Bergoglian stepdown of the Benedettian minimum ensures you can't possibly miss the celebrant's presence at all - two candles off to one side, a low flower arrangement on the other side, the missal rests on a pillow instead of a stand, and the Crucifix is dwarfed even by the chalices he uses! (In fairness, behind the priest on the rear wall of the chapel in Casa Santa Marta is a huge Crucifix, so maybe the pope's liturgists think having an itsy-bitsy crucifix on the altar is just fine.\n\nBTW, unless the crucifix on the mass table in the photo is double-faced, it seems it has its back to the Mass celebrant.\n\nTERESA BENEDETTA\n\nOf course, all that follows in this post becomes irrelevant if and when this pope does abrogate or substantially amend Summmorum Pontificum\n\nin any way. But there have been quite a few commentaries from 'traditional' bloggers on the most recent suggestions put forward by Cardinal Sarah\n\nto improve and possibly standardize celebration of the Mass in both forms of the Roman rite. One or two have not met with the universal welcome\n\n[by traditionalists] to his 'ad orientem' recommendation last year. While I have not posted anything of this current polemic, I shall start off\n\nwith this post by Fr Hunwicke who deals with the relatively non-controversial ones of Cardinal Sarah's recent liturgical suggestions. Fr H comments\n\nas a priest and liturgist of the first Anglican Ordinariate, whose historically-based, Benedict-approved liturgy has remained stable and uncontroversial\n\nin the first eight years of the experience so far.\n\nCardinal Sarah and the Ordinariate rite\n\nJuly 27, 2017\n\nIn his latest lecture, the very admirable and very courageous Cardinal Prefect of the Sacred Congregation of Rites (Oops ... have I perpetrated an anachronism?) adds, to the suggestions he had made earlier, at least two new points for the improvement of the Ordinary Form:\n\n(1) The priest should genuflect immediately after the Consecration of the Host and of the Chalice.\n\nIt is, surely, unnecessary to explain why this is so desirable. I point out that it already happens in the Ordinariate Rite. (You will remember that, upon seeing a copy of our Ordinariate Missal, His Eminence wistfully commented \"Why can't we have something like this?\")\n\n(2) The holding of thumb and index finger conjoined after they have touched the Consecrated Host.\n\nAfter the regime of Edward Tudor had imposed the First Prayer Book upon the suffering clergy and people of England, the tyrants discovered that the clergy were assimilating the service as closely as possible to the Sarum Mass. So draft Articles of Visitation ordered \"For a uniformity, that no minister do counterfeit the popish mass, as to kiss the Lord's table; washing his fingers at every time in the communion; blessing his eyes with the paten, or sudary; or crossing his head with the paten; shifting of the book from one place to another; laying down and licking the chalice of the communion; holding up his fingers, hands, or thumbs, joined towards his temples; breathing upon the the bread or chalice; showing the sacrament openly before the distribution of the communion; ringing of sacrying bells; or setting any light upon the Lord's board ...\"\n\nI suspect that the section I have boldened refers to the conjoining of thumb and index finger ... what, in the 1960s, trendy vandals used to call \"finger pinching\".\n\nWe of the Anglican Patrimony have a long experience ... centuries ... of catholicising defective liturgies imposed by soi-disant authorities. Perhaps we should set up a lucrative Consultancy to show those who want to catholicise their bog-standard Novus Ordo how it's done? No need ... if they attend a Latin Mass Society training week on the Extraordinary Form, they'll find it fairly obvious how to transfer the skills from EF to OF.\n\nBut it is Father Z who has done his best to keep track of the polemics regarding the more controversial suggestions from Cardinal Sarah, especially concerning the Lectionary – the prescribed Scriptural readings for the daily Masses and feasts of the Church. His posts on the topic are very useful because he cites the major arguments put forward by a few of the major commentators on the Sarah proposals, so I do not need to post his references in toto, though I have provided the links to the full articles…\n\nCardinal Sarah’s proposals for 'mutual enrichment'\n\nJuly 21, 2017\n\nThere are strong debates going on over many important issues right now. One of those which most interests me has been stoked by the 10th anniversary of Benedict XVI’s monumentally important Summorum Pontificum. I called it the “Emancipation Proclamation”, and have dubbed it a foundation block of his “Marshall Plan” for the revitalization of our Catholic identity and a bulwark against the dictatorship of relativism.\n\nFor the 10th anniversary, the great Robert Card. Sarah, Prefect of the Congregation for Divine Worship, wrote an article for the French magazine La Nef. The text was hard to find (I have it now). I was also sent a good English translation which I read as a PODCAzT. I didn’t agree with everything the Cardinal suggested about the future path of Benedict’s desired “mutual enrichment” of the two “forms” of the Roman Rite. However, I have prayerfully engaged them.\n\nFr. Raymond de Souza (he’s been busy lately), not an enemy of traditional expressions of worship but not a strong supporter, wrote an endorsement of Card. Sarah’s suggestions at the UK’s best Catholic weekly (for which I also write) The Catholic Herald: “Cardinal Sarah’s challenge to traditionalists\". [Fr Z proceeds to quote excerpts, adding his comments in red.]\n\nSarah proposes that efforts be made to have a shared calendar and a shared lectionary, so that both the EF and OF would celebrate more feasts together and have the same Scripture readings at Mass. [Additions of saints to the traditional calendar is not terribly problematic. The addition of a new lectionary would introduce the serious problems of coherence that the Novus Ordo experiences, at least on Sundays. Also, I am not entirely sure that everyone would agree that the new Lectionary has been 100% successful. That said, yes, it would be easier for priests to have the same readings in both forms, especially when they – as I frequently do – say both forms on a Sunday. But easy isn’t a good objective in worship.]\n\nThat poses a twofold challenge. First, it requires the EF community to acknowledge that some aspects of the OF, particularly its reformed calendar and its lectionary – which includes far more Scripture than the EF one – are actual improvements and possible enrichments for the EF. [That isn’t apparent.]\n\nThere are certainly some in the EF community who are happy to acknowledge this and would be pleased to see a shared calendar and lectionary. [Again, these are two different issues.] But others, not an insignificant part, consider the entire OF to be an impoverishment with little, if anything, enriching to offer. [It would be good to put together the bullet points of what riches the OF would bring to the EF. That could be a helpful starting point for discussion.]In the background, of course, is the Society of St Pius X, which would be deeply suspicious of any talk of changing the EF Roman Missal, 1962 edition…\n\nMoving towards Cardinal Sarah’s vision begins, though, not with practicalities but with a change of heart. That is likely why he chose the term “reconciliation”. Reconciliation requires a change of heart, a willingness to see the good in the other, and an openness to make things different in order to accommodate that good…\n\nI think we all can agree that at the heart of most instances of reconciliation, especially in the life of the Church, all parties need a “change of heart”.\n\nHowever, I must of observe that, for decades, many of the traditional-leaning have experienced their hearts being torn from their breasts and stomped on by the other side, as it were. Their hearts have again and again been bruised and riven. If a change of heart is at the heart of reconciliation, then so are apologies. So is a time for healing.Talking about a change of heart is easy.\n\nThat brings me to another reaction to Card. Sarah’s 10th anniversary article, in dialogue with Fr. de Souza, by Prof. Joseph Shaw of Oxford and of the Latin Mass Society, who wrote a piece called “Why Cardinal Sarah’s liturgical ‘reconciliation’ plan won’t work“.\n\nhttp://www.catholicherald.co.uk/commentandblogs/2017/07/21/why-cardinal-sarahs-liturgical-reconciliation-plan-wont-work/\n\nFirstly, Shaw recaps what Card. Sarah suggested for the mutual enrichment of the two forms. For example, Sarah proposes introduction – no – re-introduction into the OF of the ff: reception of Communion on the tongue while kneeling (which should be the norm anyway); the Prayers at the Foot of the Altar; options for using the old Offertory prayers; quiet canon; and the so-called ‘canonical digits’ (the priest's fingers). [But Shaw questions] adoption of the Novus Ordo Lectionary (as Fr. de Souza praised) and what I consider a less problematic closer alignment of the calendars, so long as this is restricted to the addition of modern saints, etc. Shaw then tackles the issue of the Lectionary:\n\nThe new lectionary is sometimes held up as obviously superior to the old, but not everyone committed to the reformed Mass agrees. The Toronto Oratorian Fr Jonathan Robinson wrote in (The Mass and Modernity, 2005, p332): \"I think the diversity, rather than enriching people, tends to confuse them… This may be because the selections, as has been noted by others, were drawn up more to satisfy the sensibilities of liturgical scholars than on traditional liturgical principles.\" [My old boss at “Ecclesia Dei” remarked that the addition of a third reading on Sundays lent an undesirable element of “didacticism” to Mass. And if there is greater variety of Scripture readings in the Novus Ordo, the yearly repetition of the same readings on Sunday and Feasts in the trditional Mass ensured that the faithful came to know them well. Today, ask people what the readings were as they walk out of Mass.]\n\nHowever, another question is raised by Cardinal Sarah’s proposal: Can the lectionaries of the two Forms simply by swapped over? The short answer is ‘no’.\n\nTo take the most obvious problem, the 1969 Lectionary has no readings for the season of Septuagesima, because that season does not exist in the 1969 calendar. Were the ‘Ordinary Time’ cycle simply extended to this period of three Sundays before Lent, its penitential orations would conflict with readings which can be used after Pentecost as well as before Lent. [How about the reintroduction of the pre-Lent readings to the Ordinaey Form? How’s that as the step to mutual enrichment?]\n\nVariations on this problem arise throughout the Church’s year. Many of the EF’s proper texts of feast days, and a good many Sundays, refer to the readings. The choice of readings in the Ordinary Form is so different from those in the Extraordinary Form that the discordance would be particularly jarring. [Moreover, there is often a strong resonance between the readings and the antiphons in Mass formularies that would be disrupted, as it has been in the Novus Ordo with it’s three year Sunday cycle.]\n\nShaw has more on the issue of the Lectionary. Then, however, Shaw make a strong argument, which I endorse.\n\nAbove all I would like to suggest that the Church has nothing to fear from a varied liturgical landscape: a landscape becoming more varied as Eastern Rite Catholics flee to the West. Vatican II reassured us on this point (Unitatis redintegratio 17): \"…from time to time one tradition has come nearer to a full appreciation of some aspects of a mystery of revelation than the other, or has expressed it to better advantage. In such cases, these various theological expressions are to be considered often as mutually complementary rather than conflicting.\" This, surely, is the direction from which ‘liturgical reconciliation’ should come.\n\nYES! The Church even in the West has had a varied and rich liturgical tradition of Rites. Pius V acknowledged and supported this by “grandfathering” in regional Rites to exist along side the Roman Rite which became the universal Rite for the Latin Church. Over time, the Roman Rite became stronger even in those places which had its own Rite… over time. With the sudden and brutal imposition of an artifically crafted Novus Ordo Missae in 1969, came the heart-breaking suppression of what was “sacred and great”.\n\nI have argued for decades, ever since an article in Catholic World Report in 1992 (I think), that we have nothing to fear from side by side celebrations of Holy Mass in the traditional form and in the Novus Ordo. Card. Ratzinger wanted that contact, to help jump start the organic development of liturgy which, as the freezing of mustum halts its fermentation into wine, interrupted the centuries-long evolution of our liturgical prayer.\n\nSound liturgical changes take time… a lot of time. Impatience and imprudent imposition broke hearts and ruptured our Catholic identity, so enervating the Church that we are now experiencing crises in virtually every sphere of her global mission.\n\nBack in the early 90s I was already arguing that we shouldn’t be afraid of side by side Missals. Over time, we would see the results. Eventually, however, there would emerge a tertium quid – as I was used to call it then – from the dialogue between the rites. This I got straight from Card. Ratzinger in chats and from reading his work.\n\nOne thing that the Extraordinary Form has already benefited from comes mainly from the ars celebrandi of priests who have had an experience of the Novus Ordo: there is a greater awareness of the presence of and role of the congregation now than ever before. I think that factor alone, if nothing else, has already produced great benefits for the EF. That’s not a change to the Rite itself. That’s a change within the mind and the heart of the priest celebrant.\n\nBenedict XVI spoke eloquently of a priest’s ars celebrandi in his Sacramentum caritatis 38 ff., as the best way to foster the (properly understood) “active participation” of the congregation in the way that the Council Fathers hoped for in Sacrosanctum Concilium.\n\nWho says that we can’t have unity in diversity?
