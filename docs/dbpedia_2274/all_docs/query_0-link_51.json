Upon my return to Munich I expect the elections will be completed. May God grant that these bring back to Germany, and especially Bavaria, order and tranquility.\n\nOriginal Italian: Caro Signor Barone,\n\n... Per il mio ritorno a Monaco attendo che siano compiute le elezioni. Dio faccia che esse riconducano in Germania, e specialmente in Baviera, l’ordine e la tranquillita.\n\nSource: Bavarian Main State Archives, Nachlass Ritter [Ritter Papers], folder no. 63.\n\nJan. 25, 1919 Communiqué from Cardinal Bourne to Prime Minister David Lloyd George and Foreign Minister Arthur Balfour:\n\n... The Zionists here claim that the Jews are to have the domination of the Holy Land under a British protectorate; in other words, they are going to force their rule on an unwilling people of whom they form only 10%. They are already asserting themselves in every way, claiming official posts for their nominees, and generally interfering. This has resulted already in a great lessening of the welcome, which, at the outset, was given wholeheartedly to the British... The Zionists too claimed that they had obtained the approval of the Holy City ... There is no foundation for this claim. The whole movement appears to be quite contrary to Christian sentiment and tradition. Let Jews live here by all means, if they like, and enjoy the same liberties as other people; but that they should ever again dominate and rule the country would be an outrage to Christianity and its Divine founder...\n\nSource: Br. F.O. 371/4179, quoted in Sergio Minerbi, The Vatican and Zionism (1990), p.123.\n\nJan. 26, 1919 Schioppa to Gasparri:\n\n... These fears of the “Frankfurter Zeitung” are not, in truth, unfounded. The “Peter-Pages” of Trier – well-known organ of the integralists – in its latest issue (no. 14 of 1918/1919) publishes an article entitled “Ein Wort über die Bayerische Volkspartei”: [A word about the Bavarian People’s Party], in which it attacks this party for not being bound, according to the article writer, to full loyalty to the Government by the grace of God, instead supporting popular sovereignty; and for having called non-Catholics and Hebrews to collaborate within its ranks. A similar attack is made also against the Bavarian Catholic press, which, says the writer – is no more Catholic, but Christian, bourgeois and Bavarian. Finally the Catholic Associations are also not spared, which – in what the article states – have been transformed into political associations...\n\nSource: www.Pacelli-Edition.de, Document No. 1024.\n\nFeb. 8, 1919 Pacelli to Gasparri:\n\nMost Reverend Eminence,\n\nThe Bishop of Fulda charges me to transmit to the Holy See the here-enclosed Memorial sent to him by various Jewish persons and Societies of Frankfurt on Main, for the purpose of obtaining the good offices of the Holy Father, to bring an end to the cruelties that are said to have been committed up to now against the Hebrews in Poland and Galicia.\n\nIn fulfilling this desire of the aforesaid Bishop, I have the honor to bow humbly to kiss the Sacred Purple ...\n\nSource: www.Pacelli-Edition.de, Document No. 2120.\n\nFeb. 15, 1919 La Documentation Catholique, page 20:\n\n“The Israelites Claim: 1st The ‘Restitution’ of Palestine, 2nd ‘Their Own National Existence’ Among All the Other Peoples”\n\nFrom the Peuple Juif [Jewish People], a “review edited by the Zionist Federation of France,” (Jan. 24, 1919):\n\n... France is the classic country of Jewish emancipation. It was there that civil equality of Jews was proclaimed for the first time, and the honor has fallen to France of being the country where the work of our liberation, which she commenced, will be fully achieved...\n\nThe Jewish people now expect from the Paris Peace Conference not only the rights that will be useful for this or that individual Jew, but also the rights that will be useful for the nation and will strengthen it. Each Jew, as a Jew, will only be entirely free when free as a people.\n\nThe freedom of the Jewish people can only be obtained if one recognizes: that our nation is a nation with the same entitlement as other nations: that it has a right to a national home like all other peoples; that this home, this country, is Palestine, to which Jewish history, traditions and ideas are indissolubly bound.\n\nWhatever rights may be accorded Jews in different countries, if we are not given at the same time our own country, we will lack a solid base to continue our development, a base where we will be able to weave the golden threads of our culture, which has already given so much and can give yet so much more to the world...\n\nThe United States of America will surely be on the side of England in these questions. We hope that France, this France that gave the first great example of this Jewish emancipation, far from opposing, will on the contrary help the other liberal and democratic powers to realize this act of justice toward an eternally martyred people. Any other supposition is inadmissible and would be too sad...\n\nWe expect the Jews of Paris and of all France to rise up to the level of the Jewish masses of all the other countries; to demonstrate their will, like the others, to see Palestine given to the Jews, to put all their influence to work for that.\n\nI can assure that the great, overwhelming majority of the Jewish people are really nationalist and profoundly Zionist. May the French Jews fraternize in this regard with their brethren! We hope for this. It should be. Because their influence is so great, they are placed so close to the source of all our hopes – the Paris Peace Conference!\n\nLet us all unite, placing all our energies at the service of the great cause – the realization of a Jewish home in Palestine – in order to be able to carry out our own part in the common and ever-complex work of civilization. From now own may that part be no longer dispersed, anonymous, aprocryphal and unvalued, but Jewish, original, strong, appreciable.\n\nThe time is serious. Our ideal has risen up, our hopes are great. May each of us do his duty.\n\nMorris Myer, Director of the London daily “The Jewish Times”\n\nThe same issue of the Peuple Juif details its thought by this suggestive reflection:\n\nA good example. It may possibly be to the new State of Czecho-Slovakia that the honor will fall for being the first to recognize for the Jews of its country the right to constitute a national minority and to enjoy national autonomy as a result. At least, President Masaryk made this promise to the Jewish delegation of Prague, who had come to submit their claims.\n\nI do not propose to say here what exact form this autonomy might take. It will suffice for me to make the observation that this problem has been dealt with by our friends with all the attention it deserves, in Russia as well as in Poland and Galicia, and that the program as outlined can be immediately put into operation, leaving to the future the necessary revisions.\n\nIndependent Lithuania, we hear from the mouth of its Undersecretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Mr. Rosenbaum, has recognized for the Jews of that country the right to their own national existence among the three other nationalities that live there, the Latvians, White Russians and Poles.\n\nIn Ukraine, despite innumerable difficulties resulting from the troubled political condition in which the country finds itself, the Jews have been constituted an autonomous nationality, having their Council and their national representation.\n\nWhat better solution, just and rational at the same time, will the 800,000 Jews of Galicia find, shunted between the Ruthenians and the Poles, than to be constituted, themselves as well, as a Jewish national minority?\n\nWhat to say of the millions of our brothers who live in Poland? They must have guarantees against the recurrence of chauvinistic excesses by an excited population. Organized around their representatives and their institutions, they will be able to put their collective energy to the service of their national interests as well as the service of the new Polish State.\n\nAnd the 300,000 Jews of Bessarabia and Bukovina? And the 80,000 Jews of Salonika?\n\nThe example will be followed and should be.\n\nThat will resolve a great part of our problem.\n\nComment by Documentation Catholique: Concerning the role of the Israelites in these recent events, and most especially of Bolshevism and of its collusions with Germany, the Univers (Feb. 2, 1919) recounts these lines by Edward Meyer, professor at the University of Berlin:\n\n“We must let the idea sink in that the current war will be followed by another series of wars, until the supreme decision: one must envision the situation that is imposed on us, without recoiling before the consequences it brings.”\n\nFrench original, page 20 and page 21\n\nFeb. 23, 1919 Pacelli’s report to Gasparri about a failed counter-revolution attempt on Feb. 19, the assassination of Kurt Eisner on Feb. 21, and the ensuing political situation in Bavaria:\n\nMost Reverend Eminence,\n\nFollowing up my respectful enciphered report no. 301 of yesterday, I have the honor to report to Your Most Reverend Eminence concerning the recent tragic events in Munich, to the extent it is possible for me in the current difficult circumstances to verify the innumerable reports that are flowing about and which, after all, I have no way to obtain from direct sources.\n\nJust last Wednesday, the 19th, there was an attempt at a second revolution, about which I have not yet been able to learn with exactitude, nor the precise purpose of it, nor who was really directly involved. Toward evening that day, several hundred armed sailors occupied the Central Train Station, the Post, the Telegraph and Telephone, and seized also the Landtag building, declaring that they were obliged to guarantee the security of parliamentary activities, which were supposed to begin on Friday. Later they went as far as to imprison the President of Police. But when they attempted to occupy the barracks of the General Command as well as that of the Pioneers, then they were prevented by soldiers who, with machineguns and rifles, re-occupied all the rooms that had fallen into the hands of the sailors and liberated the President of Police. In this way it was possible to organize a service of public security, while the leader of the aforementioned sailors was arrested. The Government published a proclamation stigmatizing what had happened and promising the fullest freedom and security for the activities of the upcoming Landtag. This attempt at revolution was said to be a maneuver by monarchists and Prince Joachim, son of the ex-German Kaiser, who was in Munich incognito, was searched and accompanied militarily to the frontier, although on the other hand no proof could be found of his complicity in the deplorable event.\n\nRelative calm returned, even though not everyone was tranquil about the possibility that the Landtag could conduct its proper activities without incident.\n\nOn the 21st, the day the Parliament was to begin, the streets leading to it were militarily occupied from the earliest hours of the morning. It appeared that all possible measures would be taken to assure the most absolute protection to the Landtag. The Deputies and those invited to the galleries were put through rigorous security. Especially crowded was the gallery for the journalists, among whom were many correspondents for foreign newspapers. The Ministers and Deputies took their positions. The only one missing was Minister President Kurt Eisner. Then there appeared in the hall, white as a cadaver, Mr. Feschenbach, the young secretary of Kurt Eisner, and announced in an emotional voice that the Minister President had been assassinated. An unheard-of clamor then took over the Hall. Cries of terror were heard everywhere, and only with great effort could the President of the Assembly succeed in quelling the tumult somewhat. A Deputy, Dr. Sussheim, proposed that the session be adjourned, and all the party leaders agreed with him. In the adjacent rooms and corridors cries of indignation over the attack went back and forth, and there were remonstrances against Interior Minister Auer, the well-known political adversary of Eisner. The exits of the Parliament were hermetically sealed and militarily occupied, and a rigorous search was begun on everyone, to ascertain if there were any weapons.\n\nAfter about one hour the session was reopened. Auer immediately took the floor, deploring with emotion and strong expressions the assassination of the Minister President, all the more since Eisner had already decided to submit the resignation of his entire Cabinet to the hands of the Landtag. Minister Auer’s speech was generally approved and interrupted by gestures of satisfaction. But while Deputy Süssheim was presenting the motion for adjournment of the Landtag sine die, an individual dressed like a soldier but with a civilian hat rushed into the hall, leaped at Minister Auer, and emptied three revolver shots right into his chest. The Minister was seen to place his hands on his heart and topple onto a chair. Then shots were heard throughout the hall and a frightful confusion took over the crowd. A Center Party Deputy, Osel, one of the more respected members of the party, fell, shot by a bullet; other deputies and spectators were wounded. Someone approached Auer to see if he was still alive, and since he was still breathing, he was transported to the Clinic, where he is lying even now between life and death.\n\nAs has been generally reported, this is how the assassination of Kurt Eisner occurred. He went alone on foot from the Foreign Ministry to the Landtag, which is nearby, when a young man who looked like a student emptied three revolver shots into his neck; Eisner raised his arms, staggered, fell backwards to the ground, and died immediately.\n\nThe killer was a Count Arco-Valley, who was immediately attacked by a soldier and mortally wounded, though there is hope now of saving his life. Since he is a noble, an officer in the army, and a Catholic, the Socialists have found nothing better for exciting the people against the nobility, the officials, and the clergy. The agitation in the city is extraordinary. All offices and public buildings are closed. The Tramways are not running. Automobiles with soldiers and armed civilians are speeding down the streets. Ringing of church bells was compelled, to convoke the people for a rally held on the Theresienwiese [the Oktoberfest field]; large numbers of airplanes flew noisily over the city at low altitude, dropping from on high thousands of revolutionary manifestos. Red flags, already fluttering everywhere, are now seen at half mast. All the city newspaper offices have been occupied, and just yesterday a newspaper entitled Newspaper of the Central Council came out, which is replacing the other papers that are compelled by force of arms to cease their work. The Munich Council of soldiers, workers and farmers met immediately. A Central Council of the Bavarian Republic has been created, establishing a Committee of public safety and formed from elements that are most passionately for the revolution. Levin, the Leader of the Spartacists who takes part in the Central Council, is strongly advocating a Ministry Council patterned on Russia. None of the Ministers are present there, except for the Communication Minister and the Social Affairs Minister. The Minister for Military Affairs has been arrested. Timm, the Justice Minister, and Hoffmann, the Education Minister, are missing. As of now the new Government has not been formed, and the Province is under the command of the Central Council of soldiers. The Council has proclaimed a three-day general strike and has ordered that all the proletariat be armed. In fact work has been suspended everywhere for the past two days, and today manifestos are being posted with the rules, indicating that the workers can have weapons. Various hotels and private houses have been searched and are being guarded by armed military personnel. At night machinegun and rifle fire is heard all around, and armed soldiers make rounds of the city. Various victims have already been denounced. What could happen next is not predictable. Days of bloodshed and terror perhaps lie ahead for unfortunate Bavaria; may God spare it such a grave disaster!\n\nMeanwhile a war against the Clergy is also beginning. Access for priests to the Military Hospitals has been strictly forbidden, contrary to the decision of the Soldiers’ Council of the hospitals themselves. A priest may only provide his services in case of death and only if the patient so requested. Moreover, Mass is denied, and religious counsel is denied. The arrest of the leading personalities of the former Royal Court has also begun. Taken as hostages so far have been the Grand Master of Ceremonies, the Head of the King’s Civil Cabinet, several members of the Senate, many officials; their safety has been assured, if and so long as there are no further counter-revolutionary attempts. No one is safe any longer in his own house. Today the dissolution of the army is being announced, and the creation of a republican security guard force formed primarily from the proletariat. All of the accomplishments, sacrifices and deeds of the “Bavarian People’s Party” and of the parties of order, to create a Parliament that could give the Province tranquility and peace, have been miserably destroyed by the rash act of the assassination of Eisner. There is now just one tenuous hope, and it is that the Majority Socialists will not go along with the Independents and the Spartacists. In that case it would be impossible to create a republic directed by Councils of soldiers, workers and farmers, since they would not have the majority of the people behind them, who at least until now have been for the aforesaid Socialists. But the situation today is still so murky that it is impossible to make any predictions. Meanwhile the Communist movement is spreading to all of Bavaria; to Nuremberg, to Augsburg where revolutionary activities of exceptional seriousness have occurred (in the latter city some of the demonstrators broke into the Bishop’s palace), and a state of siege has been proclaimed there. (note: I learned today from a reliable source that the Bishop of Augsburg managed to flee, miraculously, and only the Canons were present there).\n\nHumbly bowing to kiss the Sacred Purple, with sentiments of profound veneration, I have the honor to remain,\n\nYour Most Reverend Eminence’s\n\nMost Humble, Most Devoted, Most Obliged Servant,\n\nEugenio, Archbishop of Sardis\n\nApostolic Nuncio\n\nSource: www.Pacelli-Edition.de, Document No. 317.\n\nFeb. 25, 1919 Gasparri to Pacelli:\n\nMost Illustrious and Reverend Signore,\n\nYour Most Illustrious Excellency’s Report No. 12015, of February 8th, reached me in due course, on the subject of the transmission of a Memorial directed by various Jewish persons and societies of Frankfurt on Main to the Bishop of Fulda, for the purpose of obtaining the good offices of the Holy Father; to bring an end to the cruelties that are said to have been committed up to now against the Hebrews in Poland and Galicia.\n\nAlready in December last year the Holy See had involved in this matter Monsignor Ratti, Apostolic Visitor in Poland, who thus wrote me from Warsaw, dated this January 15th:\n\nConcerning the pogroms and excesses against the Jews, about which Your Most Reverend Eminence sent me his venerated encrypted cable, it has however occupied me and I am occupying myself and already have some documents in hand; but nothing up to now is very clear and definitive. In Warsaw, certainly, nothing has happened, I say nothing of any importance and seriousness, the Hebrews there are incredibly numerous (300 thousand!), they are abhorred there, but not molested, much less persecuted.\n\nIn Kielce, on the 11th and 12th of November 1918, there were serious riots against the Hebrews, of whom four were mortally laid low, 250 injured or badly beaten up. I have before my eyes the minutes of a session of that city council on the first of December: the Hebrews gave blows to the Christians, the Christians to the Hebrews; I expect further information soon…\n\nSource: www.Pacelli-Edition.de, Document No. 7401.\n\nMarch 2, 1919 Article in Münchener Katholische Kirchenzeitung, no. 9, pages 67-68, promoting Jewish-Masonic conspiracy theory and reviewing a new book on the same theme:\n\n“Freemasonry”\n\nThe value of a polemic can best be recognized by its reception among its opponents. If one applies this standard to the new work of the well-known German radical parliamentarian, the author of “World Freemasonry, World Revolution, World Republic” (Dr. Wichtl’s proprietary publishing house, price 10 Crowns), one will come to the conviction that, from the standpoint of German-ness there is no book nearly so valuable as this one. The uproar among the Freemasons and their adherents over the author’s disclosures and inferences will be enormous! Never before could a work about Freemasons make them so uncomfortable as this.\n\nWith amazing thoroughness, Dr. Wichtl reveals the works of Freemasonry, which in every country is led by Jews or utilized by them for their own purposes; he sets forth their pernicious purposes and shows the interrelationships between the Lodges and each major political event. Based on a far-reaching mastery of Freemasonic writings, he brings forth proof that nearly every political upheaval occurring in the past 200 years in Europe has had its origin and leadership in the Freemasonic associations, that not only were the revolution in Portugal and the assassination of the Austrian heir in Sarajevo, which was directly instigated by the newly founded (and promoted from Budapest and Paris) Serbian Lodge, the result of Masonic activity, but also the revolutions in Germany and in Austria. The purposes of Freemasonry are not, as often assumed, the fostering of religious and humanitarian concepts, but rather the destruction of authority and the building up of its own power. To have brought forward this evidence is one of the main services of the foregoing work.\n\nThe chapter about Freemasonry in Austria is worthy of the most special attention. Here is identified not only the political activity of Freemasonry in the time of Maria Theresa, but also – what will arouse especial interest – the participation of Jewry in the Lodges and their leadership. In this connection the book’s enumeration of the masters of the Vienna Lodges is extraordinarily informative. We find there a Dr. Holländer, Dr. Engel, Dr. Frankl, Dr. Ornstein, a Dr. Heller, Dr. Schick, A. Kirsch, B. Schiller and the like, not to overlook the “Freemason Prince,” Dr. Krapalik.\n\nAlso the statements about Freemasonry in Germany deserve to be specially noted. In this part Wichtl shows how well the head directors of the Masons understand to deceive the great masses of their lower-order brethren and leave them unclear about their true purposes, by the use of slogans and false principles, so that even those who think they are in influential positions are actually nothing but instruments of the “Princes” who stand above them. In this connection it should not go unmentioned that the highest “Prince” of Freemasonry in the period immediately before the outbreak of the War was none less than a Herr Kohn in Frankfurt am Main, a fact that was carefully hushed up in all the yearbooks of German Freemasonry, undoubtedly for weighty reasons, while all the other leading Freemasons are listed by name.\n\nNo less interesting than the statements about the participation of Freemasons in great political matters is what is brought into the light about the role of Jewry in Freemasonry. Even without being an opponent of the Jews, one must come to the conviction on the basis of the foregoing material, just as a significant Christian Freemason once expressed in these words: “The Freemason is nothing but an artificial Jew.” If one considers, as Dr. Wichtl likewise points out, that all Masonic brothers are obligated to promote each other wherever they can and to stand by each other in all dangers, yes, and to alert them to any threatening dangers, then one can assess what incomparable support Jewry possesses in Freemasonry, in which it is so numerously represented.\n\nGerman originals: page 67 and page 68\n\nMarch 1919 Publication of Weltfreimaurerei, Weltrevolution, Weltrepublik by Friedrich Wichtl; excerpts:\n\n... (p. vi) I had not previously concerned myself seriously with Freemasonry; the Leo Taxil hoax was just a dim memory to me, the names of the infamous Miss Diana Vaughan, her sister Sophie Walder, the devils Bitru and many others came to life in front of me: reason enough to approach the matter with skepticism. But the evidence was so clear that I took it upon myself to track the matter to ground. Then it came to pass shortly thereafter, in November 1917, that a very well informed and reliable source shared with me that Dr. Karl Kramarsch was a Freemason and belonged to the “Grand Orient of France.” So I began to acquaint myself with the literature of Freemasonry, at first for no other reason than to gain clarity for myself on the important issue: a Light Seeker diligently striving to get at the truth.\n\n... (p. vii) Even before the appearance of my book, a storm of disapproval went out from the realm of the Freemasonic press. The “Building Stone,” the monthly journal of the National Supreme Lodge of Hamburg in Berlin, was prepared to defame me even before a single line of my book had come into view! A “hatchet job” they called it, and again a “hatchet job” and yet again a “hatchet job.” That was printed in the “Building Stone,” issues 1-2, January-February 1919; my book appeared for the first time on the 8th of March that year. This senseless uproar caused my publisher to make a simple announcement; it was called especially “provocative” that there was a heading in the table of contents for the 8th chapter, entitled “The Role of the Jews in Freemasonry.” In issues 6-7 the “Building Stone” turned once again to my book. They called it a “slanderous writing,” a “pamphlet.” Most embarrassing to them was my disclosure that at the summit of German Freemasonry, at the time of the outbreak of the World War, stood Supreme Master Kohn...\n\nThat the man who stood at the summit of the entire German Freemasonry was named Kohn, they could not dispute. But that this Herr Kohn should be a Jew, that made them nervous, and they considered it an insult to all of them. And so the effort had to be made to turn this alleged Jew Kohn into a zealous Christian...\n\nA terrible hailstorm broke out on me in Vienna. The hailstones were so big that I almost wanted to take shelter under the mysterious carpet of some Lodge or other, (p. ix) until the storm had passed over. But since I am a Christian and do not consider allowing my person to be separated from my convictions, I certainly did not let myself be found as a Light Seeker in any Vienna Lodge. For in the Vienna Lodges there are – according to the well-known testimony of the deceased State Court President Holzinger – a hundred two Jews among every hundred Freemasons. But that is not possible! That is surely an exaggeration?! Not at all; here is the evidence: The Supreme Master Dr. Richard Schlesinger is – a Jew; the deputy Supreme Master Dr. Karl Ornstein is – a Jew; the deputy Supreme Master Dr. Adolf Kapralik is – a Jew; the Supreme Speaker Dr. Emil Frankl is – a Jew; the Supreme Speaker Dr. Gustav Spieler is – a Jew; the Supreme Speaker Edward Zinner is – a Jew; the Supreme Registrar Heinrich Glücksmann is – a Jew. Is that enough, or is more “proof” desired?\n\n... (p. xii) The forger Margiotta who worked in association with Leo Taxil (whose work I possess also in the French original, but which I refrained from using as an impure source, whereas Margiotta doubtless said the truth)... Jewish Italian Supreme Master Adriano Lemmi ...\n\n(p. 1) Introduction and Overview In the trial of the assassins of the royal couple who were next-in-line to the Austrian throne, it was convincingly shown that not only did the assassination plan have its origin in the French Supreme Freemason Lodge in Paris, but that some of the assassins were themselves Freemasons.\n\n... Gives secret details of Masonic rites and practices, different types of Lodges, details of the various degrees of Masons ...\n\n(p.49) The Italian brothers appear to give much effort, in fact, to honor Satan as their supreme Lord and Master: Salute, o Satana, O ribellione! ...\n\n(p. 50) Freemasonry and Judaism\n\nAn expert on Freemasonry speaks of it concisely and to the point: Its origin lies in England, the building of its higher degrees followed in France, its intellectual formation in Germany, the externals, however, stem from Judaism.\n\nThat is correct, but concerning the last point, incomplete. Spiritual Masonry is known to be associated with Solomon’s building of the temple, and this wise king plays a large role in Freemasonry...\n\n(p. 52) The six-pointed star is supposed to be for Free Masons “an image of the activity of the Word of God, the free essence of divine power!” This flaming star is always found over the door on the east side of the Lodge hall.\n\nWith this, however, we set forth just a few relationships between Free Masonry and Judaism; in fact there are an enormous number. Solomon’s throne, for example, appears in Anderson’s constitution book as the seat of the Supreme Master, Solomon’s seal plays an equally great role in the Lodges as Solomon’s signet ring...\n\n(p. 53) Even though Free Masonry has so little to do with Christianity, it is very much influenced by the Bible and belief in the Bible... There are Lodges in which the vows are no longer taken on the Bible; for the “Supreme State Lodges of Germany,” by contrast, the Bible is not only an image, but a sort of rulebook. (Remarkably ...)\n\nAccording to all this one could almost come to the conclusion that Freemasonry was founded by the Jews. This view, however, is not historically sustainable. The founders of this association were on the whole Christians who, in the English manner, had a special predilection for the Old Testament. One of them was the well known English preacher Dr. Jacob Anderson, who published the well known “constitution book of Free and Accepted Masons; ...\n\n(p. 54) but also the names of others have gone into the afterworld, and a Jew is not found among them. And nevertheless a bridge here leads over to Judaism: The English Jewish antiquary Elias Ashmole, who occupied himself much with secret arts, was taken into the Work of Masonry at the time in the year 1646 and gathered a lot of documents about Freemasonry, which then were used in the erection of the Supreme Lodge of England in the year 1717.\n\nChapter VIII. The Role of the Jews in Freemasonry\n\nHardly had Free Masonry been founded than the Jews tried to gain a strong foothold in it. That was, to be sure, not so easy; at first indeed the Jews had been denied entry to the Lodges. For the first time around the year 1780, in Frankfurt am Main, there arose two Jewish Lodges, unbeknownst to the other Lodges...\n\nIn Hungary there ensued the refounding of Lodges at the end of the ‘60s in the 19th century; already by the middle of the 1870s the Jewish Freemasons held the leadership . . .\n\nNo Lodges without Jews! This slogan of the Freemasonic journal “Acacia,” concerning the rule in the French Lodges, applied with triple strength in the Hungarian Lodges. . . .\n\n... (p. 57) It is similar in Germany with the Berlin Lodges that come under the Hamburg Supreme Lodge; the Lodge “Victoria” in Berlin has, for example, Masters Schey ... Rosenberg ... Marcuse ...\n\nBut not only in Germany, in Hungary, and in Austria, no, throughout the whole world the Jews are the most energetic and active Freemasons and know how to breathe their spirit into the Lodges and turn them to their own ends...\n\nLet us turn a quick glance toward Italy and perceive that its famous Freemason, Ernesto Nathan, has come into full view. Who is Ernesto Nathan? ...\n\n... (p.60) In short: What is influential in Italy is Freemasons, among whom the Jews play a prominent role. “This race has numerous representatives in the Italian parliament” – says the French Freemason newspaper “Revue Maçonnique” [“Masonic Review”] (January 1908 no. 334 p. 1). “Far better than anywhere else, the Hebrew spirit has attained its goal in Italy.” (Ibid. page 3.)\n\nThis observation about the “Hebrew spirit” in Italy may well be right, but in other places as well it is exactly the same. In France, for example, we encounter Jews repeatedly as founders and diligent representatives of Freemason orders. Among these, for example, is the Parisian Jew Etienne Morin; he was the major disseminator of the “Scottish (highest degree) System” that actually had virtually nothing to do with Scotland... How thoroughly this high degree system is dependent on Biblical history and saturated with the Jewish spirit, is seen upon a fleeting glance at the titles provided for the degrees: there we find the vindictive grade of Knight Kadosch (30th degree), then a Prince of Lebanon, a Prince of the Tabernacle, and even a High Prince of Jerusalem!\n\nAnd now? The native ranks of nobility are done away with, the princes cast aside, the Kaiser dethroned ... But it will not take long until their seats are occupied once again. The Kaisers are dead, long live the “Kaisers of the East and the West!” Pave the way for all who are qualified: for Haase, Eisner, Liebknecht, Adler, Kohn! Pave the way for Bela Kun! Friedländer! Bettelheim! Toller! Levien! Leviné! Pave the way for all these who “live it up” among us, enrich themselves and want to enslave us! ...\n\nThe whole similar rite of Memphis owes its origin to a certain Samuel Honis from Cairo ...\n\nBut – one could object – there are self-styled foundations of orders which have no right to be considered Freemasonry. The “German Supreme Lodge” has never recognized them, thus they have no right to recognition. Granted! Only the “Grand Orient of France” has recognized them and that (p. 62) suffices completely, even if from the German perspective these orders are seen as false foundations for the purpose of bleeding us via Light Seekers and gullible people. Moreover, this is not about the issue of whether they are recognized or not, but merely about the evidence that Jews play a role of calling the tune in Freemasonry everywhere, in France as well as Italy, in Hungary as much as in Austria, and especially so in Germany. Or do you want to deny that the Jew Cremieux, one of the heads of the Scottish Rite, played a key leading role in France? Was he not part of the February Revolution (1848) alongside other Freemasons of the provisional government? Or the one-eyed Jew Gambetta? Do you want to dispute that the high ranking Freemason Gambetta was the one who, in 1869, inveigled the separation of Church and State into the influential Platform of Belleville? After all, can you deny that one of the political goals of World Masonry is to accomplish the separation of Church and State everywhere? And that this, where it has already occurred, is chiefly a work of Freemasonry? And within Freemasonry, particularly a work of the Jews?\n\nLet us see yet again how it is in England.\n\nEngland, including Scotland, counts 225,000 Freemasons. Among them are 43,000 Jews, that is nearly a fifth part; yet there are Lodges that are almost exclusively composed of Jews, as for example the Shelley Lodge, which comprises three-fourths Jews, and even purely Jewish Lodges, like the “Hiram Lodge”; the latter indeed gave rise to so many scandals that the Supreme Master of the order, Prince Edward Albert, later Edward VII, had to decide to dissolve it. Especially significant are the following Lodge names: King Solomon, King David, King Saul, Baron Hirsch, Lord Rothschild, Henry Bernstein, Sir Albert Sassoon, and others... Especially since the Franco-Prussian War, the Jews have victoriously swarmed into the Lodges, while even here the Christian brothers have preferred to surrender the field to the Jews without a fight. . . .\n\n(p. 64) From these developments, which could be expanded upon with countless further examples, suffice it to say that the Jews are represented within Freemasonry in a strength far exceeding their numbers; hence it follows that the Jewish Freemasons are everywhere the most active and persistent workers and understand how to bring their influence to bear; and it also follows that they strive for the leadership within Freemasonry in all countries, indeed in many states (p.65) they have already seized it for themselves and in their way, that is, striving to use that leadership primarily for the advantage of their race; finally it follows that it is especially Jews who initiate the policy of the Lodges and influence the other brothers toward the same ways.\n\nIf this is really the way matters are today, then the issue is clearly presented, why does almost no one in the entire German Reich see through their game, revolt against it, and stand up to tyrannical Judaism?...\n\n(p.163) ... Communists and Freemasons got along rather well. The communist Soviet regime, for example, took over the collection begun by the Freemasons for the purpose of erecting a memorial to the Freemason poet Br. Andreas Ady; the Freemason daily newspaper “Vilag” became the organ of the communist People’s Commissariat for Education, and so forth. That the house of the Hungarian Supreme Lodge was requisitioned and occupied by the guild of the – housekeepers (!) – was less congenial, to be sure, but nevertheless this deed was reported by the “Vienna Freemason Newspaper” without the slightest word of reproach; a sign that they had reconciled ...\n\nChapter XXIV Via World Revolution to the Freemasonic World Republic\n\nIn a full dozen countries the revolutionary activity of Freemasonry has by now been established. The spirit is, at its root, always the same, and the end goal is always a republic...\n\n(p. 195) But let us return to the characteristic concepts of this sect. To free people from the domination of the “Powers” was also the goal of the Illuminati Order, which played a great role in the second half of the 18th century and has many points in common with Freemasonry. Even then the concept of a World Brotherhood and World Republic exercised its charm, and powerful thinkers such as Immanuel Kant spoke up for it. In the broader ranks of the German people, however, the republican ideal of government first appeared in the 19th century. It was represented particularly by the revolutionary and Freemason, Mazzini, whose secret confidantes were hard at work throughout Europe. For Mazzini, the republic was “the only conceivable just form of government; the people are everything.” But the “people” are only “everything” if they agree with Mazzini’s point of view and take up the words of this lord and master; if they do not, then they are only an “ignorant and corrupt mob” ...\n\nChapter XXV Freemasonry and World War\n\nThis issue goes far beyond the title of this book and thus could be left aside; the reader who has followed line for line up to now must surely have come to the unavoidable conclusion: If Freemasonry is really striving toward a World Republic – and about that there is no doubt – if they instigate revolutions everywhere toward this end, and about that there is really no doubt, then they are certainly not guiltless of the horrible, enormous revolution that has occurred, namely the World War itself... (p. 237)\n\nChapter XXVI The Freemasonic Peace Program of Wilson\n\nThat the Freemasons bear a large share of the guilt for the outbreak of the World War ...\n\nIt is nevertheless still said that the Freemasons apparently had nothing to do with the World War and its frightful armaments and destruction, but rather with a World Revolution, which their ideals brought about, especially the downfall of the European dynasties and the introduction of a World Republic. If this line of thought is correct, then it will be confirmed by the end result. And so must, also, the Wilson Peace Program, which represents the high point of the historical developments brought about by the War, correspond with the chief demands of the goals of Freemasonry, and all the more so, since Wilson himself is a Freemason.\n\nConclusion\n\n(p. 257) ... This book had to be written, it was a moral necessity. And it had to come from a politician known to Germans, not from quarters that could be suspected as “clerical” or “ultramontane” or “Jesuitical.” The “clericals” have truly done enough in this field to enlighten the people; if they were not believed, that is for the most part our own fault.\n\nOne more word now about the republic. From my writings, any impartial reader would be led to the conclusion that I am not much inclined to the republican form of government. My standpoint is really this:\n\nA good German-Austrian republic led by ethnic Germans, in which everyone is filled with good will for the common good, is a hundred times preferable to me over a bad monarchy.\n\nA good monarchy, on the other hand, with a capable, well-advised, smart, hardworking, virtuous, reliable German Kaiser at the head, is a thousand times preferable to me over an arbitrary lawyer-run republic under a “Mason Prince” of the likes of an Eisner, Lenin, Adler or Kohn.\n\nCitation: Friedrich Wichtl, Weltfreimaurerei, Weltrevolution, Weltrepublik (Vienna, 1919; 5th ed., Munich: J.F.

The old and ever new conflict between Christianity and materialism, between faith and unbelief, will be ever more concentrated in the future upon the platform plank: for or against “separation.”\n\nNo Christian nation where State and Church have worked up to now hand in hand will avoid this frightful struggle. No one should give in to deception in this regard. Just as the subversive idea of the great French Revolution of 1789 flew right through every civilized country and brought the 18th century under the yoke of liberalism, from which the nations have been freeing themselves only slowly and through the most bitter struggles, so the idea of separation is hurrying through all states that have been bound to the Christian Church by faith and history, bringing them violent crises and fateful struggles. Not without reason is it maintained that the transition to a republican form of government in recent history is so self-evidently bound up with separation of Church and State that it is directly considered the formal obligation of every new republican state to immediately implement this separation...\n\nIf we want to prevent separation according to the French, that is the Freemasonic, anti-Church model, then ...\n\nCitation: Münchener Katholische Kirchenzeitung [Munich Catholic Church Newspaper], 1919, no. 9, p.66.\n\nMarch 10, 1919 Pope Benedict XV’s statement about Palestine, spoken at a Consistory in Rome on March 10th and published in English translation by The Tablet:\n\n...But there is one matter on which We are most specially anxious, and that is the fate of the Holy Places, on account of the special dignity and importance for which they are so venerated by every Christian. Who can ever tell the full story of all the efforts of Our predecessors to free them from the dominion of infidels, the heroic deeds and the blood shed by the Christians of the West through the centuries? And now that, amid the rejoicing of all good men, they have finally returned into the hands of the Christians, Our anxiety is most keen as to the decisions which the Peace Congress at Paris is soon to take concerning them. For surely it would be a terrible grief for Us and for all the Christian faithful if infidels were placed in a privileged and prominent position; much more if those most holy sanctuaries of the Christian religion were given into the charge of non-Christians.\n\nWe learn, too, that non-Catholic foreigners, furnished with abundant means and profiting by the great misery and ruin that the war has brought on Palestine, are there spreading their errors. Truly harrowing indeed is the thought that souls should be losing their faith and hastening to damnation on that very spot where Jesus Christ Our Lord gained for them life eternal at the cost of His Blood. Helpless, deprived of all they have, those poor souls are stretching out to us suppliant arms imploring not only food and clothing but the rebuilding of their churches, the re-opening of their schools, the restoration of their missions. To this end We have for Our part already set aside a certain sum, and most willingly would We give more if the present poverty of the Holy See allowed. But it is our intention to excite the interests of the Bishops of the whole Catholic world that they may take to heart such a noble and holy cause, arousing among all the faithful that sense of active charity which their ancestors always showed towards their brethren of the Orient.\n\nSource: The Tablet, Mar. 22, 1919, pp. 353-354.\n\nMarch 16, 1919 Münchener Katholische Kirchenzeitung, no. 11, page 83:\n\n“What Is Bolshevism?”\n\nAt the end of November 1918, I was fleeing Russia and traveling from Frankfurt on the Oder to Berlin in a jam-packed rail car with soldiers and some Berlin laborers who had just come from the province of Posen and had hoarded potatoes, as they told me, at the rate of 75 Pfennigs a pound. Impressed by the terrors I had experienced at the hands of the Red Guards during the previous ten days, they were soon talking with me about Bolshevism. It was really peculiar that not one of the people in my compartment knew anything about the Bolsheviks, even though all of them had participated in the Berlin Revolution and were avid newspaper readers, from what they said. I had to be the one to tell them what the Bolsheviks really are and what they want.\n\nIt still happens to me often, both close to home and in foreign places, that I am asked what the Bolsheviks really are, or I encounter totally false views about Bolshevism. For many people, the Bolsheviks are just a bugaboo to use to scare Progressives, or to scare people away from joining revolutionary parties, just as I once heard a lady in Poland say to her ill-mannered child: be good, or else the Bolsheviks will come and take you away. Bolshevism is not so dangerous, according to these people. Others, on the other hand, see in Bolshevism the embodiment of all evil, as when a Russian Count told me: I never used to believe that mankind descended from the apes. But since I saw how the Bolsheviks murdered my son, I believe that man is really a beast. Or when I was once invited to an estate for a luncheon, and in the course of the meal there arose talk about the Bolsheviks, and the lady next to me gave a shriek and fainted. The word Bolshevik worked on her like a knock-out drug. For the Bolsheviks had condemned her husband and her four children. Even the following has actually been encountered: In Berlin at the end of November a couple gentlemen of well-bred class, who said they were good Catholics who fulfill their religious duties, wanted to show me that Bolshevism not only has religious merit, but is actually the religion of the future, the fulfillment of the teaching of the divine Savior.\n\nWhat, in reality, is Bolshevism?\n\nThe word Bolsheviki comes from the Russian word bolshoi, which means “more.” Thus it could be thought that the Bolshevik Party is what we call in Germany the “Majority Socialists.” But that is not correct; the opposite is the case. In Russia the Bolsheviks are the extreme, radical wing of the former Russian Socialist Party. The Bolsheviks did not first receive their name in the recent Revolution. That has existed, rather, since the year 1903. That was when the Russian Socialist Party split apart in two directions: the Bolsheviks or maximalists; those were the extremists; and the Mensheviks (the word comes from “mensché” or “less”) or the minimalists, the moderates. The maximalists or Bolsheviks are the most determined Socialists. They want to take the ideals and goals of Social Democracy, as set forth by Marx, the father of Social Democracy, in his Communist Manifesto of 1848, and implement them at all cost down to the smallest detail. They know nothing of holding back and nothing of being humane. What they want must be implemented by power and terror. They have no desire to negotiate with any parties. Because, they say, the people will be cheated in all negotiations and the capitalists will get off scot-free. The Bourgeoisie must be completely annihilated by any means. That is why they wanted, from the beginning, the arming of the Proletariat and the disarming of all property owners. In contrast to them, the Mensheviks represented the moderate standpoint. They also wanted the goals of Social Democracy from the outset, but not by power, rather by peaceful, calm development in cooperation with the other Socialist parties and with the Bourgeoisie. They desired that all elements of the population should work together for the upbuilding of civilization and the elevation of the poorest classes of the people. Thus the Bolsheviks or maximalists correspond to our Spartacus League with Rosa Luxemburg and Liebknecht, and perhaps still with our Independent Socialist Party with Haase and Ledebour and Eisner. Their opponents, the Mensheviks or minimalists, would then correspond to our Majority Social Democrats with Ebert and Scheidemann and Auer.\n\nThere were, at the time in Russia, however, a full dozen Socialist parties, which almost all stood in contrast to the Bolsheviks. At the moment the Bolsheviks officially call themselves: the Russian Communist Party.\n\nThe leader of the Russian Bolsheviks and the current lord of Russia is Lenin, Vladimir Ulyanov Lenin, a lawyer from Simbirsk on the Volga. As a result of his Bolshevik agitating, he had to flee at one time, and he returned from Switzerland to Russia after the fall of the Russian Czar. In Switzerland he had lived at the expense of the former German Government, and for his return journey to Russia, the German Embassy gave him a passport and a false name, and placed a rail car at his disposal, which traveled as a neutral entity right through Germany to Russia with Lenin and Trotsky.\n\nOne cannot outline the character of Lenin better than what the well-known Russian Socialist writer Maxim Gorky did in his newspaper Novaya Zhizn, in the issue of November 10, 1917, which was three days after the Bolshevik Revolution: “Vladimir Lenin is ushering in the Socialist storm on the government in Russia according to Netschajew’s recipe: Full steam ahead!” Lenin himself is by nature a man of exceptional power; for twenty-five years he stood in the ranks of the fighters for the final triumph of Socialism. He is one of the most significant and most original phenomena within the international Social Democratic movement. He is a highly gifted man, with all the attributes necessary for a leader. At the same time he is signally lacking in morals, necessary for this role, and a self-disciplined, merciless relationship to the life of the popular masses.\n\nHe works with the well-being and life of the people like a chemist in a laboratory. But while the chemist uses lifeless material and thereby attains results that have value for life, Lenin operates with living material and brings ruin to the people and the revolution.\n\nNote from the Editor: Many may consider it unusual to find a discussion of “Bolshevism” in a Church newspaper. The continuations that will appear in the following issues will show that this is well justified.\n\nGerman originals: first page and second page\n\nMarch 23, 1919 Münchener Katholische Kirchenzeitung, no. 12, page 93:\n\n“Ecclesiastical Review”\n\nThe Holy Father held a secret Consistory with 22 Cardinals taking part. In his Allocution, the Holy Father expressed what a lively interest the Roman Church takes in the Eastern Churches. The Pope recalled, among other things, the recently successful creation of a union for the Eastern Churches and the foundation of an Italian-Albanian seminary at Grottaferrata, and he pointed out that during the war he made crystal clear his special concern for Armenia, Syria, Palestine and Lebanon and gave a helping hand to the peoples there. In relation to the future form of the Ottoman Empire, the Pope expressed the desire that the Peace Conference might deliver the Holy Places into the hands of the Christians. It would be extremely painful for the Holy See if a predominant position in Palestine were conceded to unbelievers, or if the Holy Places were to come into the hands of non-Christians.\n\nThe Holy Father received the Ambassador of the Hungarian Republic in an audience, Dr. Oskar Charmann, who also temporarily represented the Hungarian Republic in Vienna. The Hungarian Republic is working to establish contact directly with the Vatican concerning the resolution of various issues.- The “International League of Nations Conference” meeting in Bern, at which 24 nations are represented via peace associations and league of nations organizations, brought up a resolution whereby the involvement of the Holy Father in the league of nations would be provided for.\n\nIn place of the German Benedictines, to whom the Church of the Dormition in Jerusalem had been given, four Belgian Benedictines have set off for Palestine. This generally reflects the accomplishment of a complete separation of the Belgian Benedictines from the German branch of the Benedictine Order (Beuron Congregation) with the approval of the Holy See.\n\nGerman original\n\nMarch 28, 1919 Pacelli to Gasparri:\n\nRe: Political Situation\n\nMost Reverend Eminence,\n\nThe domestic political situation in Germany, and particularly in Bavaria, is becoming ever more grim and threatening. The Majority Socialists are losing more ground every day, while their former followers are swelling the ranks of the Independents and the Spartacists. For this reason it is thought that the Bavarian Minister-Presidency of the Socialist Hoffman will not be able to survive long. Above all, the Spartacists are conducting an extremely extensive and active propaganda campaign. In crowded assemblies right in the public streets, Communist orators are preaching the new word with fervid, captivating language and are winning over very large numbers of followers. Thus the thought is spread in the minds of all that new and terrible upheavals are being prepared, which will lead to the triumph of Bolshevism. On the other hand, if I am to believe a report that came to me quite recently from Minister Erzberger, it is thought in Berlin that the Russian Government may be considering an invasion of Germany through southern Latvia, simultaneously with a domestic uprising of the German Bolsheviks to cooperate thereby in the Soviet victory.\n\nThe progress of the extreme parties is fed and favored by a sense of desperation into which the population has fallen because of the prospect of adamant peace conditions that will be imposed, it is said, by the Entente. A distinguished and habitually moderate German diplomat expressed openly to me yesterday that in the event that the imposed conditions are intolerable and reduce Germany to slavery, he himself would prefer Bolshevism. Then Germany, united to Russia, and with the support of Hungary, would become invincible. Russia has inexhausible natural resources, and Germany has the culture and technology to use them. France and Italy would be running a formidable risk, all the more since their armies, which indeed fought valiantly against the former autocratic states, would be difficult to deploy now against their proletarian brethren in Russia and Germany. May God inspire the men of State meeting now in the Paris Peace Conference with sentiments of moderation and thus spare Europe from a new scourge more horrible than the past war!\n\nSource: www.Pacelli-Edition.de, Document No. 3064.\n\nMarch 30, 1919 “Ecclesiastical Review” section of Münchener Katholische Kirchenzeitung, no. 13, page 101:\n\n“Ecclesiastical Review”\n\nOn the occasion of the Congress of Italian Diocesan Associations, the Holy Father declared that he recognizes their intention to summon the powers of Catholics for the realization of religious and social programs...\n\nThe Osservatore Romano writes: “The Roman Question exists and will always exist so long as the Holy See does not find itself in a normal relationship to that to which it has a divine right, and which it cannot renounce without committing suicide. The purpose of the Vatican is directed to the independence of the Vatican from the supreme Italian civil authorities! That is exactly what the Roman Question consists of. The Church founded by Christ is international, supranational and independent. The subordination of the Vatican under a civil authority would splinter the Catholic Church and dissolve it into so many national churches that it would cease to exist. The Osservatore Romano denies that the Pope wanted to participate in the Peace Conference; he had decided from the beginning not to participate if the peace of the victors was going to be imposed on the vanquished. - In a letter to the Bishops of the entire Catholic world, the Holy Father requests effective support for the sad condition of the Catholic population in Palestine, in light of the reports about them received from the Patriarch of Jerusalem; he thereby also points out the necessity of preserving the Catholic schools in Palestine and supporting the Catholics there, so that they are put in an enhanced position to oppose the efforts of the non-Catholics...\n\nBy a Ministerial Decree of January 25th concerning religious instruction, the Protestant clergy and religion professors of Munich are given status. In their name, and with their agreement, Deacon Lembert writes in issue no. 3 of the “Evangelical Community Paper” of March 1919: On the question of religious instruction, the current Government has taken the position, in the official decree of January 25th, that no child may be forced into religious instruction or worship services against the will of the parents, and that teaching personnel are not obligated to take part in the supervision of students during worship services. At first this might appear not really so regrettable - it should be, as it appears, only the removal of a compulsion; but whoever knows the intentions of the State Government and also understands something of the technique of the school policy, will recognize clearly that this decree is the beginning of forcing religious instruction out of the schools... [ellipsis in original] One certainly wonders, moreover, why a provisional government dares to issue such a decisive regulation...\n\nGerman original\n\nApr. 3, 1919 Pacelli to Gasparri:\n\nRe: Presentation rights for parishes and benefices in Bavaria\n\nMost Reverend Eminence,\n\nBy Report No. 11066 of November 28, 1918, Monsignor Auditor of this Nunciature, in my temporary absence, sent Your Most Reverend Eminence a petition addressed to the Holy Father by the Archbishop of Munich and Freising, also in the name of the other Bishops of Bavaria, concerning the presentation rights of the current Government for the parishes and the benefices (non-consistorial). In this petition the aforesaid Bishops, “to prevent ruin and greater evils,” asked “that the Apostolic See use indults (presentation rights) still valid also for the present government to tolerate its worthiness in such a way that we Bishops would designate three suitable names from which the present government would choose one, on the condition that payments to benefices and churches would be made in the future and this would be only for the time being.”\n\nYour Eminence, in Encrypted Cable No. 169 of December 27, deigned to instruct Monsignor Schioppa to communicate to the Bavarian Bishops that “the Holy See is disposed to examine the needs of the new situation if a new Government in Bavaria is durably constituted and is willing to negotiate with it. In the meantime Bishops, in individual cases, can act on their own, in a way solely de facto, without prejudicing Canon Law principles and without compromising the Holy See, possibly by setting up temporary parish administrators.”\n\nMonsignor Auditor conveyed the above-referenced response without delay to Archbishop Faulhaber and via him to the other Bavarian Prelates.\n\nThe difficult abnormal political conditions in Bavaria being prolonged, however, the issue has inevitably suffered new complications both in terms of law and by way of events.\n\nIn terms of law, the Bishops, while being unanimous in their intention not to cause any prejudice to canonical principles and to the rights of the Holy See, do not agree rather in the concrete issue, whether or not the presentation by the current Government can be allowed for the aforesaid parishes and benefices, and thus whether it is licit for the Bishops to propose the required list of three names to the competent Ministry. So, in fact, the Archbishop of Munich is inclined to maintain the necessity for an indult from the Holy See, while the Archbishop of Bamberg (as seen in his letter to Abp. Faulhaber dated March 20, 1919, which he shared with me) maintains that so long as the Concordat remains in effect, the Bishops can allow the presentation under discussion and he also proposes the formula to be adopted in the future for the three-name list. The excellent Archbishop von Hauck supports his opinion by a memorandum by Monsignor Hollweck, a copy of which I have the honor to send here-enclosed to Your Eminence. This learned canon lawyer begins by observing that Concordats are always concluded between the Holy See, as the supreme and universal representative of the ecclesiastical power, and the Government of the State, whatever may be the organ that has the power and represents it, whether it is that of a Monarch, or an oligarchy or a parliament that exercises its rights by means of a specified plenipotentiary, the Government of the State presents itself in every territory as a power subsisting in fact and immutable, derived from the existence of the State itself and in which the State itself exists in a concrete form; which, then, however at the moment this power is manifested and how it is exercised, is a matter irrelevant in itself. Therefore, continues Monsignor Hollweck, the Concordats remain undoubtedly in effect, since the State, with which they are concluded, exists at least substantially with its territory, however the State itself may have changed, and he cites the words of the Most Eminent Cardinal Cavagnis (Institu. Juris publ. eccles., I, 694): “… [extended Latin quotation]” Thus (adds Monsignor Hollweck) the Concordat concluded with Napoleon I continued in effect under the Bourbons, then under the Duke of Orléans, thus under the Republic, and then under Napoleon III, and finally again under the Republic until 1905. The Holy See upholds as a firm principle that changes in the form of the Government do not affect the validity and duration of the Concordat. Only the provision (according still to Monsignor Hollweck) concerning the appointment of Bishops, which in a totally exceptional way constitutes a personal privilege conceded to the King of Bavaria and only so long as he is Catholic, has ceased with the fall of the Monarchy, having lost the subject of the privilege itself. As a result of this, concludes the aforesaid canon lawyer, the Government’s right of presentation for the so-called royal parishes must be recognized without hesitation, even with regard to the current holders in fact of power in the State, and it is also up to them to decide how and by what official of the Government they want to exercise that right, it being a matter of total indifference whether it is done by the Ministry of Justice or the Ministry of Education and Cultural Affairs. It is also unimportant what religion the State official in question belongs to, since it comes into question here only insignificantly. It would certainly be convenient if it was only done by Catholics, but membership in the Jewish religion for such an official of the Bavarian Government, per se, would only be an incidental defect. As it appears to Monsignor Hollweck, therefore, the practice in effect up to now can be maintained. If however the Concordat were subsequently directly or indirectly repudiated by a separation of Church and State, then common law would automatically come into effect, with the royal patronato having disappeared, there would be the right of free appointment by the Bishops under the norms of Canon 1432 § 1.\n\nThere is no doubt that the Bavarian Concordat (still according to the above-referenced teaching of the Most Eminent Cavagnis) in its entirety remains in effect even after the recent change in the form of the Government; but it appears that it would be licit to question whether the exception admitted expressly by Monsignor Hollweck for the right to appoint to vacant Bishop seats might be valid also for the presentation right to the parishes and non-consistorial benefices. In fact, privileges that run against Canon Law must be strictly construed, and therefore are to be considered rather as personal privileges than as privileges in re; this rule obviously applies above all to the right of appointment or presentation, which is odious, because it diminishes the liberty of the Church in conferring benefices (Canons 50, 68, 1471, De Luca, De Jurepatron, disc. II nn. 3-5, 12-13). Moreover the Republic arising upon the collapse of the Monarchy could not present to the Holy See those guarantees in view of which the indult of presentation was accorded to the King of Bavaria. And that is why the Most Eminent Cardinal Cavagnis teaches (I. c., II, nn. 129 et seq.): “…[extended Latin quotation].” Nor would it be, in itself, sufficient reason to lay claim to the Bavarian Government’s continuing up to now to pay to the parishes and to the other benefices the customary subsidy, since that is owed as a partial restitution of the goods usurped already from the Church. But it seems that, although the right of presentation should not pass automatically to the new Government, but should be requested as a new pontifical concession , this must not necessarily be explicit, however, it being sufficient for this purpose that it be an implicit or tacit recognition by the Holy See. Greater difficulties have arisen in the course of events.\n\nIn the first place, the Bishops are not in agreement about their conduct. It does not seem clear to them, truly, if the above-referenced response of the Holy See would or would not mean a tolerari potest; many, including the Archbishop of Munich, are not eager to present a list of three candidates, for fear that this would mean prejudicing Canon Law principles and the rights of the Holy See itself, and they have sought up to now to make do by means of parish administrators; others, instead, have either made such presentations already, such as (according to what Abp. Faulhaber has reported) the Bishop of Speyer, or are inclined to do so, especially after Monsignor Hollweck’s memorandum, like the Archbishop of Bamberg. This diversity of conduct, already harmful in itself, especially under current circumstances, creates toward the Prelates of the first category serious discontent from the Government as well as the clergy. In fact, discontent toward the Bishops is growing especially among the clergy, since not a few priests, failing to take account of the circumstances, are attributing to the respective Bishops the delay in appointments of parish pastors; and this discontent, of which there has even been some echo in the Socialist press, is all the more grave, in that the Government subsidy for parish administrators is much less than that for parish pastors, and thus very often, because of the continuing price inflation, insufficient to live on. Finally, it cannot be denied that the simple parish administrators do not enjoy the same authority as parish pastors, either in the view of the public authorities or in the view of the faithful, and that authority is so essential in these turbulent times. For all the above-mentioned reasons, it is not surprising if many Bishops desire that the Holy See would benevolently tolerate the exercise of the right of presentation by the current Republican Government, or at least, in order to achieve uniformity in the conduct of the Bishops, would deign to declare in more explicit language its mind in this regard, naturally only for the knowledge and guidance of the Bishops themselves, and without them bringing into the discussion or compromising in any way the Holy See vis-à-vis the Government.\n\nIn the often-mentioned response to Monsignor Auditor of this Nunciature, the Holy See says it is disposed to examine the needs of the new situation, once a Government, durably constituted, wants to negotiate with It. Therefore I consider it my duty to explain subordinately to Your Eminence my humble opinion about the adoption or not of these conditions at the current time.\n\nIt is essential to recognize, first of all, that from a legal perspective the present situation is better than the past. In fact, the Government of Kurt Eisner was not only merely provisional and de facto, but also illegitimate even from a democratic point of view, in that, as clearly shown by the elections, it was not representative of the Bavarian people, but only of a small revolutionary minority. It was primarily for this reason that I did not believe I could enter into relations with it and thus courteously declined the proposal of a meeting, which, moreover, would have caused sadness and scandal among Catholics, as I had the honor to report to Your Eminence in my Respectful Report No. 10941 dated November 20, 1918. By contrast, the current Ministry presided over by Mr. Hoffmann had the approbation of the Landtag, being the legal representative of the Bavarian people, even though the non-Socialist parties, especially the Bavarian People’s Party (Center Party), were induced rather begrudgingly and under the pressure of events (cf. Reports Nos 12334 and 12335 of March 18 and 19, 1919). Keeping in mind, moreover, that any attempt to restore the monarchy would have been, at least for now, certainly doomed to failure and would have done nothing but provoke civil war, it seems obligatory to conclude that the current Government can be considered as legitimate and thus one with which it is licit to enter into official relations.\n\nOn the other hand, however, it needs to be observed:\n\n1st) that the current Government can be called durable only in the sense that it is per se some type of legitimately constituted Ministry for so long as it remains in fact in power. But since in the current state of political and social ferment, especially in Bavaria, no one can with absolute certainty predict what will happen tomorrow, and moreover there is a universal conviction that the Hoffmann Cabinet (like in general the Majority Socialists to which he has belonged up to now) may lose ground one day and that the country is on the eve of a third revolution that will tend to establish a Councils Republic according to the Russian system.\n\n2nd) The Hoffmann Ministry, even if it is more moderate from a social policy perspective than the Independent Socialist Kurt Eisner, nonetheless, according to the unanimous information I am receiving, harbors a profound aversion to religion, so much that it can be said that its strongest struggle, in the issue of schooling, has been the supreme ideal of its life. For the moment it is abstaining, as it seems, from hostile acts, since it feels the ground shaking too much under its feet and because the Bavarian People’s Party (Center Party), in the negotiations that preceded the formation of the current Cabinet Ministry, made it a condition that the religious question be left untouched. From such a man it is difficult to expect that he will want to deal in a satisfactory way with the Holy See to resolve the ecclesiastical situation. I must add that I did not fail to make efforts prudently to enter into relations with him in an appropriate way, especially via the head of the Bavarian Center Party, Dr. Speck, an excellent Catholic; but up to now in vain. Also, according to what the Archbishop has reported to me, when an official of the Education Ministry suggested to Hoffmann that he open relations with the Nunciature or with the Holy See precisely to systematize the issue of the parish appointments, he responded that there was no need.\n\n3rd) Finally, there are many indications predicting that there will probably be a separation of Church and State in Germany, to which the Commission discussing the new Reich Constitution in Weimar is favorable (but in a non-hostile form). Separation, then, will take place with certainty, everyone believes, if Bolshevism prevails and the Councils Republic is established. In that case the issue of the right of presentation as to benefices by the governing authorities would fall away by itself.\n\nThat said, I leave it to Your Eminence’s superior judgment to decide whether it would be useful now to negotiate with the Bavarian Government to resolve the issue of the appointment of parish pastors, or whether it would be more expedient for now to await a solution of the current political and social crises, perhaps tolerating provisionally that the Bishops, to the extent they consider it necessary, would present the required three-candidate lists to the current Government, as was done in the past, without bringing the Holy See into the question or compromising it.\n\nTherefore, in expectation of the venerated instructions that Your Eminence may be pleased to communicate to me, possibly by telegraph, I humbly bow to kiss the Sacred Purple ...\n\nSource: Pacelli-Edition.de, Dokt No 252\n\nApr. 18, 1919 Pacelli to Gasparri, from Munich:\n\nRe: The Nunciature and the Soviets-Councils Republic of Bavaria\n\nMost Reverend Eminence:\n\nAs I had the honor to report to Your Most Reverend Eminence in my encrypted cable No. 319, at the beginning of this week two Foreign Legations in Munich were invaded by the red guard of the Councils Republic. Afterward, the automobile of the Prussian Legation came to be requisitioned, and the Consul General of Austria-Hungary was then arbitrarily arrested, and was not released until strong protests from the Austro-Hungarian Chargé d’Affaires.\n\nAs a result of such deplorable events, it was deemed opportune to call a meeting of the Diplomatic Corps to deliberate about them. After a long discussion, it was decided to speak about the matter directly with Levien, head of the Munich Councils Republic, to make him state unequivocally whether and how the current Communist Government intends to recognize and protect the immunities of the Diplomatic Representations. The negotiations were entrusted to the Nunciature and the Prussian Legation. Since it would have been absolutely indecorous for me to present myself to the aforesaid gentleman, the task was given to Monsignor Auditor, who went to him this morning together with the Prussian Chargé d’Affaires, Count von Zech, as the Ambassador was away from Munich in view of the current circumstances.\n\nLevien was installed along with his General Staff, or if you please, with the Council of Representatives of the people, in the former royal palace of the Wittelsbachs. The spectacle that said palace now presents is indescribable. The most chaotic confusion, the most nauseating filth, the continual coming and going of soldiers and armed workers, the shouting, the obscene language, the blasphemies that resound there, are turning what was the favorite residence of the King of Bavaria into a real hell-hole. An army of office workers who come and go, who transmit orders and pass along news, among them a crowd of young women, of a hardly reassuring appearance, Jews like the first ones, who are in all the offices, with provocative airs and equivocal smiles. The leader of this group of women there is Levien’s lover: a young Russian woman, Jewish, divorced, who gives orders like the mistress of the house. And to her the Nunciature unfortunately had to bow down to have a ticket for entry!\n\nLevien is a young man, also Russian and a Jew, of about thirty or thirty-five years. Pallid, dirty, with dull eyes, with a gruff, vulgar voice: a truly repulsive type, yet with an intelligent and sly face. He barely deigned to receive Monsignor Auditor in a corridor, surrounded by an armed security detail, among them an armed hunchback who is his faithful bodyguard. With a hat on his head and smoking, he listened to what Monsignor Schioppa expressed to him, protesting repeatedly and rudely that he was in a hurry for more urgent matters. In a contemptuous tone, he said the Councils Republic recognizes the extraterritoriality of the Foreign Legations, if and so long as the representatives of the Powers, friendly or hostile (it doesn’t matter to him), take no actions against the Councils Republic.\n\nWhen the Auditor made him consider that the position of the Pontifical Representative deserves special regard for his Mission, Levien stressed with a certain ironic tone: “Right, it’s about protecting the Center Party!” To which Monsignor Schioppa added energetically that it is about protecting the religious interests of Catholics, not only of Bavaria but of all Germany!\n\nAt the conclusion of the discussion he sent the Auditor to his comrade Dietrich, the People’s Representative for Foreign Affairs; there was another crowd of damsels, soldiers and workers; more disorderly conduct, more chaos. This improvisational Foreign Minister was a little less rude, but more sharp in his responses. Essentially he repeated what Levien had said, adding, in a way that admitted no discussion, that if the Nuncio did anything against the Councils Republic or the interests of the proletariat, he would be “thrown out” (weggeworfen), and he repeated the phrase, already spoken by Levien, that they had no need of the Nunciature, all the more since separation of State and Church would be coming. Monsignor Schioppa made them aware that, if the Republic were to hurt Catholic interests, the Nuncio would betray his Mission by remaining silent, but that naturally, otherwise, the Pontifical Representative would not get involved in political matters of the province. Dietrich insisted that extraterritoriality will be respected, so long as the security of the Councils Republic is not threatened. In any case documents are conceded to the Nunciature just as to the other Legations, in which the same extraterritoriality is recognized. It is clear that these documents only possess a rather relative value. Similar documents had already been issued to Diplomatic and Consular Representatives in Bavaria, and yet that did not prevent the invasion of the two Legations described above, nor the arrest of the Austrian Consul. The interpretation of these documents, given the complete anarchy that reigns, is left to the soldiers, who can go wherever they want with impunity and can do whatever best pleases them. There may be some soldiers who have the good sense and capacity to understand that extraterritoriality* is an important matter, but it is clear that the majority do not understand one iota, insisting on searching and arresting, and only after this is done is it possible to invoke the protection of the commissars of the people.\n\nThis is the unprecedented situation created for the Apostolic Nuncio, who then for possible further negotiations is obliged to submit to the indecorous humiliation of going back again to these Authorities in such offices.\n\nIn reporting the above to Your Eminence, as in duty bound, and in discharging my responsibilities, humbly bowing and kissing the Sacred Purple, and with sentiments of most profound veneration, I have the honor to remain,\n\nYour Most Reverend Eminence’s\n\nMost Humble, Most Devoted, Most Obliged Servant,\n\nEugenio, Archbishop of Sardis\n\nApostolic Nuncio\n\n*Note: Extraterritoriality of the Nunciature, under the circumstances, was confusing for international lawyers as well as Red Army soldiers: The Nunciature’s diplomatic immunity flowed from its status as an extraterritorial property of a sovereign nation. But the Pope’s temporal sovereignty over the Papal States had been lost during the period 1859-1870, and the Pope did not again rule a sovereign nation until Mussolini’s recognition of the Vatican City State in the Lateran Accords of 1929.\n\nSource: www.Pacelli-Edition.de, Document No. 257.\n\nApr. 19, 1919 Senger to the Catholic Parishes of Bavaria:\n\nOur beloved Fatherland is in greatest danger.

After having intimidated, with the threat to explode the selfsame grenades, the servant of the Nunciature who had opened the door to them, they entered by force, stating that they wanted to seize the Nunciature’s automobile (a splendid car with the pontifical coat of arms), and demanded to speak immediately with the Nuncio. Monsignor Auditor being away from the house at that moment, I presented myself to these raving men and made known to the Commander that the violent penetration into the Nunciature and the requisitioning of the automobile by force of arms constituted two flagrant violations of international law binding on all civilized peoples, and I further showed him the certificate of extraterritoriality issued by the People’s Commission for Foreign Affairs, of which I had the honor to report to Your Most Reverend Eminence in my respectful Report No. 12572. For his entire response the adjutant aimed the revolver at my chest, and the Commander – a horrible delinquent type – after having given his underlings the order to hold hand grenades at the ready, told me insolently that any talk was useless and that he had to have the automobile immediately to proceed to the front. I replied with vigor that I was protesting against the aggression, but that, in the face of brutal violence, I was permitting the aforesaid servant to open the garage.\n\nSeyler then proceeded there, and, thanks to the help of a chauffeur who came with him, tried to put the automobile in motion; an arduous task, since the Nunciature’s chauffeur, in anticipation of the event, had removed from the machine an essential piece for its functioning. While these delinquents, infuriated by encountering the obstacle, were intent on their work, I had a telephone call made to the competent Ministry of Military Affairs. The response, however, was hardly encouraging: If the automobile was not immediately handed over, the Nunciature would be bombarded and the whole band (sic, in original), that is the personnel of the selfsame Nunciature, would be arrested. This attempt having failed, and despite the difficulty deriving from the fact that an armed sentinel was watching over the telephone, I succeeded in having Monsignor Schioppa alerted, in order to try a step with the Commander of the City. He indeed, engaged immediately by Monsignor Schioppa, understood the situation; and towards five, that is two whole hours after the Nunciature had been invaded, three security agents arrived and ordered the Commander of the Red Guard to desist from his enterprise. Given, however, that he, as a member of the Supreme Command, maintained that he did not have to submit to orders from the Commander of the City, there arose between the two parties a loud argument, until, as it pleased God, at 6 o’clock, as a result of new instructions from other Authorities, Seyler undertook to go away, leaving the automobile. Thus quiet returned to the Nunciature, but only for a short time.\n\nThis morning I was in Prof. Jochner’s Clinic, where, having recently had a strong attack of influenza and a sick stomach, I am undergoing a special treatment. Monsignor Schioppa was in the Nunciature. Toward 9:00, the same two individuals reappeared, that is the Commander of the Red Army of the South and his adjutant, accompanied by other armed soldiers and equipped with a document signed by Egelhofer, Supreme Commander of the Red Army, which authorized them to requisition the Nunciature’s automobile.\n\nImmediately the Executive Committee, as well as the Commander of the City, were alerted by telephone. Indeed there arrived at the Nunciature, with all speed in two automobiles, a member of the aforesaid Committee with armed soldiers, and in another automobile, about ten soldiers of the City Command’s police. An agitated discussion arose about the jurisdiction of the powers, and the matter threatened to go on for an eternity and perhaps end badly; when it was proposed that the two who came for the requisitioning go together with the member of the Executive Committee to Egelhofer. After more than a short wait, they returned in an automobile, this furnished with a machinegun and a not inconsiderable number of soldiers with rifles and hand grenades. The member of the Executive Committee then told Monsignor Auditor that this Committee could not do anything at all to avert the seizure of the automobile, as it concerned a matter of a military character. The soldiers from the City Command made the same statement, adding that they could well have undertaken a struggle by armed force against those of the Red Army, but that it was more humane to spare the shedding of blood.\n\nMonsignor Schioppa protested with the greatest vigor against the act of violence that they wanted to commit, making it known, among other things, that even in Russia and Hungary the prerogatives of the Diplomatic Corps were respected and that it is impossible to understand how members of the Executive Committee and soldiers of the Councils Republic would not respect the decisions and signatures of their Ministers, who had recognized the extraterritoriality of the Nunciature. At this point, the Commander of the Red Army of the South, with an imperious and arrogant tone, turned to Monsignor Auditor and said to him: “Not one word more; otherwise you will be arrested at this very moment!” At this threat he needed to yield, but not before Monsignor Schioppa had first made clearly known that the yielding was only in the face of violence and that the Executive Committee would be responsible for the consequences of this act of violation of international law.\n\nWhile they were proceeding to take away the automobile, however, the Italian Army Captain, Signor De Luca, detached to Munich by the Military Mission in Berlin, and an excellent Gentleman, having learned what was happening, went to the Supreme Command of the Red Army, and (of his own initiative, indeed unknown to the Nunciature) demanded the release of the automobile in the name of the Italian Government, protesting against what had occurred. The step had a happy result, as Egelhofer gave an order to the aforesaid Captain for the immediate release of the car, which has already been taken to the Benz Company garage for appropriate repairs. There Egelhofer’s order was shown, before which the two who came for the requisitioning had to yield, not without first bringing menacing words of rancor to their lips, among them that the whole band (the Nunciature) should be thrown into prison!\n\nIndeed the Italian attaché at the Swiss Consulate (who was in charge of the protection of Italians during the war), having become aware of the matter, went to the Executive Committee and had from them a letter of apology for what had happened to the Nunciature, and the assurance that the deplorable event would not be repeated, as well as confirmation of what the Commander in charge of the Red Army had already said to Captain De Luca.\n\nThus the automobile could be returned to the Nunciature with rubber tires that had also been required: but there remains the act of violence against the Pontifical Representative, the violation of the right of extraterritoriality and the threats of abuse against the Nunciature, which, given the state of exceptional excitement that reigns here and the double game played by the Commander of the Red Army of the South and his worthy adjutant, there could be attempts, and therefore I as well as Monsignor Auditor have been advised to sleep away from the house for several nights, naturally leaving the palace of the Nunciature well watched after.\n\nAn event developed into an echo of cannons, which reverberated yesterday almost uninterruptedly in Munich, in the fratricidal fighting between the Red Army of the Councils Republic and the White Army fighting for the liberation of the Capital of Bavaria from the harshest Russian-Jewish-revolutionary tyranny.\n\nHumbly bowing to kiss the Sacred Purple ...\n\nSource: www.Pacelli-Edition.de, Document No. 258.\n\nMay 1, 1919 Historisch-politische Blätter für das katholische Deutschland, vol. 163:9 (1919), p. 559:\n\n“Lenin” by Fritz Zinnecke\n\nA young Russian from Vladimir University in Kiev, Bolshevik to the core, once said to me: “Humanity today really has only three great men: Wilson, Lenin and Benedict XV.” If one considers the composition of our government and the peace delegation that is supposed to encompass the flower of our nation, or the Entente’s men of state gathered in Paris, who really want to found a new epoch, then those words take on special meaning. When a Bolshevik, despite the contrast with the worldview of Benedict XV, actually calls him a great man, then a Catholic may certainly consider the personality of Lenin, who is light-years away from himself in more than just religious things, and try to do him justice.\n\nMore than once I have spoken, during my stay in the Ukraine, with Russians who knew Lenin personally, who had either worked under him politically or struggled against him. Therein, however, friend and foe were agreed: Lenin is an idealist. His ideal is the realization of Communism...\n\nAlong the path of development, Lenin’s extreme goal of the realization of Communism is not attainable, it requires first the violent overthrow of the capitalistic order of society in all civilized countries. His next and most intensive effort goes on from there to the revolutionizing of the world...\n\nThe German Revolution itself was given birth by the World War. Soviet Russia, however, came about unnaturally. Rakowski in Kiev, Joffe in Berlin and Radek in Moscow acted and wrote in agreement with and by assignment of Lenin...\n\nThe propagating and organizing of world revolution is only one of the fields that Lenin works; a second, and not less extensive is the domestic Russian, on which he acts to give humanity an example of the nature of a Communist State...\n\n... this sentence from Lenin himself: “Among one hundred Bolsheviks there is one idealist, ninety-nine criminals, and seventy dumbheads.” These unworldly ideologues and injudicious common blokes represent the leaders and the followers, “upon whom,” as Gerlich says so trenchantly in the Süddeutsche Monatshefte, “the Christian character of Marxism impresses its power of attraction, and whom it seizes with the convincing power of a religious mania.” The prophet of this new faith is Lenin...\n\nInspired by his prophetic aspect, Lenin has pursued a systematic politics of destruction for the attainment of his utopian goals, leading to the ruin of Russia, the driving of Germany to the brink of the abyss, and the threatening of the existence of the democracies of the West...\n\nMay 1, 1919 Historisch-politische Blätter für das katholische Deutschland, vol. 163:9 (1919), p. 565:\n\n“Bolshevism in Hungary” – Apr. 10\n\nThe Bolsheviks of Russia are schooling them. Since the 21st of March, Hungary has a Bolshevik government. It is as if Bolshevism wanted to advance from East to West…\n\nBut how exactly did Hungary come to its present-day Bolshevism? Precisely by departing from its established political foundation. Just as Russia, which simply overthrew Czarism, instead of timely reforming it, lost all political restraint and then sought in vain for a firm bit of ground, so Hungary’s Prime Minister Wekerle, as he declared the royal association of Hungary dissolved, along with the other lands of the Hapsburg monarchy, lost the political foundation of Hungary without offering any other foundation in its place...\n\n[p.569] ... the Communist government in Budapest, among whose 30 members, it is maintained, no fewer than 24 are Jews. Is this now really the end of Hungary? ...\n\nThe final result remains always this: Paris is today the head of the capitalist- and Moscow likewise the head of the anticapitalist- world order. Paris stands for the preservation of the existing economic order, having thus to some extent the power of Positivism behind it, Moscow on the other hand wants to destroy the existing order, without however having any clarity about the new order, thus in Moscow pure negation prevails...\n\nMay 3, 1919 Bayerischer Kurier, page one:\n\n“To the Residents of Munich!”\n\nFollowing the clarification of how the Räterepublik in Munich meant the rape of true democracy, the political parties are standing unshakably behind the Government that was lawfully elected by the Landtag.

The first concern will be to improve again the provision of food for the population of Munich and to create for all elements of the people, living conditions that are fit for human beings. The punishment of the guilt-laden demogogues and seducers of the people must be carried out relentlessly and unyieldingly with the full weight of the law. It is a ghastly crime to shake so severely the entire State at a time of the Fatherland’s deepest need and to delay and immeasurably impede the rebuilding of our economy...\n\nThe bleeding wounds must be healed by wise, statesmanlike work.
