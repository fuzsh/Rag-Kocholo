        "text": "The Apostolic Constitution Anglicanorum Coetibus established a definitive means for the reconciliation of groups of Anglicans with the Catholic Church. The provision of personal ordinariates offers a place for the distinctive liturgical, spiritual, and pastoral traditions of Anglicanism. As the apostolic constitution declares, this is not just of benefit to the members of the ordinariates, but is \"a treasure to be shared.\" In this article I demonstrate the intrinsic connection between what a personal ordinariate is (its juridical identity) and the way it worships (its liturgical identity), showing how the distinctive liturgical life of the ordinariates is a condition of and justification for the distinct canonical arrangements, and furthermore how the specific form of personal ordinariates is especially suited to this task.\n\nThe personal ordinariates erected under the auspices of the 2009 apostolic constitution Anglicanorum coetibus are often seen as a particular project of Pope Benedict XVI. Whilst the apostolic constitution itself, and the erection of the three extant ordinariates, occurred during his pontificate, a great deal of their early life has in fact taken place in the pontificate of Pope Francis. This article first addresses the ways in which perceived and actual priorities of Pope Francis find a particular articulation in the developing structures, mission, and life of the personal ordinariates. It considers the means by which Pope Francis has, directly or indirectly, shaped the personal ordinariates in their composition, internal governance, and liturgy. Secondly, it examines how certain elements of the Anglican patrimony and the experiences of the clergy and lay faithful of the personal ordinariates emphasize in a particular way certain themes of the pontificate of Pope Francis: namely, missionary discipleship, poverty, and accompaniment.\n\nThe apostolic constitution Anglicanorum Cœtibus is a response to petitions from groups of Anglicans to be received into communion with the Holy See in a corporate manner. This dissertation examines the origin of such petitions, the development of the principles guiding the response, and an analysis of the legislation. Chapter One traces the origins of corporate reunion from Newman to the Second Vatican Ecumenical Council, in particular the Association for Promoting the Unity of Christendom and the Malines Conversations. Chapter Two discusses the Second Vatican Ecumenical Council with respect to ecumenism and Anglicanism. It examines the establishment of relations between Anglicans and the Holy See, the Anglican-Roman Catholic International Commission (ARCIC), and proposals for the corporate reunion of Anglicans in the Diocese of Amritsar, the United States, the Diocese of Matabeleland, and the United Kingdom. Chapter Three considers the overtures made by groups of Anglicans from 2005 to 2009. This includes the Anglican Church in North America (ACNA), Church of England bishops, and the Traditional Anglican Communion. It details the announcement, reception, and implementation of Anglicanorum coetibus . Chapter Four examines proposals for the corporate reunion of Anglicans including the Church sui iuris, the personal prelature, and the personal apostolic administration. The notion of ordinariates is discussed with respect to the Latin ordinariates for Eastern faithful and military ordinariates. Chapter Five considers the implementation of the provision of Anglicanorum cœtibus, in particular the transmission of the Anglican patrimony through personal parishes, the liturgical provision, the formation of clergy, and ecumenical dialogue. The General Conclusion proposes two further developments: the extension of the objective criteria for eligibility for membership of a personal ordinariate, and the eventual erection of personal dioceses. Extensive appendices contain documentation pertaining to the development of the canonical model for the corporate reunion of Anglicans with the Catholic Church.\n\nThe Ordinariate in England is examined as an instance of and contribution to the ecumenical movement, in terms of the process of receptive ecumenical learning - from initiating, through local to formal reception - as understood through the history and development of ARCIC, as well as a Catholic Anglican proposal for a corporate reunion in the 1980s, the Congregation of the English Mission. Also reviewed is what constitutes Anglican Patrimony, from ecclesiological and constitutional forms, to liturgical texts and traditions of moral theology, homiletics and theological dialogue. Finally, the potential of the Ordinariate as a point of engagement with Anglicanism, having been formed within and partly determined its internal ecumenism and dialogue, is considered as a means to assist Catholic understanding of Anglican tradition and thus Anglican-Roman Catholic mutual dialogue; as a sign of the Catholic Church's desire to recognise the dimension of Anglican life and religion within its account of itself as manifesting the Universal Church, and to give space to form of it; and as adding a distinctive 'dialect' of its own in the task of the new evangelisation of English society, culture and people.\n\nIn 2011, a new English translation of the Roman Missal was promulgated. Many have complained that this translation is not suitable for liturgical use, as churchgoers find it very hard to understand. Given that the Congregation for Divine Worship has recently approved a second translation of some of the prayers of the missal into a Tudor style of English for the liturgy of the Personal Ordinariates formed to give pastoral care to former Anglicans and Episcopalians, it is clear that the ideal of a single liturgical translation per language per region can be relaxed for pastoral needs. This article proposes that a similar pastoral solicitude be shown to those who would benefit from the celebration of the Eucharist in a vernacular style closer to everyday English and that the 1998 Sacramentary translation be re-examined for possible liturgical use alongside the 2011 Roman Missal.\n\nThe article describes the Ordinariates for Anglicans from the ecclesiological point of view. The publication of Pope Benedict XVI’s Apostolic Constitution Anglicanorum coetibus created a new situation in the interconfessional relations and in the search for the unity of the Church. Firstly the Author explains what are the Ordinariates for Anglicans and what solutions contains the Apostolic Constitution Anglicanorum coetibus. In the second point of the article we find an analysis of an ecclesiological model created by the constitution Anglicanorum coetibus. While not being the return to the past method of gaining the unity of the Church by partial unions (i.e. so called “uniatism” or “unionism”) the Ordinariates offer to the conversing Anglicans the possibility of upkeeping their liturgical tradition. The Ordinariates also enjoy a large scale of independence in the frame of the Catholic Church. Alongside the bright spells there are also some shadows. The Author points at the major ec...\n\nOn 22 October 2021 the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments (CDWDS) issued the document Postquam Summus Pontifex (PSP). The document was made available together with a commentary by Archbishop Arthur Roche. PSP should be principally read as an accompaniment to the 2017 motu proprio Magnum Principium by which §§2-3 of canon 838 of the 1983 Code of Canon Law were modified. In this brief article we will detail the contents of PSP and identify some areas that, from an initial overview, suggest avenues for further study."
