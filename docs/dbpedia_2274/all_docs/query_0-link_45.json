        "text": "In the era prior to the Great Schism of 1054, Christianity was one Church composed of two culturally distinct elements: the Greek East and Latin West. The Greek and Latin halves of the Church each possessed their own independent liturgical and cultural customs which were part of the dispute that lead to the Great Schism, effectively separating the Church into independent Greek and Latin sides. While the West had retained liturgical expressions that differed from the majority Western Rite (in the form of the Italo-Albanian Catholic Church, which remained in communion with Rome after the official break with Constantinople), the Christian East was exclusively composed of Churches celebrating the Byzantine Rite for approximately nine hundred years. This changed in the latter half of the nineteenth century with the conversion of Julius Joseph Overbeck to the Russian Orthodox Church in London. Since that time, there have been attempts and successes in establishing a Western Rite in the Eastern Church. This thesis approaches Western Rite Orthodoxy as an established phenomenon in Eastern Christianity, especially as a facet of Orthodoxy in countries where Orthodoxy constitutes a minority. While previous short studies have attempted to substantiate or discredit the legitimacy of Western Rite Orthodoxy as a movement, this thesis accepts the reality of the Western rite and seeks to understand Western Rite Orthodoxy by documenting its history thoroughly, the investigating peculiarities of the Orthodox Western rite compared to other Western liturgies, exposing potential problems (spiritual and canonical) of the current rite and devotions when compared to accepted Orthodox theology and spirituality, and by evaluating some of the criticisms which are often employed against Western Rite Orthodoxy. To complete this critical evaluation, there are some important areas of consideration. Though there have been some studies of Western Rite Orthodoxy, there has been little historical documentation of the movement since the middle part of the twentieth century. Part of Western Rite Orthodoxy’s development has been the alteration of liturgical texts to bring them into conformity with the theology and spirituality of the Eastern Church. There is some question, both in academic and ecclesiastical circles, about how thoroughly these changes were implemented, whether there are still elements requiring further correction, and even if the Western liturgies can be brought into conformity with Eastern theology and practice in any instance. Furthermore, there is are ecumenical implications to the presence of Western Rite Orthodoxy that have yet to be addressed, particularly in the Western Rite Orthodox rejection of post-Vatican II liturgies used by the majority of Western Christianity, and the effect this might have on a future reunion between a Western Church and Orthodoxy. With this critical framework established, there is a greater opportunity to fully understand Western Rite Orthodoxy in the twentieth century, both as it affects the Orthodox Church itself and as it affects external relationships between the Orthodox and other Christian churches. Secondarily, the thesis provides a more complete history in terms of documentation and contextualization of Western Rite Orthodoxy than is presently available through any other medium.\n\nThis thesis explores one aspect of the ongoing validity of orders debate within the Anglican Communion. It asks why the Communion – or elements within the Communion – continues to regard the recognition of its Holy Orders by other Churches, and especially by the Roman Catholic Church, as important. The juridical category of validity is distinct from the ecclesial category of recognition, but only valid Holy Orders may be recognised, and the official Anglican position was that the nature of Holy Orders after the Reformation was unchanged from the catholic standard and therefore should be recognised by other elements of the universal church. The understanding of ordination and the nature of Holy Orders differed somewhat between the Anglican Communion and the other major historical sections of the universal church – especially the Roman Catholic Church and the Orthodox Churches – despite a degree of continuity and consistency. It may even have differed within the Communion. But the formularies of the Anglican Church (and now the broader Anglican Communion) have long suggested that its Holy Orders are equally valid as those of these other parts of the universal church, regardless of whether they are recognised externally. The internal normative validity of Holy Orders could not be readily impugned in a Church which maintains episcopal ordination. But the question of the external recognition of this validity – and the definition of validity in this context – turned upon the emphasis one placed upon the importance of the Communion’s claim to catholicity, as part of the “One Holy Catholic and Apostolic Church”. The continued emphasis upon the universality of Holy Orders is the case study through which the wider catholicity of the Anglican Communion is explored. The Reformation was a challenge to the universality of Holy Orders, but no clearly dissimilar (or indeed identifiable) Anglican theology of Holy Orders developed out of that period. The loss of recognition by Rome following the Reformation did not necessarily mean that Holy Orders were no longer valid. But the quest for recognition of Holy Orders by other parts of the universal church remained important because of the legal continuity which was asserted, and which, to some degree at least, was preserved. In the late nineteenth century the validity of Anglican Holy Orders was definitively rejected by the Roman Catholic Church, largely on the grounds of the perceived loss of continuity of apostolic succession. This was despite protestations (especially by adherents of the Tractarian movement, but also by other elements in the wider Anglican Church) that Anglican Holy Orders were indeed valid catholic Holy Orders, and ought to be recognised as such. The Holy See could not, however, accord recognition to the Holy Orders of what it saw as a schismatic Church, or ecclesial community. But it was arguably in the twentieth century – a time of widespread reconsideration of the nature and meaning of the universal ministry of the church – that the real differences between Anglican and Roman Catholic theology of Holy Orders emerged. As at the time of the Reformation differences were based on distinct understanding of catholicity and ecclesial authority as much as differences over the nature of Holy Orders. In the twentieth century the validity question was influenced less by legalism and a sense of continuity than by œcumenism (what might be called an external justification). Ultimately this distinction makes it increasingly difficult to see the Anglican Church as catholic with respect to Holy Orders, at least as these were formerly understood. By this time the test of validity is not so much the nature of Holy Orders per se, but rather the more practical questions œcumenism raised, and especially in later years, the question of authority within Anglicanism. The validity of Anglican Holy Orders remains important to both the evangelical and the Anglo-Catholic within the Anglican Communion, but for different reasons, because of their differing understandings of the ministry of the universal church. With changing notions of Holy Orders, sacraments, and the nature of the universal church, the Holy Orders debate is still far from resolved. But perhaps the question has moved on from being a simple historical evaluation of technical continuity, intention and form, to a more difficult, but possibly ultimately more rewarding, question of the nature of the universal church. In particular, the acceptance of a common Anglican position on Holy Orders would be an important move towards a common understanding of the nature of the universal church, at a time when this is a key question facing Christianity."
