        "text": "Today the Catholic Church in India is composed of Christians belonging to three sui iuris Churches: Syro-Malabar Church, Syro-Malankara Church, and Latin Church. In this seminar paper, we are concerned with the Syro-Malabar Church. Through this scientific work, we wish to make a historico-juridical appraisal of the hierarchical authority in the Indian Church. This study focuses on the constitution of the Syro-Malabar hierarchy. The whole paper is divided into five sections. In the first section, which is entitled ‘Apostolic period’, we study the apostolic origin of the Indian Church. The second section deals with the ‘East Syrian Period’. In this period, we could see a deep-rooted relationship between the sister Churches of Persian Empire and India. In the third section ‘Papal Primacy and the Indian Church’, we study the St Thomas Christians’ understanding of the doctrine of papal primacy. The fourth section introduces the ‘Latin period’ which had begun with the arrival of the Portuguese. During this period St Thomas Christians were under the jurisdiction of Padroado and Propaganda. In the fifth section ‘the Syro-Malabar period’ we notice the erection of vicariates and appointment of native bishops and the gradual development of the Syro-Malabar Hierarchy. In this period, we could see the re-birth of St Thomas Christians under the new tile ‘Syro-Malabar Major Archiepiscopal Church’.\n\nThis book contains the specific teaching of Pope John Paul II concerning the Indian Church from the time of his election to the apostolic see of St Peter until the publication of this book in 1996 (the Pope died only in 2005). My introductory article, “The Catholic Church in India” is omitted, because my scholarly work with the same title is now available on this site. The first two parts of this book present the discourses of Pope John Paul II to the bishops of the Syro-Malabar and Syro-Malankara bishops, as well as to the bishops of the Latin Church on the occasion of their ad limina visits. The third part is dedicated to the important discourses of the Holy Father during his pastoral visit to India in February 1986. The fourth and fifth sections provide some important letters, constitutions and decrees of the Pope concerning the Indian Church.\n\nMar Aprem, Metropolitan of India, represents the Church of the East, the historical center of which, Seleucia-Ctesiphon and later Baghdad, is in Mesopotamia. Suffering heavily today from the war in Iraq, the Church has had a glorious history, having been widely spread all over the East. During its history, the Church of the East was often persecuted, and hosts of martyrs, together with other saints of this Church, became its glorious heavenly counterpart. The history of the Church of the East in India was also complicated and full of difficulties. It is noteworthy that Dr. Mar Aprem represents that part of Indian Christianity which keeps to the faith and traditions ofthe earliest stage of the history of Indian Christianity. Hence we see a special attention being paid by the author to that period when the Christian tradition in India had not yet experienced any significant dogmatic or cultural shifts and divisions. ...\n\nThe article first presents a brief historical overview of the complex Indian cultural roots by highlighting the stages of growth of the Indian legal culture and Indian ecclesial presence and then moves on to present the contemporary challenges that this has provoked within the civil society and the Indian Church. The second part also discusses some ecclesial challenges like adapting ecclesiastical laws for the Churches in India, relationship between the sui iuris Churches, commitment towards equality in the Church, and need for inculturation and inter-religious and ecumenical dialogue in India today.\n\nThis book pivots on three main themes: inculturation, liturgical reform and the direction of the celebrant during the Holy Mass, although it touches also some other aspects of the liturgical heritage of the Syro-Malabar Church. Really these two questions have been the root causes of disputes, indiscipline and anarchy among some sections of the clergy and the Christian faithful, which have tormented this Church for more than five decades. The present work not only traces the origin and historical evolution of the said problems, but also highlights the advancement of the restoration and reform of liturgy, distinguishing shadows from realities and striving to enucleate some guidelines and orientational paradigms for future action. [The statements concerning the liturgy facing the people in the Latin Church may simply be considered as the observations of an Eastern outsider]."
