        "text": "After a rather long hiatus, I am continuing my series of Iconic Icons . Since Advent (and thus a new Liturgical Year) began today, and since this season prepares us to celebrate the Incarnation of Christ (among other things), and since the Incarnation is the doctrinal basis of iconography, I decided it is an appropriate time to revive my series. Following the post on the Pantocrator, a post on a popular icon of Christ, I decided to write a post on the second most important and popular category of icons: the icons of the Theotokos (θεοτοκος).\n\nTheotokos is a title for Mary, the Blessed Virgin, Mother of Our Lord Jesus Christ. The word literally means \"God-Bearer,\" but it describes the dogma that Mary is \"Mother of God.\" This dogma (I believe it is a dogma, though I am not absolutely certain of the difference between doctrine and dogma, though I am studying Catechetics) was proclaimed at the Council of Ephesus in 431 in response to the Nestorian heresy, which sought to separate the human and divine natures of Christ. One way of doing this was by declaring Mary \"Christotokos\" (Χριστοτοκος), \"Christ-Bearer,\" which doctrinally implied that Mary was only mother of Christ in His human nature. The Council of Ephesus, in declaring that Jesus Christ was one divine person in two natures, human and divine, also declared that Mary could and should be referred to with the title of Theotokos rather than Christotokos. (One story of this Council, which showed how fervent Marian devotion was even in the early Church, states that after the Council declared that Mary was Theotokos, the faithful walked through the streets, shouting, \"Theotokos! Theotokos!\")\n\nThus, Theotokos is a title for Mary meaning \"Mother of God.\" The Greek term is used frequently in the Eastern Church to refer to Mary, while in the Western Church the translation (in whatever language) is usually more common. The word is also used to describe icons representing the Blessed Mother. Unlike the Pantocrator, which is merely one type of icon of Christ (although a very common type), Theotokos refers to many different types of icons of Mary. Most icons of Mary show her with the Christ Child, though occasionally she is shown alone. Among the many icons of Mary (many with distinct names based on their history, and many with miracles attached to them), there are roughly five categories they can be grouped into:\n\nHodigitria (Οδηγητρια), the Guide: Mary is holding the Christ Child and is pointing toward Him, He Who is the source of salvation, and thus Mary is acting as a Guide leading us to our salvation.\n\nEleusa (Ελευσα), Tender Mercy: Mary is holding the Christ Child, and He touches His face to hers while wrapping at least one arm around her neck and shoulder. It is often used to represent the relationship between God (Christ) and the Church (Mary).\n\nPanakranta (Πανακραντα), All Merciful: Mary is enthroned with the Christ Child on her lap; both are facing the viewer. This symbolizes Mary's royal glory, and it shows her part in our salvation (in a way, it reflects the doctrine of Mary as Co-Redemptrix and Mediatrix of All Graces).\n\nAgiosortissa (Αγιοσορτισσα), Intercessor: Mary is shown alone, in profile, holding out her hands in prayer and supplication for us. She is facing to her left, where there is usually placed a separate icon of Christ.\n\nOranta (Οραντα), Praying (also Panagia (Παναγια), Lady of the Sign): Mary is showing facing the viewer with her arms raised in the \"orante\" position (the same position the priest uses often throughout the Mass when praying, during the Collect, for instance), while the Christ Child is shown enclosed in her womb.\n\nMuch could be said about each of these icons in general: I hope to feature multiple Marian icons in the future, and I will hopefully be able to delve into the details of different types as I do that (at the very least, I will discuss the icon of Our Lady of Czestochowa, which is a Hodigitria icon). There are a few overall themes to mention. One is that Mary is often shown to the left of Christ, that is, on His right hand. This shows how she receives hyperdulia, that is, veneration higher than all of the other saints. [This is my interpretation of this position: it is by no means the only position shown in icons, and I do not know if others hold this position or not. Feel free to disbelieve this opinion if you so wish. The other two themes are standard in iconography, as far as I know.] Another is that in icons Mary is always wearing a veil, which usually includes three stars, one on the head and one on each shoulder: these represent the Three Persons of the Holy Trinity (sometimes, one star is covered by the Christ Child, since He is the Second Person of the Trinity). Finally, Mary is usually robed in blue in icons, since blue is the color of humanity; sometimes, she is wearing blue with red over it, signifying her deification by Christ (the deification that all men are called to partake of), since red is the color of divinity. (The symbolism of these colors is why icons of Christ often portray Him wearing red covered with blue, signifying the assumption of human nature by He Who is a Divine Person.)\n\nThere is much more I could say about icons of the Theotokos, but this is a primer on them. I hope that I will continue this series of posts with more frequency than I have done in the past. Until then, I hope you found this post helpful. God Bless.\n\nAll-holy, immaculate, most blessed and glorified Lady, the Theotokos and Ever-Virgin Mary, pray for us!\n\nNota Bene: I obtained the majority of the information for this post from Orthodox wiki, specifically the page on Icons of the Theotokos. The ending title of Mary was taken from its page on Theotokos. I apologize if any of the Greek is incorrectly transliterated in this post.\n\nText ©2011 Brandon P. Otto. Licensed via CC BY-NC. Feel free to redistribute non-commercially, as long as credit is given to the author.\n\nIn researching for my recently begun project, The Church Documents Index, I came across The Franciscan Archive, which includes links to a great many papal bulls and other documents regarding the Franciscan Orders. While are large number of these are translated into English or linked to English translations, not all of them are: some are only in Latin, or Spanish, or other languages. Though I do not know Latin, I do know Spanish, so I decided to translate some of these bulls into English in order for those studying the history of Franciscanism to have this resource available. To start with, here are the Bulls Cum Dilecti, Pio Dilectis, and Cum Secundum of Pope Honorius III translated into English: these are some of the earliest papal documents written regarding Franciscanism (they were all written while St. Francis was still alive). Even though these translations will not be perfect (they're translations of translations, after all), I hope they are helpful to you.\n\nPope Honorius III\n\nBull Cum Dilecti\n\n6/11/1218\n\nA Letter of Pope Honorius III to the Bishops of the World, recommending St. Francis and the Brothers of Penance\n\nBishop Honorius, servant of the servants of God, to the venerable brother archbishops and bishops and to the beloved sons, abbots, deans, archdeacons, and the other prelates of the Church, health and apostolic blessing.\n\nSince the beloved sons, Brother Francis and his companions, members of the life and religion of the Friars Minor, after having abandoned the vanities of the world, have chosen a path of life meritoriously approbated by the Roman Church, and have expanded to the many parts of the world, following the example of the apostles, sowing the seed of the Divine Word; through these apostolic letters we communicate to them our request and exhortation.\n\nNamely, when the carriers of these present letters, those of the community of the said brothers, consider that they ought to go to where you are, accept them as catholic and faithful men and in every moment show yourselves favorable and benign with them, for reverence of the Lord and Us.\n\nGiven in the Lateran, the 11th day of June of 1218, in the second year of Our Pontificate.\n\nPope Honorius III\n\nBull Pio Dilectis\n\n5/29/1220\n\nThe Letter of Pope Honorius III to the Bishops and Nobles of France, recommending Order of Friars Minor\n\nBishop Honorius, servant of the servants of God, to the venerable archbishops and bishops, and to the beloved sons, abbots, priors, and the other prelates to the churches, constituted in the Kingdom of France, health and apostolic blessing.\n\nWe remember having sent you Our letters in favor of the beloved sons, the brothers of the Order of Friars Minor, to the end that you consider them as recommended, in the light of Divine Love.\n\nBut, as has been related to Us, some of you, as if you had a doubtful conscience with respect to the Order, not finding, however, in them reason for suspicion, as We have heard from others to whom We can give full faith, do not permit them to remain in your dioceses, although, being the only deed for which We had sent you Our letters, it should not be thought as nothing inconvenient with respect to them.\n\nFor such a motive We want all of you to be notified that we consider their Order among the approbated and We admit the brothers of that Order as Catholics and supporters [of the Roman Church].\n\nConsequently, We have considered reprimanding and exhorting you by sending you notification through apostolic letters, by which We order: namely, that you admit them in your dioceses as men truly faithful and religious, and that you take them as recommended very particularly, for reverence of the Lord and Us.\n\nGiven in Viterbo, the 29th of May of 1220, the fourth year of Our Pontificate.\n\nPope Honorius III\n\nBull Cum Secundum\n\n9/22/1220\n\nThe Bull of Pope Honorius III to the Priors and Custodes of the OFM, establishing the requirement of the observance of the Novitiate\n\nHonorius, bishop, servant of the servants of God, to the beloved sons Priors and custodians of the Friars Minor, health and apostolic blessing.\n\n1. Following the advice of the Wise One, nothing should be done without reflection (cf. Prov 13:16), to the end that nothing would took place after which we ought to repent. From there it is opportune for anyone that has the intention of effecting a proposition for a more perfect life, that his eyes precede his steps, that is to say that he measure his own strengths with the criterion of prudence, in order that it does not happen, God not permit it, that wanting higher things, his path turns unsteady (Ps 65:9) and returns to look back, destined to be transformed into an insipid statue of salt (Gen 19:26), because it is not the capacity to season the sacrifice of the same, that he wished to offer to God, with the salt of wisdom. In effect, as the wise man arrived at being insipid if he did not have fervor, in the same way, he who is fervent is covers himself in confusion if he does not have flavor.\n\n2. For this reason, in almost all the forms of religious life it is prudently established that as many as have the intention of embracing the regular observances, would try them out for some time before and be tested in them, so that afterwards they do not have motives for remorse, so that it would not be possible to excuse them from the accusation of laziness.\n\n3. Consequently, with the authority of the present letters We prohibit you to permit anyone to the profession of your Order, if before he has not had a year of probation. And once his profession is made, no brother should dare to leave your Order, and no one is licit in accepting those that have left the Order.\n\nWe prohibit also that any of you be able to leave the obedience of the habit of your religion and corrupt the pureness of poverty. If one of you, then, presumes to do this, it is licit to you to impose on such brothers ecclesiastical censures until they have repented.\n\nTo no one is it licit, as such, to violate in any form this writing of our prohibition and concession, or to go recklessly against it. If, then, any one has the presumption to do this, know that he will incur the indignation of God Almighty and the holy apostles Peter and Paul.\n\nGiven in Viterbo, the 22nd of September of 1220, in the fifth year of Our Pontificate.\n\nAgain, I hope you found these translations helpful.\n\nGod Bless!\n\nSt. Francis of Assisi, pray for us!\n\nNota Bene: The Spanish translations of these bulls were found here.\n\nTranslation ©2011 Brandon P.
