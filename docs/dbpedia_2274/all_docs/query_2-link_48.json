        "text": "Three weeks into my marriage, I discovered my husband’s addiction to alcohol. It was like a one-and-done knock-out punch. I was out cold and left in a daze of anxiety and confusion for weeks. It was like getting shoved onto a roller-coaster of denial, anger, shame, fear, panic and extreme grief. But what surprised me the most was the lie.\n\n​\n\nA lie is like a slow black sludge that fills your heart and mind. It rots you from the inside out.\n\nI had been so panicked about the addiction in the first few days that I never thought twice about the betrayal; about the lie. Looking back on it now, it is so obvious that it had already triggered a deep shame within me, but I couldn’t see it then. And as it slowly sunk into my heart, almost unnoticed, the ground under my feet began to crumble.\n\n​Here’s the interesting part: most people would think that my husband’s betrayal would have broken the trust in our marriage, which it technically did, but the most harmful and unexpected consequence was that I stopped trusting myself. I didn’t know what was real and what wasn’t anymore. I didn’t know what parts of my lived experiences and memories I could trust, and that included God.\n\n​I had never felt so alone and so helpless in my life. I had absolutely no-one to turn to. I couldn’t turn to my friends and family because they would be biased, which would have just divided Daniel and I even more. I also couldn’t afford to go see a counselor.\n\nI scoured the internet for anything I could find to help me understand addiction. I looked everywhere I could for testimonies of couples that had found a way through so that I could try and imitate them and use their strategies, but I found almost nothing. Instead, I was met with devastating statistics about marriage and addiction. I had no one to turn to but God. Even though I wasn’t particularly impressed with Him at that time, I had no other choice.\n\nSo I reluctantly prayed… Since I was a young girl, everytime I had a problem in my life, my mom would tell me to go talk to Jesus about it. She never gave me any other instructions, she simply told me to go talk to Him. So that’s what I did, I talked to Him like I would anyone else and I have continued to do that in prayer time ever since. It has proven to be such an incredible blessing, and this situation was no exception.\n\nIt's crazy to think, but all of this happened in about six weeks. It all led up to one final period of prayer. In a moment of fear and despair, I asked God how He could have let me enter into a marriage where I would not be protected and provided for. His answer shocked me. I felt the greatness and firmness in His voice reverberate through my entire being as He said: “I am your protector and provider first. And I will give these things to you, through your husband, when and how I see fit.”\n\nAs I pondered these words in my heart, I began to see my husband through a completely new lens. Instead of seeing Daniel as someone who had failed me, I began to see him as a gift, as a vessel of God’s protection and provision. I no longer felt as though he owed me these things because it wasn’t really his job, it was God’s job. And if I didn’t receive these things through Daniel, it didn’t mean that I was deprived of them, but simply that God would provide them in a different way.\n\nWhat a shift in perspective! I was able to stop desperately grasping at my husband. I was able to release him, to free him. I realized that I had been robbing myself of the gift that my husband was, because when you believe someone owes you something, it's no longer a gift but the repayment of a debt. Now, instead of feeling like he was giving me what I was owed, everything he gave me felt like a bonus! Instead of anger and resentment, I was filled with gratitude for even the smallest things he would do.\n\n​\n\nYou can imagine how drastically different it would have been for him to be met with gratitude every time he did something good, and patience and forgiveness every time he failed. But loving like this is just not possible without God’s help.\n\n​It’s an amazing thing to look back over our story and see where we are today. We now have a thriving marriage filled with prayer, joy, honesty, and intimacy. People keep thinking we’re newlyweds, even though we’ve been married for over 7 years! It still feels like a dream to see him chasing God and taking his role as the Spiritual Leader of our family with joy and intentionality.\n\nA message from Most Rev. Jon Hansen, Bishop of Mackenzie-Fort Smith, NWT.\n\nAug. 18, 2023\n\n​\n\nGood morning everyone,\n\nFirst of all, thank you for all the wonderful thoughts and prayers that have filled my text and email apps. Yesterday I had a 12-hour drive from Yellowknife to Grande Prairie, where I am “sheltering”. I am one of the lucky evacuees who have family in Alberta so I am very comfortable staying in the home of my niece and her husband.\n\nThat’s not the case for all who were forced to leave. As I drove, I saw many tents and campers for the entire length of my journey. There will also be many families in hotels and evacuation centres across Alberta and British Columbia. I gathered the quote below from one of our information sources, Cabinradio.ca. (This is a fantastic media source for up to the minute information about the fires)\n\n“Approximately 63 percent of the NWT population is currently under evacuation order, if we use the most recent community population numbers provided by the NWT Bureau of Statistics. That’s about 28,904 residents, though this number doesn’t account for non-residents such as tourists or people here on short work contracts whose home province is elsewhere and would also be evacuating the NWT right now.”\n\nPresently there are various levels of crisis in the NWT. A number of communities including Yellowknife, Hay River, Fort Smith and Inuvik have fire at their doorsteps and we are just waiting to see what the weather will do to move the fires forward or to aid the firefighters and help hold the fires back. Other communities have already been breached including Behchoko (three homes lost) and Enterprise which was, according to reports, about 90% wiped out. I drove through there yesterday and it was the closest image to an apocalyptic wasteland that I have ever seen. For some communities such as Hay River and Katlodeeche, this is the second time they have been evacuated this summer, this after having to do the same a year ago due to floods.\n\nOn a brighter note, there is nothing like a crisis to bring out the best in humanity. There was a traffic stop at Big River (outside of Fort Providence), this is the only place on the 700km stretch between Yellowknife and High Level where you can stop for gas. With more than five thousand vehicles passing through a gas station with four pumps you can imagine that it could have been a place of chaos, and there was some of that. However, the prevalent mood was very neighbourly. People got out of their cars to stretch their legs and walk their dogs and spent time talking and laughing with one another. I was also surprised to see the many farm yards in northern Alberta that were freshly mowed and had big, hand-painted signs, offering free camping to all those equipped with tents and RVs.\n\nThe next few days are now just a matter of waiting to see what will happen next. All our staff and clergy are safe and accounted for, although they have been scattered to the wind by plane and by road. Keep the prayers coming as we ask for the miracle of rainfall in abundance for our parched land.\n\n​\n\nPeace\n\n+Jon\n\nDiocese of Mackenzie-Fort Smith\n\nIt was a long, four-year wait for us to attend Catholic Family Ministries' 25th Annual Family Life conference. It was with much excitement that we were heading back to Lac Ste. Anne for our 22nd time.\n\nAs a family we had only missed a couple; one for a family wedding and another for Father Troy Nguyen’s ordination. Even years where we thought about not going, our kids would not allow us to miss it as it's a special time for the entire family. The conference has greatly blessed our family. It's where Sean Lynn, my husband, met Steve Wood when we attended the very first conference, which led to the origins of how God Squad began, but that’s a story for another time.\n\nFamily Life Conference 2023, Spruce Grove, AB. Photo credit: Catholic Family Ministries.\n\nThe largest family reunion ever\n\n​In 1996, a group of like-minded friends from the Edmonton area who, led and inspired by Bob LeBlanc (now deceased), decided to heed the call of Pope Saint John Paul II who, in Familiaris Consortio, plead for families to “become what you are, the domestic Church and the heart of the world.”\n\nJoy in God’s will and healing\n\n​As part of this year’s conference, a healing service was held on Saturday night. Father Paul Moret, the spiritual director of the Family Life Ministries group and pastor of Holy Trinity parish in Spruce Grove, introduced Encounter Ministries. This Catholic organization seeks “to demonstrate the love of God through the power of the Holy Spirit in their sphere of influence.” Specifically, they offered a prayer service for healing. All attendees were invited to ask for physical healing and to be prayed for by those around them.\n\nThere were many healings that night, and I experienced it first-hand. When an invitation was extended for people with shoulder issues to stand up, I decided to participate - I had nothing to lose.\n\nI have not been able to raise my right arm past the height of my shoulder without rotating it due to calcification in the ligaments for the past 12 years or so. I must admit, I was sceptical. I was sitting next to my mom, so when people around those standing were invited to lay their hands on us, my mom had her hand on my right shoulder. I didn’t notice anything out of the ordinary - no lightning bolts, no hot flash; nothing. Later, my Mom told me her hand felt hot as she prayed for me.\n\nAs soon as the group prayer was done, they invited us to test our healing. I went to try to lift my arm up, outstretched, past my shoulder, fully expecting the familiar pain that usually prevented such movement. But I was able to keep going higher and higher until I held my arm straight above my head! I looked around at the people who had just prayed for me, and shrugged my shoulders in disbelief because I didn’t know what else to do. I had actually been healed! ​\n\nA few minutes later, they invited people who had abdominal issues to stand. I have suffered from IBS (Irritable Bowel Syndrome) for most of my life, and as time went by, I was only able to eat a very restricted diet to the point where I literally couldn’t eat at a restaurant without causing painful symptoms to ensue. I thought if it happened once, why not give it another shot?\n\nI stood, people prayed, then they asked us to test our healing. The only way I could verify this was to eat something I normally couldn’t and see what happened. The next morning, I did just that. Then, I waited. The usual symptoms that I would have experienced from consuming such food never occurred. I waited some more. Then I ate something else that would normally set me off. No reaction! I honestly thought that maybe it was like a placebo effect; that I wanted it to be true, so my body responded in kind. Three days later, I was still testing the healing. Now a month later, I can happily say that I was also healed of IBS!\n\nHealing service with Encounter Ministries at Family Life Conference. Photo credit: Catholic Family Ministries.\n\nThe day after the healing service, a wave of excitement went through the camp as people began to share their stories. A lovely lady that we knew from our parish in Calgary always had to walk and pace at the back of the church during Mass because a back injury made it too painful for her to sit and genuflect. That morning she had the biggest grin in the world. She spoke about how she was able to sit and kneel for the first time in many years.\n\nMy husband Sean, my family, and our friends were all amazed and overjoyed by my healing. As a person who had been living without gluten, dairy, many vegetables and spices that upset my system, it still feels surreal to enjoy salsa again, and rediscover how food can truly taste without causing pain! Sean loves to make savoury food, and I’m grateful he no longer has to prepare a bland and restricted version of his dishes for me. We can now enjoy meals that we prepare together.\n\nFast forward to August 2023, I find myself continually praising the Lord for what He has done for me. I’ve lived with a few chronic issues in my life, accepting the suffering, and making it my goal to offer these tribulations to the Lord for the sake of my salvation and others. But that night, I just felt a calling to participate and ask God for the gift of His healing.\n\nStill I question from time to time, feeling almost guilty for this gift of healing, because, after all, God had allowed this suffering in my life and I trust in His will and felt grateful for the opportunity to offer these little things back to Him. I felt I was given these opportunities to be able to walk with Him in His passion, much as Simon was able to do when He helped Jesus carry His cross. At first I wasn’t sure if I should be sharing this with others - as the healings felt more like a personal divine gift and revelation. However, I am now certain that it’s necessary for me to share this with others, to praise God for what He has done, and to instil hope in others with assurance of God’s love.\n\nWith upcoming healing services coming up in our diocese, I encourage you to participate and ask God for what you need in your life to fulfil His will. Go and trust what God has in store for you. If He wills you to heal, you will heal when you ask for it. Trust that God gives us what we need for our salvation, whether that be strength and perseverance to bear what He has given us, or healing.\n\nLet us hold unswervingly to the hope we profess, for he who promised is faithful.” ~Hebrews 10:23\n\n\"I was amazed to see one of our senior parishioners who broke her hand from shoulder to elbow on Saturday came on her wheelchair holding her hand in a sling to be part of this long-awaited groundbreaking ceremony for our new parish church. Nothing could stop her and all others to come and witness this great event,\" exclaimed Fr. Tomy Manjaly, Pastor of Sacred Heart Parish in Strathmore Parish in Alberta. This touching scene unfolded at their official groundbreaking ceremony on Tuesday, August 1, 2023.\n\nThe unwavering support and commitment of the community were palpable at the event. It is a significant milestone for the Sacred Heart Parish - the transformation of the former IGA Grocery Store located in downtown Strathmore into a place of worship. Led by Fr. Tomy Manjaly who blessed the site, the ceremony marked the transformative period for the parish.\n\nParish Council Coordinator Tomas Rochford shared his delight at the community's participation in the event. \"It was wonderful to see all the parishioners and local residents come out to enjoy the celebration; it was a cross-section of our community: patriarchs and matriarchs from long-established families, families with small children who recently joined our parish, members of our large Filipino community, and even some individuals who have been ‘testing the waters’ to learn more about the faith as they contemplate ‘swimming the Tiber’ to become Catholic,\" he said.\n\nFundraising Chair Nettie Hendricks also shared her emotional connection to the project. \"I saw the tears on the faces of some members who were here when the previous church was built in 1953, and I felt a connection to them since I have been there myself since 1960,\" she said.\n\nIndeed, the persistent support of the community underscores the significance of this project - not just as a physical transformation of a building, but also as a spiritual journey for the entire community. As Hendricks pointed out, “Strathmore has grown exponentially over the past few years and the number of parish families has increased dramatically since Covid retired. The new church will be an anchor for these families to celebrate Sacraments and faith.”\n\nRochford added, “It will encourage many former or distant Catholics to return and come ‘try it out’, which would be wonderful because we have such a holy pastor who is our spiritual leader, who celebrates Holy Mass in a manner that inspires prayer and sacrifice, and our parish has been striving to offer many means to welcome and form new and experienced members in the fullness of the Catholic Faith.”\n\nA space for prayer & centre for the work of mercy\n\nSacred Heart church is not only undergoing a transformation of a former grocery store into a place of worship, it is also set to house relics from St. John Paul II, making it a significant site for prayer, contemplation, and pilgrimage. (Read “St. John Paul II’s relics in our Diocese”, by Sara Francis in Faithfully, 2021). Rochford hopes that the new church space can serve as a hub for faith formation activities, drawing inspiration from the teachings of St. John Paul II. See walkthrough video for the anticipated Shrine Chapel of St. John Paul II.\n\nThe new church design will also include a commercial kitchen, which anticipates the need to assist families struggling to make ends meet and the growing homeless population in Strathmore. The community hall, part of the new design, will provide another gathering place for special events such as wedding receptions and smaller conventions.\n\nHendrick expresses her delight at this development. \"As a Christian, we are called to work for social justice so I am especially happy to see the commercial kitchen because it represents the first step to setting up an outreach program for the less fortunate,\" she says.\n\nRochford resonates with this sentiment, visualizing the central location of the church as an important opportunity to serve the local residents through corporal and spiritual acts of mercy. \"From running potential weekday soup kitchens to weekly Bible studies to 24-hour adoration, we aim to offer Christ to all who step foot in our new building,\" he shares.\n\nThe Way of Beauty\n\nRochford, a local resident whose parents moved to Strathmore six years ago to be near his family, shares their anticipation for the completion of the new church. “They are especially excited by the fact that we have tried to build a church that is in architectural and artistic continuity with the entirety of the Catholic tradition,\" he says. His parents, who grew up before the Second Vatican Council, hold fond memories of beautiful Masses in beautiful churches.\n\nRochford also shares their deep longing after witnessing many churches lose their sense of beauty. Quoting Bishop Barron, he says that the Catholic community is finally moving out of the period of beige Catholicism, re-embracing the Way of Beauty in the universal Church. \"Our small-town parish church will be a humble contribution to this renaissance of Catholic culture in Canada,” he adds.\n\n\"Our architecture team, led by Mr. Jun Lee, was able to design a beautiful neo-Romanesque style church from the bones of a grocery store!\" Rochford says. (Read more: “Transforming a Grocery Store into a Church” by Brent Wiley, 2018) He reassures that no one will mistake the new building for any secular building because the external look and the internal forms speak the language of the Catholic faith in wood, metal, and drywall.\n\nInterest continues to grow in the unique transformation of this downtown building. For a glimpse of this transformation, the Parish has shared a video link on their website: https://youtu.be/ASEc_JutFgA\n\nRelying on your prayers & support\n\nFr. Tomy Manjaly conveys his deep appreciation for all those who have supported their church transformation project through their time, talent, and resources. \"I can't stop thanking God for all those who have helped us in various ways to make this day possible,\" says Fr. Manjaly. He acknowledges that while they've made a strong start, the journey is far from over. \"We continue to depend on the generosity of so many good people to complete the task which we have just begun.\"\n\nThe project cost is approximately $10M. To date, just over $6M has been collected through the generous support of the parish community. The parish remains optimistic about addressing the remaining capital shortfall of $3M through the collective efforts of the community.\n\nHendricks, committed to continuing fundraising efforts both within and outside the parish community, expresses her hope for the future. \"With the tangible presence of construction, we will see some additional donations to help us cross the financial finish line,\" she says.\n\nAs Sacred Heart Parish commences this monumental journey, the energy and anticipation within the parish remain vibrant. They extend their heartfelt gratitude to the good people of the Diocese for their unwavering prayerful and financial support. They humbly request the continued generosity and prayers of the community to help them bring this project to completion.\n\nPhotos courtesy of Lynn Dumont, Sacred Heart Parish, Strathmore.\n\nDaniel Tang confesses, “I have never left the continent before, nor have I ever camped outside; I have not flown across the ocean, and I am usually uncomfortable in large crowds.” Yet in this monumental leap, Tang is prepared to step beyond his comfort zone. He is one of the 40 pilgrims from St. Francis Xavier Chaplaincy (SFXC) leaving for Lisbon, Portugal for World Youth Day (WYD) 2023, accompanied by Fr. Cristino Bouvette and Fr. Santiago Torres.\n\nHe further shares, “This theme that Mary arose and went with haste (Luke 1:39) reminds me to trust in God's providence on every step of the way - to have no fear of the unknown, and to have peace and know that He will provide.”\n\nThe SFXC pilgrims are eagerly looking forward to representing the Diocese in the World Youth Day, together with 8 young adults from Our Lady of Perpetual Help Parish in Calgary, and representatives from numerous lay associations throughout the Diocese. Inspired by Pope Francis, the young adults are thrilled to partake in this global Catholic youth event with the support of their families fuelling their enthusiasm.\n\n​\n\n\"It was very influential in both of my parents' lives when they were younger,\" shares Francis Van Uden.\n\n​For Jessica Brummelhuis, her family's excitement about the possibility of attending a World Youth Day together was contagious. \"Their faces would all light up when talking about WYD. I didn't understand then; I didn't know what it was or why it excited them so much. But their excitement sparked my interest, and now I'm the one attending out of all of us. They couldn't be happier for me,\" she shares.\n\n​Fr. Cristino Bouvette is particularly thrilled about the opportunity to connect and journey alongside the Diocese of Sault Ste. Marie, led by his close friend who also serves as his counterpart. Fr. Cris' experience with World Youth Day is extensive, as he shares, “This will be my fourth World Youth Day, spanning back to WYD 2002 in Toronto (though for that I only attended days in the diocese) but I got to experience Pope St. John Paul II's last WYD, Pope Benedict XVI's first WYD in his homeland of Cologne, Germany, and with Pope Francis in 2016, Krakow, during the Extraordinary Jubilee Year of Mercy.\"\n\n“After closely organizing the Holy Father's visit to Canada last year, being part of a papal event this year will offer a new perspective, especially knowing the inner workings and hopefully even meeting and introducing our group to the Pope's collaborators who will be attending WYD with him in Lisbon.”\n\n​Asked about what excites them in Portugal, the pilgrims express their eagerness to experience new culture, connecting with fellow young Catholics globally, and enjoying the excitement of being in a new location.\n\nKathleen Brul, Elvin Limpin, and Andrew Min look forward to pray together with young Catholics worldwide. Kathleen shares, “I am thrilled about the prospect of joining the overnight vigil and eucharistic adoration with everyone.”\n\nAndrew, too, is eager to unite in prayer and worship with other young adults. He says, “Being a young Catholic in today's world can be challenging. Sharing this pilgrimage with other young adults passionate about their faith is a wonderful way to rejuvenate one's own convictions.\"\n\nWYD delegation from Our Lady of Perpetual Help Parish, Calgary.

She adds, “Above all, I am honoured to be able to have the opportunity to delve more deeply into the message of Fatima with the pilgrims.” Her anticipation for visiting the Fatima site resonates with many, including Kathleen Brul who says, “I've never visited a Marian apparition site before, and Our Lady of Fatima holds such a vital place in Portuguese history.”\n\nKathleen also reveals that a pivotal moment occurred during a Mass at the Commonwealth Stadium in Edmonton last year, when she was navigating a difficult period in her life. This experience ignited her journey of faith. ​“Pope Francis' papal visit set my heart on fire for Jesus … I finally felt free from all the things that had kept me away from true joy and fulfilment,” she says. “I decided to go to World Youth Day to celebrate the joy and peace God has blessed me with throughout this past year…”\n\nSFXC held a WYD dinner fundraiser in June 2023. Photos courtesy of Daniel Tang.\n\nMary Arose and went with haste (Luke 1:39)\n\nThe theme for World Youth Day 2023, \"Mary arose and went with haste,\" has sparked various interpretations among participants. Some view it as a motivational call to disseminate the Gospel promptly, while others perceive it as an encouragement to trust in God's divine plan.\n\nThis theme truly encompasses Mary's faith and obedience, inspiring participants to leave their comfort zones and welcome the unknown with joy. Cameron Bluekens reflects on this, saying, “Mary didn't delay in spreading the Gospel. It was the presence of God in her that moved her to share the Good News with zeal and generosity - I would like to be blessed with the same virtues.”\n\nFor pilgrim Jonathan Dobek, the theme for WYD 2023 speaks into a specific action. He says, “After WYD, with Mary’s help, I will get up and in haste go to seminary to discern and learn what God has in store for me.” Jonathan has been accepted by Bishop McGrattan to enter St. Joseph Seminary in Edmonton as a seminarian for our Diocese, beginning the last week of August.\n\nOur young adults have also shared a variety of hopes for their attendance at World Youth Day. Some express a desire to strengthen their faith, charity, and zeal, while others aim to better incorporate their faith into daily life.\n\nElizabeth Spiess and Mark Oswald look forward to forging new friendships during the World Youth Day 2023 pilgrimage. \"I also hope to deepen my connections with old friends,\" adds Mark. Simultaneously, Elizabeth envisions contributing to the growth of youth ministry in her parish.\n\nAndrew Min concluded his thoughts by sharing that he aims to inspire other young adults with his experiences from this spiritual journey. He hopes that his stories might encourage them to consider embarking on this pilgrimage themselves in the future.\n\nDespite their individual aspirations, there is a shared openness to the spiritual journey that this pilgrimage may offer. Daniel Tang wraps it up by saying, “I truly believe that witnessing the Living Universal Body of Christ would bear much fruit to be shared back in our respective Dioceses.”\n\nCCCB press release: More than 5,000 Canadian Youth are making their way to Lisbon, Portugal to be with Pope Francis, from 1 to 6 August 2023. The Holy Father will join more than one million young people for World Youth Day (WYD). The first international World Youth Day was held in 1986, and the event was hosted by Canada in 2002, with Pope Saint John Paul II making the pilgrimage to Toronto. Read more\n\nMy 95 year old mother did not know a grandparent, a cousin, an aunt or an uncle growing up. But it is like the Lord is making up for what she did not have, as now there are close to 90 of us with our families and children and grandchildren and great grandchildren. Truly, the blessings of abundance are bountiful!\n\nCelebrating the third World Day for Grandparents and the elderly is especially heartwarming for me this year. First, to be a grandparent to 11 on earth, and to have my own mother still with us as a grandmother and great grandmother is truly a blessing.\n\n​\n\nThe alignment of the World Youth Day preparations with the celebration of this day serves as a reminder for young adults to appreciate the gift of their grandparents. As they participate in the festivities in Lisbon, Portugal, this year's World Day for Grandparents and Elderly theme, \"His Mercy is from age to age\" (Luke 1:15), echoes a message that God’s eyes are always on us. Taken from the Visitation of Mary to her cousin Elizabeth, this verse speaks volumes of the generations who celebrate in this Mercy.\n\nThe connection between the young and the old is vitally important. Whether it is being there as a grandparent to offer support and wisdom, or whether it is accepting the outstretched hand of the young offering help, both are so very necessary. Even if your grandparents are no longer with you, there are many elderly waiting to receive the touch of a grandchild figure, or for them to be a grandparent to a child.\n\n​\n\nDuring the pandemic when care facilities, and other living accommodations were closed off to visitors, our family came up with an idea to be able to see mom everyday by using FaceTime. This allows us to pray the daily rosary with her, to bring to prayer those who had special needs, and to remain connected. For over 2.5 years we have continued the practice as a family, and those who are able to join in can do so on any given day.\n\nThere are countless ways to maintain strong connections with our elderly loved ones, and each small effort can make a significant difference. Looking for ideas?\n\nInvite your elderly loved ones to Mass or rosary prayers in your community, especially this Sunday, July 23, the World Day for Grandparents and the Elderly. Be sure to share the message of our Holy Father to them for the World Day.\n\nEnjoy outdoor activities with the elderly - a leisurely stroll or a picnic can offer quality bonding time.\n\nVirtual visits (via FaceTime, Zoom, etc.) have become easier to navigate due to COVID. Many elderly individuals are now zoom-savvy, and some can ask friends or neighbours for help setting up these platforms.\n\nPlay games! Engage in board games, card or online games (like Pogo or even Minecraft). You can help set it up on their iPad or computer, and let the fun begin!\n\nCooking together is a wonderful activity to engage in with grandparents or elderly loved ones. Compile favourite recipes with your elderly loved ones and cook them together. It's a fun way to spend time together while preserving family traditions.\n\nAssisting the elderly with errands - such as grocery shopping, driving to appointments, household repairs, or garden pruning - is a gesture that they're sure to appreciate greatly.\n\nWrite letters to your elderly loved ones - The art of writing letters may seem archaic, but its charm is timeless. The experience of holding and reading from a piece of paper filled with personal thoughts and sentiments can be deeply moving. It's a unique way to share your life and express your love.\n\nLast but not least, make the time to call your grandparents or someone elderly, and engage in a sincere conversation. This seemingly small act of connection will undoubtedly be cherished.\n\nAs grandparents we experience the joys and sufferings of each of our children and grandchildren. There are special needs, and there are many ways that we can be a blessing to our grown children and our grandchildren. I always recall with great gratitude the many times my own parents took our children, and the mercy shown to us when we were young parents. It is this boundless mercy shown to us that I desire to pass on to our own children and grandchildren. Those blessings that we received as young parents are still felt today, as I reach out to, and try to provide a place of secure welcome to our own grandchildren.\n\n​\n\nTo witness to, and to be there for our grandchildren, as our presence is required, allows our grandchildren to receive so many benefits of family living united in the hope and the promise of the gospel message.\n\nWe are called to be there, and to especially be there for our aging parents / grandparents. To be a sign of hope in a culture that wants to cancel people is so very important. It means taking a stand and to pray through our current culture, while keeping our focus on what brings life. To be people of hope, when all hope seems diminished stands as a beacon for the world. God’s plan is so much bigger than what we can imagine, and we can be that sign of hope for others. It is not about a “perfect” life, it is about allowing God’s will and His plan to unfold for our lives, having the cross at the centre. It is about caring for those that God puts in our path. The love and respect given to and from grandparents can never be diminished.\n\nWhen cultures are cancelling the weak and the vulnerable, it is time to stand up, and be counter cultural. Let us be the “voice of one crying out in the wilderness” (Isaiah 40:3). Do not be afraid to be the one to show His Mercy, and to respect the life we have been given from conception to natural death.\n\nMy grandfather, when asked how to raise children, simply said, “teach them their faith, and use good common sense.” Today this is still sound advice, so simple and yet so true. His words of wisdom have stood the test of time.\n\n​\n\nAs we navigate through this complex and unforgiving world, let’s revisit this advice, and may we proclaim with boldness the message of mercy to our grandchildren.\n\nHas dishonor crept into the way we relate with our elders?\n\nJoin Archbishop Richard Smith for a discussion about his grandparents, the art of storytelling across generations, the troubling societal trend of neglecting our elders, how older Bishops have mentored him, the connection between World Youth Day and strengthening the relationship between different generations of Catholics, and much more. https://caedm.ca/upfront/\n\nHuman trafficking is a highly-organized crime that involves exploiting humans for forced labour, sexual slavery, and commercial sexual exploitation. It is also one of the fastest growing crimes in Canada. 72% of reported human trafficking victim in Canada are under 25 years of age, and 93% of reported victims are Canadians being trafficked domestically. (Source: #NotInMyCity).\n\nAssessing the national and global reach of human trafficking is a challenging task due to the covert nature of these crimes, the unwillingness of victims and witnesses to approach law enforcement, and the practical challenges of identifying victims. While no one is immune to falling victim, some individuals face a higher risk. The key to tackling this issue lies in our collaborative efforts and unity.\n\n​\n\nTo safeguard your children from this crime, we can learn the signs of trafficking and talk openly about the risks with them. Honest discussions can make a big difference. Here's what we can do to help end human trafficking:\n\n​\n\nLearn about Trafficking. Become aware of the indicators of human trafficking.

The scenes from everyday life are set in the U.S. city of Detroit. In fact, the Pope Video for the month of July was produced thanks to the help of the Archdiocese of Detroit. This collaboration is not accidental, as Archbishop Allen H. Vigneron explains. “We are deeply grateful for this opportunity to support our Holy Father and the Pope Video initiative. In particular, we feel honoured to produce this video on the Eucharist. The timing is providential since our archdiocese, and all of the dioceses, in the United States are engaged in a Eucharistic Revival to restore an awareness and devotion to Jesus Christ in the Blessed Sacrament. We pray that this video will serve as a convincing invitation to all of us in the universal Church to encounter Jesus and thank Him for the precious gift of Himself in the Eucharist.”\n\nGoing out of ourselves, opening ourselves to others\n\nIn this Pope Video, Pope Francis explains “the logic of the Eucharist,” which “gives us the courage to encounter others, to go out of ourselves, and to open ourselves to others with love.” He had already indicated this in an Angelus from June 2021 when he pointed out that Jesus, “at the end of his life, does not distribute an abundance of bread to feed the multitudes, but breaks himself apart at the Passover supper with the disciples.” In some way, Pope Francis continued, Jesus showed us “that the aim of life lies in self-giving, that the greatest thing is to serve.” This is why the Pope encourages us to encounter Jesus in the Eucharist, because that is where we receive the capacity to love others and to allow ourselves to be transformed by Him.\n\nThe Eucharist at the centre\n\nFather Frédéric Fornos S.J., International Director of the Pope’s Worldwide Prayer Network, commented on this intention: “Once more, Pope Francis reminds us where to focus, and what is truly important in our lives. The Eucharist is an encounter with the Risen Jesus, he tells us. Jesus Christ wants to transform us, to give us his capacity to love, so we can place ourselves at the service of His mission. How many times do we reduce the Mass to a ritual, the priest’s homily, or to receiving communion? Instead, it is a personal and communal encounter with the Risen Lord to which the Eucharistic Youth Movement (EYM), the youth branch of the Pope’s Worldwide Prayer Network, invites us. When we allow ourselves to be transformed by Jesus Christ in the Eucharist, we assimilate His way of living and we will want to share in His mission of compassion for the world. Let us accompany the Holy Father this month with this prayer intention so we might draw closer to this transformative experience.”\n\nWhen my alarm went off at 4am I have to admit that I really didn’t feel like driving 3 ½ hours to attend a retreat. Thank goodness that all I had to do was drive to St. Mary’s Parish in Brooks from Medicine Hat. There, my colleague Juliana would be awaiting, as she graciously volunteered to navigate us through the remaining 2 ½ hours to Mount St. Francis in Cochrane.\n\nLooking back, I now realize that my retreat began the moment I stepped into Juliana’s car.\n\nAs we exchanged stories and experiences about our ministries and how we serve our church communities, a scripture verse from Matthew came to me, “For where two or three are gathered in my name, I am there among them.” Mt. 18:20.\n\nIt’s moments like these, where we can share our faith and particularly how we live our faith, that are both encouraging and comforting to me. Our conversation also reaffirmed in my mind the diversity of each parish is, a reality I am acutely aware of, given my work with both Catholic churches in Medicine Hat.\n\nThe trip went quickly and before I knew it, we were pulling into the Mount St. Francis parking lot. I was excited and very eager to see what was in store for us at the retreat.\n\nAs everyone congregated in the conference room to find their places, I sensed such a spirit of joy and fellowship. The room buzzed with warm greetings and friendly introductions as we gathered together for the same purpose: to reflect, engage and spend time with the Lord. Once again, Matthew 18:20 echoed in my thoughts.\n\nThe retreat began with songs of praise, followed by everyone sharing a little information about themselves and their ministries. We were then asked to reflect on some questions and share our thoughts with those at our individual tables. These were simple questions, yet they urged us to reflect on our beginnings in the faith, who inspired us, and how we are currently inspiring others in their faith. I loved hearing about other people’s journeys and even though we live in different cities, we were pleasantly surprised to discover some shared inspirational mentors.\n\nThe retreat progressed with Fr. Kenneth LeBlanc sharing his story about his father’s conversion and the subsequent unfolding of his journey to the priesthood. He was wonderful to listen to and again, so joyful. My heart felt so uplifted after his presentation.\n\nOf course, a retreat would not be complete without Holy Mass and Adoration of the Blessed Sacrament. As we sang, prayed both aloud as well as in the silence of our hearts, I was deeply moved by the sense of our unity. Even though we did not all know one another, I felt a oneness of heart and mind with Christ being the Center of it all.\n\nEverything about the retreat, from the beautiful songs, group discussions, Fr. Kenneth’s testimony, personal reflection, mass, adoration, and even the tasty lunch where we could once again enjoy fellowship, was so uplifting. If you were to ask me what I enjoyed the most about the retreat, I would respond that I don’t have a favourite part because in all of it Christ was so present.\n\nI thank the staff at the Catholic Pastoral Centre (especially Huy & Anthony) and everyone at Mount St. Francis for allowing us this opportunity to come together. Being part a of a rural church, I sometimes feel isolated and maybe even a bit disconnected, but as the events of this day unfolded, I was reminded that I really am part of a larger family, and I look forward to all of us getting together again in His Name.\n\nBecause as we know… “For where two or three are gathered in my name, I am there among them.” Matthew 18:20.\n\nSubmitted by Sally Myers, Sacramental Prep Coordinator for Holy Family Church and St. Patrick’s Church in Medicine Hat, Alberta.\n\n“War is the ultimate human failure,” says Capt./Fr. John Nemanic. Not a sentiment I expect to hear from a military chaplain but Fr. John is adamant. “Human beings are called to be in communion with one another; to love and help each other. I had to grapple with this.” As we continue the interview, he expands on this conflict.\n\n​\n\nBarely nine months ago, Fr. John was a diocesan priest in the Diocese of Calgary. Now he is a chaplain serving in the Roman Catholic Military Ordinariate of Canada (RC Milord Canada) under the supervision of Bishop Scott McCaig. The RCMilord is described as “a diocese of massive dimensions” serving not only military members and their families at home, but also wherever the Canadian Armed Forces (CAF) have a presence around the world.\n\nFr. John is simultaneously an officer, serving under a military chain of command including the Royal Canadian Chaplain Service (RCChS). This branch of the military, which Fr. John describes as similar to Alberta Catholic schools in that it serves all faiths. According to the National Defence website, “CAF chaplains attend to the needs of all members of the CAF and their families, whether they identify with a particular Faith Tradition, have no specific spiritual/faith practice, belief or custom, or are spiritually curious.”\n\nIn some ways, this is similar to parish work, caring for the spiritual needs of all CAF members, those who are Catholic, those from other faith backgrounds or those who have none. The pluralism found within the CAF reflects that seen in Canadian society as a whole, so chaplains have to be prepared to deal with all of it. Fr. John says, “As individual chaplains we’re told to be faithful to our faith traditions, so I might refer for example, a same-sex marriage request, to another chaplain. The chaplain might also refer military families to the local (secular) parish, for example, for sacramental preparation or for French-language Mass. He also liaises with other houses of worship nearby to be able to refer different faith adherents appropriately. It’s an environment of ecumenism and outreach into which chaplains are rigorously initiated.\n\nFr. John felt a calling to the military as early as his calling to the priesthood. His father served in the Yugoslavian army, so after Fr. John was ordained in 2008, he considered serving as a reservist. However, he found the commitment unsustainable with full time parish work. In 2017, his yearning to serve for the military resurfaced during centennial celebrations of the Battle of Vimy Ridge. Eventually, he applied to the RCChS and began a long process of interviews, physical tests, evaluations, educational qualification assessments and personal reference checks. “This was also to test the call,” Fr. John says, “A lot of it was prayer.”\n\nOnce he was accepted, he was posted to Garrison Petawawa in Ontario (population 19,000 including 6,000 people directly connected to the base). He then began 13 weeks of basic training from 5 am to 10 pm. It was a tough regimen designed to emphasize teamwork and endurance under adversity, as well as essential fighting skills. Chaplains do not carry weapons, although they do have to learn how to safely disarm them. They also do not command any personnel but bear an officer’s rank so they can minister to members at all levels. Chaplains have authority, and an obligation, to present significant issues from the rank-and-file to higher-ups. They also preside at religious services and form part of the group which delivers news to a family following an incident.\n\nIt was during basic training that Fr. John experienced a memorable moment. Among his fellow trainees, who ranged in age from 19 to 50, one approached him expressing suicidal thoughts. Fr. John arranged for mental health support for the person. He remembers being awed and humbled by the “power of the padre”, to be trusted with a confidence at the outset of his training. Not all his experiences were as positive.\n\nWhile visiting the Canadian War Museum in Ottawa during Basic Training, he paused in front of a large display of instruments meant to kill and maim. “My stomach churned,” he says, “I wondered, ‘am I enabling this by serving in the CAF?’” With the help of an advisor, he came to understand differently. “Canada’s interests in going to war are noble: to defend our country and defend those who need our help.” He goes on to say that Jesus met violence with acceptance when he submitted to being crucified. Chaplains can provide solace to those who’ve had to kill and those suffering from PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder). Fr. John explains that soldiers have to accept what the military terms ‘unlimited liability’ which means they cannot refuse an order even if it places them in dire danger. Officers have to deal with issuing such orders. Even peacekeepers, who are not permitted to fire unless first fired upon, can encounter terrible situations which they are powerless to affect.\n\n“It’s such a conundrum to support CAF members but not believe in war,” Fr. John says. “Only God can bring creation out of chaos. Pray for peace in our hearts and homes. Pray that there is no more war and no need for the military but pray also for our soldiers.”\n\nFr. John ends our interview the same way he began it, with gratitude to Bishop McGrattan for “putting me on loan to the military”. He says fervently, “I would never have found peace until I knew if I could do this. God has put me in a place where I can really help people.”"
