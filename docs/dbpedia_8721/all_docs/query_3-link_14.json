        "text": "THE WIZARD OF OZ\n\nWarner Home Video continues to polish the crown jewels in the studio’s library with “The Wizard of Oz 70th Anniversary Ultimate Collector’s Edition.” It is the third release of this beloved family classic on DVD since 1999 and the first on Blu-ray. According to Warner, the film has been completely remastered from the original Technicolor camera negatives, yielding a DVD transfer with twice the resolution of the already excellent 2005 version. With its bright, tight colors and pristine surface  there doesn’t seem to be a single dust speck on the image or a pop on the soundtrack  this “Wizard of Oz” is a magnificent demonstration of digital technology used to preserve and perpetuate a crucial artifact of the analog past.\n\nA box-office disappointment on its first theatrical release in August 1939, “The Wizard of Oz” assumed its place in American culture (and our collective subconscious) primarily through the annual holiday television broadcasts that began in 1956. The aura of specialness that attended those broadcasts  here was a spectacle that could only be glimpsed once a year  can never be recaptured in our age of media ubiquity and on-demand access, which makes it doubtful that the film will seem as personally meaningful to future generations as it does to the baby boomers who grew up with it.\n\nFor those who did, “The Wizard of Oz” remains among the most Proustian of movies, triggering waves of involuntary memories with each viewing. If there ever was a film that truly lies beyond criticism, “The Wizard of Oz” may well be it: for every viewer it is a different experience, layered with emotions and associations built up over the years.\n\nAnd yet the dispassionate spectator can admire the film’s many accomplished formal elements, beginning with the screenplay derived from L. Frank Baum’s 1900 novel and written by a team that included Noel Langley, Florence Ryerson, Edgar Allan Woolf and at least a dozen other uncredited contributors. The symmetrical structure, in which the Technicolor Oz is bookended by sepia sequences set in parched, dustbowl Kansas, imbues the material with themes of memory and imagination, while the three-pronged quest  for heart, brain, and courage  generates plot structure, character definition and musical cues with uncommon clarity and elegance.\n\nIf there is a tiny flaw in this latest version, it lies in the treatment of the Kansas scenes, which have been given a golden, nostalgic glow that doesn’t jibe (at least in my subjective “Oz”) with the stark, Depression-era imagery of the Gale farm. These sequences, perhaps the most visually expressive in the film, were directed without credit by the Texas-born King Vidor, who had a particular flair for rural subjects (“Hallelujah!,” “Our Daily Bread”), and help anchor the timeless fantasy of Oz in a precise moment in American history.\n\nThe new Warner edition contains a staggering amount of supplementary material, much of it  including audio for some deleted scenes and the home movies taken on the set by the composer Harold Arlen  carried over from the 2005 release. New to this iteration are a documentary on Victor Fleming, the film’s credited director; a “sing-along” subtitle stream; a 52-page book assembled by the Oz authority John Fricke; reproductions of the original press book and budget sheets; and full-length versions of two silent features, “The Magic Cloak of Oz” and “The Patchwork Girl of Oz,” produced in 1914 by Baum himself. There’s also an emerald green wristwatch, presumably for Oz fans with appointments to keep back in the real world. (Warner Home Video, Blu-ray $84.99, standard definition $69.92, two-disc barebones edition $24.98, G.)\n\nWAGON MASTER\n\n“The Wizard of Oz” isn’t the only impressive release from Warner Brothers this month. With less fanfare (and, presumably, much less of a production budget), the company has released an edition of John Ford’s 1950 western “Wagon Master” that is a sheer delight for the eyes and ears. The DVD is available only in standard definition, but in terms of the contrast and detail with which Bert Glennon’s black-and-white cinematography has been rendered, the visual experience is the next best thing to Blu-ray.\n\nMade on a small budget without major stars, “Wagon Master” is among the freest and most experimental of Ford’s films. There is just enough of a plot  a pair of horse traders, Travis (Ben Johnson) and Sandy (Harry Carey Jr.) lead a Mormon wagon train across the Utah desert to a promised land in the San Juan Valley  to allow Ford to string together a series of archetypical actions and incidents. Set to songs performed by the country and western group the Sons of the Pioneers, “Wagon Master” approaches a musical abstraction and purity. This is a film that Ford is clearly making for himself, not a studio.\n\nBreaking with classical tradition, Ford manipulates the narrative structure, opening with a violent, pre-credit sequence (very unusual for the time) and moving toward an open ending that finds the wagon train still in transition. (The film was the unofficial inspiration for the television series “Wagon Train” starring Ward Bond, who appears here as the leader of the Mormon expedition.) The use of telephoto lenses to narrow in on the action and the occasional appearance of light flares in the lens look forward to techniques more associated with Sam Peckinpah in the ’70s than with Ford in the ’50s, and they introduce a rough, unfinished quality that contrasts effectively with the cosmic serenity of Ford’s wide landscape shots.\n\n“Wagon Master” is closely knit into the vast body of work that Ford created between his first film in 1917 and his death in 1973. Harry Carey Jr. (who can be heard on the audio commentary with the filmmaker and Ford scholar Peter Bogdanovich) was the son of Ford’s first star when he set out as a young filmmaker in the teens (and one of the behavioral models for John Wayne). Alan Mowbray essentially repeats his role as the alcoholic Shakespearean from “My Darling Clementine.” And Ruth Clifford, who first worked with Ford in the 1923 “The Face on the Barroom Floor,” plays Mowbray’s companion.\n\nOne of the rare outsiders in the cast is Charles Kemper, who plays the portly, sadistic outlaw (and head of a clan of inbred gunfighters) who commandeers the train; his sheer unfamiliarity inserts a radically disruptive new element in Ford’s world, a kind of unmotivated, sociopathic evil that would increasingly appear in the noirish westerns of the ’50s, and come to dominate the Spaghetti westerns of the ’70s. Impossible, as always, to pin down  was he a radical or a reactionary, a restless innovator or a fierce protector of tradition?  Ford remains Ford, one of the great American artists of the 20th century in any field. (Warner Home Video, $19.98, not rated)\n\nALSO OUT THIS WEEK\n\nMONSTERS VS. ALIENS Animated characters based on famous science-fiction creations of the 1950s  including a 49-foot-11 woman (with the voice of Reese Witherspoon) and a mad scientist with the head of a cockroach (Hugh Laurie) battle space invaders in this DreamWorks production directed by Conrad Vernon and Rob Letterman. In March A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times that movie “cheerfully converts the two major sources of cinematic terror  invaders from outer space and inhuman, ungodly terrestrial creatures  into wacky, goofy, familiar figures.” Although the film was released theatrically in 3-D, the home video version is in 2-D, with a new 3-D short, “B.O.B.’s Big Break,” included as an extra. (Paramount, Blu-ray $39.99, standard definition $34.98, PG)\n\nTHE GIRLFRIEND EXPERIENCE Steven Soderbergh’s independent film examines the life of a highly paid call girl (Sasha Grey) as she negotiates a New York City where simple affection has become a commodity. “’The Girlfriend Experience’ is about, and also traffics in, the intoxification of surfaces, and to say it objectifies Ms. Grey, who is very young (just 21) and very pretty, would be more plot summary than critique,” wrote A. O. Scott in the Times in May. (Magnolia, Blu-ray $34.98, standard definition $26.98, R)\n\nMIDSOMER MURDERS: SET 13 Four new episodes from the popular British mystery series, based on the novels of Caroline Graham and starring John Nettles as a detective whose beat is a violence-prone rural county. (Acorn, $49.99, not rated)\n\nAWAY WE GO A young married couple (John Krasinski and Maya Rudolph) travel across America looking for an appropriate environment in which to raise the child they are expecting. Sam Mendes (“Revolutionary Road”) directed from a script by Dave Eggers and Vendela Vida. While the stars are “appealing and unaffected,” Mr. Scott wrote in Times in June, “it’s clear that they are acutely, at times painfully, aware of their special status as uniquely sensitive, caring, smart and cool beings on a planet full of cretins and failures.” (Focus Features, Blu-ray $39.98, standard definition $29.98, R)\n\nTHE PATTY DUKE SHOW: SEASON ONE All 26 episodes of the 1963-64 debut season of the classic sitcom about a Brooklyn Heights teenager (Patty Duke) and her look-alike cousin from Scotland (Patty Duke). (Shout! Factory, $44.99, not rated)\n\nMANAGEMENT An unambitious motel manager (Steve Zahn) falls hard for a highly motivated sales agent (Jennifer Aniston) in a romantic comedy directed by Stephen Belber. The result is “a small, sweet-natured” tale with “a generosity of spirit that makes you believe that good people summoning a lot of pluck can make good things happen,” Stephen Holden wrote in The Times in May.
