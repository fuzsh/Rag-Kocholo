All our movie reviews are at nytimes.com/reviews/movies.\n\nHOLLIS FRAMPTON’S ‘PALINDROME’ AND OWEN LAND’S ‘WIDE ANGLE SAXON’ at Light Industry (Jan. 14, 7 p.m.). P. Adams Sitney, whose book “Visionary Film” remains a cornerstone of the study of experimental cinema, will introduce 16-millimeter screenings of work by two of the avant-garde’s major filmmakers. Frampton said that “Palindrome” was inspired by the images that formed at the ends of film rolls during lab work — bits of celluloid that were normally thrown away. Land’s “Wide Angle Saxon” pokes fun, in part, at the idea of what Sitney described as the “structural film,” a category of experimental movie in which the “overall shape is its predominant characteristic.” In other words, a structural film calls attention to the components of filmmaking — lighting, sound, lenses and so on.\n\nlightindustry.org\n\n[Read about the events that our other critics have chosen for the week ahead.]"
