To survive, a band of Mormons traveling across the vast Utah desert must learn to collaborate with the people they meet on the trail: bandits, dance hall girls and native Americans--and the seasoned Western tracker they have hired as Wagonmaster. Ward Bond, Harey Carey, Jr. and Academy Award winner Ben Johnson star as the Mormon patriarch looking for a new life on the frontier and the two horse traders who lead the Mormons to the San Juan River valley. Now, these very different people will have to find a way to work together to survive a trek across the desert and a perilous crossing of the untamed Colorado River in this Western classic.",

        "text": "Cinematographer Bert Glennon comes up with a number of impressive artistic compositions, although the film's biggest treat is seeing Ben Johnson given the opportunity to show off his sly charm and easygoing demeanor.\n\nAugust 31, 2019\n\nThis may be the closest Ford ever got to making a musical.\n\nJune 22, 2017\n\nFord considered it among his personal favorites, and a handful of Ford's biggest admirers consider it a neglected masterpiece. (I do too.)\n\nJune 22, 2017\n\nWagon Master is a good outdoor action film, done in the best John Ford manner. That means careful character development and movement, spiced with high spots of action, good drama and leavening comedy moments\n\nJanuary 28, 2019\n\nIt's as gentle and warm a film as [John Ford] ever made and it follows a classic Ford theme: the creation of a community in the west...\n\nJune 21, 2017\n\n...a simple, straightforward film telling a simple, straightforward story, artistic in its design and execution and poetic in its telling.\n\nJune 21, 2017\n\none of Ford's masterworks, a sublime, crisp, unpretentious western that doesn't wear its mythos on its sleeve\n\nJune 21, 2017"
