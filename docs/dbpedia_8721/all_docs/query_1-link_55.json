        "text": "Robert Horton, a ruggedly handsome actor who found television stardom in 1957 as the scout Flint McCullough on “Wagon Train” but who resisted being typecast in westerns as he pursued a parallel career as a singer, died on Wednesday in Los Angeles. He was 91.\n\nHis death was confirmed by his niece, Joan Evans, who said that he was injured in a fall last November and had recently been placed in hospice care.\n\nMr. Horton recorded albums and sang at the London Palladium, but he was never entirely successful in shedding the frontiersman image. In his later years, he appeared at film-western events around the country.\n\nHe played Flint from the first episode of “Wagon Train,” in 1957, until the show moved from NBC to ABC in 1962. The series, inspired by the 1950 John Ford film “Wagon Master,” detailed the travails of people aboard a wagon train journeying from Missouri to California after the Civil War. Mr. Horton was the show’s heartthrob, often given occasions to remove his shirt.\n\nStarring with Mr. Horton was Ward Bond, who played the grizzled wagon master, Maj. Seth Adams. (Mr. Bond also appeared in the Ford film.)\n\nOnscreen the two had an almost father-son relationship, though they did not always appear together; episodes tended to feature one or the other in alternate weeks. But offscreen they often clashed. After one particularly fierce argument, the two men vowed not to appear together on camera again. (They did weeks later, however, when the script called for it.)\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
