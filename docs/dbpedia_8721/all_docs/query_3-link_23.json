No matter what your ambitions are in the film industry, itâs important that you understand the roles and responsibilities for everyone on a film set, who reports to whom and how departments coexist.\n\nAbove the Line and Below the Line\n\nFirst up, understanding the difference between âabove the lineâ vs âbelow the lineâ.
