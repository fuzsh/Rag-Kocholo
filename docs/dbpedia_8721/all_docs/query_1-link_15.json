        "text": "As I've written before, I don't watch westerns, but I just found a clip of Rango that shows the few minutes up to the above screencap. The surrounding area looks like Monument Valley, which is where John Ford is known to make his westerns. Feeling that Rango was looking to employ the well-known, I was concentrating on the John Ford/Monument Valley combination of films in IMDB. I found: Stagecoach, My Darling Clementine, Fort Apache, She Wore a Yellow Ribbon, Wagon Master, Rio Grande, The Searchers, Sergeant Rutledge and his last western, Cheyenne Autumn. Both Stagecoach and My Darling Clementine have IMDB images showing similar geography. the My Darling Clementine image shows Henry Fonda on a similar overlook. Also, one of many trailers for Rango seemed to concentrate on a shootout; My Darling Clementine is described as \"A Western retelling the tale of the Shoot-out at the OK Corral\". So, that's my new guess.\n\nFor some reason I keep being drawn to The Magnificent Seven - but I have a feeling it's a John Ford film as mentioned elsewhere.\n\nHere's a couple of '7' shots anyway.\n\nHmmm... Seem like you will have to be cautious as this reminds me of Mos Eisley Spaceport where you won't find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy:\n\nIn case you don't know, this is from Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope."
