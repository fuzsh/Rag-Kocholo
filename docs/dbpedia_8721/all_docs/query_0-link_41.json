        "text": "The Quiet Man, American romantic comedy film, released in 1952, that paid homage to director John Ford’s ancestral Ireland; the film was noted for its lush photography and memorable fight scene between its leading male characters.\n\nJohn Wayne portrayed ex-boxer Sean Thornton, Ford’s thinly disguised alter ego. After unintentionally killing an opponent during a bout, Thornton leaves the United States and returns to his birthplace in Ireland. There he romances the spirited Mary Kate Danaher (played by Maureen O’Hara) over the objections of her violent, overly possessive brother (Victor McLaglen). Tensions between the two men culminate in a lengthy brawl that traverses over hill and dale but ends with them becoming friends.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nBest Picture Movie Quote Quiz"
