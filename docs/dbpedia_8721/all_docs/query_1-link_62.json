        "text": "We are looking for pioneer spirits who are willing to put groups of like minded, adventurous folks together with the lust for life to move west, as far west as you can get from North America, and we will pay you in either a free land lot or in cash.\n\nYou might do this for yourself and new friends or be the wagon master for your own family and friends. People move in adventures together and someone has to lead the way. Maybe using your Facebook is the way to get a circle of wagons together?\n\nWe have some inviting land in paradise available in a residential community of waterfront “30 Pole” lots that are located right on the sea, (walk down to the water) facing the cool trade wind breezes, safely snuggled within the reef and island protected Vava’u Island Group of the benevolent Kingdom of Tonga.\n\nIt is here, as far west as you can go (without going east again) and as far away from the issues of uncertainty in our beloved homelands gone awry. Whether it be the concerns of economic upheaval, living well off of your retirement income, NSA and other privacy invasions, GMO proliferation of foods, unsavory healthcare issues, expiring freedom or chemical spraying, or the latest; radiation from Fukushima invading by air and by sea, (that alone should be the deciding factor) the best place to be today is in the southern hemisphere, in the unpolluted grand South Pacific on a large island where within reach are all your needs right there in place, waiting for you to see the light. You can be there tonight in one 12 hour flight.\n\nWe will leave the light on for you. There is so much ado, how can we know if it is all true?\n\nToday is no different than in the days of our past history where from Europe our ancestors with foresight and vision came, leading the way for their friends and family to follow. The concept of more freedom and opportunity kept breeding as the heirs of these original pioneers would seek even greener pastures, and greener they were for from New York to California or Montreal to Vancouver, proof of that popularity is right there in its overcrowded decay. Time to move on again because with popularity comes people and too many cause us to want to paint our wagons and go west.\n\nIt is not likely we will become overpopulated in the South Pacific, nor will we ever be wanting to move again and for a couple good reasons; one being so few actually get out here that there is little concern for over populating the place, yet just like in the movies we are enjoying life like the hero living happily ever after abundantly with feet in the soft sand here in paradise. The main reason people don’t move to this loveliest haven on earth is; most think the place to be on the other side of the moon. It is actually not. For those of us living here, we think it is too close to home after your 12 hour flight from LAX. Anyway, Tonga has limits on how many expats can reside with limiting laws about land tenure. We will never be the Maldives.\n\nThose looking for new lives and opportunity that moved to the west of North America seem to pile up there, with many knowing full well they would carry on, but something about water that people limited to driving cars can’t get over. I have seen them sitting behind the wheel, some sitting on the hood gazing across what appears to be the end of the world, dreaming about what it is like beyond the North Pacific Ocean before them, into the South Pacific Ocean on the other side.\n\nWell, we have planes now.\n\nI can tell you, first hand, for I sailed from the west coast of America to and through the South Pacific before ever flying over it. Sailing it proves there are two oceans and they are seriously divided by the equator and the doldrums, (no wind) caused by currents of wind and water that oppose each other, called the Coriolis Effect. A bit confusing at first but then, even the weather at the equator is confused. So you don’t want to live right on the equator - go a fair bit more south.\n\nWhat is happening there at that more real than imaginary border of 0 latitude is; the air and water currents from the northern hemisphere are sent back up north by the winds and currents of the southern hemisphere - each to their own hemisphere seems to be the rule there. Good thing too, for the northern hemisphere (called Nordstrom Hemorragesphere here) has got a lot of yucky stuff in there from where most of the world’s population, pollution and troubles are located. Again, to bring up Fukushima and what else might still be coming from that unknown malady, know that as far south as Japan seems to be to most, it is in the northern hemisphere, not the southern. And that radiating experience should be a head’s up for more of the same from over 400 other nuclear power promises never to fail located in the northern hemisphere. Nothing is forever, so with that absolute in mind, it is just a matter of time. Working out the odds on the potential for this trouble in the southern hemisphere, take note that there are only 4 nuclear power plants in the entire southern half of this worried world, two in South America and two in South Africa - none in the islands - phew!\n\nThe reasons to move out of the northern hemisphere, serious as they are, wilt to the reasons to move to the islands of paradise, wonderful as they are. Even in good times that move to paradise was a stupendous idea, and way before 9/11, the turning point in not only the US, but all over up there. It would take pages to describe what one has difficulty even finding words that can fully describe and explain the South Pacific experience. I will get into a little of what should get your wheels turning next.\n\nOpportunity is actually a big one, difficult as that is for most to see from afar. In Vava’u, just a few years ago the opportunity create the first Internet café, first boat hire, first rental car, first pizza bar, first development, first real estate and first business brokering are just some of the things we did. First scooter hire came along, first beach buggy rentals and first WIFI business, kayak rentals and tours and the list goes on, all happening within a three year period starting in 2002. The point I am making is; there is practically no end to what can be reinvented in a laid back water wonder world island group, like Vava’u.\n\nThere is a new 100 plus lot residential development in Vava’u that will create even more opportunity. Consider the home building needs, the boat building, repair business, medical clinic (the building is already there, just need a good Doc or nurse), retail store, restaurant, pizza and surf kite flying. Vava’u is small and that makes you and your ideas big. If you have an idea for business, like a bar on the beach in the lagoon where the Governor’s private project, Cocomo Village, is located, just ask him about how to go about that. You will be amazed at the help and consideration you will receive when coming up with new business in Vava’u, where the new slogan is \"Prosperity for Vava’u.\"\n\nIn the early days of settling the “Old West” wagon masters were a big deal. They put it together and got people through the perils of crossing wild and rough lands in order to get to a new world, a new free life and new opportunity, and these early pioneers risked their lives for this. Today, it is the other way around, wagon masters get today’s pioneers out of peril into a freer and safer new life in an old world, actually. The wagon master today shows people a way to live like a king on a shoestring in Vava’u Tonga. In every family there has to be a pioneer, the front person, the scout who signs on with the wagon master and sets out to report back and make way for the rest of the family to join in. Some people have taken multiple lots in order to prepare for family and friends who are into living life together - living, being a keyword here.\n\nAll a wagon master has to do is to explain the benefits, investment wise for some, (as prices go up) escaping the perils of not moving west and see to it that they secure their piece of heaven in Vava’u at Cocomo Village. Five of them signing on gets you a free lot for yourself or $5000 in cash. Today’s wagon master doesn’t even have to move from their seat at home and, actually, neither do the folks signing on to go west have to leave their living rooms, not until they are ready. The whole thing can come together via email, Internet and Tongan government involvement.\n\nNeed help putting a wagon train together off to the South Pacific? We can make that happen with a lot of sound logic and reason, and indisputable reference letters, from the Royal Family and the Minister of Police and Minister of Tourism and Environment, each validating Cocomo Village. Try to top that due diligence in any investment.\n\nHow people can live better in Cocomo is another whole book. We can get fully into that in a private email where you will learn about getting folks into their own wagon train to the South Pacific. Some people are paying more for property tax than it costs to live in Tonga, where there is no property tax. You will be able to show people how they can live very well off of even the most meagre retirement. Safety, freedom and good like minded camaraderie are part of the appeal, not to mention the obvious and a bit overwhelming (at first) ambiance, the colors, the sunsets, the views of blue skies and sea and green islands galore all about, coconut palms on white sandy beaches, most uninhabited and forever wild. Yours to visit, picnic and treasure while owning your own home in Cocomo, a community sanctioned and cared for by the Governor of Vava’u, your best friend in Vava’u. Honorable Fulivai cherishes his Cocomo Village people.\n\nSo many are predicting more unsavory events in the northern hemisphere, and soon, which just validates the wise concept of having a lifeboat in paradise. $6,000 is not a lot of money for what might be the most important investment, perhaps life-saving, that any of us ever made. We can watch what happens from a distance, like how we watch fireworks safely from outside where they are blowing them off.\n\nHeck, even if the northern hemisphere had no issues, the southern hemisphere’s South Pacific is the place to live safe, free, easy and luxuriously."
