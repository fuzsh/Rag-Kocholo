        "text": "I would have liked to write a deep, thoughtful review or essay of some kind for Legends of Western Cinema Week—but no matter how hard I tried to think of something to write, all my brain would say was, “I got nothing, pal.” But I hated the idea of missing out on the event altogether, so I decided to contribute a post on one of the things that drew me to Westerns in the first place: horses. In this case, one horse, a particularly beautiful one who is always a joy to see gallop across the screen.\n\nHis name was Steel. A burnished chestnut with three white feet, a wide blaze, and a luxuriant mane and tail, his proud arched neck and graceful, fluid way of moving stand out among the many handsome horses that have appeared on a movie screen. According to IMDB, Steel was so prized as a mount that his owner, Clarence “Fat” Jones, was able to make it a condition that all the horses in a film had to be rented from the Jones stables if Steel was used in the movie.\n\nLike some human actors, Steel paid his dues in B-Westerns. At the bottom of this page you can see several photos of him with the stars of B-grade Westerns in the mid-to-late 1940s, including Tim Holt and a young Robert Mitchum. But at the same time, Steel was already carrying A-listers too. In 1944 John Wayne rode him in Tall in the Saddle—pretty nice mount for a drifter new in town!\n\nIn 1948, Steel appears to beautiful advantage as Joel McCrea’s mount in that time-bending chase scene from Four Faces West (again, the fugitive drifter sure scored a nice horse somehow).\n\nIn Yellow Sky (1948), it’s Steel who carries Gregory Peck across the desert—looking a bit less elegant than usual, as does everybody else in the movie.\n\nBut what most Western fans probably remember him best for is his teaming with Ben Johnson, one of the finest riders in the movies (and also “Fat” Jones’ son-in-law). Steel’s grace and Johnson’s horsemanship made an unforgettable combination in She Wore a Yellow Ribbon (1949), Wagon Master (1950), pictured above, and Rio Grande (1950). (I’ve also read that Johnson rode Steel when he won his roping championship, but couldn’t find a picture or record to confirm that on a quick search.)\n\nIn Rio Grande, Steel is the subject of an amusing plot gaffe. Johnson’s character is supposed to abscond with his commanding officer’s horse—played by Steel—but John Wayne’s Colonel Yorke rides an entirely different horse throughout the whole movie, both before and after the theft: a powerful bay horse with a narrow stripe down his face, named Banner. Well, perhaps Steel was the colonel’s best horse, kept for Sundays and holidays.\n\n(You can spot John Wayne riding Banner in Red River (1948) as well—and he was also sturdy enough to carry the substantial Andy Devine in Under California Stars (1948). I think he may have been Henry Fonda’s mount in Fort Apache (1948) as well. Banner had a busy ’48!)\n\nSteel was valuable enough to have his own stunt double. The hardest-riding chase scenes in Rio Grande and She Wore a Yellow Ribbon were doubled by another horse called Bingo—but in the above shot ’tis clearly the horse himself, in Oscar-winning Technicolor.\n\nMore Steel in color—ridden by Henry Fonda in Warlock (1959) and Richard Widmark in Broken Lance (1953). These screenshots don’t even really do him justice, though; you have to see him in motion to appreciate what a beautiful horse he was.\n\nSteel with Clark Gable on the set of Across the Wide Missouri (1951). I don’t know how many times he appeared onscreen in total—I know Randolph Scott rode him too, but am not sure in which movie(s). If you know of one I’ve overlooked, comment below and tell me!\n\nAnd now, a giveaway!\n\nI’m giving away ebook copies of my two Western short story collections: Wanderlust Creek and Other Stories and Outlaw Fever: Five Western Stories. Leave a comment on this post specifying which one you’d like to enter for—one winner will be chosen for each title!"
