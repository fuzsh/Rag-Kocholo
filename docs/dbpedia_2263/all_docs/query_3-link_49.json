        "text": "This truly is a story of an innovator who powered future industry!\n\nDr Brian O’Brien was an Australian physicist whose career in space science began in the 1960s designing and launching satellites into space to measure auroras. He also pioneered the study of lunar dust during the Apollo missions, his experiments even ran on the moon! Be inspired and amazed hearing not only about Brian O'Brien's amazing scientific knowledge, but his passion for his scientific endeavours and ever-changing career that spanned 60 years in science.\n\nEvery object tells a story, so join Josh Kalmund, Assistant Curator in the History Department at WAM, as he talks us through Brian O'Brien's amazing contributions to science through objects such as satellite models, scientific experiments, an astronaut training manual, lunar dust simulant, and reels of magnetic tape containing data from his experiments on the moon.\n\nImage Courtesy of State Library of Western Australia.\n\nWatch the video here:\n\nFollow-up Activity Suggestions\n\nLooking for an activity to do after watching this talk with your students?
