        "text": "The Irish rugby community has paid its respects after Munster and Shannon RFC legend Brian O’Brien had died at the age of 83.\n\nThe former player and coach, who enjoyed a long association with the province and the club, was the man who introduced ‘Stand Up and Fight’ as Munster’s official anthem over 20 years ago.\n\nAfter featuring in his first Munster Senior Cup final in 1959, O’Brien spent the next 15 years playing for Shannon’s senior side.\n\nIn 1968, he became the club’s first-ever international player after making his first appearance with Ireland.\n\nAfter hanging up his boots, the former centre then coach Shannon to Munster titles in 1977 and 1978.\n\nHe also served as a selector and served on the IRFU committee and was part of the selection team for the 1983 British and Irish Lions tour to New Zealand.\n\nO’Brien would go on to serve as the manager of the Ireland under-21 side as well as the Shannon side that won All-Ireland League four times in a row in the 1990s.\n\nFrom there, the Shannon legend became manager with the Munster senior team as well as the Ireland international side.\n\nSpeaking about the rugby icon’s passing, Munster’s president Ger McNamara said: ‘It is with great sadness that I pass on condolences to Brian’s wife Olive, and children Siobhan, Brendan, Aidan, Ronan, Padraic, Maura and the wider O’Brien family, on behalf of everyone in Munster Rugby.’\n\n‘Briano’s love of the game was forged from his playing days with Shannon RFC, with his ongoing commitment to the game seen across his coaching and management roles with club, province and beyond.\n\n‘His legacy will live long in the history of Munster Rugby, may he rest in peace.’\n\nShannon RFC added: ‘With the passing of Brian O’Brien, rugby has lost one of the pillars of our game.\n\n‘Brian was a force of nature and left a lasting impression on all who encountered him. Shannon RFC, Munster, and Ireland has not alone lost a stalwart player, coach, manager, administrator, and mentor but also an inspirational leader.’"
