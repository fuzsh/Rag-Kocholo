        "text": "Hugh O’Brian, who rose to fame on television as the quick-drawing lawman Wyatt Earp in the 1950s and who later devoted extensive time to a foundation he created that trains young people to be leaders, died on Monday at his home in Beverly Hills, Calif. He was 91.\n\nHis death was announced by his foundation, HOBY, originally known as Hugh O’Brian Youth Leadership.\n\nWhen he first arrived in Hollywood in 1947, Mr. O’Brian was a strapping 6-foot-plus presence with leading-man looks and a swagger he had picked up in the Marine Corps. He did not have stardom in mind, though: He was planning to return to college and eventually attend law school.\n\nHe broke into show business by chance, when he escorted an actress to a rehearsal for a play and ended up with a part for himself, filling in for an actor who had fallen ill.\n\nThe actress Ida Lupino, who was just beginning her career as a director, cast him in her 1949 feature film, “Never Fear.” A contract with Universal-International Pictures soon followed.\n\nEarly on Mr. O’Brian was relegated mostly to secondary status in run-of-the-mill westerns — with Gene Autry in “Beyond the Purple Hills” (1950), Audie Murphy in “The Cimarron Kid” (1952) and Rock Hudson (to whom Mr. O’Brian was frequently compared) in “Seminole” (1953).\n\nHe emerged from this relative obscurity when he landed the title role on “The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp.” The show, which ran on ABC from 1955 to 1961, became one of the most popular TV westerns at a time when that genre dominated prime time.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
