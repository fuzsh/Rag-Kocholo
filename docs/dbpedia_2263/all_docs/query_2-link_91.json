        "text": "Notorious rape beast Patrick O’Brien has died, we can reveal.\n\nEvil child rapist O’Brien (84) died in a Co Kildare nursing home, four years after his release from prison for the systematic rape and abuse of his daughter Fiona Doyle.\n\nSpeaking to the Irish Mirror, brave advocate and survivor Fiona revealed rapist father had died and described it as “the end of a nightmare.”\n\nREAD MORE: Child rape survivor Fiona Doyle forgives seriously ill convict dad on his death bed\n\n“My father died today. It’s a hard chapter for me and my siblings. It’s the end of a nightmare. He was my Dad and hard as it seems to people, I loved him. I just wish it was normal and we could grieve normal. It’s a battle in my head.\"\n\nO’Brien is set to have a private funeral - though Fiona hopes she will be able to attend, having previously told how seeing him go into the ground would be the final closure that she needs.\n\nHis death comes a month on from when Fiona exclusively told the Irish Mirror how she visited him in the nursing home one last time - as he lay on his deathbed.\n\n“He agreed to me sitting with him. And he did apologise. He said I’m very sorry for everything,” she revealed at the time.\n\nFiona said her father’s words were important to her - and provided a kind of closure she had been seeking.\n\nBray native O’Brien was initially sentenced to 12 years in prison for his admitted rape and abuse of Fiona, with nine years suspended. That was later altered, with an additional three years added on in an appeal.\n\nO’Brien’s abuse of Fiona started the night before her First Holy Communion and went on for a decade, with him sexually abusing her in a cemetery, the beach and on family holidays.\n\nDuring the campaign of horrific abuse O'Brien waged against his daughter, he would regularly take her to Deansgrange, where he would clean his parents' grave before taking her up to a tree near the plot and raping her.\n\nConfronted by the Irish Mirror on his release from prison in 2019, O’Brien insisted he wasn’t a monster. “I’m not a monster. I hate that word.”\n\nBut when asked what he’d call anyone else he read about that had raped their daughter he said: “Well I’d call him a right old bastard. I’d say he’s a right f***ing bastard doing that, which yes, you can call me that. But not a monster.”\n\nIn a bizarre and lengthy confrontation, O’Brien claimed to us that he was “very sorry” for abusing his daughter - but refused to admit that he raped her.\n\n“No it was not rape. Well sexual assault yeah, I’ll admit that. But I never raped her. Never.”"
