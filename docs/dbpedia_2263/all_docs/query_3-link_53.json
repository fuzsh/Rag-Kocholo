        "text": "Like elsewhere around the world, the naming conventions of Gaelic Ireland were patronymic. Children and descendants got their last name from the first name of their father or paternal ancestor, which eventually developed into last names as we know them today.\n\nThe name O'Brien and its spelling variants O'Brian, O'Brine, and O'Bryan are all Anglicizations of the old noble Irish last name Ó Briain. It's an example of the patronymic system, with the prefix 'Ó' denoting a descendant of an ancestor named Brian.\n\nThe ancestor in question was Brian Boru, who reigned as High King of Ireland from 1002 until his death at the Battle of Clontarf in Dublin in 1014. Brian was born in what is now Co Clare and later became the King of Munster.\n\nRead more: Murphy: Origin and meaning behind the most common Irish last name\n\nRead more: How Smiths and McGowans may share the same Irish heritage\n\nThe clan name is therefore primarily associated with the province, but is found all throughout Ireland and its diaspora communities today.\n\nThe meaning of the given name Brian is unclear, but it may have come from an old Celtic word meaning high or noble. Some say it comes from the Irish word brí, meaning strength.\n\nFamous people with the last name include Oscar winner Edmond O'Brien, Teen Wolf actor Dylan O'Brien, former politician and NBA commissioner Larry O'Brien (for whom the NBA championship trophy is named), journalist and broadcaster Soledad O'Brien, and of course, comedian and talk show host Conan O'Brien.\n\nConan often discusses his Irish Catholic heritage, having been raised in an Irish American household in Brookline, Massachusetts. The comedian once revealed his ancestors on both sides of his family began emigrating to the US in the 1850s, likely as a result of the Irish Famine.\n\nHe has long claimed that his Irish Catholic ancestors only married other Irish Catholics, and that his ancestry was thereby 100 per cent Irish Catholic. This was later confirmed by taking a DNA test, the results of which he says stunned his doctor who had \"never seen 100 percent anything\".\n\n\"Both of my parents are very Irish Catholic,\" he told the Irish podcast Second Captains earlier this year, adding that his upbringing consisted of \"lots of church, lots of religious instruction, lots of guilt, and lots of repression\".\n\n\"My mother's side came from the Cork area, my father's family came from Dungarvan. They came to central Massachusetts to take up farming. Irish married Irish.\n\n\"I was the first one to deviate - I love to say that I got jungle fever and married a woman who is Irish but also has some Welsh and Scottish. I'm the one who went crazy and dabbled in the dark arts,\" he joked."
