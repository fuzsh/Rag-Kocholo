        "text": "Founder, Robert Metcalf, began his career as a funeral director with Roper & Sons before opening Metcalf Funeral Home in 1961. Metcalf served the Lincoln community as a privately-held family business until 1992 when it sold to a chain. Then in early 2004, Metcalf Funeral Home returned to local ownership when it became part of the Roper & Sons family â€“ merging two of the most trusted and long-lasting names in the Lincoln funeral home community.\n\nMetcalf Funeral Home is here for you in service, and as friends and neighbors, located on 27th and P Streets in Lincoln, Nebraska"
