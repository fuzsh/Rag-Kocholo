        "text": "Brian (born 941, near Killaloe, Ireland—died April 23, 1014, Clontarf, near Dublin) was the high king of Ireland from 1002 to 1014. His fame was so great that the princes descended from him, the O’Briens, subsequently ranked as one of the chief dynastic families of the country.\n\nIn 976 Brian became king of a small state, later called Dál Cais, and also king of Munster, whose Eóghanachta rulers had been defeated (964) by Brian’s half brother. Brian destroyed first the Eóghanachta septs and then the Northmen, constructing a fleet to drive them from the Shannon. Under his rule Munster became a unified and powerful state. He invaded Ossory (983), won control of the southern half of Ireland from the high king Maelsechlainn II (997), replaced him as high king (1002), and in due course received the submission of every lesser ruler.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nKings and Emperors (Part III) Quiz"
