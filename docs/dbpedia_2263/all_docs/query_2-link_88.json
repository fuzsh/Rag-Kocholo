        "text": "The Irish American community has been left saddened after the passing of Brian O’Donovan, who leaves behind a remarkable legacy as a prominent figure in the media world and the Irish community.\n\nBrian was the longtime host of GBH’s radio show A Celtic Sojourn, which has been running since 1986. It explored \"traditional and contemporary music from around the Celtic world, connecting emerging artists to their deep musical roots.\"\n\nThrough this, Brian became a familiar voice in the Irish American community. Born and raised in Clonakilty, West Cork, he traveled to Boston in 1980 and stayed in touch with his Irish roots by connecting with people through traditional music.\n\nRead more: Former politician honored with award named after 'Irish visa hero' for work serving Irish Americans\n\nHe was involved in organizing many festivals and events and became general manager of what is now known as Gillette Stadium, in 1987. Brian was also involved in securing the United States’ 1994 World Cup bid.\n\nHe once said in an interview: “While I was leading events management at Gillette Stadium, people would often say to me ‘There’s a guy on radio who has your same name.' They couldn’t reconcile the two worlds: professional sports and an esoteric sub-stream music genre program on public broadcast.”\n\nWhile collecting a number of incredible career accolades, Brian managed to keep his passion for music and Irish culture at the heart of each endeavor. He took on the role of Executive Director of the Irish Cultural Center of Boston, to foster his passion for Irish culture and arts.\n\nIn September, 2022, O'Donovan announced his diagnosis of terminal brain cancer. This past September 2023, he released an official public statement, telling his supporters that he would be canceling the beloved Celtic Sojourn ‘Live shows’ which take place at Christmas time.\n\nHe said: “It has been a joy to work with so many wonderfully creative people over the years, uniting musicians from various traditions in celebration of the holidays and our shared humanity. Together, we traveled back through time, rediscovering ancient traditions, celebrating with carols, and experiencing the warmth of Celtic hospitality.”\n\nRead more: Tributes paid to Joe F Leary Jr after death of pillar of Irish community in Boston\n\nHe said in an interview with Commonwealth Magazine, that he had been finding new peace in reading poetry and referenced a line from one of Seamus Heaney’s poems: “Walk on air against your better judgment.”\n\nBrian said: “I’m saying this to all of the audience out there, do what you do and do it best and do it with a hunger and a desire for it, because you never know what’s coming down the road. And that’s certainly true in my case. But I’m going to walk on air. Maybe against my better judgment, but to heck with it. I’m still going to walk on air.”\n\nBrian is survived by his wife, Lindsay O’Donovan, his four grown children: Aoife, Ciaran, Aidan, and Nuala and two grandchildren, Ivy Jo Jacobsen and Nomi Francis O'Donovan"
