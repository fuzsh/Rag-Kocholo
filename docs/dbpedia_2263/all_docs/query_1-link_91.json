        "text": "Very sad news this Saturday evening: The Penn State freshman struck by a vehicle during a jogging accident has passed away, according to the Centre Daily Times.\n\nAccording to the paper, Eva O’Brian died peacefully and was surrounded by family and friends. She had severe injuries to the brain and pelvic region following the accident. The Berwyn native had been enrolled in Penn State’s summer session and was in the College of Health and Human Development.\n\nO’Brian, 18, was struck by the vehicle on July 3 at the intersection of Park Avenue and Atherton Street, and was flown to a trauma center. She was crossing the busy intersection in between the golf course and the Nittany Lion Inn when a Ford F250 traveling south hit her. The driver of the truck was not at fault.\n\nOur thoughts and prayers are with the the family and friends of O’Brian tonight."
