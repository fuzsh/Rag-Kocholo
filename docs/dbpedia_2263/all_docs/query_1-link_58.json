        "text": "Tayra Nicole Powell was born on July 15, 1978 to Robert and Sandra (Dubb) Powell in Mayville, ND. As a child she lived in North Dakota and Wyoming before moving to Colorado Springs, CO. This is where she went to school and attended the Air Academy High School graduating in the Class of 1996. This is where she became a social butterfly and enjoyed throughout her lifetime being around her friends and people. Tayra’s beautiful smile and fun personality drew people to her like a magnet.\n\nIn her teenage years, Tayra met Dennis O’Brien and began their family together. This adventure would have them move to Comstock, MN. Eventually they would tie the knot on December 27, 2002 and continue raising their boys together. Also during this time, she would attend Aaker’s Business College and get a two year degree in accounting.\n\nThroughout her lifetime she had a few jobs including working at Dominos Pizza as a teenager, as a server at Denny’s, Space Aliens, the church secretary for the Comstock Lutheran, office staff at Tharaldson’s, and for the past 12 years at VTC (Fargo Vocational Training Center) working in administration and as the office manager.\n\nTayra’s greatest pride and joy throughout her lifetime has been her three sons. She was able to be a stay-at-home mom with them while they were in their younger years. As the boys grew older, she was so proud of them in many ways including always being in the bleachers cheering for them. She had a beautiful bond with her Grandma Florence and always reminded her cousins that she was Grandma’s favorite.\n\nShe is survived by her husband Dennis O'Brien of Comstock, MN, three sons: Anthony O’Brien, Adrian O’Brien, Asher O’Brien, her dad, Bob Powell, her mother and stepfather Sandra (Jody) Adams, one sister Nari (Jerry) Adams, niece Emma Adams, and nephews Elijah and Elliot Adams, and aunts, uncles, cousins, mother-in-law Birgitt Wilson, brother in law Martin (Tabatha) O'Brien, and sister in law Patricia O'Brien, nephew Tyler O'Brien, niece Ashlin O'Brien, and near and dear friends.\n\nTayra O’Brien, age 45, of Comstock, MN died in Sanford Hospital on Monday, April 8, 2024.\n\nMemorial services will be 10:30 AM, Saturday, April 13, 2024 at Comstock Lutheran Church in Comstock, MN with Rev. Jill Steichen officiating. Visitation will begin one hour prior to the service on Saturday."
