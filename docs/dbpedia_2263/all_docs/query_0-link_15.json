        "text": "To view the service for Robert (Bob) Cecil Cole on Friday, May 3, 2024 at 2 p.m. please click the following link to watch through St. Thomas’ Facebook page:\n\nFuneral Service for the Late Robert (Bob) Cecil Cole\n\nRobert (Bob) Cecil Cole died peacefully in St. John’s on April 24 after a long, adventurous and passionate life. When asked by the caring staff at St. Clare’s hospital what was most important to him at the end, he ignored the medical nature of the question and pointed to his children, who will miss him beyond words: Christian, Hilary, Megan and Robbie. He outlived many who loved him: his parents Florence (Voisey) and John Cole, brothers Cecil, Kitchener and Edgar Wiseman, and his sisters Helen Noseworthy, Olive Andrews, Lulu Ringman, and Elinor Curran.\n\nOf all the roles he played – pilot, athlete, radio DJ, proud Feildian, news anchor, fish processor, Hockey Hall of Famer, Brier Skip, Member of the Order of Canada, and play-by-play announcer who brought unparalleled thrill and excitement to millions of hockey fans for over 50 years – it is perhaps the role of Granddaddy that brought him the most joy. A tough exterior was nowhere to be found as he sang his favourite goodnight song at the end of Facetimes and visits with Gabby, Sam, Bobby (Robert Cole III), Lucas and Lulu.\n\nHis incredibly charmed and colourful life, which included calling historical Canadian moments like the 2002 Olympic gold medal game and the ’72 Summit Series, throwing a ball to legendary Portuguese footballer Eusebio for a bit of keepie-uppie, and shaking hands with the Dalai Lama, continued that way through his 90th birthday. The milestone coincided with a local airshow by his beloved Canadian Snowbirds. Annoyed he wouldn’t be able to ride shotgun again, he settled for a remarkable rendition of Happy Birthday, sung into his headset by the pilots (in perfect unison of course) as they approached in formation over Conception Bay.\n\nAnyone who knew him well was struck by his unwavering passion for the things he cared about, a list of which is varied and unique: salmon fishing, Broadway musicals, dogs, the Church Lads Brigade Regimental Band, Newfoundland, rowing, the New York Yankees, World War II, flying…. His appreciation for sound and his vivid storytelling ability could bring anyone listening right into a moment: ice floes hitting a ferry’s bow in springtime, Frank Sinatra’s diction and impeccable breathing control, or a marching band with perfect timing.\n\nAlong with hockey fans from coast to coast, he will be dearly missed for his undeniable uniqueness by those who knew him best: his former wife Karen, with whom he raised his four favourite people, his children’s partners – Fred, Matt and Jennine, his many nieces and nephews, the NHL players, coaches and referees, whose friendships he held dear and for whom he had the utmost respect and admiration, his colleagues at Hockey Night in Canada, and his dear friends Pat Gallivan, Noboru “Ishi” Ishiwata and Bill Ryan (whose friendship with him spanned 87 years). His family is grateful for the support of healthcare staff who cared for him at the end of his life, and to his good friend Julie Dobbin for brightening so many of his most recent days."
