        "text": "FORMER Munster Rugby manager and rugby stalwart Brian O'Brien has passed away at the age of 83.\n\nMr O'Brien played an integral role across the Munster and Irish rugby landscape as a former player, selector, coach and manager.\n\nThe centre playd in Shannon’s first ever Munster Senior Cup Final in 1959 and following provincial representation went on to become the club’s first ever international player, winning his first cap in 1968.\n\n‘Briano’ spent almost 15 years playing with Shannon’s senior team, and following his retirement from playing, coached Shannon to Munster Senior Cup titles in 1977 and 1978.\n\nServing on the IRFU Senior Selection Committee, he was also part of the 1983 British and Irish Lion’s selection committee.\n\nManager of the Irish U21 team and the Shannon team that won the four in a row, he went onto become Team Manager of the Munster men’s team before being appointed Manager of the Irish Men’s National side in 2000.\n\nAs a Munster selector and team manager, Mr O’Brien’s further impact on the province came by way of introducing his “Stand Up and Fight” party piece, with the song becoming a Munster Rugby anthem for over 20 years.\n\nHe was inducted into the Munster Rugby Hall of Fame in 2014.\n\nMick Moylett, President of Shannon RFC paid tribute to Mr O'Brien and commended everything he did for rugby.\n\n\"He was involved in Shannon for over 60 years. He was a huge influence on everyone in the club and everyone he came into contact with, with his infectious, courageous determination.\n\n\"He made our sport all the better by way of his total involvement. He was always involved in the club even when he was manager at Munster.\n\n\"In 1999, he was involved in a Munster v Ulster game. After the game, Stand Up and Fight got its first airing from Brian. The dressing room was too warm so they stood outside in a circle and Brian gave his first rendition of that song.\n\n\"He gave completely to the game. You couldn't wish to meet better. He was a tremendous person, the best. One of a kind\".\n\nMunster Rugby President Ger McNamara offered his condolences on behalf of the province, \"It is with great sadness that I pass on condolences to Brian’s wife Olive, and children Siobhan, Brendan, Aidan, Ronan, Padraic, Maura and the wider O’Brien family, on behalf of everyone in Munster Rugby.\n\n\"Briano’s love of the game was forged from his playing days with Shannon RFC, with his ongoing commitment to the game seen across his coaching and management roles with club, province and beyond. His legacy will live long in the history of Munster Rugby, may he rest in peace.\""
