        "text": "Playing an integral role across the Munster and Irish rugby landscape O’Brien is a former player, selector, coach and manager.\n\nThe centre played in Shannon’s first ever Munster Senior Cup Final in 1959 and following provincial representation went on to become the club’s first ever international player, winning his first cap in 1968.\n\n‘Briano’ spent almost 15 years playing with Shannon’s senior team, and following his retirement from playing, coached Shannon to Munster Senior Cup titles in 1977 and 1978.\n\nServing on the IRFU Senior Selection Committee, he was also part of the 1983 British and Irish Lion’s selection committee.\n\nManager of the Irish U21 team and the Shannon team that won the four in a row, he went onto become Team Manager of the Munster men’s team before being appointed Manager of the Ireland Men’s Team in 2000.\n\nAs a Munster selector and team manager, O’Brien’s further impact on the province came by way of introducing his “Stand Up and Fight” party piece, with the song becoming a Munster Rugby anthem for over 20 years.\n\nHe was inducted into the Munster Rugby Hall of Fame in 2014.\n\nMunster Rugby President Ger McNamara offered his condolences on behalf of the province, “It is with great sadness that I pass on condolences to Brian’s wife Olive, and children Siobhan, Brendan, Aidan, Ronan, Padraic, Maura and the wider O’Brien family, on behalf of everyone in Munster Rugby.\n\n“Briano’s love of the game was forged from his playing days with Shannon RFC, with his ongoing commitment to the game seen across his coaching and management roles with club, province and beyond. His legacy will live long in the history of Munster Rugby, may he rest in peace.”\n\nFair to say Briano’s memory will forever live in the hearts and minds of supporters across the province with the final words best said by song,\n\n“Thanks a lot, I’m sure glad to be –\n\n“To be where I can see,\n\n“So many friends of mine.\n\n…….\n\n“Until you hear the bell,\n\n“Stand up and fight,\n\n“Stand up and fight like hell.”"
