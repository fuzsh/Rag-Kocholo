        "text": "This is the first musical ever to be performed in an outdoor theatre at the Utah Shakespeare Festival. It will preview June 21 and open June 24 in the Engelstad Shakespeare Theatre.\n\nSweeney Toddâs character originated in âThe String of Pearls,â a story published serially in a weekly magazine during the winter of 1846â47. In this story, Sweeney and Mrs. Lovett were at first just thievesâand later became grisly business partners. In that story, they were simply motivated by greed, not revengeâwhich is now the primary theme of the musical.\n\nThe story went through many incarnations before Christopher Bond turned it into a play (without music) in 1973. Stephen Sondheim first conceived of a musical version that same year, after he went to see Bondâs take on the story at Theater Royal Stratford East.\n\nThe musical version, Sweeney Todd: the Demon Barber of Fleet Street, has been around for over four decades and has been adapted into five feature films between 1926 and 2007.\n\nIn one of these films, Johnny Depp was cast as Sweeney Todd in Tim Burtonâs adaptation before anyone even had heard him sing.\n\nA very difficult feat musically, 80 percent of the production is traditionally sung while only 20 percent is spoken dialogue.\n\nIn the original production, Angela Lansbury played the role of Mrs. Lovett. She won a Tony Award for her performance.\n\nThe idea of the cannibalistic pastryâ the meat piesâ may sound familiar. This idea appeared around 1594 in Shakespeareâs Titus Andronicus, as well as in Charles Dickensâs novels The Pickwick Papers (1836â37) and Martin Chuzzlewit (1844).\n\nThere is a common misconception that the original story was based on fact. We are happy to note that Sweeney Todd is not based on a true story! This may put your mind at ease when you enjoy your next meat pie.\n\nCommonly mistaken to be set in the Victorian Era in which it was first published, Sweeney Toddâs setting is actually earlier, 1785. This would put it in the Georgian Era."
