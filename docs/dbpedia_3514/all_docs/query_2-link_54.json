        "text": "Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street\n\nFinally the trailer is available. I've been excited about this show for a few months now. They have a big cardboard display at the local theater. I have been interested since I noticed who all was involved in the project. Helena Bonham Carter, Johnny Depp and Tim Burton collaborate once again.\n\nA man (Johnny Depp) is unjustly banished and loses everything in the process. The man comes back with a new identity (Sweeney Todd) and proceeds to take revenge. He blends into the town as a barber, and proceeds to kill those that show up for haircuts. Helena Bonham Carter portrays Mrs. Lovett...his partner in crime. A woman that bakes mincemeat pies using the remains of the victims. Obviously, I feel this is the perfect type of script for Tim Burton. I'm expecting the movie to be a musical, but I can't verify that or anything.\n\nHere's the trailer:[YOUTUBE]http://youtube.com/watch?v=GrX4SRvxqSM[/YOUTUBE]\n\nI just watched the trailer (I couldn't load it yesterday ._.) and uhhh . . .\n\nis it just me, or is Johnny Depp's bursting out in song kind of funny?\n\nActually, I found it rather hilarious There's no telling how I'd cope with it at the cinema :rofl\n\nI just watched the trailer (I couldn't load it yesterday ._.) and uhhh . . .\n\nis it just me, or is Johnny Depp's bursting out in song kind of funny?\n\nActually, I found it rather hilarious There's no telling how I'd cope with it at the cinema :rofl\n\nWell it is based on a Broadway musical.\n\nYeah, looks to be good.\n\nI'm glad Tim Burton is making this, the story of Sweeney Todd is a really cool story in England. It's a bit like Sherlock Holmes because it's part of the culture, set in the 19th Century England and Americans think it's true.\n\nGlad he's going to introduce it to mainstream worldwide.\n\nIt just feels so weird him being thin. It makes sense because he's been in prison for 10 years or whatever. But it's just the idea of a pie maker always comes off as being with a big belly. Even if the pies have people in them.\n\ni just made this thread mf\n\nDude, it was a complete cooincidence that I had bumped this thread, I had looked it up without seeing yours.\n\nThough this is older thus has precedence and yours needs to be merged"
