        "text": "‘You have a beautiful throat for a razor, sir. Beautiful!’\n\nBarber Sweeney Todd augments his business income by murdering customers who visit his shop and lifting their valuables. He’s also insinuated himself into the life of a local shipping magnate in the hopes of possessing the man’s beautiful daughter…\n\nBoo! Hiss! Arch-villain Tod Slaughter returns to strut his stuff across the silver screen again; this time as the world’s most famous practitioner of the ‘close shave’. After the success of ‘Maria Marten, or The Murder in the Red Barn’ (1935), there were no prizes for guessing the next stop on the cinematic journey of Slaughter and producer-director George King. The actor was already closely associated with the role, having played it successfully on the stage, and King assembled much of the same cast and crew who had done duty in the Red Barn to support his efforts here.\n\nSweeney Todd certainly is a cunning knave. Rather than spend his days waiting for customers in his Fleet Street barbershop, he’s out drumming up business at the docks, waiting for the sailors to come in. Now, this may seem like a business plan more suited to a very different profession, but you can’t argue with the logic of it or the results. Sailors coming home from a long voyage need a bit of a spruce up before they go and see their sweethearts, and often their pockets are filled either with either wages or the prizes from their trip. So what could be better than getting ‘polished off’ by an expert with the razor?\n\nUnfortunately, Sweeney’s customer care policies need some work, and clients often end up on the basement floor via his revolving barber chair. A quick final ‘polish’ later and they’re not likely to have any worries again. Ever. The bodies are collected by Mrs Lovatt (Stella Rho), who drags them into her pie shop next door via a secret door that connects the two premises. What happens to them and why she wants them in the first place, who can tell?\n\nBut jewels and money aren’t all that’ are on Slaughter’s mind. He’s also set his sights on the innocent Johanna (Eve Lister), daughter of local ship owner Stephen Oakley (D J Williams). To that end, he’s been helping to finance Williams’ pet project: the building of an expensive new trading vessel. It’s no surprise when some financial shenanigans give him the whip hand over the trusting old businessman, and an opportunity for blackmaill, with Lister as the price to be paid.\n\nEverything seems to be going smoothly for our wicked leading man, but there are still some problems to overcome. For a start, Rho isn’t going to stand for Slaughter’s interest in Lister, and, to make matters worse, the silly girl’s in love with handsome (acting) ship’s captain Mark Ingerstreet (Bruce Seton). That makes him a prime candidate for a bit of ‘polishing off’ of course, but what do about young apprentice Tobias (Johnny Singer) who may have seen a little more than he should? Slaughter’s already been through seven apprentices in as many weeks, and although the local Beadle doesn’t seem all that suspicious(!) another ‘runaway’ might be cause for comment!\n\nAlthough some commentators have tried to make a case for the story of Sweeney Todd being based on real events, the earliest confirmed source is an anonymous ‘penny dreadful’ called ‘The String of Pearls: A Romance’ which was published in 1846. A year later, this was performed on stage as ‘The String of Pearls, or The Fiend of Fleet Street’; the story dramatised by George Dibdin Pitt. The play was a massive hit and ran for years, both story and character making an indelible impression on the British public, and later internationally.\n\nA silent film version was produced in 1928, but when King approached it as a new project almost a decade later, the moviemaking landscape in Britain had changed. Conscious of the increasing influence of the British Board of Film Classification, the producer-director submitted the script to them for comment before production began. Their remarks resulted in a change of story emphasis. Slaughter’s killing spree was limited to just one customer, with inferences that there had been a long line of previous victims.\n\nNeeding to open out the story to some extent, scriptwriter Frederick Hayward and dialogue scribe H F Maltby (both refugees from the Red Barn) brought in the intrigue and romance involving Lister and Seton. Although this is never allowed to overshadow Slaughter’s role, it does result in scenes where he is offscreen, which is a pity. There’s also an excursion to (a very fake-looking) Africa, where Seton lays hands on the ‘string of pearls’ which tempt the demon barber to strop his razor.\n\nThere’s also a framing story. The film opens with a customer seeking a shave in a modern-day Fleet Street barbershop, which allows the main narrative to unfold as a story that he is being told. This device serves much the same purpose as the introduction of the characters on stage at the beginning of ‘Maria Marten, or The Murder in the Red Barn’ (1935). Don’t worry, folks, it’s only a story!\n\nThe most curious aspect to modern eyes is the lack of explanation as to the business arrangement between barber and pie-shop owner. Cannibalism was something that was definitely out of bounds for British cinema in the 1930s. However, King turns this to his advantage. Audiences of the time were thoroughly familiar with the tale and didn’t need telling about the eventual destination of Slaughter’s victims. Of course, just inferring it makes it worse, and one of the highlights of the picture is Seton’s sailor friend and comic relief (Jerry Verno) speculating on what’s happened to the bodies while taking repeated big bites out of one of Rho’s pies!\n\nBut, of course, it’s Slaughter who is the main event here, gleefully revelling in murder and mayhem one moment and then quaking in abject fear the next. Subtle he’s not, but his over-the-top performance and the sheer joy he takes in his evil work is highly contagious, and the audience can’t help but root for him as the forces of right and justice close in for the (rather underwhelming) climax. He gets decent support too. Both Rho and Williams had played in the Red Barn and both managed to do more here; Rho effectively cold and understated as Slaughter’s partner in crime and Williams displaying quiet dignity as the businessman facing ruin who won’t sell out his daughter to escape his trouble.\n\n‘Sweeney Todd’ remains Slaughter’s iconic role and, if it’s arguably not his best film, then it’s the one for which he is most remembered."
