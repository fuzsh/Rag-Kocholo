Sweeney Todd, a Fleet Street barber, awaits the arrival of men whose first port of call is for a good, close shave. For most it will be the last time they are seen alive. Using a specially designed barber's chair, Sweeney Todd despatches his victims to the cellar below, where he robs them of their new found fortunes and chops their remains into small pieces. Meanwhile, Mrs Lovett is enjoying a roaring trade for her popular penny meat pies.",

For whatever reason, Todd has become an iconic figure, even going so far as to spawn a musical. The Burton adaptation is alright, but I would…\n\nHorror Hunt #38 (August 2021)\n\n19. Takes place before 1900\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nYou know a film will be good when the back of the DVD is all like \"Hey remember this modern film that a lot of people liked?! Yeah! This old film is based on the same source material as that one!!!\"\n\nCreepy cutter of hair mistreat child workers and chastise young maiden. Only chivalrous champion can stop his charade.\n\nYeah so this is a very unremarkable piece of 30s chiller. Tod Slaughter is a bit fun as the giggling maniac barber, but wow are his victims stupid.. Tod is all like \"Come on in, I will cut you really good.. mwehehehehe!\" And everybody is all like \"Finally!
