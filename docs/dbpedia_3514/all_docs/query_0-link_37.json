Since he fi rst entered the public scene in the mid-nineteenth century, his exploits have chilled and fascinated readers and audiences all the world over. Whether in print, on the stage, or in fi lms, the name of Sweeney Todd has become so ubiquitous that it has entered the English dictionary.1 The general outline of his story, as it fi rst appeared in the pages of nineteenth-century periodicals, and as it subsequently played itself out in a seemingly endless succession of melodramas on the Victorian stage, is straightforward enough. A prosperous London barber in the days when men were compelled regularly to bare their throats to be shaved by comparative (and often disreputablelooking) strangers, Todd routinely murders the unsuspecting patrons of his Fleet Street ‘tonsorial parlour’. Making use of an ingeniously constructed barber’s chair, he dramatically hurls his victims head over heels into the basement of his shop before robbing them. Occasionally, if the drop from the chair to the stone fl oor below has not already done the job for him, Todd is compelled to ‘polish them off ’ with his razor. He then drags their bodies (via an ancient network of subterranean passageways) to the convenient cellar of the nearby premises of Mrs Margery Lovett, who transforms the fresh corpses into succulent meat pies. The clothes, walking sticks, hats, and other personal items belonging to Todd’s unlucky customers are hidden in the barber’s house; their otherwise ‘unusable’ remains are secreted within the mouldering and long-disused vaults beneath the neighbouring church of St Dunstan’s. Todd’s greed and increasing bloodlust inevitably gets the better of him, and his murderous activities spiral out of control. Thanks to the combined efforts of a well-known local magistrate, a team of Bow Street Runners, and an enterprising pair of star-crossed young lovers, the pair are eventually captured and brought to justice before the bar of the Old Bailey. 1 See OED, s.v. ‘Sweeney’: ‘a (nickname for a) barber’.\n\nviii Introduction The relatively simple outline provided by this frankly ghoulish tale of terror has demonstrated itself to be peculiarly accommodating, however. Each generation has been compelled to make use of what might best be described as the ‘mythic’ elements inherent in the macabre story — its resonant themes of avarice, ambition, entrepreneurial capitalism, and cannibalism — effectively to mirror its own particular concerns. Todd’s presence continues to haunt our storybooks, novels, plays, and our airwaves and works of musical theatre; his fi gure can often be found creeping, only barely disguised, through related collections of folklore and local legend. As the Chronology included in this edition makes clear, no sooner had Sweeney Todd made his fi rst formal appearance on the stage of English fi ction, than he appeared suddenly to be everywhere at once. The ‘Demon Barber of Fleet Street’ strode the boards of the late-Victorian and Edwardian theatre in the manner of a blood-splattered, razorwielding colossus. The serendipitously named actor Tod Slaughter famously brought the character to life on cinema screens in 1936, although Slaughter’s eye-rolling interpretation of the role was not the fi rst ‘Sweeney’ to appear on fi lm (nor, of course, was it to be the last). The twentieth century, quite apart from a seemingly unstoppable series of revisions of Todd’s story as a stage melodrama, witnessed the re-emergence of the barber as a feature of popular musical-hall entertainments, as well as versions of his tale on radio, in elaborately illustrated graphic novels, and children’s books. In 1959, the well-known composer Malcolm Arnold, with choreographer John Cranko, even reinterpreted the story as a Covent Garden ballet. The continued popularity of Todd’s story well into the twentyfi rst century, as we shall see, owes a particularly great debt to the American composer Stephen Sondheim, whose spectacular ‘musical thriller’ based on the story premiered in 1979. Fine Young Cannibals: The Birth of Sweeney Todd The story of the original, rip-roaring serial publication that fi rst launched Todd’s career is no less fascinating than the history of its many successors. Strikingly, the character of the demon barber made his fi rst appearance in English in the pages of an eighteenpart serial that did not even bear his name in its title. The story that we today know as ‘Sweeney Todd’ originally appeared, rather, as\n\nIntroduction ix The String of Pearls: A Romance (the text that is reproduced in this edition). The serial was fi rst included by the prolifi c publisher Edward Lloyd (1815 – 90) in his The People’s Periodical and Family Library, where it ran from 21 November 1846 until 20 March 1847. The People’s Periodical was one of several such papers published by the often unscrupulous Lloyd, whose London offi ce at 12 Salisbury Square — just off Fleet Street — soon established itself as the informal centre of the ‘penny blood’ publishing industry.2 (The terms ‘penny bloods’ or ‘blood books’ gained currency in the mid- to latenineteenth century as shorthand colloquialisms to describe what were also known as ‘blood-and-thunder books’ — tales of the murderous exploits of outlaws, highwaymen, and thieves; the slightly later coinage ‘penny dreadful’ was also used to designate ‘shockers’ or crime stories ‘written in a sensational or morbidly exciting style’.3) Lloyd had begun his career a decade earlier, publishing plagiarisms of the hugely popular works of Charles Dickens (his products included such audacious titles as Oliver Twiss (1838 – 9) and Nikelas Nickelberry (1838)). Yet even as early as 1836, when he had begun publishing works such as his History and Lives of the Most Notorious Pirates . . ., Lloyd had been alive to the potential market available to any publisher willing to provide the rapidly expanding audience of working-class readers with even cheaper and more ‘sensational’ reading material. Throughout the next few years, publications such as Lloyd’s Penny Atlas (1842 – 5) and Lloyd’s Penny Weekly Miscellany (1842 – 7) made a point of catering almost exclusively to this popular taste. Long-term technological progress (including the arrival of the new steam-powered printing press, the abolition of the stamp tax on newspapers, and the development of cheaper forms of paper made from Spanish esparto grass) had all worked in the publisher’s favour. Lloyd’s earliest productions were printed in the form of monthly ‘chapbooks’ or small pamphlets of anywhere from twenty-four to thirty-six pages. They typically sold for sixpence each. Lloyd later switched to the more rapidly produced and 2 For an excellent summary of Lloyd’s career as a publisher, see Rohan McWilliam on ‘Edward Lloyd (1815 – 1890)’, in New Oxford Dictionary of National Biography (Oxford University Press, 2004), 34, 118 – 19. 3 See OED, s.v. ‘dreadful’. See also C. B. Fry’s anecdotal recollections of the usage of such terms in the ‘Introduction’ to E. S. Turner’s Boys Will Be Boys (London: Michael Joseph, 1948), 7 – 12.\n\nx Introduction commercially viable format of the weekly magazine, each issue of which provided readers with eight pages of any given serial narrative for only a penny. (By way of contrast, the original, individual part numbers of Dickens’s Pickwick Papers, beginning in March 1836, cost one shilling — or twelvepence each — with a fi nal number at two shillings; the earliest single-volume edition of the novel, printed in November 1837, sold for twenty-one shillings.4) Lloyd’s penny bloods, in other words, although legitimately related to the traditions of the Gothic novel, to the earliest work of writers such as Dickens himself and to the so-called ‘Newgate novels’ of his contemporaries (most notably William Harrison Ainsworth) and, fi nally, to the hugely popular ‘sensation’ novels of authors a little later in the century like M. E. Braddon, Wilkie Collins, and Ellen Wood (Mrs Henry Wood), managed to embrace an entirely new audience of readers — readers for whom even the part numbers of a monthly serial would otherwise have remained fi nancially just beyond their reach. Before the fi rst appearance of Sweeney Todd in 1846, Lloyd had already introduced what has been described as ‘[one] of the most enduring icons of Victorian popular culture’, when he published James Malcolm Rymer’s Varney the Vampyre, or, the Feast of Blood (1845).5 The fi gure of Varney — a distant relation to John Polidori’s The Vampyre of 1819, and one of the progenitors of Bram Stoker’s much later Dracula (1897) — did much to establish the fi gure of the ‘aristocratic vampire’ as a fi xture in the public’s imagination. Lloyd had even, in an 1844 issue of his Penny Atlas (vol. 2, no. 97), already set about whetting the public’s appetite for a tale featuring a murderous barber. The anonymously authored ‘Joddrel, the Barber, or, Mystery unravelled’ [sic] told the story of a London barber whose neighbours begin to grow suspicious when many of his customers seem mysteriously to disappear; their bodies are later discovered hidden in a cupboard in Joddrel’s Bishopsgate shop, with wooden stakes driven through their heads. Although ‘Joddrel, the Barber’ contains no references either to cavernous cellars or to meat pies, the story nevertheless clearly anticipates the full-fl edged 4 See James Kinsley, ‘Introduction’ to Charles Dickens, The Pickwick Papers (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1986), pp. xv – lxxxv. 5 See Louis James on ‘James Malcolm Rymer pseuds. M. J. Errym, Malcolm J. Merry (1803/4 – 1884)’, in New Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, 48, 494 – 5.\n\nIntroduction xi narrative of Sweeney Todd as it was eventually to be presented in The String of Pearls. 6 Moreover, ‘Joddrel’ effected a further, important connection between the original 1846 – 7 serial and some even earlier, possible sources for the narrative. The most noteworthy of these precedents was a short, journalistic account that had fi rst appeared in an 1824 publication called The Tell-Tale, under the eye-catching title ‘A Terrifi c Story of the Rue de la Harpe, Paris’. Republished as recently as 1841, it told the story of a Parisian peruquier or barber and wig-maker, whose shop was visited by two ‘incautious’ visitors from the country. ‘Whilst in the shop of this fi end’, the item noted, the pair ‘unhappily talked of the money they had about them, and the wretch, who was a robber and murderer by profession, as soon as the one turned his back, drew his razor across the throat of the other and plundered him’. ‘The remainder of the story’, the account relished, ‘is almost too horrible for human ears, but is not upon that account the less credible’: [A] pastry-cook, whose shop was so remarkable for savoury patties that they were sent for to the Rue de la Harpe from the most distant parts of Paris, was the partner of this peruquier, and those who were murdered by the razor of the one were concealed by the knife of the other in those very identical patties, by which, independently of his partnership in those frequent robberies, he made a fortune.7 An even earlier item that fi rst appeared in the London Chronicle of 2 December 1784 (soon republished in the Annual Register for 1784 – 5) told of ‘a most remarkable murder’ that was supposed to have been perpetrated ‘by a journeyman barber . . . near Hyde Park Corner’.8 Other sources traced the general story back even further, one of them insisting that the tale was based on an actual historical 6 See Helen R. Smith, New Light on Sweeney Todd, Thomas Peckett Prest, James Malcolm Rymer and Elizabeth Caroline Grey (London: Jarndyce, 2002), 23. It was thanks to the diligent research of Smith that this vampiric variation on the Todd narrative was recovered; she further points out that the Joddrel story contains ‘no cellars or pies’, but effects a clear link between Todd’s narrative and those of his earliest predecessors, generally. 7 From The Tell-Tale (1824), cols. 509 – 12. The issue is noted to have been printed at the Caxton Press, by Henry Fisher, and published at 38 Newgate Street. The engraved frontispiece is dated ‘Jan. 1 1824’. As noted, the ‘Terrifi c story of the Rue de la Harpe’ was reprinted in 1841; the account also appeared under the title ‘The Murderous Barber’ in a periodical entitled The New Wonderful and Entertaining Magazine (1825). 8 Annual Register (1784 – 5), 208.\n\nxii Introduction incident that had taken place in Venice some time in the mideighteenth century.9 Precedents of this sort are no doubt fascinating. Readers should always keep in mind, however, that the origins of Todd’s story — a story that is essentially a nineteenth-century fable, the peculiar originality of which lies in its achievement of so spectacularly intertwining the narrative of a greedy, murderous barber, on the one hand, with that of a casually unprincipled and opportunistic baker of meat pies, on the other — lie much deeper than any of these more immediate textual ‘cues’ or sources. The underlying, cannibalistic obsessions of the atavistic Todd ‘myth’ can be traced back to sources as early as Homer’s Odyssey, and are to be found everywhere in traditional fairy tales and folk narratives (e.g. ‘Bluebeard’, ‘Captain Murder’, ‘Hansel and Gretel’, ‘Jack and the Beanstalk’, etc.). The tale relies in a similar manner on a number of other related features of native and national mythologies (the fi delity of the hound Hector to his master, Lieutenant Thornhill, in the opening chapters of the novel, for example, is based upon the popular story of the ‘Dog of Montargis’, which in its own right furnished the plot for several popular melodramas in the mid-Victorian period).10 Equally important literary and textual sources for the treatment of the themes of 9 See Anthony Pasquin, The Life of the Late Earl of Barrymore. Including a history of the Wargrave theatricals and original anecdotes of eminent persons. By Anthony Pasquin, esq. A new edition, corrected and much enlarged (London: H. D. Symonds, 1793), 52 – 4. The story is recounted in this volume as an anecdote related to the author, Pasquin, by the Italian pantomimist Carlo Antonio Delpini (c.1740 – 1808). 10 Those determined to fi nd — if not any primary source for Sweeney Todd — then at least some of the more specifi c originating archetypes that inform his subsequent ‘myth’ have been prompted to point in turn to material as varied and as tenuously related to any ‘fi nal’ version of Todd’s story as the Ballad of the ‘fi ve Woemen-Barbers | That lived in Drewry-Lane’ recalled so fondly by John Aubrey (1626 – 97) in his Brief Lives, or to Thomas Delonay’s Pleasant History of Thomas of Reading (c.1602), an early example of a tradition of urban ‘underworld’ literature that includes the account of a murderous innkeeper and his wife; Delonay’s narrative is remarkable for its detailed inclusion and description of a mechanical device remarkably similar to the barber’s famous revolving chair. Sweeney’s tale has been most often linked (although it is at best indebted only broadly and thematically) to the many narratives that surrounded ‘Sawney Beane’, the so-called ‘Maneater of Midlothian’, versions of whose supposedly true story were reprinted many times throughout the eighteenth century. Beane was alleged to have been an outlaw who raised an entire extended and incestuous ‘family’ of predatory cannibals who lived in a close-to-inaccessible cave on the shores of the county of Galloway; he was eventually to feature as a major character in his own right, in the Scottish novelist S. R. Crockett’s 1876 novel, The Grey Man of Auchinleck.\n\nIntroduction xiii greed, murder, guilt, and paranoia that are so memorably brought to life in The String of Pearls include the ‘domestic’ tragedies of George Lillo (particularly his hugely successful The London Merchant (1731), and his later Fatal Curiosity (1736)), as well as the enormously popular ‘criminal biographies’ by authors such as Henry Fielding (e.g. Jonathan Wild (1743)). Pamphlets detailing the lives, trials, confessions, and last days of the prisoners at Newgate — culminating in collections such as the Newgate Calendar, which began publication in the late-eighteenth century — had also catered to a reading public that was already well on its way to developing a taste for such fare as Mrs Lovett would have to offer. Fleshing Out the Story Not that either Mrs Lovett or Sweeney Todd, we must again remind ourselves, would appear actually to have been intended to fi gure quite so centrally or spectacularly in the story with which they would later be so famously associated. The notorious ‘Demon Barber of Fleet Street’ is a character who from his very fi rst appearance in English fi ction is himself something of a cannibal — he is a character who takes over and devours what was intended to have been the tale of others. Sweeney Todd and Mrs Lovett are macabre, imaginative creations who even in their earliest incarnations suitably consume the narrative substance of what was meant primarily to be a romance (in this sense, Todd is reminiscent of another of his near-contemporaries in nineteenth-century fi ction, Daniel Quilp, the malignant dwarf who effects a similar, imaginative co-option of narrative substance in Charles Dickens’s The Old Curiosity Shop (1840 – 1)). As matters so turned out, The String of Pearls was a title that would within only a matter of months diminish in signifi cance, and one that would eventually disappear altogether. Further complicating both the history of the barber’s earliest appearance by name in fi ction and the very notion of such narrative appropriation or cannibalism is the fact that even before the fi nal number of Lloyd’s story had appeared in print on 20 March 1847, a dramatized version of the tale, adapted for the stage by George Dibdin Pitt, was already being performed at the Britannia Theatre, Hoxton, since late February of that year — performed, in other words, some three weeks before the ‘original’ narrative in The People’s Periodical\n\nxiv Introduction had even reached its own conclusion. So it was that the endings even of the earliest stage and prose versions of Todd’s story were to differ from each other in several signifi cant respects. Rather than focusing with such relish on the activities that take place in Todd’s Fleet Street barber shop, the particular story that self-consciously presented itself to its earliest readers as a ‘romance’ in Lloyd’s original The String of Pearls was ostensibly the more conventional tale of a pair of young lovers. Their names in this fi rst telling of the tale (as in many later versions) are Mark Ingestrie and Miss Johanna Oakley. For readers of mid-Victorian fi ction, their dilemma would already have been a familiar one. Mark is described by his uncle early in the novel as a ‘handsome, wild, harum-scarum, sort of fellow’ who, rather than following the path of respectable convention and becoming a lawyer, as his guardian had planned, has opted rather to ‘go abroad and make his fortune’ at sea. Before sailing for the East Indies, Mark met and pledged his love to Johanna Oakley, the beautiful daughter of a successful City tradesman. Mark promised Johanna that in exactly two years’ time he would either return to her or send her news of his whereabouts. ‘If I heard nothing of him,’ Johanna later confesses to her sympathetic father, ‘I was to conclude he was no more.’ When the novel opens in August 1785, the two-year anniversary of Mark’s departure has arrived, and the distressed Johanna fears the worst. She is surprised when she is contacted not by Mark Ingestrie himself, but by one Colonel Jeffery. Jeffery informs her that the only individual who might have been able to tell her anything about her lover’s fate — a fellow passenger of Mark’s by the name of Lieutenant Thornhill, with whom Jeffery himself has only recently arrived in London — mysteriously disappeared shortly after alighting from their ship, at Temple Stairs. The eponymous ‘string of pearls’ appears to have been the only item of any real value in Thornhill’s possession when he went missing. The privileged reader is informed in the novel’s opening chapter that it had been the intention of Lieutenant Thornhill to pass these pearls on to Johanna in Mark’s name; Thornhill, too, seems to believe that Johanna’s lover is ‘dead and gone, poor fellow, and the salt water washes over as brave a heart as ever beat’. In such a manner are readers inducted into the mystery of the tale of Sweeney Todd. Like pioneer detectives we follow in the footsteps\n\nIntroduction xv of Johanna and Colonel Jeffery in their search for Thornhill, who can in turn (they hope) provide them with some information regarding the fate or whereabouts of Mark Ingestrie. It soon becomes obvious to both Jeffery and Johanna that the trail of the recently arrived Thornhill goes cold from the moment he fatefully crossed the threshold of Todd’s shop, which he seems to have entered simply with the intention of being shaved and making himself more presentable before seeking out Johanna. Only slowly are the several strands of the narrative that subsequently unfolds pulled together in the pages that follow, and only gradually do the ghoulish connections that link the repeated and increasingly suspicious disappearances of the customers of Todd’s Fleet Street tonsorial parlour to Mrs Lovett’s pie-shop in nearby Bell Yard become clear. Indeed, as was often the case with many of the hastily written stories that fi rst appeared in publications such as Lloyd’s penny bloods, some narrative strands are started only to be abandoned altogether as the interest of the writers or of the audience (or both) led them elsewhere; alternatively — as happens to be the case with some of the ‘sub-plots’ set up in the earliest chapters of The String of Pearls — such strands could be picked up, fi lled out, or otherwise exploited at much greater length in subsequent retellings of the story. (These could swell to enormous sizes, and in almost all cases the longer versions dilute rather than enhance their originals.) The primary intention of the writers of these ‘bloods’ was to hook their readers as quickly and as effectively as possible — something the author of The String of Pearls accomplishes with consummate ease. Within the space of just a few short pages, we are introduced to the spectacularly grotesque fi gure of Todd himself (characterized physically by his ‘huge hands and feet’, his bizarre hair, which is said to resemble ‘a thickset hedge, in which a quantity of small wire had got entangled’, and his ‘immense mouth’, out of which he spasmodically barks out his harsh and ‘unmirthful’ laugh). We look on in fascination, in the manner of unwilling yet hypnotized witnesses, as all the features of the larger mystery that soon emerge — the tantalizing details of which will titillate us in the weeks and months to come — are laid out for our consideration. The inexplicable disappearance of the patrons of Todd’s shop; the curiously and suddenly ‘vacant’ barber’s chair; the young apprentice terrifi ed into submission by his master’s all-too-believable threat to ‘cut [his] throat\n\nxvi Introduction from ear to ear’ if he breathes a word to anyone of what passes inside the Fleet Street shop; the barber’s inexplicably suspicious reaction to the same apprentice’s innocent reference to ‘the veal pies at [Mrs] Lovett’s in Bell-yard’; the fatal admission, on the part of Todd’s fi rst customer, Lieutenant Thornhill, that he has only just returned from a voyage to the East Indies (a location redolent of the possibilities of untold wealth); the persistence of the faithful dog, Hector; the rueful recollection on the part of the barber’s next patron, Mr Grant, of his missing nephew, Mark Ingestrie: we encounter all these narrative elements, remarkably, in little more than eight highly economical and tightly written pages. Strongly willed or pathologically incurious indeed would be those readers who could with any ease resign themselves never to learn anything more of just what it is that happens to any man so unfortunate as ever to set foot in the Fleet Street shop of Sweeney Todd! ‘Polishing Him Off ’: Borrowed Seasonings The name of the particular author (or authors) who actually sat down to write the earliest version of the story fi rst published as The String of Pearls and later known as Sweeney Todd is likely forever to remain contested. Edward Lloyd employed a regular ‘stable’ of writers, and it was not uncommon for one ‘hack’ to begin a story, only to see the material then passed on to another member of the publisher’s team for continuation, expansion, or completion. The String of Pearls as it fi rst appeared in 1846 – 7 was for many years attributed vaguely to the prolifi c Thomas Peckett Prest, although Prest himself was in fact said to have taken up the tale only after the failing eyesight or generally poor health of its originating author, one George Macfarren, prevented him from working on it any further (this would also help to explain why several narrative strands begun in the earliest chapters of the novel are completely disregarded in the subsequent pages). But The String of Pearls is really not of a piece with Prest’s other work (the quality of the writing is, in fact, arguably superior to most of his output). The most recent bibliographical scholarship on the writings of Prest and his peers argues convincingly that the narrative is far more likely to have been the work of James Malcolm Rymer, an author whose work was eventually to attract the favourable attention of Robert Louis Stevenson,\n\nIntroduction xvii and who, as the critic and ‘bloods’ bibliographer Helen R. Smith rightly asserts, ‘now deserves proper reassessment as a writer’.11 Whoever it was that wrote the earliest version of the story, he was strongly under the infl uence of Charles Dickens at the time. Many commentators have noted a prominent cluster of references in Dickens’s Martin Chuzzlewit (1843 – 4), all of which reveal the character of Tom Pinch, in that same novel, to be convinced that country visitors to London are regularly lured into unfamiliar quarters where they are ‘made meat pies of or some horrible thing’.12 Dickens writes that the guileless Pinch is grateful that his own ‘evil genius did not lead him into the dens of any of those preparers of cannibalic pastry, who are represented in many standard country legends, as doing a lively retail business in the metropolis’.13 Passages such as these clearly demonstrate Dickens’s own familiarity with the prevalent rural fears regarding the increasingly voracious and appetitive dangers that were associated with the rapidly expanding urban environment. Insuffi cient attention has perhaps been paid to Dickens’s very particular characterization of such stories as ‘standard country legend[s]’. Many readers have assumed that the novelist’s apparent allusions must only naturally have refl ected his awareness — in some form or other — of the specifi c story of Sweeney Todd. In actual fact what is likely to have happened is that Dickens himself (albeit indirectly) is the one who unwittingly instigated the transformation of what had until then remained a vague and multifaceted rural myth into a more substantial and singular narrative reality. A collation of the major works that were being produced and published by Dickens in the early 1840s reveals the author of The String of Pearls to have been heavily and on occasion quite specifi - cally indebted to the master novelist. Those strands of the Todd narrative that include the representation of the Oakley household on Fore Street — with the characters of the pompous and hypocritical preacher Mr Lupin, the shop-boy Mr Sam, and Johanna’s protective uncle ‘Big Ben’ — have clearly been inspired by Dickens’s description of the Varden family in the earliest chapters of Barnaby Rudge (13 February–27 November 1841); many of the details relating to 11 See Smith, New Light on Sweeney Todd, 28. 12 Charles Dickens, Martin Chuzzlewit, ed. Margaret Cardwell (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1982), 495. 13 Ibid. 496.\n\nxviii Introduction Todd’s nocturnal journey to the lapidary in Moorfi elds in Chapter 7, and his unintentional visit to the ‘thieves’ den’ in Chapter 8, appear likewise to have been taken from that same novel (particularly from the activities of the apprentice locksmith Sim Tappertit in the fourth weekly number of Barnaby Rudge). The central narrative that is based around Mark Ingestrie’s attempts simultaneously to impress his uncle, Mr Grant, and to win the approval of Johanna’s father by making his fortune in the East Indies, similarly bears a remarkably close resemblance to the earliest descriptions of Walter Gay, Sol Gills, and Captain Cuttle that had only just been offered to readers in the fi rst monthly part of Dombey and Son in October 1846. Yet as one might expect from Dickens’s direct references to ‘cannibalic pastries’ in Martin Chuzzlewit, noted above, it was that same novel (published from January 1843 through to July 1844) that exerted the strongest infl uence on the author of The String of Pearls. In chapter 19 of Martin Chuzzlewit (which had been included in the monthly part for September 1843), the reader is fi rst introduced to the character of Poll Sweedlepipe. Sweedlepipe is the landlord of the famous Sarah Gamp at Kingsgate Street in High Holborn, who ‘was an easy shaver also, and a fashionable hair-dresser’.14 His premises are noted as being ‘next door but one to the celebrated mutton-pie shop, and directly opposite to the original cat’s meat warehouse; the renown of which establishments was duly heralded on their respective fronts’.15 (One of Hablot K. Browne’s illustrations for the original number even features representations of both Sweedlepipe’s shop — with a sign advertising ‘Easy Shaving’ in its window — as well as the neighbouring ‘Mutton Pie Depot’, the front of which is similarly ornamented with a signboard in the shape of a mutton pie.) It is not at all unlikely that the relatively straightforward notion of combining those long-standing, narrative traditions that told the story of a barber who cut the throats of his customers, on the one hand, with the rural legends that whispered of the bodies of slaughtered countrymen being disposed of in the form of succulent meat pies, on the other, may in this instance have been prompted by the simple contiguity of Dickens’s description and Phiz’s typically superb and economical 14 Dickens, Martin Chuzzlewit, 265. 15 Ibid. 266. ‘Cat’s meat’, incidentally, was horse fl esh that had been prepared and sold by street dealers as food for domestic cats.\n\nHablot K. Browne’s (‘Phiz’) illustration for Martin Chuzzlewit, with Poll Sweedlepipe’s barber’s shop and the ‘Original Mutton Pie Depot’ in the background.\n\nxx Introduction illustration in Martin Chuzzlewit. If anything, the conspicuous absence of any reference at all to Sweeney Todd or Mrs Lovett by name in Dickens’s own writing suggests that, although the myths upon which their specifi c characters were to be based may have enjoyed a general circulation at the time, they had yet to coalesce into distinct and precisely named narrative fi gures. It was perhaps inevitable, however, from the moment the simple premise of the story of Sweeney Todd was itself accepted as true, that readers would want to learn as much as they possibly could about the supposed ‘facts’ of the case. The historian Matthew Kilburn, in an entry on Todd rather oddly included in the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, has emphasized that by as early as 1878 ‘it had become widely accepted that Sweeney Todd was a historical person’.16 The reasons behind such easy acceptance are not hard to divine. At the very least, the specifi cs of the many spurious biographical narratives that have adhered to the fi gure of Todd from the late-nineteenth century onward could go some small way towards explaining just how such a monster could ever have come into being in the fi rst place; they could help us to understand why an ‘ordinary’ barber such as Todd ‘became’ the creature that he did. More particularly, readers and audiences could comfort themselves with the knowledge that Sweeney Todd’s adult crimes were rooted — as theatre programmes over the centuries have been compelled to insist — in such experiences as his mistreatment and abandonment as a child, in his appalling treatment as a young offender incarcerated amongst hardened criminals in Newgate, and in the justifi able (or explicable) resentment of a persecuted member of the working classes. Sweeney Todd had not been born a villain, the story of his ‘life’ looks to reassure us, he was himself the victim of a society that was guilty of treating an entire class of people as little more than a disposable source of cheap labour — of treating them as objects rather than as individuals. It cannot be emphasized too strongly that those accounts that insist, even today, on the historical ‘truth’ behind Todd’s story are not only wrong-headed, but more often than not grossly and purposefully misleading. Such accounts routinely cite from ‘fi rst-hand documents’ and sources that are supposed to 16 Matthew Kilburn, ‘Todd, Sweeney [called the Demon Barber of Fleet Street] (supp. fl . 1784)’ in the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, 54. 887 – 8.\n\nIntroduction xxi have been included in otherwise reputable publications such as the Gentleman’s Magazine, the Newgate Calendar, and the Proceedings of the Old Bailey (1674 – 1834); these sources and ‘documents’ simply do not exist. The only alternative for those who would wish to argue for the historical truth of Todd’s story is for them to quote authoritatively from collections of London ‘lore and legend’ — collections that never, themselves, made any pretension to relate anything that was other than obviously and self-professedly fi ctional.17 However he came fully to be conceived — whoever it was that fi rst gave to the constituent features of Todd’s narrative a local habitation and a name — the Demon Barber is to some extent the product of the collective national psyche. Matthew Kilburn no doubt comes closest to the more nebulous ‘truth’ that lies behind the legend of Sweeney Todd when he asserts that the barber is ‘perhaps best described as a personifi cation of early nineteenth-century fears of the anonymity of urban life built around some recorded events and older fi ctional or legendary sources’.18 The Demon Barber of Fleet Street is a particular manifestation of a legend that could perhaps lay claim to being as ancient as urban civilization itself. Sweeney Todd is arguably not so much an ‘urban legend’ — as that term is generally understood — as a rural legend. His tale is a sustained narrative expression of that peculiar, communal anxiety that manifests itself whenever an individual is surrendered to and swallowed by the greater cosmopolitan crowd; those people who chose to leave the safety and familiarity of their extended ‘families’ in smaller, close-knit rural communities are liable to ‘disappear’ in the big city. In Sweeney Todd, such individuals not only disappear, they are literally consumed; they are eaten up. What had once been metaphorical has become real. It is no mere accident of circumstance that Sweeney Todd himself emerges into life at the precise historical moment when the world city of London is perceived even by its most ardent champions to have swollen forever beyond the bounds of control — when it has become a metropolitan entity that is dangerous and non-negotiable. It is particularly striking, too, that although the original serial narratives and dramas 17 See, e.g. George Walter Thornbury’s Haunted London (London: Chatto & Windus, 1865), Old Stories Retold (London, 1869), and Old and New London, 2 vols. (London: Cassell & Co., 1875). 18 Kilburn, ‘Sweeney Todd’, 888.\n\nxxii Introduction relating to Sweeney Todd quite clearly describe him as a lateeighteenth-century fi gure (the action in Lloyd’s novel, again, is very explicitly set in August 1785), his status in the popular imagination is that of a conspicuously Victorian fi gure; time has transformed Todd into the natural companion, in fact, of ‘Jack the Ripper’ ( fl. 1888 – 91). ‘More Hot Pies’: Stephen Sondheim’s Sweeney The fact that modern audiences continue to think of Sweeney Todd as one of the ‘gaslight ghouls’ of nineteenth-century London owes much to what has easily emerged as the most popular twentiethcentury version of his narrative: the unlikely ‘musical thriller’ produced by the Broadway composer Stephen Sondheim. Sondheim fi rst came across Todd’s story during a working visit to London in 1973.19 The playwright Christopher G. Bond’s own reconception of Dibdin Pitt’s original melodrama — a self-confessedly ambitious version of the story in which the author openly admitted to having ‘cast [his] net wider than anyone else in “borrowing” from other authors’ was then playing to a surprisingly responsive and enthusiastic audience at Joan Littlewood’s Theatre Royal, Stratford East. Reviewing Bond’s play as it was originally produced by the Theatre Workshop in pages of The Times, the critic Irving Wardle observed that ‘the story is horrible partly because of the idea of queues in Fleet Street gorging themselves on human fl esh, and partly because Sweeney [in Bond’s version] is not a true villain. He starts with all the right on his side’.20 What Bond had done to Todd’s story effectively turned the traditional dramatic narrative on its head. Rather than playing up the traditions of melodrama, or turning the play into a burlesque by playing them strictly for laughs, Bond embraced their relevance and enhanced their satiric possibilities. In earlier stage versions of the barber’s career, Todd had invariably been portrayed as a dangerous and increasingly paranoid homicidal maniac. He murdered those of his customers who were unlikely to be traced to his shop 19 Meryle Secrest, Stephen Sondheim: A Life (New York: Alfred Knopf, 1998), 289 – 90. 20 Irving Wardle, rev. of Sweeney Todd (Theatre Workshop) in The Times, 3 May 1973, p. 7; issue 58772; col. G.\n\nIntroduction xxiii strictly for profi t. His typical targets were farmers or drovers from the country who had sold their goods at market, or sailors who had only just returned from long stretches at sea. In a manner that was at once uncomplicated and yet at the same time terrifyingly real, Todd was quite simply revealed to be greedy. ‘When I was a boy,’ he confesses to the audience in one version of George Dibdin Pitt’s frequently acted adaptation, ‘the thirst of avarice was fi rst awakened by the fair gift of a farthing; that farthing soon became a pound; the pound a hundred — so to a thousand, till I said to myself, I will possess a hundred thousand’.21 In another passage in the drama, the apprentice Tobias denounces Todd as nothing more than a ‘designing, cruel, and cold-blooded murderer’.22 To make matters even less complicated and more melodramatic, the performances of those actors and actresses who specialized in the roles of Todd and Lovett both in the provinces and in London seemed to grow ever more hysterical and frenetic as the years wore on. Reviewing one particularly popular revival of the play at the Elephant and Castle Theatre in 1928, one commentator observed of the performance: ‘No one minces his words, for this is not a puling naturalism, but the rhetoric of melodrama.’ ‘When Mark Ingestrie has been lured into Todd’s shop’, the notice continued, and we, gazing outside from the frosted window-panes, see the shadow of the barber stoop over the shadow of the customer whom he is about to destroy, how necessary it is that the shadow of the razor should be a titanic menace! It is not a barber’s implement in the naturalistic mode: it is a melodramatic symbol! It is larger than life . . . like the wickedness of . . . Lovett, and the wholesale homicide of Sweeney himself.23 Such high-fl own forms of melodrama, however, tended to tread an increasingly thin line between tragedy and farce. ‘There can be few audiences to which Todd could be played seriously today’, one commentator wrote in response to a defence of the play by Montague Summers in the pages of the Times Literary Supplement in 1942, 21 George Dibdin Pitt, The String of Pearls (Sweeney Todd), in Michael Kilgariff (ed.), The Golden Age of Melodrama: Twelve 19th-Century Melodramas (London: Wolfe Publishing Ltd., 1974), 248. 22 Ibid. 256. 23 Unsigned notice in ‘Entertainments’: ‘A Box at the Elephant’ (‘Sweeney Todd’) in The Times, 6 Mar. 1928, p. 14; issue 44834; col. B.\n\nxxiv Introduction ‘and to act it in any other spirit is not to act it at all.’24 By the midtwentieth century, Sweeney Todd was in danger of dwindling forever into the stuff of a two-dimensional burlesque. Bond’s 1973 revision of the drama changed all that. Although the earlier and spurious criminal ‘biographies’ purporting to tell Todd’s life story had occasionally added some narrative details suggesting the barber’s motives, Bond was the fi rst dramatist to provide Todd with a convincing, well-thought-through, and fully integrated ‘back story’. At the beginning of Bond’s play, Todd’s justifi able anger is far more focused; it is directed exclusively at the local judge and beadle who had together, many years earlier, destroyed his career, transported him for life as a convicted felon, and (he believes) killed his beloved wife. Todd’s aim is revenge, pure and simple. Only after his initial attempts to do away with the judge and beadle are frustrated does he come to the conclusion that ‘the work’s its own reward’, and decides that until he has another shot at his enemies he will be contented enough to spend his time ‘in practice on less honoured throats’. ‘For now I fi nd I have a taste for blood’, he cries to Mrs Lovett, ‘and all the world’s my meat.’25 As one early director of Bond’s play observed, ‘Todd should be played as normally and sanely as possible within the context of [Bond’s] play, and this interpretation [is] responsible for emphasizing the horror of the situation.’26 In Sondheim’s subsequent redaction of Bond’s text, Todd’s conclusion was to be even more stark and existential, as he experiences an astounding, climactic ‘epiphany’ in which he realizes that ‘we all deserve to die!’ ‘The history of the world, my sweet,’ as Sondheim’s Todd succinctly explains to Mrs Lovett shortly after achieving this insight into the shared mortality of mankind (in which the members of the audience are, of course, themselves implicated), ‘is who gets eaten and who gets to eat.’27 If Bond, in a preface to his printed theatre text, further reinforced the moral justice of Todd’s righteous anger and vengeance by 24 Unsigned notice in ‘Editorials’: ‘Blood and Thunder’ in The Times, 7 Apr. 1942, p. 5; issue 49203; col.

Based on a Version of ‘Sweeney Todd’ by Christopher Bond (New York: Dodd, Mead, & Company, 1979), 94, 102.\n\nIntroduction xxv pointing out parallels in the action of the play to Elizabethan and Jacobean ‘revenge’ tragedies and to works such as The Count of Monte Cristo (1844 – 6) by Alexandre Dumas, then the original production of his play revelled in the ghoulish inclusivity and tempered melodrama of the legend; Sondheim’s agent, Flora Roberts, who accompanied him to Stratford that night, recalled that audience members were greeted as they stepped into the theatre by ‘a piano player in the lobby and people drinking beer and eating meat pies’.28 Sondheim himself later confessed that although he was immediately impressed by the vitality of the evening’s performance, he only gradually awakened to the musical possibilities inherent in Bond’s Todd. ‘I had heard it was Grand Guignol,’ he commented, and it was something that just knocked me out. Bond’s new version was a tiny play, still a melodrama, but also a legend, elegantly written, part in blank verse — which I didn’t even recognize until I read the script. It had a weight to it, but I couldn’t fi gure out how the language was so rich and thick without being fruity. . . . [Bond] was able to take all these disparate elements that had been in existence rather dully for a hundred and someodd years and make them into a fi rst-rate play. . . . It struck me as a piece that sings.29 Sondheim’s reference to the traditions of the Grand Guignol suggests the theatrical characteristics that featured most prominently in Bond’s Sweeney Todd, and that were eventually to fi gure no less prominently in his own adaptation. Ideally, audiences are brought physically close to the action of the drama, which is unapologetically presented as a grisly spectacle. As the composer later commented: I was only worried about how the audience would take the murders, whether they’d think them silly or not. And then, when Mrs Lovett gets the idea of making the meat pies, what would the audience’s reaction be? In America nobody’s ever heard of Sweeney Todd . . . so they were seeing this wild plot for the fi rst time, and there was a loud gasp at the fi rst murder, which was staged very violently with a great swash of blood. Then when Mrs Lovett got the idea for the pies and the audiences realised what was up, there was a satisfying laugh, the likes of which I’ve rarely heard.30 28 Flora Roberts, quoted in Craig Zadan, Sondheim & Company (1974; 2nd edn., updated, New York: De Capo Press, 1994), 243. 29 Ibid. 243 – 4 30 Secrest, Stephen Sondheim, 291.\n\nxxvi Introduction Hugh Wheeler, who collaborated with Sondheim on the ‘book’ for the musical, further observed of those changes that helped to distinguish their version of the story from those that had preceded it: It’s a wonderful story, and I thought Bond’s version was slightly better than the others, but from my point of view, even his version was that absolutely unreal, old melodrama, where you boo the villain. . . . [W]henever Sweeney came on the audience would hiss and throw hot dogs. The version we wanted to do was a whole tone that was diffi cult to get. We wanted to make it as nearly as we could into a sort of tragedy. I wrote it as a play, but I encouraged [Sondheim] to cannibalise it and make it nearly all music.31 Sondheim’s version of Sweeney Todd, which fi nally premiered on Broadway in March 1979 (and at the Theatre Royal Drury Lane, in London’s West End, the following year), also owed a considerable debt to the Hollywood horror fi lms of the 1940s and 1950s — particularly to the work of Bernard Herrmann, whose score for the 1945 adaptation of Patrick Hamilton’s Hangover Square (1941) had long haunted the composer’s imagination. Some measure of the success of Sondheim’s adaptation can be located in the fact that, having once settled into its Broadway run (and having been described by New York theatre critics more typically hostile to the composer’s work as ‘a musical . . . put together with unusual love, taste, and style’), the production went on to win no fewer than eight out of the nine Tony Awards for which it was nominated, including Best Musical.32 Even more tellingly, his Sweeney Todd has become a fi xture in the repertoires of opera houses all over the world, from New York and London, to Sydney and Berlin. When the suitably Gothic director Tim Burton decided once again to team up with actor Johnny Depp in the twenty-fi rst century to reintroduce an entire generation to the story of the ‘demon barber of Fleet Street’, it was inevitable that the particular version of the tale they would choose to fi lm would be Sondheim’s. To be fair, even had it never occurred to a composer such as Sondheim to write a musical about a murderous barber and his cannibalistic, pie-making accomplice, and even had Tim Burton’s 31 Zadan, Sondheim & Company, 246. 32 Clive Barnes, quoted ibid. 258.\n\nIntroduction xxvii production never been green-lit by Hollywood producers understandably wary of selling such a fi lm to Middle America’s proverbial ‘Mr and Mrs Front Porch’, the seemingly slight and often spurious connections such as that which links the demon barber via cockney rhyming slang with members of the London Metropolitan Police Flying Squad (aka ‘the Sweeny’) would still have done much to keep the Fleet Street legend alive in English popular culture, at the very least.33 Sweeney has always been hard at work somewhere within the British imagination, and (for all the truth of Sondheim’s observation that until 1979 very few Americans ‘had ever heard of Sweeney Todd’), the barber’s infl uence can in fact clearly be traced in now classic American horror stories such as Stanley Ellin’s chilling ‘Speciality of the House’ (1948), and Charles Beaumont’s ‘Free Dirt’ (1955). In 1973 the popular British comic magazine Shiver and Shake fi rst chronicled the adventures of one ‘Sweeney Toddler’ (continued in Whoopee!), and in 1996 the writer Frank Palmer produced the fi rst of a series of detective thrillers featuring the character of one Phil ‘Sweeney’ Todd. The popular British comedy duo the Two Ronnies (Ronnie Barker and Ronnie Corbett) included a sketch featuring one ‘Teeny Todd’ (played by Corbett) in their Sketchbook series, airing fi rst in March and April 2005. Modern purchasers of straight or ‘cut throat’ razors may be disconcerted to fi nd such items not infrequently marketed as ‘Sweeney Todd’ blades, and there are even restaurants that carry Todd’s name on their menus, and advertise a speciality in home-made meat pies. The modern novelist Neil Gaiman, who with artist Michael Zulli in the early 1990s contemplated an ambitious illustrated novel devoted to Todd’s story, to be published as an ongoing ‘work-in-progress’, commented in a 1997 interview that he was at times baffl ed by these sorts of allusions, and by the many different versions of the myth that had been handed down to modern readers and audiences. ‘I kept reading version after version of Sweeney Todd’, Gaiman remarked of the more faithful references of the tale and its characters: ‘here is a couple of Victorian plays, over here would be some 33 See John Roberts Nash, Dictionary of Crime (London: Headline Books, 1992), s.v. ‘Sweeny’ [sic]. The reference is in actual fact more probably connected to John Sweeney, the Irishman who fi rst organized the unit. The same slang would of course, in turn, provide the basis for the popular television drama series (1974 – 8) of the same name.\n\nxxviii Introduction Penny Dreadfuls, here’s something from the 1930s. There’s always Mrs Lovett, there’s always Sweeney Todd, there’s always a judge. But after that it becomes so amazingly fl uid, and I think that was what attracted me.’34 However one chooses to defi ne such an ‘attraction’, the simple fact remains that audiences and readers at the beginning of the twenty-fi rst century are likely to greet the name of Sweeney Todd with a smile of recognition, and more than a passing familiarity with his gruesome story. 34 Neil Gaiman and Michael Zulli, Taboo 6 — The Sweeney Todd Penny Dreadful (n.p., Spiderbaby Grafi x and Publications, 1992).\n\nNote on the Text The narrative of Sweeney Todd was originally published as The String of Pearls: A Romance by Edward Lloyd in his The People’s Periodical and Family Library in eighteen weekly instalments. The story appeared in the periodical’s issues for the weeks ending Saturday, 21 November 1846 (issue 7) to Saturday, 20 March 1847 (issue 24). From as early as 1847 – 8, Lloyd’s original prose version of The String of Pearls was masively expanded and published in a pennypart serialization of 92 eight-page numbers. As was often the practice with such serial publications, nos. 2, 3, and 4 were given away ‘free’ with the fi rst issue; consequently, the expanded version of the narrative appeared over a period of 89 weeks. A bound, singlevolume edition of this version currently in the British Library and dated 1850 runs to 732 pages. The 1850 edition (like the many versions of the stage adaptations of George Dibdin Pitt, Frederick Hazleton, and others) vigorously protested the veracity of the story. Lloyd’s 1850 volume is prefaced as follows: the romance of the string of pearls having excited in the literary world an almost unprecedented interest, it behoves the author to say a few words to his readers upon the completion of his labours. In answer to the many inquiries that have been, from time to time, made regarding the fact of whether there ever was such a person as Sweeney Todd in existence, we can unhesitatingly say, that there certainly was such a man; and the record of his crimes is still to be found in the chronicles of criminality of this country. The house in Fleet Street, which was the scene of Todd’s crimes, is no more. A fi re, which destroyed some half-dozen buildings on that side of the way, involved Todd’s in destruction; but the secret passage, although, no doubt, partially blocked up with the re-building of St. Dunstan’s Church, connecting the vaults of that edifi ce with the cellars of what was Todd’s house in Fleet Street, still remains. From the great patronage which this work has received from the reading public, the author has to express his deep and earnest thanks; and he begs to state, that if anything more than another could stimulate him to renewed exertion to please his numerous patrons, it is the kind and liberal appreciation of his past labours.\n\nSeveral other versions of Todd’s story appeared throughout the middle and later decades of the nineteenth century. The most signifi cant of these included those published by Charles Fox — Sweeney Todd, The Demon Barber of Fleet Street — which ran in The Boys’ Standard magazine in 1878, and a much shorter version published by A. Ritchie of Red Lion Court in roughly the same period. The most popular dramatic versions of the story were the melodramas originally produced by George Dibdin Pitt (1847) and Frederick Hazleton (1862). The present edition follows precisely that of the original 1846 – 7 text in Lloyd’s The People’s Periodical and Family Library, and has been taken from the copy currently in the British Library. The chapters have been correctly renumbered, and any irregular spellings that might otherwise have impeded the modern reader have been brought into conformity with the rest of the text. A number of internal inconsistencies in spelling, capitalization, and punctuation have been tactfully regularized. The end of each part issue has been marked with a short, centred rule in this edition. A single asterisk in the text signifi es an editorial note at the back of the book. xxx Note on the Text\n\nA Select Chronology 1846 – 7 (21 November – 20 March) The String of Pearls: A Romance serialized in Edward Lloyd’s The People’s Periodical and Family Library. Published in eighteen weekly parts (issues nos. 7 – 24) and variously attributed to Edward P. Hingston, George Macfarren, Thomas Peckett Prest, James Malcolm Rymer, and Albert Richard Smith; the publication of the narrative marks the earliest appearance by name in English of the characters of Sweeney Todd, the barber, and his piemaker accomplice, Margery Lovett. 1847 (February/March) The String of Pearls, written by George Dibdin Pitt, fi rst produced and performed as a drama at the Britannia Theatre, Hoxton. Dibdin Pitt’s stage version of Lloyd’s story, signifi cantly, premieres even before publication of the original serial has reached its completion. It is through the many later versions and variations of this original dramatic adaptation that the line most often associated with the barber — ‘I’ll polish him off ’ — becomes Todd’s ‘catchphrase’. 1850 Bound, single-volume edition, running to a total of 732 pages, of an expanded version of the original 1846–7 tale published by Edward Lloyd. This lengthier (and much inferior) version of The String of Pearls (now for the fi rst time subtitled ‘The Barber of Fleet Street. A Domestic Romance’) appears originally to have been published as a stand-alone penny-part serial, probably beginning some time in 1847 – 8. The part work ran for 92 eight-page numbers; as was then typically the practice, nos. 2, 3, and 4 were ‘given away’ with the fi rst number. This ‘penny blood’ serial thus ran for a full 89 weeks. The British Library Catalogue suggests that the work was begun by George Macfarren and possibly completed by Thomas Peckett Prest (see 1846 – 7, above), although such an attribution is now considered unlikely. c.1852 – 3 Sweeney Todd: or the Ruffi an Barber. A Tale of the Terror of the Seas and the Mysteries of the City by ‘Captain Merry’ (pseudonym of American author Harry Hazel (1814 – 89)) published in New York by H. Long and Brother, Nassau Street. Hazel’s work is often a rough and hastily written version (essentially a plagiarism) in thirty-six chapters of Lloyd’s expanded text of 1850.\n\nc.1865 Sweeney Todd, the Barber of Fleet Street: or, the String of Pearls, a new dramatic adaptation by Frederick Hazleton (c.1825 – 90) fi rst performed at The Old Bower Saloon, Stangate Street, Lambeth. Hazleton was later alleged by some to have produced an alternative prose version or ‘novelization’ of the story at about the same time, although it is highly unlikely that such a prose version by Hazleton ever existed. A fraudulently edited and modernized ‘version’ of this ‘novel’ (essentially a redaction of Lloyd’s 1846 – 7 text) was reprinted with an ‘Introduction’ by Peter Haining in 1980. A version of Hazleton’s drama eventually appeared as vol. 102 (1875) of Lacy’s Acting Edition of Plays (absorbed by Samuel French in 1872), a series originally intended to provide reliable acting play-texts of both ‘classic’ and popular dramas for provincial and amateur theatricals. Throughout the latter half of the nineteenth century, a number of other versions of Sweeney Todd — many based to some extent on the texts originally established by Dibdin Pitt and Hazleton — were advertised for performance both in London and in the provinces. 1866 First issue of Edward J. Brett’s The Boys of England, a story paper designed to end the dominance of the ‘penny bloods’ by aiming at a distinctly juvenile readership with adventure stories that typically featured schoolboy heroes such as the popular ‘Jack Harkaway’, rather than criminal fi gures. 1873 First appearance of The Link Boy of Old London (attributed by some to Vane Ireton St John) in Sons of Britannia; the narrative, which also drew heavily on works such as Dickens’s Oliver Twist, was to be republished in The Boy’s Standard, nos. 78 (4 November 1882) to 91 (3 February 1883); Sweeney Todd features as a character in the serial, as does Mrs Lovett (under the name of ‘the Widow Darkman’). c.1878 – 80 Sweeney Todd, the Demon Barber of Fleet Street published by Charles Fox and Co., of 4 Shoe Lane, near Fleet Street. This 48-part inferior and repetitive novelization — often based only very loosely on the original 1846 – 7 text — runs in total to 576 double-columned pages. This version of the story has plausibly been attributed to Charlton Lea, credited also with the version of Spring-heel’d Jack: The Terror of London (c.1878 – 9). c.1880 George Dibdin Pitt’s adaptation of Sweeney Todd published as one of ‘John Dicks’ Standard Plays’ in a version substantially different from that fi rst submitted to the Lord Chamberlain xxxii Chronology\n\nin 1847. This edition asserts that the play was fi rst performed in 1842 — a mistake of some consequence, insofar as it has resulted in the frequent attribution by later critics of the story itself to Dibdin Pitt, rather than to the anonymous author of the 1846 – 7 People’s Periodical narrative published by Lloyd. 1885 Abridged version entitled The String of Pearls, or Passages from the life of Sweeny [sic] Todd, the Demon Barber published by Charles Fox in six instalments in The Boy’s Standard (no. 213, ns 6 June – no. 218, 11 July). This edition appears to have been the fi rst to promote itself to some extent on the basis of the ‘Magnifi cent Large Coloured [Plate]’ that was ‘given away with Nos. 1 & 2’. c.1892 Sweeney Todd the Barber of Fleet Street. A Thrilling Story of the Old City of London. Founded on Facts published in a shortened version of thirteen chapters by A. Ritchie of Red Lion Court, London. 1910 Publication by the Manchester-based Daisy Bank Press of a short version of the Sweeney Todd story, based on Edward Lloyd’s original 1846 – 7 tale. Between 1910 and 1922 the press brought out some fi fty illustrated publications, each of thirty-two pages, many of which reprinted familiar tales of crime and murder. 1926 The earliest fi lm version of Sweeney Todd produced by New Era Productions as ‘a comedy burlesque stage play’ and fi lmed for the ‘Kinematograph Society Garden Party’. The short fi lm — now lost — was directed by British fi lm pioneer George Dewhurst, and starred G. A. Baugham in the title role. 1928 Second (and earliest surviving) fi lm version of Sweeney Todd, produced by Harry Rowson, directed by Walter West, and distributed by Ideal Films Limited. This fi lm — which advertised itself as having been specifi cally ‘adapted from the famous “Elephant and Castle” melodrama’ — featured the well-known actor Moore Marriott as Todd. A self-described ‘traditional’ version of Dibdin Pitt’s Sweeney Todd — with an introduction by Montagu Slater — published by John Lane (London). 1929 Sweeney Todd, the Demon Barber published by Pearson Press; the same ‘edition’ was to be republished by London’s Mellifont Press c.1936. The text for this version of the story may have been written by Edwin T. Woodhall, a former police constable and agent who eventually contributed a number of other Chronology xxxiii\n\ntitles to Mellifont’s ‘Celebrated Crime Series’, including Jack the Ripper, or, When London Walked in Terror (1937). Other possible authors, however, include most notably Hargrave L. Adam, or William and Leonard Townshend. 1935 Radio play by J. P. Quaine—Sweeny [sic] Todd, The Demon Barber of Fleet Street (‘an entirely original version for the radio’ and set ‘in the Reign of George the Second’)—printed in The Collector’s Miscellany, ns nos. 11 – 14 (May – December 1935). 1936 Tod Slaughter stars in Sweeney Todd, The Demon Barber, directed by George King and released by Ambassador Pictures. Slaughter had already made a speciality of playing such villainous roles to great effect on the stage. The fi lm — a muchsimplifi ed version of the story credited to Frederick Hayward and H. F. Maltby and notionally based on the earlier dramatizations of George Dibdin Pitt and Frederick Hazleton — also featured Stelle Rho in the part of Mrs Lovett, and Eve Lister as Johanna Oakley. 1948 Selections from Edward Lloyd’s original version of The String of Pearls (1846 – 7) featured in E. S. Turner’s Boys Will Be Boys: The story of Sweeney Todd, Deadwood Dick, Sexton Blake, Billy Bunter, Dick Barton, et al. (London: Michael Joseph). Turner’s volume was among the fi rst to argue for the value of the ‘new mythology’ of heroes and villains — e.g. Todd, Jack Sheppard, Spring-heeled Jack, Jack Harkaway, Sexton Blake, etc. — contained within the pages of the ‘bloods’ and ‘penny dreadfuls’. 1956 ‘Sweeney Todd the Barber’ — already a popular comic song by R. P. Weston (1906 – 34) in the tradition of the music hall monologue — recorded by the actor Stanley Holloway. Holloway’s version of Weston’s number (which began ‘In Fleet Street, that’s in London Town | When King Charlie wore the crown, | There lived a man of great renown | ’Twas Sweeney Todd the Barber’) continued for some time to feature on the radio as a popular audience request. 1959 (10 December) world premiere of a one-act ballet adaptation — Sweeney Todd — with music by the well-known composer Malcolm Arnold (Op. 68a) and choreography by John Cranko at the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre, Stratford. The ballet’s fi rst London performance was to take place several months later at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, on 16 August 1960. xxxiv Chronology\n\n(10 December) premiere of The Demon Barber at the Lyric Theatre, Hammersmith, a musical version of the story with book and lyrics by Donald Cotton and music by Brian Burke; based on George Dibdin Pitt’s original play and produced by Colin Graham. The musical starred Roy Godfrey as Sweeney Todd and Barbara Howitt as Mrs Lovett; the role of Jonas Fogg was played by Barry Humphries. 1962 (May) The World of Sweeney Todd, book and lyrics by William Scott and Ken Appleby (with additional lyrics by Alan Collins and Mike Burke, and music by Peter Satterfi eld; arranged by Alan Johnson) staged at the People’s Theatre in Newcastleupon-Tyne. The production was revived in 1970, and again represented in April 1995 by the Redditch Operatic Society, at the Palace Theatre, Redditch. (June) Brian Burton’s Sweeney Todd, The Barber. A Melodrama in four acts adapted ‘from George Dibdin Pitt’s Victorian version of the legendary drama’ fi rst presented at the Crescent Theatre, Birmingham, on 16 June. Featuring Frank Jones as Sweeney Todd, and Frances Bull as Mrs Lovett. 1969 Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street (subtitled ‘A Victorian Melodrama’) by Austin Rosser performed at the Dundee Repertory Theatre, Scotland. 1970 Bloodthirsty Butchers, a fi lm directed by Andy Milligan, and written by John Borske and Andy Milligan. An updated and — for its day — exceptionally violent and graphic retelling of the tale, starring Berwick Kaler, John Miranda, Jane Helay, and Annabella Wood. 1973 (May) Sweeney Todd, The Demon Barber of Fleet Street by Christopher G. Bond performed at the Theatre Royal, Stratford East (London). The text of Bond’s play was to be published by Samuel French (London) in 1974; this version of the story was to serve as the primary source for Stephen Sondheim and Hugh Wheeler’s 1979 ‘musical thriller’ of the same name (see 1979, below). The True Life of Sweeney Todd: A Collage Novel by Cozette de Charmoy published in London by the Gaberbocchus Press. 1974 Text of an original nineteenth-century version of George Dibdin Pitt’s adaptation The String of Pearls (Sweeney Todd) included in Michael Kilgarrif’s Golden Age of Melodrama (pp. 237 – 72); the volume also includes a valuable descriptive Chronology xxxv\n\npassage from Thomas W. Erle’s 1880 Letters From a Theatrical Scene-Painter describing an actual nineteenth-century audience at a performance of Dibdin Pitt’s drama at the Britannia Theatre, Hoxton. 1979 Sweeney Todd, The Demon Barber of Fleet Street. A Musical Thriller, with music and lyrics by Stephen Sondheim and a book by Hugh Wheeler, premieres on 1 March at the Uris Theatre in New York. The cast includes Len Cariou as Sweeney Todd, Angela Lansbury as Mrs Lovett, and Victor Garber as the young hero, Anthony Hope. Sondheim’s musical is subsequently awarded the 1979 Tony, and the Drama Critics Circle Award for ‘Best Musical’. The work initially attracted less attention when it was fi rst staged at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, in London the following year. Sondheim’s version would, however, be successfully revived by the New York City Opera as soon as October 1984 (having fi rst been staged as an operatic production by the Houston Grand Opera in July of that same year). 1980 Publication of Peter Miller and Randall Lewton’s The Sweeney Todd Shock ’n’ Roll Show, an amateur musical adaptation loosely based on earlier dramatic versions of the story, and originally staged in Liverpool in January 1979. 1982 The Dark Behind the Curtain, written by Gillian Cross and illustrated by David Parkins. A novel for younger readers, the book takes as its premise the troubled production of a vaguely specifi ed nineteenth-century dramatic version of Sweeney Todd, the Demon Barber of Fleet Street by a group of English schoolchildren. 1992 Taboo 6 — The Sweeney Todd Penny Dreadful issued as a proposal for a limited edition, collaborative ‘work in progress’ uniting award-winning graphic novelist Neil Gaiman with artist Michael Zulli. Although promotional pamphlets for the project featuring ‘A Brief Introduction’, excerpts from earlier texts, as well as reproductions, pastiches, and original sketches and other artwork by Zulli were published, they did not receive a wide circulation, and neither Gaiman nor Zulli were able to follow through on the project. 1998 The Tale of Sweeney Todd, directed by John Schlesinger and featuring Ben Kingsley, Joanna Lumley, and Campbell Scott. The fi lm was written by Peter Buckman with executive producer Peter Shaw (credited specifi cally with story adaptation). Originally produced for ‘Showtime’ and Third Row Center xxxvi Chronology\n\nFilms as a made-for-television movie in America (fi rst aired in the US on 19 April 1998). 2000 (4 – 6 May) Performance and recording of Sondheim’s Sweeney Todd ‘Live in Concert’ by the New York Philharmonic at Lincoln Center, New York. Featuring George Hearn as Sweeney Todd and Patti LuPone as Mrs Lovett. This successful concert version of Sondheim’s Todd was subsequently fi lmed by Ellen M. Krass Productions (in 2001), as performed by members of the same cast with the San Francisco Symphony. The fi lmed concert premiered on American television in October 2001. 2002 Director Francesca Joseph’s made-for-television fi lm Tomorrow La Scala! — in which a small opera company undertakes to mount a production of Sondheim’s Sweeney Todd in a maximum security prison, and the premise of which is the featuring of criminals sentenced to life-imprisonment in the major roles — is premiered at the Cannes Film Festival. Starring Jessica Stevenson and Samantha Spiro, the critically acclaimed fi lm was subsequently nominated for two BAFTA awards. 2003 Sondheim’s Sweeney Todd — featuring Thomas Allen as Todd and Felicity Palmer as Mrs Lovett — receives its fi rst staging at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, London. The production, by Neil Armfi eld, with designs by Brian Thomson, had in fact originated at the Lyric Opera in Chicago in 2002 – 3. (Sondheim’s version of Sweeney Todd had fi rst been staged in England specifi cally as an opera by director David McVicar for Opera North, in Leeds, in 1998.) 2004 Sondheim’s Sweeney Todd — in a revival directed by John Doyle and originally staged as a chamber piece at the Watermill Theatre in Westbury, West Berkshire — transfers to London’s West End and eventually (in 2005) to Broadway’s Eugene O’Neill Theatre. Director John Doyle received a Tony award for the Broadway staging of the production in 2006. 2005 Ray Winstone, Essie Davis, and David Warner star in Sweeney Todd, an entirely new version of the story written for BBC 1 fi lm productions by Joshua St Johnstone and directed by David Moore; originally aired on British television 3 January 2006. 2007 (February) Director Tim Burton begins production in England on the DreamWorks SKG production of the Stephen Sondheim musical Sweeney Todd, The Demon Barber of Fleet Street. The fi lm stars actor Johnny Depp in the title role, and features Helena Bonham Carter as Mrs Lovett, and Alan Rickman as Judge Turpin. Chronology xxxvii\n\nfleet-street 1 2 4 12 8 key 3 1.

Reproduced by permission of the British Library.\n\n1 The Strange Customer at Sweeney Todd’s Before Fleet-street had reached its present importance, and when George the Third was young, and the two fi gures who used to strike the chimes at old St Dunstan’s church were in all their glory—being a great impediment to errand-boys on their progress, and a matter of gaping curiosity to country people—there stood close to the sacred edifi ce a small barber’s shop, which was kept by a man of the name of Sweeney Todd.* How it was that he came by the name of Sweeney, as a Christian appellation, we are at a loss to conceive, but such was his name, as might be seen in extremely corpulent yellow letters over his shop window, by anyone who chose there to look for it.* Barbers by that time in Fleet-street had not become fashionable, and no more dreamt of calling themselves artists than of taking the Tower by storm; moreover they were not, as they are now, constantly slaughtering fi ne fat bears, and yet somehow people had hair on their heads just the same as they have at present, without the aid of that unctuous auxiliary.* Moreover Sweeney Todd, in common with his brethren in those really primitive sorts of times, did not think it at all necessary to have any waxen effi gies of humanity in his window. There was no languishing young lady looking over the left shoulder in order that a profusion of auburn tresses might repose upon her lily neck, and great conquerors and great statesmen were not then, as they are now, held up to public ridicule with dabs of rouge upon their cheeks, a quantity of gunpowder scattered in for a beard, and some bristles sticking on end for eyebrows. No. Sweeney Todd was a barber of the old school, and he never thought of glorifying himself on account of any extraneous circumstance. If he had lived in Henry the Eighth’s palace, it would have been all the same to him as Henry the Eighth’s dog-kennel, and he would scarcely have believed human nature to be so green as to pay an extra sixpence to be shaven and shorn in any particular locality.\n\nA long pole painted white, with a red stripe curling spirally round it, projected into the street from his doorway,* and on one of the panes of glass in his window was presented the following couplet: ‘Easy shaving for a penny, As good as you will fi nd any.’ We do not put these lines forth as a specimen of the poetry of the age; they may have been the production of some young Templer;* but if they were a little wanting in poetic fi re, that was amply made up by the clear and precise manner in which they set forth what they intended. The barber himself was a long, low-jointed, ill-put-together sort of fellow, with an immense mouth, and such huge hands and feet, that he was, in his way, quite a natural curiosity; and, what was more wonderful, considering his trade, there never was seen such a head of hair as Sweeney Todd’s. We know not what to compare it to: probably it came nearest to what one might suppose to be the appearance of a thickset hedge, in which a quantity of small wire had got entangled. In truth, it was a most terrifi c head of hair; and as Sweeney Todd kept all his combs in it—some said his scissors likewise—when he put his head out of the shop-door to see what sort of weather it was, he might have been mistaken for some Indian warrior with a very remarkable head-dress. He had a short disagreeable kind of unmirthful laugh, which came in at all sorts of odd times when nobody else saw anything to laugh at at all, and which sometimes made people start again, especially when they were being shaved, and Sweeney Todd would stop short in that operation to indulge in one those cacchinatory* effusions. It was evident that the remembrance of some very strange and out-of-the-way joke must occasionally fl it across him, and then he gave his hyena-like laugh, but it was so short, so sudden, striking upon the ear for a moment, and then gone, that people have been known to look up to the ceiling, and on the fl oor, and all round them, to know from whence it had come, scarcely supposing it possible that it proceeded from mortal lips. Mr Todd squinted a little to add to his charms; and so we think that by this time the reader may in his mind’s eye see the individual whom we wish to present to him. Some thought him a careless enough harmless fellow, with not much sense in him, and at times 4 The Strange Customer at Sweeney Todd’s\n\nthey almost considered he was a little cracked; but there were others, again, who shook their heads when they spoke of him; and while they could say nothing to his prejudice, except that they certainly considered he was odd, yet, when they came to consider what a great crime and misdemeanour it really is in this world to be odd, we shall not be surprised at the ill-odour in which Sweeney Todd was held. But for all that he did a most thriving business, and was considered by his neighbours to be a very well-to-do sort of man, and decidedly, in city phraseology, warm.* It was so handy for the young students in the Temple to pop over to Sweeney Todd’s to get their chins new rasped: so that from morning to night he drove a good business, and was evidently a thriving man. There was only one thing that seemed in any way to detract from the great prudence of Sweeney Todd’s character, and that was that he rented a large house, of which he occupied nothing but the shop and parlour, leaving the upper part entirely useless, and obstinately refusing to let it on any terms whatever. Such was the state of things, ad 1785, as regarded Sweeney Todd. The day is drawing to a close, and a small drizzling kind of rain is falling, so that there are not many passengers in the streets, and Sweeney Todd is sitting in his shop looking keenly in the face of a boy, who stands in an attitude of trembling subjection before him. ‘ You will remember,’ said Sweeney Todd, and he gave his countenance a most horrible twist as he spoke, ‘you will remember, Tobias Ragg, that you are now my apprentice,* that you have of me had board, washing, and lodging, with the exception that you don’t sleep here, that you take your meals at home, and that your mother, Mrs Ragg, does your washing, which she may very well do, being a laundress* in the Temple, and making no end of money: as for lodging, you lodge here, you know, very comfortably in the shop all day. Now, are you not a happy dog?’ ‘ Yes, sir,’ said the boy timidly. ‘ You will acquire a fi rst-rate profession, and quite as good as the law, which your mother tells me she would have put you to, only that a little weakness of the headpiece unqualifi ed you. And now, Tobias, listen to me, and treasure up every word I say. ’ ‘ Yes, sir. ’ The Strange Customer at Sweeney Todd’s 5\n\n‘I’ll cut your throat from ear to ear, if you repeat one word of what passes in this shop, or dare to make any supposition, or draw any conclusion from anything you may see, or hear, or fancy you see or hear. Now you understand me—I’ll cut your throat from ear to ear—do you understand me?’ ‘ Yes, sir, I won’t say nothing. I wish, sir, as I may be made into veal pies at Lovett’s in Bell-yard* if I as much as says a word.’ Sweeney Todd rose from his seat; and opening his huge mouth, he looked at the boy for a minute or two in silence, as if he fully intended swallowing him, but had not quite made up his mind where to begin. ‘ Very good,’ he said at length, ‘I am satisfi ed, I am quite satisfi ed; and mark me,—the shop, and the shop only, is your place.’ ‘ Yes, sir. ’ ‘And if any customer gives you a penny, you can keep it, so that if you get enough of them you will become a rich man; only I will take care of them for you, and when I think you want them I will let you have them. Run out and see what’s o’clock by St Dunstan’s. ’ There was a small crowd collected opposite the church, for the fi gures were about to strike three-quarters past six; and among that crowd was one man who gazed with as much curiosity as anybody at the exhibition. ‘Now for it!’ he said, ‘they are going to begin; well, that is ingenious. Look at the fellow lifting up his club, and down it comes bang upon the old bell.’ The three-quarters were struck by the fi gures; and then the people who had loitered to see it done, many of whom had day by day looked at the same exhibition for years past, walked away, with the exception of the man who seemed so deeply interested. He remained, and crouching at his feet was a noble-looking dog, who looked likewise up at the fi gures; and who, observing his master’s attention to be closely fi xed upon them, endeavoured to show as great an appearance of interest as he possibly could. ‘ What do you think of that, Hector?’ said the man. The dog gave a short low whine, and then his master proceeded, — ‘ There is a barber’s shop opposite, so before I go any farther, as I have got to see the ladies, although it’s on a very melancholy errand, for I have got to tell them that poor Mark Ingestrie is no more, and Heaven knows what poor Johanna will say—I think I should know 6 The Strange Customer at Sweeney Todd’s\n\nher by his description of her, poor fellow. It grieves me to think now how he used to talk about her in the long night-watches, when all was still, and not a breath of air touched a curl upon his cheek. I could almost think I saw her sometimes, as he used to tell me of her soft beaming eyes, her little gentle pouting lips, and the dimples that played about her mouth. Well, well, it’s of no use grieving; he is dead and gone, poor fellow, and the salt water washes over as brave a heart as ever beat. His sweetheart, Johanna, though, shall have the string of pearls for all that; and if she cannot be Mark Ingestrie’s wife in this world, she shall be rich and happy, poor young thing, while she stays in it, that is to say as happy as she can be; and she must just look forward to meeting him aloft, where there are no squalls or tempests. —And so I’ll go and get shaved at once.’ He crossed the road towards Sweeney Todd’s shop, and, stepping down the low doorway, he stood face to face with the odd-looking barber. The dog gave a low growl and sniffed the air. ‘ Why, Hector,’ said his master, ‘what’s the matter? Down, sir, down!’ ‘I have a mortal fear of dogs,’ said Sweeney Todd. ‘ Would you mind him, sir, sitting outside the door and waiting for you, if it’s all the same? Only look at him, he is going to fl y at me!’ ‘ Then you are the fi rst person he ever touched without provocation,’ said the man; ‘but I suppose he don’t like your looks, and I must confess I ain’t much surprised at that. I have seen a few rum-looking guys in my time, but hang me if ever I saw such a fi gure-head as yours. What the devil noise was that?’ ‘It was only me,’ said Sweeney Todd; ‘I laughed.’ ‘Laughed! do you call that a laugh? I suppose you caught it of somebody who died of it. If that’s your way of laughing, I beg you won’t do it any more.’ ‘Stop the dog! stop the dog! I can’t have dogs running into my back parlour.’ ‘Here, Hector, here!’ cried his master; ‘get out!’ Most unwillingly the dog left the shop, and crouched down close to the outer door, which the barber took care to close, muttering something about a draught of air coming in, and then, turning to the apprentice boy, who was screwed up in a corner, he said, — The Strange Customer at Sweeney Todd’s 7\n\n‘ Tobias, my lad, go to Leadenhall-street, and bring a small bag of the thick biscuits from Mr Peterson’s; say they are for me. Now, sir, I suppose you want to be shaved, and it is well you have come here, for there ain’t a shaving-shop, although I say it, in the city of London that ever thinks of polishing anybody off as I do.’ ‘I tell you what it is, master barber: if you come that laugh again, I will get up and go. I don’t like it, and there is an end of it.’ ‘ Very good,’ said Sweeney Todd, as he mixed up a lather. ‘ Who are you? where did you come from? and where are you going?’ ‘ That’s cool, at all events. Damn it! what do you mean by putting the brush in my mouth? Now, don’t laugh; and since you are so fond of asking questions, just answer me one.’ ‘Oh, yes, of course: what is it, sir?’ ‘Do you know a Mr Oakley, who lives somewhere in London, and is a spectacle-maker?’ ‘ Yes, to be sure I do—John Oakley, the spectacle-maker, in Forestreet, and he has got a daughter named Johanna, that the young bloods* call the Flower of Fore-street.’* ‘Ah, poor thing! do they? Now, confound you! what are you laughing at now? What do you mean by it?’ ‘Didn’t you say, “Ah, poor thing?” Just turn your head a little on one side; that will do. You have been to sea, sir?’ ‘ Yes, I have, and have only now lately come up the river from an Indian voyage.’ ‘Indeed! where can my strop be? I had it this minute; I must have laid it down somewhere. What an odd thing that I can’t see it! It’s very extraordinary; what can have become of it? Oh, I recollect, I took it into the parlour. Sit still, sir. I shall not be gone a moment; sit still, sir, if you please. By the by, you can amuse yourself with the Courier,* sir, for a moment.’ Sweeney Todd walked into the back parlour and closed the door. There was a strange sound suddenly compounded of a rushing noise and then a heavy blow, immediately after which Sweeney Todd emerged from his parlour, and, folding his arms, he looked upon the vacant chair where his customer had been seated, but the customer was gone, leaving not the slightest trace of his presence behind except his hat, and that Sweeney Todd immediately seized and thrust into a cupboard that was at one corner of the shop. ‘ What’s that?’ he said, ‘what’s that? I thought I heard a noise.’ 8 The Strange Customer at Sweeney Todd’s\n\nThe door was slowly opened, and Tobias made his appearance, saying, — ‘If you please, sir, I have forgot the money, and have run all the way back from St Paul’s churchyard.’ In two strides Todd reached him, and clutching him by the arm he dragged him into the farthest corner of the shop, and then he stood opposite to him glaring in his face with such a demoniac expression that the boy was frightfully terrifi ed. ‘Speak!’ cried Todd, ‘speak! and speak the truth, or your last hour is come! How long were you peeping through the door before you came in?’ ‘Peeping, sir?’ ‘ Yes, peeping; don’t repeat my words, but answer me at once, you will fi nd it better for you in the end.’ ‘I wasn’t peeping, sir, at all.’ Sweeney Todd drew a long breath as he then said, in a strange, shrieking sort of manner, which he intended, no doubt, should be jocose, — ‘Well, well, very well; if you did peep, what then? it’s no matter; I only wanted to know, that’s all; it was quite a joke, wasn’t it— quite funny, though rather odd, eh? Why don’t you laugh, you dog? Come, now, there is no harm done. Tell me what you thought about it at once, and we will be merry over it—very merry.’ ‘I don’t know what you mean, sir,’ said the boy, who was quite as much alarmed at Mr Todd’s mirth as he was at his anger. ‘I don’t know what you mean, sir; I only just come back because I hadn’t any money to pay for the biscuits at Peterson’s.’ ‘I mean nothing at all,’ said Todd, suddenly turning upon his heel; ‘what’s that scratching at the door?’ Tobias opened the shop-door, and there stood the dog, who looked wistfully round the place, and then gave a howl that seriously alarmed the barber. ‘It’s the gentleman’s dog, sir,’ said Tobias, ‘it’s the gentleman’s dog, sir, that was looking at old St Dunstan’s clock, and came in here to be shaved. It’s funny, ain’t it, sir, that the dog didn’t go away with his master?’ ‘ Why don’t you laugh if it’s funny? Turn out the dog, Tobias; we’ll have no dogs here; I hate the sight of them; turn him out—turn him out.’ The Strange Customer at Sweeney Todd’s 9\n\n‘I would, sir, in a minute; but I’m afraid he wouldn’t let me, somehow. Only look, sir—look; see what he is at now! did you ever see such a violent fellow, sir? why he will have down the cupboard door.’ ‘Stop him—stop him! the devil is in the animal! stop him I say!’ The dog was certainly getting the door open, when Sweeney Todd rushed forward to stop him; but that he was soon admonished of the danger of doing, for the dog gave him a grip of the leg, which made him give such a howl, that he precipitately retreated, and left the animal to do its pleasure. This consisted in forcing open the cupboard door, and seizing upon the hat which Sweeney Todd had thrust therein, and dashing out of the shop with it in triumph. ‘ The devil’s in the beast,’ muttered Todd, ‘he’s off! Tobias, you said you saw the man who owned that fi end of a cur looking at St Dunstan’s church.’ ‘ Yes, sir, I did see him there. If you recollect, you sent me to see the time, and the fi gures were just going to strike three-quarters past six; and before I came away, I heard him say that Mark Ingestrie was dead, and Johanna should have the string of pearls. Then I came in, and then, if you recollect, sir, he came in, and the odd thing, you know, to me, sir, is that he didn’t take his dog with him, because, you know, sir —’ ‘Because what?’ shouted Todd. ‘Because people generally do take their dogs with them, you know, sir; and may I be made into one of Lovett’s pies, if I don’t—’ ‘Hush! someone comes; it’s old Mr Grant, from the Temple. How do you do, Mr Grant? glad to see you looking so well, sir. It does one’s heart good to see a gentleman of your years looking so fresh and hearty. Sit down, sir; a little this way, if you please. Shaved, I suppose?’ ‘ Yes, Todd, yes. Any news?’ ‘No, sir, nothing stirring. Everything very quiet, sir, except the high wind. They say it blew the king’s hat off yesterday, sir, and he borrowed Lord North’s.* Trade is dull, too, sir. I suppose people won’t come out to be cleaned and dressed in a misling rain. We haven’t had anybody in the shop for an hour and a half.’ ‘Lor! sir,’ said Tobias, ‘you forgot the seafaring gentleman with the dog, you know, sir.’ 10 The Strange Customer at Sweeney Todd’s"
