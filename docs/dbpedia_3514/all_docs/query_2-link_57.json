        "text": "Chance Theater presents Sweeney Todd, The Demon Barber of Fleet Street. Book by Hugh Wheeler. Music and lyrics by Stephen Sondheim. Based on an adaptation by Christopher Bond. Directed by James Michael McHale. Music direction by Lex Leigh. Produced by Rachelle Menaker and Eddie Schuller.\n\nDirector James Michael McHale keeps the thriller and dark elements in this new production of Sweeny Todd. The scenic design by Fred Kinney and Mio Okada honors the grittiness and thriller vibes of the story. The stage features an industrial and dystopian design that reflects the cannibalistic and aggressive tendencies of the characters. Adding to the atmosphere is the excellent lighting design by Jacqueline Malenke. The lighting serves as an effective character to convey the lingering danger of Sweeny Todd’s hunger for revenge.\n\nAnother characteristic of this production is the costume design by Gwen Sloan. Gothic and Victorian, the costumes depict the roughness of London life back in the 1800s. The costumes match the vampiric bent of Sweeny and the inhabitants of the city in their lust for blood, consciously or unconsciously.\n\nSweeney Todd (Winston Peacock) and Judge Turpin (Justin Ryan) bring the animalistic attributes of the protagonist and antagonist. Both of them excel in their portrayal of corruption and maddening thirst for revenge. Ryan’s operatic voice adds a Machiavellian tone to Judge Turpin’s personality. This plays very well in the song “Joanna (Mea Culpa)”, where Turpin’s sexual attraction to Joanna is revealed.\n\nThen there is Mrs. Lovett. Jocelyn A. Brown delivers a superlative performance with her fascinating devilish humor that adds a touch of comedy and tragedy to the play. Despite the roughness of the character, Brown is able to infuse Mrs. Lovett with the vulnerability of a woman that falls hard for an unrequited love.\n\nMcHale’s production is long, about three hours, but the acting, music, and the other creative elements make the time go fast. The attention to detail is extraordinary and the cast delivers a memorable performance. McHale highlights the romance, danger, and tragedy in a way that keeps the audience engaged the whole time.\n\nThis is a story of life, death, and revenge. McHale is able to unify all of the dramatic and creative elements at the end to accentuate that powerful dramatic tool called irony. The phantasmagoric aspect of the story is well executed, giving that aura of mysticism to the resolution, transporting the characters to that space where life and death converge.\n\nBy the way, don’t miss the pool of blood on the stage when you exit, it gives a touch of realism to the experience, almost like witnessing a crime scene.\n\nSweeney Todd, The Demon Barber of Fleet Street\n\nChance Theater @ Bette Aitken theater arts Center on the Cripe Stage\n\n5522 E.
