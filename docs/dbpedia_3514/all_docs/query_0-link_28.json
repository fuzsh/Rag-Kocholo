        "text": "‘Have you ever seen a Paradoxical Tarradidilum?’\n\nAll London is in fear after a series of murders carried out by criminal the ‘Spinebreaker.’ The hysteria intensifies after the killing of Lord Buckhaven and the theft of a valuable jewel.\n\nThe third collaboration between producer-director George King and Britain’s first horror star Tod Slaughter followed the success of previous outings; ‘Maria Marten, or The Murder in the Red Barn’ (1935) and ‘Sweeney Todd: Demon Barber of Fleet Street’ (1936). These low-budget ‘quickies’ were made to fulfil a quota of homemade product imposed by the British Government. It was intended as a response to the glut of American movies that were monopolising the new picture palaces springing up everywhere on the country’s high streets.\n\nThere is little question that the opening of this film is unique in horror movie history. What is it? It’s a comic song delivered by two frightfully posh gentlemen in dinner jackets, of course! Yes, this is Flotsam and Jetsam, an Anglo-Australian musical hall duo of 1920s and 1930s whose tuneful witticisms you might reasonably expect to be long forgotten, but no! Their song ‘Is He an Aussie?’ apparently plays over the end credits of ‘The Purge’ (2013)! Once they’ve exited stage left, we go to an announcer and realise that we’re in a studio sending out a radio broadcast. Next, the compere interviews Mr Henry Hopkins, who has been ‘selling cats meat for the past 50 years’. That’s meat for cats, by the way, not meat made from them!\n\nSo, what on earth is going on? Are we watching the right film? Well, this is apparently a satire on radio shows of the time, such as ‘In Town Tonight’, and the next guest is…you guessed it…Tod Slaughter. The actor ambles on and talks a little about his new ﬁlm, which you are actually already watching! Those familiar with the earlier output of the King-Slaughter partnership will likely assume that this is a ‘framing device’; a narrative disclaimer to reassure the audience that the following drama ‘is only a story’. After all, ‘Maria Marten, or The Murder in the Red Barn’ (1935) began with the actors being introduced on a stage, and ‘Sweeney Todd: Demon Barber of Fleet Street’ (1936) had a modern day barber narrating the story to one of his customers. However, the truth was far more prosaic than that. The Government had recently amended the law regarding the ‘quota quickies’ so they had to be of a certain length. Director King had brought the ﬁlm in short and needed to pad the running time! Eventually, during his interview, Slaughter breaks the fourth wall with a cheeky aside into the camera, and we’re off with the film proper! Eight minutes have elapsed by this point.\n\nThere’s no more hanging about, though. We’re straight into the action as we join the nefarious Slaughter skulking in the bushes with evil intent. He’s casing the mansion of rich nobleman Lord Trelawny with an eye to a heist. But skulking under the radar isn’t really in his special set of skills and he’s spotted by the old goat’s annoying adolescent son. Beating a silent retreat isn’t really on the cards, so another approach is required. We don’t see anything, of course, but we’re left in no doubt as to how he deals with Little Lord Fauntleroy! Quite a start for any film, but especially one of this vintage.\n\nQuickly assuming a cunning disguise (he puts on a pair of little round spectacles), Slaughter transforms himself into Stephen Hawke, well-known businessman and moneylender. His profession may not make him the most popular man in town, but he’s still a respected pillar of the establishment. Across the corridor from his office are the premises of shipping magnate Joshua Trimble (DJ Williams) and his son Matthew (Eric Portman). Inevitably, the young lad is in love with Slaughter’s beautiful daughter, Julia (Marjorie Taylor). She’s adopted, but it’s a secret that even she doesn’t know, and the way Slaughter leers at her suggests that his feelings aren’t purely paternal. As per usual, he gets the financial upper hand over Williams in a matter of business, but this part of the story doesn’t really go anywhere here and probably crept into the script simply from habit.\n\nSlaughter has other things on his mind; specifically, the emerald ring belonging to Lord Brickhaven (George M Slater). Of course, luring him onto the terrace and breaking his spine during a society gathering is a genius plan. Especially when the said gathering is at your own home, and you’ve virtually blackmailed one of Slater’s friends to get him there! Things get really awkward for Slaughter later on, though, when he accidentally gives himself away in front of Williams. ‘Your hands!’ gasps the hapless businessman, ‘they have sinews of steel!’ Exit Williams. Portman vows eternal revenge but gives Slaughter a head start after he has confessed to the murder because he’s Taylor’s father. So the villain goes on the lam, accompanied by inconspicuous, one-legged, one-eyed servant Nathaniel (Ben Soutten), and they take refuge at a roadside inn where the barmaid pulls the quickest pints in history.\n\nUnlike the previous two films, this was a brand-new drama written by Frederick Hayward. However, three other writers, including frequent collaborator H F Maltby are also credited. It seems that production was unduly hurried in this instance, and some late rewriting was done to help pick up the pace, which may have resulted in the film coming in short and probably didn’t help with story development and logic. In the end, we discover that Slaughter only ever had fatherly intentions toward Taylor when he breaks jail to save her from the dishonourable intentions of the boorish prison governor, Miles Archer (Gerald Barry). As per usual, things end with Slaughter descending into cackling madness, needlessly confesses to everything and facing off against the forces of law and order behind a gun containing a single bullet. Perhaps investing in better armament in the future should be a priority.\n\nThis film is the weakest of the Slaughter-King output and often feels like a half-baked reheat of elements of ‘Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street’ (1936). The basic story, and particularly the stock characters, were to become a familiar template for their collaborations over the next few years. However, those future projects were better assembled and featured much tidier storytelling. More importantly, they gave Slaughter far greater opportunities to chew the scenery.\n\nA minor example of the ‘blood and thunder’ melodramas delivered by the producer-director and his exuberant star."
