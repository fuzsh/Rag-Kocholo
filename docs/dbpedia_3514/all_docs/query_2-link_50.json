        "text": "It's a bit complicated. When you look at something that has been adapted multiple times, you need to figure out which elements belong to the adaptations and which elements belong to the original.\n\nThe original Sweeney Todd first appeared in 1846 in the penny dreadful The String of Pearls. That Sweeney Todd is public domain and you may do anything you like with it. However, the 1959 ballet, 2007 movie and the 1979 musical are of course copyrighted. So what can you use and what can't you use?\n\nYou can use the character Sweeney Todd. But you may not use elements that were invented by the later versions. For example in your story you may have Sweeney Todd say \"I'll polish him off\" like he did in the original penny dreadful. But you may not have him sing \"My Friend\" which belongs to the copyrighted musical. In terms of the story, I'm not entirely sure, but I think the whole background with Sweeney's wrongful imprisonment, his wife being raped and becoming mad, the judge adopting his daughter and the young sailor falling in love with her, was invented by the musical. Therefore you may not use this part.\n\nBasically, you need to come back to the original and reinvent something new from it rather than write something about the Sweeney Todd most of us know, which is the musical version.\n\nAll that said, if you don't publish, you can write whatever you like. There's no copyright police that will come to your home and fine you because of a manuscript that never left your desk's drawer.\n\nI'm guessing as of the 2000's it's been re copyrighted since other movies were made and then copyrighted for content. My advice, don't make it about Sweeeney Todd specifically. Instead you could make up a character based off of him. Maybe he kills with razors but is a butcher instead of a barber. Or something like that. Rule of thumb, characters are always copyrighted. Actions aren't. I'm sure there are other murderers in fiction and history that baked people into food. Or slit throats with razors. Those things are usually just building blocks. If you aren't specifically using Sweeney Todd, and instead a detective or something trying to solve his case, I think you'll be fine."
