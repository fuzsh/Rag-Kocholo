        "text": "Plot\n\nSweeney Todd (Tod Slaughter) is a barber with a shop near the docks of London.\n\nUsing his charm and tonsorial skills, Todd lures wealthy, respectable customers into his barber-shop at Fleet Street, where he settles them into a mechanical barber's chair which dumps them head-first down into the basement, ready to have their throats cut with a straight-edge, razor-sharp bladeâ€”if the fall does not kill them first.\n\nMrs. Lovatt (Stella Rho), a lady who makes meat-pies next-door, disposes of the bodies for a share of the stolen money.\n\nSweeney Todd has his eye on marrying the daughter (Eve Lister) of a local aristocrat, but her father (D. J. Williams) refuses him. When her lover, Mark (Bruce Seton), returns from an ocean voyage, Todd tries to get him out of the way.\n\nThe fall, however, does not kill Mark, and Mrs. Lovatt hides him, allowing him to escape. When he recovers, he returns in disguise to expose the barber.\n\nRealizing that he has been exposed, Todd sets fire to his shop and is ironically killed by his own hand, setting his trap floor into motion at the end of the film.\n\nCast\n\nTod Slaughter as Sweeney Todd\n\nStella Rho as Mrs. Lovatt\n\nJohn Singer as Tobias Ragg\n\nEve Lister as Johanna Oakley\n\nBruce Seton as Mark Ingerstreet\n\nD. J. Williams as Stephen Oakley\n\nDavina Craig as Nan\n\nJerry Verno as Pearley\n\nGraham Soutten (credited as Ben Souten) as Beadle\n\nBilly Holland as Mr. Parsons\n\nNorman Pierce as Mr. Findlay\n\nAubrey Mallalieu as Trader Paterson\n\nHenry B.
