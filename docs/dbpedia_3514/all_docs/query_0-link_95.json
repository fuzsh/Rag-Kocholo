        "text": "GENRE AND HOLLYWOOD\n\nIn this important new book, Steve Neale provides a comprehensive introduction to genre and Hollywood cinema. He discusses all the major concepts, theories and accounts of Hollywood and genre, and the key genres which theorists and critics have tended to write about—from musicals to horror films, from actionadventure to the western. He also offers detailed revisionist accounts of melodrama and film noir, and puts forward new arguments about the place and importance of genre in understanding Hollywood cinema. Neale argues that many existing accounts of genre and Hollywood have provided a partial and misleading account of Hollywood’s output. He calls for broader and more flexible conceptions of genre and genres, for more attention to be paid to the discourses and practices of Hollywood itself, for the nature and range of Hollywood’s films to be looked at in more detail, and for any assessment of the social and cultural significance of Hollywood’s genres to take account of industrial factors. Assessing the place of genre and genres in new and old Hollywood alike, Neale concludes that genre remains an important means of understanding Hollywood, its history and its films, but that only an expanded conception of genre can account for the variety and nature of its output. Steve Neale is Research Professor in Film, Media and Communication Studies at Sheffield Hallam University.\n\nSIGHTLINES Edited by Edward Buscombe, Southampton Institute and Philip Rosen, Department of Modern Culture and Media, Brown University, USA Cinema Studies has made extraordinary strides in the past two decades. Our capacity for understanding both how and what the cinema signifies has been developed through new methodologies, and hugely enriched in interaction with a wide variety of other disciplines, including literary studies, anthropology, linguistics, history, economics and psychology. As fertile and important as these new theoretical foundations are, their very complexity has made it increasingly difficult to track the main lines of conceptualization. Furthermore, they have made Cinema Studies an ever more daunting prospect for those coming new to the field. Sightlines maps out the ground of major conceptual areas within Cinema Studies. Each volume is written by a recognized authority to provide a clear and detailed synopsis of current debates within a particular topic. Each makes an original contribution to advancing the state of knowledge within the area. Key arguments and terms are clearly identified and explained, seminal thinkers are assessed, and issues for further research are laid out. Taken together, the series constitutes an indispensable chart of the terrain which Cinema Studies now occupies.

While this book has been in press, Rick Altman has published Film/Genre (1999), James Naremore has published More Than Night (1998), and Jonathan Munby has published Public Enemies, Public Heroes (1999). Altman explores a number of innovative ideas about genre in general. Naremore and Munby offer revisionist accounts of film noir and the gangster film respectively. All three take advantage of archival resources that were simply unavailable to those who pioneered the study of genre and genres in the 1960s and 1970s. And all three take on board some of the theoretical and ideological agendas that have been set since then. They show that genre remains as important and productive a means of thinking about Hollywood, its history, its audiences and its films as its pioneers and initial proponents always claimed. But because they each present new research and new thinking, they also help make the point that a fresh assessment of its strengths and weaknesses is long overdue. In keeping with the other volumes in the Sightlines series, Genre and Hollywood is designed to review existing work and to present new ideas and new findings. Striking a balance between the two has not always been easy, particularly because I argue that the conventional wisdom embodied in many existing accounts is often open to question: that conventional definitions of genre are often narrow and restrictive, that traditional accounts of a number of genres are inaccurate or incomplete, that aesthetic and cultural theories of genre are prone to overgeneralization, and that accounts of the role played by genre and genres in Hollywood’s practices, Hollywood’s history and Hollywood’s output are often partial and misleading. Like Richard Maltby (1995:107–43), my own view is that many of these accounts have been driven by critical and theoretical agendas rather than by a commitment to detailed empirical analysis and thorough industrial and historical research. It is also that these accounts are usually underpinned by received definitions of genre, that these definitions are open to question on theoretical grounds, and thus that conceptual and empirical enquiry need, here as elsewhere, to inform one another. It is in conducting these arguments that existing accounts are presented and discussed, and here I have sought to be as comprehensive as I can. Some accounts focus on definitions of genre, some on individual genres, some on the\n\n2 INTRODUCTION\n\ngeneral characteristics of Hollywood’s genres and some on the sociocultural roles they perform as a whole. Other accounts focus on their commercial and industrial basis and on their role in Hollywood’s output, others still on combinations of them all. The topic of genre and Hollywood is clearly multifaceted. I have therefore divided this book into three distinct parts. The first deals with basic definitions and general concepts, the second with individual genres, and the third with theories, descriptions and industrially oriented accounts of Hollywood’s generic array. Part I contains two chapters. The first is concerned with definitions. It focuses on fundamental concepts and points of debate within the context of an historically oriented account of their emergence inside and outside Film Studies. Here the work of major figures like Alloway, Altman, Buscombe, McArthur and Ryall is presented alongside basic concepts like iconography. It is noted that genre, a word meaning ‘type’, a word which is therefore logically applicable to all kinds of cultural forms, tends here to be associated almost exclusively with Hollywood and with mass-oriented commercial culture in general. The origins of this thinking are outlined, and the revisionist ideas of Tudor and Williams in Film Studies and of those working on genre in philosophy, literature and linguistics are presented and discussed. These discussions provide the basis for number of arguments. One is that genre is a multi-dimensional phenomenon, a phenomenon that encompasses systems of expectation, categories, labels and names, discourses, texts and groups or corpuses of texts, and the conventions that govern them all. Another is that genre is ubiquitous, a phenomenon common to all instances of discourse: there is a generic aspect to all texts; all texts ‘participate’, to use Derrida’s term, ‘in one or several genres’ (1992:230). These two arguments dovetail with a third, which is that the concept of genre in Film Studies should logically expand to include categories, corpuses and terms like ‘feature film’ and ‘documentary’ as well as ‘science fiction’, ‘horror’ and ‘western’, and that on these grounds alone most films are multiply generic. The ramifications of these arguments for the traditional notion of ‘the genre film’ are explored and examined at the end of the chapter. Chapter 2 looks in more detail at some of the dimensions of genre identified in Chapter 1. Beginning with the concept of verisimilitude, a concept which focuses on audience expectations and textual norms, Chapter 2 is concerned with the institutional role played by Hollywood and its ‘inter-textual relay’ (Lukow and Ricci 1984) in the generation of expectations, in the provision of generic images, labels, names, and hence in the provision of evidence as to the existence of genres, as to their prevalence in Hollywood’s output at any particular point in time, and as to the meaning, application and use of genre terms. The term ‘intertextual relay’ refers to the discourses of publicity, promotion and reception that surround Hollywood’s films, and includes both trade and press reviews. It is argued that the role of this relay is a crucial one, and the issues raised here are explored by looking at the early westerns and the terms used to describe them,\n\nINTRODUCTION 3\n\nand by debating the arguments put forward by Altman (1987) in favour of a central role for the critic in identifying genres and in constructing on the corpuses of films they each embody and encompass. The issues and arguments raised in Part I provide a framework for the rest of the book. Those concerning the respective roles of Hollywood’s inter-textual relay and of genre theory and criticism form the backdrop to the opening chapter in Part II, Chapter 3, and come to the fore in the chapters that follow. Chapter 3 looks at the major genres critics have identified and discussed at some length. Summaries are provided of work on fourteen genres overall, from ‘actionadventure’ to ‘westerns’. Queries and issues of debate are raised in the process. While the point is made that most of the genres discussed here correspond to those recognized and marked in Hollywood’s inter-textual relay, the point is also made that they frequently hybridize and overlap, thus blurring the boundaries of the genres concerned, and that canons of critical preference, rather than those of empirical or historical enquiry, have often resulted in uneven degrees of attention, discussion and research. Some of the issues at stake here are examined in more detail in Chapter 4, on film noir, and in Chapter 5, on melodrama and the woman’s film. These categories and some of the films with which they are associated have generated an enormous amount of writing and research. However, melodrama and film noir in particular are revealed to be more problematic than is often acknowledged, especially when placed within the context of Hollywood’s inter-textual relay and, in the case of film noir, especially when placed within the context of Hollywood’s output in the 1940s and early 1950s. ‘Film noir’ is a critical category. Despite numerous attempts to exemplify, define and explain it, it is argued here that the category is incoherent, that its proponents fail to provide criteria sufficient to distinguish between those films it includes and those films it excludes, and that its use tends to homogenize a number of distinct historical developments, tendencies and trends. However, as a result of the growing ubiquity of the term, and as a result of the fashion for producing films which draw on its image, it is also argued that film noir now has a generic status it originally did not possess in the past. It is thus a particularly interesting case, posing as it does questions about the nature of genres and about the purposes and effects of critical discourse. As used within Hollywood’s inter-textual relay, the term ‘melodrama’ is shown to have implied action and suspense, to have been used as a synonym for ‘thriller’, rather than applied, as Film Studies has assumed, to the woman’s film. The roots of these meanings and uses are located in the history of melodrama on the stage on the one hand and in the history of Film Studies in Film Studies on the other. It is noted that ‘drama’ rather than ‘melodrama’ was the term used to describe woman’s films, that work on their history may help to pinpoint some of the reasons for this, and that while domestic and romantic dramas—the traditional compartments of the woman’s film—continue to be made, the term ‘woman’s film’ itself has disappeared. Issues are therefore raised, once again,\n\n4 INTRODUCTION\n\nabout generic identity and terminology, about the extent to which critical and industrial terms and definitions can differ from one another, and about the effects these differences can have on our understanding of Hollywood’s output and Hollywood’s history. It is argued that the heritage of nineteenth-century melodrama has been multigeneric and that, as Walker has suggested (1982), it may be best to divide that heritage into ‘melodramas of action’ and ‘melodramas of passion’. While accounts of melodrama in Film Studies have focused on the latter, Hollywood itself has nearly always understood it to refer to the former. Part III focuses on Hollywood’s generic array and on the generic composition of Hollywood’s output. Chapter 6 looks at general accounts of Hollywood’s genres from an aesthetic and socio-cultural point of view. Arguments concerning the formulaic and repetitive nature of Hollywood’s genres are looked at in detail, as are theories and accounts of generic evolution and change. Adopting Altman’s (1987) terminology ‘ritual’ and ‘ideological’ theories of genre, theories which attempt to link Hollywood’s genres to cultural and ideological issues, trends and values, are looked at as well. The point is made that aesthetic and socio-cultural theories alike tend to underplay the elements of discontinuity, diversity and difference in Hollywood’s output, to substitute a number of presumptions and generalizations for detailed empirical research, and therefore in effect if not in intention to isolate that output from the historical and industrial conditions and forces that underpin it. Arguments are made in favour of more specific, more industrially centred and more multi-dimensional forms of analysis. Genre criticism and genre theory are often justified on the grounds that they acknowledge Hollywood’s commercial and industrial nature and on the grounds that the genres they discuss correspond to the trends and divisions in Hollywood’s output. These claims are examined in Chapter 7, which begins by looking at the naure and status of films as industrial commodities, at the conditions this status imposes on production and promotion, and at how these issues relate to genre. Every film is unique. Production and promotion are therefore governed by the need to recognize and celebrate difference as well as by the need to reuse capital assets and to recycle and signal the presence of tried and tested ingredients. These issues underpin the rest of the chapter, which focuses on the industrial role played by genre in the studio era and in the era of what is now usually called The New Hollywood. By looking in detail at Hollywood’s practices, structures and output in the mid-1930s and mid-1980s, traditional generic vocabularies are shown to be inadequate as means of charting Hollywood’s output and of describing many, if not most, of its films. In addition, a number of established tenets, accounts and assumptions are revealed to be misleading. The idea that film companies plan or planned their output in terms which correspond to traditional conceptions of genre is challenged. So too is the idea that they specialized in individual genres for any length of time in the studio era and that allusion and hybridity are features of the post-studio era alone. The strategies of the industry and its companies have always been plural and mixed, marked by an array of categories,\n\nINTRODUCTION 5\n\nformulas and combinations that overlap with, but often exceed, the categories that genre critics and theorists have tended to acknowledge hitherto. In conclusion it is argued that only an expanded conception of genre, of the kind outlined in Chapter 1, can encompass the generic practices of the industry and its inter-textual relay on the one hand, and the diverse cyclic forms, trends, traditions and formulas that mark its productions on the other. More precise and more detailed historically, empirical and industrially informed research is called for. The concept of genre has for some time served as a means to link Hollywood’s practices and Hollywood’s output to Hollywood’s audiences and to the socio-cultural contexts within which its films are produced and consumed. The conclusions drawn here suggest that its utility in all these respects needs to be re-examined, and that there is thus ample scope for more debate, more thinking and more research.\n\nPart I GENRE Definitions and concepts\n\n1 DEFINITIONS OF GENRE\n\n‘Genre’ is a French word meaning ‘type’ or ‘kind’. As we shall see, it has occupied an important place in the study of the cinema for over thirty years, and is normally exemplified (either singly or in various combinations) by the western, the gangster film, the musical, the horror film, melodrama, comedy and the like. On occasion, the term ‘sub-genre’ has also been used, generally to refer to specific traditions or groupings within these genres (as in ‘romantic comedy’, ‘slapstick comedy’, ‘the gothic horror film’ and so on). And sometimes the term ‘cycle’ is used as well, usually to refer to groups of films made within a specific and limited time-span, and founded, for the most part, on the characteristics of individual commercial successes: the cycle of historical adventure films made in the wake of Treasure Island (1934) and The Count of Monte Cristo (1934), for instance (Behlmer 1979:12; Taves 1993a:68–9), or the cycle of ‘slasher’ or ‘stalker’ films made in the wake of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974) and Halloween (1978) (Clover 1992; Dika 1990). As these examples illustrate, the definition and discussion of genre and genres in the cinema has tended to focus on mainstream, commercial films in general and Hollywood films in particular. Sometimes, indeed, genre and genres have been exclusively identified with these kinds of films. ‘Stated simply’, writes Barry Keith Grant, ‘genre movies are those commercial feature films which, through repetition and variation, tell familiar stories with familiar characters in familiar situations.’ ‘They have been exceptionally significant’, he adds, ‘in establishing the popular sense of cinema as a cultural and economic institution, particularly in the United States, where Hollywood studios early on adopted an industrial model based on mass production’ (1986b:ix). However, if (for the moment at least) we accept that genres are simply types or kinds of films, there is no logical reason for excluding either such non-American instances as the Indian mythological, the Japanese samurai film, or the Hong Kong wu xia pan or swordplay film, or such ‘non-commercial’ or non-feature length instances as the documentary, the animated short, the avant-garde film or the art film. Although writing can be found which considers these types of film from a generic point of view, most of the writing on genre and genres in the cinema has focused on the commercial feature film and on Hollywood.1\n\n8 GENRE: DEFINITIONS AND CONCEPTS\n\nThere are a number of reasons for this. Most can be found either in the history of the study of the cinema, or in the history of genre as a concept within the fields of written fiction and drama. Given that this book will also concentrate on the feature film and on Hollywood, it is important to highlight these reasons at the outset, and to expose some of the limitations and problems to which they have given rise. GENRE CRITICISM AND GENRE THEORY IN THE 1960S AND 1970S In her survey of writing on genre in The Cinema Book, Christine Gledhill (1985a: 58) points out that books and articles on individual Hollywood genres began to be published in the US and in Europe (especially in France) in the 1940s and 1950s, notably by Bazin (1971a, 1971b), Chabrol ([1955] 1985), Rieupeyrout (1953) and Warshow ([1948] 1975a, [1954] 1975b). However, it was not until the late 1960s and early 1970s that the study of genre and genres began to establish itself more fully in Britain and in the US, in tandem with the establishment of Film Studies as a formal, academic discipline. As Gledhill goes on to indicate, there were two main reasons for the appearance of genre and genres on the agenda of theorists, critics, and teachers of film at this time. One was a desire to engage in a serious and positive way with popular cinema in general and with Hollywood in particular. The other was a desire to complement, temper or displace altogether the dominant critical approach used hitherto— auteurism. There had always existed reviewers and critics (like James Agee, Manny Farber and Parker Tyler) who had discussed Hollywood films with some sympathy, intelligence and insight. But they had also always been the exception among those who wrote about film in the US and Britain. For the most part, intellectuals, critics and reviewers had been at best patronizing and at worst overtly hostile to Hollywood and its films—on the grounds that they were commercially produced, that they were aimed at a mass market, that they were ideologically or aesthetically conservative, or that they were imbued with the values of entertainment and fantasy rather than those of realism, art or serious aesthetic stylization. During the late 1950s, the 1960s, and the early 1970s, a generation of intellectuals who had grown up with and who for various reasons liked and valued elements of commercial popular culture in general, and American popular culture in particular, began to debate and to re-assess its value.2 By then the French film journal Cahiers du cinema had pioneered an approach to the cinema that Francois Truffaut called ‘la politique des auteurs’ (Truffaut [1954] 1976), and that came in the US and in Britain to be known either as ‘the auteur theory’ (Sarris 1968) or else, more simply, as auteurism. Cahiers’ auteurism was founded on three basic premisses. The first was that despite the ostensibly collective and impersonal nature of film production, the cinema could be, and\n\nDEFINITIONS OF GENRE 9\n\noften was, a realm of individual and personal expression. The second was that in the cinema, the figure equivalent to the artist or author(auteur) in painting or in literature was—or could be—the director. And the third, and by far the most radical, was that directorial artistry and cinematic authorship were to be found not just within the culturally respectable realms of international art cinema (a common idea at that time), nor even, as far as Hollywood was concerned, solely within the realms of the occasional prestige or maverick project (another common idea), but also, perhaps especially, within the realms of its routine output (Hillier 1985b:7). Adapted, modified, reworked in various ways, these premisses were adopted by Andrew Sarris, film critic for The Village Voice in the USA, and by Movie magazine, and later The Brighton Film Review, Monogram and Cinema, in Britain (Caughie 1981). The impact of auteurism on film criticism in general and on the criticism and appreciation of Hollywood films in particular was immense. It enabled both a systematic charting of a great deal of Hollywood’s output, and much detailed discussion of form, style, theme and mise-en-scène. It thus provided those wishing to analyse—and validate— Hollywood cinema with a valuable critical stance and with a valuable set of critical tools. However, given its evaluative base (auteurs were preferred to non-auteurs and to mere ‘metteursen-scène’), and given its commitment to individual directors and hence to individualized corpuses of films, auteurism was of little help in dealing with the range of Hollywood’s output overall, or in charting broader trends and developments within it. Moreover, the third of Cahiers’s premisses in particular required the adoption of a ‘perverse’ attitude to Hollywood, a way of looking at and thinking about its films which neither Hollywood itself nor society at large encouraged. (Hence the tendency of Cahiers in particular and of auteurism in general to lapse into cultishness.) It thus encouraged an approach to Hollywood films which either ignored or defamiliarized their institutional status, their institutional conventions and the audiences to whom they were principally addressed. It is precisely for these reasons that the auteurism of Cahiers, Movie, Sarris and Monogram was—and is—of interest. However, it was for these reasons too that those interested in identifying these conventions and in taking account of the institution and its audiences found untrammelled auteurism unhelpful. Towards the end of the 1960s, they began to turn their attention instead to issues of genre. As Gledhill has pointed out, an American art critic, Lawrence Alloway (1963, 1971), had already made the case for paying more attention to genres and cycles, arguing that they were fundamental not just to Hollywood cinema but to popular art as a whole. ‘Alloway…resists the temptation to establish “classic” timeless dimensions in popular forms’, she writes. ‘He insists on the transitional and ephemeral character of genres, of cycles, and of any individual popular film (1985a:59–60). In an overview of the writing on genre that followed, Tom Ryall restates the case against auteurism and reiterates Alloway’s point about the nature of popular art: ‘The auteur theory, though important and valuable during\n\n10 GENRE: DEFINITIONS AND CONCEPTS\n\nthe 1950s and 1960s for drawing attention to the importance of the American cinema, nevertheless tended to treat popular art as if it were “high art”’ (1975/6: 28). He also makes explicit the importance and the role of the audience. And he offers a definition of genre itself. ‘The master image for genre criticism’, he writes, ‘is a triangle composed of artist/film/audience. Genres may be defined as patterns/forms/ styles/structures which transcend individual films, and which supervise both their construction by the film maker, and their reading by an audience’ (ibid.). I shall return to this definition in a moment. However, at this point it is worth stressing the extent to which Ryall is critical of some of the writing on genre that immediately preceded his own. ‘By and large’, he writes, ‘genre criticism has confined itself to producing taxonomies on the basis of “family resemblances”, allocating films to their position within the generic constellation, stopping short of what are the interesting and informative questions about generic groupings’. (1975/6:27). To a degree these remarks are well-founded. Some of the writing that preceded (and followed) Ryall’s article was indeed taxonomic, devoted to the discovery and analysis of the components of individual genres rather than to the pursuit of theoretical questions about the nature of genre as such. However, while writing of this kind has its limitations, it also has its uses, providing as it does an initial means of ‘collating the range of cultural knowledge…genres assumed’ (Gledhill 1985a:61). Moreover, not all the writing on genre in the late 1960s and early 1970s was taxonomic in kind. Both Buscombe (1970) and McArthur (1972), for instance, were concerned, among other things, to demonstrate the active role played by genre conventions in shaping the form and the meaning of individual Hollywood films. Here, for example, is Buscombe on Guns in the Afternoon (a.k.a. Ride the High Country) (1962), a western: Knowing the period and location, we expect at the beginning to find a familiar western town. In fact, the first few minutes of the film brilliantly disturb expectations. As the camera moves around the town, we discover a policeman in uniform, a car, a camel, and Randolph Scott, dressed up as Buffalo Bill. Each of these images performs a function. The figure of the policeman conveys that the law has become institutionalised; the rough and ready frontier days are over. The car suggests…that the west is no longer isolated from modern technology and its implications. Significantly, the camel is racing against a horse; such a grotesque juxtaposition is painful. A horse in a western is not just an animal but a symbol of dignity, grace and power. These qualities are mocked by it competing with a camel; and to add insult to injury, the camel wins. (Buscombe 1970:44) He later continues:\n\nDEFINITIONS OF GENRE 11\n\nthe essential theme of Guns in the Afternoon is one that, while it could be put into other forms is ideally suited to the one chosen. The film describes the situation of men who have outlived their time… The cluster of images and conventions that we call the western genre is used by Peckinpah [the film’s director] to define and embody this situation, in such a way that we know what the West was and what it has become. The first is communicated through images that are familiar, the second through those that are strange. And together they condition his subject matter. Most obviously, because the film is a western, the theme is worked out in terms of violent action. If it were a musical, the theme might be similar in some way, but because the conventions would be different, it would probably not involve violence… And if it were a gangster picture, it seems unlikely that the effect of the film’s ending, its beautifully elegiac background of autumn leaves, would be reproduced, suggesting as it does that the dead Judd is at one with nature, the nature which seems at the beginning of the film to have been overtaken by ‘civilization’. (Buscombe 1970:44–5) In this particular essay, Buscombe attempts also to advance a general theory about the aesthetic characteristics of popular genres. He borrows the concepts of ‘inner’ and ‘outer’ form from Warren and Welleck, who argued that ‘Genres should be conceived as a grouping of literary works based, theoretically, upon both outer form (specific metre or structure) and also upon inner form (attitude, tone, purpose—more crudely, subject and audience)’ (1956: 260). These particular concepts were not taken up by subsequent writers. But in illustrating the idea of ‘outer form’, Buscombe talked about ‘visual conventions’. His work here thus drew on and fed into a concept that was to become much more influential—the concept of iconography. ICONOGRAPHY Along with its twin, ‘iconology’, the term ‘iconography’ derives from art history, and in particular from the work of Erwin Panofsky. Panofsky himself discussed the application of these terms to popular cinema ([1934] 1974), but it was Lawrence Alloway who sought to apply them in a systematic way to the analysis of genres and cycles (1963). In ‘Iconography and Iconology: An Introduction to the Study of Renaissance Art’, first published in 1938 and reprinted in his Meaning in the Visual Arts, Panofsky distinguishes between three possible levels or stages in the analysis of Renaissance paintings, corresponding to three possible ‘strata’ of meaning (1970: 51–81). The first involves the identification and description of what he calls ‘motifs’ (essentially, the objects and events depicted through lines, colours and volumes). The second involves the identification and description of what he calls ‘images’ (the ‘secondary or conventional’ meanings conveyed by these motifs,\n\n12 GENRE: DEFINITIONS AND CONCEPTS\n\nas determined in particular by reference to the Bible and to other written sources. This for Panofsky is the realm of iconography). And the third involves the interpretation of these images. (This for Panofsky is the realm of iconology.) In arguing for the application of the concept of iconography to the cinema, Alloway writes that The meaning of a single movie is inseparable from the larger pattern of content-analysis of other movies. And the point is, that this knowledge, of concepts and themes, is the common property of the regular audience of the movies. It comes from 1) exposure to runs of related movies (soap opera, westerns) and from the fact that 2) the movies connect with other topical interests and activities of the audience. Such themes as kitchen technology and domestic leisure in soap opera and male outdoor leisure clothes, as well as attitudes towards violence in westerns, exist outside the movies, but aid identification with the movies once you are inside the cinema. (Alloway 1963:5) He precedes this passage with another example, and with another facet of this argument: iconography is not to be isolated from other aspects of film making. For instance, The Thousand Eyes of Dr Mabuse and Rear Window can be related to a persistent theme of American movies since World War II. There were the F.B.I, movies in which the Department of Justice kept spies under observation with a battery of voyeuristic electronic devices. Since The Glass Web television monitor devices of every kind have been brilliantly handled in urban films: for instance, a telephone wired with a bomb, as in The Case Against Brooklyn or the difficulties of telephone tapping in the ‘30s in The Scarface Mob. (Alloway 1963:4–5) It should be noted that ‘iconography’ here tends to mean the objects, events and figures in films, as well as their identification and description. It should also be noted that Alloway tends to avoid interpretation. Partly for this reason, iconology does not even figure as a term. (It tends to disappear altogether in subsequent writing on genre. Only McArthur, in an unpublished paper written in 1973, briefly resurrects both the term and the conceptual distinction Panofsky originally designed it to make.) Finally, it should be pointed out that although Alloway discusses and exemplifies iconography in relation to genres and cycles, he also discusses its application to stars and to star personae. The concept of iconography was widely used by genre theorists and critics during the course of the next decade. There were two main reasons for this. One was the extent to which, in Alloway’s formulation at least, it dovetailed with a\n\nDEFINITIONS OF GENRE 13\n\nsympathetic interest in popular films. The other was the extent to which it could be used to stress the visual aspects of popular films (in keeping with the stress placed on style and mise-en-scène by auteurism, and in contrast to the emphasis placed on character, plot and theme by more literary-minded theorists and critics). Hence Buscombe’s synonym for iconography—‘visual conventions’. Hence his insistence on the argument that ‘Since we are dealing with a visual medium we ought surely to look for our defining criteria on the screen’ (1970: 36). And hence the stress placed on ‘visual conventions’ as well as on the ‘relationship between genre and audience’ in the chapter on the iconography of the ‘gangster film/thriller’ in McArthur’s Underworld USA: In Little Caesar (1930) a police lieutenant and two of his men visit a nightclub run by gangsters. All three wear large hats and heavy coats, are grim and sardonic and stand in triangular formation, the lieutenant in front, his two men flanking him in the rear. The audience knows immediately what to expect of them by their physical attributes, their dress and deportment. It knows, too, by the disposition of the figures, which is dominant, which subordinate. In The Harder They Fall (1956) a racketeer and two of his men go to a rendezvous in downtown New York. As they wait for the door of the building to be opened they take up the same formation as the figures in the earlier film, giving the same information to the audience by the same means… In On the Waterfront (1954) and Tony Rome (1967) there are carefully mounted scenes in which the central figure is walking down a dark and deserted street. In each case an automobile drives swiftly towards him; and the audience, drawing on accumulated experience of the genre, realises that it will be used as a murder weapon against the hero. Both these examples indicate the continuity over several decades of patterns of visual imagery, of recurrent objects and figures in dynamic relationship. These repeated patterns might be called the iconography of the genre. (McArthur 1972:23) McArthur goes on to categorize the genre’s iconography, subdividing the patterns of its imagery into three basic types: ‘those surrounding the physical presence, attributes and dress of the actors and the characters they play; those emanating from the milieux within which the characters operate; and those connected with the technology at the characters’ disposal’ (ibid.: 24). However, it is unclear as to whether this taxonomy is meant to be applicable to other genres as well. It is also unclear as to whether iconography is to be thought of as one of the defining features of a genre. There are certainly traces of such a position in McArthur’s book. He says at one point, for instance, that the iconographic patterns of a genre ‘set it off visually from other types of film and are the means by which primary definitions are made’ (1972:24). However, he himself does not elaborate, and it is Buscombe who comes closest to arguing a position of this kind. Although\n\n14 GENRE: DEFINITIONS AND CONCEPTS\n\nstressing that not all generic conventions are visual in kind, he argues nevertheless that ‘the major defining characteristics of a genre will be visual: guns, cars, clothes in the gangster film; clothing and dancing in musical (apart from the music, of course!); castles, coffins and teeth in horror movies’ (1970: 41). This argument occurs during the course of a much more detailed discussion of the western. Nevertheless, the paucity of these examples (together with the taxonomic tendencies both of genre criticism in general and of iconographic analysis in particular) is strikingly apparent. One of the major reasons for this is that the possible connections between the items (or icons) listed is unclear. Another, more important, reason is that it is actually very difficult to list the defining visual characteristics of more than a handful of genres, for the simple reason that many genres—among them the social problem film, the biopic, romantic drama and the psychological horror film—lack a specific iconography. It is no accident, therefore, that the genres discussed at some length by Buscombe and McArthur are the western and the gangster film, two of the genres which (along with the gothic horror film and the biblical epic) the concept of generic iconography seems to fit rather well. The failure to apply the concept productively to other genres suggests on the one hand that the defining features of Hollywood’s genres may be heterogeneous in kind (some visual, others not). It suggests on the other that a number of fundamental questions—to do with definition, to do with identification, and to do with the nature and role of genre theory—still needed to be asked. They began to be asked first by Tudor (1974a: 131–52, 1974b:180–220) and then by Ryall. They were displaced during the decade that followed as attention was turned to structuralism, to semiotics and to psychoanalysis—to general theories of method and meaning (Stam, Burgoyne and Flitterman-Lewis 1992). Structuralism, in particular, played a part in work on individual genres like the western (notably by Kitses 1969 and Wright 1975). However, although some or all of these theories were to have an impact on writing on genre in the 1980s, notably by Neale (1980) and Altman ([1984] 1986, 1987), and although feminist inflections and reworkings of these approaches were to find an important place in writing on hitherto neglected genres like the woman’s film (see Doane 1987), issues and theories of genre as such were largely put to one side. Hence some of these questions remained unanswered and had to be re-raised, firstly by Alan Williams (1984), and then by Neale (1990a). THEORETICAL QUESTIONS The questions raised by Ryall derive from a distinction he draws between two types of analytical activity: The key to understanding the theoretical foundations of the concept of genre lies in pushing beyond…classificatory exercises and confronting the crucial distinction between, on the one hand suggesting that a film is a Western; and, on the other, suggesting that a film is a genre film. The\n\nDEFINITIONS OF GENRE 15\n\nformer simply involves observing similarities between films, while the latter urges us towards a more generalised theoretical activity in which our conclusions would not merely link one film with another under some category such as ‘Western’; but rather, would link the established genres (Westerns, gangster films, musicals, etc) under the more general concepts of ‘convention’ and ‘expectation’, and would explore the variety of questions associated with the area of ‘reading’ film. (Ryall 1975/6:27) Ryall goes on to note the multi-dimensional aspects of genre, insisting on the importance of audience knowledge and audience expectation on the one hand, and of the industry and film reviewers on the other. It is clear, therefore, that for Ryall genres are not simply groups of films linked by common characteristics. He argues in addition that the problem of defining genre as a term is exacerbated by its pervasiveness: ‘its widespread usage by film distributors, by reviewers and critics, and by popular audiences, poses problems for criticism insofar as ordinary usage carries with it the implication that the concept of genre is clear and well-defined, non-problematic’ (1975/6:27). Similar points are made by Tudor (1974a), who tends both to pursue them further and to raise other issues as well. He begins by raising questions about genre identification and genre recognition: most writers tend to assume that there is some body of films we can safely call the western and then move on to the real work—the analysis of the crucial characteristics of the already recognized genre… These writers, and almost all writers using the term genre, are caught in a dilemma. They are defining a western on the basis of analyzing a body of films that cannot possibly be said to be westerns until after the analysis… To take a genre such as the western, analyze it, and list its principal characteristics is to beg the question that we must first isolate the body of films that are westerns. But they can only be isolated on the basis of the ‘principal characteristics’, which can only be discovered from the films themselves after they have been isolated. That is, we are caught in a circle that first requires that the films be isolated, for which purpose a criterion is necesary, but the criterion is, in turn, meant to emerge from the empirically established common characteristics of the films. This ‘empiricist dilemma’ has two solutions. One is to classify films according to a priori criteria depending on the critical purpose. This leads back to the earlier position in which the special genre term is redundant. The second is to lean on a common cultural consensus as to what constitutes a western and then go on to analyze it in detail. (Tudor 1974a:135–8)\n\n16 GENRE: DEFINITIONS AND CONCEPTS\n\nThis is a fundamental point. It raises questions about the nature and purpose of genre criticism. And, implicitly at least, it raises questions as to how ‘a common cultural consensus’ is established. What agencies and institutions are involved? What is the role of the film industry? What is the role of film critics, film reviewers and the like? On the one hand it helps underline Ryall’s point about the importance of distributors, reviewers and critics. On the other it helps stress the culturally relative, and therefore the culturally contingent, nature of genres themselves: In short to talk about the western is (arbitrary definitions apart) to appeal to a common set of meanings in our culture. From a very early age most of us have built up a picture of the western. We feel that we know a western when we see one, though the edges may be rather blurred. Thus in calling a film a western a critic is implying more than the simple statement ‘This film is a member of a class of films (westerns) having in common x, y, and z.’ The critic is also suggesting that such a film would be universally recognized as such in our culture. In other words, the crucial factors that distinguish a genre are not only characteristics inherent in the films themselves; they also depend on the particular culture with which we are operating. And unless there is a world consensus on the subject (which is an empirical question), there is no basis for assuming that a western will be received in the same way in every culture. The way in which the genre term is applied can quite conceivably vary from case to case. Genre notions —except in the case of arbitrary definition—are not critics’ classifications made for special purposes; they are sets of cultural conventions. Genre is what we collectively believe it to be. (Tudor 1974a:139) The stress here on culture and cultures, rather than just on films, leads Tudor, like Ryall, to stress the role and the importance of audiences too. And this leads him in turn (and for the first time in work on genre and genres in the cinema) not just outside the realm of Hollywood but outside the realms of mainstream cinema altogether: the genre concept is indispensable in more strictly social and psychological terms as a way of formulating the interplay between culture, audience, films and filmmakers. For example, there is a class of films thought by a relatively highly educated middle-class group of filmgoers as ‘art movies’ [Tudor goes on to cite The Seventh Seal (1956), L’Avventura (1960) and La Dolce Vita (1959) as examples]. Now for the present purposes genre is a conception existing in the culture of any particular group or society; it is not a way in which a critic classifies films for methodological purposes, but the much looser way in which an audience classifies its films. According to this meaning of the term, ‘art movies’ is a genre.\n\nDEFINITIONS OF GENRE 17\n\n(Tudor 1974a:145) Thus, to reiterate, ‘there does not seem to me to be any crucial difference between the most commonly applied genre term—the western—and the artmovie that I have been discussing. They are both conceptions held by certain groups about certain films’ (ibid.: 147). It is here, in including art films under the rubric of genre, and in defining genres as ‘conceptions’, that Tudor departs most radically from most of the ideas and definitions of genre in the cinema advanced hitherto. The questions he asks are radical ones. They challenge conventional notions as to the cinematic and cultural site of genre and genres. They open up the issue of groupings and classification. And they place spectatorial and audience activity and the cultural and institutional contexts within which that activity takes place firmly at the centre of theoretical debate. To that extent they are echoed not just by Williams and Neale, but also by a number of linguists, philosophers and literary theorists who have written on genre in recent years. LITERATURE, LINGUISTICS AND GENRE On a number of occasions in the 1960s and 1970s, writers on genre in the cinema referred to definitions and theories of genre in literature. Some, like Cawelti (1976), made use of particular literary theories (in Cawelti’s case, those of Frye 1957). However, while the existence of literary theory was explicitly acknowledged, it was in practice usually ignored. One of the reasons for this, as Ryall points out, was the apparent discrepancy between generic terms and ‘divisions’ in literature, and the terms and divisions familiar to critics and theorists of the cinema: As well as the widespread usage within film, the critic also has to contend with the term as it occurs in the discussion of other arts, notably literature where genre divisions have been made on the basis of formal distinctions (the novel, drama, poetry) compared with the subject or content divisions more usual in film criticism. The term, therefore, while having an apparent stability within the discussion of film becomes somewhat confusing in the context of, for example, genre definitions in literature. (Ryall 1975/6:27) Hence while Buscombe, for instance, referred in passing to the divisions in Aristotle’s Poetics between ‘tragedy, epic, lyric, and so forth’ (1970:33), they were effectively forgotten by the time he turned to the gangster film, the western and the musical. It was not until 1984 that this discrepancy was re-raised and discussed as an issue, during the course of Williams’s review of Schatz’s Hollywood Genres (1981):\n\n18 GENRE: DEFINITIONS AND CONCEPTS\n\nPerhaps the biggest problem with genre or genre criticism in the field of the cinema is the word genre. Borrowed, as a critical tool, from literary studies (or at least having resonances from that area—the word does have a life of its own in the film industry) the applicability of ‘genre’ as a concept in film studies raises some fairly tough questions. Sample genres are held to be Westerns, Science Fiction Films, more recently Disaster Films, and so on. What do these loose groupings of works—that seem to come and go, for the most part, in ten- and twenty-year cycles—have to do with familiar genres such as tragedy, comedy, romance, or (to mix the pot up a bit) the epistolary novel or the prose poem? (A.Williams 1984:121) Williams continues: For the phrase ‘genre films’, referring to a general category, we can frequently, though not always, substitute ‘film narrative’. Perhaps that is the real genre. Certainly there is much more difference between Prelude to Dog Star Man and Star Wars than there is between the latter and Body Heat. It’s mainly a question of terminology, of course, but I wonder if we ought to consider the principal film genres as being the narrative film, experimental/avant-garde film, and documentary. Surely these are the categories in film studies that have among themselves the sorts of significant differences that one can find between, say, epic and lyric poetry. (A.Williams 1984:121) The first point to make in response to this is to highlight the extent to which genres and genre categories in literature are by no means always as systematically coherent or long-lived as Williams—or Ryall—seem to suggest. Comedy, romance and tragedy are long-lived as terms, but the criteria that define them, along with the types of work they encompass, have in each case changed over time (see Beer 1970 on romance, and Koelb 1975 on tragedy). Moreover, comedy and romance, at least, are familiar as terms and as genres to critics and theorists of film. In addition, the criteria that define, say, the epistolary novel and epic poetry on the one hand and comedy and romance on the other are very different in kind, varying from the purely formal (in the case of the epistolary novel), to a mix of criteria involving form, content and tone (in the case of most of the others). And to switch the focus of the argument, the western and science fiction are both literary genres as well as cinematic ones. Even the disaster film of the late 1960s and early 1970s has its analogue—indeed its origins—in contemporary novels written by Arthur Hailey, Paul Gallico, Richard Martin Stern, and others. This leads me to a second point, a point that is crucial for understanding why genre and genres have so often been identified with Hollywood (rather than, say, the art film), and hence why some of the contradictions and discrepancies to\n\nDEFINITIONS OF GENRE 19\n\nwhich Williams points have arisen. Within a great deal of modern writing on literature, the kind of fiction exemplified by disaster novels and science fiction is often the only kind labelled as generic. The rest is ‘literary fiction’ or simply ‘literature’ proper. The latter is the province of ‘genuine’ literary art and ‘authentic’ authorial expression. The former, by contrast, is usually considered formulaic, stereotypical, artistically anonymous, and therefore artistically worthless. Hence the following, from Sutherland’s Fiction and the Fiction Industry: Another feature of the increasingly ‘packaged’ nature of all fiction— including the quality novel—is the advance of ‘genre’ or the categorised product. By ‘genre’ is meant such forms as Science Fiction, the detective novel, Gothic, etc…. Genre incorporates a high ration of familiar to strange elements. Habitually it eliminates the bewilderment associated with avant garde and experimentalism. It specialises in books without shock. If, as Ezra Pound says, the modernist’s motto is ‘make it new’ then the genre author’s motto is ‘make it the same’… Genre fiction is, characteristically, conventiongoverned… There is a soothing quality to much genre fiction; a high incidence of what Q.D.Leavis calls ‘living at the novelist’s expense’… generally the material is bland, despite its claims to unbearable excitement. Similarly genre may have a superficially impressive specialised knowledge… But in the end there will be nothing to task the reader’s capacities. (Sutherland 1978:192–4. For a very different view, see Bloom 1996.) It will be readily apparent that those writing on Hollywood’s genres in the 1960s and 1970s decisively rejected—indeed often symmetrically inverted—the values and judgement evident in a passage like this. McArthur, for instance, argues that genre conventions can play a positive role in curbing authorial ‘excess and selfindulgence’ (1972:94). However, the point to emphasize here is that they share its definitions and its terms, and that these definitions and terms, along with the values and judgements of someone like Sutherland, have a distinct and particular history. As Kress and Threadgold have pointed out: Genre is valorised very differently in different contexts. From the Romantics through modernism to postmodernism, genre is a devalued term in the dominant literary/aesthetic discourse. To be ‘generic’ is to be predictable and clichéd; within that ideology, literature and art generally has to be free, creative, individual…hence literature cannot be generic… In classical periods, for example the English Neo-classical period in the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries, or even before then in the Renaissance, the reverse was the case. Literature had to be generic to be considered literature (consider Dryden’s famous essay on Dramatic\n\n20 GENRE: DEFINITIONS AND CONCEPTS\n\nPoesy), and notions of genre were so intimately tied up with what was to be literature that they overtly and in very conscious ways affected both the reading and writing of literary texts. (Kress and Threadgold 1988:219–20) Threadgold reiterates these points elsewhere, stressing the role of conceptions of genre within and across the cultural divisions in artistic practice, in particular those between ‘high’ and ‘low’, ‘popular’ and ‘elite’: Before Romanticism what was Generic was Literature. The rest, the ‘popular culture’ of political pamphlets, ballads, romances, chapbooks, was not only not generic; it escaped the law of genre, was excluded by that law, suffering a kind of rhetorical exclusion by inclusion in the classical distinction between high, middle, and low styles. It was seen as a kind of anarchic, free area, unconstrained by the rules of polite society and decorum, by genre in fact. (Threadgold 1989:121–2) Thus genre has undergone ‘a fundamental shift of positioning’ (ibid.: 120). And this shift runs parallel with shifts both in cultural and aesthetic production and consumption, and in the history of the term ‘genre’ itself. As Cohen has pointed out, the use of the term in English to refer to aesthetic practices and products is a nineteenth-century phenomenon (1986:203). Thus although the concept is clearly much older, the term itself emerges with industrialization, mass production, new technologies, new capital, new means of distribution (notably postal systems and the railways), the formation of a relatively large literate (or semi-literate) population—and hence a potential market—at a point of profound transformation in the conditions governing cultural production and the discourses and debates with which it was accompanied.3 Now it is the new popular culture, the new mass culture that is marked—with a new term—as ‘generic’. Repetitive patterns, ingredients and formulae are now perceived by many cultural commentators not as the law of Culture, but as the law of the market. It is therefore hardly surprising that genre was—and still is—principally associated with an industrial, commercial and mechanically based art like the cinema, and with its most obviously industrial, commercial and popular sectors like Hollywood in particular. And it is thus particularly important to consider ideas, definitions and theories of genre which challenge conventional conceptions. One source of and for such ideas is the literary critic E.D.Hirsch (a surprising source, perhaps, given his commitment to traditional literary values). Hirsch insists on the fundamental role played by genre—not just in the framing and interpretation of works of art but also in the framing and interpretation of any kind of utterance. He also insists on the fact that genres centrally include—even consist of—a set of expectations. A reader’s or interlocutor’s ‘preliminary generic conception’, he writes, ‘is constitutive of everything that he subsequently\n\nDEFINITIONS OF GENRE 21\n\nunderstands,…and this [always] remains the case unless and until that generic conception is altered’ (1967:74). In elaborating this view at greater length, Hirsch makes clear that genre in this sense is as much a phenomenon of everyday discourse as it is of literary texts: quite apart from the speaker’s choice of words, and, even more remarkably, quite aside from the context in which the utterance occurs, the details of meaning that an interpreter understands are powerfully determined and constituted by his meaning expectation. And these expectations arise from the interpreter’s conception of the type of meaning that is being expressed. By ‘type of meaning’ I do not, of course, intend to imply merely a type of message or theme or anything so simple as content. The interpreter’s expectations embrace far more than that. They include a number of elements that may not even be explicitly given in the utterance or its context, such as the relationship assumed to exist between the speaker and the interpreter, the type of vocabulary and syntax that is used, the type of attitude adopted by the speaker, and the type of inexplicit meanings that go with explicit ones. Such expectations are always necessary to understanding, because only by virtue of them can the interpreter make sense of the words he experiences along the way. He entertains the notion that ‘this is a certain type of meaning,’ and his notion of the meaning as a whole grounds and helps determine his understanding of details. This fact reveals itself whenever a misunderstanding is suddenly recognized. After all, how could it have been recognized unless the interpreter’s expectations had been thwarted? How could anything surprising or puzzling occur to force a revision of his past understanding unless the interpreter had expectations that could be surprised or thwarted? Furthermore, these expectations could have arisen only from the genre idea: ‘In this type of utterance, we expect these types of traits.’ (Hirsch 1967:72–3) During the course of his discussion of genre, Hirsch draws in particular on the structural linguistics of Saussure ([1959] 1974). Issues of genre and parallels with Hirsch’s position have been more apparent, however, in speech act theory and pragmatics. Speech-act theory and pragmatics are branches of linguistics and of analytical philosophy, respectively. They are both concerned with language in use, and in particular with the rules and conventions that govern the production, reception and comprehension of specific kinds of linguistic utterance in specific kinds of context.4 Mary Louise Pratt (1977), for instance, has written a pioneering book on speech-act theory and literature stressing the generic aspects of all forms of discourse, indeed of ‘literature’ as such. More recently, in an essay on the short story, she highlights the role, importance and ubiquity of genre in literary and in non-literary discourse alike. ‘Genre is not solely a literary matter’, she writes. ‘The concept of genres applies to all verbal behavior, in all\n\n22 GENRE: DEFINITIONS AND CONCEPTS\n\nrealms of discourse. Genre conventions are in play in any speech situation, and any discourse belongs to a genre, unless it is a discourse explicitly designed to flaunt the genre system’ (1981:176). Speech-act-oriented theories of genre have recently been drawn on (and sometimes modified, extended or criticized, though always from within a recognizable similar ambit of concerns) by Derrida (1992), Freadman (1988), Hunter (1989), Reid (1989) and Ryan (1981). Derrida criticizes speech-act theories of genre on the grounds that texts can always exceed specific expectations, contexts and labels. He would therefore contest Pratt’s notion that texts ‘belong’ to genres. He would also deny, though, that any text or instance of discourse could ever escape being generic. A text or an instance of discourse might be able to ‘flaunt’ a particular ‘genre system’, but they could never flaunt the ‘law of genre’ as such, for the simple reason that all texts, all utterances, all instances of discourse are always encountered in some kind of context, and are therefore always confronted with expectations, with systems of comprehension, and in all probability with labels and names. Freadman gives a good example of this: When the title ‘Untitled’ started appearing beneath paintings, it corresponded to the claim of abstract painting to be non-representational: to be ‘painting’, simply… It is a title that represents the nonrepresentational. Now, since the titles of paintings—place-names, personal names, the names of historical or legendary events, or kinds of subjects— designate not only their represented subjects but also, through the naming conventions themselves, their genres, the title ‘Untitled’ claims above all to transcend genre. Reflect on this. For ‘untitled’ paintings are themselves a genre; and the title ‘Untitled’ points to genre in the very act of its denial. (Freadman 1988:67) A less spectacular example from the cinema would be a film like Un Chien Andalou (1928), which certainly flaunted the genre system predominant in Europe at the time it was made. It also flaunted the genre ‘narrative feature film’, and the genres of the contemporary European art film. One of its makers, Luis Buñuel, claimed it was not even an instance of avant-garde filmmaking, but rather ‘a desperate appeal to murder’ (Aranda 1975:63). However, it is precisely for all these reasons that it is usually now understood, and now usually labelled generically, as an exemplary instance of Surrealism. Hence, to return to Derrida, ‘Every text participates in one or several genres, there is no genreless text.’ Although ‘participation never amounts to belonging’, ‘there is always a genre or genres’ (1992:230). Derrida’s use of the phrase ‘one or several genres’, his stress on the possible plurality of generic participation, may not resolve the discrepancies between some of the genre terms used in literary studies and the terms that tend to dominate the study of the cinema. (Such discrepancies are historical in origin, and are thus not\n\nDEFINITIONS OF GENRE 23\n\nentirely susceptible to logical or conceptual resolution.) But it does point to a way of resolving Williams’ dilemma about ‘real’ genres, and the validity of categories like the western and science fiction on the one hand, and ‘narrative film, experimental/avant-garde film, or documentary’ on the other. For from a Derridean perspective, this dilemma is ultimately false. Any film (like any text, utterance or instance of representation) can participate in several genres at once. In fact, it is more common than not for a film to do so. Thus, without trying to be too exhaustive (and leaving aside for the moment the issue of overt generic hybrids), both Star Wars (1977) and Body Heat (1981), to use two of Williams’ (1984) examples, participate in the genres ‘film’, ‘fiction film’, ‘Hollywood film’ and ‘narrative feature film’. The former also participates in the genre ‘science fiction’, and the latter in the genre ‘thriller’ (and possibly also ‘neonoir’). Prelude to Dog Star Man (1965), meanwhile, participates in the genres ‘film’ and ‘avant-garde/experimental film’—and also, for some of its viewers at least, the genres ‘mythopoeic’ and/or ‘visionary film’, categories first suggested by the influential critic and historian of American avant-garde film, P.Adams Sitney (1979). While challenging traditional definitions of genre, it is worth noting that there remains a degree of common ground between speech-act-oriented theorists like Pratt, Hirsch and Derrida and theorists like Tudor and Ryall. All agree that genre is a multi-dimensional phenomenon and that its dimensions centrally include systems of expectation, categories, labels and names, discourses, texts and corpuses of texts, and the conventions that govern them all. Some stress the primacy of expectations, others the primacy of texts, still others the primacy of categories, corpuses, the norms they encompass, the traditions they embody and the formulae that mark them. What seems clear is that all these dimensions need to be taken into account. What also seems clear is that they need to be distinguished one from another. However, the argument that genre is ubiquitous, a phenomenon common to all instances of discourse, ignores or collapses the distinction between those instances which are relatively formulaic, relatively predictable, relatively conventional, and those which are not, between those produced in accordance with the conventions of a pre-signalled genre or genre system and those designed to flaunt them. It also ignores or collapses the boundaries between different ways of categorizing texts and of grouping expectations. The expectations triggered by the name of a star or director are as generic as those triggered by terms like ‘western’, ‘thriller’ or ‘horror film’. One would normally want, though, to distinguish between the two. These boundaries and distinctions underlie a great deal of traditional thinking about genres. They have often been tied, as we have seen, to issues of evaluation. They have often been linked to the establishment of aesthetic and cultural hierarchies. And they have often inhibited the development of genre theory. However, while it is important to question traditional thinking and to expand the definition, the meaning and the field of application of genre as a\n\n24 GENRE: DEFINITIONS AND CONCEPTS\n\nterm, it is also important to recognize the differences these boundaries and distinctions serve to mark. GENRE AND THE GENRE FILM One way of acknowledging some of these differences without falling into the usual conceptual or cultural traps is to note that they apply to high art as well as to low: a sonnet is formulaic in a way that free verse is not; a Restoration comedy is conventional in a way that a modernist novel is not; and so on. In addition, it should be noted that when Warshow talked about the pleasures and characteristics of aesthetic ‘types’, he was referring to Restoration comedy and Elizabethan tragedy as well as to westerns and gangster films: ‘For a type to be successful’, he wrote its conventions have imposed themselves upon the general consciousness and become the vehicle of a particular set of attitudes and a particular aesthetic effect. One goes to any individual example of the type with very definite expectations, and originality is to be welcomed only in the degree that it intensifies the expected experience without fundamentally altering it. (Warshow [1948] 1975a:129–30) Within the realms of cinema, numerous movements or trends in art cinema and in avant-garde film-making are or become as predictable (and as typically pleasurable) as any Hollywood western. However, and conversely, there is a difference between academic or programmatic aesthetic formulae and formulae which arise as a result of commercial conditions. And there is a difference between films which are designed to conform, however broadly, to pre-existing categories, expectations and models, and those, like Un Chien Andalou, which are not. The latter may encounter expectations and those expectations may be based on previous films or on the tenets of a movement or a group. They may conform to labels or descriptions circulated in advance by critics, distributors, reviewers, perhaps even film-makers themselves. And they may all establish their own internal norms and hence become more familiar—and more predictable —as they unfold. But many of these norms are often unique to the films themselves. Thus the films are less predictable in advance, and at more or less every level. That does not necessarily make them better. But it does make them different. Altman makes a further distinction. He points out that not all films engage spectators’ generic knowledge in the same way and to the same extent. While some films simply borrow devices from established genres, others foreground their generic characteristics to the point where the genre concept itself plays a major role in the film.\n\nDEFINITIONS OF GENRE 25\n\n(Altman 1996a:279) Parodies are an obvious instance of the latter, as Altman goes on to indicate. So too are films like Silverado (1985), Chinatown (1974), Scarface (1983) and Back to the Future III (1990), films which pastiche, rework or in other ways foreground particular generic traditions, norms and conventions. Altman, following Schatz (1981:16–18), goes on to propose two different terms, ‘film genre’ and ‘genre film,’ in order to mark this particular distinction: By definition, all films belong to some genre(s)…but only certain films are self-consciously produced and consumed according to (or against) a specific generic model. When the notion of genre is limited to descriptive uses, as it commonly is when serving…classification purposes, we speak of ‘film genre’. However, when the notion of genre takes on a more active role in the production and consumption process, we appropriately speak instead of ‘genre film’, thus recognizing the extent to which generic identification becomes a formative component of film viewing. (Altman 1996a:277) While these terms and definitions are useful, Altman here tends to conflate genre as a category and genre as a corpus of films: Stagecoach (1939) is both a singular instance of the category ‘western’ and part of an expanding corpus that includes films like Hell’s Hinges (1916), Riders of the Range (1923), Bend of the River (1952), El Dorado (1967) and Tombstone (1993). The two are distinct. He also tends, through the term ‘self-conscious’, to conflate routine generic production and routine generic consumption, both of which entail specific generic models and in both of which such models are ‘active’, with special and particular instances like parody and pastiche. In addition, he tends to imply that the activation of a generic model necessarily entails conformity or participation. But a model may be invoked in order to be reworked or rejected altogether, as is arguably the case with some of the ‘revisionist’ films of the late 1960s and early 1970s—films like Chinatown, The Long Goodbye (1973) and Buffalo Bill and the Indians (1976)—which rework or reject existing models of the detective film and the western, and as is certainly the case with Un Chien Andalou, which both invokes and decisively rejects the model of the contemporary narrative film. For all these reasons, the proposed term ‘genre film’ tends to evoke traditional definitions, thereby potentially reducing the multiplicity and scope of the phenomenon of genre itself. In order to avoid some of these problems, and in order to take some account of speech-act-oriented thinking, terms like ‘generically marked film’ and ‘generically modelled film’ might be preferable. The former would indicate films which rely on generic identification by an audience—and hence specific forms of audience knowledge—in order to make sense. (This would include parody, pastiche and other forms of selfconsciousness. But it would also include less specialized instances as well.) The\n\n26 GENRE: DEFINITIONS AND CONCEPTS\n\nlatter would indicate films which draw on and conform to existing generic traditions, conventions and formulae. In practice, of course, the two often overlap. But the former refers more to the moment of reception, and may include instances of generic reworking and generic rejection as well as instances of generic conformity. The latter refers to the moment of production, and by definition excludes generic rejection. Both remain distinct from genre as a category, and genre as a group or corpus of films. What emerges from this overview is that genre as a term has been used in different ways in different fields, and that many of its uses have been governed by the history of the term within these fields—and by the cultural factors at play within them—rather than by logic or conceptual consistency. The questions raised by Ryall, Tudor and Williams are important ones, as are the questions raised by speech-act theory and pragmatics. The answers to these questions require thinking of genres as ubiquitous, multifaceted phenomena rather than as one-dimensional entities to be found only within the realms of Hollywood cinema or of commercial popular culture. Only then can some of the pitfalls identified by Ryall, by Tudor, by Williams and by others be avoided. And only then can the nature, the functions, and the general topic of genre in Hollywood itself be examined in more detail.

No longer the sole or even the principal site of genre in the cinema, Hollywood instead becomes just one particular site, its genres specific instances—not necessarily paradigms—of a much more general phenomenon. Genre in Hollywood also expands. It now encompasses ‘the feature film’, ‘the newsreel’, ‘the cartoon’, ‘the B film’, ‘the A film’ and ‘the serial’ as well as—and often at the same time as—‘the western’, ‘the musical’, ‘the gangster film’ and the others. In addition, the argument that genre is multidimensional means that attention now needs to be paid as much to the factors that impinge on audience expectations, the construction of generic corpuses, and the processes of labelling and naming as to those that impinge on the films themselves. This chapter will pursue some of these points, and in doing so will introduce a number of further concepts, terms and topics of debate. The first of these is verisimilitude. VERISIMILITUDE To reiterate an earlier point. Genres do not consist solely of films. They consist also of specific systems of expectation and hypothesis which spectators bring with them to the cinema and which interact with films themselves during the course of the viewing process. These systems provide spectators with means of recognition and understanding. They help render individual films, and the elements within them, intelligible and, therefore, explicable. They offer a way of working out the significance of what is happening on the screen: a way of working out why particular actions are taking place, why the characters are dressed the way they are, why they look, speak and behave the way they do, and so on. Thus if a character in a film suddenly bursts into song, spectators (or at least spectators accustomed to Hollywood films) are likely to hypothesize that the film is a musical, a particular kind of film in which otherwise unmotivated singing is likely to occur. This hypothesis offers grounds for further anticipation: if a film is a musical, more singing is likely, and the plot is liable to follow some directions rather than others.\n\n28 GENRE: DEFINITIONS AND CONCEPTS\n\nInasmuch as this is the case, these systems of expectation and hypothesis involve a knowledge of, indeed they partly embody, various regimes of verisimilitude—various systems and forms of plausibility, motivation and belief. ‘Verisimilitude’ means ‘probable’, ‘plausible’ or ‘likely’. In addition, it entails notions of propriety, of what is appropriate and therefore probable (or probable and therefore appropriate) (Brewster 1987; Genette 1969; Todorov 1977:42–52, 80–8, 1981:118–19. See also Aumont et al. 1992: 117–21). Regimes of verisimilitude vary from genre to genre. Bursting into song is appropriate, therefore probable—therefore believable—in a musical, but not in a war film or a thriller. Killing one’s lover is possible in a gangster film, a thriller, or even a romantic drama, but unlikely in romantic comedy. And so on. As such, these regimes entail rules, norms and laws. Singing in a musical is not just probable, it is obligatory; it is not just likely to occur, it is bound to. As Todorov (1981) has pointed out, there are two basic types of verisimilitude: generic verisimilitude, on the one hand, and social or cultural verisimilitude on the other. Neither equates in any direct sense with ‘reality’ or ‘truth’: If we study the discussions bequeathed us by the past, we realize that a work is said to have verisimilitude in relation to two chief kinds of norms. The first is what we call rules of the genre: for a work to be said to have verisimilitude, it must conform to these rules. In certain periods, a comedy is judged ‘probable’ only if, in the last act, the characters are discovered to be near relations. A sentimental novel will be probable if its outcome consists in the marriage of hero and heroine, if virtue is rewarded and vice punished. Verisimilitude, taken in this sense, designates the work’s relation to literary discourse: more exactly, to certain of the latter ’s subdivisions, which form a genre. But there exists another verisimilitude, which has been taken even more frequently for a relation with reality. Aristotle, however, has already perceived that the verisimilar is not a relation between discourse and its referent (the relation of truth), but between discourse and what readers believe is true. The relation is here established between the work and a scattered discourse that in part belongs to each of the individuals of a society but of which none may claim ownership; in other words to public opinion. The latter is of course not ‘reality’ but merely a further discourse, independent of the work. (Todorov 1981:118–19) Drawing on Todorov’s work, Jonathan Culler has gone on to propose five types of verisimilitude, five levels of vraisemblance, five ways in which a text may be brought into contact with and defined in relation to another text which helps make it intelligible. First there is the\n\nDIMENSIONS OF GENRE 29\n\nsocially given text, that which is taken as the ‘real world’. Second, but in some cases difficult to distinguish from the first, is a general cultural text: shared knowledge which would be recognized by participants as part of culture and hence subject to correction or modification but which none the less serves as a kind of ‘nature’. Third there are the texts or conventions of a genre… Fourth, comes what might be called the natural attitude to the artificial, where the text explicitly cites and exposes vraisemblance of the third kind so as to reinforce its own authority. And finally, there is the complex vraisemblance of specific intertextualities, where one work takes another as its basis or point of departure and must be assimilated in relation to it. (Culler 1975:140) Culler cites the detective story to illustrate the workings of generic vraisemblance, highlighting in addition the extent to which generic conventions are as much a property of expectations as they are of works themselves: The detective story is a particularly good example of the force of genre conventions: the assumption that characters are psychologically intelligible, that the crime has a solution which will eventually be revealed, that the relevant evidence will be given but that the solution will be of some complexity, are all essential to the enjoyment of such books. In fact, these conventions are especially interesting because of the large place they grant to the irrelevant. It is only at the level of the solution that coherence is required: everything deviant and suspicious must be explained by the resolution which produces the key to the ‘real’ pattern, but all other details can at this point be set aside as of no consequence. The conventions make possible the adventure of discovering and producing a form, of finding the pattern amid a mass of details, and they do so by stipulating what kind of pattern one is reading towards. (Culler 1975:148) Todorov (1977) also uses the detective story, and what he calls ‘the murder mystery’, to illustrate the concept of verisimilitude. One of the major points he makes is that the generic verisimilitude of the murder mystery entails a flaunting or trangression of cultural (or ‘ordinary’) verisimilitude, the second of Culler’s categories of vraisemblance: We find the same ‘regularity’ in any whodunit; a crime has been committed, the criminal must be found. Given several isolated clues, a whole is reconstructed. But the law of reconstruction is never the law of verisimilitude; on the contrary, precisely the obvious suspects turn out to be innocent, and the innocent are ‘suspect.’ The guilty man in a murder mystery is the man who does not seem guilty. In his summing up, the\n\n30 GENRE: DEFINITIONS AND CONCEPTS\n\ndetective will invoke a logic which links the hitherto scattered clues; but such logic derives from a scientific notion of possibility, not from one of verisimilitude. The revelation must obey these two imperatives: possibility and absence of verisimilitude. (Todorov 1977:85) Hence, if ‘every discourse enters into a relation of verisimilitude with its own laws, the murder mystery takes verisimilitude for its very theme; verisimilitude is not only its law but also its object’ (ibid.: 85). The detective story and the murder mystery may well be special cases, instances in which the relationship, and in particular the gap, between generic and socio-cultural regimes of verisimilitude are brought to the fore in a systematic way. But as Culler points out, the vraisemblance of any artistic genre is always ‘artificial’ (1975:140). This particular relationship and this particular gap are therefore always at stake, always in play. They are always at stake, for instance, in the musical, at those moments and points at which characters burst into otherwise unmotivated song. And they are always at stake, as Frank Krutnik and I have argued, in the comic events and moments that dominate most forms of comedy (Neale and Krutnik 1990:83–94). Such events and such moments are founded on transgressions and gaps of this kind, whether they involve deviations from the norms of sense and logic, or departures from dominant cultural models of action, speech and behaviour. It is arguably the case that most Hollywood genres, as traditionally defined, involve transgressions of socio-cultural verisimilitude—for the sake of particular kinds of aesthetic pleasure (as derived, for instance, from the song or from the gag), and in the name not of ‘art’, but entertainment. Nevertheless, there is in any individual genre always a balance between generic and sociocultural verisimilitude, and some genres appeal more to the latter than to the former. Gangster films, war films and police procedural thrillers in particular often mark that appeal by drawing on and quoting ‘authentic’ (or authenticating) discourses, artefacts, and texts: maps, newspaper headlines, memoirs, archival documents, and so on. Other genres—sword-and-sorcery adventure films, space operas and supernatural horror films, for instance—appeal much less to this kind of authenticity. The discourses, artefacts and texts that they cite—like the Book of Revelations in The Omen (1974) or the lore of the Jedi in the Star Wars films— tend either to be blatantly fictional or else treated as such within our culture. Midway between these extremes lie such instances of science fiction as Tarantula (1955) and Them (1954), films which draw on the authentic, factual and verisimilitudinous status of science (and contemporary atomic technology) in order to motivate otherwise non-verisimilitudinous actions and events. Of particular relevance here is Todorov’s work on ‘the fantastic’ (1975), a category founded on the existence of different regimes of verisimilitude. For Todorov the fantastic is defined in relation to two neighbouring categories, ‘the marvellous’ and ‘the uncanny’. In the former, events are explained and\n\nDIMENSIONS OF GENRE 31\n\nunderstood as supernatural, in the latter in terms of the laws of the natural world. The fantastic involves a ‘hesitation’ between the two, often on the part of a fictional protagonist, but crucially always on the part of the reader: In a world which is indeed our world, the one we know, a world without devils, sylphides, or vampires, there occurs an event which cannot be explained by the laws of this same familiar world. The person who experiences the event must opt for two possible solutions: either he is the victim of an illusion of the senses, of a product of the imagination—and the laws of the world remain what they are; or else the event has indeed taken place, it is an integral part of reality—but then this reality is controlled by laws unknown to us. Either the devil is an illusion, an imaginary being; or else he really exists, precisely like other living beings —with this reservation, that we encounter him infrequently. The fantastic occupies the duration of this uncertainty. Once we choose one answer or the other, we leave the fantastic for a neighboring genre, the uncanny or the marvelous. The fantastic is that hesitation experienced by a person who knows only the laws of nature, confronting an apparently supernatural event. (Todorov 1975:25) It should be pointed out that although many works involve the hesitation to which Todorov refers, very few sustain it throughout. Todorov himself cites The Saragassa Manuscript and The Turn of the Screw. Aside from adaptations of these works, cinematic examples are few and far between. Examples include Vampyr (1928) (Nash 1976), Martin (1978) (Grant 1994:114–15) and The Birds (1963). Negotiating the balance between different regimes of verisimilitude plays a key role in the relations established between spectators, genres and individual films. In markedly non-verisimilitudinous genres these relations can be particularly complex—and particularly fragile (Neale 1980:36–47, 1990b). The predominance of ideologies of realism in our culture tends to mean that, unless marked as high art, many avowedly non-realist genres are viewed as frivolously escapist, as ‘mere fantasy’, and thus as suitable only for children, or for ‘mindless’, ‘irresponsible’ adults. This, of course, is to refuse to acknowledge the generic status of realism itself (Todorov 1981:18–20), and the element of fantasy inherent in all forms of artistic representation (Cowie 1984; Freud [1908] 1985a). However, such refusals have consequences. One is that adults who find themselves viewing examples of these genres have often to disown their enjoyment by maintaining that such genres—and such pleasures—are not really for them, but for children, teenagers, others less ‘responsible’ (less ‘adult’) than they are themselves (Bergala 1978). Another is that films which are modelled on these genres often take account of disavowals of this kind by overtly addressing\n\n32 GENRE: DEFINITIONS AND CONCEPTS\n\nthe topics of adulthood and responsibility, childhood and the infantile, and credulity, fantasy and belief. There are numerous manifestations and examples of this. Noel Carroll (1981) has identified two plot structures characteristic of horror films and of horror/sci-fi hybrids. The first he calls ‘the Discovery Plot’. It has four main stages, ‘onset’, ‘discovery’, ‘confirmation’ and ‘confrontation’, and it is worth noting that as Carroll describes them, ‘discovery’ involves not just the testing—and failure—of responsibility and the capacity for belief of those in (adult) authority, but an identification of the one with the other, while ‘confirmation’ involves their eventual realignment. Thus the structure as a whole involves not only a ‘play between knowing and not knowing’, but an articulation of that play across themes and positions of responsibility, power and belief. It is also worth noting, particularly in the light of Carroll’s concluding remarks, that ‘teen horror’ variants like A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984) nearly always insist on the adult status of those in authority, on the ‘non-adult’ status of those who really know and who are most under threat, on the culpability, irresponsibility and ignorance of the former, and on the extent to which the latter have to assume power themselves in order to survive: Perhaps the most serviceable narrative armature in the horror film genre is what I call the Discovery Plot. It is used in Dracula, The Exorcist, Jaws I and II, It Came from Outer Space, Curse of the Demon, Close Encounters of the Third Kind, It Came from Beneath the Sea and myriad other films. It has four essential movements. The first is onset: the monster’s presence is established, e.g., by an attack, as in Jaws. Next, the monster’s existence is discovered by an individual or group, but for one reason or another its existence or continued existence, or the nature of the threat it actually poses, is not acknowledged by the powers that be, ‘There are no such things as vampires,’ the police chief might say at this point. Discovery, therefore, flows into the next plot movement which is confirmation. The discoverers or believers must convince some other group of the existence and proportions of the mortal danger at hand. Often this section of the plot is the most elaborate, and suspenseful. As the UN refuses to accept the reality of the onslaught of killer bees or invaders from Mars, precious time is lost, during which the creature or creatures often gain power and advantage… After the hesitations of confirmation, the Discovery Plot culminates in confrontation. Mankind meets its monster, most often winning, but on occasion, like the remake of Invasion of the Body Snatchers, losing. What is particularly of interest in this plot structure is the tension caused by the delay between discovery and confirmation. Thematically, it involves the audience not only in the drama of proof but also in the play between knowing and not knowing, between acknowledgement and nonacknowledgement, that has the growing awareness of sexuality in the adolescent as its archetype. This conflict can become very pronounced\n\nDIMENSIONS OF GENRE 33\n\nwhen the gainsayers in question—generals, police chiefs, scientists, heads of institutions, etc.—are obviously parental authority figures. (Carroll 1981:23) The second plot is the Overreacher Plot. Where the Discovery Plot involves endowing childlike or adolescent credulity, rather than adult scepticism, with the virtues of true responsibility, the Overreacher Plot makes a virtue of childlike powerlessness and superstition, and vilifies adult, scientific knowledge: Another important plot structure is that of the Overreacher. Frankenstein, Jeckyll and Hyde [sic], and Man with the X-Ray Eyes [sic] are all examples of this approach. Whereas the Discovery Plot often stresses the short-sightedness of science, the Overreacher Plot criticizes science’s will to knowledge. The Overreacher Plot has four basic movements. The first comprises the preparation for the experiment, generally including a philosophical, popular-mechanics explanation or debate about the experimenter’s motivation. The Overreacher himself (usually Dr. Soandso) can become quite megalomaniacal here, a quality commented upon, for instance, by the dizzyingly vertical laboratory sets in Frankenstein and Bride of Frankenstein. Next comes the experiment itself, whose partial success allows for some more megalomania. But the experiment goes awry, leading to the destruction of innocent victims and/or to damage or threat to the experimenter or his loved ones. At this point, some overreachers renounce their blasphemy; the ones who don’t are mad scientists. Finally, there is a confrontation with the monster, generally in the penultimate scene of the film. (Carroll 1981:23) Films using neither of these plots are nevertheless marked by the same set of concerns. Curse of the Cat People (1943), for example, sets up an opposition between the imaginative sensitivity of a young girl and the prosaic matter-offactness of her father. The girl believes she has an ‘invisible companion’ in the form of the ghost of her father’s first wife. Her father refuses to believe her and threatens her with punishment. But his disbelief places her in danger when she subsequently runs away. It is thus seen not only as repressive and cruel, but also as irresponsible, a mark of failure in his role as adult and father. Only when he tells his daughter that he believes her, only when he acknowledges her invisible companion, is he seen to be a truly responsible adult. Only then does he become a proper father—a visible companion for his child. In this way the film works to justify itself in terms of adult issues and concerns as well as in terms of childish or childlike ones. A further set of remarks might be made at this point about nonverisimilitudinous genres and audience expectations. Viewers of horror or science fiction may expect the unlikely. But precisely for this reason they will\n\n34 GENRE: DEFINITIONS AND CONCEPTS\n\noften also be unable to anticipate the norms, rules and laws that govern the fictional world in any one particular instance. And this means that the films themselves will have to explain them. Of course, all fiction films involve exposition, the provision of information about the nature and state of the fictional world. But many films are able to rely on the norms, rules and laws— the systems of ‘everyday knowledge’—embodied in regimes of socio-cultural verisimilitude in accounting at a fundamental level for the actions, events and behaviour they represent: most films do not have to explain the laws of gravity, or that humans are mortal, or that they are incapable of mutating into the life forms they ingest. However, in horror films and science fiction such laws may well not apply. Other laws, other norms, may have taken their place. Not only that, "
