Brian Scalabrine and Kendrick Perkins were teammates for the Boston Celtics in five years, including winning the 2007-08 championship. But fast forward to 2024, and these two icons are embroiled in an ugly feud.

The beef started when Brian Scalabrine said on his SiriusXM radio show that Kendrick Perkins was not invited to the Boston Celtics’ 2024 championship parade after they defeated the Dallas Mavericks in five games.

Kendrick Perkins learned what Brian Scalabrine said about him, and he didn’t mince words when he shared his thoughts in his appearance on the “Felger and Mazz” show last Monday.

“Scal is a coward. If you go publicly to say something like that, and I reach out to you privately, at least call me back. Right now, I feel like you’re ducking me,” Perkins said via James Stewart on X (formerly known as Twitter).

Perkins clarified that he declined a potential invite to join the Boston Celtics’ duck boat parade because it was “not their moment” and he wanted to let the current team celebrate theirs.

Brian Scalabrine appeared on the Courtside Club show with Rachel DeMita to discuss why Kendrick Perkins isn’t popular in Boston. According to the 11-year journeyman, Perkins’ scathing comments about Joe Mazzulla didn’t sit well with the team.

“I don’t know for a fact if the organization is like, ‘Nah, we don’t want nothing to do with Kendrick Perkins.’ Anybody else from back in the day, there’s old timers coming through all the time. I’m just not sure like, Jayson Tatum, Joe Mazzulla, and Jaylen Brown are going to love it when Kendrick Perkins shows up,” Scalabrine explained.

“He’s all good like doing the other side. I think the comments about Joe (Mazzulla) were out of hand. You can’t call the coach of the Boston Celtics a Dodo bird. You just can’t do that,” he added.
