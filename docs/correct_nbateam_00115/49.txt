Kendrick Perkins has been hesitant to give his former Boston Celtics team much credit throughout their NBA Playoffs run between saying he’s “so over” Jayson Tatum and predicting their Eastern Conference Finals series with the Indiana Pacers would go seven games.

But he finally turned a corner Thursday during his appearance on 98.5 The Sports Hub’s “Felger & Mazz.”

“I’ve got them winning it all. Whatever team they match up against,” Perkins said. “I think if they played the Dallas Mavericks, I think it goes to a Game 7. If they play the Minnesota Timberwolves, I think it goes to Game 6. But I do have Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown hanging Banner No. 18 up in the rafters.”

The Celtics have lost just two times during their postseason run. They swept the Pacers to punch their ticket to the NBA Finals despite having faced a slew of criticism from Perkins and other analysts regarding the relationship between Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum and whether they had an easy path to the finals.

Despite criticisms Brown and Tatum have faced from Perkins and others, he gave the duo their flowers and said if the Celtics do indeed win Banner 18, it will be because of them.

“At the end of the day, it’s going to come down to your superstars taking you home, right? Just for example, if the Celtics happen to match up against Dallas, it’s going to come down to Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum outplaying Kyrie Irving and Luka Doncic,” Perkins said. “It’s the same way we’re looking at it right now. Karl-Anthony Towns and Anthony Edwards finally outplayed both of those guys and the Minnesota Timberwolves finally got a win.”

The Celtics are awaiting their NBA Finals as the Mavericks and Timberwolves are still battling in the Western Conference Finals. Dallas could close things out Thursday with a Game 5 win.
