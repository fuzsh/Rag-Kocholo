Boston Celtics superstar Jayson Tatum and do-it-all guard Derrick White have a First-Team selection locked in by Kendrick Perkins.

Perkins shares that he voted Tatum for First-Team All-NBA and White for First-Team All Defense.

What I enjoy the most about Perkinsâ€™ votes is that he kept it realistic despite the positionless encouragement from the NBA this season for voters.
