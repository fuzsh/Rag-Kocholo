The word is he wants 4years and 30 million. I still say you hold on to him and try to win it all and wait till you see what the CBA brings.\n\nThe part that doesn't make any sense to me at all though is these people saying this is a move for the future and Green will be apart of the future. I guess they missed the part that Green is a free agent at the end of the year as well. Chances are very very high he isn't going to be there next year as well. The Celtics already have 72 million on the books for next year. So if the NBA goes to a hard cap or a dollar for dollar tax for over the cap teams there he isn't coming back. Not to mention Kristic is a free agent at the end of the year as well.\n\nSo basically we could be looking at a situation in which they traded their size advantage and starting center for a backup forward that isn't going to be on the squad next season either. If that is the case I would much rather have Perkins than Green for this years playoffs.\n\nMVP\n\nOVR: 9\n\nJoin Date: Aug 2006\n\nLocation: NH\n\nRe: Kendrick Perkins Traded to OKC\n\nAlthough I'm upset that Perk is gone, the C's offered him the max they could under the CBA (4y/23m).\n\nAlso, Green is a RFA, so I guessing the C's think with the new CBA, teams wont have money to throw out a big offer to Green (similar to how no one gave Big Baby an offer 2 years ago, and the C's were able to resign him cheap). But then again, Big Baby is a UFA....so we'll see what Danny's plan is after the season"
