        "text": "There seems to be no love lost between former Celtics teammates Brian Scalabrine and Kendrick Perkins.\n\nThere seems to be no love lost between former Celtics teammates Brian Scalabrine and Kendrick Perkins.\n\nPerkins, who has been an outspoken critic of the Celtics for several years during his time as an on-air personality with ESPN, might be considered persona non grata with Boston these days.\n\nAt least, such is the sentiment that Scalabrine shared on his SiriusXM Radio show when asked why Perkins wasn’t one of the former 2008 NBA champion Celtics who took part in Friday’s parade through Boston in celebration of the team’s 18th title.\n\nWhile the 2023-24 Celtics were the headliners for Friday’s festivities, one duck boat featured former 2007-08 champions in Paul Pierce, Eddie House, Scalabrine, and Leon Powe.\n\n“No, no, no, no, no, no,” Scalabrine said when asked if Perkins was invited to the Celtics’ latest championship celebrations. “Big scarlet letter. … It’s not really an open-arms thing with Kendrick Perkins.”\n\nIt didn’t take very long for Perkins to respond, with the former Celtics center calling out Scalabrine during an appearance on 98.5 The Sports Hub’s “Felger & Mazz” Monday afternoon.\n\n“Right now I feel like Scal is a coward,” Perkins said. “Was I the only 2008 member missing from the duck boat? No, I wasn’t. (Eddie) House, my guy, he was there. Leon Powe, great friend of mine as well, he was there.\n\n“Scal was there and Paul (Pierce) was there. There was still 11 other guys missing. And to be honest with you, if I would’ve gotten an invite, which I didn’t — I didn’t know we was supposed to — but anyways, nine times out of 10, I would’ve turned it down. … That’s not our moment. That’s 2024′s moment. Let those guys have their moment.”\n\nPerkins has regularly changed his opinions regarding the Celtics throughout the last few months, especially whenever Boston hit one of the few snags it faced during the 2023-24 campaign.\n\nHis harsh commentary about Joe Mazzulla’s coaching IQ in January prompted the Celtics’ coach to throw a subtle dig at Perkins during a press conference — labeling himself as a “bird brain.”\n\nConsidering Perkins’ history with calling out the Celtics, Scalabrine’s comments about the lack of an “open-arms” policy for Perkins in Boston might hold some validity. But Perkins stressed on Monday that his efforts to reach out to Scalabrine as of late have not gone anywhere.\n\n“Right now, I feel like you’re ducking me,” Perkins said of Scalabrine. “I got a problem with that. We can’t have a grown-man conversation?”"
