        "text": "BOSTON — There’s at least one close friend of Rajon Rondo’s who thinks he should stay in Boston.\n\n“This is a great place for him,” said Kendrick Perkins, Rondo’s long-time teammate with the Celtics, in town with the Thunder on Wednesday night. “I think he wants to stay here. We talk on the regular. I think he should stay. If I were him, I would stay.”\n\n(When a reporter told Perkins he didn’t stay, the center quickly rebutted, “I didn’t have a choice” with a smile.)\n\nRondo said after the game, “I can’t really say what we talk about” with a sly smile.\n\nPerkins sees a young core emerging around Rondo in Boston.\n\n“I just think it’s the perfect situation for him. He’s got a good group of guys around him, a good young coach. It’s his team,” said Perkins. “He’s able to play the way he’s capable of playing; he’s almost averaging a triple-double. He’s got some good talent around him in [Jared] Sullinger, Jeff [Green], the young kid with the long hair, I can’t pronounce it [Kelly Olynyk].”\n\n“Regardless what’s going on this season, my perspective hasn’t changed,” Rondo said. “I love being a Celtic.”\n\nPerkins added that he doesn’t see why any free agent wouldn’t look closely at Boston as a possible destination.\n\n“The way they’ve started off this year, guys are probably looking at it because they’re playing pretty well,” he said. “They’re playing team ball, playing hard. They’ve got some nice young talent. I don’t see why guys wouldn’t want to come here to play. The city’s great.”\n\n***\n\nIt was the sight of his old teammate Walter McCarty out on the TD Garden floor that helped crystallize to Perkins how quickly time was passing.\n\n“It’s crazy because when I went on the court to get my shots up just now seeing Walter McCarty, and he was my veteran when I came in and he’s got gray hair all in his beard. He’s just getting old,” said Perkins, who turned 30 years old himself on Monday. “It’s crazy. It doesn’t feel like 12 years.”\n\nIt’s been more than three years since Perkins wore a Celtics uniform, yet his time in Boston remains instructive to his career. He’s adjusted to a different role this season, coming off the bench for an Oklahoma City team trying to tread water until Russell Westbrook and Kevin Durant return from injury.\n\nEven though he’s been back in Boston before, Perkins always enjoys the trip to where he played the first 7 1/2 seasons of his career.\n\n“It always feels great to come back — all the memories, the great times, the great people,” he said. “This is where I started my career.”\n\nPerkins said he would consider a return to Boston, if the right opportunity ever presented itself.\n\n“It’s not on me. I’ve got to be wanted to come back,” he said. Perkins is a free agent after this season.\n\n***\n\nOf course, the other half of that Perkins trade is still in Boston, and Jeff Green is off to a strong start this season. Through a half-dozen games, Green is averaging 19.7 points and 5.3 rebounds. He’s taking more than 16 shots per game and hitting them at a 45.4 percent clip — much better than the 41.2 percent he shot a season ago.\n\n“Jeff’s one of our best players. Your best players are asked to do a lot,” head coach Brad Stevens said. “He’s doing a good job of soaring with his strengths. One of the things we’re trying to do is put teams in long closeouts against him so he can use his quickness and shooting ability and pick and choose.”\n\n“He doesn’t have that flat shot anymore,” said Scott Brooks, Green’s former coach in Oklahoma City. “It took me years to tell him that’s not the way to shoot. Obviously the staff here’s done a great job with him. He’s shooting the ball well.\n\n“He’s a player that can do a little bit of everything, and you have to understand that’s his strength. He’s not going to be a great rebounder, he’s not going to be a great shooter — but he’s going to be good at all of them. if you appreciate that type of talent, you’re going to be happy with him. He’s having a great start to the year. I’m hoping he misses all his shots tonight and doesn’t get any rebounds and doesn’t defend. That would be a good night for me.”\n\nStevens doesn’t want to read too much into six games.\n\n“Obviously we’re all going to overevaluate making or missing shots and scoring points or not scoring points,” said Stevens. “He’s done a good job for us defensively early on in this season, and offensively he’s a hard matchup. He needs to make himself a hard matchup. That’s the thing, sometimes he’s at the four and can use his quickness and sometimes he’s at the three and can use his size. He needs to recognize when those opportunities are. That’s on us to help coach too. That’s what we get paid to do.”\n\n***\n\nMarcus Thornton was inactive after injuring his ankle on Saturday night in Chicago. Stevens said Thornton, who is averaging about 14 minutes per game off the bench, “could very reasonably be available” for Friday night’s home contest with the Cavaliers.\n\nRookie guard James Young is active and available off the bench despite missing two practices to tend to a family illness. Young has played just six minutes this season.\n\n“I don’t expect him to miss a beat,” Stevens said. “We spent a lot of time with him after walkthrough today. Obviously first things first with his family. Glad he was able to make it back.”"
