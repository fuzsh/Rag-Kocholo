        "text": "Kendrick Perkins is the definition of an overachiever.\n\nNever went to college.\n\nLots of people don’t, and succeed in life.\n\nPlayed high school basketball well enough to become a McDonald’s All-American and a Rivals.com five-star recruit.\n\nIn 2003, the 6’10” 275 lb. Perkins was considered the #3 center and #6 player in the nation.\n\nHe originally had committed to Memphis and Coach Cal, but that didn’t happen.\n\nHe made the jump directly to the NBA.\n\nTurned out to be a sage move.\n\nAnd “Perk” has great sagacity.\n\nBelieve it.\n\nHe’s as smart as they come.\n\nThe thirty-six-year-old native of Nederland, TX had absolutely no business enjoying an NBA career, never mind for fourteen years.\n\nCorrect.\n\nHe played in the best league on the planet for fourteen seasons with the Celtics, Oklahoma City, Cleveland and New Orleans.\n\nAnd while his career numbers were plebeian at best — 5.4 ppg; 5.8 rpg; 1.2 bpg — basketball is a team sport, and it’s safe to say that Perkins was a vital piece of the Celtics teams that won it all in 2008 and lost to the Lakers in the NBA Finals in 2010 (4–3).\n\nHe started 78 games in both seasons and averaged a shade over 26 minutes of playing time per game.\n\nIn fact, in Game 6 of the 2010 Finals, Perkins injured his knee and missed the rest of that game, and Game 7 too.\n\nSuffice to say, his absence hurt the Celtics badly.\n\nPerk seemed to have a knack for reaching the Finals.\n\nHe made it three more times, with Oklahoma City in 2012, and with the Cavaliers in 2015 and 2018, losing on each occasion.\n\nFive Finals in fourteen seasons speaks to his value as a team player, which he has become again today, in the world of broadcasting.\n\nHis stock as an NBA analyst on ESPN is rising meteorically.\n\nIn assessing the Celtics’ recent trade of Kemba Walker, Perkins gave his stamp of approval on ESPN’s “First Take.”\n\n“Oh, I love it. I see Brad (Stevens) making power moves as soon as he steps foot in the office.\n\nI love it and here’s why.\n\nHe’s telling Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown, ‘This is your team.’\n\nNow you don’t have to worry about can Kemba Walker and Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum, can they play together?\n\nWho’s going to share the ball? How can you make this work? We don’t have to worry about that.\n\nBringing back Al Horford was huge.\n\nHe’s loved by the Celtics’ fans, he’s respected by the organization, but most importantly, he brings value to that team.\n\nHe stretches the floor. He’s a great leader. Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum love ‘Big Al.’”\n\nPerk also pontificated about the addition of Moses Brown.\n\nThe 21-year-old center has shown a lot of promise in his brief career, including a March 27 game this year against Boston, in which he scored 17 points and grabbed 19 rebounds in the first half.\n\n“Here’s a teaching point to all the young guys out there,” began Perkins “who are on auditioning roles right now in the G League, in the NBA that are trying to get jobs…or trying to stay in the NBA.\n\nMoses Brown played with the Oklahoma City Thunder and he had 21 points and 23 rebounds (against the Celtics).\n\nYou know who was coaching at the time?\n\nBrad Stevens.\n\nSo he says, ‘You know what? Let me snag this young fella.’\n\nHe’s a good center, he’s going to put pressure on Robert Williams to perform.\n\nRob has a history of being injured.\n\nI love this move by Brad Stevens.\n\nCeltics Nation should be proud.\n\nBeantown, stand up.”\n\nNo less an authority than ESPN’s Hannah Storm has playfully dubbed Kendrick Perkins, “our wordsmith.”\n\nWhile the big fella doesn’t pretend to speak the King’s English, his sharp wit and incisive commentary is piercing.\n\nIt’s infectious.\n\nAnd spot-on.\n\nHe knows what he knows.\n\nHe knows basketball inside and out.\n\nWatch out for Perk.\n\nHard to believe that somebody his size could sneak up on you.\n\nBut he’s poised to do just that.\n\nAnd then to break that TV analyst’s door down, smashing it to smithereens."
