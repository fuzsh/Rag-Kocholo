While on, Perkins discussed the importance of the Kristaps Porzingis for the Celtics in the Finals.\n\nPerk on Porzingis…\n\nFelger: What’s your biggest concern?\n\nKendrick Perkins: Well, I mean, my biggest concern is I want to see how Kristaps Porzingis looks, because I do feel like if he’s not back on the floor, I don’t expect him to look 100%, if he does that would be shocking to me, but if he’s 75% and he’s back on the floor and he looks as if he has his rhythm then I got the confidence. I’ll be I’ll be way more confident than what I am because I feel like whether they play the Dallas Mavericks or the Minnesota Timberwolves, it’s looking like the Mavs, but I feel like Kristaps Porzingis definitely has to be on the floor in order for them to win it all, I really do. I think he’s the most important player to that team for what he brings on both ends of the floor.\n\nFelger: Really? So you don’t think they could beat Dallas or Minnesota without Kristaps Porzingis?"
