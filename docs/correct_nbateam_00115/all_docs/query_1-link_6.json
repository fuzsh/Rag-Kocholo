        "text": "BOSTON Celtics head coach Joe Mazzulla resumed an an open-door policy for former players and coaches before their championship season.\n\n“I hope that any and every Celtic feels like they can come to any practice or any game and be a part of that,” Mazzulla told NBC Sports Boston about his plan.\n\nBut apparently not everybody was included.\n\nCeltics announcer Brian Scalabrine revealed Kendrick Perkins would not be welcomed into the fold like many other former stars.\n\n“No, no, no, no, no, no,” Scalabrine said when asked if Perkins was at the afterparty following the NBA Finals.\n\n“Big scarlet letter. It’s not really an open-arms thing with Kendrick Perkins,\" he added on his SiriusXM Radio show The Starting Lineup.\n\nPerkins spent the first eight seasons of his NBA career with the Celtics.\n\nHe was the starting center on Boston's 2008 championship-winning team.\n\nThe former star has since become a high-profile analyst on ESPN with a reputation for not holding back on criticism.\n\nPerkins said Jayson Tatum “looked scared as hell” during a game in 2022.\n\nHe also referred to Mazzulla as a birdbrain in January and questioned the Celtics before the NBA Finals.\n\nParkins was not at Friday's championship parade either.\n\nJaylen Brown has taken a swipe back at ESPN presenter Stephen A. Smith by wearing a special shirt.\n\nBrown helped the Celtics to a record 18th NBA title with victory over the Dallas Mavericks.\n\nAnd he wore a shirt with the words \"State Your Source\" on it.\n\nThis is in reference to comments Smith made on air about Brown last month.\n\n\"I wanted to read to y'all what an NBA source just sent me,\" Smith said during the Eastern Conference Finals.\n\n\"He said, 'Jaylen Brown, it's not so much that he's underrated, it's that he's just not liked because of his I-am-better-than-you attitude. He knows it. It's the same reason he is not as marketable as he should be.'\n\n\"That's what an NBA source just sent me.\"\n\nA clearly annoyed Brown took to X later that day and wrote \"State your source\".\n\nBrown has sparked dating rumors after he was spotted with WNBA star Kysre Gondrezick at the team's championship parade."
