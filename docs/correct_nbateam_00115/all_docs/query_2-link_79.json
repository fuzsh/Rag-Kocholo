        "text": "Kendrick Perkins was born in Nederland, Texas. His father, Kenneth Perkins, played for Lamar University's basketball team between 1981-85 and is a member of the university's Cardinal Hall of fame. Kendrick's mother, Ercell Minix, was tragically shot and killed while working when he was five years old. During his father's professional basketball career in New Zealand, Kendrick was raised by his grandparents in Beaumont, Texas, where he attended Catholic Church and was an altar boy.\n\n​\n\nHe graduated from Clifton J. Ozen high school in Beaumont, Texas, in 2003, where he averaged 27.5 points, 16.4 rebounds, and 7.8 blocks as a Senior. He led Ozen to four consecutive district championships plus one state title.\n\n​\n\nComing out of high school, Kendrick was ranked as No. 3 center and No. 6 high school player in the class of 2003 By Rival.com.\n\n​\n\nAt 6'10\", Perkins was deemed physically imposing and skilled enough to play professionally and was drafted with the 27th pick in the first round and traded to the Boston Celtics. At 300 pounds, he spent his first season with the Celtics getting into shape.\n\n​\n\nHe started at center in 2008, and the Celtics won the NBA championship that year, defeating the Los Angeles Lakers in six games. In the 2010 NBA finals, Boston carried a 3-2 lead back to Los Angeles for Games 6 and 7 against the Lakers. Just under seven minutes into Game 6, Perkins fell to the floor after battling for a rebound, tearing his ACL. Many experts point to that moment as the difference in the Celtics loss to the Lakers. His 2010-2011 season was spent in rehab from the ACL injury.\n\n​\n\nIn 2011, Kendrick was traded to the Oklahoma City Thunder and signed a contract for 35 million dollars, playing with their all-star tandem of Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook, and James Hardin. Now an experienced veteran player, Perkins was an immediate leader, showing the younger players what it took to win in the playoffs. In his first season with the Thunder, they met the Lebron James and the Miami Heat in the NBA finals and were defeated in 5 games."
