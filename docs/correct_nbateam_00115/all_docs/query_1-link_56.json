        "text": "WALTHAM – The first game against Shaquille O’Neal always has been one of the first milestones for any young big man in the NBA.\n\nIt’s a sign of Kendrick Perkins’ creeping years that the Celtics center no longer remembers his first game against Shaq.\n\nBut he does remember the symptoms – the aches from collisions, the sheer size of the task.\n\nPerhaps Dwight Howard is the new standard in terms of post defense, and Perkins has left his own mark on that job. He is generally recognized as one of the best, if not the best, at guarding Orlando’s center one-on-one.\n\nBut as good as Howard has become, there’s something about the giant who strolls into the Garden tonight that still commands special attention.\n\n“Shaq is more physical,” Perkins said after yesterday’s practice when asked to compare the two big men. “Dwight is physical, but Shaq is more physical, as far as throwing a few elbows.\n\n“With Shaq, when you come out of the game you might be hurting a little bit. I just hope I don’t come out with a broken nose or something like that. Other than that, I don’t do anything different. I’ll try and play him the same, just try and play him physical.”\n\nThe teams haven’t met since Oct. 28, when the Celtics beat the Cavaliers in the season opener and sparked a month of inaccurate speculation that the new partnership between LeBron James and O’Neal was rocky.\n\nThe Cavs have ironed out their issues nicely, and bring the best record in the league into tonight’s rematch.\n\n“Their size in the first game was a factor,” C’s coach Doc Rivers said. “Shaq was a player people didn’t think would be a factor, and Shaq has been terrific for them. So we have to figure out different ways to take advantage of their size, just as they will on the other end.”\n\nO’Neal is averaging 12.1 points, 6.8 rebounds and 1.2 blocks this season, but has steadily increased his production. He’s averaged 14.2 points on 63.9 percent shooting the past 15 games.\n\nHis comfort level has been made possible by the greatest team player in the game today – James.\n\n“You have to fit in with LeBron, but that’s not hard,” Perkins said. “You just have to keep making your shots. It makes them a tougher team to cover now. You have to put so much attention on LeBron, and now you have Shaq down low, a future Hall of Famer, so that’s what makes it difficult.”\n\nBut, in a sense, nothing changes for Perkins. Where Shaq is concerned, the Celts center has to take on this human mountain without help.\n\n“It is a tough matchup,” Perkins said. “He’s playing well. He’s a lot more aggressive on the offensive end.\n\n“The last couple of games he’s shooting a high percentage from the field. He’s making his shots. You just can’t let him catch you (off guard). You just have to make him score over the top.”"
