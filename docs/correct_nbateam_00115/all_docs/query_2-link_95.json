        "text": "Singer Ingrid Andress went viral Monday (July 15) night following her rendition of the national anthem at the 2024 MLB Home Run Derby at Globe Life Field in Arlington, Texas.\n\nSeveral X users bashed the performance, including one user who called it, \"the worst national anthem I've ever heard.\n\n“That rendition of the national anthem was more harmful to America than Pearl Harbor,” another X user wrote.\n\n“New awful national anthem just dropped,” another user posted.\n\nAndress later admitted she was \"drunk\" during her performance and would be \"checking myself into a facility today to get the help I need\" in a statement shared on her Instagram account.\n\n\"That was not me last night,\" Andress wrote. \"I apologize to MLB, all the fans, and this country I love so much for that rendition. I'll let y'all know how rehab is I hear it's super fun.\"\n\nSeveral singers and celebrities have garnered negative attention for their renditions of The Star-Spangled Banner' at sporting events, which included comedian Roseanne Barr shout-singing the national anthem at a San Diego Padres game in 1990 before grabbing her crotch and spitting on the pitcher's mound while being booed.\n\nPop singer Fergie also went viral for her unique rendition of the national anthem during the 2018 NBA All-Star Game, for which she later apologized.\n\n“I’m a risk-taker artistically, but clearly this rendition didn’t strike the intended tone,” she said via the New York Post. “I love this country and honestly tried my best.”\n\nLos Angeles Dodgers outfielder Teoscar Hernandez defeated Kansas City Royals shortstop Bobby Witt Jr., a native of nearby Colleyville, 14-13, in the final round of the 2024 Home Run Derby."
