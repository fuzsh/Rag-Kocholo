        "text": "Kendrick Perkins knows about leaders. He’s played with his beloved “Ticket” – Kevin Garnett – Paul Pierce, Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook and even LeBron James and Kyrie Irving for a brief period din Cleveland.\n\nThe former Celtic, now expounding at length on all things NBA on Twitter and podcasts everywhere, can even see well enough through the mess of the Celtics’ 2018-19 season and identify a leader.\n\nHis name, as Perkins has made clear, is not Kyrie Irving.\n\n“Marcus Smart is the one who, it seems to me, looks like the leader on that team,” Perkins said recently. “He sets a defensive tone, plays hard, and he’s not only an emotional leader – he does it by example. It’s hard to come back from energy and get going again, but he’s done it now in the playoffs twice before anyone thought he would be ready.”\n\nPerkins has made his views on Irving well known. He tweeted the following after the Celtics’ Game 4 loss to the Bucks, at home, in the Eastern Conference semifinals:\n\n“Listen if y’all think that me and my boy @paulpierce34 was going to go against the grain in this series y’all crazy! Win, lose or draw I was riding with the Bean! Just realized that Kyrie not a Batman! Hell @isaiahthomas took the Cs to the ECF! Hell they got there last year!”\n\nPerkins and Pierce’s prediction skills were exposed when, after both picked a Celtics trip to the Finals following their Game 1 win over Milwaukee, they lost four straight on their way to elimination.\n\nPerhaps his lowest blow in the above tweet was the “not a Batman” reference, and comparing Irving’s impact as a Celtic to that of Thomas two years ago.\n\nThough Perkins has known James since their time together on the same AAU team as high schoolers, he never got to know Irving, though they played together in Cleveland for the last half of the 2014-15 season.\n\nIrving was traded to the Celtics just before Perkins’ brief 20-day return to Cleveland on the eve of the 2017-18 season.\n\n“I don’t really know him,” said Perkins. “I don’t have a personal relationship with Kyrie. But I thought he was in a great situation when he went to Boston.”\n\nPerkins, least of all considering his fondness for the Celtics, could never have predicted the Celtics/Irving combination would turn so sour this season.\n\n“Kyrie was a cool dude when I was with him,” said Perkins. “But I think it was difficult for him when he tried to lead a team. It’s difficult to deal with so many egos, and I think that was hard for him. He never had to be a leader before. In Cleveland he could just play the game of basketball and just be Kyrie.\n\n“Kyrie’s a great player, but Marcus Smart was the real leader on that team this year.”\n\nPerkins has risen in the Twitter-sphere thanks to his willingness to be critical, and admittedly wouldn’t mind if this exposure eventually leads to a coaching or broadcasting job. Irving certainly hasn’t been alone on Perkins’ skillet. Just ask his old Thunder teammate, Toronto’s Serge Ibaka — teed up by Perkins for lackluster defensive play.\n\nAnd when Terry Rozier brought his ongoing gripe with the Celtics onto ESPN, Perkins had another missile to fire.\n\nResponding to a tweet from CLNS sports anchor Adam Kaufman about Rozier, Perkins wrote, “I agree! I wonder where he’s getting his advice from? Not a good look going into free agency!”\n\nThe problem, according to Perkins, is that all of the Celtics’ young guys took a step back this season while attempting to develop in Irving’s shadow.\n\n“Last year they all had a bigger role,” he said. “Jaylen Brown had to defer — but Jaylen Brown has really been a true pro and played his butt off. Some of the things on that team were really tough to deal with this year, but I really approve of the way that he handled it.”\n\nThat’s what the Celtics needed more of this year, Perkins believes — more players willing to accept their roles.\n\n“I thought at the start of the year there were too many stars and not enough role players,” he said. “I thought they all came together in the Indiana series, and then the first game of the (Milwaukee) series. But then when things went bad, I saw some bad body language out of them that I had never seen before. They needed guys willing to make sacrifices. Instead of sticking together, they fell apart.\n\n“They have all the pieces. They just didn’t live up to it.”"
