        "text": "Kyrie Irving recently made comments regarding fans in Boston and his experiences in the city. Rachel Nichols asked him about his love for the fans at TD Garden and Irving responded with “hopefully we can just keep it about basketball.” This provoked an uproar from many Boston fans, as well as many discussions within the national media. Figures such as Kendrick Perkins, Vince Carter, and various Nets/Celtics personnel have commented on the matter.\n\nKendrick Perkins\n\nWhile Irving’s comments should not be taken lightly, some former players took an opposing stance on the issue. Perkins commented on the statement on NBC Sports Boston. “I mean, to be honest, I know that Celtic fans are some of the best fans in the world,” said Perkins. “I lived there for eight and a half years, and me personally, I never dealt with any type of racism while living in Boston.” He made the same statement in regards to his time in Boston as an opponent. “It’s always extra, it’s always extra with him. I don’t even know why we’re surprised by this comment.”\n\nThe Jump - Vince Carter/Robert Horry\n\nMeanwhile, Carter and Robert Horry got the chance to speak about the comments made by Irving on The Jump. “Boston is a tough place to play,” Carter began. “They will do or say whatever they need to say to win.” Nichols then prompted a response from Carter, asking if he ever experienced this type of behavior in Boston. “Yes, point blank,” he stated. “Like I said, Boston Celtics, their fans bleed that green… it’s unfortunate, but that’s how it’s always been traditionally.”\n\nNets Personnel\n\nSteve Nash, Blake Griffin, and Landry Shamet all spoke at the Nets’ post-practice press conference today. The media asked each of them individually about Irving’s comments, as well as about their own personal experiences in Boston.\n\nThe media asked Nash whether or not he talked to Irving about the matter. The head coach said that he never had the conversation with Irving, but is confident that he can handle himself. “I mean it never really crossed my mind to talk to Ky about it because I know how strong he is as an individual,” said Nash “He’s probably faced it before… that doesn’t make it right… I think he can handle it, one, it’s not warranted or acceptable… that’s kind of it, we all know that.”\n\nGriffin reacted to Irving’s comments in his interview. He also gave his thoughts on the city of Boston as a whole, including his own personal experiences in the city. “That’s a good question,” he stated. “It’s kind of an understood thing when you go into certain places that it’s going to be a pretty rowdy crowd… I’ve heard things throughout my time in the league… never played a playoff game in Boston… I have a lot of respect for the fans in Boston, they’re loud, they support their team, but yeah you hope it stays like that… I’m not going into it with that expectation because I haven’t had that experience.”\n\nShamet kept his comments relatively brief, explaining his thoughts on Irving’s comments, as well as his experiences in Boston. “If by different you’re implying anything of the racial remarks I don’t know, I haven’t personally experienced anything,” stated Shamet. “I do know that Boston fans are very passionate, one of my favorite arenas to play in… who knows, people might act out, they may not… you just hope for the best fan experience possible… not crossing any lines, acting right, that’s what you want obviously… Boston, I don’t know in that regard, I haven’t experienced anything.”\n\nCeltics Personnel\n\nBrad Stevens, Marcus Smart, and Jayson Tatum also held press conferences today after the Celtics’ practice. Each shared their opinion, in some form or another, on Kyrie Irving’s comments, as well as race issues in Boston.\n\nStevens was not asked about the incident during his press conference but spoke about the issue during a radio interview earlier today with Zolak and Bertrand. He stated, \"I certainly take any comments like that very seriously. I don't know what context [Irving] was discussing there. But I know that the Garden, I know that the Celtics, I know that the NBA, is very alert to making sure that our fans don't cross the line. I think that's really important. People shouldn't ever feel like they're being discriminated against. I think everybody is dialed into that.”\n\nStevens went on to say that “Kyrie has never mentioned anything to me about it, but that doesn't mean it didn't happen, and I think those things should always be taken very seriously.\"\n\nSmart shared a tidbit of his own experiences when asked about the comments. When asked about whether or not he hears these things being said, he stated, “Yeah, I've heard it. I've heard a couple of things. It's hard to hear that and then have them support us as players. It's kind of sad and sickening.\" Smart also shared a personal story of his in The Player’s Tribune in October of 2020. It detailed a direct experience he had with racism in the city.\n\nTatum’s interview came last during Boston’s press conferences. The media asked him about Irving’s comments and whether or not he’s endured any experiences of that nature in Boston. \"Seeing how fans reacted with Westbrook, I love our fans, I think it's just a certain way fans should act while cheering for their respective fans,” Tatum stated. “I think that's what he was alluding to. Obviously, there'll be chants against him ... most people should understand.\"\n\nIrving’s experiences in Boston should not be discredited, nor should they be ignored. People around the league can share their own opinions and experiences, but that does not take away from Irving’s. The issues with fans continuously pop up around the league, with the most recent incidents involving Russell Westbrook and Trae Young being the best examples of that. It remains an issue around the league, and it rests on the shoulders of the NBA to protect their players. Regardless of one’s opinion on a certain player, that sort of behavior should never be tolerated.\n\nThe Nets travel to Boston for Games 3 and 4 starting tomorrow night. TD Garden will be at around 25% capacity in Game 3, but by Game 4 restrictions will be lifted and the arena should be at nearly full capacity. Game 3 is set to tip-off at 8:30 PM on TNT."
