        "text": "Celtics President of Basketball Ops Brad Stevens just got his team to the summit, but he still has work to do if he wants to stay there.\n\nThe entire main roster will remain intact for the 2024-25 season, if Stevens stands pat on what he has. But there’s at least one, if not two major contract extensions to get done, and even the defending champions could use some reinforcements or tweaks to the formula. Stevens also has the draft and some possible coaching moves to consider.\n\nStevens has proven to be a forward thinker who is unafraid to make bold moves, so another active summer can’t be ruled out. But even if Stevens stands pat with all his primary pieces, he’ll still have some key tasks on his plate that Celtics fans should familiarize themselves with before the next few months unfold.\n\nHere’s a look at seven things for Stevens to work on in the off-season…\n\nGet Jayson Tatum’s supermax done\n\nThe C’s made Jaylen Brown the highest-paid player in NBA history last summer. One year later, they’re about to do it again with Jayson Tatum.\n\nAccording to ESPN’s Adrian Wojnarowski, Tatum is expected to be offered the richest contract in NBA history this off-season. That would be a five-year deal worth $315 million, or $63 million per season. It’ll be the most expensive no-brainer ever."
