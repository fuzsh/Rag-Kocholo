        "text": "By HoopsHype |\n\nI saw a stat that had Jayson Tatum with the lowest field goal percentage during crunch time for superstars. What do you think they should do in crunch time to maybe not be so predictable against other teams? Kendrick Perkins: Well, I think sometimes you gotta run misdirection and other times, you might have to run plays for other players. You do have Jrue Holiday on the roster, he’s battle-tested, and you do have Derrick White. Doc Rivers used to always say just because I draw up your play doesn’t mean it’s your shot. And I think the world has painted this narrative that if superstars don’t take the last shot, they don’t have a killer mindset and that’s not the case. We have seen time and time again when LeBron James passed up on shots and got great shots for others, wide-open looks.\n\nSource: HoopsHype\n\nWhat’s the buzz on Twitter?\n\nSean Grande @SeanGrandePBP\n\nCeltics at Pelicans – Smoothie King Center – March 30, 2024 – Starters\n\nBoston – Holiday, White, Brown, Tatum, Porzingis\n\nNew Orleans – CJ McCollum, Trey Murphy II, Herbert Jones, Zion Williamson, Jonas Valanciunas\n\nOUT – Boston: Springer, Davison New Orleans: Ingram, Alvarado pic.twitter.com/hDoAMa47Pv – 4:33 PM\n\nKendrick Perkins @KendrickPerkins\n\nMan @elleduncanESPN @chiney and @Andraya_Carter are killing it!!!

Yikes. #Celtics #Hawks – 9:43 PM\n\nBrian Robb @BrianTRobb\n\nEncouraging sequence there for Celtics. Jaylen gets a touch, C’s run an action with White/Tatum (which was well covered) and Jaylen makes a play. Far better than just settling for isolation from the start. – 9:40 PM\n\nBobby Manning @RealBobManning\n\nSome sharp sets in crunch time by the #Celtics, who will try to build on their 4-7 record in 1pt games in the final minute. Inside out from Tatum through Brown to White for 3. A good Tatum step back 3.

Malloy who was on the baseline saw the elbow from Tatum to Krejci’s face and called it an offensive foul.\n\nAcosta came in and called it a block.\n\nNow Snyder has to challenge – 8:22 PM\n\nGary Washburn @GwashburnGlobe\n\nNow Vit Krejci is called for a block on Tatum although it looked Tatum’s elbow struck him on the mouth. #Hawks challenging. #Celtics playing in mud so far tonight. – 8:21 PM\n\nBobby Manning @RealBobManning\n\nWow. Another charge, this time on Tatum, reversed on the floor after an official’s conference and Hawks will challenge anyway. – 8:21 PM\n\nGary Washburn @GwashburnGlobe\n\nMazzulla is challenging this charge call on Jaylen Brown. Brown could have made it easier he just tossed an oop to a trailing Tatum. #Celtics #Hawks – 8:17 PM\n\nGary Washburn @GwashburnGlobe\n\n#Celtics lead #Hawks 29-28 after 1Q.

Has missed the last five games with a shoulder injury. #Celtics. – 12:48 PM\n\nBobby Manning @RealBobManning\n\nJrue Holiday on the floor here at practice as it opens pic.twitter.com/YKpRE7zfdP – 12:48 PM\n\nMore on this storyline\n\nGary Washburn: Jrue Holiday WILL play tonight vs. #Hawks. #Celtics. -via Twitter @GwashburnGlobe / March 28, 2024\n\nKendrick Perkins: When you see a team that’s a veteran team like that, that has been inconsistent, that means there’s not a real voice in the locker room. And KD has the resume, he has the credentials to be that voice. And whether that be calling guys out or lifting guys up, in order for the Phoenix Suns to take that next step, he has to be uncomfortable. And I said this about him a month ago, the Phoenix Suns haven’t had a leader since Chris Paul left. That doesn’t mean a guy that’s not gonna go out there and produce numbers and do what he do, but an actual leader. That’s why they’re one of the worst fourth-quarter teams, if not the worst fourth-quarter team in the league. That comes with leadership. -via HoopsHype / March 30, 2024\n\nDo you think Jalen Brunson is the best PG right now? How far do you think the Knicks can go this season? Kendrick Perkins: If the Knicks were healthy – that means having Julius Randle, OG Anunoby back in the lineup – the Knicks could actually go to the NBA Finals. They’re equipped to win now. They got great depth. Their defense is ferocious. They play with a tenacity like no other, led by Tom Thibodeau. But right now – and I call them the Villanova boys with the three-headed monster led by Jalen Brunson – I wouldn’t be surprised if they reached the Conference Finals if they could get to the No. 2 or 3 seed and prevent from seeing the Celtics in the second-round matchup. -via HoopsHype / March 30, 2024\n\nKendrick Perkins: I always say that Steph Curry is the best player on that team, but Draymond Green is the heart and soul of that team. Now, with that being said, there comes a time where it could be a bit excessive and that’s something that Draymond has to control. Because at this point, you’re not a young guy, you’re a veteran, you’re a multiple All-Star, NBA champion. So, you know better. Draymond is a very intelligent guy and he has the respect of the referees. So he’s allowed to get away with a little bit more and rightfully so. He’s earned that respect because he probably does have a relationship with the majority of the refs. But, he’s battle-tested enough – four-time NBA champion – you know, you can’t ask him to change. He is who he is and that’s not a bad thing. -via HoopsHype / March 30, 2024\n\nLook, you gotta get to the point as a coach where you trust every single person that you have on the floor. If you go back and look at what Robert Horry did for so many teams. Kobe and Shaq, think about the big shot that Robert Horry hit against the Sacramento Kings. Role players have stepped up tremendously in the playoffs when it came down to winning games. Derek Fisher, we saw the shot in the series against the San Antonio Spurs. I think it’s the trust factor that the coach has to have and the others along with your superstars or the franchise guys have trust in those players as well. -via HoopsHype / March 30, 2024\n\nKendrick Perkins: Well, we will see. I’ve been saying this all season long… nothing that the Celtics do in the regular season is going to impress me. Their season actually starts April 20. So, I have to see if Kristaps Porzingis is gonna be able to hold up health-wise. Is he gonna be able to play at a 20 and 10 status every single night? When he has to match up with a guy like Giannis [Antetokounmpo], is he gonna be able to hold his own because that’s gonna be key. And also, Jayson Tatum, him and Jaylen Brown, in close games, can they be those guys to close out those close games and be able to go toe-to-toe. That’s what it’s gonna be based on. -via HoopsHype / March 30, 2024\n\nTatum has struggled mightily in clutch situations this season. He is 5 for 18 shooting with the Celtics trailing or leading by 5 points or fewer in the last minute of games. He is 1 for 7 with the game within 3 points in the final 10 seconds. “I know I missed a couple this year,” he said. “It’s like damn, I [have to] be due for one. I had a bunch of them in my career so far. It’s part of it, make-or-miss league. But I really do enjoy being in those situations.” -via Boston Globe / March 30, 2024\n\nBobby Marks: Notable names that have reached the 65-game criteria, are on pace or ineligible/not on pace: Reached the criteria Jarrett Allen Jayson Tatum Derrick White DeMar DeRozan Coby White Jarrett Allen Nikola Jokic Stephen Curry Pascal Siakam Paul George James Harden Kawhi Leonard Anthony Davis Giannis Antetokounmpo Damian Lillard Rudy Gobert Anthony Edwards Jalen Brunson Shai Gilgeous-Alexander Paolo Banchero Kevin Durant Domantas Sabonis Chet Holmgren On pace Jaylen Brown Jrue Holiday Alex Caruso Luka Doncic Tyrese Haliburton LeBron James Jaren Jackson Jr. Bam Adebayo Zion Williamson Herb Jones Jalen Suggs Tyrese Maxey Devin Booker De’Aaron Fox Victor Wembanyama Off pace/Ineligible Trae Young Kristaps Porzingis LaMelo Ball Zach LaVine Darius Garland Donovan Mitchell Kyrie Irving Draymond Green Ja Morant Jimmy Butler Khris Middleton Karl-Anthony Towns Julius Randle Joel Embiid Bradley Beal Scottie Barnes Lauri Markkanen TBD because of injuries Alperen Sengun Brandon Ingram -via Twitter @BobbyMarks42 / March 27, 2024\n\nTodd Whitehead: These are the 4 players from each “height class” who are making the biggest defensive impact. pic.twitter.com/nzAuy7ky1d -via Twitter @CrumpledJumper / March 26, 2024"
