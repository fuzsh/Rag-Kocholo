        "text": "The five-game NBA Finals series between the Boston Celtics and Dallas Mavericks was viewed as underwhelming by most, especially analyst Kendrick Perkins.\n\nPerkins, the former Celtic, took to social media late Wednesday evening, comparing the Finals to rapper Kendrick Lamar's 'Pop Out and Show' concert. \"This Concert is more entertaining than the NBA Finals,\" Perkins wrote.\n\nWhile there's no denying Lamar is one of the most entertaining in the business, it's a bit surprising to see Perkins blatantly disrespect the team he spent eight seasons with. However, the retired NBA champion is never one to shy away from bold opinions, regardless of the backlash associated with them."
