        "text": "The 'Panic Effect' caused by the Munich Agreement forced the French Government to carry out large massive purchases of foreign aircraft, initiating talks with the USSR for the acquisition of Polikarpov I-16 fighters, an operation that was cancelled after the German-Soviet non-aggression Pact. They placed orders for two-hundred Curtiss H.75A and hundred Curtiss H.81 (P-40) fighters to the USA and acquired forty Koolhoven FK.58 fighters to the Netherlands together with the license to manufacture them in Nevers-France. One Spitfire Mk.I was also purchased to Great Britain to study the compatibility of its engine with the D.520.\n\nOn March 1940 l’Armée de l’Air had 18 serviceable Koolhoven. During the Battle of France they were used to equip four Patrouilles de Défense piloted by Poles. On June 25 ten of them had survived the combats.\n\nThe Curtiss H.81 did not arrive in time to prevent the fall of France and they were transferred to the RAF, but the H.75A performed well, fighting on equal terms with the Messerschmitt Bf 109 D during the Phoney War and eluding the attacks of the Bf 109 E during the Battle of France, thanks to its greater manoeuvrability, but its armament of four machine guns proved to be insufficient to destroy German bombers.\n\nDuring the period between both World Wars, the size and weight of the fighters was progressively augmented in parallel with the increasing power of the available engines. Against that general trend, there was a minority of aeronautical designers defending the small sized fighters, known as 'Jockey Fighters' at that time. This type of airplanes, if well designed, could generally compete in performance with the conventional fighters, using a less powerful engine, with an important save in fuel, manpower and strategic materials. They were also easier to maintain and store and their reduced size and weight helped to increase agility in combat, making more difficult to be seen by the rear gunners in the bombers, or by the pilots in the escort fighters, and their destruction required a higher consumption of ammunition.\n\nAt the beginning of World War II, the conventional fighters used to have 10 to 12 m of wingspan, operational weight of 2,500 to 3,500 kg and a maximum speed of 450 to 500 km/h. The light fighters of the time could be divided in two categories:\n\n‘Jockey Fighters’, with less than 10 m. wingspan, maximum weight of 1,800 to 2,500 kg and the same speed than the conventional fighters.\n\n‘Midget Fighters’, with less than 10 m wingspan, maximum weight of 600 to 1,800 kg and maximum speed of 350 to 400 km/h.\n\nPotez 230​\n\nThe Potez 230 inherited the most advanced elliptical wing of the time, built with an integral torque box, from its ancestor, Les Mureaux 190 light fighter, developed during the 30s. The philosophy of design of the Potez 230 was based on the specification Chasseur Monoplace C1 (June 3, 1937), calling for one high-performance small airplane that could use some technical elements left aside by first line fighters.\n\nThus, the surplus of Hispano-Suiza H.S.12 Xcrs engines, H.S.9 cannons and MAC 34A machine guns coming from the obsolete Dewoitine D.510 fighters could go back to combat without overloading the French war production of H.S.12 Y-45, H.S.404 and MAC 34 M39, intended for the Dewoitine D.520. Would the new equipment be available in enough quantity, it would also had been used by the Potez 230 as it was compatible to both of them.\n\nA prototype was built in the Potez C.A.M.S. factory of Sartrouville in 1939. During a series of tests performed in the Villacoublay test centre in March 1940, it reached the speed of 560 km/h being equipped with an H.S.12 Xcrs of just 680 hp (the Dewoitine D.520 reached 525 km/h and the Bf 109 E-1, 575 km/h with much more powerful engines). It was expected that the Potez 230 could fly at 622 km/h after the installation of one of the new H.S.12 Y-45 of 910 hp but it was captured by German forces in June and translated to a technical research centre of the Luftwaffe to study the wing construction system.\n\nTechnical data\n\nEngine: one 680 hp Hispano-Suiza H.S.12 Xcrs twelve-cylinder ‘Vee’ liquid-cooled, driving a three-bladed Ratier airscrew with pneumatic variable-pitch. Armament: one 20 mm engine-mounted H.S.9 cannon and four 7.5 mm. MAC 34A machine guns mounted under the wings. Wingspan: 8.74 m, length: 7.57 m, height: 2.18 m, wing area: 10.97 sq.m, maximum weight: 1,800 kg, maximum speed: 560 kph.\n\nRoussel R.30​\n\nThe Roussel R.30 was conceived as a private venture ‘Jockey Fighter’ in answer to the Programme technique A.23 (12 January 1937) that required a light fighter able to fly at 520 km/h. Construction of the prototype began at Courbevoie, flying for the first time equipped with a 690 hp Gnôme-Rhône 14 M7 engine in April 1939.\n\nIn August 1939 it was transferred to the Centre d’Essais du Matériel Aérien (C.E.M.A.) for official trials, as a result of which it was recommended to install a more powerful engine to better use its excellent flying performances. During the Battle of France, the airplane was armed with two 20 mm Oerlikon FFS cannons mounted in the wings and some tests were performed for the installation of a bomb rack under the fuselage.\n\nIn combat, the R.30 could have destroyed any Luftwaffe bomber thanks to its high fire power of 2 Kg/sec, 2.8 times that of the Bf 109 E-1. In ground attack mode it would have had more possibilities to survive the Flak than the unfortunate Breguet 693 of the GBA 54 due to its high speed and small size. The only prototype was destroyed in Bordeaux-Mérignac airbase during a He111 bomb raid.\n\nTechnical data\n\nEngine: one 690 hp Gnôme-Rhône 14 M7 of fourteen-cylinder, air-cooled radial driving a Ratier 1527 airscrew with electrically adjusted pitch. Armament: two 20 mm Oerlikon FFS cannons and one 250 kg G.P. bomb. Wingspan: 7.75 m, length: 6.15 m, height: 2.10 m, wing surface: 10 sq.m, maximum weight: 1,766 kg, maximum speed: 520 kph at 6,000 m.\n\nBloch M.B.700​\n\nThe Bloch M.B.700 was also designed as an answer to the Programme technique A.23. This small interceptor differentiated from the Roussel in that it was built from wood. This fact made its mass production easier as it did not require strategic materials that could be used for the Dewoitine D.520 conventional fighter. Outwardly, it looked like an 83% scaled down version of the conventional fighter Bloch M.B.152. The main advantage of the M.B.700 reduced size was that while equipped with an engine with 75% the power of an M.B.152, it flew 80 kph faster, still carrying the same armament, and was a more difficult target in dog-fight.\n\nIn 1939 a prototype was built in the Blériot-Aéronautique of Suresnes, flying for the first time by mid-April 1940. During the flight tests made on 13 May, it reached a maximum speed of just 380 kph, instead of the expected 580 km/h. As a consequence, the Mercier engine cowling and clear canopy were modified, and external plates were installed in the main undercarriage.\n\nThe airplane was destroyed shortly afterwards by the German troops in Buc airfield. There was a plan for a shipboard variant named M.B. 720 with tail hook and the armament reduced to four MAC 1934 M 39 machine guns.\n\nTechnical data\n\nEngine: one 700 hp Gnôme-Rhône 14 M6 fourteen-cylinder, air-cooled radial engine driving a Gnôme Rhône variable-pitch airscrew. Armament: two 20 mm Hispano-Suiza H.S. 404 cannons and two 7.5 mm MAC 1934 M39 belt-feed machine guns mounted in the wings. Wingspan: 8.9 m, length: 7.34 m, height: 3.4 m, wing surface: 12.4 sq.m, maximum weight: 2,000 kg, maximum speed: 550 kph.\n\nCaudron C.R. 714​\n\nOn 12 July 1934 the Service Technique de l’Aéronautique laid down the Programme Technique de Chasseur Léger C.1, a specification for a light weight interceptor with a maximum speed of 400 kph and armed with four machine guns. The original specification was amended in August 22 dividing it in two categories: one for aircraft powered by 800-1,000 hp engines, armed with a cannon and two machine guns, and another for 450-500 hp engines and two cannons. On 17 December 1934 the maximum speed rose to 450 kph and on 16 November 1935 to 500 kph. The winner of the first category was the Morane-Saulnier M.S.405, winning the production of the 860 hp Hispano-Suiza H.S.12 Y engines.\n\nIn the second category were competing small manufacturers and designers of racer airplanes experienced in obtaining the maximum speed with minimum power, often using self-made engines. The success achieved by the Caudron racers, encourage designer Marcel Riffard to build the C.710 and C.713 prototypes, two wooden, cannon-armed, light fighters capable of flying to 455-470 kph powered by a 450 hp Renault 12 R.01 engine. On December 1937 l’Armée de l’Air dismissed its serial construction in favor of the Arsenal VG 30, much faster and with better climb rate.\n\nOn November 1938, to meet the requirements of Plan V, l’Armée de l’Air ordered the production of 200 units of the C.R. 714 model, an aerodynamically improved version, with a 450 hp Renault 12 R.03, twelve-cylinder, air-cooled, inverted-Vee engine and four MAC 1934 M39 machine guns. The order was later reduced to only 20 aircraft when all the spruce stocks were assigned to the massive construction program of the Arsenal VG 33.\n\nOn January 1940 the C.R. 714 were handed over to l’Armée de l’Air who used them as advanced trainers at l’École de Chasse et d’Instruction Polonaise. The G.C. I/145 was formed during the Battle of France with M.S. 406 and C.R. 714 fighters piloted by Poles who claimed the destruction of four Bf 109 and four Do 17. The formula was perfectioned with the C.R. 760 and C.R. 770 prototypes, powered by 730-800 hp engines and armed with six MAC, but both were destroyed to prevent their capture by the Germans.\n\nC.A.P.R.A. R.300​\n\nThe midget fighters usually are a good defensive solution when a country feels threatened and needs to quickly increase its production of combat airplanes. The C.A.P.R.A. R.R.20 was a small racer airplane designed by Roger Robert in 1938 to compete in the Coupe Deutsch 1939 race. After the declaration of war the project was modified to be used as a fighter-trainer under the name R.30 or as the R.300 Midget Fighter.\n\nEntirely built in metal, the R.30 would be powered by a 360 hp Bèarn 6C-1, six-cylinder in-line air-cooled engine, with which it was expected to reach 539 kph maximum speed and 9,500 m service ceiling. The wings, spanning 7.5 m with sq.m surface, would serve as housing for the hyper- sustentation system, the Messier landing gear and the armament, possibly two MAC 34A machine guns for the R.300 version. Not a single unit was built.\n\nAttachments\n\n038.jpeg\n\n042.jpeg\n\n043.jpeg\n\n044.jpeg\n\n045.jpeg\n\nthe Bloch-Potez megacorp of 1934\n\nI never heard about this, but it seems to have big ATL potential.\n\nPotez and Bloch were born the same year or so (1892) and they had the same banker: Abed François Chirac (yes, CHIRAC, as in JACQUES CHIRAC. Guess why ? it was his father.)\n\nI suppose the \"megacorp\" you mention was eviscerated in 1936 - since Potez-Méaulte become SNCA-Nord, and Bloch in Talence (near Bordeaux) part of SNCASO ?\n\nAbout these nationalizations, Potez, Bloch, and Chirac Sr. went into weird business with the government, with all kind of bizarre deals.\n\nPotez, notably, created a \"new private Potez\" company in 1937; he put Chirac Sr. as manager... and then got himself re-hired by the SNCA-Nord, now in shambles after a botched nationalization.\n\nSo by 1938 there were kind of TWO potez companies, one private, one public !\n\nThe government gave money to Potez and Bloch as compensations for seizing their companies. Banker Chirac helped them to re-create private aviation companies with the said money.\n\nstrange days !\n\nThis was formed between 1932 and 1934 as part of the centralisation policy encouraged by the Air Ministry. Potez and Bloch made deals to buy out numerous small manufacturers, among which CAMS, ANF Les Mureaux, SAB (Société Aérienne Bordelaise), Motobloc and Lorraine (engine and automobile part at least).\n\nUnfortunately, Potez and Bloch mostly exploited that policy to increase their factory surface and thus get more aircraft orders, but production wasn't rationally distributed, the design bureaus weren't really working together and tooling wasn't really modernised that much in most places. The group would need to be disciplined by a politician who is also willing to cooperate with the industry and provide the financial means to retool.\n\nIMO, Paul Reynaud might be the man for the job if he becomes War or Finance Minister as he was in favor of rearmament and industrial revitalization, was well-versed in defence matters and wanted the state to help the corporations and orient their efforts without actual nationalisations. He might also see through the shenanigans of Potez and Bloch.\n\nIdeal option might be Doumergue following Reynaud's and André Tardieu's advice on the state reform and retiring after the resulting snap elections in 1934, with Tardieu becoming Président du Conseil, Reynaud at Finance or War Ministry (Pétain at war if Reynaud picks Finance, maybe) and other industrialist politicians like Amaury de La Grange being involved. That should avoid the Front Populaire-style govt and ensures proper funding with \"bellicists\"* in power.\n\n*bellicists in the sense that they were in favor of rearmament and a hard line against the Germans to save peace, as opposed to the pacifism of Flandin on the right or most of the French left.\n\nIn any case, a proper use of the companies against the Bloch-Potez megacorp would provide great synergies. Potez \"teaching\" Bloch about mass producible aircrafts and better aerodynamics, Lorraine improving on the Petrel and Sterna engines for the aircrafts developped by the corp, ANF being experienced with smaller aircrafts...​\n\nPicking up on this thread from late last year, I have been reading up on and speculating about French aviation before and during WWII. The well-known Caudron C.714 in which the Polish pilots demonstrated their skill and bravery around Lyon in 1940 despite an inferior mount was a retractable gear, wood and fabric, 500 hp light fighter with four rifle-caliber machine guns that managed a maximum speed of 465 kph at 1400/1750 kg empty/gross weight.\n\nThe C.714 (1938) was derived from the earlier retractable gear C.713 (1937), which was itself a retractable gear version of the fixed gear C.710 (1936). Both earlier designs were armed with 2 x 20mm cannon instead of the 4 x 7.5mm machine guns of the C.714 and look at the speeds. The C.713 was the fastest of the three, achieving 470 kph at 1300/1665 kg empty/gross weight. But the original fixed gear C.710 (1936) could already do 455 kph at 1243/1645 kg empty gross weight.\n\nSince the C.714 was the only one to become operational, it’s logical that it became the heaviest with additional military equipment, but the 57 kg jump in empty weight from the C.710 to the C.713 seems entirely due to the retractable gear. Was it really worth it in the end for such a small speed gain, just 15 kph or about 9 mph?\n\nWhat if the French had just adopted and fielded the C.710 in 1937, refining the design based on operations and expanding the woodworking shops so that there would have been hundreds available to face the Nazi invasion? A special racing version of the Renault 12R engine made 730 hp, which was certainly not sustainable, but tweaking the engine for just 50 or 100 hp more would have made a big difference.\n\nAs it was, the C.710 was fast enough and certainly well enough armed to hunt the Stuka and Henschel dive bombers and even the Do-17 bombers while more capable Dewoitine, Morane-Saulnier, and Bloch fighters dealt with the Bf-109s, Bf-110s, and fast He-111 bombers. Swarms of small Caudron fixed-gear light fighters with twin 20mm cannon would have been a nightmare for Luftwaffe attack aircraft and light bombers.\n\nOn top of that, the Renault 12R was quite heavy for its power, 429 kg dry weight for 500 hp. Something like the excellent and relatively small Gnome-Rhône 14M radial was putting out 635 hp at this time and 700 or 750 hp by the war. It's not hard to imagine a switch to the radial for an improved model that was not much if any faster but could climb faster and carry more weight of weapons, even some armor for the pilot, fuel, and engine. Just for fun, here is a tight 1.0 m cowling around a 0.95 m diameter Gnome-Rhône 14M to scale with the C.710. It would have required a wider fuselage and longer landing gear for propeller clearance but it could have worked.\n\n1. The French British Purchasing Commission had carte blanche to buy needed weapons etc. in 1938-39. Start that sooner. More DB7s would have reached combat if they'd been ordered earlier.\n\n2. Regarding the ideas to build French-weaponry-specific factories in Louisiana or Quebec...where French-speaking workers were available, simplifying documentation and management...or in Savannah: good ideas, but movement on the French side was far too slow. What was the holdup? If the authority existed to buy weapons, why not get going on a capability to make what you'd otherwise have someone else make?\n\n2a. Sometimes factories must be justified by more than one weapon category or type. One sometimes-discussed focus for the Savannah complex was to be the next generation of tanks--perhaps the G tank, following on the S and B generations. While Savannah had plenty of hard-worker availability and good enough infrastructure, that part of Georgia had no experience with such mechanical manufacturing. History shows that the best place for WWII US automotive manufacturing was the Midwest, where the largest concentration of worker experience, subject-knowledgeable engineers and managers, and specialized suppliers existed. Access to those resources would have outweighed any transient significance of language issues.\n\n2b. Packard was able to arrange a license to build Merlin engines in USA, for use in British and US aircraft. Perhaps a license to build Merlin engines in a US or French factory for use in French aircraft could have been arranged.\n\n3. One of Europe's best weapon manufacturers, Fabrique Nationale in Herstal, Belgium, was underutilized by France. Enter into an agreement with FN that they will receive substantial contracts if they build a second factory in France, far from potential invasion areas, and produce equivalent value to the French orders there. France keeps the jobs, and gets more weapons manufacturing capability.\n\n3a. Late-1930s French aircraft often were armed with either rifle caliber MGs with low destructive power, or autocannon that were physically very large. FN's versions of the classic Browning heavy machinegun were 13.2mm rather than the 12.7mm of the original Browning design, but offered the same external dimensions as US made guns, and in general provided a very favorable balance of lethality and mounting considerations. In particular, in 1939 FN developed a unique 13.2mm x 99 HEI/HEIT shell for their family of HMGs that was very efficient in testing against metal aircraft skins and internals. HEI/HEIT was a capability that no one had been able to develop for 12.7mm Browning HMGs...the necessary fuze being just too difficult to make reliable at that slightly smaller size. FN 13,2mm aircraft HMGs had a slightly slower ROF than US 12.7mm guns, but because their projectiles were somewhat heavier, their throw weight per unit time was almost exactly equal. Even though the French military already distributed 13.2mm x 99 HMG ammo for its ground Hotchkiss HMGs, FN was unable to gain designed-in status for its 13.2mm HMG family in any French aircraft, even though France was buying US aircraft engineered and built for Browning HMGs, and gaining the destructive-capability increase of FN's 13.2mm guns would have been a bolt-in swap. That was an unforced error.\n\n3b. A relationship with FN would be most productive if it encompassed other French needs beyond those related to aircraft and for whatever reason, not adequately met by existing suppliers. France also needed more and better SMGs for the infantry. Again, FN could have helped.\n\n3c. French ability to project force via aircraft depends to a considerable extent on French ground forces' understanding of the value of air power. In that regard, French ground forces often made impossible demands for protection from German air attack by insufficient French air resources that would have been better allocated toward other air missions. That occurred partly because France had far too little light AA capability. Hotchkiss offered several 13.2mm HMG weapons...a man- or animal-drawn cart single gun mount, and various vehicle single- or multiple-gun mounts...but all were rejected because the bullets eventually would fall back to earth and were thought to be a hazard to friendly personnel. The hazard of unopposed German ground attack aircraft apparently was thought of lesser importance. In particular, Hotchkiss HMGs firing FN's 13,2mm x 99 HEI/HEIT might have been relatively effective against low altitude aircraft.\n\n4. France also had far too little medium AA capability, even though they had all of the pieces in production for export. In particular, Hotchkiss's naval-mount single and dual gun versions of their 25mm autocannon, in the CAMle1940 increased-ROF version, readily could have been mounted to all-terrain, high-mobility platforms like the Laffly S25TL truck chassis. That gun family, in a 2/3-ROF earlier-design licensed version, proved inadequate for the Japanese against 1943-44 US aircraft. In 1940 French service, though, it would have been far better than nothing at all.\n\n5. Part of France's problems with understanding air power and using it sensibly evolved from insufficient French ability to hold back ground assaults that too rapidly overran forward French air facilities, resulting in loss of air assets on the ground. France's Edgar Brandt company was the 1940 world leader in practical HEAT ordnance, and a world leader in tungsten-carbide-core ordnance. Some histories say that the French Army had ordered and received 75,000 or 150,000 rounds of Brandt's 50mm HEAT rifle grenade along with associated rifle adapters, but this already-received ordnance was not provided to front line troops because training materials had not yet been developed for it and there was a concern that it would be used inefficiently.\n\n5a. Similarly, Brandt had developed a tungsten-carbide-core round for France's ubiquitous Mle1897-based 75mm artillery pieces, which provided a better-than-doubled armor penetration capability at much longer range. A few rounds were fielded, but not enough to make a difference...even though France unlike Germany had plenty of tungsten availability.\n\n5b. And, Brandt had developed a 75mm HEAT round that would have allowed low-velocity artillery pieces, including infantry support guns, to have good defensive lethality against attacking 1940-era AFVs. A significant stockpile of such guns, removed from WWI infantry support tanks, was sitting unused in warehouses. That round wasn't bought by the Army at all.\n\nOne question: Did the Armée de Terre and Armée de l'Air share ammunition supply streams? If not, it probably would have been simpler - especially for foreign-buit fighters like the Hawk 75As - to stick with 12.7x99mm.\n\nMy understanding is that even the Army Infantry and the Army Cavalry didn't share supply streams...or weapon/vehicle choices, or purchasing processes. The Third Republic's military was very good (i.e. bad) at bureaucracy\n\nIn 1936, there was a note from an Infantry officer who suggested unifying the cavalry and infantry light tank programs (cavalry one is AMC 34/35 program, not the program for SOMUA), since requirements were quite close. G1 started out with nearly identical reqs to SOMUA S35 (or uparmored version), and it would have made sense to adopt that in the interim for the Infantry since the spirit of G1 originally was to supply required numbers of battle tanks to meet the program for 1934-38/40 while being cheaper and more mass producible than B1, and more mobile than both B1 and D2 (the latter being kind of a failure).\n\nUnfortunately the program was hijacked to make a \"better B1\" which might have been fine on its own (kinda B1 Ter but earlier and more practical), and then a super tank, but both those routes\n\n- didn't meet the timeline to actually equip pre-40 forces\n\n- would be expensive\n\n- killed the cheap 20t mobile tank program until it was revived in 1940 as the successor to the light tanks, far too late\n\nLoved every single word of the above post.\n\n1. The French British Purchasing Commission had carte blanche to buy needed weapons etc. in 1938-39. Start that sooner. More DB7s would have reached combat if they'd been ordered earlier.\n\nIt all started in March 1938 with the Anschluss crisis, not sure France could accelerate the move. The US aircraft industry was a colossus, but a very sleepy one - before roaring in anger by 1942.\n\nWhat could be done would be to cut into the (hopeless) French designs funding, and \"transfer\" the money to US purchases. But that would be seen as a huge betrayal by both French Right and French Left, altogether - nationalistic proudness versus employement of empoverished french workers, no way in both cases.\n\nThe bigger problem is that US products were VERY expensive, and propping up the US while neglecting your own industry may end up being worse in the long term for the money invested. For all its faults, the French aeronautic industry was getting there by 1940 and it didn't succeed only because France lost that year anyway. But the weak AdA wasn't the biggest factor behind the defeat.\n\nIn any case, if you want to spend a lot of dollars and are already willing to make the prideful French industry mad, you might as well spend them hiring help from US engineers/companies/managers to fix it and the aircrafts. The still kinda inexperienced Bloch got US help to revamp MB 150 into the 152, making it much easier to mass produce and actually decent to fly. Imagine if the same was done to MB 130 series, Leo 451 and some of the more inefficient French designs that were selected for production.\n\nYou are mentionning the unions, but the bosses had their own political issues, and so had the political right. 1930's France was as deeply polarized as today's America, if not worse. When I saw the January 6, 2021 riot and tentative storming of the Capitol, I was instantly reminded of France very similar riot: February 6, 1934, which left 15 people dead near the Palais Bourbon & French parliament.\n\nThat was a very bad day. We were lucky François De La Rocque wasn't a full blown right wing nut, otherwise - game over for the Republic.\n\nThe true right wingers (L'Action Française) were not powerful enough and needed De la Rocque \"croix de feu\" to storm the Parliament. Both groups were having protests in Paris that day, but De La Rocque staunchly refused to side with L'Action Française and topple the Republic that way. Much like a proto- De Gaulle (May 1958... ) he wanted to size power the \"legal\" way (if such thing even exists !), not through a riot-coup-bloodbath. Hence the Croix de feux did not joined the riot near the Palais Bourbon. He earned a reputation of traitor and his troop was now called the \"froide queues\", a play on word with \"croix de feu\" which can be translated as \"cold dicks\". Nice !\n\nThe French Right was polarized to the extreme, because Mussolini, Salazar, and Hitler. Later Franco, who got ride of a Frente Popular quite similar to the Front Populaire on the other side of the Pyrénnées the same spring and summer 1936. Frente Popular won the election in February, Front Populaire in May.\n\nThe French Left was hardly better, being polarized toward Stalin.\n\nIn a standard French aviation plant of the time the political rift was between the workers and the management / direction - and the rift was huge.\n\n1936 and the Front Populaire, plus the Spanish civil war, polarized french politics even further.\n\nOn both sides was deep paranoia and fear about a coup. The bosses and French Right feared a communist coup; the workers and the left feared above all a Spanish Civil War like \"Pronunciamiento\".\n\nFunnily enough this drove successive aviation ministers Pierre Cot (Left, Front Populaire) and Guy La Chambre (Right, in 1938) to the same idea, same place: EAA-301 in Chateaudun.\n\nA place under strict military control, were onboard weapons (machine guns and 20 mm guns) would be added to combat aircraft. So that the communists workers or the fascists bosses (pick your choice !) could not steal the said weapons to stage a coup against the Republic. You never know !\n\nMain problem was that EAA-301 was ill-equiped to arm the planned 9500 aircraft the AdA wanted in its inventory by 1941. For the sake of comparison, during the harsh winter of 1939-40 they armed 300 aircraft.\n\nThe political rift really did not helped a smooth transition from a 1921-devastated aircraft industry to a modern one. Le Front Populaire took all 20 private companies, eviscerated them, nationalized them, and then proceed to create the SNCAs according to geography (see my earlier post).\n\nBasic idea: any aircraft plant located in the same corner of France (say, the North) must be folded into a local SNCA.\n\nThe reasonning was that plants close geographically would have easier time working together.\n\nWhat was ignored was the \"Frankenstein\" nature of the thing.\n\nBloch had a peculiar culture, Amiot a different one, and on. The plants may have been geographically close, culture wise they were aliens - plus of different quality and efficiency, some private companies were better than others.\n\nImagine that the US government forced Grumman and Republic into a mergeup just because they had two plants side by side in Long Island.\n\nDo you really think Grumman's culture (light and nimble Navy fighters) would be compatible with Republic (USAF heavy led sleds for ground attack) ?\n\nThat's what the Front Populaire did in 1936: the reasonning they adopted to try and reform. It did not worked. In the short term it created chaos.\n\nYou are mentionning the unions, but the bosses had their own political issues, and so had the political right. 1930's France was as deeply polarized as today's America, if not worse.

Aircraft company Boards of Directors perhaps hoped that North American labor would more highly value the jobs, and would strive to be cooperative because they saw themselves as competing with French labor for continued job opportunities.\n\nThe French industry likely would have had sufficient capacity if the labor and other issues could have been fixed. But, those issues were societal and cultural, and it was generally agreed there was no practical solution in the short term.\n\nIn any case, the way to move from a fractious, inefficient, tradition-bound manufacturing system in France...or anywhere...toward what some observers saw as more efficient and effective North American approaches to mass complex-machine manufacturing would not have been to import a few consultants. Consultants can identify problems, but they can't magically fix most of the issues they identify, which might have included labor attitudes, inefficient facilities, all the same issues at suppliers and subcontractors, local and regional infrastructure, and government interactions. The most assured way to successfully fix all of those issues at once would have been to build a new factory in a more optimal location, far enough away that the prior problems do not follow you. Established manufacturing companies in many industries and nations, seeking to rapidly evolve from a higher-cost, ineffective historical status so as to have a competitive future, have taken this approach.\n\nThe impact of the labor problems and nationalisations is a bit overstated, it existed but the lack of money in 1937 (solved in late 38/39) played a greater role (such as the grossly underfunded program to retrain unemployed workers which could offer substantial improvements). The labor problems themselves were pretty much solved in December 38 and even greater efficiency could have been achieved with a bit more authority. There was still time at this point to get enough aircrafts ready.\n\nIn general, most of the faults still lie at the Air Ministry (and I would add that the major technical mistakes this ministry made were not politically motivated) and Finance Ministry levels. The \"culture\" was not a permanent bottleneck."
