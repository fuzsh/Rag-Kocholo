        "text": "The airline industry is highly competitive but the competition among aircraft suppliers is relatively limited. Lesser-known makers of large passenger airplanes are attempting to build a more significant presence on the world's stage but there are just two major players in the large commercial aircraft market: the U.S.-based Boeing (BA) and the Airbus Group (EADSY), formerly known as the European Aeronautic Defense and Space Company (EADS).\n\nAirbus is the world's top commercial airplane manufacturer based on airplanes delivered. Boeing is in second place because its deliveries stalled due to the grounding of certain aircraft, the COVID-19 pandemic, and issues concerning its 737-MAX aircraft.\n\nThe Airplane Manufacturing Market\n\nThe airplane manufacturing market is part of the overall airline industry. The global market's estimated value was more than $424 billion in 2024 and is expected to grow to well more than half a trillion dollars by 2032. Companies in this market are involved in the manufacturing of airplanes and their components, including engines and propulsion systems.\n\nLarge Passenger Airplane Manufacturers\n\nBoeing and Airbus are the major large passenger aircraft manufacturers. They're the only two with jets that can meet the demands of large-scale commercial operations, at least in the West.\n\nThe two companies share almost exclusive control of the worldwide airplane supply business for large commercial jets. Their established brands are Boeing's 7-series and Airbus's A-series. These aircraft include narrow-body aircraft, wide-body aircraft, and jumbo jets.\n\nRegional and Other International Manufacturers\n\nBombardier, based in Canada, and Embraer, a Brazilian aircraft manufacturer, are leaders in the regional and business airplanes market. They both focus on smaller-sized jets.\n\nCompetition with Boeing and Airbus is brutal on a global scale but newer airline suppliers Comac in China, Mitsubishi in Japan, and UAC in Russia are working on a series of new wide-body jets in a joint venture. They hope to eventually become a legitimate competitor that can take on the dominance of Boeing and Airbus in the large-jet space.\n\nMilitary Airplane Manufacturers\n\nBoeing and Airbus have a significant market share in the supply of military aircraft, particularly in the U.S. Their competition in this market includes Lockheed Martin. Almost 40% of Boeing's revenues came from U.S. government contracts in 2023. Only about 18% of Airbus' revenues came from defense contracts in 2023.\n\nSuppliers to Airplane Manufacturers\n\nAerospace suppliers are critical to the aircraft manufacturing ecosystem. They provide essential components, systems, and materials that are required to build an aircraft. This includes avionics, propulsion systems, landing gear, cabin interiors, and composite materials.\n\nThese suppliers range from large companies that produce major systems to smaller specialized firms. Aircraft manufacturers rely on these suppliers for the initial construction of aircraft and ongoing maintenance and replacement parts.\n\nRaytheon Technologies Corporation (RTX) and General Electric (GE) are two major companies that manufacture airplane engines and other parts for industry operators. Rolls-Royce (RYCEY), Pratt & Whitney, and Honeywell (HON) also produce airplane jet and propeller engines.\n\nTop Aircraft Manufacturers\n\nThese are some of the largest aircraft manufacturers in the world. All data is current as of Q1 2024.\n\nBoeing (BA)\n\nHeadquarters: Chicago, Illinois, USA\n\nFounded: 1916\n\nMarket Cap: $130 billion\n\nEmployees: 171,000\n\nProducts: Known for manufacturing a wide range of commercial jetliners, Boeing's product line includes the 737, 747, 767, 777, and 787 families of airplanes. The company also offers military aircraft, satellites, and other aerospace products and services.\n\nAirbus (EADSY)\n\nHeadquarters: Leiden, Netherlands\n\nFounded: 1970\n\nMarket Cap: $128.6 billion\n\nCompany Size: 134,000\n\nProducts: Airbus is known for its commercial aircraft, including the A220, A320, A330, A350, and A380 families. The company also produces military planes and helicopters and provides aerospace-related services.\n\nLockheed Martin (LMT)\n\nHeadquarters: Bethesda, Maryland\n\nFounded: 1995 (from the merger of Lockheed Corporation and Martin Marietta)\n\nMarket Cap: $113.6 billion\n\nEmployees: 116,000\n\nProducts: While focused on defense and military aircraft, such as the F-16 and F-35 Lightning II, Lockheed Martin also engages in aeronautics, missiles, fire control, and space systems.\n\nEmbraer (ERJ)\n\nHeadquarters: SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil\n\nFounded: 1969\n\nMarket Cap: $3.2 billion\n\nEmployees: 18,000\n\nProducts: Embraer is known for its E-Jet and E-Jet E2 series of regional jets, popular among airlines for short to medium-haul flights.\n\nBombardier (BDRBF)\n\nHeadquarters: Montreal, Quebec, Canada\n\nFounded: 1942\n\nMarket Cap: $3.7 billion\n\nEmployees: 15,000\n\nProducts: The company's aerospace division is known for its business jets, including the Challenger and Global series.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThe airplane manufacturing market is valued at over $400 billion. It's a significant part of the global airline industry which is expected to grow considerably over the next decade.\n\nDominated by Boeing and Airbus, the major manufacturers of large commercial jets, this market is characterized by their iconic 7x7-series and A3xx-series jets. Suppliers including GE, Raytheon Technologies, and Rolls-Royce are pivotal in providing essential components like engines and avionics. The industry is adapting through flexible manufacturing and other changes while facing lingering challenges from the COVID-19 pandemic leading to reduced demand and production.\n\nBoeing has encountered significant mechanical challenges with its 737-MAX and 787 models, affecting its position in the global market."
