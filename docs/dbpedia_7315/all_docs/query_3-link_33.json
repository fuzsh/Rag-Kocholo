        "text": "The global aircraft engine market size was valued at USD 140.29 billion in 2023 and is projected to grow from USD 153.69 billion in 2024 to USD 279.76 billion by 2032, exhibiting a CAGR of 7.77% during the forecast period. North America dominated the aircraft engine market with a market share of 39.% in 2023.\n\nAircraft engines with higher fuel efficiency, compact size, and lightweight are in demand today. The rise in demand for air travel has led the airliners to increase their aircraft fleet size. This demand for new aircraft is expected to drive the growth of the market. Moreover, the rising issue of reducing the carbon footprint has diverted the focus on the development of advanced types of aircraft engines such as electric or hybrid engines, which is expected to fuel market growth. However, existing backlogs in aircraft deliveries are expected to restrain the aircraft engine market growth.\n\nThe spread of the COVID-19 pandemic raged in several countries around the world and dealt a major blow to the airline industry, which faced a financial crisis and a lack of passenger demand. Some airlines were completely shut down, and cancelation of flight bookings also directly affected the market. However, the market recovered slightly in 2021, with rise in airplane deliveries. For example, Airbus delivered 611 jets in 2021, compared to 566 in 2020, and Boeing delivered 302 jets in 2021, compared to 157 in 2020. The market recovered by 2022 as the government eased regulations.\n\nAircraft Engine Market Trends\n\n3D Printed Parts for Aircraft Engines Will Spur Opportunities for the Market\n\nNowadays, several engine manufacturers are focused on the development of lightweight engines to reduce the overall weight of the aircraft to increase the fuel efficiency of the aircraft. GE Aviation has developed an advanced turboprop engine, which is the first commercial aircraft engine with a large number of 3D printed components. The engine designers have reduced 855 separate parts down to 12 parts. This is expected to reduce the engine weight, which will require less fuel to achieve the same speed. Additive manufacturing makes the product durable and stronger. CFM international SA is developing an advanced LEAP engine that will be installed in The Boeing Company’s and Airbus’s new aircraft fleet of narrow-body aircraft. 15% reduction in fuel burn and emissions is resulted from deploying complex 3D printed fuel nozzles on the engine.\n\nRequest a Free sample to learn more about this report.\n\nAircraft Engine Market Growth Factors\n\nSurge in Adoption of Cost-Effective and Fuel-Efficient Aircraft is Accelerating Market Growth\n\nMajor OEMs and aircraft manufacturers around the world are focusing on developing fuel-efficient aircraft to reduce fuel consumption. Rising fuel prices have led manufacturers to focus on aircraft fuel efficiency. Since aircraft fuel efficiency is improved by reducing the overall weight of the aircraft, several manufacturers are developing lightweight engines that reduce the weight of the airplane. The use of lightweight and strong composite materials, such as reinforced plastics is driving the market growth.\n\nIn February 2024, GE Aerospace announced an USD 11 million investment to transform its Singapore aircraft engine repair facility into a modern “smart factory” that will revolutionize engine repair and workforce skills development to support new technologies.\n\nIncreasing Commercial Aircraft Deliveries Anticipated to Fuel the Market Growth\n\nEconomic growth in developing countries, such as India and China has increased the disposable income of individuals. The rapidly growing middle class population in these countries is the main reason for the increase in air passenger numbers. The rising demand for civil aircraft from India is directly reflected in the aircraft engine supply chain. Military aviation includes fighter aircraft and transport aircraft. Increasing deployment of fighter jets and fixed-wing Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) by various militaries across the world is expected to propel the market growth.\n\nAccording to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), the number of passengers traveling by air is expected to double to 8.2 billion by 2037.\n\nThe high demand for air travel has led airlines to expand their aircraft fleet, which is expected to boost the market growth. The procurement of new generation aircraft has increased owing to their improved features and fuel efficiency. The increasing procurement of business jets and commercial helicopters is one of the key factors surging the product demand.\n\nRESTRAINING FACTORS\n\nLongevity of Aircraft Engines Expected to Hamper the Market Growth\n\nAircraft engines are designed to have long life cycles. But it could be a factor that hinders the growth of the market. Due to the long life of these engines, there will be no demand for new engines except for new aircraft. The market is expected to be hindered due to the longevity of engines.\n\nMoreover, backlogs in the production of aircraft have drastically impacted the market growth. The production of aircraft is directly proportional to aircraft engines, hence backlogs in the production of aircraft is restraining the deliveries of aircraft engines.\n\nAircraft Engine Market Segmentation Analysis\n\nBy Engine Type Analysis\n\nTurbofan Segment Expected to Lead the Market Owing to Surging Demand for Commercial Jet\n\nBased on engine type, the market is divided into turboprop engine, turboshaft engine, turbofan engine, and piston engine. The turbofan engine segment held the largest aircraft engine market share in 2023 and is expected to be the fastest-growing segment during the forecast period. The market is driven due to rising demand for business jets in Asia Pacific. The turboshaft segment is also expected to have vital growth throughout the forecast period, owing to the growing demand for civil helicopter fleet.\n\nTo know how our report can help streamline your business, Speak to Analyst\n\nBy Technology Analysis\n\nElectric/Hybrid Engine Segment Anticipated to Grow at Higher CAGR due to Increasing Investment in Eco-friendly Technology\n\nBased on technology, this market is classified into conventional engines and electric/hybrid engines. The conventional engine segment is anticipated to hold the largest market share owing to the increasing adoption of the conventional engine in current commercial and military aircraft. However, the electric/hybrid engine segment is predicted to be the fastest-growing segment during the forecast period owing to the rising investment in research & development of eco-friendly electric/hybrid engine technology to reduce the carbon footprint and fuel consumption.\n\nBy Component Analysis\n\nTurbine Segment to Lead the Market Owing to Rising Development of Fuel-efficient Turbine Engine\n\nBased on the component, the market is segmented into compressor, turbine, gearbox, combustion chamber, fuel system, and others. The compressor segment is expected to grow at a higher CAGR during the forecast period owing to the rise in demand for turbofan engines.
