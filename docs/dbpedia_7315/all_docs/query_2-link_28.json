        "text": "Last year Renault sold 1,133,478 vehicles globally with almost three-quarters of that being European sales, and this year the company has sold 1,154,700 vehicles.\n\nThe company had even bigger gains in some of its key markets like Europe which saw a 6.7% increase in sales, outpacing the current market growth of 5.5%.\n\nFurthermore, the company’s electric vehicles accounted for 29.6% of sales in the region, which is 4.3% more than the previous year.\n\nRenault returned to growth in 2023, after 4 years of declining unit sales, and they are hoping that 10 new vehicle launches this year will help keep the momentum going.\n\nThe first-half number suggests growth in the second quarter slowed slightly after a 2.6% rise in the previous three months.\n\nFabrice Cambolive, Renault brand CEO, as reported by Reuters, told reporters that this was likely due to a drop in demand in international markets, including South Korea, India and Argentina.\n\nRenault highlighted the strong performance of its hybrid vehicles in Europe, but as a whole, the company’s passenger car sales dipped by 2% compared to last year's numbers.\n\nWhile their light commercial vehicles had a much faster growth rate of 14.6%, their low-cost Dacia brand also saw a sales volume increase of 3.8%."
