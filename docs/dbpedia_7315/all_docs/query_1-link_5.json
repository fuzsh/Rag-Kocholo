        "text": "A renowned moniker\n\nThe word ‘Rafale’ holds an immense reputation; as the name of a famous French fighter jet, it is laden with history of records and calls to mind the nation’s most prestigious achievements in aviation. That history began with Louis Renault 89 years ago, yet few are aware that the name ‘Rafale’ has belonged to Renault since 1936.\n\nIn the early 20th century, Renault was a pioneer in the creation of reciprocating engines not only for cars, but also for trains (railcars) and even aircraft. As Sylvia explained, “by contributing to aviation, Renault was already striving to go further and exceed expectations.”\n\nThe company’s eponymous founder Louis Renault was passionate about aviation and completed the acquisition of French aircraft manufacturer Caudron in 1933. He then created Caudron Renault, and renamed all of Caudron’s aircraft using wind-related terms: the C460 therefore became Rafale (French for “gust”) in 1934, the C500 became Simoun (“simoon”, a desert wind), the C640 became Typhon (“typhoon”) and the C714 Cyclone.\n\nThe first Rafale in history, the Caudron Renault C460, was a single-seat racing aircraft. It was designed to break records and just a handful were produced, which could have consigned the aircraft to oblivion. But the stylistic daring of the aircraft’s cutting-edge aerodynamics and its extraordinary performances left their mark on aviation history, making the model a legend.\n\nSylvia said, “Renault’s pioneering spirit and urge to go further were shared by famous aviators, such as Maryse Bastié and Hélène Boucher.”\n\nThe famous aviator Hélène Boucher beat a number of speed records in the Rafale, including the women’s record for distances over 1,000 km when she reached 445 km/h on 11 August 1934.\n\nAnd, in a nod to history, “Renault’s Technocentre is now based in Guyancourt – which is where the training base and runways of the Caudron Renault aerodrome were located!” smiled Sylvia.\n\nAviation and automotives alike are pioneering disciplines that drive progress and innovation. In line with its renowned heritage of the same name, the All-new Renault Rafale strives for excellence through its design and aerodynamics. Its breathtaking shape was designed to set it apart as an iconic and resolutely French SUV coupe in Renault’s upmarket range.\n\n“The name ‘Rafale’ immediately brings to mind technology, performance and a sense of daring, as well as driving pleasure and agility,” said Sylvia. “It is a thoroughly meaningful name that draws on our history while perfectly evoking the positioning of our future upmarket SUV coupe. I am sure that a promising future awaits Rafale, alongside the other vehicles in the Renault range.”\n\nA breath of fresh air in the upmarket range\n\nThe new Rafale will therefore represent Renault’s upmarket range. To illustrate the brand’s strategy in the D segment, together with the All-new Espace, the model needed a striking name with impact and its own unique character. And the choice of name, ‘Rafale’, was no coincidence – it is logical and full of meaning.\n\nFor many, the word itself immediately summons certain associations – subliminally bringing to mind an entire universe, and particularly aviation. “In the 1930s, Caudron Renault tested technology in aviation that it would then use to develop future cars – like how Formula 1 is now a source of technology for current vehicles,” explained Sylvia.\n\nIn French, the elegantly-pronounced word rafale is a term for a force of nature, and naturally brings to mind the image of something gliding through the air. And in aviation and automotives alike, Rafale is linked to aerodynamics and efficiency – and particularly a streamlined shape. “Rafale evokes the wind that appears to have sculpted its aerodynamic bodywork. The word alludes to the vehicle’s streamlined silhouette and strong character,” said Sylvia.\n\nLast but not least, as rafale is a French word, it symbolises a very French sense of excellence. Sylvia concluded, “like the Austral and the Espace, the Rafale’s name draws on our DNA by reminding us of our French roots.”"
