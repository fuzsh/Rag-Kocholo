        "text": "True to his policy of small technical steps, Marcel Dassault and his engineers set out to bring French military aviation up to the highest world standards.\n\nThe Ouragan flew in 1949. It was the first mass-produced French jet fighter and the first French military aircraft exported after World War II. Its successor, the Mystère II, was the first French aircraft to officially break the sound barrier. The Mystère IV, in spite of an external aerodynamic apparently identical to that of the Mystère II, is an entirely new aircraft: section of the fuselage piriform, thinner wing with increased arrow (32° with 25% of the chord), clearly higher power. It is equipped with hydraulic servos. The Ouragan and the Mystère IV were used by the Patrouille de France. The Super-Mystère B-2 is the first fighter aircraft produced in Western Europe to reach supersonic speed in horizontal flight at low altitude. The production of the Super-Mystère B-2 brought a significant evolution in manufacturing. The wing and empennages benefit from a new technology, called integral structure. It reduces the assembly time and allows a gain in weight as well as robustness. It also allows an increase in the volume of fuel carried.\n\nWith 1,089 aircraft produced, 271 of which were exported, the renewal of French wings is assured.\n\nThe symbol of Dassault Aviation’s success. For its collaborators, this aircraft is Marcel Dassault’s greatest stroke of genius. Its success during the Six-Day War made it world famous. Launched at the end of 1955, the Mirage III 001 flew at Melun-Villaroche on November 17, 1956, in the hands of Roland Glavany. The aircraft is very versatile. With few modifications, it could be used for interception, tactical fighter, ground attack or reconnaissance. The last examples were withdrawn from operational units in 1994. Some of them continued to serve at the French government’s flight test center (CEV) after that date. Thanks to the 1,400 Mirage III/5/50s produced, France proved that it was a leading industrial nation.\n\nDeveloped following the Suez crisis (1956), this is a supersonic twin-engine bomber capable of flying 4,500 km with in-flight refuelling. The external resemblance of this magnificent aircraft with the Mirage III is striking, in particular the delta wing. The Mirage IV is the first component of the French strategic nuclear deterrent. Dassault Aviation is the prime contractor for the complete weapon system: aircraft, navigation and bombing system, as well as the nuclear weapon envelope and separation. The Mirage IV made its first flight on June 17, 1959 at Melun-Villaroche, piloted by Roland Glavany. Sixty-two production aircraft equipped the French strategic nuclear forces between 1964 and 2005.\n\nThis supersonic twin-engine tactical support and advanced training aircraft was designed and built by France and Great Britain. Within the joint company SEPECAT, Breguet, then Dassault Aviation from 1967 onwards, and the British Aircraft Corporation, developed and produced the Jaguar in its various versions, single-seater or two-seater.\n\nThe first prototype flew at Istres on September 8, 1968, piloted by Bernard Witt.\n\n605 Jaguars were produced, 200 of which served in the French Air Force from 1973 to 2005, and 203 in the Royal Air Force from 1973 to 2007. The Jaguar has been exported to Ecuador, India, Nigeria and Oman. It has been involved in several conflicts, including the Gulf War in 1991, where it carried out delicate missions thanks in particular to its laser-guided weapons.\n\nThe Mirage 2000 entered service with the French Air Force in 1984 in its air defense version (C and B), and has been appreciated by its users. The arrival of the Mirage 2000 marked the beginning of a new era. The various versions of the aircraft have brought significant improvements in terms of maneuverability, pilot comfort, safety, operational capabilities and countermeasures. The quality and safety of its flight controls, as well as the simplicity of its maintenance, are renowned. Deployed in combat in many operational theaters, the Mirage 2000 has become a benchmark in terms of availability, maintenance and scalability. Its interoperability with other NATO aircraft and its combat effectiveness have been proven. More than 600 Mirage 2000 have been produced, including 286 for seven foreign air forces."
