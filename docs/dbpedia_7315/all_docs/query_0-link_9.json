        "text": "Renault has sold over 3 million Master vans since 1980, and has made them in Batilly, eastern France, since the beginning. The model’s rich history and success over these 40-plus years and three generations has ranked it as a long-standing leader in its category in Europe. Renault Master vans are on roads in more than 50 countries, including several in South America since 1990. The fourth Renault Master generation is shaping up to extend its success.\n\n“Our goal with the New Renault Master was to get as close as we could to the ideal van. Tradespeople, contractors and fleet managers will see a real leap forwards, a vehicle that is there for them whenever they need it, to maximise their productivity. A van they can lean on for their work, day in and day out, whatever type of energy they choose.”\n\nHélène Carvalho, Renault Master programme leader\n\nPART 1: DESIGN\n\nTHE COCKPIT DOUBLES UP AS A PROPER WORKSTATION\n\n“We put the customer – and simplifying their daily life – at the centre of everything we did. We stopped at nothing to make sure the New Renault Master doubles up as a proper, practical, comfortable and, especially, ultra-high-quality workstation.”\n\nLouis Morasse, design director, LCV Range, Renault\n\nTHE AEROVAN DESIGN ENHANCES ENERGY EFFICIENCY\n\nThe extraordinary amount of work that went into the New Renault Master’s aerodynamics puts its efficiency at the top of its class, whatever energy you use. Its Scx is more than 20% lower, and substantially below that of the previous generation and all current rivals.\n\nEven the smallest details helped: the bonnet is shorter, the windscreen is further forward and tilted, the wing mirrors, air intake ducts in the bumper and roofline slope were streamlined, and the rear is narrower. And the sharper aerodynamics have also improved acoustic comfort in the cockpit.\n\nAs the vehicle is too large for the wind tunnel that Renault typically uses, in Saint-Cyr, the aerodynamic development studies were conducted using 83% scale models. The full-size vans were then tested in a tunnel built to assess aircraft aerodynamics.\n\nAll this work has improved efficiency in very real ways. The New Renault Master’s CO2 emissions are a substantial 39 g/km lower, and now below the 200 g/km mark. Its remarkable aerodynamics also considerably lower consumption in the electric versions with a 20% improvement on the current Master.\n\nPART 2: THE MULTI-ENERGY PLATFORM\n\nRegardless of the powertrain they choose, the New Renault Master customers will drive the most efficient vehicle in its category (at the time of New Master’s reveal, in November 2023). This will lower their operating costs, and their vans will be able to carry more payload (up to 2 tonnes).\n\nAll versions are built on the same assembly line, which provides a great deal of flexibility to handle customisation requests. The New Renault Master is the only vehicle in its class to be made in France: the three energy versions and all the bodies come from the same line in Batilly (near Metz, in Eastern France). The powertrains and gearboxes are made in France, the batteries are assembled in France, and 84% of the suppliers are based in France.\n\nDIESEL BLUE DCI\n\nFour Diesel Blue dCi powertrains, delivering 105, 130, 150 or 170 hp, are available with the New Master. They consume substantially less (1.5 litres less per 100 km on average) and release less CO2 (39 grams less per km, below 200 grams per km). The transmission can be governed by a conventional manual gearbox or a particularly efficient new 9-speed automatic EAG9 converter gearbox.\n\nELECTRIC\n\nThe full-electric New Renault Master versions are powered by a 96 kW or 105 kW motor, in both cases delivering 300 Nm of torque. The first runs on a 40-kWh battery and has a 180 km WLTP range, the second on an 87 kWh battery with more than 460 km WLTP range.\n\nAs a result, the New Renault Master boasts record-high payload capacity (1,625 kg in a van requiring a B-category driving licence), range (more than 460 km WLTP) and towing muscle (2.5 tonnes). Its consumption remains reasonable, at a WLTP standardised 21 kWh/100 km with the large 87 kWh battery, thanks to the battery heat management system. A 130 kW DC fast charge adds 229 km of range in 30 minutes. A 22 kW AC home charger tops up the battery from 10% to 100% in just under 4 hours.\n\nNote: details on all the connected services in the electric versions (charge scheduling, preheating, etc.) are provided in the section on Connectivity below.\n\nHYDROGEN\n\nThe New Renault Master is also designed to accommodate a hydrogen H2-Tech engine and fuel cell in future.\n\nPART 3: TECHNOLOGY\n\nA UNIQUE BRAKING SYSTEM\n\nThe novel power-assisted dynamic braking control system in the New Renault Master keeps braking effectiveness and pedal feel the same regardless of how much weight the van is carrying. It also triggers the automatic emergency braking system sooner (response time is divided by two) and enhances regeneration, extending electric vehicles’ range.\n\n20 DRIVER ASSISTANCE SYSTEMS\n\nThe New Renault Master’s set of 20 driver assistance systems maximises safety for the people in and around it. Its active safety features are on high alert, and include its lateral stability, automatic emergency braking and trailer stability assist systems. And it comes with Intelligent Speed Assist, to help the driver stay within the speed limit.\n\nV2X FUNCTIONALITIES IN ELECTRIC VERSIONS\n\nThe New Renault Master vans will include Vehicle-to-Load (V2L) and Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) capabilities. These include charging other devices from an outlet in the cockpit or load area, as well as adaptors to plug power tools, computers and other devices into charger outlets. You can also power custom-built body parts (refrigerated compartments, automatic tailgates, extra heating or air-conditioning systems, etc.) directly from the battery.\n\nThe New Renault Master will also be able to feed energy from its battery to the grid (V2G) using a bidirectional charger.\n\nALL THE LATEST CONNECTIVITY\n\nThe New Renault Master is digital-native van and factory-fitted with all the features to enhance its performance. The OpenR Link multimedia system – the most intuitive on the market – comes as standard with every model. It includes a 10-inch screen and wired and wireless Android Auto and Apple CarPlay connections to replicate a smartphone screen. This system is also smart and scalable: it will grow to encompass new functionalities over time, with free over-the-air updates (like smartphone updates) for more than 20 calculators, for 5 years.\n\nOpenR Link with Google built-in: more connected and more efficient\n\nThis is the first time the ultra-modern OpenR Link system with Google built-in capabilities is available* in an LCV. Meaning drivers will have access to Google Maps navigation capabilities, the Google Play app catalogue and the voice-controlled Google Assistant directly integrated in the dashboard**.\n\nThe New Renault Master drivers can connect the system to their Google account – like a smartphone – for an optimal online experience. The modular interface displays Google Maps by default and you can add two widgets (the choice includes Music, Telephone, Google Assistant, Vehicle, Date and time, Tyre pressure and more). Then you can use the menu bar to the left of the screen to effortlessly navigate around the universes (Home screen/Google Maps, Music, Apps, Vehicle). The cockpit also has a wireless smartphone charger to avoid cable cluttering.\n\nGoogle Assistant for extra convenience throughout the working day\n\nOpenR Link is simple, intuitive and works like a tablet. You can interact with it using the touchscreen or your voice via Google Assistant (for instance if you want to listen to music). You can also use this hands-free virtual assistant to listen to the news, check the weather forecast, adjust the air condition or switch the de-icer on or off, for example, without taking your eyes off the road. If you link your Google Account to OpenR Link, Google Assistant can also be proactive – for instance suggesting a destination based on your habits.\n\nHandy apps for pros\n\nAvailable from Google Play, specific applications prove highly beneficial for daily professional use:\n\nVivaldi browser, for Internet access, and the ability to view emails and attachments on the 10\" screen, edit documents, watch a tutorial on YouTube during a lunch break. The 10\" screen combined with the Vivaldi browser makes this an effective alternative to using a smartphone. Vivaldi's home page is set up with direct links to Gmail, Outlook, Pack Office and Renault e-guide for added convenience. The user can personalize its favourites for quick access just like on a tablet or computer.\n\nEasyPark for public car park payment solutions and experiencing simplicity and efficiency in parking solutions. With this app, users pay the accurate parking fee directly on the OpenR Link multimedia screen. Begin parking with a simple click on the screen and the process seamlessly concludes when the vehicle is detected moving.\n\nNot forgetting Waze, for regular members of the community.\n\nAnd that's not all: new apps are constantly being added to the catalogue.\n\nOpenR Link with Convertor Companion\n\nUsing the OpenR Link multimedia system with Google built-in capabilities also opens the door to creating custom apps for converted vehicles. Three apps are available at the launch: one for fire brigades, one for mobile workshop conversions and one for refrigerated vehicle conversions.\n\nWith these apps, developed by the conversion professionals themselves, the New Renault Master drivers can check and supervise their custom features directly on their OpenR Link multimedia system’s 10-inch screen. There are several advantages: the driver interface is better (it is clearer and controls are displayed more prominently on the colour screen), the system is simpler and safer, it only displays the information that the driver needs, and it can update automatically over the air. And you don’t need to attach a second screen to the dashboard.\n\nGoogle Maps, the standard for the pros\n\nAmong other amenities, Google Maps provides real-time traffic information and displays points of interest (favourite restaurants or suppliers, including their opening hours, telephone numbers, etc.), it can be voice-controlled, and its maps are constantly being updated. If you connect your Google account to your user profile, you can also retrieve your saved places.\n\nMy Renault: remote services to stay one step ahead\n\nTo take interaction and proaction to the next level, you can also connect remotely to the New Renault Master using the My Renault app, for a variety of reasons:\n\nTo locate your van on a map or, if it is in a large car park for example, make it flash its lights or make a sound.\n\nTo keep track of its maintenance schedule.\n\nTo receive a warning if the vehicle is unlocked (which is especially useful as vans carry valuable items).\n\nAdditional connected services from Mobilize\n\nMobilize provides other connected services for the New Renault Master:\n\nMobilize Connected Insurance, to modulate insurance premiums according to the distance you drive or your driving style, in order to optimise costs**.\n\nMobilize Fleet Connect**, a web-based platform and app to optimise fleet management in real time – with features including consumption monitoring, geolocation, geofencing and eco-driving challenges – to simplify operations, respond faster and save money.\n\nMobilize Fleet Data, which supplies raw data from vehicles (distance driven, maintenance alerts, geolocation, etc.) to feed into other management tools.\n\nThe New Renault Master’s native connectivity enables it to share this data.\n\nEV-exclusive connectivity\n\nThe New Renault Master in its electric versions comes with several exclusive functionalities – which, again, provide a user experience that looks and feels a lot like the one on a smartphone. This will make the transition to electric mobility simpler than ever.\n\nGoogle Maps considers your stated preferences and optimises itineraries accordingly. And you can use electric vehicle route planning to plan drives in an electric vehicle that include charging stops, filter charging stations according to your preferred payment method or power rating, set your home and workplace as charging points, and decide when the battery charges and the air conditioning switches on and off, to optimise costs and keep the temperature just right in the cockpit.\n\nThe My Renault app and its several remote services specifically for electric vehicles keep the New Renault Master – a high-tech vehicle that is always ready to help – connected to your digital ecosystem:\n\nIt displays remaining range, to track discharging in real time.\n\nIt displays charging stations near you or near a selected location.\n\nYou can schedule charging remotely (for example to only charge the van during off-peak hours).\n\nYou can set preheating times, so the cockpit is at the right temperature when you start your day (without affecting range if the van is plugged in) – which is especially convenient for professionals who start work very early in the morning.\n\nIt displays charge status and a charging date log.\n\nAs it includes Mobilize Charge Pass, you can pay for charges without having to carry a large number of cards, across Europe’s largest charging network (over 500,000 charging points in 25 countries, half of which charge at 22 kW). Passholders can also enjoy preferential rates at motorway-side Ionity stations (more than 2,600 charging points) if they take out an optional subscription.\n\nLastly, several additional Mobilize services are available to make your life easier in an electric New Renault Master van:\n\nMobilize Power Solutions, which simplifies the switch to electric mobility with made-to-measure charging solutions on company premises, on the road and even in employees’ homes. The services for professionals include assessments, charging terminal installation and operation, energy optimisation and maintenance. Users can pay for charges using their Mobilize Business Pass and the fleet manager can monitor consumption remotely and pay on a monthly basis.\n\nSmart Charge**, which optimises charging based on the time of day and source of electricity, to minimise costs and reduce carbon footprints when charging at home – with no action required from the driver. Besides lowering electricity bills, it can earn the user rewards for flexibility.\n\n*as an option\n\n** depending on the country\n\n*** Google Maps directions and navigation features may be limited depending on vehicle type.\n\nPART 4: NEXT-LEVEL LCV ESSENTIALS\n\nThe New Renault Master will launch with a full line-up covering all professional requirements. It will comprise 40 silhouettes ranging from 11 to 22 cubic metres, with a 40 mm wider opening at the sliding side door and 100 mm longer load areas – the longest in the category. Its greater payload capacity, length, width and volume make it the ideal van and redefine convenience in its class.\n\nThere are 20 conversion bases available from production plants, where workshops can handle a number of alterations directly (adding tippers, deepening cockpits, adding volume, etc.). This catalogue of factory-mounted kits also shortens turnaround times and simplifies transport logistics.\n\nThe shorter wheelbase and redesigned front axle provide unprecedented manoeuvrability, including an outstanding 1.5 metre shorter turning diameter. The New Renault Master takes handling in cities to new heights of convenience. Customers can even choose an L3 version for city driving (L2 is the base vehicle, L3 is available with front-wheel and rear-wheel drives, and L4 has a rear-wheel drive).\n\nAs with all the electric vehicles in the range, the New Master incorporates elements of Renault's human first program, designed to help emergency teams intervene on the vehicle in the event of an accident:\n\nA QR code for firefighters is integrated into the bodywork to guide them as quickly as possible in their response;\n\nthe fireman's access allows the high-voltage battery to be flooded with electrical versions to avoid any risk of fire starting;\n\nthe SD switch disconnects the battery so that work can be carried out on the vehicle in complete safety;\n\nThe battery is housed in a special, reinforced frame that protects it from all types of impact.\n\nThe New Renault Master, which will be available starting in spring 2024, is designed to go further, carry more and cost less. It is the perfect next-generation, multi-energy Aerovan."
