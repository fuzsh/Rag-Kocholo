        "text": "Last modification: 19 mai 20\n\nIntroduction:\n\nFrance is one of the leading countries in Europe, both politically and economically. It is one of the five permanent, veto-wielding members of the UN Security Council (the UK is the only other European one). It is also the founder and main member of La Francophonie, the worldwide community of French-speaking nations.\n\nBy purchasing power parity, France is the EU's second-largest economy (after Germany) and the ninth-largest in the world (having recently surpassed the UK). The world's largest insurance company and bank are both French (Axa and BNP Paribas, respectively).\n\nWith over 83 million foreign visitors a year, France is the world's first tourist destination. A considerable part of this visitor flow is centred on Paris.\n\nTypical for France is its strong tradition of state interventionism in the economy. The French state retains majority interests in the country's main railway, electricity, aircraft, nuclear power and telecoms companies.\n\nDue to its heavy investment in nuclear power, France is the smallest emitter of CO2 among the G7 nations. More than 70% of the electricity produced in France is generated by nuclear energy. That context makes it hard for renewable energies to take off.\n\nChapter 3: Company car market\n\nFleet Model preference top 5 (fleet market)\n\nALL MAKES\n\nIn H1 2019, French manufacturers provide all 10 of the most popular fleet models.\n\nIn a Top 10 previously entirely dominated by diesel models, three petrol models have crept in – testament to the growing diversification of fleet vehicle powertrains.\n\nRenault Clio Diesel: 13,193\n\nPeugeot 3008 Diesel: 11,657\n\nPeugeot 308 Diesel: 10,304\n\nRenault Clio Petrol: 9,909\n\nRenault Mégane Diesel: 8,506\n\nPeugeot 208 Petrol: 7,481\n\nCitroën C3 Petrol: 6,462\n\nPeugeot 20 Diesel: 6,049\n\nCitroën C3 Diesel: 5,089\n\nPeugeot 5008 Diesel: 5,029\n\nThe Peugeot 3008 Diesel has had to give up the first position it occupied at the end of 2018 to the Renault Clio Diesel. Over the same time period, the Peugeot 208 Petrol gained four places and the Peugeot 5008 dropped five places.\n\nSUVs\n\nIn six years time, the share of SUVs in corporate registrations has nearly tripled, from 13% in 2012 to 36.3% in 2018. At the end of H1 2019, the figure stood at 37.5%. Here are the figures for the first half of 2019:\n\nPeugeot 3008: 16,531\n\nRenault Captur: 8,460\n\nPeugeot 5008: 7,183\n\nRenault Kadjar: 5,565\n\nPeugeot 2008: 5,425\n\nVW Tiguan: 4,719\n\nCitroën C5 Aircross: 3,527\n\nDS 7: 3,005\n\nCitroën C3 Aircross: 2,947\n\nBMW X1: 2,427\n\nAs at the end of 2018, the Peugeot 3008 leads the SUV ranking in French fleets – with twice the number of registrations of the second model on the list.\n\nLCVs\n\nTop 10 registrations LCVs in corporate segment, H1 2019\n\nRenault Kangoo Diesel: 15,634\n\nRenault Master Diesel: 12,430\n\nPeugeot Partner Diesel: 10,963\n\nRenault Trafic Diesel: 10,915\n\nRenault Clio Diesel: 10,628\n\nPeugeot Expert Diesel: 9,717\n\nCitroën Berlingo Diesel: 9,667\n\nPeugeot Boxer Diesel: 7,169\n\nCitroën Jumpy Diesel: 6,636\n\nIveco Daily Diesel: 5,978\n\nSource: Arval Mobility Observatory\n\nChapter 4: Taxation & legislation\n\nGet the complete analysis about taxation and legislation in the Fleet Europe Taxation Guide, developed in collaboration with PWC. Click here for more info\n\nIn France, company cars are subject to\n\n1. Vehicle registration tax\n\n2. The malus, a tax on vehicles with high CO2 emissions\n\n3. Company car tax (TVS, for Taxe sur les véhicules de société)\n\n4. Value-added tax\n\n1. Vehicle registration tax\n\nThe tax amount is based on the cylinder capacity (horsepower) and the engine power (kWh) of the vehicle and varies according to place of registration. Non-polluting vehicles running entirely or partially on electricity, CNG, LPG or superethanol E85 can be entirely or partially exempted from this registration tax. An additional registration tax, according to gross vehicle weight, is due only for goods or people transport vehicles from a certain size and upwards. The tax is due each time the vehicle is registered.\n\n2. The malus, a tax on vehicles with high CO2 emissions\n\nTo discourage the use of dirty vehicles, a surcharge on the basis of CO2 emissions is added to many car models. The rules vary depending on whether the car was registered before 1 January 2008. New vehicles registered after that date have to pay the tax\n\na. If they’ve been granted EC Type Approval and their CO2 emissions rate is at least 155g/km in 2010, 150g/km in 2011, 141g/km in 2012, 135g/km in 2013 and 130g/km in 2014, 2015, 2016, 126g/km in 2017, 119 g/km in 2018 and 117 g/km in 2019.

Company car tax (TVS, for Taxe surles véhicules de société)\n\nThe TVS is an annual tax, payable per quarter. It varies depending on the car’s CO2 emissions rate.\n\nCO2 (g/km)\n\nTax/g\n\n≤ 20\n\n0\n\n> 20 ≤ 60\n\n1\n\n> 60 ≤100\n\n2\n\n> 100 ≤ 120\n\n4.5\n\n> 120 ≤ 140\n\n6.5\n\n> 140 ≤ 160\n\n13\n\n> 160 ≤ 200\n\n19.5\n\n> 200 ≤ 250\n\n23.5\n\n> 250\n\n29\n\nSince October 1, 2013, an additional tax is levied on company cars depending on both the type of fuel used (i.e. excluding vehicles running exclusively on electricity) and the year of first registration. The tax amount per vehicle is as follows:\n\nExemptions include taxis, cars running on superethanol E85, cars using both fossil fuels and LPG and emitting less than 100 g of CO2/km, and all cars emitting less than 60 g CO2/km.\n\nPrivate use of a company car (including for commuting) is an ‘avantage en nature’ (i.e. a benefit in kind) and is subject to personal income tax and social security contributions by the beneficiary.\n\nEmployers can estimate the value of the BIK based on the various actual costs (i.e. fuel, depreciation, etc), or by calculating a lump sum.\n\n4. Value-added tax\n\nBoth the purchase and leasing of cars are subject to the standard rate of VAT (20%). This VAT is not deductible when there is private or mixed (business/private) use – which means most cases. Some exceptions:\n\nVehicles intended to be resold as new;\n\nVehicles to be leased;\n\nVehicles with eight passenger seats and up, used by companies to transport their staff to work.\n\nVehicles acquired and used exclusively for transport (buses, taxis, hearses, etc.) or for driving tuition.\n\nTrucks, pickups, vans.\n\nFrom 1 January 2019, VAT on petrol is 40% deductible. That rate will continue to increase over the next years, in order to align the VAT treatment of petrol and diesel.\n\nIn order to register a foreign-bought used car in France, the reseller must prove the VAT regime under which the vehicle was acquired. The measure is to prevent resellers in France using the second-hand VAT regime (so-called ‘VAT margin Scheme’) for vehicles which are not eligible to this regime.\n\nSource: Fleet Europe Taxation Guide 2018, Droit-finances\n\nVehicle taxes represent more than 20% of a vehicle’s TCO. However, the fiscal cost of a specific vehicle type can vary greatly, depending among other things on its CO2 emissions. Two examples:\n\nA Toyota Yaris Hybrid 1.5 VVT-I Business 208, emitting 75 g of CO2 per km and thus not subject to the malus tax (on high-polluting vehicles) will be taxed a total of €716, or (written off over 48 months) €15 per month.\n\nFor a BMW X6 xDrive30d Lounge, emitting 183 g of CO2 per km, the malus is €7,890 at purchase. Adding in other taxes, that makes €44,854 in total taxes over 48 months, or €934 per month.\n\nSource: OVE\n\nChapter 5: Car policies\n\nCar policies in French companies focus mainly on TCO but include a number of other key issues, such as the satisfaction the cars provide to their employees, and the corporate image that the vehicles help to project.\n\nFrench brands dominate in French corporate fleets, which can be seen as a projection of ‘loyalty’ to the country’s native automotive industry.\n\nIt’s also a way of expressing modesty, as foreign cars are often considered more ostentatious.\n\nFor large companies, the choice for French brands may also be motivated by the substantial discounts they have obtained from the manufacturers, and by the extensive network of dealers offering after-sales services.\n\nExcellent after sales, of course, is also an argument that works for smaller companies.\n\nCar options are a good way to increase employee satisfaction, help safeguard RVs and limit rental levels. But there usually is a strict limit, with employees sometimes able to acquire more options at their own cost.\n\nDespite limits on CO2 emissions, the share of SUVs in corporate fleets is increasing, in response to employee expectations (for both family and professional use).\n\nAlthough the share of diesels is declining, the TCO argument for diesel remains strong in many cases.\n\nUnbundling long-term contracts is an increasingly popular way for fleet managers to pinpoint and replace services they deem too expensive. As a result, independent suppliers are offering a growing number of services (from tyre management over on-site repairs to washing services, fuel cards and more).\n\nSource: Source: Fleet Europe Special Benelux – France\n\nChapter 6: Funding methods\n\nOf the 2,534,607 new vehicles (<3.5 tons) registered in 2018 in France, 562,646 were under leasing contract. That’s 10,256 units more than in 2017, or +1.86%.\n\nLeasing represented 58.53% of all new-vehicle registrations for French companies and professionals in 2018, or 432,153 units out of a total of 738,346. That figure is 9.45% for national and local governments, 21.47% for rental car companies and 3.2% for private consumers.\n\nThe growth of leasing was a bit below that of the overall vehicle market (+2.89% to 2,534,607 new cars and LCVs), so its penetration rate declined from 22.42% in 2017 to 22.2%.\n\nIn all, leasing operators in France had 1,448,178 vehicles in their fleets (+6.74%) and managed a further 425,958 vehicles for others (+10.72%). That’s a total of 1,874,136 vehicles (+7.62%). The increase is the result of the ongoing expansion of leasing in the SME segment and, to a smaller extent, private customers.\n\nSource: SesamLLD/Fleet Europe\n\nChapter 7: Fuel\n\nIn 2017, the share of petrol and diesel in new-car registrations was still equal at 47% each. In 2018, petrol took a clear lead: 55% market share versus just 39% for diesel.\n\nElectric-vehicle sales increased strongly in relative terms, but only slightly in absolute terms: from 24,910 to 31,059 units, or from 1.18% of overall sales in 2017 to 1.43% in 2018.\n\nSource: best-selling-cars.com\n\nAs the figures for January 2019 show, diesel continues its fast retreat in France. In that month, overall new-car registrations in France dropped by 1.1% (compared to January 2018). That decline was entirely due to the significant retreat of diesel.\n\nDiesel (-17.8%) represented 34.2% of total sales in January (compared to 47.3% for the whole of 2017, 38.9% in 2018, 35.8% just for December 2018). The retreat of diesel was felt stronger by some brands: Peugeot (-23.1%), Renault (-25.1%), Ford (-35.7%), Opel (-53%), Nissan (-65%) and Fiat (-49%). Only VW (+40.8%) swam against the stream.\n\nRegistrations of new petrol cars were up (+8.9%) and represented 58% of all new-car registrations in January. This follows a surge of 18.3% against the whole of last year, when petrol cars represented 54.7% of all new registrations. Benefiting from the petrol surge were Opel (+42%), Toyota (+22%), Kia (+21%), Suzuki (+26,6%) and Mini (+19,5%).\n\nRegistrations of pure EVs were up +138%, to 2% of total sales in January. This is up from just 1.4% market share for the whole of 2018 – ending on a strong 2.7% for December. With almost 1,500 units, The Renault Zoé represented 49% of the total volume in 2018. About 40% is divided between the Nissan Leaf, Smart Fortwo, BMW i3, Kia Niro and Hyundai Kona.\n\nTraditional hybrids represented 4.2% in 2018, 5% in January 2019 (+5.3% over the same month last year). Toyota dominates, representing about 70% of the market.\n\nPHEVs represent just 0.7% of the overall market in January. Just five models make up 78% of total PHEV sales in January (high to low): Volvo XC60, Outlander, Volvo XC90, Range Rover Sport et Mini Countryman.\n\nSource: Autoactu\n\nOnce, French corporate fleets were diesel by default. That’s changing fast. The powertrain equation in the French leasing market (cars and LCVs) looked like this at the end of 2018:\n\nDiesel: 410,207 units (-8.6% vs. 2017)\n\nPetrol: 126,757 units (+47.7%)\n\nHybrid: 16,962 units (+56.9%)\n\nElectric: 8,469 units (+25.5%)\n\nOver the whole year, diesel had a market share of 72.91%, petrol 22.53%, hybrids 3.01% and EVs 1.51%. But those figures don’t adequately reflect the huge shift that took place last year. Only in January, diesel still had a share of 78.77%. By December, that had fallen to 67.81%. Inversely, petrol increased its share from 16.58% at the start of the year to 26.59% at the end of it.\n\nDiesel does remain the most profitable and most chosen motorisation for certain circumstances, notably for the 42-month, 98,000-km contract type. But on the other hand, the full-electric version of the Hyundai Kona already accounts for more than 40% of its fleet registrations.\n\nSource: Fleet Europe, Dataforce/Fleet Europe\n\nLooking at motorisations, there was a 33.4% increase in registrations of company cars with a petrol engine – despite the overall drop of 9.6% for the True Fleet market. As a result, the petrol share of True Fleet registrations shot up to 29.4% in December 2018 vs. December 2017. That’s a new record for petrol in a market that until recently was almost entirely dedicated to diesel.\n\nStrong increases were also noted for EVs (+34.4%) and Hybrids (+22.8%), while PHEVs dropped significantly (-15.1%). However, some PHEV versions of large SUVs did score very well, notably the Land Rover Range Rover Sport and the Volvo XC90.\n\nThis will certainly have been influenced by the high malus that the French vehicle taxation allocates to the typical CO2 range of a large SUV, so opting for a PHEV version appears the logical choice.\n\nSource: Dataforce/Fleet Europe\n\nIn the first half of 2019, the diversification of powertrains in French corporate fleets continued to speed up, away from the diesel dominance of yesteryear.\n\nPetrol registrations increased strongly: +65.44% to 100,747 units, for a total share of 22.31%. That's 6.2 percentage points more than at the end of Q4 2018 and 7.7 percentage points more than at the end of Q2 2018. Considering just cars (not LCVs), the market share for petrol at the end of H1 2019 was 34.52% (91,639 units).\n\nDiesel registrations continued to decline, -3.67% to 324,459 units, for a share of 71.84%. That's 6.68 percentage points less than at the end of Q4 2018 and 8.7 percentage points less than at the end of Q2 2018. For cars, the decline was -11.56% to 152,497 units, for a share of just 57.45%.\n\nHybrid registrations increased by +21.53% to 15,230 units, for a total share of 3.37% - just 0.14 of a percentage point more than at the end of 2018 and 0.37 of a percentage point more than a year earlier. Non-rechargeable hybrids grew more than twice as fast as plug-in ones (+25.6% vs. 10.93%).\n\nEV registrations increased by +46.50% to 10,586 units, for a total share of 2.34%, no more than a quarter of a percentage point higher than at the end of last year, and 0.64 of a percentage point more than a year earlier. Just for cars, the market share was 2.53% (6,716 units, an increase of 63,49%).\n\nSource: Arval Mobility Observatory\n\nIn July 2019, the French government announced it was expanding Advenir, a programme launched in 2016 to subsidise charging points for electric vehicles (EVs). To date, the programme has co-financed more than 7,300 new charging points. From now on, private EV charging points will also be subsidised.\n\nSpecifically, Advenir now also subsidises up to 50% of the cost of installing charging points at condominiums. The programme targets the creation of charging facilities at 3,000 condos by 2022.\n\nAdditionally, subsidies will increase for municipalities installing charging infrastructure at the request of EV drivers, within a 500-m radius of their work or home. To date, Advenir financed up to 40%, with a maximum of €1,860 per charging point. That limit will now be increased by €300 to €2,160.\n\nThe French government is freeing up €16 million for both measures.\n\nCurrently, there are 230,000 BEVs and PHEVs on the road in France, and a total of 28,000 charging points. In May 2018, French car manufacturers and the French government set as target for 2022 to have 600,000 BEVs and 400,000 PHEVs on the road, and have 100,000 charging stations available.\n\nA recent survey shows half of all Frenchmen living in an apartment could see themselves driving an EV – provided they can charge it at home.\n\nSource: Fleet Europe\n\nChapter 8 : TCO components\n\nDepreciation: 41.1%\n\nTaxes: 22.0%\n\nMaintenance, Insurance, Tires: 20.7%\n\nFuel: 12.6%\n\nFinancing: 3.6%\n\nThe Corporate Vehicle Observatory takes into account not just the TCO of the vehicle, but also the TCO of the driver, the TCO of the fleet, and the TCM (Total Cost of Mobility).\n\nDriver behaviour obviously impacts the risk of accident and thus the cost of insurance, but also the amount of fuel spent and the cost of maintenance and repair. ‘Driver TCO’ can add up to 50% of cost to overall TCO.\n\nAccording to a survey by SNLVLD (French Association of Vehicle Lessors) in 2015, the ‘fleet TCO’ averaged out at 58 hours of admin per fleet vehicle.\n\nSource: OVE\n\nChapter 9: Safety, insurance and telematics\n\nCars driving in France need to be equipped with the requirements necessary for the safety of its occupants and that of other road users. These are:\n\nhigh-visibility vest\n\nsafety triangle\n\nbreathalyser\n\nThe vehicle must also have working lights and front windows of at least 70% clarity.\n\nSource: Service public\n\nNearly half of all companies with fleets of at least 50 vehicles have not yet worked out a road safety policy (that figure rises to 65% for fleets of 10-49 vehicles and to 78% for fleets smaller than that).\n\nNo more than 14% of French corporate fleets are using telematics solutions (other than those just using driver smartphones for data collection). That figure increases to 27% with larger companies.\n\nSource: Observatoire du Véhicule d'Entreprises, July 2018.\n\nChapter 10: Environment\n\nDue to the rising popularity of petrol, the average CO2 emissions of France’s overall leasing fleet have risen by two points from 2017 to 2018, to 109.35 g/km. Meanwhile, the average emissions of France’s overall fleet have only risen by a single point, to 114.39 g/km.\n\nSource: Fleet Europe\n\nFrom January 16, 2017, Paris has become the first municipality in the country to put in place a Restricted Traffic Zone. A system of discs (known as Crit’Air) categorises passenger cars according to the type of powertrain, segment and date of first registration. Passenger cars registered before January 1, 1997 have been banned from Paris since last July.\n\nSource: Fleet Europe Taxation Guide 2018\n\nChapter 11: Mobility\n\nSince 1 January 2018, all French companies with at least 100 employees are obliged to produce a PDE (plan de déplacement d'entreprise, or 'corporate mobility plan') offering alternatives to traditional, one-person-one-car business mobility.\n\nSource: Fleet Europe\n\nAt the start of May, the French minister for Transport announced that electric 'trottinettes' (kick scooters) would become subject to France's Traffic Law from September 2019. The law will also apply to other vehicles classed as NVEI ('nouveaux véhicules électriques individuels', or 'new individual EVs', such as segways, hoverboards, unicycles, etc.)\n\nUntil now, these vehicles had escaped any form of regulation, but their dramatic increase in French cities has necessitated the imposition of a system of rules and fines (from €35 to €1500).\n\nA draft decree on NVEIs, designed to make the sidewalks safe again for pedestrians, is based on the rules for bicycles, but recognises NVEIs as a new and separate vehicle category. Some of the proposed rules:\n\nMinimum age for using NVEIs is eight years.\n\nUsers under 12 must wear a helmet.\n\nAll users must wear reflective clothing or equipment.\n\nOne person per vehicle; no passengers!\n\nNo headphones while driving.\n\nNo driving on sidewalks (they may be led by hand on sidewalks if the engine is turned off, though)\n\nParking on sidewalks only if it doesn't impede pedestrian traffic\n\nUse is limited to bicycle lanes; plus (in cities) roads with a speed limit of 50 km/h or less; and (outside built-up areas) open lanes.\n\nMaximum speed: 25 km/h.\n\nThe new law, currently debated in the French Parliament, will allow cities to apply for exemptions to these general rules.\n\nSource: L'Automobile et l'Entreprise\n\nChapter 12: Key trends to watch\n\nThe transition from NEDC to WLTP for car model emissions values, a change with major fiscal consequences, is scheduled for September 2019. The first cars will come onto the market in the new, as yet unknown fiscal regime from January 2020. Specialists predict WLTP will impact mainly medium to high-range vehicle segments (as the smaller ones have already transitioned to below 100 g/km).\n\nEven if TVS (company car tax) and the malus (a purchase tax on CO2 emissions) themselves won’t change, the introduction of WLTP will lead to an increase in TVS of between €91 and €1,500 and of €75 to €2,500 for the malus, says leasing association SesamLLD, basing itself on the Finnish example.\n\nSource: Fleet Europe"
