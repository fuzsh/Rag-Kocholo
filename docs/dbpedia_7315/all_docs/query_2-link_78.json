        "text": "SARAH CHEA\n\nchea.sarah@joongang.co.kr\n\nRenault Korea aims to stoke a revival in the Korean market, unveiling a new company name and emblem.\n\nThe automaker, which was previously known as Renault Korea Motors, said it is now dropping \"Motors\" from the company name.\n\nIt also ditched the \"storm’s eyes” logo and pivoted to the widely known diamond-shaped emblem, dubbed the Losange.\n\n\"The change in name and emblem implies our intention to add up French DNA and make Renault Korea a global auto brand,\" said Renault Korea CEO Stephane Deblaise.\n\n\"We will introduce one new vehicle in Korea each year.\"\n\nThe name change comes four years after the company changed its name from Renault Samsung Motors to Renault Korea Motors after its contract with Samsung ended.\n\nCars available in Korea will have new names. Renault's XM3 will now sport the Losange emblem and be marketed as the Arkana — its name in international markets.\n\nThe QM6 will also boast the new emblem but will not undergo a name change due to the model's familiarity with Korean customers. The QM6 is Renault Korea's best-selling model on the domestic market.\n\nThe SM6 will maintain both its name and emblem.\n\nRenault Korea is set to introduce the Aurora 1, a hybrid midsize SUV, to Korea in the second half of the year. The Aurora project is a Renault Korea-led initiative to develop three new vehicles — two hybrids and a pure EV.\n\nRenault will also introduce the Scenic, a pure-electric SUV, to Korea next year, but Deblaise stated that the EV \"won't be produced in its plant in Busan.\"\n\nRenault Korea is currently suffering from shrinking sales in the domestic market, with public criticism rising due to the company's lack of new models. The company sells three models in Korea — the SM6, QM6 and XM6 — but the first two models have not been fully revamped since their first introduction in 2016.\n\nRenault sold a total of 22,460 vehicles in Korea last year, down 57 percent on year. Sales figures remain around one-seventh in comparison to their peak in 2010.\n\nRenault Korea recently announced 118 billion won ($88 million) in investment to replace old machinery in its Busan plant with EV equipment over the next three years.\n\nThe investment could increase to 1 billion euros ($1.1 billion), Deblaise said.\n\nThe Polestar 4 EV will be manufactured at the Busan plant from 2025.\n\nThe plant, built in 1997, produces midsize SUVs including the XM3, QM6 and SM6. Its annual capacity stands at 300,000 units, and it employs around 2,000 workers.\n\nBY SARAH CHEA [chea.sarah@joongang.co.kr]"
