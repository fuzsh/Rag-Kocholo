As we have done in the past, we collect such information on our Web sites for the sole purpose of improving our services and the content of our Web site for marketing purposes and to improve our communication with you. At certain points during your visit to our web sites we may ask you to enter your personal details such as your name, home address or e-mail address. You will also be asked whether you consent to use of that data and for what purposes.\n\nThe personal data you have entered above will be deleted in 30 days’ time, unless you give your consent.\n\nAuto Sales Ltd. would like to use your personal details and your vehicle data for market research purposes and to inform and/or to advise you about products and services provided by RENMER Group Ltd.\n\nYou can revoke your consent at any time by contacting [email protected] or by phone on 21433601.\n\nWe regret that if you choose not to give your consent, for legal reasons, we will be unable to keep you informed of our products and services.\n\nWe will not use your data except to fulfil a request you make when disclosing those details, or if you consent. We will collect information about your tastes and preferences both when you tell us what these are and by analysis of customer traffic, including by using cookies and IP addresses.\n\nMoreover The Company’s internet policy prohibits the sending of junk mail, that is, in any form of unsolicited advertising. All personal information is subject to strict confidentiality. We make exceptions only if we need to do so in order to provide you with a service you have requested and if we are required to disclose such information to third parties under certain laws or obligations.\n\nWhen you access this site, information is exchanged between your computer and our external server. The following non-personal information is collected at the time: your internet service provider’s domain name (not your e-mail address), the type of browser and the operating system you are using to access our site, the date and time of access and the pages you visit. This helps us understand which areas of the sites are of particular interest and also which pages are being requested. It also tells us how many hits and page requests we get.\n\nWe use cookies to confirm your visit to our site. Cookies are very small files that are stored in your PC when you are using The Company internet portals. Their sole purpose is to distinguish your PC from the PCs of other users that are accessing these sites at the same time. The use of cookies is unavoidable for the personalization of the service on our sites. Cookies are not dangerous for your computer. This technology is not used by The Company to gather your data for market research and advertising purposes.\n\nYou can set your browser in such a way that it can either receive our cookies or use our internet portals without the cookie functionality. In this case, however, the information that you provide cannot be stored for further enquiries, with the result that you will be required to submit the information again. Your browser may also be set in such a way that it always displays a warning message when it receives a cookie. Since the identification cookie has to be sent every time an individual page in the portals is called up, this message is most irritating. You should therefore deactivate these warning messages in your browser. No data transmission over the internet can be guaranteed to be completely confidential.\n\nEven though we at The Company have implemented some of the most effective means to ensure that your personal information is protected, we cannot guarantee that this information will be lost, used unlawfully or modified in a fraudulent manner. We bear no liability for the use that may be made of this information by you or any third party.\n\nThe Company reserves the right to change this Statement as it deems fit and without prior notice.
