        "text": "Hélène Boucher, a prodigious aviator, signs a contract with the young Caudron-Renault company in June 1934.\n\nShe went on to achieve many feats: a 621 mile world record for light aircraft; an all-category 62 mph international speed record; a 621 mile record with an average speed of 254 mph.\n\nOn 8 July 1934, she finishes second in the Angers 12-hour race after flying her Caudron-Rafale alone for twelve hours straight. One month later, at the controls of a 140 hp Caudron-Renault monoplane, she sets the female world record with a speed of 277 mph!\n\nHired by Caudron-Renault, she was the first ever female pilot to become qualified in poor visibility flying. She soon went on to break a number of records at the controls of her Rafale, including the women's and overall 621 mile speed records, the 62 mile duo record and then the solo record.\n\nLike F1® today, sports aviation in the 1930s was a laboratory for cutting-edge research and development. High standards, innovation and going the extra mile are values that have stood the test of time; they are reflected today in our offices, our factories and our products. Renault Rafale is a striking example of this."
