        "text": "The Concorde\n\nThe Concorde was one of only two supersonic transport airplanes to have entered commercial service: the other being the Tupolev Tu-144. The product of a joint development and manufacturing effort by British Aircraft Corporation (BAC) of the United Kingdom, and Aerospatiale of France throughout the 1960's and 1970's, the first aircraft entered service in 1976. The aircraft was designed to fly at cruise speeds of twice the speed of sound, or a Mach no. of approximately 2.0, and cruise at altitudes of up to 60,000 feet, substantially higher than conventional subsonic aircraft cruising in the 30,000 to 40,000 foot range. Technical and economic challenges to the Concorde resulted in only 20 aircraft being produced, and it was retired from service in 2003. At the time of the Air France accident in 2000, the Concorde had not experienced a single accident involving a fatality during its nearly 25 years of service.\n\nHistory of Flight\n\nOn July 25, 2000, Concorde registered F-BTSC, operated by Air France as a charter flight, AFR 4590, was scheduled to fly from Paris Charles de Gaulle to New York. There were 100 passengers, six cabin crew members, and three flight crew members on board. The captain in the left seat was the pilot flying (PF) and the First Officer was the Pilot Not Flying (PNF). The accident aircraft had been out of service between July 17 and 21 for scheduled A01 checks involving removal of certain main landing gear components, and tire inflation detection system checks. Following this maintenance, four flights were conducted between July 21 and July 24. On July 25, F-BTSC was planned to be a \"reserve\" aircraft for a regularly scheduled Air France flight 002, but due to the unavailability of other Concorde aircraft, this aircraft was selected for the charter flight to New York.\n\nAvailable records indicated that the aircraft's total weight was 186.9 tons, with 95 of fuel. Based upon these weights and airport conditions, the aircraft takeoff speeds selected were V1 of 150 kts, VR of 198 kts, and V2 of 220 kts. Since this was near maximum weight for the Concorde, the crew requested, and was granted permission to use the entire length of runway 26. Winds were generally light at 8 kts, runway conditions dry, and visibility generally clear at 15 km.\n\nThe takeoff began at 14h 42min 31s and progressed normally for most of the takeoff roll. A few seconds after passing through V1, investigators determined that at that point the No. 2 main landing gear tire passed over a piece of metal debris that had fallen from a DC-10 aircraft that had taken off from runway 26 five minutes earlier. The metal debris destroyed No. 2 tire, resulting in segments of the tire striking the underside of the Concorde's left wing. It was concluded by the investigation that the large segment of tire debris found on the runway after the accident did not penetrate the tank, but rather deformed an area of the No. 5 fuel tank, producing a mechanical process within the fuel tank referred to as a \"hydrodynamic pressure surge.\" It was concluded that this pressure surge caused an area of the No. 5 fuel tank lower surface to fail outwards. This tank segment, approximately 32 cm square, completely separated from the wing surface, and was found by investigators lying on runway 26 along with pieces of the failed tire. One of these tire pieces weighed nearly 5 kgs.\n\nThe failed area of the lower wing skin of the no. five main fuel tank immediately began leaking massive amounts of fuel. The involved area was slightly inboard, and slightly forward of the No. 1 and 2 engine inlets. Leaking fuel almost immediately ignited. It was believed by investigators that electrical arcing from wires within the left main landing gear wheel well was most likely the source of the ignition of the leaking fuel.\n\nThe takeoff was continued, and engines 1 and 2 immediately began to malfunction, with No. 2 being more severe. The takeoff track began to drift to the left, and the pilot rotated as the plane passed over the left-hand edge of the runway, at a speed of approximately 200 kts. The fire warning system for the No. 2 engine sounded a few seconds after liftoff, followed by it being shut down by the crew. Although the crew then attempted to raise the gear, it was believed by investigators that damage to the landing gear system prevented the gear from moving to the stowed position. The plane remained at an airspeed of approximately 200 kts, an altitude of 200 feet, and was unable to accelerate or climb. Approximately 90 seconds from the beginning of the takeoff, the No. 1 engine then failed, resulting in the plane crashing into a hotel, killing all 109 passengers and crew on board, 4 persons on the ground, and injuring six.\n\nSee an animation of flight 4590 flight path and events leading up to the accident:\n\nHistory of Previous Concorde Tire and Wheel Failures\n\nBased upon evidence gathered from the accident site, as well as debris and other evidence from runway 26 following the flight, investigators determined that the sequence of events leading to the accident involved four main conclusions. These four were: (1) a piece of metal debris from an earlier departing DC-10 had been struck by, and failed, the No. 2 tire of Air France flight 4590; (2) as a result of the No. 2 tire disintegration, tire fragments impacted the lower wing surface; (3) due to being struck by high energy tire fragments, the No. 5 fuel tank experienced a major rupture, leading to a massive fuel leak, ignition and fire; and (4) as a result of a massive in-flight fire, subsequent damage to remaining structure and systems resulted in loss of control of the airplane and the accident.\n\nAlthough investigators learned that there had been previous tire failures experienced on the Concorde fleet, what was believed to be unusual in this case was the magnitude of the tank damage, and the level of the fuel leak involved. Research was conducted in order to gather information concerning the previous failures, and to better understand the factors leading to these failures. Based upon analysis of available service information, it was learned that there had been 57 previous tire burst/deflation events since the introduction of the Concorde in 1976.\n\nOf these events, investigators determined that:\n\n12 of these events had structural consequences on the wings and/or the tanks, of which six led to penetration of the tanks.\n\n19 of the tire bursts/deflations were caused by foreign objects.\n\n22 events occurred during takeoff.\n\nOnly one case of tank penetration by a piece of tire was noted.\n\nNone of the events identified showed any rupture of a tank, a fire, or significant simultaneous loss of power on two engines.\n\nAs a result of tire and wheel failures that had been experienced in the late 1970's and early 1980's, several safety initiatives were undertaken in order to improve the reliability of tires and wheels, and to reduce the risks to the airplane when the tire failures occurred. In particular, a concern existed relative to the risks associated with a cascading, double tire failure, leading to wheel failures and risks to fuel tank integrity following disintegration of wheels. These fleet-wide improvements were introduced in the early 1980's by airworthiness directive actions and had been incorporated into the Air France Concorde fleet, including F-BTSC.\n\nBased upon review of previous service experience, investigators concluded that the earlier safety initiatives intended to improve the reliability of the Concorde's tires and wheels had been successful. It was also learned that no failure had occurred similar to what had been experienced on flight 4590.\n\nMaintenance Performed on the Left Main Landing Gear\n\nBetween July 17 and 21, 2000, investigators learned that Air France had performed a scheduled A01 check in accordance with their approved maintenance program. During this check, the left main landing gear bogie beam was removed and replaced in order to correct an acceptable deferred defect related to the under-inflation detection system.\n\nDuring the course of examination of wreckage and review of maintenance records, it was discovered by investigators that a part of the bogie assembly had been inadvertently omitted during reassembly of the left main landing gear system. The missing part, a spacer, was not re-installed onto the internal assembly of the bogie beam axis. This spacer is needed in order to properly position inner and outer shear rings that are located at each end of the spacer and serve to properly align the landing gear lateral tracking of the wheels.\n\nThe effects of the missing spacer resulted in review of the potential impact on aircraft performance and takeoff ground trajectories. A detailed analysis was conducted which evaluated the various factors that could have resulted from this omission, and potential for shifting of the shear rings inside the bogie assembly. It had also been learned that there had been four revenue flights conducted following the landing gear removal and reinstallation. These flights were also reviewed for any signs of any takeoff trajectory or controllability problems. None were found.\n\nFollowing this detailed review of possible effects of the missing landing gear bogie beam spacer, it was generally concluded by investigators that this missing part had no role in the accident. It was also concluded that the moderate trajectory drift to the left, beginning immediately following the #2 tire failure, was primarily a result of loss of thrust on the left side of the airplane, and effects of disturbed airflow in the area of the left wing from the fire.\n\nDC-10 Thrust Reverser Wear Strip Found on Runway\n\nImmediately following the accident, investigators recovered several items from runway 26. Included in these items were large pieces of tire debris, and a twisted piece of sheet metal that did not appear to belong to the Concorde. After extensive review and analysis of the sheet metal, it was determined that the piece of debris was a thrust reverser wear strip from a GE CF6 turbofan engine. It was also learned that a Continental Airlines DC-10, flight COA 55, had taken off from runway 26 five minutes prior to flight 4590, and that this airplane was powered by GE engines.\n\nThe DC-10 was located at a facility in the U.S. and examined by investigators. The #3 engine, a General Electric CF6-50, was observed to be missing a wear strip in the thrust reverser cowl area. This wear strip forms an air seal inside the thrust reverser cowl duct and is intended to provide a wearing surface during reverser deploy/stow operations. The rivet holes and other features observed on the aircraft matched the wear marks and other characteristics of the piece recovered from the runway. It was concluded by investigators that the piece recovered from runway 26 on July 25 came from the DC-10 being examined in the U.S. It was also concluded that Concorde's #2 tire of flight 4590 had struck this piece of sheet metal during takeoff and resulted in destruction of the tire.\n\nMaintenance Performed on the DC-10\n\nMaintenance records for the DC-10 identified replacement of the left thrust reverser wear strips on engine #3 during a C check in June 2000, and an additional replacement of the left wear strips at another maintenance facility some time prior to July 25. This second maintenance activity on the DC-10 #3 engine was specifically to replace the thrust reverser wear strip, which was reported at the time as being twisted and sticking out of the cowl.\n\nMaintenance instructions provided by the manufacturer were reviewed for repair or replacement of the wear strips. Detailed examination of the thrust reverser cowl area adjacent to the wear strip revealed 37 drill holes in the base support area of the reverser cowl. Examination of the recovered wear strip revealed 12 holes in the sheet metal part. It was concluded by investigators that a substantial amount of maintenance had been performed in this area prior to July 25. It was also learned that a repair to this area of the DC-10 would have been classified as a \"minor repair\" which would have permitted some degree of flexibility of steps permitted during the maintenance process. However, it was determined by investigators that the material used in the repair was a titanium/aluminum alloy sheet metal. Wear strip material called out in the instructions provided by the manufacturer indicated the strip be made from stainless steel sheet metal.\n\nFailure of the #5 Fuel Tank\n\nExamination of debris from the #5 fuel tank bottom recovered from runway 26 led investigators to conclude that a structural failure mechanism occurred on flight 4590 that had never been experience on civil aircraft. In addition, extensive fire damage to the remainder of the wreckage of the left wing found at the crash site made it impossible to establish the exact location and number of tank openings. However, extensive studies and tank impact testing led to the conclusion that the general scenario of the tank rupture was most likely a result of at least two physical processes occurring simultaneously.\n\nThe first process, identified by investigators as the \"Continuity Effect,\" is the behavior of a structural panel that experiences deformation inward from an external force, or in the case of the Concorde accident, the impact forces from the #2 tire failure. The deformation inward is accompanied by an outward rotation in the opposite direction in the panel area immediately adjacent to the inward deflection. The area where these two areas of panel are being deformed, but in opposite directions, is an area of localized highly strained material, and constitutes a \"weakened\" area of the tank bottom.\n\nA second physical process believed by investigators to have contributed to the unusual outward failure mechanism observed on the #5 fuel tank structure is referred to as the \"Hydrodynamic Pressure Surge.\" This involves a structural container with a fixed volume, filled with an incompressible fluid such as jet fuel. The container has little or no expansion space available to accommodate a change in volume, or fluid movement. If a surface of the container is suddenly subjected to a deformation that attempts to change the overall container volume, a sudden pressure rise is experienced throughout the container, and weakened areas of the tank structure, such as those formed by the \"continuity effect\" process, are potential areas of tank failure.\n\nInvestigators believed that the completely full #5 fuel tank, combined with a sudden deformation of the tank bottom from the tire debris impact, most likely led to weakened area(s) of the tank bottom to fail outward, resulting in the massive fuel leak. It was also recognized by the investigation that the Concorde delta wing structural design, which consisted of relatively thin (less than 2mm minimum thickness) aluminum skin panels, rather than thicker flat aluminum sheets, as is common in conventional large transport wing designs, may have increased vulnerability in the areas weakened by the continuity effect. Although extensive testing was never able to exactly duplicate the precise failure mechanism, the data that was able to be gathered from these tests confirmed the results of theoretical studies.\n\nA tank failure animation, including a simplified high-speed video of the two physical properties described above, is available below:\n\nAdditional Post-Accident Testing\n\nIn addition to fuel tank testing discussed above, additional post-accident testing was conducted in order for investigators to better understand the source of ignition for the leaking fuel, fuel leak propagation paths following the tank failures, and tire failure characteristics. These tests helped determine the likely progression of events during the period that the #2 tire contacted the thrust reverser wear strip, dynamics of the tire failure, and how leaking fuel became ignited underneath the airplane.\n\nBased upon the results of these tests, it was concluded by investigators that the most likely source of ignition of the leaking fuel was due to electrical arcing from damaged wires in the wheel well area, not hot engine parts as was originally suspected. It was also established that, when the Concorde tire was subjected to conditions representative of the actual takeoff weights and speeds, striking a similar piece of sheet metal to the one recovered from runway 26 resulted in tire failures nearly identical to the tire fragments that were collected from the airport.\n\nConclusions\n\nFailure of the Concorde's #2 tire on takeoff was due to striking a small piece of sheet metal that had fallen from a DC-10 that had taken off five minutes earlier. Following contact with sharp sheet metal, as determined by investigators to have occurred in this accident, this tire failure would not be considered to be unusual as there is no industry-wide regulatory requirement for aviation tires to be failure resistant to such threats. However, what was unusual was the extent of damage to the #5 fuel tank that this tire failure resulted in, and that this failure was of a type never experienced before in the history of civil aviation. After extensive analysis and testing, it was believed that this massive tank breach and fuel leak was the result of two complex physical processes occurring nearly simultaneously. These two conditions were (1) the \"Continuity Effect,\" and (2) the \"Hydrodynamic Pressure Surge.\" It was also concluded that this process was very much dependent upon the tank being completely full of an incompressible fluid (i.e., jet fuel), and sudden deformation occurring to the underside of the tank surface from tire debris impact.\n\nAccident Memorial\n\nTwo independent memorials were created in memory of the victims of this accident.\n\nThe first was inaugurated on the sixth anniversary of the accident, on July 25th, 2006. It is located just outside the south perimeter road of the Paris Charles de Gaulle airport, exactly abeam of the position where the Concorde ran over the metal strip on runway 26R.\n\nThe memorial consists of 113 low bushes, one for each victim, arranged in the shape of a Concorde with the longitudinal axis aligned with runway 26R. A pathway, with metal plaques at each side inscribed with the names of the victims, leads to a rock and metal monument located in the center.\n\nA second monument was built next to the field where the Concorde crashed, in Gonesse. This monument was funded by the local community through a public subscription. The opening ceremony was held on November 18th, 2006.\n\nThe main element of the monument is a rectangular 7-meter-high glass panel, pierced by an oblique steel plank. An inscription in French reads: \"On July 25th, 2000, the Concorde crashed in Gonesse, taking the lives of 113 souls on board and on the ground. In sorrow and remembrance, the town of Gonesse and its inhabitants honor the memory of the victims of this catastrophe.\""
