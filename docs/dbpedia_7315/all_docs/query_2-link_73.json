        "text": "The reduction of the French stake in Nissan was the focus of a meeting in Japan between the CEOs of Renault and Nissan, Luca de Meo and Makoto Uchida, on January 26\n\n© Agenzia Nova - Reproduction reserved\n\nRenault Sa. and Nissan Motor Co. have reached an agreement to significantly reduce France's stake in Nissan from the current 43 percent to 15 percent. This was reported by the newspaper \"Nikkei\", recalling that the two car manufacturers had been discussing for years a restructuring of their decades-old capital alliance, heavily biased in favor of the French company. According to the newspaper, the two companies could formalize the agreement through a note during the day today. The reduction of the French stake in Nissan was the focus of a meeting in Japan between the CEOs of Renault and Nissan, Luca de Meo and Makoto Uchida, on January 26.\n\nThe agreement should lead to a situation of equity participation, with both builders owning a 15 percent stake in the partner company. Nissan is also evaluating the purchase of a stake in Ampere, Renaut's electric car business which in the future should receive an investment from the US microchip giant Qualcomm Technologies, and a collaboration agreement with Google LLC. The alliance between Renault and Nissan was also the subject of talks held in Paris by French President Emmanuel Macron and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida in early January. On that occasion Macron had declared that the French government, the main shareholder of Renault, supports the revision of the corporate partnership.\n\nRead also other news on Nova News\n\nFollow us on the social channels of Nova News on Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Instagram, Telegram\n\n© Agenzia Nova - Reproduction reserved\n\nLatest news\n\nSudan, the government accuses the RSF of killing 85 civilians in the south-east: \"A brutal massacre\"\n\nAmong the victims there would be \"students of Koranic schools\"\n\nVenezuela: thousands of people on the streets of Caracas for the demonstration called by Machado - video\n\nIn a message to the protesters, Machado defined today as \"a historic day\", in which \"Venezuela takes to the streets to unite in a strong embrace, full of conviction, trust and deep love\"\n\nOstia: minor molested while bathing, 34-year-old arrested\n\nThe victim turned to the lifeguard who, together with the establishment staff, blocked the man\n\nBrazil: X closes its office in the country with immediate effect due to \"threats of arrest\"\n\nDespite the closure of the office, X says, the social platform will still remain available to Brazilian users\n\nSchillaci: “We will evaluate further measures to prevent violence in hospitals”\n\nWhat happened in Castellammare di Stabia, \"where a man entered the hospital with a baseball bat, is not admissible\"\n\nOther news\n\nRussia, Kadyrov equips a Tesla with a machine gun: “For our fighters” – video\n\nThe Chechen leader praised both the vehicle and Tesla CEO Elon Musk\n\nMonkeypox, Bertolaso: “The Lombard surveillance system is active and effective”\n\nMpox is transmitted to people through close contact with infected animals or people or by touching materials contaminated by the virus\n\nRussia: The Federal Security Service has opened a case against the two Rai journalists who entered Kursk\n\nSimone Traini and Stefania Battistini are accused of illegally crossing the border of the Russian Federation and filming a video in Sudzha\n\nCeasefire in Gaza: Italy, UK, France and Germany sign declaration in support of talks\n\n“We underline the importance of avoiding any escalation in the region that could undermine the prospects for peace.
