The Auto Radar system works to create more than a “sliced image” of the weather ahead. The imagery is clearer than ever with a 16-color palette and improved automatic ground-clutter suppression.\n\nOptimized Performance\n\nWith the G2+ Vision Jet, the Williams FJ33-5A engine has been finely tuned with a newly optimized thrust profile that provides up to 20% increased performance during take-off – providing added reassurance in hot temperatures and high elevations and access to additional airports at popular destinations across the globe.\n\nCirrus IQ™\n\nBe prepared for your flight before you get to the airport with the ability to see your fuel and oxygen quantity remotely from the Cirrus IQ App. Additionally, you can enjoy a simplified remote data-gathering process for troubleshooting and easy viewing of related Technical Publications and Maintenance Intervals for your Vision Jet.\n\nCirrus IQ"
