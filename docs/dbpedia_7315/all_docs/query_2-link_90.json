The French automaker owns about 43% of Nissan.\n\nThe reduction would result in Renault drawing level with Nissan’s share in the French company, which is about 15% with no voting rights.\n\nIn June, Nissan revealed details of its alliance pact with top shareholder Renault that keep the latter from unilaterally increasing its stake beyond 44.4%.\n\nThe talks between the two companies cover the question of whether Nissan will join Renault’s new unit being set up to house its electric vehicle (EV) assets in exchange for its French ally winding down the Nissan stake according to a Wall Street Journal report from Friday.\n\nRenault plans to split its electric vehicle (EV) and combustion engine businesses as it seeks to catch up with rivals such as Tesla and Volkswagen in the race to cleaner driving.\n\nExecutives from both companies have discussed Renault’s plan in reshaping their alliance during meetings in France and Japan.\n\nThe negotiations between the companies are intensifying, the Bloomberg report said, adding that Renault Chief Executive Officer Luca de Meo is due to attend the Formula 1 race in Suzuka on Sunday, giving him an opportunity to speak with Nissan CEO Makoto Uchida.\n\nThe report, however, said that weekend talks are unlikely to yield concrete results.\n\nRenault did not immediately reply to Reuters’ request for comment. A Nissan spokesperson did not immediately respond to request for comment outside normal working hours."
