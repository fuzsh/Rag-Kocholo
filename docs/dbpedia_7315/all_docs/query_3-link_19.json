        "text": "Defence Minister welcomes Safran to be a part of joint development production projects (photo: DRDO working on the Kaveri engine)\n\nBy Ajai Shukla\n\nBusiness Standard, 6th July 22\n\nA delegation of French aircraft equipment Safran Group, led by its CEO Mr Olivier Andries, called on Defence Minister Rajnath Singh in Delhi on Tuesday.\n\n“During the meeting, Andries briefed Rajnath Singh on Safran’s plans to set up a Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul (MRO) facility in India for overhauling the LEAP-1A and LEAP-1B engines in use by Indian and foreign commercial airlines,” said a defence ministry (MoD) press release on Tuesday.\n\nSafran is one of the leading original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) of advanced aircraft engines for civil and fighter jets. Among its most successful products is the M88 jet engine that powers the Rafale fighter.\n\nSafran is one of the options being weighed by the MoD for partnering the Defence R&D Organisation in developing the indigenous Kaveri engine that would power home-built aircraft, such as the Advanced Medium Combat Aircraft (AMCA).\n\n“The MRO facility through direct foreign investment of $US 150 million in Hyderabad is expected to create 500-600 highly skilled jobs. The facility will be able to overhaul over 250 engines per year in the beginning,” said the MoD.\n\nSafran’s CEO also apprised Rajnath Singh about the plan to inaugurate two subsidiaries – Safran Aircraft Engines and Safran Electrical & Power India Pvt Ltd – that will both come up in Hyderabad. Safran Electrical & Power India Pvt Ltd will produce harnesses for civil and fighter jets.\n\nIn addition, Safran plans to set up a joint venture (JV) with Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd (HAL) in Bengaluru called Safran-HAL Aircraft Engines.\n\nThe joint venture between Safran and HAL will produce rigid piping for aircraft engines including helicopter engines. The JV is expected to hire 160 new highly skilled personnel.\n\nSafran Aircraft Engines, which will be set up on 10 acres of land in a Hyderabad special economic zone (SEZ) with an investment of Euro 36 million, will produce parts and components for advanced aircraft engines including rotating seals.\n\nThe Safran CEO outlined his company’s long-term plans for co-development and co-production of advanced jet engines and transfer of technology as per the existing Government of India policy. He also briefed Rajnath Singh on Safran’s capabilities in areas of technology beyond aircraft engines.\n\nThe defence minister welcomed new facilities in Hyderabad and the joint venture in Bengaluru. He stressed the importance India attaches to the strategic partnership with France.\n\nSingh invited Safran for more co-development and co-production projects in India, in tune with ‘Make in India, Make for the World’ and ‘Aatmanirbhar Bharat’ plans.\n\n“We are a big market. However, we are increasingly focused on making in India for addressing the needs in a competitive manner and supplying to friendly foreign countries. You can leverage all the competitive advantages India offers, including the cost advantages and availability of trained manpower,” Rajnath Singh said.\n\nThe Raksha Mantri asserted that both countries can contribute to each other's capability building.\n\nSafran Aircraft Engines (previously Snecma) is a French aerospace engine manufacturer headquartered in Courcouronnes, France. It designs, makes and maintains engines for commercial and military aircraft as well as rocket engines for launch vehicles and satellites."
