        "text": "Airbus A220\n\n(formerly Bombardier C Series)\n\nSince 2009, Spirit has designed and built the pylon for the Airbus A220 commercial jet. In addition to the pylon, the work package for both the CS100 and CS300 aircraft models includes systems, strut-to-wing hardware and the aft fairing package. The Belfast site is responsible for the design and manufacture of the advanced composite wings for the A220 family of aircraft including wing assembly and integration, and control surfaces. The site is also responsible for the manufacture of Mid Fuselage.\n\nAirbus A320\n\nSpirit AeroSystems builds the wing leading and trailing edge elements of all the A320 family of aircraft at the company’s plant in Prestwick, Scotland. The components for these narrow-body jets are shipped to Airbus’ three A320 assembly lines in Toulouse, France; Mobile, Alabama; and Tianjin, China. New composite technology for the spoiler developed by Spirit will appear on the A320neo in mid-2019.\n\nAirbus A350 XWB\n\nThe Airbus A350 is a key program for Spirit. The central section panels are built in Kinston, North Carolina, then incorporated into the fuselage (Section 15) in Saint-Nazaire, France. Spirit also manufactures the A350 wing front spar and fixed leading edge.\n\nAirbus A380\n\nSpirit AeroSystems in Prestwick, Scotland, builds wing components (droop slats) for the A380 Superjumbo, the world’s largest passenger jet.\n\nBoeing 737\n\nIn February 2018, Spirit AeroSystems celebrated the delivery of the 10,000th Boeing 737 shipset — fuselage, pylon, wing leading edges, thrust reverser and engine nacelle. For more than 50 years, the Boeing 737 has been built in Wichita, Kansas. Today, Spirit makes approximately 70 percent of this narrow-body aircraft for Boeing.\n\nBoeing P-8A Poseidon\n\nIn 2016, Spirit began production of the P-8A, a derivative of the Boeing 737. The program demonstrates Spirit AeroSystems’ unique capability to build military-specific aircraft using decades of experience building the 737, making the P-8A more affordable and of the highest quality possible.\n\nBoeing 747-8\n\nSpirit builds the forward fuselage section of the famed Boeing 747 wide-body jumbo jet, along with its nacelles, struts and wing leading edge. The aircraft is now purchased and used primarily for cargo freight.\n\nBoeing KC-46A\n\nAerial Refueling Tanker Aircraft\n\nA military derivative of the Boeing 767, Spirit has manufactured the tanker’s forward fuselage (Section 41), strut and nacelle components, and the fixed leading edge since 2013. Spirit assisted in the design of the next-generation tanker, which will replace the aging KC-135 Stratotanker fleet.\n\nBoeing 767\n\nSpirit builds the forward fuselage structure and other components for the Boeing 767. While the aircraft is no longer produced for commercial fleets, it’s found success by being modified and repurposed as a cargo freighter. The 767-300F is considered a reliable workhorse for premier cargo airlines, including UPS and FedEx.\n\nBoeing 777 and 777X\n\nIn late 2017, Spirit AeroSystems began production on Boeing’s next-generation widebody airliner, the 777X, featuring fuel-efficient new engines from GE and a composite folding wing. Spirit provides the forward fuselage, nacelles and struts for both the 777 and 777X.\n\nBoeing 787\n\nSpirit AeroSystems delivers a fully integrated fuselage structure for the Boeing 787 Dreamliner. The composite forward fuselage (Section 41) and engine pylons are built in Wichita, Kansas, and the wing fixed leading edge and wing movable leading edge are built in Tulsa, Oklahoma, and Subang, Malaysia. Spirit has been delivering these assemblies and components on the 787 since 2007. In 2016, the 500th unit was delivered to Boeing.\n\nRolls-Royce BR725\n\nSpirit AeroSystems builds the nacelle package for the BR725 program and delivers a fully integrated powerplant system to Rolls-Royce. Spirit was named the 2018 Rolls-Royce Supplier of the Year for the company’s commitment to quality and delivery on the program.\n\nMitsubishi MRJ\n\nSpirit designs and builds the pylon for the Mitsubishi Regional Jet (MRJ), a 70- to 90-seat-class aircraft. The contract was awarded in 2008 and represented Spirit’s entry into the regional jet market.\n\nLockheed/Sikorsky CH-53K King Stallion\n\nIn June 2018, Spirit AeroSystems delivered the final System Demonstration Test Article (SDTA) CH-53K fuselage to Sikorsky, a Lockheed Martin company, for the U.S. Marines. Spirit is responsible for the assembly of the entire cockpit and cabin and delivering the complete fuselage to Sikorsky. The lightweight composite fuselage structure supports the Marines’ needed additional heavy-lift capability with triple the load-carrying capacity of the current CH-53E Super Stallion. The new heavy-lifter will allow the U.S. Marine Corps and international militaries to move troops and equipment from ship to shore, and to higher-altitude terrain, more quickly and effectively than ever before.\n\nBell Helicopter V-280\n\nSpirit’s unique capability to design, build and deliver with the highest quality, lowest possible cost and speed to market was demonstrated when the company designed and assembled the first all-composite Bell V-280 helicopter fuselage in only 22 months. As a proud member of Team Valor, Spirit developed the fuselage, comprised of aluminum sub-substructure with composite skins, at its rapid-prototyping facility in Wichita, Kansas.\n\nNorthrop Grumman B-21 Raider\n\nSpirit AeroSystems is proud to be a member of the B-21 Raider industry team—a program vital to national security. Spirit has a long history of supporting long-range strike capability for the warfighter and is pleased to build on that legacy as a member of the B-21 Raider team.\n\nBombardier Challenger 350 business jet\n\nThe Belfast site manufactures the centre fuselage. The Casablanca site assembles emergency doors.\n\nBombardier Challenger 650 business jet\n\nThe Belfast site manufactures the centre fuselage and engine nacelles.\n\nBombardier Global 5500 and 6500 business jets\n\nThe Belfast site manufactures the forward fuselage, engine nacelles, horizontal stabiliser and other components. The Casablanca site assembles the floors."
