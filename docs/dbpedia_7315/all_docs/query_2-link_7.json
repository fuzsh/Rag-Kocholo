        "text": "The Presidents of France require comfortable, spacious cars for their frequent – and sometimes very short – journeys. Over the past hundred years and more, many Renault flagship vehicles have served as the official car of the French presidency. Some were open-top vehicles, allowing the President to wave to the crowds, particularly on their election. Others were made-to-measure stretch limousines or SUVs for greater comfort. And for the past forty years, most have been armoured, for security reasons. From Paul Deschanel's 40CV in the 1920s to Emmanuel Macron's Rafale a hundred years later, rediscover the history of these presidential vehicles by Renault.\n\n1920: Renault 40CV, the official car of Presidents Paul Deschanel, Alexandre Millerand and Gaston Doumergue\n\nBuilt between 1908 and 1928, Renault 40 CV was the official car of the President of the French Republic from 1920 to 1928. A luxury saloon, it was powered by a 6-cylinder engine with displacement of up to 9.5 litres. Its glorious sporting reputation made it particularly popular with the upper classes. A sports version of Renault 40 CV smashed the record at the Montlhéry 24-hour event in 1926, travelling 4,167.578 km at an average speed of 173.649 km/h.\n\n1931: Renault Reinastella convertible, the official car of Presidents Paul Doumer and Albert Lebrun\n\nIn 1929, Renault Reinastella, generally referred to as ‘Stella’, replaced the prestigious 40 CV at the top of the Renault range. Built between 1929 and 1933, it was powered by a straight-eight engine. The luxurious interior was in keeping with the generous exterior dimensions: 5.50 metres long, 1.92 metres wide and over 2.7 tonnes on the scales.\n\n1938: Renault Nerva Grand Sport, the official car of President Albert Lebrun\n\nIn 1938, Renault built a special version of Nerva Grand Sport for President Albert Lebrun. Part of the Stella premium range, this saloon was powered by a 5.4-litre straight-eight engine. Renault's last pre-war flagship, Nerva Grand Sport featured a design considered as highly futuristic for the 1930s, with aerodynamic lines that allowed it to reach a top speed of 145 km/h.\n\n1941: Renault Suprastella, the official car of President Vincent Auriol\n\nSuprastella was a luxury saloon car built in 1938 and 1939, designed for corporate executives and government dignitaries. It was the last Renault to be powered by a straight-eight engine. Renault built a special convertible version delivered in 1942. This unique vehicle was subsequently used by General de Gaulle and Presidents Auriol and Coty until 1950.\n\n1981: Renault 30, the official car of President François Mitterrand\n\nPremiered at the 1975 Geneva Motor Show, Renault 30 was sold until 1983. At the time, originality was the hallmark of Renault’s premium range, as illustrated by this hatchback saloon. Featuring a V6 engine, a wealth of equipment and exceptional onboard comfort, Renault 30 was selected in 1981 by newly elected President François Mitterrand. His decision marked a break with the Citroën era of Charles de Gaulle and Georges Pompidou, and the Peugeot era of Valéry Giscard d'Estaing, his predecessors.\n\n1984: Renault 25 stretch limousine, the official car of President François Mitterrand\n\nIn the 1980s, Renault 25 was the car for France’s politicians. For both of his presidential terms, François Mitterrand chose a limousine version, lengthened 22.7 cm by Heuliez and with armoured bodywork. He even ordered several examples. At the time, Renault 25 France’s is most aerodynamic premium saloon, with a Cd of 0.28. The President ordered individual seats at the rear, similar to those at the front. In 1988, the luxurious Baccara finish made a major impression, with an array of modern features including automatic air conditioning and electric massage seats, with the name of Ergomatic.\n\n1992: Renault Safrane with a chassis extension, the official car of Presidents François Mitterrand and Jacques Chirac\n\nUnveiled in 1992, Renault Safrane was made available to François Mitterrand that same year. The President received a unique example with a V6 engine, extended and armoured by Labbé. Several other models followed and were also chosen by Jacques Chirac for his two terms in office. A worthy heir to Renault 25, the Safrane V6 Limousine Baccara was seen as the epitome of luxury. The interior resembled a living room with a thick leather and wood. The wide array of equipment included GPS navigation, electric seats with a memory function and self-levelling suspension.\n\n2008: armoured Renault Vel Satis V6, the official car of Presidents Nicolas Sarkozy and Emmanuel Macron\n\nOn Bastille Day 2008, Renault delivered an armoured Renault Vel Satis V6 with a 25 cm chassis extension to President Nicolas Sarkozy. An incredibly modern vehicle for its time, Vel Satis was marketed between 2002 and 2009. Its comfort and spacious interior made it the preferred choice for the head of state.\n\n2016: armoured Renault Espace V, the official car of Presidents François Hollande and Emmanuel Macron\n\nPresident François Hollande chose a Renault Espace V as his official vehicle. He requested an armoured model in a unique shade of dark blue, delivered in 2016. His successor Emmanuel Macron drove up the Champs Elysées in this same vehicle on the day of his swearing-in ceremony in 2017.\n\n2024: Renault Rafale, official car of Emmanuel Macron's Presidency of the Republic\n\nOn the 14th of July 2024, Renault Rafale becomes the new official car of the Presidency of the Republic. President Emmanuel Macron has chosen Renault's latest D-segment model. The only one of its kind in the world, the car supplied to the Presidency benefits from features that meet the requirements of the presidential function, such as a special 'Nocturnal Blue' body colour, a grille decorated with a tricolour flag in a gradient, removable banner holders, blue, white and red wing badges on the front doors and special 20-inch wheels.\n\nShowcasing the excellence of the French automotive industry in their official vehicles choice, the Presidents of France sometimes demonstrate a personal passion for cars. This was the case of Georges Pompidou, who used to say: \"The French love their cars\". The Paris Motor Show is always an occasion for an official visit. This event is an opportunity for presidents to discover the latest vehicles in the Renault range. In some cases, new vehicles are unveiled to the head of state at the Presidential Palace, as in the case of Renault Twingo with François Mitterrand and, more recently, Renault Rafale and Renault 5 E-tech electric with President Macron. After all, every Renault model is part of France's heritage."
