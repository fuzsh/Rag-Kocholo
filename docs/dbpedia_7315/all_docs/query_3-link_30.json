        "text": "Engines Propellers Other Tools of Control\n\nWhile wings proved to be a successful way to lift an aircraft, what would power and propel it into the sky? And once up there, how could a pilot control its movement in three-dimensional space?\n\nEarly aircraft designers approached these challenges by developing different types of engines, propellers, and devices to control a flying airplane. By examining the objects in the Museum's collection, we can piece together the story of how early aviators learned to control and power airplanes.\n\nPowering an Aircraft: Engines\n\n“…the navigation of the air is certain to come so soon as a motor could be discovered which had sufficient energy in proportion to its weight.”\n\n-Hiram Maxim, inventor, 1891\n\nEarly engines had to be powerful enough to propel the aircraft into the sky, yet light enough so they didn’t weigh the aircraft down and keep it from taking off. Most engines of the time powered land vehicles, where their weight was not an issue. Adapting these engines to aircraft was one of the greatest challenges in building a successful airplane. Four types of aircraft engines were used: inline, V-type, radial, and rotary. Each had its advantages and disadvantages.\n\nInline Engines\n\nInline engines, with a single line of cylinders, already powered most cars. Because some were made from new, lighter aluminum, they made sense for airplanes. But they were water-cooled, and the added water weight meant early inline engines were generally heavier than air-cooled engines.\n\nPowering Forward: Propellers\n\n“Well, our propellers are so different from any that have been used before that they will have to either be a good deal better, or a good deal worse.”\n\n-Orville Wright, 1903\n\nWhile the choice of an engine is critical, propellers are the second half of the power equation. They convert the engine’s power into thrust to push the aircraft forward through the air. The Wright brothers invented the modern propeller. They were first to realize that propellers acted like wings. The Wrights used their wind tunnel data on wings to help make a propeller far more efficient than those of other early experimenters, such as Langley.\n\nOther manufacturers soon made designs of their own. To help take full advantage of the advances in engine horsepower, designers experimented with many different propellers to try and find the most efficient one. Explore some of these designs from the Museum's collection below.\n\nBastow-Page Airship Propeller"
