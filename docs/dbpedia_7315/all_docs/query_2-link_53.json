        "text": "Renault Group has appointed Adam Wood as its new managing director in the UK, succeeding Guillaume Sicard, who will now serve as vice president (VP) for Renault in France.\n\nSicard takes over from Ivan Segal on 1 October, who has been named as the vice president of global sales and operations for the Renault brand.\n\nBoth Sicard and Wood will now report to Segal.\n\nSicard’s promotion to Renault France VP follows a tenure as managing director of Renault UK, where he significantly expanded operations and strengthened market presence.\n\nHis diverse background includes various positions across France, South Africa, Turkey, India, and China.\n\nThe new role is a return to familiar territory for Wood, who has previously spent 14 years at Renault, undertaking various marketing and brand management roles.\n\nIn that stint, he held senior positions such as Dacia brand director, marketing director, and head of marketing communications and corporate planning manager.\n\nWood joined Stellantis in 2021, where he served as the marketing director of Vauxhall before taking up the position of managing director of Peugeot UK.\n\nHis new responsibilities at Renault will involve leading the expansion of the company’s product line-up in the UK market over the next few years.\n\nThe French brand in its press statement said: “Wood is joining Renault UK at a pivotal time.\n\n“Renault is one of the fastest-growing brands in the UK over the past two years by registration volumes, and is seeking to drive home the early successes of the Renaulution with further growth as it renews and expands its model line-up across passenger cars and LCVs [light commercial vehicles].”"
