        "text": "I wasn't able to find any good historical references, so this answer is pure opinion. (sorry). I'll break this down into two separate questions.\n\nIs there any reason for single-engine propellers to turn the same way?\n\nYes. When flying, the spin direction of the prop has several effects. Helical prop wash, p-factor, gyroscopic precession, differing blade angles of attack all are due to the asymmetry of spinning in a single direction. An experienced pilot will want to understand and compensate for these effects when necessary. It is easy to see that once this is understood, a single configuration will be preferred within a community to minimize differences between aircraft.\n\nIs there any reason to prefer CW rotation over CCW as a convention in a single engine plane?\n\nNone that I am aware of. It appears to be simply an accident of choice. I had wondered if the majority of engines available to early manufacturers was in that direction and made it preferable, but I couldn't find anything suggesting that. Indeed today the majority of automobile engines rotate the opposite direction. Making (piston) engines rotate the other direction is not a huge problem. Twin-engined aircraft and watercraft often have counterrotating engines and propellers.\n\nIndeed today the majority of automobile engines rotate the opposite direction.\n\nNot quite. The power output of a car engine is towards the rear. The power output of an aircraft engine is toward the front. If you look straight at the flywheel / propeller end they usually turn the same way.\n\nBack in WWI the first-generation fighters (We're talking Sopwith Camels and Fokker triplanes here) did have props going in either direction. The airframe manufacturer made the whole thing and props were carved by hand, so it didn't matter much.\n\nToday we have a small handful of prop makers, a smaller handful of engine makers, and both of them would be quite happy if everything turned the same way. Yes, it's really easy to make a piston engine go the other way, and it's really easy to flip the prop's airfoil over, but that means making and stocking different parts. The camshaft, pumps, ignition timing, prop governor, starter, mechanical meters etc. are all directional. And don't forget the pilots - if he's used to putting left boot to it on takeoff, and rents one that needs right boot, takeoff will be interesting.\n\nIf your twin or multi has counter-rotating props you have some advantages if one quits but you have extra maintenance costs. Imagine the language your mechanic will use after changing the camshaft and then remembering this engine is a leftie when he tries to start it.\n\nIf it's a geared engine then it's much easier - the engine and accessories are standard, there's just an extra (or one fewer) bit in the gearbox, plus the other-hand prop.\n\nI am quite amazed no-one has hit upon the obvious, its all to do with starting. Being both a pilot and totally arrogant of the unfortunate minority who are left handed. On a car with a starting handle, I would cup the handle in my right hand and with a mighty swing. Spin the handle from a low point 'upwards' and physically towards my center of gravity causing the engine to turn in a clockwise direction as viewed from the front.\n\nStarting handles; what are they? Great lumps of bent iron which could be fed through a hole in the bumper and engage with a dog on the end of the crankshaft.(quite sure these keys and starter buttons will never catch on) And here is the reason; a petulant engine on a damp cold day will do anything to stay in the garage, include oiling its plugs and electrocute anyone's hand that is fiddling with the HT leads, and after half a dozen attempts at starting, the battery will go flat, hence out will come the handle.\n\nIn a politically correct world the majority would bow to the misfortunes of the minority but after swinging an engine for half an hour 'sod the left handed minority'.\n\nSo there you have it, its a throwback to the golden age of motoring and right handed people rule but what about aeroplanes.\n\nThere is no simple way of saying this but; stand in front of a PA28 with a 140 horse power engine with a metal prop and a flat battery, (probably the finest mincing machine known to mankind).\n\nFacing the aircraft with mags and switches off, the propeller would be turned by hand to a point where the compression on the engine is just building then stand back. A command to make the engine live is given. If the rotation of the engine is counterclockwise as viewed from the front of the aeroplane, a stance is made forward and clear of the arc of the propeller. Just the fingertips of the right hand grasp the trailing edge of the blade and in a single pull; spin the propeller over top dead center and instantly clear the arc of the propeller. This is a highly dangerous practice but can safely be accomplished with care.\n\nIf the rotation of the propeller were to be to the right or clockwise as viewed from the front, I would then grasp the propeller with the finger tips on my left hand. (as I am right handed) I would hold hands with another person standing behind me to prevent any possibility in over balancing.\n\n----------There is absolutely no reason why an engine or propeller should have a preference to turn in either direction apart from commercial considerations, custom and practice and the desire for safety in hand starting the contraptions-------For the record I ran an airflow test laboratory for many years and I can assure anyone that the absorbed power of a fan, provided it is of a mirror airfoil section will be identical."
