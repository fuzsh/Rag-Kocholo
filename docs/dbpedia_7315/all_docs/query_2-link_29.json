        "text": "On Tuesday, November 8, Renault CEO Luca de Meo presented the third and final phase of his \"Renaulution.\" The strategic plan began with \"Resurrection,\" where Mr. de Meo focused on margin and cash generation recovery, to \"Renovation,\" which sought to feed the brand's profitability, and finished with \"Revolution,\" a phase which Mr. de Meo hopes will turn Renault into a frontrunner in the world of tech mobility.\n\nThe CEO posed a mathematical question regarding his strategy: Can the sum of the company's parts be greater than the whole? Aristotle stated the opposite, but the boss doesn't care. His opinion is that by reorganizing Renault into five entities and opening some of them up to outside shareholders, they will reach a total value that is much higher than the total of the group on the stock market today.\n\nAs of Monday, November 7, the diamond-logo company had a market value of €9.3 billion, less than Stellantis (€44 billion), Volkswagen (€53.5 billion) and Tesla (€627 billion). However, these amounts reflect the means available to manufacturers to invest and cope with the electric vehicle transition. Therefore, it is necessary for Renault to increase its resources.\n\nThe first entity, Ampère, will unite electric vehicle and software projects with a total of 10,000 employees; it will be listed on the Euronext stock exchange in 2023. Prior to that, its capital will be opened up to a strategic partner, US microprocessor manufacturer Qualcomm, which develops Snapdragon chips for electric cars and wants to increase its onboard computing capacity.\n\nRenault is also strengthening its partnership with Google and the Android operating system. With this technology, it can develop predictive maintenance and insurance based on usage and driving behavior. In order to keep an electric car running smoothly, its software system needs to be updated frequently, just like a mobile phone's, to improve and add functionality and, above all, to manage the battery well.\n\nMitsubishi and Nissan are also considering buying stakes in Ampère, which is estimated to be worth €10 billion – more than Renault is currently worth. \"When I arrived,\" explained Mr. de Meo, \"I asked how much of the electric vehicle value chain Renault owned. I was told it was only 10%, even though we were pioneers. As of today, the group has captured 35% of the market, and with Ampère, we aim to increase this to 80%.\" The group's French sites will essentially work for this entity.\n\nAn exclusive brand and a bank\n\nAs for the second entity, Renault already has the Alpine brand, through which it wants to dominate the top-of-the-range part of the market, which is experiencing double-digit growth and operating margins, topics with which the CEO is obsessed."
