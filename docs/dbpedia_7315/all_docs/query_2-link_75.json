        "text": "The French carmaker Renault said on Monday that it was considering a proposal by Fiat Chrysler to merge and form a global partnership aimed at improving their chances of surviving the coming perilous and costly shift to electric and self-driving cars.\n\nIf the proposal goes forward, the new company would displace General Motors as the third-largest car company in the world, behind Volkswagen and Toyota, and significantly change the balance of power in the global auto industry.\n\nUnder Fiat’s proposal, shareholders of both companies would receive 50 percent of the new company. The combination would have a total value on the stock market of $39 billion.\n\nThere is a consensus among industry executives and analysts that carmakers must link up to share the cost of a transition from internal combustion engines to avoid being run over by fast-moving tech industry challengers like Tesla or Uber. A Fiat-Renault deal would put pressure on rivals to find partners or be left behind as competitors unite in new mega-alliances.\n\nProposing a full-blown merger illustrates the urgency that automakers feel as they stand on the brink of what may be the biggest period of transition since the early days of the automobile.\n\nBut a union of Fiat Chrysler and Renault could also destabilize the French company’s longtime alliance with Nissan of Japan, which is already troubled. A Nissan spokesman on Monday declined to comment. Fiat’s proposal is certain to be a topic when the alliance’s board meets in Tokyo on Wednesday, and the announcement was planned so Renault would be free to discuss it openly with Nissan.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
