It also supports the Group’s target to return to an investment grade rating.\n\nThis sale results from the exercise by Nissan of its right of first offer to acquire 99,132,100 Nissan shares following a notice from Renault Group expressing its intention to sell 280,690,000 Nissan shares (representing up to 7% of Nissan capital). Pursuant to the New Alliance Agreement, Renault Group has the option to sell the remainder of the Nissan shares that have not been bought back by Nissan, representing 181,557,900 Nissan shares, during a 180-day period to Nissan or to third-parties.\n\nThis sale was implemented as part of the share buyback program announced by Nissan on March 27, 2024 and implemented on March 28, 2024. As a result of Nissan’s decision to cancel all the bought back shares, the transaction will be accretive for Nissan’s shareholders (see table below for more details). This cancellation will be implemented on April 3, 2024.\n\nAs a consequence of the sale of 99,132,100 Nissan shares, the accounting impacts will be the following:\n\nOn Renault Group consolidated financial statements: a capital loss on disposal of around €440 million, which will impact the net income (this capital loss, booked in \"other operating income and expenses\", will not impact the Group's operating income).\n\nOn Renault S.A. statutory statements: a capital gain on disposal of around €50 million.\n\nEvolution of Nissan capital held by Renault Group\n\nSituation as of November 8, 2023in % of capitalTotal number of shares forming the capital of Nissan4,220,715,112 Total number of shares held by Renault Group1,831,837,027 43.40%- Directly-held Nissan shares633,107,309 15.00%- Nissan shares held in the French Trust1,198,729,718 28.40%Situation as of December 31, 2023 in % of capitalTotal number of shares forming the capital of Nissan4,009,715,112 Total number of shares held by Renault Group1,620,837,027 40.42%- Directly-held Nissan shares633,107,309 15.79%- Nissan shares held in the French Trust987,729,718 24.63%Transaction of March 28, 2024in % of capitalNumber of Nissan shares sold by Renault Group to Nissan99 132 1002.47%Situation after Nissan shares cancellationin % of capitalTotal number of Nissan shares forming the capital of Nissan 3,909,472,212 Total number of Nissan shares held by Renault Group1,521 704,92738.92%- Directly-held Nissan shares633,107,309 16.19%- Nissan shares held in the French Trust888,59,761822.73%\n\nIn accordance with the New Alliance Agreement, Renault Group has no obligation to dispose of the 1.19% in excess of the 15%, and Nissan will continue to hold a 15% stake in Renault Group.
