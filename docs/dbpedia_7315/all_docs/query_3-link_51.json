        "text": "Click to view all Aircraft Engines: World War II articles starting with the most recent.\n\nAlfa Romeo 1101 28-Cylinder Aircraft Engine - The Alfa Romeo 1101 was an Italian 28-cylinder aircraft engine that produced an excess of 2,000 hp (1,471 kW). Developmental issues and World War II prevented the 1101 from entering production.\n\nAllison V-3420 24-Cylinder Aircraft Engine - The Allison V-3420 24-cylinder engine was more than just two coupled V-1710s. The large engine showed promise, but other priorities and a lack of aircraft applications regulated the V-3420 to obscurity.\n\nArmstrong Siddeley ‘Dog’ Aircraft Engines - In the 1930s, Armstrong Siddeley started a new line of engines named after dogs (canines). Most of these engines were radials with banks of inline cylinders. The most famous engine of the series was the Deerhound.\n\nContinental XI-1430 Aircraft Engine - Developed from the Continental O-1430, the inverted Vee XI-1430 was a compact, high-performance aircraft engine. Although 2,100 hp was achieved, the engine was troublesome and too late for WWII.\n\nDaimler-Benz DB 604 X-24 Aircraft Engine - The Daimler-Benz DB 604 was an X-24 engine designed to power aircraft of the Bomber B specification. However, the RLM chose the Junkers Jumo 222 engine, and the DB 604 was cancelled in 1942.\n\nDaimler-Benz DB 606, DB 610, and DB 613 Doppelmotoren - The Daimler-Benz DB 606, DB 610, and DB 613 aircraft engines were created by coupling two respective DB 601, DB 605, or DB 603 together. The large and heavy doppelmotoren proved troublesome.\n\nDobrynin M-250, VD-3TK, and VD-4K Aircraft Engines - Through and after WWII, Soviet engineer Vladimir Dobrynin developed a series of 24-cylinder aircraft engines. These inline radial engines had six cylinder banks and produced 2,200 to 4,300 hp (1,640 to 3,207 kW).\n\nFairey P.24 Monarch Aircraft Engine - Designed by Richard Forsyth, the P.24 Monarch was Fairey Aviation’s final attempt to enter the aircraft piston engine business. The 24-cylinder Monarch was essentially two engines in a common crankcase.\n\nFIAT A.38, A.40, and A.44 Aircraft Engines - The last piston aircraft engines designed by FIAT were distinct and innovative. However, the V-16, X-24, and X-32 engines never entered production due to WWII and because existing engines proved sufficient.\n\nFKFS Gruppen-Flugmotor A, C, and D - The FKFS Gruppen-Flugmotor A, C, and D were attempts to create powerful, 48-cylinder aircraft engines for German WWII bombers.\n\nHispano-Suiza 24Z (Type 95) Aircraft Engine - Drawing inspiration from the 24Y engine, Hispano-Suiza developed the 24Z. The jet age made the large, 3,600 hp (2,685 kW) H-24 engine obsolete.\n\nHitachi/Nakajima [Ha-51] 22-Cylinder Aircraft Engine - During WWII, the Imperial Japanese Army encouraged the development of high-power aircraft engines. One result of this work was the 22-cylinder Hitachi/Nakajima [Ha-51] radial engine of 2,450 hp.\n\nIsotta Fraschini Zeta X-24 Aircraft Engine - The Isotta Fraschini Zeta was an air-cooled, 24-cylinder engine developed in Italy during WWII. Flown only in the Caproni Vizzola F.6Z, cooling issues and Italy’s surrender limited the engine’s development.\n\nJunkers Jumo 222 Aircraft Engine - The Junkers Jumo 222 24-cylinder inline radial was intended to be the next generation of German aircraft engines during WWII. Developmental issues and material shortages prevented its production.\n\nJunkers Jumo 223 Aircraft Engine - The Junkers Jumo 223 was a 24-cylinder, diesel, opposed-piston, aircraft engine. The 2,500 hp (1,860 kW) engine was intended to be used in long-range aircraft during WWII.\n\nJunkers Jumo 224 Aircraft Engine - Following the Jumo 223, Junkers designed a larger, 24-cylinder, diesel, opposed-piston, aircraft engine that was forecasted to produce 4,400 hp (3,280 kW). Taken over by the USSR after the war, the engine was redesignated M-224.\n\nKlöckner-Humboldt-Deutz (KHD) Dz 700, Dz 710, and Dz 720 - Starting in the late 1930s and continuing through WWII, KHD built a series of two-stroke, diesel aircraft engines. The culmination of this effort was the 5,900 hp (4,400 kW), 32-cylinder KHD 720.\n\nLycoming XH-2470 24-Cylinder Aircraft Engine - Lycoming worked to create a new engine by combining components from two O-1230 engines. The new engine was known as the XH-2470, but it was not developed in time to benefit the US Armed Forces.\n\nLycoming XR-7755 36-Cylinder Aircraft Engine - In 1943, Lycoming began work on a powerful and efficient engine intended to power the next generation of very large aircraft. The 5,000 hp XR-7755 ran in 1946, but such a large engine was no longer needed.\n\nMathis Vega 42-Cylinder Aircraft Engine - The Mathis Vega was a French 42-cylinder aircraft engine built just before WWII. Attempts were made to produce the 2,800 hp (2,088 kW) engine after the war, but the time of large piston aircraft engines had passed.\n\nMitsubishi A21 / Ha-50 22-Cylinder Aircraft Engine - During World War II, Mitsubishi endeavored to create an aircraft engine that produced an excess of 3,000 hp (2,237 kW). The end result was the 22-cylinder, two-row A21 / Ha-50 that produced 3,100 hp (2,312 kW).\n\nMitsubishi [Ha-43] (A20 / Ha-211 / MK9) Aircraft Engine - The Mitsubishi [Ha-43] was a late-war attempt for Japan to produce a lightweight, high-horsepower, radial engine. Developmental issues and bombing raids prevented quantity production of the engine.\n\nNakajima [Ha-54] (Ha-505) 36-Cylinder Aircraft Engine - The Nakajima [Ha-54] (Ha-505) was an attempt to build a 36-cylinder, 5,000 hp (3,728 kW) radial engine for a bomber capable of striking the US. Technical issues and Japan’s decline brought the project to an end.\n\nNapier H-24 Sabre Aircraft Engine - The Naiper Sabre was the last H engine designed by Frank Halford. From a troubled start, the complex Sabre ultimately produced more power for its displacement than any other WWII aircraft engine.\n\nOne Second in the Life of a Racer – by Tom Fey - Tom Fey breaks down the inner workings of a race-prepped Merlin engine as it powers a modified P-51 Mustang to 480 mph around the course at the Reno Air Races.\n\nOne Second on the Course with Dreadnought – by Tom Fey - Tom Fey breaks down the inner workings of the R-4360 engine installed in the Sanders Family’s air racer Dreadnought as it provides race-power on the course at the Reno Air Races.\n\nReggiane Re 101 to Re 105 Aircraft Engines - During WWII, the Italian aircraft manufacturer Reggiane designed a few aircraft engines. Only the Re 103 was built. It was an inverted W-18 that produced 1,740 hp (1,298 kW) and displaced 2,435 cu in (39.9 L).\n\nRolls-Royce Exe (Boreas) and Pennine Aircraft Engines - From the late 1930s to the mid-1940s, Rolls-Royce developed two air-cooled X-24 aircraft engines: the 1,200 hp (895 kW) Exe and the 2,800 hp (2,088 kW) Pennine. Neither engine entered production.\n\nRolls-Royce Vulture X-24 Aircraft Engine - Developed in the late 1930s, the Rolls-Royce Vulture X-24 was rushed through development and into service. As a result, the Vulture proved unreliable and was cancelled in favor of other aircraft engines.\n\nStudebaker’s XH-9350 and Their Involvement with Other Aircraft Engines - Authored by William Pearce, the book details the Studebaker XH-9350: a project during WWII to create a large, 5,000 hp, fuel efficient, piston aircraft engine.\n\nWright Aeronautical R-4090 Cyclone 22 Aircraft Engine - During WWII, Wright Aeronautical built the 3,000 hp (2,237 kW) twin-row R-4090 using 22 cylinders from the R-3350 engine. The R-4090 was abandoned as all resources were needed on the R-3350.\n\nYokosuka YE2H (W-18) and YE3B (X-24) Aircraft Engines - The Yokosuka YE2H and YE3B were an attempt by the Japanese Navy during WWII to create a powerful and compact aircraft engine that could be installed in the wings or fuselage of an aircraft."
