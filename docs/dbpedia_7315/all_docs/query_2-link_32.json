        "text": "Renault Group has uneviled its ts new-generation logistics facility in Villeroy, France, which is 100% automated and equipped with the system from Exotec, a French industrial robotics company. Exotec's Skypod robots will facilitate the work of operators by picking items at height, thereby eliminating the risk of falling for operators.\n\nExotec's robots are autonomous and equipped with advanced navigation and handling capabilities.\n\nTheir compact design and their agility allow them to move quickly and efficiently in complex logistics environments, especially in the presence of other equipments and workers.\n\nCurrently, 191 robots are deployed at the Villeroy site according to specific requirements, whether for picking, inventory, put-away or compaction.\n\nThe facility can prepare nearly 4,000 order lines per hour at its peak of activity with 14 picking stations.\n\nXavier Lhors, Director of After-Sales Logistics at Renault Group, says: \"We are proud to collaborate with Exotec to equip our supply chain with Skypod® robots, positioning our Villeroy site at the forefront of innovation. Thanks to this solution and the teams in place, we will be able to increase by 25% the number of orders served and strengthen our commitment to customer satisfaction, which remains a priority for us.”\n\nThomas Genestar, Managing Director Western Europe at Exotec, adds: \"The collaboration between Renault Group and Exotec combines a flagship of the national automotive industry with an emerging leader in French robotics logistics. Together, we have gathered French industrial know-how and the desire to bring it into a new era. We are proud to work with Renault Group, a major player in its sector, whose trust demonstrates Exotec's ability to meet the complex and specific needs of its customers. The flexibility and agility of our Skypod® system, which allows us to adapt to changing production, is an asset for those in the automotive sector who want better operational comfort and greater efficiency.\""
