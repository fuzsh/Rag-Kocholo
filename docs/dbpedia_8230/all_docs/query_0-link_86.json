        "text": "DATELINE Time Events 320 BC Date undefined. Aristov 1896, p. 279>: In Chinese annals, long before our era south of Altai mountains lived Huns, in the north lived people So. Then So split up into 4 tribes: Kuman or Kuban, Kyrgyz, Chu-kishi and Turks (or they consisted of these 4 tribes at the time of the oldest records ) 318 BC First historical document connected with Huns is Chinese-Hun treaty signed in 318 BC 300 BC 300 BC\n\nTürkic language splits into 2 branches, Ogur (Eastern) and Oguz (Kipchak) (Western). Oguz 'z', 'y, i', (Oguz, yilan, Yaik) Ogur 'r', 'd, dj', (Ogur, djulan, Djaik)\n\n201 BC V. Carlgren: Ethnonym Kypchak (Kyichak) in Chinese annals is Tsuishe (Kuishe, Kuche, Kyueshe, Kushi, Kushu, Kuchuk) 201 BC Tsuishe are first listed among people conquered by Maotun in 201 BC, along with Geguns, ancestors of Enisei Kirgizes 77 AD Plinius Secundus (Pliny the Elder, 2379 CE), Nat. Hist. 6.12 calls Derbent fortress Cumania 300 AD\n\nGaogyuys are listed as branch of Huns in Chinese annals\n\n300\n\nGenealogy:\n\nGaogyuys (Chinese High Coach) => Tele/Chile/Tiele (Türk. Coach) (both tele and coach derive from Turkic stems) =>15 tribes =>\n\n1 Uange (Uygurs)\n\n2 Seyanto (Sir + Yanto)\n\n3 Kibi (Kibir)\n\n4 Dubo (Tubalar)(Dabo)(Tele)\n\n5 Guligan (Kurykan)(Yakut)\n\n6 Dolange (Telengits)\n\n7 Bugu (Pugu)(Uygurs)\n\n8 Bayegu (Baiyrku)( Uygurs)\n\n9 Tunlo (Tongra)(Uygurs)\n\n10 Hun 11 Sygye (Uygurs)\n\n12 Husye\n\n13 Higye\n\n14 Adye(Eduz)\n\n15 Baysi (Barsil)\n\n301\n\nSeyanto (Sir + Yanto) occupied steppes between Mongol Altay and E.

This is 500 years before Saracen=Kumans=Kipchaks show up, 250 years before Muhammad, 600 years before Saracens become synonymous with Moslems. The channel for Saracens to supply horses for Roman army is unknown, if they were not a part of Sary As Alans who served in Roman elite forces. Later application of Saracen to Kipchaks may be of generalized character. Ptolemy's Geography refers to distinct from Arabs Σαρακηνός Sarakenoi people in north-western Arabian peninsula. Ascribing horse trading to Bedouins in 4th c. Arabia is problematic because knowledge of horse breeding and horsemanship was brought to Arabia and first to Bedouins only after conversion of Persians to Islam in 7th century AD, adding horses to their traditional camels 456 Georgian records tell about Kypchaks in S.
