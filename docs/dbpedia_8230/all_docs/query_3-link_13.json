It would also depend on the time period, since massive events like the Mongol invasions in the 13th century had a big effect on the Cumans-Kipchaks. At that time there seemed to be a lot of them to go around. In 1229 the king of Georgia was able to field an army that included 20,000 Kipchak mercenaries. Koten Khan, the leader of the Cuman-Kipchaks (or at least the western branch) when the Mongols invaded eventually fled to Hungary with 40,000 families. Depending on the average size of Cuman families that could equal as many as 200,000 people. In the east there are also mentions of the Khwarazmians being able to raise large armies of Kipchak mercenaries. In fact that was the backbone of their military.\n\nNo one knows if it's Cumans or the Kipchaks who made up the the majority of the population.\n\n\" The original meaning of the endonym Cuman is unknown. It is also often unclear whether a particular name refers to the Cumans alone, or to both them and the Kipchaks, as the two tribes often lived side by side.[7] \"\n\n\"As stated above, it is unknown whether the name Kipchak referred only to the Kipchaks proper, or to the Cumans as well. The two tribes eventually fused, lived together and probably exchanged weaponry, culture and languages; the Cumans encompassed the western half of the confederation, while the Kipchaks and (presumably) the Kangli/Kankalis (a ruling clan of the Pechenegs) encompassed the eastern half.[7]:6 \"\n\nI am tempted to say that they were kind of like Turkified Indo-Iranians, initially, who in turn later became somewhat more Slavicised, first during the westward Turkic expansion, and subsequently during the eastward Slavic expansion.\n\nDon't sound very Indo-Iranian or slavicsized.\n\n\" According to Ukrainian anthropologists, Kipchaks had racial characteristics of Caucasians and Mongoloids, namely a broad flat face and protruding nose. Researcher E. P. Alekseeva drew attention to the fact that European Kipchak stone images have both Mongoloid and Caucasoid faces \"\n\n\" The results suggested that the Cumanians, as seen in the excavation at Csengele, were far from genetic homogeneity. Nevertheless, the grave artifacts are typical of the Cumanian steppe culture; and five of the six skeletons that were complete enough for anthropometric analysis appeared Asian rather than European (Horváth 1978, 2001), \""
