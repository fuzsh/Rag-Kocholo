        "text": "Cumans in English dictionary\n\nMeanings and definitions of \"Cumans\"\n\nnoun\n\nplural of [i]Cuman[/i]\n\nnoun\n\nThe Cumans were a Turkic nomadic people comprising the western branch of the Cuman-Kipchak confederation.\n\nThe Cumans were fierce and formidable nomadic warriors of the Eurasian steppe who exerted an enduring impact on the medieval Balkans\n\nmore\n\nSample sentences with \"Cumans\"\n\nDeclension Stem\n\nIn Middle East, the Cuman–Kipchak country began to be called Desht-i-Kipchak and Cumania.\n\nAfter Christian forces were defeated in the Middle East, the Order moved to Transylvania in 1211 to help defend the South-Eastern borders of the Kingdom of Hungary against the Cumans.\n\nSeeking to take advantage of that situation, Kaloyan advanced on the city and besieged it with a large force, but was murdered by his own Cuman commander Manastăr at the beginning of October 1207.\n\nAs to the actual battle itself, the chronicles report that the Polovtsy (Cumans) broke and ran without having fought and that their flight through the Russian ranks led to mass confusion and resulted in their slaughter by the Mongols.\n\nBook 14 addresses Turks, Franks, Cumans, and Manicheans (1108–1115).\n\nThis put an end to the Pecheneg threat, but in 1094 the Cumans began to raid the imperial territories in the Balkans.\n\nLater the Bulgarians confronted the advance of the Pechenegs and Cumans, and achieved a decisive victory over the Magyars, forcing them to establish themselves permanently in Pannonia.\n\nThe Byzantine army defeated the rebels, forcing Theodor-Peter and Asen to flee to the Cumans in April 1186.\n\nAfter King Béla IV of Hungary rejected Batu Khan's ultimatum to surrender the Cumans, Subutai began planning the Mongol invasion of Europe.\n\nAfter Isaac II defeated them in early 1186, Asen and Peter fled over the Danube, but they returned in the autumn, accompanied by Cuman reinforcements.\n\nBasarab's name implies that he was of Cuman or Pecheneg ancestry, but this hypothesis has not been proven.\n\nThe etymology of the Sea of Azov is popularly said to derive from a certain Cuman prince named Azum or Asuf, who was killed defending a town in this region in 1067.\n\nHowever, the Cumans plundered the Galician lands forcing Mikhail to abandon his campaign.\n\nKaloyan gave shelter to Stefan and allowed the Cumans to invade Serbia across Bulgaria.\n\nThe Vlachs, Bulgarians and Cumans resumed their raids against Byzantine territories.\n\nThe Berendei, a 12th-century nomadic Turkic people possibly related to the Cumans, seem also to have spoken Chagatai.\n\nA month later, an assembly of the prelates, barons, noblemen, and Cumans declared Ladislaus to be of age.\n\nThe Cumans were nomadic people who lived in the steppes of Eastern Europe, north of the Black Sea before the Golden Horde.\n\nCuman and Kipchak tribes joined politically to create the Cuman–Kipchak confederation.\n\nAfter centuries of fighting involving all their neighbours—the Byzantine Empire, Bulgaria, Kievan Rus', Khazaria, and the Magyars—the Pechenegs were annihilated as an independent force in 1091 at the Battle of Levounion by a combined Byzantine and Cuman army under Byzantine Emperor Alexios I Komnenos.\n\nIn the face of external danger such as Tatars, Cumans, Saracens and other pagans (omnino Tartarorum vel Cumanum Saracenum vel Meugarium) the Universitas of Romanians was called together with the other Estates of Transylvania (universisque nobilibus Ungarorum, Saxonibus, Syculis et Volachis) to defend Christian faith, according to the letter of Lodomer, Archbishop of Esztergom in 1288.\n\nHowever, despite being distracted by a Cuman attack in the Balkans, in 1148 Manuel enlisted the alliance of Conrad III of Germany, and the help of the Venetians, who quickly defeated Roger with their powerful fleet.\n\nThey fought against the Cuman army near the Ural Mountains, defeating and killing the Khan before making them pay tribute.\n\nAuthors"
