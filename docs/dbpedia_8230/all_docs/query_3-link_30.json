People of the period would refer to them by whatever generic name was most popular for steppe nomads. A lot of westerners for example still called steppe horsemen Scythians even in the middle ages.\n\nIf we're talking about racial identification, steppe hordes were often multi-ethnic, so blanket racial labels usually didn't apply. Some Cumans had east Asian features, others looked white. Same with the Huns and later various Turkic groups.\n\nJoined Jun 2014\n\n2,589 Posts | 89+\n\nVenice\n\nJun 20, 2018\n\n#3\n\nThe majority of the Steppe peopulations were Indoeuropean and so european looking, only the mongols in the far east were asiatic, then after the mongol spread out the proportions changed and intermixed with some confederations happening."
