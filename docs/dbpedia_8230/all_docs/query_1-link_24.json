        "text": "Their origins is all very confusing to me but someone should at least know happened to them. What the heck happened to them? they used be everywhere from Europe to North/West Kazakhstan now they just seem to have disappeared without a trace. Were these Kypchaks white or were they already a mixture of white/mongoloid like modern Kazakhs?\n\nFrom the descriptions they Kypchaks sounds very white and East European looking.\n\n\"It is to no surprise that while the general view of the Cumans is that they are Turanid, many historic sources describe the Cumans as strikingly handsome physically, having blond or red hair, and blue eyes. Many researchers also believe that Kipchaks were blonds and blue-eyed, descended from the Dingling, who lived in the steppes of Southern Siberia in the end of the 1st millennium BC, and who were, according to the Chinese chroniclers, blonds.[3] Kipchaks presented themselves to Russians, Poles, Germans, Hungarians, Italians and Armenians as blond people, and consequently these peoples named Kipchaks in their languages fair.\"\n\nThey inhabited what is now Cumania, they inhabited a very large chunk of Kazakhstan and from their they conquered Southern Russia, Romania, Modolva, Ukraine, Crimea, North Caucasus.\n\nA large part of their population population used to inhabit what was now northern Kazakhstan but it was later conquered by the Kazakh Khanates.\n\nKazakh Khanate ( 1456&#8211;1847 )\n\nunder Kasym Khan\n\n\" During the reign of Kasym Khan, the territories of the Kazakh Khanate expanded considerably. As Mirza Muhammad Haidar Dughlat later wrote in his Tarikh-i-Rashidi, \"Kasym Khan now brought the Dasht-i-Kipchak under his absolute control, in a manner that no one, with the exception of Jochi, had ever done before. \"\n\nModern day Kazakhstan (where the Kypchaks today? did they became Kazakh or were the exterminated?)\n\nHave you got your dates right? The 1st map says 1200 AD. But you say in your essay that the Kipchaks lived at the end of the 1st millennium BC. That would be 100 BC. That is quite a time span. I was under the impression that there was no historical record from the steppes area in 100 BC. The Alans lived in the area north of the Black sea all the way to north of the Caspian sea from 100 BC until the Huns attacked in 375 AD. Their civilization was destroyed and they fled into western Europe. They were described by the Greek historians as fair skinned with blond hair and blue eyes. The origin of the blond hair and blue eyed people is from the northwest coast of the Black sea. They have been traced to there by genetic scientists. These Kipchaks may be another people that originated at the Black sea and maybe around 1000 BC or earlier had moved far to the northeast. This is speculation, but if they were blond and blue eyed, that is where they must have come from. From the large time span you are talking about, there would be no chance of them surviving 1300 years of interbreeding."
