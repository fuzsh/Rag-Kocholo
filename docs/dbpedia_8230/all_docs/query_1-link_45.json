The confederacy became the dominant force across a territory that stretched from the Kingdom of Hungary to present day Mongolia for a period of nearly 200 hundred years. While it is not generally described as an empire and did not have centralized power structure, at its peak it was one of the larger contiguous civilizations in history.\n\nIt also served as an immediate foreshadowing for the Mongol conquests of much of the same and surrounding regions. In fact, the Cuman tribes attempted to organize some of the first resistance to the Mongol invasions of Eastern Europe and the Eurasian Steppe, often serving in the capacity of auxiliary troops to Russian Princes that mostly unsuccessfully resisted the Mongol Invasions.\n\nTo see other interesting historical maps check out:\n\nThe History of the Greeks\n\nEvery Year of the Roman Empire\n\nEvery Other Day of the Napoleonic Wars\n\nEvery Day of World War I\n\nEvery Day of World War II\n\nEveryday of World War II in the Pacific\n\nThe History of the World Every Year\n\nThe Five Largest Cities Throughout History\n\nEvery Major Plague Epidemic in History\n\nThe Evolution of Modern Government\n\nThe Rise of Religions Throughout History\n\nThe History of Communism Since 1850\n\nThe History of Urbanization\n\nThe History of South America\n\nHow the World Got Obese\n\nThe History of North America\n\nThe History of Africa\n\nThe History of China Every Year\n\nEvery Nuclear Explosion in History\n\nEvery Year in The History of the Ottoman Empire\n\nThe History of the Middle East\n\nThe Loss of Native American Lands Within the US Every Year\n\nEvery Ruler in Europe Since 400 BC\n\nEvery Day of the Korean War\n\nThe Results of Every US Presidential Election in History\n\nEvery Week of the American War of Independence\n\nThe Rise and Fall of the Mongol Empire\n\nThe Population of Every Civilization in Europe Every Year Since 400 BC\n\nThe Rise and Fall of the French Empire\n\nThe Rise and Fall of the British Empire\n\nThe Rise and Fall of the Spanish Empire\n\nThe History of the Reconquista\n\nThe History of South Asia\n\nThe Great Turkish War\n\nEvery Other Day of the Russian Civil War\n\nEvery Year in the History of the British Isles\n\nEvery European Country’s Maximum Extent\n\nThe French Invasion of Mexico\n\nEvery Ruler of Russia and Its Borders Since 880 AD\n\nThe Great Northern War\n\nThe Ancient History of the Middle East, Every Year\n\nThe Conquests of Alexander the Great, Every Month\n\nThe Rise and Fall of the Inca Empire, Every Year\n\nEvery Month of the Hundred Years’ War\n\nAncient Mesoamerica, Every Year\n\nThe Rise and Fall of the Hapsburg Dynasty\n\nEvery Year in the History of Scandinavia\n\nThe Largest Cities in North America Since 900 BC\n\nThe Rise and Fall of the Japanese Empire\n\n4,500 Years of Battles in One Time-Lapse Map\n\nEvery Year and Ruler in the History of Egypt\n\nThe Rise and Fall of the Italian Maritime Republics\n\nEvery Day of the English Civil War\n\nThe Five Largest Cities in Europe Every Year Since 1200 AD\n\nEvery Single Year in the History of Civilization in Asia\n\nEvery Year in the History of England\n\nThe Human Population for the Last 2000 Years\n\nThe Largest Empires in History\n\nEvery Other Day of the American Revolution\n\nThe History of Coins & Currency Until 1500 AD\n\nThe History of Coins & Currency – 1500 to 2019 AD\n\nThe Reconquest of Rome\n\nEvery Ten Days of the Chinese Warlord Era\n\nThe History of the EU\n\nEvery Day of the Mexican-American War\n\nThe Spread of Buddhism from 500 BC to 1200 AD\n\nThe History of the British Isles Since 100 BCE\n\nThe Spread of the Black Death\n\nUr, Babylon, and the Ancient Middle East – Every Year\n\nThe Rise and Fall of the Portuguese Empire\n\nEvery Year in the History of Armenia\n\nEvery Year in the History of the Byzantine Empire\n\nThe History of European Writing and Alphabets\n\nThe History of Christianity in Europe\n\nEvery Year in the History of Tibetan People\n\nThe Rise and Decline of Ancient Greek Religion\n\nThe Great Medieval Voyages of Exploration\n\nThe Territorial History of France\n\nEvery Day of the 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh War\n\nBarbarian Invasions and the Fall of the Western Roman Empire\n\nEvery Year of the Crusades\n\nThe Exploration of the World\n\nThe Seven Years’ War\n\nEuropean Exploration of the Pacific Ocean\n\nEvery Day of the War of 1812\n\nEvery Year in the History of Spain\n\nEvery Year of the Achaemenid Empire"
