        "text": "This article is about the historical state. For the modern Hungarian region, see Kunság.\n\nThe name Cumania originated as the Latin exonym for the Cuman–Kipchak confederation, which was a tribal confederation in the western part of the Eurasian Steppe, between the 10th and 13th centuries. The confederation was dominated by two Turkic nomadic tribes: the Cumans (also known as the Polovtsians or Folban) and the Kipchaks. Cumania was known in Islamic sources as Dasht-i Qipchaq, which means \"Steppe of the Kipchaks\"; or \"Kipchak Plains\", in Persian[1] and al-Qumāniyīn in Arabic.[2][3] Russian sources have referred to Cumania as the \"Polovtsian Steppe\" (Polovetskaia Step), or the \"Polovtsian Plain\" (Pole Polovetskoe).[4]\n\nQuick Facts Cuman–Kipchak ConfederationDasht-i Qipchaq, Status ...\n\nClose\n\nA different, more organized entity that was later known as the Golden Horde was also referred to as \"Comania\" by Armenian chronicler Hethum (Hayton) of Korykos.[5]: 38 \"Cumania\" was also the source of names, or alternate names, for several smaller areas – some of them unconnected geographically to the area of the federation – in which Cumans and/or Kipchaks settled, such as the historic region of Kunság in Hungary, and the former Diocese of Cumania (in Romania and Hungary). Hethum of Korykos described Cumania as \"wholly flat and with no trees\".[5]: 38 Ibn Battuta said of Cumania, \"This wilderness is green and grassy with no trees, nor hills, high or low ... there is no means of travelling in this desert except in wagons.\" Battuta's contemporary, Hamdallah Mustawfi, elaborated,\n\n\"This is of the Sixth Clime, its plains bear excellent pasturage ... but there are here few houses or towns or villages. Most of the inhabitants are nomads of the plain ... Most of the lands here are swamps ... The pasturage, however, being excellent, horses and cattle are numerous, and the population for the most part subsists on the produce thereof. The climate is cold, and their water comes from springs and wells.\"[5]: 40"
