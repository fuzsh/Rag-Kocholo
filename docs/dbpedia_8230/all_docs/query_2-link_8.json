        "text": "Cumania, officially the Divine Nation of Cumania, was a creative nation in the Cumania Minecraft server. As its first nation, it existed with the specific purpose of holding Spawn and Historical Zones. It was the only nation with permission to use OP. It was also briefly known as Temeria during Americana's leadership, with the period being called Cumanian Temeria to differentiate it from other Temerias.\n\nHistory[]\n\nFoundation[]\n\nCumania initially consisted of the town of Old Cumania. However, as the players there migrated and founded their own nations, Danieer, the owner of the server at the time, created the city of New Cumania to serve as a Spawn in 52 BCS. Danieer built a series of buildings in the city, notably the church, a player statue, a forge, the Bank of Cumania, a shop and a jail. A fountain park was also built by Americana.\n\nThe Temerian Period[]\n\nImmediately after Season 2 began, Americana decided to take over the administration of Cumania from Danieer. He promoted large reforms in the city, destroying most of the old buildings, except for the church and the fountain. Additionally, he terraformed the city's surrounding hills and reclaimed parts of the Cuman Sea, while building a canal to connect it to the Spartan Swamp. The only building built during this period was a temporary railway station, which was later destroyed.\n\nIn 10 ACS, Americana renamed Cumania to Temeria, in honor of his former survival nation. The city of New Cumania itself was renamed to Wyzima, and the Temerian Walls were built due to Carthage's recent conquest of nearby Brighton. However, in 12 ACS, Americana departed to found New Temeria, and the name changes were reversed. Cumania was left without an administration for the rest of Season 2 and most of Season 3. However, Americana did sporadically add more buildings, such as the shop, the conference room, the haunted house and the new railway station.\n\nComeback[]\n\nCumania had a comeback when Danieer returned to the server in 291 ACS, filling the remainder of the city with buildings such as the spawner shop, the new Bank of Cumania, the upper village, the library and the new jail. Buckeria also built the courthouse. Danieer left Cumania once again to found Zverskiy in 306 ACS.\n\nTerritory[]\n\nCumania consisted of several territories, notably after the concept of Historical Zones was introduced in Season 3.\n\nOld Cumania (53 BCS - 333 ACS)\n\nNew Cumania (52 BCS - 333 ACS)\n\nCumanian Ekros (52 BCS - 50 BCS)\n\nCumanian Shenifar (51 BCS - 50 BCS)\n\nThe Arena (45 BCS - 333 ACS)\n\nArea 56 (6 ACS - 288 ACS)\n\nArea 69 (7 ACS - 288 ACS)\n\nArchipelago Historical Zone (241 ACS - 333 ACS)\n\nAodinia Historical Zone (241 ACS - 333 ACS)\n\nNew Suceava Historical Zone (247 ACS - 333 ACS)\n\nOld Temeria Historical Zone (285 ACS - 333 ACS)\n\nPontaria Historical Zone (285 ACS - 333 ACS)\n\nThree Stars Historical Zone (288 ACS - 306 ACS; 328 ACS - 333 ACS)\n\nTingis Historical Zone (309 ACS - 333 ACS)\n\nNovigrad Historical Zone (324 ACS - 333 ACS)\n\nTemeria Historical Zone (324 ACS - 333 ACS)\n\nSodden Historical Zone (324 ACS - 333 ACS)\n\nCintra Historical Zone (324 ACS - 333 ACS)\n\nNazair Historical Zone (324 ACS - 333 ACS)\n\nTretogor Historical Zone (324 ACS - 333 ACS)\n\nNubis Historical Zone (324 ACS - 333 ACS)\n\nBattania Historical Zone (326 ACS - 333 ACS)\n\nList of Members[]"
