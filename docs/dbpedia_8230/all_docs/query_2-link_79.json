        "text": "The Cumans who remained east and south of the Carpathian Mountains established a county named Cumania, which was a strong military base in an area consisting of parts of Moldavia and Wallachia. The Hungarian kings claimed supremacy over Cumania  among the nine titles of the Hungarian kings of the Árpád and Anjou dynasties were rex Cumaniae, but few, if any, Cuman leaders recognized their overlordship, pointing to the fact that rex Cumaniae was an allegory title since the kings never fulfilled that role. The Cuman influence in Wallachia and Moldavia was very strong, according to some historians who claim that the earliest Wallachian rulers bore Cuman names (e.g. Tihomir and Bassarab). The Cumans played a crucial role in the formation of Wallachia at the end of the 14th century; many of the first Romanian nobleman were of Cuman descent. Transylvania enjoyed Cuman protection against Hungarian incursions into the Carpathians. The toponymy of the most densely populated regions of Romanian settlement shows strong evidence of Cuman traces and placenames. With a lack of convincing archaeological evidence of a Cuman civilisation, it appears the Cumans were a minority in the local population, but they made up part of the ruling élite in Wallachia.\n\nBasarab I, son of the Wallachian prince Thocomerius of Wallachia obtained independence from Hungary at the beginning of the 14th century. The dynasty was founded by the Cumans, the name meaning \"Father King\". It is generally believed by historians (Bulgarian and Hungarian) that the Bulgarian mediaеval dynasties Asen, Shishman and Terter were Cumanian. Romanian historians suggest that old chronicles indicated a Romanian origin of Asen family. Leading figures of the Terteroba clan as well as Khan Koten's relatives settled in Bulgaria\n\nA direct attack on Cumania came only in 12381239, and encountered serious resistance by various Cuman khans. The final blow came in 1241, when the Cuman control over the Pontic steppes ended and the Cuman-Kipchak confederation ceased to exist as a political entity, with the remaining Cuman tribes being dispersed, either becoming subjects and mixing with their Mongol conquerors as part of what was to be known as the Golden Horde (Kipchak Khanate) and Nogai Horde or fleeing to the west, to the Byzantine Empire, the Second Bulgarian Empire, and the Kingdom of Hungary, where they integrated into the elite and became kings and nobles with many privileges. Other Cuman captives were sent to Egypt to be sold as slaves; these slaves would go on to become Mamluks who would attain the rank of Sultan, or hold regional power as emirs or beys. Some of these Cumans, now as Mamluks, would fight the Mongols again, defeating them at the Battle of Ain Jalut and Battle of Elbistan\n\nIn the 12th and 13th century the territory around the lower reaches of the river Prut belonged to the Kingdom of the Vlacho-Bulgarians or briefly Bulgaria. Repeated attempts to expel the Cumenes from the territory failed. Only Louis the Great of Hungary (1342-82) could give an important impetus to the conquest of the territory. By campaigns of Stephan Lackfy, voivode of Transilvania, in the years 1345-46 the south could be captured. A mark was founded, the nucleus of the future state of Moldavia. In 1347, before Louis the Great departed for his Neopolitan Campaign (3 November 1347) the administration of this mark was given to a Lord of Maramureş known as Dragoş. For seven years (1347-54) Dragoş continued his campaigns within the territory and also participated in the campaigns of Louis the Great against the Cumans. He was succeeded by his son Sas. These however was chased away by the former voivode of Maramureş, Bogdan. With Bogdan the rule of the House of Musat starts in Moldavia, continuing until the beginning of the 17th centry.\n\nAfter the death of Louis the Great Poland came to his daghter Hedwig who married the Grand Duke of Lithuania. It remained a vassal state of the King of Poland until the 16th century when Poland wa srepalced by the Ottoman Empire.\n\nIn the 19th century the Ottoman Empire had to give up its suzereinty and in 1859 the Principality was united with teh Principality of Walchia into the United Principalities which became the sovereign Kingdom of Romania in 1881.\n\nThe Bull in Antiquity\n\nNarrowly connected with Moldavia is a bulls head which figures in its arms and in the crest of its rulers.\n\nThere is some evidence that the bull, and consequently a bulls head is an ancient martial symbol which was used by some rulers of Assyria and Urartu as their personal emblem.\n\nRock relief at Maltai\n\nThe best preserved of four similar panels of rock reliefs at Maltai, carved on the cliff-face on the southern side of the Dehok valley, by the road leading from Assyria to the Upper Zab valley. The assyrian king, probably Sennacherib (r. 704-681 BC), flanks a procession of seven deities (i.e. rulers or governors) on their animals, probably Aur, Mulissu, Enlil or Sîn, Nabû, ama, Adad and Itar (paying homage to him). The third vassal standing on a bull, the sixth on two bulls. In other instances these princes are symbolized by the seven stars of the Pleiades.\n\nIts meaning seems to be derived from an ancient battle order which we can see on a bronze shield of king Sarduri II (753-735 BC) of Urartu from Karmir Blur, which was recently excavated. [1] This shows a sun surrounded by three concentric rings of lions, bulls and lions. This may be a battle order of lions attacking in the outer offensive ring, the bulls defending in the middle defensive ring and lions in the central ring guarding the empire or the ruler as a royal guard.\n\nBronze shield of king Sarduri II from Karmir Blur.\n\nGreek shields on the Chigi-vase, 650-640 BC\n\nThe bulls head as a badge of rank after the Gorgoneion as a badge of the supreme commander and the eagle.\n\nBurebista (Βυρεβίστας, Βοιρεβίστας), unified the Getean and Dacian tribes for the first time and ruled them between 82 BC and 44 BC. He led raids across Central and Southeastern Europe, subjugating most of the neighbouring tribes. After his assassination in a palace coup, the empire was divided into smaller states.\n\nApart from the inscriptions on the Sinaia Tablets and on his seal only three ancient sources on Burebista survive: Strabo: Geographica 7.3.5, 7.3.11 and 16.2.39 (who spells his name Byrebistas and Boirebistas); Jordanes: Getica 67 (spells his name Buruista); and a marble inscription found in Balchik, Bulgaria (now found at the National Museum in Sofia) which represents a decree by the citizens of Dionysopolis about Akornion\n\nA bulls head in connection with the Kingdom of Dacia, is documented by the so-called tablets of Sinaia.\n\nÆ Like some other ancient societies there seems to have been three ranges of authority in Dacia. Such ranges of authority are for example known from ancient Athens where they were headed by the three archonts of the έπωνυμος (eponemos), giving his name to the year, the βαςιλευς (basileus) the High priest, and the πολεμαρχος (polemarchos) the supreme commander. On the tablet below the symbols of such archonts or state officials in Dacian society may have been represented. The tablet is a part of the socalled Lead Plates of Sinaia the origin of which is not without any doubt. [2] For a part these are described in a recent study by Stefanoski-Al Dabija. [3]\n\nWe may assume that the central figure represents the Dacian ruler with the badge of his office, a crown crested with a ball. On his breast are a moon, symbol of the state, and a sun, symbol of the realm or the Dacian Empire. On the left of him, (the dexter side) is a stand supporting a bulls head, its legs intertwined with a serpent. This we may assume, is the symbol of the supreme commander as a bulls head may be the symbol of a commander of the defenders of the second line (borrowed probably from the battle array of ancient Urartu and Persia.) [4]\n\nOn the right (sinister) is a figure consisting of a long haired face with a Janus Head. This, we may assume, is the emblem of the high priest (Basileus).\n\nThe arms of the principality of Moldavia are a bulls head with a star between its horns between a rose and a crescent.\n\nAfter an odd millennium the bulls head occurs again in a European south eastern context.\n\nBulls heads are on a coin of Nicholas I Lacković (lackfi Miklós), who was Ban of Slavonia (134243), and Voivode of Transylvania (13671369).\n\nCoin of Louis the Great (1342-82), 1365ca.\n\nObv.: Marten running to the right and above it a crown, below a cloverleaf. The inscription reads: MONETA NICOLAI BAN. NI.\n\nRev.: Double cross, between two crescents in chief and two bulls heads with a cross between the horns in base.\n\nThe bulls head however is ascribed by medieval chroniclers to Dragoş who was a voivode in Moldavia (1345/1359 -1353/1361) and, according to legend, had hunted an aurochs or bison, ending with his \"dismounting\" by the Moldova River, which gave rise to the development of Moldavia. The Anonymous Chronicle of Moldavia contains a short summary: \"In the year 6867 Dragoș Voivode came from the Hungarian country, from Maramureș, hunting an aurochs ...\". The Moldo-Polish Chronicle preserved a more detailed story: \"By the will of God, the first voivode, Dragoș, came from the Hungarian country from the town and river of [Maramureș], hunting an aurochs which he killed on the river Moldova. There he feasted with his noblemen, and liking the country he remained there, bringing [Vlachs] from Hungary as colonists.\n\nHowever, many historians (including Ștefan S. Gorovei, Dennis Deletant, Neagu Djuvara, and Constantine Rezachevici) say that a successful Hungarian campaign under the command of Andrew Lackfi, Count of the Székelys, against the Tatars across the Carpathians in 1345 gave rise to the development of a defensive march, ruled by Dragoș. According to Deletant, the establishment of that border province was connected to the foundation of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Milkovia, which was sanctioned, upon the request of Louis I of Hungary, by Pope Clement VI on 27 March 1347[6]\n\nAs we are of the opinion that the bulls head is a badge of the commander of a defense force we may conclude that Dragoş adopted (or was granted by Louis the Great) a bulls head as his badge of office in his quaility of a commander of the Hungarian defence forces.\n\nThe bulls head was represented for the first time as a crest together with the arms of Peter I Muşat (1375-91). It has remained the crest of all rulers of Moldavia from the House of Muşat.\n\nCoin of Peter I Muşat with the bulls head crest\n\nSoon, or at the same time, the bulls head was placed on a shield, making the coat of arms of Moldavia.\n\nThe star, crescent and rose are the emblem of a prince, the Hungarian State and the Hungarian Empire, the crescent and sun earlier on the seal of King Andrew II (1223) and, as we have see, on a Dacian tablet.\n\nThe arms are represented for the first time on a seal of Peter Musat attached to his act of submission to Vladislav Jagiello of 1387. This seal is nowadays in the Polish archives but no representation is available.[7]\n\nSeal of Roman I, 30.03.1392\n\nPrincipality and Kingdom (1859-1947)\n\nIn 1859, Moldavia rallied with Wallachia into the United Principalities. The first ruler was Alexander John Cuza (1859-'66). In the first arms of his government the bull´s head was on a by the now customary red over blue shield. In the coats of arms quarterly from the end of his reign, the bull´s head is on a red field. For the Bucovina a coat of arms was adopted in the meantime being parted per pale of blue and red charged with a black bull´s head between three golden six/pointed stars.\n\nIn the princely arms quarterly of Charles I the arrangement of blue over red is retained. The bull´s head is on a blue field in the second quarter and on a red field in the third,\n\nDown from 1872, the bull´s head is finally on a red field. Six years later, the Bessarabia Governorate came to use the now vacant blue field, surrounded by a checkered bordure of the colors of the Russian flag. The final distribution of the colors was now a blue and red shield for the Austrian part, for the Romanian part a red shield, and a blue shield for the Russian part.\n\nIn the meantime, the bulls head, by the way often depicted in the first half of the 19th century as a bison´s head (Bison Bonasus, Bovidæ), depending of the colour of the field in the natural color (proper), gold (Or) or silver (Argent). In the version of the state coat of arms of 1921, he finally is of the natural color with a golden six-pointed star between the horns, and accompanied by a golden sun and crescent.\n\nIn the last years of the reign of Charles II, Moldavia was divided into three provinces: Dunarea de Jos, Prut and, in Bessarabia, Nistrul. The arms of Dunarea de Jos barry of ten pieces of blue and red and a silver bend wavy. The arms of Prut was chequy of nine pieces of red and silver, the silver pieces charged with a black bull´s head. For Nistrul province see the entry on Moldovan Republic."
