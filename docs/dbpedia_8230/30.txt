As part of our ongoing series featuring historical video-maps from around the web, we present ‘The History of Cumania,’ by YouTube creator Great History Mapper.

Little known today, Cumania, also known as the Cuman–Kipchak Confederation, was a confederation of nomadic tribes from the Eurasian step that swept across Central Asia and South-Eastern Europe during the Middle Ages. The confederacy became the dominant force across a territory that stretched from the Kingdom of Hungary to present day Mongolia for a period of nearly 200 hundred years. While it is not generally described as an empire and did not have centralized power structure, at its peak it was one of the larger contiguous civilizations in history.

It also served as an immediate foreshadowing for the Mongol conquests of much of the same and surrounding regions. In fact, the Cuman tribes attempted to organize some of the first resistance to the Mongol invasions of Eastern Europe and the Eurasian Steppe, often serving in the capacity of auxiliary troops to Russian Princes that mostly unsuccessfully resisted the Mongol Invasions.
