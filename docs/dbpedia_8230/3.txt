Cumania, officially the Divine Nation of Cumania, was a creative nation in the Cumania Minecraft server. As its first nation, it existed with the specific purpose of holding Spawn and Historical Zones. It was the only nation with permission to use OP. It was also briefly known as Temeria during Americana's leadership, with the period being called Cumanian Temeria to differentiate it from other Temerias.

History[]

Foundation[]

Cumania initially consisted of the town of Old Cumania. However, as the players there migrated and founded their own nations, Danieer, the owner of the server at the time, created the city of New Cumania to serve as a Spawn in 52 BCS. Danieer built a series of buildings in the city, notably the church, a player statue, a forge, the Bank of Cumania, a shop and a jail. A fountain park was also built by Americana.

The Temerian Period[]

Immediately after Season 2 began, Americana decided to take over the administration of Cumania from Danieer. He promoted large reforms in the city, destroying most of the old buildings, except for the church and the fountain. Additionally, he terraformed the city's surrounding hills and reclaimed parts of the Cuman Sea, while building a canal to connect it to the Spartan Swamp. The only building built during this period was a temporary railway station, which was later destroyed.

In 10 ACS, Americana renamed Cumania to Temeria, in honor of his former survival nation. The city of New Cumania itself was renamed to Wyzima, and the Temerian Walls were built due to Carthage's recent conquest of nearby Brighton. However, in 12 ACS, Americana departed to found New Temeria, and the name changes were reversed. Cumania was left without an administration for the rest of Season 2 and most of Season 3. However, Americana did sporadically add more buildings, such as the shop, the conference room, the haunted house and the new railway station.

Comeback[]

Cumania had a comeback when Danieer returned to the server in 291 ACS, filling the remainder of the city with buildings such as the spawner shop, the new Bank of Cumania, the upper village, the library and the new jail. Buckeria also built the courthouse. Danieer left Cumania once again to found Zverskiy in 306 ACS.
