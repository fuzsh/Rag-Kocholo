They got a campus all around the world. And I feel like I always had that passion to like, to travel. So Webster was it's perfect for me because I'm a big travel fan. And that's one of the reason why I joined Webster first.\n\nText on screen: Marko Torres — International Student\n\nMarko Torres: I chose Webster because many of my classmates in high school wanted to come here as well because they were from different countries, so I thought that my coming here, there were going to be a lot of people that share the same view that I did regarding, you know, diversity.\n\nText on screen: What support has Webster University given you as an International Student that you value?\n\nText on screen: Erika Gavilanes — International Student\n\nErika Gavilanes: All the support that Webster has given me going from the very first day, picking me up at the airport, and then all the opportunities, like the job opportunities that it has. Until I came to be a grad assistant, they gave me a scholarship. I was able to enroll that way in my second master's degree and a grad certificate because I took advantage of the money that Webster granted me. And finally, while COVID has what's happening, I did feel all the support from my professors, staff, faculty, advisors, counseling. It was just feeling like home away from home.\n\nTorres: Right, so, I got a lot of support from my advisor. So professors, they were helping me out by giving me accommodations whenever I needed them for tests or homework. And I thought that was pretty cool.\n\nText on screen: What advice would you give to an international student to attend Webster University?\n\nPondi: The first thing I would tell him to like, be open minded because Webster has like a lot of different people from all around the world. So he needs to have like that mindset to be like, to have like a very open mindset because he's going to have a lot of different perspective. And I think that's just very beautiful about Webster, you know? Yeah, having all those people from China, from Asia, from Europe does is beautiful. The first advice would be to be very open minded about things.\n\nTorres: Well, first of all, I would tell them that it is a good idea to come to Webster because you'll get a lot of support from everybody. Everybody is nice to you in here. You know, there's feel welcome here. There's no barriers, you know, at Webster and, oh, and Webster are always welcome you in here\n\nText on screen: Why do you think other International students could benefit from attending Webster University?\n\nGavilanes: For me, the main reason you should come to Webster is you of course, are like whenever you're looking for education, you have many options. Is the ones I have. I remember I had options in Illinois, Washington, here and there… like, a lot.\n\nBut definitely I feel what attracted to me the most and what I feel will attract to everyone the most is how diverse is Webster, because coming from another country is difficult. You -- you don't always feel like you're going to be accepted or, you know, but if you really want to get a place where you will feel welcome, Webster is definitely that place.\n\nPondi: The first beautiful thing about Webster, for me, the most thing is the study abroad opportunities, but other than that, I feel like the faculties are in Webster is just amazing because like the small class sizes make it, like, better for, like, for like you to be closer to lecturers and have like those like one-on-one sessions. If you don't really understand something, you can actually go to your lecturers and talk to him about it. And I feel like that's, that's something that's really amazing about it.\n\nYeah, that's I would, I would say St. Louis is one of my favorite place because I feel like people just love it and I would just want to encourage everyone to like, grab the opportunity to just study. And if you can go abroad, you should definitely embrace it because Webster is perfect for that, it is a perfect environment for that. And I feel like as a student, if you had the opportunity to travel and to study, that's just perfect. Yeah."
