Because Mr. Jackson was committed to helping students find their career path and complete college, the College of Arts and Sciences proposes that the $25,000 gift from the Fourjay Foundation be used for undeclared majors who enroll through the College of Arts and Sciences.\n\nGabriel Endowed Scholarship\n\nThe recipients must be enrolled as full-time students at Oklahoma State University and may be classified at either the undergraduate or graduate level.
