        "text": "Herbert G. Donnerhack, 93, and Audrey W. Donnerhack, 88, of Mahwah, NJ (formerly Franklin Lakes, NJ, and Ramsey, NJ) passed into their eternal home days apart. Herb, on Thursday, March 28, 2024, and Audrey, on Tuesday, April 2, 2024. Herb and Audrey were comforted and loved by their family, personal aides, and friends who came to visit in their final days, hours, and minutes. While their decline was noticeable over the past few months, it is never easy to say good-bye.\n\nHerb was born on August 20, 1930. He was a graduate of Garfield High School, attended Packard Junior college, and put himself through night-school at Fairleigh Dickinson University to graduate with a bachelor’s degree in accounting. Herb was a “numbers” kinda guy, even at a young age.\n\nHe was an accountant at Theordore Klemens, General Electric, and General Foods in White Plains, NY and after a company merger, went on to lead the Federal Tax Department at Philip Morris in Rye, NY before retiring in 1993. He traveled the highways and byways in several consecutively purchased light blue Volkswagen Beetles because they were “good on gas mileage.” Herb also served in the National Guard Reserve in the early to mid-50’s.\n\nAudrey was born on October 13, 1935. She grew up in Nutley, NJ, and was a graduate of Nutley High School. While she worked for Public Service, she was introduced to a really nice, soon-to-be accountant. Audrey married the love of her life in June of 1956. She was fulfilling her dream of becoming a wife, and soon a mother.\n\nHerb and Audrey were savers and worked hard to save up to buy their first home on Momar Drive in Ramsey, NJ. A son and then a daughter rounded out the family of four. They eventually moved to Dogwood Terrace in Ramsey, NJ where Herb and Audrey were so proud of their next new home. Herb took pride in his lawn (occasionally freaked out when his daughter blew cute, fuzzy dandelion seeds around and his son used his yard as a motocross course), kept his gutters clean, and worked outside year-round collecting, chopping, and stacking firewood for the fireplace. Audrey worked hard as a stay-at-home mother, sewed beautiful clothing, and tried her best to raise her children in a good Christian home. In 1975, Audrey took a job at Sealfons in Ridgewood, NJ; eventually becoming Asst. Buyer of Lingerie and Buyer of Maternity departments. She didn’t ever mind sitting on bleachers during cold band competitions or watching her kids play tennis and run track and field events. Cold nights were spent in front of the fire, watching tv, roasting chestnuts, listening to Herb Alpert and the Tijuana Brass, and playing tennis-ball soccer in the living room with the kids. Audrey would spend the evening hours doing cross-stitch or needlepoint. Herb was an avid tennis player, taught his kids to play, and enjoyed playing into his early 80’s.\n\nHerb and Audrey traveled in their retirement years, loving coastal Maine and warmer winters in Hilton Head Island, as well as thoroughly enjoying many cruises to different tropical ports. Their marriage was held together by a strong commitment to honor their vows and a great deal of teasing on Herb’s part. He knew just how far to irk her and got a kick out of it, maybe Audrey secretly did too. Herb and Audrey were dedicated members of Second Reformed Church, now known as Abundant Life Reformed Church in Wyckoff, NJ. Audrey loved her church family, enjoyed her circle meetings, and Herb was a pillar of the church community. He was respected and appreciated for his good sense of numbers, his mild manner and witty humor. The retired couple also enjoyed trips to see their grandchildren, family BBQ’s and afternoon trips to Starbucks and Barnes & Noble for the latest novels. Herb loved the NY Mets and Jets so much he’s probably in heaven trying to talk up a World Series win for the Mets and a Jets win at the Super Bowl! Audrey is probably telling him to give it up.\n\nAudrey always said what a numbers guy Herb was, through and through. Dutifully paid his taxes, consistently balanced his checkbook, and berated his wife for the checkbook being off by a penny.\n\nAs dementia slowly took over, Herb never lost his sassy humor. Audrey’s love of fine clothing and her weekly trip to the beauty parlor made her look and feel good. She took pride in her appearance right up to her death. Audrey and Herb will be dearly missed by friends and especially their two children, Scott Donnerhack of South Haven, MI, and Ruth Ferraro, their son in-law David Ferraro, their four grandchildren, Nicholas Ferraro, Julia Ferraro, of Oakland, NJ. Benjamin Donnerhack of Holland, MI, and Cassidy Donnerhack of Zeeland, MI. Herb is predeceased by his parents, Fritz and Carola, his twin brother Ralph, and his sister Evelyn. Audrey is predeceased by her parents Earl, and Mildred Wheatley.\n\nThe family welcomes family and friends for visitation at Abundant Life Reformed Church, 475 Lafayette Avenue, Wyckoff, NJ on Sunday, April 28, 2024, from 2 - 4pm and a Memorial Service immediately following the visitation.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, the family is requesting donations to be made to the Herb and Audrey Donnerhack Memorial Fund and sent to Abundant Life Reformed Church 475 Lafayette Avenue, Wyckoff, NJ 07481."
