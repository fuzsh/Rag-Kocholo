Sing his praise\n\nWithout delayes,\n\nWho takes thee by the hand, that thou likewise\n\nWith him mayst rise :\n\nThat, as his death calcined thee to dust,\n\nHis life may make thee gold, and much more just.\n\nAwake, my lute, and struggle for thy part\n\nWith all thy art.\n\nThe crosse taught all wood to resound his name\n\nWho bore the same.\n\nHis stretched sinews taught all strings, what key\n\nIs best to celebrate this most high day.\n\nConsort both heart and lute, and twist a song\n\nPleasant and long :\n\nOr since all music is but three parts vied,\n\nAnd multiplied ;\n\nO let thy blessed Spirit bear a part,\n\nAnd make up our defects with his sweet art.\n\nI got me flowers to straw thy way ;\n\nI got me boughs off many a tree :\n\nBut thou wast up by break of day,\n\nAnd broughtâst thy sweets along with thee.\n\nThe Sunne arising in the East,\n\nThough he give light, and thâ East perfume ;\n\nIf they should offer to contest\n\nWith thy arising, they presume.\n\nCan there be any day but this,\n\nThough many sunnes to shine endeavour ?\n\nWe count three hundred, but we misse :\n\nThere is but one, and that one ever.\n\n—George Herbert, Easter first published in The Temple (1633) from The Poetical Works of George Herbert pp. 236-38 (1857).\n\nThis is a complex poem, in two parts, and there is good reason to believe that the second, less formal part is actually intended to be sung to the accompaniment of a lute. George Herbert, in any event, was an accomplished lutenist and a great fan of the works of John Dowland. If that is so, then Dowland’s The Most Sacred Queen Elizabeth, Her Galliard (from Varietie of Lute Lessons (1610) prepared by his son Robert Dowland) perfectly matches the meter and rhyme scheme of this poem and may well have been intended as the music to which it was to have been sung.\n\nThe first part of the poem is, however, more dramatic and triumphant. Herbert invokes his lute, but the words call for more of an orchestral setting. Listen to a performance of Johann Sebastian Bach’s Cantata “Der Himmel lacht!, die Erde jubilieret” composed for Easter Sunday, BWV 31 (ca. 1715), in a performance by The Amsterdam Baroque Orchestra & Choir, Ton Koopman, conductor:"
