        "text": "By Rick Miller\n\n\"You can't tell the players without a program!\" the stadium hawkers used to shout as they strode up and down the stairs between the rows of seats. That saying applies in spades to stamp collecting, which is what keeps postage stamp catalog publishers in business.\n\nSpeaking metaphorically, the stamps are the players and the catalog is the program. But it turns out that you also need a program for the catalog.\n\nThe Scott catalog numbering system didn't spring fullblown from the mind of J. Walter Scott as Athena sprang from Zeus' brow in Greek mythology. Scott himself possibly never assigned any Scott numbers, although it is likely that he did.\n\nThe numbering system is a slowly evolving accretion, not unlike a coral reef. It is the work of many minds over 136 years and counting.\n\nAt first the stamps listed by Scott did not have catalog numbers. They were listed by country, denomination, year of issue and color, with a few illustrations of what some of the stamps looked like.\n\nAs the number and types of stamps being issued grew, the need for greater organization became apparent. The 48th edition of the Scott catalog, issued circa 1887, was the first to assign catalog numbers to stamps.\n\nIn the U.S. stamps section, the postmasters' provisionals and the general-issue regular postage stamps were numbered sequentially in chronological order.\n\nU.S. carrier stamps, special delivery stamps, newspaper stamps, postage due stamps, postal stationery cut squares, Official stamps, Official cut squares, telegraph stamps, local stamps and revenue stamps followed, numbered sequentially, but with gaps between the numbers of each group.\n\nFor example, the last United States postage stamp listed in the 48th edition was the 4¢ green Andrew Jackson stamp of 1883, which was listed as No. 97. The next stamp listed in the 48th edition is a 1¢ black on rose carrier stamp of 1849 listed as No. 150.\n\nToday the 4¢ Jackson stamp is listed as U.S. Scott 211, and the 1¢ carrier stamp is listed as U.S. Scott 6LB9.\n\nThe practice of listing regular postage stamps first, with all other types of stamps and stationery following, is the source of the phrase \"back-of-the-book.\"\n\nThe limitations of this system are readily apparent. Once enough stamps have been issued to use up unassigned numbers between the different groups of stamps, all of the back-of-the-book stamps have to be renumbered with higher numbers and bigger gaps between the groups.\n\nThis the Scott catalog editors dutifully proceeded to do periodically. The havoc wrought on dealers' inventories and collectors' collections with each successive renumbering must have been substantial.\n\nFor example, the 1¢ yellow Benjamin Franklin Department of Agriculture Official stamp, now listed as U.S. Scott O1 and shown in Figure 1, was listed as No. 501 in the 48th edition of the catalog, as No. 801 in the 52nd edition; as No. 593 in the 1900 edition; as No. 500 in the 1915 edition; and as No. 1500 from 1920 to 1939.\n\nMercifully, in the 96th edition of the catalog published in 1940, the present Scott system of catalog numbers with prefixes and suffixes was adopted.\n\nIn 1940, Scott renumbered all back-of-the-book stamps discretely to their own groups and assigned one or more letters as prefixes to indicate the type of stamp. For example the prefix \"B\" was for semipostal stamps, \"C\" was for airmail stamps and \"J\" was postage due stamps.\n\nThere are alternatives to the Scott prefix-suffix system. For example, some catalogs number all stamps with any kind of postal connection chronologically and sequentially without regard to their use. Others separate the different types of stamps into groups and number all stamps within each group discretely starting from No. 1, but without prefixes.\n\nThe Scott system has advantages. Unlike straight sequential numbering, a Scott catalog number instantly tells you what kind of stamp you are dealing with.\n\nAn advantage over nonprefixed discrete numbering is that you don't have to say the name of the group when you give the catalog number. Instead of saying or writing, for example, \"Great Britain postage due stamp No. 23,\" you can just say or write \"Great Britain J23.\"\n\nThe disadvantage to the system is that, as more and more types of stamps were issued, more and more prefixes were needed.\n\nWhile the average collector can probably remember the meaning of the \"B,\" \"C,\" \"E,\" \"J,\" \"N\" and \"O\" prefixes, and perhaps a few others, no one who is not equipped with a photographic memory can remember them all.\n\nThe three tables shown with this article are a program for the Scott catalog system of prefixes and suffixes. The list is as comprehensive as I could make it, compiled from a number of sources, none of which is complete.\n\nThe Scott Specialized Catalogue of United States Stamps and Covers provides a fairly comprehensive listing in its introduction of all prefixes and suffixes used with U.S. stamps. The introduction to the Scott Standard Postage Stamp Catalogue, however, lists only 40 of the more commonly used prefixes.\n\nThe first table at right contains prefixes and suffixes used for all types of postage stamps and telegraph stamps and for related postal items listed in the Scott catalog, such as international reply coupons, postage currency and souvenir pages.\n\nThe second table contains postal stationery prefixes.\n\nThe third table contains revenue stamp prefixes.\n\nBecause the system of prefixes evolved over a long period of time and is the work of many different editors, the prefixes are not always consistent. Some letters are used to mean more than one thing, and some mean different things in different country listings. For example \"PR\" is the prefix for newspaper tax stamps, except in the U.S. listings, where it is the prefix for newspaper stamps.\n\nMost offices-abroad stamps are discretely numbered without a prefix, except for those of Poland and the United States, which are prefixed by the letter \"K.\" Government-in-exile stamps of Poland and Yugoslavia are also prefixed with the letter \"K.\"\n\n\"LB\" denotes a local semipostal stamp and \"LO\" denotes a local Official stamp, except in the U.S. listings where \"LB\" denotes a carrier semiofficial stamp and \"LO\" denotes a carrier Official stamp.\n\nAnother idiosyncracy of the Scott catalogs is that, although this elaborate system of prefixes exists, Scott editors haven't always used them.\n\nWhen a semipostal stamp or an airmail stamp is part of a set that includes regular postage stamps, the semipostal or airmail is sometimes listed as part of the set without a prefix in the regular postage listing.\n\nFor example, Italy Scott 239-41 commemorating the marriage of Prince Humbert of Savoy to Princess Marie Jose of Belgium comprises one regular postage stamp and two semipostal stamps, yet they all are listed as a set with unprefixed numbers in the regular postage section of the catalog.\n\nSome of the prefixes, it seems, apply to only a single stamp. For example, I believe that the 15-peso green President J.J. Prieto V. parcel post postal tax stamp, Chile Scott QRA1, shown in Figure 2, is the only stamp in the entire catalog with this prefix.\n\nOf course, if any country ever does issue another parcel post postal tax stamp, the \"QRA\" prefix is standing by ready for use."
