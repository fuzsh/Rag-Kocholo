        "text": "The Bushes and the Walkers\n\nO, had thy grandsire with a prophet’s eye Seen how his son’s son should destroy his sons, From forth thy reach he would have laid thy shame, Deposing thee before thou wert possess’d Which art possess’d now to depose thyself. —Richard II\n\nGeorge Walker Bush is the product of two family traditions, the Bushes and the Walkers. On one side is the familiar patriarch Prescott Bush (1895–1972), the decorous Republican senator from Connecticut, the New England WASP, the pennant-waving Yale man. On the other side of his father’s family stands a lesser-known patriarch, George Herbert Walker (1875–1953), the St. Louis buccaneer and raucous playboy.\n\nThe Bushes as we know them today are the product of a combination of — one might say the combustion between — the two very different families arrayed around these two dominant men. Because the family is private to the point of being obsessively secretive, its basic internal struggle has been largely obscured in favor of a familiar cliché: the old American upper class. But this isn’t the story of a happy, unified family. Drilling into the history of the Walkers and the Bushes, one hits layer upon sedimentary layer of conflict among brothers, cousins, uncles, and grandparents. The buried drama and forgotten ancestors are the beginning point for understanding George W. Bush, the roots of whose temperament are not as shallow as they appear.\n\nSuperficially, the Walkers and Bushes had much in common when they came together just after the First World War. Both families represented industrial fortunes from the Midwest transplanted into East Coast finance. Both were fanatical about sports and ferociously competitive, sharing a passion for baseball, golf, and tennis. Both came to worship side by side at Christ Church in Greenwich, Connecticut, and at St. Ann’s in Kennebunkport, Maine, where George H. W. Bush’s parents, Prescott Bush and Dorothy Walker (1901–1992), were married in 1921. Endless connections to Yale, Skull and Bones, and the Harriman banking enterprises run through both families.\n\nYet an enormous amount is papered over by the simplification that George H. W. Bush was raised a Connecticut Yankee. The union of Prescott Bush and Dorothy Walker represented less a merger of equals than a crossing of lines: old fortune and new, Protestant and Catholic, Republican and Democrat. Prescott Bush descended from New England abolitionists. Dorothy Walker came from a Maryland family that owned slaves — a family secret that has been previously reported only in a small paper published in Springfield, Illinois. The more noticeable differences were resolved with relative ease. Both families soon became thoroughly Episcopal and Republican, and money ages quickly in America. But there endured a less visible conflict over attitudes, beliefs, and principles.\n\nTo put it simply, the value system of the original patriarch, George W.’s great-grandfather George Herbert Walker, was based on the pursuit of wealth. The one embodied by George W.’s grandfather Prescott Bush was an ethical ideal. The ramifications of this divergence were infinite and insurmountable. The Walkers behaved like the worst nouveaux riches: they were grand, greedy, extravagant, and focused on class distinctions. Prescott Bush’s clan was pointedly modest, frugal, and egalitarian. George Herbert Walker’s world was one of yachts, racehorses, estates, and servants. Prescott Bush couldn’t abide a yacht, was uncomfortable at clubs, and hated formal dinners, preferring the modestly genteel lifestyle of a suburban commuter. His social life was the Whiffenpoofs, the Greenwich town council, and golf.\n\nThe Walkers were gamblers; the Bushes conservators. The Walkers pursued winning and success; the Bushes sought to serve and lead. The Walkers viewed wealth as an end; the Bushes as a means. The Bushes embodied the old WASP embarrassment about being rich; they pretended they really weren’t, and treated the help as “family.” As Richard Ben Cramer puts it in What It Takes, whose early chapters contain the most insightful writing about them, the Bushes were known in Greenwich as being “not like that” — not the sort of people who lorded their wealth or station over their social and economic inferiors. Biographers find no shortage of tales of the early George H. W. Bush’s egalitarian decency; how he stood up for a Jewish kid being bullied at Andover, how he bonded with the enlisted men on his boat during World War II, how in Congress he wrote personal letters to crotchety constituents, turning them into devoted friends.\n\nCounter-snobbery can be a more highly evolved snobbery. In the Bush family, downplaying social superiority is a subtle way to hold it over those who advertise their class — people like the boorish George Herbert Walker and his sons. George H. W. Bush’s exaggeratedly considerate and self-effacing behavior is typically attributed to his mother, Dorothy, who was George Herbert Walker’s daughter. But in this, Dotty Walker was a defector from her father’s family to her husband’s. She rejected the egoistic, mercantile values of George Herbert Walker and absorbed her husband, Prescott’s, asceticism, rectitude, and sense of duty. The admirable, sometimes hyperbolic selflessness she passed on to her children represented a transfer of loyalties and ultimately a shift in the Walker-Bush balance of power.\n\nIn the battle of the two patriarchs, Prescott might, until fairly recently, have been thought the winner. The first Bush presidency expressed Prescott’s ethic of self-restraint and public service, not the Walker ethic of masculine risk-taking, conquest, and domination. The Bush name became famous around the world; the Walker name was absorbed. Even Walker’s Point, George Herbert Walker’s summer haven in Kennebunkport, and a place that Prescott Bush found too unpleasant to visit in the 1950s because of his feelings toward his in-laws, was assumed to be the ancestral manse of George H. W. Bush’s Yankee ancestors. But the struggle in which the Bush victory was achieved left some rogue DNA. George W. Bush’s likeness to some of his Walker ancestors offers a conspicuous display of the phenomenon sociologists call intergenerational rootedness — the curious persistence of family patterns over long spans of time. While George H. W. Bush is Prescott’s son, George W. Bush is in many respects his great-grandfather’s. He is more Walker than Bush.\n\nBush parsimony meets Walker egotism in the practice of recycling an insufficient number of names among an excessive number of male heirs. The result is a profusion of Samuels, Georges, Herberts, Johns, Walkers, and Prescotts, applied as first, second, third, and fourth names — an exploding blob of WASP nomenclature that deters comprehension. The older George Bush, the forty-first president, had always been known growing up as “Poppy” or “Pop,” a diminutive of “little Pop,” to distinguish him from what the family called his namesake and grandfather, George Herbert Walker. Bush avoided this preppie moniker in the Navy, where his nickname became his actual name, “George Herbert Walker Bush,” played out to mock his upperclass breeding and manners. At Yale he reverted to Poppy, which he remained to his family. On oil rigs, he was just plain George. When Poppy named his first son after himself but not quite, he compounded the confusion. Growing up, his son was known as Little George, Georgie, George Junior, and Junior, which was how he was known to friends at college. As his political career took form in Texas, he eschewed all versions of Junior, embracing “George W.” or merely “W” (pronounced “Dubya”). Only when he became president did he reclaim the name “George Bush,” relegating his father to the status of “41,” “George H. W. Bush,” or “Bush Senior.” Given how confusing the men’s names are, one can only be thankful that W. had daughters.\n\nHaving an ordinary three names instead of a pretentious four helps to answer the implication George W. Bush most resents, that he arrived in the White House with the help of such un-American principles as primogeniture, dynasty, and aristocracy. Though he can hardly cultivate a log cabin myth, this Bush has long thought of himself as a Texan rather than a New Englander, an entrepreneur rather than a beneficiary of inherited wealth, and the opposite of any kind of snob. Distinctions he draws with his preppie father are central to his personal and political identity.\n\nGeorge H. W. Bush struck a Texan pose as well, with far less success. Former President Bush mainly set himself up for ridicule when he professed a love for country music and pork rinds or when he claimed that he didn’t know what the word “patrician” meant. In truth, Bush embodied the easily parodied but much admired WASP type as thoroughly as any man of his generation, not just its taste and manners, but the ideals and moral vision of the old New England upper class. He wore Brooks Brothers and believed in duty to country. He was a skinflint who wrestled with his conscience. He personified good sportsmanship and drizzled thank-you notes. These preppie folkways made George H. W. Bush’s Texan mask comically transparent.\n\nNot so his son, on whom Kennebunkport, Andover, Yale, and Harvard left few visible traces. Through his manners, tastes, and beliefs, George W. Bush places himself about as far as it is possible to get from his New England patrimony. He shows no sign of thinking or caring much about his ancestry, never discusses it in public, and seems not even to know much about it. He displays a brash informality and sometimes outright rudeness, kicking his cowboy boots up on the desk, swearing lustily, and holding garrulous phone conversations while visitors sit awkwardly in his office. His idea of relaxation is clearing brush in sweltering, landlocked Midland; fine dining a hamburger and a Coke. George W. seems entirely genuine when he explains in his West Texan twang that his values were formed in forthright (and never mind segregated) Midland, and that his relationship with God is expressive, not Episcopalian. To call this persona a conscious construction is not to say it is artificial. The president’s Texan identity was forged in necessary opposition; it represents his attempt to assert himself as an original theme and not a familial variation.\n\nGeorge W. Bush’s middle name comes from a large Catholic family resident in Maryland from the early nineteenth century. The family of George E. Walker (1797–1864) was poor, but not so poor that it didn’t have a couple of slaves on its 321-acre farm in Cecil County, Maryland, according to an 1830 census — a female between the ages of ten and twenty-four, and a male between the ages of twenty-four and thirty-six. After they fell on hard times and lost their land, the Walkers traveled by wagon to southern Illinois, where they homesteaded a few miles from Bloomington.\n\nThe youngest of their eight sons, David Davis Walker (1840–1918), moved to St. Louis where he made his fortune as a dry goods wholesaler. In the Midwest, David Walker maintained the Southern attitude about race, though with a contemporary overlay of social Darwinism. He was a believer in eugenics and the “unwritten law” of lynching. In a letter to the editor of the St. Louis Republic published in 1914, David Walker described Negroes as a greater menace than prostitution and “all the other evils combined.”\n\nDavid Walker’s son George Herbert Walker, born in St. Louis in 1875, was raised like a Midwestern prince. Bert Walker, as he was known, had both a nurse and his own valet. In the summer, the family would travel by private train car to the coast of Maine. The valet went with Bert to Stonyhurst, the Jesuit boarding school in England, where his mother sent him, out of concern that Catholic education in St. Louis was too dominated by ill-bred German immigrants.\n\nIn England, Bert Walker developed into a physically powerful young man, excelling at boxing, polo, and golf. He would later win the amateur title as Missouri heavyweight champion in the days when boxers wore no gloves. Much of his overflowing aggression was directed at his father. Rather than join the family business or the priest- hood as his parents hoped, he returned to St. Louis to make his own fortune. Though he stayed in the same city, he broke with his parents in every other way, rejecting his father’s Republican politics and his Catholic faith. This rupture came when he decided to marry a girl from a higher-class Presbyterian family, a society beauty named Lucretia “Loulie” Wear (1874–1961). Bert’s parents told him he would be disinherited and boycotted the wedding. Though father and son were later partners in investments, including the house in Kennebunkport, the breach between them was never fully mended. Years later, Bert sued to have his father declared mentally unfit when David Walker really did attempt to disinherit his son by giving all his money to the Catholic Church. The two were battling in court when David Walker died in Kennebunkport in 1918.\n\nWhen he was still in his early twenties, Bert Walker set up G. H. Walker and Company, one of the first investment banking firms in the Midwest. He flourished as a speculator, losing several fortunes, but winning several more, and helping to finance the St. Louis World’s Fair in 1904. Bert was rowdy, profane, and generally obnoxious. Even an approved family history describes him as “coarse.” At a friend’s boisterous birthday party, he grabbed a bass drum from the orchestra and led a drunken parade through the St. Louis Club. Rather than apologize to the board, he resigned to form the Racquet Club, whose motto was “Youth Will Be Served.” Bert liked to plaster his name around — on his companies, his houses, and his children. As president of the U.S. Golfing Association, he founded an Anglo-American tournament known, of course, as the Walker Cup.\n\nIn the family, Bert Walker is described as a bully and a boor, or worse — a violent tyrant who pummeled his sons in a boxing ring set up in his house in hopes of toughening them into professional athletes. When his son Lou embarrassed him by showing up tipsy on the tennis court after lunch one day in Maine, his father told him he was too stupid for college and sent him to work the next morning in a steel mill in Bradford, Pennsylvania. “I was always scared as hell of him,” Lou said. One of George Herbert Walker’s grandchildren, Elsie Walker Kilbourne, was quoted in a newspaper story describing the conflict between father and sons even more bluntly. Bert Walker, she said, was a “tough old bastard.” As she put it, ‘‘there really wasn’t a lot of love on the part of the boys for their father.” Bert Walker’s relationships with his daughters were more pleasant, though he refused to send them to college because he didn’t believe in educating women.\n\nAs the leading investment banker in the Midwest, Bert Walker got to know the Harriman family. The young Harriman brothers, Averell and Roland, had inherited their father’s railroad fortune after graduating from Yale, and in 1919 found themselves needing an experienced man to head their Wall Street firm. Bert Walker readily agreed to relocate east and take charge of the Harriman enterprises. Unlike the Smith family in Meet Me in St. Louis, who can’t bear to abandon their friendly hometown, the Walkers couldn’t wait to move to New York City. After arriving in 1920, they lived far more luxuriously than they had in St. Louis, in a mansion on Madison Avenue, and later in a grand apartment at One Sutton Place. The Walker weekend home on the north shore of Long Island was a Gatsby palace with marble floors, a swimming pool, and a lawn sloping down to the sound. Bert Walker appeared at dinner in white tie, to be served by liveried butlers. He had another grand estate in Santa Barbara, California.\n\nWith the money they made financing Soviet oil drilling in the Caucasus, Bert Walker and Averell Harriman bought a stable of racing horses. But after a time, they couldn’t agree about how to handle their best horse, Chance Play. Walker, who loved to gamble, wanted to race him as often as possible. Harriman wanted to hold out for a few important races and a long career of stud fees. So they divvied up the horses and instead bought a 150-foot yacht together. Bert Walker’s success on Wall Street also supported a small army of Negro servants at the ten-thousand-acre hunting lodge he bought in South Carolina and named Duncannon. The current owners have preserved the bullet holes left in the dining room ceiling when Bert fired at a wasp that stung him.\n\nThe Great Depression spelled the end of Bert Walker’s career at Harriman; he wanted to take on levels of risk that the brothers con- sidered dangerous at a time when the firm was operating in the red. He was pushed out at the time of the merger that his son-in-law Prescott Bush helped to engineer with the firm of Brown Brothers. But Bert Walker had liquidated his portfolio near the top, and the Walkers were untouched by the stock-market crash. In the 1930s, he and his wife each had their own chauffeured Rolls-Royce. “Gampy” Walker, as his grandchildren called him, gave them $500 each for their birthdays — a sum so enormous that it directly threatened Prescott’s ethos of an honest day’s work for a day’s pay.\n\nThe Bush heritage is something closer to the Puritan stereotype. The presidential line descends from James Smith Bush (1825–1889), whose connection to Yale and the Episcopal clergy dates from the 1840s, and who married into a distinguished Concord, Massachusetts, family. James Bush left the law for the ministry, which he served in Orange, New Jersey, San Francisco, and Staten Island.\n\nIt is with J. S. Bush that we first spot the intensity of duty and principle that is one powerful strain in the Bush ethos. This struggle comes through in the two books of sermons he published, More Words About the Bible (1883) and Evidence of Faith (1885). As the second title suggests, the Reverend Bush was divided between reason and belief. He thought that Christianity needed a rational basis, not an appeal to miracles, and he lost his respect for an Episcopal hierarchy he thought detached from the use of intellect and true spirituality. Under the influence of Ralph Waldo Emerson, James Bush resigned his parish in Staten Island and moved to Concord in 1883. He was on his way to leaving the Episcopal Church and becoming a Unitarian. According to his Yale obituary, it was anguish over this decision that killed him at the age of sixty-five.\n\nFrom J. S. Bush on, father-son relationships on the Bush side of the family follow a distinct pattern of rebellious emulation. Sons seek their own paths to the paternal destinations of financial independence and political accomplishment. Unlike Walker men, Bush men never simply join the family firm. Walker sons tend to succumb in a contest of wills with their fathers. Bush sons follow their fathers while convincing themselves they are starting from scratch. As Jeb once put it, the Bush kids grew up believing they “weren’t crap” (meaning that they were crap) until they’d gone out and done something on their own. The Walker kids were raised to believe they were crap in any case, and would have a chair waiting for them at the G. H. Walker & Co. office in St. Louis. Running through the conjoined family is a confusion between high personal accomplishment, which both Bushes and Walkers expect, and hereditary privilege, which both sides assume, but the Bushes disclaim.\n\nRather than follow his father to Yale and into the ministry, Samuel Prescott Bush (1863–1948) studied business at Stevens College and in the 1890s went to work for the Pennsylvania Railroad in Columbus, Ohio. But Samuel P. Bush embodies the family type as much as the seeking transcendentalist he rebelled against: he is described as austere and frugal, a rather cold man, but with a powerful sense of social obligation. He went on to pursue a successful career in the railroad equipment business, eventually running a Rockefellerbacked company called Buckeye Steel, where he was known for his community-mindedness and benevolent paternalism toward his workers, many of whom were African-American.\n\nSamuel’s oldest son, Prescott Bush, followed the family pattern in rejecting his father’s chosen home (the Midwest), his calling (manufacturing), and his politics (Democratic). Later in life, after he had achieved his own financial independence and political success as a two-term senator from Connecticut, Prescott often said — and seemed actually to believe — that he had been required to make his own way in the world because his father couldn’t afford to support him. Though Prescott returned to work briefly for his father after college, the two were never close, and according to his own children, Prescott never spoke about him. When Samuel P. Bush died in 1948, Prescott turned down his share of the inheritance. Temperamentally, father and son seem to have been very much alike.\n\nSent to St. George’s, an elite boarding school on the East Coast, Prescott was elected head prefect his final year and contemplated a career in the ministry. After he arrived at Yale in 1913, he epitomized the college career depicted in Stover at Yale, the 1912 novel that F. Scott Fitzgerald called a “textbook” for his generation. Like Stover, Prescott came from the Midwest, learned to navigate a social system revolving around sports and secret societies, and triumphed by being tapped for Skull and Bones. At a time when Ivy League sports were treated as having national significance, he collected varsity letters in baseball, hockey, and golf. A powerful bass, he was a fixture of the Yale Men’s Choir, the Glee Club, and the Whiffenpoofs. As for Stover, his college years paved his path to business success and defined the rest of his life.\n\nIn Fort Sill, Oklahoma, Prescott and fellow members of the Yale Battalion “crooked” a skull they claimed was Geronimo’s from an Apache cemetery for the Bones temple — a prank that would have repercussions for his son and grandson when the tribe sought to have it returned. From there, Prescott shipped out to France, where he served in the trenches near Verdun for the last ten weeks of the First World War. The key episode in his military career — and perhaps in his entire early life — was a missed joke that embarrassed the family. Prescott wrote a satiric letter home about his Davy Crockett–like exploits; he spun a satiric yarn about saving the lives of the Allies’ three most famous generals, Foch, Haig, and Pershing, by batting away a German shell with his service knife. Prescott went on to humorously describe being covered with ribbons and medals by the grateful French, British, and Americans. Prescott’s mother, Flora, missing her son’s Yale-inflected irony and taking the facetious account literally, proudly sent the letter off to her local newspaper, the Ohio State Journal. Also missing the joke, the paper ran an account on its front page (“3 High Military Honors Conferred on Capt. Bush”), which was then picked up by the New Haven Journal-Courier (“Triple Honor to P.S. Bush, Yale ’17”). Parents and son alike felt deep shame when the local paper had to publish a letter from his mother as a front-page retraction. In this episode, Prescott inadvertently transgressed every Bush family value — modesty, honesty, and propriety.\n\nAfter Prescott returned home in 1919, he moved to St. Louis to take a job selling hardware for Walter Simmons, whom he met at a Yale reunion. There he began courting the eighteen-year-old Dorothy Walker. If Bert Walker had a touch of Gatsby, Prescott Bush was at that stage the ingenuous Nick Carraway. Bert was impressed by Prescott’s physical presence and athletic ability, and even more that he’d been a member of the right secret society at Yale. Prescott always tried to downplay his father-in-law’s role in bringing him to Harriman Brothers a few years later. As he often noted, he had his own connections there: fellow Bonesmen Roland Harriman, Bob Lovett, and Knight Woolley. In reality, Prescott had considerable help from his father-in-law but resented anyone thinking he had.\n\nDespite the chumminess of his Wall Street world, Prescott could not have flourished on the basis of relationships alone. He thrived because of his business sense. After the financial crash in 1929, he helped save Harriman by pushing the spendthrift Averell to close offices in Paris and Warsaw and cut costs in the one remaining European outpost in Berlin. It was Prescott who initiated a pivotal merger with his fellow Bonesmen at the more solvent Brown Brothers, which had the further advantage of pushing his father-in-law out. Prescott had a nose for deals, including one to buy a quarter-interest in CBS for $2.5 million in 1932. At one point, Prescott served on seventeen corporate boards, not counting the Yale Corporation.\n\nAs he achieved his own success, Prescott pulled his wife away from her father and his avaricious values. Indeed, it was Dotty Bush who became known as the guardian of the family’s Puritan ethic because of the way she inculcated their five children with the wisdom that intense competitiveness was compatible with severe modesty. Dotty was known in the family for slapping down anyone caught bragging, and is probably responsible for her son the forty-first president’s nonsense-generating aversion to the first-person pronoun (and sometimes to pronouns altogether). Dotty’s version of this ethic came originally from her long-suffering mother, Loulie Walker, but was powerfully reinforced by Prescott. At Prescott’s funeral in 1972, Dorothy gave a eulogy in which she thanked her late husband for teaching her a “lack of pride in material possessions.”\n\nPrescott was a huge man — six foot four and 250 pounds, a giant to his children, with a gravelly baritone voice and formal bearing. He wore a coat and tie to dinner, even during summer vacations at Kennebunkport. His children feared and admired him; it’s not clear that anyone other than Dorothy ever felt much affection for him. He comes across in family descriptions as gloomy and distant, a “scary man” to his son Jonathan, “stern” and “righteous” in his grandson Jeb’s description. Prescott never spoke to his children about the sudden death of his mother, Flora, who was killed by a car while strolling on vacation, in 1920. In later life, after retiring from public office, he demanded that the grandchildren call him “Senator.” In various accounts, Prescott is a curiously blank figure — an upright man, expressing little emotion other than irritability, which was exacerbated when he drank. He liked playing golf, but his only apparent joy was music, and in particular the Ivy League style of a cappella singing. Never happier than when harmonizing in a straw boater, he performed “I’m Going to Raise the Deuce When I Get Loose in Town” with his barbershop quartet of Yale Glee Club alumni at a Connecticut Republican convention. He was extremely proud of the comic speech he delivered at the Alfalfa Club’s 1959 dinner, which he naturally concluded with a solo performance of “The Whiffenpoof Song.”\n\nThe only attempt to write Prescott Bush’s biography, by the Houston sportswriter Mickey Herskowitz, resulted in vivid sketches of everyone around him, with a void at the center of the canvas.* Prescott’s own autobiographical account, a 454-page oral history he deposited at Columbia University, is singularly lacking in color, passion, or emotion. What does come through is his sense of propriety and obligation — to community, country, and family. The Bush patriarch operated according to a code typical of his era and social class, but with a particular emphasis on the repression of selfish desire. Bush played golf well enough to pursue a professional career, but never seems to have considered it — though he later rendered “service” to the sport as president of the U.S. Golf Association. In his family, one pursued one’s passions as hobbies, not vocations. He both envied and disapproved of his third son, Johnny Bush, who pursued a career in musical theater before settling down to work for G. H. Walker. Prescott’s code also involved strict rules about how to live, dress, and comport oneself. “I never heard him fart,” Johnny once said of his father. As a senator, Prescott introduced a rule change forbidding his colleagues to wave to guests in the gallery.\n\nAt the Round Hill Country Club in Greenwich, Prescott stormed out of the locker room when a friend told a mildly dirty joke in front of his fourteen-year-old son. “I don’t ever want to hear that kind of language in here again,” he harrumphed. Prescott was struck dumb by the vamping and flirting of Clare Boothe Luce, a sometime rival in Connecticut Republican politics. He broke off relations with his younger brother James, when James left his first wife in 1946. Years later, he pulled his support from Nelson Rockefeller on the same grounds. “Have we come to the point in our life as a nation when the governor of a great state — one who perhaps aspires to be nominated for President of the United States — can desert a good wife, divorce her, then persuade a young mother of four youngsters to abandon her husband and their four children and marry the governor?” he asked the 1963 graduating class at the girls’ prep school Rosemary Hall in a commencement address. This survives as Senator Bush’s only memorable speech.\n\nPrescott had definite ideas about money, one of which was that men shouldn’t live off their wives. That his home in Greenwich was purchased by his father-in-law and remained in Dorothy’s name was a contradiction he had to live with. Prescott was perpetually distinguishing himself from both the kind of people who inherited wealth and those who pursued money for its own sake — namely the Walkers. The cheapness of the Bush men isn’t just an endearing comic trait. It reflects the reality that there has never been any large pool of capital on the Bush side of the family. Though he poor-mouthed preposterously, Prescott actually accumulated fairly little, and didn’t leave much behind. When George H. W. Bush set up his first oil business in 1950, he got his seed capital from his Uncle Herbie Walker, who was by then running G. H. Walker. When George W. Bush did the same thing twenty-five years later, it was with money from a Walker trust fund.\n\nWealth for Prescott Bush was a lever rather than a yardstick. He deplored people who took their servants for granted or used them as markers of status. The Bush servants were auxiliary semifamily — the not-really-a-chauffeur Alec who drove him to the station in his secondhand car, the-sort-of-a-housekeeper Alice — as opposed to the cowed, uniformed cadres at the Walker mansions. For Prescott, the point of money was the freedom to perform service, or “giving back to the community” as his son Poppy called it. Prescott idealized the role his partner Averell Harriman played for FDR and Truman. Short of opportunities at that level, he was willing to put in decades of drudgery at the Greenwich Representative Town Meeting. Campaigning for office was a necessary evil, a debasing impediment on the path to public service and ultimately becoming a Harrimantype wise man.\n\nPrescott Bush established three essential myths that Bush men live by. The first is: I made it on my own. The second is: I’m not really rich. The third is: I’m running to serve my country. Not until 1950, when he was in his mid-fifties and nearly done paying private school bills did Prescott feel financially secure enough to try for a U.S. Senate seat left open by a retirement. This was the first of four campaigns that remain significant because of the way they forged the Bushes as a polit- ical force, and because of the lessons the family developed from them. Though Poppy, unlike his siblings, worked on none of his father’s campaigns, he watched closely and took in the implications. His sons George and Jeb would do the same with his, fostering the conundrum of independence as a family tradition. Bush men try to be different by doing essentially the same thing.\n\nOn top of these three myths were the seven lessons that Prescott’s Senate losses and eventual victories imparted to the family. The first lesson was the treachery of the press. In 1950, Bush was running even with William Benton, the Democratic nominee. But on the Sunday before the election, the muckraking columnist Drew Pearson asserted on his radio show that Prescott was treasurer of the Birth Control League. In the days before Griswold v. Connecticut, birth control remained illegal in the majority-Catholic state. While the family has long decried this as a smear, it was in fact a minor distortion — carefully orchestrated for maximum harm. Prescott was listed as treasurer on a letterhead for Planned Parenthood, a successor organization to the Birth Control League, which had closed up shop in 1942. Though he denied the charge, Prescott lost by 1,102 votes.\n\nLesson #2 from Prescott’s early campaigns was the importance of moment. Bush tried again in 1952, but this time lost the Republican primary. He thought his final shot had passed. Then he got a third chance when Connecticut’s other sitting senator died and he was handed the Republican nomination for an open seat. Prescott got the Whiffs out on the trail again and, wearing a raccoon coat, introduced Dwight Eisenhower at a rally in New Haven. With the wind of Ike’s 1952 landslide at his back, Prescott won. In future campaigns, family members would ponder obsessively whether conditions were ripe.\n\nLesson #3 was money before politics. Prescott thought only someone who was financially secure could resist the corrupting pressures of politics. In 1956, he was pleased to tell President Eisenhower that he had brushed off threats to run Poppy out of the oil business if Prescott voted against legislation to deregulate natural gas. Prescott opposed increasing the salary of senators from $12,500 to $22,500, arguing that the job was “service” like the ministry or teaching. In this vision, either an independent income or a monastic lifestyle was required for elected officials. Like Prescott, Poppy and his sons would seek wealth before aiming for office.\n\nLesson #4 was the primacy of connections and manners. Politics for the “modern Republican” Prescott Bush was not principally about ideology or a set of beliefs. It was an establishment responsibility pursued on the basis of relationships cultivated through sports, business, and the Ivy League. The best golfer in the Senate, Prescott played often with Eisenhower at the Burning Tree Country Club. But Prescott also shared Yale and Ohio bonds with Robert Taft, who led the antediluvian wing of the GOP. Prescott helped Taft’s son become ambassador to Ireland as a way to arbitrate between the president and the party leader. In an act of some courage, he introduced Joe McCarthy at a rally in Bridgeport in 1952 while expressing “reservations” about Mc- Carthy’s methods. But he took greatest pride in being one of the only colleagues to visit McCarthy on his deathbed at Walter Reed Hospital.\n\nLesson #5 was that Northeastern moderates were becoming an endangered species. In office, Prescott Bush supported civil rights legislation, larger immigration quotas, and higher taxes. Conservatives classified him alongside Clifford Case of New Jersey, Leverett Saltonstall of Massachusetts, and Nelson Rockefeller of New York. Liberal Republicanism was his son Poppy’s natural political tendency as well. But it wouldn’t last and couldn’t travel. An international investment banker trailing Whiffenpoofs, Prescott was easily caricatured as a softheaded patrician. His son Poppy’s decision to pursue politics from Texas rather than Connecticut — and his early efforts to appease the most noxious elements on the right, including the John Birch Society — reflected his understanding of what sort of Republican would predominate in the future. Prescott’s Texas-bred grandsons George W. and Jeb would shed the taint of moderation altogether and hide their establishment trappings more convincingly.\n\nLesson #6 was to not give up. Prescott Bush got elected to the Senate only on his third try, thanks to an opportunity that arose unexpectedly after he had seemingly failed for good. Beset by dizzy spells and stomach pains — and facing what would have been a tough campaign — Prescott did not run for reelection in 1962. This was a decision he came to regret as soon as he took a rest and felt better. He returned to Brown Brothers Harriman, where he had little to do, and lived for another ten years, lamenting his mistake until the end.\n\nThe most important lesson of all, #7, was to trust only the family. Prescott’s Democratic partners, Averell Harriman and Bob Lovett, supported his opponent Abraham Ribicoff in the 1952 election. At the state Democratic convention, Harriman gave a rousing speech attacking Prescott. Prescott, who had helped save the firm during the Depression, took this as an enormous betrayal and the two men didn’t speak to each other for more than a decade. This is the trust-onlyblood mind-set that led Howard Fineman of Newsweek to dub the Bushes “the WASP Corleones.” George H. W. Bush’s longtime spokesman Marlin Fitzwater once described a meeting that took place in 1985 at Camp David, to organize Poppy’s upcoming presidential run. Poppy’s brothers and sons were on one side of a long table, the advisers on the other. “It struck me then and there that the Bushes were very different from the Kennedys in that they would never have their Ted Sorensen,” Fitzwater said. “No one outside the family would ever enter the inner circle.”\n\nThere’s a useful comparison here to the tribe the Bushes have always regarded as their antithesis. Joe Kennedy was Prescott Bush’s contemporary, just six years older, and bore a striking physical resemblance to him. Like Prescott, he did not found a dynasty so much as he took one over in a merger and made it a success, displacing his fatherin- law as patriarch of the family. Joe Kennedy’s father-in-law, John Fitzgerald, was the first Irish mayor of Boston and one of its famous citizens, while his own father, Patrick Joseph Kennedy, was merely a prosperous bar owner and minor politician. Through sheer force of will — and because his children got his last name rather than his wife’s — Joe Kennedy was able to dominate the family, mold it in his image, and direct its fortunes.\n\nPrescott Bush never liked what he saw reflected in the Kennedy mirror. Part of this was old-fashioned social snobbery; Prescott was a member of all the clubs that wouldn’t let in Joe Kennedy because he was Irish and Catholic. And part of the complaint was political. The Democratic Kennedys were on the other side of presidential campaigns in which Prescott and his sons supported Eisenhower and Nixon. But the real reason Prescott Bush found the Kennedys so distasteful is that he identified them with the hubristic wealth and entitlement of his father-in-law, George Herbert Walker’s, large Catholic family. Joe Kennedy was too greedy, too flashy, and insufficiently devoted to the community. With their well-known infidelities, reckless risk-taking, and scandals, the Kennedys, like the Walkers, were morally deficient. Prescott also objected to Joe Kennedy’s effort to direct and finance the political careers of his sons, which violated his family’s precept of making it on your own (with help). Prescott took what he considered a more proper route of giving his sons a good start in life and setting an example for them to follow.\n\nPoppy later channeled his father’s view of the Kennedy clan in relation to his son George W.’s presidential campaign. Now he was Joseph Kennedy, the father of the candidate, in the imputed analogy. Poppy emphasized that the Bushes didn’t have anything to prove, that they didn’t need to win the way the Kennedys did. “It’s not that this is John F. Kennedy’s father driving his sons to do something,” George H. W. Bush told Hugh Sidey of Time during the post-election limbo in November 2000. “We are not that way in this family. This is not about vindication or legacy or entitlement.” In Poppy’s mind as in his father’s, the decent and sincere Bushes seek office as individuals. The corrupt and decadent Kennedys run as representatives of the family conglomerate. The Bush boys got to choose their paths in life. The Kennedys had theirs chosen for them. George W. Bush perpetuated the family prejudice, “They never had to work,” he commented about the Kennedys in 1989, “They never had to have a job.”\n\nPerhaps it was the parallels in his own generation that prompted Poppy to disown the natural comparison so strenuously. In Prescott Bush’s as in Joe Kennedy’s household, the second son took his older brother’s place as the vehicle for the family’s ambitions as a result of what happened in the Second World War. John F. Kennedy, who suffered from chronic health problems, was given a battlefield promotion by his father only after his older and more beloved brother Joseph Kennedy Jr. was killed in the defense of Britain. Jack’s wartime heroism in rescuing the survivors of PT-109 strengthened his father’s confidence in his political prospects. After JFK was assassinated, the family elevated Robert F. Kennedy to the leadership position. After Robert was killed, it focused on the youngest of the four brothers, Ted.\n\nIn the Bush family, Poppy overtook his older brother, Prescott Jr. (b. 1922), in a similar way during World War II, but without anyone getting killed. Pressie, two years older than Poppy, wanted to enlist in the armed forces as well, but was rejected for service because of near-blindness in one eye. While Poppy flew bombing missions over the Pacific, Pressie whiled away his days at a tennis club in Rio. Poppy’s wartime heroics fixed his position as first among Prescott Sr.’s four sons, and turned Pressie into a frustrated subordinate sibling.\n\nThereafter, as Poppy flourished in business and politics, Pressie stayed close to the Round Hill Country Club and the world of his parents, serving as a factotum to his father in Connecticut politics and his successor on the Republican Town Committee and at the Greenwich Representative Town Meeting. The reversal of the positions of the two brothers became more glaring when Pressie finally tried for national office himself in 1982, announcing against Senator Lowell Weicker in the Republican primary. Starting at the Senate was a family tradition and the Bushes detested Weicker, but this was a poor choice of moment. Challenging the vulnerable incumbent would only soften Weicker up enough to hand his seat, and possibly control of the Senate, to the Democrats. The awkward work of getting Pressie to withdraw from the race fell to his little brother the vice president, George H. W. Bush.\n\nPressie’s abortive political career pointed to one way in which the Bushes were indeed not like the Kennedys: the imputed line of succession in the Bush family descended vertically rather than horizon- tally. Of the four Bush brothers, Poppy was the only one who would succeed in following the business-to-politics route established by his father and the only one who would amount to much in either pursuit. Like John F. Kennedy, George H. W. Bush received critical help from his father in establishing his financial base and his political career. Unlike JFK, he needed the illusion that he had done it all on his own.\n\nThe Kennedy family’s permanent home is the summer compound Joe bought in Hyannisport, Massachusetts, in 1928. The Bush family summers farther up the Atlantic Coast, in Kennebunkport, Maine. The cedar-shingled house that David Walker and his son Bert built there is the primary scene of the Bush-Walker struggle. Dorothy Walker Bush was born there in 1901 and raised there in summers, competing as fiercely as her brothers, and often beating them at tennis and other contests. She and Prescott were given a bungalow on the property as a wedding present in 1921, and continued to spend summers there with their children through the 1940s. But after Poppy returned from the Pacific, the bungalow became increasingly uncomfortable for Prescott. Bert’s ethic of fabulous wealth and brutal competition got on his nerves, in part because of how much it impressed his two oldest sons. Prescott rejected the Walker family ethos that ruled at Kennebunkport, which Elsie Walker Kilbourne once described as “having to be big shots” at everything they did.\n\nPrescott loved golf, tennis, and baseball, liked to win, and was a better athlete than his father-in-law. But he and his wife raised their sons to compete within the boundaries of civility. Poppy learned from his mother to call close tennis shots in and preferred doubles to singles. His sportsmanship is best expressed in his passion for horseshoes — a less than serious game that he takes incredibly seriously. The Walker brothers play without any such irony. Theirs was a family, after all, in which sloppy tennis could get you sent to work in a factory. Visitors have often described a special edge to matches that pitted the Walkers against the Bushes. Both families tease when they play. But the teasing of Poppy and his brothers is funny and mostly benign. The Walker teasing during a tennis match can be personal and nasty.\n\nBert Walker’s grandson Ray Walker told me that his family “treats winning as an end in itself” — a trait he sees in Poppy and George W. Bush as well. One of the things some of the Walkers most wanted to win was Prescott and Dorothy Bush’s sons. Bert Walker would let his grandsons tool around on his thirty-eight-foot speedboat, the Tomboy, disturbing the peace with blasts of its deafening siren. Pressie and Poppy were fascinated by “Gampy,” and, to the irritation of their father, were said to resemble him in appearance and personality.\n\nBut Prescott’s nemesis in this battle was less his father-in-law than his brother-in-law George Herbert Walker Jr., known as “Uncle Herbie.” Herbie was a driven businessman, who began to challenge his father for dominance in the family business after the pattern of his own father in relation to D. D. Walker. After Herbie’s death, his widow, Mary Walker, remembered him as “a very aggressive person.” His aggression was turned on his own family as well. By the late 1930s, Uncle Herbie was already closer to George and his brothers, Pressie, Johnny, and Bucky, than he was to his own two sons, George Herbert Walker III (known, like his grandfather, as “Bert”) and Ray. Uncle Herbie hired Pressie and Johnny to work for G. H. Walker. His own older son and namesake was chosen to run the firm’s St. Louis office only after Poppy turned down the job. A baseball lover who co-founded the New York Mets as an expansion team in 1960, Herbie went to every one of George’s college games — but often skipped the sports matches of his own sons. “In our younger years, my dad held up George as a model to us,” George Herbert Walker III told a reporter in 1988. Ray Walker once described his father’s attitude toward his nephew Poppy as “hero worship.”\n\nTo the irritation of Prescott Bush, Poppy returned the sentiment, displaying tremendous affection and regard for his humorless and arrogant Uncle Herbie. In the White House, Poppy often talked to his aides about Uncle Herbie’s ownership of a baseball franchise as the life of Riley — the kind of thing he would have liked to do if he weren’t burdened with the responsibility of service and the cares of the world. This became the fantasy of young George W. as well, after his greatuncle Herbie took him to meet Casey Stengel and the legendary St. Louis player Rogers Hornsby in the Mets dugout.\n\nA decade of Poppy’s and Uncle Herbie’s letters back and forth, preserved on onionskin carbons, reside in the Bush Library. It is an intimate business correspondence that skips seamlessly from drilling rights, offshore rigs, and stock placements to Yale football and family matters. “Dearest Pop,” Herbie writes in late 1951 after a visit to Texas with his wife, Mary, to inspect Bush’s new company. “I can’t tell you how much we all enjoyed our visit with you in Midland and the wonderful hospitality that you and Bar showed us. . . . It was grand to get a good feel of your picture, and I am confident that it is a matter of time until we really start to go places. I am also convinced that you are playing the thing the right way, and I am thoroughly pleased with the whole operation to date.” In his letters, Uncle Herbie glories in his role as benefactor to the Bush boys. He asks Poppy what he thinks of his trying to get brother Pressie the job of business manager of the Yale Athletic Association; he recounts brother Johnny’s arrival at G. H. Walker & Co.\n\nPoppy’s letters back to his uncle are flattering and affectionate. He thanks Herbie and Mary every year for hosting his family at Kennebunkport, for meals and vacations in the Bahamas. The occasional personal letter from Poppy to his father, by comparison, reads like true business correspondence, answering requests for information and registering changes of address. After he and Barbara move to Houston in 1959, Poppy — who would request a $2 refund on a broken toaster — writes to ask whether the senator can get them a discount on beds from the Simmons Company, where he used to serve on the board.\n\nThis paternal triangle left wounds on both sides. Prescott envied his son’s closeness to Herbie. Herbie’s sons wondered why their father was so generous to his nephews and so tough on them. In one of the letters, Herbie confides his frustration with his younger son, Ray, who had quit the JV football squad at Yale, because at 145 pounds he was getting clobbered. “I, of course, feel that he made the decision too early as all the coaches have told me they expected to be able to use him substantially as the season went along,” Uncle Herbie writes to Poppy. Ray Walker subsequently took a turn considered bizarre in America’s least introspective family when he quit G. H. Walker to train as a Jungian analyst. Today he lives in Vermont, where he nurses bitter feelings about his father and his cousins.\n\nOver the summers, Uncle Herbie tried to lay claim to the affections of Poppy’s sons the same way he had with Prescott’s. In one of the letters I found in the Bush Library, he describes for Poppy the scene in Kennebunkport, where the six-year-old Little George was visiting with his mother in July 1952, when Poppy was too busy to come. “Dear Pop,” Herbie writes:\n\nI have just returned from Kennebunkport and Georgie, who without any exaggeration has taken the place over and is everybody’s favorite. He is a great kid and reminds everyone so much of you. He drove the speedboat alone for about fifteen minutes yesterday and was so sure of himself, demanded the right to bring it into the river and practically docked it. We then had him on the ball field for half an hour and you ought to see me try to knock tennis balls past him. . . . I was particularly touched when he wept buckets at saying goodbye to me. He is such a friendly and wonderfully emotional child and altogether something you should be tremendously proud of. Incidentally, he calls Ray “Uncle Ray” and me just plain Herbie.\n\nThe description is fascinating both for the early glimpse of George W. Bush’s personality (“so sure of himself”), and as an expression of Uncle Herbie’s urge to recapitulate his pattern of avuncular adoption.\n\nWhen his father died in 1953, Herbie took ownership of both the big house in Kennebunkport and the role of Walker paterfamilias. He had also inherited his father’s bullying, egotistical personality, which irritated Prescott much more in Herbie than it had in Bert.\n\nPrescott couched his jealousy about Uncle Herbie’s relationships with his sons in moral censure. Like his father, Uncle Herbie was a gambler and a philanderer, who often boasted about his conquests, despite being married. One of the sports he played at Kennebunkport was chasing women — the kind of thing the Kennedys did in Hyannisport. Prescott, who had cut off his own brother James for leaving his wife, found Herbie’s boasting about his romantic conquests intolerable. The tensions were exacerbated after Prescott’s election to the Senate when Herbie, hoping to capitalize on his brother-in-law’s appointment to a congressional committee on nuclear energy, set up a partnership with other investors to get into the business. Prescott eventually refused to visit Kennebunkport while Herbie was there. Instead, he and Dorothy began vacationing on Fishers Island, off the coast of Connecticut. They later bought a house on Hobe Sound, the wealthy enclave on Jupiter Island, Florida.\n\nWhen Prescott died in 1972, Poppy described him in a note to his friend C. Fred Chambers as an “inspiration” and “the incentive behind everything I did.” When Herbie lay on his deathbed five years later, Poppy was far more emotional, calling his uncle “father,” “brother,” and “best friend.” After the funeral, Poppy persuaded Herbie’s widow, Mary — with his mother, Dorothy’s, help — to sell Walker’s Point to him on an installment plan, for the significantly submarket price of $780,000. This infuriated Herbie’s sons, who stood to inherit the proceeds from subdivision and development. But the conflict was about more than money. The family jewel was going to their father’s surrogate son. Poppy proceeded to remodel and expand the house, turning it into a proper presidential compound. After 1981, the requirements of the Secret Service and the growing brood of Bush grandchildren crowded the Walker cousins out of their family home.\n\nPoppy’s hostile takeover of Kennebunkport represented the submersion of the St. Louis clan and the repudiation of its mercantile values. He would turn it into the anti-Hyannisport, a place where nobody drank to excess, everyone went to sleep early (in the right bed), and got up for church on Sunday. Despite his greater affection for Herbie, Poppy was Prescott’s son, embodying his morality, good manners, and sense of fair play. The new paterfamilias was, like his father, a man bored with the social whirl, the acquisition of toys, and the accumulation of wealth. He’d rather invite his barber to go fishing for blues. (“He loves all the natives that have worked on the place,” his aunt Mary Walker said, some years after selling him the house.) Kennebunkport, with its weathered shingles, was now assumed to be the Bushes’ ancestral manse, a Yankee relic rather than a robber baron’s playground. In years to come, the public would only have the dimmest sense of the distaff side of Poppy’s family beyond his sturdy, spirited mother, Dorothy. Keenly aware of their defeat, the Walkers from time to time flare with resentment. Their occasional sparks are mercilessly extinguished by Barbara Bush, who since the late 1970s has served as “enforcer” not just for her own children, but for her husband’s entire tribe.**\n\nGeorge H. W. Bush, who occasionally expresses himself in verse, once wrote a poem about Kennebunkport. It describes a vision in which the departed Bushes and Walkers sit side by side at St. Ann’s Church on a Sunday morning — “my Dad and Herby there next to Lou.” (“Herby” is Poppy’s sentimental spelling from childhood.) In this imagining, family conflict has faded away, with the younger generation carrying on a singular Bush tradition.\n\nI see the brides and the christened face\n\nSoul strength from this sacred place ...\n\nThey’re all in bed now in the dorm\n\nThe pulse of generations firmly born\n\nThe sea’s the same — the rocks stay fast\n\nThe new ones’ strength — generations past.\n\nThe Kennebunkport of these verses is no longer Bert and Herbie Walker’s hedonistic playground. It is a place to “Just relax and watch the sea / Treasure the strength God’s given you.” George H. W. Bush’s retreat breeds the Yankee values instilled in him by his father — making one’s own way in the world and giving something back. In church, “the kids are passing the collection plate.” The “firmly born” are all now Bushes, even if their last names are Walker.\n\nThere is a double irony here. Prescott Bush, who died in 1972, didn’t live to see his ethic triumph in the family struggle. But in the end, the victory wasn’t permanent. George W. Bush likes to say he is his mother’s son. But many of his most distinctive traits don’t seem to come from her or from his father. He is impatient, aggressive, often angry, and sometimes cruel. He’s a plunger, not a careful analyst or a patient builder. He loves to compete but can’t stand losing. The man’s a Walker, through and through.\n\n* That this book exists is the result of a conflict among Bush men. In 1999, Herskowitz, a wellregarded Texas ghostwriter, was hired to draft George W. Bush’s presidential campaign autobiography, the book published in 2000 as A Charge to Keep. But the early chapters Herskowitz submitted were judged to overemphasize W.’s early difficulties, describing him, for instance, as having been unsuccessful in the oil business. As a result, Herskowitz was fired in favor of George W.’s dauntless propagandist, Karen Hughes. But George H. W. Bush, who was friendly with Herskowitz, felt bad about this harsh treatment, and so gave Herskowitz the consolation prize of burnishing his late father’s image. This assignment reflected not just George H.W. Bush’s dismay at the mistreatment of a loyal family courtier, but his effort to posthumously ensure that his father would replace the rapacious Bert Walker as the family’s official founder.\n\n** George Herbert Walker III failed in a run for Congress in 1992, when his father’s favorite nephew declined to endorse him in the GOP primary. He was appointed ambassador to Hungary in 2003 by his second cousin, George W. Bush.\n\nThe foregoing is excerpted from “The Bush Tragedy,” by Jacob Weisberg. All rights reserved.
