        "text": "Oration 1\n\nThe Oration of Master George Herbert, Orator of the Vniuersitie of Cambridge, when the Ambassadours were made Masters of Arts\n\nCharles and Buckingham had left England for Madrid on February 17, 1622/1623. Don Carlos de Coloma and Ferdinand, Baron de Boyschot were awarded the honorary degrees of Master of Arts ten days later. Much of the Cambridge University community disapproved of these honorary degrees. Powers-Beck includes Joseph Mead’s letter to Sir Martin Stuteville, noting Mead’s “heavy sarcasm” about how orations delivered to the ambassadors flattered them with having “fathered the foundation of our University upon the Spanyards” and “how happie we were not only to see them here, but should be to have the Spanish blood come hither” (“Concerning Laurels” 5–6). Mead probably refers to Edmund Eade’s oration, which credits the founding of Cambridge University to a Spanish prince: “seuenteene hundred yeeres since . . . wee acknowledge our selues to have receiued all those fortunate beginnings of honor, antiquitie and learning from the Spanish Nation” (True Copies C4). According to Hutchinson, the “Orations of the Vice-Chancellor, the Orator, and others were ‘published by command’ with English translations” (600). Whether Herbert is responsible for the translation of his oration is unclear.\n\n1. Compare the belicose gaze in Carmen Gratulans 2 (“Congratulatory Song”): “And let this look on your face bring joy to heaven, / This face as you gaze admiringly at your lady, but not such a face / As consults, or calls people to war” ll. 9–11).\n\n2. “Rex Catholicissimus” was the title for the Spanish monarch granted by Pope Alexander VI in 1493. The Greek root of the word means “all embracing.”\n\n3. Compare the reference to the Indies in MMS 6 (ll. 7–8), and see pages 90–91 for a discussion of the trope. Herbert makes a similar reference to the Indies in Oration 3 (note 20). [End Page 97]\n\n4. Herbert’s reference here to a saint as divus is not uncommon. Though the term was used in pre-Christian antiquity to refer to a god or emperor, many European churches include inscriptions to Christian saints as diui. Thompson notes that Erasmus in his Modus orandi Deum “comments on the ancient, especially Pauline, custom of calling all Christians ‘saints’ (sancti) and the modern habit of using sanctus and divus interchangeably” (233–34).\n\n5. For a discussion of tineae, or bookworms, see Oration 3: “You have the power of discrimination, of sifting inquiry, you bookworms and gorgers of paper.” See also note 12 of Oration 3 for other uses of the word in Herbert’s Latin.\n\n6. Oration 3 similarly praises the peacefulness necessary for the pursuit of knowledge (paragraph 6).\n\n7. The realms of the court and university are both treated with auxesis, or amplification, Herbert’s praise ascending in force and intensity. Pindar asserts the importance of “songs” in preserving history: “Great deeds of valor, / if they lack songs are obscured in darkness, / and we know of only one mirror for noble deeds, / Memory” (Nemean 7, 12–15). Pindar continues, “I imagine that Odysseus’ fame is greater than what he suffered because of the sweetness of Homer’s verse” (Nemean 7, 20–21). In “The Defence of Poesie,” Philip Sidney praises both historian and poet, referring, like Herbert, to Alexander the Great: “Only Alexander’s example may serve, who by Plutarch is accounted of such virtue, that fortune was not his guide but his footstool; whose acts speak for him, though Plutarch did not; indeed, the phoenix of warlike princes. This Alexander left his schoolmaster, living Aristotle, behind him, but took dead Homer with him” (140).\n\nOration 2\n\nSpeech at the Departure of the King from the University Delivered at Cambridge 12th Day of March 1622/1623\n\nJames I visited Cambridge on March 12, 1622/1623 to attend a performance of Loiola, written by John Hacket, who was after the performance made King’s chaplain. Sutton’s hypertext critical edition and translation of Loiola is available online. Despite some humor at the expense of Jesuits, the primary parody is of Puritans. Following the performance, which did not appear to amuse the King, Herbert made this brief oration..."
