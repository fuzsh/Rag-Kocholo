Phase 4 will be checking the research section for any remaining relevant information and then consolidating it and moving it to the bottom of the profile.\n\nContents\n\n1 Research\n\n2 Biography\n\n2.1 Marriage\n\n3 Birth\n\n4 Parents\n\n5 Siblings\n\n6 Marriage\n\n7 Children\n\n8 Residence\n\n9 Military\n\n10 Death\n\n11 Sources\n\nResearch\n\nThe primary source of the Will of the father of George Scott, William Scott, was written 7 December 1973 and probated on 24 November 1794 in Bedford county, Virginia. This Will lists the wife, Lucy, and the twelve children of William, with George as the second child after James.\n\nThe 2018 Collaborative Process on the family of William and Lucy Scott was started in late May. The initial phase was to create profiles for all twelve of William and Lucy's children in order to have space to copy all of the information found on each of them. Research notes for William Scott, Sr. can be found on Space:Supplemental William Scott 1720-1794 of Bedford, Virginia. The collection phase used internet search to find as much information as possible, without regard for quality or support. The next phase was to use the collected information to direct further specific searches for as many sources as possible. As sources were found, the third stage of the project was to move info in the research section to the biography and sources sections. Stage four will be to further edit bio and finalize source citations. As this project nears completion, the research section will be condensed and moved to the bottom of the profile so that the biography is at the top and it is complete, while being concise. The final stage involves making necessary data field changes that comply with the bio and sources. The entire profile will then be reviewed for genealogical proof standard and an assessment of \"reasonably exhaustive research.\"\n\nThis profile of George Scott has five primary sources;\n\nthe 1793 Will of William Scott, listing George's father and mother\n\nthe Marriage Bond of 1799 for George Scott and Theodocia Dent in Bedford county, Virginia\n\nTax Lists of Campbell county, KY, showing residence 1801-1812\n\nthe 1810 US Census of Campbell county, KY\n\nthe 1821 Will of George Scott.\n\nOther sources are being worked on regarding George's first marriage in 1783, his military service and death date.\n\nThe 2018 Collaborative Process on the family of William and Lucy Scott has expanded its scope several times. It became apparent that William's origins were in Maryland and we needed to conduct research in the records of that Colony. At the same time it has been found that there are so few supporting records for William's children that we have necessarily began conducting research on his grandchildren in order to provide collateral support to the entire family line.\n\nAncestry has information on George Scott (1754-1821) (https://www.ancestry.com/genealogy/records/george-scott_20015035 | accessed 19Jun2018 by SEL)\n\nThe Scott Line: My Roots This is my maternal grandfather's side of the family.

Arnold (Ellanore Scott Riper Arnold 1893-1972) to Mrs. Kennedy on Tuesday 25 Aug 1959, regarding her ancestor, Charles Scott, son of William Scott of Bedford county, Virginia, whose Will was proven on 24 Nov 1794. This letter tried to prove satisfactorily Ellanore's ancestral line to Charles Scott, and subsequently to William Scott.\n\n\"Bedford county has no early records of six of the children of William Scott, Sr. vis: Charles, Evan, Jacob [sic. Joseph?], Obediah, Thomas and Sarah [Scott] Lee.\" The other six children (all sons) of William, Sr. [i.e. Axton, George, Peter, John, James and William] do have records in Bedford county and are listed with source references from \"Early Bedford County Marriage\" and \"Early Bedford County Property Notes.\" The latter may also be known as \"Bedford County Virginia Deed Book\" in several volumes.\n\n\"1783 Bedford County : George Scott in Ministers Returns married Martha Hudson (first wife).\"\n\n\"1783 - D.B.7, p.252 : George Scott buys land from Samuel Shrewsbury on the northeast fork of Beaverdam Creek.\"[1] \"1799 Bedford County : George Scott in Ministers Returns married Doshia Dent (second wife).\"\n\nBiography\n\nGeorge was born about 1742. He passed away about 1821.\n\nMarriage\n\nGeorge married Doshia Dent on 17 Feb 1799. Surety was given by John Dent.[2][3][4]\n\nGeorge Scott was the second oldest child of William Scott and an \"Unknown First Wife of Maryland.\" Lucy James Scott was probably his step-mother. Some family historians believe that his father married Lucy shortly after his mother died and the family moved from Maryland to Bedford county a couple of years before the Colony of Virginia formed the county of Bedford in 1753. William's Will places this family in Bedford county, Virginia in 1793 and 1794. His father, William, Sr. is found in several possible land records, dated 1753 through 1769, have been found. One example is \"William Scott, 400 acres Bedford Co. July 14, 1769. (38, p.821).\"[5] Records from the predecessor county (Lunenburg?) would need to be searched to see if their arrival was before 1753.\n\nGeorge first married Martha Elmore on 20 November 1783 in Bedford county, Virginia and they had possibly ten children.[6] It is assumed that Martha died about 1792.\n\nGeorge second married Theodocia Dent on 17 February 1799 in Bedford county, Virginia and they had possibly six children.[7]\n\nThere is a George Scott residing in Bedford county, Virginia in 1810.[8] There is also a George Scott who lived in Campbell county, Kentucky.[9] The household count needs to be analyzed to determine if these two records are relevant. The interesting thing to note about the Kentucky record is that it appears that George's brother James is also living in Campbell county in 1810.\n\nGeorge died on 29 November 1821 in Campbell county, Kentucky.[10]\n\nBirth\n\nNo source has been found for George's birth date or birth place. Two of George's siblings have proven birth dates; Joseph 1757 and Obediah 1764. According to the 1793 Will of William, Joseph was the 9th and Obediah was the 10th child of Lucy. George was listed in the Will as number two, putting him near 1742 or 1743, after James 1740 or 1741.\n\nParents\n\nPrimary source for parents is the 1793\\1794 Will of William Scott, which lists wife, Lucy, and twelve children.[11][12] No source has been found for father, William Scott's, birth date or place. No source has been found for mother, Lucy's, birth date or place, nor for her maiden name.\n\nSiblings\n\nPrimary source for siblings is the 1793\\1794 Will of William Scott, which lists wife, Lucy, and twelve children; James, George, Sarah Lee, John, Thomas, William, Charles, Axton, Joseph, Obediah, Peter and Evan.[13][14] The list order in the Will shows that George was the second born, if the list order is also the birth order.\n\nMarriage\n\nGeorge first married Martha Elmore (Hudson?) in Bedford county, Virginia, on 20 November 1783. [15]\n\n\"On 17 Feb 1799 when George was 40, he second married Theodocia Dent, in Bedford Co. Virginia. Born in 1762 in Virginia.
