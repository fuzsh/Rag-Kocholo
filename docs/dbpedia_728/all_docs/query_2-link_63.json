        "text": "Circuit Court\n\nAbout\n\nThere is a circuit court in each city and county in Virginia. The circuit court is the trial court with the broadest powers in Virginia. The circuit court handles most civil cases with claims of more than $25,000. It shares authority with the general district court to hear matters involving claims between $4,500 and $25,000, and in civil cases for personal injury and wrongful death up to $50,000. The circuit court has the authority to hear serious criminal cases called felonies.\n\nThe circuit court also handles family matters, including divorce. In addition, the circuit court hears cases appealed from the general district court and from the juvenile and domestic relations district court.\n\nCircuit Courts Informational Pamphlet\n\nAll Circuit Courts\n\nIndividual Circuit Court Homepages\n\nMap of Virginiaâ€™s Judicial Circuits and Districts\n\nCase Status and Information\n\nOnline Case Information System-Statewide Search\n\nNew!
