        "text": "Get to know CWRU style.\n\nLanguage has a big impact on how people perceive Case Western Reserve University. The tonality of our language must always reflect the Case Western Reserve brand as an active, engaging, confident, forward-thinking institution. Your words should convey purposeful and thoughtful messages with strong nouns and dynamic verbs, targeted to intellectual audiences.\n\nEach individual unit can have its own personality that reflects the Case Western Reserve tone. However, there are general guidelines you should follow.\n\nNavigate our Editorial Style Guide below, or download the PDF to print and keep handy in your office.\n\nIntroduction\n\nCase Western Reserve University’s Editorial Style Guide helps writers, editors and other communication professionals across campus present ideas and information clearly and consistently. “Style” refers to an organization's guidelines for consistency in how words, phrases, typographical elements, etc., are to be used—or not used.\n\nHaving a style guide that serves as a standard puts writers, editors and other communication professionals in a strong position. It shows that the university thinks carefully about how language is used, that it is committed to professionalism and the highest standards of service to partners and clients, and that it matters how the university's message is expressed.\n\nThe university recognizes that a style guide is an evolving document and should be updated regularly. New situations, words and kinds of communications will continue to develop and will require new treatment.\n\nAuthorities\n\nConsult Webster's New World College Dictionary (merriam-webster.com), our first reference for spelling and hyphenation.\n\nTo resolve questions about style, consult this guide first. It is based on The Associated Press Stylebook (2022).\n\nGuidance for the style guide was provided by Case Western Reserve’s Flora Stone Mather Center for Women; Lesbian Gay Bisexual Transgender Center; Office of Inclusion, Diversity and Equal Opportunity; Office of Multicultural Affairs; Office of Undergraduate Admission; and University Archives.\n\nAbout the university\n\nCase Western Reserve University\n\n10900 Euclid Ave.\n\nCleveland, Ohio 44106\n\n216.368.2000\n\ncase.edu\n\nNote: Any print pieces with a return address must include the university’s address (above), including the zip code + four-digit postal code, rather than the building address.\n\nSchools (alphabetical order)\n\nCase School of Engineering\n\nCollege of Arts and Sciences (Do not use ampersand.)\n\nFrances Payne Bolton School of Nursing\n\nJack, Joseph and Morton Mandel School of Applied Social Sciences (Do not use ampersand.)\n\nSchool of Dental Medicine\n\nSchool of Graduate Studies*\n\nSchool of Law\n\nSchool of Medicine\n\nWeatherhead School of Management\n\n*An administrative unit\n\nNote: Cleveland Clinic Lerner College of Medicine at Case Western Reserve University is part of the School of Medicine.\n\nAbbreviated history\n\nWestern Reserve University, 1826–June 30, 1967:\n\nWestern Reserve College was originally established in 1826 in Hudson, Ohio. It moved to Cleveland in 1882 and became known as Adelbert College of Western Reserve University.\n\nWestern Reserve University was formally incorporated in 1884. The schools and colleges of Western Reserve University were: Adelbert College, Cleveland College, Flora Stone Mather College, School of Medicine, School of Dentistry, School of Law, Graduate School, School of Library Science, School of Applied Social Sciences, School of Nursing, School of Education, School of Pharmacy, School of Architecture, School of Business.\n\nCase Institute of Technology, 1880–June 30, 1967: Case Institute of Technology was originally established as Case School of Applied Science in 1880 in downtown Cleveland. The name changed on July 1, 1947, to Case Institute of Technology and included undergraduate and graduate divisions.\n\nCase Western Reserve University, July 1, 1967–present: Case Western Reserve University was established by the federation of Western Reserve University and Case Institute of Technology.\n\nAcademics\n\nAcademic courses\n\nCapitalize academic course titles and place in quotes.\n\nExamples: “Life of the Mind,” “Nursing Informatics,” “University Seminar,” “Face First”\n\nCourse titles also should be capitalized if a course number is used first, but in this instance, quotation marks are not required. To make it easier for readers outside of the university, spell out the name of the department rather than using the abbreviation.\n\nExamples: Mathematics 122: Calculus for Science and Engineering II, Anthropology (not ANTH) 212: Popular Culture in the United States\n\nNote: General academic subjects are not capitalized. (See the \"Academic Subjects\" entry.)\n\nAcademic degrees\n\nCapitalize full names of degrees, including the program name. Do not capitalize academic degrees in casual references when the full title of the degree is not given (e.g., a bachelor’s degree in physics).\n\nExamples:\n\nThe Bachelor of Arts in Sociology degree, the BA in Sociology, a bachelor’s in sociology\n\nThe Master of Science in Nursing degree (This degree is abbreviated MSN, with the word nursing part of the formal title.)\n\nThe Master of Arts in World Literature, the MA in World Literature, a master’s in world literature (“World Literature” is not part of the formal title of this degree, so the abbreviation would simply be MA, with “World Literature” written out.)\n\nThe Master of Healthcare Management degree, a master’s degree in healthcare management, a master’s in healthcare management\n\nNote: CWRU style is to write ”healthcare” as one word; this guideline diverges from AP Style.\n\nIf abbreviating a degree by only using its initials, do not include the word “degree.”\n\nExample: He earned a BA from Harvard. (not: He earned a BA degree from Harvard.) However, the word degree can be used in the following context: He earned a Bachelor of Science degree from Case Western Reserve University in 1972.\n\nIn line with Associated Press style, we do not include academic credentials after names in press releases and other items distributed to the media. However, if they are used in other mediums—e.g., magazine articles, recruitment materials, etc.—please note that abbreviations of academic degrees do not include periods. (This guideline diverges from AP style.)\n\nIn general, list only terminal degrees (including RN) when including credentials, and note that the degree abbreviation comes before the alumni affiliation. If someone has multiple terminal degrees (e.g., PhD, MD), list them all.\n\nExample: John Jones, PhD (GRS ’18, mechanical engineering) (not John Jones, BA, MA, etc.)\n\nWhen referring to a post-baccalaureate program or student, abbreviate it as post-bacc (or Post-bacc if it’s being used as part of someone’s title before their name).\n\nAcademic subjects\n\nDo not capitalize academic subjects, except for proper nouns such as “English” and “French.”\n\nExample: He took the required courses in economics, mathematics and English.\n\nAcademic terms\n\nLowercase academic terms.\n\nExamples: fall semester, summer session\n\nNote: It is acceptable, though not preferable, to capitalize fall, spring and summer when referring to a specific year (e.g., Fall 2022, Spring 2023)\n\nFaculty/staff\n\nFaculty and staff are groups of people. Faculty members and staff members are the people within those groups. Do not interchange the two.\n\nExamples: All faculty members are encouraged to take part in fall convocation; the university’s faculty is renowned for its research.\n\nFreshmen\n\nDo not use “freshman” or “freshmen.” Refer to students starting their undergraduate careers at the university as “first-year students.”\n\nProfessor\n\nDo not use “professor” as a synonym for “faculty member,” as the university has several faculty classifications:\n\nprofessor\n\nassociate professor\n\nassistant professor\n\nsenior instructor\n\ninstructor\n\nExamples:\n\nMary Ku, associate professor of history, will give the keynote address.\n\nJoe Wilson joined the department as a professor of history.\n\nMelody Lane is a senior instructor in the humanities.\n\nNote: Many professors hold endowed professorships, which should be named wherever possible.\n\nExample: Jonathan Adler, the Johan Verheij Memorial Professor of Law, is also the director of the Coleman P. Burke Center for Environmental Law.\n\nTitles\n\nSee the “Titles” section at the end of the guide.\n\nAlumni\n\nIdentify alumni who graduated from Case Western Reserve University (or its predecessor institutions, e.g., Adelbert College) with abbreviations of their schools and their years of graduation in parentheses after their names (an exception is to use MNO for those who earn a Master of Nonprofit Organizations degree). Follow the list of CWRU schools and pre-federation institutions for the appropriate abbreviation (full list available in Addendum 1).\n\nWhere possible and relevant to the copy, explain within the text of the article what the individual studied, if not immediately evident from the school abbreviation.\n\nExample: Sarah Snyder (CWR ’03), who studied political science and was president of Undergraduate Student Government at Case Western Reserve, was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives.\n\nDo not list graduation years from other institutions. However, if an alum earned a terminal degree (e.g., PhD, MD, JD—not a bachelor’s or, in most instances, a master’s) from another institution and you would like this included in the copy, list the terminal degree abbreviation before their CWRU alumni affiliation.\n\nExample: Alicia Ramirez, PhD (MGT '18), who earned her degree …\n\nIf a graduate has multiple degrees, add a comma between each except for those from the School of Graduate Studies, which include their areas of study; in those instances, use a semicolon to separate degrees.\n\nExample: Victor Johnson (GRS ’84, chemistry; GRS ’88, computer science)\n\nIf the graduate earns multiple degrees in the same year, list them alphabetically by the school/institution name (e.g., LAW would fall before MGT).\n\nUnless a terminal degree from an outside institution is listed alongside alumni affiliations (see above example), do not use commas around the alum’s name or affiliation parenthetical.\n\nExamples:\n\nAlfred Williams (CIT ’72, LAW ’74)\n\nMariah Martin (CWR ’97; GRS ’99, English)\n\nAyesha Gantt (MGT '82)\n\nJustin Bibb (LAW '18, MGT '18)\n\nVictor Johnson (GRS ’84, chemistry; GRS ’88, computer science)\n\nHelene Mayberry (MED ’22)\n\nHope Prevails (CWR ’04, MNO ’06)\n\nMalikah (CWR ’88) and Juan (MGT ’04) Smith\n\nMonique (LAW ‘07) and Jack Wilson\n\nChris Taylor, PhD (ADL ’66)\n\nWill Stevens ​​(CWR ’96; GRS ’00, public health nutrition) thanked his alma mater.\n\nThe Morris Center for Social Workers has named Eric Ridder (SAS '95) its new dean of students.\n\nNote: Although, strictly speaking, a person does not graduate from a school, but is graduated, we use the more commonly accepted form: He graduated from Case Western Reserve University School of Law.\n\nDistinguished Alumni Award winners\n\nDo not refer to a Distinguished Alumni Award winner as a “Distinguished Alumni.” Instead, clarify they won the award, such as:\n\nDistinguished Alumni Award Winner Alana Midori (MGT '10)\n\nAlana Midori (MGT '10), who won The Alumni Association's Distinguished Alumni Award in 2019\n\nGender references for alumni\n\nUse the format that aligns with the individual’s pronouns; if their pronouns are unknown to the writer, use gender-neutral versions of the Latin terminology:\n\nshe/her/hers: alumna (singular), alumnae (plural)\n\nhe/him/his: alumnus (singular), alumni (plural)\n\nthey/them/theirs or gender-neutral usages: alum or graduate (singular), alums or alumni (plural)\n\nHonorary degrees\n\nThe university grants honorary degrees during the convocation ceremony each year to recognize “excellence in any valued aspect of human endeavor, including the realm of scholarship, public service, and the performing arts.” Recipients are announced in May prior to the university's commencement ceremonies.\n\nExample: Use this formatting when the honorary degree recipient is an alum of the university:\n\nJane Brownfeld (CIT ‘75, HON '10) returned to Case Western Reserve University as a sociology professor in 2016.\n\nIf the person is not a CWRU alum, but it’s important to include their terminal degree(s), try to separate them by including their earned degree in the first reference and moving the honorary degree to a later sentence.\n\nExample:\n\nAfter Scott Cowen, DBA, led Tulane University through the devastation and aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in 2005, TIME magazine named him one of the nation's 10 Best College Presidents. Cowen (HON '11) served as interim president at Case Western Reserve University from 2020 to 2021.\n\nCapitalization and acronyms\n\nThe Associated Press Stylebook and Case Western Reserve favor a \"down\" style—that is, one that encourages a minimum of capitalization. When in doubt, do not capitalize.\n\nFor guidelines on capitalization in a specific instance, e.g., academic or course title, see the entry for that listing.\n\nAcronyms\n\nLimit the use of acronyms and initialisms (KSL, PBL, SOM, etc.) wherever possible, as these acronyms are unknown to those outside of campus—and often unfamiliar to those on campus. (Common non-university acronyms/initialisms—e.g., CDC, FBI, NFL—can be used as appropriate; those less common to the general public should be limited in use if possible.) When using an acronym or initialism, include it directly after the words it represents on first reference within the body copy; well-known acronyms or initialisms, such as CWRU, can be used in headlines.\n\nEvents\n\nDo not capitalize major university events (commencement, fall convocation, homecoming), unless they are official “named” events, such as the F. Joseph Callahan Distinguished Lecture.\n\nThe university’s Hudson Relays event should be capitalized, and ‘Relays’ is plural.\n\nHeadlines\n\nIn general, use sentence case (i.e., capitalize the first word, proper nouns, names of organizations and common acronyms). Some exceptions—e.g., webpage titles, magazine features—may exist.\n\nSubheadings of all articles and webpages should use sentence case.\n\nNames of regions\n\nThe university follows AP style when writing about specific regions. In those instances, capitalize words such as “greater,” “east,” “northeast,” etc.\n\nExample: “Case Western Reserve University is located in Northeast Ohio.” or “The weather in Greater Cleveland is beautiful in the fall.”\n\nDo not capitalize those words if they refer to a compass direction, such as “DiSanto Field is located on the northeast side of campus.”\n\nContact information\n\nAlways use the university's general mailing address (not building street addresses), complete with the five-digit ZIP Code and appropriate four-digit location code; use of the school name is optional:\n\nExample:\n\nCollege of Arts and Sciences\n\nCase Western Reserve University 10900 Euclid Ave.\n\nCleveland, Ohio 44106-7068\n\n216.368.2000\n\nFor a department, include the building name, room number and four-digit location code:\n\nExample:\n\nDepartment of Chemical Engineering\n\nCase Western Reserve University\n\nA.W. Smith Building, Room 116\n\n10900 Euclid Ave.\n\nCleveland, Ohio 44106-7217\n\n216.368.2000\n\nTelephone numbers\n\nFormat telephone numbers with periods. This guideline diverges from AP. Contact information should be listed and punctuated in the following order:\n\nDepartment, Office or Area\n\nCase Western Reserve University Campus building, Room number 10900 Euclid Ave.\n\nCleveland, Ohio 44106-xxxx\n\nTelephone: 216.xxx.xxxx\n\nToll-free: 800.xxx.xxxx\n\nMobile: 216.xxx.xxxx\n\nEmail: firstname.lastname@case.edu\n\nWeb: case.edu\n\nWebsites\n\nFor websites, the “http://www.” or “https://www.” prefix should not be used. The words “website,” “webpage” and “email” all are one word and lowercase.\n\nExample: The department just launched its website at case.edu/umc.\n\nNote: While case.edu is our standard URL format, all Case Western Reserve websites also function on the cwru.edu domain. The cwru.edu URLs can be used if preferred, especially in alumni-specific materials.\n\nCredits\n\nUse the following style to credit photographers:\n\nPhotograph by Julia Goldberg\n\nPhotography by Julia Goldberg (if more than one image is used)\n\nIf a subject provides a photo, use this format for the photo credit:\n\nCourtesy of Maleek Smith\n\nDiversity and representation\n\nUniversity offices recommend using the references below. When clarity is needed, ask the subject if they have a preference. For situations not outlined below, default to AP style.\n\nConditions\n\nPeople shouldn't be defined by a condition. Write in a way that puts people first by using the phrase “person with” or “person who.”\n\nExamples:\n\nA patient with COVID-19, not a COVID-19 patient\n\nA person who is homeless, not a homeless person\n\nPeople with disabilities, not disabled people\n\nA person with autism; not an autistic person\n\nA person might have a visual impairment, but that person isn’t impaired.\n\nGender and sexuality\n\nThese terms may be used when writing about a person’s gender or sexual identity, which should only be included if it is essential to the story. Refer to the LGBT Center’s FAQ page for additional information.\n\nAvoid unnecessarily gendered terms (e.g., change “chairman” to “chairperson” or “chair”).\n\nWhen a gender distinction is necessary, use gendered language (e.g., man, woman, nonbinary) as opposed to genetic sex terms (e.g., male or female). When writing about scientific studies specifically referring to male and female genetics, chromosomes, etc., male, female and intersex can be used as needed, but language such as “people assigned female/male at birth” is preferred.\n\nIf the subject of an article does not provide their pronouns, please ask.\n\n“They, them, their” may be used as a singular, gender-neutral pronoun and does not require explanation.\n\nLGBT: The university uses the term LGBT to refer to people who identify as Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and/or Transgender.\n\nNonbinary: A person who does not identify as a man or woman\n\nTransgender: An adjective referring to a person whose sex at birth does not match their gender identity (e.g., transgender man, transgender woman). Do not use transgender as a noun.\n\nRace and ethnicity\n\nThe American Sociological Association defines “race” as physical differences that groups and cultures consider socially significant, while “ethnicity” refers to shared culture, such as language, ancestry, practices, and beliefs.\n\nWhen writing about people’s race or ethnicity, ask—do not assume—how they should be identified.\n\nAsian, Asian American:\n\nNot all people of Asian descent are American (be mindful when referring to international students).\n\nAsian Americans and Pacific Islanders: Spell out the full reference (do not use the AAPI acronym with audiences outside of that community).\n\nBlack, African American:\n\nNot all people of African descent are American (be mindful when referring to international students).\n\nThe terms Black and African American are not necessarily interchangeable. In line with Associated Press style, follow a person’s preference if known, and be specific when possible and relevant.\n\nCapitalize Black and Indigenous when describing someone’s race, but lowercase white.\n\nWhen referring to students from other countries, use the term “international” instead of “foreign.”\n\nLatin-o/a/x: Default to Latine, but use the subject’s/organization’s preference if it differs.\n\nNames:\n\nInternational cultures may not use “first” and “last” names in the same way they are used in the U.S.\n\nAsk the subject to clarify how the name should be listed on first and subsequent references and whether the use of a middle name is preferred.\n\nUnderrepresented: Underrepresented students, staff, faculty or alumni are from racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic populations that are disproportionately underrepresented in higher education.\n\nUnderrepresented minorities (URM): U.S. citizens who identify as Black/African American, Hispanic/Latine, Native American or Alaska Native.\n\nUnderserved: Minority populations who are historically underrepresented can be considered underserved, most often referring to families with low income.\n\nResources\n\nConscious Style Guide\n\nThe Diversity Style Guide\n\nNational Center on Disability and Journalism\n\nUnited Nations gender-inclusive language\n\nInstitutional names\n\nThe university name\n\nCase Western Reserve University must receive at least one prominent mention in each publication.\n\n“Case Western Reserve University” should almost always be used on first reference, and “Case Western Reserve” can be used in subsequent references. In select instances, “Case Western Reserve” can be used on first reference if reference to “university” also must be used in that sentence (e.g., “Case Western Reserve will be closed today, according to university leadership.”) “CWRU” can be used in headlines, email subject lines, social media messages and other space-sensitive areas, but in editorial copy, it should be used only after the full university name has been used multiple times.\n\nDo not use “Case” or “Case Western” in copy, as these names do not represent our university’s full history. (If these names are used as part of a quote, either paraphrase or add brackets within the quote to include the full university name—e.g., “I love the professors at Case [Western Reserve], who are so knowledgeable and helpful.”)\n\nUse of “the university” (all lowercase) is acceptable in second and subsequent references in narrative copy.\n\nExample: The university was just a block away.\n\nRefrain from putting “the” in front of “Case Western Reserve University,” and limit the need to do so with subsequent school or department names.\n\nExample: She went to Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine.\n\nFor centers affiliated with the university, possessive use is a good option. Limit the use of possessives with official school names.\n\nExample: Case Western Reserve University’s Great Lakes Energy Institute is advancing initiatives in renewable energy generation.\n\nBut not: She went to Case Western Reserve University’s School of Medicine.\n\nCollege and school names\n\nOn first reference, use the full name of the university and the school.\n\nExamples: Case Western Reserve University College of Arts and Sciences, the College of Arts and Sciences at Case Western Reserve University\n\nSubsequent references in narrative copy to the “school,” “college” or “department” are acceptable and should not be capitalized.\n\nExample: The school has 700 students.\n\nAcceptable second references for schools:\n\nCase School of Engineering: School of Engineering, engineering school (not CSE or Case)\n\nCleveland Clinic Lerner College of Medicine of Case Western Reserve University: Lerner College (not CCLCM)*\n\nCollege of Arts and Sciences: the college (not CAS)\n\nFrances Payne Bolton School of Nursing: School of Nursing, nursing school (not FPB or Bolton School)\n\nJack, Joseph and Morton Mandel School of Applied Social Sciences: Mandel School (not MSASS)\n\nSchool of Dental Medicine: dental school, dental medicine school (not SODM)\n\nSchool of Graduate Studies: the school\n\nSchool of Law: law school\n\nSchool of Medicine: medical school (not SOM)\n\nWeatherhead School of Management: Weatherhead School, management school (not WSOM; Weatherhead can be used alone rarely, but Weatherhead School is preferred)\n\n*Note: Cleveland Clinic Lerner College of Medicine is not a separate school, but rather part of the School of Medicine.\n\nBuilding and office names\n\nCapitalize names of buildings and offices on first reference. Lowercase names of buildings and offices when making a general reference, which is acceptable on second and subsequent references.\n\nExamples: She works in the Office of Student Affairs. She is a counselor in the student affairs office.\n\nEach school, division and building within the university named for a person has a short name and a long name. Long names should always be used on first reference. Use shortened form on second and subsequent references. Avoid acronyms whenever possible, as these are unknown outside of campus and also unfamiliar to many within campus.\n\nRefer to the database of formal building names, if needed.\n\nExamples:\n\nHealth Education Campus of Case Western Reserve University and Cleveland Clinic on first reference; Health Education Campus on subsequent references (avoid HEC if possible)\n\nSheila and Eric Samson Pavilion on first reference; Samson Pavilion on subsequent references\n\nLarry Sears and Sally Zlotnick Sears think[box]; Sears think[box] on subsequent references\n\nKelvin Smith Library, Smith Library, the library (not KSL)\n\nGeorge S. Dively Building, Dively Building\n\nPeter B. Lewis Building of Weatherhead School of Management, Lewis Building (not PBL)\n\nSchool of Dental Medicine Dental Clinic, Case Western Reserve University’s Dental Clinic, School of Dental Medicine clinic, dental school’s clinic\n\nTinkham Veale University Center, the university center (not TVUC); can be called “The Tink” in informal context\n\nMilton and Tamar Maltz Performing Arts Center at The Temple-Tifereth Israel on first formal reference; Maltz Performing Arts Center or Maltz Center on subsequent references (not MPAC) or when constrained by space\n\nNote: CWRU housing buildings are referred to as residence halls (not ‘dorms’ or ‘dormitories’)\n\nCenter names\n\nThe university has a number of academic and research centers. Capitalize the formal name of a center on first reference. Lowercase center when making a general reference, which is acceptable on second and subsequent references.\n\nExamples:\n\nFlora Stone Mather Center for Women, the Mather Center, the center\n\nBaker-Nord Center for the Humanities, the Baker-Nord Center, the center\n\nFrederick K. Cox International Law Center, the Cox Center, the center\n\nCase Comprehensive Cancer Center, the cancer center, the center\n\nDepartment names\n\nCapitalize the formal name of a department on first reference. Lowercase “department” on second and subsequent references and when making generic references to departments. If the department name includes more than one area, use “and” instead of an ampersand (&).\n\nExamples:\n\nDepartment of Religious Studies, religious studies department\n\nDepartment of English, the English department\n\nDepartment of Mathematics, Applied Mathematics and Statistics; the mathematics, applied mathematics and statistics department\n\nNames of surrounding institutions\n\nWhen writing about other institutions, confirm the correct formatting for its name (e.g., if ‘The’ is included in the name, preferred capitalization, use of punctuation, etc.).\n\nExamples:\n\nCleveland Botanical Garden\n\nCleveland Browns\n\nCleveland Cavaliers\n\nCleveland Clinic (do not include ‘The’ in the hospital’s name)\n\nNote: Any reference to Cleveland Clinic in communications or marketing copy will require approval and should be sent to University Marketing and Communications for review.\n\nThe Cleveland Cultural Gardens\n\nCleveland Guardians\n\nCleveland Hearing & Speech Center\n\nCleveland Institute of Art\n\nCleveland Institute of Music\n\nThe Cleveland Museum of Art\n\nCleveland Museum of Natural History\n\nThe Cleveland Orchestra\n\nCleveland Sight Center\n\nKaramu House\n\nLake View Cemetery\n\nLouis Stokes Cleveland Veterans Affairs Medical Center\n\nMuseum of Contemporary Art Cleveland, moCa Cleveland\n\nThe Music Settlement\n\nNASA Glenn Research Center\n\nRock & Roll Hall of Fame\n\nRonald McDonald House Charities of Northeast Ohio Inc.\n\nToby's Plaza\n\nUniversity Circle (a geographic area) vs. University Circle Inc. (the organization responsible for the neighborhood’s development and oversight)\n\nUniversity Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center\n\nUniversity Hospitals MacDonald Women’s Hospital\n\nUniversity Hospitals Rainbow Babies & Children’s Hospital\n\nUniversity Hospitals Seidman Cancer Center\n\nUptown\n\nWade Oval\n\nWestern Reserve Historical Society\n\nNames of individuals\n\nUse full name on first reference, last name only in subsequent references. When multiple individuals with the same last name are referenced in the article, typically use first and last names, though first names can be used in more informal contexts. Defer to the individual’s personal preference regarding proper first name and inclusion of middle initials (e.g., Joseph P. Smith or Joe Smith).\n\nWhen writing about a current student, use terms such as “first-year student” or “third-year medical student” to denote their class standing, or “... who is expected to finish their MBA in 2024” to clarify their anticipated graduation year. Do not add parenthetical information [e.g. (CWR ’25) or (MGT ’24)] after their names as those references are used solely to express alumni status.\n\nWhen creating name tags for parents and family members for admissions events, follow this format: Anton Williams (Parent ‘21, ‘22).\n\nDo not use courtesy titles. See the Titles entry for rules on academic and clinical titles.\n\nPunctuation\n\nPunctuation is intended to clarify meaning and speed comprehension. Consistency is essential. The Associated Press Stylebook has a comprehensive section on punctuation. Below are examples for quick reference and a few instances where university style diverges from AP.\n\nDate/time formatting\n\nThe university follows AP style for date and time formatting.\n\nExamples:\n\nAbbreviate months with more than five letters in dates (e.g., January, February, October), but not days of the week.\n\nWednesday, Jan. 20, or Monday, March 8\n\nDon’t abbreviate dates using numbers and backslashes: Jan. 5 (not: 1/5)\n\nWhen listing the date, do not use “st,” “rd,” “th,” etc.\n\nTime of the day should be noted using “a.m.” or “p.m.”\n\nDo not include “:00” when listing a time at the top of the hour\n\nUse the word “noon” when referring to 12 p.m.\n\nDo not include space before or after the en dash (see more information below) in a time range\n\nIf you list a date and then continue the sentence, you need to add a comma after it.\n\nThe application is due Friday, July 31, so apply today.\n\nCorrect date/time style:\n\nFriday, Sept. 25, from noon to 2 p.m. or Sept. 25, noon–2 p.m.\n\n(not: Fri., September 25th, 12 PM - 2 P.M.)\n\nNote: When noting the time for an event for an external audience (e.g., alumni, general public), include the time zone (generally EDT, which begins in March, or EST, which begins in November). Time zone references are not needed in messages to the campus community.\n\nEm dash (—)\n\nThere is no space between the words and the em dash. A sentence should contain no more than two em dashes; otherwise, set off using parentheses.\n\nUse the em dash:\n\nAfter a statement of particulars, and also after a summary of particulars, although here a colon might well be used:\n\nExample: Reputation, money, friends—all were sacrificed.\n\nBefore an author's name after a quotation:\n\nExample: \"The new dean will keep the school at the forefront of higher education.\"\n\n—Julie Jones, president\n\nBefore a statement made for effect or explanation:\n\nExample: Watch your life and doctrine closely—if you do, you save yourself and your hearers.\n\nTo denote an abrupt change in thought:\n\nExample: I love his writing—but what an ego!\n\nTo emphasize a parenthetical expression:\n\nExample: In the confusion—and 50 people all standing and waving their arms created a lot of confusion—I forgot to pick up my notes.\n\nEn dash (–)\n\nThe main use of the en dash is to connect numbers; it is used to connect words less often. It signifies through, so that, for example, 1900–1995 includes 1995. There is no space between the words and the en dash.\n\nExamples:\n\n1900–1995\n\nfiscal 2021–22\n\nThe Cedar Road–SOM Center Road bus leaves at noon.\n\nCleveland beat Cincinnati 24–10.\n\nTo keep construction parallel, do not use the en dash with the word from.\n\nExample: She was enrolled from 1999 to 2004. NOT: She was enrolled from 1999–2004.\n\nNote: When noting the time for an event for an external audience (e.g., alumni, general public), include the time zone (generally EDT, which begins in March, or EST, which begins in November). Time zone references are not needed in messages to the campus community.\n\nPeriods\n\nAbbreviations of academic degrees take no periods. This guideline diverges from AP.\n\nExamples:\n\nJohn Jones, PhD\n\nPhD, LLM, MA, MBA, BS, BSc, JD, MD, MEd (See the entry on Academic degrees.)\n\nResources\n\nFor additional information about the university—including data and historical milestones— consult the following university offices:\n\nOffice of Institutional Research\n\nAdelbert Hall, Room 216\n\n216.368.2338\n\ncase.edu/ir\n\nKelvin Smith Library\n\n11055 Euclid Ave.\n\n216.368.3506\n\nasksl@case.edu\n\ncase.edu/library\n\ndigital.case.edu\n\nUniversity Archives\n\nBioEnterprise Building University West, Room 20\n\n216.368.3320\n\narchives@case.edu\n\ncase.edu/its/archives/index.htm\n\nTitles\n\nAcademic titles\n\nCapitalize when preceding names. Lowercase when standing alone or following names, except for named professorships, Distinguished University Professors and Institute Professors.\n\nExamples:\n\nThe ceremony is in honor of President Eric W. Kaler.\n\nThe president was seen often on campus.\n\nEric W. Kaler, president of the university, was seen often on campus.\n\nHe is the dean of student affairs.\n\nShe is the Herbert Henry Dow Professor of Science and Engineering.\n\nShe was named a Distinguished University Professor last fall.\n\nNote: Unless a job title spells “advisor” with an “o,” the preference is to spell it as “adviser.”\n\nClinical titles\n\nFor professors who have clinical appointments at affiliated medical centers, include primary clinical appointments along with university titles.\n\nExample: The lead author was Barbara Jackson, PhD, professor of cardiology at Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine and director of cardiology with University Hospitals Harrington Heart & Vascular Institute.\n\nCourtesy titles\n\nDo not use courtesy titles (Mr., Mrs., Miss, Ms., Dr., etc.) in editorial copy.\n\nExample: If it is necessary to note academic credentials, instead of “Dr. Smith,” use “Smith, MD,” or “Smith, PhD.”\n\nEmeriti titles\n\nEmeritus status is an honor bestowed upon retired full-time faculty members and presidents in recognition of meritorious service to Case Western Reserve University.\n\nExamples:\n\nBarbara R. Snyder, president emerita\n\nPresident Emerita Barbara R. Snyder\n\nMay L. Wykle, emerita professor of nursing\n\nAssociate Professor Emeritus of Restorative Dentistry James W. Simmelink\n\nNote: Use the format of the word that aligns with the individual’s pronouns; if their pronouns are unknown to the writer, use gender-neutral versions of the Latin terminology:\n\nshe/her/hers: emerita\n\nhe/him/his: emeritus\n\nthey/them/theirs, gender-neutral or plural usages: emeriti\n\nJudicial, military and religious titles\n\nInclude a judicial, military or religious title on first reference. In subsequent references, use only the last name.\n\nTitles of works\n\nTitles of publications and compositions should be set in italics and should have the principal words capitalized. Articles (“a,” “an” or “the”), prepositions and conjunctions should be capitalized only when they are the first or last words in a title. This guideline applies to books, magazines, newspapers, movies, TV shows, operas, plays, poems, albums, digital presentations (e.g. streaming presentations and podcasts), speeches and works of art.\n\nNote: This guideline diverges from AP style.\n\nExamples:\n\nOf Mice and Men\n\nThe Week\n\nSpartacus\n\nCBS Evening News with Norah O'Donnell\n\nDon Giovanni\n\nAngels in America\n\nThe Raven\n\nThe Dark Side of the Moon\n\nTitles of presentations and events, and titles within titles—such as the title of an article in a magazine—should be set in quotation marks. Follow the same rules for capitalizing.\n\nHis article “Genetic Modifiers of Lung Disease in Cystic Fibrosis” appeared in The New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nAddendum 1: Schools and pre-federation institutions list\n\nIdentify alumni with abbreviations of their schools and their years of graduation in parentheses after their names.
