Part 8: Miscellaneous (M) Series. Third Edition, published 1998. Entry 407, p.157.\n\nBiographical / Historical\n\nWalter Scott (1835-1890) and his brother George Arthur (1833-1895) of Rotherfield Park, Alton, Hampshire were persuaded by R G W Herbert to invest in the Valley of Lagoons, Burdekin district, Queensland.\n\nThey emigrated to Queensland in 1863, and Walter became managing partner at the end of 1864, when Arthur returned to England. In 1873 the property went over to cattle and began to pay its way. Walter became a shire councillor, J.P. and patron of the Anglican church. He died unmarried on the property in 1890."
