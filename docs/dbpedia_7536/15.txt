In Indonesia, women have been actively involved in dakwah, or Islamic preaching and propagation, since the early 20th century.

One of the pioneering figures of women’s dakwah in Indonesia was Nyai Ahmad Dahlan, the wife of the founder of Muhammadiyah, one of the largest Islamic organizations in the country. Nyai Ahmad Dahlan was known for her piety, knowledge, and social activism, and she played a key role in spreading Muhammadiyah’s teachings to women and children.

In the years following Indonesia’s independence in 1945, women’s dakwah continued to grow and diversify. Women’s organizations like Aisyiyah, the women’s wing of Muhammadiyah, and Fatayat NU, the women’s wing of Nahdlatul Ulama, another large Islamic organization, became prominent voices in the Islamic community. These organizations focused on a range of activities, from providing religious education and social services to advocating for women’s rights and empowerment.

In recent years, women’s dakwah in Indonesia has taken on new forms, particularly with the rise of social media. Many women have taken to platforms like Instagram and YouTube to share their knowledge of Islam and promote a more inclusive and progressive understanding of the religion. Some of these women have gained large followings, and their influence has helped to challenge traditional gender norms and empower women in the Muslim community.

Overall, women’s dakwah in Indonesia has played an important role in shaping the country’s Islamic landscape and promoting a more inclusive and diverse understanding of Islam. While there are still challenges and obstacles to women’s full participation in religious life, the contributions of women in dakwah have been essential in creating a more vibrant and dynamic Islamic community in Indonesia.

The Role of Women’s Organizations

In Indonesia, there are various women’s organizations that focus on dakwah activities.

One of the prominent organizations is Aisyiyah, the women’s wing of Muhammadiyah, one of the largest Islamic organizations in the country.

Other women’s organizations that are active in dakwah activities include Fatayat NU, the women’s wing of Nahdlatul Ulama, another major Islamic organization in Indonesia. Fatayat NU is known for its efforts to promote the role of women in Islamic society and to empower them through education and economic initiatives.

Apart from these large organizations, there are also many smaller women’s groups and individual activists who are involved in dakwah activities. They use various approaches to spread Islamic teachings, including social media, online classes, and community outreach programs.

Overall, women’s dakwah activities in Indonesia play an essential role in promoting Islamic teachings and values, empowering women, and strengthening community ties.
