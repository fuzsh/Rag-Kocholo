        "text": "MUHAMMADIYAH.OR.ID, YOGYAKARTA – Muhammadiyah celebrates its 114th anniversary in the month of Dhul-Hijjah 1444 H, according to the Islamic calendar. During its establishment, Muhammadiyah has contributed to this nation and universal humanity.\n\nBeing established before Indonesia’s independence, Muhammadiyah implements Islam as rahmatan lil ‘alamin (the mercy to the whole world) through tangible actions.\n\nIndeed, many Muhammadiyah figures played significant roles in this nation until the title of National Hero was bestowed upon them. They were K.H. Ahmad Dahlan, Nyai Ahmad Dahlan, Ir. Soekarno, General Soedirman, K.H. Mas Mansur, K.H. Fakhruddin, Ki Bagus Hadikusumo, Buya HAMKA, and many others.\n\n“Muhammadiyah talks less, does more,” said the Chairman of Muhammadiyah dr. Agus Taufiqurrahman in the 114th anniversary commemoration of Muhammadiyah organized by Universitas Ahmad Dahlan, Yogyakarta on Monday (June 26).\n\nMuhammadiyah always cultivates its cadres to devote themselves to developing this nation and to be able to compete globally.\n\nThus, Muhammadiyah is now seeking to internationalize its thoughts and programs. This movement has 25 Muhammadiyah special branches overseas, and some have legally been acknowledged, so they can establish charitable institutions.\n\nFor instance, in Malaysia, Muhammadiyah founded Universiti Muhammadiyah Malaysia (UMAM) in 2021, a learning center and a Qur’an teaching center. In Australia, Muhammadiyah built Muhammadiyah Australia College (MAC).\n\nAccording to dr. Agus, advancing the people and this nation means establishing centers of excellence. For example, Muhammadiyah founded Muhammadiyah-‘Aisyiyah higher education institutions to improve education and enhance the nation’s competitiveness internationally.\n\n“The centers of excellence are Muhammadiyah’s implementation of the spirit of Islam Berkemajuan (Progressive Islam),” said dr. Agus."
