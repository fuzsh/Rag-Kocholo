        "text": "The idea of feminism in Indonesia originated in the Dutch colonial period at the end of the 19th century. We saw lots of young women in the struggle against the colonialists. Besides the Idea of Feminism, a movement of Indonesian feminism emerged during the Old Order era named Gerwani (Indonesian Women&#39;s Movement), which was founded in the 1950s. The Feminism Movement in Indonesia operates in several ways. Such as organizations, institutions, writings, seminars, and various movements. The beginning of feminist interpretation in Indonesia emerged after Indonesian independence and Islamic education and literature in Indonesia. During the Old Order era, educational facilities and Islamic literature began to be institutionalized, such as the emergence of the State’s Islamic Higher Education (PTAIN) and Islamic University of Indonesia (UII). In Indonesia, the development stage of women &#39; s interpretation which emerged around the 1960s when Buya Hamka wrote Tafsir Al-Azhar and beg...\n\nReformist Muslim ideology has been perceived to liberate Muslim women from the shackles of patriarchal religious and cultural norms. This article analyzes the extent to which contemporary reformist Islamic theology influences Muslim women’s movement in the light of Muslim debates on women and gender issues. In doing so, it focuses on the case of Islamic reform by Indonesian liberal-progressive Muslims since the late New Order and its influence on the Muslim women’s movement in the country. This article argues that Islamic reform promoted by contemporary liberal-progressive Muslims has given a significant contribution to the development of Muslim women’s movement. It has laid the ground for an Islamic paradigm shift on the discourse on Islam and gender. The opening of the gate of ijtihad and respect for modernity espoused by reformist Muslims have provided tools for radical change in Islamic discourse on gender while still ground such change on an Islamic basis. It has empowered Musl...\n\nMuslim girls and women in Indonesia today enjoy a wide range of opportunities to learn about Islam, both informally in the family and community and formally through religious schools, colleges and universities. Traditional institutions for religious education mainly educated boys and young men, although some girls did attend religious schools. Over the course of the twentieth century, however, opportunities for girls and women to further their education in Islamic schools expanded significantly. Today, girls’ participation in formal religious education is equal to that of boys at the primary and secondary level, and the number of women studying at the tertiary level is rising steadily. Yet girls remain disadvantaged in religious education: many textbooks are gender-biased, and the institutional culture of schools and universities still favors men. A new generation of Indonesian Muslim feminists are challenging patriarchal religious teachings and attempting to reform the culture of religious schools and other institutions, though such change will take time.\n\nInternet has changed the way how knowledge is spread. This paper describes the spread of Muslim feminist ideas in Indonesia. It answers the questions of what constitute feminist ideas, how Muslim feminist ideas spread before and after the Digital Era and what challenges and opportunities provided by the internet that hinder and help the spread of these ideas. Muslim feminism has spread in Indonesia since the early 1990s through the translation of the works of non-Indonesian Muslim feminists such as Fatima Mernissi, Riffat Hassan, Asghar Ali Engineer and Amina Wadud. Since 2010, the increasing use of internet among Indonesians has made the spread of Muslim feminist ideas faster. However, it is challenging that conservative groups also mobilized the internet to oppose Muslim feminist ideas. Another challenge is that not all Indonesian Muslims have easy access to the internet and therefore Indonesian Muslim feminists still have to adopt various offline media such as seminars or radio to spread their ideas. [Internet telah mengubah cara penyebaran pengetahuan. Artikel ini akan menjelaskan penyebaran ide-ide feminis Muslim di Indonesia. Artikel ini akan menjawab pertanyaan tentang apa yang dimaksud dengan ide-ide feminis Muslim, bagaimana ide-ide feminis Muslim tersebar sebelum dan sesudah Era Digital dan tantangan serta kesempatan apa yang diberikan oleh internet yang menghalangi dan membantu penyebaran ide-ide ini. Feminis Muslim telah tersebar di Indonesia sejak awal tahun 1990-an melalui penerjemahan"
