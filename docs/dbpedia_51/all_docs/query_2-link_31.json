        "text": "There exists several lists of the «Filles du roi» but it is most probable that no two of them are identical because of identification criteria and sources differ between researchers. The PRDH is widely recognized for its work on the French-Canadian population of Quebec from the onset of the first permanent European settlement and it is thus normal we make our own list available.\n\nWe define the «Filles du roi» as the immigrants, single or widowed, who came to Canada between 1663 and 1673 and were presumed to have received royal support for their transportation or their settling.\n\nThis list has been essentially established on the basis of information contained in the parish registers; however, other sources were sometimes used to add or eliminate cases. Initially drawn up by Yves Landry for the needs of a historical demography study (see: Yves Landry. Orphelines en France, pionnières au Canada. Les Filles du roi au XVIIe siècle suivi d'un Répertoire biographique des Filles du roi. Montréal, Leméac, 1992. 436 p.), it has been revised in the context of the celebration of the 350th anniversary of the arrival of the first contingent by Hubert Charbonneau, in collaboration with Bertrand Desjardins.\n\nWere considered here only those Filles du roi who married and settled, given the incomplete information available for those who remained single. Based on the information at our disposal in March 2013, we arrived at a total of 727 names. But the full and certain identification of the group is never assured, because the sometimes ambiguous nature of the information makes some choices open to discussion. Thus, new information received from Mona-Andrée Rainville and Marcel Fournier has reduced our list to 711 names. We will continue to gladly accept any comment or new information which could bring us to adding or removing some names from our list.\n\nHubert Charbonneau\n\nBertrand Desjardins\n\nOctober 2014"
