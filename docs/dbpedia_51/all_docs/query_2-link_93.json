Bourgeois, the first church in the current parish of St. James was organized into a regular independent parish in 1770 at the town of St. James on the west side of the Mississippi River. The land had been donated by Jacques Cantrelle and the first church wardens were Jacques Cantrelle, Bonaventure Gaudin, Simon LeBlanc, Ambroise Martin, A. Schexnaydre and Joseph Hubert called Laprade. Francois Landry gave a golden chalice, a censer, a ciborium and a pair of candle sticks. Joseph Bourgeois donated seven pews, a holy water fount, a dais, and he built a fence around the cemetery.\n\nBy 1807, there were over 100 families on the east side of the river so a new church named St. Michel De Cantrelle was built at Convent on the east side of the River.\n\nSt. James Parish Carlin Pond [Marais Carlin] - see Grand Marais Carlin's Settlement - Founded 1808, Became the Parish Seat of St. Mary Parish in 1811 and the first incorporated town in St. Mary Parish in 1820.

LeBleu of Bordeaux, France were the first recorded Europeans to settle the area around 1781 [Note There is some confusion re Barthelemy LeBleu and Martin Camersac LeBleu who had natural children with Josette Lamirande who married Barthelemy LeBleu at Pointe Coupee in 1769]. The area they settled is now known as the LeBleu Settlement. Charles Sallier married LeBleu's daughter, Catherine. The Salliers built their home on the shell beach where Lake Charles now stands. Afterwards, the lake became known as \"Charlie's lake\". By 1860 this area was being called \"Charles Town\". Many of Charles Sallier's descendants are buied in Sallier Cemetery, near St. Patrick's Hospital.\n\nThe Rio Hondo, which flowed through Lake Charles, was later called Quelqueshue, an Indian term meaning \"Crying Eagle\", and still later, Calcasieu. On March 7, 1861, Lake Charles was incorporated as the town of Charleston, Louisiana. On March 16, 1867, Charleston, Louisiana, was incorporated into the town of Lake Charles\n\nLake Charles Chicot Noir [black stump] Jeanerette, LA\n\nJeanerette is named for its founder and first postmaster, John Jeanerette, who also operated a local tavern and store.\n\nChurch Landing\n\nWashington, LA\n\nOriginally called Church Landing because in 1774 the first church in the Opelousas Territory was built near the landing on Bayou Courtableau\n\nConcordia\n\nThe Spanish established a fort across the Mississippi River from Natchez in 1768. It was abandoned in 1779 after Galvez captured Natchez. When Gayoso de Lemos was named Commandant of the district of Natchez, he built an elegant residence on his estate across the river and named it Concordia. The name was chosen to recognize the good relations that Gayoso had established with the anglo inhabitants in the Natchez District. In 1798, Jose Vidal, Commandant of Natchez obtained a land grant on the opposite side of the river from Natchez. The new Spanish Post was named Concordia because of the proximity to Gayoso's estate. A few years later, a new parochial parish was named Concordia and the fort was renamed Vidalia.\n\nVidalia, LA & Concordia Parish Côte Aux Puces Grand Marais [Grand Mary] - a Creole unincorporated community in Iberia Parish Côte des Allemands [German Coast] Present-day St. Charles and St. John the Baptist Parishes Côte de Coiron See La Petite Anse Island\n\nCôtes Gélees [frozen hills] - see below for reason for this name and also why sites on a prairie were called île, pointe and anse.

Actual location is not determined, but from an old map it appears to have been on the west side of Bayou LaFourche, in or near the present town of Bellerose, which is six \"air\" miles southwest of Donaldsonville.\n\nn/a Cypremort Prairie Cypremort Point & Louisa\n\nDivisions of Colonial French and Spanish Louisiana\n\nIn 1721, French Colonial Louisiana was divided into nine districts: Alibamos, Mobile, Biloxi, New Orleans, Natchez, The Yazoo, Illinois, Arkansas and Natchitoches [which included Ayoyelles].\n\nIn 1769, O'Reilly abolished the old organizations and established a new political and military unit which he called the Province of Louisiana. The Province was divided into eleven districts with a Commandant who was usually taken from the army or the militia. The eleven districts [also called Posts] were: Illinois, Natchitoches, first half of the German Coast [parish of St. Charles]; second half of the German Coast [parish of St. John the Baptist], Pointe Coupee [including Avoyelles], Opelousas [included Attakapas], Iberville Coast, the Fourche of Chitimachas, Kabahan [Cabanocey], Rapides [in 1805, Avoyelles was combine with Rapides and became Rapides Country. In December 1807, the Avoyelles District of Rapides became Ayoyelles Parish] and St. Genevieve.\n\nIn 1763, The Mississippi Valley east of the river, except for New Orleans, was lost to England at the end of the French and Indian War. Galvez later recaptured Baton Rouge and the West Florida parishes. In 1803, under American Control, Louisiana was divided into the Orleans Territory and the District of Louisiana which later became all the states west of the Mississippi River. In 1805, the Orleans Territory was divided into 12 Counties [see map] and the Counties divided into Parishes in 1807. In 1812, the Orleans Territory became the State of Louisiana.\n\nCurrent State of Louisiana; Alabama, Florida and States created from the land East of the Mississippi River ceded to England in 1763 at the end of the French and Indian War; and, all States created along the Mississippi River as a result of the Louisiana Purchase in 1803.\n\nDugasville\n\nLocation of Dugasville shown on a LOUISIANA \"BAYOU TECHE GUNBOAT / PLANTATION / OBSTRUCTION\" Map - The Bayou Teche of Louisiana was a major means of travel for both the Confederate Forces and Federal Forces during the Civil War. It was also the only means of travel for many Plantation owners. This map was drawn by Captain E.B. Trinidad of the U.S. Mail Steamer \"Warren Bell\" in 1867 and identifies all of the gun-boat wrecks obstructing the Bayou Teche from the mouth of the Atchafalaya River to the town of St. Martinsville, LA. Boats such as the C.S. gun-boat \"Hart\", C.S. gun-boat \"Cotton\", and the infamous gun-boat \"Diana\" and many others are identified with their accurate location where they were sunk in the Bayou. Plantation bridges, Live Oak Trees, Steamboat Hulls, Sawmills, and many other features are also identified.

I learned from him that the garrison was in good health, although four men had died, among them two Canadians, one buccaneer, and one enlisted man for La Rochelle.\n\n\"He told me that an English corvette of ten guns, commanded by Captain Louis Bance, had entered the Mississippi and gone 25 leagues upstream, where my brother, De Bienville, with five men in two bark canoes, had come across the corvette at anchor, awaiting favorable winds to go higher upstream. My brother sent two men to tell him to immediately leave the country, which was in the possession of the king, and that, if he did not leave, he would force him to. With this he complied after talking with my brother, whom he knew from having seen him with me at Hudson Bay, where I captured this captain.\n\nEnglish Turn [commonly called St. Bernard Parish] del Espiritu Santo is the same as St. Bernard Bay Fause Riviere [False River]\n\nUpper end of Fause Riviere, old Mississippi River bed.

It was built in 1700 as a 28' square blockhouse with a half dozen cannons. Its strategic location helped the French hold this part of the river and thus the state. In 1704 or so, it was abandoned.\n\nnear Myrtle Grove, LA\n\nFort Bute - built 1766 on Bayou Manchac about 115 miles up the Mississippi River from New Orleans.

Surrendered to General Galvez on March 14, 1780 and held by the Spanish until 1813. About one-third of the fort was reconstructed at 80% scale during the 1970s. Fort Conde now serves as the official Welcome Center for the City of Mobile and visitors can explore the reconstructed walls and rooms on a daily basis. See Wikipedia Article Fort Duquesne Pittsburg, PA Fort Jackson in Plaquemines Parish\n\nThis old American military post was located on SH 23, and the west bank of the Mississippi River, 2.5 miles southeast of Triumph, about 70 miles southeast of New Orleans. It was built in 1822-1832, and occupied in 1861 by the Confederate Army. It is a large, star-shaped brick fort with a surrounding moat. It was built to protect New Orleans, but on April 18, 1862, Admiral Farragut and his fleet of 43 boats, battled the fort for over a week. New Orleans fell, the fort surrendered, and his forces occupied them.

Like Fort Toulouse, Fort Tombecbe was established to protect France's holdings from westward expansion by the British into the French colony of Louisiana. It also served as a trading post, solidifying France's relations with the Choctaws, who were the most powerful French ally in the area, and was also held by the British and the Spanish during the colonial period. See Wikipedia Article Fort Toulouse I & II on the Coosa (also called Franca choka chula, Fort des Alibamons and Fort Toulouse des Alibamons)\n\nNamed in honor of Admiral Louis Alexandre de Bourbon, the Count of Toulouse who was the dominant member of the Council of Marine which performed the function of secretary or minister of the navy and of colonies from 1715 to 1718. He was the legitimized son of King Louis XIV and Madame de Montespan. Toulouse was one of the known provinces in southern France.\n\nThe fort was established to defend French Louisiana against the incursions of Georgians and Carolinians and their Indian allies. It was referred to as Fort or Post des Alibamons or simply as aux Alibamons. It was later named Fort Jackson in honor of President Andrew Jackson.\n\nThe site of Fort Toulouse, established by the French in 1717, was near the junction of the Coosa River and the Tallapousa about 4 miles south of current-day Wetumpka, Alabama and 10 miles north of Montgomery, Alabama. In 1751, the site of the Fort was moved about 100 south of the original Fort Toulouse I. This site is known as Fort Toulouse II and it was designed by Francois Saucier in 1750. Fort Toulouse II was occupied by the French until 1763 when the territory east of the Mississippi River went to England. The soldiers and settlers from Fort Toulouse went to Mobile and then to Louisiana [most ended up in the Opelousas Post]\n\nFranklin, LA - see Carlin's Settlement above Galveztown [Villa de Galvez]\n\nOld Spanish town on the south side of the junction of Amite River and Bayou Manchac [aka Iberville River]. Settled by Anglo-Americans, 1776-78, seeking Spanish refuge during the American Revolution, and by Canary Islanders (Islenos). Named for Spanish Governor Bernardo de Galvez.\n\nSee the report dated January 15, 1779 from Galvez to Galvez [Source: Spain in the Mississippi Valley, Vol. II, Part I, pages 326-327]\n\nOn August 19, 1779, Galvez officially recognized America's independence from England and decided to help the Americans. Between August 28 and September 10, men from Galveztown captured 7 British Ships and 110 prisoners on Bayou Manchac. Galvez went on to take Fort Bute on Bayou Manchac, the Fort at Baton Rouge, and finally the Fort at Mobile. This brought West Florida back under Spanish rule. He continued battling the British until he ultimately recaptured all of Florida.\n\nOn a side note, shortly after these battles on Bayou Manchac, Galveztown was abandoned and the settlers moved to Baton Rouge. The area they settled there became known as \"Spanish Town\" and is where the Pentagon Barracks now stand. Many moved back to the Galvez Town area after the West Florida Revolution of 1810 and were assimilated into the French culture.\n\nn/a\n\nNote: The current community of Galvez is not at the same location as Galveztown.

A copy of the book is for sale - see the books page.\n\n\"...When old Kaskaskia was founded on the west bank of the Kaskaskia the Mississippi was about two miles to the west. The stretch between the two rivers was alluvium and subject to continuing erosion and inundation.\n\nIn 1844 the Mississippi boiled out of its banks, but didn't reach Kaskaskia. It did cause the Kaskaskia river to back up to the point where its waters were eight feet deep in the streets.\n\nBy 1881 the Mississippi had come within 400 feet of the Kaskaskia river. The little town was caught in a squeeze. In April of that year the Mississippi broke through just above Kaskaskia. The .bed of the little river wasn't large enough to hold a fraction of the Mississippi's current, and the flooding was total.\n\nThe Mississippi all but abandoned its loop around the old town, and the new channel went down the Kaskaskia. Within a few years the inhabitants of old Kaskaskia had gone to the high ground in the middle of the peninsula - their old homes had gone permanently beneath the Mississippi.\n\nOld residents can recall rowing over the site of the old town and seeing wells and other stone structures looming beneath the muddy waters....\"\n\nVillage of Kaskaskia [historical landmark] in Randolph County, Illinois\n\nFort Massac [Massiac]\n\nFort Massac (1757-1764, 1794-1817, 1850-1864) - First established by the French in 1757 as Fort Ascension.

Note: The Olivier Plantation Store is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.\n\nIn 1898, Jules Olivier went into partnership with Willie Patout to open the store, originally serving primarily as a plantation commissary. Olivier bought Patout out of the store in 1902. There was a race track across the road from the store.\n\nThe Franklin and Abbeville Railroad ran nearby, and a narrow gauge tram was used to haul sugar cane from Lydia Plantation to Patoutville.\n\nEarly family names in the area included Boutte, Broussard, Winters, Romero, Landry, Duplantis, Bonin, Labiche, Hebert, Dorsey, Boudreaux, Lancon, Charpentier, and others.\n\nThe current community of Lydia developed primarily in the early 1970s, when the Morton Salt Co. abandoned the company town at Weeks Island and gave workers the opportunity to buy their company-owned houses and move them at company expense to lots at Lydia and other locations nearby.\n\nLydia\n\nNote: St. Nicholas Catholic Church was founded in Patoutville in 1868 and moved to Lydia in the 1960's.\n\nMalbrough Settlement [Vacherie, p. 504] Shriever, LA\n\nMarais Carlin [Carlin Pond], Grand Marais [Big Pond]\n\nDelcambre, LA\n\nThe Post Office serving Delcambre was previously called Peigneur & Gregg.

He is on the Census of the Acadian Coast of Sept. 14, 1769. In 1774, he petitioned the Governor to return to Attakapas. Records show his location as La Pointe and La Grande Pointe. He bought land form Jean François Ledée, a wealthy New Orleans merchant who had acquired the land as a French land grant. By 1774, Breaux's branding iron was registered, and by 1786 he was one of the largest property owners in the Bayou Teche country.\n\nIn 1799, Breaux built a footbridge across the Bayou Teche to help ease the passage for his family and neighbors. This first bridge was a suspension footbridge, likely made of rope and small planks. It was stabilized by being tied to small pilings located at each end of the bridge, as well as to a pair of huge live oak trees on both sides of the bayou. When traveling directions were given, residents would often instruct people to \"go to Breaux's bridge...\", which eventually was adopted as the city's name.\n\nIn 1817, Firmin's son Agricole built the first vehicular bridge, allowing for the passage of wagons and increased commerce in the area. The town received its official founding in 1829 when Scholastique Picou Breaux, Agricole's widow, drew up a plan called Plan de la Ville Du Pont des Breaux for the city and began developing the property by selling lots to other Acadian settlers. A church parish was created in 1847 and in 1859, Breaux Bridge was officially incorporated.\n\nIn 1959, the Louisiana legislature officially designated Breaux Bridge as \"la capitale Mondiale de l'ecrevisse\" (\"the Crawfish Capital of the World\")\n\nBreaux Bridge Port Barre\n\nIn 1765 Charles Barre bought 8800 arpents from Jacque Guillaume Courtableau, 1st Commandant, Opelousas Post.
