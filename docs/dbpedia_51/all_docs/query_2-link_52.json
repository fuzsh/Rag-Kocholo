        "text": "Nick Wormley\n\nunread,\n\nto\n\nI have written the following article to summarize research by myself and my brother in an attempt to determine the origin of the Crispin family, who were among the most important land-holders and knights in Normandy both before and after the Conquest.\n\nWe have spent a lot of time on this and feel it highlights some information that does not seem to have been brought to public attention previously. However, we are not historical academics, just amateur enthusiasts, and we will gratefully appreciate any comments, corrections or further ideas that might be offered in response. Thank you very much if you can help to further our project in any way.\n\nThe Origins of the Crispin Family\n\nThe first known member of the Crispin family was Gilbert Crispin I, lord of Tillieres and of lands near Lisieux, in Normandy. He lived from about 1,000 to 1045 or so AD and was an important member of the ruling class in Normandy. His probable descendant, Milo Crispin, wrote that Gilbert was “of renowned origin and nobility”. Anselm, who was the Archbishop of Canterbury from 1093 to 1109, said that the Crispins were “rich and of the first nobility of Normandy”.\n\nUnfortunately neither of them elaborated on these statements and it is not clear who Gilbert Crispin’s parents or ancestors were. He is wrongly and repeatedly confused in many websites and books with Gilbert Count of Brionne – frequent statements that they were one and the same man are very unlikely to be correct, as they had different children and lived in different places!\n\nGilbert was supposedly nicknamed Crispin because he had spikey, brush-like hair. He was first mentioned in Duke Richard II’s entourage at Fecamp in 1025. In that year he was a witness to ducal confirmation of the foundation of Berney Abbey, between Lisieux and Brionne.\n\nDuke Robert I put him in charge of Tillieres Castle between 1027 and 1034, and another frontier fortress at nearby Damville, to help defend the Norman border against invasion by the king of France 1,000 years ago. Gilbert defended Tillieres doggedly against King Henri of France in 1040, and only surrendered when he was personally ordered to by the young Duke William, who was later to become William the Conquerer and king of England.\n\nGilbert Crispin I and his wife Gunnor had children named Gilbert, William, Robert, Emma, Hesilia, nearly certainly Miles, and possibly Ralph.\n\nThe eldest son, Gilbert Crispin II, succeeded his father as the castellan of Tillieres. He, William and Miles are believed to have all fought at Hastings.\n\nEnglish genealogist Michael Stanhope, an expert in medieval family connections, has theorised that Gilbert Crispin I might have been the son of Gilbert de Brionne and a concubine. Gilbert de Brionne’s father was Geoffrey/Godfrey Count of Eu.\n\nAn alternative possibility is that Gilbert Crispin’s father was Geoffrey’s brother Guillaume d’Eu, Duke Richard II, or one of their cousins. Geoffrey and Guillaume were illegitimate sons of Duke Richard I of Normandy, so if any of these suggested relationships was correct, Gilbert Crispin would be directly descended paternally from the first three Dukes of Normandy. His grandfather or great grandfather would be Richard “The Fearless”, son of Duke William I – “called William Longsword”, who in turn was the son of Rollo the Viking, founder of Normandy at the beginning of the 10th Century.\n\nGeoffrey and William d’Eu’s half-sister, Emma, was married to two pre-conquest kings of England – firstly Aethelred the Unready and secondly Cnut. She was also mother of the last Anglo Saxon king but one, Edward the Confessor. William the Conquerer’s claim to the English throne stemmed from this.\n\nTherefore, Gilbert Crispin I may have been a 2nd cousin of both Duke Robert of Normandy (William the Conquerer’s father), and of King Edward the Confessor of England. Or alternatively, if he was an illegitimate son of Duke Richard II, he would have been Duke Robert’s half-brother and one of the Conquerer’s uncles.\n\nIf we could be certain that one of these hypothese was correct we would start the Crispin pedigree as follows:\n\n1.Rollo the Viking, who may have come from Denmark or Norway, and led Viking raids in northern France at the end of the 9th Century. He was effectively the first “Duke” of Normandy, although at that time he was only styled Comte (Count) de Normandie. He married Poppa, daughter of Berengar, Comte de Bayeux. Rollo died before 933.\n\n1.1 Guillaume (William) I, the second Duke of Normandy. Son of Rollo, born at Rouen c.900-905, and known as William “Longsword”. His first wife (or concubine) was called Sprota – “a noble Danish girl”. He was murdered in December 942.\n\n1.1.1 Richard I, third Duke of Normandy, son of William and Sprota. Born at Fecamp in 932, and buried there on November 20th, 996. Known as Richard “The Fearless”. He married, secondly, Gunnor, of a noble Danish family, who had previously been his mistress. Their children included Duke Richard II of Normandy and Robert, the Archbishop of Rouen. One of their great grandsons was William the Conquerer.\n\nThen, possibly, Duke Richard II, Geoffrey/Godfrey d’Eu, or perhaps his younger brother/half-brother William d’Eu,or one of their cousins. Geoffrey and William were illegitimate children of Duke Richard I, but by a different mistress to Gunnor.\n\nPlus, maybe an additional generation, such as Gilbert de Brionne, who was the son of Geoffrey d’Eu – or, again, one of his cousins. Geoffrey was the Comte de Brionne from c.996 to his death in 1015. Gilbert de Brionne was born about 980 to 1000AD.\n\n1.1.1.?.? Gilbert Crispin I.\n\nThis is all quite plausible and indeed likely. But in truth, not enough detail is known about the Norman aristocratic families of that time to confirm this hypothesis – or to propose any definite alternative Crispin descent from the ducal family through a daughter, or through a half-bloodline (step-children by re-marriages or half-brothers and sisters through illegitimacy involving mistresses). However, this may well have happened, even though we are unlikely to ever know.\n\nThe honest reality is that a large part of what is presented in history books and numerous websites as historical fact from those centuries has been innocently accepted and copied from unreliable sources. Much of this information is probably inaccurate to some degree, assumed, guessed or simply invented by monks and chroniclers to please their medieval patrons. None of the contemporary 11th and 12th century Norman authors and recorders – such as Dudo of Saint-Quentin, William of Jumieges, Orderic Vitalis, Robert de Torigni or Master Wace – are fully trustworthy by modern standards of accuracy. They wrote what they were told by various informants, sometimes decades, even a century and a half, after the events, or what they thought was probably true, long before official birth, death and marriage records, and neutral news reporting came into existence.\n\nIt is also very likely that some of the key people in this story are missing – just no longer recorded and invisible to us. There might have been other brothers or sisters, younger sons and daughters, nieces, nephews, in-laws and cousins, forgotten by history.\n\nHowever, there is one compelling piece of evidence in a Norman charter, written about 960 years ago, that strongly encourages us to support the view that the Crispins were descended from the first three dukes of Normandy – and very possibly also the fourth.\n\nSee a Norman legal document from the French archives, in wonderful condition for 960 years of age, at:\n\nhttp://www.cn-telma.fr/originaux/charte2704/\n\nThis charter is dated about 1054 to 1060. Gilbert Crispin II gives to Jumieges Abbey the fief (village) of Hauville, which he holds of Duke William. He receives back in return £200 in silver, a horse and 2 ounces of gold.\n\nHauville is beside the River Seine, next door to Jumieges, which is close to Rouen and to Brionne. It is also just north of Montfort-sur-Risle, Le Bec Hellouine, Le Theil Nolent, Plainville, Drucourt and other places held by the Crispins or connected to them through marriage or grants. This says that this area was just as much “home” to the Crispins in the 11th century as Tillieres was.\n\nAt the bottom of this charter, the first cross was made by Gilbert Crispin II as his mark (signature). Next to this is the cross written by his wife (not named). Then, the cross immediately following theirs was written by William Count of Normandy (soon to become William the Conquerer, king of England). Undoubtedly, they stood in the same room beside each other and must have chatted together while this business was being transacted, probably at Jumieges Abbey. It helps to support the idea that they might have been related – perhaps cousins.\n\nThere is an important suggestion of this in the charter. In those days, giving a charitable donation to a religious institution was partly viewed as making a deal with God. In return for his generosity to Jumieges Abbey, Gilbert Crispin II asked the monks to pray for God’s kindness towards the souls of his parents, wife and children, his lord Duke William, and of RICHARD THE GREAT PRINCE. This meant either Duke Richard I of Normandy (933-996), or his eldest son Duke Richard II, who died in 1026. Both were referred to in Norman writings as “the great prince”.\n\nBoth Richards died a long time before the 1054 charter, and whichever was intended in it, we wonder why his name was included, in first place, on Gilbert Crispin’s request list for God’s mercy. Such things were taken very seriously by medieval minds. Everybody believed in Heaven and Hell, and people were fully convinced in those times that the power of prayer would speed them through the torment of purgatory to eternal heavenly happiness. The more prayers that were said the better.\n\nPro anima clauses asking for prayers to be said for loved-ones’ souls were nearly always confined to close family members, including the donor’s parents, but almost never anybody prior to them, except for sometimes within the all-embracing phrase “my ancestors”. Naming somebody from outside the donor’s family who had lived four or five generations earlier would be highly unusual, almost unprecedented.\n\n“The Falaise Roll”, page 137, claims that Richard I was named here because he was Gilbert Crispin’s great grandfather. Perhaps this book might have been muddling up Gilbert Crispin with Gilbert de Brionne, which happens frequently, but nevertheless its conclusion looks correct if Gilbert de Brionne was his father.\n\nOn the other hand, it is perhaps more likely that the Jumieges charter meant Duke Richard II, as he was closer in time to the first Crispin and was the ruler of Normandy when Gilbert was a young man. According to historian Elizabeth Van Houts, Richard II had a number of illegitimate children by several unidentified mistresses, and it seems very feasible that Gilbert Crispin I might have been one of them. If he was, then Duke Richard II would have been Gilbert Crispin II’s grandfather – a seemingly perfect explanation for the pro-anima clause.\n\nThe wording of this charter does clearly imply that the Crispin family was probably descended from “Richard the Great Prince”. It feels as though Gilbert Crispin may have purposely mentioned him to make a political public statement about the importance of his family connections. If so then his earliest-known ancestor was indeed Rollo the Viking.\n\nA similar example is shown on page 29 of Oxford University historian Dr Katherine Keats-Rohan’s book “Domesday People”. She wrote:\n\n“Sometime between 1100 and 1107, Roger Bigod and his wife Adelisa (de Tosny) gave a charter for Rochester Priory……….\n\nThe charter contains a highly-unusual pro anima clause for Norman the Sheriff, who was their Domesday (1086 ie 14 to 21 years earlier) antecessor in the manors granted and Roger’s predecessor as Sheriff.\n\nThe NORMAL EXPLANATION for this pro anima clause would be A RELATIONSHIP between Roger’s family and Norman, who is usually assumed to have been an Englishman”.\n\nSo Dr Keats-Rohan confirms that when a prayer request was made for a person who had lived at some time in the past, and who was not obviously a member of the donor’s family, IT NORMALLY MEANT THAT IN FACT THEY WERE INDEED RELATED.\n\nPresumably the same explanation would apply in the case of Gilbert Crispin II making a prayer request for Duke Richard – who must surely have been his ancestor?\n\nGilbert Crispin I held Tillieres as a vassal of Gilbert de Brionne, and Gilbert Crispin II also held the fortress at Damville as a vassal of Brionne’s eldest legitimate son Richard FitzGilbert (alias de Bienfait and de Clare). Before then, the Crispin’s earliest-known land holdings appear to have been a number of villages near Lisieux, which were all owned by Gilbert de Brionne or his father Godfrey. Ancient charters show that Gilbert Crispin’s second son William was a vassal of the Count of Brionne at Livarot, Blangy, Strapigney, Bournainville, le Mesnil-Hubert and Druicort. Interestingly, Gilbert Crispin I and/or II also owned a mill on the outskirts of Brionne, probably within sight of the town’s castle, later donating it to nearby Bec Abbey. This all indicates a strong, early connection between the Crispins and Gilbert de Brionne, certainly in the time when Gilbert Crispin I was a young man. It certainly suggests that he might have been Brionne’s illegitimate son or cousin.\n\nThere is one fly in the ointment when hypothesising a Crispin descent from Gilbert de Brionne’s family. But we also have two potential solutions to get round it:\n\nA Raoul de Telgers is said, in an ancient chronicle, to have married a daughter of Richard de Bienfait (Clare), son of Gilbert de Brionne. “Telgers” is thought to have been a Norman-Latin way of writing Tillieres, so he may have been a member of the Crispin family who lived there. He could have been Radulfus Crispinus, who witnessed a charter before 1066. If so, this would be an impediment to the idea that the Crispins were descended from Geoffrey or William d’Eu, because a Crispin son and a Brionne/Eu daughter would be close cousins and so not permitted to marry by the Church.\n\nIf it was Ralph Crispin who married Bienfait’s daughter, thus showing that Gilbert Crispin I could not have been a son of the Counts of Brionne or Eu, there is one other possibility that nevertheless could still make the Crispin family descendants of Duke Richard I. Gilbert Crispin I’s wife was called Gunnor, but it isn’t clearly proved whether she was Gunnor d’Aunou or Gunnor d’Anet. These two ladies have pretty certainly been confounded long ago. Gunnor d’Aunou was a close relative of Gilbert de Brionne and granddaughter or great granddaughter of Duke Richard. So if she was the Crispins’ matriarch, then Gilbert Crispin II’s pro-anima request for the soul of Richard the Great Prince might just have been made because he was descended from the ducal line through his mother, not through his father…..\n\nAlternatively, however, Raoul de Telgers is very likely to have been Raoul de la Cunelle, a vassal of the Crispins who held some land in Tillieres, and he might perhaps have been identified in this instance by the Tillieres toponym. Raoul de la Cunelle would be perfectly suitable to marry into the Bienfait/Clare family – he was a great grandson of Ralph d’Ivry and so part of the nobility and the right kinship grouping. He shared a common ancestor with Richard de Bienfait in Duchess Sprota, making them third cousins, but this should have just scraped past the Church consanguinity regulations so a marriage between their families would be legal. Finally, Raoul de la Cunelle was Gunnor d’Anet’s first cousin, possibly once removed, so he was probably a relative of the Crispins in the same social class.\n\nRichard de Bienfait ratified a religious donation of land by Raoul de la Cunelle, so clearly they knew each other.\n\nAlthough there is good evidence that the Crispins were most probably direct descendants of Rollo the Viking, William “Longsword and Duke Richard “The Fearless”, it is not firm proof. So various possible alternatives should also be considered.\n\nAnother suggested pedigree in older books, and slavishly repeated on the internet, has Gilbert Crispin as a son of Crespin Ansgot de Bec and Heloise de Guines. This is a long-standing, traditional belief, which would make him the grandson of Guillaume de Bec (c.918 to 1000AD) and Bertha de Vermandois. His great grandparents would thus be Hrolf Turstain (a nephew of Rollo) and Gerlotte de Blois.\n\nThis version of events contains a difficulty, however, because it shows Gilbert as a brother of Herluin, Abbot of Bec, which seems unlikely because Gilbert Crispin was not named in Ansgot’s sons’ inheritance. A 19th Century embellishment involving “Crispina daughter of Rollo” marrying Grimaldi of Monaco is pretty certainly an invention.\n\nA broader family tree, through the wives and mothers of these men, would bring the Holy Roman Emperor Charlemagne, early kings of France and King Alfred the Great of England into Gilbert Crispin’s list of ancestors.\n\nA suggested Crispin descent from Ansgot apparently dates right back to the late 1000s, when William of Jumieges is said to have written that the first Gilbert Crispin and Herluin de Bec, who founded the Abbey of Bec in 1034, were both sons of Ansgoth and Heloise. Herluin described himself in a charter as a son of Ansgot.\n\n(I might be misunderstanding this slightly: I haven’t seen William’s actual wording, and perhaps Gilbert Crispin being a brother of Herluin may have been a later assumption, simply based on the Crispins’ generous donations to Bec Abbey).\n\nBut 70 or 80 years later another chronicler of Norman families, Orderic Vitalis, seems to have implied that Gilbert Crispin was in fact Gilbert de Brionne – overlord of Herluin – again, this might have been a later assumption, and this idea is now discredited.\n\nNeither of these beliefs was known to Miles Crispin, the monk at Bec Abbey and clearly a younger member of the same Crispin family, who in the early 1100s wrote in Latin “On the Origins of the Noble Crispins”. He claimed that Gilbert of Tillieres was the first to bear the name Crispin and although “of renowned origin and nobility”, that he founded the Crispin line.\n\nObviously, Gilbert I didn’t spring spontaneously out of the ground, but we can see that the very earliest writings show conflicting ideas about his parents.\n\nGilles Andre de la Roque listed these possibilities in his (heavily-criticised) book “Histoire Genealogique de la Maison de Harcourt”, in 1662, seeming to come to the view that the “house of Bec-Crespin” descended from “Ansgoth de Bec-Crespin”, he being the father of the first Gilbert Crespin.\n\nOne of the Crispin family’s large and widespread possessions in Normandy was the barony of Bec-Crespin, which was an area surrounding the chateau of Bec-Crespin, a few miles north of Le Havre, close to the town of Montivilliers. They held this castle and title from very early times – probably from the lifetime of Gilbert Crispin IV, in the mid 1100s, onwards, but whether any earlier than that is unclear. Our guess is that it was named after its Crispin family owners, but not necessarily right at the beginning of the dynasty.\n\nThere are a number of places called Bec in Normandy, just as there are many Becks in northern England. It was just a locational name, of Viking origin, for somewhere with a stream.\n\nThe Abbey of Bec is at a completely different place to Chateau du Bec-Crespin – a long way to the south west near the town of Brionne – so it would be a mistake to link Herluin of Bec Abbey to any Crispin of Bec Crespin castle simply through the word Bec. Yet, past antiquarians seem to have done just that and muddled these two places up, wrongly connecting Ansgot to Bec Crespin?\n\nIn the same way, there is also some historical evidence associating Ralph de Bec (another supposed son of Ansgot and brother of Gilbert Crispin I according to an early source) with other places named Bec near Fecamp – le Bec au Cauchois, and Bec-de-Mortagne – 20 or more miles further north than Bec-Crespin castle. One of Ralph de Bec’s sons was Walter de Bec-au-Cauchois, so Ralph seems unlikely to have been of the same family as Gilbert Crispin, whose descendants owned Bec-Crespin.\n\nPast confusion about various places called Bec probably muddied the water about the Crispins’ origins. Ansgoth feels dubious.\n\nMaybe, however, the Ansgoth version of events is partially true. Perhaps, just guessing, Heloise and Ansgoth might have been part of the family of, or were related in some way even if only through marriage, to Godfrey d’Eu and his son Gilbert de Brionne. One of Michael Stanhope’s suggestions is that, just possibly, Heloise was a sister of Gilbert de Brionne and her son Herluin, Abbot of Bec, was Brionne’s nephew. This would make Ansgoth and Heloise Gilbert Crispin’s relatives, but the exact relationship having been garbled during later centuries……?\n\nThe Crispins were clearly part of a kinship network involving several top aristocratic families, particularly the d’Ivry family, the de Crepon family and a branch of the ducal family through Geoffrey d’Eu. This implies relationships between these families: kinship connections were a seriously important part of Norman culture, binding land-owning families closely together for many generations through repeated, arranged inter-marriages. This strengthened and protected them in a violent, turbulent age. No-one in the higher levels of society could just marry who they fancied – that would have been completely unthinkable.\n\nOne likely suggestion is that the Crispins may have originated in the Crepon family. The monk called Milo Crispin, writing a century after the time of Gilbert Crispin I, said that Gilbert was given the nickname Crispin from the Latin phrase pinus crispinus – meaning he had bristly hair that stuck out like pine needles. It is probably true, but just maybe this tale was instead a bit of invented family folklore…?\n\nPerhaps Crepon/Crespon/Crespin/Crispin are all one and the same name?\n\nCrispin is written Crespin in French, and the village and family name Crepon was sometimes also written as Crespon.\n\nAndré La Fresnaye, in the “Nouvelle Histoire de Normandie”, p. 110, 1814, called the commander of Tillieres castle Guillebert de CRESPON. Another French history book, “Revue de Rouen et de Normandie”, Volume 13, p. 268, 1845, called Osborn de Crepon, Ralph d’Ivry’s son-in-law, Osbern de CRESPON. Of course, there was great variation in historical spellings, but even so these examples make it worthy of consideration.\n\nThe authors of a history book called “The Falaise Roll”, Mordecai Jackson Crispin and Leonce Macary , noted this on page 138: “….while there is nothing known on record to indicate that Crispin and Crepon may have been the same name, they are nevertheless very similar”.\n\nOn the other hand, Gilbert de Brionne appears to have also been called Crispin in the past, which has caused great confusion for centuries. Many books and websites still wrongly claim that he and Gilbert Crispin I were the same man. Gilbert de Brionne is not thought to have been a member of Osbern de Crepon’s family, but there might have been a Crepon wife or mother in his unclear maternal ancestry. If so, either of these Gilberts might possibly have taken the name Crispin from their mother’s family.\n\nOther evidence of Crispin kinship connections with these families includes the close association of their names in a number of ancient Norman charters.\n\nIn one, a gift of land by Gilbert Crispin II to Jumieges Abbey was witnessed by William FitzOsborn and Hugh d’Ivry. In another, Robert Crispin witnessed a gift to the Abbey of Saint-Ouen in Rouen by Osborn de Crepon, along with William FitzOsborn and Count William and Countess Mathilda (future king and queen of England).\n\nGilbert Crispin II with his sons, plus Guillaume de Breteuil and Roger de Bienfait, all confirmed a gift of land at Guernanville in Normandy by Gilbert Crispin and William FitzOsborn’s sub-tenant there. Gilbert Crispin and William FitzOsborn had apparently inherited this place from Bishop Hugh d’Ivry, although more likely through Hugh’s sister Emma, William FitzOsborn’s mother. (It is not impossible that Hugh might have been Gilbert Crispin’s father).\n\nSome years later, William Crispin, William de Breteuil and Roger de Bienfait combined together again to oppose Robert, Count of Meulan, claiming the abbey of Bec as part of his demesne lands.\n\nOsborn de Crepon and Gilbert de Brionne were two of William the Conquerer’s guardians who protected him after the early death of his father, while he was still a boy. Osborn and Gilbert were clearly both part of the Crispin “kinship network”, although probably only related to each other by marriage, (Osborn was probably Gilbert Crispin’s wife’s uncle).\n\nThis all implies that these families were inter-related, but does not reveal the Crispins’ origin.\n\nMichael Stanhope has no doubts about the importance of these kinship links. He says: “The main point to me about early charters of other people that the Crispins witnessed is a link to the FitzOsborn family, that is, to the d’Ivris. Prevost was unable to offer an explanation for this. The general answer is that Gilbert Crispin or his father was at least intermarried into the ducal circle, or was a family member. It had to be a close relationship, because the entire defence of the Norman border was placed in the hands of the Crispins; such a role would have usually only been given to a blood relative.”\n\nIllegitimate ducal children could turn out to be difficult and dangerous to their legitimate siblings, and Van Houts says they were often given important clerical or secular roles to keep everybody happy. Perhaps this might explain why Gilbert Crispin was given the job of defending the Norman border at Tillieres castle as a successor to the Tosnys and Neil Saint-Sauvieur?\n\nAnother suggestion is that Gilbert Crispin I may have been a son of Harfast or Herfast, brother of Duchess Gunnor who married Duke Richard I of Normandy. This is a plausible idea.\n\nIt has been speculated that Harfast and Gunnor might have been children of the Danish king Harald Bluetooth or Blåtand, c.910 to c.987, but there is no sound evidence for this. It is clear, however, that they came from the Cotentin peninsular of Normandy, which was settled by a second wave of Vikings, probably from Denmark, around the time they were born.\n\nHarfast had a powerful son Osborn de Crepon, who was seneschal to William the Conquerer and who married Emma, daughter of Ralph d’Ivry (half-brother of Duke Richard I). These people were the Crepon family and there is much to support this conjecture as being quite possibly the solution. It would certainly explain the Crispins’ close association to the Crepons and the d’Ivrys if they were part of the same family.\n\nFor example, if Harfast was Gilbert Crispin’s father, then Gilbert would have been a 1st cousin of Duke Richard II. Gilbert Crispin II would therefore be a second cousin of Duke Robert, and also be a 1st cousin of William FitzOsborn, who was Hugh d’Ivry’s nephew. This might explain why they both held land that had previously belonged to Bishop Hugh.\n\nAnd if Gilbert Crispin I was a son of Harfast, he would thus be a brother of Osborn de Crepon. So Osborn’s daughter who married Baldwin de Meules and Exeter, younger son of Gilbert de Brionne, would have been Gilbert Crispin’s neice. …..A series of purely hypothetical possible relationships that would link all of these families together nicely!\n\nBut, if the Crispins were not part of the Crepon family, these links could instead be explained by Gilbert Crispin’s wife Gunnor, being Gunnor d’Anet, daughter of Osmund de Conteville, as she was Osborn de Crepon’s niece. However, Gilbert Crispin couldn’t have married her if he was a Crepon too, because they would have been close cousins and this was prohibited by Church consanguinity rules. If that was the case, then his wife must have been Gunnor d’Alnou instead, daughter of Baldric the Teuton.\n\nOn the other hand, it has been claimed that Baldric the Teuton’s wife was Alix, a sister of Gilbert de Brionne. So if Alix was Gunnor d’Anou’s mother then Gunnor would have been Gilbert de Brionne’s niece – meaning Gilbert Crispin couldn’t have married her either if he was a son of Gilbert de Brionne and therefore they were first cousins!\n\nTake your pick….. If Gilbert Crispin I married Gunnor d’Anet then presumably he wasn’t a Crepon. If instead he married Gunnor d’Aunou then he wasn’t a Brionne.\n\nEither of these two Gunnors might have been his wife, and one or the other must have been the subject of confusion by past antiquarians. Michael Stanhope and I both favour Gunnor d’Anet being correct, because for the next few generations the Crispin family had close associations with members of her family, but few with the descendants of Gunnor d’Aunou’s relatives. This is a significant sign, since continuing close kinship connections like this were very important in medieval family life and culture. It makes Gunnor d’ANET the strong favourite.\n\nFinally, another medieval genealogy writer, Michael Harris, suggested in 2012 that the first Gilbert Crispin might have been a son of Viscount Erchembald, who was closely connected in some unclear way with Osborn de Crepon. (Maybe they were half-brothers, or might perhaps Erchembald have married a sister of Osborn – or a sister of Osborn’s wife, Emma d’Ivri, thus attaining land in Celloville?).\n\nThis sounds a good theory, because Erchembald definitely had a son named Gilbert, who was badly wounded defending Osborn against his assassins in 1040. But although very plausible it has its pros and cons – as do all of the other ideas for the origins of the Crispins.\n\nIt’s a tangled web and many jigsaw pieces have been lost.\n\nPerhaps the French historian Astrid Lemoine-Descourtieux was right in thinking that Gilbert Crispin I’s parents might not have been amongst the highest level of the Norman nobility: that it was mainly Gilbert’s fighting skills that suddenly brought the family greater power in the early 11th century and propelled them to the top level…. As the Crispins’ early biographer, Milo Crispin of Bec abbey, apparently did not know who Gilbert’s parents were, maybe they were not famous names in the 900s. After all, historian David Douglas emphasized in his writings that a whole new nobility came into existence in the duchy in that ruthless and turbulent period of invasions and rebellions, particularly in the first quarter of the 1000s.\n\nSo at the end of this very long discussion, we can still only begin the Crispin family pedigree with Gilbert Crispin I….. although we strongly favour the evidence that he was probably a direct descendant of Duke Richard I, and maybe an illegitimate son of Duke Richard II.\n\nThe motto for anybody seriously studying family origins back as far as Norman times should be: “Take nothing on trust – question everything!”\n\nNick Wormley, February 2019.\n\ntaf\n\nunread,\n\nto\n\n[very long post, so I have deleted a lot without comment.\n\nOn Sunday, February 3, 2019 at 9:51:41 AM UTC-8, Nick Wormley wrote:\n\n> English genealogist Michael Stanhope, an expert in medieval family\n\n> connections, has theorised that Gilbert Crispin I might have been\n\n> the son of Gilbert de Brionne and a concubine.

It takes more than just knowing that a man had illegitimate children to hypothesize your man was one of these, particularly when no primary document indicates there was any relationship.\n\n> The wording of this charter does clearly imply that the Crispin\n\n> family was probably descended from “Richard the Great Prince”.\n\nWhich wording is that?\n\n> It feels as though Gilbert Crispin may have purposely mentioned him\n\n> to make a political public statement about the importance of his family\n\n> connections.\n\nGiven that he follows William, whose family connection to Richard is the relevant one?

I very much doubt that Crespin Asgot de Bec even existed, as such, and the same for Heloise de Guines and Guillaume de Bec. There likely was a Bertha de Vermandois at some time in history, but not married to an obscure Norman.\n\n> His great grandparents would thus be Hrolf Turstain (a nephew of Rollo)\n\n> and Gerlotte de Blois.\n\nMore invention.
