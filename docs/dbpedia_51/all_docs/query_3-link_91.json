        "text": "It is with heavy hearts that we announce the passing of Jean McGauley, who left us on July 30, the last day of her 88th year. Jeannette Jeannine Lucille Marie Charron was born on July 31, 1936 in Sudbury to parents Florida (Lalancette) and Albert Charron. In 1955 she married her high school sweetheart and the love of her life James (Jim) McGauley. Together they created a loving happy home and raised four children with laughter, fun and respect for their individuality. Jean taught her children empathy and duty to others, especially those less fortunate, by being a role model who lived these principles herself. She encouraged silliness and fun and giggles, and her giggle fits were legendary. All were welcome in her home, and it wasn't unusual for Jean to make pizzas from scratch for 20 people at the drop of a hat.\n\nWith Jim's impeding retirement, they started a whole new adventure as partners in the ownership and management of Woodside Beach Cottages in Providence Bay, Manitoulin Island. Together, they met such a variety of people (many of whom remained close friends for many years). They gazed at the stars, danced under the full moon, sat around many campfires kibitzing with guest and friends. They watched their grandchildren grow and enjoy the freedom of exploring that exquisite landscape and hired them for great summer jobs. They were particularly thrilled when their precious son Chris would visit from Cold Lake Alberta with his children. It was a magical time for the whole family.\n\nJim passed away in 2005, and Jean never really recovered from the loss. This was followed by the loss of her son Chris, another heartbreak. Her remaining children are comforted knowing that she is now reunited with both of them.\n\nOne of Jeanâ€™s biggest joys was the knowledge that her great grandchildren were now experiencing the joys of the cottages in Providence Bay, just one of her enduring legacies, which include memories, the stories, the giggles, the love.\n\nJean was predeceased by her husband and best friend, James (\"Jim\") McGauley, and her son Chris. She is survived by daughters Laurie, Lisa (Gerry), and Vickie (Scott) and the grandchildren she adored: Jesse (Colleen), Josh (Kayla), Jenna, Kyle (Brittany), Meghan (Keith), Max and Samuel. She was smitten by each and every one of her ten great grandchildren: Madeleine, Nicholas, Anna, Caleb, Ben, Bryson, Rowan, Layla, Milo, and Oliver.\n\nHer friends of 48 years, Estelle and Gilles Prevost, and their children feel her loss greatly, as do her friends, \"Missy\" Bergh, Jan and Randy McEwin, and her cousin, Lena Aubut.\n\nWe thank all of the personal support workers throughout the past several years, who treated Mom with tenderness, decency, and respect. We are so grateful and recognize the incredible importance and difficulty of the work you do.\n\nThere will be a celebration of life for family and friends at a date yet to be determined. Donations may be made to Doctors Without Borders in Jean's memory, one of her favourite charities."
