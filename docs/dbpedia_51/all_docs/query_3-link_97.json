        "text": "Leander Paes is the only Indian tennis player to win a medal at the Olympics.\n\nTennis made its Olympic debut at the 1896 Summer Games and was part of the event until 1924, excluding the 1916 Games due to World War I. Disputes between the International Tennis Federation and the International Olympic Committee over the definition of amateur players led to its removal.\n\nAfter being featured as a demonstration sport for a couple of editions, the discipline was reinstated as a full-medal sport in 1988, restoring its place in the Olympic tradition. Kathleen McKane Godfree and Venus Williams are tied for the most Olympic medals in tennis, with Godfree earning one gold, two silver and two bronze, while Williams secured four gold and one silver.\n\nThe two American sisters, Serena and Venus, together hold the record for the most gold medals, each winning four. On the men’s side, Reginald Doherty holds the record with three gold and one bronze, while Andy Murray is the only male player to win two gold medals in singles.\n\nDefending an Olympic gold medal has only been achieved three times: by Gigi Fernández and Mary Joe Fernández in women’s doubles (1992 and 1996), Serena Williams and Venus Williams in women’s doubles (2008 and 2012), and Andy Murray in men’s singles (2012 and 2016).\n\nAt the 2024 Games*, Alexander Zverev lost to Italy’s Lorenzo Musetti in the quarterfinals. However, Markéta Vondroušová and Elina Svitolina, who won silver and bronze in women’s singles at Tokyo, already withdrew from this year’s competition. As a result, Qinwen Zheng became the first Chinese tennis player to win singles gold in tennis at the Games.\n\nALSO READ: Tennis at Paris Olympics 2024: Updated schedule, fixtures, squad, results, live streaming details\n\nLet’s now take a close look at the winners of each edition of the Olympics in tennis, breaking down the champions in each event, edition by edition.\n\nMen’s Singles\n\nWomen’s Singles\n\nMen’s Doubles\n\nWomen’s Doubles\n\nMixed Doubles"
