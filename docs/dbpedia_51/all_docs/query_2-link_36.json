        "text": "My thanks to Don Landry and Missy Burke for their past efforts researching the origins of the surname which came to be Quebedeaux in Louisiana. I realize there are numerous spellings; I find it easier to stick with one. Much of this readdresses previous information, however I believe it represents a more accurate reconstruction of available information. I welcome any comments\n\nQuebedeaux in Illinois\n\nThe first Quebedeaux mentioned in Illinois is Antoine L'Espagnol, who was captured by the French in the siege of Pensacola (circa 1719) and was present in Illinois as early as 1721:\n\n\"...The company, persuaded of the truth of the indications which had been given them, and that the incapacity of the founder had been the sole cause of their bad success, sent in his room a Spaniard called Antonio, who had been taken at the siege of Pensacola, had afterwards been a galley-slave, and boasted much of his having wrought in a mine at Mexico. They gave him very considerable appointments, but he succeeded no better than had done the Sieur de Lochon.\" (Excerpt from a letter written 20 Oct 1721 from Kaskasquias by P. de Charlevoix, Journal of a Voyage to Nrth-American. Undertaken by Order of the French King, Vol. II, London: R. and J. Dodsley, 1761, pp. 219-221. Trans. from the French)\n\nAlthough Antoine is never identified as a Quebedeaux, references to a Quebedeaux \"the younger\" in 1723 imply it was his surname. This is based on the fact that in the 1726 census only he and Joseph were identified as Spaniards. Antoine apparently never married, as he is the only member of his household in both 1726 and 1732. The siege of Pensacola refers to the French occupation of Pensacola from 1719-1722, at which time it was returned to Spain.\n\nJoseph Quebedeaux dit L'Espagnol\n\nHow and when Joseph L'Espagnol arrived in Illinois is unknown, however it was probably no later than 1723. The first mention of Joseph by name is at the baptism of his son, Mathurin, in Feb 1724, however references to Quebedeaux \"the younger\" in 1723 imply he was there. We know from later records that Joseph's surname was Quevedo.\n\nThere are no records available which allow us to place Joseph's date of birth, therefore I've conveniently decided it was about 1700. We know he fathered a child by early 1724 and I felt free to assume he'd be at least 20 years of age; 1700 seemed fairly reasonable. It very well could have been before then, but not much later. We also know that Joseph dit L'Espagnol was deceased by 1745, as he is listed as deceased at the marriages of two of his daughters.\n\nPrevious researchers have stated that Joseph and his wife Marianne arrived from France with 2 daughters, however this is incorrect. \"Passenger and Immigration Lists Index, 1500s-1900s\" (Ancestry.com)cites Glen Conrad's \"The First Families of Louisiana\". It shows Joseph L'Espagnol with wife and 2 children in 1726, which corresponds to the information on the 1726 census. We know from the baptism of Mathurin in 1724 that Joseph was in Illinois at least 2 years prior, so I believe the information reflects the 1726 census information and not his arrival in Louisiana.\n\nThe New Quebedeaux Story, Part II\n\nMarriage and family of Joseph dit L'Espagnol Quebedeaux:\n\nNo record of their marriage has been recovered, however Joseph married Marianne Antoine Beau no later than 1723. This is based on the baptism of a son, Mathurin, on 10 Feb 1724. I've seen a couple of variations of his wife's name, so here is what I have available:\n\nBaptism of son Mathurin: \"Marianne Antoine\"\n\nChurch marriage record for daughter Marie Francoise: \"Marianne Beau\"\n\nMarriage contract for daughter Marie Francoise: \"Marianne Antoine Beau\"\n\nMarriage contract for daughter Marie Josephe: \"Marianne Antoine Beau\"\n\nJoseph and Marianne Antoine Beau had at least five children, with two noted in the census of 1726 and five in 1732. The first four are pretty much universally accepted:\n\n1) Mathurin bt. 10 Feb 1724 (parents named at baptism)\n\n2) Marie Josephe m. Feb 1745 Mathurin Pinau (parents named at marriage)\n\n3) Marie Francoise m. Jul 1745 Nicolas Prevost dit Blondin (parents named at marriage)\n\n4) Marie Jeanne m. abt 1750 Gilles Duchemin (Maiden name Quebedeaux, and Joseph dit L'Espagnol was the only one identified with a family)\n\n5) Joseph (referenced in 1738 to be hired by Peltier)\n\nIn 1738 there was a contract to hire Joseph Quebedeaux by Peltier with the permission of Quebedeaux's parents. Earlier researchers accepted this as a reference to Joseph dit L'Espagnol, however I'll ask a simple question: why does a man with a wife and five children in 1732 need his parents' permission to take a job six years later? This is proof of a second Joseph Quebedeaux in Illinois and Joseph dit L'Espagnol is the only Quebedeaux ever shown with children.\n\nThere is no proof that Charles Quebedeaux was the child of Joseph dit L'Espagnol and Marianne Antoine Beau, nor is there any mention of him in Illinois that I'm aware of. He was certainly from Illinois and his father is recorded at his marriage as named Joseph. I've just shown evidence of two Joseph Quebedeaux's in Illinois; who can say the younger Joseph wasn't his father?\n\nI obtained a copy of the 1752 Illinois census transcript published in the Winter 2000 Quarterly of the Illinois State Genealogical Society hoping it may clarify the issue. Unfortunately there are no Quebedeaux listed. The only names associated with Joseph dit L'Espagnol I found are:\n\nFort de Chartres:\n\ngille Chemin, soldier (married daughter Marie Jeanne)\n\nVillage of St. Philippe:\n\nNicola Blondin (married daughter Marie Francoise)"
