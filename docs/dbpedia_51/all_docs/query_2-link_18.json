        "text": "Sources\n\nLocation info: Québec, Beauport\n\nNotes\n\nPhotographie du memorial irrigé par l'Association des Prévost-Provost d'Amérique Inc sur les terres de Martin Prévost en 1994 et visité par Suzanne et Marthe Prévost, Yves et Paul Baril en 2005.\n\nMartin Prévost est né à Montreuil-sous-Bois en France et y a été baptisé le 4 janvier 1611\n\n+ Martin, notre ancêtre est probablement arrivé en même temps que les premières Ursulines et Hospitalièrre le 1er août 1639, en même temps que Marie de l'Incarnation et est engagé comme commis à La Compagie-des-Cents-Associés établie par le cardinal Richelieu. (Sa signature apparait comme témoin au bas d'un contat de mariage daté le 27 décembre 1639)\n\n+A cette époque, Algonquins et Montagnais fréquentaient les Français installés au pied du Cap aux Diamants. Au cours de l'automne de 1637, un couple d'amérindien ayant au moins un fils et une fille vint passer l'hiver à toute proximité des Français cherchant leur voisinage sécurisant. Les missionnaires baptisèrent les deux enfants. Le garçon reçut le prénom de François, que lui donna son parrain, Françcois de Ré, sieur de Gand, et la fillette, celui de Marie. On ne sait qui fut le parrain de celle-ci, mais il est permis de croire que ce fut Olivier Letardif, qui fut commis général des Cent-Associés à Québec car il lui donna comme deuxième prénom Olivier et il devait par la suite l'adopter comme sa propre fille.\n\nLetardif confia la petite à un ménage fort estimé, celui de Guillaume Hubou et de Marie Rollet. Cette dernière était la veuve de Louis Hébert, notre premier colon. Martin Prévost fut sans doute sensible aux charmes exotiques de cette jeune Amérindienne qu'il voyait déambuler chaque jour près de magasin des Cent-Associés, car Marie de l'incarnation et Mme de la Peltrie assuraient sa formation scolaire, et on peut deviner qu'elle ne manquait pas d'attraits: les missionnaires disaient de son frère qi'il était \"fort bel enfant\".\n\nLe 3 novembre 1644, donc, le père Barthélemy Vimont bénisssait le mariage de Marin Prévost et de Marie-Olivier-Sylvestre Manitouabe8ich, une amérindienne de la tribu des Algonquins, une Abénaquise en présence d'Olivier Letardif et de Guillaume Couillard, gendre du regretté Louis Hébert. Deux ans plus tôt, c'est ce missionnaire qui avait célébré la messe lors de la fondation de Ville-Marie.\n\n+ C'est le premier mariage officiel au Canada entre un blanc et une Amérindienne.\n\n+Le 12 février 1645, Martin achète de James Bourguignon et Claire Morin, une terre de 5 arpents de front sur le fleuve, par la profondeur de la seigneurie de Beauport(No73) terre qui avait appartenue à Robert Griffard en 1634.Cette terre est située à l'ouest de la chute Montmorency, là ou se dresse de nos jours l'église de Courville.\n\n+ Marie Manitouabe8ich meurt le 10 septembre 1665 après avoir donné naissance à 8 enfants dont seulement quatre fondèrent des foyers.\n\nLui et Marie Manitouabe8ich sont les ancêtres d'une forte proportion des Prévost en Amérique du Nord, grâce surtout à leur fils Jean-Baptiste.\n\n+Martin Prévost se remarie avec Marie d'Aboncour dit Lacaille, veuve de Godefroy Guillot qu'elle avait épousée en 1651 et de Jean Joliet avec qui elle eut un fils, Louis Joliet, le découvreur du Mississipi.\n\nSans doute usé par une existance laborieuse, il fut hospitalisé à l'Hotel-Dieu de Québec en juillet 1690 et en janvier1691.Entre-temps il a assisté au siège de Québec par l'Amiral Phipps et au débarquement des Anglais sur la côte de Beauport\n\n.Martin décéda à Beauport de 27 Janvier 1691 à l'âge se 80 ans et fut inhumé à Beauport le lendemain.\n\nCame to New France in 1644 where he was the first white to marry a native\n\nMarriage: November 3rd, 1644 in Québec City.\n\nThis is the first recorded marriage between a White man and an Indian\n\nmaiden.\n\nMartin is the son of Pierre Prévost and Charlotte Vié. He was from Montreuilsous-\n\nBois, arrondissement of Bobigny, Bishopry of Paris (Seine-St-Denis), a\n\nnortheastern suburb of Paris, France.\n\nHe was baptized on January 4th, 1611 in the magnificient church St.Peter and\n\nSt.Paul of Montreuil-sous-Bois and he died in Beauport, Québec on January\n\n27th, 1691 at the respectful age of 90 years old.\n\nMarie Manitouabewich was an Indian of the Algonquin tribe (according to\n\nFather Hierosme Lalemant in a document dated May 10, 1661). Daughter of\n\nRoch Manitouabewich and Outchibabanoukoueou, she was the god-daughter of\n\nOlivier LeTardif who did took her under his protection to have her be\n\ninstructed in the French manner by the Ursuline Nuns. Unfortunately we have\n\nnot been able to find her baptism act.\n\nShe died on September 10th, 1665 in Québec City and was buried in the Côte\n\nde la Montagne cemetery, in downtown Québec\n\nThe Marriage Act of Martin Prévost and Marie Olivier Manitouabewich was\n\nwritten this way. Here is the translation of this Act :\n\nYear 1644. The 3rd day of the month of November, the bans\n\nhaving been published on the 3 following days - the first of which\n\nwas the 23rd day of October, the second being the 28th day, and\n\nthe third on the 30th day of the same month of October, and\n\nhaving uncovered no legitimate encombrances, The Rev. R.P.\n\nBarthelemy Vimont, Superior of the Mission of the Company of\n\nJesus (Jesuit) in this country of La Nouvelle France and holding\n\nthe office of Pastor of this Church of the Conception of Virgin\n\nMary at Quebec, and having interrogate Martin Prevost, son of\n\nPierre Prevost and of Charlotte Vien, his deceased wife, of the\n\nParish of Montreuil, Sur-le-Bois-de- Vincennes, France, and Marie\n\nOlivier, daughter of Roch Manithabehich (Indian) and having their\n\nmutual verbal consent presently given, did solemnly marry and\n\ngave them the Nuptial Benediction in this Church of the\n\nConception at Quebec in the presence of known witnesses, Olivier\n\nLeTardif and Guillaume Couillard of this parish.\n\n(No signature)\n\nEight children were born to this couple :\n\n1.- Marie-Madeleine : born on December 21st, she was baptized in Québec on\n\nDecember 28th, 1647. She died and was buried also in Québec on February\n\n5th, 1648 at the age of 46 days.\n\n2.- Ursule : born on December 13th, 1649, she was baptized in Quebec the day\n\nafter. She died on New Year's day, 1661 and buried January 2nd at 11 years\n\nold.\n\n3.- Louis : born about 1651. He married Françoise Gagnon, daughter of\n\nMathurin and Françoise Godeau, on February 21st, 1672 in Château-Richer.\n\nThen Marguerite Carreau dit Lafraîcheur, daughter of Louis and Jeanne\n\nLeRouge on February 17th, 1681 in Château-Richer.\n\n9 children were born out of these two marriages: 5 from the first and 4 of the\n\nsecond one.\n\nLouis drowned on May 12th 1686 near Beauport where the St.Lawrence River\n\nbecomes a wide basin between Beauport and Quebec. His body was found a few\n\ndays later and was buried on May 27th in Quebec. He was only 35.\n\n4.- Marie-Madeleine : born in Québec on January 7th, 1655, she was baptized\n\non January 13th and died in March or April of 1662 at the age of 7.\n\n5.- Antoine : born in Québec on October 15 and baptized on October 23rd,\n\n1657. He was buried at the same place on March 16th, 1662. He was 4 years\n\nold.\n\n6.- Jean : born in Québec on January 31st, 1660 he was baptized on February\n\n14th. He married Françoise Cadieux, daughter of Charles and Madeleine\n\nMichelle Macard in Québec on May 4th, 1690. He died in Québec in 1694 at\n\nthe age of 33.\n\nThis couple had one daughter, Marie-Madeleine. She married Mathieu MORIN,\n\nin Beauport, on February 8, 1717.\n\n7.- Jean-Baptiste : born in Québec on May 16th, 1662, he was baptized on\n\nJune 24th.\n\nHe married Marie-Anne Giroux, daughter of Toussaint and Marie Godard on\n\nAugust 18th, 1683: They had 14 children.\n\nWidowed, Jean-Baptiste married Geneviève Sédillot, daughter of Jean and\n\nMarie-Claire DelaHogue, on February 3rd, 1712 in Ste-Foy: 11 children were\n\nborn out of this second marriage.\n\nHe died in St.Augustin on May 12th, 1737 at 75.\n\n8.- Thérèse: born and baptized in Québec on June 3rd, 1665.\n\nShe married Michel Giroux, son of Toussaint and Marie Godard, on August\n\n18th, 1683 in Beauport. They had 12 children.\n\nOnce widowed, Martin Prévost married Marie d'Abancourt, widow of Geoffroy\n\nOnce widowed, Martin Prévost married Marie d'Abancourt, widow of Geoffroy\n\nGuillot and of Jean Jolliet, on November 8th, 1665 in Québec. She was the\n\nmother of the famous discoverer of the Mississippi River, Louis Jolliet.\n\nMartin Prévost had a very interresting life and we strongly suggest to read the\n\nbiography that Robert Prévost wrote about him: it is in French and is titled\n\nTémoin de nos commencements. Robert makes us aware of the way our first\n\nancestors lived through one of our ancestors who was already here in New\n\nFrance, in 1639. See boutique\n\nWe estimate the arrival of Martin in Québec in 1639 at the same time as\n\nMarie de l'Incarnation, founder of the Ursuline Nuns in Canada.\n\nMartin Prévost worked for the Company of the One Hundred Associates\n\n(Compagnie des cent associés) as storekeeper clerk which at that time was the\n\nequivalent of a warehouse manager today. So, we can figure out that maybe he\n\nwas the one who was in charge of preparing all the merchandises needed for\n\nthe Maisonneuve expedition in the founding of the City of Montréal, in 1642.\n\nIn 1994, to commemorate the 350th wedding anniversary of Martin and Marie\n\nManitouabe8ich, the Association des Prévost-Provost d'Amérique erected a\n\nmonument in the parc Martin-Prévost located in the Beauport borough of\n\nQuébec City. This park is situated at the corner of De Tunis and De la\n\nRenardière Streets, on the exact site of the land owned by Martin from 1645\n\nuntil his death in 1691 (See Le Prévostal, Vol. 3 No. 4)\n\n===\n\nOnce widowed, Martin Prévost married Marie d'Abancourt, widow of Geoffroy Guillot and of Jean Jolliet, on November 8th, 1665 in Québec. She was the mother of the famous discoverer of the Mississippi River, Louis Jolliet.\n\n1. A Biography of Martin Prevost and his Family by Lionel Provost\n\nMARTIN PREVOST as a young man living near Paris, France choose to leave the security of family, friends and homeland to travel to a distant foreign land. He was likely driven by a sense of adventure, the lure of vast regions of unclaimed virgin land and the opportunity to serve king and country by partaking in the colonization of New France. The following is a brief account of MARTIN PREVOST and his family and how they were to be the first ancestors of the REMI PROVOST family to establish roots in Canada. Today 6-7 thousand PREVOST’S and PROVOST’S in North America can lay claim to be ancestors and part of the rich history surrounding MARTIN and MARIE. The names, dates, locations and accounts of events that are put forward below are a compilation of information taken from published genealogy data bases and biographies of MARTIN and his family …… LIONEL PROVOST\n\nThe earliest available genealogy for the ancestors of REMI PROVOST record a MARTIN PREVOST whom is the father of PIERRE PREVOST and grandfather to MARTIN PREVOST our first ancestor to America. The location, date of his birth and death are not yet known; what is known is that on 4 May 1561 MARTIN married BLANCHE ADET, daughter of NICOLAS ADET and MARGUERITE GIRARD and on 30 September 1574 at Montreuil sous Bois, Ile de France they had a son whom they named PIERRE. In 1599 at age 25 years PIERRE marries CHARLOTTE VIE (WIEN) in Montreuil sous Bois and they raise seven children. CHARLOTTE dies sometime before 1627 as PIERRE second marries MARIE HOUDART in 1627. There is no record of children from this union. PIERRE PREVOST dies 10 September 1646 at age 72 years.\n\nPIERRE PREVOST and CHARLOTTE VIE raised seven children – six sons; NICOLAS born 14 January 1601, THOMAS born 22 August 1604, PHILIPPE born 10 February 1606, COME born 20 July 1608, MARTIN, JEAN, and their only daughter NICOLE. MARTIN PREVOST (our first ancestor to settle in New France) the second youngest of the 6 boys was born and baptized on 4 January 1611 near Paris at Montreuil sous Bois, Ile de France, France. None of MARTIN’S siblings are on record of coming to America. The only member of the PREVOST family other than Martin known to have settled to New France was JEANNE PREVOST, daughter of MARTIN’S oldest brother NICOLAS PREVOST. JEANNE was born at Montreuil sous Bois on 24 September 1632 and married from the same parish GASTON GUAY. GASTON and JEANNE had five children, MARGUERITE, FRANCOIS, JEAN-BAPTISTE, MATHIEU born about 1655 and CHARLES born about 1673. MATHIEU was to later take the surname GASTONGUAY. JEANNE (PREVOST) GUAY died on 26 April 1699 at Notre-Dame, Quebec and was buried in cimetiere St-Charles, Quebec.\n\nThe exact date of MARTIN PREVOST’S arrival in New France (Quebec) is not known for sure, but it is certain that he was in Quebec by 1639 as his signature is present on a marriage contract dated 27 December 1639. It is also known that MARTIN was one of the first pioneers of Quebec as a 1641 census of Quebec recorded a population of 241 inhabitants. Did MARTIN cross the Atlantic at the same time as the first Ursulines and Hospitalieres Nuns who are known to have arrived on 01 August 1639? It seems that this could have been the case! The Compagnie des Cent-Associes (Company of 100 Associates), which had been established by CARDINAL RICHELIEU to begin the colonization of Quebec, had probably recruited him from France. On MARTIN’S arrival in Quebec, his first job was that of Clerk / Agent for the Compagnie des Cent-Associes. Their stores were located below the cliffs of Quebec on Cape Diamond at installations called l’Habitation. The first l’Habitation, a combined trading post/storehouse/fort built by SAMUAL DE CHAMPLAIN in 1608, would later become known as ‘Place Royal-The Birth Place of Quebec’. By 1624 this wooden structure had gone into disrepair and was re-built using stone. In 1632 it was again rebuilt and expanded. As late as 1641, l’Habitation, which by this time had become the storehouse and lodgings for l’Compagnie des Cent-Associes, was still the largest and only stone building at Place-Royal. It was around the corner from the Compagnie storehouse that MARTIN by 1667 had built a home on land he owned. Today; on the site of l’Habitation/Compagnie des Cent-Associes storehouse resides the Eglise Notre Dame des Victoires and on a near-by street called Rue sous-le-Fort where MARTIN’S house once stood there now can be found La Chasse-Galerie Boutique. The cimetiere de la Cote la Montagne, burial place of MARTIN’S wife MARIE and four of their children is located near-by. Today this area is known as ‘basse ville’ and home to Quartier Petit Champlain; an extremely popular pedestrian-only cobbled stoned up-scale shopping and tourist destination.\n\nPrior too and during the time of MARTIN’S presence in Quebec, the Algonquin and Montagnais Indians often came to the installations at Cape Diamond to trade furs. It was the autumn of 1637 that an Algonquin Indian couple of the Huron Nation, ROCH MANITOUABEOUICH and OUTCHIBAHABANOUK OUEOU and their children, in search of a safe haven, came to spend the winter in the vicinity of the French settlement at l’Habitation. It came to pass that OLIVIER LE TARDIF whom at one time had been a personal representative and interpreter for SAMUAL DE CHAMPLAIN and was now Commissioner General of the Compagnie des Cent-Associes, hired ROCH MANITOUABEOUICH as scout and traveling companion. They travelled together for many years and over time became very good friends. Also during this time, French Missionaries baptized ROCH (a name given to him at baptism in honour of Saint Roch), his wife OUTCHIBAHABANOUK, and their two children. It is interesting to note that some documents use the spelling MANITOUAB8UICH for Roch’s surname as the letter “w” for the sound “ou” had yet to be borrowed from the Germanic language thus the number “8” was generally used by the printers. Roch’s son was given the name of FRANCOIS, after his godfather FRANCOIS DE RE, SIEUR DE GRAND. The daughter; born about 1620 at St-Andre de Kamouraska QC; was given the name MARIE in honour of the Virgin Mary, OLIVIER from her godfather OLIVIER LE TARDIF, and SYLVESTRE from “one who comes from the forest”. LE TARDIF adopted MARIE-OLIVIER MANITOUABEOUICH SYLVESTRE as his own daughter and had her placed as a “live-in border” at the Ursuline Nuns Convent. This would ensure she could be educated and reared in the same manner as the well-to-do French girls of that time. MARIE de L'INCARNATION and MADAME de la PELTRIE, whom were the founders and heads of the Ursuline Convent, made certain that MARIE continued her scholastic, spiritual and personal development. Later, LE TARDIF had MARIE entrusted\n\nto the very fine home of MARIE ROLLET and GUILLAUME HUBOU. MARIE ROLLET was the widow of LOUIS HEBERT a farmer and pharmacist. This is the same LOUIS HEBERT and MARIE ROLLET that had been chosen by CARDINAL RICHELIEU to be the esteemed first colonists of Quebec.\n\nMARTIN as a close acquaintance of the HUBOU family and very personal friend of LE TARDIF, would most certainly have had contact with MARIE. He no doubt was very much aware of her exotic charm, as she was considered quite attractive and would most certainly often be seen strolling by the Company store where Martin worked. Thus on 03 November 1644, when MARTIN was 33 years old and MARIE was about 24 years old, in the Church of the Conception of the Virgin Mary where today stands the Basilica-Cathedral Notre-Dame-de-Quebec, father BARTHELEMY VIMONT consecrated the marriage of MARTIN PREVOST and MARIE-OLIVIER MANITOUABEOUICH SYLVESTRE in the presence of OLIVIER LE TARDIF and GUILLAUME COUILLARD the son in law of LOUIS HEBERT. The marriage of MARTIN and MARIE has historical significance in that it is widely reported and recognized to be the first Franco–American Indian marriage to occur in New France. Quotes from a book entitled ‘Portraits of Pioneer Families’ read \"Our sons will marry with your daughters and we will become one people thus said SAMUAL DE CHAMPLAIN to the native Indians in 1633”, followed by \"You always say something to cheer us replied a feathered chief, when this comes to be we will be very happy\". It would be some 11 years later when our ancestor MARTIN PREVOST married MARIE-OLIVIER MANITOUABEOUICH SYLVESTRE an Indian of the Algonquin/Huron nation such would be realized.\n\nThree months after the marriage of MARTIN and MARIE, MARTIN obtained land located a little to the west of the Montmorency Falls along what is today called Avenue Royal (The Kings Highway) in the Seigneurie of Beauport. L’Eglise Saint-Louis de Courville and Parc MARTIN PREVOST, complete with commemorative plaque to honour his presence, now occupy the properties once owned by MARTIN. Land acquisition and sales records show that this land was one of many acquisitions that MARTIN was to purchase and sell over the years. All during the time of his marriage, Martin is recorded as having farmed in the Beauport region in addition to owning land and a house in Quebec city.\n\nThe marriage of MARTIN and MARIE was to last for some 20 years until 10 September 1665 when at age 45 MARIE died in Quebec. It is reported that she was widely mourned. MARIE along with children; MADELEINE1 on 5 February 1648 at age 2 months, URSULE on 1 January 1661 at age 11 years, ANTOINE on 16 March 1662 at age 4 years, and MADELEINE2 on 1 April 1662 at age 7 years; was buried in cimetiere de la Cote la Montagne; one of the first and oldest cimetieres of Quebec. Services for MARIE were likely held at Eglise Notre-Dame de l’Immaculee-Conception of the Virgin Mary which had been the site of Eglise Notre-Dame de la Recouvrance prior to it’s burning and is to day the location of Basilica-Cathedral Notre-Dame de Quebec.\n\nMARIE and MARTIN brought into the world 8 children with only 4 surviving to marry and establish families. These 4 were LOUIS born 1651, JEAN-PASCAL born 31 January 1660, JEAN-BAPTISTE born 16 May 1662 and THERESE born 3 June 1665. LOUIS whom is our direct ancestor from MARTIN’S and MARIE’S children first married FRANCOISE GAGNON in 1672 and they had 5 children. After FRANCOISE’S death in 1680, LOUIS second married MARGUERITE CARREAU in 1681. This union resulted in 4 children one of which was born 12 October 1686 and named LOUIS. It is this LOUIS, son of LOUIS and grandchild of MARTIN and MARIE whom becomes our next generation ancestor. JEAN who later took the name of his godfather PASCHAL, married FRANCOISE CADIEUX in 1690 and they had four children. JEAN-BAPTISTE first married MARIE-ANNE GIROUX in 1683 and they had 14 children. He second married GENEVIEVE SEDILOT in 1712 and they had 11 children together. Finally THERESE married MICHEL GIROUX brother to MARIE-ANNE GIROUX the wife of JEAN-BAPTISTE and they had 12 children . Genealogy records show that in total MARTIN AND MARIE were blessed with at least 49 grandchildren and 93 great grandchildren.\n\nUpon the passing of MARIE in September of 1665 leaving MARTIN a widower with 4 children,(LOUIS age 14, JEAN-PASCAL age 5 years, JEAN-BAPTISTE age 3 years and THERESE age 3 months), MARTIN did not delay in remarrying. On 8 November 1665, at age 54, MARTIN married MARIE D’ABANCOURT also known as MARIE D’ABANCOURT CAILLE, the daughter of ADRIEN D’ABANCOURT DIT LACAILLE and SIMONE D’ORGEVILLE in Notre-Dame Quebec. MARIE D’ABANCOURT was born about 1617 in Soissons, Aisne, Picardie France. This union of Martin and Marie yielded no children. MARIE D’ABANCOURT had been twice widowed by previous marriages. First married on 9 October 1639 to JEAN JOLLIET, they had a daughter MARIE and a son LOUIS whom was to become a cartographer and explorer and was to in 1683 discovered the Mississippi River. MARIE D’ABANCOURT then on 19 October 1651 marries GEOFFROY GUILLOT only to have him die four years later in a drowning accident. GEOFFROY and MARIE had two children, LOUISE and ELISABETH. It is not known exactly when MARIE (D’ABANCOURT) JOLLIET GUILLOT PREVOST died, but it is known that she dictated a will in December of 1678. Some records have her dying as late as 1700 at age 83.\n\nMARTIN PREVOST; whom among many things; had left his homeland to come to New France and the perils of colonizing of a far-away land; had survived wandering bands of hostile Indians; had participated in the successful defence of Quebec against the British siege and invasion led by Admiral PHILIPPS; had worked as agent for the Compagnie des Cent-Associes; had taken ownership, cleared of woods and farmed numerous parcels of land in and around Quebec and Beauport; had built several homes in Quebec and Beauport; had fathered and raised 8 children; was without a doubt by the age of 80 years worn out from a very adventurous and rugged lifetime. MARTIN’S health began to fail and in July of 1690 and again in January of 1691 he entered the Hotel Dieu Hospital in Quebec. It was in these last years of his life that MARTIN signs his surname “PROVOST”. MARTIN PREVOST/PROVOST died 27 January 1691 and was buried 28 Jan 1691 in a cemetery where now stands the Eglise La Nativite de Notre Dame Beauport located at 25 Avenue Front du Couvent, Beauport, Quebec. Due to several destructive fires, the original church built in 1662 was rebuilt four times on the same site. Each subsequent church was made larger thus at one point necessitating the moving of the cemetery and it’s occupants (including MARTIN’S remains) to were the current cemetery now stands. The exact location of MARTIN’S resting place with-in the existing cemetery is unknown as the records for the cemetery and occupants that had been relocated were lost in one of the fires.\n\nMARTIN PREVOST and MARIE-OLIVIER MANITOUABEOUICH SYLVESTRE are the ancestors of a large proportion of the current day PREVOST AND PROVOSTS in North America. The continuation of their genealogy was assured when their 8 children grew to 50 grandchildren and then to 93 great grandchildren. Honour was bestowed to MARTIN and MARIE when a plaque dedicated to their memory was unveiled in 1983 in Paris, France by then Quebec Premier, Rene Levesque. This plaque is erected on the baptistery of the church of St. Pierre et St. Paul at Montreuil sous Bois. This site can be found by taking the metro from Paris to the Mairerie de Montreuil metro station. The church and plaque can be found nearby. Further honour and recognition of our ancestor’s place in early Canadian history has been preserved by a plaque at Parc MARTIN PREVOST in Beauport. This commemorative plaque was erected by the Association des familles Prevost/Provost d’Amerique on 25 June 1994.\n\nThe reader should be aware that there are several other Prevost and Provost families from France whom were also pioneers of Quebec. These other branches are not believed to be related to Martin Prevost and his parents Pierre PREVOST and Charlotte VIEN.\n\nSources of Reference:\n\nMichel Provost; Archivist-Genealogist, Association des familles Prevost/Provost d’Amerique\n\nClaude Provost; “Genealogy of Prevost / Provost\n\nAaron Roy; Colchester, Vermont\n\nRobert Prevost; “Portraits of Pioneer Families\", Vol 1, Editions Libre Expression, Montreal, 1993\n\nHonorius Provost; “A Short Biography of Martin Prevost” English translation\n\nSuzanne Guimond Binette; “A Historical Biography of Marie Olivier (Manitouabeouich) Sylvestre”\n\nAndre Vachon; “A Short Biography of Marie d’Abancourt” English translation\n\nMarried Marie Olivier Sylvester-Manitouabewich on November 3, 1644 in Quebec City.\n\nOther children: Marie-Madeleine (1647), Ursule (1649), Jean Pascal (1653), Marie-Madeleine (1655), Antoine (1657), Jean Baptiste (1659), Jean (1660), Terese (1665)\n\nMarried Marie d'Abancourt (1618-1678) on November 8, 1665, no children from this marriage.\n\nMartin's marriage to Marie Olivier was the first French/Indian marriage in New France\n\nPossibly duplicate of Pierre Martin Provost dit Prévost\n\nGEDCOM Note"
