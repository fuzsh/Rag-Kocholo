        "text": "Little chart of the mouth of the River Marony, now called the River Maroni which marks the border between French Guiana and Surname.\n\nJacques-Nicolas Bellin was one of the greatest 18th century\n\nmap makers. He specialised in hydrography and was appointed to the French\n\nHydrographic office at the young age of 18 in 1721. Twenty years later he was\n\nnamed the first “Ingenieur de la Marine” for the “Depot des Cartes et Plans de\n\nla Marine” as well as Hydrographer to Louis XV of France. Over a fifty year\n\ncareer, he published a multitude of important maps often from first hand\n\nsources provided by naval officers, merchants and government sources. His level\n\nof access was extraordinary. As well as publishing his own atlases, he was a\n\ncontributor to many seminal French works on exploration, including Abbee\n\nRaynal’s “Histoire des Deux Indes”, Abbee Prevost’s “Histoire Generale des\n\nVoyages” and Pierre de Charlevoix’s “Histoire et Description Generale de la\n\nNouvelle France”.\n\nIn 1762, Bellin decided to publish one of his most popular\n\nand accessible works: “Le Petit Atlas Maritime”. The work came out in 1764 in five volumes and\n\nproved extremely popular. Many of the maps were reduced versions which Bellin\n\nhad either contributed or published previously. However, there are some notable\n\nexceptions, such as his famous map of Manhattan, which was sourced from a\n\nmanuscript map by J.B.L. Franquelin drawn in 1693. The five volumes usually\n\ncontain between 575 and 590 maps with\n\nvariations noted between individual examples. As the preparation took only two\n\nyears, it is very likely that Bellin had a majority of these copper plates\n\nalready available. The initial financial support for the atlas was from\n\nEtienne-Francois, Duc de Choiseul, a highly placed French politician who was\n\ncredited for strengthening both the army and navy. Due to its accessibility, he\n\nperceived the ”Petit Atlas Maritime” as a method of publicising both the work\n\nof the “Depot de la Marine” and the Navy to the general public. Bellin includes\n\na long dedication to Choiseul on the front of each volume.\n\nFor collectors today, the work presents one of the widest\n\nselection of extremely desirable smaller maps. They provide clear, concise and\n\nattractive geographical records of some of the most inaccessible and exotic\n\nareas of the world in the mid-18th century. Bellin was part of a group called\n\n“Les Philosophes”, the French counterpart to the pioneers of the English Age of\n\nReason and his maps are a lasting legacy from the Age of French Enlightenment.\n\nDutch Guiana was a major source of coffee, sugar cane and cocoa and thus of great interest to\n\nprivateers and national ships of all nations who lurked in the Caribbean Sea\n\nwaiting for trading convoys to leave the port.\n\nBellin published several charts of this region after the French defeat in the French Indian War, signaling France's increasing involvement in the Guianas as a method of keeping a presence in the Caribbean and the West Indies.\n\nOriginal colour."
