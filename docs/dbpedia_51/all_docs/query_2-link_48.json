OTHER NOBILITY in NORMANDY. 225\n\nThis document groups the nobility in the north-eastern part of the duchy of Normandy, located in the present-day département of Seine-Maritime.\n\nChapter 1. ARQUES\n\nThe pagus Tellau (Talou), within the episcopal diocese of Rouen, was located north-east of Rouen and was bordered by the pagus Vimnau (Vimeu) to the north-east, the sea to the north-west, the pagus Caletensis (Caux) to the west, and the pagus Rotomagensis to the south-east . The county of Talou was granted in the mid-11th century by Duke Guillaume II to his uncle Guillaume, who transformed the territory into the county of Arques after constructing the castle of that name on his land, although no further counts are recorded as he presumably died childless. It is assumed that after that time the nobility in the territory of the former county were direct vassals of the dukes of Normandy.\n\nA. COMTE de TALOU, COMTE dARQUES\n\n1.GUILLAUME de Normandie, son of RICHARD II \"le Bon/l'Irascible\" Duke of Normandy & his second wife Papia [Poppa] --- ([1020/26]-[Boulogne] after [1054]) . Guillaume of Jumièges records that Duke Richard II married secondly, after the death of his first wife, Papiam by whom he had Malgerium...archipræsulem et Willelmum Archacensem, adding that the latter was granted comitatum Talogi by Duke Guillaume II who was iam in adolescentia and built castrum Archarum in cacumine ipsius montis . Orderic Vitalis calls him brother of Mauger, and specifies that Duke Guillaume II invested him as Comte de Talou . Willelmus...comes filius...Ricardi Normannorum quondam ducis restored insulam in fluvio magno Secane...Belcinaca...ecclesias eciam Vatheuille et Brotonii to Saint-Wandrille by charter dated to [1032/47], subscribed by Godofredi vicecomitis, comitis, Walterus filius, Lambertus, Willelmus, Osbernus . \"Vuillelmus Ricardi magni ducis Normannorum filius\" donated property to the abbey of Jumièges by charter dated to [1040] . Comte dArques: \"Guillelmus Archensis comes et frater meus Malgerius Archiepiscopus\" donated the vill of Periers sur Andelle to the monastery of Saint-Ouen at Rouen, at the request of \"matris mee Paveie\" and the consent of \"Guilielmo Normannorum comite\", by charter dated to [1047/50] . Guillaume II Duke of Normandy confirmed the donation of ecclesias...in maris Constantini pagi... made by Roberto...Hunfredi...filio to Saint-Wandrille by charter dated to [1035/53], subscribed by Roberti filii Hunfredi, Rogeri fratris eius, Anscetilli, Willelmi filii Ricardi secundi Normannorum ducis, Rogerii filii Radulfi de Warethna, Rogerii filii Ragnulfi, Gilleberti Crispin, Willelmi Guiet . Guillaume of Jumièges records that Willelmum Archacensem rebelled against Duke Guillaume, helped by Henri I King of France, that Ingelrannus Abbatisvillæ comes...ac Hugo cognomento Bardulfus were killed by the duke´s forces, and that Guillaume left cum uxore sua sorore...Widonis comitis Pontivi and was welcomed by Eustachium Boloniæ comitem with whom he remained in exile until he died . William of Malmesbury records that Guillaume II captured the fortress of Arques, and Guillaume went into exile in [1054] . No record has been found of his having left descendants. m --- de Ponthieu, daughter of HUGUES [II] Comte de Ponthieu & his wife Berthe d'Aumâle. Guillaume of Jumièges records that Willelmum Archacensem went into exile cum uxore sua sorore...Widonis comitis Pontivi after his rebellion was crushed by Duke Guillaume II and found refuge with Eustachium Boloniæ comitem with whom he remained in exile until he died .\n\nB. VICOMTES dARQUES, SEIGNEURS de LONGUEVILLE (GIFFARD)\n\n[Three] brothers, parents unknown, but their names suggest a Viking origin:\n\n1.OSBERN de Bolbec, son of --- (-bur [Saint-Etienne de Fontaines]) . [\"Duke Richard [II]\" donated property to the abbey of Mont Saint-Michel by charter dated to [1026], subscribed by \" Osbernus frater comitisse, Hunfredus frater eius \" . There are two possibilities for identifiying \"comitisse\": (1) she could have been the donors second wife Papia, who is named in two documents with a brother named Osbern (see NORMANDY DUKES), or (2) she could have been Gunnor, wife of Richard [I] Duke of Normandy and mother of the donor, although in that case \"frater\" should be interpreted as \"brother-in-law\" in light of the source quoted below which names Osberns wife as Gunnors sister.] A manuscript at Caen, which commemorates the death of Abbess Mathilde, daughter of William I King of England, names \"Osbernus Giffardus, Haduisa eius conjunx\" among the deceased at \"sancti Stephani Fontanensis\", presumably indicating that they were buried there . It is assumed that \"Osbernus Giffardus\" refers to Osbern de Bolbec given that his son used the name Giffard. ...Osbernus avunculus comitis, Walterius fr. eius... subscribed the charter under which Guillaume Duke of Normandy donated the church of Arques to Saint-Wandrille, dated to [1035/55] . m [firstly] [AVELINE], sister of GUNNORA [mistress of Richard I Duke of Normandy], daughter of ---. Guillaume de Jumièges records that \"Gunnor\" had excepta Sainfria...duas sorores Wewam et Avelinam, adding that tertia...sororum Gunnoris comitissæ [Aveline, from the context] married Osberno de Bolebec, by whom she had Galterium Giffardum primum et Godefridum patrem Willelmi de Archis . She and her three sisters, as well as their husbands, are named by Robert de Torigny . On the other hand, the Genealogia Fundatoris of Tintern Abbey, Monmouthshire names Turketillus frater Turulphi, cuius filius Hasculfus dHarcourt married aliam sororem comitissæ Gunnoræ by whom he was father of duos filios Walterum de Giffard primogenitum  . As noted below, another primary source indicates that the wife of \"Osbernus Giffardus\" (assumed to refer to Osbern de Bolbec given that his son used the name Giffard) was named Hawise . It is not known whether Osbern was married twice or whether all the sources cited refer to the same person, one or other mistaking the name. [m secondly HAWISE, daughter of --- (-bur [Saint-Etienne de Fontaines]). A manuscript at Caen, which commemorates the death of Abbess Mathilde, daughter of William I King of England, names \"Osbernus Giffardus, Haduisa eius conjunx\" among the deceased at \"sancti Stephani Fontanensis\", presumably indicating that they were buried there . It is supposed that \"Osbernus Giffardus\" refers to Osbern de Bolbec, given that his son used the name Giffard. If this is correct, Hawise was presumably his second wife, unless \"Aveline\" is an error for \"Hawise\" in Guillaume de Jumièges and Robert de Torigny which names Osberns supposed first wife.] Osbern & his [first/second] wife had four children:\n\na)GAUTHIER Giffard (-before 1085) . Guillaume de Jumièges records that \"Gunnor\" had excepta Sainfria...duas sorores Wewam et Avelinam, adding that tertia...sororum Gunnoris comitissæ [Aveline, from the context] married Osberno de Bolebec, by whom she had Galterium Giffardum primum et Godefridum patrem Willelmi de Archis . ...Walterius Gyfardus... subscribed the charter under which Guillaume Duke of Normandy donated the church of Arques to Saint-Wandrille, dated to [1035/55] . Seigneur de Longueville, Normandy. \" Walterius Giffardus \" witnessed the charter dated 29 Aug 1060 under which \"milite Richardo fratribus Willelmo atque Balduino\" donated \"Gausberti Villa\" to Chartres Saint-Père . The Brevis Relatio de Origine Willelmi Conquestoris records that \"Waltero Giffardo\" contributed 60 ships towards the invasion of England in 1066 . Orderic Vitalis names ...Galterius Giphardus et Radulphus Toenites... among those who took part in the battle of Hastings . He received grants of 107 lordships (48 in Buckinghamshire) as his reward . Orderic Vitalis records that King William installed Guillermum Osberni filium at his new fortress at Winchester (intra mnia Guentæ) and appointed him vice sua toti regno versus Aquilonem, while he granted Doveram...totamque Cantiam to Odoni fratri suo, and thus he entrusted his duobus præfecturam Angliæ, seconded by Hugonem de Grentemaisnilio et Hugonem de Monteforti, Guillelmumque de Garenna, dated to 1067 . Orderic Vitalis states that the king \"gave [Walter Giffard] the county of Buckinghamshire\", in the chronicler's description of post-conquest grants made by King William, without specifying that he was created earl . m ERMENGARDE, daughter of GERARD Flaitel & his wife ---. Guillaume de Jumièges records that \"Galterium Giffardum primum married unam filiarum Girardi Flatelli . [The necrology of Longueville records the death 13 May of domina Hermengauda comitissa condam hujus loci and her confirmation of the donation made by illos de Saukervilla of molendino de Longa Villa . It is not certain whether this entry refers to the wife of Gauthier Giffard or to the wife of his grandson Walter Giffard.] Gauthier & his wife had [five or more] children:\n\ni)WALTER Giffard (-in England 15 Jul 1102, bur Longueville, Normandy ) . Guillaume de Jumièges names \"Galterium Giffardum primum as father of secundum Galterium Giffardum... . He succeeded his father in his lands. Orderic Vitalis records that King William I granted \"comitatum Buchingeham\" to \"Gualterio...cognomento Gifardo\" . Domesday Book records land held by Walter Giffard in West Hanney in Wantage Hundred in Berkshire . Orderic Vitalis records that Rodbertus Aucensium comes et Gauterius Gifardus et Radulfus de Mortuomari and nearly all the seigneurs who lived trans Sequanam usque ad mare joined King William II against his brother Robert Duke of Normandy and received considerable sums to fortify their castles, dated to [1089/90] . He was created Earl of Buckingham [after 1093] by King William II, although known contemporarily as Earl Giffard .\n\n- EARLS of BUCKINGHAM.\n\nii)WILLIAM Giffard . Bishop of Winchester. The History of the foundation of St Johns abbey, Colchester names Rohaisam soror Willielmi Giffardi episcopi Wintoniæ as wife of Ricardi filius Gilberti comitis . \" Willelmi Giffardi episcopi \" subscribed a charter dated 14 Sep 1101 under which Henry I King of England donated property to Bath St Peter .\n\niii)ROHESE Giffard (-after 1113, bur [Colchester]). Guillaume de Jumièges names \"Galterium Giffardum primum as father of secundum Galterium Giffardum et filias plures of whom una...Rohais married Richardo filio comitis Gisleberti . Orderic Vitalis records that Gisleberti comitis [filium] Ricardum married Roaldem Gualterii Gifardi filiam . Domesday Book records Rohais wife of Richard son of Gilbert holding Standon in Braughing Hundred in Hertfordshire . According to the Genealogia Fundatoris of Tintern Abbey, Monmouthshire, Rohesia married secondly Eudoni dapifero Regis Normanniæ after the death of Ricardo filio comitis Gisleberti and that they were both buried tempore Henrici primi in castrum Clecestriæ cnobio in honore sancti Johannis which Eudo constructed . According to the Complete Peerage, this genealogy is probably erroneous but it does not explain the basis for the doubts . From a chronological point of view, the connection would be tight, assuming that the death date of Richard FitzGilbert is correctly estimated to [1090] and the birth of Roheses granddaughter by her alleged second marriage, Beatrix, is correctly assessed at [1105]. This supposed second parentage is disproved by sources quoted in the section dealing with Eudes de Rie. m [firstly] RICHARD FitzGilbert de Brionne, son of GILBERT de Brionne \"Crespin\" Comte d'Eu & his wife --- (before 1035-[1090], bur St Neots, Huntingdonshire). [Incorrect supposed second marriage: m secondly EUDES de Rie dapifer, son of HUBERT [I] de Rie & his wife ---(-1 Mar 1120, bur Colchester).]\n\niv) daughters . Guillaume de Jumièges names \"Galterium Giffardum primum as father of secundum Galterium Giffardum et filias plures of whom una...Rohais married Richardo filio comitis Gisleberti .\n\nv) [AMFRIDA (-2 Jan [1099/1100]). The Chronicon Beccensis Abbatiæ records that \"tempore S. Anselmi abbatis Becci tres matronæ nobiles Basilia uxor Hugonis de Gornaco, et Amfrida neptis ipsius Basiliæ, et Eva uxor Guillelmi Crispini\" entered Bec and lived at the abbey, adding that they died on three consecutive Sundays \"Amfrida Basiliæ neptis...minor...ætate, virgo IV Non Jan, qua sepulta Basilia domina eius XVII Kal Feb tertia Eva X Kal Feb...post mortem...viri sui Guillermi Crispini...Beccique usque ad finem vitæ...perseuerauit\" . Gurney dates the passage to [1099/1100] . The parentage of Amfrida is uncertain. However, Ermengarde is the only sibling of Basilie Flaitel who is known to have had children, so it is possible that she was the daughter of Gauthier Giffard.]\n\nb)GODEFROI Giffard . Guillaume de Jumièges records that \"Gunnor\" had excepta Sainfria...duas sorores Wewam et Avelinam, adding that tertia...sororum Gunnoris comitissæ [Aveline, from the context] married Osberno de Bolebec, by whom she had Galterium Giffardum primum et Godefridum patrem Willelmi de Archis . Vicomte d'Arques, which he presumably inherited from his father-in-law Willelmus...comes filius...Ricardi Normannorum quondam ducis restored insulam in fluvio magno Secane...Belcinaca...ecclesias eciam Vatheuille et Brotonii to Saint-Wandrille by charter dated to [1032/47], subscribed by Godofredi vicecomitis, comitis, Walterus filius, Lambertus, Willelmus, Osbernus . m --- de Rouen, daughter of GOZELIN Vicomte de Rouen et dArques & his wife Emmeline ---. Her parentage is confirmed by a charter dated 1080 which relates that \"Gozelinus vicecomes de Archis cum coniuge sua et filiis\" founded Sainte-Trinité de Rouen and donated property, and that \"Willelmus de Archis heres defuncti avi sui Gozelini\" confirmed the donation . \"Grandfather\" must be \"maternal grandfather\" as the paternal ancestors of Guillaume d'Arques are confirmed by Guillaume de Jumièges (see above and below). Godefroi & his wife had [three] children:\n\ni)GUILLAUME d'Arques (-[1090]) . Guillaume de Jumièges records that \"Gunnor\" had excepta Sainfria...duas sorores Wewam et Avelinam, adding that tertia...sororum Gunnoris comitissæ [Aveline, from the context] married Osberno de Bolebec, by whom she had Galterium Giffardum primum et Godefridum patrem Willelmi de Archis . \"Guillelmus et Gislebertus filii Godefredi Archarum vicecomitis\" donated land in Montvilla to Sainte-Trinité de Rouen dated 1059 . Vicomte d'Arques. Lord of Folkestone . A charter dated 1080 relates that \"Gozelinus vicecomes de Archis cum coniuge sua et filiis\" founded Sainte-Trinité de Rouen and donated property, and that \"Willelmus de Archis heres defuncti avi sui Gozelini\" confirmed the donation . [Orderic Vitalis records Edgarus Adelinus et Robertus Belesmensis atque Guillelmus de Archis monachus Molismensis as the advisers of Robert [III] Duke of Normandy, dated to [1089] . It is possible that the third named person was Guillaume Vicomte dArques but no other record has been found that he became a monk at Molesme in Burgundy before he died.] m BEATRIX Malet, daughter of GUILLAUME [I] Malet & his wife Esilia [Crespin]. Beatrix soror Roberti Malet donated property to Eye priory, for the souls of fratrum meorum Roberti Maleth et Gilberti Malet, by undated charter . Brown indicates that Beatrix donated Redlingfield to Eye by undated charter which confirms her as husband of \"William vicomte of Arques\" . Willielmus de Abrincis miles dominus de Folkestan confirmed donations to Folkestone priory, including the donations made by \"Beatrix post mortem domini sui Willielmi de Archis\" of \"terram dotis suæ de Newenton\" by undated charter . Guillaume & his wife had two children:\n\n(a)MATHILDE d'Arques . Guillaume de Jumièges records \"Mathildis\" as the daughter of Willelmi de Archis, adding that she married Willelmus camerarius de Tancarvilla by whom she had filium Rabellum qui ei successit . m GUILLAUME [I] de Tancarville, son of RAOUL [I] de Tancarville & his wife Avicia --- (-1129).\n\n(b)EMMA d'Arques (-after 1140) . Willielmus de Abrincis miles dominus de Folkestan confirmed donations to Folkestone priory, including the donations made by \"domini Nigelli de Munevilla quondam domini de Folkestan antecessoris mei cum uxore sua Emma\" for the souls of \"antecessorum suorum Willielmi de Archis et Beatricis uxoris illius\" by undated charter, which also records that Nele died without male heirs and that Henry I King of England married \"filiam eius Matildam\" to \"Rualoni de Abrincis\" . Manasses Gisnensis comes et Emma uxor eius filia Willielmi de Arras founded Redlingfield priory by charter dated 1120, witnessed by Widonis fratris mei, Rosæ filiæ meæ . The Historia Comitum Ghisnensium names \"Emmam filiam Roberti camerarii de Tancarvilla in Normannia, viduam Odonis de Folkestane in Anglia\" as wife of \"Manasses\" , which appears to be incorrect. \"Manasses Gisnensium comes et Emma comitissa\" granted the administration of the church of Saint-Léonard to Saint-Bertin by charter dated 1129 . According to Domesday Descendants she became a nun at Saint-Leonard de Guines after the death of her second husband . m firstly NELE de Muneville, son of --- (-1103).

Bishop of Evreux .\n\nc) [JOSCELINE de Bolbec . Josceline and her marriage are shown in Europäische Stammtafeln . This is presumably based on Robert de Torigny, continuation of William of Jumièges , the unreliability of this part of whose chronicle is discussed in the Complete Peerage . Guillaume of Jumièges records that nepotes...plures...Gunnor...earum...quintam married Hugo de Monte-gummerici by whom she had Rogerius pater Roberti de Bellismo .

AUMÂLE\n\nThe lordship of Aumâle was located in the north-east of the duchy of Normandy, south of the county of Eu, centred on the town of Aumâle on the river Bresle. It passed to the family of the Comtes de Ponthieu following the marriage of Berthe, heiress of Aumâle, to Hugues de Ponthieu. Their son Enguerrand was Seigneur d'Aumâle as well as Comte de Montreuil. On his death in 1053, his widow Adelais, illegitimate daughter of Robert II Duke of Normandy, styled herself as countess, but applied the title to the territory of Aumâle rather than Montreuil, apparently without any formal regrant. Adelais brought the new county to her third husband Eudes Comte de Troyes, who was disinherited of his paternal inheritance and sought refuge in Normandy where he and his descendants were accepted as counts of Aumâle as vassals of the dukes. The king of France captured the castle of Aumâle in 1196, and awarded the title to Renaud de Dammartin Comte de Boulogne in Dec 1204.\n\nA. SEIGNEURS d'AUMÂLE\n\n1.GUERINFRID, son of ---.

The Complete Peerage states that \"John dEston [Eshton, Yorkshire]\" claimed descent from \"Avice, daughter as he averred\" of Guillaume \"le Gros\" Comte dAumâle . The order dated 4 Nov 1278 indicates his descent, presumably through Constance, supposed daughter of Amice, and Ranulph, supposed son of Constance (although these relationships are not specified in the order). No indication has been found of the identity of the supposed husbands of Amice or of her supposed daughter Constance. Sir C. G. Young suggested that the whole claim by John de Ashton was a fiction to give the king \"a colourable pretence for retaining the honour in his own hands, as by admitting the fictitious claim, and then purchasing it from him, he shut out the real claim that might have been justly made by Wivelby (see below)\" . Young also points out that, if the claim had been valid, John de Ashton would have been the heir to all the honour of Albemarle and all the lands in Craven which were inherited from Amices supposed mother, and that it seems incredible that he would have relinquished such wealth for compensation which was valued at only one hundred pounds annually.]\n\nComte Guillaume had one illegitimate child by an unknown mistress:\n\niii)GEOFFROY . \"Cecilia comitissa Albamarlie\" donated land \"inter Esc et Duden Kirkesantan et Haverigg et Thueites\" to St Bees, and confirmed the donation of \"ecclesia de Gosford\" made by \"W[illelmi] fratris mei\", by undated charter, witnessed by \"Galfrido filio comitis \" .

The chronology, as well as the names of the individuals concerned, suggests that Enguerrand may have been the same person as Enguerrand Vicomte dAumâle who, with his son Etienne, is named in a charter of Lannoy abbey dated 1155 (see Part E below).\n\nc) [--- . m ---. One possible child:]\n\ni) [EUPHEMIE . Her origin is indicated by the charter dated to [1150/60] under which W. comes Albemarle granted property to Eufemie nepti mee uxori Roberti de Brus . Domesday Descendants speculates that she was the daughter of Guillaumes brother Enguerrand , although there seems no reason to choose one of his brothers over any of the others. Another possibility is that she was the daughter of Guillaumes sister Mathilde, whose husband Guermond de Picquigny is recorded with a sister named Euphemie. Robertus de Brus notified his donation to the hospital of St Peter, York by charter dated to [1150/70], witnessed by domina Eufemia  . m ROBERT de Brus Lord of Annandale, son of ROBERT de Brus Lord of Skelton and Annandale & his first wife Agnes de Payanell (-after [1170/90]).]\n\nd)ETIENNE dAumâle (-after 1150). Gulielmus comes Albemarliæ donated property to Melsa Abbey, for the souls of Hingeram fratris mei et Stephani .

Young recorded that \"Wivelby\" (referring to Philip de Wyvelesby ) proved his descent from Etienne (incorrectly called \"Simon\" in the Complete Peerage ), brother of Guillaume \"le Gros\" Comte dAumâle .\n\ne) daughter . A manuscript history of the foundation of Melsa Abbey records that Willielmus had sorores quatuor, filias Stephani who married una vicedomino de Pynkeney, altera vicedomino de Verberay, tertia Bertanno de Brikebet, quarta Willielmo de Romare et postea Petro de Brus . m RICHARD de Gerberoy, son of ---.\n\nf)ADELISE d'Aumâle ([1110/20?]-before [1168] ).

Her birth date is estimated very approximately to [1110/20] to test the chronology of her descendants. \"Adeliza daughter of [Stephen] count Albemaris\" donated property to the abbey of Saint-Sauveur-le-Vicomte for the souls of \"Engelger her husband and Robert Bertrand her son\" by charter dated to [1151/77] . m firstly ROBERT [II] Bertrand Seigneur de Briquebec, son of ROBERT [I] Bertrand \"le Tors\" & his wife Suzanne ---. m secondly as his second wife, INGELGER de Bohun, son of RICHARD de Meri & his wife Lucie --- (-[1172]).\n\ng) [MATHILDE/BEATRIX] d'Aumâle . A manuscript history of the foundation of Melsa Abbey records that Willielmus had sorores quatuor, filias Stephani who married una vicedomino de Pynkeney, altera vicedomino de Verberay, tertia Bertanno de Brikebet, quarta Willielmo de Romare et postea Petro de Brus . The chronology suggests that the husband of the sister who married vicedomino de Pynkeney was Gérard de Picquigny, but it is not known whether it was his first or second wife. The date of her parents marriage (before [1100) suggests that she may have been his first wife, whose name was Mathilde: Gérard de Picquigny granted tithes of salt at Wimering to Southwick priory, for the souls of his parents and his wife Matilda, and for the salvation of himself and his heirs, by charter dated [1160/65] . The distinction between the two groups of beneficiaries suggests that Mathilde was deceased at the time of the donation. On the other hand the marriage date of her sister Agnes (after 1143) suggests that her identity as Gérards second wife cannot be excluded. The name of Gérards second wife was Beatrix: Daire indicates that Beatrix wife of Gérard de Picquigny paroît dans les Chartes en 1154 but provides no primary source citation . m [as his first/second wife,] GERARD de Picquigny Vidame d'Amiens, son of GUERMOND [II] de Picquigny Vidame d'Amiens & his wife Beatrix --- (-1178, bur Abbaye du Gard).\n\nh)AGNES dAumâle . A manuscript history of the foundation of Melsa Abbey records that Willielmus had sorores quatuor, filias Stephani who married una vicedomino de Pynkeney, altera vicedomino de Verberay, tertia Bertanno de Brikebet, quarta Willielmo de Romare et postea Petro de Brus . Secondary sources often indicate that Agness husband was in fact Adam [I] de Brus. This conclusion is based not only on the assumption that the manuscript history mistook \"Petro\" for \"Adam\", but also that it reversed the order of Agness marriages: the birth date of Isabel, daughter of Adam [II] de Brus (son of Adam [I]), estimated to [1168/70] on the basis of her first marriage in [1180], suggests the likelihood that Adam [II] was born before 1143 (approximate date of Agness marriage to William de Roumare) rather than after 1151 (date of death of William de Roumare). As a general principle, it appears preferable to find ways of confirming that a primary source is factually correct rather than justifying why it is in error. No other primary source has yet been identified which names Agnes as the wife of Adam, or as the mother of his children. In addition, as noted in SCOTLAND KINGS, Peter [I] de Brus was named in a charter dated to [1155/65]. It is therefore possible that the manuscript history is factually correct and that Agnes dAumâle married Peter as her second husband, presumably as his second wife considering his likely age by that time. While waiting for other primary source information to emerge, this appears to be a safer interim conclusion compared with assuming that the manuscript history made two factual errors, relating to the name of Agness Brus husband and to the order of her marriages. m firstly (after 1143) WILLIAM de Roumare, son of WILLIAM Seigneur de Roumare & his wife Hawise de Reviers (-1151). m secondly (after 1151) [as his second wife,] PETER [I] de Brus, son of --- (-after [1155/65]).\n\nC. COMTES d'AUMÂLE (FORZ)\n\nStapleton states that \"the surname de Fortibus\" was derived from \"Fors, a commune in the canton of Prahecq, arrondissement of Niort, departement of Deux Sèvres, in Poitou\" . Unfortunately, he purports to justify this statement by quoting the charter dated Feb 1233 (O.S.) under which A[lix] comitissa Augi confirmed that she relinquished \"terram de Forz ex eschæta Guillelmi quondam domini de Forz et comitis Aubemarle\" to Louis IX King of France , which makes no mention of the location of \"terram de Forz\". No indication has yet been found of any connection between Guillaume de Forz and the village of Fors, which lies due south of Niort in the département of Deux-Sèvres, although the Feb 1233 charter does suggest a geographical connection with a place named Forz/Fors. The editor of the published edition of the Layette du Trésor des Chartes, in which the charter is reproduced, assumes that what he terms \"la terre des Forts\" was in Normandy. This would explain how Alix Ctss dEu obtained an interest in the property, the county of Eu being adjacent to the county of Aumâle in north-east Normandy. In addition, his marriage to the heiress of the county of Aumâle could best be explained if Guillaume de Forz was a powerful local nobleman. On the other hand, an origin in Poitou is suggested by Roger of Hoveden who names \"Willelmum de Forz de Ulerum\" , presumably indicating the island of Oléron, due west of Rochefort in the present-day French département of Charente-Maritime. The origin of the family of Guillaume [II] [de Forz], who is shown below, in Oléron appears confirmed by a charter dated 4 May 1150 under which Bernard Bishop of Saintes settled a dispute between Notre-Dame de Saintes and \"Willelmum Aimerici quendam baronem de Holerone\" concerning \"decime...terre...de Bonamia\", which the bishop found that Gauterius de Forz avus eius had donated when Aiteldem filiam suam had entered the monastery as a nun . It is assumed that Guillaume [II] was descended from the same Forz family who were barons of Oléron (see POITOU, BARONS dOLERON), although his precise descent has not been confirmed. Other primary sources refer to Guillaume and his family as \"de Fortibus\", rather than \"de Forz\". This recalls Guillaume de Vivonne \"de Fortibus\", son of Hugues de Vivonne seneschal of Gascony (see POITOU, SEIGNEURS de VIVONNE). In the case of Guillaume de Vivonne, there is no indication that \"de Fortibus\" was used in any other way than as a personal nickname which was not transmitted to his descendants. In his case, it is likely that the name was presumably the ablative plural of the Latin adjective fors/fortis, used in a nominal sense to indicate that the person in question was \"among the strongest\". No family relationship has been traced between the Vivonne and Forz families.\n\nGUILLAUME [II] [de Forz] [Fortibus], son of --- (-1195) . Roger of Hoveden records that Richard I King of England appointed \"Girardum Auxiensem archiepiscopum, et Bernardum episcopum de Baonia, et Robertum de Sablun, et Ricardum de Camvilla, et Willelmum de Forz de Ulerum\" as \"ductores et constabularios totius navigii sui\" at Chinon, dated to Jun 1190 .

SEIGNEURS dESTOUTEVILLE\n\nAccording to Le Prévost, this family originated in \"Etouteville-sur-Mer, canton dYerville\" , situated in the Pays de Caux about 30 kilometers north-west of Rouen. The family was studied in the early 20th century by Gabriel de la Morandière . He appears to clarify adequately the relationship between the Estouteville family in Normandy and the Stuteville family in England. However, his account of the descent of the various branches of the English Stuteville family is confused and contradictory (see UNTITLED ENGLISH NOBILITY P-S). In particular, he allocates to the English branch several of the members of the French branch, shown below, who also held property in England. Concerning the French descent, Morandière cites enough primary source material to clarify some incompatibilities in the reconstruction presented by Père Anselme but he also perpetuates errors, some of which have hopefully been corrected below . The family was also studied more recently by Clay , parts of whose work have been consulted. The reconstructions in Europäische Stammtafeln appear broadly reliable but still include some of Morandières errors so should be used cautiously .\n\n[Three] siblings, parents not known:\n\n1.ROBERT [I] dEstouteville (-after 1106). The Liber Vitæ of Durham names \"Robertus de Stuteville, Beatrix uxor eius, Robertus, Graulfus, Willelmus filii eorum, Emma Robertus \" and in a later passage the same names with the last two replaced by \"Emme uxor Rodberti, Rodbertus filius eius \" . Domesday Descendants suggests that these entries refer to Robert [I] dEstouteville and his family . Orderic Vitalis quotes a charter, dated to [1066/89], witnessed by \" Rodbertus de Stotavilla \" . A charter of King Henry II records donations to York St Mary, including the donation of land in Edelyngthorp Harton et decimas de dominio suo de Cukewald et Honingham, Kirkeby, Buttercram et Strayngham et Langtuna et in Cucewald by Robertus de Stutavilla, as well as land \"in Mitona\" by \"Robertus de Maisnil et Robertus de Stutaville\" . Orderic Vitalis names \" Rodbertum de Stotavilla \" among the supporters of Robert III Duke of Normandy in 1105, among those who were captured at the battle of Tinchebrai in 1106, and who were condemned to life imprisonment . m BEATRICE, daughter of ---. The Liber Vitæ of Durham names \"Robertus de Stuteville, Beatrix uxor eius, Robertus, Graulfus, Willelmus filii eorum, Emma Robertus \" . Domesday Descendants suggests that these entries refer to Robert [I] de Stuteville and his family . Morandière states that \"Robert I le vieux dEstouteville et son autre sur Amaurie ont épousé Blanche et Alain, enfants de Guéthénoc Sire de Rieux\" (who he says was descended from a younger son of Alain I Duke of Brittany, who died in 907) but cites no primary source on which the information is based . It is not impossible that \"Blanche\" was an error for \"Beatrice\", but no other corroboration has yet been found for her alleged parentage. Morandières work does not appear convincing in relation to the early generations of the Estouteville family and it is suggested that the information should be treated with caution. Robert [I] & his wife had four children:\n\na)EMMA dEstouteville (-bur Ouche Saint-Evroul) . The Liber Vitæ of Durham names \"Robertus de Stuteville, Beatrix uxor eius, Robertus, Graulfus, Willelmus filii eorum, Emma Robertus \" and in a later passage the same names with the last two replaced by \"Emme uxor Rodberti, Rodbertus filius eius \" . The chronology of her marriages suggests that she must have been considerably older than her brother Robert, maybe born from an earlier marriage of their father. Orderic Vitalis records that Robert de Grantmesnil, son of Hugo de Grentemaisnilio and his wife, married secondly Emmam Rodberti de Stotevilla filiam . The chronology of these families suggests that Emma must have been Roberts first wife not his second. La Roque states that une généalogie de la maison dEstouteville names Errands wife as Emme et la comprend entre ceux du sang...[de] Robert dEstouteville, suggesting that she was the same person who later married Hugues de Grentesmesnil . The passage is somewhat garbled and in any case La Roque does not provide a citation reference to the source in question or quote it in his Preuves. It is suggested that, until further documentation comes to light, this supposed marriage of Errand should be treated with caution. Orderic Vitalis records that Robert de Grantmesnil died Kal Jun 38 years after his father and was buried at Ouche cum duabus uxoribus suis: Agnete et Emma . [m firstly ERRAND Seigneur d'Harcourt, son of ANSCHETIL dHarcourt & his wife --- (-after 1078).] m [secondly] as his [first] wife, ROBERT de Grantmesnil, son of HUGUES de Grantmesnil & his wife Adelise de Beaumont-sur-Oise ([before 1060]-1 Jun [1136], bur Ouche Saint-Evroul).\n\nb)ROBERT [II] dEstouteville (-after Aug 1138) .
