        "text": "Prevost Founded: 1924\n\nPrévost Car, better known as just Prevost (pronounced pray-voh), is a North American motorcoach manufacturer. It is owned by Volvo Buses, a division of Volvo Group, and has its corporate headquarters and major manufacturing facilities in Sainte-Claire, Quebec, Canada.\n\nHistory\n\nPrevost's history goes back to 1924 when cabinet maker Eugene Prévost created his first wooden coach body. This coach body was built on a REO truck chassis.[1]\n\nEarly buses used an all-wood body and frame. This was later changed to a metal body on a wooden frame. In 1945, Prevost produced their first all-metal body over an all-metal frame. The company became known as Les Ateliers Prevost in 1947, and as bus production increased, Prevost gradually phased out cabinet work and completely focused on motorcoach production by 1957.[2]\n\nIndustrialist Paul Normand acquired the company and renamed it Prevost Car Inc. in 1957. They focused on developing more reliable and comfortable motorcoaches. Their new product, the Le Normand, made its debut in 1957.[3]\n\nPrevost entered the United States market with dealership in New Jersey which opened in 1967. This was soon followed by one Los Angeles. In, 1968 two American businessmen, Thomas B. Harbison and William G. Campbell partnership with then Prevost president André Normand, and became the company’s sole owners in 1969.[4]\n\nPrevost produced North American's first 102 inch wide motorcoaches in 1984, and in 1985, produced North America's first the articulated motorcoach the Prevost H5-60. The development of the H5-60 lead to the introduction of Prevost's H-Series motorcoach in 1989.[5]\n\nIn 1995, Prevost was acquired by Volvo Bus Corporation and Henlys Group plc. Prevost received ISO 9001 certification covering their manufacturing and design operations in 1997. The following year, they received ISO 14001 certification for environmental management systems related to manufacturing and design operations.[6] Prevost acquired transit bus manufacturer Nova Bus in 1998, and in 2004, Volvo became the sole owners of Prevost and Nova Bus.[7]\n\nIn early 2008, the Volvo D13 engine was made an option for Prevost coaches as Detroit Diesel announced that it would no longer sell its engines to companies outside of the Daimler family starting in 2010. The first production Volvo powered X3-45 models were built for Wilson Bus Lines of Templeton, Massachusetts. In December 2008, Prevost announced that they will sell Volvo's 9700 coach in North America. It formally made its debut at the 2009 United Mtorcoach Association Expo in Florida. [8]\n\nBy March 2020 as COVID-19 spread to Canada and the United States, Prevost began to take precautions at their manufacturing and sales facilities. Visitor numbers were restricted, more business was conducted remotely, and increased cleaning and sanitizing took place.[9] Prevost also extended warranties on coaches that were parked due to the unfolding pandemic. As part of a number of measures taken by the Quebec Government, all non-essential businesses in Quebec were closed as of March 24, 2020. Prevost’s Quebec-based operations were idled. Prevost's service centers and the aftermarket parts distribution warehouses were declared essential in various jurisdictions and remained open with many safety protocols in place.[10]\n\nIn May 2020, Prevost launched their CLEAN + CARE Program. This included free online training, remote contact, contact free delivery, and COVID-19 related safety measures for coaches. Prevost made the following available for operator: driver barriers, passenger information decals, distancing decals, air purifier systems, fans in roof hatches, hand sanitizer dispensers, electrostatic spraying systems, filtration systems, masks, passenger partitions, and headrest covers.[11]\n\nPrevost reopened their factory in Quebec on June 1, 2020. They were able to bring back about half of the laid-off workers.[12]\n\nPrevost announced the discontinuation of operations at their Plattsburgh, New York assembly plant after completing a run of X3-45 commuter coaches for New York City MTA. The Prevost assembly lines will be used by Nova Bus going forward, with Nova Bus citing the need for more electric bus manufacturing capacity.
