Cleveland, fils naturel de Cromwell (1731â1739), in Åuvres de PrÃ©vost (Presses Universitaires de Grenoble, 1977â1986), vol. 2. Numbers in square brackets in HTML text are page references keyed to this edition.\n\nA chronology and annotation of the novel are round in vol. 8 of the same edition, pp. 81â186.\n\nPage references in PrÃ©vostâs other novels are to the same edition.\n\nAbbreviations used in notes:\n\nMHQ MÃ©moires et aventures dâun homme de qualitÃ©\n\nML MÃ©moires du chevalier des Grieux et de Manon Lescaut\n\nDK Le Doyen de Killerine\n\nGM Histoire dâune Grecque moderne\n\nMM Le Monde moral\n\nHGV Histoire gÃ©nÃ©rale des voyages\n\nPC Le Pour et contre, periodical directed by PrÃ©vost.\n\nP.R.

IV, p. 81), was published in London in April 1731 by Nicolas PrÃ©vost and E. Symon. The next two volumes appeared sometime in 1732 under the sole name of Nicolas PrÃ©vost. T. Astley bought the rights after N. PrÃ©vost went bankrupt in November 1733, and reissued the four volumes under his own title page in 1734. In 1735 he added the apocryphal fifth volume the original of which had already appeared in Holland, and reissued all of these in 1741.\n\nAs a result, the real sequel to Cleveland, in three volumes published in Paris in 1738-1739, has never been translated into English. (For more details on the publication history, see Philip Stewart, âPrÃ©vost et son Cleveland: essai de mise au point historiqueâ, Dix-HuitiÃ¨me SiÃ¨cle nÂº 7 [1975], pp. 181â208.)"
