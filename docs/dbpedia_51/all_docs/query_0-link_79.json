        "text": "They’ve just joined us :Flore Meyer-Prévost\n\nWHERE ARE YOU FROM?\n\nI’m from Paris suburb, always lived near Paris and really enjoying it!\n\nONE WORD TO DESCRIBE YOUR JOB ?\n\nNerd stuff. And complaining. A lot of complaining actually.\n\nWHAT ANIMAL WOULD YOU BE IF YOU WERE REINCARNATED?\n\nA penguin! I have a slight obsession with penguins, in fact did you know that they have knees? You can’t see them because they’re inside their bodies but they have them! So yeah, penguin.\n\nDO YOU HAVE A NICKNAME?\n\nMy french speakers friends like to call me “Fleur de Sel” which can be translated by “Salty Flower” or “Flower of salt” because of the second question…\n\nTHE MOVIE THAT CHANGED YOUR LIFE?\n\nMr Nobody by Jaco Von Dormael. Kinda niche but really a wonderful movie and I saw it before starting to despise Jared Leto so it stays a good memory.\n\nTHE PROFESSIONAL ACHIEVEMENT YOU ARE MOST PROUD OF?\n\nBeing almost well in late capitalism.\n\nWHAT SONG ARE YOU LISTENING TO ON REPEAT RIGHT NOW?\n\nI’ve been in love with french rap for a decade and my answer will change every two weeks but right now it’s Eleanor by Jewel Usain & Prince Waly. I don’t know what I like the most between the music and the clip so… make your own opinion about it (watch out, kinda violent)!\n\nONLINE OR FACE-TO-FACE GAME?\n\nCrouch coop game or solo game, I don’t really play much of competitive games except Smash Bros.\n\nWHAT IS THE LAST APPLICATION YOU DOWNLOADED?\n\nKensho, a beautiful atmospheric puzzle game with really nice cinematic.\n\nYOUR FAVORITE MOTTO ?\n\n“It always seemed easier for the oppressor rather than for the oppressed to adapt to the oppression.” It’s a quote from Paul Nizan talking about media figures during the 20th century."
