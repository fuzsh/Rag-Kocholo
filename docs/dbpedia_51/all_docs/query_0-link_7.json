        "text": "Sources:\n\nCensus - \"Census of Pointe Coupee, Louisiana, 1745\" edited by Bill Barron (called Collet, married to Jves (Yves/Ines) Dubos, age: 45)\n\nNicolas PRÉVOST was born about 1700. The location of his birth is unknown. 1257 (It was originally believed that his parents were Claude PRÉVOST and Marie RORNIE/RERNIE and that he was born in Longuille, Bishopric of Boulogne, France. However, a 1732 marriage record in New Orleans for a Nicolas Prévost, s/o Claude and Marie Rernie, is likely where this erroneous parentage came from. The Nicolas who married in 1732 could not be our Nicolas (who married c1723) because our Nicolas was married to Yves Dubos from 1723 until c1760.) He appeared in the census in 1726 in Natchitoches (Natchitoches Parish), Louisiana, USA with his wife, Ines, and one child. He appeared in the census in 1745 in (Pointe Coupée Parish), Louisiana, USA with his wife, Ines, four children (Pierre, Joseph, Antoine and Marie Francoise), two slaves and 25 arpents in cultivation with corn, beans and tobacco.1257 Nicolas died before 7 January 1762. On that date, he was listed as deceased on the marriage record of his daughter, Marie Françoise, to Bernard Auricoste which took place in New Orleans.1587 Inès DUBOT and Nicolas PRÉVOST251 were likely married about 1723/4 but a marriage record has not been found.\n\n1257: Edited by Bill Barron, Introduction by Winston DeVille, F.A.S.G., compiler, \"Census of Pointe Coupee, Louisiana, 1745\" (New Orleans, Louisiana: Polyanthos, 1978). 1587: Deceased at time of marriage of daughter, Marie Francoise. 251: Jeraldine Dufour Lacour, compiler, \"Bride's Book of Avoyelles Parish, Louisiana, Volume I, 1808-1855\", (Bunkie, Louisiana:, 1979) Page 77 (Marriage of his daughter, Julie Roy).\n\nhttp://louisianalineage.com/b61.htm"
