        "text": "ANCESTORS of JUANITA FREDERICK\n\nDescendants of Nicolas Prevost and Ives Dubo\n\nGeneration No. 1\n\nJF1.NICOLAS1 PREVOST was born Abt. 1700 in La Rochelle, France1, and died Bef. January 1762 in LA2. He married IVES DUBO 17233, daughter of RENE DUBOT and ELIZABETH DUVAL. She was born Abt. 17064.\n\nNotes for NICOLAS PREVOST:\n\nAlthough some sources show a second wife, Marie-Therese BERTRAND, for Nicolas PREVOST, he was still married to Ives DUBOS in 1745. A Nicolas PREVOST from Boulogne, France, married Marie-Therese BERTRAND in New Orleans in 1732; this is Nicolas PROVOST dit BLONDIN. Nicolas PREVOST married to Ives DUBOS is apparently not the son of Claude PROVOST and Marie RORNIE.\n\nMore About NICOLAS PREVOST:\n\nCensus: 1745, Pointe Coupee Parish, LA4\n\nChildren of NICOLAS PREVOST and IVES DUBO are:\n\n2. i. JOSEPH2 PREVOST, b. 1726, Natchitoches, LA; d. November 19, 1806.\n\n3.ii. MARIE FRANCOISE PREVOST, b. Abt. 1745, Pointe Coupee Parish, LA.\n\nGeneration No. 2\n\nJF2.JOSEPH2 PREVOST (NICOLAS1) was born 1726 in Natchitoches, LA6,7, and died November 19, 18067. He married (1) MAGDELEINE MAYEUX April 15, 1749 in St. Francis Church, Pointe Coupee Parish, LA8, daughter of PIERRE MAYEUX and MARIE CELLIER. She was born Abt. 17339, and died Abt. March 27, 1758. He married (2) JEANNE DAUBLIN July 12, 1759 in St. Francis Church, Pointe Coupee Parish, LA10, daughter of VALENTINE DAUBLIN and MARIE-MARGUERITE DECUIR. She was born Abt. 173811, and died Bef. May 177712,13.\n\nMore About JOSEPH PREVOST:\n\nSurname: dit Collette\n\nCensus 1: 1745, Pointe Coupee Parish, LA14\n\nCensus 2: 1771, Attakapas, LA15\n\nChildren of JOSEPH PREVOST and MAGDELEINE MAYEUX are:\n\n4. i. FRANCOIS3 PREVOST, b. May 25, 1752, Pointe Coupee Parish, LA; d. February 24, 1818, St. Mary Parish, LA.\n\nii. JEAN-BAPTISTE PREVOST, b. March 13, 175420.\n\nMore About JEAN-BAPTISTE PREVOST:\n\nBaptism: April 09, 1754, St. Louis Church, New Orleans, LA20\n\niii. MADELEINE PREVOST, b. March 15, 175821; m. ANTOINE BONIN, January 11, 1779, St. Martin Church, St. Martinville, LA22,23; b. Abt. 1743, Mobile, AL24.\n\nNotes for MADELEINE PREVOST:\n\nIn the marriage record, Madeleine is simply given as \"Madeleine of Pointe Coupee\", with no parent names. The birth of Madeleine PREVOST is listed in the Pointe Coupee records under Madeleine COLLETTE, born to Joseph PREVOST dit COLLETTE and Madeleine MAYEUX. Madeleine MAYEUX, wife of Joseph PREVOST, died about 10 days after giving birth to Madeleine. I have no proof that this is the same Madeleine PREVOST who married Antoine BONIN, but given the ties between the PREVOST and BONIN families (Francois PREVOST married Genevieve BONIN), I am reasonably confident of my assignment. But there is room for error here.\n\nMore About MADELEINE PREVOST:\n\nBaptism: April 02, 1758, St. Francis Church, Pointe Coupee Parish, LA25\n\n3.MARIE FRANCOISE2 PREVOST (NICOLAS1) was born Abt. 1745 in Pointe Coupee Parish, LA28,29.

He was born January 15, 1779 in Attakapas, LA51, and died September 05, 1847 in New Iberia, LA52.\n\nNotes for MANETTE PREVOST:\n\nThis reference actually is to the death of \"Mrs. Eugene Borel\", who died at age over 60 years.
