        "text": "Prevost History, Family Crest & Coats of Arms\n\nOrigins Available:\n\nEngland\n\nFrance\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly Origins of the Prevost family\n\nThe surname Prevost was first found in Rutland where they held a family seat as Lords of the Manor. After the Battle of Hastings in 1066, William, Duke of Normandy, having prevailed over King Harold, granted most of Britain to his many victorious Barons. It was not uncommon to find a Baron, or a Bishop, with 60 or more Lordships scattered throughout the country. These he gave to his sons, nephews and other junior lines of his family and they became known as under-tenants. They adopted the Norman system of surnames which identified the under-tenant with his holdings so as to distinguish him from the senior stem of the family. After many rebellious wars between his Barons, Duke William, commissioned a census of all England to determine in 1086, settling once and for all, who held which land. He called the census the Domesday Book, 1 indicating that those holders registered would hold the land until the end of time. Hence, conjecturally, the surname is descended from the tenant of the lands who was recorded in the Domesday Book census of 1086. This notable family, Prevost de la Croix, held a family seat in Poinou. They held the fiefs of Sonnotte, Prejailly, Villette, Bodes, le Pesse, and Bouteliere.\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly History of the Prevost family\n\nThis web page shows only a small excerpt of our Prevost research.

They made many attempts but failed in some to establish settlements on the Islands including Saint Lucia and Grenada. By 1627 they had managed to establish settlements on St. Kitts (St. Christopher) and Barbados, but by 1641 the Spanish had moved in and destroyed some of these including those at Providence Island. The British continued to expand the settlements including setting the First Federation in the British West Indies by 1674; some of the islands include Barbados, Bermuda, Cayman Island, Turks and Caicos, Jamaica and Belize then known as British Honduras. By the 1960's many of the islands became independent after the West Indies Federation which existed from 1958 to 1962 failed due to internal political conflicts. After this a number of Eastern Caribbean islands formed a free association. 8\n\nPrevost Settlers in West Indies in the 17th Century\n\nJohn Prevost, who settled in Barbados in 1685\n\nContemporary Notables of the name Prevost (post 1700) +\n\nSir George Prevost (1804-1893), English Baronet, tractarian, only son of Sir George Prevost (1767–1816)\n\nEdwin Prévost (b. 1942), English drummer and percussionist\n\nLouis Augustin Prévost (1796-1858), French linguist, born at Troyes in Champagne; he emigrated to England in 1823 and was at first a tutor but afterwards was keeper of the prints in the British Museum\n\nSir George Prevost (1767-1816), British soldier, Governor in Chief of Canada (1811-1815), eldest son of Major-general Augustine Prevost (d. 1786), who served under Wolfe\n\nYves Prévost (1908-1997), Canadian politician and lawyer in Quebec, Canada\n\nPierre Dominique Prévost, French Brigadier General during the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars from 1789 to 1815 9\n\nGédéon-Mélasippe Prévost (1817-1887), French Canadian notary and politician\n\nFrançoise Prévost (1930-1997), French actress, journalist and author\n\nEugène Prévost (1898-1965), French Canadian carpenter who developed wooden bus shells which later led to the production of coach buses and motor homes\n\nFlorent Prévost (1794-1870), French naturalist and illustrator\n\n...

Mottoes first began to be shown with arms in the 14th and 15th centuries, but were not in general use until the 17th century. Thus the oldest coats of arms generally do not include a motto. Mottoes seldom form part of the grant of arms: Under most heraldic authorities, a motto is an optional component of the coat of arms, and can be added to or changed at will; many families have chosen not to display a motto.\n\nMotto: Servatum cineri\n\nMotto Translation: Faith kept with the dead\n\nCitations +\n\nWilliams, Dr Ann.
