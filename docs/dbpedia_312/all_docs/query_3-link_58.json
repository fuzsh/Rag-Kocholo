        "text": "I hate it. Actually, let me debunk all of his most wanked feats.\n\nLifting the mountains\n\nA couple things you should know about Chinese cosmology at that time. That shit was small. They, no joke, thought that the sun, moon, planets and stars were all 840,000 miles up. ALL of them. But that's neither here nor there. See, those three mountains support the heavens. And by that I don't mean the sky, I mean that the mountains support different mountainside palaces with spirits and Gods in them. Sure, it's larger than the planet, but it's not a lot.\n\n2. His immortalities\n\nHis immortalities aren't all the same \"I can't die\" things. Some of them just made him really long-lived, others made it so that he couldn't die from injuries, some made it so that he wouldn't age. Plus, they can be removed. Like that time when some dudes shoved him into a furnace in an effort to remove his immortalities by melting his body away and then taking out the immortalities. It's stupid but that's myth for you.\n\nHis wank is so bad that a guy, Jim McClanahan, who actively studies this shit and is rather respected as an authority about Chinese culture and JTTW, basically said that MK holding up the milky way was bullshit.\n\nhttps://journeytothewestresearch.com/2018/08/04/misconceptions-about-monkeys-staff-and-the-milky-way-galaxy/\n\nWhatever."
