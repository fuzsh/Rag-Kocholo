        "text": "I've been really delving into his daunting catalogue lately. Of course, everyone knows the 90's/00's stuff, and 'Three Crowns For The Sailor' is a bonafide classic from his 80's output. However, most of his epic classics from the 80's are in desperate need of restoration. We recently screened a tattered copy of 1987's 'Life Is A Dream', and even in it's weakened state, it blew everyone away. However, his legendary rendition of 'Treasue Island' starring Martin Landau, his unbelievable, delirious French TV miniseries fantasy 'Manuel On The Island Of Wonders', 'The Blind Owl', and much of the rest of his seminal 1980's work needs to be restored & screened internationally ASAP. I heard rumblings of Criterion attempting to gain the rights to 'Treasure Island', but I hear the Ruiz estate is very difficult to work with. What are some of your favourite Ruiz films?\n\nThis has to be mine, and it's uploaded on YouTube with English subs, and in pretty darn good quality. 1983's legendary dark, brooding epic fantasy, 'City Of Pirates'."
