        "text": "Bobbie Edsor27 December 2019\n\nEvery language has a few phrases that don't always translate well — and the British English has some absolute corkers.\n\nOur team has compiled a list of the best British slang and idioms that define the weird and wonderful British dialect we grew up with.\n\nFrom our linguistic research, we've confirmed that above all, British people can be sarcastic, unsympathetic, and often rather drunk.\n\nEach term is partnered with a description and example. Some entries also feature surprising facts about the phrase's origins, with a few quintessentially British idioms not actually coming from British roots at all.\n\nWhether you think this list is the \"bee's knees\" or if it's enough to make you want to \"pop your clogs,\" scroll on to discover 88 very British phrases — in alphabetical order — that will confuse anybody who didn't grow up in the UK.\n\nShutterstock / Elenadesign\n\n\"A few sandwiches short of a picnic\"\n\nSomeone that lacks common sense might be described as \"a few sandwiches short of a picnic.\"\n\nThe phrase was first documented in the BBC's \"Lenny Henry Christmas Special\" in 1987.\n\n\"She's great fun, but she's a few sandwiches short of a picnic.\"\n\nBest winter breaks in Britain - in pictures\n\n\"Anorak\"\n\nAlthough it's more often used as a synonym for raincoat, an anorak is something slightly different in playground slang.\n\nSomeone that's a little bit geeky, with strong interests or expertise in a niche area, might be referred to as an \"anorak.\" This probably originates from the \"uncool\" appearance of anorak coats and the people wearing them.\n\n\"Thomas is such an anorak when it comes to train trivia.\"\n\n\"Bagsy\"\n\nCalling \"bagsy\" is the equivalent of calling \"shotgun\" or \"dibs\" when something, like the front seat of the car, is offered up to a group.\n\nSchoolkids might call \"bagsy\" on items from their friends' pack lunches, like an apple or a cereal bar, that the friend isn't going to eat.\n\n\"Does anyone want thi—\"\n\n\"Bagsy!\"\n\nPixabay\n\n\"Bee's knees\"\n\nRead More\n\nHow to keep your dogs and cats warm this week\n\nWhat is Lyme disease? Coronation Street's Joseph Brown gets bad news\n\nWhen are you supposed to take your Christmas tree down?\n\nSponsored\n\nMeet the fitness influencer defying stereotypes about ageing\n\nThis phrase became mainstream in the USA in the 1920s despite its British origins, but its popularity in the States has dwindled since the turn of the century.\n\nThe \"bee's knees\" referred to small or insignificant details when it was first documented in the 18th century. Since then, the phrase has evolved and refers to something at the \"height of cool.\"\n\n\"The Beatles are the bee's knees.\"\n\n\"Bender\"\n\nSomeone on a spree of excessive drinking and mischief is \"on a bender.\"\n\nBenders often last over 24 hours, and so you might say that someone is on \"a weekend bender,\" or a \"three-day bender.\"\n\n\"I bumped into him towards the end of his four-day bender. He was a wreck.\"\n\n\"Blinder\"\n\nTo \"pull a blinder\" involves achieving something difficult faultlessly and skilfully.\n\nThe phrase is most commonly used when the individual has been lucky and the person saying it is in disbelief that the first person has managed to pull it off.\n\n\"And did you see that equalising goal in the last minute of injury time? He pulled a blinder there.\"\n\n(Warner Bros)\n\n\"Bloody or \"Bleeding\"\n\nThis intensifier can be added to practically any sentence in order to demonstrate incredulity or anger.\n\nSome people consider \"bloody\" offensive (the origins of the word are widely disputed, so we can't be sure why) and it was considered a profanity until the mid-20th century.\n\nThe origins of the word are widely disputed. Some believe it's derived from the Dutch word \"blute,\" meaning \"bare.\" Others believe the word is a contraction of the 17th century phrase \"by our lady,\" and is blasphemous. This second theory has been disproved, however, by the slang's documentation predating the popularity of the phrase \"by our lady.\"\n\nNowadays, \"bloody\" is used widely — it's even used in children's films such as \"Harry Potter\" — and is arguably one of the most quintessentially British words on the list.\n\n\"That was bloody good.\"\n\n\"Bob's your uncle\"\n\nThe very British equivalent to \"Hey presto!\" or \"Et voila!\"\n\nThis phrase is used to describe a process which seems more difficult than it actually is.\n\n\"Press down the clutch, put it into gear, then slowly ease off the clutch again. Bob's your uncle — you're driving!\"\n\n\"Bog-standard\"\n\nSomething that is \"bog-standard\" is completely ordinary with no frills, embellishments, or add-ons.\n\nIts origins are somewhat unclear, but a \"bog\" is another word for a toilet in British slang, adding to the connotations that something \"bog-standard\" is unglamorous and unspecial.\n\n\"How was the hostel?\" \"Oh, nothing exciting to report. Just your bog-standard dorm, really.\"\n\nPixabay\n\n\"Boot\"\n\nThe \"boot\" is the compartment at the back of the car known as the \"trunk\" in American English.\n\n\"Shove the shopping in the boot.\"\n\n\"Botch job\"\n\nA repair job that's been completed in a hurry and will probably fall apart reasonably soon is considered a \"botch job.\"\n\n\"Sam did a botch job on these shelves — they're wonky!\"\n\n\"Brolly\"\n\nAbbreviation of \"umbrella.\"\n\n\"Grab your brolly, it's drizzling outside.\"\n\nPixabay\n\n\"Budge up\"\n\nAn informal way of asking someone to make room where they are sitting for you to sit down, too, would be asking them to \"budge up.\"\n\nIt's similar to \"scoot over\" or \"move over.\"\n\n\"Hey, there's loads of room on that bench. Budge up and make some room for us, too!\"\n\n\"Builder's tea\"\n\nThe name of a strongly-brewed cup of English breakfast tea with milk — the way that tea is most commonly drunk in the UK.\n\nIt's common courtesy to offer a labourer or builder working on your house a builder's tea while they're working — especially if they're working out in the cold. This is probably how the term came about.\n\n\"A bacon sandwich and a builder's tea. Now that's a proper breakfast.\"\n\n\"Butchers\"\n\n\"Butcher's hook\" is Cockney rhyming slang for \"look.\" Therefore, if you're \"having a butchers,\" you're having a look at something.\n\n\"Would you take a butchers at this broken bike for me?\"\n\nPixabay\n\n\"Cack-handed\"\n\nA task performed in an awkward or uncomfortable fashion, usually clumsily, would be described as \"cack-handed.\"\n\n\"Cack\" is old-fashioned slang for faeces.\n\n\"He handles a screwdriver very cack-handedly.\"\n\n\"Cheeky\"\n\nAn act which could be deemed as impolite or shameless, but for some reason comes across as funny or endearing to others, would be described as \"cheeky.\"\n\n\"Joe's children are absolute rascals — they tied my shoelaces together last week!\"\n\n\"Those cheeky monkeys.\"\n\n\"Chinese whispers\"\n\n\"Chinese whispers\" are rumours that have been circulated and watered down until they only vaguely resemble the truth.\n\nThe phrase originates from the game \"Chinese Whispers\" commonly played at children's parties. A phrase is whispered around a circle and the last person to hear the phrase has to guess what the initial phrase was.\n\n\"Simon heard from John that you were fired.\"\n\n\"What? No. I just had Friday off work.\"\n\n\"Oh. It must have been Chinese Whispers.\"\n\nPixabay\n\n\"Chinwag\"\n\nA \"good old chinwag\" is a good chat, catch up, or gossip with someone.\n\nThe action of chatting away — with the jaw bobbing up and down — resembles a chin \"wagging\" like a dog's tail.\n\n\"Those two are having a proper chinwag — I haven't been able to get a word in edgeways for half an hour!\"\n\n\"Chockablock\"\n\nSomething full to the brim, or rammed, could be described as \"chockalock.\"\n\nThis is sometimes shortened to \"chocka.\"\n\n\"We should've taken the other route. This road is chocka!\"\n\n\"Chuffed\"\n\nOverjoyed; full of pride.\n\n\"I heard you got the promotion. Congratulations! You must be chuffed.\"\n\n(Stefan Rousseau/PA Wire )\n\nStefan Rousseau/PA Wire\n\n\"Clanger\"\n\nAn obvious and indiscreet mistake or blunder.\n\nUnrelatedly, \"Clangers\" was also a children's TV show from the 1970s about pink mouse-like creatures that lived on the moon.\n\n\"You dropped a clanger there.\"\n\n\"Codswallop\"\n\nSomething untrue — often made up for dramatic effect.\n\nAlthough no one is completely sure of the word's origins, it could derive from the words \"cod\" and \"wallop,\" which historically meant \"imitation\" and \"beer\" respectively — implying that \"codswallop\" is the kind of rubbish you make up when drunk.\n\n\"Oh, what a load of codswallop!\"\n\n\"Cost a bomb\"\n\nExpensive.\n\n\"Your watch is gorgeous.\"\n\n\"I should hope so, it cost a bomb.\"\n\n(Shutterstock )\n\nShutterstock\n\n\"Cream crackered\"\n\nCockney rhyming slang for \"knackered,\" if you're \"cream crackered\" then you're incredibly tired.\n\nA \"knacker\" was the person that slaughtered worn-out horses in the 19th and 20th centuries for their meat, hoofs, and hide. So, if you're \"ready for the knacker's yard,\" you're exhausted beyond relief.\n\n\"This week's done me in already, and it's only Tuesday. I'm cream crackered.\"\n\n\"Curtain twitcher\"\n\nA nosey neighbour, often caught peering out on their street's activities from a curtained window, might be referred to as a \"curtain twitcher.\"\n\n\"He's obsessed with anything that happens on this street. He's a bloody curtain twitcher, but he still won't sign for our packages.\"\n\n\"Dench\"\n\nAn adjective used to advocate something that is impressive or agreeable, dench is the equivalent of \"solid\" or \"cool\" when used in response to someone else.\n\nIts reported creator, British rapper Lethal Bizzle, elusively told the Guardian that the word \"means anything you want.\"\n\n\"I'm going to make us spaghetti carbonara for dinner.\"\n\n\"Dench.\"\n\nPixabay\n\n\"Dim\"\n\nSomeone that lacks common knowledge might be described as \"dim,\" whilst someone that's intelligent might be described as \"bright.\"\n\n\"She's a bit dim.\"\n\n\"Doddle\"\n\nAn easy task is a \"doddle.\"\n\nThe word could be a variation of \"toddle\" — like a young child's first steps.\n\n\"This will be a doddle.\"\n\n\"Dog's dinner\"\n\nA \"dog's dinner\" is a mess or fiasco — sometimes also referred to as a \"dog's breakfast.\"\n\n\"You've made a dog's dinner of that.\"\n\nPixabay\n\n\"Faff\"\n\nTo \"faff\" is to waste time doing very little.\n\n\"Faff\" comes from the 17th century word \"faffle,\" which means to flap about in the wind.\n\n\"We were just faffing about.\"\n\n\"Fag\"\n\nA cigarette.\n\nA \"fag end\" is also the ratty bits towards the ends of a reel of fabric, which are the worst and the cheapest bits of the reel. Historically, \"fags\" were the cheaper cigarettes made of lower grade tobacco, however, the slang has spread to encompass all cigarettes.\n\n\"Could I pinch a fag, please?\"\n\n\"Fit\"\n\nUsed to describe someone physically attractive, usually referring to their physique.\n\n\"He's fit.\"\n\nPixabay\n\n\"Flog\"\n\nTo \"flog\" means to sell something — usually quickly and cheaply.\n\n\"Flogging\" also refers to whipping a racehorse in order to make it move faster, so there is some speculation into whether you flog goods in order to make them shift faster, too. However, there is no proof for this theory.\n\n\"I'm trying to flog my old sofa. Do you know anyone that might be interested?\"\n\n\"Full Monty\"\n\nAfter \"The Full Monty\" film was released in 1997, there was some international confusion over the phrase in which it was taken as a euphemism for stripping. However, \"the full Monty\" actually refers to pursuing something to the absolute limits.\n\n\"The full Monty\" historically refers to an old tailor called Sir Montague Burton. Going \"the fully Monty\" meant purchasing a full three-piece suit, a shirt, and all of the trimmings.\n\n\"Our Christmas dinner had everything from sprouts to Yorkshire puddings. If you're going to have a roast, have the full Monty!\"\n\n\"Full of beans\"\n\nSomeone that's energetic, lively, or enthusiastic might be described as \"full of beans.\"\n\nThis phrase could be a reference to coffee beans, although these claims have been disputed.\n\n\"Goodness, you're full of beans this morning!\"\n\nScott Webb/Unsplash\n\n\"Gaff\"\n\n\"Gaff\" is an informal word for \"home.\"\n\nAlthough the origins of this phrase are largely unknown, a gaff in the 18th-century was a music hall or theatre, and so it's believed to derive from this.\n\n\"What are you up to this weekend? We've got a party at our gaff, if you fancy it?\"\n\n\"Gallivanting\"\n\nTo \"gallivant\" means to roam, or to set off on an expedition, with the sole intention of having some light-hearted fun.\n\nHistorically, \"gallant\" described someone brave or valiant, so \"gallivanting\" is a carefree and confident act.\n\n\"Off they go again, gallivanting.\"\n\n\"Geezer\"\n\nA \"geezer\" is a man that could be described as \"suave\" or \"dapper,\" and is often suited and booted. Men from east London are also commonly referred to as \"geezers.\"\n\nGeezer is thought to stem from the 15th century \"guiser,\" which meant well-dressed.\n\n\"That guy's got such swagger — he's a proper geezer.\"\n\nShutterstock\n\n\"Give me a tinkle on the blower\"\n\n\"Give me a call\" or \"ring me.\" The phrase is sometimes shortened to \"give me a tinkle.\"\n\n\"Tinkle\" refers to a phone's ring, while \"blower\" is slang or telephone and refers to the device that predated phones on Naval ships. Sailors would blow down a pipe to their recipient, where a whistle at the end of the pipe would sound to spark attention.\n\n\"Give me a tinkle on the blower.\"\n\n\"Gobsmacked\"\n\nAstounded; bewildered; shocked.\n\n\"Gob\" is slang for mouth, so if you're gobsmacked, you're shocked to the point of clasping your jaw in disbelief.\n\n\"I was gobsmacked!\"\n\n\"Gutted\"\n\nNot to be confused with literally being disembowelled, someone that says they're \"gutted\" is devastated or extremely upset.\n\n\"I was absolutely gutted.\"\n\nThe 5th/Unsplash\n\n\"Half past\"\n\nWhile Americans are more likely to say \"seven thirty\" or \"five fifty,\" Brits will more often than not refer to times in \"minutes past\" the hour.
