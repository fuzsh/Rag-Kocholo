        "text": "Does it hinder an artist to be adored by a coterie? Can a filmmaker be obscured by the vastness of his output?\n\nFew filmmakers have ever been as invisible or prolific as Raúl Ruiz (1941-2011). Opening Friday, Lincoln Center’s three-week Ruiz retrospective, the first in New York since 1989, offers but a fraction of his oeuvre. Ruiz was more devoted to process than product. Having made more than 100 features, he seems less an auteur than an autonomous region, the creator of imaginary worlds, and worlds within worlds.\n\nIn the preface to his two-volume manifesto, “Poetics of Cinema,” Ruiz described the cinema as “an instrument of speculation and reflection” and “a machine for travel through space and time.” Appropriately, the retrospective, titled “Life Is a Dream” after a significant Ruiz movie it doesn’t include, opens with “Time Regained” (1999), Ruiz’s splendidly eccentric adaptation of the final volume of Marcel Proust’s novel “Remembrance of Things Past.”\n\nThe closest Ruiz came to an American art-house hit, “Time Regained” is a golden reverie on a passing age — that of the motion picture. Born in Chile, Ruiz, who left his native land after the 1973 military coup that toppled Salvador Allende, spent most of his adult life in France, although it could be said that he lived in the universe of cinema.\n\nExile was Ruiz’s natural state, said Richard Peña, former director of the New York Film Festival: “He loved being the perpetual outsider.” Asked to locate him in film history, Mr. Peña added that Ruiz — who alienated many of his displaced countrymen with “Dialogues of the Exiled” (1975), a parodic documentary — never fit into the context of Latin American cinema. Nor did he feel entirely comfortable as a European, Mr. Peña said: “He hated to see Raúl spelled French-style with an O.”\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
