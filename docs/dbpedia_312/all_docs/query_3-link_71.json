        "text": "Sailing is a sport that has been practiced for thousands of years, but for most of that time, it has been a male-dominated field. However, in the modern era, female sailors have made significant strides and contributions to the sport. Many have shattered barriers and set new records, proving that sailing is not just a man’s game.\n\nIn this article, we will be looking at the top 10 female sailors in history. These women have left an indelible mark on the sport of sailing, and their accomplishments have inspired countless others to follow in their wake.\n\nThe World’s Most Famous Female Sailors\n\nKrystyna Chojnowska-Liskiewicz\n\nKrystyna Chojnowska-Liskiewicz, born on July 15, 1936, in Poland, achieved the remarkable feat of becoming the first woman to sail solo around the world. Dubbed the “First Lady of the Oceans,” she embarked on her journey from the Canary Islands on March 28, 1976, and returned on April 21, 1978, covering a total distance of 31,166 nautical miles (57,719 km) during her 401-day circumnavigation. Her achievement narrowly beat that of New Zealander Naomi James, who completed her own solo circumnavigation on June 8, 1978.\n\nKay Cottee\n\nKay Cottee, who was awarded the Order of Australia, made history in 1988 by becoming the first woman to successfully complete a solo, non-stop, unassisted circumnavigation of the globe. Using her 11-meter yacht Blackmores First Lady, Cottee accomplished this feat in an astonishing 189 days. During her solo journey, she faced numerous challenges, including being washed overboard when her yacht capsized in 20-foot waves. Despite these obstacles, she managed to complete the task on her own, without stopping or receiving any assistance.\n\nLaura Dekker\n\nLaura Dekker, a New Zealand-born Dutch sailor, was born on September 20, 1995. At just 13 years of age, she announced her intention to become the youngest person to sail solo around the world. However, local authorities initially objected, and a Dutch court prevented her from departing while under shared custody of both parents. It was not until July 2010 that a Dutch family court ended the custody arrangement, allowing Laura to finally embark on her record-breaking attempt on August 21, 2010. She completed the solo circumnavigation aboard a 12.4-meter (40 ft) two-masted ketch named Guppy, arriving in Simpson Bay, Sint Maarten, 518 days later at the age of 16.\n\nNaomi James\n\nDame Naomi Christine James, born on March 2, 1949, in New Zealand, achieved two major milestones in solo sailing. She became the first woman to sail single-handed around the world via Cape Horn, and the second woman to complete a solo circumnavigation after Krystyna Chojnowska-Liskiewicz. James embarked on her journey from Dartmouth, Devon on September 9, 1977, and completed the trip in 272 days, arriving back on June 8, 1978. Her accomplishment improved upon Sir Francis Chichester’s solo round-the-world sailing record by two days.\n\nEllen MacArthur\n\nDame Ellen MacArthur, a now-retired English sailor, was born on July 8, 1976. She made history by breaking the world record for the fastest solo circumnavigation of the globe, completing the 27,354 nautical mile journey in just 71 days, 14 hours, 18 minutes, and 33 seconds. This feat surpassed the previous record by one day, eight hours, 35 minutes, and 49 seconds. However, the record was later reclaimed by Francis Joyon, a male French sailor who surpassed MacArthur’s time in early 2008.\n\nGalia Moss\n\nGalia Moss, born in Mexico, made history in 2006 by becoming the first Latin American woman to sail solo across the Atlantic Ocean. Her journey took just 41 days, earning her a spot in the Guinness Book of World Records. The attempt was also a charitable endeavor, as Moss collaborated with an NGO to donate a home to a Mexican family for every eight nautical miles she navigated. In total, she donated 644 homes, making her accomplishment even more remarkable.\n\nGrace O’Malley\n\nBorn in Ireland around 1530, Grace O’ Malley is considered one of the best female sailors in the World ever. Despite having a brother, upon the death of her father, Eoghan Dubhdara, it was Grace who took overactive leadership of the “Ó Máille” lordship by land and sea to protect the west Ireland region from the growing threat of the English crown. Her extraordinary career earned her the nickname, “The Pirate Queen”. She was better than most of his male counterparts at her prime and is considered the greatest female ‘pirate’ of the world ever.\n\nShirley Robertson\n\nShirley Ann Robertson, a British sailor born on July 15, 1968, is an Olympic gold medalist. She made history by becoming the first British woman to win two Olympic gold medals in consecutive games, Sydney 2000 and Athens 2004. In 2000, she was named female World Sailor of the Year by the International Sailing Federation. Robertson is also a trailblazer in the superyacht circuit, being the only woman to take the helm of the stunning 45-meter Salperton in three regattas in the Caribbean and Sardina.\n\nJeanne Socrates\n\nCircumnavigating the world alone is already a difficult task but imagine doing it at 70 years old! Jeanne Socrates, a British yachtswoman born on August 17, 1942, became the oldest woman to accomplish this feat in 2013. Her record still stands today. Socrates is also the only woman to have circumnavigated solo nonstop from North America. Her 259-day journey at sea earned her the prestigious Cruising Club of America’s Blue Water Medal and the Royal Cruising Club Medal for Seamanship.\n\nSkipper Thuridur\n\nThuridur, born in 1777, was one of the earliest female sailors in the world. At the age of just 11, she joined her father’s fishing crew and quickly became an efficient sailor, with exceptional skills in rowing and steering heavy wooden boats. Thuridur’s ability to navigate in all sea conditions made her one of the most successful fishing captains, never losing a crew member for many years. She is considered a remarkable figure in Icelandic maritime history and passed away at the age of 86.\n\nVisit Grays Harbor to Learn More About the Sea’s History\n\nIf you love learning about maritime history and want to know more, we encourage you to check out the other valuable information we offer!
