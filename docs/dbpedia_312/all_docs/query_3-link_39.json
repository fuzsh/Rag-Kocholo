        "text": "Love Christian historical fiction for teens? You’ll love this retelling of Sinbad the Sailor for Christian teens! When we studied the Middle Ages last year, our boys read the story of Sinbad the Sailor in One Thousand and One Arabian Nights (we used this adaptation from Geraldine McCaughrean). Sinbad the Sailor takes seven fantastic journeys, much like journeys Odysseus takes in the Odyssey.\n\nSinbad the Sailor\n\nThe story of Sinbad is an Arabic folk tale, written perhaps as early as 1637. Throughout the course of his amazing journeys, Sinbad experiences a series of tough situations, encountering monsters, demons, royalty, and magical lands. Though he speaks of Allah and gives alms to the poor, Sinbad enjoys a life of luxury, doing as he wills.\n\nHistorical Fiction for Teens\n\nAuthor Robert Rogland has written a delightful eighth journey for Sinbad in his 208-page novel for teens, The Crescent and the Cross: The Eighth Voyage of Sinbad (Saluda Press, 2015).\n\nIn the novel, Sinbad begins to question his salvation as a faithful Muslim. Is he really doing enough? Since his salvation can not be assured as a Muslim, are there more good works he can engage in? Sinbad decides to complete a Hajj–a pilgrimage to Mecca. It will check off one of the religious requirements of all able Muslims, and as an added bonus, he will be able to take another journey.\n\nBefore setting off on his Hajj, Sinbad must replace his runaway slave. He purchases a strong teen at the market and they set off. Little does Sinbad know that his new Ethiopian slave Selassie is a Christian.\n\nPurchase The Crescent and the Cross\n\nI’d like to thank Saluda Press for providing me with a copy of The Crescent and the Cross in return for my honest opinion.\n\nChristianity vs. Islam\n\nThe Crescent and the Cross is a fabulous tale of a series of misadventures. There’s mutiny, shipwreck, an underwater kingdom, murderous pagan priests, a poisoned princess, mystical berries guarded by apes, and palace intrigue. I read the book in two days (only because my children expected food and company–I could easily have been entertained enough to read straight through).\n\nSelassie, the Ethiopian slave, is a marvelous young man who relies on his strength in God as he travels with Sinbad through challenge after trial.\n\nRobert Rogland skillfully uses his adventure to compare and contrast the futility of Islam with the hope Christians find in Christ. Throughout the book, Sinbad is confronted with his own desire and inability to be good, his fear of eternal condemnation, and his desire to learn more about the Jesus that Selassie professes to know personally.\n\nValuable Teaching Fiction\n\nThere are many who feel Christian fiction for kids and teens should stray far from morals and lessons. This is, perhaps, because many of the Christian fiction books of the past hammered home their points carelessly, with no regard for the enjoyment or experience of the reader.\n\nI think it’s fair to assert that every author has a point. Every writer sits down to the keyboard with a message and a worldview in mind. As a parent, it’s a gift to find literature for my kids that conveys truth through storytelling. Story is a powerful medium, and it’s a vehicle that shouldn’t be ignored when we teach.\n\nIn The Cross and the Crescent, Robert Rogland has done a masterful job of sharing truth while weaving a hair-raising and fantastical tale. This is a book no Christian kid should miss. It’s appropriate for teens, but would be a wonderful family read aloud as well. Your children will learn the difference between the basic tenets of Islam and Christianity. They’ll hear the gospel. And they’ll read an adventurous story the may never forget.\n\nBible Resources for Your Kids\n\nLearn More HereLearn More HereLearn More HereLearn More HereLearn More HereLearn More Here\n\nMartin Luther and the Reformation\n\nTeach your teens about Martin Luther and the Reformation in an exciting, new way with When Lightning Struck!: The Story of Martin Luther!\n\nMartin Luther (1483-1546) is often referred to as “The Father of the Reformation”. Born during a time of superstition, tradition, and spiritual corruption, Luther gave up a lucrative career as a lawyer to become a monk in the Roman Catholic Church–a path he felt would certainly lead to salvation.\n\nAs Luther’s understanding of the spiritual corruption within the Church grew, and he despaired of true salvation, Luther (now a scholar and priest) sought the Bible for answers. Following his discovery of the true gospel in Scripture, Luther began to preach spiritual freedom to his congregation, and to teach biblical (rather than philosophical) theology at the University of Wittenberg.\n\nIt was on October 31, 1517 that Martin Luther penned his Ninety-Five Theses in Latin in response to the abusive indulgence sales practices of the monk Johann Tetzel in a nearby town. Luther nailed the Theses to the door of the Wittenberg Castle Church, the scholarly bulletin board of his day, and mailed a copy to the Archbishop of Mainz. Luther hoped to start a scholarly debate about the practice of selling salvation through plenary indulgences. The response he received was greater–and more dangerous–than he imagined it would be.\n\nLuther’s story is exciting. There are death defying moments, epic spiritual battles, narrow escapes, a kidnapping, revolution, and war. As the “Father of the Reformation”, Luther is a vital figure in Church history. His sacrifice and willingness to wage battle against the spiritual, religious, and political powers of his medieval world allowed Christians throughout time to embrace the truth of salvation by grace alone through faith alone in Christ alone as explained by Scripture alone once again. May all glory be to God alone!\n\nRead portions of the first eight chapters of When Lightning Struck!:\n\nYour kids will love the Who What Why Reformation series with illustrated narratives for 8-11 year olds. And, Martin Luther’s young adult historical fiction story makes the perfect family read aloud!\n\nGrab the autographed Reformation Family Bundle!\n\nBooks Make Great Gifts!\n\nMore Thinking Kids Posts You’ll Love!"
