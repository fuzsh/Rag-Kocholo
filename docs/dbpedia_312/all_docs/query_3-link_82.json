        "text": "I've been a fan of Sailor Moon since I watched it on USA channel before going to school. An aspect of it that captured my imagination, but that was underexplored in the series, was that in the past every planet in the solar system had people living on it. In this respect, Sailor Moon is something of a post-apocalyptic story. From a galaxy with crystal palaces on every planet from Mercury to Pluto, down to modern day Earth. Are there any works of fantasy literature that explore the idea of people being spread on all the planets in the galaxy? Scifi has plenty of that, but I want to see it approached through a lens of magic and wonder, rather than technology. I would prefer if it was our galaxy, but it doesn't have to be. I know this is a strange request, but after my last request here (which gave me lots of great reading material) I am highly optimistic that r/fantasy knows some good books. Not to nitpick, but I really want planets and not different planes like the Riftwar Cycle (a fine work in itself, just not what I'm looking for).\n\nThank you in advance for the excellent recommendations.\n\nEdit: Thanks for all the recommendations! I appreciate them all and have a lot of books on my reading list now."
