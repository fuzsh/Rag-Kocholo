        "text": "Fiction – paperback; Faber & Faber; 207 pages; 2023. Review copy via NetGalley.\n\nVoice is so important to me in deciding whether I like a book or not. I’m less fussy about structure, plot and even characterisation because the authorial voice can often carry those. It’s the author’s writing style I’m most keenly interested in. It needs to have personality, it needs to “grab” me, say something new and make me want to keep turning the pages.\n\nSoldier Sailor, the new novel by Irish writer Claire Kilroy, is all about voice. And what a voice it is!\n\nIt’s urgent, powerful and almost dizzying in its ability to disorientate the reader. Sometimes it’s hard to determine if the narrator is sane or maybe just has a vivid imagination. Is she reliable? Or is she just venting?\n\nA mother’s story\n\nThe story, which is told in the second person, is framed around a mother addressing her four-year-old son, Sailor, hence the title. (The mother is the soldier, in the sense that she is “soldiering on”.)\n\nThe day you were born a door appeared – or was revealed, really, having been there all along – the door out of life, the door when it’s over, you’re done, thank you: next, and I have to go through it first.\n\nSoldier Sailor is about motherhood and the loss of self (or identity) when a woman has a baby and sheds her old life to become a parent. Kilroy exposes the intensity and bittersweet emotions this can generate.\n\nHer narrator is confused, furious, upset, loving and tender — often all at the same time — as she rails against the all-consuming nature of her new role.\n\nI miss my old life like I’d miss a lover. I pine for it, I daydream about leaving you so that we can be together again. You’d like to diagnose postnatal depression because then it’s not your fault.\n\nDifferent standards\n\nThroughout, there’s a strong focus on double standards and the ways in which the narrator feels crushed by the inequality she experiences as everything in her life changes while her husband’s life continues along as per normal.\n\nThere’s no interruption to his career, he doesn’t have to breastfeed, he chooses to ignore the crying and the nappy changing and he works late to avoid coming home to a stressed-out mother and baby.\n\nI sat on the couch. ‘How was your day?’ I asked him and he embarked on tales of valour and derring-do from a distant galaxy. Things he had said, problems he had solved, names, many names, people I would never meet. It was too tiring to try to imagine them. ‘You’re not listening.’ I opened my eyes. May or may not have been asleep. ‘Sorry. How was your day?’ ‘I just told you.’ ‘Oh. You did. Sorry.’ ‘How was your day?’ ‘My day?’ I wondered, drawing a blank. Nothing recorded. Vegetative state. ‘Em,’ I said, ‘long.’\n\nThe growing resentment between the couple builds and builds, but the narrator is conscious that she has had to prioritise her newborn’s needs over her husband’s, describing it as a “brutal but necessary displacement”.\n\nBecause of the story’s structure, we never hear the husband’s point of view, but he comes across (via the protagonist’s biased and anger-fuelled perspective) as unsympathetic, selfish and pig-headed. And on the rare occasions when he does try to help, he does it “wrong”, is berated by his wife and so stops offering to help. It’s a vicious cycle.\n\nBut Kilroy also plays with stereotypes by introducing into the storyline a stay-at-home dad — an old school friend our narrator bumps into in the local playground. He is raising three young children while his wife, a successful doctor, is the breadwinner.\n\nOur harried mother finds solace in their friendship for here is another parent, struggling with domestic life and lonely for adult company, with whom she can unburden herself and share her doubts and fears.\n\nThe dark side\n\nWhile Soldier Sailor traverses some dark and dangerous territory, there’s a rich vein of black humour to cut through the suspense that builds from the first page.\n\nI always knew that, as the mother, I would get the blame for everything. If you grow up to be a serial killer, if you stash decapitated heads in your fridge like half-eaten turnips, they will say it was the mother’s fault.\n\nI ate up this book in two greedy gulps because I simply had to find out what would happen next.\n\nKilroy achieves this sense of urgency by tapping into our darkest fears and using the “rules” of the best psychological thrillers to get us invested in the people she writes about. I feared for both the mother and the child, worried some terrible fate was going to befall at least one of them, and by the time I got to the end I felt emotionally wrung out. It’s a brilliantly intense read.\n\nSoldier Sailor is the author’s first novel in more than a decade — it was certainly worth the wait.\n\nI have previously read and reviewed Kilroy’s earlier work, which includes Tenderwire, a nailbiting thriller about an Irish violinist, which is set in New York; All Name Have Been Changed, a slow-moving satire that sends up the literary world of Dublin in the 1980s; and The Devil I Know, a black comedy about the collapse of the Celtic Tiger."
