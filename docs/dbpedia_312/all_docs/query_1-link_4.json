The sailor drunkenly recounts his macabre life on board and his adventures in exotic ports and brothels.\n\nTall tales are exhumed from the drunken fog of memory in this hallucinatory maritime adventure in storytelling from Ra√∫l Ruiz. The fractured narrative design and dazzling, poetic visuals lend the destabilizing sense of being at sea, albeit in a vessel clearly being steered by a cinematic master."
