        "text": "Identification method of public houses\n\nPub names are used to identify and differentiate traditional drinking establishments. Many pubs are centuries old, and were named at a time when most of their customers were illiterate, but could recognise pub signs. The use of signage was not confined to drinking establishments. British pubs may be named after and depict anything from everyday (particularly agricultural) objects, to sovereigns, aristocrats and landowners (shown by their coats of arms). Other names come from historic events, livery companies, occupations, sports, and craftsmen's guilds. One of the most common pub names is the Red Lion. This list contains both modern and historical examples.\n\nAlthough the word \"the\" appears on much pub signage, it is ignored in the following examples; the word \"ye' is likewise ignored as it is only an archaic spelling of \"the\". \"Y\" represents an obsolete character (Ã¾, the letter Thorn, which is nowadays used only in Icelandic) for the th sound. Its later forms resembled a blackletter y, and it was never pronounced with a y sound.[1] Similarly, other archaic spellings such as \"olde worlde\" are not distinguished below.\n\nNames like Fox and Hounds, Dog and Duck, Dog and Gun, Hare and Hounds, etc., refer to shooting and hunting.[2][3] Animal names coupled with colours, such as White Hart and Red Lion, are often heraldic. A white hart featured as a badge of King Richard II, while a red lion was a badge of John of Gaunt and the Dukes of Bedford amongst others and a blue boar of the Earls of Oxford.[4] Exceptions do exist, however, along with less obvious examples of the form - a combination of both features being Cross Foxes (a name most commonly found in rural Wales), referring to a darker-furred breed of the common Red Fox whose pelts were considered more valuable and sometimes worn as a sign of status.\n\nBald Faced Stag Inn, Finchley. An inn notorious as frequented by murderers in the past.[5]\n\nBarking Dogs, Hoxton (closed). (Also, various Barking Dog pubs.) Named after the canine burglar deterrents.[6]\n\nBear Inn, Reading.[7]\n\nBlack Bear, Walsoken : actually, had a black bear (stuffed) at the entrance to the premises years ago.[8]\n\nBlack Birds, Barnwell, Cambridgeshire. Named after the bird.[9]\n\nBlack Horse, Chester-le-Street : some may be named in memory of a black horse ridden by Dick Turpin, however many including this one predate the event.[10]\n\nBull Inn, Stamford : the town was the last in England to practice bull-running.[11]\n\nBustard Inn, South Rauceby (closed). After the bird of that name, once numerous.[12]\n\nChameleon, Wisbech (now closed).[13]\n\nCrane, Cambridge. After the bird of that name, once numerous in The Fens. Crane is one of the nicknames for the inhabitants.[14]\n\nDog, Westhall, Suffolk.[15]\n\nDolphin, Wisbech, Isle of Ely (now closed) : dolphins were caught and presented to the lord of the manor in earlier times; however, it may just be a nautical reference to the port, or a corruption of \"Dauphin\" in honour of military victories over Napoleon in France (see later section).[3]\n\nDove, Ipswich : a biblical source.[16]\n\nFour Swans, Butchers Market, Cambridge (closed down).[17]\n\nHeathcock Tavern, Strand : named after a game bird.[18]\n\nLobster, Sheringham. Patronised by the lifeboat crew who formed the Shanty Men.[19]\n\nOld Ram, Tivetshall St. Mary.[20]\n\nOlde Fighting Cocks, St. Albans. Named after the cocks used in fights and for gambling.[21]\n\nOstrich Inn, Castle Acre. Named after the flightless bird.[22]\n\nPackhorse and Pig, Aldergate Street, London [23]\n\nPickerel Inn, Cambridge : named after young pike (Esox lucius).[24]\n\nPy'd Bull, Lincoln (closed). This pub was advertised as convenient for drovers in the 18th century.[25] The Pied Bull in Chester in reputed to be the oldest licensed house in the city and dates back to 1155.[26]\n\nPyewipe Inn, Lincoln. Pyewipe is the Lincolnshire dialect name for the lapwing.[27][28]\n\nRed-Hart Inn, Petty Cury, Cambridge (closed). Claimed to have the only cockpit in the town.[29]\n\nRein Deer, Lincoln (closed).[30]\n\nRoebuck Inn, Chesterton. Named after the male of the species Capreolus capreolus.[31]\n\nString of Horses, Spalding (closed).[32]\n\nSwan and Falcon Inn, Gloucester (closed).[33]\n\nUgly Bug, Colton.[34]\n\nSome pub chains in the UK adopt the same or similar names for many pubs as a means of brand expression. Examples include \"The Moon Under Water\", commonly used by the JD Wetherspoon chain (and inspired by George Orwell's 1946 essay in the Evening Standard, \"The Moon Under Water\"), and the \"Tap and Spile\" brand name used by the now defunct Century Inns chain.[35][36] The \"Slug and Lettuce\" is another example of a chain of food-based pubs with a prominent brand; founder Hugh Corbett had owned a small number of pubs, to which he gave humorous or nonsensical names, with the effect of differentiating them from competitors.[37]\n\nBefore painted inn signs became commonplace, medieval publicans often identified their establishments by hanging or standing a distinctive object outside the pub. A fictional example of this otherwise real-life practice can be found in Terry Pratchett's Discworld series of books, where the pub in Ankh Morpork starts off as The Drum, becomes The Broken Drum after a bar fight damages it and then in later books The Mended Drum. This tradition dates back to Roman times, when vine leaves were hung outside tabernae to show where wine was sold.[38]\n\nBoot Inn, Whittlesea [39]\n\nBoot and Slipper, Amersham.[40]\n\nCrooked Billet, Portsmouth St, London (a bent branch from a tree)[41]\n\nHorne Inn, Wisbech. A former 15th century Inn. [42]\n\nSometimes the object was coloured, such as Blue Post or Blue Door.[43]\n\nMany pubs have heraldic names.\n\nBlue Boar, the name of many pubs in Westminster, Norwich, Billericay, Maldon, Witney and elsewhere, from the badge of the Earls of Oxford.[4]\n\nCastle: sometimes originally referred to the Coat of Arms of Castile in Spain, and meant that Spanish wines were available within.[44]\n\nCheckers or Chequer(s), March, Isle of Ely and many other sites : sometimes derived from the coat of arms of a local landowner (see Chequy), this name and sign originated in ancient Rome when a chequer board indicated that a bar also provided banking services. The checked board was used as an aid to counting and is the origin of the word exchequer. The last pub to use the older, now American spelling of checker was in Baldock, Hertfordshire, but this closed circa 1990; all pubs now use the modern \"q\" spelling (but see also Chequers, in Plants and horticulture below).[45]\n\nCross Keys, Wisbech, derived from the town's coat of arms and the town's church of SS. Peter & Paul.[3]\n\nEagle and Child, Oxford, derived from the arms of the Earls of Derby, was a meeting place of the Inklings.\n\nRampant Horse (earlier Ramping Horse), Norwich : horses are popular pub signs and names.[46]\n\nRed Lion is the name of over 600 pubs. It thus can stand for an archetypal British pub. The lion is one of the most common charges in coats of arms, second only to the cross, and thus the Red Lion as a pub sign probably has multiple origins: in the arms or crest of a local landowner, now perhaps forgotten; as a personal badge of John of Gaunt, founder of the House of Lancaster; or in the royal arms of Scotland, conjoined to the arms of England after the Stuart succession in 1603.[47][4]\n\nSpread Eagle: from the heraldic depiction of an eagle 'displayed'; probably derived from the arms of Germany, indicating that German wines were available within.[44]\n\nSwan, Wisbech a badge of many Lancastrian figuresâsee Dunstable Swan Jewel[3]\n\nTalbot or Talbot Arms refers to an actual breed of hunting dog, now extinct, which is also a heraldic hound, and is the badge of the Talbot family, Earls of Shrewsbury. Old Talbot, Wisbech (now closed)[3]\n\nWhite Hart: the livery badge of King Richard II of England. It became so popular as an inn sign in his reign that it was adopted by many later inns and taverns.[4]\n\nNames starting with the word \"Three\" are often based on the arms of a London Livery company or trade guild :\n\nThree Arrows: The Worshipful Company of Bowyers\n\nThree Bucks: The Worshipful Company of Leathersellers\n\nThree Castles: The Worshipful Company of Masons\n\nThree Compasses: The Worshipful Company of Carpenters[48]\n\nThree Crowns: The Worshipful Company of Drapers, although it can also refer to the Magi, the Diocese of Ely or the three crowns of East Anglia.[49]\n\nThree Cups: The Worshipful Company of Salters\n\nThree Fishes: The Worshipful Company of Fishmongers\n\nThree Goats' Heads: The Worshipful Company of Cordwainers\n\nThree Hammers: The Worshipful Company of Blacksmiths\n\nThree Horseshoes: The Worshipful Company of Farriers\n\nThree Tuns: The Brewers and the Worshipful Company of Vintners[3]\n\nThree Wheatsheafs: The Worshipful Company of Bakers\n\nMany landowners' coats of arms appear as pub signs.\n\nDuke of Bedford, Wisbech, Isle of Ely: (now closed) named for the person draining the fens.[3]\n\nHardwicke Arms, Wisbech (now closed Down) - the Earl of Hardwicke KG MP being Lord Lieutenant and Custos Rotulorum.[3]\n\nOsborne, Wisbech, Isle of Ely: (now closed) named for the residence of a local family.[3]\n\nPrince Albert, Wisbech, Isle of Ely: (now closed) named for the prince consort.[3]\n\nQueen Victoria, Wisbech, Isle of Ely : named for the monarch.[3]\n\nRoyal Standard, Wisbech, Isle of Ely : the monarch's personal flag.[3]\n\nStanley Arms, Huyton, near Liverpool: after Frederick Stanley, 16th Earl of Derby.\n\nMarshland Arms, Wisbech, Isle of Ely: (now closed) named for a nearby council.[3]\n\nMelbourne Arms, Duston, Northampton: after former local landowner Lord Melbourne\n\nTollemache, Grantham : named after Frederick Tollemache\n\nWisbech Arms, Wisbech: (now closed) named for the local borough.[3]\n\nSee also Trades, tools and products below\n\nSome \"Arms\" signs refer to working occupations. These may show people undertaking such work or the arms of the appropriate London livery company. This class of name may be only just a name but there are stories behind some of them. An \"arms\" name, too, can derive from a local authority.\n\nBlacksmiths Arms, various pubs with the pun of the actual blacksmiths arms and their strength.[3]\n\nBrewers Arms, Wisbech. The town had and has several breweries.[3]\n\nCarpenters Arms - A series of pubs, related to the occupation or more likely to the guild of carpenters.[2]\n\nCooper's Arms, Little Old Bailey - Worshipful Company of Coopers.[50][51]\n\nDrover's Inn, Loch Lomond, Scotland.

At least two rope walks in the town.[3]\n\nShip Carpenters' Arms, Wisbech named for local shipbuilders trades.[3]\n\nShipwrights' Arms, Wisbech named for the men employed in the local shipbuilders.[3]\n\nSpinners' Arms, Hindley Green, Wigan.[63]\n\nWire Workers' Arms, St. Neots, Hunts.[64]\n\nAbdication, in Arnold : the reign and abdication of Edward VIII.[65]\n\nBhurtpore Inn, Aston, near Nantwich, Cheshire: commemorating the Siege of Bharatpur in Rajasthan, 1826.[66] The Inn is on land formerly part of the estates of Lord Combermere, commander of British forces during the siege.\n\nDolphin: often anglicised from the French Dauphin, commemorating battles in which England defeated France. These include \"The Dolphin\" in Wellington, Somerset which was named in honour of Wellington's victory at the Battle of Waterloo.[67]\n\nSee also: Dolphin Inn, Plymouth and Dolphin Inn, Bournemouth\n\nThe village of Nash near Newport has a Waterloo Inn that is owned by the parish.[68]\n\nHand and Shears: this famous City of London pub got its name owing to Bartholomew Fair.

The dynastic conflicts between their descendants are collectively called the Wars of the Roses. In 1485 Henry Tudor, a descendant of Lancaster, defeated Richard III of the York dynasty and married Richard's niece Elizabeth of York. Since then, the combined red-and-white Tudor rose, often crowned, has been a symbol of the monarchy of England.\n\nRoyal Oak: After the Battle of Worcester (1651) in the English Civil War, the defeated Prince Charles escaped the scene with the Roundheads on his tail. He managed to reach Bishops Wood in Staffordshire, where he found an oak tree (now known as the Boscobel Oak near Boscobel House). He climbed the tree and hid in it for a day while his obviously short-sighted pursuers strolled around under the tree looking for him. The hunters gave up, Prince Charles came down and escaped to France (the Escape of Charles II). He became Charles II on the Restoration of the Monarchy. To celebrate this good fortune, 29 May (Charles' birthday) was declared Royal Oak Day and the pub name remembers this. The Royal Naval ship HMS Royal Oak gets its name from the same source. Early ships were built of the heartwood of oak.[citation needed]\n\nSaracen's Head and Turk's Head: Saracens and Turks were among the enemies faced by Crusaders. This is also a reference to the Barbary pirates that raided the coasts from the Crusades until the early 19th century.[citation needed]\n\nTrafalgar: commemorating the Battle of Trafalgar. There are many pubs called the Nelson, and an Emma Hamilton pub in Wimbledon Chase where Nelson lived with her. A famous pub is the Trafalgar Tavern, part of the Greenwich Maritime World Heritage site at Greenwich.[citation needed]\n\nCat and Custard Pot in Shipton Moyne is said to originate from the book Handley Cross; or, Mr. Jorrock's hunt (1892) by R.

R. R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings. Here Gaffer Gamgee recounted to the other regulars his stories about Bilbo and Frodo Baggins, who were about to throw a magnificent joint birthday party.[86] The most likely real-world source is an Edgbaston pub called the Ivy Bush, near where Tolkien lived when he was growing up in Birmingham.[87][88]\n\nThe Fortune of War, Smithfield was located on \"Pie Corner\" (where the Great Fire of London stopped) and was frequented by Resurrectionists including the London Burkers, two of whom, John Bishop and Thomas Williams, were hanged for murder after they sold the bodies for dissection. The pub is mentioned in William Makepeace Thackeray's 1848 Vanity Fair.[89]\n\nImages from myths and legends are evocative and memorable.\n\nBlack Bess: usually named after the legendary overnight ride from London to York in 1737 by Dick Turpin on his Mare of this name.

This sign is a symbol of English nationalism.\n\nGreen Dragon, Wisbech, Wymondham etc.: a couple of a number of pubs of this name.[91]\n\nGreen Man: a spirit of the wild woods.[92] The original images are in churches as a face peering through or made of leaves and petals; this character is the Will of the Wisp, the Jack of the Green. Some pub signs will show the green man as he appears in English traditional sword dances (in green hats). The Green Man is not the same character as Robin Hood, although the two may be linked. Some pubs which were the Green Man have become the Robin Hood; there are no pubs in Robin's own county of Nottinghamshire named the Green Man but there are Robin Hoods. The 1973 film The Wicker Man features a Green Man pub.\n\nHob in the Well, King's Lynn: pubs of this name can come from Hobgoblin in the well or Dogget's play Flora: or, Hob in the Well (1748).[93][94]\n\nThe Lamb and Nettle : this mythical 'out of hours' premises was located in Scrimshires Passage, Wisbech. It also featured in The Phantom Pub, a poem by Geoff Hastings.[95]\n\nMoonrakers: In the 17th century, some Wiltshire yokels hid their smuggled liquor in the Crammer (a pond in Devizes) and used rakes to recover their stash. They were caught in the act by customs officials, and they claimed they were trying to rake in a cheese, which was in fact the reflection of the full moon. The customs officials left thinking that the locals were a bit simple, whilst the locals recovered the smuggled goods without any more interference. The name Moonrakers has been used as a nickname for Wiltshire folk ever since and is the name of pubs in Devizes and Swindon.[citation needed]\n\nRobin Hood, sometimes partnered by his second in charge to form the name Robin Hood and Little John. Other Robin Hood names can be found throughout Arnold, Nottinghamshire. These were given to pubs built in the new estates of the 1960s by the Home Brewery of Daybrook, Nottinghamshire: Arrow, Friar Tuck, Longbow, Maid Marian and Major Oak.\n\nSilent Woman, Quiet Lady or Headless Woman: The origin is uncertain, with various local stories, such as a landlady whose tongue was cut out by smugglers so she couldn't talk to the authorities,[96] or a saint beheaded for her Christianity.[97] The pub signs sometimes have an image of a decapitated woman or the couplet: \"Here is a woman who has lost her head / She's quiet nowâyou see she's dead\".[97]\n\nCommon enough today, the pairing of words in the name of an inn or tavern was rare before the mid-17th century, but by 1708 had become frequent enough for a pamphlet to complain of 'the variety and contradictory language of the signs', citing absurdities such as 'Bull and Mouth', 'Whale and Cow', and 'Shovel and Boot'. Two years later an essay in the Spectator echoed this complaint, deriding among others such contemporary paired names as 'Bell and Neat's Tongue', though accepting 'Cat and Fiddle'. A possible explanation for doubling of names is the combining of businesses, for example when a landlord of one pub moved to another premises. Fashion, as in the rise of intentionally amusing paired names like 'Slug and Lettuce' and 'Frog and Firkin' (see Puns, Jokes and Corruptions below) in the late 20th century, is responsible for many more recent pub names.[98]\n\nBlack Boy and Trumpet, Peterborough (now closed).[99]\n\nBoot and Shoe in March, Isle of Ely[100]\n\nButcher and Beast, Heighington : claims to be the only one of this name in England.[101]\n\nGeorge and Vulture Tavern.

Named for Taxus baccata the English Yew.[134]\n\nAll Labour In Vain or Labour In Vain. At various locations. Probably of Biblical origins, in past times the name was often illustrated by a person trying to scrub the blackness off a black child. Such signs have been mostly replaced with more innocuous depictions of wasted effort.[135]\n\nThere are numerous old pubs and inns in England with the name of the Black Boy(s), many now claimed to refer either to child chimneysweeps or coal miners, or to a (genuine) historic description of King Charles II. The Black Boy Inn in Caernarfon, North Wales, has received at least a dozen complaints from visitors over the name, which dates back at least 250 years.[136] In 2021 brewer Greene King changed the names of three pubs called The Black Boy, and another called The Black's Head.[137]\n\nThe Black Bitch, a pub in Linlithgow, West Lothian, is named after the local legend of a black greyhound who is said to have repeatedly swum to an island in the town's loch to bring food to its imprisoned master, only to suffer the same fate when its efforts were discovered.

Supposed corruptions of foreign phrases usually have much simpler explanations. Many old names for pubs that appear nonsensical are often alleged to have come from corruptions of slogans or phrases, such as \"The Bag o'Nails\" (Bacchanals), \"The Cat and the Fiddle\" (Caton Fidele) and \"The Bull and Bush\", which purportedly celebrates the victory of Henry VIII at \"Boulogne Bouche\" or Boulogne-sur-Mer Harbour.[163][164]\n\nAxe and Gate: Possibly from \"ax (or ask) and get\".[165]\n\nBeartown Tap, Congleton, Cheshire. 'Beartown' is the nickname for Congleton, as local legend claims its townsfolk once 'sold the bible to buy the bear', that is, spent money set aside to buy a parish Bible on providing bear-baiting at their fair.[166]\n\nBird in-hand, Wisbech.

Also said to be a corruption of the Latin phrase Casa Alta ('high house') or Casa Altera ('second house'). There are several examples in England, such as at Hatton, Warwickshire[168] The Case is Altered (now closed) and a later new build pub 'The Case' also now closed both in Wisbech, Isle of Ely.[3]\n\nCat and Fiddle: a corruption of Caton le FidÃ¨le (meaning \"the faithful\"), a governor of Calais loyal to King Edward III.[169] Alternatively from Katherine la FidÃ¨le, Henry VIII's first wife.\n\nElephant and Castle: By folk etymology, a corruption of \"la Infanta de Castile\". It is popularly believed amongst residents of Elephant and Castle that a 17th-century publican near Newington named his tavern after the Spanish princess who was affianced to King Charles I of England. The prohibition of this marriage by Church authorities in 1623 was a cause of war with Spain so it seems unlikely to have been a popular name. A more probable and prosaic explanation is that the name derives from the arms of the Worshipful Company of Cutlers, a London trade guild; an elephant carrying a castle-shaped howdah can also be seen on the arms of the City of Coventry.[citation needed]\n\nGoat and Compass[es]: Possibly based on the arms of the Worshipful Company of Cordwainers, whose coat of arms contains three goats, together with the Worshipful Company of Carpenters, whose coat of arms contains three compasses.[170] (either that, or from \"God encompass us\")[165]\n\nParaffin Oil Shop (now closed), at the crossing of A5080 and B5179 in eastern Liverpool, Google Earth view: So, people could say that they are going to buy paraffin.[171]\n\nPig and Whistle: a corruption of the Anglo-Saxon saying piggin wassail meaning \"good health\".\n\nSwan With Two Necks: In England and Wales, wild mute swans swimming in open water have traditionally been the property of the reigning monarch, who had the right to grant swan marks. In the 16th century, Queen Elizabeth I granted the right to ownership of some swans to the Worshipful Company of Vintners. To tell which swan belonged to whom, the Vintners' swans' beaks would be marked with two notches, or nicks. The word 'nick' was mistaken for 'neck', and so the Vintners spotted that a Swan With Two Necks could afford them a rather clever pun, and a striking pub sign. When Swan Upping is carried out nowadays rings are used in lieu of nicking beaks.[172][173]\n\nThe amount of religious symbolism in pub names decreased after Henry VIII's break from the church of Rome. For instance, many pubs now called the King's Head were originally called the Pope's Head.\n\nAdam & Eve, Norwich.

The two surveys most often cited, both taken in 2007, are by the British Beer and Pub Association (BBPA) and the Campaign for Real Ale (CAMRA). As pubs have closed in response to changing habits, numbers have fallen, so the historic surveys remain of interest.\n\nAccording to BBPA in 2007, the most common names were:[236]\n\nRed Lion (759)\n\nRoyal Oak (626)\n\nWhite Hart (427)\n\nRose and Crown (326)\n\nKing's Head (310)\n\nKing's Arms (284)\n\nQueen's Head (278)\n\nThe Crown (261)\n\nAccording to CAMRA in 2007 they were at that time:[237]\n\nCrown (704)\n\nRed Lion (668)\n\nRoyal Oak (541)\n\nSwan (451)\n\nWhite Hart (431)\n\nRailway (420)\n\nPlough (413)\n\nWhite Horse (379)\n\nBell (378)[238][239]\n\nNew Inn (372)\n\nA more current listing can be found on the Pubs Galore site, updated daily as pubs open/close and change names.[240] In 2019, the top 10 were:\n\nRed Lion (558)\n\nCrown (509)\n\nRoyal Oak (432)\n\nWhite Hart (317)\n\nSwan (296)\n\nPlough (294)\n\nRailway (294)\n\nWhite Horse (286)\n\nKings Arms (245)\n\nShip (244)\n\nThe pubs with the shortest and longest names in Britain are both in Stalybridge: Q and The Old Thirteenth Cheshire Astley Volunteer Rifleman Corps Inn.[241] The longest name of a London pub, I am the Only Running Footman,[242] was used as the title of a mystery novel by Martha Grimes.[243]\n\nThere is a \"pub with no name\" in Southover Street, Brighton,[244] and another near to Petersfield, Hampshire, so known (despite having an actual name), because its sign on the nearest main road has been missing for many years.[245]\n\nThe Salley Pussey's Inn at Royal Wootton Bassett is said to have been named after Sarah Purse, whose family owned The Wheatsheaf pub in the 19th century. In the 1970s the name was changed to the Salley Pussey's.[246]\n\nList of pubs in Australia\n\nList of pubs in the United Kingdom\n\nBrewer, E. Cobham (1898) Dictionary of Phrase and Fable.
