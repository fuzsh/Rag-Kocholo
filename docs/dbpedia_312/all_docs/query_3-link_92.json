        "text": "Summary\n\nThe novel opens in 1815 as the Pharaon arrives in Marseille. The ship’s owner, Monsieur Morrel, learns from the young first mate, Edmond Dantès, that the captain died on the journey and that Dantès took over. The ship’s accountant, Danglars, is bothered that the Pharaon stopped at Elba, but Dantès explains that the captain left a package to be delivered to one of Napoleon’s marshals who is in exile with Napoleon on the island. Morrel makes Dantès captain of the ship, to Danglars’s displeasure. On visiting his father, Dantès learns that a neighbour, Gaspard Caderousse, took most of his father’s resources in payment of a debt. Dantès then goes to see his fiancée, Mercédès, and finds her in the company of Fernand Mondego, who is in love with her. After leaving, Mondego encounters Danglars and Caderousse, and a decision is made to falsely accuse Dantès of treason. In a letter to the crown prosecutor, Danglars alleges that Dantès is a Bonapartist and is carrying a letter from Napoleon to the Bonapartist committee in Paris.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nFamous Novels, First Lines Quiz\n\nDantès is arrested, but the assistant prosecutor, Gérard de Villefort, discovers that Dantès is not a Bonapartist agent and is prepared to release him. However, after learning that the young captain has a letter from Napoleon to de Villefort’s father, who is a Bonapartist, he sends Dantès to the Château d’If, an island prison where he remains for many years. One day another inmate, Abbé Faria, arrives in Dantès’s cell through a tunnel he has been digging in an attempt to escape. Faria deduces that Danglars and Mondego framed Dantès as well as why de Villefort keeps Dantès imprisoned. He spends a few years teaching Dantès, and they plan another escape attempt. Faria tells Dantès about a treasure hidden on the uninhabited island of Monte Cristo and then dies. Dantès sews himself inside Faria’s burial shroud and is flung into the sea. He frees himself and is rescued by a crew of smugglers. Later he finds the treasure on Monte Cristo.\n\nDantès then sets about gaining revenge for his long unjust imprisonment. He disguises himself as an Italian priest and visits Caderousse, who divulges that Danglars and Mondego are both wealthy and that the latter has married Mercédès. Upon hearing that Morrel has fallen on hard times, Dantès secretly solves his financial problems.\n\nTen years later, in Rome, Dantès, now calling himself the count of Monte Cristo, contrives to meet Albert, the son of Mondego (now the count of Morcerf) and Mercédès. Albert is unhappily engaged to Danglars’s daughter. Dantès subsequently buys a house in Auteuil, outside Paris. Later he tells Haydée, a Greek slave whom he has purchased, that she is now free but must keep the details of her birth a secret. After Dantès arranges for Danglars to lose his fortune, he hosts a dinner party for the Danglarses and the de Villeforts; Maximilian Morrel (the son of Monsieur Morrel) and two convicts hired to play wealthy Italians are also present. It is revealed that Mrs. Danglars was once the mistress of de Villefort and that the younger convict is the son born of that union, whom de Villefort thought he had disposed of as a baby."
