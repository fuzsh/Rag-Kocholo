        "text": "3.75/5 (Good)\n\nCity of the Chasch is the first book of the Tschai, Planet of Adventure series by the famous and well-esteemed sci-fi/fantasy master Jack Vance. Although the novel ultimately fails to break free from the predictable pattern of the princess, the monster (s), the quest (s), City of the Chasch thrives on Vance’s Continue reading →\n\n8.25/10 (Very Good)\n\nIf Jan Potocki’s fantastic 18th century novel A Manuscript Found in Saragossa — a frame story within a frame story within a frame story — was recited over the course of a wine filled evening by a drunken sailor the result might conjure something of the kaleidoscope of heavily tinted Continue reading →\n\n5/10 (Average — worth watching if you like the genre)\n\nFutureworld is the sequel to the equally campy Westworld. The chemistry between the main characters (played by Peter Fonda and Blythe Danner) is actually above average and probably saves the film from utter failure. However, I enjoyed myself despite the predictability, the absolutely silly premise, the lack of action (there’s a sword fight and that’s about it) and the anti- Continue reading →\n\n3.75/5 (Good)\n\nThey Shall Have Stars (1956) is the first of James Blish’s famous Cities in Flight novels (note: the series was not released according to its internal chronology — the third volume, Earthman Come Home was published first in 1955). Continue reading →\n\n8/10 (Very Good)\n\nThe Bitter Tears of Petra von Kant (1972) is by far my favorite Rainer Werner Fassbinder film I’ve seen and like all of his films, an acquired taste. I’ve not always appreciated his works — I barely tolerated The Merchant of Four Seasons and managed to watch only half of The Marriage of Maria Braun (I did enjoy Veronika Voss). However, Continue reading →\n\n7/10 (Good)\n\nOn strong recommendation from my sister I finally got around to seeing this unusual Colombian film. I have to admit, I know very little about Spanish language cinema (especially from the Americas). Regardless, I found The Wind Journeys a fascinating experience — one Continue reading →\n\n7/10 (Good)\n\nDamn the Defiant! isn’t the best naval action film out there however it’s definitely an under appreciated good film. That said, I have a weakness for the subject matter since I grew up on C. S. Forester’s Hornblower and Alexander Kent’s Captain Bolitho books (i.e Napoleonic era valiant British officers fighting the evil Frenchies!). Thus, Continue reading →"
