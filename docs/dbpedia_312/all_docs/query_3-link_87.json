        "text": "Scene 4\n\nSynopsis:\n\nMalvolio, dressed ridiculously and smiling grotesquely, appears before an astonished Olivia. Thinking him insane, she puts him in the care of Sir Toby, who decides to treat him as a madman by having him bound and put in a dark room. Toby also decides to deliver Sir Andrew’s challenge to Cesario in person in order to force the two of them into a duel. Terrified, they prepare to fight. At that moment, Antonio enters, thinks that Cesario is Sebastian, and comes to his defense. Antonio is immediately arrested by Orsino’s officers. Since he is sure that Viola is Sebastian, Antonio is bitter about the apparent denial of their friendship. Viola is herself delighted by Antonio’s angry words because, since he called her Sebastian, there is hope that her brother may in fact be alive.\n\nEnter Olivia and Maria.\n\nOLIVIA, ⌜aside⌝\n\n1548 I have sent after him. He says he’ll come.\n\n1549 How shall I feast him? What bestow of him?\n\n1550 For youth is bought more oft than begged or\n\n1551 borrowed.\n\n1552 5 I speak too loud.—\n\n1553 Where’s Malvolio? He is sad and civil\n\n1554 And suits well for a servant with my fortunes.\n\n1555 Where is Malvolio?\n\nMARIA 1556 He’s coming, madam, but in very strange manner.\n\n1557 10 He is sure possessed, madam.\n\nOLIVIA 1558 Why, what’s the matter? Does he rave?\n\nMARIA 1559 No, madam, he does nothing but smile. Your\n\n1560 Ladyship were best to have some guard about you if\n\n1561 he come, for sure the man is tainted in ’s wits.\n\nOLIVIA\n\n1562 15 Go call him hither. ⌜Maria exits.⌝ I am as mad as he,\n\n1563 If sad and merry madness equal be.\n\np. 113\n\nEnter ⌜Maria with⌝ Malvolio.\n\n1564 How now, Malvolio?\n\nMALVOLIO 1565 Sweet lady, ho, ho!\n\nOLIVIA 1566 Smil’st thou? I sent for thee upon a sad\n\n1567 20 occasion.\n\nMALVOLIO 1568 Sad, lady? I could be sad. This does make\n\n1569 some obstruction in the blood, this cross-gartering,\n\n1570 but what of that? If it please the eye of one, it is\n\n1571 with me as the very true sonnet is: “Please one, and\n\n1572 25 please all.”\n\n⌜OLIVIA⌝ 1573 Why, how dost thou, man? What is the matter\n\n1574 with thee?\n\nMALVOLIO 1575 Not black in my mind, though yellow in my\n\n1576 legs. It did come to his hands, and commands shall\n\n1577 30 be executed. I think we do know the sweet Roman\n\n1578 hand.\n\nOLIVIA 1579 Wilt thou go to bed, Malvolio?\n\nMALVOLIO 1580 To bed? “Ay, sweetheart, and I’ll come to\n\n1581 thee.”\n\nOLIVIA 1582 35God comfort thee! Why dost thou smile so, and\n\n1583 kiss thy hand so oft?\n\nMARIA 1584 How do you, Malvolio?\n\nMALVOLIO 1585 At your request? Yes, nightingales answer\n\n1586 daws!\n\nMARIA 1587 40Why appear you with this ridiculous boldness\n\n1588 before my lady?\n\nMALVOLIO 1589 “Be not afraid of greatness.” ’Twas well\n\n1590 writ.\n\nOLIVIA 1591 What mean’st thou by that, Malvolio?\n\nMALVOLIO 1592 45“Some are born great—”\n\nOLIVIA 1593 Ha?\n\nMALVOLIO 1594 “Some achieve greatness—”\n\nOLIVIA 1595 What sayst thou?\n\nMALVOLIO 1596 “And some have greatness thrust upon\n\n1597 50 them.”\n\np. 115\n\nOLIVIA 1598 Heaven restore thee!\n\nMALVOLIO 1599 “Remember who commended thy yellow\n\n1600 stockings—”\n\nOLIVIA 1601 Thy yellow stockings?\n\nMALVOLIO 1602 55“And wished to see thee cross-gartered.”\n\nOLIVIA 1603 Cross-gartered?\n\nMALVOLIO 1604 “Go to, thou art made, if thou desir’st to be\n\n1605 so—”\n\nOLIVIA 1606 Am I made?\n\nMALVOLIO 1607 60“If not, let me see thee a servant still.”\n\nOLIVIA 1608 Why, this is very midsummer madness!\n\nEnter Servant.\n\nSERVANT 1609 Madam, the young gentleman of the Count\n\n1610 Orsino’s is returned. I could hardly entreat him\n\n1611 back. He attends your Ladyship’s pleasure.\n\nOLIVIA 1612 65I’ll come to him. ⌜Servant exits.⌝ Good Maria, let\n\n1613 this fellow be looked to. Where’s my Cousin Toby?\n\n1614 Let some of my people have a special care of him. I\n\n1615 would not have him miscarry for the half of my\n\n1616 dowry.\n\n⌜Olivia and Maria⌝ exit ⌜in different directions.⌝\n\nMALVOLIO 1617 70O ho, do you come near me now? No worse\n\n1618 man than Sir Toby to look to me. This concurs\n\n1619 directly with the letter. She sends him on purpose\n\n1620 that I may appear stubborn to him, for she incites\n\n1621 me to that in the letter: “Cast thy humble slough,”\n\n1622 75 says she. “Be opposite with a kinsman, surly with\n\n1623 servants; let thy tongue ⌜tang⌝ with arguments of\n\n1624 state; put thyself into the trick of singularity,” and\n\n1625 consequently sets down the manner how: as, a sad\n\n1626 face, a reverend carriage, a slow tongue, in the habit\n\n1627 80 of some Sir of note, and so forth. I have limed her,\n\n1628 but it is Jove’s doing, and Jove make me thankful!\n\n1629 And when she went away now, “Let this fellow be\n\n1630 looked to.” “Fellow!” Not “Malvolio,” nor after my\n\np. 117\n\n1631 degree, but “fellow.” Why, everything adheres together,\n\n1632 85 that no dram of a scruple, no scruple of a\n\n1633 scruple, no obstacle, no incredulous or unsafe\n\n1634 circumstance—what can be said? Nothing that can\n\n1635 be can come between me and the full prospect of\n\n1636 my hopes. Well, Jove, not I, is the doer of this, and\n\n1637 90 he is to be thanked.\n\nEnter Toby, Fabian, and Maria.\n\nTOBY 1638 Which way is he, in the name of sanctity? If all\n\n1639 the devils of hell be drawn in little, and Legion\n\n1640 himself possessed him, yet I’ll speak to him.\n\nFABIAN 1641 Here he is, here he is.—How is ’t with you, sir?\n\n1642 95 How is ’t with you, man?\n\nMALVOLIO 1643 Go off, I discard you. Let me enjoy my\n\n1644 private. Go off.\n\nMARIA, ⌜to Toby⌝ 1645 Lo, how hollow the fiend speaks\n\n1646 within him! Did not I tell you? Sir Toby, my lady\n\n1647 100 prays you to have a care of him.\n\nMALVOLIO 1648 Aha, does she so?\n\nTOBY, ⌜to Fabian and Maria⌝ 1649 Go to, go to! Peace, peace.\n\n1650 We must deal gently with him. Let me alone.—How\n\n1651 do you, Malvolio? How is ’t with you? What, man,\n\n1652 105 defy the devil! Consider, he’s an enemy to mankind.\n\nMALVOLIO 1653 Do you know what you say?\n\nMARIA, ⌜to Toby⌝ 1654 La you, an you speak ill of the devil,\n\n1655 how he takes it at heart! Pray God he be not\n\n1656 bewitched!\n\nFABIAN 1657 110Carry his water to th’ wisewoman.\n\nMARIA 1658 Marry, and it shall be done tomorrow morning\n\n1659 if I live. My lady would not lose him for more than\n\n1660 I’ll say.\n\nMALVOLIO 1661 How now, mistress?\n\nMARIA 1662 115O Lord!\n\nTOBY 1663 Prithee, hold thy peace. This is not the way. Do\n\n1664 you not see you move him? Let me alone with\n\n1665 him.\n\np. 119\n\nFABIAN 1666 No way but gentleness, gently, gently. The\n\n1667 120 fiend is rough and will not be roughly used.\n\nTOBY, ⌜to Malvolio⌝ 1668 Why, how now, my bawcock? How\n\n1669 dost thou, chuck?\n\nMALVOLIO 1670 Sir!\n\nTOBY 1671 Ay, biddy, come with me.—What, man, ’tis not\n\n1672 125 for gravity to play at cherry-pit with Satan. Hang\n\n1673 him, foul collier!\n\nMARIA 1674 Get him to say his prayers, good Sir Toby; get\n\n1675 him to pray.\n\nMALVOLIO 1676 My prayers, minx?\n\nMARIA, ⌜to Toby⌝ 1677 130No, I warrant you, he will not hear of\n\n1678 godliness.\n\nMALVOLIO 1679 Go hang yourselves all! You are idle, shallow\n\n1680 things. I am not of your element. You shall\n\n1681 know more hereafter.He exits.\n\nTOBY 1682 135Is ’t possible?\n\nFABIAN 1683 If this were played upon a stage now, I could\n\n1684 condemn it as an improbable fiction.\n\nTOBY 1685 His very genius hath taken the infection of the\n\n1686 device, man.\n\nMARIA 1687 140Nay, pursue him now, lest the device take air\n\n1688 and taint.\n\nFABIAN 1689 Why, we shall make him mad indeed.\n\nMARIA 1690 The house will be the quieter.\n\nTOBY 1691 Come, we’ll have him in a dark room and\n\n1692 145 bound. My niece is already in the belief that he’s\n\n1693 mad. We may carry it thus, for our pleasure and his\n\n1694 penance, till our very pastime, tired out of breath,\n\n1695 prompt us to have mercy on him, at which time we\n\n1696 will bring the device to the bar and crown thee for a\n\n1697 150 finder of madmen. But see, but see!\n\nEnter Sir Andrew.\n\nFABIAN 1698 More matter for a May morning.\n\nANDREW, ⌜presenting a paper⌝ 1699 Here’s the challenge.\n\n1700 Read it. I warrant there’s vinegar and pepper in ’t.\n\np. 121\n\nFABIAN 1701 Is ’t so saucy?\n\nANDREW 1702 155Ay, is ’t. I warrant him. Do but read.\n\nTOBY 1703 Give me. ⌜He reads.⌝ Youth, whatsoever thou art,\n\n1704 thou art but a scurvy fellow.\n\nFABIAN 1705 Good, and valiant.\n\nTOBY ⌜reads⌝ 1706 Wonder not nor admire not in thy mind\n\n1707 160 why I do call thee so, for I will show thee no reason\n\n1708 for ’t.\n\nFABIAN 1709 A good note, that keeps you from the blow of\n\n1710 the law.\n\nTOBY ⌜reads⌝ 1711 Thou com’st to the Lady Olivia, and in my\n\n1712 165 sight she uses thee kindly. But thou liest in thy throat;\n\n1713 that is not the matter I challenge thee for.\n\nFABIAN 1714 Very brief, and to exceeding good sense—less.\n\nTOBY ⌜reads⌝ 1715 I will waylay thee going home, where if it be\n\n1716 thy chance to kill me—\n\nFABIAN 1717 170Good.\n\nTOBY ⌜reads⌝ 1718 Thou kill’st me like a rogue and a villain.\n\nFABIAN 1719 Still you keep o’ th’ windy side of the law.\n\n1720 Good.\n\nTOBY ⌜reads⌝ 1721 Fare thee well, and God have mercy upon\n\n1722 175 one of our souls. He may have mercy upon mine, but\n\n1723 my hope is better, and so look to thyself. Thy friend, as\n\n1724 thou usest him, and thy sworn enemy,\n\n1725 Andrew Aguecheek.\n\n1726 If this letter move him not, his legs cannot. I’ll\n\n1727 180 give ’t him.\n\nMARIA 1728 You may have very fit occasion for ’t. He is now\n\n1729 in some commerce with my lady and will by and\n\n1730 by depart.\n\nTOBY 1731 Go, Sir Andrew. Scout me for him at the corner\n\n1732 185 of the orchard like a bum-baily. So soon as ever\n\n1733 thou seest him, draw, and as thou draw’st, swear\n\n1734 horrible, for it comes to pass oft that a terrible oath,\n\n1735 with a swaggering accent sharply twanged off, gives\n\n1736 manhood more approbation than ever proof itself\n\n1737 190 would have earned him. Away!\n\np. 123\n\nANDREW 1738 Nay, let me alone for swearing.He exits.\n\nTOBY 1739 Now will not I deliver his letter, for the behavior\n\n1740 of the young gentleman gives him out to be of good\n\n1741 capacity and breeding; his employment between\n\n1742 195 his lord and my niece confirms no less. Therefore,\n\n1743 this letter, being so excellently ignorant, will breed\n\n1744 no terror in the youth. He will find it comes from a\n\n1745 clodpoll. But, sir, I will deliver his challenge by\n\n1746 word of mouth, set upon Aguecheek a notable\n\n1747 200 report of valor, and drive the gentleman (as I know\n\n1748 his youth will aptly receive it) into a most hideous\n\n1749 opinion of his rage, skill, fury, and impetuosity. This\n\n1750 will so fright them both that they will kill one\n\n1751 another by the look, like cockatrices.\n\nEnter Olivia and Viola.\n\nFABIAN 1752 205Here he comes with your niece. Give them\n\n1753 way till he take leave, and presently after him.\n\nTOBY 1754 I will meditate the while upon some horrid\n\n1755 message for a challenge.\n\n⌜Toby, Fabian, and Maria exit.⌝\n\nOLIVIA\n\n1756 I have said too much unto a heart of stone\n\n1757 210 And laid mine honor too unchary on ’t.\n\n1758 There’s something in me that reproves my fault,\n\n1759 But such a headstrong potent fault it is\n\n1760 That it but mocks reproof.\n\nVIOLA\n\n1761 With the same ’havior that your passion bears\n\n1762 215 Goes on my master’s griefs.\n\nOLIVIA\n\n1763 Here, wear this jewel for me. ’Tis my picture.\n\n1764 Refuse it not. It hath no tongue to vex you.\n\n1765 And I beseech you come again tomorrow.\n\n1766 What shall you ask of me that I’ll deny,\n\n1767 220 That honor, saved, may upon asking give?\n\np. 125\n\nVIOLA\n\n1768 Nothing but this: your true love for my master.\n\nOLIVIA\n\n1769 How with mine honor may I give him that\n\n1770 Which I have given to you?\n\nVIOLA 1771 I will acquit you.\n\nOLIVIA\n\n1772 225 Well, come again tomorrow. Fare thee well.\n\n1773 A fiend like thee might bear my soul to hell.\n\n⌜She exits.⌝\n\nEnter Toby and Fabian.\n\nTOBY 1774 Gentleman, God save thee.\n\nVIOLA 1775 And you, sir.\n\nTOBY 1776 That defense thou hast, betake thee to ’t. Of what\n\n1777 230 nature the wrongs are thou hast done him, I know\n\n1778 not, but thy intercepter, full of despite, bloody as\n\n1779 the hunter, attends thee at the orchard end. Dismount\n\n1780 thy tuck, be yare in thy preparation, for thy\n\n1781 assailant is quick, skillful, and deadly.\n\nVIOLA 1782 235You mistake, sir. I am sure no man hath any\n\n1783 quarrel to me. My remembrance is very free and\n\n1784 clear from any image of offense done to any man.\n\nTOBY 1785 You’ll find it otherwise, I assure you. Therefore,\n\n1786 if you hold your life at any price, betake you to your\n\n1787 240 guard, for your opposite hath in him what youth,\n\n1788 strength, skill, and wrath can furnish man withal.\n\nVIOLA 1789 I pray you, sir, what is he?\n\nTOBY 1790 He is knight dubbed with unhatched rapier and\n\n1791 on carpet consideration, but he is a devil in private\n\n1792 245 brawl. Souls and bodies hath he divorced three, and\n\n1793 his incensement at this moment is so implacable\n\n1794 that satisfaction can be none but by pangs of death\n\n1795 and sepulcher. “Hob, nob” is his word; “give ’t or\n\n1796 take ’t.”\n\nVIOLA 1797 250I will return again into the house and desire\n\np. 127\n\n1798 some conduct of the lady. I am no fighter. I have\n\n1799 heard of some kind of men that put quarrels purposely\n\n1800 on others to taste their valor. Belike this is a\n\n1801 man of that quirk.\n\nTOBY 1802 255Sir, no. His indignation derives itself out of a very\n\n1803 competent injury. Therefore get you on and give\n\n1804 him his desire. Back you shall not to the house,\n\n1805 unless you undertake that with me which with as\n\n1806 much safety you might answer him. Therefore on,\n\n1807 260 or strip your sword stark naked, for meddle you\n\n1808 must, that’s certain, or forswear to wear iron about\n\n1809 you.\n\nVIOLA 1810 This is as uncivil as strange. I beseech you, do\n\n1811 me this courteous office, as to know of the knight\n\n1812 265 what my offense to him is. It is something of my\n\n1813 negligence, nothing of my purpose.\n\nTOBY 1814 I will do so.—Signior Fabian, stay you by this\n\n1815 gentleman till my return.Toby exits.\n\nVIOLA 1816 Pray you, sir, do you know of this matter?\n\nFABIAN 1817 270I know the knight is incensed against you even\n\n1818 to a mortal arbitrament, but nothing of the circumstance\n\n1819 more.\n\nVIOLA 1820 I beseech you, what manner of man is he?\n\nFABIAN 1821 Nothing of that wonderful promise, to read\n\n1822 275 him by his form, as you are like to find him in the\n\n1823 proof of his valor. He is indeed, sir, the most skillful,\n\n1824 bloody, and fatal opposite that you could possibly\n\n1825 have found in any part of Illyria. Will you walk\n\n1826 towards him? I will make your peace with him if I\n\n1827 280 can.\n\nVIOLA 1828 I shall be much bound to you for ’t. I am one\n\n1829 that had rather go with Sir Priest than Sir Knight, I\n\n1830 care not who knows so much of my mettle.\n\nThey exit.\n\nEnter Toby and Andrew.\n\np. 129\n\nTOBY 1831 Why, man, he’s a very devil. I have not seen such\n\n1832 285 a firago. I had a pass with him, rapier, scabbard,\n\n1833 and all, and he gives me the stuck-in with such\n\n1834 a mortal motion that it is inevitable; and on the\n\n1835 answer, he pays you as surely as your feet hits the\n\n1836 ground they step on. They say he has been fencer\n\n1837 290 to the Sophy.\n\nANDREW 1838 Pox on ’t! I’ll not meddle with him.\n\nTOBY 1839 Ay, but he will not now be pacified. Fabian can\n\n1840 scarce hold him yonder.\n\nANDREW 1841 Plague on ’t! An I thought he had been\n\n1842 295 valiant, and so cunning in fence, I’d have seen him\n\n1843 damned ere I’d have challenged him. Let him let\n\n1844 the matter slip, and I’ll give him my horse, gray\n\n1845 Capilet.\n\nTOBY 1846 I’ll make the motion. Stand here, make a good\n\n1847 300 show on ’t. This shall end without the perdition of\n\n1848 souls. ⌜Aside.⌝ Marry, I’ll ride your horse as well as I\n\n1849 ride you.\n\nEnter Fabian and Viola.\n\n⌜Toby crosses to meet them.⌝\n\n1850 ⌜Aside to Fabian.⌝ I have his horse to take up the\n\n1851 quarrel. I have persuaded him the youth’s a devil.\n\nFABIAN, ⌜aside to Toby⌝ 1852 305He is as horribly conceited of\n\n1853 him, and pants and looks pale as if a bear were at his\n\n1854 heels.\n\nTOBY, ⌜to Viola⌝ 1855 There’s no remedy, sir; he will fight\n\n1856 with you for ’s oath sake. Marry, he hath better\n\n1857 310 bethought him of his quarrel, and he finds that now\n\n1858 scarce to be worth talking of. Therefore, draw for\n\n1859 the supportance of his vow. He protests he will not\n\n1860 hurt you.\n\nVIOLA 1861 Pray God defend me! ⌜Aside.⌝ A little thing\n\n1862 315 would make me tell them how much I lack of a\n\n1863 man.\n\np. 131\n\nFABIAN 1864 Give ground if you see him furious.\n\n⌜Toby crosses to Andrew.⌝\n\nTOBY 1865 Come, Sir Andrew, there’s no remedy. The\n\n1866 gentleman will, for his honor’s sake, have one bout\n\n1867 320 with you. He cannot by the duello avoid it. But he\n\n1868 has promised me, as he is a gentleman and a soldier,\n\n1869 he will not hurt you. Come on, to ’t.\n\nANDREW, ⌜drawing his sword⌝ 1870 Pray God he keep his\n\n1871 oath!\n\nVIOLA, ⌜drawing her sword⌝\n\n1872 325 I do assure you ’tis against my will.\n\nEnter Antonio.\n\nANTONIO, ⌜to Andrew⌝\n\n1873 Put up your sword. If this young gentleman\n\n1874 Have done offense, I take the fault on me.\n\n1875 If you offend him, I for him defy you.\n\nTOBY 1876 You, sir? Why, what are you?\n\nANTONIO, ⌜drawing his sword⌝\n\n1877 330 One, sir, that for his love dares yet do more\n\n1878 Than you have heard him brag to you he will.\n\nTOBY, ⌜drawing his sword⌝\n\n1879 Nay, if you be an undertaker, I am for you.\n\nEnter Officers.\n\nFABIAN 1880 O, good Sir Toby, hold! Here come the officers.\n\nTOBY, ⌜to Antonio⌝ 1881 I’ll be with you anon.\n\nVIOLA, ⌜to Andrew⌝ 1882 335Pray, sir, put your sword up, if\n\n1883 you please.\n\nANDREW 1884 Marry, will I, sir. And for that I promised\n\n1885 you, I’ll be as good as my word. He will bear you\n\n1886 easily, and reins well.\n\nFIRST OFFICER 1887 340This is the man. Do thy office.\n\nSECOND OFFICER 1888 Antonio, I arrest thee at the suit of\n\n1889 Count Orsino.\n\nANTONIO 1890 You do mistake me, sir.\n\np. 133\n\nFIRST OFFICER\n\n1891 No, sir, no jot. I know your favor well,\n\n1892 345 Though now you have no sea-cap on your head.—\n\n1893 Take him away. He knows I know him well.\n\nANTONIO\n\n1894 I must obey. ⌜To Viola.⌝ This comes with seeking\n\n1895 you.\n\n1896 But there’s no remedy. I shall answer it.\n\n1897 350 What will you do, now my necessity\n\n1898 Makes me to ask you for my purse? It grieves me\n\n1899 Much more for what I cannot do for you\n\n1900 Than what befalls myself. You stand amazed,\n\n1901 But be of comfort.\n\nSECOND OFFICER 1902 355 Come, sir, away.\n\nANTONIO, ⌜to Viola⌝\n\n1903 I must entreat of you some of that money.\n\nVIOLA 1904 What money, sir?\n\n1905 For the fair kindness you have showed me here,\n\n1906 And part being prompted by your present trouble,\n\n1907 360 Out of my lean and low ability\n\n1908 I’ll lend you something. My having is not much.\n\n1909 I’ll make division of my present with you.\n\n1910 Hold, there’s half my coffer.⌜Offering him money.⌝\n\nANTONIO 1911 Will you deny me now?\n\n1912 365 Is ’t possible that my deserts to you\n\n1913 Can lack persuasion? Do not tempt my misery,\n\n1914 Lest that it make me so unsound a man\n\n1915 As to upbraid you with those kindnesses\n\n1916 That I have done for you.\n\nVIOLA 1917 370 I know of none,\n\n1918 Nor know I you by voice or any feature.\n\n1919 I hate ingratitude more in a man\n\n1920 Than lying, vainness, babbling drunkenness,\n\n1921 Or any taint of vice whose strong corruption\n\n1922 375 Inhabits our frail blood—\n\nANTONIO 1923 O heavens themselves!\n\np. 135\n\nSECOND OFFICER 1924 Come, sir, I pray you go.\n\nANTONIO\n\n1925 Let me speak a little. This youth that you see here\n\n1926 I snatched one half out of the jaws of death,\n\n1927 380 Relieved him with such sanctity of love,\n\n1928 And to his image, which methought did promise\n\n1929 Most venerable worth, did I devotion.\n\nFIRST OFFICER\n\n1930 What’s that to us? The time goes by. Away!\n\nANTONIO\n\n1931 But O, how vile an idol proves this god!\n\n1932 385 Thou hast, Sebastian, done good feature shame.\n\n1933 In nature there’s no blemish but the mind;\n\n1934 None can be called deformed but the unkind.\n\n1935 Virtue is beauty, but the beauteous evil\n\n1936 Are empty trunks o’erflourished by the devil.\n\nFIRST OFFICER\n\n1937 390 The man grows mad. Away with him.—Come,\n\n1938 come, sir.\n\nANTONIO 1939 Lead me on.\n\n⌜Antonio and Officers⌝ exit.\n\nVIOLA, ⌜aside⌝\n\n1940 Methinks his words do from such passion fly\n\n1941 That he believes himself; so do not I.\n\n1942 395 Prove true, imagination, O, prove true,\n\n1943 That I, dear brother, be now ta’en for you!\n\nTOBY 1944 Come hither, knight; come hither, Fabian. We’ll\n\n1945 whisper o’er a couplet or two of most sage saws.\n\n⌜Toby, Fabian, and Andrew move aside.⌝\n\nVIOLA, ⌜aside⌝\n\n1946 He named Sebastian. I my brother know\n\n1947 400 Yet living in my glass. Even such and so\n\n1948 In favor was my brother, and he went\n\n1949 Still in this fashion, color, ornament,\n\n1950 For him I imitate. O, if it prove,\n\n1951 Tempests are kind, and salt waves fresh in love!\n\n⌜She exits.⌝\n\np. 137\n\nTOBY 1952 405A very dishonest, paltry boy, and more a coward\n\n1953 than a hare. His dishonesty appears in leaving his\n\n1954 friend here in necessity and denying him; and for\n\n1955 his cowardship, ask Fabian.\n\nFABIAN 1956 A coward, a most devout coward, religious\n\n1957 410 in it.\n\nANDREW 1958 ’Slid, I’ll after him again and beat him.\n\nTOBY 1959 Do, cuff him soundly, but never draw thy\n\n1960 sword.\n\nANDREW 1961 An I do not—\n\nFABIAN 1962 415Come, let’s see the event.\n\nTOBY 1963 I dare lay any money ’twill be nothing yet.\n\n⌜They⌝ exit."
