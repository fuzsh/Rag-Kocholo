        "text": "Raúl Ruiz (25 July 1941 – 19 August 2011) was one of Latin America's most important and prolific filmmakers, having directed more than a hundred films. His cinema, often considered baroque, experimental, eclectic, imaginative, ironic and beguiling, explores questions of anthropology, literature, philosophy and psychoanalysis with a piercing intellectual curiosity. Born in Puerto Montt, Ruiz remained in Chile until 1973 when he was forced to flee the country during the coup d'etat against Salvador Allende's government. Before his exile to France, Ruiz was a film adviser to Allende's socialist coalition. Along with fellow filmmakers Miguel Littin, Aldo Francia and Helvio Soto, he was part of the new wave of Chilean cinema. His first feature, Three Sad Tigers (1968), won the Golden Leopard at the Locarno Film Festival in 1969. In Europe he made numerous limited-budget films that were highly personal and experimental; among them are The Hypothesis of the Stolen Painting (1978), The Suspended Vocation (1978), The Territory (1981), Three Crowns of the Sailor (1982), and Bérénice (1983). In the 1990s Ruiz made his first film in the US: The Golden Boat (1990). From that point on he directed star-led features with big budgets, although he continued filming experimental low budget films. His filmography also includes Dark at Noon (1992), Genealogies of a Crime (1997), Time Regained (1999), The Comedy of Innocence (2000), Cofralandes: Chilean Rhapsody (2001), and Mysteries of Libson (2010)."
