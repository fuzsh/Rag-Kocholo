        "text": "I am trying to find an older black-and-white tv segment, about a business man being replaced by a robot. It focuses on his office, and the sign on his door, where in several scenes he goes from like personnel assistant, through personnel manager, through vice president, by continuing to fire more and more workers. At the end, he comes to his office, and his sign is missing, and he has been replaced by a robot.\n\nI have not seen this, it was described to me by someone else. They thought it was twilight zone, but i went through the twilight zone and night gallery episode guide and didn't see anything like it.\n\nWould appreciate any clues or hints about the show, or where I might go to look.\n\nHeya all, reposting this here, as I think it fits better over here, but I've had this show driving me crazy for months, trying to figure out what it was called.\n\nIt was something I saw in the 90s, a kid's show, but live action. A teen boy (in a blue shirt) and his teen female friend (in a red shirt) end up traveling across dimensions/alien worlds in a ship they call the egg. The girl knew martial arts, and the boy could \"glitch\" which means changing his arms or legs into different things. There were at least two alien creatures that traveled with them, one of them was a small blue furry guy with ice powers. The other alien was a bit bigger than the humans, and while I can visualize him, he's hard to describe. Dark, almost rocky or scaly type skin.\n\nThey were partially looking for someone that the aliens called the \"Stranger\" who was actually the teen boy's long lost father, who dimension traveled before. The Stranger had served a princess in another dimension, too.\n\nThe only other things I can remember, and this is somewhat vague, is that the princess had been overthrown by the antagonist of the series, and the Stranger had disappeared. A lot of the locations seemed dark, with cloudy skies. Kinda dystopian locations.\n\nHonestly, that's all I can remember. Hoping it jars someone's memory, because not knowing what this was, has been driving me crazy for months.\n\nMy family has been trying to remember the name of this tv series (or mini series) that we watched on ABC in either the late 90s or early 2000s. It is driving us NUTS!!! Please help.\n\nThese are the memories of the four of us combined so some might be incorrect...\n\nIt was about an evil little boy who was about 5. His family lived in a house in a forest/woods... we think it was winter because most of the trees had no leaves and it was very dull looking. The family moved into this house at the start of the movie.\n\nMy dad thinks he was originally a twin and his twin brother/sister was stillborn. Some of us also remember a baby sister that he torments (I think he might have set her on fire at some point? We definitely remember him pushing her off the swings and the mum witnessing this from the kitchen window). We also think he had a dog that he tortured and/or killed.\n\nWe all thought his name was Damien but it was not The Omen (it wasn't that old and some of the plot does not match) and we have come to the conclusion that this probably was not his name.\n\nThe main thing we remember is the little boy used to say \"play with me mummy\"... he'd be left outside all day bored (we think after the new baby was born) and when she wouldn't play with him, he would do evil things.\n\nDoes anyone know?\n\nWe don't think it was a movie. We remember watching it over a series of nights but not for a long period of time... so probably a mini series.\n\nI have been haunted by this for many days now. It's a tv mini series that was aired in the late 90s/early 2000s. Its genre is scifi. Basically, it's about people from a kingdom who have to find a new crystal for their protection/power source (can't exactly remember) So they set out on a quest to find these crystals, but there are people who want to make sure that they fail. The main bad guy has an enchanted bow that shoots arrows that never miss. I vaguely remember them either swimming of driving a submarine type device into an underwater cave that is glowing, perhaps guarded my some sort of fierce creature, but when they enter the cave they find all the crystals they could ever need. I thought about this right before I want to sleep nearly 3 weeks ago and It is killing me. I. must. know!\n\nHello everyone!\n\nI tried to find if there was any posts to answer my question but seems there is not any posts so here I go (please bear with me – it is my first time here).\n\nThis TV show was aired, I believe, as a pilot way back in 1980s...the characters were two men and a woman and the leading character was a kind of archer with a raven. Every time, when the leading character ran out of the arrows, the raven would turn into arrows. Does anybody know what the TV's title was?\n\nAlso, every time before they went into commercials, they would show a still photo of the characters: the leading man in front with the bow while the other two characters were standing kinda back to back holding their weapons...they were standing in a kind of fog...\n\nHope the information I supplied was helpful!\n\nMuch appreciated!\n\ni recently watched Dinotopia which is basically what you mention..except the bad guy didn't have a bow.\n\nthis was ina nswer to this:I have been haunted by this for many days now.

I. must. know!\n\nLooking for the name of a short, Australian (AFAIK) CG animated series about two anarchic Aliens who used to fly down to Earth and get into a lot of mischief.\n\nVery black and TOTALLY inappropriate for kids. They'd get in the kitchen and one of them would die in a blender, or get in the shed and start using a circular saw, that kind of thing.\n\nThe show couldn't have been any more than a minute long. I am wracking my brain and going nuts trying to remember the name of it! I've already Googled it and searched the ABC website but keep coming up empty. There is a VERY long list of ex shows on the ABC on Wiki, but would prefer not to have print that list and go through it one by one! Who knew Alien's were so popular!\n\nWill post this to the ABC thread as well, but this is just driving me insane...\n\nHi! I have a lost movie or tv show, can't remember which.\n\nI can only remember one scene of the movie or tv show I'm thinking of. It was towards the end of it, and I'm fairly sure it was some kind of a detective show. I also think it is likely that it was some kind of masterpiece mystery thing from pbs or bbc, because my parents watched a lot of those when I was young and that's who I was watching it with. It shows a young woman, with short ish blonde hair, dressed in white, up in a tower, I think it's light house. she is tied to a chair, and she is about to be strangled with a belt or rope by a man standing behind her. she's crying. the man starts strangling her, and she gets very white. people are racing up the spiral staircase to save her, which they do. I seem to remember that the reason he's strangling her has something to do with a legend about strangling virgins at midnight every so many years. it also may be that the strangler and the girl he's strangling have some kind of family history between their two separate families that causes or feeds this legend, like maybe the man is punishing the girls family for some past wrong. I want to say it was set in some older time, like the 20's or 40's, and I think it may have been in England. the movie or show was made no earlier than the 80s or 90s, and I'd go with later too because the quality and color of the film suggested modern camera techniques. if anyone knows what tv show or movie this is, please reply! thanks\n\nLooking for a show that was on very recently. Not sure if it is a series or a one off, might still be going.\n\nOk: so documentry or factual show, pretty sure it was about the Iraq war or could have been on afghanistan.\n\nI remember seeing it in the tv guide but i missed it, and then today I saw an advert for it on a bus going past.\n\nThe name was something like \"through their eyes\" or something like that? or maybe that was a slogan?\n\nThe advert of the bus had the BBC logo on it. Really surprised they were actually advertising a documentary.\n\nGoogle has failed me.\n\nedit: i've searched bbc's website and can't find anything like it. I think i'm seeing things :O\n\nOk, so I think it might be http://www.abc.net.au/tv/programs/iraq-war/\n\nEdit 3: I just had a thought, maybe I mixed this up, so maybe the advert I saw on the bus was for another show? I'm certain that it said 'through their eyes' and had a picture of this middle eastern person's eyes?\n\nI seen an episode of a TV show in the US and though it might be a new series.\n\nThey have some sort of time travel device where they seem to step into the time stream.\n\nThe episode I seen had to do with a bomb going off in New York in the 1930's I think and they travelled back to talk the person out of it.\n\nThen they travelled on some hidden road to make the spot to return to their own time. Towards the end of the episode a military officer grabs a pistol and jumps into the time stream causing a 'blip' on their machines.\n\nSorry if it sounds vague, I caught it channel surfing in a motel. I think it was on HBO.\n\nHas anyone seen it? Or does anyone know what the show is called?\n\nOh boy...any help would be brilliant!\n\nI am after the name of a UK tv show, (90's maybe?), that was about a band getting together and their manager, in my memory at least, looked like Bill Bailey.\n\nI say looked like because I can't find anything done by him that is like this show, even though the timeline fits pretty well. I am pretty sure the main singer for the band was a woman and she was trying to get together with another member of the band.\n\nDisclaimer: my family are pretty sure this show does not and never has existed and I am losing it in my twilight years, but I push on regardless.\n\nShould anyone have a name I will have to check it out because nothing springs to mind but rest assured that any help is appreciated and would put to rest one of the things that bugs me eternally but has no reason to!\n\nhsdy writes...\n\nTrying to find some info on a cartoon i watched when i was kid, probably mid 90's. I'm sure it was called Moonstone or The Moonstone but i can't find any info on it anywhere. I remember there being a castle and a rainbow and a wizard and there was a moonstone they kept in the castle and the baddies kept trying to steal it for some reason or another.\n\nAnyone remember it by my vague description?\n\nSorry about this reply being a year late. But I do believe the show you are looking for is called The Dreamstone. I remember racking my brains for ages with this one, too. I'm not sure if it was another thread on Whirlpool, or another forum on the Internet, where I finally found the answer.\n\nI was wondering if anyone could help identify the TV programme (I have used up all other resources in searching for the answer, and am beginning to think it was just a very vivid dream from my childhood!)\n\nI think it was probably a British made for tv film in the 80s though may be mistaken.\n\nA female reporter is in a room with a male prisoner who I think is on death row. I think there may have been cell blocks containing both male and female prisoners in an arc around a curved wall (I can always picture a female prisoner smoking, and two of the prisoners being in a relationship. The reporter feels sad for them as they will never get to be together. I vaguely remember one of them dying too!). At one point in the film I remember the reporter being held captive, and him pulling something on her, possibly a knife!\n\nIf anyone has any ideas of what it could be I'd appreciate it. I was only 5-6 when I saw it so can't promise my recall is entirely accurate. Thanks.\n\nI'm trying to find evidence of a documentary shown around 5 years ago on ABC or SBS covering the then recently unsealed information (ie 25 years later) about an assassination attempt on Prince Charles and Lady Diana at the Big Pineapple on the sunshine coast.\n\nThe documentary was in depth covering the lives of the two Irish nationals who had starting working at the Big Pineapple a few months before the scheduled royal visit. It showed live footage of the assassins bullet hitting the open tour carriage cm's from Charles's head while Charles was being interviewed. Charles flinched and then laughed it off assuming a branch or something had fallen on the roof. It showed how the assassins prepared for the attack, how they'd planted the sniper rifle at the park in a styrofoam box, how a piece of the styrofoam ended up jamming the rifles cocking mechanism after the first shot was fired and how the two were apprehended the same day.\n\nThere is zero information on Google about this event or the documentary as if the records were sealed again and any traces have been removed.\n\nDoes anyone know anything about this documentary or the event?\n\nOk this show has been bugging me for about 10 years now... I've always suspected it's something like one of the Stargate series or Sliders but I have personally reviewed every single ep of each series and and haven't found it.\n\nThe scene I can remember is a group of \"travellers\" who have been captured and imprisoned by a tribe of people somewhere crossed between a Native American Indian and an Ancient Oriental culture.\n\nThis tribe doesn't speak English and the \"language/cultural expert\" tries to reason with the people but a lot seems to be lost in translation.\n\nIn order to be freed they have to play a game and beat the chief in this game. The game is played with a ring of stones on a board and there is an open position in the middle, stones are swapped turn by turn into empty positions and through rules that are not understood opponents stones can be captured or something like that until a winner is declared.\n\nAlthough the rules aren't understood by the main characters, they don't know what's happening and they are playing against the tribe's champion of this game the travellers miraculously manage to win and are freed.\n\nMy guess is late 90's SciFi but nothing I've been able to come across seems to fit.\n\nPlease, if anyone could suggest anything it would be greatly appreciated.\n\nRegards.\n\nYes I have seen it but it was about ten years ago when I was on a trawler at 3am.So I too thought it was a dream but it did happen and I really want this made public.Me and you are on a mission.I remember everything about the show and how it happen but I have only met one other person who had seen it and he called me a liar until he and his miss's seen it.So after 10 or 12 years I now have only met two other people who have seen it. Join the club mate !! its a small one though :).It needs to be made public.\n\nName of a TV Series with a magic box?\n\nWell, I'm looking after the title of a (BBC I think) TV Series which star a teenager girl who's mother had recently died and she now lives with her father. She had her birthday and she got for present a wooden box which had some magical creatures/figures who are statues and become alive at night. Well, one day she says something on the lines on \"Wake up, i am your master\" and they turn alive! That's the plot episode. I had seen it many years ago on a dvd dubbed in my language (Greek) and I want to see it again, with the rest of the show so badly :(\n\nIf you have seen the show and remember the title please answer me.\n\nI would appriciate any information on how to find the title, including forums with tv series geeks etc.\n\nI am desperate to find the TV Series. I have spend countless hours searching for random names and things I remember with no result, unfortunatelly. Thank you in advance!\n\nI have been desperately trying to find the name of a tv show (may have possibly been a movie though) which I remember watching in the 90's could have been on foxtels nickelodeon or on normal tv. I am very vague on the details but here we go... From what I remember it was about a boy who had a magical sketchpad/pencil and would draw things that would come to life. The only scene I can remember is of the boy sitting in a cafe drawing when a group of bully's try to take his sketchpad/pencil and so he draws a picture of a bicycle and then runs outside to find the bike that he drew and then rides off on it. I think the main character is the boy but he also has a close friend who is a girl?\n\nCan't remember much else sorry, really hope someone remembers this show too!!\n\nGbar. writes...\n\nYeah, that's the one. They also had some dude (I think he was meant to be a street kid or something) that lived in a Vinnie's bin that'd give them info on the stuff they were investigating.\n\nI kinda wish Channel 9 (at least I think it was on Channel 9) would rerun Willing & Abel again.\n\nThe kid who lived in the bin went by the name of Parramatta.\n\nRebecca Rigg played Angela\n\nJust one was played by Martin Vaughan\n\nTina Bursill played their Lawyer\n\nAnd Mark Mitchell played the bumbling goofy cop\n\nCharles Willing and Abel Moore were not detectives, they were a jack of all trades yet they always got caught up in trouble. Abel worked as a waiter in Pistani's restaurant. They lived on a boat\n\nI have a few episodes that i kept on vhs throughout the years. Loved the show and also wish it would come back to free to air tv\n\nBrian White writes...\n\nThe only series I am aware of that followed in Tron's footsteps, was 'Automan'.\n\nBefore posting, I read this thread and 'Automan' was an answer to someone else's question. I looked at the link and that definitely was not it.\n\nThe plot was along the lines of a young (25-30ish) physics boffin who was programming a new type of game. This game was very immersive. So immersive in fact that he, his girlfriend and a mate whilst testing it became part of it.\n\nBut the characters in this game were based on these friends which took some explaining. The programmer 'enhanced' the features of these friends which the friends did not always appreciate (\"Is that what you really thought of me\" type comments).\n\nA few episodes later, the programmer and friends escape the virtual world but so do the virtual characters which cause some predictable mayhem.\n\nI know this was an episode of some kind of horror show, I am thinking it may have been Rod Serling's Night Gallery (US) circa 1970-1973. I have checked episode guides and can't seem to find it though. It was about someone digging a pool and they find a wooden box with broken glass in it and an ancient statue of a horse. Bad things happen and it is determined the horse is cursed and they finally figure out the broken glass was to trick the statue that its mate was in the box with it so they rebury it with a new mirror and I am not sure but something happens at the end--maybe an earthquake? to break the new glass also but they don't know it. Maybe I have it backwards and the earthquake is the first broken mirror and digging a pool is the second time...I am not sure but it is making me crazy trying to figure out what show/episode this was! thanks....RavynG\n\nRavynG writes...\n\nI know this was an episode of some kind of horror show.... It was about someone digging a pool and they find a wooden box with broken glass in it and an ancient statue of a horse.\n\nIf it's the one I'm thinking of I think this was an episode on a show called Ghost Story (it was made in 1972 and hosted by Sebastian Cabot). I remember once they took the horse out of the box it started to grow and they could no longer put it back into it's original box. I did some googling and found out that the show was renamed Circle of Fear during it's first and only season and this particular episode was called Dark Vengeance. This series has also been released on DVD and you should be able to find it on Amazon and maybe eBay.\n\nHope that helps... :)\n\nDear TV gurus: Let me describe the 2nd TV mini-series I've been looking for many years:\n\nIt is canadian, I think (may be american) and tells the story of a nun, from entering the\n\nconvent until leaving to marry a few years later (no,it's not \"Brides of Christ\" – this is much newer)\n\nMost of the later episodes (there are 6 to 12 episodes in all) take place on a beautiful small canadian\n\nfishing town. The nuns are allowed to leave the convent to work on some charity, wearing \"civilian\"\n\nclothes, and that is where misunderstandings begin...\n\nOne of the nuns (a friend of the \"heroine\") has an affair with an older man, a fishing boat master.\n\nAt the end, there is a tragic episode in which this nun commits suicide by jumping in the church,\n\nfrom a high balcony to he floor... Anyone? Thanks a lot.\n\nFor years I thought I had watched two episodes of \"The Twilight Zone\". The one is definately \"Button, Button\" S01E50, but I couldn't trace the second one in the episodes summary on TV.com.\n\nThe story goes like this: An old guy is working at a church. All things go well till they decide to fire him just because he can't read or write. What job can he find at that age? His wife tells him \"We'll find a way. I'll bake my tasty cookies and sell them to the local coffee shops\". Soon they have so many orders that they can no longer manage alone. A big pastry company wants to buy the recipe and sell the cookies nation-wide. All things go well till the guy has to sign the contract. That moment the owner of the company finds out that he's illiterate. He exclames \"My God! Where would you be now if you knew how to read?\" to get the answer \"I would be cleaning the local church\".\n\nDoes it ring a bell? Is it a \"Twilight Zone\" episode or a completely different TV series?\n\nThere's a TV show I've been trying to find for a while.\n\nI remember renting it on a number of occasions from the video story back in aprox. 1997. (possibly earlier). It was a series and I am pretty sure they were feature length (most likely running 70-90 mins) with each episode or edition being a different story or case.\n\nIt was a kids series.\n\nHere's the issue. I only remember a fragment of one scene out of the entire thing.\n\nI'm pretty sure it was a group of kids, that went on all soughts of adventures.\n\nThe distinctive thing that I remember is that one of the kids, a boy, had a pet cockatoo and in this particular fragment that I remember, I believe the cockatoo may have been thought to be dead at a point in the story and the boy was devastated. But it turns out the cockatoo is still alive. (Or, it's possibly that he had to let the cockatoo go for some reason). I do believe the scenario is close to, if not one of these two. The only other thing I remember from this fragment is that they were in some kind of factory or warehouse when the incident with the cockatoo occurred.\n\nThe bird being a cockatoo clearly suggests to me that the show was Australian made and based in Australia.\n\nAs a side note, it's quite possibly this was not considered a 'TV Series' either, and that they were separate tele-movies. (I'm more than sure they were not theatrically released).\n\nAny help would be appreciated.\n\nI think this was an episode of Two Twisted, but I'm not sure.\n\nOne band member feels inadequate and overshadowed by the lead singer. They clash a few times, and when the band member manages to play a guitar chord better than the lead singer, the lead singer's ego is bruised and he fires him.\n\nThe band member then signs a deal with the devil (?) to become famous. Upon signing, the lead singer suddenly crushes a glass in his fist, injuring him and rendering him unable to perform that night. The band member steps up and is a hit with the crowd.\n\nI cannot remember the price of his deal, but ultimately he wants out. The devil asks him to completely play a music sheet on his guitar to get out. As he plays, his hands start bleeding, but he persists. Just as he reaches the end, he sees a symbol that means \"go back to the beginning\" – effectively making the piece an infinite loop, impossible to finish. The episode ends there.\n\n---\n\nThanks in advance!\n\nI just watched an Australian gardening show a few nights ago between midnight and 2:00am where a couple grew vegetables and beef cattle.\n\nAt some point in the show the woman became ill and couldn't really work so she started doing some research regarding why they were yielding a lessor amount of veg each season. Through her research she discovered a much better means of replenishing the soil with the missing nutrients thus not only getting back what she lost but also gaining a greater yield than before.\n\nThough I can talk about the concept of the show, I would very much like to take some notes but for the life of me I can't remember what the show was called nor what night it was on, can anyone help with the series it was from and the actual title of the episode ?\n\n...................Cheers\n\ndeeisme writes...\n\nI think it was ok, been a long time though!\n\nHow about Andromeda?\n\nThe engineer wasn't a girl, but he was a short blonde genius who most notably wouldn't STFU.\n\nAlso had Kevin Sorbo, (aka Hercules) in it, so that should ring a bell.\n\nBlack haired girl was the ships Avatar, (android), and a blonde woman who was captain of the Maru, along with a girl who went from purple to gold during the series and also had a tail initially. There was also a generic warrior dude and a guy called Rev who was meant to be this philosophical creature evolved from bats, (think he left about 2nd series). Being the philosophical one he wore a robe.\n\nShow had 2 main ships, one was Andromeda, (all curvy wurvy and clean), and the other the Eureka Maru (squarish freighter looking).\n\nThey shows version of \"warp\" was called slip streaming and the producers made the mistake of representing it visually as a bunch of rails that weaved in sub space – reminded me of that MS screen saver \"pipes\"(?).\n\nNever really evolved as a show, and the last series was terrible.\n\nI will not be very specific. This show is like a forgotten memory, always pops up to my head from time to time.\n\nThis cartoon(even a movie) could have been aired from late 80's to late 90's, I don't really know. Broadcasting language was russian, since whole channel was in russian (even the show could be russian, but I doubt it).\n\nI don't really remember the concept or any details.\n\nI think the main character was a teenage-ish boy with a overweight man who, I believe, wore this (I don't know why but as a kid remember this, or at least thought it was like that) train driver's unform with blue sleeves all over (maybe a he was a prison inmate? It just came up to my head, don't take that seriously).\n\nThe animation was kind of 80's, ealry 90's maybe. I think they all got these small round black eyes, I'm not sure though.\n\nAll I remember is that they traveled with some kind of goal, and they struggled, they had enemies, not sure were they old ones or not. I remeber this specific scene where there was this trail of fire (probably) and a train nearby(?, it may not be true, somehow that show gives me feeling of a train) and in the next side of that fire trail were some people, now I'm not sure wheter they were foes.\n\nComplex thing, right? Gosh, and I really liked that show, but don't remember it at all, maybe because it was in foreign language ?\n\nAnyways, I'd bow my head to anyone who'd be willing to find this show. Thank you !\n\nmaximus111 writes...\n\nI just watched an Australian gardening show a few nights ago between midnight and 2:00am where a couple grew vegetables and beef cattle.\n\nDid this take up the whole program or was it just a segment?\n\nMaybe Gardening Australia or Landline. If it's an ABC program check http://iview.abc.net.au/ as it might be there. Each programs website has an archive.\n\nThere was a recent episode on Australian Story about a couple who were rehabilitating a sheep/cattle station, but that doesn't sound like the program you were talking about.\n\nsemicolon writes...\n\nhonestly, can't remember much beyond the engineer. A similar type of character showed up in another series and I wondered. I think I enjoyed the few episodes I saw, enough to wonder how it all ended at least. More than that, I'll leave it to you.\n\nThere seems to be a few episodes on Youtube. Promo pics look a bit try hard though. Will check out the first few eps. Cheers.\n\nI vaguely remember seeing an episode of a show around 5 years ago (probably earlier) which involved a boy and his sister washing dishes. I'm pretty sure the sister was arguing about who got to dry the dishes because she refused to touch the water. I'm pretty sure in the end the boy won and she started to wash the plates only to then cry out (I'm not really sure it's just a distant memory.).\n\nShe might of then \"malfunctioned\" and chases her brother upstars where he locked himself and his dog inside his room. I think he started petting the dog and realised that a chunk of fur was missing reveling wires and blinking lights. He freaks out and runs downstairs where his parents had entered and told them everything (?) they then tell him that they're all robots including him.\n\nI also remember an episode that involved a girl in school who was shrunk down (once again I don't remember much) and placed into a test rat maze.\n\nI'm sorry if I didn't give enough information.\n\nI'm pretty sure it was like a Twilight Zone but for kids\n\nThank you in advance\n\nHi guys, I've been trying to find this cartoon for ages. I recall watching it when I was a child, so it aired in the mid or late 90s, probably on ABC. It was an animated show or movie and there was a little girl and she had a carton of eggs (I think?), and when she opened the carton, the eggs would glow a little. I vaguely remember her trying to put them in a fridge in a dimly lit house that was kind of hidden away, but the eggs were screeching or came to life or something, trying to get her attention. The overall lighting was relatively dim, and there was a lot of blues and some warm yellows in the colour scheme.\n\nThis is all I remember. I recall that it unsettled or freaked me out a bit, a similar feeling to what I had when I watched The Little Match Girl story. It saddened me as a child. It may possibly be from The Little Match Girl, but I have no recollection of them being the same, I think I figured that were different episodes of the same show. The key things I remember were that it was a (poor?) little girl and she goes into a room and there were eggs that did strange things. I could be remembering incorrectly, however. Cheers.\n\nSomeone at some point was referring to the same show, it came up on one of my many google searches, but could not find it either. parts of my description are from that search so if you run across that, http://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/55730/what-was-the-live-action-tv-show-about-magicians?answertab=active#tab-top ,\n\nLooking for a tv show.\n\nbased in modern times, magic is real but public doesn't know.\n\nreal life magicians that are able to use magic but not many.\n\nIn one of the scenes a stage magician was doing the floating card trick and somebody told him try doing it without using tricks, when he started to attempt it the card started to actually float. He then found out that he was one of the real magicians.\"\n\nshow details:\n\nI don't know if it was a series or just a one off but I feel like it may have had a short run\n\nU.S. show\n\nI can't be sure but I believe the \"main\" character was a street magician that either did not know magic was real or had just found out it was but did not want any part of it, people were after him to capture and/or recruit him....basically the normal good vs evil storyline i guess\n\nThe show should be around early new millennium between 2000-2007\n\nDoes anybody have any idea what show this is?\n\n(other people remember something similar but we can never pinpoint what the name was or what tv network it aired on to even backtrack)\n\nOK, I am looking for the name of a TV series, probably 80's or 90's... sorry I don't have more to go on, but here is what I remember:\n\nThe series centered on a man of the tall, dark & handsome variety. Black or brown hair. The episode I am remembering had him sitting at a bar and flirting with a woman. He was wearing a white dress shirt under his suit, and it was glowing. He was trying to hide the fact that his shirt was glowing but the woman commented on it.\n\nI'm fairly certain it was an American primetime series, and not a single episode on a sci-fi show like the Twilight Zone or anything like that. Terribly obscure, I know, but after reading through these threads, there are obviously some TV trivia geniuses on here so I thought I'd give it a shot. :-)\n\n7Mate or Gem advertised the other day a show (it may be a movie or TV series) about to start soon.\n\nIt was a group of people on what might be a military ship waiting to see if scientist solve whatever was killing people on the mainland.\n\nThe advert implied everyone on the mainland died and they were all that remained of mankind.\n\nI thought at the time \"This looks like a good movie. I wonder why they aren't showing it on their main \" channel\" (seven or nine, can't recall).\n\nThe name had the word \"ship\" in it I think. I thought it looked like an advert for a movie, but in retrospect, could be the pilot of a TV series.\n\nI haven't seen the advert since, and it said \"coming soon\", so perhaps it night be advertised more as it gets closer.\n\nThanks.\n\nEdit – I think I solved it – \"The Last Ship\"\n\nhi just wondering if anyone remembers a tv shows that was on around in the early/mid 2000s. all i remember about the show is that there was two teenage boys who's father had passed and there was a grave and under the grave was a secret hideaway. there also was a girl that was a royal i think and she dressed as a boy to become a musketeer as well as the two boys. the two boys father was a musketeer himself and the two boys found his musketeer gear and followed in his footsteps. the girl had a tunnel in the back of bedroom cupboard that she could sneak out of the castle unseen and sneak back into the castle. thats all that i can remember, so if anyone knows what the show is called can you please reply. thank you\n\nMiss Lulu writes...\n\nPossibly near a tv show station. The large looking out of space creature is befriend by a girl and meets people at the station who think he is just a human in a good costume. The other little creature who remains in the spacecraft to fix it, has one eye and little tentacles. (The tall alien things is dumbish and fun and the little one is more the brain and tech side of things) Not digital at all, sort of low budget aussie tv show. Haha any help wuld be good!!\n\nIt's funny, I don't think I ever watched an episode of this show but I believe I know thew one you mean.\n\nThe space ship was stored in the TV station parking lot, an everyone thought it was a prop or something.\n\nI believe it had a readhead male actor who has been on Neighbours and appeared in another kids show, Mal.com.\n\nUPDATE...\n\nUsing the awesomeness of my brain – all 3 cells held hands... I believe it is Pigs Breakfast.\n\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0252778/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_16\n\nI have 2 tv shows that I have searched endlessly to find. Both of which, as far as I know, are from the late 90's. I thought I may have made them up but my sister remembers both as well.\n\n1. This may have been a movie, but I remember watching it in a 3 part series, once on ABC and once on commercial TV (I think it was 7), it was set in the current time period and about a man who finds a dragon egg. 1 scene I distinctly remember is when the dragon gets taken away and put in a zoo, the man steals him back by putting him in a semi trailer or large truck, and swaps the number plate. I trawled through the wikipedia page about broadcasts with dragons, and all IMDB with \"dragon\" in their title (I believe the title may have been along the line of \"Someone's Dragon\", someone being the name of the man, and I remember at the time mistaking his name for Pink or something similar).\n\n2. This was a TV show about a family of monkeys, but it was just people dressed up in very strange monkey costumes, not unlike the characters of \"the amazing live sea monkeys\". Aired on ABC in the late 90's or perhaps the early 2000's. It is either 1 scene or the entire show, but the father of the monkey family was dressed up like elvis, this is all my sister and I can remember.\n\nThanks\n\nHi All, trying to find a TV series from the 80's or could have been late 70's, it think it ran for about 2 years. It was about aliens that looked like a combination of jellyfish and bluebottles which have landed on earth and have captured humans to be their slaves and serve them. The storyline i can remember was one of the human slaves, a guy who was in his late 20's was always plotting to kill his alien master and take control back, but by the time he had everything organized the aliens foiled the plot and killed his accomplices but he never go found out. I think it was on ABC or even SBS and it was possibly a BBC production.\n\nIt wasn't a cartoon and when i picture the show in my head it was classic 70's space outfits with shiny silver jumpsuits with plastic dome clear space helmets and the jellyfish aliens sort of floated around, they didn't have mouths or anything but could talk somehow, they could have been using telepathy.\n\nLet me know if you have any idea what this show is?\n\nHello Whirlpoolians\n\nI was watching a Firefighter and Rescue TV show on NBN (CH9) Around November – December last year.\n\nWhat would happen is these Firefighters would respond to car accidents and fires in Sydney as well as rescuing trapped people.\n\nI remember a bit of an episode :The fire fighters had responded to a building sprinkler / fire alarm going off and after cleaning everything they tired to reset the alarm but couldn't turn it off as none of their fire fighting keys would open the value control room door and the one of the firefighters asked the security guard about having the door replaced?\n\nI was starting to get into it but then forgot all about it and can't even remember the shows name. Would really like to watch it again.\n\nAnyone know what this might of been? (It's one of those shows like RBT except you get to see firefighters doing their job and recsureing people...)\n\nSo I have a new one for you all.\n\nI've been trying to think of this TV Show/Movie (I truly believe it's a TV Show though) for the past few years and despite remembering a whole scene so vividly, cannot figure out what show it's from.\n\nThe scene:\n\nTwo very bratty girls (I believe one black and one white) are out in the schoolyard (American). They're discussing how they're going to go and have a look at colleges on the weekend. One girl presents airline tickets and tells the other girl that they are locked in to go check out this college. The other girl says something like 'but do you remember last time we were on a plane, what if a fat guy is seated between us.' To which the first girl responds, 'I couldn't take that chance' and reveals she actually bought the/an empty seat on the plane between them.\n\nLater in the episode they're at the parents house of one of the girls and her Dad is asking her about the college, the daughter says she really enjoyed it, to which the father responds 'so they still have Uni-Sex toilets I take it.' (Somethink that was mentioned whilst they were at the college.)\n\nAny ideas? I'd need an episode number if it's a guess so I could actually go check, because I'm not 100% sure I'll know just based on the name (I hope I recall though).\n\nThanks all!\n\nAfter Googling around with no luck, I figured I might as well ask here...\n\nBack in the days of VHS, we had a tape of a cartoon that I used to watch over and over again, and I can't remember what it was called >.<\n\nIt was an educational kids cartoon series that I watched ~20 years ago. What I remember is that the main character was a young boy named Stefan/Stephan/Stephen, and a mischievous cat may have been a recurring (main?) character.\n\nThe episode that stood out most to me was the one about cars/vehicles, and the episodes started with the invention of the wheel, and they explored how transportation has changed over time, ending in a possible future where cars are powered by electricity/batteries (which 20 years later is now a reality!).\n\nOther things I vaguely remember about the show... there was an episode about picking cherries, and the characters we hanging the cherries on their ears to look like earrings. Another episode they made and flew kites.\n\nThere was another episode that had a wolf in one of those wagon cages that circuses used to transport animals. There was a sign on the cage saying \"Lupus\" (or something like that) which makes me think the cartoon may have been made in Europe but was dubbed into English.\n\nHi all,\n\nWondering whether anyone remembers this show from the 90s. I think it was a two-parter about saving the environment. All I can remember is that in the future some animal species is going extinct (I think turtles) and a teenager somehow was able to go back in time (to 1990s \"present day\") to try to get things changed. At the end he returns to his own time in the future and there are many turtles so he must have been successful.\n\nI seem to recall the time travel section being like a CG orange tunnel, and he would ride his skateboard through it to move through time. On the way back I seem to remember the skateboard grinding to a halt in the middle of the \"time tunnel\" and had to walk the rest of the way.\n\nI remember the intro music being quite haunting so I'd really like to hear it again to see if it's as good as I remember!\n\n\"It wasn't a cartoon and when i picture the show in my head it was classic 70's space outfits with shiny silver jumpsuits with plastic dome clear space helmets and the jellyfish aliens sort of floated around, they didn't have mouths or anything but could talk somehow, they could have been using telepathy.\n\nLet me know if you have any idea what this show is?\"\n\nHi, I think you are talking about The Tripods. 3 boys -Will, Henry and Beanpole attempting to overthrow the Tripods and the masters in the city of gold. Starts with their journey to the white mountain where the League of Freeman reside, then series 2 is inside the City of Gold where it is more sci-fi. The masters are gross lol but speak with no mouths. There is still a cult following of this series. Hope I have helped!\n\nHi All,\n\nThis is my first post, and I hope that you can help me to identify the name of a TV Show shown in the last few years. It was a documentary type show with a segment where they showed a person doing a tablecloth pull and it looked at the reasons behind it. I have searched the Internet and have found programs that also did similar such as Mythbusters, Time Warp, Top Gear, Street Genius (None of the Above). All I can recall is that I think it was from the UK and was shown possibly on Channel 9 (either GEM or GO!) and was the scene was based indoors. If you can help, please post, it is beginning to frustrate me. Thanks!\n\nThere are some episodes of a TV show I saw a long time ago. I'd say with certainty it was before 2010, but I don't know what show it was. By the structure of the show I'd imagine it was CSI or Law and order or some show similar.\n\nThe first episode, these police are racing to the court. At the court, the female judge has just instructed closing statements to begin, when a detective bursts in and says to the judge that they have found new evidence. The judge says \"No new evidence can be submitted as the closing statements have begun\", and the man replies \"But this new evidence is incredible\", and the judge says something like \"I don't care if its xxxxx, closing statements have begun\".\n\nThe second episode, which I remember more clearly, is there is a robbery in a convenience store, and there is one witness, who I remember as looking like Samuel L Jackson, but his TV credits don't have anything like this in it.\n\nThe witness then frames this one white guy, who is innocent, by ID-ing him in a witness ID parade. The case goes to court, and while the witness is telling the story, somebody keeps walking in and out of the courtroom, listening to what the witness says, and then walking out and telling some detectives on the phone. The detectives are recreating the scene of the crime, when the witness, who says he was walking along the street, says \"I saw him reach under the counter and pull a gun out,\" and when they recreate it, the detectives at the scene realise he couldn't have seen under the counter from where he says he was. That's all I remember.\n\nDoes anybody know what these episodes are?\n\nThanks\n\nSo, hopefully someone remembers this tv show ---\n\nIt was on ABC around the early 2000 mark, and would have been repeated a few times. I'm pretty sure it was a miniseries, and that they're all Australian.\n\nAll I can remember is there's this girl on the run because these people are following her, and I think her Dad has gone into hiding and told her not to trust anyone. She might be looking for him during the show, but only finds him in the last episode. Now, she has this mysterious necklace/pendant from her mum/grandma(?) and we don't know why it's important till the end when we find out shes like a princess, or some long lost royal person, and the necklace is proof of this and the people who are following her were sent by the long lost family and she's the long lost heir. The only scenes I can remember are:\n\n1) She is on the beach and took off her necklace and hid it under her towel, but someone (her friend? probs not though) steals it\n\n2) Her and the obligatory boy friend get on a bus, but the bad people are also on the bus looking for her, so then they are trying to get off the bus and lose the bad people\n\n3) In the last episode, the Dad turns up again but someone handcuffs him. So all I can remember is this dude in the middle of nowhere with handcuffs on and no key to get the off.\n\nGoogle searches of 'girl on run' and 'pendant' do not work.\n\nMuch appreciative!!\n\nOk this is really going to be very vague, but this was from somewhere in the 90's, all i can remember is that the high school boy traveled to different worlds all the time, trying to get home, he kept meeting new people where ever he ended up, some started traveling with him, a girl who he met also started traveling with him, he ended up liking her, the worlds where they traveled kept changing, some are aliens, some are filled with objects that can talk, like clocks an teapots etc, its not the \"sliders\" series of jerry o'connel, i remember also, when he finally gets home, or wakes up (not sure if it was all a dream) cause the final episode everything seems normal, like nobody knew he was gone, then he goes to school, and then some boys picked on him, then the girl who was with him shows up and saves him, her name is different i think and she doesn't remember him, but he saw she had a scar that she got while they were together, but she says she got it from something normal like a bike accident or something like that, if you can help me i would be very greatful cause its making me crazy lol\n\n\"Ok this is really going to be very vague, but this was from somewhere in the 90's, all i can remember is that the high school boy traveled to different worlds all the time, trying to get home, he kept meeting new people where ever he ended up, some started traveling with him, a girl who he met also started traveling with him, he ended up liking her, the worlds where they traveled kept changing, some are aliens, some are filled with objects that can talk, like clocks an teapots etc, its not the \"sliders\" series of jerry o'connel, i remember also, when he finally gets home, or wakes up (not sure if it was all a dream) cause the final episode everything seems normal, like nobody knew he was gone, then he goes to school, and then some boys picked on him, then the girl who was with him shows up and saves him, her name is different i think and she doesn't remember him, but he saw she had a scar that she got while they were together, but she says she got it from something normal like a bike accident or something like that, if you can help me i would be very greatful cause its making me crazy lol\"\n\nSomehow the quoting thing's not working for me anymore, but in response, I said:\n\nIt sounds a lot like the plot of a book by Diana Wynne-Jones, called The Homeward Bounders. I never saw it on TV but it would have been an ideal subject, so I wouldn't be surprised if someone did it, or pinched the idea. Wikipedia has a decent synopsis.\n\nHi so this is my first time posting here. For years I've been trying to remember the name of this cartoon I used to watch. I watched it on ABC Kids (in Australia) during the early-mid 2000's. It was a 2D animated cartoon about a boy whose name I THINK is Oliver. I think he wore shirt that was khaki green. He had curly red/brown hair. I don't remember much except that when he falls asleep or goes to bed his toys become alive. I'm not sure if he's asleep or awake when they come alive. He then interacts with them and they go places(?) and interact with other people in this kid's life. The toys were pretty badass when they became alive. You could never see the parents faces. I remember this one scene from an episode where a bully from the boy's life in the alternate(?) state dropped a chocolate bar into a pool. All the kids then thought it was poop but then Oliver put more chocolate in to make the pool into a pool of chocolate milk. I know this is all very random but if there's someone out there who knows what this show is, please tell me! I've been looking for ages. Thanks in advance.\n\nI believe they were Twilight Zone episodes, but I can't seem to find them when I search.\n\nThough I am not having much luck with any searches just now.\n\nAll these are from the 80's, or there about.\n\n1 – I am sure it is a Twilight Zone episode.\n\nCOLOUR, Set near Seattle, a person's mate is going on one of those \"trips\" where they leave tech' behind and really go bush.\n\nHe isn't too happy as his friend doesn't have many details.\n\nAt the last second, he accompanies him.\n\nThey are picked up in a \"hippie van\" and there are a lot of people already in there.\n\nThe people organising it insist NO tech' goes with them, and so the person's mate hands in his music player. (Way before mobile phones)\n\nLater on he wakes up with the others but they are ALONE! He follows a track but it just ends.\n\nThen he looks at the sky and doesn't recognise the stars.\n\nThen it is revealed that they are no longer on Earth, and are on a spaceship and travelling through space.\n\n2 – This one I am not sure if it is Twilight Zone or Outer Limits.\n\nCOLOUR, As a child a person's father keeps telling him that he is keeping things for nothing. His father dies and he grows old.\n\nHe is homeless and walking down a street with his \"junk\". Someone notices this and realises the value and he is suddenly rich.\n\nKind of similar to \"Blast from the past\" but more focus on the value of things and how they can change.\n\n3 – Way in the future, a young girl (woman) wants to travel. But more like SPACE travel via teleport.\n\nHowever the catch is that she must die as the \"law\" has to be obeyed, and that is that as she will be created at the destination, she must then be destroyed/killed there.\n\nThe person controlling it explains this and she is afraid. Eventually she does go and she sees herself come back.\n\nThe \"original\" her is clean, pristine. The new one has tattoos and really different.\n\nThe person doing the teleport control is a known actor and I think he was in another famous series back in the 80's.\n\nThanks very much in advance for any useful help.\n\nThere's another one that I can't seem to remember. It aired maybe mid to late 90s, possibly early 00s. It was on ABC (I believe). I don't remember much about it, but I remember the opening scene of the first episode was a teenage girl at swimming lessons. She went home from those lessons and she had to pick up her stuff and move. For some reason I feel like it was an \"on the run\" type show, they were running/hiding from someone/something/some government/organisation? I don't really remember.\n\nThe only other thing I remember is the final scene of the show, it was at a safe house on some big hill. They'd been tracked down and there was a chase somewhere there. I think they won and I'm pretty sure it panned out to some big landscape scene of the family, hill and house.\n\nVery vague but would appreciate any help lol.\n\nI have searched and searched and searched and i feel i am going mad!!!\n\nThere used to be the tv show on in the uk ready when i just got home from school???\n\nIt was about a young boy, it was his birthday??? and the only present his gran? gives him is a spider brooch and a legacy >>> He is the last of the celtic druids???<<< i remember the title either as The Silver Web or... The Silver Spider????\n\nOnly scene i can remember is, at one point he is on his way to school/in the playground in the snow and he is getting bulied? He makes a snowball and throws it at one of the bullies... but as it leaves his hand, somthing silver gets trapped in it, hits the other boy and makes his nose bleed...\n\nAfter all this info, you would think that google would find it??? But no!!! Google thinks i am insane!!!!

He later meets a family who treat him like one of their own, but they work against the law for some reason and often use explosives. There's also an Irish policeman who is very friendly towards the main character. I remember the outro of the show was a scene of the family in fast motion gathering in the main hall, then one of them accidentally sets off another explosive, and they all comedic ally run out of the room as the explosive goes off.\n\nCan anyone help?\n\nHi all. My first time on this site. Looks interesting. I have been somewhat of a tv addict since a kid.. going back to the days of Rin Tin Tin, The Whirlybirds and Sea Hunt. I have a query. I recall watching a mystery with the plot of a young woman constantly woken in the nite by the calling of her name. Helen. She would then walk down thru the sprawling family estate towards a lake. The object was for her to throw herself in and drown so a relative could inherit. Does anyone recall this.. I would love to watch it again as this tv mystery has stayed with me for more years than I care to remember. If only I could recall the name of the show. It is not an episode of Twilight Zone, nor Hitchcock Presents or Hitchcock Hour or Karloff's Thriller. Anyone shed any lite on this?\n\nThere was a childrens (?) tv show I remember from the late 90s/early 00s that i've been trying for AGES to remember what it was. Googling has yielded no results.\n\nBasically its about a family who I think lived in England and the father works for dangerous people. He relocates the family to Sydney to get away from this dangerous cartel. A few eps in, his daughter is on the street and a police officer asks her to help find a dog (?), but she is grabbed and shoved into an ambulance and driven away.\n\nSomehow someone knows girl is kidnapped so roadblocks are set up on the sydney harbour bridge but being an ambulance they cross without issue. Girl is then held hostage in some kind of van for a week or so.\n\nAt some stage a male friend she knows is held with her, and they use a spider in the van to pretend that she has been bitten or something so they can escape.\n\nThey are later rescued by police.\n\nI cant remember too much else but if it rings a bell for anyone else I'd LOVE to know what the show was!! Thanks\n\nThis has been bugging me for a few years now, and after trying unsuccessfully elsewhere on the web, I was directed towards you fine folk! I'm trying to recall the name of a short-lived television series (potentially miniseries) that aired on NZ television (but wasn't necessarily NZ-made) during the mid-90s. The details I can recall are as follows:\n\n- The series centred around a teenage human boy who encountered an older man with some sort of interplanetary / inter-dimensional travelling ship.\n\n- The older man had a Henson-esque pet / sidekick with glowing fibre-optic hair.\n\n- Each week, the trio would travel to a new world / dimension hunting for large pieces of a puzzle-like crystal device in need of assembly.\n\n- The sidekick's hair would glow whenever a piece of the crystal puzzle was near.\n\n- At the same time, an antagonist in a robotic exo-suit was also travelling from world to world attempting to collect the same crystal pieces.\n\n- The giant twist at the end of the series was that the older man with whom the teenager was travelling was the real bad guy (bent on world domination or some-such), and the man in the exo-suit was actually trying to stop him from assembling the crystal puzzle.\n\nVague, I know, But it's the best I can do given that I was around 10 at the time it aired. I'd put the whole thing down to a fanciful memory if it wasn't for the fact that I've managed to find two other people on the internet trying (unsuccessfully) to discover the name of the same show (https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20110104214252AAjbkWd and http://forums.digitalspy.co.uk/showthread.php?t=1604471). It might have been an exclusively Australasian production, which would explain why traces of it are so scarce on the web. But I know for a fact that it aired in NZ, hence I'm turning to y'all for help!\n\nOk! I give up!\n\nI've had many sleepless night thinking about this possible ahow.\n\nSo what I remember is that it is a sci-fi show made in the late 80s early 90s. It was set in then modern times.\n\nI think the theme of this episode was interdimensional travel because it started with a man landing in a time similar to ours but obviously difference.\n\nHe lands in a world where crime does not exist because he easily lets himself into either a veterinarian clinic or some type of medical clinic. He is discovered by a Asian female in a white lab coat so she must be some kind of doctor or veterinarian.\n\nI can't remember the rest of the episode but towards the end he is asked if he is going to go see \"The game\" where citizens are sitting in a Stadium and one person is chosen completely at random and the rest of the population are allowed to beat them to death. (This is why there is no crime) ...it feels very similar to The Purge\n\nIn this case it's a teenage boy and he is chased out of the stadium by men with baseball bats.\n\nPlease help me so I can finally get some sleep\n\nI am trying to find the name of an educational show where 3 robots lived up in a space ship that orbited Earth.

I found it curious how the robots where small enough to look like toys, so people always were unaware of the presence of this ship. I remember they would use real life footage. I cannot remember anything else than 2 episodes:\n\n- The spherical ship is hit by a thunder, the energy supply is cut and the only way to save the robot in the ship is to use the emergency return lever. Here they teach about circuits.\n\n- The robot inside the spherical ship finds that the ship makes a lot of turbulence when it goes too fast. Here they teach about aerodynamics, and even use a wind tunnel to show how turbulence is generated by small tornados behind the shape of the vehicle.\n\nHope you can help me.\n\nHello, I'm looking for the series which i actually used to watch a very long time ago on tv. But I don't remember neither its name nor its characters'. All i remember is that there are 3 main characters basically.\n\nA guy – who happens to be different or chosen or whatever , a girl and some old man who is very wise and teaches this guy a lot of things to overcome and defeat something or someone in the end (i dont exactly remember). Its genre is fantasy, it's set in medieval times, i cant tell the exact year but there are swords so.. i think that'd be right. The one thing i also remember is the girls super ability. Sometimes, for example whenever she is fighting, her eyes go black and she does something to people, like controls them or leaves them unconscious or something like that.\n\nthanks in advance :)\n\nhi so I have looked all over google for this and can't find nothin\n\nso help plz\n\nit was a tv show when I was a kid so late 90's-early 00's\n\nall i can remember is a red kid robot (everyone is a robot( yes apparently they can have kids don't ask me how)) with no parents, everyone could turn into a ball to get around and the kid was looked after by a/the police officer or just the police officer knew his parents( I think) with the evil guy in the show, having/controlling a giant robot spider ( I think white legs) that he used to attack the people of the town\n\nsadly thats all, I was really young at the time so i might have my memory jumbled but I still what to watch it again if I can find it thanks\n\nHey all, I literally just made an account to ask this question- it's been driving me mad for like a year.\n\nThere was a show I used to watch in 2011 I think? Possibly earlier, I was very little. It was similar to \"a gURLs wURLd\" I think- or was on at the same time. I believe it was on ABC3 or ABC2. It involved witches, I think? I think the main group of girls had a secret cave underneath the school they went to and they made potions and things there. One episode I particularly remember was when they were in their cave and their arch-enemies came in and found them, and threatened to tell the teachers about their cave unless they let them join the club they had.\n\nI think the opening theme had bubbles in it? It's all I can remember, I was 6-10 years old.\n\nI have been looking for a while, I don't think it's \"The Worst Witch\" or \"Charmed\" or that kind of thing.\n\nAny help would be much appreciated!!!\n\nMy friend is on the hunt for a kids show he saw in around 2005! We can't find anything about it and we're desperate to find it and I was wondering if you would be able to help!\n\nSo here's details about it\n\n-it was animated\n\n-always set in a field\n\n-all the main characters were from out of space that had come to earth and turned into common objects, one was a jack in the box\n\n-one episode that was quite disturbing was there was a dead fox and one creature went into its body and lived in the fox den with the mother fox and children as the dead fox.\n\n-most likely on abc!\n\nWe would really love any help on finding this show!\n\nHello, there! I have been trying to look for this one show that I remember when I was younger. I only remember a few things that happened in a couple episodes:\n\n- One episode has one of the male characters, which I presume is a main character, finds a mermaid in a room somewhere and one thing lead to another and they swap tail/legs. The mermaid now has his legs, which I remember are gold on her and is getting all the boys attention at the school. The male character is not liking it so much. In the episode, he has to move via wheelchair. I remember him and his friend/s try to 'reverse' the effects by burning the lock of hair that the mermaid had, I also presume they stole it from her. Another thing is that the male character is scared of water/swimming. In order for the mermaid to keep the 'stolen' legs and for him to keep her tail, she decides to lock the merman into a room and flood it. His friends rescue him, of course.\n\n- The second episode I remember is when one of the male characters get a pink 'starfish' – like parasite on the back of his neck. The 'parasite' can also talk and is referred to as a female, He tries to hide it under a scarf that he constantly wears during the episode. The 'parasite' dies at the end of the episode and he proceeds to throw it out in a nearby bin, much to his dismay/sadness.\n\nSorry for the weird sounding explanations and how long it is. Another note is that this was broadcast in Australia possibly around 1999 to 2007, I really don't remember. I have tried searching for it and I have concluded that it isn't 'Round The Twist, So Weird, Wicked Science or Strange Days AT Blake Holsey High. Thanks for reading and I hope to hear back from you!\n\nHi guys I'm new to this site, hope you can help me.\n\nIt's a Japanese game show that aired on either ABC or SBS in Australia a few years ago.\n\nYou have contestants competing for points on challenges with live commentary (the host has a small picture showing his face reactions inside the screen). The contestants would all insult each other during and after the challenges, it was subbed in English.\n\nOne of the challenges was Karaoke and another challenge was running across rubber mats over a swimming pool (which often sank or they fell off) with the fastest time winning.\n\nOne of the contestants was called the Uncrowned Prince because he always came 2nd to another guy called, name starts with a K like Kanada or Kanata or something.\n\nAny Aussies or anybody good with Japanese shows?\n\nI searched google but no cigar.\n\nEdit : It's not MXC before someone mentions it but they might have aired together on the same night. One after the other etc. They are the 2 shows i remember watching. It was years ago so my memory is a bit shaky.\n\nThere a show I remember (it wasn't animated) where this girl discovers she has powers when she puts a pencil through her hand and it just goes through. Also I remember one part where she turned a tennis ball inside out. I think the people with the powers were called \"senders\" as they could speak to each other through the mind and I'm not sure if I remember this right but at some point peoples eyes would go yellow?\n\nI remember one point where some other guy gets similar or more powerful powers and telekinesis by putting a patch on his arm or something and it starts to spiral out of control\n\nI could never remember what this show was called and is probably not as good as I remember it, but would be cool to know\n\nEDIT: Found it lmao, it was called \"Life Force\"\n\nHi! Can anyone help me – it's driving me mad. Cannot remember the name of this TV series I watched years ago that featured a detective with a shaved head and violence issues who returns to his home town and gets involved in solving a murder mystery. Think it was made post 2000. He's estranged from his wife, has a red headed teen daughter. The series kicks off with a very sleazy predator in a 70s muscle car who's seduced two school girls into a outdoor sex romp in a secret swampy scrub setting – whilst filming them he convinces them to allow him to cable tie them up as part of the sex play. He then proceeds to bash them over the heads with a rock. There's someone watching in the bushes during all this. The killer leaves the bodies of the girls. The creepy guy in the bushes then goes to look at them and realises one of them is still half alive. He fondles them and then leaves them there and keeps coming back to see them – it's all very disturbing and creepy as all hell. It turns out he's an old school friend of the cop – used to be a sports star – now the billboard face of a local plumbing firm – bit of a suburban swinger ladies man type of creep – anyway – as the series progresses it's revealed he has a long history of sexual assault and murder and collects hair as souvenirs... in the end he targets the cops daughter. The name of the series is the name of the town I'm pretty sure. The opening credits feature a US suburban development surrounded by large power lines. It's a pretty haunting series and genuinely disturbing – the half finished suburban sprawl of middle America gives it an 'edge of town' kind of tension. No matter what I google – nothing it helping. It's driving me bonkers! What is the name of this show?? Help ME ???\n\nI've been trying to remember a kids tv show that's really old, probably 80's or 90's. It's live action (not animated), and is non-fiction. It teaches kids how to bake, do arts and crafts, and even explains scientific concepts. It's very short, with only a few episodes.\n\nParts I remember:\n\nTeaching how to make craft with coffee filter; folding it into a skinny triangular shape and dipping it into paint so that when unfolded there are cool patterns of circles. This scene was out on a grass field outdoors.\n\nThe baking scenes were done inside a wooden house/ kitchen.\n\nThere was a reoccurring thing with greenhouses. They would plant different plants into a large rectangular fishtanks, showing how to put soil, then depot plants, then place it in the fishtanks with rocks and stuff, then showed how to take care of it.\n\nThere was a part with a tea party of a bunch of kids around the table. It showed how to juice a lemon on a juicer, and put honey in tea using a wooden honey dipper. That was filmed on a grass, too.\n\nIt explained Newton's First Law by putting a stick on a piece of paper on the edge of a table, then pulling the paper out really fast and the stick staying upright on the table. This wasn't explained by a kid, but a middle aged man who was probably the only adult on the show.\n\nIt taught and demonstrated how air pressure works by putting a glass upside down in a bowl of water, perpendicular to the floor, and said how the water doesn't get inside the glass. It then showed putting the glass inside diagonally and the water getting in.\n\nIt showed how science made a piece of paper stick to the rim of a glass even upside down.\n\nRecently I went on a quest to track down a few things I vaguely remember watching as a young child. I honestly am not sure if these were TV shows or movies and I seemed to have a preference for obscure entertainment. They both would have been watched likely prior to 1992 but could have been much older.\n\nThe first was fully animated and featured some bugs (and possibly other small animals) that were on some type of quest which led them to a terrifying encounter with a venus fly trap or pitcher plant. I just remember a character slowly being sucked down, knowing he would be eaten in front of his friends. Its was very dramatic and heart-rending to my 4 year old self.\n\nThe other is possibly partly live action/not animated, could be a show or movie, where a young boy acquires a baby dragon that he ends up secretly caring for. The dragon was friendly but growing quickly and hard to conceal. I feel like the boy was either a prince or became royalty in some way during the film. That's all I've got. No wonder I can't find either of them.\n\nI signed up to whirlpool just to post this. Why? Well, every now and then I try to explain this tv show to someone and no one but me remembers and people think I'm mad.\n\nIn the mid 90s, maybe 1994-1996 give or take a few years (not sure if they were reruns either) my dad used to watch SBS TV and tape this show for me onto a VHS. I was a young kid and I found it fascinating but also a bit scary. It wasn't a kids show either, I don't think.\n\nThis is what I know/remember about it:\n\n- the show just consisted of 3D animated \"computer generated\" CGI scenes\n\n- some of the scenes would show a bit of a story and others didn't\n\n- most shows would show one theme for about 2 mins then change\n\n- there was no talking or anything, only constant digital synth music in the background which I think changed for each episode\n\n- each show went for about 10-15 minutes\n\n- it was on after my bed time, so, later than 7:30pm\n\n- there weren't a lot of shows\n\n- dad seemed to think that it came on at random times/days, a bit like that Soupe Opera show:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uv5lRAwXqug\n\nActually, watching this again on YT, it is quite similar to this in mood/music.\n\nThere are a lot of convoluted bits and pieces I remember, but I'll explain the one episode I remember the best. The show opened with the synth music and the camera panned around a weird CGI city. Eventually, the camera went down onto a road where a silver cheetah or something was running. The camera followed the cheetah and it ran into a library, then the cheetah disappeared and the camera just went around a library.\n\nVery strange sounding, I know, and yes, it was sort of psychedelic. The graphics themselves were typical early 90s graphics. I looked around for examples and found this site.\n\nhttp://www.vintagecomputing.com/index.php/archives/773/head-tripping-3d-art-of-the-early-1990s\n\nAny help would be appreciated. My dad was very alternative and arty and I just remember being captivated by this show and also wondering why he would tape episodes of it for me!\n\nI watched late-night TV in about 1990. I saw a \"Twilight Zone\"-type episode from an anthology series: live action, in color. This episode had a post-apocalyptic / nuclear winter theme in which a man and a woman are trapped inside a bunker or fallout shelter, wondering if it is safe to go outside yet. The story took place in about 1990 and was \"modern\" to 1990, as in it was not a \"1950's\"-type bunker. There were computer controls and I believe some sort of closed circuit camera in use. Both characters are in military attire, Army green if I remember correctly. At some point one thing leads to another and clothes start to come off. Then I remember another character appears outside the shelter and tries to communicate with those inside, and then...\n\nI feel like I've checked all of these series and come up empty, but there may be a certified expert on this board that can point me to the episode I am thinking of: \"The Hitchhiker\" – \"Freddy's Nightmares\" – \"Monsters\"\n\nEither way, thanks in advance.\n\nAnother thing I (cant) remember was something that played immediately after ABC Kids but wasn't a kids show in the afternoons in the mid 2000s.\n\nFrom what I can remember first episode started with guy in a white shirt who climbs down into this big room that I think was below water level. In the room was this strange trap thing that the guy reaches and then gets his arm stuck and can get out. The room then starts to fill with water and he drowns. Some episodes later another guy is drugged and forced into the room and killed in the same was.\n\nIt was a very weird show to my 9 year old mind and kinda scared me a bit but I would like to see it again and actually know what was going one. Come to think of it there were a few of show that played directly after ABC Kids I saw that kids really shouldn't have watched.\n\nHey all. I'm having a hard time trying to remember what this TV show was called. It used to be a 1990's kids show. All the episodes basically is of all of Paul Jennings books. I tried to search in Google Paul Jennings TV show. But nothing relevant comes up in search results. So I'd assumed this TV show is under a different title.\n\nI remember seeing this same boy is looking after someone in a house. And a huge ear tries to reach him.\n\nAnother episode is where he's looking for his dog. And a mad scientist has his dog in his laboratory. As part of luring the boy into a trap. The boy rescues his dog from this mad scientist. And is zapped by his own experiment. And starts shrinking down into some sort of sack. Until that mad scientist goes \"POOF!\".\n\nThis series is based with real people. The boy lives with parents I think in a caravan. Selling newspapers. As I remember the boy delivers newspapers on his rounds. But also has different types of adventures.\n\nbismoter writes...\n\nI think the main group of girls had a secret cave underneath the school they went to and they made potions and things there. One episode I particularly remember was when they were in their cave and their arch-enemies came in and found them, and threatened to tell the teachers about their cave unless they let them join the club they had.\n\nNever seen it, just bits and pieces and it's later than 2011, started in 2013, but could it be 'Mako: Island of Secrets' perhaps?\n\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt2548214/\n\nUujiak writes...\n\nUnfortunately it is not timewarp trio.\n\nIt's just the boy and the girl and i think theyre a bit sarcastic with each other.\n\nHi,\n\nI'm pretty sure your other one is 'Horrible Histories' – loved that show myself and I saw it as an adult. Very informative. The second last episode of season 2 (pity they didn't do more) is with Clark and Lewis and Sacagawea.\n\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0478486/\n\nIs it Peter and Pompey?\n\n\"After finding strange Latin inscriptions on a cave wall in the hills, three high school students from a north Queenland coastal town seek the help of their Latin teacher to discover their meaning.

It was about a prince who wanted to marry the princess but the princess didnt really want to. She would lie and say that if he got what she wanted they'd get married asap. She was using him instead to get stuff because she wasn't allowed to leave her tower. The princess would go, \"I want 100 blue roses each with 17 petals\", etc and the prince would go out for days looking for it and when he got it and gave it to her she would change her mind and be like, \"oh thank you! But now I want...\" And the prince goes out, gets it, and the process repeats. You get the gist, right?\n\nPlease help me find it! I want to watch it for the sake of nostalgia! It's a cartoon show may I add.\n\nI'm trying to remember an Australian documentary from the 80's (I think) or maybe early 90's. It was similar to the format of the Up series from the UK in that I think it was filmed over a period of years. It was about a group of young people from Sydney that all had issues, I remember some of the boys (maybe brothers) had been molested and run away to the Cross, then they were selling themselves at the wall in Darlinghurst in the next instalment. I particularly remember one of the girls had started sniffing glue and the film crew eventually tracked her down for the next instalment and she was living in public housing in Canberra and would hitchhike to bludge cigarettes off truckers, sometimes going all the way to Melbourne just so she could smoke. I've checked The Oasis doco and it wasn't that and I've googled everything I can remember but no luck there either. It's doing my head in so I hope someone on the forum can help!\n\nHi all, trying to find info on the following TV show I saw once while I was home sick from school during the mid-90s.\n\nA (female?) explorer is investigating the terrain of a mountain. She visits a cave and feels the walls which are dripping with a strange goo. She visits a pond that she cups her hands into and drinks from. In the end it is revealed she’s actually walking around on the surface of a giant’s body. The goo-cave was his nose and the pond was his eyeball (!).\n\nI'd guess it was Australian and on ABC – but I'm not positive. I think it was live action with cheap special effects. It wasn't animated.\n\nAny information on this would be appreciated. If anyone else remembers it I'd be interested to know. Thanks!\n\nI am trying to remember a tv show I seen 10 years ago, probably in 2000 to 2006. I don't remember the name of the tv show or the episode. Hope some one can help me with this.\n\nWhat I do remember is the setting takes place at a mall. A group of men take over the mall. There is a male teenager, who wore a tag saying he is deaf but lost it at the time of the captured. The SWAT team arrives and are standing outside the mall. The deaf teen realizes there is a camera and starts signing. One of the SWAT team notice it is ASL. They start looking for someone who can interpret. And this is all I remember. I don't remember what happens at the end. I'm guessing it was a crime tv show like Law & Order, Criminal Minds, Flashpoint, Bones, etc. So if anybody seen this tv show, please let me know what is the name of the tv show or maybe it was a movie. I really don't remember.\n\nThank you in advance.\n\nSo I couldn't leave this alone and after 3 years of trying to figure out this tv show I finally found it by putting random words in google mainly using \"crime drama show\". What a relief. Oh the tv show is called Boomtown – Haystack.\n\nOmegaVile writes...\n\nIf this thread is still going I like to add my own query.\n\nThere's this old edutainment show about animals with a short purple alien kid floating in space wearing a yellow space suit, he had a wrist computer called T-E-C or C-Mor or some other acronym.\n\nI remember the episode focusing on apes and monkeys called \"Monkeys, Monkeys, Monkeys!\".\n\nAnother thing the show had to it was they had voice overs on a lot of the animals, adding a bit of comedy to the show.\n\nIf anyone could tell me the name of this show I would be extremely gratefull.\n\nOmegaVile – Just came to check if anyone had answered my question and noticed yours. Is it \"Widget\" (aka \"Widget the World Watcher\") you're referring to? Widget was a purple alien with a wrist computer assistant (\"Mega Brain\") and often had environmentalist themes.\n\nI have a TV show I am looking for too.\n\nAustralian, I think, for kids.\n\nShort version: It had a white wizard and a black wizard which combined to become a silver wizard.\n\nMore detailed description: a girl and a boy were sitting in a circle of children in a tent on the beach. Each child was dressed differently. Another child took the boy's kite and he protested. The white wizard (the adult and leader) asked the boy who took the kite 'stepping you think it was right to take his kite?'. The boy said yes, and the case was closed.\n\nThe boy and girl stole half an orb that the wizard had and ran away with it to the castle of a black wizard. Here all the children were dressed in black robes with matching black stripes on their faces, chanting something like 'think the same, act the same, speak the same'. The boy and girl had to dress up and pretend to be one of them so they could steal the black wizard's half of the orb.\n\nThey then ran away, and met a girl on the road with a campfire who was afraid of them because she thought they had come to take her to join the black wizard.\n\nThe boy and the girl then put the two halves of the orb together and the white wizard and the black wizard are combined to become a silver wizard.\n\nAny help will be greatly appreciated!\n\nHi all.\n\nI'm trying to remember the name of a TV comedy gameshow. It was a show that always got me laughing. I don't think it was on the air long, maybe around the early 2000s. I guess it was similar to Who's Line Is It Anyways.\n\nIt involved a group of contestants and a live audience. There were open rooms facing the audience and the contestants would have to enter a particular room through a door and they'd be thrown right into the middle of a skit. From there they'd have to improvise and make sense of the situation. I can't remember if it was a competitive show or not or if the contestants ever changed.\n\nThanks guys\n\nThis is a long shot. I have had this line from a Tv show in my head all day, \"I shouldn't have forgot the pud!\"\n\nSo I believe it was from a short lived, British tv show from over 10 yrs ago. Where there are two guys and a girl and I think they were in some strange love triangle. Anyways I think the main guy from the main couple may have cheated and one of the episodes ended up with the two guys sitting at a table while the girl was angrily clattering around and when asked what was wrong, he replied \"I shouldn't have forgot the pud\" aka pudding, aka dessert. He had forgot to bring home dessert. It's just frustrating me. I don't even think I watched more than one episode.\n\niceshark99\n\nI think it's Travelers, Episode 9.\n\n\"Said mission begins with a happy married couple taking a morning jog in an empty park. When the husband stops to answer a phone call we learn that he is somehow involved in the development of an oil pipeline that would surely assist in destroying the future environment. He is confident that the project will be approved and the drilling will go forward as planned. When he hangs up the phone he quips to his wife that jogging is going to kill him. But she quickly corrects her hubbie. Jogging is not going to kill him. SHE’S going to kill him. Yup. His significant other is a traveler who has the goal of pushing her husband off a ledge so that he can fall to his death.

Having read through some of the comments it seems you guys have a great record for naming the shows. So here's mine.\n\nI have been trying to figure this one for years. From what I remember the show had a group of 3 teens. Each found a piece of a broken crystal. When the crystal pieces got close to each other they joined back together and formed one crystal. At this point a alien appeared before them wearing a helmet via some sort of protection.\n\nA few episodes later this Alien turns out to be friendly and is a female. She talks about a robot/alien male hunter that is trying to get her/the crystal.\n\nAdditional bits I remember. The space was crashed in a forest area and at one stage the female alien is shot and then encased in ice.\n\nAny ideas? Or should I be writing a novel!?!?! ????\n\nThanks\n\nHello! I'm trying to remember the name of this British children's TV show in the early 2000s.\n\nIt's sort of like a game show where a group of three children can participate in a series of tasks. The setting is in a house where a ghost reside in and there is a different ghost and a new team in every episode.\n\nThe team has to complete a few challenges in this ghost's house. I think the theme/decoration of the house changes according to the ghost. In one episode (I think it was a ghost who used to be a hair stylist), I remember there was a challenge with around 3 mannequins with clothes and accessories on it. The team was given a time limit to memorise everything on the mannequin. After that, a sheet covers the 3 sample mannequins and they had to go to another room with a lot of mannequins. The team has to choose which were the correct ones.\n\nThe better they did in the challenges, they got more 'slime' residue which the MC collects with a vacuum like hose. At the last challenge, this 'slime' will form letters shown hovering in the air. The team has to unjumble these letters to make a word. Note: some teams had missing letters as they didn't do so well in the challenges. I remember that the word in one episode was 'chicken leg' and another episode 'puppet'.\n\nThese words represents objects that were dear to the ghosts and it is also the object that can make the ghost go away from the human world. So, the children must find this object in the room hidden amongst many other objects before the time limit. If they find it, they win and the ghost will be gone.\n\nIf anyone knows this show, please let me know. Thank you!\n\nI'd like to track down a TV series I saw many years ago.\n\nIt was a series where people living in developing world countries talked about how lucky they are with what they have but from our western perspective they have very little. Each episode featured one person and they would talk about how they are so fortunate because they have x, y, and z etc. These things may have been good health, family, or something similar but not related to excessive material wealth.\n\nFor some reason I thought the name was something like \"Earthly Pleasures\" and I think the program came from a European country like Germany or France. It was aired in either in the late 90's or early 2000's on SBS or ABC.\n\nMrGB writes...\n\nOk, I recently seen an image preview for a new show (I think on NetFlix, original maybe?) and I forgot to check it out and now I can't remember what it was called.\n\nIt had an image of some guy with a \"martian\" looking head, which was bluish and he was walking in-between a couple of others, unsure if they were cops or not.\n\nIt looked interesting, but I forget the name of it, only thing I can remember is I think it was a single-word.\n\nThis was awhile ago, so I PM'ed MrGB about it, but in case anyone sees it and is wondering the same or thinks of the answer, we figured out it was the upcoming movie \"Bright\" with Will Smith and Joel Edgerton.\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bright_(film)\n\nAnyone remember a claymation show that used to be on SBS or ABC (I think) sort of as a filler between shows?\n\nIt was about animals and had no dialogue or anything, but it did have funny sound effects (eg. snails moving would have race car noises). Each episode was only a few minutes long. Sometimes it was about birds, sometimes insects, sometimes mice in a kitchen etc. Each was a self-contained story, usually set in the country side or a cottage in the country, and there was one about a caterpillar in the city.\n\nWhen I've asked elsewhere people kept pointing me to a British one that was like a 'vox pop' with the public's opinions on different topics, but animated with mostly farm animals. I know it wasn't this one as a) I strongly recall it being French (stupidly I remember that from the credits but not the name of the show), and b) it had no dialogue, as mentioned.\n\nHave been racking my brain for ages .. no luck in naming this show, hoping the collective wisdom of WP can help.\n\nBritish series from the 80s. Pretty sure it only ran for the one season.\n\nStory involves a bored(?) middle aged housewife who is looking for \"something more\" in her life and takes up car racing.\n\nIf I remember correctly the story line mainly revolves around the love-hate relationship between the housewife and a mechanic who prepares and maintains her car, a mini. I *think* he was an ex-racer who for one reason or another could no longer race. There is another character who is the nemesis of the mechanic for what reason I can't remember.\n\nNot much to go on, sorry.\n\nIs this the one?\n\nDriving Ambition\n\n\"Driving Ambition was a one season drama from the always excellent Paula Milne. A rare starring role for Rosemary Martin saw her play fed-up middle aged housewife Donna Hewitt who sets her sights on becoming a motor racing driver\"\n\nhttp://www.memorabletv.com/tv/driving-ambition-bbc-1-1984-rosemary-martin-mark-kingston/\n\nSheepski writes...\n\nBritish series from the 80s.

Movie is between 1973 and 1975\"\n\nPossibilities\n\nThe Neptune Factor 1973\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Neptune_Factor\n\nRescue of Roger Mallinson and Roger Chapman – Wikipedia\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rescue_of_Roger_Mallinson_and_Roger_Chapman\n\n\"The rescue of Roger Mallinson and Roger Chapman occurred between 29 August and 1 September, 1973 after their Vickers Oceanics' small submersible Pisces III was trapped on the seabed at a depth of 1,575 ft (480 m), 150 mi (240 km) off Ireland in the Irish Sea\"\n\nA BBC production was shown but that was in 1978\n\nTrapped Beneath The Sea 1974\n\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0072311/\n\nBased on an incident that occurred off the coast of Florida in 1973, this film tells the story of four men who find themselves trapped in a mini-submarine in the ocean depths.\n\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0071494/\n\nFer-de-Lance (1974)\n\nSnakes on board an American sub set off a chain of events that ultimately causes the boat to sink to the bottom of the ocean. The surviving crew must devise a rescue plan to free themselves and raise the sub.\n\nIs it The Telebugs?\n\n\"The Telebugs is a cartoon from the 1980s about the adventures of three robots with televisions for heads\"\n\n\"It also aired on ABC TV in Australia from 6 July 1988 to 13 December 1991 and on TVNZ 2 in New Zealand\"\n\n\"The series was also best known for its closing theme song \"I Have a Heart\" (which debuted in season 2) written by American singer, pianist and songwriter Mort Shuman\"\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAz5dy4xRs4\n\nThe I Have a Dream song is at the end\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Telebugs\n\nPterodactyl writes...\n\nHoping someone can help my sister and I track down an old kids show on ABC – one of those short shows between the main shows, sometime in the 90s? It was three robots, a red one, a yellow one, and a white one. The theme song included the lyrics \"I have a heart; together we will make your dreams come true\" (I think). Anyone?\n\nCould it be Shomuni ?\n\n\"The stories revolve around the office ladies (OL) of General Administration Section 2 (Shomu ni, or GA-2) in a large multinational company called Manpan Corporation.\n\nGA-2 is called \"the graveyard for female office ladies\", simply because it is the place where female employees are dumped should they mess up big time elsewhere. Rarely is anyone ever allowed to leave for other more purposeful departments. Jobs include replacing used toilet rolls, changing light bulbs, organizing company outings, and other menial tasks. GA-2 is located in the basement, which is in fact a disused store room\"\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shomuni\n\nzayyanhisya writes...\n\nWhen i was kid, i had watch a drama series which is about some losers workers that like to gossip. they work in a small place like a basement floor. I don't remember the name of this drama because it was a long time ago, about ten years ago. The drama is from South Korea or Japan.\n\nHi, approximately 30 years ago I watched a TV show in New Zealand that I have been trying for years to remember and locate. Unfortunately I do not know the name, and the few bits I can remember about it have never helped me when searching. Someone suggested I tried asking in this forum in case someone else knows the show from the small fragments I can recall. So here goes :-)\n\nIts probably a TV Mini-series. I'm guessing between 1988-1991. I think I may have seen it in in 1990 though I am not clear, but it would be around then. Also NZ often aired things much later than other countries.\n\nThe show is about some computer consultant investigating bank computer fraud (inside job). There is a scene where he realises a portion of computer code has been replaced by random numbers from one of those old school \"book containing random numbers and log tables etc\".\n\nThe most striking thing I can remember about the show is that every now and then there is a scene that looks like an 80s style video game with characters such as a wolf and (possibly) little red riding hood, chickens etc, moving around a maze in the \"game\". The \"game\" relates to what is going on in the show. For example as the investigation closes in you see the game animations move closer, or being eliminated. At one point there is an animation of the wolf being h"
