Chelsea Clinton will start a six-figure consulting job after she receives a master's degree from Oxford University this year, Newsweek magazine reports.

The daughter of former President Bill Clinton and Senator Hillary Clinton will work in the New York office of McKinsey & Company.

Clinton, 23, accepted the position after she reportedly turned down McKinsey's offer of US$100,000 ($178,700) a year to work at its London headquarters.

Clinton, who is studying international relations at Oxford, will be one of 5000 McKinsey consultants worldwide who research topics ranging from health care to corporate finance.
