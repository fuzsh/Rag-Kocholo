        "text": "Explore Chelsea Clinton’s financial journey and net worth of $30 million in this article. Beyond being the daughter of Bill and Hillary Clinton, Chelsea has forged her path as an author, consultant, and board member.\n\nHer involvement with organizations like McKinsey & Company and IAC, coupled with her successful children’s book series, has contributed significantly to her wealth.\n\nThis article delves into Chelsea Clinton’s various sources of income, her philanthropic endeavors, and her impact on both the corporate and literary landscapes.\n\nChelsea Clinton Net Worth and Salary\n\nChelsea Clinton, daughter of former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State/Senator Hillary Clinton, has a net worth of $30 million, combined with her husband Marc Mezvinsky, a partner at TPG.\n\nShe earned her share through roles at McKinsey & Company and serving on corporate boards like the IAC.\n\nSalary Highlights\n\nA January 2020 SEC filing disclosed that Chelsea Clinton earned $9 million in compensation from IAC, where she served on the board with Barry Diller.\n\nPreviously, she earned a $250,000 annual base salary as a board member at Expedia. Additionally, she received $600,000 from NBC during 2013 and 2014.\n\nEarly Life and Education\n\nReal Estate\n\nIn 2008, Marc and Chelsea bought a three-bedroom, 1,922-square-foot condo in central Manhattan for $4 million.\n\nThe condo, located on the tenth floor, features an open chef’s kitchen and spacious living and dining rooms under ten-foot ceilings.\n\nIn 2013, Mezvinsky and Clinton sold this condo for $4.75 million and purchased a larger, 5,000-square-foot apartment worth $10.5 million.\n\nThe new apartment, just blocks away, spans the longest city block between 26th and 27th streets in Manhattan.\n\nIt boasts luxurious, ultra-modern design and “environmentally-conscious” features, offering stunning views of Madison Square Park.\n\nProfessional Career\n\nAfter graduating from Stanford and Oxford, Clinton worked at McKinsey & Company and Avenue Capital Group.\n\nShe then co-chaired a fundraising week for the Clinton Foundation and became its vice chair. Clinton serves on the board of the School of American Ballet and on IAC’s board of directors.\n\nNBC hired Chelsea as a special correspondent in late 2011, allowing her to continue her work with the Clinton Foundation and pursue her graduate degrees.\n\nNBC renewed her contract in February 2012, which she left in late summer 2014.\n\nSince 2011, Clinton has played a prominent role at the Bill, Hillary & Chelsea Clinton Foundation, serving on its board, delivering paid speeches, and donating her earnings back to the foundation.\n\nThe Clinton Foundation focuses on improving global health, empowering women, and fostering economic growth.\n\nClinton is also an accomplished author of children’s books, including bestsellers like “She Persisted: 13 American Women Who Changed the World.”\n\nShe is currently working on an Olympic-themed addition to her “She Persisted” series, highlighting women in sports.\n\nIn 2020, Clinton announced plans to launch Metrodora Ventures, a venture capital firm focused on healthcare startups.\n\nShe aims to invest in innovative projects like Poppy Seed Health, a pregnancy support app.\n\nInvolvement in Hillary Clinton Presidential Campaigns\n\nIn December 2007, Chelsea Clinton began campaigning in Iowa to support her mother’s bid for the Democratic presidential nomination.\n\nShe toured college campuses nationwide, speaking at 100 colleges over five months. Despite her efforts, Hillary Clinton lost the nomination to Barack Obama in the 2008 race.\n\nChelsea continued her active involvement in her mother’s 2016 presidential campaign, appearing at over 200 public events across the country.\n\nIn July 2016, she delivered a personal and emotional tribute to her mother at the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia, highlighting her upbringing and her mother’s dedication to issues and public service.\n\nPersonal Life\n\nIn 2010, Chelsea Clinton married investment banker Marc Mezvinsky.\n\nThe Clintons and Mezvinsky families were friends in the 1990s, and their children met at a Democratic political retreat in Hilton Head Island, South Carolina.\n\nThe couple got engaged over Thanksgiving weekend in 2009. After their honeymoon, they settled in New York City’s Gramercy Park neighborhood.\n\nThey married in an interfaith ceremony in Rhinebeck, New York, with the reception at Astor Courts, Kathleen Hammer’s estate, overlooking the Hudson River.\n\nOn April 17, 2014, Chelsea announced at a New York forum that she and Marc were expecting their first child.\n\nTheir daughter, Charlotte, was born on September 26, 2014. Chelsea and Marc’s son, Aidan, followed on June 18, 2016. Their third child, Jasper, was born on July 22, 2019."
