        "text": "When Chelsea Clinton was headhunted for a £40,000 first job at management consultants McKinsey & Company earlier this week, there were a few raised eyebrows and rather more snarlingly envious comments. What does that gawky brat have that others don't? How could a 22-year-old woman with no business experience justify such a lavish per annum wedge? Would her masters degree in international relations from Oxford and a history BA from Stanford really help one of McKinsey's current clients, say, the steel group Corus, which is poised to undertake a strategic review after a 20% share plummet that followed a planned merger with a Brazilian outfit? Are you sure? Did she only get the job on the back of daddy's old job and mommy's highly regarded intellectual capabilities?\n\nThese questions, of course, would not be posed by someone who had been converted to the McKinsey business ethos, still less its startlingly successful recruitment parameters. The latter were set out by Marvin Bower who set up the firm in New York in 1939, and in so doing established consulting as a mainstay of the business, making it something rather more sophisticated than time-and-motion studies. When Bower set up the firm, \"management engineering\", as it was then known, was a crude activity focused on factory-floor efficiency. Bower turned consultancy from a business into a profession, and established a global firm with annual revenue of $3.4bn (£2.1bn).\n\nBower, who died last month aged 99, argued that, while other management consultancies preferred to employ, for example, former steel industry managers to help with the restructuring of steel groups, people without a specialised background might be more useful since they would bring no baggage to the task. It was blue sky thinking avant la lettre . \"I respect intelligence as much as, if not more than, practical experience,\" he said. He valued \"outstanding character, intellect, responsibility, initiative and imagination\". Bright people who didn't know their nuts from their bolts might yet still be just the people who could bring analytical skills from their academic studies to bear on corporate crises.\n\nMcKinsey alumni include such titans of capitalism as the director-general of the CBI, Digby Jones, the chairman of the London Stock Exchange, Don Cruickshank, the head of the Financial Services Authority (and soon to be London School of Economics director) Sir Howard Davies, Tory MPs William Hague and Archie Norman, All Blacks rugby captain-turned-antipodean-business-guru David Kirk, as well as the core of Tony Blair's \"blue sky\" policy unit. It also includes Jeff Skilling, the former chief executive of Enron, but let's not spoil the story.\n\nBut what does a management consultancy actually do? \"Often what McKinsey has been about is saying the unsayable to chief executives,\" says one industry expert. \"This is especially clear with conglomerates like GE where McKinsey would go through 200 subsidiaries saying 'You want to close that down', 'Strip the assets on that' and so on. The idea is to help companies improve their strategies and operations.\" And profitability? \"That goes without saying.\"\n\n\"In the 80s the academic rigour of the MBAs, especially from Harvard Business School, was harnessed by consultancies like McKinsey. Now people like Chelsea don't need to know anything about business at the outset - PC skills and her intellectual abilities and character will be the most important things.\"\n\nClearly, McKinsey & Company expects to find these qualities in a young woman who, until recently, was derided for her ungainly looks, ill-advised ringlets and incessant whining about how tough it was being an American abroad in the post-September 11 global milieu. Chelsea, who turns 23 next week, is now deemed the finished article with her new straightened hairstyle, social outings at Donatella's couture shows in Paris and Elton's balls somewhere equally posh, not to mention her new-found love for Oxford, brought on in considerable measure no doubt by her romantic relationship with Ian Klaus, the 22-year-old Rhodes scholar.\n\nThe most important element in the Chelsea Clinton makeover is her new vocational fervour. She now has the right stuff to work for McKinsey. She spent last summer as an intern at the World Health Organisation in Geneva, where colleagues reportedly found her \"sensational\". \"She has presence and confidence that comes from experience,\" says Jon Liden, her boss at the WHO. \"Yet she has absolutely no prima-donna tendencies. She does her work and engages everyone in a very serious and respectful manner. It's extremely heartening to see.\" Last month she accompanied her father to Switzerland to hear his address to a world economic forum on health issues, to specialise in health-care management.\n\nSuch specialism is in the future. For the next few years at McKinsey's New York offices, she will be doing grunt work. \"She'll be a business analyst doing a lot of quantitative analysis legwork and learning the very particular McKinsey ethos,\" says Archie Norman, Conservative MP and ex-Asda supremo, who is one of Britain's leading McKinsey almuni. \"It's a great start for someone who wants to get a feel for business. She'll be surrounded by MBAs who are very smart, very committed and working in small teams dedicated to a single client. She'll be working with people who think that they're working for the best company in the world, and that's not a bad thing to have in terms of confidence and self belief.\"\n\nBut Norman points out that this confidence can get rattled quickly by McKinsey's so-called \"up or out policy\". \"If, after five or six years, you haven't made partner, you're out. You can't just be treading water in a post - you have to keep progressing up the career ladder. I made partner after five years and stayed for eight. I think I ultimately left because I wanted to be a line manager rather than a mere consultant - I knew that there would always be one more meeting than the one I attended while I worked at McKinsey, and that would be the meeting where the business decisions were made.\"\n\nNorman reckons that about five-sixths of McKinsey employees leave as a result of this \"up- or-out\" policy. But that hardly ends their association with the firm. Rather, they become part of a self-supporting global network of McKinsey alumni who attend meetings and bask in the career glow that comes from having the firm's name on one's CV. It's akin to Catholicism - you can leave it, but it will never leave you.\n\n\"It's rather like - I was going to say a church but that's not sufficiently commercial,\" says Norman. \"But it is a very moral firm that doesn't try to exploit clients for profit. They'll always charge £1,000 a day even if you're working 24 hours rather than seven. They sometimes don't charge at all.\" But there is the aura of a cult or masonic organisation, with its deliberately collegiate argot. A project is called a study and an outside meeting a retreat.\n\nThis was the approach devised by Bower, who relished developing searching examinations of each client companies' problems and telling managements that they had got things badly wrong. It has proved to be the blueprint for the development of management consultancy in the second half of the 20th century, but not without upsetting some. On one occasion, at the end of a detailed presentation to a client company, Bower bawled at the chief executive: \"The real problem with this company, Mr Little, is you.\" The assignment was terminated, but Bower was untroubled. Through such well-judged confrontations McKinsey developed a reputation for hard-headed analysis and telling it like it is. Today, McKinsey & Company's clients include 100 of the top 150 companies worldwide. It has also advised the Bank of England, the Roman Catholic Church in the US and the German government after the fall of the Berlin Wall.\n\nMore than 80% of its work is with previous clients. Among things McKinsey stands for is consistency of presentation. Until the early 1960s, that meant all McKinsey men were expected to wear hats because their chief executive clients did so. When Bower realised fashion had changed and turned up for work bare-headed one day, colleagues reacted warily. \"Should we all give up our hats?\" asked one. \"I'd wait six weeks,\" a partner replied. \"It may be a trap.\"\n\nThe hats have now gone, but much of the rest of the collegiate ethos remains. \"They do all look similar, well turned out,\" says an industry insider. \"And they all talk the same and think similarly. Partly that's because in Britain they've been head-hunting middle-class Oxbridge white men for years. Now they recruit middle-class white Oxbridge women too. But one thing about McKinsey is that they aren't dumb. They may well be appointing Chelsea in part because her dad happened to be president of the US - that's good marketing. But they won't be hiring somebody they don't think is brilliant. That would be bad business.\""
