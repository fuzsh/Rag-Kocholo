        "text": "Reflecting on my first Davos World Economic Forum experience with gratitude. At the inaugural Health@Davos event powered by Northwell Health I was a panelist discussing the intersection of health technology and health equity with Megan Greenfield, Ph.D. Smriti Kirubanandan a.k.a Simi MS,MPH,CN Mary Carbajal and David Walcott. I was proud to share the innovative work that Zenobia Brown MD, MPH and Northwell is doing using a Gen #AI Chatbot to address the disparaging statistics of black birthing mothers in America. As much as I think organizations play a role in helping communities to achieve health equity, I believe we, as individuals, can also play a big role. Here are 3 ways I think we can contribute to health equity at the individual level: 1. Education and advocacy- individuals can educate themselves and the public about implicit bias, health disparities, and the systemic barriers that prevent people from achieving health and well-being. By raising awareness, individuals can advocate for changes in policies and systems that create these barriers. They can support policies and programs that aim to reduce health disparities, improve access to care, promote equity in the workplace, and build social networks within their communities to help individuals cope with stress and improve their overall well-being. 2. Volunteer time and skills with organizations that provide healthcare services, food, shelter, and other basic resources to underserved populations. 3. Be kind, caring, and empathetic to build trust in your community to pull people in instead of pushing them away. #wef #healthequity #healthtechnology Eric Cio√® Pe√±a Shari Jardine, MPH, MA Dr. Chethan Sathya MD MSCE Joe Leggio Craig Spencer MD MPH Margaret Crotty\n\nBack at my desk after an incredible week at Davos, I am filled with hope and urgency to work even harder for a better future. The central theme of this year's World Economic Forum was Rebuilding Trust. Trust in clinical development and novel technologies finally designed also for women -half of the world population- is paramount. A relief to see the global agenda shine a spotlight on the Female Health Gap and Brain and Mental Health. From preclinical to clinical science and the integration of digital technologies, the momentum in these crucial areas is building. A highlight was the successful launch of the Kearney Open Letter, urging to redesign healthcare with women in mind where we have been cosignatory. The Women's Brain Project's impactful work, particularly in the realm of sex and gender differences in brain and mental health, was showcased as part of the #DAC Brain Health Impact Conversation at #WEF24. Here below in a unique conversation with Shannon Cohn and Richard Lui advocating for a more inclusive medicine. https://lnkd.in/epsMNmsS Moreover, the emphasis at WEF on #preventionmedicine, #longevity practices, and #traditionalmedicine as potential solutions to certain psychiatric conditions is a promising avenue. Integrating these approaches into the broader healthcare landscape requires collaboration, research, philanthropy and a holistic understanding of individual needs. Thanks to the leaders in the room: George Vradenburg, Vas Narasimhan, Anna Erat (MD, PhD, IDP INSEAD), Paula Bellostas Muguerza, Stephanie Sassman, Cara Altimus, Oriana Kraft. @Peter Falk, Drew Holzapfel, Peter Varnum, Davor Kosanic, Philippe Reich, Pascal Joncour, Daniel Koppelkamm, CFA Alessandro Dini, Rajiv Ahuja, JD, Dr Mandeep Rai and all other thousands I met... or might have missed.

For example, participants in one study who exhibited high curiosity improved their memory recall by 30%! In fact, curiosity is something of a superpower. Curiosity stimulates neurological changes that enhance memory and learning. Curiosity inspires originality, innovation, and creativity. Higher levels of curiosity are also associated with: ‚¨ÜÔ∏è Job satisfaction ‚¨ÜÔ∏è Social relationships with colleagues ‚¨áÔ∏è Feelings of burnout (References in the comments). I‚Äôm grateful for having my curiosity piqued for an entire day at yesterday‚Äôs Disrupt Health Tech conference, supported by WellFounded and the Founders Forum Group. It‚Äôs got me thinking about a wide range of topics: -How (Gen) AI could save doctors hours each day. -Precision oncology defying conventional diagnoses. -Radical new medical robots that can tunnel through brains. -How to survive and thrive in the extreme environments of today's workplace. I was also privileged to be nominated for a ‚ÄòThought Leader‚Äô WellFounded award. Congratulations to the winners! Thanks to WellFounded, the Founders Forum Group, and Havas Lynx for hosting us. ‚ùìWhat are you curious to learn more about this week? #health #wellbeing #performance ------ I'm James, a speaker & scientist who equips knowledge workers with science-based tools to improve their wellbeing & performance.

Here are some key resources for learning more: Panel description: https://lnkd.in/e6XZjGb5 The team I lead Robert Wood Johnson Foundation at is called Pioneering Ideas for an Equitable Future: https://lnkd.in/e6h3EceG. We make grants to understand how emerging trends will impact Health Equity in the future, and fund experiments to accelerate progress or mitigate harms from these trends. One of our favorite ways to see what new signals are bubbling up is to hold what we call a Hunch Jam. Learn more about how in this recent piece I wrote for Fast Company: https://lnkd.in/ebKe7ZBE I‚Äôll be joined on the panel by our two previous futurists in residence, Jessica Clark, and Trista Harris. Check out this conversation they had about the role for The Funders Network: https://lnkd.in/erqtA4jb Jessica also reflects on time as futurist with the Foundation, and shares many tools and tips for building what she calls a ‚Äúhealthy relationship to the future‚Äù: https://lnkd.in/ep77mW6c #SXSW #HealthEquity #SXSW2024\n\nI am honoured to have represented the Novartis Foundation and our local partners at this year's World Health Assembly. We leverage data, technology, and AI to spearhead a whole-of-city approach. We do this by tackling the world's most pressing health challenges: inequities in health and cardiovascular disease. *Key Reflections* 1 We urgently need to address the underrepresentation and underfunding of cardiovascular and cardiometabolic diseases in global health. Broaden your view to include determinants of health for a greater impact, ROI. Not in the business of health? Think again. 2. Use your privileged position at the decisionmaking table to represent those without the opportunity to have a seat and share their story. Be resolute. Stacked against is the heavy allostatic load of nearly every sector entrenched in systemic barriers built into our governance systems. 3. Recognize the interconnectedness of health and climate challenges. Coalitions spanning the spectrum of sectors should be built for sustainable meaningful impact. Our research from AI4HealthyCities NYC chapter clearly shows SDOH matter. You can incorporate SDOH to better deploy interventions and design a precision population health roadmap to make the greatest impact possible for the largest number of people. 4. Unlock strategic partnerships by embracing humility, authenticity and fostering collaboration founded on inherent values (kindness, respect and honesty is not second to innovation). Communicate those values often. Join us in the transformative journey towards better precision in designing population health roadmaps for a healthier future and resilient healthcare systems.

A great round up on the latter from Andr√© Labadie. Unsurprisingly AI dominated the conversation and its evolution this year from the prodigal child to the grumpy teenager, how it really does help drive efficiency and can be a smart aid, but is it really up to those big tasks? Perhaps people won't make as much money with it as they thought, but some stand to lose a lot. One thing is for certain, it should be a year for regulation. Other trends we're likely to see more of include health technology, the opportunity in reproductive health in particular, and how to make the best of the talent and invention coming from UK universities. And the watch outs. In light of the ongoing Post Office scandal and with elections coming up in many countries this year, what can we believe? We are raising a generation who do not believe anything. What does that mean for us as communicators? I love events like this to help me think about stories and ideas for the year ahead, but also to catch up with old friends. A big thanks to Will Campbell and Brands2Life for inviting me and a real treat to catch up with old colleagues and clients Laura Furness, Charmaine Chan, Henrietta Mackenzie, Jamie Whyte and Cherry Gray, and see just how small the world is.\n\nDigital health without behavioural science simply doesn't hit the mark. By integrating behavioural science, we can assist people in achieving their health objectives and reshaping their health habits. Technology can serve as a means to provide timely interventions, and behavioural science illustrates how to carry this out with precision. ‚Üí üîé Your phone can remind you to exercise or give you a gentle push if you forget. ‚Üí üîé It can let your friends know if you decide not to go to the gym, if you're okay with that. ‚Üí üîé Your device can even apply some consequences if you don't meet your health goals. ‚Üí üîé It can track how you're doing, and this information can help create a better plan for losing weight in the future. The true potential lies in this perfect intersection where behavioural science and technology come together. #behaviouralscience #digitalhealth #healthtech"
