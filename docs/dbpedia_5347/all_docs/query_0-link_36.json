After graduation, she began working as the Assistant Vice-Provost for the Global Network University of New York University, focusing on international recruitment strategies. In January 2012, Clinton helped launch the Of Many Institute for Multi-faith Leadership, which concentrates on cultivating cross-cultural leadership experiences with students of different faiths. Later that year, Clinton was awarded by the Temple of Understanding for her work in advancing a new model of integrating interfaith and cross-cultural education into campus life.\n\nIn November 2011, Conference Speaker Chelsea Clinton began working as a special correspondent for NBC.
