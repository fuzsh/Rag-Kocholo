        "text": "Chelsea Clinton, the 29-year-old daughter of former President Bill Clinton and Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, is engaged to her longtime boyfriend, Marc Mezvinsky, Mr. Clinton’s office said Monday.\n\nMs. Clinton and Mr. Mezvinsky sent an e-mail message to friends and family on Friday announcing their engagement. “We’re sorry for the mass e-mail,” they wrote, “but we wanted to wish everyone a belated Happy Thanksgiving! We also wanted to share that we are engaged! We didn’t get married this past summer despite the stories to the contrary, but we are looking toward next summer and hope you all will be there to celebrate with us. Happy Holidays! Chelsea & Marc.”\n\nThe engagement, reported Monday morning by ABC News, will no doubt set off a crush of tabloid speculation about when and where the wedding will take place. Many media outlets, including The Boston Globe, The New York Daily News and The Washington Post, got so far ahead of the curve that they headlined unfounded speculation that Ms. Clinton and Mr. Mezvinsky were getting married on Martha’s Vineyard last summer.\n\nMs. Clinton and Mr. Mezvinsky were good friends in high school and became romantically involved years later. Ms. Clinton, who formerly worked at McKinsey & Company, the consulting firm, enrolled in graduate school after last year’s presidential campaign to study public health at Columbia University.\n\nMr. Mezvinsky, 31, a former Goldman Sachs investment banker now at 3G Capital Management, is the son of two former Democratic members of Congress. His father, Edward Mezvinsky of Iowa, served from 1973 to 1977 and was later convicted of defrauding investors and sentenced to nearly seven years in prison; he was released last year. His mother, Marjorie Margolies-Mezvinsky of Pennsylvania, served from 1993 to 1995, losing a re-election bid after voting for President Clinton’s budget program."
