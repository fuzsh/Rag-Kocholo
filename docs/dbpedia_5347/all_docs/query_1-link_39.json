        "text": "Last week, publications across the world – from the Daily Mail to the Washington Post – raced first to cover Chelsea Clinton's declaration to US business magazine Fast Company that she would, in certain circumstances, consider running for public office, and then her announcement that she and her husband Marc Mazvinsky are expecting their first child.\n\nThe former is not really news; she has said this many times before, to many interviewers, yet each time she articulates her openness to run – always using exactly the same carefully prepared language – press reaction is huge, particularly in the US, where obsessional interest in all things Clinton mirrors coverage of the royal family here in the UK.\n\nAfter three decades of shirking press attention, Clinton seems to be everywhere. Now 34, she recently told interviewers that she seeks to lead what she describes as a \"purposely public life\". Last week, Of Many, a documentary about the friendship between a rabbi and imam on which she was executive producer, premiered at the Tribeca film festival. She bounced between the red carpet and her office at the Clinton Foundation where she is vice chair, between chatshows and her duties chairing the multifaith leadership centre that she founded at NYU. Other days, she's teaching classes in public health at Columbia University or filing her reports as a special correspondent at NBC News. Still she remains largely unknowable, despite the fact that wherever she goes the press wants to follow.\n\nWalking through the Arizona State University campus in March – I am here to see Clinton speak at the annual Clinton Global Initiative University (CGIU) event – past clusters of students in flip-flops and ill-fitting cutoffs, a contrast presents itself. When the then first daughter stepped out as a student on to the Stanford campus, from the cool darkness of a motorcade, she had 250 journalists trailing behind her. She rarely left her bulletproof dorm room without full makeup, ready to be photographed and scrutinised on her way to the library, with a phalanx of secret service lumbering beside her, dressed in student drag.\n\nClinton came of age in such incongruous cloisters, pitied or pilloried (or both) on a very public stage. She subsequently retreated so definitively into privacy that on the campaign trail with her mother in 2008, she even refused to answer a question from a fourth grade kid reporter in Cedar Rapids, Michigan. \"I'm sorry, I don't talk to the press and that applies to you, unfortunately,\" she primly demurred.\n\nThese days, she finds herself constantly fielding questions not just about whether her mother will run for office but if she will, too. \"Very few days go by when people don't ask me,\" she told Jimmy Fallon on his late-night chatshow last month. This prompted the Washington Post to republish its story from several months back speculating about whether she'd campaign for a seat in Congress, on the New York city council or various high offices in New York state. (The insiders I've polled quickly dismiss these possibilities.) At the end of 2013, there had been speculation in the British press that she might run her mother's presidential campaign; tea leaves that yielded nothing but hot water. Rumours buzzed earlier this year about how she might stand for a congressional seat on Long Island, but nothing came of that either. The assumption among professional Clinton-watchers was that the seat was too small a job for the scion of the closest thing the US has to royalty.\n\nThe three Clintons have invited 1,200 student \"change-makers\" from around the world to the Arizona campus. This annual university conference is a small part of what the Clinton Foundation does, but Chelsea's press secretary says she considers it one of the most important: a weekend of seminars and panel discussions. The foundation is a big NGO focusing on global health, climate change, development in Africa and Haiti and women's progress worldwide, with the sort of funding and partnerships you'd expect only from those with the Clintons' reach. The Global Initiative, which Bill Clinton founded in 2005, operates as an arm of the foundation, devoted to discussing problem-solving, and, as Bill and his press materials like to say, turning \"ideas into action\".\n\nOutside Arizona's Gammage Auditorium, a round terracotta hall that was Frank Lloyd Wright's final public commission, the student participants are upbeat, anxious and gawky, identified by their lanyards, freshly ironed blouses and ill-fitting suits. And they all have the same thing to say about Chelsea Clinton: \"She's awesome.\" No doubt they mean it: as the millennial vice chair of the Clinton Foundation, she is leading crucial development and aid work around the world. Some elaborate that she's \"so smart\", that she's \"making such a difference\" – both evidently true. But getting any deeper sense of her is not helped by my being scolded and shooed off by the press handlers swarming the premises every time I try to engage with the students. I'm identifiable instantly by the glaring yellow press card I've been instructed to wear at all times around my neck, easily visible from 100 yards. Reporters here are led by a minder from the press centre into a backdoor of the auditorium, down a specific marked row, far from students, and shepherded back out again. This, at least for the weekend, is Clinton Country.\n\nChelsea's press secretary initially granted me an interview with her months ago, but as my deadline approached he told me that she was not, after all, available. Journalists and pundits who have followed Chelsea and her family for years shrink from my inquiries, a few willing to go on record only with quotes about their admiration for Hillary. To violate the protected code around Chelsea, for those who actually know her or have covered her, who actually have more than a distant opinion to share, is to risk exclusion from the potential next administration.\n\nLloyd Grove, a reporter who has covered the Clintons on and off for two decades, has commented before on \"a sort of Chelsea omerta… a cloud of non-disclosure\". At Stanford, he has pointed out, a columnist for the school paper was fired for daring to write about her. In the press row of the auditorium, we talk about how little we know about her – then we all wonder if there's actually anything much to know.\n\nCase in point: at the CGIU one evening, chatshow host Jimmy Kimmel takes the stage with the Clintons. \"I can't imagine the three of you doing anything frivolous,\" he says. It's a scripted opportunity. And what we get are the revelations that Hillary occasionally watches decorating shows. Chelsea admits to watching the sequel to 300 with her husband recently. \"It's important to have humour.\" They like to take walks and do jigsaw puzzles. \"Silly things,\" they insist. Jigsaw puzzles.\n\nOf course, Chelsea came of age in the public eye as she was being shaded from it. When she was three, her father was elected governor of Arkansas. She lived out her spectacularly ungainly tween and teen years in the White House. The public horror of puberty—the skin, the hair, the features growing at different rates, the awful not-a-girl-not-yet-a-woman fashion choices – resonated with many of us and we still guard her for it. \"Leave Chelsea alone\" is a comment left after almost every article one reads about her online. Within her first year in Washington, the conservative talkshow host Rush Limbaugh cracked to the camera: \"You may know that the Clintons have a cat, Socks, in the White House. They also have a dog.\" Then there was a cut to a picture of the 12-year-old girl at her apex of crushing awkwardness.\n\nShe spent her schooldays at the prestigious and expensive Sidwell Friends school and reckoning with her father's impeachment for his affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky. (Seeing the three Clintons on stage at CGIU, it's hard not to think of the picture, the first after the revelations broke, of the family walking across the south lawn, Chelsea grasping her parents' hands like a bridge connecting them.) We know from Hillary's memoir that Chelsea was involved in the conversation about how the president would admit his affair to the world.\n\nNo wonder then that Clinton escaped to Stanford, the furthest top-ranking college from Washington, and even further to Oxford afterwards for her master's degree. No wonder she ran from her parents' model of public service deep into the private sector, where she first joined McKinsey, the consulting company, and then moved on to work as an investment analyst at a hedge fund. In 2010, under a no-fly zone in Rhinebeck, New York, she married a guy she knew from her high school days, Marc Mezvinsky, who is the son of scandal-plagued elected officials himself. Both of Chelsea's in-laws are former members of Congress; her father-in-law was jailed for swindling cash from investors. The couple recently traded up - perhaps in anticipation of starting a family - to a $10.5m Manhattan apartment with four bedrooms, a home office and a den, where they live with their dog, Soren.\n\nOne wonders if Chelsea might actually be happiest crunching numbers – as she did at her hedge fund – behind the scenes at the Clinton Foundation, rather than playing political protagonist. \"It's frustrating as a kid to realise you care about what your parents care about,\" she says on stage at CGIU. \"I tried to care about things like money. I just didn't. My metric of success is the same as theirs.\"\n\nSome of the press corps at CGIU grumble that her parents pushed her into her leadership role at the foundation, but I don't buy it. Her handle on each issue, from discussion of on-the-ground NGO fragmentation to the, yes, \"metrics\", of each project she helps support, is detailed, expansive and anything but faked. Katie Smith Milway from nonprofit consultancy firm Bridgespan, a member of the panel she has convened here, tells me she was invited to participate after Clinton read one of her papers in an academic journal. This is no scion's vanity project, nor is she a well-meaning figurehead: she's someone who chooses to read Stanford Social Innovation Review.\n\nThis morning, Clinton stands behind a podium, her perfect blow-dry – the corrective to all those years of photographed frizzy humiliation – gleaming under the bright lights. She introduces the panel she is about to moderate. She talks about the post-earthquake devastation in Haiti, about the unsanitary conditions, details the higher risk of sexual assault in its aftermath. Her recall for statistics is stunning. But what's also notable is an unsettling flatness of tone to the laundry list of horrors. I notice that a Siberian Fulbright student who remarked on Chelsea's \"awesomeness\" is scrolling through her Facebook feed within minutes.\n\nThe panel has convened for a discussion entitled \"Coming in second, scaling what works\" – perhaps the least Clintonian concept one can imagine – about pragmatism. NGO leaders talk about not always going out on your own, about the importance of developing partnerships with organisations that have already figured out solutions instead of inventing one's own. \"What is our ultimate metric of success?\" Chelsea asks, repeating that data-wonky word that she circles back to repeatedly on stage and in every interview I've found. \"Should we be joining a movement? Shepherding a movement? Or leading a movement?\" That, indeed, is the question many people have been asking – about Clinton herself.\n\nLater that day, Bill Clinton strides on to the same stage in a black polo shirt and blazer and commences to lecture the hall on national debt and tax policy. It's hardly the topic he's billed to discuss, but he can't help but play professor to whatever presents itself in his nimble mind. The students are entirely in his thrall, making notes in bullet points. It's worth emphasising that he enraptured these students while discussing tax policy.\n\nThis is how we ended up here, with the Clintons replacing the Kennedys as the preeminent American dynasty. This inarguable charisma, this unsinkable leadership, this intellectual agility, this drive to shape hearts and minds, policy and diplomacy. All this married to Hillary's pragmatism, focus and steadfastness. At CGIU that evening, Chelsea tells the crowd that at dinner every night in the kitchen she was expected to present her opinions and defend them. This began, she says, age four. Around the time she started reading the newspaper.\n\nThe flagship enterprise of Chelsea's new public presence has been her special correspondent position at NBC News. Her team mandated that her work there would be to cover \"only good news, no politics\". In truth, it's a stretch to call it journalism. She has presided over a series of do-gooder stories, such as one about a programme in New Mexico where cash-strapped families eat a provided dinner in a school gym while doing homework together. There may be a story there, but in her \"only good news\" hands, it's a puff piece.\n\nNot that a designer profile demands Frost/Nixon tension, but the segment with designer Stella McCartney reads as carefully calibrated public relations.\n\n\"I've been aware my entire life of the benefits and challenges of having parents in the public eye,\" says Special Correspondent Clinton.\n\n\"Should we get a drink after this? For a week? Just talk about it?\" gushes McCartney. \"Let's have therapy together. I can help you, you can help me.\"\n\n\"Yes, let's have therapy together,\" replies Clinton, a wooden counterpart to her breathless subject.\n\n\"I couldn't even answer that question to you,\" says McCartney. \"I feel like we just need to look in each other's eyes and we're done.\"\n\nA critic at the Baltimore Sun devoted several columns to his claim that Clinton was so abominable as a reporter that her hiring and continued presence on screen constituted a \"journalistically bankrupt decision by NBC News\". New York Magazine ran the headline: \"Chelsea Clinton at NBC: When Nepotism Goes Wrong\"; The Week rounded up the \"5 reasons Chelsea Clinton is bombing at NBC News\". Her chief of staff seemed to think that asserting Clinton's desire to be a journalist is what would make the public think she was a good one. \"In a way, I think we failed her,\" she told Vogue, \"because we didn't put out to the world that Chelsea Clinton didn't wake up one day and say, I want to be a journalist. She woke up over a series of days, months and years and said, I want to use my voice to tell other people's stories.\"\n\nStill, her stint late last year on Newshour, a radio show from the BBC World Service, was very different from Clinton's televised flackery. On radio, she was a brilliant, articulate woman exposing stories about maternal health and the global ivory trade – full of ideas and information. As part of the show's 100 Women series, she produced an hour of compelling programming, and sat down for an interview with host Razia Iqbal that revealed her to be an informed and committed advocate for progress. In her nascent journalism career, Chelsea has clearly demonstrated in which form her talents lie. In other words, the one that requires less flash, less direct engagement, frankly, less charisma.\n\nDuring Clinton's \"Coming in Second\" panel in Arizona, someone asks a question via Twitter about what the panellists have learned from past failures. Every person on stage replies but Clinton herself. (\"She could have talked about failing to score super-delegates for her mother in 2008,\" a hardened reporter quips.) It's one of many opportunities at the conference for Clinton to engage, to offer perspective, to share her story on her terms. To be, dare I say, purposefully public. Instead, she repeats the same questions verbatim to each speaker, never following up, only once entering the conversation to interject: giving an example of how Coca-Cola employees successfully pushed the company to go water neutral.\n\nShe maintains distance. She all but disappears. It's this sort of performance that has led commentators such as the Washington Post's Hank Stuever to wonder if \"this woman is one of the most boring … of her era\". In a New Republic article dissecting her robotic public personality, Noreen Malone described her simply as \"exceedingly, eyes-glazing-over-ly, admirably dull\".\n\nThe next morning, the students are bussed out to a community garden to plant vegetables for the annual CGIU \"day of service\". Journalists are cordoned off in a pen, as a security measure, we are told, while the students roam freely. In a T-shirt and sunglasses, Clinton tries to rally the crowd. I'm aching to grab a hold of some aspect of her, connect in some way. \"This is a crowd that really likes enthusiasm,\" she says at one point, attempting to muster some enthusiasm in her own voice as the crowd whoops.\n\nAt Hillary's confirmation hearing for secretary of state, her daughter sat behind her, where the secretary's wife would usually sit. Chelsea claimed that same allotted space, standing by her mother's side, after she was confirmed. With Hillary as president, her daughter might retain that role by her side as first lady, focusing on global health, committing her remarkable mind and executive capabilities to change-making from one of the highest positions of unelected leadership.\n\nRecently, Piers Morgan asked Bill Clinton who would make a better president – Hillary or Chelsea. It's a question he'd clearly been preparing to answer. \"Day after tomorrow, my wife, because she's had more experience. Over the long run, Chelsea. She knows more than we do about everything.\" Knowledge, sure. But electability is another metric.\n\nAt CGIU, Bill suggests the problem with kids today is they don't run for office. Passionately, sternly, like a parent scolding a child, he tells the crowd that one must seize politics and act. \"It doesn't amount to a hill of beans if you sit on the sidelines,\" he lectures. \"We have to be on the field and playing. That,\" he says, \"is the ultimate lesson I've learned in an incredibly long life.\"\n\nThis is Bill's sermon on the mount. It is the Clinton family faith. And, for better or for worse, Chelsea is the sole inheritor. How far she'll follow a public life in a public sector is still no more than press conjecture. Certainly, her parents forged new paths for a new generation, and when she announced her pregnancy she said, \"I feel all the better whether it's a boy or a girl that she or he will grow up in a world full of so many strong, young female leaders.\" Whether she will be one of them remains to be seen."
