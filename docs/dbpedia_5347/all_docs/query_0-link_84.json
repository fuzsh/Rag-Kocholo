        "text": "The annual meeting of the World Economic Forum, in Davos, Switzerland, was well under way when it officially commenced, early on a Wednesday evening in January, with an address, in the Congress Hall of the Congress Center, by Angela Merkel, the Chancellor of Germany. She had a lot to say about Europe. Some of it—“Do we dare more Europe? Yes, we do dare”—made the news. But outside the hall many Davos participants paid her no mind. They loitered in various lounges carrying on conversations with each other. They talked and talked—as though they hadn’t been talking all day. They had talked while sitting on panels or while skipping panels that others were sitting on. “Historic Complexity: How Did We Get Here?,” “The Compensation Question,” “Global Risks 2012: The Seeds of Dystopia”: over the course of five days, a man could skip more than two hundred and fifty such sessions.\n\nMany Davos participants rarely, if ever, attend even one. Instead, they float around in the slack spaces, sitting down to one arranged meeting after another, or else making themselves available for chance encounters, either with friends or with strangers whom they will ever after be able to refer to as friends. The Congress Center, the daytime hub, is a warren of interconnected lounges, cafés, lobbies, and lecture halls, with espresso bars, juice stations, and stacks of apples scattered about. The participants have their preferred hovering areas. Wandering the center in search of people to talk to was like fishing a stretch of river; one could observe, over time, which pools held which fish, and what times of day they liked to feed. Jamie Dimon, running shoes in hand, near the espresso stand by the Global Leadership Fellows Program, in the late afternoon. Fareed Zakaria, happily besieged, in the Industry Partners Lounge, just before lunch. The lunkers would very occasionally emerge from their deep holes (there were rumors of secret passageways) and glide through the crowd, with aides alongside, like pilot fish. (The W.E.F. says that Davos is an entourage-free zone, but this doesn’t seem to apply to the biggest of the big wheels, like heads of state.) It is said that the faster you walk the more important you are.\n\nI walked very slowly. I was new here, a first-timer. That Wednesday, I was eager to hear Merkel, but on my way I got sidetracked in the lounge by conversations that seemed interesting, especially the ones I wasn’t part of. It was a name-dropper’s paradise. Central bankers, industrial chiefs, hedge-fund titans, gloomy forecasters, astrophysicists, monks, rabbis, tech wizards, museum curators, university presidents, financial bloggers, virtuous heirs. I found myself in conversation with a newspaper columnist and an executive from McKinsey & Company, the management-consulting firm. This was serendipitous, as so many conversations in Davos turn out to be, because, at the urging of many, I was supposed to be angling for an invitation to the McKinsey party, at the Belvedere Hotel. A must, people said, with a glint. I was suspicious, owing to an incongruity between the words “party” and “management consulting.” But this was Davos. The executive cheerfully added me to the list. A McKinsey for a Merkel: a fair trade.\n\nThe newcomer hears repeated bits of Davos advice. Ride the shuttle: you might meet someone. Go to a session that deals with a subject you know nothing about: you might learn something. Come next year, and the one after, if they invite you back: you might begin to understand. Everyone says that you can’t get the hang of Davos until you’ve been three or four times. So many things are going on at once that it is impossible to do even a tenth of them. You could spend the week in your hotel room, puzzling over a plan, wrestling with your doubts and regrets, but a person who would do this is not the kind who would be invited to Davos.\n\nAnother admonition: no matter how much you do, you will always have the sense that something else, something better, is going on elsewhere. On the outskirts of town, three men are hunched in the candlelit corner of a pine-panelled Gaststube, discussing matters of grave importance. You may think you don’t care about such things, but the inkling burrows like a tapeworm. The appetite for admittance can become insatiable. Whenever I passed through town, I noticed men in good suits and sturdy boots, walking with intent in the opposite direction. Where were they going? They ducked into tea shops or into Mercedes sedans with darkened passenger windows. “Wheels within wheels,” one woman whispered to me. “What happens in Davos stays in Davos,” many people said, but even when you’re there it’s hard to know what is happening in Davos.\n\nOne of the things that people talk about at Davos is Davos. They murmur analogies. Davos is like Congress, the Factory, the Mormon Tabernacle, the Bohemian Grove, the “best dinner party in the world,” the financial system, Facebook, Burning Man, boot camp, high school, Los Angeles, Quogue. Davos is an onion, a layer cake, a Russian doll. “Never feel that you’re out of the loop, because the loop is you,” Platon, the photographer, assured me, by which he meant that Davos is whatever experience you are having there. But could he be trusted? It was only his second Davos. Yossi Vardi, an Israeli tech investor and an eighteen-year Davos veteran, said, “What you see here, in the Congress Center, is just twenty per cent of the action.”\n\nWhether you think the World Economic Forum is a worthy enterprise or a bunch of baloney, its annual meeting is an extraordinary creation—a miniature society, at once fluid and defined. Forty-two years ago, a German academic named Klaus Schwab willed it into being, and now, at seventy-four, he continues to nurture it, with a kind of dogged sincerity that contradicts some of the Forum’s more cynical functions and outlandish mutations. He may well be the most connected man on the planet. Around the Congress Hall, no one walks faster than Klaus.\n\nDuring the opening ceremony, Schwab, who, besides being the Forum’s chairman, is also a professor at the University of Geneva, descends the Congress Center’s grand stairway like a tax-haven monarch, pausing to take in the applause of the nobles. In the Congress Center, there is a giant video screen that spools conference quotes and international cityscapes interspersed with photos of Schwab and his wife, Hilde, and the mountains of Graubünden. A remark of unknown provenance made the rounds: “The question is, When God and Klaus Schwab are face to face, who blinks first?” This year, over the course of five days, Schwab made it to a hundred and fifty-six commitments. God blinks, and then nods off.\n\nSchwab was born in Germany in 1938, in a town near the Swiss border. A serious boy with an organizational bent, he was a regional leader in a French-German youth movement that arose out of the early idea, propagated by the likes of Winston Churchill and Jean Monnet, of a more integrated Europe—a “European Family,” as Churchill put it in 1946. In some respects, he is, intellectually, a product of the movement to unify Europe, but in others he is a graduate-school conception, a kind of Frankenstein’s monster of technocratic academe. He earned doctorates in mechanical engineering and economics, and then spent a year pursuing a master’s degree in public administration at the Kennedy School at Harvard, where he courted, as mentors, Henry Kissinger and John Kenneth Galbraith. His 1971 book, “Moderne Unternehmensführung im Maschinenbau,” set forth a new notion of the corporation—of one beholden not only to shareholders but to “stakeholders,” meaning a wider array of constituents, including the government, the community, the workers, and the customers. He had in mind a broader definition of the partnership between private and public, likely derived from Switzerland’s cantonal form of government. He was also interested in the academic study of business as it had blossomed in the United States.\n\nIn 1971, Schwab organized a European Management Forum. He chose Davos as a locale, after glimpsing the construction of a new Congress Center from a nearby swimming pool. He was attracted to the relative isolation of Davos—“People are moved out of ze daily patterns,” he told me—and its blend of rusticity and comfort, and to the crisp mountain air, or the idea of it, anyway. (Men who debate management theory tend to do so indoors.) He was also attracted by its history. Davos, in the late nineteenth century, was one of the leading sanatorium towns of Europe, the site of Hans Castorp’s edification in “The Magic Mountain.” Between the world wars, Davos became a kind of intellectuals’ retreat. Einstein delivered a lecture on relativity at an inaugural Hochschule there, in 1928; Heidegger and Cassirer had a famous debate the next year. After the Second World War, Davos reinvented itself as a medical-conference town. For all the beauty of the surrounding peaks and the talk of chalets and fondue, the town is cheerless and unlovely. Also, it is not on top of a mountain, as people seem to portray it. It is in a valley.\n\nSchwab’s first symposium drew four hundred and fifty people from thirty-one countries. It would grow over the years, steadily becoming more international (it became the World Economic Forum in 1987), more eclectic in its interests and participants, and ever more prolific in its expressions of self-regard—within years, Schwab had spoken of a Davos Manifesto, the Davos Club, the Davos Spirit. From the start, there was a patina of altruism. Jacques Cousteau came in 1974 to talk about the ocean, and Dom Hélder Câmara, the renegade Catholic archbishop from Brazil, scolded the world’s élite for their “false values” and their hoarding of the world’s resources. An overhead photograph from that year of a cocktail reception shows a room full of debonair Roger Moore types, with only a half-dozen women sprinkled in. The world was in turmoil, in one way or another, pretty much every year, but in 1977 the kidnapping and murder by German terrorists of the German industrialist Hanns-Martin Schleyer, who was to have been the chairman of the symposium a few months later, led to an extreme degree of security that has become a Davos hallmark. So have the perennial appearances of world leaders, many of them at odds and encouraged by Schwab to reconcile on his turf. NAFTA is said to have been conceived here.\n\nToday, the W.E.F., with lavish headquarters overlooking Lake Geneva, has more than four hundred employees, who churn out reports and convene conferences around the world. You get the sense that they sometimes regret the attention paid to Davos, and even to Schwab. “Davos is less and less important to the organization,” Adrian Monck, the W.E.F.’s media director, told me. “It’s no longer the best example of what we can do.” Monck, a former television-news executive and journalism-school dean, joined the Forum in 2009. He isn’t really a P.R. guy, but during the annual meeting he does send out a fusillade of releases that approach self-parody (“To Survive, Companies Must Constantly Reinvent Themselves, Become Socially Responsible”). He spends a great deal of his time combatting what he and his colleagues deem to be misconceptions about what the W.E.F. actually does.\n\nPeople like to project onto Davos their fears and fantasies about the way the world works. Right-wingers see insidious, delusional liberalism, in its stakeholder ethos and its pretense of world improvement. They picture a bunch of Keynesians, Continentals, and self-dealing do-gooders participating in some kind of off-the-books top-down command-control charade. Left-wingers conjure a plutocratic cabal, a Star Chamber of master puppeteers, the one per cent—or .01 per cent, really—deciding the world’s fate behind a curtain of heavy security and utopian doublespeak. The uninvited, the refuseniks, and even many of the participants see a colossal discharge of hot air, a peacock strut. They all deploy, with a sneer, the term Davos Man, coined by the late political scientist Samuel Huntington, who decried a post-national wealthy globe-trotting élite. Davos Man can be either a capitalist oppressor or a Commie conspirator. Either way, he is a windbag, a pedant, and a hypocrite. Businesspeople who have never been to Davos find many ways to be dismissive of it: “I can’t do business there.” “It’s too political.” “It’s not what it used to be.” The translation may be that that person has not been invited. Non-businesspeople assume the same. “Solipsistic wankers,” one person wrote me. “Kill the bastards,” wrote another.\n\nDavos is, fundamentally, an exercise in corporate speed-dating. “Everyone comes because everyone else comes,” Larry Summers told me. A hedge-fund manager or a C.E.O. can pack into a few days the dozens of meetings—with other executives, with heads of state or their deputies, with non-governmental organizations whose phone calls might otherwise have been ignored—that it would normally take months to arrange and tens of thousands of Gulfstream miles to attend. They conduct these compressed and occasionally fruitful couplings, the so-called bilateral meetings, either in private rooms that the W.E.F. has set aside for this purpose or in hotel rooms, restaurants, and hallways. All that’s missing is the hourly rate.\n\n“What this is is Brownian motion, with human beings,” Niall Ferguson, the financial historian, said one morning, outside the Congress Hall, as his eyes darted about. Vikram Pandit (Citigroup) marched by, and then Brian Moynihan (Bank of America). “Last year, I bumped into Tim Geithner, and he said, ‘We’re going to prove you wrong with our fiscal policy.’ ” At that moment, Ferguson was jostled by a woman who was pushing swiftly through the center, with an entourage of journalists and aides. “Hello, Christine!” he said. It was the I.M.F. chief, Christine Lagarde. She touched his shoulder in greeting. Ferguson turned back to me. “See there? Right on cue.”\n\nThe W.E.F., as the entity staging the conference, is set up as a nonprofit foundation. Last year, it took in a hundred and fifty-seven million dollars. (The W.E.F. doesn’t disclose Schwab’s salary, only that he is “paid less than the highest-paid Swiss public official.” The President of the Swiss Confederation makes about half a million dollars a year.) The money comes from its members, who are required to be among the world’s top thousand companies, in revenue terms. A basic W.E.F. membership is fifty-five thousand dollars, and for a member to come to Davos costs an extra twenty-seven thousand. The Forum has a hundred so-called Strategic Partners—corporate members who pay dues of more than half a million dollars a year—and two hundred and fifty Industry Partners, who pay more than a quarter of a million. Many of these big spenders happen to turn up on many of the panels in the sessions at the Congress Center. They also subsidize the scores of academics, scientists, artists, journalists, and N.G.O. chiefs who attend for free. Everyone, whether he pays or not, has to be invited. “You cannot buy your way in,” Schwab said. “It’s a large club meeting, let’s say.”\n\nThere are as many Davoses as there are perceptions of Davos. Schwab might use the term “stakeholders,” and the stakeholders may be partial to the word “silos,” but another term that springs to mind when you are there is “cliques.” There is a tech crowd, a finance crowd, a media crowd, the spouses. (The annual meeting this year was merely eighty-three per cent male, in part because the W.E.F. imposed a quota.) A certain ferment occurs where the cliques overlap, but as often as not they pass in the night. “Davos is the Land of a Thousand Agendas,” an ex-U.S. senator, who would know from such lands, told me. As Monck put it, “You don’t understand your own interests until you encounter others with other interests. This is the foundation of enlightened self-interest.”\n\n“It’s Heaven for curious guys,” a longtimer told me. “All these people who are not easily approachable in their natural habitat—whose lives, as a result, are quite secluded—here they can all talk to each other.”\n\n“I look at it as a programmer would,” Eric Schmidt, the executive chairman of Google and a longtime Davos participant, told me. “What did Klaus put in place to make it successful over the long term, that allowed it to grow and change? I try to isolate the variables. Does it have to be in Switzerland? Does it have to be in a ski town? Does it have to happen in winter? And so on.”\n\nThe most essential variable may be one that Schwab introduced unwittingly. In Davos, he established a setting for a perpetually subdividing game of status, a minuet of subtle distinctions. There is something almost Warholian in his apparent guilelessness. (Just substitute Tom Friedman, Shimon Peres, and Larry Summers for Edie Sedgwick, Nico, and Rotten Rita.) The anxiety of exclusion pervades. It is the natural complement to the euphoria of inclusion. The tension between self-celebration and self-doubt engenders a kind of social electricity. It is one of those places, like New Orleans, where you may find that you hardly need sleep. After twenty-four frantic hours, I felt as though I had unwittingly walked into an Ecstasy party—why did all these people keep touching each other? (Not literally: collegial as everyone may be, I saw one hug all week, and it was an ironic one.) It’s not the whisper of conspiracy as much as it is the thrum of mutual regard—of proximity to power, money, and expertise. But insecurity sets it all alight.\n\nThe stratification begins with the badges. Every participant wears a badge on a lanyard. Every encounter begins with an unabashed glance or two down at the other’s badge. It is Davos Man’s defining gesture. So frequently did gazes slip to reëxamine my badge that I came to know what it must be like to have cleavage. The color of the badge denotes a role, and a degree of access. W.E.F. staff wear blue badges—dark blue for full time and light for temps. “Reporting Press” wear orange and can’t get in a lot of places. Entourages get mint green. The coveted pass is the white one, granting delegates free rein. There are variations: A Strategic Partner gets a blue dot and access to an exclusive lounge. A special hologram used to signal membership in an élite faction called the Informal Gathering of World Economic Leaders, or IGWEL, but now “serves boring logistical purposes,” according to Monck. I was given a white badge, which meant I’d been knighted a Media Leader. Media Leaders may trump Reporting Press (ha!), but they bow before the Media Governors (curses!), who get invited to the off-the-record sit-downs with Geithner and Merkel.\n\nIn general, the W.E.F. greets the media with a warm, if wary, embrace. This has apparently been the strategy since the 1999 anti-globalization riots in Seattle and elsewhere turned Davos into a target of popular, and then journalistic, bile. The place is lousy with reporters. The catch is that most of what goes on is off the record. Most of the sessions and private events are governed by the so-called Chatham House rule. The bargain is generally acceptable to the insidious extent that the thrill of access outweighs the urge to reveal. Anyway, as the journalists all say, nothing newsworthy ever happens at Davos, even if the journalists must occasionally pretend that it does, in order to justify their presence there. For most of them, it’s an occasion for cultivating sources, ideas, and the short-lived delusion that they belong among the white badges of the world.\n\nNow and then, Davos has a celebrity guest or two, an elusive figure more exotic or enticing than the usual array of Prime Ministers, Nobelists, and billionaires. One year it was Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt, another it was Bono. This year’s white rabbit was the London School of Economics dropout Mick Jagger. Reports had initially had him leaving Davos, as a result of his misgivings that his presence might be seen as an endorsement of the policies of the British Prime Minister, David Cameron. It turned out, though, that Jagger, who was not an official participant, had merely skipped a tea party hosted by Cameron and had stuck around town, popping up at private events here and there, but not, evidently, at the Congress Center. Jagger sightings were conversational currency.\n\nOn Thursday evening, I blew off Korea Night at the Schweizerhof and the F.T.I. Consulting nightcap at the Caprizzi Bar, and, following a private Interactive Dinner Session at the Hotel National (a discussion of the “State of the World” with eight Nobel laureates), I made my way to the Belvedere Hotel. The Belvedere, perched above the Congress Hall, like an iced-in cruise ship, is the annual meeting’s hub after dark. Often, there are a half-dozen parties going on at once. To get into it, as into pretty much any building in town during the meeting, you must pass through airport-like security (Davos is a frequent flier’s fever dream). The line, on this night, was long enough that a Nobel laureate in economics, who, moments earlier at the Hotel National, had been holding forth on unfairness, deemed it worth cutting. Beyond the metal detector, there was a coat-check queue; the Nobelist, rather than cut this one, decided to keep his coat: “We save time twice, on the way in and on the way out—although it’s not a perfect predictor.” A sign directed people to this or that party. McKinsey’s was to the left, down a long corridor, past a display of slogans: “You’re Looking for Talent. But Is It Looking for You?” “Confidence Is Contagious. Pass It On.” “Worldly Wise, Locally Savvy.”\n\nChelsea Clinton was by the entrance to the McKinsey party. She began to talk about Leymah Gbowee, last year’s Nobel Peace Prize winner, who had been at the Nobel dinner, but Matt McKenna, her spokesman, shooed me away because I had a notebook in hand. “Really?” he said with disdain. “It’s eleven o’clock at night. Really?” A moment later, I found myself shoulder to shoulder at the bar with the Cassandra economist Nouriel Roubini, but the music was too loud to talk. There was a band onstage, GDO Soul, playing classic R. & B. (apparently, they were flown in every year from New York), and, at their feet, a vigorous dance circle, into which one, then another, man in a suit jumped to pull a few moves. There weren’t many women around. A throng of grinning silverbacks watched from a comfortable distance. I thought of Angela Merkel. Yes, more Europe, please.\n\nAt the coat check, I ran into a Media Governor who was showing his boss around. They were going to a Mick Jagger party and invited me along. Fair enough: a Mick for a McKinsey. We bundled up and walked the length of town, through a swirl of light snow and some sideways talk about an off-the-record meeting they’d been in. Our destination, it emerged, was the Schatzalp, the old hotel almost a thousand feet above town that was featured in “The Magic Mountain.” We boarded a funicular, which climbed steeply along a course of multicolored fluorescent lights. Davos dropped away. We disembarked at the Schatzalp’s deserted front patio and rode an old elevator with carpeted walls to an upper floor, where we went out a back door, over a footbridge, and down a path that tunnelled through towering drifts to a snowbound chalet. The place had been rented by Matthew Freud (Sigmund’s great-grandson, Rupert Murdoch’s son-in-law). Inside, a couple of dozen people stood around drinking and talking.\n\nJagger was there. He had on a pink button-down, black jeans, and snazzy Nike running shoes. There was a Ping-Pong table folded up against the wall; apparently Jagger had been playing when the first guests arrived. Now he was dancing, with one woman, then another, to classic reggae playing at mid-volume. No one else was dancing, but Jagger, tiny and lithe, mugging and grinning, stalked the floor. Perhaps he danced to absolve himself of having to talk to people—a motive so foreign to Davos that no one suspected him of it. I met the editor of a Turkish newspaper, the editor of a German newspaper, an Israeli hedge-fund manager, the founder of Wikipedia, and then a tall and elegant woman in a black dress named Claudia Gonzalez, who was the former P.R. boss for the W.E.F. She wanted to introduce me to Jagger, but first she needed to tell me something about my attempts to understand and convey the Davos scene. She fixed me with a fierce look and said, “Be humble. Do you understand? Be humble. Because this is your first Davos.”\n\nProfessor Schwab says that he doesn’t go to any of the private parties. “We do not welcome them,” he told me. “They detract from what we are doing. Many people come to Davos to exploit the presence of so many top-level people. They organize shadow programs.” But he acknowledges that there isn’t much he and his staff can do about them. “People know that I am very much against caviar and champagne and expensive wines, which are out of character with the atmosphere of a mountain village.”\n\nOne night at the Belvedere, I met Richard Stromback, a technology entrepreneur who was introduced to me as Ultimate Davos. For several years, he attended the annual meeting as a Technology Pioneer, then as a Young Global Leader, but this year he didn’t actually have a W.E.F. badge; rather, he had a Belvedere badge, thanks to a connection with a C.E.O. who was hosting meetings at the hotel. Sturdy, wild-eyed, and gregarious, Stromback told me that his first paid job, twenty years ago, was as an enforcer in the Ontario Hockey League. (YouTube confirms this. And one would be remiss, in this context, not to drop the name of a famous guy he fought, the longtime N.H.L. pugilist Tie Domi.) Stromback lives in Detroit, but in a way he considers Davos—not so much the five-day event as the community that assembles there and then stays in touch throughout the year—to be his home. His shadow program involves trying to create, as he put it, a “Burning Man for billionaires,” mostly by throwing parties at the Piano Bar in the Europa Hotel, the meeting’s longtime late-night hangout. “This is the real Davos,” he told me, when I found him there the next night. It was, technically, Stromback’s forty-third-birthday party. The scene was a kind of louche facsimile of the Congress Hall lounge, with an array of unlikely bar fellows joining the standard contingent of finance magnates and Silicon Valley turks: some Mongolian oligarchs, the executive chairman of Google, and the crown prince of the Dish Network empire, who was dressed in Cathay Pacific pajamas.\n\nThe real Davos, in Stromback’s estimation, revolved around the keyboardist and piano-bar m.c. Barry Colson, who for seventeen years has come to Davos from his home in Halifax, Nova Scotia, to play during the month of the annual meeting. Colson encourages people to take the mike and the rest of the house to sing along. One night, I saw the Cantor Fitzgerald C.E.O. Howard Lutnick, hair slicked back, sing a rousing rendition of Robbie Williams’s “Feel.” Stromback, at his birthday party, was serenaded by Randi Zuckerberg (Mark’s sister), and then got Eric Schmidt to goad Drew Houston, the founder of Dropbox, into singing “Rocket Man.” (YouTube, to Houston’s dismay, confirms this.) In the Europa lobby, on my way out, the benches were occupied by women changing from their snow boots to their high heels.\n\nThe mood at Davos: every year, people try to put their finger on it, as though a single state of mind can be attributed to so many stakeholders dwelling in so many silos. The economic and geopolitical context of the meeting this year was the potential collapse of the European monetary and political union, a teetering global financial system, the threat of chronic unemployment, widening wealth disparity, increasingly restive populations, and the shift in resources and capital, and therefore in power, from West to East and from North to South, to say nothing of ongoing environmental degradation, global poverty, and widespread armed conflict and mistreatment of women. So it is safe to say that, in terms of the W.E.F.’s stated commitment of “improving the state of the world,” the mood was a little blue.\n\nThe theme of the meeting was “The Great Transformation.” Schwab, early in the week, struck a note of self-flagellation. “Capitalism, in its current form, no longer fits the world around us,” he said. “We have sinned.” He also spoke of the danger of “intergenerational conflict.” In the next few days, the phrase “the end of capitalism” got tossed around, yet for all but a few of the stakeholders present such a prospect was as inconceivable as it would be unwelcome. David Roth, a protester with the Occupy movement, dismissed such talk as “staged self-criticism.” Certainly, all the commotion about the world’s problems didn’t yield many concrete solutions. As a foreign economic minister said dryly during one of the sessions, while discussing some common-sense alterations to the global financial system, “Implementation is problematic.”\n\n“It’s as if we woke up and discovered we were now in a different world,” the economist W. Brian Arthur told me. “It’s like that bit in ‘Lord of the Rings,’ where they are underground, and they hear the distant rumblings of the Balrog. Here there are rumblings of dissatisfaction. But only rumblings.”\n\nThe rumblings were faint indeed. I walked into a panel one morning in time to hear Kumi Naidoo, the South African human-rights activist who now serves as the executive director of Greenpeace, intone, melodiously, “Those in power ignore the growing frustration and desperation at their own peril.”\n\nNaidoo had been to Davos eleven times, the first eight as the secretary-general of the Global Call to Action Against Poverty. “When I came in that capacity, I never could get a C.E.O. to talk to me,” he told me later. “I used to follow them into the toilet. I met Bill Clinton in 2003, when we were standing next to each other at the urinals. When I came as Greenpeace, two years ago, I was amazed how keen they were to meet me. A C.E.O. told me, ‘Some of my peers are eager to have you at their table so they won’t be on your menu.’ ”\n\nHe went on, “The problem here is the preference for incremental thinking—baby steps. They talk more about system recovery than about system design.”\n\nOn the Promenade through town, I came upon a couple of protesters, who had set up a foosball table, marked “reich/rich” on one end and “arm/poor” on the other, and tilted in favor of the reich. One of the protesters had on flowing robes, garlands of fake hundred-dollar bills, fake chains, and a monster mask. He growled my name through the mask several times, as though he knew me. (The mask had disguised his use of the Davos glance to read my badge.) Then he quoted T. S. Eliot: “Do not let me hear / Of the wisdom of old men, but rather of their folly.” After a moment, he lifted his mask and introduced himself. He was a sixty-six-year-old architect named Gunnar Jauch, who had lost eighty per cent of his savings in the financial crisis and had since become a vocal presence in the Occupy Zurich movement. He knew Davos. He’d taught skiing here in the early seventies. He showed me a cartoon that encapsulated his feeling about the W.E.F. annual meeting. It depicts a woman in a fur coat walking into the Congress Center and saying to her companion, “There are so many sessions, I can’t decide between ‘hunger’ or ‘poverty.’ ”\n\nOne afternoon, I walked outside with a couple of other Media Leaders. The Occupiers had set up in a spillover parking lot, which the mayor of Davos had lent them. They’d built several igloos and put up two yurts, which were festooned with handmade signs, the best of which read “The Great Transformation?? Bullshit. Nobody with 4 Aces Wants a New Deal!” Edward Sutton, a Minnesotan currently living in Zurich, came over to talk to us. His beef was “the fundamental illegitimacy of the W.E.F.” He said, “It has no democratic basis whatsoever. Those people can’t claim to represent the seven billion.” He also objected to the fact that the W.E.F. isn’t transparent. “They don’t open up their books to the public.” As he spoke, the other two dozen or so members of the encampment were standing in a circle, holding a meeting. The W.E.F. had invited them to attend a session, and they were trying to decide how to respond. Sutton asked that I not listen in, and also that I not mention what he did for a living. The Chatham Yurt rule.\n\nThat day, a group of them showed up at an Open Forum session (the Open Forum is an annex of the W.E.F., open to the public) on the subject of “remodelling capitalism.” One of the panelists, Stephen Roach, the chairman of Morgan Stanley’s Asian operations, found himself in the role of Wall Street apologist, which, as a mere economist and a longtime critic of some of Wall Street’s excesses, he took on with some delicacy. Nonetheless, he felt, as he wrote in a column in the Financial Times, that he was at physical risk. At the end, after an Occupier’s closing remark, one of the Occupiers declared, “We don’t focus on solutions. We want to change the process of finding solutions.” Roach wrote, “The crowd roared its approval and surged towards the stage. I made a hasty exit through a secret door in the kitchen and out into the night. But Davos will never again be the same for me. There can be no retreat in the battle for big ideas.” Two weeks later, Roach announced his retirement.\n\nOne morning at the Congress Hall, I wandered over to the espresso counter at the Industry Partners Lounge, where one could find stimulating conversation as well as individually wrapped miniature sandwiches and slices of cake.\n\nSeated alone at a table was a man named Daniel Arbess. I’d first encountered him there my first day, when I’d overheard a muscular voice making Davosian remarks (“When Gorbachev came to power . . .”). He had glasses midway down his nose, stubble, and thinning brown hair: the assertive dishevelment of improbably well-compensated bookishness. Over the course of the next couple of days, I kept seeing him around. At a dinner one night, I introduced myself, and, in the exhilaration of the moment—that fleeting feeling of actually wanting to meet new people—we agreed to talk. Now here he was. The affiliation on his badge was Perella Weinberg, the boutique investment firm. He said he ran a hedge fund.\n\nWhat kind of a hedge fund? I asked.\n\n“My approach is shaped by a single generational theme, an idea I came upon thirty years ago,” he said. A fuller explanation required some life history. Arbess, who is fifty-one, grew up in Montreal and got a law degree at Harvard. In the early eighties, he developed an interest and expertise in nuclear policy. He was among the motley array of intellectuals, celebrities, and arms-control experts who flew to Moscow by Aeroflot jetliner, in 1987, to hear Mikhail Gorbachev unveil some of his intentions with regard to perestroika and glasnost. “Listening to him, I developed this conviction: If he is going to start democratizing the country, the regime will not be able to maintain control. It will collapse, and this will mean the end of the Communist system.” He signed on as a first-year associate at the law firm White & Case, and volunteered to work in the Stockholm office, for its proximity to Russia. Back in New York, in 1989, a partner introduced him to the manager of the U.N. Plaza Hotel, a Czech expat whose sister, an actress in Prague, had a friend who needed legal advice. That friend was Vaclav Havel. In the coming years, Arbess became the main legal adviser to Havel’s government in its efforts to privatize the Czech economy. He later expanded the firm’s practice into Russia, Poland, and Kazakhstan and developed the belief that, as he put it, “the devolution of Communism would be the single biggest driver of opportunity in our time.” He spent the ensuing decades investing in some of the repercussions: privatized companies, the transformation of China, the acceleration of leveraged consumption in the United States, mining interests, currencies, consumer goods. He sold his latest fund, Xerion, to Perella Weinberg in 2007, but still managed it. “The money follows the ideas,” he said.\n\nHe cited, as his reason for coming to Davos, “three concentric circles of inquiry that are worth pursuing.” The first was to deepen his understanding of the European debt crisis. “For an investor to be sitting with central bankers and to have the chance to motivate outcomes and contribute to their understanding of the marketplace is a great opportunity.” The second circle was to “cross and mix disciplines to get a deeper understanding of what’s driving the world”—that is, to meet non-money people. For example, he had attended a presentation by Saul Perlmutter, the Nobel Prize-winning astrophysicist, on the accelerating expansion of the universe. He’d found it enlightening, if not investable. “Explain to me why this is relevant,” he asked Perlmutter, who responded, “Thinking about basic science leads to basic applications.”\n\nThe third circle had to do with his recent interest in the potential for intergenerational discord. “Kids who are twenty or thirty years younger than we are have a totally different experience in and manner of absorbing and processing information,” he said. “How will this generation make decisions? How will they understand the big, looming debate about the legacy of entitlements and debt left by their elders? How do they understand the economy?” It was his suspicion, from his conversations here and elsewhere, that they may not understand it very well, or at least that polarizing rhetoric—fostered by social media, amplified by a cynical political class—may be corrupting their ability to discuss it in terms their elders can understand or abide.\n\n“There’s a lot of intellectual confusion about the causes and culprits institutionally of the mess that we are in,” he said. “The language and the thinking that have evolved after the financial crisis have had an impact on the way young people think. All this talk that companies need to change, and so on—it’s a misconception of the role that companies play. Shareholders risk capital. Banks intermediate capital. This is what keeps an economy going.” He went on, “The root cause of everything we’re experiencing is a failure of holistic thinking in a world of increasingly complex, fragmented, and ubiquitous information.”\n\nBig data, the proliferation of information and the problem of processing it, was a big subject at Davos. I befriended a Brown University biology professor named Casey Dunn, whose specialty is data. He had a bushy brown beard and wore a brown suit, which made him stand out among the hundreds of men in dark Italian-cut suits. He thought, at first, that this was like any other conference he’d been to, albeit a little fancier, and with more celebrity sightings. Michael Dell wandered by. David Rubenstein, of the Carlyle Group, was talking to Jamie Dimon. “For instance, is that the Dalai Lama?” He pointed to a small throng, in the middle of which stood a bald man in saffron and burgundy Tibetan robes.\n\nIt turned out to be a French monk named Matthieu Ricard. He was another habitué of the Industry Partners Lounge. We connected there one morning. After getting a Ph.D. in molecular genetics in 1972, Ricard went to the Himalayas to study Tibetan Buddhism and reëmerged, two decades later, as a celebrity magus, thanks to his best-selling book “The Monk and the Philosopher,” a dialogue between him and his father, the philosopher Jean-François Revel. He now lives in Nepal, where he spends three months a year in silent isolation and, in his uptime, writes and translates books, oversees a hundred and ten humanitarian projects, and in general advances the cause of compassion. His participation in various brain studies has earned him the sobriquet “the happiest person in the world.”\n\n“The sensory input here is too much,” Ricard told me. This was his fourth Davos. “I’ve heard some talk about rebuilding capitalism from scratch. It tells you something that they are even talking about this. But I’m not betting on it!” He went on, “There is a dilemma, to reconcile three time scales: in the short term, the economy; in the middle range, global well-being generally; and, in the long range, the environment.” He recalled some criticism of Davos of a kind voiced two years ago by Jody Williams, the 1997 Nobel Peace Prize winner. (“These guys just want to convince people that they care about others, which they don’t, and then get back to making money as fast as they can,” she said at a dinner.) “There are all kinds of people here,” Ricard said. “It’s not just economic and financial people. Maybe it’s for show, but I think it’s not.” He went on, “Look, we’re not speaking to the deaf. They can hear us.”\n\nThe question underneath it all, at least as it pertained to “improving the state of the world,” was: Can you change people, or must you change the people—that is, get new ones? “People very rarely change,” Platon told me. “What does change is the cycle of power. Power’s not yours to keep. You borrow it.”\n\n“I’ve changed my mind,” Dunn, the bearded Brown data man, said when I ran into him later in the week. “It’s not like any other conference. Usually, you have to find the guy who can get you to the guy who can get you to the guy who can make a decision. Here we are several levels closer to the decider.” Earlier, a man had walked away from him mid-sentence, and he’d turned to see the man shaking hands with Ehud Barak. (I, too, encountered Barak, along with Shimon Peres, at a private Shabbat dinner—the “Davos within Davos,” as the host, a W.E.F. official, called it—at which Barak gave a rambling and pugnacious speech. “We must hold out our hand in peace,” he said, at one point. “But it should be the left hand.”)\n\nOn the last day, when I saw Dunn, he was wearing a dark suit, as though he’d finally succumbed to the place. “It’s like the emergence of Darth Vader,” he said. “I finally had someone explain it to me. Davos is actually tons of different meetings.” We reckoned that they overlapped, in a series of Venn diagrams that brought to mind the symbols for Audi (a Strategic Partner) or the Olympics (a distant cousin). He found it noteworthy that while the scientists were expected to present their ideas in terms that laymen could understand—“We’re expected to do science lite”—the economists and the financiers hadn’t indulged their scientific counterparts with any primer for the financial crisis or what was happening in Europe. This was, to his eyes, a sign that the scientists and philosophers were window dressing. “I never felt excluded,” he said. “But it suggests that ultimately this isn’t for us.”\n\nEach year, Viktor Pinchuk, the Ukrainian oligarch and friend of Bill Clinton, hosts a panel discussion at Davos, under the aegis of his charitable foundation. Last year, he invited the artists Olafur Eliasson and Jeff Koons to discuss philanthropy with a moderator, the novelist and Davos regular Paulo Coelho. (A writer griped to me, as if addressing Schwab, “You know, Klaus, there are other novelists.”) This year, the subject was “e-philanthropy”—that is, using the Internet to raise money. Davosians streamed into the Schweizerhof Hotel. Reedy waitresses gave out glasses of juice and champagne. A couple of hundred guests filed into a ballroom, and Pinchuk stood. “This is Internet. We really believe to the power of Internet, when increasing the efficiency of philanthropy,” he said. “We have here the best possible panel, the best people, the best specialists who can speak about it.” These were the Internet entrepreneur Sean Parker, Google’s Eric Schmidt, the Russian investor Yuri Milner, and Alec Ross, the tech adviser to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. The moderator was Chelsea Clinton, who started off by addressing Ross: “Since you work for my mom, and I hope you’ll give her a good report . . .”\n\n“I’m sure I will, Chelsea. You’re off to a good start. You’re doing a good job.”\n\n“Aw, shucks, thank you,” she said, and then her face went serious. “Given all the tumult and these existential questions that are being asked around the world about what is the role of government, what is the role of philanthropy, as power is being argued about, fought over, redistributed . . .”\n\nI looked around the room. Many of the people in the audience were on their BlackBerrys and iPhones. It seemed that Davos men and women attended sessions just to catch up on their e-mail—to take a break from talking to each other in order to e-mail each other about meeting up to talk later. There was considerable crowding at the rear of the hall. The back row is always popular for ease of exit.\n\nRoss was saying, “If there was one lesson I’ve learned in the last three years working for your mom and being witness to significant shifts in power around the world, it’s that there is a significant shift in geopolitical power globally right now, from hierarchies, like the nation-state, to individuals and networks of individuals. This is something that’s being accelerated by increasingly powerful and ubiquitous information networks.”\n\nSchmidt said something about giving people phones to empower them. This reminded Ross of an app that had enabled Africans to track the menstrual cycles of dairy cattle.\n\nAfter a while, some people got up to leave. One was Saul Perlmutter, the astrophysicist. Another was a man named Murat Sonmez, an executive at the Silicon Valley software firm Tibco. Sonmez, like Arbess, had attended Perlmutter’s talk that morning, called “Dark Forces at Play.” He had been astonished by Perlmutter’s description of the acceleration of the expansion of the universe, about how every time scientists look at the night sky through a powerful telescope they see the vestiges of events that occurred billions of years ago.\n\nThey walked out together and headed down the Promenade, toward the Congress Hall. The sky had cleared. The mountains, newly covered in snow, sparkled beyond the rooftops. Snow misted down from the pines like pixie dust; now and then, as the sun warmed the boughs, clumps fell noiselessly to the street. Sonmez began to tell Perlmutter about Tibco and its expertise in sifting through and finding patterns in the acceleratingly expansive universe of digital data. Tibco had designed the data-sorting software for Amazon, Federal Express, Goldman Sachs, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, eBay, the airlines, and the Department of Homeland Security. “We can prevent blackouts,” Sonmez was saying. “We can predict when a gambler at a slot machine will cease to be happy.” He explained how Tibco, on behalf of Harrah’s, had designed a system that can figure out when a gambler is about to encounter a loss of such magnitude that it will cause him to leave the casino and perhaps never come back. The casino’s Luck Ambassadors will then offer the gambler a free meal or a ticket to a show (Tibco’s software having determined that there are otherwise empty seats to fill or excess inventory to slough off), and distract the gambler long enough to entice him to return later, to continue losing money in palatable increments. At the moment, he said, Tibco was building an engine that will mimic the way the human brain recognizes patterns.\n\nSuch wonders amazed even Perlmutter, a man who passes the hours considering the mysteries of the cosmos. It sounded like just the thing he’d been searching for. He spent his days engaged in a visual analysis of unstructured data—looking, as he put it, for a needle in a haystack. Perlmutter, who is at Berkeley, said that he would like to visit Tibco in Palo Alto and talk about ways in which Tibco might be able to help him understand the universe. Sonmez said that he would love to hire some of Perlmutter’s Ph.D.s. They exchanged cards, shook hands, and parted ways. ♦"
