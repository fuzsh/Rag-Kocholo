Clinton, daughter of Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and former President Bill Clinton, and Rycker are now the only women on the board since Diller’s wife, fashion designer Diane von Furstenberg, left in 2008.\n\nIAC has more than 50 brands, which include Match.com and Newsweek Daily Beast.\n\nClinton, 31, is a doctorate student at Oxford University and working at New York University, according to the Associated Press. She received a master’s in public health from Columbia University."
