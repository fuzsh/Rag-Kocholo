        "text": "Some would argue that McKinsey, Bain and BCG are home to some of the most academically blessed amongst us.\n\nHowever, to be considered by one of these ‘top tier’ firms you must prove you are someone for whom excelling is part of your wheelhouse and who is comfortable they can thrive being surrounded by equally exacting high performers.\n\nIncreasingly we are seeing internal group strategy functions hire these ex-strategy consultants thus providing a trajectory for consultants to become future leaders of some of the leading companies both nationally and internationally.\n\nHowever, having considerable academic horsepower and a top tier consulting pedigree does not automatically give you a free ticket to the C- suite.\n\nEx strategy consultants often have a hard time securing a role that will allow them to prove they are more than just a whippet smart advisor who can design an amazing slide pack.\n\nOne of the most common hurdles is when they are aiming for a role with P&L responsibility or managing a large team which are two areas that are not part of the traditional consulting remit.\n\nWhilst running global teams and mentoring is second nature to consultants these teams are lean and fluid program to program so the roles with extensive headcount become more difficult to secure. Gravitas certainly helps, and this comes naturally to many senior leaders in consulting firms - but it is slightly harder to qualify who has that nuanced combination of respect, warmth, motivation and leadership!\n\nLeaders of consulting firms are often ‘over indexed’ on this having reached partnership level by having this magic mix in a high proportion ensuring they can win and deliver work to top CEOs the world over.\n\nStatistically McKinsey is the company that produces the most CEOs of Fortune 500 firms according to an article from our fabulous friends at Forbes.\n\nSo, who are the most distinguished alumni of McKinsey, BCG and Bain? The list below is not exhaustive by any stretch of the imagination but I think some of the names may surprise you.\n\n10 DISTINGUISHED MCKINSEY ALUMNI\n\nSheryl Sandberg, COO at Facebook and founder of Leanin.org\n\nWolfgang Bernhard, Former CEO of Mercedes-AMG, Volkswagen AG and former Chairman of Daimler\n\nHelmut Panke, Former Chairman & CEO of BMW\n\nBob Haas, Chairman of Levi Strauss & Co\n\nVittorio Colao, CEO of Vodafone\n\nIan Narev, CEO of CBA\n\nJames McNerney, Former Chairman, President and CEO of Boeing\n\nChelsea Clinton, daughter of former U.S President Bill Clinton\n\nBrian Salsberg, Senior Vice President, Global Strategy at AVON\n\nJeff Skilling, Ex Enron CEO (now of somewhat lesser repute)\n\n10 DISTINGUISHED BCG ALUMNI\n\nBrad Banduccu - CEO Woolworths Group\n\nJohn Legend, Grammy award winning musician\n\nBill Bain, Founder of Bain & Co\n\nBenjamin Netanyahu, Prime Minister of Israel\n\nRoland Berger, Founder of Roland Berger Strategy Consultants\n\nIndra Nooyi, CEO of Pepsi\n\nBob Kagle, Director of eBay and Partner at Benchmark\n\nAhmed Fahour, Former CEO of Australia Post and of the Australian operations of the National Australia Bank\n\nAlex Michel, Star of The Bachelor, Season One in the US\n\nJeff Immelt, Chairman of the board of the U.S. based conglomerate General Electric\n\nAndrea Orcel, Head of Origination at Merrill Lynch\n\n10 DISTINGUISHED BAIN ALUMNI\n\nGreg Brenneman, Former CEO of PwC and Burger King and now Chairman of CCMP Capital\n\nMitt Romney, Former CEO of Bain & Co, Founder of Bain Capital and 70th Governor of Massachusetts\n\nMeg Whitman, CEO of Hewlett Packard and former CEO of eBay\n\nJohn Donahoe, Former CEO of eBay\n\nJane Mendillo, Former President & CEO of Harvard Management Company\n\nKevin Rollins, Former CEO of Dell Inc\n\nMichael Murphy, Former Olympic Diver\n\nJayne Hrdlicka, CEO of Jetstar\n\nBernie Brookes, Former CEO of Myer and CEO at Edcon\n\nScott Cook, Co-Founder of Intuit"
