There is the habit of pre-empting questions by asking lots of them. The passionate interest in health care. The tendency to sound a bit scripted when talking about policy, even in private. The way both borrowed on family contacts to establish post-White-House careers, but won over skeptical colleagues with their diligence and enthusiasm.\n\nAnd if her mother, Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton, manages to become the first female president of the United States, Chelsea Clinton could be in a historic, head-spinning position of her own: the first first child twice over.\n\nShe certainly brings experience to the job. At age 12, she appeared in Bill Clinton’s “Man From Hope” video, testifying to his fatherly virtues. (Clinton also told viewers of his daughter’s forgiving reaction to his admissions about marital transgressions.) During the Monica Lewinsky scandal six years later, she was photographed hand in hand with her parents, seemingly holding them together.\n\nWhen Hillary Clinton first ran for the Senate, her 20-year-old daughter crisscrossed New York state by her side. Now, at 27, Chelsea Clinton is still clapping and beaming on her parents’ behalf, accompanying them on trips (recently, to Aspen, Colo., Germany and Israel), fundraising (she helped bring in more than $20 million for her father’s foundation this fall) and playing a more glamorous version of her lifelong role: model daughter.\n\n“It’s ‘The Truman Show,’ ” said Jill Kargman, a friend of Chelsea Clinton’s, citing the movie about a character whose entire life is a reality television program.\n\nBut like Truman, who eventually breaks free, Clinton now has her own life: a hedge fund job, a serious boyfriend, a tight circle of friends and a permanent place setting on the New York party circuit.\n\nLately, Clinton has been able to have her celebrity and control it, too, enjoying the perks but fewer of the drawbacks she used to suffer, like jokes about her looks and tabloid speculation about a canceled wedding or secret honeymoon. She retains a publicist, but mainly to fend off publicity; she and her parents turned down interview requests for this article, as they have for countless others on the subject.\n\nNow Clinton must decide whether to surrender some of her privacy to help her mother, who is seeking the Democratic presidential nomination.\n\nCampaign officials would not say when – or even if – Chelsea Clinton would appear on the trail. “Even though president and Sen. Clinton are public figures, their daughter is not,” Howard Wolfson, the campaign spokesman, said in a statement.\n\nThose familiar with the Clintons envision Chelsea Clinton as a strategic resource, not an ever-present voice. “She’ll talk about what she knows about, meaning her mother,” said Donna Shalala, the former Clinton cabinet member who chaperoned Clinton’s Olympics trip in 2000. John Catsimatidis, a businessman and loyal Clinton supporter, who says he has seen Chelsea Clinton at too many fundraisers to name, agreed. “She’s a very talented girl, she’s very smart,” he said, “and people would rather see a member of a Clinton family at a fundraiser than a surrogate.”\n\nClinton began college interested in medicine, which would have taken her away from her parents’ orbit, into long years of hospital training. Instead, after graduating with honors from Stanford University in June 2001, she enrolled at Oxford University, which her father had attended as a Rhodes scholar.\n\nAfter Oxford, Chelsea Clinton signed up with McKinsey, a consulting company known as an elite business training corps. She was the youngest in her class, hired at the same rank as those with MBA degrees.\n\nLast fall, Clinton moved on, taking a job analyzing investments at Avenue Capital, a hedge fund run by Marc Lasry, a loyal donor to Democratic causes generally, and Clinton-related ones specifically. The company invests its $18 billion in the debt of troubled businesses.\n\nColleagues from McKinsey and Avenue Capital give a uniform account of Clinton, saying that she came early, stayed late, showed sound judgment and asked no special favors.\n\nMany interviews with Clinton’s friends followed the same pattern: requests not to be identified in the article, followed by warm descriptions of Clinton, then moments of anxiety that she would find out about the praise. Still, in more than a dozen interviews, a consensus portrait emerged, that of a sincere, serious woman who, consciously or not, has picked up a few politician-like habits.\n\nLeslie Gelb, president emeritus of the Council on Foreign Relations, has watched the deliberate way Clinton navigates the award-and-cocktail-party circuit. “She’s more than aware that she could be a week’s worth of headlines or a month’s worth of rumors,” Gelb said.\n\nClinton also appears patient with the strangers who constantly insert themselves into her day. “Way more than any actor, she would be entitled to the eye roll,” said Kargman, who recently tried to carry on a conversation with Clinton at a party as fan after fan interrupted to talk about her parents.\n\nClinton, who never had a sibling to share or dilute the pressures on her, has a partner whose life is an uncanny mirror of her own. Marc Mezvinsky, who works at Goldman Sachs in New York, is also the child of two politician parents, Marjorie Margolies-Mezvinsky and Edward Mezvinsky, both former members of Congress. And Marc Mezvinsky survived a humiliating parental scandal, when his father pleaded guilty in 2002 to swindling dozens of investors out of $10 million.\n\nClinton and Mezvinsky seem serious about a future together, according to friends, some of whom wonder about a White House wedding in the event of a Clinton electoral victory.\n\nOriginally Published: July 30, 2007 at 11:01 p.m."
