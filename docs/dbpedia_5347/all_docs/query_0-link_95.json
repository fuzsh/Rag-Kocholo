        "text": "In Hacked D.N.C. Emails, a Glimpse of How Big Money Works (the New York Times, July 25, 2016)\n\nAfter Lying Low, Deep-Pocketed Clinton Donors Return to the Fore (the New York Times, July 28, 2016)\n\nEgo Clashes Exposed in Leaked Emails From Democratic National Committee (the New York Times, July 24, 2016)\n\n1. The public discourse on campaign contributions as a means of influence over specific pieces of legislation unfolds on a grade-school level. Campaign contributions are just the icing on the cake. The term \"establishment\" is actually a morally-charged content-free epithet--not a concept.\n\n2. The historical formation of historically specific political-economic elites and their role in shaping broad strategic frameworks, as well as providing the personnel of the state, is a proper question.\n\n3. So is the question of the synthesis of the strategic objectives of such elites and the exigencies of the mobilization and manipulation of specific segments of the population. Donald Trump has, in a fantastic example of twenty-first century patrimonialissm, has stolen the herd from the old guard elite of the GOP. It remains to be seen if the Romneys and Bushes and others of similar provenance can recapture their party.\n\n4. These specific segments of the population, from the standpoint of such elites, are cultural resources (e.g.,the GOP's racist base) and political problems (e.g., the British citizens who voted for Brexit). Rarely are potential voters addressed as citizens (although this sometimes does happen, as in FDR's 1936 election campaign).\n\n5. The historical formation now associated with the name \"Clinton\" emerged with the creation of the Democratic Leadership Council in 1985 (See 1992 membership list here.)\n\n6. In the praxis of elites, family and other kinds of close ties are of great significance. Note that four of the nine directors of the Clinton Foundation have such close ties (three family and one a close working relationship): Clinton, Ibrahim, Jackson, and Saban.\n\n7. The three New York Times articles above are extraordinary in the light they cast on the everyday workings of the elite milieu associated with the name \"Clinton\".\n\n8. The institutional milieu of the Directors of the Clinton Foundation is sketched below. This should be studied in the context of the New York Times articles.\n\nDirectors of the Clinton Foundation\n\nBRUCE R.
