        "text": "DR. LINDA MILLS, DIRECTOR\n\nCo-Founder, Of Many Institute for Multifaith Leadership\n\nCo-Chair, Of Many Advisory Board\n\nArtist, author, activist, therapist, and academic Linda G. Mills has been producing and directing movies for the better part of the past decade. Her last two films, Of Many and Better to Live, premiered in consecutive years at the Tribeca Film Festival. Of Many (2014) — a collaboration with executive producer Chelsea Clinton — went on to play at 16 festivals, including AFI Docs. It later traveled to Tunisia as part of the American Film Showcase and earned a Wilbur Award from the Religious Communicators Council. In 2017, an expanded version of the documentary, titled Of Many: Then and Now, debuted on ABC to 8.1 million viewers. Mills' second official selection at Tribeca, Better to Live (2015), chronicles the story of university drama majors who tackle the travails of college life.\n\nHer first documentary film, Auf Wiedersehen: ‘Til We Meet Again (2010), played at the Los Angeles Jewish Film Festival, where it earned the runner-up audience award, and at seven other festivals, including in Philadelphia, Israel, Minneapolis, and Vienna.\n\nMost recently, The Rest of Us (2018) — Mills’ first narrative feature film, produced by Mary Stuart Masterson — is set on the campus of Blair University in the aftermath of 9/11, where a diverse group of students struggle to make sense of their place in a new world order. In her latest documentary, No Contact (2018), Linda builds on over 20 years of research on domestic violence to raise serious questions about whether two million “stay away” orders each year do more harm than good as they contribute significantly to mass incarceration and poverty in the US. In addition to filmmaking, Mills is Vice Chancellor for Global Programs and University Life at NYU, where she also is the Lisa Ellen Goldberg Professor. Her academic work has been published by Princeton University Press, Basic Books, and Harvard Law Review, and has been featured in USA Today and the Los Angeles Times.\n\nELIZABETH SWADOS, composer\n\nElizabeth Swados has composed, written, and directed for over 30 years. She currently teaches drama at New York University's Tisch School of the Arts. Some of her works include Trilogy, Alice at the Palace, Runaways, and Groundhog. Swados has been creating issue-oriented theater with young people for her entire career. This work has culminated in a theatrical extravaganza for New York University, The Reality Show, about college life in New York City. Swados has published novels, non-fiction books, children's books and poetry to great acclaim, and received the Ken Award for her book, My Depression. Awards include: Five Tony nominations, three Obie Awards, Guggenheim Fellowship, Ford Grant, Helen Hayes Award, Lila Acheson Wallace Grant, PEN Citation, and others. Upcoming events include: My Depression: The Up and Down and Up of It, directed and written by David Wachtenheim, Robert Marianetti and Elizabeth Swados, an animated short film based on her book, My Depression, featuring Sigourney Weaver. This film will have its World Premiere at the Tribeca Film Festival and is produced by HBO."
