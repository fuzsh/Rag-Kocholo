        "text": "It’s not everyday an Oxford educated, McKinsey alum gets called a “girl” on the heels of being named to a corporate board.\n\nBut it’s the type of derision smart and powerful women have become accustomed to.\n\nThe new board member is Chelsea Clinton. She was named as a director to Expedia’s board this month and many of the news articles on the appointment took aim at her experience and the board compensation.\n\nThis piece from the New York Post, titled Chelsea Clinton Lands Cushy Expedia Board Gig, stated:\n\nMama Hillary Clinton didn’t make it to the White House, and hubby Marc Mezvinsky has just shuttered his hedge fund .\n\nWhat’s a girl to do?\n\nExpedia answered that question for Chelsea Clinton Friday by appointing her to its board.\n\nThis wasn’t even as bad as some of the cruel and childish comments on social media, which you know, I'm not going to reprint.\n\nThe Post and a number of other publications played up how much money she’s receiving, upwards of $250,000 a year. But that’s just in line with what directors of large public companies receive.\n\n“Large-cap companies in our study pay directors $260,000 at the median and $300,000 at the 75th percentile,” unchanged from last year, according to a 2016 FW Cook Compensation report.\n\nI know anything Clinton is a lightening rod these days given the political climate of division and hate we find ourselves in, but I’d bet the son of a president wouldn’t get this kind of backlash if he were appointed to a board, especially given Chelsea Clinton’s background.\n\nIt's no wonder gender parity on boards isn't expected to happen until 2048, according to EY's Center for Board Matters."
