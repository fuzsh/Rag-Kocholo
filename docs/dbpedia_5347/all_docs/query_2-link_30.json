        "text": "Snippets below from the White Paper (link below) drawn from the \"Active Opportunity in the Passive Ascendancy\" Seminar at Waverton Investment Management offices last week. \"So Passive has its place, but comes to turning points - like now, when volatility is high and central banks are unsure......an active approach is superior\" James Carter, CFA \"70% of Lipper's award winners remain in top two quartiles after 5 years\" Jake Moeller \"We've done well even without having any exposure to Nvidia.....\" Tineke Frikkee \"...why wouldn't you want an active manager to pick out some high-quality REITs when they're trading at a 40% discount to NAV?\" Luke Hyde-Smith \"Recently the Japanese market hit all-time new high...if you had bought the index proxy in 1989, you'd only just have got your money back today.....the best performing stocks are world leaders....Toyota, for example is up 1500% in that time.\" Stefan Rheinwald\n\nüöÄ#OMR highlights the push for #Transparency in #PrivateEquity The OMR Conference features a panel discussing the increasing efforts to make the private equity sector more transparent and accessible. Panelists including Laura Schroeder Schr√∂der from KKR, Lorenz J√ºngling from Moonfare, and Georgia H√§dicke explored themes covered in the session titled \"Private Equity for the Masses ‚Äì A Closed Industry Opens Up.\" The focus on enhancing the visibility and accessibility of private equity, supported by both industry leaders and media, reflects a significant shift towards greater openness in the sector. This commitment is echoed by recent initiatives like our #PECConference, which also emphasized transparency in private equity. Laura Schr√∂der's participation at both events highlights her prominent role in advocating for these changes. Let's continue to make private equity more approachable and transparent! This is an exciting time to push the boundaries and set new standards! #OMRConference #PrivateEquity #IndustryInnovation #Transparency\n\nDay one highlights from SuperReturn‚Äôs Women in Private Markets forum. We had a full house with an impressive gathering of women from the international private markets industry delving into topics around the democratisation of private markets, the role of ESG and the significance of DPI as a metric. Takeaways: üöÄFundraising is becoming more time-consuming and taking much longer with more complexity around regulation, tax and risk appetite. üöÄThe rise of UHNW capital, totaling $80 trillion is now prevalent and constitutes a quarter of Blackstone‚Äôs AUM. This highlights the need for tailored structures to meet their liquidity requirements. üöÄThe use of AI in investment committees, particularly in due diligence is expected to increase, potentially saving up to 50% of time. üöÄ Dry powder is at an all time high in PE, now around $2.4 trillion. The expectation is that deals will pick up as interest starts to fall and the public market valuations suppress making deals more attractive to PE. Together, we can shape a future where diversity, sustainability, and performance go hand in hand. Let's turn these discussions into impactful actions and lead the way toward a more inclusive and successful private markets landscape. Please get in touch if you are also in Berlin and would like to connect. Excited for Day 2 !! #AltumGroup #SuperReturn James Milner\n\nPlease join hosts, the GIIN, IASJ and RJI (Racial Justice Investing Coalition) to learn about the forthcoming cohort. With the growing calls for racial equity in the US and beyond, investors have expressed a desire to use their capital to advance racial equity. To meet this need, the GIIN and partners CapEQ PolicyLink FSG and JUST Capital launched the Advancing Racial Equity theme within IRIS+. This work draws on the collective knowledge and experience of 170+ stakeholders to help investors select impact strategies and adopt recommended sets of metrics that track performance toward racial equity, both through their own policies and practices and through their investments. To advance thoughtful racial equity investing, the @GIIN and by partnering with RJI & IASJ, would like to offer faith-based investors the opportunity to work with peers using industry tools to help them translate their intentions into coherent strategies and actions that target measurable, positive, and intentional real-world impacts.To best support this endeavor and the faith-based community, we are launching a peer group of faith-based asset owners and managers who are interested in advancing racial equity. Here, cohort members will have a dedicated space to shape their IMM approaches through IRIS+, which is the generally accepted system for measuring, managing, and optimizing impact. Learning will take place through reflection and actively answering necessary and foundational questions when dismantling racially inequitable systems and to create an investor framework. The cohort will meet for five sessions (12/7, 1/4, 1/17 or 1/24, 2/8 or 2/22, 2/29) from noon-2p ET, and culminate with an in-person full-day retreat mid to late March. Information Session When Tuesday Nov 7, 2023 ‚ãÖ 11am ‚Äì 12pm (Eastern Time - New York\n\nI consider myself truly fortunate to have been invited to attend Evolution Equity Partners #presidentsforum during this week‚Äôs RSA Conference. Dennis Smith and Richard Seewald always curate unbelievable speakers and this year was no different with President Bill Clinton. Hearing from our leaders in turbulent times always carries incredible weight as many of us attempt to find ballast amidst increasing divisiveness. As a teenager finding my way in the 1990‚Äôs, Bill Clinton influenced and defined my passion for the political process, an appreciation of history and what it represented in present day, but most importantly the overriding theme of public-private partnerships and working together as people despite differences of opinion. It often feels like we‚Äôve lost the ability to see each other as humans from the faceless formats of social media, deafening noise of entertainment news and greater problems equals better politics. The comment which resonated most with me and I‚Äôm sure many within the room, ‚Äúanyone who tells you that you get more with subtraction and division versus addition and multiplication is wrong,‚Äù should be echoed more today by all of our leaders. #venturecapital #growthcapital #startup #scaleup #investmentbanking #privateequity #election2024 #politics #economy #leadership\n\nStarting the week energized about the power of racial equity to transform business, and the world. Over the past year, we have seen a loss of some of the momentum for DEI, and racial equity specifically, in businesses and investing that gained so much visibility and impetus coming out of the events of 2020 and the clear understanding that there was much work to be done. This The NonProfit Times piece with Stephanie Rupp and Santhosh Ramdoss is an outstanding review of the progress made, the setbacks, and the opportunities to learn from the progress made in the genders investing movement that can benefit racial equity investing. Yet, it's important to remind ourselves that this is truly win-win for all businesses and investors. It's not only morally and values aligned as global citizens, but it is also clearly beneficial to businesses. As CIO Online notes that inclusive teams are 87% more productive than non-inclusive teams - yet Black founders only raised 0.48% of venture capital in the US. This extends to access to investing opportunities and breaking down barriers for people from under-represented communities to have a seat at the capital table and develop inter-generational wealth transfer opportunities. Marlon Thompson and Future Capital proved this, supporting 700 new investors over three years. Lise Birikundavyi, CFA and BKR Capital is a shining light for the opportunity to support the ecosystem on both sides of the table. It's time to double down, triple down, 10x our commitment to racial equity in business, our teams, and our investments. #equitableaccess #investingforthefuture #impactinvesting #businessforgood #techforgood #venturecapital #dei https://lnkd.in/ddzJq_AF"
