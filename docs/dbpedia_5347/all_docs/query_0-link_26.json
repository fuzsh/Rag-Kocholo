        "text": "Chelsea will work for Blair\n\nChelsea Clinton is one presidential daughter who has no trouble finding work. This time she will be working for one of daddy’s old allies – British Prime Minister Tony Blair.\n\nClinton, 25, has been working with management consulting giant McKinsey since 2003. She will work on a British health-care reform project, which oversees and regulates hospital trust funds, London’s Daily Mail reported. Clinton turned down a job at McKinsey’s London offices before they hired her at their New York City firm.\n\n“Idol” champ signs $1 million record deal\n\nCarrie Underwood, the fourth “American Idol” champion, signed\n\na $1 million recording contact with Arista Records. The country singer’s first single, “Inside Your Heaven,” will be released June 14, paired with her cover of Martina McBride’s “Independence Day.”\n\n…\n\n“The Sopranos” will premiere its sixth – and possibly final – season in March 2006, nearly two years since its last episode aired.\n\nHBO promos airing during last weekend’s broadcast of “Empire Falls” revealed the date. An HBO spokeswoman confirmed the March premiere, but said no specific date had been set, according to the New York Post.\n\nThe fifth season of the mob drama ended June 6, 2004.\n\n…\n\nTen years ago, Halle Berry agreed to appear nude in Playboy magazine, but she never posed for the men’s publication. Playboy picture editor Marilyn Grabowski told the TV gossip show “The Insider”: “She wanted to (do it), but I haven’t heard from her in the last couple of years.”\n\n…\n\nKatie Holmes may have turned down a chance to play drug addict and Andy Warhol protégé Edie Sedgwick based on advice from boyfriend Tom Cruise.\n\nThe New York Post reported Holmes, 26, agreed to appear in “Factory Girl.” She turned down the role because Cruise’s Scientology beliefs prohibit drug use. Holmes’ rep said: “Katie is not attached to that project.”\n\nMeanwhile, after the normally reserved Cruise boldly declared his love for Holmes on “The Oprah Winfrey Show,” agents at CAA, which handles Cruise’s career, “have been frantically pleading” to “rein Tom in” says Radaronline.com.\n\n…\n\nNo one can trump a Trump unless it’s a Trump.\n\nDonald Trump is planning a 64-story Trump International Hotel and Tower in Las Vegas. Construction is slated to start later this year. But his ex-wife Ivana is building a 73-story project – The Ivana – which she calls “the tallest residential building Las Vegas will ever see,” according to Hello! magazine’s website. Her project begins next month.\n\n…\n\nSylvester Stallone has agreed to appear in “Rambo IV,” zap2it.com reported. Production on the third sequel to the 1982 film starring Stallone, 58, as an unstable Vietnam War vet is scheduled to start in January in Sofia, Bulgaria.\n\n…\n\nDenise Richards has given birth to her second daughter, three months after filing for divorce from actor Charlie Sheen, People magazine reported. The baby girl, Lola, was born Wednesday night at a Los Angeles-area hospital. Sheen was in the delivery room, Richards’ publicist said.\n\nRichards’ rep also denied Sheen had moved back into the couple’s home, as reported by Inside TV magazine. “They’re still living apart,” the rep told the New York Daily News.\n\n…\n\n“Last Call With Carson Daly” is relocating from New York to Los Angeles in September, when the NBC late-night show begins its fifth season, the network announced. The show, starring the former MTV host, airs at 1:05 a.m. Monday through Friday on KUSA-Channel 9."
