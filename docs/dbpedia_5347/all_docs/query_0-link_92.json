Tell you a little bit about Randy\n\n00:25and Chelsea and then turn it over to\n\n00:27them to converse and we will listen it\n\n00:30so Randi Hutter Epstein is a medical writer.\n\n00:33A lecture at Yale English Department,\n\n00:34an adjunct professor at\n\n00:36Columbia School of journalism,\n\n00:37and most importantly,\n\n00:38writer in residence here\n\n00:40at IU Medical School.\n\n00:41She has worked as a medical writer for\n\n00:43the London Bureau of the AP was the\n\n00:46London Bureau chief of Physicians Weekly.\n\n00:48Her articles have appeared in many,\n\n00:50many publications,\n\n00:51including the New York Times,\n\n00:52the Washington Post, the Daily Telegraph,\n\n00:54the Guardian, among many,\n\n00:56many other newspapers and magazines.\n\n00:58Randy's first book was entitled,\n\n00:59Get Me Out a history of childbirth from\n\n01:03the garden of Eden to the sperm bank.\n\n01:05In this book she takes the\n\n01:07reader through history,\n\n01:08fads,\n\n01:09and fables and to the fringe of\n\n01:11science were audacious researchers\n\n01:12have gone to extreme measures to\n\n01:14get healthy babies out of mothers.\n\n01:17Her most recent book,\n\n01:18published this summer,\n\n01:19is entitled aroused the history of hormones\n\n01:21and how they control just about everything.\n\n01:24The book tackles the strange\n\n01:25science of hormones and the age old\n\n01:28quest control them for subjects,\n\n01:29and you'll hear a lot more about\n\n01:31this range from leading scientists\n\n01:33who make life changing discoveries\n\n01:35about hormone imbalances.\n\n01:36To Charlatans used those discoveries\n\n01:39to peddle false remedies.\n\n01:41Randy are intra bachelors degree\n\n01:43from the University of Pennsylvania.\n\n01:45In Ms from the Columbia School of\n\n01:47journalism and MD from the Yale\n\n01:49School of Medicine and an MPH from\n\n01:52the Columbia School of Public

communities to\n\n02:11build better futures.\n\n02:12She is an advocate for expanding\n\n02:14access to early childhood education\n\n02:16and providing the next generation of\n\n02:19young leaders with resources they\n\n02:21need to turn their ideas into action.\n\n02:24She is especially interested\n\n02:25in empowering girls and women,\n\n02:27which seems especially appropriate\n\n02:30to mention today.\n\n02:32Chelsea currently teaches at\n\n02:33Columbia's Mailman School of public\n\n02:35health and previously worked at\n\n02:37McKinsey and Company an Ave Capitol.\n\n02:39She holds a

University.\n\n02:49Chelsea is the author of four\n\n02:51books with Debbie Street.\n\n02:53Are she coauthored governing global health?\n\n02:55Who runs the world and why?\n\n02:57Which examines the role of public\n\n02:59private partnerships in combating the\n\n03:01spread of infectious diseases like aids.\n\n03:03And reducing pervasive chronic\n\n03:05health problems like malnutrition.\n\n03:06She authored a book for readers age\n\n03:0910 to 14 called it's your world.\n\n03:12Get informed, get inspired and get going.\n\n03:15And she's also written two picture\n\n03:18books called she persisted 13 American\n\n03:20women who changed the world and the\n\n03:23companion she persisted around the world.\n\n03:25These introduce tiny feminists,\n\n03:27many activists and little kids who\n\n03:29are ready to take on the world to\n\n03:3113 inspirational women who never\n\n03:33took no for an answer and who\n\n03:35always inevitably and without fail,\n\n03:36persisted.\n\n03:40Thank you.\n\n03:44Thank you.\n\n03:48And for that introduction, thank\n\n03:50you to yell into the medical school,\n\n03:53in particular for hosting us today.\n\n03:55I always love the chance to\n\n03:57talk with my good friend Randy.\n\n04:00Always learn a lot from her\n\n04:02and I think as the conversation\n\n04:04progresses this afternoon,\n\n04:06you'll understand why.\n\n04:09Although I was lucky enough to\n\n04:11get an advance copy of aroused,\n\n04:13I reread it over last couple of days\n\n04:16in anticipation of our time together\n\n04:19here and just was again reminded both\n\n04:21by how much kind of we've learned\n\n04:24about our hormones over last century\n\n04:26and how much we still don't know.\n\n04:29So I hope that we can both pro kind of\n\n04:32what we know and what we don't here today.\n\n04:36I will shamelessly exploit my position\n\n04:38in this chair to ask questions.\n\n04:40After about 25 minutes and then we'll\n\n04:42open it up to all of you to ask whatever\n\n04:45questions you may have a Randy,\n\n04:47or if you want to ask me a question,\n\n04:49I'm happy to at least entertain.\n\n04:51It will probably.\n\n04:54But to arouse you know one of the things\n\n04:57ready that we've talked a lot about in\n\n05:00the context of aroused and your other\n\n05:02work is that medicine and Health Sciences\n\n05:04broadly don't exist in isolation,\n\n05:06kind of, from their broader cultural,\n\n05:08social and political contexts.\n\n05:09And one of the things I think you do really\n\n05:13excellent job of an aroused is teasing out,\n\n05:15particularly how culture has influenced\n\n05:17and of what questions were asked,\n\n05:19what research was done,\n\n05:20and also what wasn't done.\n\n05:22Kind of in the city of hormones.\n\n05:24Could you talk a little bit?\n\n05:26About that,\n\n05:27sure, and I think that's the\n\n05:28way I framed the book too.\n\n05:30I don't cover every hormone.\n\n05:31There's alot or everything that's going on,\n\n05:33but I like to look at each\n\n05:35decade or each time period.\n\n05:37Think what does this say about the culture?\n\n05:39Not so much.\n\n05:40What does this say about in advance?\n\n05:42But what does this say about what's\n\n05:44going on so the 1920s, for instance,\n\n05:461920s into the early 1930s?\n\n05:47We were very curious.\n\n05:49What are the ovaries secrete ING?\n\n05:50What are the testes secrete ING\n\n05:52it was around the time that\n\n05:54we then isolated testosterone.\n\n05:55The 1930s and R.\n\n05:56Focus both from a scientific perspective\n\n05:59but also pushed by consumers was what\n\n06:01can we do with these male hormones?\n\n06:03What could testicles do?\n\n06:04Do we need extra ones from animals\n\n06:07so at the same time when there were\n\n06:09doctors and scientists navigating,\n\n06:11I think a lot of their research\n\n06:14then was shaped was how can we\n\n06:16distinguish what makes a man a man\n\n06:19and what makes a woman a woman?\n\n06:21So these sex hormones then became\n\n06:23estrogen equals woman test testosterone\n\n06:25equals male and in some ways.\n\n06:27Made a divide that doesn't that that we\n\n06:30learned quickly after doesn't exist,\n\n06:32but that Binary has stuck with\n\n06:34us and then again in the 1950s.\n\n06:37I talk about the explosion of the\n\n06:39youth of human growth hormone from\n\n06:41pituitary glands before we had synthetic.\n\n06:43What drove it?\n\n06:44It wasn't just doctors saying I'm going\n\n06:47to dump all this growth hormone on kids,\n\n06:50but it was people reading magazines.\n\n06:52That said,\n\n06:52You're short boys are doomed never to marry,\n\n06:55never to get hired.\n\n06:56They're going to have something we coined\n\n06:59the term inferiority complex came out.\n\n07:01Of this growth hormone and the potential\n\n07:04that it could help young boys,\n\n07:06so I think at each generation we see\n\n07:08this mix of what scientists are doing,\n\n07:11what doctors believe in,\n\n07:13but also how were all swayed by the\n\n07:16culture and what patients are demanding\n\n07:18and what their fears are of the time.\n\n07:21and\n\n07:21I think we. All probably\n\n07:25intuitively understand just.\n\n07:28I would submit from the.\n\n07:30Historical moment we're living\n\n07:32through today something that you\n\n07:34also show to be true kind of in.\n\n07:37In in medicine.\n\n07:38Which is that kind of in\n\n07:41moments of uncertainty,\n\n07:42particularly when we think about our health,\n\n07:45or arguably, even more potently,\n\n07:47our Children's Health were vulnerable\n\n07:50to textures and fraudsters.\n\n07:52An I think you do a tremendous job above.\n\n07:55Kind of illuminating how that\n\n07:57isn't something that only\n\n07:59happened like in yesteryear.\n\n08:01It's something that's happening today.\n\n08:03Could you talk a little bit about why,\n\n08:06particularly in the field of\n\n08:09hormones you think?\n\n08:11Kind of the cons have been so successful\n\n08:14because we love certainty.\n\n08:15I mean everybody.\n\n08:16That's a doctor out there and anyone\n\n08:18that's going to be a doctor soon knows\n\n08:21that you're taught in medical school.\n\n08:23Nothing is 100% sure everything's\n\n08:24side affects life has a side effect.\n\n08:27Everything is a side effect.\n\n08:28You can never say to a patient.\n\n08:31This is I'm going to make you happier.\n\n08:33I'm going to make you better,\n\n08:35but and this is what I\n\n08:37learned from my research,\n\n08:39I know how to be a really Good Charlotte him.\n\n08:42And I have advice for anyone out there\n\n08:44and you know this is not how I thought.\n\n08:48I didn't think it was only\n\n08:50have to work nine to five.\n\n08:52Snake oil you only afterwards debating.\n\n08:54Yeah only work nine to\n\n08:56five you never take call.\n\n08:58Don't take insurance and\n\n08:59you can charge a lot. But\n\n09:02here's the trick\n\n09:03you see your\n\n09:04soul, you right you have to be sure you\n\n09:08have to take some by the hand and say.\n\n09:11Your doctors are too worried.\n\n09:13And with all these numbers and\n\n09:15facts and data I care about,\n\n09:18you don't listen to those reports\n\n09:20that say 70% likelier this statistic.\n\n09:23I'm going to tell you what to eat,\n\n09:26what supplement to take, and don't worry.\n\n09:29It's not a pharmaceutical scary drug.\n\n09:31It's a really health supplement.\n\n09:33Healthy supplement.\n\n09:34An why you know.\n\n09:36It's so healthy because,\n\n09:37unlike the stuff that goes,\n\n09:39gets approved from the FDA.\n\n09:41That has to have a warning label in it.\n\n09:45Supplements don't have to have the\n\n09:47warning label an have all those things so\n\n09:49actually from your patient's point of view,\n\n09:52if there's not a warning label\n\n09:54that says side effects may include.\n\n09:57The notion could be Oh well,\n\n09:59then it's 100% hell.\n\n10:00So I think we we can't help,\n\n10:03but it's like a human thing.\n\n10:05We want control an if you notice,\n\n10:07the title is how they control us, not people.\n\n10:10They say you're going to tell us\n\n10:12how we can control our hormones.\n\n10:14Not yet,\n\n10:15but maybe I'm just come back 50 years.\n\n10:17We will.\n\n10:18But people want surety and they want\n\n10:20someone to hold their hand and say,\n\n10:22here's exactly what you have to do so\n\n10:25we can laugh about stuff that went\n\n10:27on in the 1920s when men were told,\n\n10:30you know.\n\n10:30Have a vast ectomy it's going\n\n10:32to boost your libido haha.\n\n10:34Can't believe they fell for that,\n\n10:35but you can click on Amazon\n\n10:37and don't do it now.\n\n10:39'cause I'll feel bad if you\n\n10:40start going on the Internet now,\n\n10:42but you can buy an oxytocin nasal spray\n\n10:44for only for under $50.00 for $48.00.\n\n10:47It could just be water,\n\n10:48it could be air but it is promoted to\n\n10:51spray around yourself and the person\n\n10:53next to you will want to bond with you.\n\n10:56So.\n\n10:57You know, but it sounds funny,\n\n10:59but if you go,\n\n11:01if you if you go on line,\n\n11:03these things are being sold and when\n\n11:06we were talking earlier today though,\n\n11:08you kind of had a an update\n\n11:10to the story of one of the.\n\n11:13Doctors, who has been promoting oxytocin\n\n11:15as this kind of magical elixir to solve\n\n11:18any and all challenges in ones life.\n\n11:21and I will say reading it not only is\n\n11:23someone who cares deeply about public health,\n\n11:26but also as a mother.\n\n11:30This woman, you Randy kind of orients the\n\n11:33oxytocin chapter around who is Obi Wan has\n\n11:36been experimenting on her own children,\n\n11:39so not only did this clearly horrify me\n\n11:42for all of the kind of evident reasons,\n\n11:45from a kind of a public health in a\n\n11:49research integrity perspective like.\n\n11:52She clearly had sold the Contax herself.\n\n11:56Which that is it? Pretty extraordinary.\n\n12:01Dynamic and yet she may not be\n\n12:03getting away with it, so Randy\n\n12:05could you kind of give the other or yeah,\n\n12:08the update is so in the book I write about\n\n12:11a health clinic that I visited a woman\n\n12:13who left her job is an OBGYN at UCLA and\n\n12:17opened up a health clinic on Wilshire Blvd.\n\n12:19And you walk through her\n\n12:21shop to get it's beautiful.\n\n12:22It looks like a spot and you walk\n\n12:24through her shop where she sells her\n\n12:27own brand of adrenal booster,\n\n12:28prostate booster.\n\n12:29All these supplements In addition\n\n12:31to oxy Towson.\n\n12:32Yeah, I think her oxytocin,\n\n12:34which she gave me one.\n\n12:35I think it was a piece of candy.\n\n12:37It just tasted like sugar.\n\n12:39I don't think anything gotten me but she did.\n\n12:41She took one,\n\n12:42she gave me when she gave her\n\n12:43sister went to get her publicist\n\n12:45one and then they all said I feel\n\n12:47like we're bonding and she said I\n\n12:50do too and we all huddled closer.\n\n12:53And I didn't feel anything.\n\n12:57But so I I felt a little a little guilty\n\n13:00making her look sort of silly in my chapter,\n\n13:03though I did do a lot of research and it\n\n13:07did bother me that she is charging people a\n\n13:10fortune for some of this cockamamie stuff.\n\n13:13And calling herself an Ender\n\n13:15Chronologist just because she sells\n\n13:17hormone supplements, but I felt.\n\n13:21I felt justified a few days ago.\n\n13:23Actually was September 13th.\n\n13:25She made it into People magazine for missing\n\n13:27a uterine cancer for having patient an.\n\n13:30If she missed another cancer as well.\n\n13:32She is right now I'm not allowed\n\n13:34to call herself an OBGYN.\n\n13:36She certainly not allowed to\n\n13:38call herself an endocrinologist,\n\n13:39'cause you can't if you've never been\n\n13:41board certified or done endocrinology.\n\n13:43Who knew?\n\n13:46An and she's basically being.\n\n13:48She's on parole.\n\n13:49She might have her license taken away.\n\n13:51Now. Her response.\n\n13:52I thought that was bad enough,\n\n13:55like if I were her,\n\n13:56which I wouldn't be her.\n\n13:58But if I were her I would have gone on\n\n14:02vacation or just let this fade away.\n\n14:04But she actually had a rebuttal,\n\n14:06which I didn't tell you about.\n\n14:09We're talking.\n\n14:09Her rebuttal was basically I am offering\n\n14:12patients things that the medical\n\n14:14community doesn't appreciate yet.\n\n14:15I represent the future of Medicine.\n\n14:18And so many of my patients have done well,\n\n14:21so she's just digging in and standing\n\n14:23her ground for an I think she has\n\n14:26a lot of believers out there like\n\n14:28don't believe established medicine\n\n14:30there too slow there just so stuck\n\n14:33on this evidence based stuff.\n\n14:35But I've got a big business and\n\n14:37a lot of my patients love me.\n\n14:40Suzanne Somers.\n\n14:40Sarah Ferguson.\n\n14:41She's got a lot of testimonies.\n\n14:43An as we know now and then and his\n\n14:46doctors practicing testimonials\n\n14:47really sway public perception.\n\n14:50You're one of the I think,\n\n14:53heartening elements of that story is\n\n14:56that there is some accountability,\n\n14:59maybe too late, arguably,\n\n15:01but there is some accountability.\n\n15:03And yet you're.\n\n15:04Your book is full of kind of\n\n15:07stories of accountability that came\n\n15:09kind of decades after the fact.\n\n15:12And when you first started working\n\n15:14on this, I was.\n\n15:16So struck a few years ago we were\n\n15:18having a conversation by how much\n\n15:21kind of you were teaching me around\n\n15:24the story of human growth hormone and\n\n15:27also how much you were teaching me around.\n\n15:30Kind of the science of fertility,\n\n15:32which was a kind of outgrowth of your.\n\n15:36Book Get Me Out.\n\n15:37One of the great titles ever of a book.\n\n15:41An so I wonder if you could just\n\n15:43share a little bit about what\n\n15:45surprised you the most,\n\n15:47and writing this book and kind\n\n15:48of what you learned the most\n\n15:50from in writing aroused.\n\n15:53Well, a few things.\n\n15:56One of the things I don't think I\n\n15:58don't know if I wanna say surprise no,\n\n16:01I will say surprised the power of the\n\n16:03individual person to do something.\n\n16:04So not just doctors.\n\n16:06I mean there's some amazing scientists.\n\n16:07I don't just write about cockamamie stuff,\n\n16:09I write and I someone asked me if I\n\n16:12intentionally sought after female\n\n16:13scientist that did wonderful things.\n\n16:15I didn't intentionally do it.\n\n16:16We're probably on some subconscious thing.\n\n16:18I read about them like you need a\n\n16:20voice like you need to be known.\n\n16:23So I do highlight some amazing\n\n16:24female scientists,\n\n16:25especially in the 1930s and 40s that had to.\n\n16:28Really work hard to get their name be heard,\n\n16:31but that wasn't surprising.\n\n16:32One of the stories that surprised me\n\n16:35was a mom in Long Island who was told\n\n16:37that her son needed growth hormone.\n\n16:39I won't get into all the details 'cause\n\n16:41I could go on forever about this story,\n\n16:44but it was the 1960s where\n\n16:46people were worried about.\n\n16:47Can we use this new growth hormone?\n\n16:49'cause my son might be way too short.\n\n16:51It was just isolated.\n\n16:53This one brought her son\n\n16:54to the doctor and she said,\n\n16:56you know we've tried thyroid which was.\n\n16:58Tried for short kids and this doctor said\n\n17:00other people will give him testosterone.\n\n17:02I'm not going to try that 'cause\n\n17:05it doesn't work. But we could try.\n\n17:07Growth hormone was from Pituitaries,\n\n17:08then we didn't have synthetic.\n\n17:10We could try growth hormone and the\n\n17:12mom was like sure you know will\n\n17:14try this and so,\n\n17:15but you're going to have to collect your own.\n\n17:17You're going to have if you can bring me\n\n17:20pituitary zan I now know Barbara Balaban.\n\n17:22This mom,\n\n17:23who she thinks now in retrospect the\n\n17:25Doctor was instead of just saying\n\n17:26forget about it. We can help you.\n\n17:28The doctor was more like you get your\n\n17:31own pituitaries we can isolate the\n\n17:33growth hormone and treat your son.\n\n17:35Barbara Balaban was just not just.\n\n17:37She was a mom in Long Island who,\n\n17:40within three months became one of\n\n17:43the nation's leading collectors\n\n17:44of pituitary glands,\n\n17:46third only to the VA in the NIH.\n\n17:50And I spoke to doctor Bob Blizzard\n\n17:52who is with who is on the medical\n\n17:55side collecting them.\n\n17:56And he did say we were going around\n\n17:58asking people to donate pituitary\n\n18:00glands pathologists and they would say,\n\n18:02sorry, we've already promised Balaban.\n\n18:04Sorry, we've already promised Balaban,\n\n18:05and he was like, what's a Balaban?\n\n18:07And he ends up at her door in Great\n\n18:10Neck Long Island, saying, like, who are you?\n\n18:13And she had?\n\n18:14She kept him in nail Polish remover,\n\n18:16acetone in jars,\n\n18:17in her laundry room,\n\n18:18and eventually she joined forces.\n\n18:21Because Bob Blizzard,\n\n18:21who died recently and was a leading\n\n18:23figure in pediatric endocrinology,\n\n18:25sore right away that he did not want growth\n\n18:28hormone only to be available to those,\n\n18:30either with the moxy or the money to get it.\n\n18:33So he asked her to join forces and\n\n18:36said We'll always have enough for\n\n18:38your son as long as we share it\n\n18:40so that it could be shared evenly.\n\n18:43So she did. So then she became\n\n18:45part of this government task force,\n\n18:47but it's amazing to me what\n\n18:49one woman can just do.\n\n18:51She felt she needed to treat her son.\n\n18:53I think a lot of moms probably\n\n18:55would have felt the same way.\n\n18:57Hertrich If anyone wants to know and\n\n18:59my mom in the audience will love this.\n\n19:02She said the reason why she became\n\n19:03one of the leading national\n\n19:05pituitary gland collectors is she\n\n19:07wrote a handwritten thank you note\n\n19:09to every single person that\n\n19:10gave her a pituitary.\n\n19:13Send so that will be one takeaway lesson.\n\n19:16Handwritten thank you notes.\n\n19:17I love handwritten, thank you know. So I'm\n\n19:19going to take away that Randy can\n\n19:21teach you how to be a charlatan and\n\n19:23that I am teach my children how to\n\n19:26write handwritten thank you notes.\n\n19:27Our key takeaways from today.\n\n19:31So Randy, one of the things that\n\n19:33kind of you alluded to earlier,\n\n19:35but I know you feel kind of passionately\n\n19:38about bringing more kind of into the light,\n\n19:40is how gender was constructed\n\n19:42at a particular moment in time.\n\n19:44And arguably we've been kind of\n\n19:46dealing with the consequences\n\n19:48of that kind of since then,\n\n19:50and are still trying to kind of\n\n19:52move away from kind of this one\n\n19:54decision that was made, you know,\n\n19:56a handful of decades ago.\n\n19:58Could you talk a bit about?\n\n20:01Kind of why there was that decision\n\n20:02to kind of quantify gender is this\n\n20:05idea and what the consequences\n\n20:06have been. Yeah, I mean I go back to.\n\n20:09I mean, we think now transgender\n\n20:11people have a trans gender\n\n20:12identity and I do right about that.\n\n20:15But really, the concept of gender.\n\n20:16It really was only used in\n\n20:18grammar up until the 1950s.\n\n20:20And then it Hoppin Johns Hopkins.\n\n20:21There was someone named John\n\n20:23money very controversial figure,\n\n20:24but he was the one that said it's not just\n\n20:27whether you have an over your testes.\n\n20:29It's not just XX or XY.\n\n20:31It's your identity which\n\n20:33is made up of a whole.\n\n20:34How you, how you consider yourself\n\n20:36what your chromosomes are,\n\n20:38what you're going ads are,\n\n20:39and he actually coined this term.\n\n20:41Gender to be used so it was something\n\n20:43that we think of as always been around,\n\n20:46but before then we said what's\n\n20:48your sex not what's your gender.\n\n20:50And again,\n\n20:51there's been I've reached out to a lot\n\n20:53of people in the Intersex community.\n\n20:55People in the transgender community?\n\n20:57Some of them, I think,\n\n20:58felt that I wasn't angry enough in my\n\n21:01chapter of intersects that I write.\n\n21:03Because I don't blame,\n\n21:04I don't know 100% blame the doctors\n\n21:07for what they did I don't think the\n\n21:09doctors in the 1950s were out to say\n\n21:12how can we manipulate people and how\n\n21:14can we make this decision that we\n\n21:17don't care what's going to happen.\n\n21:19I think there was this strong\n\n21:21feeling in the 1950s and 60s of\n\n21:23these children will be better off\n\n21:25looking clearly masculine or looking\n\n21:27clearly what we think is feminine.\n\n21:29I write about a woman in my book\n\n21:32who was unfortunately born in 1956,\n\n21:34right at that peak.\n\n21:36Of learning what we thought\n\n21:37about gender and the theory then,\n\n21:40was that up until 18 months,\n\n21:42gender was malleable,\n\n21:43so you were born a blank slate.\n\n21:46We weren't thinking prenatal influences\n\n21:48and that you had up until that 18\n\n21:51month cutoff to make a decision.\n\n21:53All you had to do was like switch\n\n21:55trucks to dolls and change\n\n21:57pants to dresses and this woman.\n\n22:00What did happen with her was that she\n\n22:02was born with ambiguous genitalia,\n\n22:05but they said to her.\n\n22:07They said to the mom.\n\n22:09You have a son though he has abnormal\n\n22:11genitalia. You have a son.\n\n22:13Then there were some other issues.\n\n22:14They brought him back to the\n\n22:16doctor at 17 months.\n\n22:17So before that cutoff and then the\n\n22:20doctor said actually made a mistake.\n\n22:21You have a daughter so just sign\n\n22:23here and she showed me all her\n\n22:25medical records in the form and\n\n22:27there's just one form.\n\n22:29That said, I agree to change Brian to Bonnie.\n\n22:31Mom signed your name,\n\n22:32throw out all the pictures,\n\n22:34get rid of his man clothes,\n\n22:36put in girl closed dolls and don't worry,\n\n22:38it's before the 18 month cutoff.\n\n22:40So as you can imagine,\n\n22:42she had a very troubled upbringing\n\n22:44and now she's very involved\n\n22:45in the Intersex community,\n\n22:47and she's very angry because in those\n\n22:49days also she had surgery done right away.\n\n22:52The doctor said I'm going\n\n22:54to do exploratory surgery.\n\n22:55He came out and said, We realized\n\n22:57that she had an enlarged clitoris.\n\n23:00We amputated all of it.\n\n23:01We also realized that she's a hermaphrodite.\n\n23:04She has some testes and ovaries\n\n23:06and they wrote that in her\n\n23:08chart the languages changed.\n\n23:09Since then an I think.\n\n23:11We, but again,\n\n23:12I don't think these doctors were\n\n23:14doing this because they were evil\n\n23:16and trying to figure out we're\n\n23:18going to just freak these kids out.\n\n23:20They were doing what they\n\n23:21thought of the time that.\n\n23:23Let's try to make these kids feel normal.\n\n23:25It was the 50s and 60s.\n\n23:27You wanted to feel like a full\n\n23:29woman or a full man and you wanted\n\n23:31to raise your kids that way.\n\n23:33We are now realizing that this should\n\n23:35not be emergency emergency surgery.\n\n23:37The surgery that was done is\n\n23:39really considered cosmetic.\n\n23:39It shouldn't be done anymore.\n\n23:42Apparently it still is,\n\n23:43but there is this voice going out to say.\n\n23:46You can tell you can explain to\n\n23:48parents slowly if your child is\n\n23:50born with ambiguous genitalia.\n\n23:52There's many syndromes.\n\n23:53It's a big balloon umbrella term\n\n23:55for many different elements in\n\n23:56the Doctor can explain to exactly\n\n23:58what it is an nothing.\n\n24:00No cosmetic surgery needs to\n\n24:01be done right at birth,\n\n24:03so and there is an activist community.\n\n24:05Again,\n\n24:05it's coming from the patients themselves\n\n24:08that are figuring out the language\n\n24:10we talked a lot about language and\n\n24:12words and the importance of words.\n\n24:14There,\n\n24:14they've driven this.\n\n24:15They've driven the issue of We don't\n\n24:18want to be called him Aphrodite.\n\n24:20We want to be called intersects\n\n24:23or differences in developmental\n\n24:25in sexual development.\n\n24:27And again,\n\n24:27this then sort of goes in people\n\n24:30with who identifies transgender\n\n24:32that is very different.\n\n24:34They weren't born with ambiguous genitalia,\n\n24:36but they do feel and they they\n\n24:38know down to the core that how\n\n24:41they identify doesn't match\n\n24:43their external genitalia.\n\n24:44And again,\n\n24:45these are issues now that doctors\n\n24:47and experts are grappling with\n\n24:49and trying to understand.\n\n24:51I was very moved the reading that chapter\n\n24:55in particular the solidarity between.\n\n24:58The woman whose story is so painful\n\n25:00to read as a parent because I have no\n\n25:03doubt that her parents thought they\n\n25:05were doing the right thing for her\n\n25:08in 1956 and when she had subsequent\n\n25:10surgery also still as a child.\n\n25:12But how she and others are really\n\n25:14supporting parents today who\n\n25:16also have Intersex children.\n\n25:17And that was a moment of.\n\n25:21Of hope kind of in that otherwise quite\n\n25:24depressing chapter.\n\n25:25Yeah, and I think Bo she calls herself.\n\n25:29She's been Brian then Bonnie\n\n25:31and now calls herself bow.\n\n25:33She really was one of the\n\n25:36founders of this movement.\n\n25:38Accidentally she read in.\n\n25:41In the Sciences magazine\n\n25:42a doctor Fausto Sterling,\n\n25:44who's an anthropologist or sociologist,\n\n25:46but a very brilliant woman\n\n25:47at Brown University,\n\n25:49wrote an article from that point of view,\n\n25:52saying we shouldn't really have two genders.\n\n25:54There should be 5 genders.\n\n25:56It's in a short piece, and this was in,\n\n25:59Oh, the 1993 and so she and she wrote,\n\n26:03highlighting not really going into an\n\n26:05biggest genitalia, but just talking.\n\n26:07But there's.\n\n26:07There's a whole spectrum.\n\n26:10Bo wrote a letter to the\n\n26:13editor saying I was born.\n\n26:15Intersects I think she used that term.\n\n26:17I was born Intersex and actually I have a\n\n26:20foundation or a organization for anybody.\n\n26:22That's like me.\n\n26:23She didn't at the time.\n\n26:25She just said I have this\n\n26:27organization for anyone.\n\n26:28That's like me that wants to reach out.\n\n26:30She just felt that there's no\n\n26:33way I could be the only one.\n\n26:36And I think she gave her mailing\n\n26:39address or home address and she was.\n\n26:41She thought that maybe she'd here\n\n26:44from 5 people and they could get\n\n26:47together and have a meeting.\n\n26:49It basically became a full time job.\n\n26:51She was flooded with letters\n\n26:52saying I thought I was the only\n\n26:54one I thought I was the only one\n\n26:56and that's how the intersects.\n\n26:58I mean that's there're other\n\n26:59people too and she doesn't like\n\n27:01when I give her full credit,\n\n27:03but a lot of people do give her full credit,\n\n27:06but she's one of the patients that\n\n27:08really got this whole groundswell\n\n27:09grow and going. And Randy,\n\n27:10it's not only the Doctor is kind of in\n\n27:13that chapter, but often you recognize,\n\n27:15I think with real kind of humanity,\n\n27:17not abrogating kind of\n\n27:18responsibility away from them,\n\n27:19but real humanity. How often?\n\n27:21A lot of doctors and other researchers or\n\n27:23are doing the best they can with what they\n\n27:25know and what they believe to be true.\n\n27:28Absolutely, even if sometimes kind of,\n\n27:29they go sideways or backwards\n\n27:31from a scientific perspective.\n\n27:32So you want me to tell the Steinach story.\n\n27:34I do know that was my effort.\n\n27:36Segue into that 'cause I know you\n\n27:38want to talk about it, right?\n\n27:40Yeah? So I\n\n27:41mean one of the points in the\n\n27:42book is that we can't just say,\n\n27:44OK, these are the bad guys\n\n27:46and these are the good guys.\n\n27:48There's a Gray area in between\n\n27:49and one of the things that.\n\n27:51I think we all know is that\n\n27:53some of our leading scientists,\n\n27:55or the ones that see the\n\n27:56data and then make a leap.\n\n27:58So pushing for instance saw the data and\n\n28:00he could barely see in the pituitary.\n\n28:02Then we didn't have the\n\n28:04sophisticated imagery,\n\n28:04but he had this idea that the pituitary\n\n28:07gland probably effects the body.\n\n28:08People thought he was.\n\n28:09There were people that really\n\n28:11thought he was nuts at the time,\n\n28:13but he was right so he took this sleep\n\n28:15and now he could say that's wonderful.\n\n28:17But sometimes people leap\n\n28:18in the wrong direction.\n\n28:20So that's the story I want to talk about.\n\n28:22And they're not always bad guys.\n\n28:24They're brilliant,\n\n28:25but they just happen to a lot of brilliant\n\n28:28things and then some not so brilliant.\n\n28:30Even pushing himself did the first\n\n28:32pituitary transplant and I'll\n\n28:34just tell this little story too.\n\n28:35So we did all these wonderful things\n\n28:38and now everyone believed his mind\n\n28:40body theories and he's famous and he\n\n28:42had a man with a pituitary tumor.\n\n28:44He was 48 years old.\n\n28:46He was complaining of vision\n\n28:48headaches and then pushing.\n\n28:49Thought well 'cause he was\n\n28:51a very daring bold surgeon.\n\n28:53What if I take out his pituitary and\n\n28:55just give him a fresh one from a\n\n28:57baby that was born like a stillborn\n\n28:59baby so it was before the days of IR\n\n29:02BS and all that he just said to his\n\n29:05he called a friend who is an OBGYN\n\n29:07and said if you get a stillborn can\n\n29:10I have the pituitary and I'm going\n\n29:12to send a medical student over to get it.\n\n29:16He did the surgery,\n\n29:17he didn't want to be secret about.\n\n29:19It went right to the press.\n\n29:21You know, baby brain cures man\n\n29:24broken brain cured by baby.\n\n29:26Then it crushing thought that worked,\n\n29:28but you know, of course, the man that\n\n29:31had this nonfunctioning pituitary.\n\n29:32So after a month or so symptoms came back.\n\n29:35He wasn't feeling well.\n\n29:36Cushing did it again because he still\n\n29:38thought he was on the right path.\n\n29:40Same medical students, same doctor,\n\n29:42and this time, the man eventually died.\n\n29:44Cushing, who was a, uh?\n\n29:47Great surgeon artists,\n\n29:48Pulitzer Prize winning author.\n\n29:50Didn't like to admit his mistakes,\n\n29:53shocking.\n\n29:54So what he said was he was nearing\n\n29:58the end of Hickory.\n\n30:00Did not try to do this again,\n\n30:03but he blamed the medical student for\n\n30:05not getting for not going fast enough\n\n30:07to get the pattern and bring it back.\n\n30:10And he blamed the OBGYN for not dissecting\n\n30:13it properly but he didn't try it again.\n\n30:15So he made a mistake.\n\n30:17The story that I'm slowly getting\n\n30:19to is Eugene Steinach who was\n\n30:21a scientist in Vienna who did\n\n30:22Nobel Prize winning research.\n\n30:24If anyone's heard his name\n\n30:26now it's 'cause we think\n\n30:27he was the one that started the whole 1920s.\n\n30:30Vasectomies boost libido.\n\n30:32And he never did the operations,\n\n30:34but he promoted that theory.\n\n30:36But he wasn't a charlatan, quack,\n\n30:38trying to get his surgeon friends,\n\n30:41a lot of money from doing worthless\n\n30:44vasectomies to boost libido. He did.\n\n30:46His original research was saying that\n\n30:48the interstitial cell produced male\n\n30:49hormone testosterone wasn't made yet.\n\n30:51I love the story in a in a few ways,\n\n30:54because he was right about that.\n\n30:56Many of his colleagues nominated\n\n30:57him 11 times for the Nobel Prize.\n\n30:59He didn't get the Nobel Prize.\n\n31:01'cause as we know,\n\n31:02all prizes are kind of subjective.\n\n31:04Alot of people on the Nobel committee at\n\n31:07that time in the 1920s could not believe\n\n31:09that the interstitial cell did anything.\n\n31:11They just thought it was connective tissue,\n\n31:13so that I've just recently read was.\n\n31:16The main reason he didn't\n\n31:17get the Nobel Prize?\n\n31:18But then he had a theory that sounds good.\n\n31:22It's just not right that if you kill\n\n31:25off cells in an area or block them,\n\n31:28the other ones will proliferate.\n\n31:30Kind of like weeds,\n\n31:32so that got him thinking.\n\n31:34Oh well, then if you block something\n\n31:37near the interstitial cell,\n\n31:38a Vacek to me would do that.\n\n31:41That'll make more interstitial cells.\n\n31:43Then we'll have more of\n\n31:45whatever this male hormone is,\n\n31:47and that'll make people smarter.\n\n31:49And better libido.\n\n31:50An more wonderful whatever he thought,\n\n31:52all those male characteristics were\n\n31:54so he tested it on rats an he said\n\n31:57he saw they became eroticized,\n\n31:59which my copier said isn't a word\n\n32:01and I'm like that he used it.\n\n32:03He actually coined the term eroticization\n\n32:05and that's what is rats became.\n\n32:07And then they tested it in a man he\n\n32:10didn't have. A colleague did an.\n\n32:12We all know the power of testimony.\n\n32:15The doctor said I want you to now\n\n32:17see if you have a stronger libido\n\n32:20'cause we think this is going\n\n32:22to make your libido better.\n\n32:24And you should feel closer\n\n32:25to your 20 year old self.\n\n32:27And sure enough, he did.\n\n32:28Freud had it done.\n\n32:30He said he felt better.\n\n32:31Yates had it done,\n\n32:32and said even his poetry is\n\n32:34better than it's ever been.\n\n32:38Steinach because the concept of\n\n32:39this ectomy's for libido became\n\n32:41so popular here in America,\n\n32:43that Steinbeck's name became a verb.\n\n32:45So people were getting Stein Act all over.\n\n32:48There were doctors saying\n\n32:50this doesn't make sense.\n\n32:51This is testimony.\n\n32:52But as you know testimony held\n\n32:54sway and it didn't fade because\n\n32:57doctors finally convinced people.\n\n32:58I think this is placebo.\n\n33:00It's Wade because we isolated testosterone\n\n33:03and you don't have to grab the Vacek to me.\n\n33:06You could just.\n\n33:07One day get testosterone gel well and\n\n33:10Randy tells the story of a band in\n\n33:12London who had it done and rented the\n\n33:14Royal Albert Hall to kind of prove his\n\n33:16reality is going to stand on sat on\n\n33:18stage and let people asking questions\n\n33:20forever and ever and he had a heart\n\n33:23attack and died the night before.\n\n33:25Oh yes, hopefully he lived a good,\n\n33:27robust life until then. So\n\n33:29I want to\n\n33:30open it up to\n\n33:32questions. I know we have roving Mike's,\n\n33:34I think will take audience questions\n\n33:37for about 20 or so minutes.\n\n33:39And then I want to ask\n\n33:41Randy concluding question.\n\n33:42And if none of you raise your hands,\n\n33:45although you don't strike\n\n33:46me as a retiring audience,\n\n33:48but if no one raises your hands,\n\n33:51I'm happy to keep asking questions.\n\n33:53So with that preamble, dots.\n\n33:55Questions comments for Randy.\n\n33:59No no yes.\n\n34:10It's OK, we can hear you too. I can repeat\n\n34:12the question will repeat a mole.\n\n34:14Repeat the question case.\n\n34:18People live.\n\n34:22Charlie.\n\n34:26For example.\n\n34:29Right?\n\n34:33That\n\n34:38Ha. OK, so the question was for\n\n34:42anyone that didn't hear it.\n\n34:44Why do people gravitate to goop over them?\n\n34:47Their family practitioner anan.\n\n34:48Why are people distrustful of Medicine?\n\n34:51and I do think it goes back to were\n\n34:54trained as physicians to explain the pros\n\n34:57and cons of everything an there's this\n\n35:00damn uncertainty that people don't want\n\n35:03to hear about and so things like goop.\n\n35:06I think there's a number of reasons one.\n\n35:09There's surety, even though it's fake,\n\n35:12there's surety in it.\n\n35:15And there's testimonies, and there's some.\n\n35:17You know it's interesting\n\n35:18because people will say, Oh,\n\n35:20I don't believe what I read.\n\n35:22They do believe what's in the media.\n\n35:25and I also think that as doctors,\n\n35:27it's important to keep up with what's\n\n35:29going on and what your patients are\n\n35:32hearing rather than just dismiss\n\n35:34it outright because your patients\n\n35:36want you to have an open mind.\n\n35:38So rather than say which you\n\n35:40just want to say,\n\n35:42and I'd want to say like that's from goop.\n\n35:45It's ridiculous.\n\n35:46Don't go there.\n\n35:47I think we have this history\n\n35:48sometimes of doctors,\n\n35:49and I'd probably be the same way\n\n35:51that you just get so annoyed and\n\n35:53angry that someone would do that\n\n35:54and you just want to say honestly,\n\n35:56don't do that.\n\n35:57Here's what you're supposed to do.\n\n35:58It might be better not take an hour,\n\n36:01but a few moments just to say I get it.\n\n36:03I know where you're coming from.\n\n36:05I know you think that you're tired\n\n36:06because you have adrenal fatigue syndrome,\n\n36:08but can I just explain to you?\n\n36:10I know this is where this is coming from,\n\n36:13but here's what I'm worried about.\n\n36:14If you do that.\n\n36:15And here's what I think can help,\n\n36:17and I think so much of it sounds so trite,\n\n36:20but so much of it does come down to doctor\n\n36:22patient relationships and just taking those.\n\n36:24I mean that didn't take me that\n\n36:26long to say that just taking that,\n\n36:28you know,\n\n36:28'cause everyone complaints.\n\n36:29I don't have an hour,\n\n36:31but it doesn't take an hour\n\n36:32just to be a little open minded.\n\n36:34And also I do think like flip\n\n36:36through you don't buy it but flip\n\n36:38through some of these magazines.\n\n36:39Go on the website, see what's out there.\n\n36:41I not only think it's good\n\n36:43to know what's out there,\n\n36:44but it will explain your patience.\n\n36:46Fears 'cause I think what's being sold.\n\n36:48Some of those people are really savvy\n\n36:50about knowing what people are afraid of.\n\n36:53Old age.\n\n36:53Loss of libido.\n\n36:54I don't know, Gray hair or whatever you know.\n\n36:58But I think sometimes we don't\n\n37:00realize what our patients,\n\n37:01your patience.\n\n37:02I don't have any.\n\n37:03You don't realize what your\n\n37:05patients are afraid of and so\n\n37:07it's good to keep an open mind to\n\n37:09be reading that just so that you\n\n37:12know where these market forces\n\n37:13are random. I think first bonded over.\n\n37:16Our distress about the Anti Vaccine Movement,\n\n37:20which is another kind of iteration\n\n37:23of this same challenge and as\n\n37:27I have said before, I'm not.\n\n37:31I'm really not a vindictive person at all,\n\n37:33which is probably healthy for me in my life.\n\n37:37The only person the only person\n\n37:39really that I have a real vendetta\n\n37:41against his Andrew Wakefield.\n\n37:43There's a special place in\n\n37:45hell for him,\n\n37:46and and I say that because\n\n37:47he has and continues to be a\n\n37:49destructive force and I keep telling\n\n37:51my friends in England I can't.\n\n37:53You just take him back and we don't want\n\n37:56him here in the United States any longer,\n\n37:58but I think that he is sadly\n\n38:01the the archetype of this.\n\n38:03Of the prediction on fear.\n\n38:05On the appeal to.\n\n38:07I'm kind of in the apparent\n\n38:10best instincts in the kind of\n\n38:14worst and most malfeasant ways.\n\n38:17Other questions in the white coat\n\n38:19with white could then I don't know any\n\n38:21vendors and I realize it's also not very\n\n38:24particular. Thank you know you\n\n38:25can't see my paint out really point\n\n38:28in your direction.\n\n38:29Really wonderful presentation so far.\n\n38:30My name is Tara Sam from one of the\n\n38:33oncologists here and I'm sort of along\n\n38:35the lines of the gentleman before me.\n\n38:37You know in cancer care something like 85%\n\n38:40of our patients take supplements and we\n\n38:42either don't ask or they don't tell us,\n\n38:44but they're doing it anyway.\n\n38:46So just curious about your thoughts.\n\n38:48Of how we might be able to\n\n38:50take it even a step further,\n\n38:51not just being aware of it\n\n38:53or asking about it, but.\n\n38:55Should we embrace,\n\n38:56you know some of these integrative and\n\n38:59supplemental practices to 1st do no harm,\n\n39:02but maybe how some of these\n\n39:04services within cancer centers\n\n39:06so that patients have a place to.\n\n39:09Come to talk to people about alternative\n\n39:11and complementary treatments.\n\n39:12I should say complementary.\n\n39:13Not alternative,\n\n39:14but you know,\n\n39:14we're sort of on the verge of\n\n39:17some of that here,\n\n39:18and I know other cancer centers are doing it.\n\n39:20And if we don't do it,\n\n39:22I feel like they're just going to\n\n39:24go out to these private boutiques\n\n39:26where they pay a lot of money to\n\n39:28take a lot of supplements that could\n\n39:30do harm and and so I'm just curious\n\n39:33about your thoughts on what our\n\n39:35role is in the medical profession.\n\n39:36To address some of it may be embrace.\n\n39:39Some of\n\n39:39it I do think it's a good idea to\n\n39:41embrace some of some of the things of\n\n39:43like yoga and massage and meditation.\n\n39:45An I know that there are centers that\n\n39:47will tell patients we don't know if\n\n39:49this is going to make you live longer.\n\n39:51An it doesn't mean you weren't\n\n39:53meditating the right way.\n\n39:54If it doesn't help,\n\n39:55but we do know it can help make\n\n39:57you feel better along the way.\n\n39:59and I do think that show.\n\n40:00Patients that you do have this open mind,\n\n40:03but yeah, I do think that it allows\n\n40:05them then to maybe open up and shows\n\n40:07that you're more open minded to\n\n40:08tell you about their supplements.\n\n40:10When I was in the gym the other day\n\n40:12and I heard like look like a 20 year\n\n40:14old trainer telling someone hears\n\n40:16the supplements I'd like you to take.\n\n40:18He was talking to like a 60 year old man\n\n40:21and I was like do I do I get into this kind?\n\n40:24do I inject myself and I can hear my girls\n\n40:27saying even though they weren't there?\n\n40:29No stay out of it.\n\n40:30Stay out of it.\n\n40:32But Fortunately,\n\n40:32as he would listed all the supplements\n\n40:34that this guy should by the response\n\n40:36right as I was about to interrupt,\n\n40:38he said, you know,\n\n40:39I've had a history of the\n\n40:41patient or the train.\n\n40:42The guy working out.\n\n40:43I've had a history of kidney stones.\n\n40:45My doctors told me that,\n\n40:47you know if anyone ever recommends a\n\n40:49supplement to really check it out with him.\n\n40:51So if you can write them down and I'm\n\n40:54going to bring it back to my doctor just\n\n40:56so he knows 'cause it was really painful.\n\n40:59Those kidney stones and I\n\n41:00don't want to do anything.\n\n41:02OK, and I didn't interrupt\n\n41:05even join the conversation.\n\n41:07But yeah,\n\n41:07I do think what you're saying like\n\n41:09rather than say we're not going to\n\n41:11do any of that here because it's\n\n41:13not going to make you live longer\n\n41:15to have to show that you're open to\n\n41:17these suggestions an that if this\n\n41:18makes the journey easier for you,\n\n41:20but we don't want you spending your\n\n41:21money or doing something that can interact,\n\n41:23I think one of the things that\n\n41:26people don't understand is.\n\n41:27That they feel like and I always\n\n41:29try to say people if you think\n\n41:31it's potent enough to do good,\n\n41:33it's got to be potent enough\n\n41:34to have a side effect.\n\n41:36For some reason they get that chemo\n\n41:38can do good things and bad things,\n\n41:40but supplements can only do the good\n\n41:42thing and some might be doing a good thing.\n\n41:44But they also might be doing.\n\n41:46I mean you know this.\n\n41:47I'm telling this to you,\n\n41:49but I do think, yeah,\n\n41:50it's that we should have.\n\n41:52Complementary medicine available.\n\n41:56Other questions, any\n\n41:58questions in the balcony? Yes.\n\n42:04Hi, my name is Molly Dornburg.\n\n42:06I'm a student, the school of\n\n42:08Public Health. I am wondering\n\n42:10how you think about and how you\n\n42:13address in your book the relative. I guess I\n\n42:16would say lack of\n\n42:18intersectionality in this history\n\n42:19in terms of like race, ethnicity,\n\n42:22socioeconomic status, etc. In\n\n42:25terms of medical history,\n\n42:26mean in terms of how and whether\n\n42:29at all this history applies to\n\n42:32people who are non affluent and\n\n42:34nonwhite, I think there's been I mean.\n\n42:38I just look at the history,\n\n42:39not trying to change things,\n\n42:41but I think yeah,\n\n42:42this comes up a lot in what I write and\n\n42:45what I've looked at both in childbirth,\n\n42:47an in hormone therapy we know when the\n\n42:50birth control pill first came out.\n\n42:51It was mainly white women that can afford it,\n\n42:54and then there were fears than\n\n42:56that it was being pushed on.\n\n42:58People on on sterilization\n\n42:59that didn't want it.\n\n43:00So we have this mixed history and\n\n43:02that again it's interesting like\n\n43:03Barbara Balaban for instance,\n\n43:05the one that.\n\n43:07That was the big growth hormone collector.\n\n43:10She's a white woman from Long\n\n43:11Island and she had told me that her\n\n43:14doctor was just kind of nasty to\n\n43:16her an actually I gave a talk here\n\n43:18about that chapter while ago and\n\n43:20someone came up to me and said no.\n\n43:22Actually, she wasn't a nasty doctor,\n\n43:24but the doctor that Barbara Balaban\n\n43:26went to had such a concern to make sure\n\n43:29that hormones were divvied up evenly,\n\n43:31that I think she was annoyed\n\n43:33that this one patient was able\n\n43:35to do so well on her own.\n\n43:36So they had this contentious relationship.\n\n43:38But I do think yes.\n\n43:40It's been.\n\n43:40There's been a whole history of\n\n43:42certain types of medicine that are only\n\n43:44available to those that can afford it.\n\n43:46And it's not just who can afford it,\n\n43:48but also who has the agency\n\n43:50to say to their doctor.\n\n43:51I mean,\n\n43:52my last book was on history of\n\n43:54childbirth an it was always sort\n\n43:55of the women that felt they could\n\n43:57speak up to doctors to say no.\n\n43:59No, you're not doing that to me.\n\n44:01Or yes, you can. So it's this.\n\n44:03Yes,\n\n44:03I I see what you're saying and it's\n\n44:05this long history not just of money,\n\n44:08but of race.\n\n44:09But also,\n\n44:09socioeconomic and a lot of\n\n44:11that informs how much power a\n\n44:13person feels they have to speak\n\n44:15back to their physician and\n\n44:16you do touch on that a little bit in\n\n44:19your eugenics. Yeah, yeah discussion.\n\n44:22Oh Gosh, Yes. Yeah, long hair.\n\n44:27Write code long hair.\n\n44:33Remind\n\n44:44president.\n\n44:57Yeah, hopefully we're getting away from that.\n\n44:59Yeah, and it was. It was like OK,\n\n45:01anti mullerian hormone even in the\n\n45:03beginning 'cause you know we all look\n\n45:06alike in the very beginning when you're in\n\n45:08that little Chris on stage of fetal life.\n\n45:10And then it's when antimalarial\n\n45:12hormone kicks in that you either\n\n45:14choose one fork or the other.\n\n45:16And yes there has been.\n\n45:17I mean some of the quotes are\n\n45:19just amazing in terms of anything\n\n45:21that we've put towards a man and\n\n45:23testosterone which means more stronger,\n\n45:25more career oriented.\n\n45:26I mean there there was a quote\n\n45:28that I have in my book.\n\n45:30Even from when estrogen and\n\n45:32testosterone refers to isolate.\n\n45:33And we thought OK, what can we do?\n\n45:36How? Who needs this?\n\n45:37Who doesn't,\n\n45:38and one of the doctors said,\n\n45:40you know we have to be careful because\n\n45:42soon enough women will think that their\n\n45:45ambitious enough to have careers so and he.\n\n45:47I don't think he was kidding.\n\n45:50And then someone said the response\n\n45:53was this goes back to the 20s where\n\n45:56we called like feminist suffragettes.\n\n45:58But could we turn those suffragettes\n\n46:01back into maternal housekeepers again?\n\n46:04I think that hopefully we're\n\n46:06getting away from that,\n\n46:07but it is something still ingrained.\n\n46:09A colleague of mine is writing a\n\n46:11book just on testosterone and she\n\n46:14calls it the aspirational hormone.\n\n46:16She's done a lot of work with\n\n46:18gender issues and the Olympics.\n\n46:20That's her expertise,\n\n46:21not mine,\n\n46:22but we still think that these women\n\n46:24that have slightly higher testosterone.\n\n46:27That's what's making them\n\n46:28run faster and do better.\n\n46:30And we know that from her studies\n\n46:32and what she's looked into.\n\n46:35That it doesn't always that they.\n\n46:36I mean some of these women\n\n46:38have lost some of these women,\n\n46:39even with the little extra\n\n46:41testosterone that they were born with.\n\n46:42Not doping hasn't had the impact\n\n46:44that we think, but it is.\n\n46:45It's ingrained we're trying\n\n46:47to get away from that,\n\n46:48but it's very ingrained in our system.\n\n46:51Yes.\n\n46:56So my question is basically about the\n\n46:59size about the challenger industry.\n\n47:01And do you think that it's\n\n47:04grown over the past decade?\n\n47:06And could this relate to perhaps\n\n47:08like growing distrust of the\n\n47:10medical institution or even people\n\n47:11unable to afford health insurance?\n\n47:14Do you think that these factors\n\n47:16and potentially played a role?\n\n47:19I think it's the people that have the money\n\n47:22that can keep the charlatan businesses going.\n\n47:24Those that can afford insurance and\n\n47:26those that can afford medicine cannot\n\n47:28afford these people, and they're\n\n47:29not giving out their stuff for free.\n\n47:32I think it's so easy to say,\n\n47:34Oh my God, it's worse now than ever.\n\n47:36But if you look back in history the 1920s\n\n47:39they would say it's worse now than ever.\n\n47:41Every generation you think\n\n47:43it's worse now than ever.\n\n47:44So I kinda think we have\n\n47:46these pushes and pulls.\n\n47:47and I do think when people are\n\n47:49distrustful of the medical\n\n47:50establishment for whatever reason.\n\n47:52It drives people to seek help elsewhere.\n\n47:54Is the testosterone\n\n47:55industry booming right now?\n\n47:57I mean, I got on the sub on\n\n47:59the Metro-North yesterday,\n\n48:01right to a poster that said like,\n\n48:03are you feeling fatigued ahead of you know,\n\n48:06all men?\n\n48:06It didn't say this,\n\n48:08but basically it was like all men over\n\n48:10the age of 30 could use testosterone.\n\n48:13Call this clinic.\n\n48:14It's right near a Metro North Station,\n\n48:16so that's a huge industry now.\n\n48:19But we had.\n\n48:20I think it might have been even\n\n48:22more in the 1920s when.\n\n48:24There is no one really clamping down,\n\n48:26but I think it's oh there's always\n\n48:27going to be someone out there to\n\n48:29get that low lying fruit and see.\n\n48:31Oh wait,\n\n48:32we just learned that oxy Towson\n\n48:34is something just social skills.\n\n48:35I'll put that in a bottle and sell it.\n\n48:38You know,\n\n48:38there's always someone that's clever\n\n48:39enough to figure out.\n\n48:41One last question could have been\n\n48:43very patient in the Blue Ann.\n\n48:44Yeah, sorry, so I'm sorry we can\n\n48:46get to the other hands, but yes.\n\n48:49Hello. I had a question you might comment\n\n48:53so its fashions in stated that we live in\n\n48:56this post truth world where we may not\n\n48:58value evidence and facts and rationales.\n\n49:00We once did I wonder in your research\n\n49:02of the evolution of American\n\n49:04culture in the 1920s present day.\n\n49:06You might comment on the evolution of\n\n49:08the value of evidence and rationale.\n\n49:11That looks like maybe even the world\n\n49:13of social media and so forth. Yeah,\n\n49:16I think the world of the Internet and\n\n49:18social media has really changed it.\n\n49:20Just because in terms of these\n\n49:22new fads can just go viral.\n\n49:24That's we call it, you know, much faster,\n\n49:27and I think it's just hard to push\n\n49:30back against testimony an I think yeah,\n\n49:32it's always been there.\n\n49:34But I don't think you could create\n\n49:36that wave as quickly as you can now\n\n49:39in terms of treatments and drugs\n\n49:41that are thought to save your life.\n\n49:43And as much as people say they\n\n49:46don't believe it, they do.\n\n49:47And that's the hard thing.\n\n49:49What can we do?\n\n49:50You know we can clamp down on doctors\n\n49:52like my oxy Towson Salesperson.\n\n49:54It's very hard to clamp down on people\n\n49:56posting stuff or misconstruing a\n\n49:58lot of it isn't just from nowhere,\n\n50:00its people.\n\n50:00Misconstruing What's in the media\n\n50:02and then you know it's almost\n\n50:04like the game of telephone,\n\n50:06and we're constantly working against that.\n\n50:07And again, it's freedom, the press.\n\n50:09So how do you clamp down on all this?\n\n50:13And I do think I think yeah,\n\n50:15it gets back to basic cause and effect.\n\n50:18Two.\n\n50:18I mean the whole thing with\n\n50:20vaccines or people were saying no,\n\n50:22no no.\n\n50:22My kid had a vaccine and then two\n\n50:24years later was diagnosed with autism.\n\n50:27There's a fact there's you know.\n\n50:28So it's it's not just like these\n\n50:30things that have nowhere.\n\n50:32It's the way they see the data to or the\n\n50:35measles isn't so bad for you, right?\n\n50:37I want to end on an optimistic note.\n\n50:39Hopefully the Randy.\n\n50:40The first story that she\n\n50:42shares in her book as.\n\n50:44About a woman named Blanche Gray who had.\n\n50:47The like horrific.\n\n50:53Name, I guess is being the\n\n50:55fat bride in the early.\n\n50:5720th century and yet she says if she was\n\n51:01born on the wrong side of medical discovery.\n\n51:04That had she been born later,\n\n51:06there would have been clear interventions to\n\n51:08help kind of save her life, improve her life.\n\n51:11Hopefully also she would have been born\n\n51:14at a time when kind of bullying was not\n\n51:17an acceptable form of communication.\n\n51:19And so I want to ask Randy like what\n\n51:22are we on the other side of now?\n\n51:25Oh I think what do you think that in\n\n51:28the study of hormones or otherwise?\n\n51:30You know, for your crystal ball,\n\n51:32what do you see?\n\n51:34Kind of coming down the Pike.\n\n51:36what\n\n51:36I think is really exciting now an\n\n51:38I sort of I can say to this yell\n\n51:41audience 'cause I start with Cushing.\n\n51:43Who is it? Yell and then I just spoke\n\n51:46to a wonderful researcher right here.\n\n51:48Sabrina Deano. Who's doing now?\n\n51:51Some of the cutting edge\n\n51:53neuroscience endocrine work?\n\n51:54I think what's really on the cutting\n\n51:56edge now is hormones and behavior.\n\n51:58So a few decades ago,\n\n52:00we realized that the fat cell isn't just\n\n52:03a glob of butter that I thought it was.\n\n52:06It's actually an endocrine\n\n52:07cell that secretes hormones.\n\n52:09But when we learned that leptin as\n\n52:11our appetite suppressing hormone,\n\n52:13you can't take it,\n\n52:14you're not going to lose weight from it.\n\n52:17But even though there are\n\n52:19leptin diet puts out there.\n\n52:21But what the fascinating part\n\n52:23isn't that people that have leptin\n\n52:25defects gain weight more quickly.\n\n52:27It doesn't affect their metabolism,\n\n52:28it drives them to eat their compelled to eat.\n\n52:31And people with leptin defects\n\n52:33that eat all the time.\n\n52:35It's not like they're enjoying their food,\n\n52:37it's just this compulsion.\n\n52:38So when I spoke to the scientists\n\n52:40that are doing that research,\n\n52:42or that isolated that gene\n\n52:44there feeling was there,\n\n52:45not just excited about what\n\n52:47can we learn about obesity?\n\n52:48But this is about behavior.\n\n52:50This is showing us.\n\n52:51That hormones are controlling our behavior,\n\n52:54not just growth and metabolism.\n\n52:55Can we control our behavior?\n\n52:57Thurmans do we understand the criminal mind?\n\n52:59No,\n\n53:00but I mentioned Sabrina Diano 'cause\n\n53:02she's doing fascinating work with leptin,\n\n53:04an looking at in the inside the cell,\n\n53:06not just receptors.\n\n53:07But I think we're really honing\n\n53:09in on the details of the cell\n\n53:12to really understand behavior.\n\n53:13We're not there yet.\n\n53:15And will we control it?\n\n53:16That's always that really weird question\n\n53:19of how much control do we want to have?\n\n53:22So the more we know, I\n\n53:24guess we're on the verge.\n\n53:26We've got great technology\n\n53:27and even though I make fun\n\n53:29of some wacky scientist,\n\n53:30there's some really wonderful\n\n53:31ones on great research going\n\n53:33on now. So since we are in\n\n53:35an educational institution,\n\n53:36hopefully kind of where in the presence\n\n53:38of more wonderful than wacky scientists,\n\n53:40although there and hopefully a little\n\n53:41a little bit of wacky as you also show\n\n53:44in terms of kind of being able to\n\n53:46imagine the previously unimaginable,\n\n53:48is also crucial.\n\n53:49Part of driving us forward.\n\n53:50I'm so thankful to Randy for.\n\n53:53Her commitment to taking kind of\n\n53:55conversations that often only\n\n53:56happened in institutions like this\n\n53:58kind of out into the broader public,\n\n54:00because I think that kind of her\n\n54:03another's ability to do that,\n\n54:05is it a crucial part of trying to\n\n54:07ameliorate the distrust that so many of\n\n54:10you ask questions about and tried to?\n\n54:12Once again,\n\n54:13orientis around a shared fact,\n\n54:15based which hopefully.\n\n54:18People who aren't as acquainted\n\n54:19with what a leptin is or isn't,\n\n54:21could still use to empower themselves to\n\n54:23make the best decisions for themselves,\n\n54:25their children, their futures,\n\n54:26because we're all better\n\n54:27off when that happens.\n\n54:28So Randy, just thank you so much.\n\n54:30Thank you and I thank you for\n\n54:32hosting us today. Thank you."
