        "text": "8min200\n\nIf it’s tough being a kid, try being a “first kid” — the child of an American president. Just ask President Bill Clinton‘s daughter, Chelsea. Or President George W. Bush‘s twins, Jenna and Barbara. And now, President Donald Trump‘s youngest child, Barron, is finding out. Ten-year-old Barron was the target of a poorly received joke […]\n\n9min222\n\nHillary Clinton bested Donald Trump in three debates. She leads in many preference polls of the most competitive states. Barring a significant shift in the next two weeks, she is in a strong position to become the first woman elected U.S. president. But Clinton will end the campaign still struggling to change the minds of […]\n\n6min274\n\nHillary Clinton‘s campaign asked former President Bill Clinton to cancel a speech to a Wall Street investment firm last year because of concerns that the Clintons might appear to be too cozy with Wall Street just as the former secretary of state was about to announce her White House bid, newly released emails show. Clinton […]\n\n34min261\n\nThe Latest on the 2016 presidential campaign (all times local): 10:40 p.m. Indiana Gov. Mike Pence says he supports Donald Trump‘s call to “temporarily suspend immigration from countries where terrorists’ influence and impact represents a threat to the United States.” Pence spoke Friday on Fox News Channel’s “Hannity,” giving his first TV interview since Trump […]\n\n7min228\n\nThe gathering at All Saints Early Learning Center in Jacksonville last Thursday might have been mistaken for the kickoff to an Easter Egg hunt. Babies, preschoolers, and older siblings bounced along to Pharell Williams’ “Happy,” as they climbed on furniture and played hide-and-seek in their familiar parish hall. For former First Daughter Chelsea Clinton, the […]\n\n6min390\n\nChelsea Clinton may be a campaign surrogate for her mother. But in terms of political savvy, Chelsea is her father’s daughter. An event Thursday evening at the All Saints Early Learning and Community Care Center saw Clinton, who has a young child herself, demonstrate an ability to deftly pivot from conversations with children about whether […]\n\n1min291\n\nMultiple sources have reported trouble in the friendship between Chelsea Clinton and Ivanka Trump. Politico: the “friendship is on ice.” Vanity Fair: “Are BFFs Chelsea Clinton and Ivanka Trump on the rocks?” And National Review weighed in on the “strange friendship” between the daughters of the GOP and Democratic front runners. A lot of uninformed […]\n\n2min340\n\nFormer first daughter Chelsea Clinton will campaign for her mother Hillary Clinton at six stops in five Florida cities late this week, the Clinton campaign announced Tuesday. The younger Clinton, now 36, who works for the family’s Clinton Foundation and Clinton Global Initiative, will begin with an appearance Thursday billed as an early childhood education […]\n\n1min173\n\nChelsea Clinton, daughter of the frontrunner in the Democratic Presidential race, swings through Jacksonville Thursday evening for a “small chat” with a big price tag. $250 gets you in the door. $500-$1,000 gets you a photo op. Hillary Clinton is expected to win Florida handily, yet the Democratic Party’s model of distributing delegates ensures that […]"
