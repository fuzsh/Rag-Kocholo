She is known for previously working with NBC News as a special correspondent from 2011 to 2014, and now works with the Clinton Global Initiative and the Clinton Foundation, having a prominent role and a seat on the foundationâs board.\n\nGaining Wealth Through Numerous Endeavors\n\nHow rich is Chelsea Clinton? As of early-2018, sources estimate a net worth that is at $15 million, earned through success in her various endeavors. Sheâs worked for various high profile companies including NBC, New York University, Avenue Capital Group, and McKinsey & Company. As she continues her career, it is expected that her wealth will also continue to increase.\n\nDoes Chelsea Clinton Have Any Children? Marriage and Family\n\nChelsea married investment banker Marc Mezvinsky in 2010; he is known to have been the co-founder of the hedge fund Eaglevale Partners which is now defunct. The couple were married in an interfaith ceremony since he is Jewish and she is a Methodist. They were reported as a couple in 2005 and became engaged in 2009. After their wedding, the couple lived at the Gramercy Park in New York City for three years before purchasing a NoMad district condominium in Manhattan valued at $10.5 million. They then moved to the nearby Flatiron District in 2016. They now have two children together.\n\nGrowing Up as a Clinton\n\nAt a young age she was exposed to politics due to her fatherâs political career, accompanying her parents throughout her fatherâs gubernatorial race. She attended Horace Mann Junior High School, then moved into the White House with her parents in 1993. Her parents hoped for her to have a normal childhood, and tried as much as possible to keep her out of the media spotlight. Coverage of her was very limited by the media, and a lot of outlets unofficially declared her off-limits due to her age. Eventually, she was removed from public schooling and attended the private Sidwell Friends School which aimed at helping her gain more privacy. She matriculated in 1997, and then decided to attend Stanford University.\n\nClinton first day in the university proved to be problematic as she was accompanied by almost 250 journalists, and needed to have secret service agents with her. Her dormitory was filled with security cameras and bulletproof dormitories while plain clothes Secret Service agents lived in her dorm; the moves ultimately proved successful as she remained out of public view. She graduated with honors in 2001, completing a degree in history. She then decided to pursue a masterâs degree at the University of Oxford, but did not apply for a Rhodes scholarship like her father. She completed an MPhil degree in international relations two years later, and soon returned to the US. She would later pursue more education, completing an MPH degree at Mailman School of Public Health and a DPhil degree in International Relations at New York University.\n\nThank you @ConservationOrg & @TiffanyAndCo for your work together to raise awareness about the threats facing elephants, and what we can do to support community efforts to protect elephants and stop poaching. pic.twitter.com/Irj3iSgm7O\n\nâ Chelsea Clinton (@ChelseaClinton) April 27, 2018\n\nGaining Ground in Numerous Careers\n\nChelseaâs first work was as a part of the consulting firm McKinsey & Company, located in New York City, where she stayed for three years before moving to work for Avenue Capital Group. Around this time, she already started working for the Clinton Foundation, becoming the Vice Chair and participating in numerous events. She also became a board member of both the IAC and the School of American Ballet. In 2011, she was hired by NBC to become a special correspondent, and subsequently contributed to feature stories as a part of âNBC Nightly Newsâ and âRock Center with Brian Williamsâ. Her contract allowed her to continue to pursue her education, while also working for the Clinton Foundation. However, her work with NBC received a lot of negative reviews from critics, despite which her contract was renewed, and she stayed with the network until 2014.\n\nThe following year, she wrote her first book entitled âItâs Your World: Get Informed, Get Inspired and Get Going!â which was aimed at middle school students. The 400 page book received mixed reviews, praised her for her effort but disliking the tone of the book overall. She then wrote another book in 2017 entitled âShe Persistedâ, which is also aimed at children, and which became a bestseller upon its release.\n\nTonight we're joined by @ChelseaClinton, McKenzie Davis and @MarkRuffalo! pic.twitter.com/Q8UPkFdPER\n\nâ TONIGHT: Harry Styles Hosts The Late Late Show!

During that time she made remarks about cannabis drug interactions in support of her motherâs policies, which comments drew a lot of remarks, saying that she was misleading and produced fictitious remarks.\n\nGeneral Info\n\nFull NameMarc MezvinskyNet Worth$15 millionDate Of BirthDecember 15, 1977, February 27, 1980Height1.75 mProfessionJournalist, Politician, Author, ConsultantEducationUniversity of Oxford, Stanford University, Stanford University, Sidwell Friends School, Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health, Robert F.
