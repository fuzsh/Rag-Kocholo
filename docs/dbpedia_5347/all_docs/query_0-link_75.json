And here, we’ve put them all in one place! (Much of the speculation, we’re sure, will shake out as fact, but the Clinton’s have confirmed few details beyond the date.) Herewith, find POLITICO’s round-up of what we know — and don’t know for sure — about the wedding of President Bill Clinton and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s daughter.\n\nChelsea Clinton Marc Mezvinsky Wedding Date and Location.\n\nOne thing we do know for sure: this coming Saturday, July 31, is the big day, because the Clinton’s confirmed that fact on Tuesday. And, though the wedding site has not been announced by the family, pictures have appeared online of large, white tents being set-up on the grounds of the Astor Courts estate in Rhinebeck, N.Y.\n\nThe area paper, The Hudson Valley News, has also reported that gifts have been pouring into Rhinebeck, as have many trucks, one carrying large air-conditioning units and generators.\n\nThe rehearsal dinner is reportedly taking place at the nearby Grasmere, a 525-acre estate boasting a Federal-period manor house with formal gardens, stucco guest cottages and a large stone barn complex. Another area manse rumored to be serving the family over the weekend will be Glenburn, where the Clintons are said to be staying over the weekend. Glenburn is the Rhinebeck home of Eric and Andrea Colombel. Andrea Colombel is the daughter of billionaire financier and longtime Clinton supporter George Soros.\n\nChelsea Clinton Marc Mezvinsky Wedding Guests\n\nThe guest list is suspected to number between 400-500 invitees, many of whom will likely stay at Rhinebeck’s Beekman Arms & Delamater Inn (which boasts a plaque that Bill and Hillary Clinton have eaten there). The Hudson Valley News reported that attendees may include Oprah Winfrey, Barbara Streisand, Steven Spielberg, former Clinton adviser Harold Ickes, former DNC Chairman Terry McAuliffe, media mogul Ted Turner, former British Prime Minister John Major and historian Doris Kearns Goodwin. However, another intrepid reporter called reps for some of these rumored guests and heard that many of them were either not going or had not been invited at all. Some things we do know: President Barack Obama will not be going (press secretary Robert Gibbs said on Monday that Obama had no plans to attend). Also, Vice President Al Gore and his wife, Tipper, will not be attending, either.\n\nChelsea Clinton Marc Mezvinsky Wedding Dress:\n\nSeriously, now our tulle-filled heads are just spinning.\n\nIt’s been the question among fashion insiders for months: Will bride-to-be Chelsea Clinton wear Vera Wang or Oscar de la Renta when she walks down the aisle to marry investment-banker fiancé Marc Mezvinsky on July 31 in Rhinebeck, N.Y.?\n\nA friend told StyleList back in June that 30-year-old Clinton had a made-to-measure wedding dress in Vera Wang’s workshop, confirming what we had speculated all along — that the presidential progeny is opting for the epitome of classic American bridal.\n\nThat was until Sheryl Gay Stolberg, The New York TImes White House correspondent, told Ann Curry on the “Today Show” that the former first daughter had chosen an Oscar de la Renta gown. So, maybe we spoke too soon. Or not… The plot thickens.\n\nWWD’s Wednesday, July 28, cover features Chelsea Clinton, obscured by a large floppy hat (so much for going incognito!), arriving at Vera Wang’s midtown showroom in New York City on July 27 to meet her Secretary of State mom, Hillary Rodham Clinton, who was already there.\n\nReportedly, Wang is doing the bridesmaids’ dresses, the flower girls’ dresses, as well as the all-important wedding dress. And supposedly Hillary and Chelsea have met with Wang five to 10 times over the last four months. OK. Settled. Score one for StyleList.\n\nNot so fast. Hillary was also spotted paying a visit to Oscar de la Renta’s Manhattan showroom earlier the same day. There are conflicting reports as to whether Chelsea accompanied her mother, but the duo has allegedly met with de la Renta numerous times of late.\n\nAnd, after all, the designer — who often dresses the former first lady, starting during her turn at the White House — is reportedly close friends with the Clintons, as in the couple vacations at his Dominican Republic home.\n\nThe Clinton camp, in addition to Vera Wang and Oscar de la Renta spokespeople, declined comment to WWD.\n\nSo, will Chelsea Clinton wear both designers during her weekend wedding? Will just Hillary be wearing de la Renta? Or is this all a plan to throw us off completely? Only time and continued bridal back-and-forth will tell. Try to keep up. Trust us, it’s not easy.No confirmation on this yet, but after weeks of reports that the dress was either a design by Oscar de la Renta or Vera Wang, Chelsea’s visit to Wang’s store in New York on Tuesday makes it likely she is going with the latter. Earlier on Tuesday, Secretary Clinton was spotted at Oscar de la Renta’s 7th Avenue showroom, which lends credence to the rumor that she may wearing something by the designer. (He has, after all, dressed HRC both for her swearing into the State Department and for her ’98 Vogue magazine cover appearance).\n\nChelsea Clinton Marc Mezvinsky Wedding Food:\n\nThree companies are said to be catering the event: Blue Ribbon Restaurants, The St. Regis Hotel and Olivier Cheng Catering. A source familiar with the event told POLITICO that the food will have a heavy New York influence, signifying both Chelsea’s adopted hometown and the state her mother represented while serving as U.S. senator. Think lots of fresh, local vegetables to appease the vegetarian bride — who is also allergic to gluten.\n\nMusic: TMZ reported this week that they had a copy of the playlist Clinton and her fiancé gave to the live band playing at the wedding. The songs are a mix of oldies and pop hits, including several Michael Jackson songs (“Billie Jean” “The Way You Make Me Feel,” “Don’t Stop ‘Til You Get Enough” and “Rock With You”). Also on the playlist: “Wild World” by Cat Stevens, “Sitting on the Dock of the Bay” by Otis Redding, “Think” by Aretha Franklin, U2’s “Beautiful Day,” and ABBA’s “Dancing Queen,” others. One of the newer songs: “I Gotta Feeling” by the Black Eyed Peas. (We’re taking this tidbit with a grain of salt.)\n\nWedding favor: One element of the welcome package waiting for guests at their hotels will be a bottle of wine from a nearby vineyard called, quite appropriately, “Clinton Vineyards and Winery,” the Wall Street Journal has reported.\n\nBathrooms: The deluxe portable toilets supposedly rented for the outdoor event cost an estimated $15,000, according to TMZ. (They do look fancy, but …)\n\nFlowers: The Wall Street Journal also reported that floral arrangements will be supplied by Boston-based Winston Flowers and floral designer, Jeff Leatham — who counts the Four Seasons and Madonna as his clients. No word on what the bouquets will consist of.\n\nChelsea Clinton Early years\n\nClinton was born in Little Rock, Arkansas. Her name was inspired by her parents’ fondness for Judy Collins’s 1969 recording of the Joni Mitchell song “Chelsea Morning”.\n\nClinton excelled in academics. A family friend described her as a precocious child.While in elementary school, Clinton skipped the third grade.[4] Her parents encouraged her academic excellence, with her father keeping a miniature desk for his daughter in the governor’s office when he was Governor of Arkansas.\n\nIn Little Rock, Clinton attended Forest Park Elementary School, Booker Arts and Science Magnet Elementary School and Horace Mann Junior High School.\n\nThroughout her childhood, Clinton enjoyed volleyball, cards, ping pong and movies.She became a vegetarian.\n\nChelsea Clinton Teenager at the White House\n\nWhite House portrait of the Clinton family, unknown date.\n\nClinton moved into the White House on the day of her father’s first inauguration on January 20, 1993, when she was twelve years old. Her Secret Service codename was Energy.\n\nIn Washington, D.C., she attended Sidwell Friends School. She was a National Merit Scholarship finalist in 1997. Having taken dance classes since she was four years old, Clinton began taking ballet courses at the Washington School of Ballet in 1993. She played the role of the Favorite Aunt and the Sugar Plum Fairy in the Washington Ballet’s 1996 production of Tchaikovsky’s The Nutcracker. Additionally, she was a chairperson on the board for the School of American Ballet.[clarification needed] Clinton is also a veteran of the Model United Nations.\n\nOn February 5, 1999, just before the U.S. Senate vote on her father’s impeachment, People ran a cover story on her which irked the First Family, as well as the Secret Service.[9]\n\nShe assumed some of her mother’s White House hostess responsibilities when her mother was campaigning for the U.S. Senate in 2000, continuing until the end of her father’s presidency on January 20, 2001.\n\nChelsea Clinton Life after the Clinton presidency\n\nChelsea with her parents in her father’s 1997 inaugural parade, January 20, 1997.\n\nSeeing her mother, Hillary Clinton, sworn in as U.S. Senator, January 3, 2001.\n\nAt Stanford University in Stanford, California, where Clinton did her undergraduate studies, she had declared a major in chemistry with an interest in medicine before switching to history after two years.The film Chasing Liberty (2004) was said to be inspired by a photograph of Clinton at a Stanford basketball game with other students. In 2001, she graduated from Stanford; her undergraduate thesis topic was the 1998 Belfast Agreement in Northern Ireland.\n\nShe went on to earn a master’s degree in international relations at University College at the University of Oxford in Oxford, United Kingdom.\n\nIn 2003, Clinton joined the consulting firm McKinsey & Company in New York City, New York; she was the youngest person hired in her class. In the fall of 2006, she left McKinsey and went to work for Avenue Capital Group, a hedge fund run by Marc Lasry, a donor to Democratic causes and supporter of the Clintons. She serves on the board of the School of American Ballet and has also served as co-chairperson of a fund-raising week and for her father’s Clinton Foundation.\n\nChelsea Clinton speaking to students on behalf of her mother’s campaign at the University of Missouri, January 2008.\n\nIn 2005,[clarification needed] Clinton took up residence in New York City in the Gramercy neighborhood on Manhattan’s East Side. During the November 2006 mid-term election, in which her mother was running for re-election to the Senate, attention was drawn to her residence when it was discovered that an error at her 20th Street polling station had resulted in her name not being in the voting book. Clinton was allowed to vote via a provisional ballot.\n\nWikinews has related news: Chelsea Clinton engaged to banker Marc Mezvinsky\n\nIn November 2009, Clinton announced her engagement to investment banker Marc Mezvinsky, son of former Iowa congressman Edward Mezvinsky and former Pennsylvania congresswoman Marjorie Margolies-Mezvinsky, and nephew of Norton Mezvinsky.[A summer 2010 wedding is planned for July 31 in the New York village of Rhinebeck. The guest list, made public in mid-July 2010, includes such notables as Barack Obama, Ted Turner, Oprah Winfrey and Steven Spielberg. It is not yet clear whether Ms. Clinton will adopt her husband-to-be’s Conservative Jewish faith.\n\nAs of December 2009, Clinton was studying health policy and management at Columbia University’s Mailman School of Public Health.\n\nChelsea Clinton Campaigning for her mother\n\nChelsea Clinton speaking during a campaign stop at California Polytechnic State University for her mother, February 2008.\n\nChelsea Clinton speaks during the second night of the 2008 Democratic National Convention in Denver, Colorado, introducing her mother, Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, August 2008.\n\nUntil her mother began her presidential campaign, Clinton had never publicly commented about any of her parents’ policies or public statements. But she did begin to rally support for her mother and speak publicly on her behalf. In May 2006, her mother publicly apologized to Clinton for critical remarks she made about young people’s work ethic, after Clinton privately took exception to her mother’s comments.\n\nIn December 2007, Clinton began to campaign for her mother’s bid for the Democratic presidential nomination in Iowa before the January caucuses, greeting potential voters in Des Moines, Iowa.After that, she campaigned for her mother extensively across the country, largely on college campuses. By early April 2008, she had spoken at 100 college campuses on behalf of her mother’s candidacy. During the campaign, Philippe Reines, her mother’s press secretary, often shadowed Clinton during her public appearances, attempting to deflect “…hangers-on, swooning frat boys and, mostly, looming trouble in the form of microphones, cameras and notepads”.\n\nClinton’s blanket refusal to speak to any media members has been noted. In December 2007, she refused to answer a question from a nine-year-old “kid reporter” named Sydney Rieckhoff from Scholastic News who asked whether she thought her father would be a good “first man”. Chelsea replied, “I’m sorry, I don’t talk to the press, and that applies to you, unfortunately — even though I think you’re cute.” Controversy arose when MSNBC’s David Shuster said that Clinton was being “pimped out” by her parents for the campaign. Shuster was later suspended for his remarks. Clinton introduced her mother on August 26 at the 2008 Democratic National Convention.\n\nTags:Chelsea Clinton Marc Mezvinsky Wedding Videos , Pictures,Weddings, Chelsea Clinton, TMZ, New York, Wall Street Journal, Very Wang,Chelsea Clinton’s Wedding Dress, Date, & Location Update,U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton,Chelsea Clinton Marc Mezvinsky Wedding Videos , Pictures"
