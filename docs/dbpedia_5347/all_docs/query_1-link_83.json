        "text": "Chelsea Clinton said Thursday that she and her husband, Marc Mezvinsky, are expecting their first child later this year, adding a new label to her mother, the potential 2016 Democratic presidential nominee: grandmother.\n\n“I just hope that I will be as good a mom to my child and, hopefully, children as my mom was to me,” Clinton said.\n\nShe made the surprise announcement at an event on the Lower East Side where she and Hillary Clinton sat onstage with actress America Ferrera to discuss the Bill, Hillary & Chelsea Clinton Foundation’s efforts to advance women and girls.\n\nHillary Clinton, who has for years joked that she is impatient to become a grandmother, said she was “really excited” about the news. Mezvinsky stood in the back of the packed room at the Lower Eastside Girls Club.\n\nAfter the event on behalf of the “No Ceilings” initiative, Hillary Clinton and her daughter beamed about the announcement with Anna Wintour, the editor of Vogue and Democratic fundraiser, and other supporters in attendance.\n\nIn addition to impending motherhood, Chelsea Clinton has taken on a larger role in the running of her family’s foundation. She recently helped install her friend and former McKinsey & Co. colleague Eric Braverman as chief executive, replacing Bruce R. Lindsey, a longtime Clinton confidant who remains chairman of the foundation’s board.\n\nOn Thursday evening, Chelsea Clinton is to attend the premiere of “Of Many,” a documentary film project she was involved in, followed by a reception on the High Line."
