        "text": "New Delhi: Rudyard Kipling is one of the best-known late Victorian poets and storytellers. Although he was awarded the Nobel Prize for literature in 1907, his political views, which grew more controversial with age, have led analysts and experts to criticise him. He celebrated British imperialism, and his tales and poems reflect the situation of British soldiers in India, and the celebration of colonialism is reflected in his tales for children as well. His Jungle Book duology (The Jungle Book, 1894; The Second Jungle Book, 1895) has endured the test of time and fetched fame, making him one of the most popular authors of all time.\n\nThe early life of Rudyard Kipling\n\nRudyard Kipling was born on December 30, 1865, in Bombay, in the Bombay Presidency of British India. His father, John Lockwood Kipling, was the principal of the JJ School of Art and was also an architect and artist. According to Charles Cantalupo in the ‘Dictionary of Literary Biography’, he came to colonial India “to encourage, support, and restore native Indian art against the incursions of British business interests.” He meant to try, Cantalupo continues, “to preserve, at least in part, and to copy styles of art and architecture which, representing a rich and continuous tradition of thousands of years, were suddenly threatened with extinction.” His mother, Alice Macdonald was connected with important members of the Pre-Raphaelite movement in British arts and letters.\n\nKipling’s initial years were spent in India, and he later described it as almost a paradise, which he wrote in his posthumously published autobiography ‘Something of Myself for My Friends Known and Unknown’. However, in 1871, Rudyard and his sister Beatrice were sent to England, partly to avoid health problems, but also so that they could begin their schooling. Kipling and his sister were placed with the widow of an old Navy captain named Holloway at a boarding house called Lorne Lodge in Southsea, a suburb of Portsmouth. Kipling and Trix spent the better part of the next six years in that place, which they came to call the “House of Desolation.”\n\nKipling’s journey as a journalist\n\nRudyard’s parents could not afford to send him to one of the major English universities. So, in 1882, he left the Services College and went to India to rejoin his family and begin a career as a journalist. He worked as the assistant editor of the Civil and Military Gazette at Lahore for five years, during which he also published the stories that became ‘Plain Tales from the Hills’. The works are based on British lives in the resort town of Simla, and Departmental Ditties and it was his first major collection of poems.\n\nIn 1888, he joined the Allahabad Pioneer, at a time when his works had begun to be published in cheap editions intended for sale in railroad terminals. He began to earn a strong popular following with collections such as ‘The Phantom ‘Rickshaw and Other Tales’, ‘The Story of the Gadsbys’, ‘Soldiers Three’, ‘Under the Deodars’, and ‘Wee Willie Winkie and Other Child Stories’. In March 1889 Kipling left India to return to England, determined to pursue his future as a writer there.\n\nKipling’s career as an author\n\nThe young writer’s reputation soared after he settled in London, and Kipling’s official biographer, CE Carrington, calls 1890 ‘Rudyard Kipling’s year’. Kipling’s literary life in London brought him to the attention of many people, with a young American publisher named Wolcott Balestier being one of them. He became friends with Kipling and persuaded him to work on a collaborative novel. Kipling married Balestier’s sister, Caroline, in January 1892, and the couple settled near their family home in Brattleboro, Vermont.\n\nHe lived in the United States for several years, in a house they built for themselves and called ‘Naulahka.’ Kipling developed a close friendship with Theodore Roosevelt, who was then the Under Secretary of the Navy, and often discussed politics and culture with him. In 1894, he penned down one of the classic works of juvenile literature: ‘The Jungle Books’, which is ranked among his best works. The adventures of Mowgli are “the cornerstones of Kipling’s reputation as a children’s writer,” declared William Blackburn in Writers for Children, “and still among the most popular of all his works.”\n\nLater life of Kipling\n\nIn 1902 the Kiplings settled in their permanent home, a 17th-century house called “Bateman’s” in East Sussex, and the area around Bateman’s, rich in English history, inspired his last works for children, ‘Puck of Pook’s Hill’ and its sequel, ‘Rewards and Fairies’. He was an active war correspondent during the Boer War in South Africa, and in 1917 he was assigned the post of “Honorary Literary Advisor” to the Imperial War Graves Commission, the same year that his son John, who had been missing in action for two years, was confirmed dead. He declined awards offered to him by his own government, yet accepted others from foreign nations. He finally succumbed to a painful illness early on January 18, 1936, at the age of 70."
