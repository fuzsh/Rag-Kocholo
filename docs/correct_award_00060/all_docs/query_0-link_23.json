        "text": "Why has the Swedish Academy grown so timid in awarding the Nobel Prize in literature? Rudyard Kipling won it at age 41, Albert Camus at 44, and Ernest Hemingway at 55.\n\nBut in the 21st century most literature winners have been over 60, and 2022 laureate Annie Ernaux is 82.\n\nYou can’t blame sexism given the ages of some male laureates of the past 20 years: Kazuo Ishiguro, 63; V.S. Naipaul, 69; Mario Vargas Llosa, 75. And Malala Yousafzai won the Nobel Peace Prize when she was 17.\n\nWhat’s happening with the literature prize looks like an increasing lack of literary courage. The Swedish Academy seems to have grown less confident about honoring younger authors or to need to wait for more evidence that its judgment is correct."
