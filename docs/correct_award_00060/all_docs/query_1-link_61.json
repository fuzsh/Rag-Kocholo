        "text": "Rudyard Kipling, poet, author and world traveller, was born in India in 1865 and died in England in 1936. He passed through Vancouver several times during the period 1889-1907 on his way to India. He was awarded a Nobel Prize for Literature in 1907. Major Matthews interviewed him in 1907 when he visited Vancouver on a cross-Canada tour. According to Matthews' informants, \"A real estate agent got him when he passed through Vancouver on his way to China. Rudyard was easy and bought way out in subdivision 264A\"."
