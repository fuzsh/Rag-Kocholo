        "text": "February 21, 2019\n\nThe adventure writer's adventure writer\n\nFor some reason, I have never read much of Kipling though obviously aware of his approach, style and influence both on future writers and pop culture with his Jungle Book tales.\n\nKipling is a man of his time. Born in Calcutta, the product of civil servants in service to the British Empire and the English Public School system and the odd British colonial tradition of leaving children for years in the care of distant relatives back home while the parents live the vaunted colonial life in the far-flung empire.\n\nThis work, as well as featuring a few of his poems, presented his first novel \"The Light That Failed\" which touched on his English upbringing and the life of a war correspondent who sketches battle scenes for the English press wire service. It is obvious how profoundly it affected the early 20th century ranks of young writers drawn into service in the First World War to live that life so inspiring to the literary adventurer. Supposedly, Kipling sent a copy to Teddy Roosevelt with whom he had formed a relationship during a time of residency in the states.\n\nThe 1907 selection of Kipling for the Nobel was a turning point for the committee as all the previous laureates had been in the twilight of their career. In fact, Giosue Carducci, the prior recipient was so aged and infirm that he died shortly after receiving his prize. Kipling, the first British recipient whose award was much speculated on in the British press, was still in his forties which, to many of the committee members, afforded much more prestige being offered to a writer with so many more productive years to be had. For Kipling, he still had 30 more years of short stories and poems within him.\n\nKipling was an imperialist and a white supremacist. In his discussions with Cecil Rhodes he espoused the belief that the Anglo-Saxon was fated to rule the world, coining the term as \"the white man's burden\" oh which he literarily expounded.\n\nBut he also loved traveling throughout the world, the instinct of the colonial born until his waning days. There's no denying how much the world and its people influenced him as much as he influenced 20th English and American literature, for which the Nobel was rightly rewarded."
