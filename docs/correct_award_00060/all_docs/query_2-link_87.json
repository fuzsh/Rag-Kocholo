        "text": "Rudyard Kipling Autograph Letter Signed.\n\nKIPLING, Rudyard.\n\nItem Number: 111621\n\nRare autograph letter signed and entirely in the hand of Nobel Prize-winning author Rudyard Kipling. Dated January 1, 1931. Signed “Rud,” to John Hays Hammond, “Dear Jack reporting on his wife’s poor health and travel plans. 1 page, The wife has been ill–in bed for . . . weeks with rheumatism. She is a bit better now & we hope to get her away to Bath in a few days for treatment before we try to go abroad. . . . [T]he weather is and has been damnable for the last week.” John Hays Hammond was a mining engineer, diplomat, and philanthropist. Known as the man with the Midas touch, he amassed a sizable fortune before the age of 40. In near fine condition.\n\nEnglish journalist, short-story writer, poet, and novelist Rudyard Kipling's major works include The Jungle Book (1894), Kim (1901) and many short stories and poems. Kipling was born in India, which inspired much of his work and his innovative stories for children have become timeless classics. Kipling was one of the most popular writers in the British Empire, in both prose and verse, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries and was awarded the Nobel Prize in literature in 1907."
