        "text": "Reviews From the Archive\n\nAn occasional series, cross-posting my reviews from Read the Nobels.\n\nTo see my progress with completing the Read the Nobels Challenge, see here.\n\nKim by Rudyard Kipling, winner of the Nobel Prize in 1907\n\n1st November, 2003\n\nI enjoyed this. It’s one of those classic books I always meant to read, one that’s part of my British heritage which is known around the world because of Kipling’s influence on the scouting movement.\n\nKim is a boy enlisted by chance to work for the British Secret Service in India. He is orphaned by a sick mother and a feckless Irish father in service in India, and he lives in the streets. One day he is captured by the British, who find his ID papers in a scapula around his neck – and they send him off to school. A certain Commander recognises his potential as an ‘agent’ because he is familiar with Indian street life and its languages.\n\nKim takes to the streets on a quest for enlightenment with a Buddhist Lama, but is able to serve His Majesty in various other ways as well, including acquiring precious papers implicating an Indian prince’s conspiracy with Russians to the north. One of his accomplishments in to quell an Indian uprising and in this he is aided by Muhtab, a Muslim, and Hareem, a Hindi – and nowhere is their quisling role questioned. (I read a similar short story to this in which a British boy singlehandedly quells a riot, in the collection titled The Man Who Would Be King, and no, it’s not ironic.)\n\nKipling was an old colonialist, after all, and everything I’ve ever read by this author champions the British Raj and the Empire. It’s a fair bet that he’d never have got a Nobel Prize in these post-colonial days!\n\nI finished reading it and journalled it on the 1st of November, 2003.\n\nThis is one that I had on my shelves, unread, since I was a girl, and I finally got around to it a couple of Christmas holidays ago. It wasn’t a match for my reading mood at the time, though I was glad to have finally read it, and I wondered if I would have enjoyed it more or less had I actually gotten to it when I was a kid. (The parable bits would have completely flown past me and I probably would have dutifully swallowed the colonial aspects of the story; I think I would have liked how knowing the boy seemed to be, in comparison to many of the older characters. LOL)"
