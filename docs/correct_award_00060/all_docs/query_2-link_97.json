They apparently objected not to its sentiments but to other works by its author that they saw as endorsements of their country’s past empire-building.\n\nThere you have, in a nutshell, a central problem with what’s become known as the “cancel culture.” It’s indiscriminate.\n\nOnce you run afoul of its thought police — whether you’re a writer, an artist, or a musician — all of your work becomes tainted by association with the offending part. An across-the-board condemnation denies that anything you do might have merit for anyone.\n\nThe first English-language Nobel laureate in literature\n\nPerhaps no great author’s work shows harms of that approach better than that of Rudyard Kipling, who in 1907 became the first English-language winner of the Nobel Prize for Literature.\n\nFor more than 150 years, his fiction and poetry were rightly among the world’s most admired."
