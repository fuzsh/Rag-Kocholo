He returned after completing his studies and worked as a journalist and writer for several years. Kipling made his name as a novelist, poet and short-story writer, through iconic works like The Jungle Book, Kim, ‘If’ and Plain Tales from the Hills. He was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1907. He was also awarded the Gold Medal of the Royal Society of Literature in 1926."
