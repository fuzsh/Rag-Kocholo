He soon became famous for his stories and poetry, which often feature the heat, strife, and ennui of India and romanticize British imperialism. While in the US in the 1890s, he published The Jungle Book and The Second Jungle Book, stories of the boy Mowgli in the Indian jungle that have become children's classics. In 1907, he became the first English language writer to win what award?

He was also the youngest recipient to receive the award to date, at forty-one years old. Kipling was nominated that year by Oxford professor, Charles Oman. The prize citation read that it was “in inconsideration of the power of observation, originality of imagination, virility of ideas and remarkable talent for narration which characterize the creations of this world-famous author.”\n\nhttps://archive.bookstr.com/article/rudyard-kipling-awarded-nobel-prize-on-this-day-in-1907/"
