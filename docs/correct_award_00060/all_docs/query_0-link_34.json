        "text": "The Years Between - 1st Edition\n\nRudyard Kipling\n\nA rather charming first edition, dark red buckram boards, lettered in gold on spine in almost Fine condition, some isolated foxing spots on rough-trimmed fore-edges, spine ever so lightly sunned, top edges gilt. Many pages still unopened. In the scarce dust-wrapper, with a few minor, closed tears. With 32 pages of Methuen's advertisement, bound in at the end, as required. Richards A320, Martindell 164, Livingston 442, Stewart 434.\n\nThis title seems to refer to Kipling's years between the onset of the war in South Africa and the conclusion of the Great War in Europe. The collection contains forty-five poems and a series of epitaphs; 8vo; [xvi],149, 32 pages.\n\nAward Winner\n\nRudyard Kipling\n\nJoseph Rudyard Kipling was born December 30, 1865, English author and poet, born in Bombay, best known for The Jungle Book.Kipling split his boyhood between the markets of Bombay India and an abusive English foster home. His life of travel and tragedy led to two near nervous breakdowns, but made his creative work accessible to both the aristocracy and the common man. He died on January 18, 1936 as one of the most famous and highly paid writers of his time.\n\nIn 1907, Kipling was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature.\n\nsee other books by this author"
