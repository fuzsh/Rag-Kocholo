        "text": "This speech about Kipling was delivered by C.D. af Wirsén when the Nobel Prize Committee presented Kipling with his Nobel Prize in Literature on December 10, 1907. Kipling was the first English writer to receive this award.\n\nNot only does this site unite Kipling fans online, but it also provides an incredibly useful collection of facts and online texts by and about Kipling.\n\nAs a liberal anti-imperialist, British author George Orwell (known for his novels 1984 and Animal Farm) really tears into Kipling in this fascinating essay. Though we don't totally agree with all aspects of his assessments of Kipling's work, Orwell raises a lot of fascinating points.\n\nFor more on the historical context of Kim, not only does this site include facts about the British colonization of India, but it also contains recommendations for further off- and online reading.\n\nIf you're looking for proof of Kipling's celebrity status as a poet of the British Empire, look no further than Westminster Abbey. Westminster Abbey is the place where all of the kings and queens of England have been crowned since the Norman invasion of 1066; it's also where a lot of England's most important political and artistic figures have been buried. Kipling's grave lies at the Abbey, next to famous English authors Charles Dickens and Thomas Hardy.\n\nOkay, we admit it: we're throwing this one in here because the title is hilarious. It's a short silent film based on Kipling's poem \"The Vampire.\" Sadly, since it's so old and so silent that we'll probably never actually see it.\n\nWe're including this one for the sake of completeness, but the IMDb entry tells us almost nothing about it—we're guessing that this adaptation didn't make a splash even when it was released over fifty years ago.\n\nThis TV movie stars Peter O'Toole as the lama, back when Hollywood thought it was okay to have white actors play other ethnicities in film (in case you're not sure—it's not okay now, and it wasn't okay then). Frankly, his makeup looks quite creepy.\n\nKipling lived in Sussex for much of his later life, so a lot of his personal correspondence and manuscripts have wound up at the University of Sussex Library."
