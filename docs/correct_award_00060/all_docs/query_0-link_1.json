        "text": "Award\n\n1907 Nobel Prize in LiteratureRudyard KiplingDate\n\n10 October 1907 (announcement)\n\n10 December 1907\n\n(ceremony)\n\nLocationStockholm, SwedenPresented bySwedish AcademyFirst awarded1901WebsiteOfficial website\n\n← 1906 · Nobel Prize in Literature · 1908 →\n\nThe 1907 Nobel Prize in Literature was awarded to the British writer Rudyard Kipling (1865–1936) \"in consideration of the power of observation, originality of imagination, virility of ideas and remarkable talent for narration which characterize the creations of this world-famous author.\"[1] He is the first English-language writer to receive the prize, and being aged 41, is its youngest recipient to date.[2][3]\n\nLaureate[edit]\n\nMain article: Rudyard Kipling\n\nRudyard Kipling praised the British colonial empire in his works as a poet, short story author, journalist, and novelist, which made his poetry well-liked in the British Army. Children all across the globe have grown to know and love him as a result of The Jungle Book (1894), especially because of Disney's 1967 motion picture adaptation. The Swedish Academy said that Kipling's human portraits and social environment descriptions that \"penetrate to the substance of things\" rather than merely repeating the fleeting\" were his distinctive qualities.[4][5] His classic literary works include Kim (1901), the Just So Stories (1902) and many short stories, including The Man Who Would Be King (1888).[4][6]\n\nDeliberations[edit]\n\nNominations[edit]\n\nKipling was nominated four times beginning in 1904. He was nominated in 1907 by Charles Oman, professor of modern history at the University of Oxford, which later led to him being awarded the Nobel prize.[7]\n\nIn total, the Swedish Academy received 37 nominations for 21 writers. The highest number of nominations – five nominations – were for the Italian writer Angelo de Gubernatis followed by American theologian Borden Parker Bowne with four nominations. Eight of the nominees were nominated first-time such as Holger Drachmann, Eduardo Benot, Andrés Manjón,[a] Àngel Guimerà, and Paul Bourget. Selma Lagerlöf is the only female nominee for that year.[8]\n\nThe authors Thomas Bailey Aldrich, Mary Elizabeth Coleridge, Mary De Morgan, Charles Guérin, Louise Granberg, Benedikt Sveinbjarnarson Gröndal, Bogdan Petriceicu Hasdeu, Joris-Karl Huysmans, Alfred Jarry, Mkrtich Khrimian, Hector Malot, David Masson, Bertram Fletcher Robinson, André Theuriet, Marko Vovchok, Iosif Vulcan, and Stanisław Wyspiański died in 1907 without having been nominated for the prize. The British minister Ian Maclaren and Spanish academic Eduardo Benot died months before the announcement.\n\nOfficial list of nominees and their nominators for the prize No. Nominee Country Genre(s) Nominator(s) 1 Eduardo Benot Rodríguez (1822–1907) Spain poetry, drama, essays Daniel de Cortázar Larrubia (1844–1927) 2 João Bonança (1836–1924) Portugal law, essays Teófilo Braga (1843–1924) 3 Paul Bourget (1852–1935) France novel, short story, literary criticism, essays René Bazin (1853–1932) 4 Borden Parker Bowne (1847–1910) United States philosophy, theology, essays\n\nEdwin Holt Hughes (1866–1950)\n\nLemuel Herbert Murlin (1861–1935)\n\nWilliam Henry Crawford (1855–1944)\n\nAlbert Knudson (1873–1953)\n\n5 Georg Brandes (1842–1927) Denmark literary criticism, essays 6 Angelo de Gubernatis (1840–1913) Italy drama, essays, philology, poetry\n\nFrancesco Lorenzo Pullè (1850–1934)\n\nAngelo Valdarnini (1847–1930)\n\nPaolo Boselli (1838–1932)\n\nGaspare Finali (1829–1914)\n\nTancredi Canonico (1828–1908)\n\n7 Holger Drachmann (1846–1908) Netherlands poetry, drama Harald Høffding (1843–1931) 8 Antonio Fogazzaro (1842–1911) Italy novel, poetry, short story Eugène-Melchior de Vogüé (1848–1910) 9 Ángel Guimerá Jorge (1845–1924) Spain drama, poetry Joaquim Miret i Sans (1858–1919)[c] 10 Rudyard Kipling (1865–1936) Great Britain short story, novel, poetry Charles Oman (1860–1946) 11 Selma Lagerlöf (1858–1940) Sweden novel, short story\n\nFredrik Wulff (1845–1930)\n\nAdolf Noreen (1854–1925)\n\nGottfrid Billing (1841–1925)\n\n12 Ian Maclaren (1850–1907) Great Britain short story, novel, theology, essays Waldemar Rudin (1833–1921) 13 Andrés Manjón y Manjón (1846–1923) Spain pedagogy, theology, essays, law Ángel Sánchez-Rubio Ibáñez (1852–1910) 14 Marcelino Menéndez Pelayo (1856–1912) Spain history, philosophy, philology, poetry, translation, literary criticism 15 George Meredith (1828–1909) Great Britain novel, poetry Mary Augusta Ward (1851–1920) 16 John Morley (1838–1923) Great Britain biography, literary criticism, essays 15 members of the Incorporated Society of Authors 17 Lewis Morris (1833–1907) Great Britain poetry, songwriting, essays 18 George Lansing Raymond[e] (1839–1929) United States essays, philosophy Charles Needham (1848–1935) 19 Georgios Souris[f] (1852–1919) Kingdom of Greece poetry, songwriting, essays\n\nNikolaos Levidis (1868–1942)[g]\n\nGeorgios Hatzidakis (1848–1941)\n\n9 members of the Greek Artists' Association\n\n20 Algernon Charles Swinburne (1837–1909) Great Britain poetry, drama, literary criticism, novel\n\n28 members of the Incorporated Society of Authors\n\nCarl Bildt (1850–1931)\n\n21 Jaroslav Vrchlický (1853–1912) Austria-Hungary\n\n(Czechoslovakia) poetry, drama, translation\n\nBohuslav Raýman (1852–1910)[h]\n\nJosef Hlávka (1831–1908)[h]\n\nPrize decision[edit]\n\nIn 1907, the highly influential member of the Nobel committee Carl David af Wirsén advocated a prize for Algernon Charles Swinburne, but ultimately Wirsén chose to support Rudyard Kipling's candidacy as a way of blocking another strong candidate, Selma Lagerlöf, whose writing Wirsén disliked, from being awarded. Hence, Kipling was chosen by the Nobel Committee as the laureate.[10]\n\nReactions[edit]\n\nThe choice of Rudyard Kipling was very well received. Kipling was widely celebrated by both the Swedish press and public crowds when he arrived in Stockholm to accept the prize.[11]\n\nAward Ceremony[edit]\n\nAt the award ceremony in Stockholm on 10 December 1907, the Permanent Secretary of the Swedish Academy, Carl David af Wirsén, praised both Kipling and three centuries of English literature, saying:\n\n\"The Swedish Academy, in awarding the Nobel Prize in Literature this year to Rudyard Kipling, desires to pay a tribute of homage to the literature of England, so rich in manifold glories, and to the greatest genius in the realm of narrative that that country has produced in our times.\"[12]\n\nNotes[edit]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n[edit]"
