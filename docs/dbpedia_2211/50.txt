Justin Rose and Paul Lawrie have reached their highest-ever positions on the world rankings after sharing second at Wentworth.

British duo reach career-highs in world rankings

Justin Rose and Paul Lawrie could not beat Luke Donald at Wentworth, but finishing joint runners-up has enabled both of them to match their highest-ever positions on the world rankings. While Donald replaced Rory McIlroy as number one again on the back of his four-shot triumph, Rose climbed from tenth to sixth and Lawrie from 40th to 29th. Among the players 43-year-old Lawrie has overtaken is Martin Laird, making him Scotland's top-ranked player for the first time in his career. In America, Jason Dufner just missed out on a third win in four starts, eventually being beaten by Zach Johnson at the Crowne Plaza Invitational. However, his runner-up finish was still good enough for him to enter the world's top 10 for the first time - he improves from 14th to eighth, while Johnson jumps from 27th to 17th.
