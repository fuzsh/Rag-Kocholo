        "text": "When the words Aberdeen and golf are combined, the one name that rightfully springs to mind is Paul Lawrie.\n\nThat remarkable win in the 1999 Open Championship to life the Claret Jug. The unforgettable meltdown of Jean van de Velde in that excruciating play-off.\n\nLawrie can easily stake his claim as not only one of Scotland's most accomplished male golfers but one of the greatest sporting exports to ever come out of the north-east.\n\nREAD MORE: Ester Sokler profiled as Slovenian striker close to agreeing Aberdeen switch\n\nHowever, one Aberdeen man's astonishing victory in a major championship has been consigned to history. The U.S Open rolls into the ultra-exclusive Los Angeles Country Club this week where the multi-millionaires of golf will do battle for the top honour.\n\nThe golfing landscape looks radically different to that of 1925 when unassuming Aberdonian Willie Macfarlane was crowned U.S Open winner.\n\nSome of his compatriots have come close but to this date, he is the last Scot to have lifted the trophy with that feat unlikely to be replicated anytime soon.\n\nScotland's golfing heritage is undisputed and the popularity grew exponentially from the country's coastal sands to far-flung corners of the globe.\n\nMacfarlane, born in the Granite City in 1889, set off for the United States aged 19 in order to seek work as a club professional, a post mostly held by Brits in the early 20th century.\n\nTournament golf eventually followed for the north-east man who impressively finished in the top 20 in his U.S Open debut in 1912. Macfarlane's maiden win on the PGA Tour would come four years later with 1916 also seeing him reach the semi-finals of the PGA Championship.\n\nHe would finish eighth in the 1920 U.S Open before claiming victory in the next year's Philadelphia Open Championship. However, his legacy would be truly cemented in Worcester, Massachusetts in 1925.\n\nThat year's tournament was the last where the first and second rounds would be played in the same day. True pioneers of the sport made up the leaderboard including Walter Hagen and Gene Sarazen.\n\nMacfarlane would gatecrash the afternoon, shooting a tournament record 67 to tie first with Leo Diegel on one-under-par. The Scot maintained his lead in the third round but creeping up the leaderboard was a young amateur named Bobby Jones.\n\nAmerican hotshot Jones had won the U.S Open two years prior and was still to solidify his status as one of the greatest to have ever played the game after his immortal 1930 Grand Slam.\n\nMacfarlane appeared to be crumbling under the pressure and Jones managed to force a play-off. This was the era before sudden death and another 18 holes were scheduled.\n\nIncredibly, both players carded a 75 and the United States Golf Association ordered another 18 be played. Akin to a gruelling 15-round boxing fight, Macfarlane and Jones slugged it out on the fairways, hoping their opponent would blink.\n\nIt all came down to the 108th and last hole of the tournament. Macfarlane made a par of four and Jones scored a bogey five. His victory stands the test of time, despite it being his sole major championship.\n\nAnd it was clear to see that Macfarlane was highly regarded by his peers. Paul Runyan, a two-time major winner, wrote in his 1963 Book for Senior Golfers that Macfarlane, described as a \"tall wisp of a man\", had a masterful swing.\n\nThe Aberdonian, who died in 1961 aged 72, racked up 21 PGA Tour victories throughout his career and remains among an elite number of golfers to have achieved such a feat.\n\nREAD NEXT\n\nCalvin Ramsay joins Preston North End as ex-Aberdeen star sent on loan by Liverpool"
