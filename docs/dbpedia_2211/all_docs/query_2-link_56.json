        "text": "South Ayrshire Council are delighted to announce that Pangaea Golf Architecture, in association with Paul Lawrie, have been appointed to develop initial design concepts to improve the playing experience at Darley and Belleisle golf courses.\n\nDetailed site analysis has already begun, which will include topographical and ecological surveys, and initial design concepts will be available in the summer.\n\nPangaea Golf Architecture is a leading golf consultancy practice with 20 years of experience in the industry. Paul Lawrie, world-renowned professional golfer and previous winner of The Open and Ryder Cup, will have an input into the re-designs for both courses.\n\nOnce the initial design concepts are pulled together, they will be shared via a consultation to allow the public to have their say on the future of the courses.\n\nCouncillor Brian Connolly, South Ayrshire Council's Portfolio Holder for Sport and Leisure, said: \"I'm delighted that plans are moving forward at Darley and Belleisle courses with the appointment of Pangaea Golf Architecture. This project highlights our commitment to enriching our golfing legacy. We really value our players feedback, so I'd encourage everyone to have a look at the design concepts and take part in the consultation once it is open.\n\n\"It's also really exciting to have Paul Lawrie involved - his world-wide reputation as a Major winner and Ryder Cup player makes Mr Lawrie the ideal man to oversee this project. Add in his renowned reputation created by his Paul Lawrie Foundation and the Paul Lawrie Golf Centre, and we have the ideal person to help us establish our Golf Development Academy. We're all looking forward to working with Paul and Pangaea.\"\n\nCouncillor Alec Clark, South Ayrshire Council's Portfolio Holder for Tourism, Culture and Rural Affairs said: \"This is fantastic news and demonstrates our commitment to making South Ayrshire a thriving destination for tourists and visitors.\n\n\"We're already known for our stunning scenery and this makes our golf courses extremely popular. I'm excited to see the initial design concepts for the courses, which I know will ensure they continue to attract golfers from South Ayrshire and beyond, for many years to come. With Pangaea's and Paul's combined expertise, we're poised to elevate both courses to new heights.\""
