        "text": "Home : Historical Center > Dorchester Water System History\n\nHISTORY OF DORCHESTER WATER SYSTEM\n\nEven before the sewer project got off to a good start; the WPA was\n\ntelling Dorchester’s elected officials that now is the time to start\n\nthinking about putting in a central water system. While indoor\n\nplumbing is nice; it is even better if you have water with which to\n\nwash down any materials that reside in the bowl.\n\nOf course, this was the right action to take and so on July 30, 1938\n\na special meeting was called to discuss the pros and cons.\n\nAugust 2, 1938 — Board Considers Possible Village Water System\n\nTo Discuss Problem Of Preliminary Survey This Evening\n\nDorchester’s village board members gathered in a special meeting\n\nSaturday evening to consider the possibilities of obtaining a PWA\n\ngrant for the installation of a water system in the village.\n\nFollowing a lengthy discussion and explanation of the proposed setup\n\nfor such a system by Frank J. Davy of La Crosse, consulting engineer,\n\nthe board voted to file application with the federal government for\n\na possible PWA grant. When a tie resulted in the balloting,\n\nPresident J.E. Allar voted to file the application. Filing of the\n\napplication, however, was held over until the regular meeting of the\n\nboard tonight, Tuesday when the members will decide whether or\n\nnot to pay the necessary engineering fees for a survey of the water\n\nsystem; the plans for which must accompany the filing of the\n\napplication for a grant.\n\nEngineer Davy explained that though an application is made and\n\nfederal officials approve the grant, the project would have to be\n\nsubmitted to a vote of the residents of the village for their approval.\n\nSaturday’s meeting was called pursuant to notice by three members\n\nof the board; following receipt of an informative letter from Mr.\n\nDavy in which he stated that a deadline for projects had been set at\n\nAugust 31 and unless applications were filed by August 1, federal\n\nfunds probably would not be available later.\n\nUnder the proposed PWA setup 45 per cent of the funds would be\n\nsupplied by the federal government, the remaining 55 per cent to be\n\npaid by a utility bond issue or mortgage on the water plant.\n\nThis mortgage would be issued for 20, 25 or 40 years or whatever\n\nperiod of time was deemed necessary; the mortgage to be paid for\n\nout of earnings of the water system.\n\nPWA differs from WPA ( Works Progress Administration) (in which all\n\nlabor is paid for by the federal government) in that all labor is let by\n\ncontract. Completion of the building of the water system would\n\nprobably be accomplished in six months, Davy stated. Cost of\n\nbuilding the proposed system and water plant would approximate\n\n$40,200. Of this amount PWA would pay $18,000 or 45 per cent of\n\nthe total cost of the project and the remaining $22,200 would be\n\npaid with the utility bond issue.\n\nDuring the discussion it was brought out that the cost to the village\n\nto receive the $18,000 grant would be the $100 charged by the\n\nengineer for services in making the preliminary survey for the water\n\nsystem; that whether or not the project was approved by the voters\n\nof the village and the grant by the PWA, the village would not be\n\nrefunded the $100 charged by the engineer for his services. That\n\ninsurance rates on property in the village would be reduced one third\n\nor about $1100 if an approved system was built; that this saving in\n\ninsurance would in return be paid by the village to the water plant in\n\nthe form of a hydrant rental. This hydrant rental would be paid on\n\nthe basis of $50 per hydrant per year. With 20 such hydrants\n\nnecessary, a total of $1,000 would be paid to the water system as\n\nhydrant rental. It was also pointed out that with earnings from users\n\nof the water and hydrant rental, the proposed water system would\n\nbe paid for in approximately 20 to 25 years.\n\nAugust 2, 1938 — Defer Action On Possible Village Water System\n\nFurther discussion in regard to the appropriation of funds for a survey\n\nof the village for a village system project has been deferred for the\n\npresent by the village board, President J. E. Allar has announced.\n\nBoard members in regular meeting Tuesday evening tabled the\n\nmatter following receipt of announcement from federal works\n\nadministration officials that the deadline for filing applications had\n\nbeen extended from August 31, to September 30.\n\nThe board in special meeting July 30 had voted to file application for\n\na village water system project, plans for which are required to be\n\nsubmitted with the application. Costs of a preliminary survey and of\n\na special election, which would be necessary to get approval of\n\nvillage residents before the federal works administration would grant\n\nfunds for a WPA project, are deciding factors in deferring further\n\ndiscussion by the board for the present, the president stated.\n\nMarch 14, 1939 — Village Board To Act On Water Resolution\n\nElectors Will Vote On Question at the April 4 Election\n\nMembers of the Dorchester village board will meet Friday evening to\n\nconsider the adoption or rejection of a resolution to construct a\n\nwater works system in the village, according to notice by Clerk S.C.\n\nSorenson in this issue of the Clarion. The meeting will be held at\n\n8 p.m. in the village hall.\n\nThe water works resolution was introduced at a meeting of the board\n\nTuesday evening after 29 electors had presented a petition February\n\n7 requesting the village fathers to investigate the possibilities of\n\nobtaining a grant from the Works Progress Administration. Favorable\n\naction on the resolution by the board will give electors an\n\nopportunity to vote on the question at the coming April 4th election.\n\nThe resolution provides for the construction of a waterworks system,\n\nincluding the laying of water mains, erection of hydrants,\n\nconstruction of a pump house and reservoir and a well to supply the\n\nnecessary water.\n\nTo provide for the cost of the project, water works bonds in the\n\namount of $30,000 with interest at 5 per cent would be issued by the\n\nvillage against the system. Labor on the project would be supplied\n\nby the federal government.\n\nThe amount of the bonds would be paid for over a period of years,\n\nthe length of time to be designated by the village, from income (such\n\nas hydrant rental and the periodic charge for use of water by the\n\nindividual residents) derived from the operation of the water system,\n\nofficials state. The bonds would be a direct charge against the water\n\nsystem and would not be payable from any funds raised for other\n\nvillage purposes, according to section 66.06 of the Wisconsin\n\nStatutes.\n\nMarch 30, 1939 — Mass Meeting Friday Evening - Pros and Cons of\n\nWater System to be Discussed\n\nA mass meeting for all the voters of Dorchester will be held Friday\n\nevening at 8:30 at the Opera House in order to give everyone a\n\nchance to hear the discussion for and against the water system,\n\nwhich will be decided in the April 4th election. One of the members\n\nof the state board of health from Madison will be present to give\n\nfacts on the matter, as well as Mr. Frank Davy, engineer on the\n\nproject. Now that the sewerage system has been installed, each\n\nvoter in the community has an interest in the completion of the\n\nmodernizing project outlined for Dorchester; and everyone should be\n\npresent to take part in this vitally interesting discussion. This\n\nmeeting will give each side of the question a chance to be aired, so\n\nthat the election results will be for the best of the community.\n\nApril 6, 1939 — Walter Referendum Passed By 35 Vote Margin\n\n118 Votes For Waterworks and 83 Against\n\nVoters in the Village of Dorchester went to the polls on Tuesday to\n\ndecide whether or not they would endorse the resolution asking that\n\nthe village install a waterworks plant. When the final vote was\n\ncounted, the ballots read 118 for and 83 against the resolution.\n\nThis means that in the very near future the village will be able to\n\ncontinue with its program for making Dorchester a better place in\n\nwhich to live.\n\nAlthough the vote was not quite as close as some observers had\n\npredicted it would be, it was close enough to show that public\n\nopinion was pretty was pretty well divided. Total number of votes\n\ncast on the referendum question was 203 with 2 ballots blank.\n\nIn the Judicial election for Justice of the Supreme Court, Marvin B.\n\nRosenberry won in the Village with 67 votes, Gerhard A. Hagerdorr\n\nwas second with 32 votes and Wm Markham was third with 27 votes.\n\nEmery W. Crosby running unopposed for Circuit Court Judge had 118\n\nvotes.\n\nMay 11, 1939 — Village Water Works Bonds Sold Tuesday – Contract\n\nfor test well let to Haupt Co., Bonds to Chicago firm.\n\nAt a special meeting of the Village Board last Tuesday evening, the\n\ncontract for the test well was awarded to the Haupt Well Co. of\n\nAuburndale, Wisconsin and the Village water works bonds were sold\n\nto the T.E. Joiner Co. Inc. Of Chicago.\n\nBids were received from four bonding houses for the privilege of\n\nhandling the Village water works bonds. The companies entering\n\nbids were Channer Securities Co. Chicago, Mairs Shanghnessey and\n\nCo. St. Paul, Harley Haydon and Co. Madison, and T.E. Joiner and Co.\n\nInc. Chicago.\n\nMr. H.B. Heign, vice president, of the T.E. Joiner Co. was present at\n\nthe meeting. The T.E. Joiner Co. Bid of $29,500 for the bonds with\n\nthe interest rate set at 4 per cent was accepted by the board.\n\nThree well drilling companies submitted bids for the drilling of the\n\ntest well. The contract was awarded to the Haupt well Co. Of\n\nAuburndale, Wis. With a bid of $176.00. This bid was less than half\n\nof those submitted by the other two companies whose quotations\n\namounted to about $350 each. With the sale of the bonds and the\n\ntest contract out of the way, the Village now has a good start on the\n\nproject and a sound basis on which to work.\n\nMay 25, 1939 — Second Test Well Started Near High School\n\nThe first test well sunk by the Haupt Well Co. has proven\n\nunsatisfactory for use as the source for Dorchester water, so a new\n\nwell had to be started. The second well is being drilled on the\n\nAdolph Karrup property about 50 yards from the first attempt. Test\n\nwell No. 1 went through clay formation to a depth of 30 feet. Water\n\nwas struck at 28 feet but was unsatisfactory. Quite a few boulders\n\nwere hit and when they reached 40 feet they struck a granite\n\nformation. Usable water had been struck but the flow was too slow\n\nto be of any value as a village well. When the drillers hit granite,\n\nthe state geologist advised them to discontinue and try another site.\n\nThe second well was started on the Karrup property and is now down\n\nto a depth of 40 feet with all indications pointing toward a good\n\nwell. The drillers are now into good gravel about 3 feet.\n\nMr. Haupt estimates that the water supply will be good at a depth of\n\nabout 50 feet. Water was first struck in the second well at the 26\n\nfoot level but the flow was slow. At 33 feet gravel was encountered\n\nand the water came up to within 16 feet of the top of the well\n\ncasing. The gravel vein was lost again between 35 and 37 feet and\n\nthen reappeared. The drilling has now reached a depth of 40 feet\n\nand is in a good gravel vein. All traces of mud and clay have\n\nvanished and it is certain that this well will easily meet the\n\nrequirements of the State. Mr. F. Haupt, Emil Haupt and Wm Jadack\n\nare doing the drilling for The Haupt well Co. of Auburndale, Wis.\n\nJune 1, 1939 — Dorchester Will Have Good Water Supply\n\nTest Well shows capacity will run much more than will be needed\n\nThe second test well, drilled on the Adolph Karrup property near the\n\nhigh school has all the indications of being a number one source for\n\nDorchester water. On the first test they were able to throw 60\n\ngallons of water per minute without lowering the water level below\n\n25 feet. Mr. Haupt, the driller and Mr. Davy, the engineer believe\n\nthat the regular well when it is put in will give an ample supply of\n\nwater for the village, even when the consumption reaches its\n\nmaximum. It is pointed out that the test well is only a six inch shaft,\n\nwhile the regular well will be 10 inches in diameter.\n\nThe test shaft is down into 11 ½ feet of good water producing gravel\n\nand resting right on bed-rock. There are 37 feet of water in the\n\nshaft when the well is idle.\n\nA second test was started on this well yesterday with a larger pump.\n\nThe well is now throwing between 85 and 90 gallons per minute and\n\nthe water level in the shaft is staying constant at 22 feet. Mr. M.E.\n\nVircks, who is checking the well for the village says that the pump\n\nwas throwing as high as 125 gallons a minute for a while yesterday\n\nafternoon without lowering the supply in the shaft to any degree.\n\nWhen the contract for the test well was awarded it stipulated that\n\nthe flow must be 80 gallons per minute before the well was\n\nacceptable as an accurate test.\n\nJune 15, 1939 — Dorchester Is Allotted $44,311 By Government\n\nTelegrams from Senator/Congressman advise Approval of funds\n\nS.C. Sorenson Dorchester, Wisconsin advised today Dorchester\n\nproject approved for $44,311 — Signed, Merlin Hull, M.C. Such was\n\nthe message received by S.C. Sorenson, Village Clerk, last Tuesday\n\nafternoon from merlin Hull - 9th Dist. Congressman. Although the\n\nfinal papers have not yet been received from Washington,\n\nCongressman Hull bases his good news on the most reliable authority.\n\nAnother telegram received by Dr. F.P. Foley, village president,\n\nWednesday afternoon from Senator Wiley read as follows: Village\n\nPresident, Dorchester Wisconsin. The President has approved WPA\n\nproject NX 31231 to construct water system through Dorchester in\n\namount of $44,311 – stop – Suggest you contact state administrator\n\nfor final approval which depends on availability of funds and\n\npresence of certified relief labor. Signed, Alexander Wiley, USS.\n\nThe village will realize $29,550 on the sale of the Waterworks bonds,\n\nwhich with the WPA grant of $44,311 gives a total of $73,861 for the\n\ninstallation of the system. This assures Dorchester of enough money\n\nto install the right kind of system in the right way.\n\nDorchester is indeed fortunate to have a group of men on the village\n\nboard who are willing to put forth the needed energy and time to put\n\nthis work across. The average citizen is probably not aware of the\n\nwork a project like this requires. It is one thing to want a federal\n\ngrant of this kind and another to be able to receive it.\n\nCongratulations to our village board.\n\nWater Test Excellent — While the test well was in operation, the\n\nState required that samples be taken after 12 hours of continuous\n\npumping and again after 24 hours. These samples were sent to the\n\nState Hygenic Laboratories for purification and iron tests. The\n\nVillage was notified Wednesday that the water is safe on all counts\n\nand its degree of hardness is exceptionally low, which is very good.\n\nJune 29, 1939 — Service Commission Approves Water project\n\nProject receives final State and National Sanction\n\nThe Wisconsin Public Service Commission has officially authorized the\n\nvillage of Dorchester to establish a municipal water utility at a cost\n\nof about $71,700.\n\nThis money is being raised by a bond issue of $29,500 and a WPA\n\ngrant for the balance of the cost. The official certificate issued by\n\nthe commission reads as follows: It is hereby certified: That the\n\nvillage of Dorchester is authorized to render water service as a public\n\nutility in the village of Dorchester. Dated at Madison, Wis. this 26th\n\nday of June, 1939. Public Service Commission of Wis. By Fred S.\n\nHunt and Robert A. Nixon. This action clears the way toward actual\n\nstarting of the project. The village board plans to accept bids on the\n\nwell drilling and the materials necessary for the installation of the\n\nsystem as soon as possible.\n\nAug. 3, 1939 — Bids On Materials For Water project Opened Thursday\n\nThe Village Board were kept busy last Thursday afternoon as they\n\nopened bids for materials and contracts for the Dorchester water\n\nsystem. The engineer for the project, Mr. Frank Davy of La Crosse,\n\nthe village attorney , Mr. Vorland, and bidders representing different\n\nconcerns were also present. Thirty one bids were opened and read,\n\nbut no contracts were let. The bids will be acted on at another\n\nmeeting of the board. Mr. Davy estimates that the bids on the\n\nmaterials run about $3,000; under the estimates made when the\n\nproject was set up. Tabulation of the bids is not yet complete but\n\nwill be available for publication next week.\n\nAugust 3, 1939 — Rehearing On Water Works Tomorrow A.M.\n\nThe re-hearing before the Wisconsin Public Service Commission on the\n\nDorchester Water project will be held at the village hall tomorrow\n\nmorning at 10:00 o’clock. The new hearing was granted after a\n\npetition bearing names of Dorchester residents and taxpayers opposed\n\nto the project had been presented to the commission. The\n\ncommission had already granted the village authority to proceed with\n\nconstruction of the water system, but has granted this hearing in\n\norder to settle the question so it will be perfectly clear to everyone.\n\nThe hearing is being held here in Dorchester in order to give anyone\n\nand everyone the opportunity to express their sentiments for or\n\nagainst the project.\n\nAugust 17, 1939 — Waterworks project Receives P.S.C. Okeah\n\nState body upholds first decision — contracts for materials let\n\nA telegram was received here last Friday afternoon stating that the\n\nPublic service Commission had upheld their former decision\n\nauthorizing the Village to put in their waterworks system. The\n\ncirculated petition bearing 72 signatures was sufficient evidence that\n\nthe village could support the project.\n\nAccording to present plans, work will start next Monday with a WPA\n\ncrew of about 40 on the job. The actual drilling of the well should\n\nstart sometime next week. At an adjourned meeting of the Village\n\nBoard last Friday evening details pertaining to the project were taken\n\nup. The lot for the well and standpipe was purchased from Adolph\n\nKarrup for $300.\n\nAfter purchasing the property two new ordinances were read and\n\nadopted. Ordinance No. 31 governs the issuance of $30,000\n\nwaterworks bonds and the payment and other details in respect\n\nthereto. The second Ordinance No. 32 pertains to fire protection to\n\nthe village. These two ordinances will be found in their entirety in\n\nthe minutes of the Village Board meeting in this issue of the Clarion.\n\nThe contract for the well was awarded to the Haupt Well Co.,\n\nAuburndale, Wisconsin. Contract for pipe went to the low bidder, J.\n\nB. Clow & Co., Chicago, Illinois. The hemp and lead contract, valve\n\ncontract, and Contract No. 4 were all awarded to the low bidders.\n\nContract No. 5 for the building and erecting of the water tower was\n\nalso awarded to the lowest bidder, Chicago Bridge and Iron Works,\n\nChicago, Illinois.\n\nAugust 31, 1939 — Work Started On Dorchester Water System\n\nWork is going forward on the Dorchester water system in a speedy\n\nmanner. Shipments of pipe have been received and the WPA crew is\n\nputting it in the ground at a fast pace.\n\nThe well drilling is also progressing nicely. The large casing to the\n\ngravel level is already in the ground and the drillers have a\n\npreliminary six-inch shaft sunk to the bed rock. They now have to put\n\nthe 10-inch casing down for the regular well. No serious trouble has\n\nbeen encountered in the drilling and all indications point to an\n\nexcellent well for the village water supply.\n\nAuthorities are trying to get a line established so that at least a\n\nportion of the village will have water for fire protection before\n\nfreezing weather sets in. Present plans are to accomplish this by\n\nmaking a loop around the block where the well is situated. If work\n\ncontinues at its present pace and the materials arrive on time it is\n\ncertain that the water system will be in operation at an earlier date\n\nthat was at first expected.\n\nSeptember 14, 1939 — Laying Of Pipe delayed By Hard Rain Monday\n\nThe laying of the pipe for the Dorchester water system was delayed\n\nMonday by a severe rain storm. Although 1300 feet of pipe have\n\nalready been put in the ground; the ditches were left open until a test\n\nhas been made to determine whether or not there were any leaks.\n\nThe section along County Trunk “A” was caved in and also a\n\nconsiderable length of ditch on Front Street where pipe had not yet\n\nbeen put down. Mr. Collier, the WPA foreman says that it will take\n\nabout two days to repair the damage caused by the storm.\n\nThe cement gutters on Front street were undermined and some of the\n\nsections fell into the water filled ditches. The delay in laying the pipe\n\nand filling the ditches has been caused by the failure of the proper\n\nmaterials to get here in time. If the WPA crew had had the necessary\n\nequipment they could have been much farther with the project than\n\nthey are now. As soon as the fire hydrants arrive they will be able to\n\nmake a test of the sections as they go along.\n\nSeptember 14, 1939 — GALLONS OF WATER FOR DORCHESTER\n\nHaupt Well Co. – Phone 4304 — Permit 180 — Auburndale, Wisconsin\n\nAnyone want a bath? Of course there may be those who think\n\nthere isn’t enough water coming out of the pipe above to fill a tub.\n\nNaturally that would depend on the size of the tub but when this\n\npicture was taken; there were 600 gallons of water coming out of the\n\nground every minute. The pipe is 6 inches in diameter. This was\n\nduring the preliminary test of the Dorchester well.\n\nA regular test of about 7 hours was run last Saturday. 250 gallons of\n\nwater were pumped from the well every minute of that test and it\n\nlowered the water level only 7 feet, where it remained constant\n\nduring the pumping.\n\nThe well is 51 feet deep, with 11 feet of good gravel at the bottom\n\nand resting on solid rock, The outer casing is 48 inches in diameter\n\nand goes down 24 feet; the well finishing with a 30 inch hole. The\n\ninner casing is of 10-inch pipe with a 10 foot screen at the bottom.\n\nIt is gravel packed and agitated with the water coming to within 17\n\nfeet of the surface when it is not being pumped. The Haupt well\n\nCo., of Auburndale is drilling the well under the personal supervision\n\nof Mr. Frank Haupt, pictured above. Mr. Frank Davy, La Crosse,\n\nvillage engineer inspected the well Tuesday and says he is very well\n\npleased with the results so far.\n\nSeptember 21, 1939 — Fred Distelhorst First To Be Hooked Up With\n\nNew Water System\n\nIt was announced this morning by Milton Collier, WPA foreman, that\n\nFred Distelhorst is the first Dorchester resident to be hooked onto\n\nthe new water system. The pipe has been laid into the house and\n\nnow Mr. Distelhorst is waiting for the time when a circuit will be\n\ncompleted so that he may use the system.\n\nIt is an honor to be the first one on the system and that honor rightly\n\nbelongs to the men who have helped to build Dorchester through the\n\nyears. Mr. Distelhorst has been one of those builders throughout the\n\nyears and by lending his support to this and other projects for the\n\nbetterment of the community; he shows that he is still a “Dorchester\n\nBuilder”.\n\nNovember 2, 1939 — Water project Makes Good Headway\n\nStandpipe ready to go up — pump and filtration tank are purchased\n\nThe Dorchester Water project is moving along in good shape with\n\nwork on the standpipe and pump house already started. The footings\n\nfor the standpipe were laid by the WPA crew while a special crew\n\nfrom the Chicago Bridge and Iron Works, who received the contract\n\nfor the standpipe, will set the giant tower. The WPA crew have also\n\nfinished the foundation for the pump-house and are now ready to go\n\nahead with the building. Contracts awarded: two more contracts\n\nwere awarded at the Meeting of the Village Board last Thursday\n\nevening. The board met in the afternoon to receive the sealed bids\n\nfor the pump and the iron removal tank.\n\nBidders on the pump were: Cochran-Sargent Co.,Crane Co., and\n\nFairbanks-Morse Co., all of St. Paul; Layne N.W., Milwaukee and\n\nPeerless Pump Co., Massilon, Ohio. Bidders on the iron removal tank\n\nwere: International Fitter Co., Chicago; Graver Tank and Mfg. Co.,\n\nEast Chicago, Ill., Water Treatment Co., Rockford, Ill and Permutit\n\nCo., New York.\n\nThe bid of the Peerless Pump Co., of $1,369.84 for the pump was\n\naccepted at the evening meeting of the board as was the bid of the\n\nPermutit Co., for the iron removal tank of $1,870.\n\nContracts for the materials on the pumphouse were also awarded to\n\nthe Ellis Stone Co., and the O & N Lumber Co., Sauter Bros and the\n\nWausau Sand and Gravel Co. With work on the project continuing at\n\nthe present rate, it seems quite certain that part of the system will\n\nbe in operation by January 1st.\n\nDecember 7, 1939 — VILLAGE WATER TOWER IS COMPLETED\n\nFinal Coats of Aluminum Paint Will Be Applied In The Spring\n\nWith the exception of the final coats of aluminum paint, the\n\nDorchester village water tower is now complete. The Chicago Bridge\n\nand Iron works crew finished actual work on the structure Tuesday.\n\nThe final coats of aluminum paint will be applied in the Spring.\n\nThe total height of the structure from the foundation to the fineal or\n\nball at the top is 155 feet. The cylinder running up to the tower is in\n\nfive sections; is five feet in diameter and is 128 1/4 inches high. The\n\nbalcony running around the tank is a standard 24 inch balcony with a\n\n42 inch hand rail. A person would hardly believe it but the height of\n\nthe tank from the walkway to the top water line is 14 feet and ½ inch\n\nand from the water line to the fineal approximately 7 feet. The\n\ndistance from the walkway down to the top of the cylinder is 5 feet 4\n\n½ inches.\n\nThe structure also includes a steel ladder and safety cage starting\n\napproximately 12 feet from the ground and running up on post of the\n\ntower to the fineal on top of the tank. The inside of the tank and\n\ncylinder are painted with two coats of red lead and the outside also\n\nhas received its primary coat of red lead. The outside of the entire\n\nstructure will receive two coats of aluminum paint in the spring. The\n\nname of the village, Dorchester will be painted on the side of the\n\ntank facing County Trunk “A”.\n\nMr. C.L. Black, Branson, Mo., was foreman of the crew doing the\n\nwork. The men working under him were Lad D. Kuffel and Charles D.\n\nKuffel, St. Cloud. Minn., William C. Bilbrui, Crossville, Ill.,R.D. King,\n\nMande, Okla., and Arthur (Bud) Simpson, Abeline, Kansas. In\n\ncommenting on the crew, Mr. Black says that it is one of the best\n\ncrews he has ever had under his supervision in his 15 years as\n\nforeman. The work has been done swiftly and carefully and the\n\nvillage board are certain that the structure will speak for itself in the\n\ntest of time.\n\nJanuary 25, 1940 — M.E. Vircks Is First User Of Village Water\n\nWater was pumped into the standpipe and tank of the Dorchester\n\nwater project yesterday and turned into the mains as far as Paulson’s\n\nGarage. Other valves were opened this morning and the water sent\n\nto its first user. The meter was installed in the Max Vircks home\n\nWednesday and Mr. Vircks was the first to use Village water when he\n\nturned on his faucets today.\n\nThe long awaited skating pond was started today near the Paulson\n\nGarage and should be ready for use in a few days. The first flooding\n\nof the pond will be accomplished while the water (68,000 gallons) is\n\nrun out of the tank after the chlorine purification.\n\nMarch 14, 1940 — Save Money By Having Village Water Put In Now\n\nResidents and property owners of the village have been urged by the\n\nboard and the Engineer in charge to have curb cocks connecting them\n\nto the village water supply put in at the earliest possible moment. By\n\nhaving this done now, it is pointed out, the cost is only eight dollars,\n\nwhereas if the connection isn’t made until after the project has been\n\nclosed, the cost will be in the neighborhood of thirty dollars for the\n\nsame work.\n\nSamples of water were taken from those already connected and sent\n\nto Madison last week for final tests. The results came back this week\n\nshowing that the water tested 100 per cent, meeting all the\n\nrequirements set by ths State Board of Health. All the water now in\n\nuse, with the exception of the extreme south end of the village is\n\nentirely safe for consumption. Final reports taken on the south end\n\nare expected this week.\n\nApril 25, 1940 — Village Residents Again Advised To Make Connections\n\nMr. Davy, engineer on the village water project again wishes to\n\nremind property owners that they should take advantage of the low\n\nprice for hooking onto the village water system while there is still\n\ntime. It is expected that the work will be completed in about six\n\nweeks. Up to that time village residents may hook up to the mains\n\nfor only eight dollars; after completion of the project it will cost\n\nabout $25 to $30 for the same work.\n\nSo why not be wise and order your connection to the village water\n\nnow? Or can’t you use a $17 to $22 saving?\n\nAugust 1, 1940 — INSURANCE RATES for VILLAGE SLASHED\n\nRating Bureau Awards Dorchester a Much Better Fire Protection Rate\n\nThe first real dividend to be realized by Dorchester home owners in\n\nmany years is now materializing due to the installation of waterworks\n\nin the village. In a letter received by Dr. Foley Tuesday from B.J.\n\nWilliams of the Fire Insurance Rating Bureau, he was informed that\n\nthe village classification had dropped from 9th to 7th.\n\nThe letter read in part: We are pleased to be able to notify you that\n\nwith its new water works system Dorchester now qualifies for a\n\n7th classification, which is two steps better than has been in effect\n\nheretofore. A copy of our fire protection report is enclosed for your\n\nfiles. This means that property owners in the village will save from\n\n25 per cent to 45 per cent on their insurance. The new rate book has\n\nnot as yet been issued so definite figures are not yet available for\n\nspecific properties.\n\nA typical example of the saving is as follows: A dwelling with an\n\napproved roof that formerly paid seventy cents per $100 for a three\n\nyear policy now pays only 40 cents for that same protection. Figured\n\nin percentage that is a savings of 42.8 per cent. Naturally the savings\n\nand percentage will vary with the different homes and business places\n\nin the village, but there isn’t a place that will not benefit directly\n\nfrom this new classification.\n\nSeptember 12, 1940 — To Celebrate Water & Sewer Completion\n\nCommercial Club and Businessmen Cooperate in Big Event\n\nThe long awaited, long talked about Dorchester Water and Sewer\n\nCompletion Celebration is now going to be a reality.

The giant tower is 155 feet high and holds 68,000 gallons\n\nof water – 50,00 on th tank and 18,000 in the standpipe.\n\nTotal cost of the water system — exclusive of the sewers — was\n\napproximately $74,000. Public utility bonds were sold for $30,000\n\nand the WPA grant of $44,000 made up the balance.\n\nThe sewer project was started in March 1938 and completed at a cost\n\nof about $32,000. A WPA grant of $29,000 and direct obligation\n\nbonds of the village for $3,000 provided the necessary funds.\n\nSeptember 26, 1940—Water and Sewer Celebration held Last Saturday"
