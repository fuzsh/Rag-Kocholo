        "text": "An Aberdeen cafe is going on the market – with the current owner calling it a “sad day.”\n\nThe Tartan Pig, which is located on the city’s Hollybank Place, opened in 2019 and is well-known for its tasty treats and comforting food.\n\nPosting on Facebook, owner Greig Bain said it is a “great cafe with good returns” and has been “great for the local community and the city.”\n\nHowever, they added that they don’t have the time “to give it the attention it needs.”\n\nIn a post online, he said it was a “sad day today.”\n\nHe added: “Not looking for a huge amount for it. I want someone to take it on and cherish it, and make it further flourish and reach its full potential.\n\n“Ongoing and increasing commitments on the farm forced my hand and I just don’t have the time to give it the attention it needs.”\n\nMr Bain wants a quick sale, saying that he does not “want to hang about”, adding: “It’s a hard enough decision as it is without tagging it out.”\n\nDifficult years for The Tartan Pig\n\nThe cafe has faced a difficult few years.\n\nIn 2020, at the height of Covid-19, the owners expressed their anger after a window was smashed.\n\nAt the time, they said: “As if we haven’t enough on our plate we received a message from a lovely customer of ours tonight to tell us our window has been smashed.\n\n“We truly are at the brink of collapse just like many other local businesses so now more than ever support local and shop local where you can.”\n\nIn March this year, they also said that road closures around Holburn Street were making it “rather difficult” for its customers to get to them.\n\nThey said it was “like a maze” for people to get to the cafe and urged: “Please don’t let this put you off visiting us.”\n\nNew owner should have ‘bucket load of passion’\n\nWhen contacted by The Press and Journal, M Bain added: “Hopefully someone with a bucket load of passion will take it on and it will do them a good turn as it has me.”"
