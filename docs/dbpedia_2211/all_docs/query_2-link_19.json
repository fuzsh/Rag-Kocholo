Brace yourselves for a week of exceptional golfing excellence! My take on golf and leadership. Golf – a sport that combines the serenity of lush green grass blue skies with the frustration of a thousand wrong swings and missed putts. As I find myself committed to the pursuit of a decent swing, I can't help but wonder why on earth I'm putting myself through this rollercoaster of emotions on the golf course. Why does the c-suite play golf? I was advised by my coach/ mentor to continue with learning to play golf to better my leadership skills. Below as I still struggle are my top 3 leadership lessons from golf :) Lesson 1 : Patience & Perseverance On the surface, a golf swing seems like a straightforward motion – just hit the ball, right? Wrong. It's a delicate dance involving body contortions that would make a jalebi jealous. My attempts to mimic the fluidity of the pros often resembles nana Patekar’s moves. But at it, one day will make Saroj Khan proud. Lesson 2 : Emotional Intelligence Successes and failures on the course mirror the highs and lows of leadership. Golf teaches individuals to manage their emotions, stay focused, and remain composed Despite the countless frustrations and the bewildering complexity of golf, there's an undeniable allure that keeps me coming back for more. Is it the challenge, the camaraderie, or the fleeting moments of triumph that make it all worthwhile, like leadership. Lesson 3 : My golf champion mother instilled the principle of playing to one's strengths. Her advice? Focus on what you excel at—chipping and putting—rather than getting stressed with teeing off. This philosophy resonates beyond golf; as a leader, it's about embracing your uniqueness rather than imitating others. In the realm of leadership development, golf stands out as an unexpected yet powerful tool. Beyond the physical aspects of the sport, the mental and emotional challenges it presents contribute significantly to the growth of essential leadership skills. So, the next time you tee off, remember that you're not just playing a game – you're cultivating the skills that will drive your success to be a better leader.

The job has changed so much since I started out. Much for the good, but also in many ways that de-value what great golf coaching adds to a venue. It sometimes feels that organisations see the value of a coach in the number of roles they can perform rather than the quality of the one they’re trained for. And I think that many coaches have started to believe that too. When we work with a coach to add GLF. Connect and our integrated golf programming into their offer, we measure and report the value of their coaching contribution. And not only in the financials. On the impact on the club as a whole On attrition rates On student conversion to membership On customer experience And on the impact on spend across the whole venue. Many clubs can’t believe the value that great coaching brings. And many coaches can’t either. My belief is that’s borne out of a gradual erosion of the perception of importance of a golf coach to a venue. We’re working hard to change that, by measuring value and reporting the facts. And one fact that we show time and time again is that great golf coaching is the cornerstone of a great golf venue. #pgaprofessional #golfcoach #golfcoaching #value\n\nThe Half-Cup Putting Aid, the ultimate golf putting training aid that will transform your putting game!

I only went and WON our National Open! Have you ever felt embarrassed, guilty and proud at the same time? These were exactly my emotions when I realised as the scores were read out, I had actually won the \"FORE\" Business National Open 2024 🏆 Anybody that has been fortunate or unfortunate (in most cases...!) to play golf with me since picking up my new PXG (PARSONS XTREME GOLF) golf clubs will know my golf has been really off. After taking the delivery of my full set of clubs in May I have been really struggling, you only need to view my VPAR to see what I mean!! However, after having time to digest what actually happened yesterday, I have realised that I have been forcing my swing and over thinking my golf, nothing to do with my clubs. After bogeying (for the non golfers 1 shot over par) the 1st hole on Monday with James Hall and Neil Jensen I told them both I was going to keep things really simple....... keep my head down, swing slow and let the clubs do all work, after all they had been personally fitted to me by the experts at PXG. The 1st Business Lesson - Don’t overthink and make things complicated... Just believe in your ideas and stay in zone. If you let things throw you off guard, these annoyances will take over. You can be far too quick with your golf swing (I was) and as we know, running a business is not a sprit, it’s a marathon it needs to be carefully paced out and not forced. Business Lesson Number 2 - Create processes, systems and automation in your business to remove errors and create consistency throughout the business. That's what I did with my swing and process, I just tried to keep things consistent and didn't step outside these systems. It was just one of those days, I got through the front 9 and could see that I was doing particularly well. The challenge was to attempt to keep this going for another 9 holes, I just kept telling myself slow swing, head down and let the clubs do the work. With the help of our friends at VPAR we turned off the live leaderboard after hole 15 so no one knew who the overall winner was. I packed my clubs into the car and headed into the club house, I knew I had played the final 3 holes as best as I could, but you never know until the final announcement. Maybe going to Wimbledon on Sunday where I could see the mind coaches and players communicating to each other put me in the right place, or maybe it was spending a day last week with an incredible guy who has achieved an 8th Dan in Taekwondo and was simply one of the coolest dudes in town helped me.... One thing is for sure, without the help of our friends at PXG there is no doubt in my mind I would have come away named as the \"FORE\" Business Open Champion 🙏 Thanks Guys!!!

However, there's a common misconception about what PGA actually represents. Unlike brands such as Sony, Toshiba, or Ford, which are widely recognized as corporate entities producing specific products, the PGA (Professional Golfers' Association) is often mistakenly thought of as a service or a synonym for professional golf teaching. This misunderstanding overlooks the true nature of PGA as a brand and the evolving landscape of golf instruction. Firstly, it's essential to clarify that the PGA, much like any major brand, is an organization that encompasses various aspects of the golf industry, including organizing tournaments, promoting the sport, and supporting its members. It is not, contrary to popular belief, a blanket term for all professional golf instruction. The branding of PGA carries with it a prestigious connotation, often associated with high-level skill and expertise in golf. However, this does not mean that expertise in golf instruction is exclusive to PGA-certified professionals. The reality is that the ability to teach golf effectively is not solely confined to those who have PGA accreditation. Many skilled golf instructors may not have PGA credentials but possess a deep understanding of the game, honed through personal experience and study. Moreover, the rise of new technology and data analytics in golf has further democratized golf instruction. These advancements have made high-level golf coaching more accessible and less dependent on traditional forms of instruction. Amateur golfers, even those with double-digit handicaps, can offer valuable insights and lessons, sometimes more relatable to the average golfer than those from a PGA professional. Their experiences and understanding of the game can be just as beneficial, if not more so, for certain players. In conclusion, the PGA is a prestigious and recognizable brand in the golf world, it is not synonymous with the entirety of golf instruction. The landscape of golf teaching is evolving, with technology playing a significant role. Golfers\n\nKnowing if you're ready for golf tournaments involves assessing various aspects of your game, mental preparedness, and overall readiness. Here are some indicators that can help you determine if you're prepared to compete in golf tournaments: * Consistent Scoring: Consistency in your scores across multiple rounds of golf is a good indicator that you're ready for tournaments. If you're consistently shooting scores close to or below the tournament's handicap requirements, it's a positive sign. * Practice and Preparation: Evaluate how much time you've dedicated to practicing all aspects of your game, including driving, iron play, chipping, putting, and course management. If you've put in consistent practice and feel confident in your skills, you're likely more prepared. * Course Management Skills: Understand how well you can strategize and manage your way around a golf course. Being able to assess risks, choose the right clubs, and play to your strengths while minimizing mistakes is crucial in tournament play. * Mental Toughness: Golf tournaments can be mentally challenging. Assess your ability to stay focused, manage emotions, and bounce back from setbacks during rounds. Mental toughness is often as important as physical skill in golf. * Experience in Competitive Settings: If you've participated in friendly competitions or smaller-scale tournaments, it can give you a taste of what to expect in more formal tournaments. Experience in competitive settings can help you gauge your readiness for higher-level events. * Knowledge of Rules and Etiquette: Understanding the rules of golf and proper etiquette on the course is essential in tournament play. Make sure you're familiar with the rules of golf as outlined by the USGA or R&A and understand common tournament protocols. * Support System: Consider whether you have a support system in place, such as a coach, caddy, or fellow competitors, who can provide guidance, encouragement, and feedback during tournaments. * Goals and Expectations: Reflect on your goals for participating in tournaments and whether your expectations are realistic based on your current skill level and preparation. * Desire to Compete: Ultimately, your readiness for golf tournaments also depends on your desire to compete and test your skills against others. If you're passionate about the game and eager to challenge yourself in a competitive environment, you're likely ready to give tournaments a try. Assessing these factors can help you determine if you're ready for golf tournaments and identify areas where you may need to focus on improving your readiness. If you're unsure, consider discussing your readiness with a PGA Coach who can provide personalized advice and guidance. #golf #pgacoach #pga #scga #ricmooregolf #welovethisgame\n\nOne month from today, I will take what will likely be the most difficult test I have experienced in my life. I have set out to become a full member of the PGA of America (teaching pro, not a tour pro...very different things. I definitely wouldn't be writing LinkedIn posts if I had the talent to be a tour pro 😂). Before applying for membership, you have to do three things. 1. ✅ Successfully pass a background check It's been a while since I last robbed a bank, so I passed this one with flying colors. 2. ✅ Complete the Qualifying level of the PGA's Professional Golf Management course. I paid my $200, learned about the history of the PGA, studied the rule book, and passed all of the quizzes with 100% scores. 3. 🔜 Pass the PGA's Player Ability Test (PAT) The PAT tests your golf skills. To teach and work in golf, you should also be able to play the game. Makes a lot of sense. In all of the certifications and schooling that I have done, I'm not sure I have had to prove ability like this before. The test is one day. 36 holes. The PGA sets up the course, and players must play the two rounds under double the course rating +15 strokes. In my case, it's under 158 strokes or a scoring average of 79 for each round. There's no hiding behind a late-night cram session or it being an open-book test. I can't write the answers inside a water bottle label and look when I need to. There is no relaying the test questions to the van outside like Vince Vaugn in Old School. It's just me and the golf course. I've played in my fair share of golf tournaments, but none where I'm only competing against myself and the golf course. Does anyone have experience with this type of testing? How did you prepare other than hours of practice? I'd love any and all tips!\n\n\"Great Golf is about Storytelling to Ones-Self\" By now you know how important the Inner Game of Golf is to your golfing success. Add in \"Self-Talk\" as another factor! The critical points taught in the Inner Game of golf training at Neuro Golf Academy make a major difference whether your efforts will either hinder or payoff for your ball striking and fun playing golf. These major influences on your golf game outcomes are directly correlated to the kinds of storytelling you share with yourself about your personal golf results. The idea of what we believe shapes our ability to succeed, and creates our own golfing reality. The stories we create and believe in are very powerful and even motivating. Most important are the typologies of self-stories you foster in your mind. Two types of stories 1. Advantageous stories (positive helps your memory) 2. Negative stories (hurts your game) That is why Dr. Dunkley requires you write down great golf shots you make when they occur during play. The best golfers remember those hits, and believe in their recollection and outcomes. One of my favorite personal stories is the 9th hole at Falling Waters, Pelican Lakes Golf Course an island hole like TPC Sawgrass the Players PGA Championship. Almost identical and my do I love that hole. The results have been amazing for me and I always love to play hole number 9! My friend has a desire never to hit the hole again as he recounts seeing his tee shot always falling into the water. If you cannot create such stories advantageous to your golf game you will not excel. Negative stories guarantee scores and those stories will hurt your game! These stories build a library of your shots adding an unforgettable set of successes. You create \"fluid confidence\" based on what you say to yourself in those stories. I hope you can begin to understand how the Inner Game of golf can come about, and how to best take care of it! It is the 6 inches between your ears. You cannot afford to fail in this area. If you are not learning these obscure hidden secret techniques you will always be behind!"
