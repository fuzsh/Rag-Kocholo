        "text": "IN golf, it's known as managing your game. It's making the correct decision on which club to hit and where to hit your ball as much as it is making the correct swing. Decisions, decisions.\n\nIt's what Payne Stewart did in winning the United States Open at Pinehurst No. 2, and what Jose Maria Olazabal did in winning the Masters at Augusta National. It's what the winner of the year's final major, the P.G.A. Championship, will need to do over 7,401 yards of decisions at Medinah No. 3 outside Chicago on Aug. 12-15.\n\nIt's also what Jean Van de Velde did not do during his triple-bogey 7 on the 72d hole of the British Open that enabled Paul Lawrie, a virtually unknown Scot who had finished two hours earlier with a four-under-par 67, to come out of the Carnoustie clubhouse and win a four-hole playoff.\n\nThe Frenchman didn't choke; he just didn't think. With a three-stroke lead in the final round's final twosome, Jean Van de Velde should have played the 487-yard par-4 cautiously: an iron off the tee, another iron short of the Barry Burn, a wedge onto the green, two putts or even three putts. He could have won with a double-bogey six.\n\nHe decided to win heroically, with a driver off the tee.\n\nThat was the Frenchman's first bad decision: his tee shot veered to the right into light rough. His second bad decision was going for the green with a 2-iron; his ball ricocheted off the grandstand and the top of the Barry Burn wall into high rough.\n\nHis third bad decision was trying to go for the green again instead of pitching to the fairway; his ball splashed into the Barry Burn. After a penalty stroke and a drop into shorter rough, his wedge shot plopped into a bunker in front of the green.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
