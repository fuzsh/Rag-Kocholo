        "text": "CARNOUSTIE, Scotland -- The most stunning collapse in golf gave way to the greatest comeback in the history of major championships.\n\nPaul Lawrie, 10 strokes behind when the final round began Sunday, became the first Scotsman to win the British Open in his native land in 68 years -- but only after a three-way playoff caused by Jean Van de Velde's triple bogey on the 72nd hole.\n\nLawrie won the four-hole playoff over Van de Velde and Justin Leonard, making birdies on the last two holes to win the claret jug before a delirious, shell-shocked gallery at Carnoustie Golf Links.\n\n''I thought no way,'' Lawrie said when asked if he ever imagined a playoff. ''Incredible.''\n\nThe biggest comeback in a major until Sunday was Jackie Burke Jr., who was eight strokes behind amateur Ken Venturi in the 1956 Masters.\n\nVan de Velde was no amateur. The 33-year-old Frenchman just played like one on the final hole when he tried to be a hero and lost a chance to be a champion. He bounced balls in the rough, off the grandstand, in the water of Barry's Burn and in the bunker.\n\nIt all added up to a 7 when all he needed was a 6.\n\n''Maybe next time I'll hit the wedge,'' he said. ''And maybe you will all forgive me.''\n\nVan de Velde made a gallant bid in the playoff, but Lawrie matched his birdie on the tough 17th hole and ended 90 minutes of unimaginable drama with an approach into 3 feet on No. 18. He became the first Scottish-born player to win an Open in Scotland since Tommy Armour at Carnoustie in 1931.\n\n''To birdie the last two holes in a playoff is such a fairy story,'' Lawrie said.\n\nAs for Van de Velde, he was the first player to lose a five-stroke lead in the final round of an Open since Jose Jurado, also in 1931.\n\nLeonard, who won the 1997 British Open at Royal Troon with a five-stroke comeback, almost matched that feat. But he made bogey from the watery burn on the 72nd hole for bogey, and again in the playoff.\n\nLawrie played the playoff holes -- Nos. 15-18 -- in par. He closed with a 4-under 67, tied for the best score of the tournament on the toughest links golf course in the world.\n\nThat put him at 290, the first time over-par has won an Open in 14 years. Leonard had a 72, while Van de Velt staggered home to a 77.\n\nNot since John Daly won the PGA Championship in 1991 had a player come out of nowhere to win a major championship. Lawrie has won twice on the European tour, including the Qatar Masters, but he was a mere 159th in the world rankings. Daly was 168th when he won at Crooked Stick.\n\n''Obviously, 10 shots back ... I didn't think I had a chance,'' Lawrie said. ''But you know, strange things happen, especially around here.''\n\nLawrie also became the first qualifier to win the Open since it started giving exemptions in 1963. Before that, everyone -- even Ben Hogan -- had to qualify.\n\nLawrie is an exception to the established champions Carnoustie has produced -- Armour, Henry Cotton, Hogan, Gary Player and Tom Watson.\n\nHolding the claret jug as darkness and rain fell around the 18th green, Lawrie, who grew up about an hour's drive from Carnoustie, thanked his wife and ''everyone who knows me -- which is a lot of you now.''\n\nEveryone is more likely to remember Van de Velde, a charming man who carelessly tossed away his chance for fame. The only Frenchman to win the British Open was Arnaud Massy in 1907.\n\n''There are worse things in life,'' Van de Velde said. ''Some terrible things are happening to other people. This is only a golf tournament. Yes, I blew it on 18. All it proves is I was capable of being three ahead of the best players in the world on 18.''\n\nVan de Velde gave the French a dubious piece of golf history. No one will ever forget who was behind the greatest collapse in the game, maybe in all of sports.\n\nGreg Norman blew a six-stroke lead to Nick Faldo in the 1996 Masters, but that took an afternoon at Augusta National to achieve. Van de Velde went from champ to chump in a matter of 15 minutes over one hole.\n\nThe only other finish this fatal was Sam Snead in the 1939 U.S. Open. He thought he needed birdie when all it took was a par to win at Philadelphia Country Club. Snead slashed his way to a triple bogey and wound up two strokes out of the playoff.\n\nNo, this was much worse. And it was so simple, even at cruel Carnoustie.\n\nJust hit the fairway. Pitch back into fairway. Anything.\n\nInstead, Van de Velde did just about everything, none of it right.\n\nHe hit driver off the tee and was lucky that it found land, albeit on a peninsula guarded by Barry's Burn. He would find that hazard before long.\n\nHis next shot hit the upper rail of the grand stand, bounced off the bricks bordering the burn and wound up in the rough. Van de Velde plowed through the long grass with a wedge and the horrified gallery, who had come to expect the worst, gasped when the ball sank into the bottom of the burn.\n\nAs if that wasn't enough, Van de Velde almost compounded his growing list of errors when he rolled up his pant legs, stepped into the chilly, shin-deep water fed by the Firth of Tay and contemplated playing a ball that was underwater.\n\nHe finally got wise, took a drop in the rough and hit in the bunker.\n\nCraig Parry, also in the bunker in a more conventional two shots, holed his shot and offered Van de Velde one last hope.\n\n''What about you following me into the hole?'' Parry said.\n\nFat chance. He blasted out to 8 feet, but summoned enough courage to make the putt and get into the playoff.\n\n''I could just see him throwing the tournament away,'' Parry said.\n\nVan de Velde knew it as well.\n\n''I went for it and all the glory,'' the Frenchman told him. ''Now, I have to pay the price.''\n\nHe paid it in a hurry, hitting his drive on the first playoff hole into a prickly gorse bush. He took a penalty drop on a path of crushed seashells, made double bogey and never caught up.\n\nFor a while, it looked like Leonard and Lawrie were also affected by their improbable playoff. Both missed the first two greens, both took bogey. Lawrie separated himself with a 12-foot birdie putt on the 17th.\n\nLeonard and Lawrie were both in the fairway on No. 18, but Leonard hit first and came up short into the burn for the second time Sunday. Lawrie hit to 3 feet and became perhaps the most undistinguished Open champion in its 139-year history.\n\n''I lost the British Open twice in one day, which is twice as hard to take,'' Leonard said.\n\nBut he knew the sympathy would not be for him.\n\n''As bad as I feel, he feels worse,'' Leonard said, referring to Van de Velde. ''That's tough to go through.''\n\nThe winning score must have been equally difficult for Tiger Woods. Ultimately, all he needed was a 1-under 70 to get into the playoff, not too much to ask on a relatively tranquil day at Carnoustie.\n\nWoods followed 11 straight pars with a double bogey. He finally ended his 35-hole birdie drought on the par-5 14th, but by then it was much too late. A bogey at the 18th gave him a 74 for 294, and a tie for seventh with Davis Love III (69) and David Frost (74).\n\nThen again, who could have imagined a finish like this?\n\n''I'm told he's getting the breaks,'' Woods said after his round, when Van de Velde had a three-stroke lead. ''The golfing gods are looking on him.''\n\nAngel Cabrera (70) and Parry (73) finished one stroke out of the playoff at 7-over 291. Parry actually led the championship with seven holes to play until he made a triple bogey from the rough on No. 12, which enabled Van de Velde to regain the lead.\n\nGreg Norman had a 72 and finished sixth, giving him 15 top 10s in the majors this decade -- but only one title to show for it.\n\nU.S. Open champion Payne Stewart and David Duval were among the 44 players who failed to break 300, the score that some thought might be a winner at the beginning of the week.\n\nLost in the hysteria of the final hole was a brilliant putting display by the 33-year-old Frenchman. Asked on the eve of the final round whether his putter was unusual, Van de Velde replied, ''Yes. Because they go in.''\n\nDid they ever.\n\nHis 8-foot par putt on the 72nd hole to get into the playoff gave him only 101 putts for the tournament, a remarkable performance that was wasted on the craziest 72nd hole ever played."
