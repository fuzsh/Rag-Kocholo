The former world number one has 23 European Tour triumphs, most recently at the 2014 Malaysian Open. Has three major runner-up efforts, including this year's Masters and the 2010 Masters and British Open, and six more thirds, without a major crown in 75 career major starts.\n\nDanny Willett (ENG) (World Ranking 10):\n\nThe 28-year-old Englishman makes his first Ryder Cup appearance after capturing his first major crown at the Masters, aided by a back-nine collapse from leader Jordan Spieth.
