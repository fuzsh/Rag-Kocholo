I have always been hard working and I understand that the best results in both my golf and academic careers will be achieved through dedication to practise and studying. I am also a very sociable person and therefore enjoy the opportunity golf gives to meet new people.\n\nWhat age did you start playing golf and why?\n\nI began playing aged 8 along with my Dad and enjoyed being with my friends as part of a thriving junior group at my local club.\n\nHow would you say you have developed as a golfer over the past few years?\n\nI feel that my game has improved significantly in the last 12 months as I have solely focussed on golf rather than splitting my time across other sports. In the last year I have also benefited from dedicated professional coaching, which I have found has helped to improve my game hugely.\n\nWho is your favourite golfer and why?\n\nRory Mcilroy. Even though he is obviously naturally very talented, he has also dedicated himself to the fitness and technical elements of the game. This ensures that he is able to reach his full potential and even after achieving so much, he continues to look to improve.\n\nWhat do you intend to study and why?\n\nI am particularly interested in economics and business as these are the subjects I have enjoyed most during school and feel will be of the most relevance to me as I try to progress my career.\n\nOther than golf what else do you enjoy doing and why?\n\nI am interested in all sports but in particular football and enjoy spending time in the gym working to improve my strength and fitness. I also enjoy listening to music and spending time with my friends."
