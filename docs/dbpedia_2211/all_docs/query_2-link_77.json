        "text": "Whiskey: Loch Lomond 1999 Paul Lawrie Autograph Edition Single Malt Scotch\n\nThis limited edition Highland single malt from 'The Spirit of the Open' celebrates the Open Championship and the 1999 Open winner, Paul Lawrie. Distilled in the year Lawrie took the famous Claret Jug trophy, this cask strength expression from Loch Lomond is bottled at 50.8% abv.\n\nOrder from the Largest & Most Trusted Premium Spirits Marketplace!\n\nFeatured in\n\n• ROLLING STONE\n\n• MEN'S JOURNAL\n\n• US WEEKLY\n\nNOTICE: Many other small liquor store sites will end up cancelling your order due to the high demand, unavailability or inaccurate inventory counts. We have the ability to source from a large network of licensed retailers to insure in most cases your order is fulfilled.\n\nSize: 700ML\n\nProof: 101.6 (50.8% ABV)\n\nOrigin: Scotland\n\nDistillery: Loch Lomond Distillery\n\nDetailed Description\n\nOne of three bottlings from Loch Lomond released in celebration of its partnership with The Open Championship. This particular expression was developed by master blender Michael Henry with Paul Lawrie, winner of the The Open Championship in 1999 and Loch Lomond ambassador. The whiskies used for this expression were filled in the same year that Lawrie won The Open Championship.\n\nLoch Lomond 1999 Paul Lawrie Autograph Edition Single Malt Scotch Whisky Tasting Notes\n\nNose: Apricot, peppercorn, a whiff of cloudy lemonade, shortly before waves of sandalwood and cigar box.\n\nPalate: Caramelised sultanas, honeycomb, roasted cacao nibs, clove.\n\nFinish: Packed full of vanilla and plum.\n\nDistillery Information\n\nLoch Lomond Distillery was commissioned by the Littlemill Distilling Company in 1964 with first distillation in 1966. In 1984, the distillery closed - or fell silent, to use the traditional term. Happily though, Alexander Bulloch and the Glen Catrine company acquired the business and resumed malt production in 1987. Grain whisky production began in 1993 and two new malt stills were added in 1999."
