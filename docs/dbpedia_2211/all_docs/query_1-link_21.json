        "text": "The Magical Art of Moonshining: A Blend of Tradition and Modernity Moonshining has a history often accompanied by tales of operations and spirited rebellion. In the past, it referred to alcohol production during the Prohibition era in the United States from 1920 to 1933. It is estimated that during that time, there were as 100,000 hidden illegal stills in operation, with many concealed in the Appalachian Mountains. Moonshining is often associated with using hidden stills and clandestine operations during the Prohibition era in the United States (1920-1933). This secretive practice became a symbol of rebellion during that time. Historical records suggest that at the peak of Prohibition, between 30,000 to 100,000 speakeasies were in operation, alongside moonshiners who supplied their illicit concoctions. Now, almost a century later, moonshining has transformed intriguingly. The rebellious spirit has found a home in craft distilleries, which experienced an astonishing growth rate of 23.7% in 2019 alone. These contemporary artisans are recreating the enchantment of moonshine while offering enthusiasts a taste of history with a twist. Why is this resurgence happening? It's not solely driven by nostalgia. Today, moonshine embodies the principles of the craft spirit movement: authenticity, tradition and a personal touch. The unwavering dedication and passion in producing each batch can be felt with every sip. This revival strikes a chord for those residing in Ireland—a country known for its distilling heritage. Imagine adding a twist to this age craft. Out of curiosity, Have any of you had the opportunity to try modern moonshine? Would you be intrigued by an Irish-inspired version combining the traditions of two distilling cultures? Please share your thoughts!!! #MoonshineMagic #DistillingHistory #CraftSpiritsRevival #ProhibitionEra #CraftDistilleries #SipOfTradition #LiquorLegacy #FromRebellionToRevival #TasteOfThePast #SpiritualJourney #IrishDistilling #MoonshineModernTwist #AuthenticSips #SpiritInnovation #LiquorLore\n\nI have recently seen a question \"Is the winemaker part of the terroir?\" My answer has been: \"No. It's not the winemaker him/herself as a single person. It's the human factor and the state-of-the-art generated by the generations, in the sense of past-present-future, that make sure that \"terroir\" is a collective and public expression of an area. Geographical Indications, as intellectual property rights of public interest, are not designed for a single actor, but as the effect of a group of actors and factors which contribute to the prestige and unicity of a product, together with the peculiar pedoclimatic conditions in which it is shaped\". #geographicalindications #intellectualproperty #humanfactor\n\nToday is National Moonshine Day! Now, if you are familiar with the historical context of moonshine you know that #NASCAR has its roots using racecars in the transporting (and outrunning) of moonshine from place to place. You may also note that racecar is a #palindrome, just like \"taco cat\" or \"go hang a salami! I'm a lasagna hog\"...I'll give you a moment to check that one... You are probably asking what does this have to do with architectural #doors, #frames and #hardware? The answer is absolutely nothing, these national days posts and facts have precisely zero to do with the design and implementation of the products and services that LEEDING Architectural has to offer. So why do I bring them up at all!? I do it to show you that every industry and genre of work has its own minutia and nonsense that somebody, somewhere knows or has the answer too! For doors, frames and hardware that person, or group of people rather, is myself and the rest of the team at LEEDING Architectural. We know all the nonsense and details so that you don't have too!

Blending drinks seems more of a western beverage concept, and I worried that the traditional virtues of sake might be overlooked in favour of the latest smart blend. But last year I was lucky enough to witness Dirk van der Niepoort work magic with François Chartier's selection of beautiful sakes. It was a highly thought-provoking experience, and ultimately it convinced me that blended sake has its own (very special) place. You would probably agree that a person who can blend a fine drink must have the mind and palate of a world-class chef. And yet, food is somehow easier: the ingredients have straightforward flavours, and are fresh, or preserved in a particular condition. Drinks such as sake, wine or whisky are complex, however, and are constantly evolving and changing. As I watched Dirk working through the samples, I realised that blending a drink is a much more imaginative process: not so much an art as a feat of intuition. Most importantly, the blend that Dirk created was clearly different from the original sakes, and it was delicious. I still love sake as the toji brewed it, but I am no longer a blended sake sceptic! And this is the sake that convinced me! #niepoort #sake"
