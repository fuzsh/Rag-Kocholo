        "text": "When Ben Crenshaw awoke yesterday morning, the United States had still won the Ryder Cup. Crenshaw, however, should be excused if he pinched himself.\n\nSo many visions will linger from Sunday. Who will forget Crenshaw kissing the 17th green at The Country Club in celebration? Or the normally placid David Duval pumping his fist, holding his hand to his ear, urging the already delirious crowd to cheer louder? Or the 45-foot birdie putt at No. 17 by Justin Leonard, a putt that will be shown over and over into the next millennium?\n\nThe Ryder Cup brings out the best in golfers. It moves them to tears, unites them toward a common goal, and elevates their games to heights that create compelling theater. The United States pulled off the greatest comeback in Ryder Cup history, overcoming a 10-6 deficit to win by 14 1/2-13 1/2. A team that had been criticized for being disjointed and underachieving rose to silence its critics with each roar from the crowd.\n\n''I was sick and tired of hearing everyone saying we weren't a team,'' Duval, who made some poignant comments during the Saturday night team meeting that helped galvanize the United States, said. ''I said: 'I think we're better. Let's go show it.' ''\n\nDuval and company did show it, and in a memorable way. Despite the inspired nature of the victory, two hard facts also led to Sunday's turnaround. The United States had the stronger and deeper team. And in the singles format, when every player was forced to stand alone, the Americans' edge in talent finally showed.\n\nSome of the matches that looked like mismatches on paper were also mismatches on the course. As expected, Davis Love 3d beat Jean Van de Velde, Phil Mickelson handled Jarmo Sandelin and Tiger Woods beat Andrew Coltart. Van de Velde, Sandelin and Coltart had been benched by the European captain, Mark James, until the singles, and it was easy to see why. James knew his team wasn't as deep as the United States' team all along, so he rode his top players and tried to build a lead big enough to last during Sunday's final round. It nearly worked.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
