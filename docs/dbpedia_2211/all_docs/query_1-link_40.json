        "text": "Shinnecock Hills lies in wait for the world’s greatest players as they descend upon eastern Long Island this week for the U.S. Open.\n\nThe course lies in wait like a finicky old lady, leaving all who’ll visit unsure of what kind of mood she’ll be in once they arrive and how often that mood will change while they’re there.\n\nFor those who have any question about what kind of test Shinnecock, hosting its fourth U.S. Open, will present this week should consider it’s history and what has occurred on its fabled windswept links.\n\nIn 1986 and 1995, the last two times the Open was at Shinnecock – considered by many of the world’s top golfers as one of the best courses in the world – the course had a huge part in humiliating two of the most storied players in the game’s history – Jack Nicklaus and Tiger Woods.\n\nComing off his 18th major championship at the Masters in 1986, Nicklaus actually lost a ball in the tall fescue grass in his second round, something he said he had happen to him only once in competition – the 1959 British Amateur.\n\n“It may be the only time I can remember Jack Nicklaus losing a ball,” Bob Tway recalled. “I remember on that 10th hole they had 1,000 people looking and couldn’t find the ball. It’s a tough place.”\n\nWoods, considered by most to be the one player who’ll overtake Nicklaus as the greatest player the game has ever seen, was knocked out of the ’95 Open championship after injuring a tendon in his left wrist after taking a hack at his ball in the fescue grass.\n\nWoods jammed the wrist trying to chop out on the third hole and had to withdraw on the sixth hole, the same day Nicklaus failed to make the cut after shooting an unheard-of 81.\n\n“It was the first time I remember playing greens that hard,” Woods recalled of Shinnecock in ’95. “In junior golf, they soak the greens. I had never played on greens that hard, where sand wedges were springing 30 to 40 feet before they even think about stopping. That was quite an experience and quite a change from the way I had always played golf.”\n\nShinnecock’s 16th hole also foiled the chances of Phil Mickelson in 1995, when he went 6-over par on the par 5 during the tournament week, gaffes that cost him victory that week.\n\n“I love the golf course, though,” Mickelson said despite his problems on the 16th. “It’s a great test, very tough, windy, hard greens. A friend of mine who’s a scratch player went out a couple days after that ’95 Open and couldn’t break 90, it was so tough.”\n\nNo course on the world can take credit for that kind of disruption to the game’s finest players.\n\nCorey Pavin, the 1995 Open champion at Shinnecock, survived the week to win his first major championship in even par for the week.\n\nRaymond Floyd, the 1986 Open champion at Shinnecock, won in 1-under par.\n\nDon’t expect the winning score at the 2004 Open at Shinnecock to be much better than either of those – particularly if the wind is up.\n\n“The one thing about this course is you’ve got to treat her like a lady,” said John Perry, a caddie at Shinnecock for the last 37 years and part Shinnecock Indian. “You’ve got to give her respect. Anyone can have a great round, but in four days it definitely will be a balance. There won’t be anyone just running away from the field.\n\n“The beauty of Shinnecock is you can play it in morning and turn around and play it in the afternoon and it’s a totally different course because of the wind changes,” Perry said. “I’m looking at no more than 2-under to win.\n\n“The man that wins the Open will be thinking man and he’ll putt well.”\n\nTee times to watch\n\nThursday: first hole; Friday: 10th hole\n\n8:00 a.m.-1 p.m. – Tiger Woods, Shigeki Maruyama, Chad Campbell.\n\n12:40 p.m.-7:40 a.m. – Padraig Harrington, David Toms, Stephen Leaney.\n\n1:10 p.m.-8:10 a.m. – Vijay Singh, Stewart Cink, Stephen Ames.\n\n1:30 p.m.-8:30 a.m. – Charles Howell III, Retief Goosen, Justin Leonard.\n\nThursday: 10th hole; Friday: first hole\n\n7:30 a.m.-12:30 p.m. – Peter Lonard, Davis Love III, Lee Westwood.\n\n7:40 a.m.-12:40 p.m. – Jonathan Byrd, Sergio Garcia, Rich Beem.\n\n8 a.m.-1 p.m. – Nicholas Flanagan, Ben Curtis, Jim Furyk.\n\n8:20 a.m.-1:20 p.m. – Robert Allenby, Chris Di Marco, Ernie Els.\n\n1 p.m.-8 a.m. – Phil Mickelson, Paul Lawrie, Kirk Triplett.\n\n1:40 p.m.-8:40 a.m. – Corey Pavin, Justin Rose, Scott Verplank.\n\nComplete tee times: Page 70"
