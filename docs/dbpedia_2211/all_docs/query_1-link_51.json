        "text": "England's Anthony Wall beat Alex Noren of Sweden to win his second European Tour title at the Paul Lawrie Match Play at Archerfield in Scotland on Sunday. Wall overcame a sluggish start and eventually secured a one-up win over favourite Noren, who missed out on a double following his victory in the Scottish Open at Castle Stuart last month. The Swede had quickly gone two up but Wall came back to level the contest at the long sixth. Wall then made birdie at the long 11th to go one up and he maintained his lead to win on the last when Noren missed a birdie effort from 15 feet that would have forced extra holes. The 41-year-old's only previous Tour title had come back in 2000 and the 431 events that have passed since then make his wait between titles the longest ever on the European Tour. \"It's funny –- the other one in 2000 felt like yesterday! It's amazing because it's such a hard job to beat everyone because everyone is so good,\" Wall, seven times a runner-up between victories, told europeantour.com. \"I did wonder whether it would ever come again. I'm just so pleased for my parents –- they put in so much when I was young. I've got two children that just want to see their dad win, I'm speechless, it's phenomenal.\" England's James Morrison won the third-place play-off 4 and 2 against compatriot Oliver Fisher after starting with a run of birdie, eagle, birdie to establish a lead he refused to relinquish."
