        "text": "Justin Rose and Paul Lawrie have reached their highest-ever positions on the world rankings after sharing second at Wentworth.\n\nBritish duo reach career-highs in world rankings\n\nJustin Rose and Paul Lawrie could not beat Luke Donald at Wentworth, but finishing joint runners-up has enabled both of them to match their highest-ever positions on the world rankings. While Donald replaced Rory McIlroy as number one again on the back of his four-shot triumph, Rose climbed from tenth to sixth and Lawrie from 40th to 29th. Among the players 43-year-old Lawrie has overtaken is Martin Laird, making him Scotland's top-ranked player for the first time in his career. In America, Jason Dufner just missed out on a third win in four starts, eventually being beaten by Zach Johnson at the Crowne Plaza Invitational. However, his runner-up finish was still good enough for him to enter the world's top 10 for the first time - he improves from 14th to eighth, while Johnson jumps from 27th to 17th. Latest leading positions in the world golf rankings: 1 Luke Donald 10.43pts, 2 Rory McIlroy 9.39, 3 Lee Westwood 8.05, 4 Bubba Watson 6.37, 5 Matt Kuchar 6.04, 6 Justin Rose 5.60, 7 Hunter Mahan 5.48, 8 Jason Dufner 5.30, 9 Tiger Woods 5.16, 10 Steve Stricker 5.07, 11 Martin Kaymer 5.06, 12 Phil Mickelson 5.03, 13 Webb Simpson 4.96, 14 Louis Oosthuizen 4.80, 15 Adam Scott 4.80, 16 Charl Schwartzel 4.78, 17 Zach Johnson 4.64, 18 Jason Day 4.61, 19 Rickie Fowler 4.59, 20 Dustin Johnson 4.56. Other leading Europeans: 21 Graeme McDowell, 23 Sergio Garcia, 25 Peter Hanson, 28 Ian Poulter, 29 Paul Lawrie, 32 Francesco Molinari, 33 Martin Laird, 34 Nicolas Colsaerts, 37 Thomas Bjorn, 38 Carl Pettersson, 42 Alvaro Quiros, 44 Simon Dyson, 45 Robert Karlsson, 46 Fredrik Jacobson, 51 Anders Hansen, 53 Rafael Cabrera Bello, 56 Gonzalo Fernandez-Castano, 58 Paul Casey, 59 Robert Rock, 60 Miguel Angel Jimenez, 61 Matteo Manassero, 73 Darren Clarke, 79 Pablo Larrazabal, 81 Alexander Noren, 83 Michael Hoey, 87 Joost Luiten, 89 Brian Davis, 92 Richie Ramsay, 94 Padraig Harrington, 96 Stephen Gallacher, 97 Bernd Wiesberger."
