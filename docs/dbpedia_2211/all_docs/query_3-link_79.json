        "text": "How many more NBA drafts will the cable networks be able to put on? This is a moral quandary over equitable employment practices, mental health and, frankly, racial optics. It’s not a fashion question. As fashion, the answer is probably “forever!” The broadcasts have added a procession that gives some pomp to the circumstance.\n\nA bunch of small children line the stage and slap the hands of the giant players as they enter from backstage; then, flanked by parents, siblings or, yes, agents, the draftees head down to their table on the arena floor. This has proved to be an ingenious development. It gives a television show — a long one — some actual show. And what’s being shown (shown off) are the clothes.\n\nYou used to have to do some work to find a shot that took in a whole outfit. The scarcity of those images wasn’t because the players were too tall. It was because the networks didn’t seem to care about who wore what. Nobody’s here for fashion! But some of us were. Now the reporters and anchors are even cheering and jeering each other’s clothes.\n\nAt ESPN, the anchor Rece Davis noted that “the players are dressed for success, some very subtle and classy, others, making a little bit more of a statement.” As he spoke, the camera and editing rolled its eyes, first, at Mfiondu Kabengele, the ultimately snazzy eventual 27th pick (to the Brooklyn Nets), who was flashing his embroidered jacket lining. Then they found Ja Morant (picked second, by the Memphis Grizzlies), who was in pinstriped purple everything. That seemed a reasonable doubt. Even at Morant’s comparatively ordinary height (he’s only 6 feet 3 inches), all that purple was delightfully excessive, like watching the Joker audition to join a pack of grape Now and Laters.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
