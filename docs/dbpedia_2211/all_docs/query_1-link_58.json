        "text": "What can Sunday‚Äôs V8 supercars race teach us about business ownership? üèÅüöó üëÄTLDR: You CAN finish the race and do a great job with your car (business) slapped together‚Ä¶ but it‚Äôs a hell of a lot harder to lead the pack & win the race. When race 12 started on Sunday in Darwin, everyone was in position‚Äîcars & drivers ready to go out and do their people proud. Early on in the race (literally lap 1) a crash resulted in a substantial amount of damage to car 888. The crash is beside the point, but the damage is what I wanted to focus in on! Although not my team of choice üòâ, it was great news that the damage was mostly external, so the pit crew STICKY TAPED the panels back together and sent the car back out to finish the race.. The car was capable, but my gosh it looked slapped-together. Murray remained an awesome capable driver, but his car was holding him back. In the end he finished the race & took out the last position. It reminded me of the trap we can fall into as business owners! While our service can be exceptional, the vehicle we deliver it in needs to be performing at its best too! So often we slap things together at the last minute, or do a half-arsed job to get something out into the world‚Ä¶ and overtime everything starts to look a bit modpodged together. These inconsistencies start to make us look sub-par, and stop us from winning. Improving the visuals of your business doesn‚Äôt have to mean throwing it all in the bin to start again‚Ä¶ but slapping things together as you need them without consistency might just be the thing holding your business back from leading the pack. What areas of your business are slapped together and slowing you down? How can I help?\n\nEmployee Spotlight: Julian Zambrano Julian is a full-time outfitter at Fleet Feet Oak Park and has been with us for the past year and a half. Learn more about Julian below: How long have you been running? I have been running since the beginning of 2021. I was looking for a new challenge and hopped straight into the deep end and decided to run the Chicago Marathon. It‚Äôs been an unreal journey so far, love every second of it. How long have you been working at Fleet Feet? I‚Äôve been at Fleet Feet for 1.5 years. I love the industry and work environment. I look forward to serving our customers every day and providing the highest level of service possible. Favorite race experience? My favorite race experience has to be running the Chicago Marathon in 2022. I was striving to break the 4 hour mark after being unsuccessful in doing so the year prior. I‚Äôm very goal-oriented and seeing the progress throughout training gives you a different energy that translates into all aspects of life. Having my family and friends in support and crossing the line with time to spare is an unexplainable feeling, one that keeps you striving for more. What's one item you can't leave for a run without? I can‚Äôt leave the house without my Garmin Watch. Having the ease of access to my mileage, time and training log allows me to optimize my training and help me progress towards my goals. What's your favorite part about working with our customers? I love being able to help our customers reach their goals and pursue an active and healthy lifestyle. Our customers look to us for our knowledge and expertise and I look forward to upholding the standards we set. #RunningChangesEverything #RunChi\n\nI started building my Pit Crew... Being inspired by the F1 series \"Drive to Survive\", I started to look at my business from a different perspective. Let me explain. We see Lewis Hamilton and Max Verstappen; and we give them all the glory when we see them past the finish line (which is well deserved of course). But, if Drive to Survive has shown us anything, it's the hard work and dedication that goes on behind the scenes to allow them to pass the finish line. It's the engineers working on the cars, the tech crew and the pit crew that work together to make the race successful. You could even say, it's also the fans in the stands cheering them on and celebrating even when they don't make podium; they still bring that positive energy. As a small female owned and operated business, that has a staff of one (just me!) I started to question how much growth I could experience if I had a Pit Crew. I'd done everything independently my entire life; that it almost felt foreign to start thinking like this. When it comes to my product based business (BORN Naturals), I came to realize that I'd graduated to the point where in order for me to further succeed I in fact needed a Pit Crew. It took analyzing what each member of my pit crew would do, and who would be qualified to do that job. I found some outstanding individuals that bring something to the table (or pit in my analogy) that either I cannot do myself, can do way better than myself, or can save me time doing so I can focus on other areas of my business. It's funny how we find inspiration and perspective from places we never intended! Here's to building Pit Crew's one person at a time.\n\nCoaching Light Bulb Moments: A Formula One race car has to take pitstops in order to WIN. That car is always at its best when it‚Äôs pulling OUT OF THE PIT. The car is refueled... The car has new tires for better traction and direction... Most importantly the driver is hydrated and had the opportunity to briefly rest. (Driving a race car can be physically taxing and strenuous.) When was your last pit stop? Are you taking your PTO? Most of the executives I coach come to me with an opportunity to take much MORE...Personal, Time away, and Off the clock! . . . #executivecoach #insights4lifecoaching #leadershipdevelopement #bebetter\n\nIn the high-octane world of Formula 1, where drivers are often celebrated for their speed and precision, there's a team behind the scenes that is just as crucial to crossing the finish line ‚Äì the pit crew. These highly skilled professionals work in perfect harmony, executing pit stops in mere seconds. They change tires, refuel, and make critical adjustments to the car, all under immense pressure. Their efficiency can make the difference between winning and losing a race. Each member of the pit crew has a specific role, from the tire changers to the jack operators, and each one is a master of their craft. Their dedication and relentless practice sessions ensure that when the moment comes, they perform flawlessly. #Formula1 #Teamwork"
