        "text": "IHOP announced it’s bringing back its All-You-Can-Eat Pancakes deal and it lasts all summer. IHOP said it specifically wanted to offer the deal now through September 15 to align with back-to-school time to “help families when schedules are tight, and wallets are pinched from shopping.”\n\nNational Restaurant News reported on the deal. Kieran Donahue, the chief marketing officer at IHOP, recently shared in an interview that “Going out to eat has gotten really expensive. We always talk to franchisees about their four-wall profit, but our guest is looking at their own four-wall profit, and they’re asking if they should cook at home. Generally, people have started putting on the brakes because they realized their dollar wasn’t going as far as they wanted it to.”\n\nHow to score the all-you-can-eat-pancake deal?\n\nTo get in on the deal, just order one of IHOP’s popular Breakfast Combos like the Country Fried Egg and Steak or the Smokehouse Combo, and you’ll enjoy an unlimited supply of Buttermilk Pancakes. It’s worth noting that they’ll serve them two at a time.\n\nFor those who love their pancakes plain and simple, you can start your unlimited feast with a Full Stack of five Buttermilk Pancakes for $5, followed by a Short Stack (2 pancakes) with each additional order.\n\nWhen the restaurant chain announced on social media, people flooded the comments with excitement. “As a pancake lover I love this post [heart emoji],” one person wrote. “Pancakes sound good right now, I’m on my way,” someone else wrote.\n\nIn 2023, Kevin Bacon teamed up with the pancake house to offer the same deal which was unlimited buttermilk pancakes for $5. At the time it was in honor of Bacon and IHOP turning 65. Apparently, the actor’s birthday is on July 8, and IHOP opened its first restaurant on July 8, 1958.\n\n“When I saw that IHOP was doing $5 all-you-can-eat pancakes to celebrate 65 years, I knew right away it was because I turned 65, and I’m touched,” Bacon joked in a TikTok, while holding up a small trophy that read “Happy 65th Kevin Bacon!!”\n\nIHOP also has something else in store. In July, they announced a partnership with Kraft Heinz to bring pancake-inspired IHOP syrups to retail stores in two flavors: Original and Butter Pecan.\n\n“Pancakes and syrup are what we do best, and expanding our partnership with Kraft Heinz to develop IHOP syrups for retail was simply a no-brainer,” Candice Jacobson, the executive director of brand communications at IHOP, shared.\n\n“Our purpose at IHOP is to serve more joy to more guests every day, and offering syrup at retail allows even more guests to experience that joy at home in addition to in our restaurants.”\n\nKayla is the midday host on Detroit’s 105.1 The Bounce.
