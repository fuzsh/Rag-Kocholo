        "text": "Synopsis\n\nJeev Milkha Singh, who has more experience of the format, will meet Scott Hend, who divides his time between Asian and European Tours.\n\nABERDEEN: Shiv Kapur goes up against local man Richie Ramsay in the opening round of the Saltire Energy Paul Lawrie Matchplay at the Murcar Links Golf Club here tomorrow.\n\nKapur, who has been slowly coming back to form, finished in a tie for 24th at the Omega European Masters last week.\n\nJeev Milkha Singh, who has more experience of the Matchplay format, will meet Australian Scott Hend, who divides his time between Asian and European Tours.\n\nA total of 64 players will feature in the 32 first round matches at the Murcar Golf Links.\n\nTournament host Paul Lawrie will face the young Frenchman Romain Wattel. Whilst this is Wattel's first professional match play event, Lawrie has the experience of two winning Ryder Cup appearances in 1999 and 2012.\n\nLawrie will no doubt be the local favourite in his hometown but Wattel has some fond memories of golf in Scotland, having won the 2010 Scottish Open Amateur Stroke Play Championship at Glasgow Golf Club.\n\nIn another match, Peter Uihlein meets Oliver Wilson. Wilson famously won the 2014 Dunhill Links Championship, his first victory in 228 starts on The European Tour, whilst Uihlein came with a hair of a memorable 59 at Kingbarns at the same event a year before.\n\nPaul Lawrie is a two-time Ryder Cup player and Scotland's most recent Major Champion, having won the 1999 Open. The new Matchplay event will be part of The Race to Dubai for the next three years. It carries a prize fund of 1 million Euros.\n\nLawrie's most famous moment came when he rallied from ten shots back to win The 1999 Open Championship at Carnoustie, Lawrie has always held a strong affinity for match play, having represented Europe twice in The Ryder Cup.\n\n(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\n\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n\n...moreless\n\n(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\n\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n\n...moreless\n\nIndiGo’s ‘stretch’ from no-frills to business class has a DNA test coming\n\nWhy Nvidia’s stock fall reminds us of Amazon during the dotcom mania\n\nSix reasons why Iran is becoming the epicenter of global conflict.
