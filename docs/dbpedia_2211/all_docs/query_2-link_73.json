        "text": "South Ayrshire Council has announced a link-up with a former Open champion who will help spearhead plans to improve the playing experience at Darley and Belleisle golf courses.\n\nIn what is seen as a major coup, the local authority has appointed Pangaea Golf Architecture, in association with 1999 Open golf champion Paul Lawrie, to develop initial design concepts for both courses.\n\nDetailed site analysis has already begun, which will include topographical and ecological surveys, and initial design concepts will be available in the summer.\n\nPangaea Golf Architecture is a leading golf consultancy practice with 20 years’ of experience in the industry.\n\nLawrie, a world-renowned professional golfer and previous winner of The Open and Ryder Cup, will have an input into the re-designs for both courses.\n\nOnce the initial design concepts are pulled together, they will be shared via a consultation to allow the public to have their say on the future of the courses.\n\nCouncillor Brian Connolly, South Ayrshire Council’s Portfolio Holder for Sport and Leisure, said: “I’m delighted that plans are moving forward at Darley and Belleisle courses with the appointment of Pangaea Golf Architecture. This project highlights our commitment to enriching our golfing legacy. We really value our players' feedback, so I’d encourage everyone to have a look at the design concepts and take part in the consultation once it is open.\n\n“It’s also really exciting to have Paul Lawrie involved - his world-wide reputation as a Major winner and Ryder Cup player makes Mr Lawrie the ideal man to oversee this project. Add in his renowned reputation created by his Paul Lawrie Foundation and the Paul Lawrie Golf Centre, and we have the ideal person to help us establish our Golf Development Academy. We’re all looking forward to working with Paul and Pangaea.”\n\nCouncillor Alec Clark, South Ayrshire Council’s Portfolio Holder for Tourism, Culture and Rural Affairs, said: “This is fantastic news and demonstrates our commitment to making South Ayrshire a thriving destination for tourists and visitors.\n\n“We’re already known for our stunning scenery and this makes our golf courses extremely popular. I’m excited to see the initial design concepts for the courses, which I know will ensure they continue to attract golfers from South Ayrshire and beyond, for many years to come. With Pangaea’s and Paul’s combined expertise, we’re poised to elevate both courses to new heights.”\n\nRead next:\n\nAbandoned Ayr shopping centre described as scene from 'apocalypse'\n\nNew homes under construction on Kilmarnock estate in 'great location'\n\nCar dealer fumes after giant pothole wrecks tyre - and council refuse to pay up for damage\n\nMad Cow Disease outbreak confirmed on Ayrshire farm as community on alert\n\nBrig o' Doon House Hotel gears up to re-open after stunning makeover"
