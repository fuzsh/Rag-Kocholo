        "text": "Power Tee is exhibiting at the 2019 British Golf Show and Elite London event, 17th – 18th May, Wycombe Air Park, Buckinghamshire. Because Power Tee is used in 3 different golfing environments, Driving Ranges, Country Clubs and Home Use installations, so we will be exhibiting in the three key locations at the shows, 17th – 18th May, Wycombe Air Park, Buckinghamshire. explains Matt Foley of Power Tee.\n\nPower Tees are currently installed in many homes, Country Clubs and Driving Ranges, and featured in over 85% of the top Driving Ranges in the U.K. including four Ryder Cup venues and the Home of Golf, St. Andrews. We are also installed in 18 countries worldwide, which includes America, Europe, Japan and the Middle East, teeing up more than 6 million balls each day.\n\nPower Tee are proud to be endorsed by US Open Champion and 2018 USA Ryder Cup Captain, Jim Furyk, 2018 European Ryder Cup Captain Thomas Bjorn, 1999 Open Champion Paul Lawrie and Mitchell Spearman, elite golf instructor to many PGA professionals.\n\nFeatures\n\nPower Tee has up to 40 adjustable tee heights (4 standard). To adjust the height you simply touch the lower button on the control panel. The adjustable tee means there is always the perfect tee height for every club in the bag.\n\nThe Power Tee mats are custom made for our system and regarded as the 2 best surfaces to hit from in the world. There is no club jarring and they give instant feedback from every strike. The Power Tee automation delivers the ball seamlessly to each customer without the customer needing to move, improving consistency, and strike and enabling the person to get better and golf quicker and easier.\n\nDriving Range Benefits\n\nInstalling Power Tee at your driving range will increase your revenues by at least 25% to 40%. How can Power Tee do this?\n\nPower Tee enhances a range’s appeal and facilitates a huge demographic growth in ladies, juniors, seniors, beginners and reduced mobility golfers. Power Tee represents a huge competitive advantage over neighbouring ranges and deters competition in an area by raising the barriers to entry.\n\nPower Tee makes hitting balls easier, quicker, more rewarding and more fun. These effects combine in different ways to inspire the golfer, buy more golf balls and stay longer when they visit the range\n\nCountry Clubs\n\nPerfect practice makes perfect, and a Power Tee practice will improve your golfer’s game and enjoyment of their round of golf. Your members deserve the best, so give them the same Power Tees as used in some of the most prestigious Country Clubs worldwide – St. Andrews, Oasis, Wentworth, Le Golf National, and many others.\n\nThe Country Club model gives all of the same golfer benefits as our Driving Range system. We customise each install to aesthetically fit in with your facility. Our Country Clubs have been able to add an itemised charge to the membership for Power Tee, making the club profit and enhancing their customer’s experience.\n\nHome Use\n\nWith many home installations in the UK, Europe and America, the PowerTee Home Use system brings the best game improvement station directly to your home. Perfect your swing, impress your friends and work on your game more often. Join the list of celebrities and golf enthusiast with the Ultimate Practice Aid in their back garden or simulator room.\n\nCome and see us at The British Golf Show, Booth C20, The Elite London, Hall A, Booth A44 and hit from Power Tee at the Outdoor Driving Range area.
