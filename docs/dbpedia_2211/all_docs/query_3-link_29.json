        "text": "There were audible groans when the British Formula One driver was wrongly pulled into the pits by his Mercedes team, handing team-mate Nico Rosberg the win.\n\nA late safety car following Max Verstappen's crash allowed Rosberg and Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel to pass Hamilton before he rejoined the race, where he couldn't get back on top.\n\n\"We've lost this, haven't we?\" Hamilton said to the team. \"I'm sorry about that, Lewis,\" his engineer Peter Bonnington told him over the radio. \"I'll have a word with the pit wall.\"\n\nSo that was the most latest of gaffes, but what others are they? Craig Birch takes a closer look. Can you think of any more? Join the debate and leave your comments below.\n\n1, Not that club! It all goes Pete Tong for Jean van de Velde at the 1999 Open Championship.\n\nThe French golfer was on course for an upset victory in Carnoustie when he was the clear leader playing the closing holes, only for him to spectacularly fluff his lines.\n\nHe only needed a double bogey six at the 18th tee, but using his driver proved disastrous. His first ball was lucky to find land, while his second landed on top of the Barry Burn's stone wall rather than the desired target of the green.\n\nHis third attempt got tangled in the rough on his down-swing and flew into the Barry Burn.\n\nHe removed his shoes and socks and gingerly stepped through shin-deep water as he debated whether to try to hit his ball out of the Barry Burn, which guards the 18th green. He eventually made a seven and lost a three-way play-off to Paul Lawrie.\n\n2, Mike Tyson's bite is far worse than his bark.\n\nThe boxing world was left outraged and Evander Holyfield was left with part of his ear missing when American boxer Mike Tyson completely lost the plot in their 1997 rematch.\n\n'The Baddest Man on the Planet' proved true to his moniker as he bit 'the Real Deal' as they got in close, literally ripping a chunk of Holyfield's right ear off with his teeth.\n\nThe missing body part was found on the ring floor after the fight, which was ruled a third round disqualification amid scenes of a near riot at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas.\n\nHolyfield later told me: \"I understood it for what it really was, a cover up to disguise his reason and intention for doing what he did. He realised he wasn't going to win the fight.\n\n\"It started going bad for him, he knew I was going to beat him again and he didn't want that, so he thought he would do something to get disqualified.\n\n\"If a kid bits you on the hand, it's because they want to you to let them go, you do things like that when you want to get out of there.\n\n\"He quit without being confronted by quitting, it was a good scheme and I guess it worked.\"\n\n3, A fall comes well before pride for Lindsey Jacobellis.\n\nAmerican snowboarder Lindsey Jacobellis knows as well as anyone what can happen when you get a split decision wrong, as her tumble at the 2006 Winter Olympics proved.\n\nShe held a three-second lead over Tanja Frieden on the second to last jump when she attempted a method grab, only to land on the edge of the board and then fall off completely.\n\nIt sunk in down the line that unnecessary show-boating cost her top honours, which went to Switerzland's Frieden as she passed leaving Jacobellis defeated right at the very death.\n\nFalling off is a common occurrence in the sport and it would happen again to Jacobellis at the 2007 Winter X Games and the Olympics of 2010 and 2014, so she's been in the wars.\n\n4, From claret and blue to red faced for Aston Villa goalkeeper Peter Enckelman.\n\nThe Finland shot-stopper picked the worst possible moment to blunder when a routine defensive throw-in from Olof Mellberg coasted along to the Villa goal in the derby at Birmingham City.\n\nRather than put his foot through the ball, Enckelman took his eye off it and then could only watch in horror as it slid under his foot and rolled into the net, in the goalkeeping howler of all howlers.\n\nThere is some debate over whether the goal should have stood, as the rules state that a goal cannot be scored directly from a throw-in.\n\nBut there was no sparing Enckelman's blushes, particularly from the rival fan who charged onto the pitch and made an offensive gesture directly to his face. He was later arrested and jailed, with the Villa player praised for his \"refusal to retaliate.\"\n\n5, From hero to zero for David Beckham.\n\nManchester United star David Beckham was supposed to be England's saviour at the 1998 World Cup in France, but he ended up becoming public enemy No 1 after getting himself sent off.\n\nHe had scored his first goal for the Three Lions in the previous game against Colombia, but his contribution was not quite so helpful when Argentina came calling in the competition's last 16.\n\nHe'd just been clattered by Diego Simeone when he petulantly lashed out with a kick as he laid on the floor, striking the still-standing Argentinan on the calf. There was only one outcome.\n\nReferee Kim Milton Nielsen was stood right in front of the incident and did not hesitate to brandish a red card, after which Beckham trudged off like he wanted the ground to open up and swallow him.\n\nThe press, of course, had a field day. One national title even printed a dartboard with a picture of him centred on the bullseye. An effigy was hung outside a London pub, while Beckham received death threats."
