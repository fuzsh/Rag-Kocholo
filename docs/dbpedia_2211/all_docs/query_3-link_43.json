        "text": "To get you up to speed, here is the latest from Chicago and what unfolded over the first two days:\n\nAs it happened: Ryder Cup 2012, day 1\n\nAs it happened: Ryder Cup 2012, day 2\n\nAmericans in sight of Ryder Cup triumph\n\nHigh praise: Olazabal compares Poulter to Seve\n\nRemember Brookline? Team Europe eyes historic comeback\n\nPairing for Sunday Singles (GMT):\n\n5:03 pm – Bubba Watson (USA) v Luke Donald (Europe)\n\n5:14 pm – Webb Simpson (USA) v Ian Poulter (Europe)\n\n5:25 pm – Keegan Bradley (USA) Rory McIlroy (Europe)\n\n5:36 pm – Phil Mickelson (USA) v Justin Rose (Europe)\n\n5:47 pm – Brandt Snedeker (USA) v Paul Lawrie (Europe)\n\n5:58 pm – Dustin Johnson (USA v Nicolas Colsaerts (Europe)\n\n6:09 pm – Zach Johnson (USA) Graeme McDowell (Europe)\n\n6:20 pm – Jim Furyk (USA) v Sergio Garcia (Europe)\n\n6:31 pm – Jason Dufner (USA) v Peter Hanson (Europe)\n\n6:41 pm – Matt Kuchar (USA) v Lee Westwood (Europe)\n\n6:53 pm – Steve Stricker (USA) v Martin Kaymer (Europe)\n\n7:04 pm – Tiger Woods (USA) v Francesco Molinari (Europe)\n\nSimpson’s approach to two is a belter and I can not see him missing that 10-footer. Poulter is par hope at best.\n\nRory is off to a slow start as he makes a poor connection with his iron. Bradley on the green but a fair distance (35-ft) back. Donald just shy of another birdie on three and Watson has an immediate chance to level matters. 12-foot tester and he hares it past the hole.\n\nBubba Watson 1 Down Luke Donald thru 3\n\nMcIlroy almost replicates the super Poulter pitch-in but it is a ball rotation away from dropping. Bradley like his putt but it fades on him.\n\nJustin Rose up against Phil Mickelson. The Englishman beat Lefty 3&2 in 2008. Solid drive lands smack-bang in the centre of the fairway. Mickelson, who is another three-for-three competitor out there, matches it.\n\nSimpson misses a 10-foot putt. A rarity. Poulter misses his par putt to go 1 Down.\n\nBradley Keegan A/S Rory McIlroy thru 1\n\nWebb Simpson 1 Up Ian Poulter thru 2\n\nMcIlroy gets par on the second. Bradley matches him. Donald birdies 4 and goes 2 Up on Watson. Nice start here.\n\nRose birdies one with a fantastic put and leads Mickelson.\n\nMickelson 1 Down Rose thru 1\n\nSimpson with a very assured chip from the bunker in a difficult position. Poulter’s putt is so close but a rotation away. McIlroy not done yet as he was going for birdie, not par. He gets his par.\n\nKeegan Bradley 2 Down Rory McIlroy thru 16\n\nDufner duffs another putt and Hanson is now only 2 Down. Furyk is 1 Up on Garcia again. Lawrie’s super chip looks likely to win his match on 15.\n\nDavid Elkin from Toronto, a man who has kept us updated on ESPN and the bombastic antics from the American commentators, says this:\n\nSpeechless here. What an afternoon of golf from the Europeans. The 17th hole, for me, summed up the whole day and the eventual destination of the Cup. Furyk missed against Sergio there, Rose rolled a monster in against Phil Mickleson and then Strickers miss against Kaymer.\n\nWhat an odd week. Momentum-wise I’ve never seen the likes before. And on US soil as well. So many of the out of form Europeans found soething today. Westwood and Kaymer especially. What more can be said? My favourite moment of the week was Mickleson’s reactions to Rose’s three clutch putts on the 16th, 17th and 18th. Such a great show of sportsmanship. Clapped them all in and ended it with a smile. It was Rose getting a full point that made me start to believe it was possible.\n\nTop performers of the week for me were Poulter, Keegan Bradley and Rose. The fact that McIlroy could take down Bradley was key – he was the heartbeat of the US team.\n\nEpic week. It’s been special.\n\nCheers to everybody for following the action, cheering Europe on, and commenting throughout. Ollie and his boys produced one of the most thrilling comebacks you are ever likely to see. Paul Lawrie, draped in a Scottish flag, extols on the virtues of Olazábal and says ‘I think Dad might be cool for the first time ever’. You certainly are mate. He bounced Brandt Snedeker 5&3 in one of the big shocks on a day of shocks."
