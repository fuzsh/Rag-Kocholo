        "text": "Tiger Woods has been held responsible for many things in his time but one of the more unexpected is to be blamed for the recent wins in major championships of the likes of David Toms, Mike Weir, Jim Furyk, Ben Curtis and Shaun Micheel.For that matter there was Paul Lawrie as well.\n\nBut there is a good deal of evidence to suggest that, while Woods has gone winless in his last six major championships, golfers not remotely in his class have been taking home the trophies simply because of measures designed to tame Tiger.\n\nWoods finished tied for 39th in the US PGA Championship that finished here on Sunday. It was his worst finish in a major championship as a professional. The Rodman Wanamaker Cup was won by Micheel, a man ranked 169th in the world who openly admitted that, when he arrived in Rochester, just making the cut would have constituted a good week.\n\nFunnily enough, the same sentiments were expressed by the winner of the Open Championship, Ben Curtis, when he arrived in Sandwich, ranked, at the time, 396th in the world. But then Curtis had no right to expect anything else, given that he was about to play in his first major championship as a professional. It would have been improper of him to think anything else.\n\nBut both men went on to win, Micheel defeating the strongest field of the year with 96 of the world's top 100 present. Curtis triumphed in conditions that were totally alien to him, although he tried hard not to. In the end, though, greatness was thrust upon him by the flailing efforts of Thomas Bjorn to escape a bunker at the 16th after he had been three ahead with four holes to play.\n\nThere is a common denominator here. Ever since Woods started winning majors at an unheard of rate - and by some obscene margins - the authorities have panicked. They blanched at the thought of him winning US Opens by 15 shots, as he did at Pebble Beach, or Opens by eight shots, as he did at St Andrews, or Masters by 12 shots, as he did at Augusta.\n\nTheir reaction has been the same as the average club member who plays in a pro-am at his home club and sees the pro from down the road take 76. They swell with pride at the thought that they play on a really tough course and say: \"No one tears our place up\". But \"their place\" has, of course, been tricked up for the occasion, bearing little resemblance to its normal state.\n\nThat is precisely what is now happening at the highest levels in the game. Collective fright has been taken at the thought of Woods tearing the place up and the reaction has been: \"Not in our championship\". Augusta, a course designed to be played with skilful placement and with no need for rough, now has rough and the courses for the other three championships - Olympia Fields, Royal St George's and Oak Hill - all had one thing in common: tall, thick, clinging, penal rough.\n\nThe US PGA people said before the championship that it was four inches tall, which caused Woods to laugh out loud in his pre-tournament press conference. \"Just show me where it's only four inches,\" he said. It was an offer that was not accepted and on Friday night the mowers were out to prevent matters from becoming absurd.\n\nAt the start of last week Mark Calcavecchia wondered whether there might be some broken wrists of players attempting to get out of it and at the end of the week Paul Casey let loose at what he regards as a simple lack of common sense.\n\n\"I have a hard time understanding,\" he said, \"why they want par to be the winning score.\" He added that playing a course where to miss the fairway by six inches was to be \"stuffed\" was \"boring\", that it was \"not enjoyable\" and that he obviously had to learn \"to plod\". And he is quite right.\n\nThe plodders have taken over. As Sergio Garcia said during the US Open last year: \"You have to keep hitting fairways because, if you don't, pretty soon you get to the level where you don't care.\" That was at Bethpage, in New York, where Nick Faldo called the rough \"mega-thick\" and where, because he rarely goes in it, he managed to finish fifth.\n\nBut that is precisely the problem. Faldo, for all his many achievements in golf, is a plodder and so are Micheel and Furyk and Weir, et al. And the authorities seem bent on insisting that the likes of Casey, a thrilling player with a driver in his hand, likewise plods down the fairway after a safe three-iron off the tee just to keep the ball findable.\n\nGolf is accused too often by people outside it of being boring and, like any other sport, there are times when it can be. But it never was when Jack Nicklaus had a driver in his hand and it never is when Tiger Woods has a driver in his.\n\nNow, though, the big cats are being muzzled. Woods is being tamed and plodders everywhere are rejoicing - and winning.\n\n2003 major winners\n\nThe Masters\n\nApril 13, Augusta Mike Weir ranked 10th\n\nUS Open\n\nJune 16, Olympia Fields Jim Furyk 10th\n\nThe Open\n\nJuly 20, Royal St George's Ben Curtis 396th"
