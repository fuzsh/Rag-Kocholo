        "text": "(via http://booktrib.com/)\n\nRizzoli Bookstore For over fifty years, Italy-based Rizzoli Bookstore has been widely considered one of the foremost independent booksellers in America specializing in illustrated books on architecture, interior design, fashion, photography, cookery, and the fine and applied arts, as well as literature, in English, Italian, French, and Spanish-language.\n\n(via http://www.primaonline.it/) Situated on Broadway just three blocks north of the bustling cultural heart of Madison Square Park, 5,000-square-foot new location of the Rizzoli Bookstore is on the ground floor of the historic St. James Building. (This time the store’s owners looked at 100 spaces before choosing this landmark—a real landmark, meaning nobody can tear it down.) The celebrated 16-story St. James Building, designed in 1896 by renowned architect Bruce Price, is a striking combination of stone, brick, terra cotta, iron, and copper in the Beaux-Arts style, with extensive detailing inside and out. The Rizzoli space boasts 35 feet of frontage on Broadway and sits next to what was the Havana Tobacco Company, designed by the illustrious firm McKim Mead & White.\n\nHistory of Rizzoli and the Rizzoli Bookstore Angelo Rizzoli founded his eponymous company in 1927, establishing a respected publishing house, a prominent film production company, and eventually merging with the preeminent Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera. Today, Rizzoli in America is an integral part of its parent company, RCS MediaGroup. In 1964, Mr. Rizzoli was inspired to open a new-world outpost at 712 Fifth Avenue in New York City to sell the beautiful illustrated books he published in Italy. It became the center of the company’s national expansion.\n\n(via http://media.vogue.com/)\n\nIn 1985, the Rizzoli bookstore moved to 31 West 57th Street, the former Sohmer Piano Company showroom, with interiors designed by Hugh Hardy of Hardy Holzman Pfeiffer. The store occupied three floors of a six-story townhouse exhibiting on its façade a sober classicism that belies the elegant interior within, where cast iron chandeliers, ornately decorated vaulting, and a luminous Diocletian window create a serene setting for book lovers amidst the rush of Midtown Manhattan.\n\n(via http://www.rizzoliusa.com/)\n\nOn April 11, 2014, Rizzoli was forced to close this flagship store, under the protest of customers and preservationists, after their lease had expired. (The building owners, the LeFrak real estate family and Vornado Realty Trust, planned to tear down the building and two adjoining buildings. Demolition started shortly after the bookstore closed. The New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission had refused to warrant landmark status for the building, noting that the interior design dated only to 1985 and that there was not enough original substance from the 1919 building left.)\n\nToday, Rizzoli reopened at its current 1133 Broadway and 26th Street location on July 27, 2015 in the heart of New York City’s thriving NoMad District alongside high-end retailers like Eataly, and Marimekko; restaurants including Eleven Madison Park, The Breslin and SD 26; and prevalent hotels like the Ace, NoMad, and the newly launched Edition Hotel.\n\nDesign Details Transformed over six months, the bookstore’s interiors were overseen by Thomas A. Kligerman of Ike Kligerman Barkley Architects and were inspired by the grandeur of the building and the neighborhood’s modernity. The layout is comprised of three primary rooms—the Nave, Skylight and The Salon—and embodies the vision of Rizzoli as a temple of ideas and a magnet for the creative minds thriving in urban New York.\n\nThe Nave, or central axis of the space, draws the eye through the length of the bookstore via a striking, black and white Belgian marble floor inspired by the Palio flags of Siena.\n\n(via http://blueberrybuilders.com/) The north wall of the Nave is comprised of three grand alcoves framed by gleaming black columns. Each alcove features original Rizzoli bookcases restored from the 57th Street location and iconic chandeliers that graced both the Fifth Avenue and 57th Street stores illuminate overhead. (The first alcove houses fiction, non-fiction, biography, history, and current bestsellers; the second is for cooking, entertaining, lifestyle; the third for art history monographs and museum exhibition catalogues.)\n\nInward-facing alcoves, along the south wall, are nine bays of literature, trade paperbacks, poetry, belles lettres, philosophy, criticism and a curated selection of stimulating and inspiring work by various authors.\n\nThe Nave leads to a release into the Skylight room, a perfect square crowned by a fine-grained pattern of glass block ceiling, which had been painted over during the World War II for blackouts. The slight upward pitch of the Skylight’s ceiling, framed by cross beams with hidden track lights, evokes an entirely different ambiance than the Nave and will house books on fashion, photography, and the performing arts, along with music CDs and classic film DVDs.\n\nA dramatic, 18-foot red mullioned door separates The Skylight room from The Salon—a striking room with four large piers, four soaring 12-foot tall windows and intimate window benches cleverly designed to allow one to get lost in the pages of a book under the light of four Crown Summa chandeliers designed by Jehs + Laub.\n\n(https://www.rizzolibookstore.com/) This space houses the heart of Rizzoli’s inventory selection—from architecture and design to new and classical Italian and French fiction. It also serves as the home of active, high-profile cultural and business programming events space.\n\nFornasetti Murals Fornasetti Milano designed custom-made wallpapers exclusively for the Rizzoli flagship, produced by Cole & Son, manufacturers of fine printed wallpapers since 1875. The trompe-l’oeil images were designed under the creative direction of Barnaba Fornasetti and tailored for each space:\n\nThe north wall in the Nave shows Italian cities floating in the clouds and the south wall shows figures from the Zodiac and skies.\n\n(https://www.rizzolibookstore.com/) The lovely lime wood Serliana arch, flanked by gilded scalloped bookcases with boiserie pilasters originally designed for the 1964 shop, was moved to the 57th Street store, and has been moved once again to the new store. The submerged Milan Duomo sits within it, while balloonists above the arch spirit visitors away to literary heights.\n\nBesides the Fornasetti wallpaper murals, for a limited time the design of Fornasetti can also be viewed in the window display. The surrealist arrangement features designer plates from Barney’s New York and stacks of books, showcasing a holiday shopping selection so perfect, that you can even find something for that friend who has everything.\n\nMadison Square Park麥迪遜廣場公園 The 6.2-acre Madison Square Park is bounded on the east by Madison Avenue (which starts at the park’s southeast corner at 23rd Street); on the south by 23rd Street; on the north by 26th Street; and on the west by Fifth Avenue and Broadway as they cross. This area has existed as an urban public space since 1686.\n\nNamed for James Madison (1751-1836), fourth President of the United States (1809-1917), Madison Square was formally opened as a public park in 1847.\n\nThe first decades after Madison Square Park was officially designed as a public space, it was mostly a residential area. From 1859 onwards, with the opening of the Fifth Avenue Hotel, the area started to become the center of New York’s social life. Many major hotels moved into the area, followed by retailers and the entertainment industry. Such was the concentration of shops that the section of Broadway between Union Square and Madison Square became known as the Ladies’ Mile. Most of the retailers have long moved up town, but many of the buildings in the area have been preserved. Soon after the creation of New York City’s first Department of Public Parks in 1870, the square was re-landscaped by William Grant with Ignatz Pilat. The park incorporated both formal and pastoral elements with well-defined walkways and open lawns similar to the park plan we know today. (http://www.madisonsquarepark.org/)\n\np.s. America’s first community Christmas tree was illuminated in Madison Square Park on Christmas Eve 1912.\n\nWilliam H. Seward Monument, dedicated on September 27, 1876, situated near the southeast border of the park by Randolph Rogers, was the first statue to be installed in the park. William H. Seward served as New York’s Governor and U.S. Senator before being appointed Secretary of State by Abraham Lincoln. He was also the first New Yorker to have a monument erected in his honor.\n\nSituated on a small concrete plaza between Fifth Avenue and Broadway, the 1867 obelisk—General Worth Monument by James Goodwin Batterson marks the grave of Major General William Jenkins Worth (1854-1857), a hero of the Mexican War.\n\np.s. In the picture above, One Madison Park background, with the Metlife Tower with its landmark marble clock In 1909, the Metlife Tower was constructed near Madison Square Park (at one Madison Avenue) as the new headquarters of the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company. It was added to the original 1893 headquarters. The 700ft (213 m), 51 stories tall building was modeled on the campanile at St. Mark’s Square in Venice. When constructed, it was the tallest building in the world. It would keep that title until the completion of the Woolworth Building in 1913. A more recent, but no less striking building at Madison Square is One Madison Park (at 22 East 23rd Street), originally known as The Saya. The 617ft (188m), 50 stories tall residential condominium tower was designed by Cetra Ruddy Architects. This modern glass tower, built in 2009, contrasts with the many historic buildings around it.\n\nFlatiron Building熨斗大廈—A Three-Sided Story\n\nBuilt in 1902 on the triangular plot bordered by Fifth Avenue, Broadway, 23rd and 22nd Streets, was intended to serve as offices for the George A. Fuller Company, a major Chicago contracting firm. Designed by Chicago architect Daniel Burnham the eccentric Fuller Building was the object of conflicting opinions regarding its solidity and the innovative steel skeleton with its contrasting neo-Renaissance style façade. Today, however, it is unanimously recognized as one of the great examples of the city’s early skyscraper architecture even if it doesn’t belong to any style to be found in the textbooks.\n\nPlans for Construction Though the Flatiron Building is often said to have gotten its famous name from its similarity to a certain household appliance, the triangular region contained by Broadway, Fifth Avenue, and 22nd and 23rd Streets had in fact been known as the “Flat Iron” prior to the building’s construction (even though the plot is a right triangle while a clothing iron is an isosceles triangle). The brothers Samuel and Mott Newhouse, who made their fortune in the mines of the West, bought the property in 1899. At the time, efforts were being made to create a new business district in New York, north of the current hub of Wall Street. In 1901, the Newhouses joined a syndicate led by Harry S. Black, head of the George A. Fuller Company, and filed plans to build a 22-story building on the triangular plot.\n\n(via http://www.sorgentegroup.com/)\n\nThe Flatiron Building, standing 307ft (86.87m) high with a total of 22 floors, it is sharp as a razor’s edge and looks north towards the wealthy and aristocratic districts of New York, leaving the bustling business district of Wall Street and the busy world port, behind it.\n\nUpon completion in 1902, it was one of the tallest buildings in the city and one of only two skyscrapers north of 14th Street—the other being the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company Tower, one block east.\n\nAn Enduring Icon Built around a skeleton of steel, the Flatiron Building is fronted with limestone and terra-cotta and designed in the Beaux-Arts style, featuring French and Italian Renaissance influences and other trends seen at the 1893 World’s Columbian Exposition in Chicago.\n\nDescribed in the “National Register of Historic Places\", as a veritable towering column, the entire conception is based upon the classical Greek column. First, the building is divided in three parts (base, shaft, and capital), the base in rusticated buff limestone with copper-clad windows, the main body of pale-colored bricks and terra-cotta with unusual and gracious undulating oriels, and the capital represented here by arches and columns topped by a heavy projected cornice and a flat balustraded roof. The overall effect is that of a palazzo stretched to great height. Here, for the first time, the construction of a steel-framed skyscraper (a newer construction technique allowing for thin, graceful walls and a quicker build using pre-cut frames) was witnessed in its entirety by the general public.\n\n(via http://www.architravel.com/) The Greek column character was enhanced by the rounded prow, creating the illusion of a freestanding colossal column.\n\n(via http://untappedcities.com/) Some folks tried to call the building “Cowcatcher”, due to its resemblance to the device on the front of locomotives, but that never caught on. In fact, the original design didn’t include this “Cowcatcher” retail space at the triangular front of the building. The space, at the time, was added to better use the building’s triangular lot and produce income to help defray construction costs.\n\n(via http://untappedcities.com/) Sprint has maintained a retail presence in its current spot since July 1997 and launched the Flatiron Prow Artspace in May of 2011. There are regular installations in this small but fine gallery formed exactly where the Fifth Avenue and Broadway cross.\n\np.s. The current exhibition entitled “Constructing Manhattan from the Razor’s Edge” features Manhattan neighborhoods all created by hand from artist Christina Lihan out of white paper.\n\n(via http://lihanstudio.com/) The space, which is about 30ft long, has cut paper buildings suspended from the 12ft high ceiling of the narrow, 10ft wide glass-gallery.\n\nThe third and fourth floors are plainer with screed string courses and tympanums in roughhewn limestone whereas the fifth floor is heavily ornate with abstract floral motifs and medallions figuring faces and fleurs-de-lis.\n\nAround the roof of the entire building is a stone battlement.\n\nThe Fuller Company moved out of the building (into a much taller Fuller Building at 57th Street and Madison Avenue) in 1929, and for years the area around the Flatiron Building remained relatively barren. Beginning in the late 1990s, however, building’s enduring popularity helped drive the neighborhood’s transformation into a top destination for high-end restaurants, shopping and sightseeing. Today, the Flatiron Building mainly houses publishing businesses (MacMillan Publishing in particular, has the headquarters of their various groups in the building. They will remain there until 2020, when their leases run out.), in addition to a few shops on the ground floor.\n\nInteresting things about the Flatiron Building\n\nThe Flatiron Building was built very quickly.\n\n(via wikipedia) Once the foundation was set, the floors went up at a rate of one floor per week. And once the steel frame was done, it only took four months to finish the building, which was completed in June 1902.\n\nIt wasn’t the first triangular tower ever.\n\nThough it was the largest of its kind, it was not the first. Before the Flatiron, other triangular shaped buildings such the Maryland Inn in Annapolis (1782); the Gooderham Building in Toronto (1892) and the English-American Building in Atlanta (1897) were erected.\n\nMaryland Inn (via http://mapio.net/)\n\nGooderham Building (via http://www.heritagetrust.on.ca/)\n\nEnglish-American Building (via http://theclio.com/)\n\nPeople thought it would collapse.\n\nThe Flatiron Building initially received widespread skepticism when construction began with many residents believing that the triangle shape combined with the height would cause the building to fall down, giving it the nickname “Burnham’s Folly.”\n\nThe Top Floor of the Flatiron Building was added three years later.\n\nThe 22nd floor of the building was added to the Flatiron Building three years after and according to The New York Times that floor “can be reached only by taking a second elevator from the 20th floor.” Meanwhile on the 20th floor, the windows start chest up. “I have an incredible view,” Charles Bozian, Macmillan’s vice president for finance and administration told the Times, “But not unless I stand up.”\n\nThere’s a row of creepy faces on the 22nd floor.\n\nIt’s a long tradition in architecture, especially in New York City, to add gargoyles or grotesques to the roof, parapets, or elsewhere on the exterior of the building. The Flatiron is no different. Look up at it, and it will look back down on you.\n\n6. The original elevators were water powered.\n\nThe Flatiron Building was equipped with six high speed Ortis hydraulic elevators, and according to The New York Times, was “slow and bouncy.”\n\n7. Due to an oversight in the original design, there were no bathrooms for ladies when the building first opened, so the men’s and women’s bathrooms are now on alternating floors (men are even, women are odd?).\n\n8. The pointed end of the building is only 6.5 feet wide and opens up to an acute angle of roughly 25 degrees.\n\n(via Library of Congress)\n\nOn December 5, 2013, 500 lightstick-toting math enthusiasts “Pythagorized” Flatiron Building in epic fashion.\n\nAs part of their first anniversary celebrations, the Museum of Mathematics (MoMath) and about 500 math enthusiasts of all ages proved that New York’s iconic Flatiron Building is approximately in the shape of a very special type of right triangle. The proof of the Flatiron Building’s right triangle nature is based on the Pythagorean Theorem—the statement that for a right triangle with legs (shorter sides) of lengths a and b, and hypotenuse (long side) of length c, the sum of the squares of the two shorter lengths equals the square of the long length— a2 + b2 = c2. The Museum of Math flipped this idea around—if the lengths of the sides of a triangle, like the Flatiron building, satisfy the Pythagorean Theorem, then the triangle must be a right triangle.\n\n(via http://www.businessinsider.com/) MoMath measured the sides of the Flatiron Building in a unique way. People lined up around the three sides of the building, and MoMath workers and volunteers handed out lightsticks that the math enthusiasts held end to end. By counting while handing out the glowing toys, MoMath was able to estimate the length of the building’s sides in terms of lightsticks.\n\n(via http://www.businessinsider.com/) The shortest side of the building, along 22nd Steet and designated side a measured 75 lightsticks. The longer leg of the building, going up Fifth Avenue and designated side b, measured 180 lightsticks. The longest side of the building, the hypotenuse c running along Broadway, had a length of 195 lightsticks.\n\n(via http://www.businessinsider.com/) Having found the lengths of the sides of the building in lightsticks, MoMath then projected on the side of the building the calculations that showed that the three sides do in fact match up with the Pythagorean Theorem, proving that the Flatiron is in fact a right triangle: a2 + b2 =752 + 1802 = 38,025=1952 = c2\n\np.s. This particular Pythagorean triple also has one other interesting property. All three of the numbers 75, 180, and 195 can be divided by 15 without leaving a remainder: 75 ÷ 15 = 5, 180 ÷ 15 = 12, and 195 ÷ 15 = 13. So, if we “rescale\" the length measurements by performing this division on the three lengths, we get that the sides of the Flatiron building are 5, 12, and 13. MoMath thus was very clever in choosing the date for the event—December 5, 2013, or 12/5/13, matching the sides of the building. (Interesting, right?!)\n\nThe Flatiron Building was designated a New York City landmark in 1966, was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1979, and designated a National Historic Landmark in 1989.\n\nThe Flatiron Building originated some American slang.\n\nEver hear the old expression “23 Skidoo?” It means “get lost,” and it came from the NYPD officers who regularly patrolled in front of the Flatiron, chasing away the men hoping watch women’s skirts fly up in the winds generated around the building. “Scram,” “Skedaddle,” and “Skedat,” are all modern expressions thought to have originated from these incidents.\n\nThe Flatiron Building will soon be a luxury hotel.\n\nIn 2009, the Sorgente Group, an Italian real estate investment firm, bought a majority stake in the Flatiron Building (52%). In accordance to New York’s zoning laws, they will be allowed to turn the icon office building into a luxury hotel in the near future.\n\n不知道你對布魯克林橋的印象是從何開始？我卻很清楚我的是來自於2008年的電影“Sex and the City”—When Miranda and Steve meet on the Brooklyn Bridge, solidifying their quest for forgiveness together.還記得當背景音樂“How Can You Mend a Broken Heart”響起時，我不禁地問：What’s easier—Forgiving or Forgetting?\n\n(via http://www.aviewoncities.com)\n\nIt’s hard not to be amazed by the granite and limestone structure, soaring over the East River. However, the single greatest wonderment of the Brooklyn Bridge is not its size, beauty, function or even technology, but the fact that it was created by hand. When construction began, neither the light bulb nor the telephone (nor the jackhammer) had been invented. It is truly the Great Pyramid of bridges. (In 1964, the Brooklyn Bridge was designated a National Historic Landmark and a National Historic Civil Engineering Landmark in 1972.) When it opened on May 24, 1883, the Brooklyn Bridge became the first structure to physically connect Brooklyn and New York City. Engineer John Roebling incorporated an elevated boardwalk into the bridge to provide pedestrians with unparalleled views of Brooklyn and Lower Manhattan. On the bridge’s first full day, 150,300 people walked across. “Promenading” quickly became a popular and fashionable activity. Today, walking across the Brooklyn Bridge is still one of New York’s most beloved pastimes for tourists and residents alike.\n\np.s. At the time of construction, Brooklyn—founded by Dutch settlers in the 17th century—was still an independent city. In 1898, fifteen years after the opening of the Brooklyn Bridge, Brooklyn citizens decided in a close vote to become a borough of New York.\n\nNow, let’s begin the famous Brooklyn Bridge Pedestrian Walk from City Hall Park on the Manhattan side of the East River and it will end at DUMBO on the Brooklyn side.\n\nStarting Point:﹝4、5、6﹞Brooklyn Bridge-City Hall Subway Station\n\nLandmark Surrogate Court Building is located on the northwest corner of Chambers and Centre Streets across from City Hall Park. Built of Hallowell, Maine granite, the seven-story, steel-framed structure was planned since 1888 for use as a Hall of Records and home to Surrogate’s Court, it took eight years to build, from 1899 to 1907, and cost more than seven million dollars. It was designed by John R. Thomas, a respected and prolific architect who was said to have been responsible for more public and semi-public buildings than any other architect in the country. When he died, the Tammany Hall architects Horgan & Slattery took over. The front of the building has a triple arched entrance with eight, 36-foot high granite Corinthian columns above. A tall mansard roof caps the facade. Philip Martiny and Henry Kirke Bush-Brown, both respected, prize-winning sculptors, produced the 54 sculptures on the exterior. The statues represent allegorical subjects such as Philosophy and Law, as well as the seasons. The Beaux Arts style masterpiece is a major example of the early 20th century City Beautiful movement in the civic center, along with the Municipal Building and the New York County Courthouse. The idea behind the City Beautiful movement was to transform cities with spectacular, imposing classical buildings, fine artwork, and broad boulevards. The intention was to provide an uplifting experience for the community.\n\nLandmark David N. Dinkins Manhattan Municipal Building is at the intersection of Chambers and Centre Streets, east of City Hall Park and just north of the Manhattan entrance to the Brooklyn Bridge. This Beaux Arts beauty was the last and possibly the most glorious example of NYC’s part in the City Beautiful Movement. The limestone building incorporates Roman, Italian Renaissance and Classical styles of architecture. A major feature in the design is an open plaza, screened by Corinthian columns, that appears to be carved out of the first three stories of the structure. The plaza flows into a central triumphal arch, inspired by the Arch of Constantine.\n\nDesigned to meet the increased administrative, which had grown into five boroughs in 1898 following the completion of the Brooklyn Bridge, this 40-story building (the main building has 25 floors and with another 15 stories in the central tower) is today one of the largest government buildings in the world. The Municipal Building was completed in 1914 by the firm of McKim, Mead and White (it was the firm’s first skyscraper), but the first offices were occupied as early as January 1913. By 1916, the majority of the offices was full and opens to the public. The total cost of the project was nine million dollars, which included the cost of the land.\n\nThe building’s soaring classical exterior rises from modern roots: the Municipal Building was the first building in New York City to incorporate a subway station at its base. The Brooklyn Bridge-Chambers Street subway station entrance at the south end of the building is covered by an arcaded plaza notable for its dramatic vaults of Guastavino tile construction.\n\n(via http://www.freetoursbyfoot.com/) Surmounting the central tower is a 20-foot tall gilded statue “Civic Fame,” fashioned by sculptor Adolph Weinman. Constructed of sheets of copper with a hollow core, this female figure stands barefoot on a sphere and wears a flowing dress and a crown of laurels to signify glory. In her left hand she holds out a five-pointed crown representing the five boroughs—Manhattan, Brooklyn, Bronx, Queens and Staten Island.\n\nOkay, now it’s time to hit the bridge. The first few minutes will bring you through a rather uninspiring set of buildings. After a couple minutes on the walkway, you should reach a section where there are vehicle access roads allowing cars and trucks to enter or exit the Brooklyn Bridge from underneath.\n\nThe David N. Dinkins Manhattan Municipal Building and Thurgood Marshall United States Courthouse view from Brooklyn Bridge.\n\np.s. Thurgood Marshall United States Courthouse—Art Deco design work was started in 1933 and, after Cass Gilbert’s death the next year, supervised by his son until its completion in 1936.\n\nIn the image above, three recognized skyscrapers are New York by Gehry, Woolworth Building, and One World Trade Center.\n\n(via http://www.bloomberg.com/) 8 Spruce Street, originally known as Beekman Tower and currently marketed as New York by Gehry, is Frank Gehry’s first ever skyscraper in Lower Manhattan, Just south of City Hall Park and the Brooklyn Bridge. This gleaming 870-foot tall, 76-story tower was the tallest residential structure in the Western Hemisphere, when it opened in Feb, 2011. The tower stands on a six-story public elementary school, containing just 898 units, all for rent, very unusual for a high rise in NYC.\n\n(via http://www.modlar.com/) The exterior façade—with Gehry’s iconic use of form and material—has a sense of constant movement and appears as though it is blowing in the wind. Undulating panels of stainless steel clad the structure, creating a dynamic exterior that transforms with light as the day progresses.\n\nLandmark Woolworth Building is the white, wedding cake style skyscraper. It was the tallest building in the world from 1913-1929 (until the completion of 40 Wall Street in 1930). Frank W. Woolworth, the chief executive of the F. W. Woolworth Company and owner of 318 five- and ten-cent stores across the United States, in Canada, and England, commissioned Cass Gilbert to design the Woolworth Building as the company’s headquarters on a site at Broadway and Park Place in April 1910. The building cost $13.5 million to build. Woolworth paid cash for the building and never had a mortgage on it. It was sold by the Woolworth Company in 1998 for $155 million.\n\np.s. Towering over the Woolworth Building is One World Trade Center. Standing at 1,776 feet, its height was chosen to honor year of American Independence, hence the original name, the Freedom Tower. It is the tallest building in the Western Hemisphere and 6th tallest in the world…check my previous post for details.\n\n(via http://www.cassgilbertsociety.org/) The Neo-Gothic tower reaches a height of 793.5 feet has a three-story stone base, 52-story clad in terra-cotta and a three-story roof topped with the crowning pinnacle.\n\nNow, continue walking toward the Manhattan Tower until you reach the point where the great cables that are suspended from the tower reach the promenade that you are walking on.\n\nThe Cables— In front of you are the four main cables holding up the bridge platforms. Attached to this thin rope was a piece of eight gauge wire. At the time that it was built, the Brooklyn Bridge was the the first time that galvanized steel wire was used in cable construction.\n\nEach of the four cables is 15.75 inches in diameter and 3,578.5-foot long, containing 6,289 galvanized steel, oil-coated wires each (331 wires to a strand and 19 stands to a cable), for a total length of 3,515 miles of wire per cable (the total length of wire used is 14,060 miles). Each of the four cables is capable of sustaining a live load of 12,000 tons.\n\n(via http://www.jamesmaherphotography.com/)\n\nTo create this four main suspension cables, the workers would splice the wires together, and then tie them to make the strands. A boat would come from Brooklyn and sail it across to the Manhattan side. Then, two winches on the outside of the towers would hold the strands in place, and they would raise them to the top. This was a very long and tedious process, which weather interrupted constantly. It took about two years to complete the wire strands alone.\n\n(via http://www.jamesmaherphotography.com/)\n\nContinue walking toward the Manhattan Tower. Once you have arrived at the Manhattan Tower you will definitely want to spend some time up here.\n\nView from the both sides of the Manhattan Tower—Built of granite, limestone, and Rosendale cement, the tower with two Neo-Gothic pointed arches reach a height of 276.5 feet, at the time making them only Trinity Church’s spire stood taller.\n\n(via Wikipedia)\n\np.s. The most noticeable feature of the Brooklyn Bridge is the two masonry towers, the first parts of the bridge to be constructed and took three years to complete, to which the many cables are attached.\n\nThe bridge’s cable ar­range­ment forms a distinctive web like patt­ern.\n\nFrom here, look on your left side (north).\n\nManhattan Bridge, like the Brooklyn Bridge, is also a suspension bridge. It connects Lower Manhattan, near Chinatown, with downtown Brooklyn. The main span is 1,470-foot long, with the suspension cables being 3,224 feet long. The bridge’s total length is 6,855 feet. It was designed by Leon Moisseiff, and opened to traffic on December 31, 1909. The bridge was off-limits to pedestrians for 40 years, until the summer of 2001 when the pedestrian walkway was re-opened. The bridge carries subways, cars, pedestrians, and bicyclists.\n\np.s. As the first suspension bridge to employ Josef Melan’s deflection theory for the stiffening of its deck, it is considered to be the forerunner of modern suspension bridges and this design served as the model for many of the long-span suspension bridges built in the first half of the 20th century.\n\nNow continue on toward the Brooklyn Tower. Stop about half way between the two towers.\n\nBelow you are six-lane Vehicle Roadway—At various times, the Brooklyn Bridge has carried horses and trolley traffic; at present, it has six lanes for motor vehicles, with an elevated walkway along the center-line (painted in 1971, one of the first dedicated bike lanes in the country) to separate pedestrians and bicycles.\n\np.s. Due to the roadway’s height (11 feet posted) and weight (6,000 lb posted) restrictions, commercial vehicles and buses are prohibited from using this bridge.\n\nThe two inside traffic lanes once carried elevated trains of the BMT from Brooklyn points to a terminal at Park Row. Streetcars ran on what are now the two center lanes (shared with other traffic) until the elevated lines stopped using the bridge in 1944, when they moved to the protected center tracks. In 1950 the streetcars also stopped running, and the bridge was rebuilt to carry six lanes of automobile traffic.\n\nNow look to your right (south).\n\nYou then have a clear view of Lower Manhattan’s Financial District.\n\nThe East River below you runs for 16 miles between Brooklyn and Manhattan, under the Brooklyn, Manhattan, and Williamsburg Bridges. It is actually a tidal strait and has an average depth of about 30 feet that links the Harlem River, the Long Island sound, and the New York Harbor.\n\nThe part of the straight that separates Manhattan from Brooklyn was one of the most central and significant channels in the world during the first 300 years of New York City’s history. Due to hundreds of years of industrialization, this river is still not safe for a swim.\n\nIn the image above, you can see two islands: the Liberty and Governors.\n\nThe name Liberty Island was made official by Congress in 1956. It is a federally owned island in Upper New York Bay, best known as the location of the Statue of Liberty. The Liberty Island has a land area of 59,558 square meters (14.717 acres). It is operated by the National Park Service, and since September 11, 2001, guarded by around-the-clock patrols of the United States Park Police Marine Patrol Unit. Public access is permitted only by ferries from either Liberty State Park in Jersey City or Battery Park in Lower Manhattan.\n\n(via http://www.libertyellisfoundation.org)\n\np.s. The national monument, Statue of Liberty is a gift from the people of France to mark the American Centennial. Designed by Frédéric Auguste Bartholdi, the construction of the statue was completed in France in July 1884. The cornerstone was laid on August 5, 1884, and after some funding delays, construction of the pedestal was finished on April 22, 1886. The statue arrived in New York Harbor on June 17, 1885, on board the French frigate Isère, was stored for eleven months in crates waiting for its pedestal to be finished, and was then reassembled in four months. On October 28, 1886, the Statue of Liberty was unveiled by President Grover Cleveland. It was designated as a National Monument in 1924.\n\nThe 172-acre Governors Island, located about 800 yards from the southern tip of Manhattan, was where the very first settlers of Dutch New Amsterdam landed; it is the oldest European settlement in New York. Over the last four centuries, Governors Island has played many roles—first a colonial encampment, then a military outpost, and today a public recreational and cultural site. Today, Governors Island is open to the public on a seasonal basis, accessible by a ferry that leaves from Brooklyn Bridge Park.\n\n(via http://www.governorsislandalliance.org)\n\nContinue walking toward the Brooklyn Tower until you reach the point where the cables emerge once again from under the pedestrian walkway. Now you can off the bridge and start another tour at DUMBO on the Brooklyn side.\n\np.s. Facts about Brooklyn Bridge (http://www.history.com/topics/brooklyn-bridge)\n\nThe Man with the Plan John Augustus Roebling, the Brooklyn Bridge’s creator, was a great pioneer in the design of steel suspension bridges. Born in Germany in 1806, he studied industrial engineering in Berlin and at the age of 25 immigrated to western Pennsylvania, where he attempted, unsuccessfully, to make his living as a farmer. He later moved to the state capital in Harrisburg, where he found work as a civil engineer. He promoted the use of wire cable and established a successful wire-cable factory. Meanwhile, he earned a reputation as a designer of suspension bridges, which at the time were widely used but known to fail under strong winds or heavy loads. Roebling is credited with a major breakthrough in suspension-bridge technology: a web truss added to either side of the bridge roadway that greatly stabilized the structure. Using this model, Roebling successfully bridged the Niagara Gorge at Niagara Falls, New York, and the Ohio River in Cincinnati, Ohio. In 1867, on the basis of these achievements, New York legislators approved Roebling’s plan for a suspension bridge over the East River between Manhattan and Brooklyn. It would be the very first steel suspension bridge, boasting the longest span in the world: 1,595 feet, 6 inches from tower to tower (until 1903, when the nearby Williamsburg Bridge overtook it by 4.5 feet).\n\nA woman with zero formal engineering training built it Three architects created the bridge over the 14 years of its construction (January 3, 1870-May 24, 1883). German-born John Augustus Roebling—“the Da Vinci of the 19th century”—started the project. Just before construction began, Roebling’s foot was badly injured by a ferry, pinning it against a pylon; within a few weeks, he died of tetanus. His 32-year-old son, Washington A. Roebling, succeeded him, but in 1872 was stricken with caisson disease, due to working in compressed air in caissons. Washington’s wife, Emily Warren Roebling, became his aide, learning engineering and communicating his wishes to the on-site assistants. It is possible the bridge would not have been completed without her meticulous efforts in inspection and management.\n\nThe towers were sunk into the East River using a giant box the size of half a city block Soon after ground was broken, problems became immediately apparent with the two 100×168 feet, 3,000 ton bottomless wooden boxes called caissons. Caissons of this magnitude had never before been created, and work in them was miserable and deadly. These airtight chambers were pinned to the river’s floor by enormous granite blocks; pressurized air was pumped in to keep water and debris out. Workers known as “sandhogs”—many of them immigrants earning about $2 a day—used shovels and dynamite to clear away the mud and boulders at the bottom of the river from inside the caisson. Each week, the caissons inched closer to the bedrock. When they reached a sufficient depth—44.5 feet on the Brooklyn side and 78.5 feet on the Manhattan side—they began laying granite, working their way back up to the surface.\n\np.s. Construction of the Brooklyn caisson hit bedrock after around 44 feet and was filled with concrete to create the base. The Manhattan caisson was much more dangerous. The plan was originally to lower it 106 feet to hit the bedrock, but as they got lower and lower, and the dangers became more apparent, Washington Roebling made probably the riskiest decision of the entire construction. By taking soil samples he discovered that the soil hadn’t shifted in millions of years, and so he decided that it was stable enough itself to hold the bridge. To this day one tower of the Brooklyn Bridge rests on bedrock, while the other rests on sand.\n\nEach of the towers weighs 90,000 tons Finally in 1873, construction began of something that was visible to the public, the towers. Workers had to be very precise in their measurements—the granite brick of the tower needed to be heavy enough to stay firm on the bottom of the river bed, but not so heavy that it would sink in. These towers were of both fundamental and psychological importance to the bridge. First, they were taller than any other building in the city, except for the very top of the Trinity Church. Second, they were to hold the weight of the cables that were to be strung, as well as the roadways so that the bridge would not interfere with traffic on the Hudson.\n\nEven today, the Brooklyn Bridge rises about three inches if it’s extremely cold This is a result of the cables contracting and expanding in cold temperatures. The wires have done this ever since the bridge was complete.\n\nA Bridge Unveiled The Bridge was completed in 1883, to a huge celebration. Emily Roebling became the Bridge’s first passenger, riding in an open carriage and carrying a rooster, a symbol of victory. President Chester A. Arthur attended and crossed the bridge with New York Mayor Franklin Edson to meet Brooklyn Mayor Seth Low. Fourteen tons of fireworks were used in the celebration even people from inland New Jersey said they could see the bright lights. (Although Washington Roebling was physically able to leave his apartment, he refused to attend the opening celebration honoring his remarkable achievement.)\n\np.s. The Brooklyn Bridge opened to the public on May 24, 1883, at 2:00 p.m. A total of 150,300 people crossed the bridge on opening day. Each person was charged one cent to cross. The bridge opened to vehicles on May 24, 1883, at 5:00 p.m. A total of 1,800 vehicles crossed on the first day. Vehicles were charged five cents to cross. A week after the opening, on May 30, a rumor that the Bridge was going to break down caused a stampede which crushed and killed 12 people. Due to some New Yorkers were not entirely convinced that the bridge was safe. On May 17, 1884, in one of the most famous episodes of the Brooklyn Bridge’s history, P.T. Barnum led a troupe of 21 elephants across the bridge to silence the naysayer and prove the bridge’s integrity.\n\nAccounting for inflation, the bridge cost $3.5 billion to build. The Brooklyn Bridge took twice as long (5,989-foot long, 85-foot wide)—and cost twice as much—as was expected. It cost a whopping $15.1 million at the time, which is roughly equivalent to $3.5 billion today.\n\nOriginally known as Radio City, Rockefeller Center (洛克斐勒中心) is the largest private construction project of the 20th century, developed in the midst of the Great Depression. The complex initially consisted of 14 buildings, the 70-story RCA building being the tallest. There are now 19 buildings and plazas in Rockefeller Center, housing such famous places as Radio City Music Hall, the Rainbow Room, and the NBC’s shows like “Today\" and “Saturday Night Live.\" They are all connected by a series of underground tunnels which, themselves, support a variety of shops.\n\nToday Rockefeller Center is a favorite spot to visit for visitors, particularly at the holiday season, hosting the famous annual Christmas Tree in front of the central feature of the complex—Comcast Building. (Follow the promenade down to the Center, allowing an unobstructed view as the tower soars upward like the prow of a huge ship.)\n\np.s. In 1969, the complex was the first recipient of the American Institute of Architects’ prestigious Twenty-Five Year Award given to buildings whose design has stood the test of time for at least 25 years. In 1987, Rockefeller Center was declared a National Historic Landmark.\n\nHistory of Rockefeller Center The area where Rockefeller Center is located was originally planned as the new location for the Metropolitan Opera. At the time the area situated between 48th and 51st streets and Fifth and Sixth avenues was a red-light district owned by Columbia University. John D. Rockefeller Jr. leased the area on behalf of the Metropolitan Opera in 1928 (a 27-year lease with the option for three, 21-year extension). First the design of the complex was created by the American architect Benjamin Wistar Morris. His plan, influenced by the Grand Central Terminal complex included a landscaped garden and a monumental Opera House as well as tall office towers, shops and terraces. The buildings would be connected by a series of bridges and walkways. It was conceived as a “City within a City\"— the first real estate development in the world to include offices, retail, entertainment, and restaurants in one complex. However the stock market crash of 1929 caused the Metropolitan Opera to abandon the ambitious project. Rockefeller then launched a new plan for a corporate complex to house the new radio and television corporations. Radio City was born. A 12-acre complex of the original 14 limestone buildings, represented 6 million square feet of rentable space, designed by a team of architects headed by Henry Hofmeister, H.W. Corbett, and Raymond Hood. This group of skyscrapers erected between 1930 and 1940, at a cost of $100 million, was one of the largest projects ever undertaken by private enterprise, employing nearly 75,000 workers. The Art Deco design, both architectural and decorative, of the original buildings is some of the world’s finest. Then between the 1950s and 1970s, four International-style office towers were built on the west side of the Avenue of the Americas (Sixth Avenue), expanding the Center’s boundaries. The latest addition to Rockefeller Center was the Lehman Brothers Building at 745 Seventh Avenue, which opened in 2001.\n\np.s. The first and largest corporate tenant of Rockefeller Center was the Radio Corporation of America (RCA), the parent company of NBC at that time. It was known before construction began that the main building would be the home of NBC studios in New York from which they would broadcast radio and television. For this reason, early on in the complex’s construction, the area garnered the nickname “Radio City\". And this is of course how the famous concert hall got its name.\n\nBuildings in the Rockefeller Center The current Rockefeller Center is a combination of two building complexes: the original 14 Art Deco office buildings from the 1930s and a set of four International-style towers built along the west side of Avenue of the Americas during the 1950s and 1970s (plus the Lehman Brothers Building). It has 19 buildings in total (22 acres /89,000 m2), stretching from Fifth and Seventh Avenue east to west and 48th St. to 51st St. south to north in Manhattan.\n\n(via http://www.nyc-architecture.com/)\n\nThe Art of Rockefeller Center Rockefeller Center is home to a remarkable collection of Art Deco motifs and sculptures signifying man’s development in spirit, science, industry and more. As you explore Rockefeller Center you will find a deliberate continuity in the architecture and recurring themes throughout the artwork reflecting the feelings and attitudes of the time; optimism and excitement for the future through progress reaching as high as the stars.\n\np.s. Art Deco, short for “Arts Decoratifs”, was the predominant modern style of art and design at that time and reflected the themes and feelings of the era. Looking towards the future was very important in the days of the Depression, when the present was quite bleak. There was a need for a sense of optimism, as well as patriotism, and the artwork and designs around Rockefeller Center reflect the kinds of sentiments that were needed at that time.\n\nLet’s start to tour some of the Center’s most famous artworks and how Rockefeller’s vision was ultimately realized.\n\nStanding at 1250 Avenue of the Americas and looking across the street to the west side of Sixth Avenue there are four very boxy rectangular skyscrapers—they are an expansion of the center that was built in 1959 and the early 1970s. Heavily criticized as being boring and imposing, they don’t quite reflect the beauty of the original center. This is very much a media center in NYC which includes the Time & Life, McGraw-Hill publishing, and Fox News.\n\nTime & Life Building (1271 Avenue of the Americas) was constructed for the Time-Life Publishing Company as the first building in the Rockefeller Center Extension across Sixth Avenue from the original Center.\n\n1251 Avenue of the Americas was built in 1967-1971 as the second building in the Rockefeller Center Extension across Sixth Avenue; with the Exxon Oil Company as the main occupant. This 54-storey Exxon building vertically accentuated form rises to the height of 228.5 meters, being the second-tallest building in the whole Rockefeller Center. Facing Sixth Avenue, there is a sunken plaza with large red Christmas-tree ornaments in its reflecting pool, as it does each year.\n\nHowever facing the entrance to 1250 Avenue of the Americas we see the contrast in decorative style with a beautiful mosaic (Intelligence Awakening Mankind, 1933, by Barry Faulkner, American, 1881-1966) in loggia and four allegorical stone carvings (Aspects of Mankind, 1935, by Gaston Lachaise, American, born France, 1882-1935) on sixth-floor façade.\n\nThis mosaic of small glass tiles (tesserae) is composed of over one million glass tiles in 250 colors, each hand-cut and hand-set. The work is a narrative concerning the triumph of knowledge over the evil of ignorance (thought will propagate new knowledge and advance civilization). The central figure of thought (intelligence) stands above the world, controlling the action in the mosaic; the two other powerful figures in this piece are spoken words and written words. Other figures symbolize creativity, ideas and intellectual efforts.\n\nThese four allegorical stone carvings express ideal aspects of the development of modern civilization: Genius Seizing the Light of the Sun (the development of electricity and communications), The Conquest of Space, Gifts of Earth to Mankind (an acknowledgment of spirituality), and The Spirit of Progress (a reference to the bond between capitalism and the unions during the building of the Center).(via http://tm01001.blogspot.tw/)\n\np.s. Two holdout buildings almost stopped the building of Rockefeller Center: As see in the picture, two small, seemingly out-of-place structures abut the north and south corners of the Comcast Building on Sixth Avenue. These buildings exist as a result of two tenants, one a leaseholder, the other the property owner, who refused to sell their rights to Rockefeller during construction. In 1892, a trio of Irishmen leased the property at 1240 Sixth Avenue, and opened Hurley’s (right), a popular pub that operated through prohibition as a speakeasy. (Magnolia Bakery currently occupies the former Hurley’s original tiny townhouse.) Rockefeller bought the building, but their lease trumped his property rights. They offered to sell their rights to him for $250 million (roughly the cost of the entire complex), which he refused. Meanwhile, at 1258 Sixth Avenue on the other corner (left), owner John F. Maxwell simply refused to sell. In the end, Rockefeller was forced to build above and around the two townhouses, the 70-story 30 Rockefeller Plaza remains sandwiched between two three-and-four story structures.\n\nWalk 1/2 block north to 50th St.\n\nRadio City Music Hall (1260 Avenue of the Americas), designed by Edward Durell Stone, the interior of the theater, by Donald Deskey, was the first building to open in Rockefeller Center on December 27, 1932 and at that time, was the largest indoor theater in the world. This theater, nickname as “Showplace of the Nation,\" features a stunning Art Deco interior decorated with golden rays and plaster arches. Its interior was declared a city landmark in 1978. Originally Radio City opened as a grand variety house that featured the famous dancers as well as symphonies, movies, news reels and a whole array of various entertainments. Today it is still the largest and most famous theater in America and is primarily used for big name concerts as well as other events such as the Tony Awards, the NFL draft picks (since 2006), and of course the Radio City Christmas Spectacular, a New York Christmas tradition since 1932, featuring the Rockettes.\n\nOn the 50th St. side of the building are three round, painted metal sculptures representing Dance, Drama and Song (1932). A collaboration between the sculptor and muralist Hildreth M. Meiere (American, 1893-1961) and famed metalworker Oscar Bruno Bach (American, born Germany, 1884-1957), they feature an exciting combination of metals, textures and colors that add playfulness to the plain limestone façade. Meiere first created a series of small, detailed studies; her final gouaches were used by Bach as a blueprint for fabrication in metal and coloration in enamel on a scale never before attempted.\n\nDance Drama Song These three large stylized decorative plaques represent the theater’s main activities.\n\nWalk east on 50th St. towards 5th Ave. to the Top of the Rock entrance, south side of the street.\n\nTop of the Rock is a six-level observatory atop the Art Deco skyscraper, 30 Rockefeller Plaza. The main entrance to Top of the Rock is located on 50th Street between Fifth and Sixth Avenues. There is also an entrance on the concourse level of 30 Rockefeller Plaza.\n\nOriginally opened to the public in 1933, the observation deck at Rockefeller Center was closed to the public in 1986 to provide more space for its Rainbow Room (remember the Sleepless in Seattle?). After $75 million restored and improved makeover, the Top of the Rock Observation Deck reopened to the public in November 2005, offering 360 degree views of the New York City skyline, including fantastic views of Central Park, the Empire State Building, the Chrysler Building, as well as the Hudson and East Rivers.\n\nIn the Grand Atrium Lobby of Top of the Rock, Michael Hammers (Germany, 1965- ) made one of the world’s most breathtaking, beautiful crystal chandeliers, Joie–Crystal Water Fall. It is the largest lighting installation (in 2005) of its kind and an unforgettable sight to see.\n\nThe spectacular 35-foot waterfall chandelier soars through three floors over the lobby. Made of 450 free hanging strands and 14,000 crystals it echoes the outline of 30 Rock, the building that is the heart of Rockefeller Center.\n\nContinue towards 5th Ave. to the main plaza and cross the street to the left, between 50th & 51st St.\n\n50 Rockefeller Plaza (Bank of America Building) was originally built as the Associated Press Building and the entrance artwork reflects the building’s original purpose. It is the only building in the Center built to the outer limits of its lot line. 50 Rockefeller Plaza took its shape from the main tenant’s need for a single, undivided, loft-like newsroom as large as the lot could accommodate. At one point, four million feet of transmission wire were embedded in conduits on the building’s fourth floor.\n\nNews (1940) by Isamu Noguchi (American, 1904-1988), a giant nine-ton stainless steel bas-relief (at the time it was the largest metal bas-relief in the world), soaring above the main entrance to 50 Rockefeller Plaza, depicts five journalists focused on getting a scoop. AP’s worldwide network is symbolized by diagonal radiating lines extending across the plaque. Intense angles and smooth planes create the fast-paced rhythm and energy of a newsroom. It is the first heroic-sized sculpture ever cast in stainless steel and the only time Noguchi employed stainless steel as an artistic medium.\n\nOpposite the Bank of America Building is the west side of the International Building (626-636 Fifth Avenue). On the 29 West 50th St. side of the exterior is a fascinating relief by Lee Lawrie alluding to the international nature of the building. Since Rockefeller Center was built during the Great Depression it as well understood that the commercial complex would hope to draw international businesses as well as American ones, such as steamship companies, and the decorative International Building expresses that intention.\n\nThe Story of Mankind (1937) by Lee Lawrie (American, born Germany, 1877-1963) is a massive carved limestone screen divided into fifteen small rectangular spaces that Lawrie termed “hieroglyphs”. It was created to symbolize the purpose of the International Building and to chronicle mankind’s progress: You have a clock at the top that is actually a sun. Just below the sun is Mercury and the sun is shining on Mercury, the god of commerce. To the left and right of Mercury are the four elements: earth, air, water, and fire. Below him are symbols of technology and industry. That is flanked by a mosque, signifying the Old World, and a Mayan or an Aztec temple, symbolizing the New World. Below is a ship of exploration, and the ship is going between the castles of Europe and the industry of America. And below that are figures of the four races that are identified by racial characteristics. To the left and right are the eagle of the New World and the lion of the Old World. So all of this is about the different parts of the world and about world trade because of Rockefeller’s view that through trade you would have international understanding, and all the peoples of the world would come together.\n\np.s. In order to attract foreign investors and traders to the Center, Rockefeller conceived the idea of providing European nations with their “own\" buildings there. All in all, the four outwardly similar low buildings facing Fifth Avenue were designated for that use. The British Empire Building and Palais de France (or Le Maison Francaise), flanking the Channel Gardens, were the first ones. After Italy and Germany also showed interest, the protruding lower wings of the International Building were also planned for similar use as Palazzo D’Italia (626 Fifth Ave.) and Deutsches Haus (636 Fifth Ave.), respectively. However, due to the breaking out of war in Europe the German constituent was canceled and named International Building North instead.\n\nContinue walking east towards 5th Ave. At 5th Ave. make a left.\n\nThe 156.06 m tall International Building is basically a scaled-down version of the GE Building. At its main entrance (630 Fifth Avenue), Atlas (1937) forecourt facing St. Patrick’s Cathedral, is a successful collaboration between two talented artists, Lee Lawrie, who conceived the idea and designed the figure, and Rene Paul Chambellan (American, 1893-1955), who modeled the heroic-sized statue from his sketch.\n\nAtlas was a half-man, half-god giant known as a Titan, a famous figure from Greek mythology, who helped lead a war against the Olympic gods. After the Titans’ defeat, Atlas was condemned to carry the world on his shoulders as punishment. In this incredible combination of ancient myth and modern style, the rings of the universe include the zodiacal signs of the constellations and above Atlas’ shoulders are the symbols for the planets of our solar system. Towards the top and to the north is a fleur de lis shaped pointer directing to the North Star.\n\nMythological themes are prevalent in the decorative works of Rockefeller Center, again reminding us of the past while we continue striving for the future. 15 feet (4.5 meter) tall bronze statue of Atlas is the largest and one of Rockefeller Center’s greatest Art Deco icons and has even been used on U.S. postage stamps.\n\np.s. St. Patrick’s Cathedral is the largest decorated Neo-Gothic-style Catholic cathedral in North America. It is the seat of the archbishop of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York, and a parish church. The cathedral is built of white marble quarried in New York and Massachusetts. Together with its ancillary buildings it occupies one whole city block between Fifth and Madison Avenues, 50th and 51st Streets, facing Rockefeller Center. The cornerstone for this new cathedral was laid on August 15, 1858. The cathedral was designed by James Renwick, Jr. in the Gothic Revival style. Work was begun in 1858 but was halted during the American Civil War, commencing again in 1865. The cathedral was completed in 1878 and was dedicated on May 25, 1879, its huge proportions (332ft long and the spires reach 330ft from street level) dominating the mid-town of that time. The Towers on the West Facade were added in 1888, and an addition on the east, including a Lady Chapel, designed by Charles T. Mathews, began in 1901. The cathedral was renovated between 1927 and 1931, when the great organ was installed, and the sanctuary was enlarged. The cathedral and associated buildings were declared a National Historic Landmark in 1976.\n\nThe west front with its twin spires is arguably its best feature. Opposite its west doors in the courtyard of the Rockefeller Center is a statue that appears to show Atlas, which gives an unusual photo moment–with Atlas in the foreground and St. Patrick’s Cathedral in the background. It will likely convince you that no part of the complex’s design was by accident or whimsical. And some have speculated that the giant mythological figure directly across the street from the cathedral was in a way expressing defiance towards the Catholic Church.\n\nTurn right and walk south across 50th St.\n\nThe British Empire Building (620 Fifth Avenue)/La Maison Francaise (610 Fifth Avenue), these two buildings both offer intriguing decoration adorning their facades.\n\nAbove 620 Fifth Avenue Entrance is Industries of the British Empire (1933) by Carl Paul Jennewein (American, born Germany, 1890-1978). The nine gilded allegorical figures on this large bronze panel represent industries that were once considered major sources of income for the British. Depicted as beautiful, unemotional and idealized, they include Coal, Fish, Salt, Tobacco and Sugar. Australia is symbolized by Wool, Canada by Wheat and Africa by Cotton. A stylized sculpted sun is symbolic of the saying, “The sun never sets on the British Empire.\" Above the gilded panel is a polychrome and gilded limestone carving of The British Coat of Arms. The sculpture was designed by Carl Paul Jennewein and carved at the Piccirilli Studio.\n\nMotifs from the Coats of Arms of The British Isles (1933), on Fifth Avenue façade sixth-floor spandrels of 620 Fifth Avenue, is Rene Paul Chambellan’s (American, 1893-1955) series of carvings. Chambellan borrowed motifs from the coats of arms of England, Scotland, Wales and Ireland—the four countries that make up the British Isles. The carvings help publicize the government of Great Britain, the building’s primary tenant at the time. They symbolize what is royally, historically or mythologically significant in each country: Wales is a mighty dragon; England is a lion and large Tudor rose; Scotland is a unicorn and outsized thistle; Ireland is an elegant stag with harp and shamrock.\n\n(via http://tm01001.blogspot.tw)\n\nSparkling above the main entrance to La Maison Française, Friendship between America and France (1934) by Alfred Janniot (French, 1889-1969) reads in narrative form from top to bottom. The top two heroic-size females holding hands symbolize the alliance between Paris and New York, while the three females below represent three Graces: Poetry, Beauty and Elegance—the cultural exchange between the two nations. The winged horse of mythology symbolizes inspiration and imagination. Unlike much of the art found at Rockefeller Center, this piece cannot be considered Art Deco, due to its classicism and vibrant ornamentation. Perched above the entrance of La Maison Francaise, Gallic Freedom (1934) by Alfred Janniot, this massive, majestic figure is symbolic of French freedom as she proclaims Liberte, Egalite, Fraternite (Liberty, Equality, Fraternity) to the world. Her gilded Torch of Freedom evokes the flame of revolution and its triumph. The carving’s strong details, twisted pose and deep undercuts are typical of Janniot’s style. Gallic Freedom references the energy and patriotism of the famed 1830s painting Liberty Leading the People by Eugene Delacroix.\n\nPageant of French History (1934), on Sixth floor spandrels of the 610 Fifth Avenue Façade, is also Rene Paul Chambellan’s work. Symbols from four significant events in France’s history illustrate the themes of Pageant of French History. The Roman Period features a sword with the letters S.P.Q.R., an abbreviation for The Senate and the People of Rome. Five spears symbolize New United France, while a crown atop a torch illustrates Absolute Monarchy Established under Louis XIV. The fourth spandrel is a tribute to the French Republic, with the large letters RF and three symbols for unity, freedom and victory.\n\n(via http://tm01001.blogspot.tw)\n\nWalk back to the promenade in between the British and French buildings and turn left.\n\nThe famous promenade known as The Channel Gardens (flanked by The English Building and La Maison Francaise, hence the name). (via http://kensmithworkshop.com/)\n\nThe promenade slopes gently from the modestly scaled 5th Avenue frontage towards the heart of the main plaza (sunken plaza), encouraging pedestrians to follow the complex-wide theme of humanity’s progress towards new frontier path. The center of the walkway are granite pools and fountains, which are surrounded by seasonal floral displays.\n\nAt Christmas time, of course, the center’s enormous lighted Christmas Tree, placed above the fire-carrying Prometheus on Rockefeller Plaza, makes the 200-foot/ three-block-long private walkway, the world’s most spectacular and popular hearth.\n\np.s. In winter, the Channel Gardens fountains are turned off and the Center is decorated for the Christmas holidays. The decorations varied for many years until 1954, when Valerie Clarebout (American, born England, 1908-1982) introduced twelve wire-sculpture Christmas Angels which, a few years later, became permanent fixtures at Christmastime. Each figure holds six-foot-long brass trumpets angled toward the world-famous Christmas Tree at Rockefeller Center. Both the figures and sparkling wire snowflakes glitter from thousands of tiny lights.\n\nThe flagstone promenade is lined with consistent retail frontages and the spatial relationships are cozy despite the vertiginous 30 Rockefeller Center tower. Like many other decorations around the center (depend on the day or season), usually you will see the flags of all the countries that are members of the United Nations. Sometimes instead the state flags of the U.S. are flying. On patriotic holidays such as July 4th the plaza flies American flags, and during Christmas season the flags are all shimmering gold, silver, red and green.\n\nDirectly ahead is the tallest building and main centerpiece of Rockefeller Center—the Comcast Building, also known as 30 Rock. In front of the main entrance are the Lower Plaza and the famed 18-foot high gilded statue of Prometheus. By 1940 Radio City, which became known as Rockefeller Center, consisted of 14 buildings, located around a central sunken plaza, the Lower Plaza. The Lower Plaza is where you’ll find the city’s most famous ice skating rink from October through March. In the spring and summer it serves as an outdoor cafe. The backdrop for the statue at this view point will depend on the season. From late November to early January the world famous Rockefeller Christmas Tree, one of NYC’s most popular traditions, stands directly behind Prometheus.\n\nPrometheus (1934) by Paul Manship is considered to be among the top four most famous statues in America along with Mount Rushmore, the statue of Abraham Lincoln in Washington D.C. and the Statue of Liberty. Prometheus was a Titan in Greek mythology who defied Zeus by giving mankind the gift of fire. Here we see Prometheus descending from the heavens, as suggested by the astrological symbols surrounding him, with a ball of fire in his hand. Its central theme is best stated by the quote that’s carved in the red granite wall behind him, taken from the sixth-century B.C. Greek dramatist Aeschylus: “Prometheus, Teacher in Every Art, Brought the Fire That Hath Proved to Mortals a Means to Mighty Ends.\"\n\nPaul Manship (American, 1885-1966) created these heroic-sized Mankind Figures in 1936 to flank the golden Titan Prometheus. At the time they were gilded and stood on granite shelves. Manship wasn’t happy with the installation and had the figures placed on others sites, but eventually they were removed and stored on the roof garden of the British Empire Building until 1983, when they were rescued from oblivion, restored, and given a traditional brown patina. They were first moved to the skating rink and then, in 2001, moved to their current location near the staircase to the Lower Plaza, announcing Prometheus.\n\nWalk down the spiral staircase, then ahead towards the Lower Concourse of the Comcast Building.\n\np.s. It was only at Christmas Day in 1936 that the ice skating rink was finally installed and the popular Center activity of ice skating began.\n\nLower Concourse, located underneath Rockefeller Center, is New York’s largest underground city. The Lower Concourse features retail shops, fast food, fine dining, and an ice rink. It is more than two miles of underground passageways that connect all 19 buildings, as well as the New York subway.\n\nGo up one level to the main lobby.\n\nNaturally the main entrance to Rockefeller Center’s centerpiece building reminds its visitors of the intentions and visions of the time with impossible to ignore murals and frescoes. The all surrounding artwork is by Spanish artist Jose Maria Sert (Spanish, 1876-1945) who was commissioned to paint this mural after the Rockefeller fired Diego Rivera. He used powerful imagery to depict scenes of the past while striving through industry for a better future. (via Wikipedia)\n\np.s. The original lobby painting was commissioned to the famous artist Diego Rivera (Mexico, 1886-1957), who had strong political feelings. His final work “Man at the Crossroads\" differed somewhat from the original plan he submitted and was clearly anti-capitalist. It depicted scenes of protesters marching with red flags, and even included a portrait of Lenin. The Rockefeller Foundation would have kept the painting had Rivera been willing to paint over the more controversial portions. But Rivera said he would rather see the painting destroyed than to alter it. So Rivera got his wish.\n\nThe mural directly behind the information desk opposite the plaza-side entrance (west wall of the Grand Lobby of the Comcast Building) is called American Progress (1937) and depicts the development of America through the unity of brain and brawn. Containing three Graces symbolize man’s intellectual activity, Abraham Lincoln, Mahatma Gandhi, and Ralph Waldo Emerson, while Titans and men working represent men of action.\n\nThe main lobby’s dramatic ceiling mural Time (1941) depicts heroic-sized, Titans who symbolize the three aspects of time: Past, Present and Future. By exposing their bodies and making them muscular, Sert implies that time is both part of nature and is powerful. The Titans are portrayed evaluating man’s achievements, with the mural integrating the architecture into the subject matter—both the scales and the Titans’ feet are shown resting on actual marble columns that support the lobby ceiling, creating a panoramic vision of the weighing of man’s deeds.\n\np.s. It’s said the giants atop the pillars always face you, no matter where you move through the lobby.\n\nWalk out of the main entrance into the plaza and turn around to face the Comcast Building—the heart of Rockefeller Center.\n\n30 Rockefeller Plaza (Comcast Building at 1250 Avenue of the Americas) was originally built as the RCA Building as its original intention has always been to broadcast radio and television; in 1988 renamed the GE Building (General Electric); in 2015 became the Comcast Building. It is 850 ft. (259.1 m) of art deco splendor spread out over 70-stories of shops, offices, broadcasting studios, and more. Raymond Hood’s RCA building (popularly known as 30 Rock) dominates Rockefeller Center. It is the 39th tallest building in the United States and 14th tallest in New York City. Its form is subtlety modulated by stepped setbacks and fully clad in gray Indiana limestone as are of the similarly styled though smaller 13 other buildings in the original complex. Despite its bulk, the width of the tower’s slab shaft is proportionally small. Its flat roof (instead of a spire, making it unusual for an Art Deco Building) has been home of the Center’s observation deck, the Top of the Rock since 1933.\n\nBold, streamlined and angular, these Art Deco carvings extend the central decoration across the whole entrance. They herald the advent of radio (sound) and the motion picture industry and television (light), two industries that were achieving global significance as the Center was being built.\n\nThe impressive and commanding bas-relief above the main entrance by Lee Lawrie depicts the figure of Wisdom (1933) spreading a compass over a beautiful glass screen made from 240 blocks of glass from the esteemed Corning Co. The message sculpted below, “Wisdom and Knowledge shall be the stability of thy times” is excerpt from the Bible, Isaiah 33:6.\n\nSound appears alert and animated, his voice depicted as circles emanating from his mouth, while Light emerges from cosmic clouds, raising her arms to send electrical images through the air.\n\nIt’s time to look at the spectacular Christmas Tree!\n\n83rd Rockefeller Center Tree Lighting (Dec. 2, 2015-Jan. 7, 2016) For over eight decades, the Christmas Tree at Rockefeller Center and the holiday decorations adorning and surrounding have stood as a holiday beacon for New Yorkers and visitors alike. People wait in line to ice skate in its shadow.\n\nFrom the beginning, the Tree was a gathering place and reflection of what was happening in the world around it. Even before the first formal tree went up (1933), workers lined up beneath a Christmas tree on the Rockefeller Plaza construction site to collect their paychecks during the height of the Great Depression (1931). Today, more than half a million people pass by the Tree very day, making Rockefeller Center the epicenter of New York City’s holiday celebrations.\n\np.s. Though the tree will be put up sometime in early to mid-November, it will not be lit until the Wednesday after Thanksgiving. Once the tree is lit, it is illuminated from 5:30am until 11:30pm daily, except for Christmas Day, when it is lit for 24 hours, and New Year’s Eve, when the lights are turned off at 9pm. Also, after 1963, Christmas Tree stays up until at least January 6 which is the Christian Feast of the Epiphany—the official end to the Christmas Season.\n\nThe holiday season officially began on December 2, 2015 at 7pm with the lighting of the Rockefeller Center Christmas Tree. The tree will be lit until January 7, 2016 at 8pm. This year, thousands of people witnessed the lighting of 45,000 multi-colored-that’s five miles of wires, energy efficient LED bulbs on the 80-year-old Norway Spruce (78 feet tall, 47 feet in diameter and weighs about 10 tons) which is topped with a spectacular Swarovski Crystal Star.\n\nInteresting Facts about Rockefeller Center Christmas Tree:\n\n1. Rockefeller Center’s very first tree was actually a grassroots effort.\n\nThe first-ever tree was erected in 1931 (even preceded Rockefeller Center itself!) by a group of Depression-era construction workers who were hired to build the Rockefeller Center complex. The group decorated a 20-foot-tall spruce with handmade garlands made from the tinfoil ends of blasting caps used in the excavation, and lined up beside it on Christmas Eve to get their paychecks. (via https://www.rockefellercenter.com/)\n\n2. Two years later, they made it official. The construction of this opulent new tower, the biggest private building project in New York City at that time, became a beacon of hope in the early years of the Great Depression. So for Christmas 1933, the first holiday after Rock Center was completed, the company arranged an official tree-lighting ceremony. A 40-foot-tall tree was strung up with 700 electric lights, and the shebang was broadcast to the nation—on NBC Radio, of course.\n\n3. With a few exceptions, the tree’s always been tricked out with multi-colored lights. In 1942, instead of a single tree, three trees were erected in the plaza—one was trimmed in red, one in white, and one in blue to honor World War II troops. The trees were never lit, due to wartime blackout rules; ditto the following two years until the end of the war.\n\n4. As the tradition grew, the job of finding the tree became a year-round pursuit. David P. Murbach, manager of the gardens division of Rockefeller Center, was in charge of finding the tree for nearly three decades before his death in 2010. He searched all year long, often renting helicopters to explore surrounding states and search for the perfect specimen. “You want personality: there’s density, a height and a width that we need,\" he once said. “But some trees have a way of holding their branches. I don’t know what else to call it but character.\" (The tree must be at least 65 feet tall and 35 feet wide, but the preferred height is usually between 75 and 90 feet tall and proportionally wide. The tallest Rockefeller Tree in history was in 1999—a 100-foot tree from Killingworth, Connecticut.)\n\np.s. There is no monetary compensation offered for the tree if yours is selected. It is a donation and considered an honor to have your tree as the official Rockefeller Center Christmas Tree.\n\n5. The task of transporting it will blow your mind. Over the years, the firs have come from Pennsylvania, New Hampshire, even Canada. After it’s chopped down, most trees are driven through the streets of Manhattan on a custom-built trailer; others are floated on a barge down the Hudson River. In 1998, when the 74-foot-tall Norway spruce needed a ride from Richfield, Ohio, it was actually flown in on an Antonov An-124 Ruslan, the world’s largest cargo plane.\n\np.s. The first tree from outside of the United States was from Ottawa, Canada, and was donated in honor of the Centennial of its Confederation (1966).\n\n6. Its star is made of shatterproof glass—and lots of crystals.\n\nIt wouldn’t be Christmas without a little bling: The tree is only decorated by lights and a star. Since 2004, the Swarovski Star has twinkled atop the Rockefeller Center Christmas Tree (2015 marks the star’s 12th year on the tree). Comprised of over 25,000 crystals and sparkling with one million facets, the Star measures 9.5 feet in diameter, 1.5 feet deep, and is nearly 600 pounds. It was created and assembled at Michael Hammers Studios in Germany.\n\n7. The tree got major upgrade for energy efficiency in 2007. Stringing a giant evergreen with lights was never a great move for the environment. So eight years ago, the incandescent bulbs were replaced with LED lights, a move that saved 1200 kwH per day. To put that in perspective: It’s estimated that a family in a 2000-square-foot home would use 1200 kwH to power their household for an entire month. Solar panels, stationed on top a building in Rockefeller Center, power the LEDs.\n\n8. Tree can be nominated by their owners. While the search for the perfect tree is ongoing, individuals can also submit their own trees for consideration—and that’s how the 2015 Rock Center Christmas tree was found. Back in the spring, Albert Asendorf of Gardiner, New York, sent in photos of his 78-foot spruce, the centerpiece of the family’s front yard for more than 50 years. Asendorf and his partner, Nancy Puchalski, were worried that the oversized tree would fall onto the house. “It was almost a goner,\" Asendorf told CBS. “We were just going to cut it up and get rid of it somehow, use it for firewood.\" But that call would have been a tough one to make—the tree had stood in the yard since Asendorf’s father bought the place in 1957, and three generations of the family had played in its branches. So instead of cutting it down, they submitted the tree on a whim. After the submission caught his eye, today’s head gardener, Erik Pauze, visited Asendorf’s tree and climbed nearly to the top to check things out. “It had a great shape, nice branches, and when I came up and looked for it, the sun was shining right on it so it made it even more glorious,\" Pauze told CBS. It was officially chosen in October.\n\n9. The 2015 spruce got the VIP treatment. After Pauze made the official selection, the tree got some special attention. Pauze came back to see the tree—fertilizing it and watering it with 1800 gallons a visit—once a week. (However, the tree does not require water for the entire month because its enormous size can retain enough water to keep it alive.) After the tree removal crew started tying up branches for transport, an armed police officer was stationed in the yard. Nearly 150 locals came to the Asendorf’s yard to watch the tree be cut down in early November.\n\n10. When the holiday is over, the tree keeps on giving back. In 1971, the Bragg family donated the balsam fir tree from their farm in East Montpelier, Vermont. It was the first tree to be mulched and recycled after the holidays. Today (since 2007), the tree is lumbered and donated each year to Habitat for Humanity.\n\nThe works displayed on Floor 5, Painting and Sculpture I Galleries roughly span the years 1880 to 1940. Within an overall chronological flow, galleries highlight individual stylistic movements, artists, and themes, including Cubism, the work of Henri Matisse, and Claude Monet’s Water Lilies, among other subjects. These galleries are frequently reinstalled in an effort to feature a wide range of artworks in various configurations, reflecting the view that there are countless ways to explore the history of modern art and the Museum’s rich collection.\n\nLobby: Pop Art 普普藝術 (mid 1950s-late 1960s) Pop art was pioneered in London in the mid-1950s by Richard Hamilton and Eduardo Paolozzi (members of the Independent Group). In the early 1960s Pop art took off in the U.S., it became the dominant avant-garde style until the late 1960s. Pop artists look for inspiration in the world around them, representing—and, at times, making art directly from—everyday items, consumer goods, and mass media. They did this in a straightforward manner, using bold swaths of primary colors, often straight from the can or tube of paint. They adopted commercial methods like silkscreening, or produced multiples of works, downplaying the artist’s hand and subverting the idea of originality—in marked contrast with the highly expressive, large-scaled abstract works of the Abstract Expressionists, whose work had dominated postwar American art. Pop artists favored realism, everyday (and even mundane) imagery, and heavy doses of irony and wit. Yet Pop artists like Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein were very aware of the past. They sought to connect fine art traditions with pop culture elements from television, advertisements, films, and cartoons. At the same time, their work challenged traditional boundaries between media, combining painted gestures with photography and printmaking; combining handmade and ready-made or mass-produced elements; and combining objects, images, and sometimes text to make new meanings.\n\nAndy Warhol (American, 1928–1987), Campbell’s Soup Cans, 1962, Synthetic polymer paint on thirty-two canvases, Each canvas 20 x 16″ (50.8 x 40.6 cm) When Warhol first exhibited these thirty-two canvases in 1962, each one simultaneously hung from the wall like a painting and rested on a shelf like groceries in a store. The number of canvases corresponds to the varieties of soup then sold by the Campbell Soup Company. Warhol assigned a different flavor to each painting, referring to a product list supplied by Campbell’s. There is no evidence that Warhol envisioned the canvases in a particular sequence. Here, they are arranged in rows that reflect the chronological order in which they were introduced.\n\nRoy Lichtenstein (American, 1923–1997), Drowning Girl, 1963, Oil and synthetic polymer paint on canvas, 67 5/8 x 66 3/4″ (171.6 x 169.5 cm) Lichtenstein based many of his early paintings on imagery he found in comic books. The source for this work is Run for Love! published by DC Comics in 1962, the cover of which the artist significantly altered to arrive at the finished composition. In the original illustration, the drowning girl’s boyfriend appears in the background, clinging to a capsized boat. Lichtenstein cropped the image dramatically, showing the girl alone and encircled by a threatening wave. He changed the caption from “I don’t care if I have a cramp!” to “I don’t care!” and the boyfriend’s name from Mal to Brad. In addition to appropriating comic books’ melodramatic content, Lichtenstein manually simulated the Benday dots used in the mechanical reproduction of images.\n\nGallery 1: Post-Impressionism 後期印象主義 (c.1880-1914) In November 1929, The Museum of Modern Art presented Cézanne, Gauguin, Seurat, and Van Gogh as its inaugural exhibition. These “pioneers” of modern art had turned away from the Impressionist style of artists such as Claude Monet and Pierre-Auguste Renoir. Known as Post-Impressionists, they instead looked to painting itself, exploring the direct expressive potential of its fundamental elements: line, form, and color. These artists shared an ambition to express, rather than record, the natural world as they experienced it. They inspired a new generation of artists working in the early years of the 20th century: Cézanne was an important influence on Picasso and Braque in their development of Cubism. Van Gogh’s vigorous and vibrant painting technique was one of the touchstones of both Fauvism and Expressionism, while Gauguin’s symbolic color and Seurat’s pointillist technique were an inspiration to Les Fauves.\n\nPaul Cézanne (French, 1839–1906), The Bather, c.1885, Oil on canvas, 50 x 38 1/8″ (127 x 96.8 cm) Cézanne’s The Bather depicts an adolescent boy mid-step, capturing a fleeting moment in time. The painting is quite traditional in its subject matter—a male figure in a landscape. But unlike traditional painting, Cézanne’s bather is pensive, even anxious; his body is decidedly unheroic. Set against a barren, ambiguous backdrop, it is hard to tell where the painting takes place and who the person is. Instead of representing a specific place, the painting seems to capture a sense of ambiguity or uncertainty that is typical of the modern experience. The painting does not tell a story or convey an idea; rather, this composition gave Cézanne an outlet for exploring new ways of painting. Additionally, Cézanne painted from a photograph of a man standing in a studio in a bathing suit rather than from something that he had seen in real life. The act of painting from a photograph rather than life was a decidedly novel technique at the time.\n\n(via http://www.moma.org/) Standing Model, Artist unknown, 1860–1880, Photograph\n\np.s. In 1884, only a year before Cézanne made The Bather, inventor George Eastman developed a method for photographing on film, rather than plates. The technique, which eliminated the need to carry toxic chemicals and cumbersome glass plates, helped make photography available to the masses. Within a few years, it became common practice for painters, including Cézanne, and later Picasso, to include photography as part of their painting process.\n\nGeorges-Pierre Seurat (French, 1859–1891), Grandcamp, Evening, 1885, painted border c. 1888-1889, Oil on canvas, 26 x 32 1/2″ (66.2 x 82.4 cm) This painting is one in a series of seascapes Seurat painted in the French coastal village of Grandcamp during the summer of 1885. Short horizontal brushstrokes fill the sky and sea, and the land is composed of dots of color. “Some say they see poetry in my paintings,\" Seurat wrote. “I see only science.\" Dissatisfied with the technique of the Impressionists, which he considered spontaneous and unmethodical, Seurat turned to color theory and optics to develop his own method of painting, which he called Divisionism. Instead of mixing colors together on his palette, he applied unmixed paints to the canvas, leaving it to the viewer’s eye to mix the colors optically. Seurat added the painted border later to complement the colors on the canvas and intensify its luminosity.\n\nVincent van Gogh (Dutch, 1853–1890), The Starry Night, 1889, Oil on canvas, 29 x 36 1/4″ (73.7 x 92.1 cm) This is one of Van Gogh’s most famous paintings, which features a typical moonlit scene near the asylum in Saint-Remy where he stayed during the final period of his life. Since 1941 it has been in the permanent collection of the Museum of Modern Art in New York City. In 1886, van Gogh moved to Paris, where he encountered the works of the Impressionists and Neo-Impressionists, and the Pointillist compositions of Georges-Pierre Seurat. Inspired by these artists’ harmonious matching of colors, shorter brushstrokes, and liberal use of paint, he brightened his own palette and loosened his brushwork, emphasizing the physical application of paint on the canvas. The style he developed in Paris and carried through to the end of his life became known as Post-Impressionism, a term encompassing works made by artists unified by their interest in expressing their emotional and psychological responses to the world through bold colors and expressive, often symbolic images. By 1888, van Gogh had returned to the French countryside, where he would remain until his death. There, close once again to the peasants who had inspired him early on, he concentrated on painting landscapes, portraits (of himself and others), domestic interiors, and still lifes full of personal symbolism. This mid-scale, oil-on-canvas painting is dominated by a moon- and star-filled night sky. It takes up three-quarters of the picture plane and appears turbulent, even agitated, with intensely swirling patterns that seem to roll across its surface like waves. It is pocked with bright orbs—including the crescent moon to the far right, and Venus, the morning star, to the left of center—surrounded by concentric circles of radiant white and yellow light. Beneath this expressive sky sits a hushed village of humble houses surrounding a church, whose steeple rises sharply above the undulating blue-black mountains in the background. A cypress tree sits at the foreground of this night scene. Flame-like, it reaches almost to the top edge of the canvas, serving as a visual link between land and sky. Considered symbolically, the cypress could be seen as a bridge between life, as represented by the earth, and death, as represented by the sky, commonly associated with heaven. Cypresses were also regarded as trees of the graveyard and mourning. The Starry Night is based on Van Gogh’s direct observations as well as his imagination, memories, and emotions. The steeple of the church, for example, resembles those common in his native Holland, not in France. The whirling forms in the sky, on the other hand, match published astronomical observations of clouds of dust and gas known as nebulae. At once balanced and expressive, the composition is structured by his ordered placement of the cypress, steeple, and central nebulae, while his countless short brushstrokes and thickly applied paint set its surface in roiling motion.\n\nPaul Gauguin (French, 1848–1903), The Seed of the Areoi, 1892, Oil on burlap, 36 1/4 x 28 3/8″ (92.1 x 72.1 cm) In spring 1891 Gauguin traveled to the South Pacific island of Tahiti, then a French colony. He hoped to find an enchanting paradise, far from the modern metropolis of Paris. However, by the time of Gauguin’s arrival Tahiti had been profoundly altered by French colonization: poverty and sickness were rampant. Still, in his paintings of the island Gauguin included elements of the imaginary, configuring Tahiti as a pre-modern land of leisure. His use of bright, flat, and unrealistic colors and his interest in recovering a “pure\" subject, closer to nature, were greatly influential to the next generation of European artists, including the Fauves and German Expressionists.\n\nGallery 2: The Cubist Revolution (flourished 1907-1914) After meeting in Paris in 1907, artists Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque together developed a visual language whose geometric planes and compressed space challenged the conventions of representation in painting. Although they were derided for paintings that one critic described as consisting of “little cubes,” the artists used this vocabulary to articulate what they considered to be a modern vision for a modern century. Traditional subjects—nudes, landscapes, and still lifes—were reinvented as increasingly fragmented compositions (as if reflected in a shattered mirror) by Picasso, Braques, and other artists working in and around the French capital. While Cubists abstracted their motifs, most works contain clues that identify the subject, whether it is a woman or a violin. This pioneering chapter of Cubism ended when many of its leading practitioners, Braque among them, enlisted to fight in World War I. Its influence extended to an international network of artists working in Paris in those years and beyond.\n\nPablo Picasso (Spanish, 1881–1973), Les Demoiselles d’Avignon, 1907, Oil on canvas, 8′ x 7′ 8″ (243.9 x 233.7 cm) Picasso’s seminal Cubist work, influenced by Cézanne and African art, Les Demoiselles d’Avignon looks forward to the onset of Cubism, and is considered one of the most important pictures of the century. It proved so shocking to the beginning that it was not exhibited publicly until 1916. Picasso was a 25-year-old Spanish immigrant to France when he painted Les Demoiselles d’Avignon, working in a cramped warren of studios on the Parisian hill of Montmartre. Les Demoiselles d’Avignon marks a radical break from traditional composition and perspective in painting. It depicts five naked women with figures composed of flat, splintered planes and faces inspired by Iberian sculpture and African masks. The compressed space the figures inhabit appears to project forward in jagged shards; a fiercely pointed slice of melon in the still life of fruit at the bottom of the composition teeters on an impossibly upturned tabletop. These strategies would be significant in Picasso’s subsequent development of Cubism, charted in this gallery with a selection of the increasingly fragmented compositions he created in this period. The five women’s pinkish-peach-colored bodies, appearing larger than human-scale, fill the space of the painting, which is eight feet high by just over seven feet wide. The women’s shoulders, hips, and limbs are depicted with angular lines and flat, geometric planes. Cubic shapes or, in the case of the woman standing left of center, half-circles, form their breasts. Their faces, too, are sharp-edged and radically simplified, especially those of the two women at right, which he modeled directly after African masks. 這幅畫顯示畢卡索的革新精神，他透過人物身體和物體的安排，將人依序地由左向右，從未完成的草圖，一直到最後一個戴面具、臉完全變形的人。這一系列的人物形態像金屬片一樣地翻折，預示了立體主義成熟期將會形成的空間碎裂觀念。\n\nGeorges Braque (French, 1882–1963), Man with a Guitar, Céret, summer 1911-early 1912, Oil on canvas, 45 3/4 x 31 7/8″ (116.2 x 80.9 cm) Braque painted Man with a Guitar in a mode that came to be called Analytic Cubism. In works created in this style, he and Pablo Picasso experimented with different types of representation to challenge the orthodoxy of illusionistic space in painting. Here Braque paired an accessible, lifelike rendering of a nail and rope, at left, with a nearly indecipherable rendering of a human figure playing a guitar. Braque and Picasso’s collaboration was so close when they developed Analytic Cubism that Braque later compared them to two mountaineers, bound together. In order to remove the mystique of the maker from their paintings, they both habitually signed the back of their works instead of the front.\n\np.s. Cubism’s most popular period was between 1907 and 1914, although the aesthetic lasted well into the 1930s. Early Cubist works, roughly those produced between 1907 and 1912, were part of a stage known as Analytic Cubism (分析立體主義). The later stage, Synthetic Cubism (綜合立體主義), ran from about 1913 to 1920s. In the analytic phase the cubist palette was severely limited, largely to black, browns, grays, and off-whites. In addition, forms were rigidly geometric and compositions subtle and intricate. During the later, synthetic phase of cubism, paintings were composed of fewer and simpler forms based to a lesser extent on natural objects. Brighter colors were employed to a generally more decorative effect, and many artists continued to use collage in their compositions.\n\nGallery 3: Futurism 未來主義 (flourished 1909-1916) In February 1909 the Italian poet Filippo Tommaso Marinetti (1876-1944) published the first “Futurist Manifesto” in the French newspaper Le Figaro. The text celebrated new technology and modernization while advocating for a violent and decisive break with the past. Marinetti, comparing contemporary inventions with ancient Greek sculpture, declared: “A roaring car is more beautiful than the Victory of Samothrace.” Taking up Marinetti’s call, Italian artists portrayed their subjects with fragmental forms and kaleidoscopic, flickering surfaces that evoke the energy and dynamism of urban life in the early 20th century. They depicted speeding trains, café illuminated by gaslight, charging military vehicles, and strong, machine-like human bodies—all hallmarks of the modern world. While, politically, the aesthetics of Futurism eventually became aligned with Italian Fascism, the movement’s formal influence was felt across Europe and the Unite States and, most notably, in Russia. 緊接著立體派在巴黎興起之後，義大利也出現了它在二十世紀的第一個革新畫派—未來派。此派作品否定了過去一切傳統藝術，以動態感的線條、形與色彩，表現騷動的現代生活。他們反對立體派的靜止性與無主題性，但卻吸收立體派的同時性表現技法。他們的繪畫強調速度感、空間的崩壞、物體的透明以及噪音的韻律。未來派從米蘭興起後，1912年開始在巴黎舉行展覽，接著歐洲各大都市也都有未來派的巡迴展，風靡一時，直到1915年義大利興起了新的畫派—形而上繪畫 (Metaphysical Painting)，未來派的勢力才隨之分散而消滅。\n\nGino Severini (Italian, 1883–1966), Dynamic Hieroglyphic of the Bal Tabarin, 1912, Oil on canvas with sequins, 63 5/8 x 61 1/2″ (161.6 x 156.2 cm) Severini was fascinated by the dance hall as a subject for the opportunity it offered for the depiction of multisensory experience. Here he pictures a woman with brown curls and a white, blue, and pink flounced dress as she dances to music in the Paris nightclub Bal Tabarin. Different elements of the work point to current events—the Arab riding a camel refers to the Turco-Italian War of 1911, and flags convey sentiments of nationalism. In his depiction of Bal Tabarin the artist merges the Futurists’ interest in capturing the dynamism of motion with the integration of text and collage elements, such as sequins, influenced by his study of French Cubism. Severini was a fervent Italian nationalist, but he insisted that his fellow Futurists come to Paris, as he had, to learn about the latest developments in modern art.\n\nGiacomo Balla (Italian, 1871–1958), Swifts: Paths of Movement + Dynamic Sequences, 1913, Oil on canvas, 38 1/8 x 47 1/4″ (96.8 x 120 cm) Balla, one of the founding members of Futurism, spent much of his career studying the dynamics of movement and speed. The subject of this painting is the flight of swifts; black wings whir before a window. Inspired by photographic studies of animal locomotion, Balla created an image of motion pushed close to abstraction. The wings each represent a different position in a trajectory of motion, and the bird’s body is rendered as a diagrammatic line.
