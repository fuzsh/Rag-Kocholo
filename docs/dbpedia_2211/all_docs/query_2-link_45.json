This is also true in your Reliability journey. It is important to understand the effort vs reward for all your maintenance. Sometimes the effort far exceeds the reward, or the risk is so low, that the effort is just not worth it. Everytime you review your maintenance plans, ask the question if the effort is worth the risk/reward? Thanks Bob for the post! #Maintenance #doingitdifferently\n\n\"We are here for the golfers, and without them, there is no golf club. That is our main driver for using feedback\". - shares Anna Wickberg, Golf Club Manager at Idrefjällens Golfklubb. Effective teamwork and the use of feedback have greatly facilitated her role as a Golf Club Manager. 📊 Wickberg considers it crucial to provide data-driven arguments when suggesting potential improvements to the golf course and presenting these proposals to the Board or other club decision-makers. And the Players 1st Surveys offers exactly that: Clear, documented insights into what golfers enjoy and dislike. #sverige #customerexperiencemanagement #golfindustry #growthegame\n\nKicking off our new social strategy this month, with lots of new video content, lots of more fun content, and more LinkedIn reporting and 'Impact Sharing' Always liked this PDF style reporting of recent stories and impacts, hopefully it helps us to reach more people.
