        "text": "Founded in 1860, the Open Championship is the oldest major championship in professional golf. The R&A, golf’s governing body outside of the United States, hosts the tournament annually in the United Kingdom.\n\nWith the PGA Championship moving to mid-May in 2019, the Open Championship is now the fourth and final major of the year, as it is always contested in mid-July.\n\nThis year’s edition will take place at Royal Liverpool, where Rory McIlroy won the Claret Jug in 2014.\n\nCameron Smith will head to Liverpool as the defending champion, as he became the “Champion Golfer of the Year” at St. Andrews in 2022.\n\nWith that, let’s take a look at the top five most exhilarating Open Championships to date:\n\n5. 2009 - Stewart Cink - Turnberry\n\nThe 2009 Open Championship is often remembered as what could have been, not about what was.\n\nFive-time champion golfer of the year Tom Watson was on fire at Turnberry as the 59-year-old turned back the clock.\n\nWatson opened the 2009 Open with a 5-under 65 and continued to play superbly throughout the tournament.\n\nHe shot an even-par 70 on Friday, battled harsh conditions on Saturday, and carded a 1-over 71 for his third round. Only five players were under-par during the penultimate round.\n\nWatson then entered the final day with a one-shot lead over Ross Fisher of England and Matthew Goggin of Australia.\n\nThe eight-time major champion began his final round with a couple of hiccups, bogeying two of his first three holes. Watson then steadied himself as he took advantage of the par-5 7th with a birdie.\n\nHe then birdied the 17th hole and walked to the 18th with a one-shot lead over Stewart Cink, who rolled in a 15-foot birdie putt at the last to hold the clubhouse lead at 2-under par.\n\nA par would make Watson the oldest major champion of all time.\n\nHe blistered his tee shot at Turnberry’s closing hole and then faced a down-wind mid-iron shot into the green.\n\nWatson hit his second shot perfectly, but it bounced on a downslope on the green, raced past the flagstick, and settled beyond the putting surface. He failed to get up and down from there and settled for bogey, forcing a playoff with Cink.\n\nCink then dominated the four-hole aggregate playoff to claim his only major championship victory, leaving the golf world wondering what could have been.\n\n4. 1970 - Jack Nicklaus - St. Andrews\n\nOne of the biggest heartbreaks in Open Championship history occurred on the 18th green at St. Andrews in 1970.\n\nAfter getting up and down from the treacherous road hole bunker on the 17th, Doug Sanders walked over to the short par-4 18th, holding a one-shot lead.\n\nIf he makes par, he wins The Open.\n\nSanders, who won 20 events on the PGA Tour, hit his tee shot right down the middle of the fairway on perhaps the most famous closing hole in all of golf.\n\nHis drive landed 74 yards short of the green, and to avoid the dreaded ‘Valley of Sin,’ Sanders launched his second shot 30 feet past the flag stick.\n\nHe then faced a treacherous downhill putt.\n\nTwo putts and Sanders is the Champion Golfer of the Year.\n\nFor his birdie putt, Sanders lagged it to about three feet short of the hole.\n\nNow he faced every golfer’s worst nightmare: a downhill three-footer that he had to make.\n\nIn one of the most famous gestures in golfing history, Sanders approached his ball and took his putting stance.\n\nAs he was about to hit his stoke, Sanders bent down with his left hand and picked something that disturbed him from the ground.\n\nInstead of regaining his composure, Sanders kept in his stance.\n\nHe proceeded to putt and missed on the low side, thus tying Nicklaus after 72 holes.\n\nAt that time, playoffs at The Open were 18 holes and took place the following day.\n\nNicklaus shot an even par-72 in the playoff, whereas Sanders finished one shot worse.\n\nThe Golden Bear captured his second of three Open Championships, while Sanders would never win a single major championship.\n\n3. 1984 - Seve Ballesteros - St. Andrews\n\nWhenever the home of golf hosts the Open Championship, something special usually transpires.\n\n1984 was no different.\n\nTom Watson and Seve Ballesteros, the best golfers in the world then, battled each other down the stretch on Sunday.\n\nWatson won the 1982 and 1983 Open Championships and, in 1984, vied for a third straight Claret Jug and 6th overall. His superb play in the United Kingdom earned him the title of the best links golfer in the world.\n\nHe fired a 6-under 66 on Saturday to put him at 11-under for the championship heading into the final round. Watson shared the lead with Ian Baker-Finch of Australia.\n\nBaker-Finch faded on Sunday, but Ballesteros, who started the round two shots back of Watson, brought his ‘A-game’ that day.\n\nThe Spaniard, who won the 1979 Open, was in the penultimate group alongside Bernhard Langer of Germany.\n\nWatson and Baker-Finch comprised the final pairing.\n\nAfter battling the Old Course all day, Watson arrived at the famous 17th hole at 11-under for the championship.\n\nUp on the green, Ballesteros was also 11-under, knowing that Watson shared the same score 461 yards behind him.\n\nThe Spaniard escaped the difficult road hole with a par and headed to the last.\n\nWatson, meanwhile, rifled his tee shot over the Landmark Hotel and into the 17th fairway.\n\nBut his second shot was one of his worst swings all week. With a 2-iron, Watson’s approach sailed right of the green, caromed over the road, and sat directly next to the wall behind the green.\n\nWatson had nothing. He proceeded to make bogey.\n\nAt the same time, Ballesteros faced a birdie putt on the 18th hole.\n\nThe 10-foot birdie putt had almost a foot of break, but Ballesteros drained it, giving him the victory.\n\nThe Spaniard celebrated emphatically, and his emotion on the 18th green is one of the most famous images in golf history. This later became a rallying cry for the European Ryder Cup team, especially in 2012—a year after Ballesteros died of brain cancer at 54.\n\nHis victory at St. Andrews marked his second Open title and fourth major overall. Ballesteros would go on to win the 1988 Open as well.\n\n2. 1977 - Tom Watson - Turnberry\n\nWhenever a sporting event earns a nickname, it’s usually something of historical significance.\n\nThink of ‘The Immaculate Reception’ in football or ‘The Shot’ hit by Michael Jordan in 1989 and 1998.\n\nMaybe the ‘Kick-Six’ comes to mind for college football fans.\n\nNevertheless, The 1977 Open Championship earned the distinction of ‘The Duel in the Sun,’ as Jack Nicklaus and Tom Watson battled it out over 36 holes on Saturday and Sunday at Turnberry.\n\nAt this point, both Nicklaus and Watson were at the height of their powers.\n\nNicklaus had 14 majors to his name in 1977, and Watson had just won The Masters in April.\n\nEntering the third round, Nicklaus and Watson each sat at 2-under par, one stroke behind 36-hole leader Roger Maltbie.\n\nDuring the third round, the two Americans separated themselves from the field as both men shot 5-under 65s to get to 7-under for the championship.\n\nThe next day, Nicklaus and Watson each turned in performances for the ages.\n\nWatson bogeyed the second, while Nicklaus made a birdie, thus giving the Golden Bear a two-shot advantage through two holes.\n\nWhen the final pairing reached the fifth tee box, Nicklaus held a three-shot lead and seemed destined to run away with it.\n\nBut Watson chipped away as he birdied the 5th, 6th, and 8th. He and Nicklaus then stood on the 9th tee tied at 9-under.\n\nThe next closest pursuant, Hubert Green, stood at 1-under at that juncture—the only other man under par for the championship.\n\nThe final pairing continued to duel on the back nine.\n\nNicklaus held a one-shot advantage over Watson when the two arrived at the long par-3 15th.\n\nMeasuring 209 yards, Watson pulled his tee shot into the light rough adjacent to the green. Nicklaus, meanwhile, knocked it onto the putting surface and faced an uphill putt for birdie.\n\nSince he was away, Watson played first. Using his putter from off the green, Watson holed the 20-yard shot, sending the Turnberry crowd into a frenzy.\n\nNicklaus could only watch as he proceeded to miss his birdie attempt.\n\nSo with three holes to play, the two top golfers in the world were tied with the Claret Jug on the line.\n\nBoth pared the par-4 16th and headed to the par-5 17th.\n\nAt 17, Nicklaus and Watson each found the fairway.\n\nWatson played first and immediately put pressure on Nicklaus by finding the green. He now had a makable eagle putt.\n\nNicklaus then felt the pressure as he hit his second shot fat. It ended up short and right of the green, which left him a tough chip.\n\nNo problem for Nicklaus, however, as he scuttled his chip shot to four feet past the hole, giving himself a great look at birdie.\n\nWatson missed his eagle attempt but tapped in for a birdie-four to get to 11-under for the championship.\n\nNicklaus, who rarely makes a mistake, missed his short birdie at 17, thus giving Watson the solo lead for the first time in the championship as the two headed to the 72nd hole.\n\nWatson hammered his tee shot right down the middle of the fairway, but Nicklaus still rattled after his mishap at 17, pushed his tee shot right.\n\nLuckily for the Golden Bear, his ball missed the gorse bush and had a halfway decent lie in the thick rough.\n\nBefore Nicklaus could play, however, Watson hit his second shot at 18 to about two feet, thus producing another one of golf’s most enduring images.\n\nAt that point, The Open was all but over, but Nicklaus gave himself a glimpse of hope by smashing his shot onto the green.\n\nIt was one of the most impressive shots the Golden Bear ever hit.\n\n“That was one of the most powerful, animalistic golf shots I have seen,” muttered Peter Alliss on the ABC telecast.\n\nNicklaus proceeded to drain the 50-foot putt for birdie, briefly tying Watson. It also ramped up the pressure on the little two-foot putt.\n\nBut Watson did not suffer the same fate Nicklaus did at 17 as he made the putt, which gave him his second Claret Jug.\n\nNicklaus and Watson walked off the 18th green with arms around one another, each knowing they had just produced a championship for the ages.\n\n“I gave it my best shot, and it was not good enough,” Nicklaus said after the round. “You were better. Well played.”\n\n1. 1999 - Paul Lawrie - Carnoustie\n\nThe 1999 Open Championship produced the craziest finish in major championship history.\n\nJean van de Velde of France had never won a major championship before, nor did he ever rank higher than 70th in the Official World Golf Rankings.\n\nHe was a journeyman golfer by trade, although he did not play like one over the first 71 holes at the 1999 Open.\n\nCarnoustie, colloquially known as ‘Car-nasty’ for its brutality, showed its teeth during the 1999 Open.\n\nOnly Van de Velde stood at even par or better through three rounds. After rounds of 75, 68, and 70, the Frenchman sat at even par for the championship through 54 holes.\n\nThe next closest pursuers, Justin Leonard and Craig Perry of Australia, were 5-over par after three rounds.\n\nOn Sunday, Van de Velde battled the harsh conditions and arrived at the 18th tee 3-over for the championship. He held a three-shot lead over Paul Lawrie and Justin Leonard when he pulled out a driver.\n\nAt this point, the trophy engraver could have begun to etch Van de Velde’s name into the Claret Jug, but thankfully he did not do so.\n\nVan de Velde’s drive went right of the Burn and landed safely in the 17th fairway. He had escaped trouble and looked well on his way to winning.\n\nAll he needed was a double-bogey six to win the championship.\n\nBut his second shot was when everything began to fall apart.\n\nVan de Velde pushed his long iron so far right that it bounced off the grandstands and sailed into deep, gnarly fescue short of the Barry Burn.\n\nHe had a brutal lie, and Van de Velde then chunked his third shot right into the Burn, which then produced one of the most iconic moments in the history of the sport.\n\nVan de Velde then took off his shoes and socks to see if he could play his shot from the Burn.\n\nHowever, the tide was not low enough, so the Frenchman decided not to make a further mess of things and take a drop.\n\nHis fifth shot then went into the sand trap short and right of the green and nestled right next to Perry, his playing partner.\n\nNow Van de Velde needed to hole his shot from the bunker to win The Open. An up-and-down would force a playoff with Lawrie and Leonard.\n\nKnowing that Van de Velde just went to hell and back on the 18th at Car-nasty, Perry gave the Frenchman a minute to collect himself and proceeded to play his third from the bunker.\n\nThe Australian holed his shot, an amazing feat considering that is what Van de Velde needed to win The Open.\n\nVan de Velde did not have the same fate; his 6th shot stopped about eight feet left of the flagstick.\n\nHe then faced a delicate putt for a triple-bogey seven, which would force a playoff.\n\nVan de Velde made it and celebrated emphatically as he had just won The Open. It is the most famous triple-bogey in the history of golf.\n\nUnfortunately for Van de Velde, he could not compose himself in the playoff. Paul Lawrie won the Claret Jug in the four-hole aggregate playoff, and Van de Velde was left to wonder what could have been.\n\nJack Milko is a golf staff writer for SB Nation’s Playing Through.
