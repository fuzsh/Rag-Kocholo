        "text": "Less is more for Paul Lawrie these days. It’s an approach that seems to be working too.\n\nIn his own backyard of Aberdeen, the 1999 Open champion and proud PGA member surged to the top of the leaderboard during round two of the Staysure PGA Seniors Championship hosted by Colin Montgomerie.\n\nThe 55-year-old, who is playing in just his fifth Legends Tour event of the season, posted a neatly assembled six-under 66 which equalled the tournament course record at the Trump International Golf Links.\n\nThat noble effort hoisted Lawrie on to an eight-under aggregate as he set a robust halfway pace and eventually finished two shots ahead of fellow PGA member Robert Coles.\n\nHe may not play much competitive golf these days, but Lawrie still puts in the hard yards and his dedicated practice regime sees him visit the Trump Links on a near daily basis.\n\nHis local knowledge certainly paid off on day two of this over-50s showpiece as the former Ryder Cup player reeled off seven birdies during a round of poise, polish and purpose.\n\nA delightfully flighted wedge into just a couple of feet on his final hole saw him finish with a flourish.\n\n“I haven’t played an awful lot of golf but when I have played, I have been alright,” said Lawrie, who served his PGA apprenticeship under Doug Smart at Banchory as a teenager before going on to become a major champion during a glory-laden career.\n\n“I’ll play nine-holes here most days so when I do get to play competitively, I’m not rusty. I always feel good to go.\n\n“I actually enjoy playing more now as I’m only playing six to eight events a year.\n\n“When you are doing it week in and week out, it’s hard. Listen, it’s a great job to have and I loved it for a long time. But I enjoy my life more now.”"
