        "text": "After Demo Day on Tuesday, The PGA Merchandise Show moves inside the Orange County Convention Center in Orlando for its remaining three days. Enjoy the “Show Stoppers” we spotted on Day One, as well as our general galleries below.\n\n2016 PGA Merchandise Show: Wed. Pt. 1\n\n2016 PGA Merchandise Show: Wed. Pt. 2\n\n2016 PGA Merchandise Show: Wed. Pt. 3\n\n2016 PGA Merchandise Show: Wed. Pt. 4\n\n2016 PGA Merchandise Show: Wed. Pt. 5\n\nRoboGolfPro\n\nThis may hurt to hear, but you’ll probably never hit a golf ball like a major champion. But with RoboGolfPro, you can feel what it’s like to swing like one.\n\nAt the PGA Show, RoboGolfPro teamed up with TaylorMade to bring you the ultimate experience. While waiting in line to try the experience, PGA Show attendees could feel what it’s like to hold grips that were molded by the hands of Jason Day (pictured above), Justin Rose, Dustin Johnson and Fabian Gomez. Then, they could swing like them, too.\n\nThe patented system uses robot arms to guide the club (to height scale) on the exact swing path of golf pros, but can also be used in an instructional setting to help golfers feel a certain path, which is determined by the instructor.\n\nRoboGolfPro is in golf academies and instruction centers across the country and the world, and has recently opened two new locations; one in London, and another at the Mike Schy Academy in Madera, Calif. They’re available for personal purchase also, but will run you approximately $150,000.\n\nSeeMore expands Giant putter line\n\nMost golfers know a SeeMore putter when they see it, thanks to the company’s Rifle Scope Technology (RST). The gun-sight alignment system uses a red dot on the top rail of the putter, which golfers “hide” with the putter’s shaft at address to achieve a square clubface and consistent shaft lean.\n\nIn recent years, the company has expanded its lineup to include more traditional Anser and mallet-style putters that also have RST Technology, but the original FGP, used by Zach Johnson to win the 2015 Open Championship, has remained the company’s crown jewel.\n\nLast year, the SeeMore expanded its FGP line with a new Giant FGP putter, which took the original FGP shape and enlarged it to improve the effectiveness of the alignment aid. Its lighter, milled aluminum body (the original is made from steel) also allowed for the addition of two copper sole weights, which increase the putter’s moment of inertia (MOI), a measure of a forgiveness.\n\nThis year, the company has expanded the Giant line with three new styles that will be available in February. See photos of each putter below.\n\nThe Giant FGPt ($295) is slightly smaller than the original Giant.\n\nThe Giant mt1 ($295) has a more classic heel-toe shape than the original.\n\nThe Mini Giant ($395) is the smallest of the Giant models. It offers the best size-to-MOI ratio, according to the company, through the use four copper weights.\n\nArccos Driver\n\nThere’s no question that golf clubs will get “smarter” in the years to come. What isn’t so certain is how fast the golfing majority will adopt systems such as Arccos, which uses lightweight sensors that are secured to the grip of a golfer’s clubs to track shot distances and tendencies through Bluetooth and GPS.\n\nThe company’s first launch included 14 sensors that allowed golfers to track their performance from driver to putter. Its latest product, Arccos Driver, focuses exclusively on a golfer’s tee game through a new app, which also doubles as a golf GPS.\n\nCompany CEO Sal Syed says the majority of golfers are interested in “capturing that one awesome shot,” which more often than not is the one awesome drive golfers hit. Arccos Driver not only measures every drive a golfer hits in real time, but like the original system, offers game-improvement analytics. It’s also more affordable, selling for $79.99 (the original system sold for $399.99).\n\nWithin 20 drives, golfers will know how far their hit their drives, as well as their “Driving Handicap,” Syed said. For the competitive crowd, Driver also creates challenges based on skill level and tendencies to help golfers improve their games. Points can be tracked for both head-to-head competitions, as well as for the company’s Global Leaderboard.\n\nArccos Driver is available for iOS and Android devices. The company is currently taking pre-orders.\n\nAdidas Tour360 Boost Olympic shoes\n\nTo commemorate the 2016 Olympics in Rio – the first games in the modern era to include golf – Adidas launched three new Olympic-inspired Tour360 Boost shoes. The three offerings, which are NOT limited releases, will sell for between $200 and $230 when they’re released, depending on the model.\n\nTaylorMade-Adidas golf athletes representing the United States – we’re looking at you Dustin – are expected to wear these patriotic Tour360 Boost shoes along with the USA’s team uniform.\n\nAlso, the dual-material uppers on the black and tri-color striped models (above, $230) have a bottom-half made from thermoplastic urethane (TPU) that’s waterproof, and an upper half that’s made from prime knit; a stretchable fabric designed for more comfort around the top of the foot.\n\nOdyssey’s new putters… and there’s a lot\n\nAt the PGA Show, Odyssey released a slew of new putters.\n\nWhite Hot RX: The White Hot RX putters have a new insert that combines two different kinds of elastomers to make them feel softer than the original White Hot inserts. Like Odyssey’s Metal-X milled putters, the new inserts have an oval-pattern – with a paint texture added to the edges – to grab the ball and make it roll faster.\n\nThey will be available in models #1, #2, #7, #9, Rossie, 2-Ball V-Line, and a new V-Line Fang, and will sell at $159.99 ($179.99 with Superstroke grips).\n\nWorks Versa extension line: The Works Versa extension line uses the familiar Fusion RX face – a White Hot insert covered with a metal mesh cover to improve ball roll — and Odyssey’s Versa color schemes.\n\nThe extension line includes Odyssey Works Versa Marxman Fang, Odyssey Works Versa #7H, Odyssey Works Versa Sabertooth and Odyssey Works Versa Tank Sabertooth. The new offerings start at $179.99.\n\nToe Up: Most putters are either face balanced or have a toe-down design. Odyssey’s new Toe Up putter, fittingly, has a toe-up design, which is said to reduce torque throughout the stroke, thus stabilizing the putter path and face angle.\n\nThey putters are offered in Odyssey’s slightly tweaked #1 and #9 models. They come stock with SuperStroke Flatso grips and will sell for $199.99 starting April 15. Like Odyssey’s Metal-X Milled putters, the putter faces are chemically etched with tiny ovals that improve ball roll.\n\nGears Golf\n\nGears Golf is only a few years old, but is already considered one of the most comprehensive club and body analyzers on the current market. It uses 6-8 high-speed cameras, which capture 360 frames per second, and works by finding the center of spherical probes attached to a golfer’s club and body to identify location. Unlike other systems, it does not use algorithms to determine its data parameters. It sells for about $40,000 per unit.\n\nGears gives golfers detailed information about their angle of attack, clubhead speed, club path and face angle during different parts of the swing, as well as face impact location, grip speed, shaft torque, deflection, shaft droop and much more.\n\nCobra-Puma has partnered with Gears Golf, and its R&D department used the system to develop its new line of King clubs.\n\nRelated"
