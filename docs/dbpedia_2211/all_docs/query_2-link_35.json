We really value our players' feedback, so I'd encourage everyone to have a look at the design concepts and take part in the consultation once it is open.\n\n\"It's also really exciting to have Paul Lawrie involved - his world-wide reputation as a Major winner and Ryder Cup player makes Mr Lawrie the ideal man to oversee this project.\n\n\"Add in his renowned reputation created by his Paul Lawrie Foundation and the Paul Lawrie Golf Centre, and we have the ideal person to help us establish our Golf Development Academy. We're all looking forward to working with Paul and Pangaea.\"\n\nCouncillor Alec Clark, South Ayrshire Council’s Portfolio Holder for Tourism, Culture and Rural Affairs, added: \"This is fantastic news and demonstrates our commitment to making South Ayrshire a thriving destination for tourists and visitors.\n\n\"We're already known for our stunning scenery and this makes our golf courses extremely popular. I'm excited to see the initial design concepts for the courses, which I know will ensure they continue to attract golfers from South Ayrshire and beyond, for many years to come.\n\n\"With Pangaea's and Paul's combined expertise, we're poised to elevate both courses to new heights.\""
