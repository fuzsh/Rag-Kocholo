Paul Lawrie, a former winner, equalled his lowest ever score in the Open Championship with a five-under-par 65 at Royal Lytham on Thursday.

The 43-year-old Scot, who came from10 shots behind – a major record – on the final day to triumph at Carnoustie in 1999, chipped in for two of his six birdies.

It was all the more satisfying for Ryder Cup-chasing Lawrie because last Friday he missed the halfway cut at the Scottish Open, the start of what he called "the biggest two weeks of the year for me".

The chip-ins came on the third and fifth holes and the Aberdeen golfer, playing with American cup captain Davis Love, had another birdie in between.

Then, after dropping his only stroke of the day on the eighth, he picked up three more shots over the closing five holes, including a three-footer at the last.

His previous 65 came in the final round at Sandwich in 1993, when he finished sixth. Lawrie has missed seven cuts in the Open since his shock victory, achieved when he was 159th in the world and in a play-off after France's Jean van de Velde triple-bogeyed the 18th when three clear.

"It was the most bizarre five holes of my career. I was three under and could have been one over," said the Scot.

"I chipped in twice and holed it from off the green. We get enough bad luck so it is nice when it goes your way now and again. Obviously after that I hit some really nice shots, played some solid golf, and ended up with a good score.

"The weather helps, it is almost flat calm out there, so I would imagine there will be some good scores. Overall I think I drove the ball solidly, hit it in the right place and I rolled the ball pretty nicely."

Lawrie is one shot behind the early clubhouse leader Adam Scott of Australia.
