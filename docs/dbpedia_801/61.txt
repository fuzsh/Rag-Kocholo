A rare opportunity to purchase an original boxed chromed Newton’s Cradle. This is the Loncraine Broxton “Ballrace” which made its first appearance in the late 1960s. This one probably dates from the 1970s and is a very good example. Whilst it was originally sold as a kind of novelty item for the executive desktop or the living room, it now has genuine appeal both as a decorative item in itself and as a design piece from its era. In many ways, it might almost be said to be iconic.

This one is in good order cosmetically – just a few signs of age and use and some very minor signs of pitting to the chrome. The box is in good shape too, with minimal wear, considering its age.
