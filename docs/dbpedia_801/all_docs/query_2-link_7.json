The balls hang so that they just barely touch their neighbor.\n\nVarious initial conditions can be employed. A single ball displaced will collide with the remaining four, sending the ball at the far end off. Same idea for two or three balls. Four balls, and only the first two will stop; the center two will part of the reaction. You get the idea.\n\nNewton's Balls in action\n\nComments:"
