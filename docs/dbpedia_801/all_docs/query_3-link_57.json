        "text": "What Are Novelty Gifts?\n\nNovelty gifts are something that is unique, and weird and was only made to do a specific task. It’s an object or item that has limited practical use in your daily life. It’s made to simply entertain and humour the person receiving it. It’s sometimes made for a single one time use and occasionally used more than once. These types of inappropriate gifts are usually bought for someone whom you know would get the joke and burst out laughing. Our range of unusual gag gifts can be suitable for men, women and kids of all ages.\n\nNovelty gifts can come in a form of mugs, gadgets, clothing, bar accessories, glass related gifts, office stuff, drinking games and even educational toys.\n\nWhen Is A Good Time To Get Buy Novelty Gifts?\n\nMost people usually buy novelty gifts during an event like an 18th or 21st birthday, bucks or hens night, and or even as a joke around the office. There are no specific occasions so pick the right time like the next party you attend. Just use your imagination when looking for the right gift. You can even just buy these novelty gifts for fun, for a good laugh among friends or even for that special someone.\n\nIf you're wondering when would be a bad time for a gag gifts it would be around any serious occasion like funerals and maybe even a wedding. Not everyone will appreciate your fun and novelty humour which is why you should always know whom you are getting these types of gifts for. A friend of a friend that you don't know well is a good example. Buying the right novelty gifts is like an art. Always find out if the person receiving your novelty gifts would actually find it humours if not you could seriously offend someone.\n\nWhat's the Difference Between Novelty Gifts and Practical Gifts?\n\nThe main difference is that novelty gifts are bought to make someone laugh and have fun while practical gifts are usually more sensible. They are both great types of gifts but you should always know the difference. A good example of a practical gift would be a book, clothes or maybe even a new gadget. An inappropriate gift example would be an inflatable sumo suit, willy warmers or a fake toilet roll.\n\nPractical gifts are usually more expensive and meant to last longer while novelty gifts are cheaper and made for a single use. However, you can buy both types of gifts for someone, for example, your practical gift can be accompanied by a novelty gift because it's a fun gift it can be cheap and will help make the person laugh or remember a joke or moment that you share.\n\nHow Do I Cheer Up Someone With A Novelty Gift?\n\nBefore you buy your recipient gifts, you should consider a few facts. Is this present tactful? Will the person find it funny? Is this gift suitable for kids? Is this a fun gift?\n\nSometimes it could backfire on you if it's the wrong gift at the wrong time. For example, if your recipient has had someone close to them pass away, this would be a bad time to give a funny gift.\n\nIt should be done with the right amount of finesse. Cheering up someone with a novelty toilet roll because they spend so much time on the can would be a perfect example.\n\nAre Your Novelty Gifts For Men & Women?\n\nMost of our novelty gift ideas are suitable for both genders. However, gifts in our shop can be gender-specific. We even have novelty clothing just to mix things up. It's always important to know that your recipient gifts should have the right amount of fun and not be offensive. Gag gift prices range from $5 - $50. At this price, you can easily purchase more than one.\n\nWe have a wide range of Christmas gift ideas on our website that are funny and cool even a baby would enjoy them.\n\nFrom our extensive range of novelty gifts in Australia, we would recommend the following types of gifts:\n\nA funny mug of their favourite animal\n\nA quirky gadget like a multi-tool or fishing tool\n\nA unique piece of personalised clothing\n\nFun drinking games\n\nAn educational toy for young kids\n\nA collection of beers gifts in a hamper you put together\n\nHow Do I Buy Kids Novelty Gifts?\n\nFinding the right present can be tricky. Most of the time toys are a great gift however with so many online stores you can easily find a huge collection of unique toys, gadgets and accessories that will be well received by many young children.\n\nHere are a few tips to help you purchase the right gift:\n\nStay away from mainstream brands like Disney or Mattel as these gifts are very practical and common\n\nNever pay too much for novelty gifts. If the price of a gift is over $100 then you're spending way too much.\n\nIs it age-appropriate? Is this toy funny?\n\nI bought it online is there a warranty?\n\nWill this make the child smile or just be more junk to their toys collection.\n\nIs there glass inside that could hurt them?\n\nWhat is this stuff made of, will it be harmful?\n\nDoes he already have this game?\n\nWhat type of toys does he like?\n\nThe price range should be around $10 - $30\n\nWhat Types of Gifts Would You Recommend?\n\nThese are just a few types of presents that are great for any occasion and most of them are also great for kids as a birthday gift.\n\nDo You Offer Buy Now Pay Later Options?\n\nYes, we have AfterPay and Zipay to help spread out your payments for all gifts in our store.

Most deliveries to major cities take 2-6 business days. Getting your gag gifts on time is important to us so always shop early to avoid disappointments. You may experience more delays leading up to Christmas.\n\nA quick note, shop around 3 weeks before your event / occasion.
