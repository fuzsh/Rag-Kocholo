        "text": "A novelty is something that is unusual. It can also be used to describe something that is new.\n\nIn your context, a novelty shop is a place that sells practical jokes, magic tricks, puzzles, and other \"cool\" things that children (and some adults, especially the current writer) enjoy. SS Adams used to sell novelty items such as hand buzzers, fish candy, whoopee cushions, itching powder, X-Ray glasses, and stink bombs.\n\nThe glasses which are part of my profile come from a novelty shop. Groucho glasses were worn by Steve Martin in his standup comedy days, and always produced a laugh. Steve Martin worked in a Novelty shop for a while.\n\nWhen it says \"For Novelty Use Only\" on the product it means that you should only use these items in situations that are not serious or could cause harm to others...in my opinion. In my experience, Dad doesn't enjoy participating in \"novelty\" experiments after a day of work.\n\nI would not classify the Iphone as a novelty."
