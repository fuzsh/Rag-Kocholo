Blending scientific insights with shamanic wisdom, McKenna argues that natural plant medicines like psilocybin and DMT provide portals into mystical realms and alien dimensions, catalyzing revelations about nature, reality, and the human psyche. He urges us to courageously explore these consciousness-expanding substances, seeking the gratuitous beauty and truths they unveil. For McKenna, the psychedelic experience holds secrets to our world and ourselves—if only we dare lift the veil.",

I understand we’ll meet here all of our sessions. And tomorrow’s session begins at nine and runs ’till noon—correct me if any of this is not the case—and then tomorrow afternoon’s session runs from two to five, is that it? Two thirty to five. And then a Sunday morning session. So I see familiar faces, unfamiliar faces. These things are most interesting (at least to me) when they’re directed by the agendas of whoever’s present. I have a number of things on my mind, more than a weekend’s worth of stuff. All of it is very familiar to me. I know what I think—mostly, most of the time—so don’t be afraid to interrupt, to ask questions if you’re not getting what you want. It’s fine to take it another direction.\n\nThe way I conceive of these things and how they’ve evolved over the years is: originally, my enthusiasm was for informing people about the psychedelic experience, especially plants, and how that arose out of shamanism, and how it was evidence for Jungian models of the psyche. And basically, for me the psychedelic experience was the path to revelation. It actually worked on somebody who thought nothing would work. And that’s still a large part of what gets talked about in these weekends simply because there’s an endless crop of new people who are interested in using these botanical materials for purposes of self-exploration. And doing that safely, sanely, and in a fully aware manner involves coordinating a lot of detail: botanical, chemical, ethnographic, geographical, evolutionary, biological, pharmacological detail—which we can spend as much time on as the group will tolerate.\n\nWhat I like to talk about, and what I have very little competition in terms of talking about, is the content of the psychedelic experience—which is very difficult to English or to bring into any other language, and which is not predictable or is confounding of the expectations of students of mystical experience. And so that was sort of my core specialty, if you will; was the ethnopharmacology of consciousness and the phenomenology of the states there derived. But after 25 or 30 years of doing this it bleeds into all kinds of larger categories, like: what is art? What is human history? What is the religious impulse? What is the erotic impulse? What is mathematics? And then, somehow, these concerns (shamanic, oracular, ecstatic) always garner to themselves a prophetistic aura: what is the future, and can it be known? And is it mundane or is it transcendental? And on what scale and on what schedule? So all of these things are interesting to me.\n\nMy personal history, if it matters: I grew up in a very middle-class family in a very small town on the western slopes of Colorado, which is about as white-bred culture as you can possibly achieve. It was a very stable environment to be brought up in. It was the fifties, it was all tube furniture and bad television. But the ground I happened to be fortunate enough to walk around on had clamshells 150 million years old scattered through it, dinosaur bones, extinct fishes. And I, as a kid, I was a loner and I spent a lot of time in these dry arroyos and washes where these fossils and stuff could be found. And then people informed me of the age of these things. And I can remember when I found out that a million years is a thousand years a thousand times, it was like: I go it. It was the largest thing I could get at that stage of my conceptualizing reality. But then suddenly the reality of the size and scale of nature snapped into focus for me.\n\nAnd I’ve been thinking about this recently, because one of the things you’ll find out about me if we get to know each other is: I have a skeptical and cranky side, and I’m forever puzzled by why people believe some of the (seeming to me) dumb things that they choose to believe. And I spent a lot of time thinking about: what is a dumb thing to believe? And how do you judge in a shrilly competing ideological marketplace the various claims, counterclaims, nostrums, ideologies, therapies, insights, revelations that are being peddled? And so my intellectual development, if you want to put it like that, was sort of scientific in the sense that it was always about looking at phenomena, testing it, trying to define its limits.\n\nThe strange thing that happened to me—because, I guess, I eventually became involved with psychedelics—was this method of testing, demanding proof, never taking anything for granted. Normally what that does is: it deflates reality, it flattens it, it makes it industrial and existential and post-romantic and horrifying. But in my case it didn’t, because psychedelics are actually a kind of miraculous reality that can stand the test of objective examination. I mean, in other words, there’s nothing woo-woo about it. It has to do with perturbing states of brain chemistry and standing back and observing the effects wrought thereby. And it’s extremely dependable. And from a medical point of view, it’s extremely safe and non-invasive. I mean, one of the paradoxes of pharmacology is that the substances which most dramatically affect the mind do so at tiny doses and with very little sequella. This is extraordinary. I mean, it’s almost as though the mind in this case is a phenomenon very different from the body—where, to achieve major effects in the body, often massively invasive procedures or large doses of invasive chemicals have to be used. Someone once said to me, referring to LSD, that if you wanted a picture at the molecular level of the power of LSD, imagine an ant that can rip the Empire State Building apart in thirty minutes. One ant—in terms of the scales and the sizes of what’s going on, that’s a reasonable analogy to the power of LSD.\n\nSo I explored all kinds of fringe areas when I was a kid: magic and telepathy and ouija boards and various invocations, some of which interrupted my career as an altarboy—couldn’t have it both ways, it turned out. And one by one these things fell, you know? In the same way that as you go through life, you close the door on Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny and so forth and so on as you move along toward adulthood. But then I discovered that the psychedelic dimension seemed to be an exception, that it was as though the tidy world of European positivist culture derived from Calvinism and Greek science and so forth and so on had this umbilical point, this place where it was all tied together. And if you untied it, it completely deflated and you were left staring into something analogous to William James’ description of an infant’s world: you were left staring into a blooming, buzzing confusion. Well, you know, what is that? What are the implications of that? It wasn’t a confusion chaotic enough to be simply mind dissipated into thermondynamic noise.\n\nI think a lot of people who have never taken psychedelics have the idea that it’s thermodynamic noise—you know, that it’s just the brain isn’t working right, it’s firing randomly, and then some portion of it is trying desperately to lay Gestalts of meaning onto this random firing, and so you get this kind of surreal, careening from one supposed illusionary perception to another. Anybody who’s taken psychedelics knows this is not a very apt or cogent description; that actually, these things reveal scenarios, modalities, hierophanies of emotional and poetic power that are very emotionally moving, and sometimes leave in their wake powerful ideas—ideas as powerful as any of the ideas that have moved and shaped civilization.\n\nSo my motivation in talking about these things is that I do not say that this is the only path out of the mundane coil of blind casuistry and entropic degradation. I don’t say it’s the only path out. It’s the only path I found. And I checked some of the other major players. But checking doesn’t mean I exhausted them. I mean, perhaps yoga can deliver this, perhaps Mahayanist metaphysics can deliver these things. Perhaps I was impatient or lumpen or simply not intelligent enough. But the good news about psychedelics is that they are incredibly democratic, you know? Even the clueless can be swept along if the dose is sufficient.\n\nHmm, yes. Well, so that’s just a little bit about it. And other things that are very interesting to me, as I said, are the future. But the future in some specificity, both the rationally apprehendable future that we get when we extrapolate current technologies, current tendencies, and the not-so-rationally apprehendable future when we actually turn on all the bells and whistles of the historical process and realize that it is inevitably ramping up into more and more hypersonic states of expression, and that this is what is creating this end-of-history phenomenon, or this eschatological intimation that now haunts the cultural dialogue. There is something deep and profound moving in the mass psyche, driven by historical forces long in the process of unfolding, but now exacerbated and focused by new communications technologies that are essentially prostheses: extensions of the human mind and body of enormous and unpredictable power, or with unpredictable consequences.\n\nSo, in a sense, what began for me as the psychedelic experience, a personal experience triggered by a relationship with a plant based on certain definable pharmacological phenomena, has become like a general metaphor for understanding being in the world and our historical dilemma, because in a way they’re fractal adumbrations of each other. I mean, history—call it 15,000 or 25,000 years of duration—is the story of some kind of complex animal becoming conscious and staring out, then, into a kind of universe of infinite possibilities based on what consciousness can do in the realm of energy, matter, light, time, and space. Well, so, in a way, the psychedelic experience is like a microcosmic reflection of that: you start from baseline—which is your ordinary lumpen (or not so lumpen, depending on who you are) state of consciousness—but wherever you start from, it lifts you up in a process of evolutionary unfoldment that is squeezed into hours, and it goes on entirely in the evolution of thoughts, feelings, and perceptions. And it seemed to me for a long time—at least since I read McLuhan and assimilated his notion of tools as things which have a feedback into how we see the world—it seemed to me that the psychedelic state was, then, like a predictive model for what human history wanted to do. Human history wants to break through all boundaries, to somehow have a realized collective relationship with deity or that which orders nature, or some fairly large concept like that.\n\nSo for my own benefit and for the benefit of the group, it’s useful to move around the circle and just hear who’s here and what their professional interest, or just something that we can hang a tag on so we know if we’re half psychotherapists and half advertising executives, or how many hackers are here, how many molecular biologists. Something like that. So with your indulgence—and please don’t talk long in a situation like this; lack of brevity is considered proof of psychosis…. You laugh. Why don’t you say some little thing about yourself that keys us?\n\n[???]\n\nYeah, the implications. It’s all in the implications. It has to do with how much intelligence you bring to it at the beginning, you know? If there’s no mind behind the retinal screen, then it’s just mental pyrotechnics. But it’s how much we can make of the phenomenon that makes it so rich.\n\n[???]\n\nYeah, you mentioned the gratuitous grace—this is based on a famous comment by Aldous Huxley. He was asked at one point: what is the psychedelic experience? And he said it’s a gratuitous grace. And then he explained: it is neither necessary for salvation nor sufficient for salvation. But it certainly makes it easier. It’s like an aid, it’s a cul-de-sac. I mean, we can’t suppose that it’s necessary for salvation because too many people have gone from birth to the grave without it. But one has attained a very fortunate incarnation, I think, to be in a culture, in a place, in a time when psychedelic knowledge is available. And it’s a kind of paradox that in our own time (meaning in the last hundred years) all this information has arrived in our laps as the hubristic enterprise of white-man anthropology carried back all these medicine kits and mojo bags and sacred plants and so forth, and grew them in university botanical gardens and kept the stuff in locked drawers. It was like a Trojan horse brought inside the city walls of Calvin’s Troy. And now the genie is out of the bottle.\n\nI’ll have to restrain myself with these long exegetical comments on each person’s… yeah?\n\n[???]\n\nYeah, I’m interested in all of this, too: the rising paranoia, and what it means, and how to come to terms with what I call the balkanization of epistemology—the fact that large groups of people no longer demand that the world even make sense, they’re operating on synthetic ontologies that have risen above the concept of mere sense. But, you know, there’s a whiff of fascism about that that has to be fully deconstructed before we want to sign up.\n\nYeah?\n\n[???]\n\nWell, I have answers for all three of your questions, but it would take a while to unfold it. But as far as this last question is concerned, the official answer is: because it came with the conquest; that the stropharia cubensis, the psilocybe cubensis only prefers the dung of bos indicus cattle. So it was so associated with the cultural genocide brought by the Spanish conquerors. And this is the same reason given why, in Mexico—though in the Mexican situation it’s a little different. You actually have an indigenous population of native mushrooms, but you also have the san isidro; the cubensis. But it’s considered inferior—when it isn’t by any chemical index. So I think it’s a deep association to the conquest is the only thing I can figure.\n\nThe other thing may be—and this is more… I gave you the official answer; then here’s an answer based on my own experience—though I know that some people combine harmine with psilocybin, when I have done it it has scared the socks off me. It seems an unfriendly combination for me. Now, the way I did it was: I took half a dose of ayahuasca and half a dose of mushrooms. Do not do this! If you must combine these two compounds, I think the way you want to do it is take a fairly substantial dose of an MAO-inhibitor, either peganum harmala seeds or banisteriopsis, and a very light amount of mushrooms. But the 50-50 combination was one of the longest evenings I’ve ever spent.\n\nAnd if I seem not to be going to answer your other two questions in the course of the weekend, remind me. Because… yeah, I’m keen to get to both of those.\n\nYeah?\n\n[???]\n\nCommunity and connection. Yeah, it’s important for all of you to notice everyone who’s here, because our agenda has triumphed so completely, culturally, that we can’t tell ourselves from the rest of the population as we could in the sixties. So it’s only at moments like this when we emerge out of the darkness and show ourselves to each other. And I will sail on to the next new age watering hole or institute or whatever, but you should all realize that, probably, whatever you’re looking for, someone in this room could help you out if you could but figure out exactly who it is and what it is you’re looking for.\n\nYeah?\n\n[???]\n\nIt may come to that, yeah. Yeah, well, we need to think this seating thing through. This is how we came in, and probably I will do it tonight, but if you spontaneously reorganize yourselves I won’t say anything about it. It’s interesting that you mentioned the Kundalini thing, because those of you who’ve read my book True Hallucinations know that my brother and I got into something that was triggered by psychedelics, and started out as a psychedelic trip, but then developed into either an episode of schizophrenia or a revelation or it depended on who was voting. And this can happen. These things are… the path goes further than most sojourners wish to travel, I think. I mean, the power is immense. And once you find the way, it isn’t a matter of… it can be overwhelming. Someone once said, “The yogan and the schizophrenic are divers in the same ocean, but one of them has learned how to use scuba equipment and the other is simply drowning.” So the reason for the emphasis on shamanism and on other techniques is: you will need techniques if you go into the deep water. And they can make your life very simple and save you from unnecessary suffering. Not all suffering is necessary. Maybe no suffering is necessary.\n\nYeah?\n\n[???]\n\nYeah, one of the things that I’m keen to talk to you about is, you know, there are various models of the psychedelic experience: that it’s the Jungian unconscious, that it’s the ancestor world, that it’s this or that. The one that I’m most struck by is: it’s the world of the Platonic ideals. It’s a world very closely related to mathematics. And, in a way, the shaman is a hyper-mathematician—not in that he proposes theorems and solves them, but that he perceives hyper-dimensionally. And the magical power of the shaman—the power to predict weather, to tell where the game has gone, to cure, to have deep insight into social problems within the tribal group—all these so-called magical powers become completely understandable if you believe that the shaman actually attains a kind of hyper-dimensional perception. And, you know, also LINK TO DOCUMENT teaching here this weekend is my old buddy Ralph Abraham, who’s one of the world’s leading exponents of chaos dynamics. And he has told me many times that the DMT flash for him is simply and straightforwardly a perception of hyperspace, a coordination—and this is why metaphors like “inner eye” and “inner seeing” make sense, because of course in hyperspace the inside of the body is no more secret from perception than the outside of the body. So yeah, mathematics is one of the few things I still trust at this point.\n\n[???]\n\nYeah, that’s… my motivation is basically on curiosity. I mean, I’m fascinated that we’ve gotten this far. I mean, given that the most economical situation would be pure nothingness, what is this? I mean, and why is nature doing these things? And why does organization have such a tenacity? And what does it mean that we appear so late in the process and represent such a difference in the rest of nature? It’s very mysterious. We get used to reality because it’s so stable, but in fact it’s an absolutely confounding situation. Besides the DMT flash, the only other thing that I know that’s as confounding as that is ordinary consciousness and incarnate being in a body. It’s just so improbable, you know?\n\nYeah?\n\n[???]\n\nYeah, well I was very resonant with the person over here who mentioned Evelyn Underhill’s book on mysticism, because I also read it at about that age, and I wanted these mystical experiences. The problem is that the thing that is so powerful about the psychedelics is that they perform on demand, which almost in principle you cannot expect of a mystical experience because that would be essentially man ordering God at man’s whim, which is not how it’s supposed to work. Similarly, you know, waiting for UFOs to come by, you spend a lot of cold nights in the corn field. But if you were to take five dried grams of stropharia cubensis and spend the night in the corn field, I don’t know whether you would get UFOs, but I guarantee you, by morning your notebook would be full of something.\n\nSo the fascinating thing about the psychedelic is: of all of the… it seems magical in the sense that it seems to respond to human will. One decides whether this is the evening or not. And sometimes people have said to me, “Well, don’t you want to achieve these things on the natch?” Well, to me that suggests a certain degree of out-of-controlness. In other words, if I were—sitting here—suddenly to notice that I appear to have taken twenty milligrams of psilocybin, I would be alarmed. I would be concerned, I would want to know the casuistry of why I felt this way, whether someone had dosed me at dinner, or I was losing my mind, or what was going on. On the other hand, if I had initiated the experience I would be perfectly at ease with it and see the unfolding signposts and know what it was. Yeah, it’s a difference of sort of waiting in an attitude of the supplicant, the expectant supplicant, or being the hierophant with all the Faustian echoes that that carries with it, and being able to call down the power, or go up to the power, at will. And, you know, that’s a fantastic thing and a responsibility.\n\nYeah?\n\n[???]\n\nYeah, one of the things that inevitably downloads out of all this psychedelic stuff is—because it’s central to understanding our nature anyway—is: how do we relate to our sexuality, to our relationships, to our obligations, to biology, and romanticism, and so forth and so on? And you mentioned monotony, monogamy, and monotheism—or… was that the one? Yeah, well, part of what happens with a career like mine is: everything you ever say is taped. So then, your ideas may change over time, but people will listen to an eight-year-old tape, a six-year-old tape, and so you’re like imprisoned or liberated (I haven’t figured out which), because you must account for every opinion you ever held, even if you no longer hold it. The toughest thing to figure out is relationships. It is the yoga of the West. But it’s harder than yoga. And I’m 52, nearly, and I don’t feel greatly wiser in this are than I felt at 24. And, you know, I’ve had a marriage, I’ve had a divorce, I’ve been single, I’ve had long-term relationships, short-term relationships, on and on and on.\n\nThis is… well, part of what I’ll say in a larger context is: we shouldn’t seek for closure. Part of what the psychedelic point of view represents is: living a certain portion of your life without answers. Just accepting that certain dilemmas will never resolve themselves into some kind of a complete answer. That’s why psychedelics are so different from any system being sold—from one of the great elder systems, like Christianity, to the latest cult out of Los Angeles. These cults, these cultic answers, always invariably provide a complete set of answers to life’s dilemmas at the price of being absurd, but this doesn’t seem to bother people. So part of what being psychedelic means, I think, is relentlessly living with unanswered questions. And this relationship thing, this is the heart of the alchemical furnace. This is where the coincidencia oppositorum is a fact in your life and my life. And I don’t know whether psychedelics make it easier or harder to come to terms to that. They certainly reveal its many facets with incredible and sometimes bewildering clarity.\n\nYeah?\n\n[???]\n\nI think it works faster. You’re right, I never have said much about it because my own style was always to weigh the dose. I mean, I guess I’m just that much of an engineering type to weigh the dose. With the tea you don’t know exactly how much you’ve taken. I had an experience in London one time where I went to these people’s house and they were serving mushroom tea, and I think the miscible portion of the psilocybin must have been floating on the surface, because the hit I got from this cup of almost clear broth was staggering. And nobody else got loaded at all; I think I got 90% of the thing. So I think if you didn’t emulsify it, the tea delivers an uneven dose. Of course, if you’re drinking the entire dose—\n\n[???]\n\nIt’s just a habit. There’s nothing wrong with doing it that way. Usually, in my mushroom-taking career, I was the grower, and so I somehow just wanted to eat it directly. Like, usually, that’s how I do it. I just don’t even… it doesn’t for me require honey or anything to wash it down. They get a little rasty, that’s right. And if they’re rubbery then they can have secondary bacteria and stuff growing in them. So in that case, adding hot water, giving them a splash of boiling water, probably isn’t a bad idea.\n\nYeah?\n\n[???]\n\nYou know, it’s a frustrating situation, because the literature tells you that DMT occurs widely throughout nature: distributed through grasses, mammalian brain tissue, leguminous trees, rubiaceous plants. But when you actually go to try and get it out, you encounter two problems. Either it’s spread very thin, or—and if it’s spread thin by simply gross overwhelment you can get it out. But the other problem is: it often occurs complexed with other tryptamines of very nearly the same molecular weight, and they have activity you don’t want: cardioactive activity or like that. So practically speaking, in my own experience, the cleanest source of DMT is psychotria viridis. And if you can get hold of it and grow it you will obtain a clean source of DMT. But basically you need five acres in a tropical country to do it right. That’s why I have five acres in a tropical country…!\n\n[???]\n\nWhat? Well, it is schedule one. Pardon me? Yeah, all DMT is schedule one. But there’s a weird Catch-22 around that. I mean, we all contain DMT. So, you know, it’s like the universal holding law. Everybody’s holding. Everybody is potentially out from under the umbrella. Probably—though you may not wish to hear this—the shortcut, the easier path, is to just tighten your belt and learn organic chemistry, and make it then from scratch, or from tryptophan, or from indole, or something. But it’s a puzzle why there is so little DMT, because as a synthetic process it’s not that difficult. It’s certainly far less difficult than making LSD or something like that. But it’s vanishingly rare in the underground. One reason for that may be, you know: if you sell somebody a gram, they may leave a significant portion of it to their great-grandchildren. This is not a drug of abuse. Where what people like are drugs where you sell somebody a gram at eight in the evening and at eleven o’clock they’re beating on your door to buy two more. This is not like that, you know?\n\n[???]\n\nYou mean what is it doing there? It’s not really well understood. The people who identified it, their best guess was that it had something to do with very rapid shifts of short-term attention. In other words, a shot is fired, everyone in the room turns and looks in well under a second. That is—possibly those shifts of attention are mediated by DMT. The fact that it is so dramatic as a psychedelic experience but goes away so quickly makes it an ideal chemical to use in these kinds of short-term reactions where something spikes and then very rapidly returns to its baseline. But what it’s really doing in human metabolism, we don’t know. DMT, like many psychedelics, competes with serotonin for the serotonergic bond site. Interesting, then, that drugs like Prozac and Zoloft—these new antidepressants—they also relate to (though in a different way) the serotonergic system, one of the four major neurotransmitter systems that operates in the human brain. It’s no surprise to me that these extremely effective antidepressants are emerging out of meddling with serotonergic chemistry. DMT—many people experience it as orgasmic or ecstatic. Ecstasy is not simply joy, ecstasy is an emotion of great complexity that hovers almost on the edge of terror sometimes.\n\nBut, you know, we could speculate that the orgasm is an interesting phenomenon, and what is the chemical basis of orgasm, and why does it occur at all? Since, in many animals, it doesn’t occur. And, in fact, as you advance in the animal phylogeny, orgasm becomes more common. Well, it’s… I would bet that the chemistry of orgasm, the chemistry of DMT, the chemistry of mood-alteration, in the next five or ten years this will all be pieced, deconstructed, and understood. I mean, the recent flap about Viagra will be as nothing when a drug is discovered which causes orgasm. And chemically this is probably not far out of reach. Orgasm is a pretty general spectrum chemical response that you ought to be able to pharmacologically mimic with reasonable facility. I’m sure some of our best people at pharmaceutical companies are hard at work on this.\n\nYeah? But I digress!\n\n[???]\n\nThat sounds fine. I mean, I’m not commenting on the price, I’m commenting on the pharmacology. If you take two grams of peganum harmala seeds, well ground, and a sufficient amount of the root scrapings of mimosa hostilis, which is the Brazilian species, and then the conspecific Mexican species is mimosa tenuiflora. As far as we can tell, chemically, these things are equivalent. That works. Basically, if you’re serious about pursuing this, you need to get into the habit of growing things and gardening, or you need to sharpen up your chemistry chops and actually become a synthetic chemist.\n\n[???]\n\nWell, the jungle ayahuasca, you know, you don’t need that much harmine or harmaline to inhibit your monoamine oxidase. People tend to overkill on that. I think that the jungle ayahuascas, they have a cultural value system that places emphasis on vomiting. They even call this stuff la purga: they want to vomit violently and dramatically. We’re not so keen for that. So we don’t need such an amount of harmine or harmaline. So you can—if you’re fiddling with this you can cut it back. Most people use pegamon harmala seeds to inhibit their MAO. You don’t need more than two grams of that. At two grams, 90% of the MAO in your body is fully inhibited for four to six hours, and more than that is simply kicking up your gastric response.\n\nSo these things are available legally by mail?\n\nOh yeah, there’s been a whole revolution. There are seedsmen who sell the makings of all of these things. And Jonathan Ott’s book Ayahuasca Analogues—I guess what I’m saying is: it’s not as easy as it sounds right off the bat. You may spend a few evenings not getting off or a few evenings wandering in some fairly peculiar mind states before you finally grab the brass ring. But it’s out there. It’s out there.\n\nYeah?\n\n[???] and I had no idea.\n\nYou mean you had no idea that this was a category of human pursuit and that people came to workshops like this and talked botany, chemistry, and all this stuff? Yeah, well… I agree that it’s a weird subset. It’s a weird—\n\n[???] and I had no idea.\n\nWell, maybe bong-making.\n\nHow do you do? Thank you. My name is Nicholas [???], and I’m a federal narcotics agent. I’m here to do my job, and I can tell that many of you are on these schedule A substances at this moment. Probably half of you. We can do this easy, we can do this hard. The easy way is this: tonight, in the cover of darkness, you bring these substances to my room. Don't worry, there will be no questions asked [???]. As a matter of fact, I will come looking for them. It will not be pretty. Thank you, carry on.\n\nVery good! So you were warned. You were warned.\n\n[???]\n\nWell, Wallace Stevens was an insurance adjuster, and he managed to get good mileage out of it—so you just can’t tell, you know? God is in the cabbages.\n\nMy name is Birgit. I went to the jungle in Peru and [???] two mushroom journeys by myself [???] was one of your books [???]. I’m here to hear what you have to say.\n\nDoubtless, some Amazonian shaman had lost it for you to stumble over.\n\nYeah?\n\nI’m Larry. I manage a group of Internet docs for a large phone company, and I’ve been involved in the net since the late 1980s and had been struck for years by the fact that a very significant percentage of the people who’ve been building the infrastructure for the last twenty years are also very deeply involved in psychedelics. And I’m here to learn a little bit more about possible ways we can maybe leverage the net for the archaic concepts that you’ve espoused and endorsed.\n\nYeah, it’s incredible the connection between the psychedelic culture and high technical culture, and how this is rarely discussed. But the people who built the Internet, who conceive of these complex machine architectures, the people at the cutting edge in AI, in chaos theory, in dynamics, are all graduates of these experiences.\n\n[???]\n\nYeah, there’s a new book—I see it’s in the bookstore here—the Maya Cosmogenesis 2012, John Jenkins’ book about Mayan archeo-astronomy. If you’re interested in all that, his book pretty much lays it out in greater detail and in a more scholarly fashion than anybody else has done. Because there is a lot of loose-headedness around when it comes to talking about the Maya. But this guy is a very good scholar. And as is always the case, the real truth is more astonishing than any myth. So if you’re interested in all that, check it out. And we will talk about the Maya and the time wave and the millennium and all of that stuff in the course of the weekend.\n\n[???]\n\nYeah, all this is fascinating. I mean, I’ve pursued the paranormal my whole life, and out of 52 years I’ve been in its presence for maybe five minutes. But those five minutes were absolutely real. I mean, at least under some conditions you can understand what another person is thinking. You can even look into their memories. But what those conditions are, how to return to it—but having seen it only once or twice in my life, that’s enough. You know, miracles are not bought cheaply. I mean, some people would have you believe otherwise, and that there’s telepathy all around you. Well, maybe there is, but not that I could see. But on the other hand, functioning as a skeptic, there still were encounters at certain points that were uncanny by any rational standard.\n\nYeah?\n\n[???]\n\nWhat do you mean exactly by “experience of the primordial”? Well, I wrote a book called The Archaic Revival, where the idea there is that we are discomforted, civilization has made us uncomfortable with our humanness, because these various technologies and phonetic alphabets and things like that have rearranged our sensory ratios from what they were in paleolithic times. And that, in a sense, what psychedelics do is: they hit your reset button. They address the animal body. They address a deeper level than cultural conditioning. And so you feel and experience these atavistic images and feelings that civilization has repressed or transmuted in you. And, you know, the whole premise of that book was that the twentieth century in many of its cultural manifestations—from cubism to Dada, abstract expressionism, jazz, sexual permissiveness, hallucinogenic drugs, youth culture—a whole bunch of things were all impulses toward the primitive, toward a return to a primal state of social organization. And that, really, this is the overarching metaphor of the twentieth century. The nineteenth century saw the triumph of hierarchical order, gentlemanly values, class structure, all that constipated European stuff. And then the twentieth century is experienced as chaos, you know? Cubism is created when Picasso brings African masks to Paris and begins painting them. Freud announces that we are not just Christian ladies and gentlemen, but that right beneath the surface the incest drive, cannibalistic drives, extremely violent primitive impulses are there. Jazz introduces syncopation into music. Women begin to display more of their animal nature through flapper dancing. I don’t know, you can figure it all out for yourself. The point is: the whole of the twentieth century is a turning back toward these values that had been repressed for millennia—not only by Christianity, but by the Greek scientific philosophy, the phonetic alphabet, urbanism, agriculture itself. There was a very long period in the human adventure when all of those things lay in our future. And we were far happier (I think) then, judging by our lack of need to make egoistic statements by building vast religious monuments, or enslaving each other, or setting down codes of laws, so forth and so on. And of course we’ll never be like that again. But there is an impulse in modern society to recapture those values. And psychedelics are hugely effective at doing this. I mean, all this talk of shamanism, and native Americanism, and getting in touch with your body, and honoring gender shifts, and all of this stuff is basically rooted in a more psychedelic attitude, a less categorical and constipated and print-defined—McLuhan would say—attitude toward social roles and social polity.\n\nYeah?\n\nI’m Tom. I teach literature and mythology, and I’ve been experimenting with my own forms of exploration for many, many years. But as many of you have said here, much of that for me has been a kind of individual quest, a kind of—and I just thought that the opportunity to meet you and to interact with the rest of you who shared some of the same kind of interests in opening up our minds and our experience and put the quintessential expression of that through language that you bring to that. And along with that, the kind of interacting (as several of you have mentioned) on looking at some of the same areas that we’re attempting to explore. As I watch us go around the group and heard and felt in myself the resonance with a number of the experiences and expressions that many of you have had, I realize how, at some other level, we all seem to have a kind of shared experience that is somehow coming into a focus here, and that is perhaps being given expression—most eloquently through you. But I think through our need to be here—that’s how I felt—just a need to come and somehow just be part of this experience with you, and I’m glad to be here.\n\nIt’s not really a coincidence. It’s sort of hard to avoid me on the Internet. There’s just so much stuff—not all put there by me by a long shot.\n\nWell, did we touch everybody? Did everybody have their say? Well, it’s always interesting to me to do these around-in-a-circle things. First of all, it seems to me—I mean, maybe this is self-congratulatory—but it seems to me that people are extraordinarily serious and together. I have a real nose for nuttiness, and I didn’t so much as twitch this evening—and this is a large group! So don’t loosen your chains too much, but congratulations for impressing me, anyway, as very sane. This is an area where sanity counts. There’s no points gained for being fanatical or maniacal. This isn’t an area where you have to push the process. The process can push you harder and faster than you may wish. Once you get to this place—on what we might metaphorically call your spiritual quest—once you get to the place where you hear about psychedelics, the issue is no longer, then, about where is the gas pedal in the spiritual vehicle, the issue suddenly becomes: where is the brake? Because this is the fuel to go where you want to go. This is the power to lift you where you want to be lifted. Those issues are somehow now overcome. It becomes a very different game now, a much subtler game. The doorway stands open, and all it requires is courage—which is not to say it doesn’t require a lot. It does require a lot. But what it is is courage. You know, very few people go to the ashram for their daily meditation with their knees knocking in terror over what is about to sweep over them. They are pretty confident that they’ve got it confined and nailed down. It isn’t so with this. I mean, I’ve done it many times, there are many people here who’ve done it many times, and the survivors are not confident. It doesn’t build hubris in you. It doesn’t promote bravado. Because you know how quickly and how horrifyingly it can cut you down to size if you presume it, or if you presume you understand it, or if you presume to use it.\n\nSo sometimes the issue of magic and power comes up. I wouldn’t get near that. My goal is to see more, to understand more. And what I do on a trip is damn near absolutely nothing. You know? I have two or three J’s rolled in front of me. If I can get through them in the course of the evening, all goals have been met. To see, to understand, to remember. It’s an incredible statement about our humanness—it’s a double-edge statement about our humanness—that within us, under the influence of these plants, we have literally Niagaras of alien beauty. I mean, I, when I go to Manhattan, I go to the Met and the Guggenheim, and I haunt the galleries of SoHo. When I take mushrooms, I see more art in twenty minutes of behind-the-eyelids hallucination in total darkness than the human race seems to have produced in the last thousand years. Well, so on one level, that’s an incredible statement about the human capacity to generate and be in the presence of beauty. But the paradox is that so few people know this. That our ordinary styles of beings, our ordinary relationships to plants, our main-brand religions almost never carry us into the sense of this potential for beauty.\n\nAnd when I was young—you know, in my early twenties, wandering around India, trying to sort all of this out, having taken some psychedelics, but reading yogic texts and Mahayana texts and all this—I discovered in every culture there is what I call wise-old-man wisdom, or wise-old-woman wisdom. You know, in every culture, at evening, you see sitting on porches men smoking pipes, old men, and these guys know something. They know something about life: how to till the soil, how to raise a family, how to, you know, shepherd children through their marriages, and so forth and so on. But what I did not find in these cultures was any knowledge of this gratuitous grace. This is like a secret of some sort. And it’s a true secret, in that telling it does not give it away. I know this because I’ve been trying to tell the secret for 25 years to anyone who would listen, as you listen tonight. And I don’t know how many people, here, at what level, hear me.\n\nAnd there are many problems. First of all, there’s the problem of dose. It’s a physical problem. You can take a little of a psychedelic substance, or an effective dose, or a lot, or too much, and medically not be in any particular danger. The LD50 of these substances is such—let’s take psilocybin as an example. Psilocybin is effective at 15 milligrams for 145-pound person. But the LD50, the lethal dose, is something like 110 milligrams per kilogram of body weight. In other words: hundreds of times more than a dose that you would swear you were melting down, you were becoming the Earth, you would never live to tell the tale, and actually you’re in no medical danger at all. So people have experiences of different dose levels. I’ve always been interested in what the literature describes as effective doses. What this means is that you’re so loaded that a guy standing there with a clipboard looking at you is completely convinced you’re totally loaded. You know, all pretense dissolves. At these higher doses, the machinery of phenomenological description begins to come to pieces on you.\n\nAnd in my experience—someone mentioned the difference between mystical experiences and psychedelics—there are enormous similarities and enormous differences. If you study the mystical literature of Hinduism, Christianity, Buddhism, it all triangulates toward unitary states: the Bodhi mind, the white light, the ineffable, the unnameable, the irradiance. Vocabularies like this, which indicate some kind of homogeneity. Well, in my experience—though, when you push LSD there is something somewhat like that, LSD is not my idea of the paradigmatic hallucinogen. It’s different in many ways. Psilocybin is more the paradigmatic hallucinogen. And when you push it there seems to be not this merging into the radiance, but a revelation of multiplicity, of detail, of complexification within complexification. Everything gives way to everything else. Everything is interconnected to everything else. But the impression is one of an overwhelmingly bewildering profusion of phenomena.\n\nAnd, you know, I’ve discussed this with lamas and these sorts of people, and they say, “Well, you’re in the realm of saṃsāra. You’re in the realm of the multiplistic.” Perhaps, but the sense of a hierarchy of judgment doesn’t feel right. Somehow, this all-and-everything, this teeming multiplistic universe that is revealed, seems to carry a message of ecstatic and transcendental import. It’s all and everything, in Gurdjieff’s phrase. And one of the ideas that I want to explore with you in the course of the weekend is, you know, most discussions of psychedelics orbit around: what will it be like when I take it? Well, that’s very interesting and, of course, important to the individual. But to me an equally interesting question is: what has been the impact of this experience on the evolution of human beings over hundreds of thousands of years? In other words: what is it that we share with this planet? A kind of co-evolution not only with another order of being, which it certainly is, but the great confounding fact that I’ve brought back from my excursions into these places is that there is an organized intelligence in there, out there, over there—far more alien than the cheerful pro bono proctologists that haunt the trailer courts of the less fortunate. A truly alien presence, not interested in our gross industrial output or in imparting salutary technology upon us.\n\nWell then, what does it mean that our culture has sealed us off from this information? I mean, our culture claims under the aegis of science to bring us news of quasars chiliocosms of time and space away, news of the activities of the nucleus of the cell at the heart of the atom—and yet here’s a world that begins right behind your eyebrows that any mention of it either brings talk of mental pathology or how you’ve transgressed certain laws of the village. In other words, this culture has reared the edifice of empirical understanding and modern science and existential philosophy—this edifice has all been put in place in complete ignorance and denial of a fact of experience that is approximately as easy to access as orgasm. I mean, by different means, but nevertheless not far away. And yet, we in the West have navigated for 1,500–2,000 years with this, simply an easily repressed rumor.\n\nHow did we get into this situation? In other words: if there was a primordial era of shamanism and plant symbiosis and a mediated relationship with nature through the Gaian intelligence, how did we fall, then, into the domain of post-Renaissance, post-Medieval, post-Industrial culture? And then, what is the implication for the future of in this dark hour of complete overcommitment to technology, economic solutions, rational reductionism, materialism, so forth and so on? In the darkest hour of our commitment to these things, this news arrives from these repressed aboriginal people that we have marginalized and humiliated in the process of building our own version of a global culture.\n\nWell, obviously I’m not going try to answer these questions tonight, but this, to my mind—you know, in the eleventh century, when Islam swept across Asia minor, in Isfahan in Iran they built these immense mosques with mosaiced, vaulted roofs. And one of the great historians of Islam said of the city of Isfahan in the tenth century, he said, “It is half the world.” A single city, half the world. In a way, psychedelics are half the world. And yet, how few people have ever visited these sights, have ever stared into these particular vistas of beauty? And as was said in going around the circle, the impact of these psychedelics, where they hit us hardest, is in the domain of visionary imagining and the effort to communicate about our visionary imaginings. In other words, where they hit us hardest is in the domain of art and invention and novelty. And we have built a culture that, however hostile it may be to the psychedelic experience, it is incredibly friendly toward novelty, innovation, creativity, cultural evolution, celebration of difference, so forth and so on.\n\nSo I would like to believe that the long prodigal journey of Western humanity to a well nigh perfect understanding of the nature of matter and energy and space and time, that that prodigal journey can only be redeemed and made meaningful if the things learned in the shamanic descent into history—which it is a shamanic descent. I mean, we have achieved what the alchemists only dreamed of. And we’ve achieved it, strangely enough, by abandoning their illusions. They were epistemologically naïve. You do not discover fusion by endlessly rarefying mercury. You do not disentangle DNA by heating chemical vessels in horse dung. We had to abandon the naïveté of alchemy to achieve its goals, which were mastery of space and time, control of human longevity and health and psychological well-being.\n\nWell, at the center of the alchemical ideal was the idea of the stone: something part mineral, part mental, part spiritual, something drawn out of nature but perfected by human artifice, and then reflecting back upon man a perfect world created through magic. This is the faith of the Renaissance magi: Marsilio Ficino and Campanella and these people. It’s a different idea than the idea of man as a fallen creature, or science’s notion of man as a mute witness to a meaningless universe. The magical ideal that these things fertilize and support is the idea that humanity is somehow the co-partner, a full partner, in creation, and that what God has brought into being the human imagination can perfect. And it’s a necessary faith for our time, because the power that we have is so great.\n\nIf the power that science has given us does not serve a transcendental ideal, then it will serve some kind of fascist ideal. And most people will be reduced to equations and parts of a machine that does not serve the human individual or the human community. Psychedelics are a catalyst for the imagination. They raised the ante in the historical poker game. They show that there is more than one way to skin a cat. And we have come to a place of bifurcations, immense choices. The decisions and the processes that are put in place in the next twenty years will probably put the stamp on whether humanity and this planet are made or broken as a cosmic concern. Well, consciousness is the key. What is dragging our boat is an absence of consciousness. You know, we have one foot in angelhood and one foot in the identity of a carnivorous ape. And the tension between these two, on a global scale, is excruciating.\n\nSo if psychedelics, if there is one chance in a thousand that they contribute an increased measure of consciousness to this situation, then they are a precious gift, a resource, an option, a possibility to be explored. I don’t advocate these things because I think it’s a sure thing or a safe path to the eschaton, I advocate them because they’re the only game in town. You know, if hortatory preaching could’ve done the trick, then the Sermon on the Mount would’ve been the turning of the corner. But we have Buddha, we have Christ, we have these examples of enormously insightful spiritual beings who have delivered their message, and humanity has continued to flop on the seamy side. So it’s not about an idea. An idea is not sufficient to transform us. It’s about an experience. And this is the only experience I know that, in the time given to us, on the scale given to us, we have a hope of actually cutting through the detritus of our historical experience and building a true human community.\n\nWell, that’s all I really want to say this evening. I’ve gone over my time. Thanks for being so patient. All of these issues and many more will be reprised in the course of this weekend. Get a good night’s sleep and do not attempt to detain me in my attempt to do the same!\n\nSession 2\n\nSaturday Morning\n\nAugust 1, 1998\n\nOn days this nice my parents used to make me go outdoors! I had no excuse anymore for staying in. No, actually I vacillated. I spent a lot of time on my stomach on the couch, reading, and then a lot of time scrambling around in the nearby semi-arid wilderness looking for fossils, and later collecting butterflies, and then after that building and launching rockets—Freud notwithstanding—and it was lots of fun. But there was certainly lots of fun inside books.\n\nSo last night was sort of a first pass at all of this, and there were questions left unanswered, and threads untied, and now you’ve had a certain amount of time to absorb all that before I launch into some rap of my own. Is there anything anybody wants to carry forward? Yeah?\n\nI realized last night that I didn’t mention that I had an interest in the I Ching, and I don’t think anyone else had really mentioned it either. But your work, and others’, trying to tie that to other systems of order—DNA, [???]stuff—it’s all so difficult to understand.\n\nYeah, several people last night mentioned novelty theory. But you’re right, the I Ching itself wasn’t mentioned—which we could do. And I have done five-day workshops on nothing but the I Ching, especially its mathematical deconstruction. So we’ll talk about all of this probably this morning, if I feel like it. Novelty, order in nature—since we’re talking around it and through it, I might as well just do it.\n\nWhat does it have to do with psychedelics and all that? Well, the bridge of connections—there are many. But for purposes of discussion, these psychedelic experiences, in my opinion, when correctly managed, end up giving you a big idea. That’s a really successful psychedelic experience—is not where you simply have observed this bewildering other dimension, and try to come to terms with it, and then come out, and then live in the light of it because it’s made the universe so much bigger—but following like a shamanic model of a journey to obtain a gift or to recover a lost jewel. This is the shamanic motif: it’s always one of loss and recovery.\n\nThese flights into this realm of the lógos—the real stamp of authenticity on them comes when you bring back a new idea; something brand new. That proves that you’re not just talking to yourself. And so I knew this, and aspired to a new idea—whatever that might be, but I had no notion of what it was. And my problem as an intellectual throughout my entire life has been: it’s hard for me to depth with anything. You know, I study Roman history for a year, I study German for a year, I study the Maya for a year, but I never could get that professional mania that leads you into becoming a real academic in a specialized sense.\n\nSo this download for a big idea—somehow these psychedelic experiences set you up for it. They’re not the only way, but they’re the only way where you have some managerial control. The other methods all seem to be driven from the unconscious. For instance, if you read Thomas Kuhn’s book The Structure of Scientific Revolutions, you discover there that these huge rational idea systems were downloaded in very shady and shaky mystical ways. The classic example that I always give (because it’s so much fun, basically) is that René Descartes’s invention of scientific materialism was at the behest of an angel. An angel appeared to him in a dream. He records it in his diary. And the angel says: “The conquest of nature is achieved through measurement and number.” You know? And he awakens the founder of French empiricism, materialism, and derivatively this whole branch of modern science—at the behest of an angel in this occult drive to understand nature.\n\nThis is the amazing thing that the Greeks unleashed, this idea that we can not only mythologize the world, but that there is another way of looking at it: we can understand it. And, you know, they started out simply: what is air? What is fire? What is earth? And after 2,500 years of this we are now… we’ve pretty much figured out what the standard moves are. You know, the history of Chinese philosophy and the history of Western philosophy are the same schools by different names. You know, you get atomic materialists, you get spiritualists, you get what’s called occasionalism, you get all the possible adumbrations of a mind’s position in relationship to being in the search for these ideas.\n\nWell, my idea—which came to me… I don’t say I channeled it, because I find that vocabulary infantile and obnoxious. But, on the other hand, I don’t take credit for it in the way that I don’t feel elevated by my genius for having done this. It was definitely unfolded for me at a conversational speed by an intelligence for which I was little more than the secretary. And the idea is this—and I’ll start with the outlines and then move into the details. First of all, that two facts about nature have been overlooked by science, and that these facts are so overwhelmingly obvious once you begin to talk about them that ordinary people like you and I, by talking about them, can actually satisfy ourselves that these two related aspects of nature have been overlooked or not properly weighted in philosophical discourse. And here’s what they are.\n\nThe first one is: as you go back in time from the present moment, the universe becomes a simpler place. This is a huge generalization, and it’s true. And let’s state it, now, a slightly different way: let’s imagine we’re at the moment of the Big Bang or the moment when the universe flashed into existence 15 billion (or however many billion) years ago. It was a very simple thing. In the first nanoseconds of its existence it was some kind of integrated plenum. It was smaller than the diameter of a proton. All particularity was co-extensive in this tiny area. And then it began to expand. But for many milliseconds it was a pure electron plasma. There was only a certain kind of physics, only the physics of pure electrons. The universe had to cool over minutes and millennia for atomic systems to form so that electrons could actually go into orbit around the atomic core and not be overcome by the greater dissipative power of high thermal radiation. So until the universe cooled below a certain point, atomic systems, as it were, couldn’t crystallize out. And then they did. And at that moment a whole new set of phenomena in nature emerged—in David Bohm’s phrase: emergent phenomena. There had been only a universe of pure electrons, suddenly there was a universe of hydrogen and helium atoms. Much more complex… organisms, if you wish.\n\nWell, so then the whole story of the universe is a story of progressive complexification accompanied by this phenomenon of cooling. And the universe of hydrogen and helium atoms, under the influence of gravity, these things were aggregated into huge masses where pressure rose at the center of these masses from the weight of the stuff above. And at a certain point the curve of pressure passed through a point where a new phenomenon—hidden in the structure of being, but previously not by any phenomenon proclaimed—emerged. A new phenomenon: fusion. The stars began to burn.\n\nAnd this process of nuclear burning, this nuclear chemistry, created heavier elements. Instead of a universe of hydrogen and helium, suddenly you have a universe which contains sulfur and iron—and for us, for our story: carbon. And at that point it’s like the rest was inevitable. The rest is just filling in the blanks, drawing the dots. I mean, it takes 14 billion years, but with carbon present in the universe this force (which I identify and call novelty) could begin the long march forward toward this teleological ideal; this purpose which beckons at the end of time. What makes this idea radical—one of the things which makes it radical—is that it doesn’t simply assume that history and becoming is the unfolding of causal necessity, it assumes instead that there’s some kind of an attractor; that events are not just bubbling forward probablistically and randomly, but that they’re actually caught in some kind of field that is pulling everything toward a conclusion.\n\nSo I’m making this more complicated than it needs to be. The basic perception is: the universe has grown more complex as we approach the present. Now, this is a huge law if true, because it’s a statement about physical matter, it’s a statement about organic organization, it’s a statement about culture and society, it’s a statement about your own psychology. Things complexify through time. But science has never said this. It’s not even—I mean, the theory of evolution says biological systems grow more adaptive through time, but there’s been a real phobia against any teleologial implication from that. But this is a general rule which I submit to you. You, by investigating the nature of things on your own, can completely satisfy yourself that this is true.\n\nWell, when you start thinking that way—that it begins to look like nature on all scales is some kind of an engine which produces complexity and then conserves it, and uses it as a platform to proceed deeper into complexity; it’s a kind of anti-thermodynamic flow, it’s a dissipative… it’s what’s called autopoiesis by one school. So this tendency has been completely overlooked by science. In fact, science’s most secure statement is Maxwell’s second law of thermodynamics, which says all systems tend to disorder over time. But what it means is closed systems: all closed systems tend to disorder over time. Well, biology is some kind of a loophole in the laws of physics and chemistry, because what’s happening in biology is: complex materials are trapped inside membrane, and energy is extracted from these materials. And so a chemical process which would ordinarily ride down into entropy and obey the second law of thermodynamics actually is trapped in a kind of basin of attraction far from equilibrium.\n\nAnd physical chemists look at this and say, “Well, but it’s ephemeral. It just happens on the surface of the Earth, and it’s very fragile, and death is everywhere.” It’s a fluke, basically, is what they’re saying. But this is just their professional bias. Because you can go into the rocks of this planet and discover life and a continuous fossil record 4.83 billion years deep. The stars that you see when you look out at the Milky Way at night—the average star lasts 500 million years. So we just happen to be in orbit around a very stable, slow-burning type of star. But, in fact, life on this planet has already proven that it is more tenacious than the stars themselves by five times. So you can’t discount biology. Biology is clearly a player on a cosmic scale in this universal game of capturing energy and resisting entropy.\n\nSo novelty theory says that this general law—that nature conserves complexity—reaches its culmination or its most interesting intersection of discursiveness in ourselves. That we, then, look different to ourselves by this theory because we are the most novel phenomenon around. So, suddenly—what positivist materialism teaches about man’s place in nature is that we’re lucky to be here, it’s a cosmic accident, purpose is conferred, it’s just totally existential, you’re on your own, make it up, don’t make it up, who cares, doesn’t matter anyway kind of modernism. If, in fact, we have identified nature’s purpose as to create and conserve complexity, then suddenly we are returned (for the first time since the sixteenth century) to the center of the cosmic stage of the universal drama of salvation and redemption. Isn’t that weird? I think so.\n\nYeah?\n\nI was thinking about making that shift to considering the human experience as kind of central to our understanding of the planet. And then it seems to me environmental movements that are Earth-first, that place a large emphasis on [???] ecosystems and other animals, plants, as on the same level as us—it’s kind of a dichotomy [???] so many movements trying to save the planet [???] not even be here, and that is a way to [???] factors in place to save the planet. Whereas, this stuff arguably says that we need to realize how special we are and what’s going on up here to be able to rebalance things. And it’s kind of a strange line to walk between valuing ourselves, but not over-valuing ourselves. Can you see that?\n\nNo, I agree. It’s very tricky. There’s almost like a bifurcation where it’s hard to see how you can have the cake and eat it, too. There is the concept of the forward escape, which I’m tending more and more to believe in. But it’s a desperate strategy from a military point of view—the forward escape. And forward escape is where you realize the only way out is right up the center. And then you have to get traction and go right up the center. What’s happening is that so much power is being given to man (or taken by man) from the universe through the power of scientific understanding that we are becoming the masters of the planetary destiny whether we want to be or not. And you’re right: the choice seems to be between some kind of primitivism (an archaic revival that abandons technology and tries to redial the last sane moment we ever knew) or some kind of gnostic rejection of the world of nature and matter and a complete commitment to machine symbiosis and a cosmic destiny and, you know, life extension, starflight, cloning, the whole mega trip. And, of course, it’s not going to be one or the other, it’s going to be both and. There’s going to be a spectrum of possibility.\n\nHow the actual details of—like, how do you go to the stars and save the Earth, I don’t propose to discuss or to really know. I do think—you know, the French sociologist Jacques Ellul once said: “There are no political solutions, there are only technological ones. The rest is propaganda.” And he wrote a whole book in which he defined these terms, “political solutions,” “propaganda,” “technical solutions.” And I tend to think that’s true. What we have to deal with in this millennial narrow neck of constricted possibility, where it still feels as though the human race could skid off into the ditch, is: we have to deal with the fact that we have built institutions that do not serve human purposes, but that are like automata or golems among us—corporations, religions, cabals, ethnic tribalism. And these things are like the psychotic architectonics of the unconscious that the information age is causing to suddenly emerge for the inspection of those who have eyes to see. So our humanness is not endangered by our machines, it’s endangered by these institutional entities.\n\nAnd the most spectacular and obvious example, of course—without getting into the whole thing—is corporate capitalism, simply because corporate capitalism has the intelligence of a termite at the organismic level, and all it understands is its agenda. And its agenda is to take cheaply extracted raw materials and fabricate them into expensive finished products which are sold to well-heeled markets in the high-tech industrial democracies. And it can’t propagate that cycle on the closed surface of this planet much longer without the contradictions becoming unbearable. But it doesn’t know that, you know? It has a very low-grade intelligence. So how we communicate—we’re all ready to switch on a dime to the new paradigm if we can just figure it out. The problem is to switch these enormous dinosaur-like institutions in which we have invested our lives and our economies and our scientific research establishments and our civil hierarchy, and so forth.\n\nThe way I think of it is: I think that Maxwell’s laws of thermodynamics are only part of the story, and that you also have to look at the work that Ilya Prigogine did in the 1960s and 1970s, where he showed that there is this principle—which they call different things, but basically it was random perturbation to higher states of order, and that this occurred in systems of all levels of complexity. That, actually, sometimes, systems spontaneously organize themselves into more complex forms.\n\nSo in the entropic state that you’re talking about (which resembles a Bernoulli model of dissipation of the particles of gas), the opposite end of the spectrum would be this notion that all points in the matrix become cotangent, which requires a higher dimension that is still trivial. And that’s what I think it is. I think that biology… like, this process which we’ve called novelty or complexification (that we say is increasing through time; starts simple, ends complicated), one way of talking about is to think of it as languages in conquest of dimensional expression. Or: something is seeking to manifest itself in a domain of time and space of higher and higher dimension.\n\nBecause if you go back to the earliest biological emergence, they’re like fixed slime, these early life forms. They’re essentially points. They don’t move through space, they have no eyes, they have no organs of perception, they are simply points of being. Well, then, still later in the process they break free from their stationary points and they become motile. But they still have no perception. They’re just groping now. Now they’re groping specks of being. And they’ve gone from being points to the equivalent of lines. Well then, finally, light-sensitive chemistry sequesters itself in the membrane and these things begin to have a notion of a gradient: that the action is where the light is, that the food is where the light is. And so then this generates the concept “here” and “there,” which is a time-bound concept. Suddenly, time springs into being. There is the notion of the execution of will over time. Well, then the rest of the story of the evolution of animal life, right up to 50,000 years ago, is simply the story of better eyes, better muscles, better coordination, better ability to move through this revealed topological manifold with a temporal axis.\n\nBut then, with the advent of spoken language—what spoken language is about is the recovery of memory at a later date. It’s a data-recall system. And then you talk about the past. And you not only talk about it, but you strategize from it. Hunting strategies, erotic fantasy, mate-getting strategies. When you get to writing, this time-binding function is now totally explicit. The game is out in the open. The purpose of these behaviors is to keep the past from slipping away. And so we write down king lists and dynastic histories and this sort of thing. Well, from this point of view that I’m pushing here for a moment that evolution is the conquest of dimensionality, you can see, then, that the primate conquest of time through time-binding technology is the phenomenon that we call human history. This is apparently what we’re about. This is why we speak, why we write, why we invent phonetic alphabets and mathematical notation. Because we are binding time.\n\nWell, you can then propagate that process forward to say: well, then what would satisfy this drive? Well, nothing less than a complete conquest of time itself. In the same way that, as we look back in the history of biology, we see these other dimensional barriers were crossed: from stationary, from in-situ existence, to motility, to a sense of light, to coordination of three-dimensional space, now coordination of fourth-dimensional space. And to make this leap to the full coordination of 4D it requires some kind of machine symbiosis, it requires prostheses, it requires that we redesign and extend our nervous system over the entire planet, and that we undergo some kind of metamorphosis and become (instead of semi-cannibalistic primates) machine-tenders of global nervous system, some of which is gold and copper and glass and some of which is flesh and DNA and neurons. And so this whole thing is in a state of self-designing foment.\n\nAnd that, you know—I don’t know how we got here, but it leads me to the second point I wanted to make earlier when I was talking about novelty. I said there were two things which science had overlooked, and then I discussed the first one, which is that nature is a novelty-producing and -conserving engine. The second thing that science has overlooked and culture has overlooked is related to the first, and it’s this: it’s that this process of producing novelty that the universe is about is not going on at a steady rate. It’s going on faster and faster as we approach the present. It’s like what mathematicians call a cascade. It began slowly and has moved with greater and greater acceleration from the very first moments of its existence. So the early history of the universe is dullsville, it’s slow-moving. I mean, stars are condensing, galaxies are ordering themselves. This is the stuff of millennia, of tens of millennia, of greater spans of time. Once you get down to the last 500 million years—on this planet—biology is the main show. Geology and astrophysics have receded into the background, and where the action, the mutation, the change, the shift is happening is on the surface of planets in interface with atmospheres and cosmic environments and asteroidal impacts and melts and all these various things that went on. There is a period for life before that; a long, long period: the Archaeozoic. But talk about dullsville! I mean, there’s nothing going on there.\n\nWell then, when you reach the last million years, it’s as though this process of the emergence of novelty both concentrates itself in nature into a single line—the hominids—but it also intensifies itself by orders of magnitude. So change is then happening on a scale of hundreds of years. You know: languages are changing, pottery designs. And as we approach the present this becomes more and more furious. And so what novelty theory is saying is: this is not an easily explained phenomenon. It’s not simply a natural consequence of our being in the world. That’s looking at it backwards. Somehow, our being in the world means that the world process is approaching some kind of definitive cusp in its development. In other words, that human history is the shockwave of some greater event about to emerge out of the order of nature. That human history (25,000 years is all it is) is like a shimmer, an aura, something which flashes across animal nature in the geological millisecond before the thing goes cosmic, or whatever it is that it’s going to go.\n\nAnd so, for us, human history has this enormous dramatic impact, because our lives last 70 or 80 years if we’re lucky. I mean, we’re as ephemeral as mayflies. For us, human history is 1,500 generations. But in terms of the species it’s a fever, it’s a moment that has come upon us. And now we’re deep, deep, deep into it—and deep enough into it, I think, that we can begin to actually talk about what lies at the other side.\n\nAnd our religions have become almost the architectures of our social hopes. And this coincidence of calendrical synchronism that we’re undergoing—and what I mean by that is that the Mayan civilization fixated on the heliacal rising of the winter solstice sun and the galactic center (an event which occurs only once every 26,000 years) occurs in 2012. They fixated on this. And our calendar—you know, reformed by papal rationalists in the fifteenth century and originally founded by a Roman dictator—misses the same 26,000 node with a millennial date by only twelve years. So, you know, that’s 0.001% on a scale of 10,000 years. So, for all practical purposes, these two calendars both reach very important culmination dates very near to each other in eternity, if you think about how much time that is.\n\nSo what does this mean? Well, if you’re a Jungian, or believe in the greater larger dynamics of the unconscious, it means that on the wheel of cosmic time, somehow the appointment of the end of a world year has arrived. Why is it keyed to the galactic center? I wouldn’t at this point care to speculate. I could be dragged into it, but it’s probably not the best way to spend our time. But the point is that this phenomenon of novelty-conservation—which has been going on for a very long time, throughout the whole life of the universe—is now happening so rapidly that it’s down into the scales of time where it’s discernible in a human lifetime. In fact, less than a human lifetime. Now change defines everything, even for such microbes as ourselves. Where before we were embedded, as it were, in the much more slow-moving processes of climate change and glaciation advance and retraction and that sort of thing, now we make our own time.\n\nAnd we even talk about downloading ourselves into machines. Well, as we sit here, we’re functioning at about 100 hertz; about 100 cycles a second. If you were downloaded into even today’s desktop computer, you’d be running at 200 megahertz. Suddenly, 2012 would appear as far away in time as the bust-up of Pangaea is in the other direction, because you would’ve stretched time. All time is is how much you can jam into a moment. It’s very easy to suppose that we’re on the brink of a weird kind of pseudo-immortality where time spent in circuitry is essentially time spent in eternity, and people will choose toward the close of their lives to migrate into the virtual realms where the laws of physics are replaced by the laws of the programmer’s imagination. You really, then, are entering into your own private Idaho, so to speak.\n\nTeilhard de Chardin—for those of you who don’t know his work—was a Jesuit paleontologist and primatologist who wrote in the 1950s. The Omega Point, The Phenomenon of Man. And, in a way, nothing I say or little that anybody has said about cyberspace, about the meltdown of humanity into some electronic collectivity, has been surpassed by Teilhard de Chardin. He had this idea that human beings were on this Earth, and that they would generate what he called the noösphere. And the noösphere was simply the atmosphere of electronic and radar and radio and telegraphic and television signals which surround the Earth. That we would build a new atmosphere, as it were; a technosphere of information.\n\nAnd information is a very key concept in all of this. What I call novelty you could arguably call information. What I call habit you cold arguably call noise. And this is a vision of being where there is a struggle between these two antithetical forces. One described by the second law of thermodynamics (entropy), the other described by novelty theory, Ilya Prigogine’s nonequilibrium thermodynamics, et cetera, et cetera, and they are in every situation locked in struggle. The amount of order and disorder in any situation is dictated by the unique configuration of the local struggle between these two forces, if you want to put it that way.\n\nBut the good news is: it’s not a Manichean thing. It doesn’t go on forever. These two forces are not quite equally pitted. Over time, novelty wins. Order wins. Order triumphs over disorder and builds higher states of order. So, in a way, you could think of the whole process as what engineers call a damped oscillation. That habit is this oscillation in a space of perfection, and it is eventually damped by the surrounding telos toward concrescence. A lot of the words I use to talk about this are taken out of Alfred North Whitehead, who’s, to my mind, the great unread philosopher of the twentieth century. And he wrote a book called Process and Reality in which he tries to build a general vocabulary for talking about being, and it comes off as very psychedelic and very chaotic dynamical kind of anticipation. Check out Whitehead.\n\nThe thing which has made novelty theory difficult to sell (in terms of the ugly knobs and warts on it as a theory) were that it has this built-in crazy assumption, which is that in the very short term (meaning the next 15 or 20 years) the world will in part completely transform itself. And so it’s in a category with apocalyptarian thinking, millennarian thinking, miraculous thinking, deus ex machinas, squirrely revelations, all of that—all of which I abhor, but you can’t escape the mathematical implications once you draw the curve of the asymptotic acceleration into novelty. There’s a group of people—you can read their stuff on the Internet—they’re called extropians, or singularists—and they are very hard-headed engineering types. Libertarian geeks, not psychedelic, not spiritual in any sense of the word. And they propagate out curves such as the human population curve, the curve of information, number of papers being published, the curve of the amount of energy being released, so forth and so on. All these curves reach infinity somewhere before 2025.\n\nWhat does it mean to say these curves reach infinity? Nobody knows. It’s a singularity. It doesn’t make sense. It’s a mathematical contradiction. What it means is: your model is broken. What is going to happen has so many dimensions embedded in it that your simple propagations of curves method of of analyzing it are giving you crazy data that makes no sense. And I’m—being semi-unemployed—I have the leisure to spend many hours a day reading journals and surfing the net and so forth, and I’m telling you: all these esoteric fields of knowledge, all these solid state physics, quantum encryption, drug-design, genetic engineering, long-base interferometry—on and on and on; these cabals of secret societies—in each case they’re reaching out for the ultimate pieces of knowledge in their field. And no one is coordinating the implications of all this across the face of the rising tidal wave of understanding.\n\nWhat really is happening is that—and a very… I wouldn’t say complete control of the world of matter and energy is coming into being, but a leap forward is being taken, and all under the aegis of this key concept of information. Information is more primary than time and space, more primary than light and electromagnetism. Information is the stuff of being. It’s all you will ever know, it’s all you can ever know. The rest are ghostly hypotheses to explain the behavior and the presence of information. And it’s almost as though it has a syntactical life of its own. It’s almost as though it’s a virtual life form of some sort that is running on a primate platform.\n\nI read a very interesting thing by Danny Hillis, who wrote The Connection Machine. He was talking about songs, and he said primitive human beings—especially young juveniles—like to imitate each other and make strange noises. And some strange noises are easier to make than others, and so you begin to have a population of short bursts of strange noise. And these populations—we’ll call them “songs,” just to make it easy: short bursts of strange noise—and some of these songs are easy to remember and some are not, and that’s the environment of selection. So the easy to remember songs survive and the hard to remember songs go extinct. And there’s only a limited number of human beings to sing the songs, so the songs must also compete for this resource, which is the human singer. And to this point the human beings have been like a the host of a parasite. These songs have conferred no adaptive good at all to the human being. But when the songs begin to aggregate around repetitious behavior (because that’s where there’s a high likelihood of survival, because that’s where there’s a high likelihood of repetition), then you begin to have a syntactical net. And I think that, in a sense, this is our situation: that we were early parasitized by a kind of virtual life form that lives only in syntax and is essentially time-sharing and piggybacking our nervous system. But at some point we insisted around it somewhat the way a cell membrane trapped early bacteria and turned them into mitochondria. So now we can think with this linguistic symbiote that shares our brain space.\n\nHowever, it’s very interesting, this idea. I mean, this may seem trivial to you, but it’s new to me, so I’m into it. I read this book by George Dyson called Darwin Among the Machines, and I highly recommend this book. This is a great book; fun book. Darwin Among the Machines. And one of the points that he makes in there that I had sort of—I mean, when you heart it you say, “Yeah, I always sort of new that”—but I had never quite grokked it in its full implications. One of the points he makes in there is that when we talk to each other, when we make sense to each other, what we say can be perfectly made formulaic through symbolic logic. In other words, that the branch of mathematics called symbolic logic is capable of portraying human language and human logical processes perfectly. But the interesting thing is that this language, symbolic logic, is the language which machines speak with great fluency. This is the great bridge between us and the machines: that fundamentally we speak the same language. That “and” to a human being and “and” to a microprocessor mean the same thing. So there is no great barrier. It’s all conceptual between us and machine intelligence.\n\nMachine intelligence is the most likely form of alien intelligence to arrive and complicate our social dialogue because, in a sense, it’s already here. In a sense, we are putting a great deal of effort into creating it. And, in a sense, its emergence depends on the very same appetite for novelty that allowed us to squeeze ourselves out of the rules of molecular chemistry. And again, it’s happening at these very high megahertz rates. Machine evolution will not be like human evolution, because what it took us 50,000 years to achieve it can achieve potentially through distributed processing in minutes, hours. Hans Moravec says of artificial intelligence: we may never know what hit us, you know? It will simply be coming to be. And what would that look like? We have no idea—or its relationship to us at all.\n\nYeah?\n\nWould you say this is like a linguistic analog to the morphogenetic field [???] evolution?\n\nYeah, I hadn’t thought of it that way, but it’s like that. Novelty theory and Rupert’s theories of the morphogenetic field are very closely related. He doesn’t believe in a temporal attractor, he believes things are pushed by necessary casuistry. But the unfolding of the morphogenetic field and the unfolding of the time wave—you’re talking about the same thing. You’re talking about the four—you see, in a way, what science is all about is: it will tell you what is possible. If you want to know if something is possible, you ask the expert in that science. But what science can’t tell you, and what is what you usually really want to know, is: out of the class of the possible, what things will actually occur? And we have no theory for this, strangely enough. We have no theory for—I mean, I suppose somebody who was fundamentalist or some kind of Christian might say: “Well, God’s will. Out of the class of what is possible, what comes to be is God’s will.” Well, that would be one theory of what it is that winnows the actual from the possible. A scientist would say: preexisting conditions. In other words, somehow the circumstances into which any phenomenon is born skew it toward its ultimate developmental end state. I mean, it’s almost like the law of karma or something; that by the circumstances into which you find yourself, then you’re carried forward to some conclusion that was inevitable based on that.\n\nNovelty theory is not predestination. It doesn’t say that the future has happened. If you believe the future has happened, you have all kinds of philosophical problems on your hands. Because for truth (as concept) to have any meaning, you have to have error. If you think what you think because you can’t think anything else—which is what predestination is—well, then what does the search for truth and meaning look like in a cosmos like that? It’s meaningless. No, in a predestined cosmos you think what you think because that’s what you think and you can’t think anything else, and it doesn’t have anything to do with truth. So there must be at least that much freedom: freedom to err in the mind. But, of course, the mind (through the body) is an extension into the world.\n\nYou know, for all the huffing and puffing of modern science and neurophysiology, they still can’t tell you how you can think “I will close my hand” and close it. I mean, this is mind over matter. This is telekinesis. Science is just completely baffled as to how this can take place at all. It’s a fundamental miracle. Been good for 5,000 years. Still knocking ’em dead. And it’s by that trick—that we don’t understand how it’s done—that will and mind and intent enters the world, and cities get built, and armies sent marching, and religious revelations written down, and so forth and so on.\n\nBut I think that the—you see, for years I was, like, crying in the wilderness about this ramping up towards some kind of hyper-complex unravelment of the social machine in the very short term. But now I feel much more confident (than I was ten years ago) now, ten years closer to the end date, because the Internet looks to me like the backbone of the emergent thing. I mean, the Internet is a huge and not fully comprehended cultural step that we have now totally committed ourselves to. It’s nothing less than the building of a thinking nervous system the size of the entire planet. And we’re wedded to this thing. Our banking, military planning, corporate capitalization, long-term planning, design process, inventory control, resource extraction—everything is running on this strange companion that we built to be indestructible, because we built it at the height of the Cold War. And so, you know, it has no nodes of control, and it’s the most complex thing ever put in place on this planet since DNA cooked itself out of the primal ocean.\n\nYeah?\n\nAgain, somehow, are those people that had these experiences going to be spared a certain type of…?\n\nYeah, you put your finger on it. It’s that, to the degree that people are psychedelic, they will be less anxious about what will happen. Because what psychedelics show you is that there is life after history. There is something outside of culture. If you don’t know that by one means or another, then you will define what is happening as the end of the world—the literal apocalypse, the collapse of everything—when, in fact, that’s not what it is. It’s just the collapse of historical print-based cultural models and models of the self and the psyche. I embrace it. I mean, we’re not about to blow out here or go extinct, and we never escaped from the yoke of nature. Nature has taken some hits in this neighborhood. 65 million years ago, an object encountered the Earth that nothing larger than a chicken on the entire planet survived that encounter. And guess what it cleared the way for: the flowering plants (the source of all these compounds we’re so interested in) and the ascendancy of the mammalian order, our dear selves. We are here because of the most appalling bad hair day this planet ever endured. So, you know, when you start judging this stuff and saying what’s good, what’s bad, it’s very hard to say. Nature is incredibly profligate and will take enormous chances to preserve novelty, to keep the novelty game going. And so I feel that, in a sense, nature will open a way for us. Nature is interested in this process. We represent the greatest step in organizational realignment and redesign since life left the oceans.\n\nYeah?\n\nIt’s grace. You know, it’s the will of God that makes these more and more complex systems fall into place.\n\nThis relates to a question which was unanswered here this morning, which was about teleology. The Darwinian theory of evolution is very hostile to teleology. First of all, what is teleology? Teleology is the idea that the universe has a purpose. And Darwinian evolution is hostile to this because Darwinian evolution arose in nineteenth century England where the reigning intellectual paradigm was called deism. And deism is the idea that God made the universe like a clockmaker, and then he went away and left it going—in other words, the divine clockmaker. The universe was structured by a force which has now withdrawn from it. And Darwin and his circle were very clearly atheistic, and they wanted to see biology as requiring no purpose to direct it at all. And so they created the dual concept of random mutation and natural selection. Random mutation is just that, because of copying errors, radiation, drift, toxic material in the cellular environment, that the DNA messages degrade. So that’s mutation. Then [natural] selection is that this DNA is then subjected to the selective winnowing out that the environment lays against it. So by the meshing of these two processes—this is Darwinian theory—by the meshing of random mutation and natural selection, you get the slow incremental emergence of new forms, some of which confer advantage and some don’t. Most don’t, and they’re eliminated. Those that do stay in the system, and incrementally the system seeks to come to equilibrium with the selective forces that are operating on it.\n\nBut these selective forces—which are continent, incidental radiation from space, weather, climate change, so forth and so on—because these factors are themselves changing over time, mutating, the system can never come to equilibrium. And so for Darwinian evolution, evolution is what’s called a random walk. The system destabilizes, it corrects itself. It destabilizes, it corrects. Destabilizes, corrects. And after billions of years of this, lo and behold, you get animals like ourselves. But these nineteenth century evolutionists were keen to say: do not imagine that this is God’s purpose or that the final form was pre-figured in the original form. No. This just happened like this. Well, now we’ve had 150 years to absorb all this. In the meantime, Mendelian genetics, the particulate nature of the gene has been understood, the molecular nature of the gene has been understood. We can say some new things about this. Also, we are no longer under the spell of deism. That’s a crank idea that is nobody is that keen for. And so it’s a different intellectual world.\n\nWell now, when we look at nature we see a different picture. We see that, where Darwin said nature is all red in tooth and claw, we see that the way to be a successful species, the way to survive, is to make yourself indispensable to your neighbors. Then, instead of attempting to push you down and extinguish you, if you can cut deals with everybody in your neighborhood (providing various chemicals or energy supplies or other affects in the environment), then everybody will begin to pull your way. So, in fact, cooperation is what is maximized among species. And a huge complex organic system like a coral reef or a rainforest is actually attempting to come to an equilibrium of balance that is the point of greatest benefit for the greatest number of organisms and species in the system.\n\nWell, this is a whole different picture. And it opens the possibility—these new sciences like complexity theory, global dynamics, chaos theory—have made it now respectable to think about processes that are drawn by something in the future rather than pushed from behind. In the nineteenth century that was inconceivable. All that was known was the chain of cause and effect. But now we see that the temporal landscape has what are called basins of attraction in it, and that certain processes are actually drawn forward by their presumed end states. And so it seems less outlandish to us, I think, to suppose there is a purpose. And also, we see a level of global integration and global mutation that Darwin couldn’t’ve even dreamed of.\n\nYeah?\n\nWell, it’s somewhat like astrology, except astrology believes that planets and stars and the arrangements among them represent shifts in a kind of energy field. In a way, this is more abstract. Wang Bi—who was a medieval Chinese mystic—his thought comes eerily close to my own, in that the way he pictured this was that you have the sequence moving in an abstract dimension, but you have the sequence moving at a certain speed. And overlaying that is another sequence, moving at a different speed. And over that another version of the King Wen sequence, moving at another speed. And that a given moment is a slice through these levels that creates a unique juxtaposition of the levels. So it is in that sense very astrological, but it’s all calculated independent of any observation of nature.\n\nAlthough, if it’s true, then it’s interesting that there are correlations in the cycles in the King Wen sequence to astrological cycles—specifically, the system that I elaborated on one level contains a cycle of 384 days. That’s the number of lines (6 × 64) in a complete sequence of the I Ching. 384 days. Well, it happens to be 13 lunar cycles, exactly. Well then, if you take it times 64, you get a number—67 years, 0.10425 days—which is six sunspot cycles. Sunspot cycles also occur in 33-year cycles. Well, it’s known that the early Han Dynasty Chinese knew about sunspot cycles. They were the first people to observe them. So without hypothesizing super-technologies or any kind of Atlantis-type stuff, we see that the King Wen sequence could’ve been a kind of gear used in a system of multiplicands that predicted lunar cycles, sunspot cycles on two levels, and then, with one further multiplication, this precessional great year; this 26,300-year cycle. So it’s a neat kind of resonance calendar. And given the sorry state of Chinese calendar-making in historical time, it’s interesting that you ca derive a very accurate calendar from the I Ching—more accurate than the calendar we’re presently operating on. If you use a 384-day year length, the problem of course is that a year of that length would precess against the sun. But this may have been (for political or religious or philosophical reasons) acceptable at the time that calendar was formulated.\n\nMy fancy is that there was a calendrical war in the pre-Shang Dynasty time, a war between the solar materialists and the lunar mystics. And it was basically a war about how the calendar should be. Because, you know, the calendar is the largest frame of reality. For instance, our calendar with its fixed equinoctial points, is a lie. Our calendar promotes a belief in the permanence of eternity when, in fact, everything is slipping and sliding around.
