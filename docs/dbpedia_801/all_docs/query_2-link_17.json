        "text": "The device you see is called \"Newton's cradle\". An assembly consisting of 5 balls lined up in a row. For some reason, it's something we see mostly on desks in workplaces. I think those who put this on their table give a message that if I can handle these 5 balls, I can handle everyone. But could it have other meanings beyond that? What story do these tiny spheres tell us?\n\nNewton's Cradle\n\nThis mechanism takes its name from the famous physicist Isaac Newton. It would be good for him to invent such a thing, but he did not invent it. It wasn't even invented during his lifetime. It's not known exactly who first made this tool. But we know who named it, in 1967, an actor named Simon Prebble called it \"Newton's cradle.\"\n\nThis cradle primarily gives us information about the basic physical laws of the world we live in. When you lift the first ball into the air, a potential energy is loaded. When we let go, this potential energy turns into kinetic energy with the effect of gravity and it goes and touches the second ball. The momentum of the first ball is transferred to the second ball it touches. In this way, the momentum is transmitted to the other balls in turn and goes all the way to the last ball. The last ball rises as a result of momentum transfer and comes back again and touches the previous ball.\n\nThis is how we physically explained what was going on. Is that all? Can't this information reveal other meanings in our minds? For example, when I look at these spheres, I see a chain of movement and change. Just as we notice when we look around us. We see that things are constantly changing. These changes do not happen automatically. In order for this ball to change its position, another ball must first change its position. As I said, this is a chain of movement and change.\n\nIf we are not satisfied with our current situation; If we want to change ourselves, our lives and our environment, we must study the laws of physics from a different perspective. To take action, we must listen to the story of these tiny orbs.\n\nLet's take a look at Newton's laws of motion. Isaac Newton, better known as a physicist, published one of the most important scientific books in history in 1687: This book called “Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica” laid the foundation of classical mechanics. The book has a delightful name, but for some reason, most people focus on the second half of the title, the \"mathematical principles\" side. However, the full title of the book is \"Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy.\" Then let's try to read the meanings of natural philosophy starting from mathematical principles. Let's try to apply mathematics and physics to our own lives.\n\nEven the smallest object you see in the world does not want to change its position, its current state. It doesn't want to move. It is lazy. Put yourself in the place of “object” in this sentence. The object is you.\n\nObjects want to stay as they are. This is also the first of the laws of motion discovered by Newton. Even the smallest object in this universe does not move stagnantly. It maintains the state of inactivity. Until an external force acts on it. As soon as you apply this external force, it takes action and this time it tries to maintain its mobility. In theory, it would continue this motion indefinitely. For example, if you hit such an object in space, it will continue on its way without stopping. But things are different in the world. Here, as always, there are external forces. And somehow it stops it. Frictional force in the air or on the ground or other things hinder this mobility. In this way, we can better understand Newton's 1st law. Objects want to keep their existing positions and again objects want to continue doing what they did before, objects. Like I said, they are lazy. But thankfully, scientists were able to express this laziness more gently, and they called it \"inaction\".\n\nInaction is part of our life. It is not easy to take action. Taking the first step is always difficult. But once you take that step, things get easier. You gain momentum. You start to maintain this momentum. Tick tock, tick tock. You're almost in sync with time.\n\nDon't always wait for such an outside force to take action. This force that you need is always \"potentially\" within you. Do you now find that strength in the blood in your veins, in the folds of your brain that feeds it, or in your heart that pumps it? You decide this. After all, you have to lift that first ball into the air to turn the potential inside you into kinetic energy. So let's repeat the first law.\n\nNewton's first law: The law of inertia\n\n“Lex I: Corpus omne perseverare in statu suo quiescendi vel movendi uniformiter in directum, nisi quatenus a viribus impressis cogitur statum illum mutare.”\n\n“Law I: All bodies have uniform rectilinear motion unless forced to change their state by the action of a force.\n\nForce is very important. So, what else can we learn about this force from physics and mathematics? For this we will have to look at the second law. One of the most important formulas in the history of science...\n\nF = m.a.\n\nWe can read this formula as follows: “The acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the force applied on it and inversely proportional to the mass of the object.” Now who is the object in this sentence? We. Ourselves. If we want to accelerate, if we want to increase our existing speed, we will either decrease our mass, that is, we will weaken, or increase our strength.\n\nNewton's second law: It is known as the law of acceleration.\n\n“Lex II: Mutationem motus proportionalem esse vi motrici impressae, et fieri secundum lineam rectam qua vis illa imprimitur…”\n\n“Law II: The change in momentum of an object is proportional to the thrust exerted on the object and occurs along the straight line through which the thrust is applied.”\n\nWhether a force is applied all at once, or in gradual succession, if it produces motion, another force twice the magnitude of that force will double the motion, and a force three times the force will triple the motion. And this motion is summed up with the previous motion if the object was in motion before, in the same direction as the previous motion.\n\nNow let's apply what we learned from physics to our lives. In order to observe an accelerating change in our lives, we need to direct our will power to a goal and apply it continuously in that direction. Just doing something is not enough to get rid of inaction. Being fast alone is necessary but not sufficient to get us from one point to another. To accelerate, we need a direction. Hence a focused force.\n\nAnd when we direct all our strength and willpower towards a certain goal, unfortunately, the work does not end. There are obstacles before us. Reactions to the effect we have begun to create are beginning to emerge. Which brings us to Newton's third law:\n\nNewton's third law: action-reaction law\n\n“Lex III: Actioni contrariam semper et æqualem esse reactionem: sive corporum duorum actiones in se mutuo semper esse æquales et in partes contrarias dirigi.”\n\n“Law III: For every force there is always an equal and opposite reaction force: or the forces exerted by two bodies on each other are always of equal and opposite direction.”\n\nNewton's third law tells us that all forces interact with each other. So there is no such thing as a unidirectional force. When you start doing something by using the willpower within us, you will definitely create obstacles for yourself at first. The \"excuse engine\" inside you will start to work and say to you, \"You have no time\", \"You will fail again\", \"You are not talented anyway!\" Let's say you silenced them. This time, the reactions of the environment will begin. There's a role for you, after all. Why try to accelerate when you can move forward at a constant speed in that role? Is it you trying to make an impact with your willpower?\n\nWe already know that even if you hit a stone on the ground, it will exert an equal and opposite force on you. Then it is perfectly normal to encounter such reactions internally and externally. Even the opposite is against the nature of the business. If we accept this as such, wouldn't our will to increase our strength be strengthened?\n\nAs a body, we know that in order to act, we must first elevate ourselves. Despite gravity. Despite the resistance of the air. We can achieve this if we increase the strength of will within us. Again, as an object, we know that the potential energy within us emerges only in this way. Of course, there will be reactions. One person, two people or three can resist us. He may not want to move. But rest assured that the fourth person will act under your influence. And once you act, no one can stop you anymore."
