        "text": "By far the best Newton’s cradle I’ve seen. The first one I bought from another seller was plain black and barely bounced for 15 seconds. I wondered why these always came in such boring colors. I bought this one because of the holographic colors and must say that it’s very cool. I brought it to work and received compliments from many of my coworkers. It looks great on the windowsill in my office because the sunlight brings out the beautiful colors. Depending on the angle of light you get a different set of colors, which makes the cradle stand out from everything else. It’s really awesome.\n\nAssembly was a breeze. The bars are easy to fit, just make sure you push hard on them so the balls are in perfect alignment. The balls on my cradle bounce for over 60 seconds.\n\nMy nephews also loved the cradle so I’m planning to buy two more for them. Very happy customer.\n\nVery easy to assemble\n\nVery easy to assemble. I was pleasantly surprised with the packing. The box is well made and the design is very cool. The packing within the box that protects the cradle is great because avoids the strings to be tangled and having a mess. The colors of the base are beautiful when the sunlight hits the cradle. It literally looks just like the videos and reviews posted here. The base has for holes where you place the bars. You just need to push hard to get them fit perfectly. Later, I tested to see how long the balls bounce and I am not kidding when I say more than 60 seconds. I was very impressed by the quality of the balls, bars and the base. You can tell is high quality because the balls, bars, and base are heavy, not plastic like many others. In conclusion, great quality but most of all the colors are BEAUTIFUL\n\nInspiration\n\nBought it for my kid. She absolutely loves it and plays with it all the time. So far it is holding up to the near constant use. As far as I am concerned if it helps inspire young minds in science and math then it is worth more than what you paid for it."
