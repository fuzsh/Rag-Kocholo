        "text": "Novelty devices are fireworks that produce limited visible or audible effects and contain small amounts of pyrotechnic or explosive composition. Novelty devices include sparklers, party poppers and toy pistol caps. (Novelty devices are classified under the Explosives Regulations as Type F.5.)\n\nThe following guidance is for any retailer or distributor selling novelty devices. For situations not covered here, including exemptions and conditions, consult the Explosives Regulations.\n\nSelling novelty devices\n\nCustomers must be 16 or older to buy and use novelty devices.\n\nNovelty Devices are pyrotechnic devices and, for this reason, both their sale and purchase are covered by Canadaâ€™s laws for safe and secure use of these types of effects. The Explosives Regulatory Division of Natural Resources Canada tests novelty devices and approves those that are safe. Make sure you are selling novelty devices authorized by the Government of Canada. You can check the list of authorized explosives.\n\nYou are not allowed to sell or use other novelty items such as Sprite Bombs, party snaps and other similar types in Canada. These products are often marketed as novelty items, but they do contain a small amount of explosive material that is activated by either throwing the products to the ground or by stepping on them. There have been many serious injuries to people (mainly children) handling these products. See a list of prohibited fireworks.\n\nExplosives licence\n\nIf you are a distributor who sells novelty devices to retailers, you must have an explosives licence. Apply for an explosives licence through the electronic Licence Management System (eLMS).\n\nStoring novelty devices for sale\n\nYou are permitted to store up to 1000 kilograms of novelty devices in a sales establishment at any time, including those that are displayed for sale. If the sales establishment is in a building that contains a dwelling (such as a house or apartment), you are permitted to store up to 100 kilograms at any time, including those that are displayed for sale.\n\nNovelty Devices intended for sale must not be stored in a dwelling.\n\nYou must store novelty devices that are not displayed for sale in a storage unit that meets requirements and is outside of any dwelling. Learn about storing novelty devices in a storage unit.\n\nYou may store more than 1000 kilograms of novelty devices for sale if you hold an explosives licence. Apply for an explosives licence through the electronic Licence Management System (eLMS).\n\nDisplaying novelty devices for sale\n\nNovelty devices must be separated into lots or groups of 25 kilograms or less. Separate each lot from the others using a fire break such as plywood or sheet steel that will slow the rate of burning in the event of a fire.\n\nKeep novelty devices away from flammable substances and sources of ignition. Do not expose novelty devices to heat or dampness. Keep novelty devices at least 0.6 metres (60 centimetres) from the ceiling and from any fire prevention system. Smoking must be prohibited within 8 metres of the novelty devices.\n\nOnly people you have authorized must have access to the area behind the sale counter. You must constantly monitor novelty devices when the sales establishment is unlocked.\n\nContact us"
