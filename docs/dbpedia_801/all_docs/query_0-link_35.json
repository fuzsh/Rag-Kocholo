Then consider carefully where the recipient will place this artistic and scientific object. The Newton’s Cradle is mainly bought by intelligent people with a sense of style.\n\nOther names\n\nIn addition to pendulum, the words cradle, and kinetic balls are often used. The Newton’s Cradle is known worldwide and is a special gift for an intellectual recipient. It can be used well to explain the law of action and reaction.\n\nUse of the Newton’s Cradle\n\nBy lifting one of the outer balls to the side and then dropping it, you initiate a chain reaction. The kinetic balls will then transfer their energy to the other balls again. The outer ball on the other side will then be lifted and fall back down by gravity. Then the same thing happens the other way around.\n\nUnique gift"
