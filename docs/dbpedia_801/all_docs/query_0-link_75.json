When shown anything that depicts the letter \"I\" within 1.5 meters of itself it will destroy the \"I\" and replace the \"I\" with itself, this can include physically crushing the \"I\" and replacing it or drawing itself in after erasing it. It randomly turns itself on and off. It also appears to have the intelligence of a ten-year-old child and will try to help people out.\n\nDate of Recovery: 10-4-2019\n\nLocation of Recovery: It was bought by Dr. ████ for his office, it was then that he found out about the anomalous properties.\n\nCurrent Status: In the large office area of Site-██.\n\nItem Description: Multi-passcode locker in Sector █-A.

The story had been ripped out of the book it was in and was hidden under a table. The location of the rest of the book is unknown.\n\nCurrent Status: In a storeroom at Site-██.\n\nNotes: Reading this story to new employees so you can see them have a rock fall on their head is not the kind of testing we need to be doing, Dr. Bright. — Dr. Field.\n\nItem Description: A foam toy sword that, when used to attack a living animal, has the effect of a real sword.\n\nDate of Recovery: 03-12-2010\n\nLocation of Recovery: Walmart in Oroville, California.\n\nCurrent Status: Kept in Site-19.\n\nItem Description: A standard metal foldable chair that is non-anomalous until a person tries to sit down.

Has various pressure pads in different places beneath its skin which play an audio file of a voice similar to SCP-682's saying various encouraging and/or positive phrases. The taxidermy's skin cannot be broken and the source of the audio files is unknown. SCP-682 has not been informed of this anomaly's existence.\n\nDate of Recovery: 04-21-2020\n\nLocation of Recovery: The holding cell of D-95538, who had been assigned to SCP-682 testing the following day. D-95538 claimed that the taxidermy was there when he arrived, despite the guards tasked with escorting him to his cell having no recollection of seeing it.\n\nCurrent Status: The medbay of Site [REDACTED]. Reserved for personnel suffering exacerbated mental illness/emotional complications.\n\nNote: It has been deduced based on preliminary testing that the audio files are not prerecorded. Current tally of unique audio files observed: 751\n\nAnomalous Items 531 - 540\n\nItem Description: A coffee mug with the word \"Joe\" written on to it with permanent marker.

Seems to be two-dimensional as opposed to the standard three dimensions.\n\nDate of Recovery: 5-8-2020\n\nLocation of Recovery: A candy shop named \"Conifer's Confidential Confiserie\" that sold various CIA, ████ and Foundation-themed foods. Dismantled by the Foundation on ██/██/20██ after it was identified as a security breach.\n\nCurrent Status: Hung above Dr. Roosevelt's office.\n\nNote: What? I think it's pretty funny.\n\nItem Description: A red bath towel, slightly faded due to prolonged exposure to sunlight.

It is also capable of being charged using a standard car battery charger.\n\nDate of Recovery 13/5/2020\n\nLocation of Recovery Blister packaged on a shelf used for holding batteries at a car wash in [REDACTED], Ohio.\n\nCurrent Status In Dr █████'s car battery compartment.\n\nNote: Despite being chargeable and usable as a car battery, due to the small size of this item, both Dr █████'s car battery compartment and charger have been modified.\n\nItem Description: A standard wooden garden rake that causes all sapient beings in a 10-meter range around it to be compelled to step on its teeth, receiving the handle in the face or equivalent of such at a high velocity. Doing so permanently inoculates the affected individual to the item's effects but also acts as a short range amnestic, as subjects express surprise when hit by the handle and are unable to identify its anomalous properties, sincerely believing they stepped on the teeth by accident.\n\nDate of Recovery: 5-16-2020\n\nLocation of Recovery: Spontaneously manifested in a hallway on Site-██. Recovered after an estimated 23 personnel members were exposed to its effects during an SCP-███ containment breach, significantly slowing down the handling of the breach and causing the death of ██ personnel.\n\nCurrent Status: Suspended 15 m above the ground in an open-air storage compartment on Site-██.\n\nItem Description: A pair of plastic breasts of the kind sold as gag gifts, manufacturer unknown. When being observed by a human, the object breaks the observer's train of thought, compelling them to consider their biases related to women. The effect ceases simultaneously with cessation of viewing, but the subject can continue to explore the same line of thought afterwards.\n\nDate of Recovery: 10/31/1968\n\nLocation of Recovery: Household of ███ ███████, Los Angeles, California.\n\nCurrent Status: Kept in a drawer in the office of ████ ██, Site-19's Head Relationship Psychologist, for use in resolving or preventing conflicts between staff stemming from staff members' biases towards women. May be transferred to other sites per request with ████ ██'s approval.\n\nItem Description and Current Status: So, we've got a fella in a humanoid containment cell that can only be described usin' informal vernacular - you can't talk about 'im using any sort'a upper-crust \"clinical\" terminology, in other words. The guy himself doesn't seem to know that he's an anomaly - ol' Dr. Umen wants to feed 'im amnestics and let 'im go, considerin' that he's not a threat to normalcy or anythin'.\n\nDate of Recovery: We got 'im back on May 30, 2020.\n\nLocation of Recovery: Down in a city near - actually, we can't tell you any a that considerin' that it's top secret or somethin'.\n\nItem Description: A collection of seventeen miniature horse figurines. When placed inside any mobile vehicle, the automobile will anomalously be able to reach speeds of Mach fourteen. The property is present regardless of the vehicle's functionality or condition.\n\nDate of Recovery: 6/9/2020\n\nLocation of Recovery: Burent County Rodeo Arena, Burnet, Texas, U.S.A.\n\nCurrent Status: Two instances were destroyed during retrieval. The remaining fifteen are in storage.\n\nAnomalous Items 541 - 550\n\nItem Description: 997 (and counting) new episodes of Bob Ross: The Joy of Painting. These videos are entirely non anomalous except for the fact that Bob Ross has been deceased for 25 years and these episodes were made after his death. Evidence suggests that these episodes are made by Bob Ross and are broadcasted from Corbenic.\n\nDate of Recovery: Ongoing.\n\nLocation of Recovery: Each episode will randomly replace an advertisement slot of sufficient length on the █████████ network. A Foundation bot has been installed to reroute these episodes to the Foundation database and fill the empty time slot with the original programming.\n\nCurrent Status: Currently available to all Foundation staff to increase morale, painting supplies are available in the break room at Site-██ for use during breaks.\n\nNote: On ██/██/████, an episode was rerouted into the Foundation database and reviewed as per procedure, but instead of starting in usual fashion, Bob Ross said the following: \"Hello to my friends at the SCP Foundation, while I am sad that you won't let me continue painting for the world I understand why, and I am happy that my show will continue to bring joy to members of the Foundation and even someone as important as O5-█. With all that out of the way I'd like to thank you all for joining me here this week, if this is your first time watching the Joy of Painting, I'd like to extend a personal invitation for you to pull out your paints and join me, for a relaxing half hour of painting, and I'll show you just how easy it is to make some of the most beautiful art you've ever seen.\" Episode continued as usual except for the painting, which was later confirmed to be a depiction of SCP-354.\n\nItem Description: A shipment of twelve █████████ brand acoustic guitars exhibiting the anomalous property that each of the guitar strings will not stop vibrating until manually stopped by use of a person’s finger, and that none of the parts can be damaged. Use of dead or non-biological material will not stop the vibration of the strings, and despite their immunity to damage, the parts still exhibit identical microscopic structures and properties as the materials of the original guitar models. The anomalous properties of the shipment are only exhibited if the original guitars from the shipment contain all of their original parts.\n\nDate of Recovery: 8-12-2016\n\nLocation of Recovery: A Costco store located in ██████, Arizona.\n\nCurrent Status: Eleven in storage, one in the office of Dr. ████████████.\n\nItem Description: A ████████ brand refracting telescope that when looked through will rotate to point toward the nearest blue giant type star at a speed of approximately 6 rpm from the center of mass of the telescope.\n\nDate of Recovery: 25-6-2018\n\nLocation of Recovery: A pawnshop located in ██████████, California.\n\nCurrent Status: In storage.\n\nItem Description: A 0.76 0.53 meter branch from a birch (Betula papyrifera) tree that when held with two hands and swung against another material will exhibit the properties of a bladed weapon, cutting cleanly through the object. No physical changes to the branch are noted to happen when the anomalous properties activate. During a test where the branch was held with one hand, 0.26 m of the branch snapped off from impact force. The end that snapped off was found to be non-anomalous and incinerated afterwards.\n\nDate of Recovery: 2-11-2016\n\nLocation of Recovery: ███████, British Columbia, Canada.\n\nCurrent Status: In storage.\n\nItem Description: An otherwise mundane member of the species Homarus americanus (American lobster) that will enter a state of hibernation if the material surrounding it is at a temperature below 100°C. It has been shown that the lobster can survive temperatures of at least 3,422°C, although further testing is required. Additionally, the specimen does not require food or water in order to survive and does not appear to undergo the molting process common in others of its species.\n\nDate of Recovery: 6/17/2020\n\nLocation of Recovery: Off the coast of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina.\n\nCurrent Status: In storage.\n\nItem Description: A white, lined piece of writing paper (size A4) that when touched, records every action said person takes for 24 hours. After a day, the information written on the paper disappears and the process can start over again. The paper takes no effect if it has been touched already within the last 24 hours.\n\nDate of Recovery: 30/10/2001\n\nLocation of Recovery: In an elementary school classroom in █████████, used for a student's English assignment.\n\nCurrent Status: Currently laying on Dr Glass' desk at Site-██.\n\nItem Description: A large red button with the text \"REGICIDE\" written on it in white.

I am aware she is the one who conducts all the tests, but she keeps starting the arguments, and it's always something about █████ or ██████████.\" - Dr. Kyle\n\nNote:\"A test with Dr Kyle's suggestions is currently underway.\" - Site Director █████\n\nNote:\"Well, please remind me to keep Karen in the tests. The arguments made by my fellow colleagues were extremely violent and rapidly went out of control. Don't think we'll need more arguments about Mark Zuckerberg being a lizard overlord or not, because the clear answer is a yes and we do not need to inquire about it again.\" Dr. Kyle\n\nItem Description: A kneaded eraser that, when touching any paper material, causes it to spontaneously combust without damaging the paper itself. Anything in the vicinity of the paper is not protected. The two closest pencils to the object consistently begin pointing at it when not under direct observation.\n\nDate of Recovery: 12-5-2020\n\nLocation of Recovery: Grand Prairie, TX\n\nCurrent status: In Site-02's special containment lockers.\n\nItem Description: Junior Researcher Alexis Sommerton, who has a brief (usually lasting no more than 20 seconds) attack of the hiccups whenever any word containing the letter Q is said aloud in her vicinity. It was initially believed to be a coincidence, but experimentation on the part of several colleagues has confirmed this effect to be anomalous, if harmless.\n\nDate of Recovery: 12/8/2020\n\nLocation of Recovery: Site 77\n\nCurrent Status: Still employed at Site 77\n\nNote:Still not sure this belongs in this log, but she told me to write it up and put it here. Researcher Stephens\n\nAnomalous Items 601 - 610\n\nItem Description: A 1998 Ford F-150 Pickup truck.

Tea’s storage unit.\n\nCurrent Status: Stored disassembled in a locked box located in low-priority containment.\n\nNote: I was so mad when I found out where all my cool Halloween stuff had gone! Curse you, tiny tree. Curse you. - Guest Researcher W. Tea\n\nItem Description: A blank DVD-R that spins at a constant 600 RPM, or roughly the rate of playback. When placed on a surface, the object will flip upwards onto its edge and begin rolling at anywhere from 5 to 15 MPH. Speed has shown to increase when attempts are made to pick up the disc, often resulting in staff chasing the object for long periods of time.\n\nDate of Recovery: 03/25/2006\n\nLocation of Recovery: A subway station in Brooklyn, New York after Dr. ████████ was alerted to the object by a nearby civilian while waiting for transit to Site-██. Recovered after the object became stuck in a discarded piece of chewing gum.\n\nCurrent Status: In storage.\n\nNote: Due to the late hour of travel, the civilian was the only other person present on the platform. Because of this and the harmlessness of the anomaly, the person has not been sought out for amnesticization.\n\nItem Description: Two ticket stubs from a Jimi Hendrix concert at the PNC Music Pavilion in Charlotte, NC that is supposed to have occurred on December 15th of 1990. Appearance and composition of the tickets is consistent with others produced by the PNC Music Pavilion at the time, and analysis estimates their age to be approximately 30 years.\n\nDate of Recovery: 1/4/2021\n\nLocation of Recovery: The right hip pocket of a pair of jeans purchased from the █████ ██ ███ █████ thrift store by Dr. Lee Roy Carlson.\n\nCurrent Status: Framed in Dr. Lee Roy Carlson's office.\n\nItem Description: A sheet of A4 paper which is incapable of causing a 'papercut' injury under any circumstances.\n\nDate of Recovery: 1/6/2021\n\nLocation of Recovery: Site 23, where an agent noted its anomalous properties while working on a hand-written report draft. Investigation proved the sheet of paper to have been printed at a factory in ████, █████. No other papers printed at the factory in question displayed such anomalous properties.\n\nCurrent Status: In storage at Site 23.\n\nItem Description: A school calculator with a crude drawing of a face with horns on its head, which causes the answer of any equation typed on it to be 666.\n\nDate of Recovery: 1/9/2021.\n\nLocation of Discovery: A elementary school in a math class, where a student using it got expelled for bad behavior multiple times from Houston, United States.\n\nCurrent Status: In storage at Site 20.\n\nItem Description: A copy of \"Fallout: New Vegas\" for the Xbox console, made by Bethesda Softworks, When the game is played, the player will see the game from their perspective, experiencing the game as if they were the player character. Other than that, the game will play as anticipated.\n\nDate of Recovery: 1/12/2021.\n\nLocation of Discovery: A home in ███████ █████ ███████ United States\n\nCurrent Status: In the Break room at site 19.\n\nItem Description: A tri-hexa-flexagon (3 faced, 6 sided flexagon) paper toy that contains 360 faces instead of the expected three.\n\nDate of Recovery: 2021-1-12.\n\nLocation of Discovery: █████ ████████ farm in Texas, United States\n\nCurrent Status: In storage at Site-19.\n\nAnomalous Items 611 - 620\n\nItem Description: A bumper sticker that bears the message \"Honk If You're Horny.\" Any individual operating a vehicle equipped with a horn will activate said horn for as long as they are able to read the message on the bumper sticker.\n\nDate of Recovery: 12-30-2020\n\nLocation of Recovery: Oakland County, Michigan.\n\nCurrent Status: In storage, Site-81, Indiana.\n\nNote: No practical use as an 'alarm.' Anyone who's close enough to activate the effect will be visible in your rear-view mirror. — Researcher Robinson\n\nNote: Very well. But I'm noting that we should follow up on this one if Foundation vehicles start getting tailgated by invisible cars. — Researcher O'Malley\n\nItem Description: A heavy book that is 7 cm in height and 12 cm in length. Opening it to the first page causes the item to immediately flip to the final page. Starting at any page other than the first exhibits no anomalous effects, and the contents of the book itself are details pertaining to an old copy of a standardized US Naval Handbook published in 1960.\n\nDate of Recovery: 1-17-2021\n\nLocation of Recovery: The bookshop, █████ located in [REDACTED], California\n\nCurrent Status: In storage.\n\nNote: You know a desk fan was running at full blast at the time of this anomaly’s recovering, right? — Dr. D. Fitzgerald\n\nItem Description: A Boeing 747-400M airliner. If the aft-right lavatory is closed and locked while the aircraft is in flight, interior occupants have an approximately 4% chance of being transported to an unoccupied lavatory on another in-flight Boeing-747 derivative aircraft. A low-level antimemetic perception filter prevents the majority of passengers from realizing this has occurred until exiting the lavatory.\n\nDate of Recovery: 3-12-1994\n\nLocation of Recovery: Logan International Airport, Massachusetts\n\nCurrent Status: In storage, Site-76\n\nItem Description: A 1996 Ford Mustang convertible, painted a rather bright shade of red. When in motion, the item has a fairly strong antimemetic effect on those not currently inside it, causing them to act as though it were not present. Evidence of repair suggests that previous owners of the item discovered this effect the hard way but dismissed it as coincidence.\n\nDate of Recovery: 9-6-2019\n\nLocation of Recovery: Found abandoned in the parking lot of a shopping center, Detroit, MI\n\nCurrent status: Being tested for potential SCP classification\n\nItem Description: A handheld kerosene lantern with a traditional metal frame and glass housing; wear-and-tear on the frame suggests considerable age. Operates similarly to non-anomalous lanterns and can be ignited, handled, and carried as expected. Testing suggests it can do so in the absence of atmospheric oxygen.\n\nDate of Recovery: 2019/01/03 (see mission summary of Chang'e Lunar Landing)\n\nLocation of Discovery: The surface of the South Pole–Aitken basin, a 2,500 km-diameter crater in the moon's far side. Found overturned within a large basalt plain. Its fuel supply had been exhausted upon recovery.\n\nCurrent Status: In storage.\n\nItem Description: A lock of brown hair that smells pleasantly of lavender and cannot be made to exude any other scent.\n\nDate of Recovery: This item has been in Dr. Greaves’ possession for as long as his services have been employed by the Foundation.\n\nLocation of Recovery: Dr. Greaves has refused to disclose this information.\n\nCurrent Status: Kept on Dr. Greaves’ person at all times.\n\nNote: Sorry, but I’m never letting go of this. — Dr. Greaves\n\nItem Description: A spectacled owl the size of a small songbird. It still possesses the physical capabilities of a nonanomalous spectacled owl, killing small mammals and amphibians effortlessly. Due to its size, it kills its prey by slashing at the eyes of its victims, aiming for the animal to bleed to death. It doesn't seem to age, and it is relatively friendly towards humans.\n\nDate of Recovery: 01-25-2021\n\nLocation of Recovery: An exotic pet shop that sells anomalous animals in ████████, Vermont.\n\nCurrent Status: In Animal Containment at Site-██.\n\nItem Description: A battery-powered lantern, manufactured by ███████. Item operates normally, even when batteries are non-functioning or not present. The light emitted does not dim under non-anomalous circumstances, even when unpowered. Affixed to the base of the lantern is a white sticker bearing the phrase \"For Fiona from Jake. May it always light your path.\"\n\nDate of Recovery: 8-6-2020\n\nLocation of Recovery: Abandoned campsite outside a cave entrance in Carlsbad Caverns National Park\n\nCurrent Status: Being tested for further anomalous effects.\n\nItem Description: A sheaf of 150 papers that share contents when modified with any writing/drawing tools including: ink, lead, paint, and blood.\n\nDate of Recovery: 2021-1-27.\n\nLocation of Discovery: █████ ███████ Elementary school in California, United States.\n\nCurrent Status: Pending use as instant and secure communication.\n\nItem Description: A Eastern Blue-tongued skink (tiliqua scincoides scincoides), which appears to be unaffected by the laws of gravity.\n\nDate of Recovery: 01-20-2021\n\nLocation of Discovery: Floating 4,500m above Melbourne, Australia\n\nCurrent Status: In wildlife containment at Site-24\n\nAnomalous Items 621 - 630\n\nItem Description: A pair of walkie-talkies, with no manufacturer's marking visible, even on the inside. Objects perform as expected, with the exception that there does not appear to be any upper limit to their communication range. Primary testing has revealed that the objects can be used effectively from upwards of 2,000 miles away.\n\nDate of Recovery: 2021-1-21\n\nLocation of Recovery: Abandoned on a bench near a public beach in Sydney, Australia\n\nCurrent Status: Being tested for limits of anomalous effect\n\nItem Description: A non-Euclidean \"Pringles\" brand can of chips that is extended on the inside. As it goes deeper, it gets larger by about 0.001*x2 cm per every centimeter on the outside (that means that the bottom centimeter is actually 10.29 cm). Only chips are affected, with any other object put in being treated as if it's in a regular can. The can, and all the chips inside it, weigh the same as a regular can filled up to a proportional degree.\n\nDate of Recovery: 07-11-2015\n\nLocation of Discovery: Bought by Junior Research Assistant █████ Emerson in a on-site Walmart.\n\nCurrent Status: Tagged and being repeatedly shipped for refill to the near Pringles Factory.\n\nNote: I don't care that it's immoral, we have limited funding! - ██-█\n\nItem Description: A complete set of painting supplies titled, \"The Perfect Paint Kit\". The paint tubes in the set don't ever seem to empty, despite being poured into a standard paint can built to hold a gallon of paint. The paint brushes are also highly resistant to damage and the bristles are unable to be bent in such a way that would \"ruin the paint brush\", as claimed on the back end of the items' original packaging. The paint brushes come to a total of 9, ranging from fine-tipped brushes, to more broad-lined brushes. The last item in the set, the water pail, always has 3 liters of water in it, and washing paint off the brushes in it doesn't change the color of the water.\n\nDate of Recovery: 05-14-2017\n\nLocation of Recovery: Item was brought in by Researcher Daniel Ham after he purchased the item at a local crafts store. He discovered the anomalous nature of the item when the water pail had clean water in it, and the weight of the paint tubes hadn't changed. Interview with employees shows no one knows where the product shipped from, or its original manufacturer. All interviewed were amnesticized and released as per standard procedure.\n\nCurrent Status: In Site-██ break room, with paper and easel available for personal to use.\n\nNote: Can we get some of those anomalous Bob Ross tapes? I think those would go really well with these paints. - Researcher █████ ███████\n\nItem Description: A 3 pound bag of \"Jelly Belly™ Bean Boozled®\" jelly beans that contains flavors of both \"good\" and \"bad\" jelly beans which are not endorsed by the company. Flavors include, but are not limited to: \"Black Licorice/Black Tar Heroin\" \"Tomato/Blood of Orphans\" \"Brussel Sprouts/Chlorophyll\" \"Lettuce/Cannabis\" \"Green Onion/Toxic Waste\" and several others. All flavors taste exactly as described, and are nontoxic, even if the original source flavor was.\n\nDate Of Recovery: 2-21-██\n\nLocation of Recovery: Bought by Dr. Laz on one of her frequent visits to ████████'s Prank Emporium.\n\nCurrent Status: Kept in a cabinet in In Site-██'s break room.\n\nNote:\"Whoever keeps putting handfuls of these in a bowl with other assorted jelly beans, I beg you to stop. It's cruel, even by my standards.\" - Dr. Laz\n\nNote:\"It was funny the first few times, but after tasting dish soup and laundry bleach, I think we need to put a lock on that cabinet.\" - Researcher Daniel Ham\n\nItem Description: A prank device in the shape of a pen, designed to deliver a mild electric shock to anyone who attempts to use it. This particular device delivers an amount of electricity similar to a police-issue taser, causing significant pain and temporary paralysis.\n\nDate of Recovery: 2-4-21\n\nLocation of Recovery: Left in Site-██ break room by an unknown person. Discovered when a junior researcher failed to report for duty and was found unconscious on the break room floor.\n\nCurrent Status: In storage. Kept in a locked safe in the security office of Site-██.\n\nNote:\"Are we sure this isn't just a real novelty device someone made?\" - Dr. Laz\n\nNote: Yes, we are. It should be impossible for the internal workings to generate sufficient electricity. —Researcher Jacobs\n\nItem Description: A heavily-damaged analog stopwatch with a singular button that, when pressed, \"starts\" the clock feature despite it having already been started an unknown number of times. The minute and second hand are in the correct position for each time despite being singular objects, and any specific time or times currently being tracked by the clock can be observed simultaneously, though attempting to view all times at once leads to nearly the entire clock face being obscured. Disassembly and reassembly has no effect on the item's properties.\n\nDate of Recovery: 11-03-21\n\nLocation of Recovery: Among several items left at a homeless shelter in Los Angeles, California.\n\nCurrent Status: Button mechanism removed. Mechanism and remainder of item held in separate object storage lockers.\n\nItem Description: A standardized blue army helmet, with the letters 'UN' painted on both sides. Typically used by UN Infantry Units. When worn by a person, they can only be referred to as a 'Blue Helmet' or 'Blue Helmet Unit' when being spoken about verbally. This effect is applied to the wearer, and when not being worn, the object compels those in a direct line of sight to wear the object.\n\nDate of Recovery: 06-01-1948\n\nLocation of Recovery: Sent to the Foundation via PO box from the UN HQ in NY. All officials, including Secretary-General António Guterres, denied having sent the object.\n\nCurrent Status: In low-grade anomalous storage.\n\nNote: I think it's kind of funny, but Dr. Richter was not happy when he found that thing in a package on his deck the day we recovered it. He isn't fully convinced the UN is innocent in this situation, but he's not authorized to send out agents to investigate. Thank god, he can be such a stuck-up. -Researcher Reaas\n\nSecond Note: Researcher Reaas is currently being reviewed to see if he is still capable of his position after an inquiry from an Anonymous foundation staff member. -Automated Message\n\nItem Description: A 45 inch automatic double barrel sniper rifle with an adjustable scope. The object shoots approximately 1700 rounds per minute with each round traveling 2685 feet per second. The object fires two bullets together while functioning like an AR with the firepower of a SR. Despite the power in each round and the rate of bullets fired, the object does not overheat or jam. The object uses ammunition from a M4 Carbine magazine that always always appears in its users pocket or pants. The anomalous object supplies an infinite amount of magazines in the users pocket.\n\nDate of Recovery: 2-12-2021\n\nLocation of Discovery: Found inside a military grade crate left aside the road near ██████, Wyoming.\n\nCurrent Status: Sealed away in storage.\n\nNote: The bullets used in the magazine are 7.62×51mm caliber ammunition.\n\nNote: \"This thing is hell awesome! Incredibly light, no recoil, and infinite ammunition! I personally got to use it and I think these would be excellent with the Mobile Task Force. Of course we would have to find out how to replicate it…\"\n\nItem Description: An 18-inch rock that immediately will grow moss pointing towards any location when any human marks the name of the location on the rock, usually with a smaller rock or a chalky substance.\n\nDate of Recovery: 06-24-██████\n\nLocation of Recovery: Northeastern Canada, specifically ██████\n\nCurrent Status: Site ██████ Low-security storage room.\n\nItem Description: Oval-shaped glass ornament inscribed with the words \"Honesty is the best policy.\" Anyone touching the ornament cannot communicate any statement they know to be false, either by speaking, writing, or using sign language. Subjects often claim that \"the words just won't come out.\"\n\nDate of Recovery: 2-20-21\n\nLocation of Recovery: Secondhand store in Chicago, IL\n\nCurrent Status: On loan to Site-██ for interrogation of PoI-██████\n\nAnomalous Items 631 - 640\n\nItem Description: A plastic Barbie doll that appears to have been chewed on by a large dog unknown canine entity. When exposed to the light of the full moon, the doll rapidly transforms into a plush toy resembling an anthropomorphic wolf.\n\nDate of Recovery: 2-27-2021\n\nLocation of Recovery: An abandoned mobile home in the forest near Grundy, Virginia.\n\nCurrent Status: In storage.\n\nItem Description: A specimen of Aurelia aurita (moon jellyfish) with areas of black pigmentation forming a distinct \"smiley face\" on its bell. Additional patches of pigmentation spell the words \"Jerome the Jolly Jellyfish, by Dr. Wondertainment\" in small letters around its circumference. This designation appears as #10 in Document 4225-a. The object lacks stinging cells but does not appear to require sustenance.\n\nDate of Recovery: 2-27-2021\n\nLocation of Recovery: Ripley's Aquarium in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, in a tank with numerous non-anomalous moon jellyfish.\n\nCurrent Status: A jellyfish aquarium in the low-risk anomalous animal containment sector at Site-66.\n\nItem Description: A GP KF-4W CMR karting helmet (homologation number: CMR123456) manufactured by Sparco S. P. A, that appears to be a different colour on the visible light spectrum every time it is observed. These colours appear to be shown at random, and from preliminary testing, the item can be shown to be different colours to multiple people at once. It is unclear whether the effect comes from only the paint, or the material the helmet is manufactured from itself.\n\nDate of Recovery: ██-2-20██\n\nLocation of Recovery: A warehouse owned by online motorsport shop █████ ████ in █████, England.\n\nCurrent Status: Currently housed in storage in Site 64.\n\nItem Description: One empty pan of pre-made enchiladas, brand Y█████ , made of tin. When a subject enters within 10 meters of the pan, they will feel \"Extremely yet pleasantly full.\" If subject has a living parent or grandparent, they will comment \"Just like [INSERT NAME OF FAMILY MEMBER HERE] used to make\". If subject has no living paternal or maternal figures, they will not comment. No deviations of this manner have been recorded to date.\n\nDate of Recovery: █-3-20██\n\nLocation of Recovery: Residence of one John Watson, Burlington VT. Of note is the fact the Mr.Watson is morbidly obese yet rumored to exercise frequently, so it shall be assumed that the object in question does hold caloric content.\n\nCurrent Status: Currently in Site 66 cafeteria. Exposure to the object is limited to 5 minutes a day, in which the subject will gain exactly 240 calories of dietary value.\n\nItem Description: One Bottle of E████████ ██ Company Brandy, complete with a selection of seven shot-glasses reading \"Drink E████████ ██ Company Brandy, it's like fire in the stomach!\". When brandy is drunk with one of the shot-glasses provided, a force of heat equivalent to a small brush-fire will arise in the stomach, causing moderate discomfort. However, this will not cause any damage, and the feeling will dissipate after the event, which usually will last about 15 seconds.\n\nDate of Recovery: █-3-20██\n\nLocation of Recovery: Phillipshead Brewery, in Hinesberg VT, after reports of a total of three men and one woman in front of the brewery, screaming \"It's like fire!\" with shot-glasses in their hands\n\nCurrent Status: Locked in cold storage after a number of incidents involving one J███ B█████.\n\nItem Description: A male quagga (Equus quagga quagga). One of the animal's stripes (on the right side of its neck) spells the words \"Quincy the Quaint Quagga, by Dr. Wondertainment\" in white. This designation appears as #17 in Document 4225-a. Though the object does not exhibit greater intelligence than a typical animal, it appears to have been domesticated and is remarkably docile.\n\nDate of Recovery: 3-3-2021\n\nLocation of Recovery: In a pasture with several non-anomalous horses at a ranch near Great Falls, Montana.\n\nCurrent Status: In a the low-risk anomalous animal containment sector at Site-66, sharing its enclosure with a female quagga produced by SCP-646. Captive breeding efforts are currently underway.\n\nItem Description: Small hardcover book, bound in leather. When the book is opened, the pages remain blank as long as there is only one person within 10 meters. If there are multiple people within this space, the book will anomalously write the thoughts of the person closest to the holder of the book, in stream of consciousness format.\n\nDate of Recovery: 3-4-2021\n\nLocation of Recovery: Bookstore in Gary, Indiana. The book had fallen behind the rest of the books on a shelf and become lost some time previously. Based on the thickness of the dust, it is believed that this occurred between 2 and 5 months prior to its discovery.\n\nCurrent Status: Available to security personnel, for interrogation purposes.\n\nItem Description: Laminated paper sign reading \"NO RUNNING\" in black letters. Any person living thing within 200 yards of the sign cannot or maintain any speed above a moderate walk.\n\nDate of Recovery: 3-6-2021\n\nLocation of Recovery: [REDACTED] High School, Albany, NY\n\nCurrent Status: In low-value item storage.\n\nNote: No matter how funny you think it might be, using this item in a prank is not permitted. Anomalies are not toys, no matter how harmless they are. - Site Director █████\n\nItem Description: Unmarked plastic container full of glitter in various colors. The glitter can be removed and used as normal, but can only be removed from the skin. Contact with any other material causes the glitter to bond permanently to the surface, rendering it impossible to remove without completely destroying the surface. The container spontaneously refills itself when both empty and unobserved.\n\nDate of Recovery: 3-5-2021\n\nLocation of Recovery: A party store franchise location in Miami, FL\n\nCurrent Status: Being tested with anomalous objects to determine the limits of its properties.\n\nItem Description: A French translation of War and Peace by Leo Tolstoy that will launch itself towards the head of any human within three meters of it at speeds in excess of 100 kph.\n\nDate of Recovery: 3-10-2021\n\nLocation of Recovery: ████████ Bookstore in Lancaster, Pennsylvania\n\nCurrent Status: In Storage Locker 344, Site-██\n\nAnomalous Items 641 - 650\n\nItem Description: Surveillance camera of indeterminate make and model, made circa 2010. Anyone looking at the camera has the sensation of something crawling on an area of exposed skin. This sensation has been confirmed to be a tactile hallucination.\n\nDate of Recovery: 3-12-2021\n\nLocation of Recovery: Small store specializing in home security equipment, Dallas-Fort Worth, Texas\n\nCurrent Status: In storage.\n\nItem Description: A vending machine which only dispenses discontinued or otherwise unavailable varieties of soft drinks. The machine uses a standard key and can be easily filled. However, any drinks placed within it which are commonly available will be replaced with varieties that are no longer available, presumably when the machine is filled. How this occurs is not known, as video recording equipment will not operate within line of sight of the machine.\n\nDate of Recovery: 3-15-2021\n\nLocation of Recovery: Jackson, MS\n\nCurrent Status: In Site-██ break room, for use by all personnel.\n\nNote: Drinking some of this stuff makes you realize it was discontinued for a reason. - Agent Jackson\n\nItem Description: A copy of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, by Lewis Carroll, printed in 1964. Anyone reading more than 4 pages will be unable to voluntarily stop reading until reaching the end of the book. The book must be forcibly removed from the reader's grip.\n\nDate of Recovery: 3-16-2021\n\nLocation of Recovery: Book sale at a public library, Peoria, IL\n\nCurrent Status: In storage.\n\nNote: This item is no more resistant to damage than any other book of the period. Use caution when freeing others from its anomalous effect to avoid unnecessary damage. - Researcher Stephens\n\nItem Description: A standard industrial shredder that functions as intended. However, there is an extra button on the shredder. When pressed, the shredder's blades will move in the opposite direction than they would normally move. Additionally, any item previously shredded will exit the machine, completely unharmed.\n\nDate of Recovery: 3-22-2021\n\nLocation of Recovery: Junkyard, Fresno, CA\n\nNote: The effect only applies to items that have been consumed by the shredder. Any piece of debris that flies out during the shredding process will remain in its current position, unchanged. - Researcher Davis\n\nItem Description: A small plastic flashlight that, when switched on, projects a beam of darkness rather than a beam of light. When the darkness is projected on a person's face, they are blinded. Many subjects refer to the effect as similar to the darkness in a cave or a mine. Night vision equipment is ineffective at penetrating the darkness produced.\n\nDate of Recovery: 3-21-2021\n\nLocation of Recovery: Joke shop in Chicago, IL\n\nCurrent Status: In storage.\n\nNote: This \"flashdark\", as it is colloquially known, uses batteries standard for a flashlight of its size. The batteries drain a lot faster than you'd expect, so the thing is almost useless unless you have lots of backup batteries. - Agent McKinley\n\nItem description: A tube of Mentos that seems to hold an infinite amount of said candy. Allowed to be used by any personnel when mentos are needed. No longer allowed to be used by any personnel unless given clearance by Dr. ███████ and a reason is supplied.\n\nDate of recovery: 05-01-2020\n\nLocation of recovery: A corner shop in █████\n\nCurrent status: Site-18 Office of Dr.███████\n\nNote: Higher restrictions of use have been put in place since someone decided to combine it with Site-18’s endless pepsi bottle. -Dr.███████\n\nItem Description: A specimen of ovis aries, more commonly known as a sheep, which is capable of two-way communication in Spanish. Notably, it does not possess intelligence beyond that of a mundane instance of the species and solely communicates simplistic observations. It can react to certain phrases that roughly translate into things that it understands such as a command to walk a certain direction, but is unresponsive to more sophisticated speech. It also cannot learn to associate things with words, such as the name of new objects it is presented with.\n\nDate of Recovery: 11-13-1984\n\nLocation of Recovery: An undisclosed farm in Canada.\n\nCurrent Status: Dead due to mundane aging, the remains are stored but show no anomalous properties.\n\nItem Description: A kitchen knife that carries a memetic property where those viewing it or pictures of it will believe it is anomalous, but unable to explain the specifics of what the anomalous properties are or why they believe it has them.\n\nDate of Recovery: 12-10-2004\n\nLocation of Recovery: Agent █████'s kitchen.\n\nCurrent Status: In storage.\n\nNotice from Dr. Charleston: Just because I'm designating the object as anomalous doesn't mean I've fallen under its influence, it is genuinely an anomaly, even if it also causes a delusion of such.\n\nItem description: A keyring in the shape of a white billiard ball that when in contact with a person's skin changes their voice to a passable different voice (often of the opposite gender) as if changed by a high quality digital voice modulator. It does not take effect when not in direct contact with user's skin.\n\nDate of recovery: 07-04-2003\n\nLocation of recovery: Secondhand shop in Luik, Belgium\n\nCurrent status: In use by Dr. W. █████████\n\nNote: How has the truth not spread far enough yet that people still are confused when they actually see me? -Dr. W. █████████\n\nItem description: An engraved brass pin in the shape of the SCP logo, with added coloration to fill in the object's indents. The object, when pinned onto the lapel of any individual, gives them basic information on the Foundation and its purposes, as well as access to the information given only to Level-2 Personnel.\n\nDate of recovery: 04-04-1974\n\nLocation of recovery: Site-██ Personnel Offices\n\nCurrent status: In use by Foundation Staff Currently In Storage\n\nNote: Had to terminate D-10057 after we used him to experiment with the effects. The object happens to give full information on ALL SCPs with a Level 2 Clearance requirement. I expect a report will be filed regarding the object within the week. -Dr. H. Ferguson\n\nSecond Note: Had to return the damn thing to Storage after a failed attempt to use it as a tool for informing newly-ranked Level-2 Clearance Staff, and this was after it gave one new guy more information than he was necessarily required for his job. -Johnathan Smart, Head of Security at Site-██.\n\nAnomalous Items 651 - 660\n\nItem description: A German translation of The Count of Monte Cristo that causes anyone who touches it with bare skin to immediately suffer the symptoms of severe brucine poisoning.\n\nDate of recovery: 3/26/21\n\nLocation of recovery: Located after a series of unexplained deaths at ████████, Minnesota\n\nCurrent status: In anomalous weapons storage at Site-██\n\nItem Description: Metal and plastic badge in the shape of a stereotypical Wild West sheriff's star, bearing the words \"bikini inspector.\" Item is effectively identical to millions of other such items sold as novelties except for the fact that no manufacturer's markings can be located. When worn by a human subject, any females in the vicinity wearing bikinis will feel a mild compulsion to approach the wearer and present themselves for inspection. This applies to visual inspection only. Any physical contact will end the compulsion immediately.\n\nDate of Recovery: 3-24-2021\n\nLocation of Recovery: Seized from a beach in Miami, FL after a video was found on a popular social media site showing the item's effect\n\nCurrent Status: In low-value secure item storage at Site-██\n\nNote: This item is in secure storage for a reason, and it's not because it's dangerous. Anyone caught trying to take the item with them on vacation will be reprimanded. Anomalies, no matter how harmless, are not to be used for fun. -Site Director ██████\n\nItem Description: A consumer-grade birdhouse that spontaneously gains new anomalous properties and/or transforms physically as new containment procedures are enacted on it, rendering said containment ineffective to some degree. The new properties replace the old ones, and the object will no longer display those which do not currently cause a breach.\n\nDate of Recovery: 2-30-1971\n\nLocation of Recovery: An undisclosed pet store in Australia.\n\nCurrent Status: Fused to a soundproofed locker.\n\nNote: It has been suggested that the object's containment be modified in such a way that it is manipulated to gain new properties which would benefit the Foundation, however, other similar anomalies with actual SCP classifications would be better suited for this role and as such these suggestions are not being implemented at the time of writing.\n\nItem Description: A T-shirt, men's size medium, showing nothing more than a black symbol against a white background. The symbol appears to be some form of glyph, but merely looking at the symbol causes pain. This effect manifests as mild eyestrain after 10 seconds of exposure and escalates in severity, becoming a migraine after only 7 minutes. The longest anyone has been able to view the symbol was 12 minutes and 40 seconds. The viewer, a sufferer of cluster headaches, claimed that it was the worst pain she'd ever experienced. Other than the symbol, the item is non-anomalous.\n\nDate of Recovery: 3-6-2021\n\nLocation of Recovery: Found at a garage sale in Minneapolis, MN, under a pile of clothing, none of which has been found to be anomalous.\n\nCurrent status: In storage.\n\nNote:A request has been submitted to study the symbol, to discover if its anomalous effect is part of the item or intrinsic to the symbol itself. At the time of writing, the request is being reviewed by the Ethics Committee.\n\nItem Description: A red bouncy ball with a height symbol on it. When thrown, it always bounces up to the exact height of the thrower, then loudly exclaims the exact height in an unidentifiable male voice. This effect only occurs on the first bounce.\n\nDate of Recovery: 4-2-2021\n\nLocation of Recovery: Discovered in a major motion picture prop closet after it halted filming for multiple films.\n\nCurrent Status: Accidentally terminated after an attempt to “bounce it so hard it would make Researcher [REDACTED] sound taller.”\n\nNote: Do not let this happen again. - Head researcher\n\nItem Description: A sheet of standard A1 copier/printer paper, which is completely blank. It can be written on easily. However, when either side is more than 80% filled, all markings instantly disappear. The item also displays a very high resistance to damage.\n\nDate of Recovery: 3-31-2021\n\nLocation of Recovery: On the floor of a supply closet at Site-63\n\nCurrent Status: Available on request to all personnel level 2 and above.\n\nItem Description: A baseball that instantaneously causes various injuries, especially sports injuries, upon catching the ball in the air, even if there are no risk factors that can lead to these injuries. The baseball is otherwise unremarkable, and picking up the ball from the surface or the ground does not lead to any of these injuries.\n\nDate of Recovery: 08/13/1981\n\nLocation of Recovery: ████████ High School, ██████, NY\n\nCurrent Status: In storage, pending further research.\n\nNote: Aargh! This is [EXPLETIVE] painful! My leg is fractured! - Dr. Alchen\n\nItem Description: An unbranded yellow pencil that rotates the graphite end at random to point towards the nearest teacher.\n\nDate of Recovery: 04/20/2018\n\nLocation of Recovery: ██████████ ███████ Academy, Philippines\n\nCurrent Status: In storage\n\nItem Description: An antique brass compass (by closest estimation, manufactured between 1810 and 1840) whose needle does not point to magnetic north. Instead, the needle points in the direction of the nearest source of street food.\n\nDate of Recovery: 6-9-2020\n\nLocation of Recovery: Antique store in ███████, NY\n\nCurrent Status: In low-value item storage.\n\nItem Description: A specimen of Puntius semifasciolatus (gold barb fish) with the face of a human male. A miniature top hat, which does not seem to impede swimming, has been affixed to its head by unknown means. Patches of black pigmentation along its left side spell the words \"Ferdinand the Fancy Fish, by Dr. Wondertainment\" in tiny letters. This designation appears as #06 in Document 4225-a.\n\nDate of Recovery: 4/7/2021\n\nLocation of Recovery: A Wal-Mart in Claypool Hill, VA\n\nCurrent Status: In an aquarium in Site-66's low-risk animal containment sector.\n\nAnomalous Items 661 - 670\n\nItem Description: A male humuhumunukunukuapuaʻa with nomenclative memetic properties that compel any individual attempting to communicate about said humuhumunukunukuapuaʻa to specifically refer to the aforementioned humuhumunukunukuapuaʻa as a humuhumunukunukuapuaʻa, rather than with an abbreviation or pronoun. The humuhumunukunukuapuaʻa has a pattern of bright blue pigmentation on the humuhumunukunukuapuaʻa's left side spelling the words \"Hubert the Hilarious Humuhumunukunukuapuaʻa, by Dr. Wondertainment\" in small letters. This designation appears as #08 in Document 4225-a. Despite the humuhumunukunukuapuaʻa's name, the humuhumunukunukuapuaʻa does not appear to be anomalously funny. It is believed that the supposed \"hilarity\" was intended to arise from repeated usage of the word \"humuhumunukunukuapuaʻa\", but all personnel have reported that it was only funny the first few times and increasingly annoying thereafter. The underpaid research assistant who had to write \"humuhumunukunukuapuaʻa\" a hundred fucking times to fill out this stupid fucking entry about a stupid fucking humuhumunukunukuapuaʻa thoroughly agrees.\n\nDate of Recovery: 4/11/2021\n\nLocation of Recovery: A decorative fish tank in the ███████ Restaurant in Atlanta, GA.\n\nCurrent Status: In an aquarium in Site-66's low-risk animal containment sector.\n\nItem Description: A folded paper airplane, rather more elaborate than most. When touched by anyone above the age of 18, it immediately teleports to a random location within 3 meters.\n\nDate of Recovery: 4/13/2021\n\nLocation of Recovery: [REDACTED] High School, San Diego, California\n\nCurrent Status: Stuck above the ceiling in the cafeteria of Site-64. Due to the anomalous effect, reality anchors will be required for retrieval.\n\nItem Description: A T28 Superheavy tank, weighing roughly 90 tons, in well worn condition. The vehicle has a cognitohazardous effect that causes anyone that views it to see it as a large bush. The area covered by the perceived bush is not as large as the tank itself, meaning a person can walk into the tank while they believe that they are walking around a bush, at which point they become aware of the tank's presence; this is how the vehicle was discovered. The foundation subsequently administered amnestics to the affected individuals and replaced the vehicle with a non-anomalous reproduction.\n\nDate of Recovery: 07/12/1974\n\nLocation of Recovery: A field in Fort Belvoir, Virginia.\n\nCurrent Status: In Site-52's anomalous vehicle storage garage.\n\nNote: Vehicle has been labeled with signage after staff got sick of being asked why there was a bush in the garage.\n\nItem Description: Chef's knife, 25 cm (approximately 10 inches) in length. No manufacturer's name or logo is visible. Whenever the knife is used to cut any item, it actually generates a cognitohazardous effect causing observers (including the user) to believe the item has been cut. Video recordings bypass this effect, showing that the knife is never actually used to cut the item in question.\n\nDate of Recovery: 2/2/2020\n\nLocation of Recovery: Estate sale in northern Michigan\n\nCurrent Status: In storage Being tested.\n\nNote: It has recently been called into question whether this item actually has cognitohazardous properties or if its effect operates in some other fashion. I personally find the question to be of minimal importance, and feel that several of my colleagues have far too much time on their hands. - Dr. Malkin\n\nAs this item has a potential connection to an SCP, Dr. Malkin's opinion regarding this matter is no longer relevant. All avenues will be explored. - O5-13\n\nItem Description: A standard Magic 8 Ball with a 1999 Toys R’ Us logo on the back. When shook the item will always answer with a variation of the “Unsure” answer. The response given is always different from the last answer. There is currently an indeterminable amount of responses.\n\nDate of Recovery: 1/2/2009\n\nLocation of Recovery: Garage Sale Located in Indianapolis, Indiana, USA.\n\nCurrent Status: In Storage\n\nItem Description: A coke brand soda machine that, no matter what filled with or amount of contents, will output Diet Pepsi.\n\nDate of Recovery: 3/9/2019\n\nLocation of Recovery: McDonalds in Detroit, Michigan, USA.\n\nCurrent Status: Area-02’s Cafeteria, available for all personnel to use.\n\nItem Description: Pepsi brand soda machine that, regardless of contents or button pressed, dispenses a random variety of soda, including several that have been discontinued or never existed in the first place.\n\nDate of Recovery: 10-15-2020\n\nLocation of Recovery: Basement of a fraternity house, Raleigh, NC\n\nCurrent Status: In Site 16's cafeteria, available for use by all personnel.\n\nNote: There is a small (<10%) chance of this item dispensing anomalous soft drinks, including SCP-2107. Exercise caution when the machine dispenses any soft drink you don't recognize. - Dr. Jameson\n\nItem Description: US $1 bill which subjects are extremely reluctant to part with, even when offered a bill of identical value or the bill's equivalent in coins. When questioned, those affected explain that they \"might need it.\"\n\nDate of Recovery: 2-1-2021\n\nLocation of Recovery: Found behind the wall of a condemned building in Washington, D.C.\n\nCurrent Status: In storage, sealed inside a locked container.\n\nItem Description: A brandless paint bucket containing an endless amount of blue paint.
