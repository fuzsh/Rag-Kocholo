        "text": "Science and its applications are way beyond the textbook experiments and class activities we did as kids. But to boost the interest of students in science and help them learn the basics, these simple and interesting experiments and observation projects enable them to understand varied basic concepts of Science. Often class 8 students are asked to submit their science project by the end of the year, in which they have to choose a topic, carry out an experiment and state the conclusion of their chosen scientific principle through their science project. Read this blog to learn about the best and most interesting science projects for class 8 which can help you delve deeper into the magic of science while also getting a higher score in your science class!\n\nDownload NCERT Solutions Class 7 Science Chapter 8 Important Questions and Answers PDF\n\nBest Science Projects for Class 8\n\nFor science projects for class 8, students are generally asked to perform an experiment, conduct an activity or design a working model which elucidates the principle that they have chosen. Thus, we will explain to you how you can perform simple experiments as well as create a working model.\n\nTop 45 Science Models for Class 8\n\nHere is a list of top Science Models that you can try:\n\nDrop an egg to prove the first law of motion\n\nAssemble a Newton’s cradle\n\nBlow out a candle with a balloon\n\nRelight a candle without touching it\n\nMeasure and compare lung capacity\n\nBuild an infinity mirror\n\nBrew up some root beer\n\nConstruct a cup holder\n\nAssemble a spring scale\n\nExtract bismuth from Pepto-Bismol\n\nMake a solar desalinator\n\nPerform a starch test with iodine\n\nKeep your hands warm\n\nExplore symbiosis with nitrogen-fixing bacteria\n\nCrash cars for science\n\nDiscover the center of gravity\n\nPower up homemade batteries\n\nExamine the connection between personality and memory\n\nConcoct and test your own shampoo\n\nFuel a film canister rocket\n\nStand on a pile of paper cups\n\nCreate a rainbow of flames\n\nGet your laundry really clean\n\nTest water quality\n\nFingerprint analysis\n\nCreate a roller coaster loop\n\nExtract your DNA\n\nSeparate water into hydrogen and oxygen\n\nBuild a circuit to detect ripe produce\n\nDiscover the strength of interleaved paper\n\nGuide a growing plant through a maze\n\nFind out if peppermint improves reaction time\n\nRaise a hydraulic elevator\n\nGrow a carbon sugar snake\n\nGenerate a Lichtenberg figure\n\nTeach a computer to play tic-tac-toe\n\nCast animal tracks\n\nConstruct a Rube Goldberg machine\n\nBlock the sun’s UV rays\n\nTurn juice into spheres\n\nMeasure your threshold of hearing\n\nMeasure how body temperature and reaction time vary throughout the day\n\nModel the human cardiovascular system\n\nUse spin tests to discover how your eyes and ears affect your balance and dizziness\n\nDetermine how much huddling reduces heat loss in warm-blooded animals\n\nScience Projects for Class 8 for Exhibitions\n\nHere are some of the Science Projects for Class 8th Exhibitions that you can try:\n\nMeasuring Glucose in Food\n\nThe majority of the meals that we take in a day include carbohydrates or sugar. But the form in which we consume them is different and the one that is found inside the human body is different. In our body, glucose is broken down into simpler substances and you can opt for a glucose experiment for your Class 8 science project through which you can analyse the presence of carbohydrates in glucose and our food. As per your choice, collect some food items of daily life along with food dye, room temperature water, plastic glasses, knife and record your observations. You will also need glucose reading strips for this science project and create a positive strip by dipping a glucose strip into a sugar-based or glucose solution as well as a negative strip by dipping a glucose strip into the water. Then, test each of the foods you have taken with these two strips and record your observations.\n\nBoiling Point of Water\n\nWater in its pure form has a specific boiling point and if we keep on adding some solutions or chemicals to water, its boiling point tends to change. For this simple and interesting science project for Class 8, you need some basic household items, i.e. sugar, salt, lemon juice, oil, oranges, jaggery, tea, etc. Ask an adult for supervision and assistance in helping you test the boiling point of water while adding a different item every time. Record your observation for these items and create your Science project accordingly.\n\nBaking Soda Volcano\n\nHaving a homemade volcano is an amazing science science project. You need to build a cone shaped structure similar to a volcano with a container in the middle. Then in that container, add vinegar. Now, to demonstrate the working of the volcano, add baking soda along with some food colour to the vinegar. The volcano will erupt with effervescence which is generated due to the reaction of baking soda and vinegar thus releasing CO2 gas.\n\nRed Cabbage Indicator\n\nThe red cabbage that we eat consists of a natural pH indicator that we can use to identify the nature of various substances. Since not many people are aware of this natural indicator, you can use red cabbage to create a unique Science project for Class 8. First, extract the juice of red cabbage and take some paper cups. Now, you need a specific amount of the following items in each paper cup:\n\nMilk\n\nWater\n\nBaking Soda\n\nSoda Drink\n\nLemon Juice\n\nVinegar\n\nNow, pour the red cabbage juice into each cup until the colour of the liquid/powder [baking soda] changes. Note down your observations regarding the nature of acid and base in each item as indicated by the red cabbage and astonish your class with an amazing science experiment!\n\nPotato Battery\n\nDo you know that the potato we use in our food can actually convert chemical energy into electrical energy? As a potato has many nutrients that act as chemicals in a particular setup, it can be used as an electrical battery and thus a unique working model for your Class 8 science project! You need a few potatoes to create your own potato battery and the process is quite simple. Take two potatoes, zinc and copper electrodes, 6 alligator clips and a small bulb/digital clock. First, insert the zinc and copper electrodes in the potatoes and then use alligator clips to attach the electrodes with the clock or bulb [adult supervision necessary].\n\nYou will see that the potatoes will charge electrodes and then the clock or the bulb will turn on automatically.\n\nThermal Conductivity of Metals\n\nAmongst the most popular science projects for Class 8, you must have come across this one in day-to-day scenarios. Have you noticed that the pan in which we cook gets all heated up including the handles of it or the tong with which we cook our chapatis becomes hot? This is because of thermal conductivity in solids which means that the molecules of solids when heated up move in different directions and spread the heat. For your project, you can pick a bunch of solid items and check at which temperature the entire object gets heated up and up to which temperature.\n\nPinhole Camera\n\nYou must have come across various high-end cameras, but a pinhole camera is something that you can construct from simple household products. The camera does not contain any type of lens rather it is a light-proof box which has a small hole on one of its sides. Light from one side will fall into it and then by using its effort, it will reflect the picture on the other side of it. the image formed by this lens is inverted, thus, it becomes a tree basis of your entire project.\n\nScience Working Model for Class 8\n\nHere is a list of Science Working Models for Class 8:\n\nCreate your own Biodiesel\n\nAstronomical Telescope\n\nWind Turbine\n\nCotton Candy Machine\n\nPeriscope\n\nCreate a working model of the human heart\n\nBiogas plant\n\nSolar cell\n\nNow, let’s pick up some of these and learn how to make these models:\n\nCreate your own Biodiesel\n\nBiodiesel is made from vegetable oil and animal-fat based diesel fuel including long-chain alkyl and esters. Biodiesels are made by chemically reacting lipids, e.g., vegetable oils, animals with alcohol to produce fatty acid esters. The project is for renewable energy, physics, biology.\n\nAstronomical Telescope\n\nA telescope is an optical instrument to make observations to make distant objects look closer with an arrangement of lenses or curved mirrors. The rays of light are collected and focus on resulting in magnified images.\n\nCotton Candy Machine\n\nA cotton candy machine follows the same framework everywhere in the world and you can make it right at home. When sugar is heated, it becomes liquid caramel. If liquid caramel is pushed through tiny holes to the outside by centrifugal force when the container continuously rotates, cotton candy is made by recrystallization.\n\nCreate a working model of the human heart\n\nOne of the most famous working models is the human heart’s working model. The project only requires a physioball, PVC Pipe cap, balloons, and drip pipe. The project will barely take an hour to complete and you will be able to impress your teacher with it.\n\nAlso Read:\n\nFAQs"
