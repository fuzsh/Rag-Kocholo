        "text": "I don’t know you.\n\nI don’t know where you’re from or what you look like or how old you are. You might be a judge or a cook or a priest or a clown. I don’t know.\n\nBut what I’m pretty sure about is that at one point or another, you’ve been involved with most of the toys below. It’s just one of those things that we all have in common.\n\nLet’s go through them—\n\nAge when I became obsessed with it: 7\n\nAmount of time before I became bored with it: 1 week\n\nDownside: Gets dirty and loses stickiness; unclear exactly what you’re supposed to do with it; the torture of not being able to eat it\n\nOverall rating: 7/10\n\nComments: Odd that someone ever just decided to invent these, but I’m pleased that it happened. I may also like these more than most people do.\n\nToy: The Slinky\n\nAge when I became obsessed with it: 4\n\nAmount of time before I became bored with it: 1 month; recurring obsession\n\nDownside: Inevitable tangling\n\nOverall rating: 6/10\n\nComments: A new slinky ends up in my life once every two or three years. They’re great in theory, but always a little disappointing in practice.\n\nToy: The Thing With All the Pins\n\nAge when I became obsessed with it: 9\n\nAmount of time before I became bored with it: 4 minutes\n\nDownside: Putting it against your face is a somewhat violating life experience\n\nOverall rating: 5/10\n\nComments: Creative invention, but has limits. After I’ve done all the normal things I end up in a fairly dark place doing weird unfun things like pushing all the pins up together with my palm or pushing just a few edge pins up with my finger.\n\nToy: The Snap Bracelet\n\nAge when I became obsessed with it: 11\n\nAmount of time before I became bored with it: A week and a half\n\nDownside: They hurt a lot\n\nOverall rating: 4/10\n\nComments: You remember this whole thing, right? They’re a fidget toy more than anything, but in a spastic, stressful way. Not much room for nuance with a snap bracelet.\n\nToy: The Bead Thing in the Dentist’s Office\n\nAge when I became obsessed with it: 4\n\nAmount of time before I became bored with it: When it was time to see the dentist\n\nDownside: It kind of sucks\n\nOverall rating: 4/10\n\nComments: These things leave you with a sense of longing and the dread of pointlessness. It’s designed to mesmerize kids in a way where the kid is aware that it’s not worthy of mesmerization but is helpless to stop and do other things. Like sudoku for children.\n\nToy: Devil Sticks\n\nAge when I became obsessed with it: 15\n\nAmount of time before I became bored with it: 2 months\n\nDownside: It’s not a cool thing to be good at\n\nOverall rating: 6/10\n\nComments: My friend got these when I was 15 and I became obsessed with them for a period of time. Devil Sticks as an activity is one of the few things that really understands a pubescent 15-year-old boy, and vice versa.\n\nToy: The Ball and Cup\n\nAge when I became obsessed with it: 12\n\nAmount of time before I became bored with it: 20 minutes\n\nDownside: It leaves you feeling inadequate and irate\n\nOverall rating: 3/10\n\nComments: The kind of toy your dad used to play with in 1957.\n\nToy: The Hanging Ball Thing\n\nAge when I became obsessed with it: 6\n\nAmount of time before I became bored with it: 3 months; recurring obsession\n\nDownside: Not much\n\nOverall rating: 8.5/10\n\nComments: A delightful contraption. The only bad thing is that cheap ones suck and most people have cheap ones.\n\nToy: This thing\n\nAge when I became obsessed with it: 1\n\nAmount of time before I became bored with it: 1 second\n\nDownside: It’s not fun\n\nOverall rating: 2/10\n\nComments: For some reason, playing with this thing is a requirement of being 1, even though it’s groundbreakingly underwhelming.\n\nToy: Magnets in General\n\nAge when I became obsessed with it: 3\n\nAmount of time before I became bored with it: Never\n\nDownside: It can be frustrating when you can’t get repelling magnets to touch; after awhile the smooth coating wears off and the underlying rough metal seeps into your skin\n\nOverall rating: 9/10\n\nComments: The fidgeter’s best friend.\n\nToy: The Floating Globe\n\nAge when I became obsessed with it: 45 seconds ago\n\nAmount of time before I became bored with it: N/A\n\nDownside: None I could imagine\n\nOverall rating: 10/10?\n\nComments: I’ve never owned one of these, but came across this picture while searching for a picture of magnets. I’ve never laid eyes on something I’ve wanted as badly as I want this.\n\nToy: The Doll\n\nAge when I became obsessed with it: 5\n\nAmount of time before I became bored with it: When my dad took it away\n\nDownside: There’s not really any way to play with them, you just kind of spend time with them\n\nOverall rating: 3/10\n\nComments: The only way I’ve found to engage a doll is to swivel it up and down and watch the eye ball stay where it is. Also, searching for this photo led me to a Google Images search for “old doll” and I had to turn all the lights on and watch a sitcom for 20 minutes before my sense of self returned. What the hell.\n\nToy: The Super Soaker\n\nAge when I became obsessed with it: 11\n\nAmount of time before I became bored with it: 1 year\n\nDownside: Someone always has a radder and more expensive one than you\n\nOverall rating: 7.5/10\n\nComments: Teenagers need to enjoy these while they can, because there’s no endearing way to use one of them as an adult.\n\nToy: The Yo Yo\n\nAge when I became obsessed with it: 7\n\nAmount of time before I became bored with it: 1 week; recurring obsession\n\nDownside: The string gets twisted and then you have to stand there and let it spin itself untwisted while your limited time on this earth diminishes\n\nOverall rating: 5.5/10\n\nComments: Yo yos have their place, but bouncing them down and up quickly becomes meaningless, and yo yo tricks just don’t look very fun to do, so the hobby becomes unsustainable.\n\nToy: The balancing man\n\nAge when I became obsessed with it: 8\n\nAmount of time before I became bored with it: 3 months\n\nDownside: The possibilities are limited\n\nOverall rating: 7/10\n\nComments: My grandfather gave me one of these when I was 8, and my fascination bubbled over. Still not really sure how he just stands there and balances.\n\nToy: The Paper Clip\n\nAge when I became obsessed with it: 4\n\nAmount of time before I became bored with it: 10 minutes; recurring obsession\n\nDownside: The effort required to make one completely and perfectly straight isn’t worth the payoff\n\nOverall rating: 4/10\n\nComments: I’ll resort to the paper clip as a fidget toy when options are scarce, but it’s not a great situation.\n\nToy: Legos\n\nAge when I became obsessed with it: Never\n\nAmount of time before I became bored with it: Immediately\n\nDownside: They’re not fun at all\n\nOverall rating: 1/10\n\nComments: I’ve never understood the lego fetish. What the hell is fun about putting dumb legos together?\n\nToy: The Etch A Sketch\n\nAge when I became obsessed with it: 10\n\nAmount of time before I became bored with it: 1 minute; recurring obsession\n\nDownside: Everything you draw on it is horrible\n\nOverall rating: 2/10\n\nComments: An overrated toy. Who has ever had fun on an Etch A Sketch? Somehow though, it always ropes me back in.\n\nToy: The Far Flying Football\n\nAge when I became obsessed with it: 10\n\nAmount of time before I became bored with it: Until I lost it\n\nDownside: They give you false perceptions about your athletic ability\n\nOverall rating: 8/10\n\nComments: Never in any other situation will I be able to throw a football 70 yards. Similar appeal to the delicious Aerobie.\n\nToy: The Little Absurd Dog\n\nAge when I became obsessed with it: 13\n\nAmount of time before I became bored with it: 3 months; recurring obsession\n\nDownside: I’m allergic to them; they expire\n\nOverall rating: 7.5/10\n\nComments: Given my track record of quickly getting over toys, I’d be well-advised to avoid buying one of these. Tempting though.\n\nToy: Metal Puzzles\n\nAge when I became obsessed with it: 7\n\nAmount of time before I became bored with it: 1 terrible hour\n\nDownside: They’re upsetting and they lower your self-esteem\n\nOverall rating: 3/10\n\nComments: We needn’t discuss this further.\n\nToy: The Rubik’s Cube\n\nAge when I became obsessed with it: 21\n\nAmount of time before I became bored with it: 2 weeks\n\nDownside: The guilt you feel when people call you a genius because you solved it even though you used instructions and just did what they told you to do\n\nOverall rating: 8/10\n\nComments: Um\n\nToy: The Woodpecker on a Pole\n\nAge when I became obsessed with it: 13\n\nAmount of time before I became bored with it: 2 days\n\nDownside: The woodpecker has very few facets to his personality\n\nOverall rating: 5/10\n\nComments: Though delightful initially, playing with this is a passive and ultimately empty experience.\n\nToy: Stretch Armstrong\n\nAge when I became obsessed with it: 12\n\nAmount of time before I became bored with it: 3 years\n\nDownside: It breaks eventually, and the stuff comes out\n\nOverall rating: 8/10\n\nComments: That’s right. 3 years. I had a phase.\n\nToy: Silly Putty\n\nAge when I became obsessed with it: 6\n\nAmount of time before I became bored with it: 2 weeks; recurring obsession\n\nDownside: It eventually becomes disgusting\n\nOverall rating: 9/10\n\nComments: The rating is so high because I’m currently in the heat of one of my sporadic silly putty flings. A fidgeting masterpiece only paralleled by magnets.\n\nToy: The Mexican Jumping Bean\n\nAge when I became obsessed with it: N/A\n\nAmount of time before I became bored with it: N/A\n\nDownside: N/A\n\nOverall rating: N/A\n\nComments: I’ve never owned a Mexican Jumping Bean, but I wanted to put this picture on the site."
