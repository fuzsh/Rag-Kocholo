        "text": "Faraday’s law of electromagnetic induction, also known as Faraday’s law, is the basic law of electromagnetism which helps us predict how a magnetic field would interact with an electric circuit to produce an electromotive force (EMF). This phenomenon is known as electromagnetic induction.\n\nMichael Faraday proposed the laws of electromagnetic induction in the year 1831. Faraday’s law or the law of electromagnetic induction is the observation or results of the experiments conducted by Faraday. He performed three main experiments to discover the phenomenon of electromagnetic induction.\n\nTable of Contents:\n\nFaraday’s Laws of Electromagnetic Induction\n\nFaraday’s First Law of Electromagnetic Induction\n\nChanging the Magnetic Field Intensity in a Closed Loop\n\nFaraday’s Second Law of Electromagnetic Induction\n\nLenz’s Law\n\nFaraday’s Law Derivation\n\nFaraday’s Experiment Relationship between Induced EMF and Flux\n\nConclusion\n\nApplications of Faraday’s Law\n\nFrequently Asked Questions – FAQs\n\nFaraday’s Laws of Electromagnetic Induction\n\nFaraday’s Laws of Electromagnetic Induction consists of two laws. The first law describes the induction of emf in a conductor and the second law quantifies the emf produced in the conductor. In the next few sections, let us learn these laws in detail.\n\nFaraday’s First Law of Electromagnetic Induction\n\nThe discovery and understanding of electromagnetic induction are based on a long series of experiments carried out by Faraday and Henry. From the experimental observations, Faraday concluded that an emf is induced when the magnetic flux across the coil changes with time. Therefore, Faraday’s first law of electromagnetic induction states the following:\n\nWhenever a conductor is placed in a varying magnetic field, an electromotive force is induced. If the conductor circuit is closed, a current is induced, which is called induced current."
