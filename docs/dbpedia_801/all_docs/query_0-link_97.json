        "text": "– A –\n\nAAB —\n\nSee Add-A-Ball.\n\nAC —\n\nAlternating Current\n\nAction Ring —\n\nThis is a playfield feature comprised of a series of rebound rubbers stretched between posts and arranged in a circle or ring. In most instances, the center of this circle has a pop bumper. The ring of rubbers does not fully enclose this bumper, having one or more openings through which the ball in play can enter and exit the ring. While the ball is inside the ring, the close proximity of the rebound rubbers to the pop bumper allows for fast interaction with the ball for repetitive switch hits and quick scoring.\n\nChicago Coin used this feature on several of their games. In one instance, Chicago Coin's 1967 'Beatniks', the ring had two slingshots instead of a pop bumper.\n\nGottlieb used this feature on a few of their games and referred to it in their flyers as a \"semi-enclosed pop bumper\".\n\nWilliams used this feature on Williams' 1968 'Lady Luck' and referred to it in the flyer as a \"trap bumper\".\n\nA list of games identified with this feature can be found here.\n\nActive Bumper —\n\nSee Bumper.\n\nActual Measured Weight: —\n\nThis is the weight measured for us by an operator who has a commercial scale. The games are weighed without packaging. Legs are included, where noted. These games are used, not new, and so we cannot know if they were missing items that typically get separated from used games such as a coin box or one or more coin acceptance mechanisms. This would only slightly affect the measured weight.\n\nAdd-A-Ball —\n\nA feature designed to provide a reward to the player in regions where replays (free games) were outlawed as a thing of value, making pinball into gambling. Add-A-Ball games allow the player to be awarded multiple additional balls, and usually include a counter showing balls remaining to play (\"Balls to Play\" rather than the usual \"Ball in Play\") that is incremented as each ball is awarded. Note that this is different from the feature of awarding an extra ball (common to many games) because those games do not change the ball counter when the extra ball is played, and often can only award a single outstanding extra ball at any given time. Therefore, a machine is a true Add-a-ball machine only if you can earn more than one extra ball per ball in play. Most machines are a replay type where a special scores a free credit and only one extra ball can be awarded per ball in play.\n\nAdd-a-ball games start a ball counter at the original number of balls given to a player at the start of the game and then award the player additional balls as objectives are met, incrementing the \"current ball\" count for each one.\n\nEarly add-a-ball games had individually lighted numbers on the backglass indicating the current ball count. These were usually completely separate models from the non-Add-a-ball games (even of the same name), but in later years an Add-A-Ball \"Option\" was instead built into a single model, allowing use as either an Add-A-Ball game, a replay game, or a novelty play game, depending of what the government rules in effect at the location.\n\nBecause some locations even disallowed the display of the replay or add-a-ball totals wheel, some games came with a sticker to cover the replay counter. Some games would even \"hide\" the extra ball count in backglass graphics that could not be seen until an additional ball was added.\n\nGottlieb games can usually award up to 5 additional balls at any one time. If one or more of these additional balls are awarded, they are all played before the main ball counter decrements. So you could win up to 5 balls during the play of 5 regular balls, or a total of up to 25 extra balls. Gottlieb called this the \"WOW\" feature. For Williams games, the ball counter started at 5 balls and awarded balls could raise the total to as 10 balls at one time.\n\nAlvin Gottlieb created the concept which was then designed by Wayne Neyens.\n\nAerial Spinning Posts —\n\nSee Spinning Post.\n\nAlphanumeric Display —\n\nSegmented plasma displays (not LEDs which are much dimmer) that can display letters as well as numbers. They work by energizing various segments of the display to form the correct character shape. These displays usually use Neon gas, which glows orange when ionized by a high voltage electric current passed through the segment.\n\nGottlieb also used cathodic tubes, (which are distinctive with their blue glow, or green if translucent green plastic has been placed over the display such as on Gottlieb's 1982 'Haunted House'), in which the high voltage current flow causes a flourescent material on the inside of the segments to glow, much like in a tube television. These were available in 4, 6, 7, and 20 character tubes.\n\nNote that some LED displays were used by a very few exotic manufacturers, mostly in Europe.\n\nThis type of display has been replaced by the more modern dot matrix display (DMD) which can also display graphics.\n\nAlphanumeric display from WMS's 1990 'Funhouse'\n\nAlvin G. & Co. —\n\nPinball manufacturer whose first machine (A.G. Soccer-Ball) was released in 1992. Other games include USA Football and Al's Garage Band Goes on World Tour.\n\nAnimation —\n\nOn dot matrix displays, any animated graphics sequence. Animations are commonly used as introductions to modes, multiball, and at the start of the game.\n\nBackgl​ass light animation involves lighting up various images or symbols on the backglass outside of the score displays. Playing cards light up when earned during play on Williams' 1964 'River Boat'. Ice skaters light up when earned during play and also flash during Game Over on Gottlieb's 1965 'Ice-Revue'. Other games have lights that illuminated different colored masks to produce the illusion of movement.\n\nSee also Mechanical Backbox Animation.\n\nApron —\n\nThe large attachment at the very bottom of the playfield, which usually holds a score and/or instruction card and which covers the ball trough. The front edges of the apron lead the ball to the drain.\n\nAlso called a Card Holder.\n\nAuto-percentaging —\n\nIn solid-state games, an operator adjustment that controls the frequency of awarded replays as compared to total games played. On these games, the replay score thresholds are not printed on cards displayed on the playfield apron but appear on the backbox score displays at Game Over. If the auto-percentaging option is turned OFF, the replay award thresholds are the same values from game to game, as previously set by the operator. If the option is turned ON, the operator sets a percentage, usually 5% to 50%, by which the game will periodically recalculate the replay award thresholds, up or down, based on how well players have been earning replays up to that point, in order to mathematically maintain the desired ratio of free plays to total plays. The game will display the recalculated replay score thresholds at Game Over.\n\nThe first solid-state pin game to have this feature was Williams' 1986 'High Speed'.\n\nAn earlier electro-mechanical pin game to have this feature was Williams' 1949 'St. Louis' where only the first of four replay thresholds was automatically adjusted up or down by the machine, based on game play.\n\nSee also Reflexing Feature.\n\nAutomatic Flipper —\n\nFor electro-mechanical games, this is a flipper that is controlled exclusively by the game, the player cannot activate this flipper, and the sensor that detects the proximity of the ball to this flipper is actually a switch in front of the flipper, often in a recessed well.\n\nA list of games identified with this feature can be found here.\n\nRally-Play, a French manufacturer, advertised 'automatic flippers' or 'flippers automatiques\" but they were referring to slingshots.\n\nFor solid-state games, see game-controlled flipper.\n\nAutomatic Replay Percentaging —\n\nSee Auto-percentaging.\n\nAutoplunger —\n\nMany newer games feature an automatic plunger that launches the ball at the touch of a button, or which the game uses to launch additional balls into play for various reasons — for example, to launch additional balls onto the playfield for multiball.\n\n– B –\n\nBack Rack —\n\nAn older term for the backbox.\n\nBackbox —\n\nAlso called a lightbox. The upright part of a pinball machine that holds the backglass and any displays and scoring mechanisms (score reels, lighting, etc.) In modern games, it also contains the circuit boards which control the machine. The backbox is also known as the head as compared to the cabinet which is also known as the body. An older term for the backbox is back rack.\n\nBackbox of Hayburners II\n\nBackbox Insert —\n\nThe board inside the backbox upon which the score displays and illumination lamps are mounted. On EM games, relays and stepper switches are also mounted on this board.\n\nIn many games, this insert hinges outward from the front after the backglass has been lifted up and out of the game, allowing access to both sides of it. An example with an illustrative picture is Williams' 1986 'PIN·BOT'.\n\nIn other games, the backglass hinges outward within its own frame while the insert itself does not hinge and remains fixed. An example with an illustrative picture is Williams' 1965 'Alpine Club'.\n\nIn yet other games, the backglass remains fixed while the insert hinges outward from the back after the backbox back door has been lifted up and out of the game. An example with an illustrative picture is Gottlieb's 1965 'Pleasure Isle'.\n\nAnd, in yet other games, the backglass slides out sideways, or upwards, after a piece of wood trim is removed. The insert remains fixed to the cabinet. An example of this is Williams' 1954 'Big Ben'. An example with an illustrative picture is Keeney's 1962 'Hacienda'.\n\nBackbox Spinner —\n\nIn most cases, a large, round scoring device mounted into the backbox visible to the player through a clear, unpainted area of the backglass. An arrow is attached to a center fulcrum inside the unit. Point values, extra balls, and/or Specials are identified on the backglass at equidistant positions around the perimeter of this unit. Typically, a ball landing in a playfield kick-out hole will lock in that hole, the arrow will spin around and stop at a value, the value is scored to the player, and the ball is ejected from the hole. The spinner may also be activated by a ball draining via an outlane. An example of this is found on Williams' 1970 'Jive Time'.\n\nAlso called a Backglass Spinner.\n\nSee also Spinning Lights.\n\nBackglass —\n\nThe glass within the front of the backbox, with ink artwork silk-screened onto the back of it. Since it is the most visible part of the game and has to attract players, the artwork is often spectacular. (In modern games, the artwork may actually be a translite.)\n\nBeing glass, backglasses are fragile and subject to peeling over time. They are also more restricted than translites in the type of artwork which can be produced, although their color is generally more brilliant than that of a translite.\n\nBackglass of Toledo\n\nBackglass Marquee —\n\nAn area of the backglass not silkscreened, allowing the location to display their name or other customized information from behind the backglass and visible to the player. This feature is found on many Williams games of the 1960's, in the lower edge of the backglass. An example with illustrative pictures is Williams' 1965 'Pot 'O' Gold'. When the game is turned on, this marquee will illuminate from behind.\n\nBackglass Spinner —\n\nSee Backbox Spinner.\n\nBagatelle —\n\nA bagatelle resembles a light, flat board with nails (pins!) in it and short raised sides to keep the ball on the playfield during play. Each ball is launched from some sort of shooter or pusher to the top of the playfield, where it then rolls towards the player, bouncing off the pins or landing in any of several scoring pockets. These scoring pockets can be depressions in the playfield, nails arranged in a U-shape, or both. They are marked with various score values, with the higher values usually protected by more pins or tougher paths to reach them. By \"shooting\" the ball harder or softer, the player can try to control where the ball drops.\n\nThe earliest relative of the modern pinball machines, bagatelles consist of a basic construction of a frame around a playfield. They have no flippers, bumpers, ramps or other mechanical items normally found on a pinball machine, nor do they contain lights, sounds, or power sources. They have no playfield glass and, with rare exception, are not coin-operated.\n\nBagatelles are still being manufactured today, although most modern versions are made from plastic and can be found primarily in toy stores.\n\nBall Eater Target —\n\nA cube-shaped target with a hollow interior allowing the ball to fully enter it from the front, causing it to drop below the playfield with the ball trapped inside, making the cube's top surface flush with the playfield to allow another ball to easily roll over it. The ball remains there until other playfield events reset this target to pop up and release the locked ball back into play.\n\nOnly three pinball machines have been found to use this unique device so far:\n\nBally Midway's 1987 'Dungeon and Dragons' manual called it a Teleport Drop Target Assembly.\n\nData East's 1988 'Secret Service' flyer called it a resetable ball eating target while the manuals called it a Ball Eater or Target Eater.\n\nBally Midway's 1989 'Mousin' Around' manual referred to them as Tr ap (Ball Eater) Assemblies.\n\nBall Popper —\n\nAnother name for a Vertical Up-Kicker.\n\nBall Return Feature —\n\nSee Hold Feature.\n\nBall Saver —\n\nThis term describes either of two different ways to extend game play.\n\n1) A physical device that rises up between the flip​pers during game play to prevent the ball from draining, found on many EM games and some SS games. During 1950-1951, Gottlieb and Chicago Coin used a V-shaped metal wall between the flippers for this purpose and referred to it as a Blocking Gate or Safety Gate. The first known example of a round version of this gate is found on Rally's 1967 'Play boy' and this shape is commonly known as an Up-post. Chicago Coin used the term \"Ball Saver\" to introduce this round Up-post to their games, starting with Chicago Coin's 1968 'Gun Smoke'. See also Up-post.\n\n2) A software-programmed time limit found on SS games only, not requiring a physical device between the flippers. The game is programmed to return a drained ball to the plunger within the first few seconds of play, until the set time expires. If the game has an autoplunger, it will often shoot the ball back into play automatically along with an audio cue and an animation. Many games also activate this feature at the start of multiball, when players may not be expecting additional balls on the playfield. Programmed ball savers are a recent feature, introduced around 1990. Most games with this feature will return the drained ball once, although some games can be configured to return it more than once if it is lost again within the ball saver time window. On most games, the time limit for this feature can be adjusted by the operator or turned off altogether. Sometimes this feature takes the form of a minimum game time, as in Stern's 1982 'Orbitor 1', where the last ball in play can get returned to the plunger repeatedly until the set time expires.\n\nBall Search —\n\nWhen a machine has not seen any scoring in a few seconds and thinks the ball may be stuck, it will quickly activate each solenoid in the machine in turn, to help a ball become unstuck if it happens to be mechanically hung up, or in case the ball has been captured by a playfield mechanism with a faulty indicator switch. This procedure is called a 'ball search', and may happen several times before the game either shuts down or ejects a replacement pinball.\n\nBally/Williams —\n\nOne of the most successful manufacturers of pinball machines, Bally/Williams is the result of a Williams buying Bally.\n\nBang Back —\n\nA Bang Back is a method of saving a ball that has rolled down an outlane. By holding up the flipper on the side the ball is coming down, and hitting the front of the cabinet when the ball reaches the base of the flipper, the ball can be made to bounce off the playfield arch and back onto the opposite flipper. See Skills for the Pinball Wiz​ard for an ani​mation of this technique.\n\nBar Target —\n\nA type of standup target that uses a long rectangular piece of plastic as its target surface instead of the familiar smaller round or square plastic. The length of this plastic replaces what might otherwise have been three or four individual conventional standup targets. This plastic is supported by a switch attached at each end. Because it's one target, closing either switch scores this target to light up (or turn off) the next of several playfield inserts in front of it.\n\nBecause two switches are used, Stern's game manuals may refer to it as a dual target even though it may be responsible for three or more playfield inserts.\n\nA list of games identified with this feature can be found here.\n\nBash Toy —\n\nA toy or figurine with a target switch built inside its base. A ball hitting the figurine scores the target. The figurine typically is of a person or object specific to the theme of the game.\n\nOne example is the Genie Toy on Williams' 1996 'Tales of the Arabian Nights'.\n\nAnother example is the Wolverine Toy on Stern's 2012 'X-Men Wolverine LE'.\n\nBat Game —\n\nPitch & Bat games are characterized by a game design similar to baseball, in which a bat is used instead of flippers to hit the pinball towards targets and holes at the far end of the playfield. Instead of a plunger, these games usually have a pitching mechanism which shoots the pinball towards the bat at a speed and direction often controlled by a second player.\n\nThe playfields are usually quite bare compared to pinball machines, having no bumpers, ball guides or lights like pinball machines, but because they share many of the same mechanical elements as pinball machines, they are included in the database.\n\nThe playfield usually contains only the targets and holes, labeled with possible pitch results such as single, double, out, etc., and sometimes some small jumps and a second level of targets/holes at the back. Some games even mimic the players running around the bases, often with mechanical figures in the backbox running around a baseball diamond.\n\nBell Timer —\n\nA Time Clock that has a clapper to ring a bell when the time is up.\n\nBeta Test —\n\nBefore a game is produced for the open market, a small number of prototypes are produced, and these are sent to selected sites for testing so that the manufacturer can find out how well the game rules and playfield layout performs in real play. The beta test usually leads to minor changes in the playfield and changes to the software.\n\nBigliardino Elettrico —\n\nLiterally, \"electric billiard\". Also seen as \"biliardino elettrico\" and \"\"nuovo bigliardino elettrico\".\n\nThese words appeared on backglasses for games made for Italy, not necessarily games made in Italy, as a direct result of Law 507 passed in Italy on May 12, 1965 which prohibited flipper pinball machines as gambling because the replays were deemed a thing of value. As a result of this law, pinball machines were still seen in Italy but the word \"flipper\" had been banished from appearing anywhere on the game and players could only earn added balls to extend game play. Even then, the backglass would surreptitiously indicate the presence of earned added balls by lighting unnumbered and innocent-looking art elements on the backglass, such as round balls or stars, that blended into the art around it.\n\nFederico Croci, a collector and historian in Italy, provides us the following information:\n\nBefore that law, there was no need to have a new name for the flip per game, let alone written in italian on the bac kglass; everyone was calling him 'fli pper' (actually, this one remained the unofficial name even after the law, amongst players and ope rators), but now, being the 'fli pper' a forbidden game, there was the need to show that these new machines were totally new games, actually a \"bigliardino elettrico\" (=\"electric billiard\"). On some games there is written 'biliardino' instead of 'bigliardino', that's the same. Also note that some other kind of fli pper games, for example toys for kids, were still called 'fli pper' with no problem. It was a forbidden word only regarding coin-op games.\n\nActually, history is that the italian importer of Gottlieb's games of the time, as soon as he learned of the new game, called the manu facturer asking for every new game to have the words \"nuovo bigliardino elettrico\" ('nuovo'='new', after a few games 'nuovo' was dropped), believing it could help in distinguish it from the the 'usual' fli pper games, as the police was starting to check bars and arcades for the now forbidden games. It proved successful in at least a dozen of cases, so even some italian man ufacturers of the time, and other european man ufacturers, sometime used to include in the back glass or in the instructions the same (or similar) words. Bally made italian language instruction cards with the same words, as well as Williams.\n\n10/30/2017\n\nBingo Machine —\n\nBingo games are those games that usually have the following characteristics: no flippers, numbered holes on the playfield in which the balls are captured, Bingo cards displayed on the backglass along with the various odds that can usually be changed by depositing more coins, and replay counters that normally count up to 999 replays to count the awards received.\n\nAs balls fall into the playfield holes, the corresponding numbers are lit up on the Bingo card(s) on the backglass. The ball will then stay into that hole until the end of the game. Bingo games normally have 5 balls per game -- to make them distinctive from the one-ball machines made illegal in most areas -- and (similar to normal Bingo) awards can usually be won by getting three to five numbers in a row on one of the Bingo cards, with larger awards for more numbers in a row or more coins deposited to raise the odds. Players can either play off the replays earned or have the owner exchange them for cash or prizes.\n\nBingo games have their roots in a 16th century Italian lottery game named Beano, later renamed to Bingo. They are a result of the early desire to reward players with money, free games and awards. Early games to accomplish this were single ball games with horse and dog racing themes. The (Federal Government's) Johnson Act of 1950 caused the demise of one-ball horse racing machines because it outlawed and made a federal offense the inter-state shipment of gambling devices, manuals and repair parts except to states where the devices were legal, and many areas had already declared them illegal since they were deemed a game of chance rather than a game of skill. (The addition of flippers on later pinball machines caused them to be considered a game of skill since the player could have much more affect on the resulting score.) Since horse/dog racing games were usually one-ball games, and since most areas declared specifically that \"one-ball\" games were illegal, the manufacturers could see that further production of those types of games would be impractical and so switched to the five ball Bingo designs.\n\nYou may also want to read an article titled PINGAMES AND GAMBLING - An Historical Survey by Russ Jensen for more historical information on Bingo machines and the laws affecting them.\n\nBiri-biri —\n\nA repetitive electronic tune indicating that the player had reached a high score. This is a feature found in some Italian-made pinball machines of the 1970's.\n\nSome Italian manufacturers during the 1970's installed electronic sound devices in their games to replace the standard metal bells. Older games could also be retrofitted with these devices. The electronic sounds they emitted were rudimentary in comparison to today's capabilities and might be described as monophonic. These devices, while acting in place of bells, could also be made to emit a tune at achieving a high score, and this tune was called the \"biri-biri sound\". No obvious award was necessarily tied to getting a machine to produce this sound, but the location might give a free drink to the player.\n\nTo listen to the biri-biri sound, visit Federico Croci's webpage: http://www.tilt.it/biribiri.htm\n\nBlocking Gate —\n\nThe metal, V-shaped ball-saving device that would raise and lower between flippers on some Gottlieb and Chicago Coin games during 1950-1951. It's purpose was to close the flipper gap and route balls to either flipper for flipping back into play. It is the precedessor of the round plastic Up-post used in 1960's games and later. Gottlieb also referred to this device as a Safety Gate.\n\nAn example of this feature can be found on Chicago Coin's 1951 'Thing'.\n\nBody —\n\nSee Cabinet.\n\nBOM —\n\nBill of Materials. As documented on this site, it's the total cost to the manufacturer of the parts for 1 game, expressed in US dollars.\n\nA more complete definition is coming.\n\nBonus Ladder —\n\nSee End-of-Ball Bonus.\n\nBullseye target —\n\nA standup target consisting of a broad target surface (the outer ring) with a hole in its center (the bullseye) through which a separate narrow pin protrudes from behind. Both the outer ring and bullseye pin operate their own switch for scoring. A ball can hit the ring and miss the bullseye pin, or hit the bullseye pin without hitting the ring, or with force or angle can hit both bullseye pin and ring for a combined score. Gottlieb used this type of target on games made from the later 1950's to early 1960's, such as Gottlieb's 1960 'Seven Seas', where the outer ring was painted with the familiar target rings. It appeared again on Premier's 1993 'Tee'd Off' but without the target rings.\n\nSome Gottlieb games used these targets but without the center bullseye pin. One game that had this type is Gottlieb's 1962 'Preview'.\n\nBumper —\n\nBumpers are round, mushroom-shaped targets set into the playfield of most pinball machines. They fall into two categories: active and passive. Both types register a hit when the ball collides with them.\n\nActive bumpers, the most common, forcefully kick the ball away when struck.\n\nPassive bumpers look similar to active bumpers, but do not kick the ball when hit. See also the passive Tower Bumper.\n\nMushroom bumpers are passive bumpers, each is a post having a disk on top. When the ball approaches the bumper and strikes the post, it lifts the disk. The disk is attached to a shaft down the middle of the post, and this shaft rises when the disk is lifted, activating a leaf switch which registers the hit. Bally popularized this bumper in the 1960s and 1970s starting with Bally's 1963 'Hootenanny', and European games followed in its use. While Bally is popularly credited with the first use of mushroom bumpers, Stoner used them during 1939-40 on Stoner's 1939 'Ali-Baba' and Stoner's 1940 'Fantasy'.\n\nActive bumpers have been given various names. According to the book All About Pinball, Williams called them thumper bumpers on their 1948 game Saratoga but eventually decided to use the shorter term jet bumpers. Gottlieb first used the term percussion bumpers on their 1949 \"Bowling Champ\" game but eventually changed to the term pop bumpers. Genco called them power bumpers. Bally called them thumper bumpers.\n\nDisappearing bumpers are active bumpers with flat plastic tops in place of standard bumper caps and that are mechanically lowered to be below the playfield when dictated by game rules. When lowered, the flat top of the bumper is flush with the playfield surface as if the bumper was not there.\n\nA list of games with a disappearing bumper is here.\n\nThe invention of the bumper in 1936 replaced the well-known pins and pockets. Balls would now exit the playfield after play, while the score would appear on the backglass. Before, players had to visually add up their score from the balls that had landed in playfield pockets and remained in them until the start of a new game.\n\nA thumper bumper from Bally's 1975 'Freedom'.\n\nBuy-Back —\n\nThis term was used as far back as the 1930s by multiple manufacturers to describe a feature allowing the player to in​sert a coin during a game in progress to allow balls that have been played and are sitting in the outhole to return to the ball shooter to be played again but without starting a new game. In this way, the player is extending the length of the game in progress but at an additional cost per \"extra\" ball. The cost for each extra ball would be the same price as it took to start the game. Depending on the game, this feature might be a standard item equipped from the factory or might be an optional attachment at extra cost to the operator. Also, there may be a limit to the number of extra balls the player can purchase per game, such as three maximum, or the game may allow an unlimited amount.\n\nA list of games identified with this feature can be found here.\n\nThe Buy-back feature on pin games did not outlast the 1950s. When it reappeared in solid state games, it was known as the Buy-In.\n\nBuy-In —\n\nThis term describes an operator option to extend the length of the game being played beyond what was purchased with a coin or credit. Of the games that appear in this database, the first (solid state) game to have it is Bally Midway's 1988 'Blackwater 100'.\n\nWilliams/Bally/Midway also used this term and feature in their pinball machines manufactured during 1993 to 1995. For each player, after the last ball has been played, the player can press a specially-marked button on the front of the cabinet to extend the game by buying an extra ball, usually at the cost of 1 credit. If this is done, the game will not go to Game Over but will continue where it left off for that player, typically with extra features or modes that were not previously activated or available to achieve. Some pinball machines with this feature will allow only one buy-in extra ball per game per player. Other machines will provide higher maximums, such as 3, 9, or an unlimited number of buy-in extra balls per player. The button for this feature is located either below the left-side Start button or below the right-side ball shooter knob. On Williams games, this button will be marked EXTRA BALL or SUPER BALL.\n\nCapcom, Data East, and Spinball are examples of other manufacturers that used this feature on one or more of their games.\n\nA list of games identified with this feature can be found here.\n\nBuy-in was a term used by manufacturers of solid state machines. When this feature appeared in EM games of the 1930s to 1950s, it was known as Buy-Back.\n\n– C –\n\nCabinet —\n\nThe large lower box that holds the playfield, coin box, and flipper buttons. It often has color attention-attracting graphics, especially on later model games with detailed many-color side art. Not to be confused with the backbox. The cabinet is also known as the 'body'.\n\nCabinet Insert —\n\nA broad, flat wooden board bolted to the inside bottom of the lower cabinet upon which relays and other electromechanical components are mounted. Because an EM game will have its motor attached to this insert, it is also known as a motor board.\n\nCaptive Ball —\n\nA ball that is restricted to a small area of the playfield or backbox. It is separate from the ball in play. The captive ball sits at rest until propelled into motion by either the ball in play or by a kicker upon which the captive ball was resting. Then, it moves within its defined area. The simplest version is the messenger ball, a special kind of target that consists of a pinball held captive at the end of a lane or ramp with a switch at the far end, such as shown in the picture below.\n\nOther arrangements include:\n\nA curved captive ball lane, as on Gottlieb's 1974 'Magnotron'.\n\nA bagatelle on the playfield as on Williams' 1954 'Big Ben' or in the backbox as on Williams' 1966 'Casanova'.\n\nA mini-playfield containing both captive ball and dedicated flippers as on Bally's 1981 'Elektra'.\n\nSee also captive ball spinner.\n\nLeft:Diagram of captive ball setup. Right: Captive balls and target from Capcom's 1996 'Breakshot'\n\nCaptive Ball Advance —\n\nOn this site, it's a playfield arrangement most frequently found on games in the 1930s where a captive ball device releases the ball to another captive ball device. This can either be a series of kick-out holes or a series of ball kickers. On some games, the last hole in the series holds the ball to the end of the game, acting as a trap hole. On other games, it will return the ball to the player to shoot it back into play.\n\nTransfer of balls between these serial captive ball devices are not necessarily immediate and may require the player to first achieve a playfield objective using a separate ball in play. If the game ends before balls are cleared from this series of devices, in most games each stage of capture awards a point score value.\n\nSome games advance captive balls inside an enclosed area of the playfield and these balls are never available as a ball-in-play. In these instances, again, either kick-out holes or ball kickers may be used. Point values may be assigned to intermediate stages of capture.\n\nA list of games identified with this feature can be found here.\n\nSee also Captive Ball Walker.\n\nCaptive Ball Kick-out Hole —\n\nMost kick-out holes immediately award points and kick the ball back into play. A captive ball kick-out hole does not immediately kick the ball back into play but keeps it captive until the player achieves some other playfield objective, then kicks it out.\n\nA list of games identified with this feature can be found here.\n\nCaptive Ball Spinner —\n\nA scoring device consisting of a large metal wheel and a small steel ball enclosed in an area not accessible by the ball in play. The wheel has small trap holes all along its outside edge. When activated, the wheel spins around its central axis, causing its captive ball to randomly roll around with it. The wheel generally stops abruptly, and the rolling ball eventually falls into one of the trap holes to award the indicated hole value. This device first appeared on Williams' 1966 'A-Go-Go'. Also referred to as a Roulette Wheel.\n\nCaptive Ball Spinner from Williams' 1966 'A-Go-Go'.\n\nCaptive Ball Walker —\n\nThis term is used on this site to identify a specific style of electro-mechanical playfield device that captures a ball in play and delays its release back into play, holding it in each of three sequential positions on its length, advancing the ball to its next position only when the player achieves a playfield objective using a different ball in play. From its last position, the ball is released back into play, creating multiball. This long device requires a lane of its own on the playfield to show the player the different stages of the ball's capture. On some games, more than one ball can be captured in this device simultaneously. A single solenoid is used to operate this device to walk the balls. Typically, points may be awarded for a ball entering the device but no additional points are awarded for balls being walked through the device.\n\nBally was first to use this device. In their undated First Edition An Introduction to Bally Fli pper Games, Bally referred to it as the Capti ve Ball Escapement Assembly and stated it was designed and patented by them. Their first game with this patented device was Bally's 1964 'Mad World'. In their 1965 Parts Catalog, they referred to it as a 4 Steps Free Ball Escape Assy. (The four steps are capture-transfer-transfer-release.)\n\nStern used a similarly-designed device on their Stern's 1980 'Flight 2000' and its manual referred to it as a Ball Launcher Assembly. In their manual for Stern's 1981 'Freefall', it was listed as a Ball Walker Assembly.\n\nA list of games identified with this feature can be found here.\n\nEarlier games used Captive Ball Advance where balls may or may not return to play and most often scored points when resting in their intermediate positions. Sometimes referred to as progressive scoring.\n\nCard Holder —\n\nSee Apron.\n\nCarom Spinner —\n\nSee Spinning Bumper.\n\nCarombolette Table —\n\nA large table game that looks like a billiard table but it has no pockets like a billiard table has. The entire playing surface is covered with felt except for one end which has a built-in bagatelle. The players stand at the felt end of the table and use cue sticks to shoot the balls towards and onto the bagatelle.\n\nAn example of this type of game is Unknown Manufacturer's 'Carombolette Table'.\n\nBilliard Boards were sold to allow a regular billiard table to be converted to a carombolette table. An example of this is H. P. Schafer's 'Combination Recreation Board'.\n\nCarousel roto-target —\n\nSee longer explanation under Roto-target.\n\nCarry-over —\n\nA sequence during game play that increases towards a goal such as extra points, an extra ball, or a replay, and does not reset to the beginning of the sequence at the start of a new game. Instead, the position in the sequence carries over to the next game as the starting point for the new game. This sequence is often featured prominently on the backglass to entice players to play the machine again.\n\nAs described above, this term primarily describes a feature that carries-over from game-to-game, but it can also be used to describe a feature that carries-over from player-to-player during multiple-player games.\n\nCatch —\n\nWhen the ball is held in a V formed by an upraised flipper and the lower part of the inlane.\n\nCellar Hole —\n\nA ramp below the playfield, entered through a hole in the playfield.\n\nCenter Post —\n\nA stationary rubbered post or pin set between and inline with the bottom pair of flippers. Gottlieb/Premier used a center post on many of their games. Not to be confused with an Up-post.\n\nCheck Separator —\n\nAlso called a trade check separator, it's a device used in coin payout machines of some 1930's games to determine whether the coin inserted by the player is a real nickel or a trade check (a token). Trade checks each had a hole in their center, allowing a detecting pin in the separator to recognize them as different from nickels and route them to the payout tube for future payout. Coins were routed to the cashbox.\n\nCheck separators were often an operator option at extra cost.\n\nInvented by Charles Fey for his Liberty Bell slot machines which were the first mechanical slot machines, also invented by him.\n\nChicane Lane —\n\nA lane with several curves to it, and a ball rolling through this lane will exhibit a zig-zag or wiggling motion on its way down. The lane usually has inserts in its path to light what awards or features will be earned by a ball passing through it. The curving aspect of the lane slows the ball down.\n\nA list of games identified with this feature can be found here.\n\nChromium Steel —\n\nThis is not steel that has been dipped in chrome to give it that brilliantly shiny veneer finish of which we are all familiar. It is steel that has been alloyed with chromium to make it resistant to corrosion. Stainless steel contains at least 10.5% chromium.\n\nClear Coated Playfield —\n\nA playfield which has had any of several choices of coatings (such as Varathane) applied to the playing surface for purposes of restoration, protection, or aesthetics. This term generally refers to coatings applied after the playfield left the factory, and is not the same finish that the manufacturer had used. However, Williams, for instance, in around 1990 began producing playfields clearly marked as \"diamond-plated\" which had a clear coated finish.\n\nThis finish almost always produces a strikingly polished and reflective surface, more than the playfield possessed when it came from the factory. Thus the practice goes beyond the protective effect of a good waxing by adding a permanent visual effect. For IPDB purposes, these playfields do not show users how the game looked when first produced.\n\nCocktail Table —\n\nThese machines are smaller versions of the standard pinball machine, usually about the size of a cocktail table, from where they get their name. These machines have no backbox and the playfield top glass is unsloped and horizontal, allowing drinks to be placed on it. These machines were developed for locations that did not have the room for a standard-sized pinball machine. Play is similar to other games, and the score and play information is usually displayed on the cardholder at the \"bottom\" of the playfield near the player.\n\nCoil —\n\nSee Solenoid.\n\nCoil Sleeve —\n\nA plastic or nylon (and sometimes aluminum in older games) sleeve that passes through the center of a solenoid, and in which the metal slug moves when the solenoid is engaged. The coil sleeve must be clean and smooth or the metal slug can hang and bind when the solenoid is activated.\n\nCoining —\n\nInserting a coin to start a game or to add credits (replays) to the credit meter.\n\nCombo —\n\nA defined sequence of shots that need to made in rapid successions without missing are called combos.\n\nConsole Cabinet —\n\nMost often, this term describes a floor-standing machine that has wood panel sides extending down to the floor on all four sides, instead of four individual legs. An early example of this is C. F. Eckhart & Company's 1933 'Wahoo'. Some pinball machines were made in two versions: with individual legs and as a console, such as Keeney's 1947 'Cover Girl'\n\nIn some styles, the back portion of the cabinet will extend to the floor as one piece with only the front end supported by two individual legs. Games such as United's 1962 'Bonus Baseball' might be described as having a console cabinet.\n\nOther consoles are too small to have any individual legs, and the cabinets rest on the floor. An example is Genco's 1952 '400'.\n\nConversion Kit —\n\nConversion kits were designed to allow an owner/operator to convert one game into another while reusing the most significant portions of the previous game to save on cost. Note that these differ from the Converted Games in that the owner/operator makes the conversion rather than the game being converted at a manufacturer's location.\n\nConversion kits usually contained a backglass and instruction cards, and sometimes a new wired playfield (that plugged into the old connections) but which reused the electromechanical or solid state controllers, cabinet, cabinet art, coin mechanisms, scoring mechanisms, etc. Some conversion kits included additional items, such as cabinet side decals, new game roms, manuals and miscellaneous other items. Some later kits even contained new solid state electronic boards to upgrade the control system.\n\nIn kits where only only a backglass and instruction cards were included, the game play and scoring was not changed in any way and the original manufacturer's name was often still on the game, which can lead to confusion regarding the status of similar games and their manufacturer.\n\nBecause the controllers were usually reused, conversion kits were designed to convert one specific game into another.\n\nConverted Game —\n\nSimilar to the Conversion Kit games, these were also conversions of one game into another, reusing a significant portion of the previous game, such as the cabinet, score mechanisms, etc.\n\nUnlike conversion kits, which were designed to be installed by the owner/operator in the field, converted games were converted at a manufacturer�€™s facilities (and usually not by the original manufacturer) and then sold as \"new\" games by the new manufacturer. This process became popular during World War II when a ban — announced March-26-1942 — was placed on the manufacture of new pinball machines beginning May-01-1942 and lasting four years until May-1946, when the ban was finally lifted.\n\nConverted games were remanufactured several ways. Some games were given a new backglass and playfield, while others were given little more than minor playfield changes, such as a retouching of the original playfield art. Some conversion manufacturers, such as Victory Games, would not even remove the original manufacturer�€™s name from the machine. Other conversions would go as far as completely stripping the components from the game and rebuilding it with a new theme, possibly rescreening the playfield, and even including new side art, manuals, score cards, etc. in addition to a new backglass.\n\nOwners would often send in their games to be converted, but manufacturers also purchased games on their own to convert and, using additional parts available from stock, resell to a different owner.\n\nA number of new companies were created solely for the purpose of offering pinball machine conversions. According to the Pinball Collectors Resource (by Robert Hawkins & Donald Mueting), there were only four manufacturers of pinball machines from before the ban that were still producing them when the ban was lifted!\n\nSee also Re-themed Game.\n\nCounter Game —\n\nSee Table Top Game.\n\nCredit Dot —\n\nA small, visual indicator that appears on the alphanumeric and dot matrix score displays of many solid state games to alert the operator upon arrival at the location that there is a problem with the game that needs servicing. It is in the form of a decimal point (a period, or dot) that immediately follows the displayed number of credits on the game. It is not expected to be noticed by the pinball-playing customer.\n\nThe dot initially indicated only that switch errors were present, but in later games it represented additional error conditions, such as if one of the balls in a multi-ball game was missing from the trough.\n\nThe first pinball machine that had defective switch detection was Williams' 1986 'High Speed' but it could not show a credit dot because it still had the traditional 4-digit display for credits and match numbers. These displays did not provide for dots or commas. To alert the operator, when this game was powered-up the switch numbers were shown on the score displays (up to a maximum of three switches according to the manual). Also, as an operator option, an audio alarm at power up would cause the knocker to rapidly strike several times. See Switch Alarm Knocker.\n\nThe first pinball machine to have a credit dot was Williams' 1987 'F-14 Tomcat' as it was their first game to have 7-digit alphanumeric score displays, replacing the traditional 4-digit display, and these new displays allowed for dots and commas.\n\nReportedly, these additional manufacturers used credit dots:\n\n�€� Premier Technology (games using the Gottlieb System 3 MPU)\n\n�€� Data East (example: Time Machine from 1988)\n\n�€� Capcom (used stars instead of dots)\n\nCredit Dot, seen to the right of 'Credits 0' (click to enlarge)\n\nCrossover Return Lane —\n\nA flipper return lane that by design has swapped places with the outlane, and is separated from the flipper by this outlane. A ball entering the top of the return lane has to cross the outlane in order to reach the flipper. The speed of the ball usually allows it to jump the outlane and not drain, although success of this is not guaranteed.\n\nA list of games identified with this feature can be found here.\n\nCue Game —\n\nGames that use cue sticks to shoot the ball rather than a plunger.\n\n– D –\n\nData East —\n\nOne of the major pinball manufacturers of recent time, now out of business. Data East was known for only making games based on a licensed theme, such as a TV show or movie, but had used unlicensed themes in the past. Data East became Sega Pinball, Inc., which is also no longer in business.\n\nDC —\n\nDirect Current\n\nDeath Save —\n\nA method of saving a ball that has rolled down an outlane. By moving the cabinet forward and to the right as the ball hits a plate near the drain, tha ball can be made to bounce back into play.\n\nDesigner —\n\nThe person who designs the playfield and/or game rules.\n\nDip Target —\n\nThis is Gottlieb�€™s name for a wide, thin target face that is positioned behind a bank of drop targets on certain games, almost always in groups of three behind a 9-bank of drop targets. This plastic target has a protruding nub at the top of each side that allows it to pivot in its metal mounting bracket when hit by the ball in play, causing the surface to angle downward, or dip, pushing the lower back part of the target to close a weighted switch behind it for scoring. The target surface is thin enough and wide enough that a light bulb mounted behind it illuminates it to the player.\n\nThanks to former Gottlieb designer John Osborne for providing us the derivation of this term.\n\nA list of games identified with this feature can be found here.\n\nDisappearing Bumper —\n\nDisappearing bum​pers are a type of active bumper. See Bumper for a description.\n\nDisc roto-target —\n\nSee longer explanation under Roto-target.\n\nDiverter —\n\nA playfield object that can swing (usually controlled by a solenoid) to divert the ball onto one of several paths. Diverters are commonly used on ramps and on lanes to allow the ball to divert to a special target or lock during certain phases of the game. For instance, Williams' 1994 'Demolition Man' uses a diverter on the ramp that can lead to the cryo-claw to divert the ball onto a habitrail when the cryo-claw is not activated.\n\nNot be be confused with Diverter Magnet.\n\nMechanical (non-electric) pivoting diverters are found on Genco's 1933 '42nd Street'.\n\nFor static (non-moving) diverters, see Horseshoe Diverter.\n\nDiverter Magnet —\n\nA magnet that does not stop the ball but influences its path when the ball pas​ses over it or near it, causing the ball to change its speed, direction, or trajectory. Dive​rter magnets may or may not be under player control, and may be permanent or electric. The div​erter magnets on Midway's 1992 'The Addams Family' (aka \"The Power\") are not under player control. The Magnasave feature found on several games is under player control.\n\nNot to be confused with a Diverter.\n\nSee Playfield Magnets.\n\nDiverter Ramp —\n\nA ramp with one entrance and more than one exit. A diverting mechanism is used to determine which of the exits the ball with pas​s through.\n\nA single pivoting device is used to divert the ball on Midway's 1994 'The Shadow'.\n\nMultiple dive​rters are used to direct the ball on Williams' 1988 'Swords of Fury'.\n\nSee Diverter.\n\nDot Matrix Display —\n\nPlasma displays (not usually LEDs which are much dimmer) in an individually addressable dot grid rectangular array, capable of displaying graphics and text by energizing selected dots of the display. These displays usually use Neon gas, which glows orange when ionized by a high voltage electric current passed through the segment.\n\nThis type of display replaced the earlier Alphanumeric displays.\n\nA dot matrix display from Capcom's 1996 'Breakshot'.\n\nDrain —\n\nWhere lost balls exit the playfield (noun), as well as the actual act of losing a ball (verb). Also known as the outhole.\n\nDrain-o-Matic —\n\nA pinball game where balls drain too easily. Derogatory.\n\nDrop lane —\n\nA vertical lane directly above an outlane that causes the ball entering it to drop straight down into the outlane. In this way, it makes the outlane have more than one entrance.\n\nAn example of this feature is found on Bally's 1967 'The Wiggler'.\n\nA game having two of these lanes is Bally's 1968 'Dixieland' where the left one is very long and has a detour gate in its path, if earned by the player.\n\nIn the example of Williams' 1970 'Gay 90's' the drop lane also serves as an extended kickback lane.\n\nA list of games identified with this feature can be found here.\n\nSome games were designed by the factory to have a mini-post in the path of the dropping ball to deflect the ball away from the outlane and towards the flipper. In these instances, we do not identify this feature as a drop lane, even if an operator removed the mini-post after the game left the factory.\n\nDrop Target —\n\nA type of standup target that is dropped onto or into/below the playfield when hit. A row of them placed side-by-side is a Drop Target Bank.\n\nThe earliest type of drop target that we have encountered is on Exhibit's 1936 'Trapper' where the metal target tips over onto the playfield, not into it. The ball-in-play does not actually make contact with the target but instead hits a spring which in turn pushes the target over.\n\nA subsequent version of drop target dropped into the playfield but the surface that the ball hit did not drop. What dropped is a piece of decorative plastic behind the target that the ball never touched. An example of this is found on Gottlieb's 1951 'Minstrel Man'.\n\nStarting with Williams' 1962 'Vagabond', the surface struck by the ball is what dropped into the playfield, and the flat top of the target became part of the playfield surface while in the down position. This type of target is often found in a row of several, referred to as a drop target bank.\n\nUnlike a Dropping Bank of standup targets where all targets move in unison under motor power, each drop target operates individually, dropping suddenly when hit, pulled by spring tension. They reset in unison, however, when they are in a bank controlled by a common reset coil. This reset action is also sudden.\n\nOne unusual type of drop target does not require the ball to hit it to make it drop because its up/down action is under timed control from the CPU. See Sega Enterprises' 1976 'Rodeo'.\n\nSee also Memory Drop Target.\n\nIn the Notable Features section of the game listings on this site, drop targets are grouped by the number of them that share a common reset coil. For instance, if ten drop targets are in a row and share one reset coil, we will display this fact as 10-bank drop targets (1). If half of that row used one reset coil and the other half used a different reset coil, we will display this fact as 5-bank drop targets (2).\n\nIn addition, targets that share a reset coil may not all appear next to each other on the playfield. For instance, Bally's 1981 'Centaur' has two sets of two drop targets in its center playfield that share a reset coil and we would show this as 4-bank drop targets (1).\n\nIn-line drop targets also are grouped by common reset coil. Centaur also has 4-in-line drop targets which means all four targets share a reset coil.\n\nGrouping drop targets in this manner can help explain game operation to users unfamiliar with a game. Games for which we do not yet know how many reset coils are involved will list their drop targets as a sum total, such as Drop targets (10).\n\nBank of 5 drop targets from Bally's 1975 'Freedom'\n\nDrop Target Trip Coil —\n\nThis is an extra coil mounted to the drop target bank chassis of some games that causes some of the drop targets in the bank to drop down immediately after the entire bank has reset. The coil when energized actuates a long trip arm which has trip arm wireforms attached to it, one for each drop target to be tripped.\n\nThis feature trips the same drop targets every time and should not be confused with the memory drop targets typical of solid-state games where trip arm wireforms are not used and the same drop targets are not always tripped each time.\n\nA list of games identified with this feature can be found here.\n\nDrop-down cabinet —\n\nThis is a term used to describe a type of wood cabinet that is extended downward in the front (or \"dropped down\") to accommodate a large coin door.\n\nGottlieb used this style of cabinet from January 1963 to February 1964 on their multi-player games to accommodate their new larger chrome door and their new and large combination lockdown bar and ball-shooter used during this period.\n\nWilliams used this style of cabinet for games made from February 1965 through mid-1966. They had instituted a new coin door designed to accommodate nickels, dimes, and quarters in a single slot. Prior to this, each denomination required its own coin slot. This new design required a larger coin acceptor and a larger coin door than before. To accommodate the larger door, the front end of the wood cabinet was extended downward. Their first game to use this cabinet style was 1965 'Alpine Club'. Their last game to use this cabinet was 1966 'A-Go-Go' where, during its production run, the coin door was changed back to a multiple slot design and the cabinet extension was eliminated.\n\nOther manufacturers also used this style of cabinet. Sega Enterprises of Japan used it on their solid state games from 1976 to 1979. An example is 1977 'Mikoshi'.\n\nAn example from Spain is Automaticos' 1970 '7-Up'.\n\nDropping Bank —\n\nNot to be confused with a Drop Target Bank, this is a row of standup targets enclosed in a frame that can move up and down during game play. In the up position, all of the targets can be hit by the ball in play. For the down position, the frame will lower all of the targets simultaneously into the playfield, and the flat top of the frame becomes part of the playfield surface where the targets had been.\n\nThe up and down motion is controlled by a motor, therefore is not a instant action like in the case of Drop Targets.\n\nA list of games identified with this feature can be found here.\n\nDual Outlanes —\n\nTwo outlanes on each side of lower playfield, as in the examples of Gottlieb's 1962 'Sunset' and Williams' 1964 'Zig Zag'. The design feature was prevalent prior to the introduction of flipper return lanes in 1965.\n\nDual Target —\n\nSee Bar Target.\n\n– E –\n\nE.F.O. —\n\nThis is the abbreviation used by the Spanish company Electrónica Funcional Operativa, S.A. of Barcelona, Spain. This was the company who designed the entire electronics of most (if not all) Playmatic machines. We do not know how many other pinball manufacturers for which they provided boards other than manufacturers we occasionally happen upon in our research, such as Maibesa. We know they also designed boards for Cidelsa, an arcade division of Playmatic.\n\nTheir circuit boards will indicate E.F.O. BARCELONA SPAIN.\n\nTheir schematic pages may indicate EFO S.A..\n\nTheir name roughly translates to \"Functional Operative Electronic\".\n\nA list of games identified to have boards provided by this company (or probably provided by them) can be found here.\n\nEddy Sensor —\n\nSee Proximity Sensor.\n\nEject Hole —\n\nA hole which holds the ball visible to the player until a scoring objective is achieved then kicks it back into play. Also called Kick-out Hole.\n\nElectro-Mechanical Game —\n\nEarly games, mostly pre-1978, that rely on electromechanical components, such as relays, stepping units, motors and scoring wheels rather that solid-state electronics. Also called EMs. Compare to Solid-State games.\n\nElectromagnet —\n\nA coil that acts like a magnet only when electricity is applied. When electricity is removed, the magnetism stops. Most often used as a solenoid, but sometimes used under the playfield to affect ball travel. Electromagnets may or may not be under player control.\n\nSee Playfield Magnets.\n\nElectronic Upright —\n\nAlso called an \"upright\" or a \"flasher type\" slot machine, this is not a pinball machine. It is a gambling device. The player deposits coins to increment the credit counter, usually a 3 or 4-digit counter. The player presses a button to increase the potential payout amounts as shown on the silkscreened display glass, decrementing the counter one step for each press of the button. Then the machine motor is activated by the player by moving a large handle on the front of the cabinet, and certain artistic symbols on the glass light up momentarily until finally some symbols remain lit when the motor stops, presenting a final combination to the player, to compare to the payout combinations awarded by the game. If a winning combination is achieved, the counter increments according to the level of payout that the player had first selected.\n\nLater models did not light symbols on the glass but instead had three small windows built in the top of the cabinet, simulating the look of a slot machine as symbols flashed by.\n\nIt is important to note that these devices do not have a side handle to pull like a traditional slot machine nor are any coins or tokens dispensed as payout. Payout takes the form of added credits to the counter, allowing the player to continue to play without inserting more coins or, if permissible by the location (and if no law enforcement is present in areas where gambling is illegal), the player can exchange credits for cash. The location will then remove all credits, usually by quickly turning the machine off, then on, which activates the knock-off mechanism, quickly decrementing the counter to zero.\n\nThe J.H. Keeney company was a well-known manufacturer of these games in the 1950s and 60s, having made many models, although other manufacturers such as Bally made them, too.\n\nSometimes these games show up on pinball lists in old Billboard and Cash Box magazines. We include some of them on this site, for clarification purposes.\n\nAn example of this device where lighted symbols flash on the glass is Keeney's 1959 'Big Round-Up'.\n\nAn example where symbols flash like a slot-machine is Keeney's 1960 'Black Dragon'.\n\nElectropak —\n\nBrand name for a power supply manufactured by Electrical Products Company of Detroit Michigan. It is a combination transformer and rectifier. Rectifiers convert alternating current (AC) to direct current (DC).\n\nPower supplies such as this were used in pinball machines as the evolutionary step after batteries to allow a game designed for DC operation to be powered by an AC wall outlet.\n\nElectrical Products Company was owned by Avery B. Chereton.\n\nSee Patent 2,028,191. For additional info, see this article from The Billboard, Feb-20-1937, page 88.\n\nA Billboard article dated Mar-16-1946 page 93 stated that Chereton was also a coin machine manufacturer before WWII. However, we have not yet found his name associated with any pinball machines outside of that article.\n\nAn Electropak missing its Rectifier\n\nClick image to Enlarge Manufacturing Plate\n\nClick image to Enlarge From the Coin Machine Journal\n\nOctober 1936, page 76\n\nClick image to Enlarge\n\nEM —\n\nAcronym for an Electro-mechanical game.\n\nEnd-of-Ball Bonus —\n\nPoints added to the score when the ball leaves the playfield.\n\nThis bonus can be a fixed amount of points for each ball, not tied to player performance. Gottlieb's 1961 'Oklahoma' awards 30 points per ball. Gottlieb's 1964 'World Fair' awards 30 points per ball plus a spin of the spin-disc to spot a number on the playfield.\n\nOther games can increase the bonus based on player performance. The player would need to hit a sequence of rollovers or targets, complete modes, and/or earn multipliers. Gottlieb's 1962 'Tropic Isle' awards 20 points per ball, or player skill can change it to be 200 points per ball.\n\nGames that allow player skill to increase the bonus amount to any of several values will display these amounts in a row or cluster of inserts on the playfield. This arrangement is known as a bonus ladder. As the player achieves playfield objectives tied to this bonus, the lit value on this ladder will increase.\n\nAn early example of a bonus ladder is found on Chicago Coin's 1939 'Nippy'. Starting in 1970, bonus ladders were conspicuously displayed as a vertical row of inserts near the flippers. Because of this, it has been incorrectly believed by modern players that Gottlieb�€™s 1970 Snow Queen and Snow Derby were the first games to have an end-of-ball bonus.\n\nIt is important to note that the end-of-ball bonus is not something that is only awarded at the outhole at the bottom of the playfield. For example, Gottlieb's 1960 'Seven Seas' has two bonus ladders, one for each of its gobble holes, and the manufacturer clearly marks this gobble hole award as \"Bonus\". The gobble hole on Gottlieb's 1960 'Spot-A-Card' awards a fixed 200 points.\n\nOn some games, this bonus is such a large portion of the score that tilting the game results in a major loss of points.\n\nThe end-of-ball bonus is almost a standard feature on SS games but less so on EM games. A list of EM games identified with this feature can be found here.\n\nEnd-of-Stroke Switch —\n\nA switch that is activated by a mechanical device when the device reaches the end of its stroke. On Bally/Williams flippers, the switch is used when the flipper reaches the end of its movement to switch to a lower current feeding the flipper coil to prevent it from burning out. This allows high current to initially move the flipper quickly, but low current to hold it in the up position. Abbreviated EOSS.\n\nIn EMs, end-of-stroke switches are used in several places. For instance, a slingshot score is not activated by the standup switches, but the standup switches activate the kicking coil which, when fully engaged, hits the end-of-stroke switch which pulses the score relay. They are also used on pop bumpers and some stepping units.\n\nEOSS —\n\nSee End-of-stroke switch.\n\nEscalator —\n\nA device for passing inserted coins from a first location to a second location across a flat horizontal path inside the game. Each inserted coin lays flat on this path, pushed along by the next coin that follows it, until it falls into the coin box. The length of this horizontal path determines how many coins are laid flat side-by-side to be viewed from above through an elongated hole in the playfield. This device allowed the location to determine if slugs were being used in place of actual money.\n\nThis device was commonly used in payout games of the 1930s.\n\nAn example of a short escalator can be seen in our listing of Exhibit's 1937 'Bazaar'.\n\nAn example of a long escalator can be seen in our listing of Bally's 1937 'Carom'.\n\nExtra Ball Buy-in —\n\nSee Buy-In.\n\n– F –\n\nFlex-save Lanes —\n\nOn games with this feature, each outlane has a flexible and movable metal wall. When a ball enters an outlane, the player can quickly press a corresponding button, located underneath each flipper button, to move this metal wall to detour the ball to the inlane, thus saving the ball from draining.\n\nUsed on a few Bally games during 1987, these lanes appeared on Bally Midway's 1987 'Dungeons & Dragons' where they were also called Magic-Save lanes. They also appeared on Bally's 1983 'BMX'.\n\nFlip Flag —\n\nA domino-sized and shaped device that is hinged on one end and which flips on this hinge to show one of its sides or the other, to indicate whether or not a related feature has been earned by the player. Only three machines have this feature, all of them manufactured by Bally. The first game with this feature is Bally's 1975 'Wizard!'.\n\nFlip-tronics —\n\nThe term used by Rally of France to describe their technology package used on several of their EM games in the 1960s, starting with Rally's 1966 'Rally Girl'. The features included nixie tube electronic scoring and design for easier service and repair.\n\nNot to be confused with Williams' Fliptronics.\n\nFlipper —\n\nThose thingies that move when you hit the flipper buttons. Some people use these to propel the pinball. The first game credited to have used them is Gottlieb's 1947 'Humpty Dumpty'. See also Impulse flipper.\n\nActually, flippers were already used on many games prior to 1947, but they were non-electrical, entirely mechanical. Some games had eight mechanical flippers, such as Ad-Lee Company's 1932 'Double-Shuffle'. Most were \"manually-operated\" bats used on baseball games, one to a playfield. 'Humpty Dumpty' is the first pinball machine manufactured with flippers that were electromechanical. According to the book Pinball 1, David Gottlieb wanted to name this game 'Flipper' but a legal check found a patented countertop game that had a manual bat, Smith Manufacturing Company's 1932 'Flipper'.\n\nFrom an interview with Harry Williams on March 18, 1978, pinball historian Russ Jensen later wrote that \"at the time when Harry Mabs at Gottlieb came out with the first flipper, Williams [Manufacturing Company] had also been working on a similar device. Theirs, [Harry] said, used a shallow hole into which a ball would drop, which would then be kicked out by a \"bat\" behind the hole. This was an \"automatic\" action, however, and not controlled by buttons on the cabinet.\" See Game-controlled Flipper.\n\nFlipper Return Lane —\n\nA wireform that allows the ball to roll behind the slingshot and towards a waiting flipper.\n\nAccording to the book All About Pinball, Gottlieb's 1965 'Pleasure Isle' and its replay version Gottlieb's 1965 'Paradise' were the first playfields designed to have flipper return lanes. However, Gottlieb rescheduled the production of a subsequent game designed with these lanes, Gottlieb's 1965 'Bank-A-Ball', so that it could be produced first.\n\nSee also Crossover Return Lane.\n\nFlipper-Zipper —\n\nThis is the correct term that Bally gave the feature that is popularly called Zipper Flippers. Their first game to have it is Bally's 1966 'Bazaar'.\n\nIt is a trademarked feature found on some of their games that (temporarily) closed (or \"zipped\" up) the gap between the flippers once certain game goals were accomplished, such as lighting up a series of targets, thereby preventing the ball in play from draining between these flippers. Bally parts catalogs referred to this feature as the Flipper-Zipper Assembly.\n\nBally used the term on its flyers, starting with their second game to have this feature, Bally's 1966 'Capersville', and they almost always hyphenated it. Bally finally referred to it as 'Zipper Flippers' on the flyer for their last game to have this feature, Bally's 1981 'Medusa', which is also their only Solid State game to have this feature, and their only game where these flippers were not placed at the bottom of the playfield.\n\nUsed on four Williams EM games, where it was known as \"Closing Flipper Action\".\n\nAlso used on a few games made in Europe.\n\nA list of games identified with this feature can be found here.\n\nFlipperless —\n\nThese machines have no flippers. When used as a specialty designator in this database, it is used for games manufactured after the invention of the EM flipper (in 1947, see Gottlieb's 'Humpty Dumpty') that don�€™t have flippers.\n\nIt is also used for games made before the invention of the EM flipper but after the invention of the passive bumper (in 1936, see Pacent's 'Bolo') because playfields in this time frame (1936-1947) can often look similar to flippered playfields simply because they have these round bumpers, so we identify them as flipperless to clarify this fact for those users who may not be familiar with when the flipper was invented.\n\nMechanical games and other games made prior to the invention of the passive bumper are obvious to the eye that they would not or cannot have flippers, therefore we do not bother to mark those games as flipperless.\n\nThis specialty designator is occasionally used to identify other games, usually those for which not having flippers is an interesting notation.\n\nMany games manufactured just prior to 1947 may have had EM flippers retrofitted into them by their operators in an attempt to keep these games profitable on location after new games were released with flippers. These games will still be designated as flipperless, because they were manufactured without flippers, even if a particular instance of the game is pictured in the listing with the retrofit. These retrofit flippers can be found in various locations on the playfields, as operators fit them in wherever there was room and wherever they did not interfere with existing wiring.\n\nFliptronics —\n\nA name that Williams gave two of its seven versions of its WPC operating system. See Advanced Search on this site for a pulldown list of all MPU operating systems.\n\nNot to be confused with Rally's Flip-tronics.\n\nFlyaway Target —\n\nA type of Hanging Target that, once hit by the ball, swings up and stays up, unable to be hit again, until reset.\n\nBally advertised this feature as \"All New\" on their Bally's 1982 'Speakeasy' but, in fact, targets that performed like this appeared on earlier games whether the term \"Flyaway\" was used or not. Midway had used the term \"Fly Away Skill Target\" on their advertising flyers for Midway's 1964 'Top Hit' and Midway's 1965 'Mystery Score'.\n\nFree Ball Return Lane —\n\nA lane that delivers the ball to the shooter alley. Typically, this lane has no gate and therefore is always \"open\". An example of this is found on Gottlieb's 1970 'Scuba' where it is referred to as a \"mid-field ball back feature\".\n\nFree Play —\n\nThis term has shades of meaning:\n\n1) A game won by the player. Also called a replay. Allows a future game to be started without having to insert a coin (coining). A running count of such awarded games are most often displayed on the backglass.\n\n2) Back in the 1930�€™s and 40�€™s, games were advertised by the manufacturer to have optionable modes for Free Play or for Novelty Play, often pointed out to differentiate the game from Payout Machines of the day. To option the game for Free Play was to allow it to award replays for achieving game objectives. Modern games refer to this setting as the Replay Mode. To collect on the earned free plays (replays), the game has a Start button on the front of the cabinet used to bypass the need for coining or, if the game has a coin slide, the slide may be pushed in all the way without a coin in it. This type of coin slide that allowed free play first appeared on Keeney's 1935 'Quick Silver' and was invented and patented by Bill Bellah.\n\n3) An operator option on Solid State games to allow the Start button to initiate a game without a coin, and regardless if there are replays registered on the credit meter.\n\n4) For games that were not equipped by the manufacturer with an option to bypass coining, which includes the EM games, this term refers to an after-factory modification to bypass the need for coining. To do this, the replay unit zero-count switch (on EM games) can be made to not open, rendering the Start button as always \"hot\", or a separate button can be wired to appear somewhere on the coin door, to simulate the insertion of a coin. Alternately, the game can be set to award a replay at a very low point threshold, ensuring that a replay will always be won for each game played, eliminating the need for coining.\n\nFree Play Hole —\n\nA hole in the playing field that delivers the ball back to the ball lift mechanism, to allow the player to shoot it again, without subtracting from the count of balls played. These are seen most often on pre-flipper games.\n\nFrenzy —\n\nA special mode earned in some games where everything on the playfield scores a lot of points.\n\n– G –\n\nGame-controlled Flipper —\n\nFor solid-state games, this is a flipper that is sometimes operated by the activities of game play and not exclusively by the player pressing a flipper button. In this way, it can be said the flipper is under semi-automatic control of the CPU. Typically, the ball in play has to achieve an objective to enable the CPU to take control of the flipper, timing its flip with the proximity of the ball as detected by nearby sensors. We know of four examples of this solid-state version:\n\n\"Thing Flips\" is found on Midway's 1992 'The Addams Family'.\n\n\"Shark Flips\" is found on Sega's 1995 'Baywatch'.\n\n\"Autodrop Probe\" is found on SLEIC's 1996 'Io Moon'.\n\n\"Phantom Flips\" is found on Williams' 1998 'Monster Bash'.\n\nFor electro-mechanical games, see Automatic Flipper.\n\nGame-controlled Mini-flipper —\n\nSee game-controlled flipper.\n\nGate —\n\nA thing the pinball can go through in one direction but not the other. You can often find gates at the end of the plunger lane. There are several styles of gates.\n\nA type of gate from Bally's 1976 'Freedom'. The ball can pass through from the left, but not from the right.\n\nGimmick —\n\nA feature of the game that is put in there to attract attention and make the game unique in some way. A gimmick can also be a decoration on the cabinet or backbox.\n\nGobble Hole —\n\nA hole in the playfield through which the ball in play may fall, ending that ball. Falling into this hole usually scores a large value or a special. This was a common feature in the woodrail era, and rarely seen after that.\n\nSee also Sinkhole.\n\nGottlieb Made In Brazil —\n\nGottlieb shipped unassembled game components to Manaus, Brazil because it was a Tax Free Zone and assembly was finished there by Fipermatic, a Brazilian import and export firm.\n\nWe asked Wayne Neyens for more information. He told us that, in the 1970�€™s, Gottlieb shipped the following components to Australia and Brazil:\n\nBackglass\n\nPlayfield\n\nLightbox insert\n\nLower cabinet insert (aka motor board)\n\nGottlieb did not ship the playfield glass or the cabinet. Those components would have to be procured (locally) by the recipient.\n\nSee also Knock-Down Game.\n\n10/18/2011\n\nGottlieb Made In Italy —\n\nSome Italian backglasses and playfields repeat the Game Name as the manufacturer. For instance, a backglass for the Italian version of Gottlieb's \"Golden Arrow\" has a logo printed on it indicating \"MFD by Golden Arrow, Italy\" instead of indicating Giuliano Lodola, the acknowledged manufacturer of this version. This information appears in a rectangular box resembling the Gottlieb logo of the period. This raises questions of who really manufactured those backglasses and playfields. Federico Croci, a collector in Italy, offers this explanation:\n\n\"I talked about an old operator about the fact that sometimes there are games with the words \"manufactured by\" (or \"mfd by\") and the name of the game itself, which makes little sense. He told me that, as far as he remembers, when that copy of a Gottlieb game was built by, for example, RMG, it has the logo RMG in both the backglass and the playfield. It could be a game entirely made of new parts, or a reconstructed old game, but if RMG ordered playfields and backglasses, they usually were marked RMG.\n\n\"But, you could go directly to the printing facility, which was external to the many pinball manufacturers, not connected to them in any way, and ask to buy one of the playfields and backglasses they were manufacturing for someone else. The printing guy always produced some more playfields and backglasses than requested by, for example, RMG, just to sell these for himself. And he modified the name of the manufacturer, if present; so, he removed \"Giuliano Lodola\", if present, and substituted it with the same exact name of the game. Or he added \"The Best\", before the same exact name of the game. Or he added something else...things like that. He made this in order to not be accused of selling designs made by someone else, but also, if you have a playfield and a backglass, to have the name of the game printed on it somewhere, it helps to recognize the parts.\n\n\"So, if we have a Golden Arrow made by Giuliano Lodola, usually we have a pinball which was assembled in the Giuliano Lodola's factory. If we have the same exact game, but the only difference is in the logo, it means that the kit was assembled by the operator, buying somewhere the playfield and the backglass. In this case, it's also possible they also buyed a new cabinet, or had it sprayed new.\"\n\n01/10/2008\n\nGottlieb/Premier —\n\nOne of the major pinball manufacturers. Gottlieb was bought by Columbia Pictures in 1976 but kept their name. In 1983 when Coca-Cola Company bought Columbia Pictures, Gottlieb was renamed Mylstar Electronics. In September 1984, Columbia closed Mylstar, ending three generations of the Gottlieb family in the business. In October 1984, Gil Pollock bought Mylstar's pinball assets and started Premier Technology, prominently and respectfully featuring the honored Gottlieb name on their pinball games and advertising. Premier went out of business in 1996.\n\nGunching —\n\nJolting the machine during play to change the way the ball travels or bounces.\n\n– H –\n\nHabitrail —\n\nA ball path made from pieces of steel wire and set above the normal playfield ball level. In games of the 1930s, they were called \"ball elevators\". See also wireform.\n\nHalf-Moon Credit Window —\n\nThis term is probably the most common of the informal references given to a type of replay unit used by Gottlieb on several of their EM games during 1975-1976. The term is derived from its appearance on the backglass as an arc, or half-circle, where no silkscreening appears, allowing the unit to display the number of replays available to the player. The unit itself is commonly called the half-moon credit unit even though Gottlieb identified the device in their catalogs and labeled the device inside the backbox as \"Replay Unit\". This device can display a maximum of nine replays.\n\nA previous type of replay unit required only a small square of unpainted backglass through which was displayed the number of replays. This style of device was used by many manufacturers throughout the EM era and replaced the older style known as replay projection. An example of this previous device can be seen here.\n\nWhether half-moon or square, these displays on the backglass of EM games are collectively called replay windows or credit windows.\n\nThe Gottlieb patent #3,793,510 for the half-moon device explains that it was recognized that the previous Gottlieb replay unit could be cheated by players to increment replays without coining and this half-moon device was designed to eliminate such cheating.\n\nThis device was introduced during the production run of Atlantis in January 1975. Therefore, some games in that run have the square replay window and some have the half-moon replay window. The last game to have this device was Sure Shot of March 1976. Subsequent Gottlieb games once again had the square replay window device until their transition to solid state credit windows in 1979.\n\nA list of games identified with this feature can be found here.\n\nHanging Target —\n\nA target that hangs above the playfield with its top edge attached to a supporting frame. When the ball hits the target, a switch is closed and the target value is awarded.\n\nOn Bat Games, these targets appear along the back edge of the playfield and often do not move much when hit, except to allow the ball to hit it and pas​s behind it. If the target stays up in the air once hit, it can be referred to as a Flyaway Target.\n\nHead —\n\nSee Backbox.\n\nHead-to-Head Play —\n\nThese machines allow two players to play against each other at the same time using the same ball.\n\nHigh Score Game —\n\nSee Novelty Play.\n\nHigh-Tap —\n\nThe typical EM transformer has two output lugs, normal-tap and high-tap, of which only one is used at a time. Normal-tap is typically selected at the factory. For games operating in low voltage environments, the transformer may be optionally rewired by the owner/operator to its high-tap lug to slightly increase the voltage going to the game coils. This allows the game to play well in that environment. Some games are placed in high-tap even when the game is not in a low voltage environment, which can make the game run differently by giving its components more power.\n\nHold Feature —\n\nA purchased feature on a bingo machine that, during a game in play, allows the player a choice of returning all or a portion of the played balls to the shooter for replay, retaining (\"holding\") the other balls on the playfield. This is accomplished by a motorized baffle that can be moved in three directions, not just one direction as is typical of most bingo games, to drop some of the played balls but not others.\n\nThis feature was named the Ball Return Feature on Bally's 1978 'Tahiti'.\n\nA list of games identified with this feature can be found here.\n\nHome Model —\n\nThe popularity of commercial pinball machines created a desire in players to own one in their home and the home models were the result of this. These machines are similar to the coin operated models they�€™re based on, but they do not accept coins and are usually smaller, often designed with shorter legs and younger art for children.\n\nThese home models are usually not valued as highly as their commercial models because of their simpler design. The electronics (used in later models) are hard to find.\n\nHorserace Game —\n\nCommon features of horserace games are: no flippers; one ball game; selection of horses 1 through 7; has 3 or 4 areas on the playfield, consisting of 7 holes (win, place, show, purse); usually has multiple coin play for progressive odds.\n\nHorserace games are were an attempt to capitalize on the popular sport of horse racing by using a game that could be claimed to not be gambling because of the interaction of the user in shooting the ball. These games used a horse racing theme and they allowed a player to shoot a single ball for each game. The player would try to shoot the ball and cause it to fall into a scoring hole, which caused the player to win that payoff. These games usually allowed players to enter more than one coin at a time to increase the payoff odds. The playfields were often divided into the areas of Win, Place and Show with appropriate odds on the holes in that playfield area.\n\nIn old trade magazines such as The Billboard, these large games are sometimes euphemistically called 'jumbo pin games' or 'jumbo pinball games'.\n\nA note about the 'one ball' designation listed above: Some 'one ball' horserace games manufactured after World War II actually contained 5 balls, even though still only 1 ball was used to score. The additional four balls were first shot by the player into the \"Skill Lane\". This was done to allow operators to continue using the games in the areas where \"one ball games\" were increasingly being classified as gambling devices.\n\nFor these 5 ball horserace games, the first four balls shot by the player were stored in a pocket positioned just to the left of the rebound spring at the left edge of the rebound arch at the top of the playfield. The only skill required to reach this \"Skill Lane\" was the ability to shoot a ball hard enough to reach the left side of the playfield. Making all four balls into the \"Skill Lane\" had no effect on the game play or the payout. After four balls were in the \"Skill Lane\", the rebound spring was reset to the normal position to allow the 5th (scoring) ball to properly rebound when shot. If more than one ball made it onto the playfield and dropped into a scoring hole, the payout was disabled for the extra balls.\n\nA list of games identified with this Skill Lane feature can be found here.\n\nHorseshoe Diverter —\n\nA stationary (non-pivoting) diverter, shaped like a horseshoe, used to change the direction of a ball shot into play (to \"spin it around\"). A ball with sufficient velocity will travel the full length of the inside curve of the horseshoe to exit in a new direction. A slower ball might not reach the horseshoe at all, or may not make it all the way around the horseshoe and will either slowly roll out or fall into a desired high-scoring hole in the horseshoe's center area.\n\nThis device is found on the mechanical games of the 1930�€™s and often is designed to look like an actual equine horseshoe, implying good luck. It is different from the horseshoe lanes found in EM and SS games because it is not actually an enclosed lane, but probably a bigger difference is that, while the horseshoe lanes face towards the flippers that drive the balls into them, the horseshoe diverters of flipperless games are aligned to the trajectory of the upper ball arch that directs the launched ball into play.\n\nAn example of a game which uses two of these devices in tandem is Chicago Coin's 1933 'Baby Leland'.\n\nHorseshoe Lane —\n\nA lane shaped like a semi-circle, curving around a playfield component such as a post, standup target, or kick-out hole. A typical example is found on Bally's 1980 'Silverball Mania'.\n\nThese lanes can be as small as the one on the left side of Williams' 1988 'Swords of Fury' or as wide and sweeping as the one in the upper playfield of Williams' 1982 'Thunderball'.\n\nSee also Horseshoe Diverter.\n\n– I –\n\nImpulse flipper —\n\nA design of flipper mechanism used on some woodrails where the flipper does not stay energized for the entire length of time that the flipper button is depressed. Pressing the flipper button causes the flipper to quickly energize then de-energize, as if the player had only tapped the flipper button. The flipper cannot be held in the \"up\" position and the player must release and press the button to pulse the flipper again. Sometimes referred to as a Pulse flipper. Used by Williams prior to 1956.\n\nInlane —\n\nThe path feeding a falling ball from the playfield to the flippers, usually behind a slingshot. See also outlane.\n\nInsert —\n\nSee Backbox Insert.\n\nSee Cabinet Insert.\n\nSee Playfield Insert.\n\n– J –\n\nJet bumper —\n\nThe name used by Williams Electronics to describe active bumpers. See Bumper for a description.\n\nJobber —\n\nAn older term for a non-franchised distributor. A jobber usually dealt mainly in used equipment.\n\nJumper Bumper —\n\nAn active bumper where the entire upper half of the assembly (not just the metal ring that comes in contact with the ball but the bumper cap and light bulb, too) moves up and down with the action of the solenoid. Invented by Dennis Nordman and first appearing on Midway's 1989 'Elvira and the Party Monsters'.\n\n– K –\n\nKick-out Hole —\n\nA hole which holds the ball visible to the player until a scoring objective is achieved then kicks it back into play. Also called Eject Hole.\n\nWith few exceptions, kick-out holes propel the ball in one direction only. A list of games having 2-way kick-out holes is here.\n\nSee also Kick-out Saucer.\n\nKick-out Saucer —\n\nA kick-out hole in the center of a round inclined recess in the playfield. This saucer-shaped recess is wide enough to help a nearby ball roll into the kick-out hole. Most kick-out holes do not have a saucer and the ball has to travel directly to the hole to fall into it.\n\nAn example is found on the upper playfield of Bally's 1978 'Mata Hari'.\n\nKickback —\n\nUsually located at the left outlane, the kickback, when activated, kicks the ball back into play instead of allowing the ball to pas s to the drain.\n\nStern used this term to describe the upper playfield slot kicker on their 2015 Game of Thrones game.\n\nKicker —\n\nIn general, an interchangeable term for Slingshot. But there are also \"slot kickers\", which kick the ball out of a slot/trough/channel.\n\nKicking Rubber —\n\nAlso called a rebound kicker, this is a rubber ring stretched between two or more posts with a paddle in the middle that kicks when the ball comes in contact with the rubber, propelling the ball away. This device is more commonly known as a slingshot.\n\nKnock-Down Game —\n\nThis term was used by USA manufacturers to mean a kit that was exported and that typically consisted of everything for a game except the cabinet and playfield glass. The receiving company would procure these unshipped items locally. We don't know if manufacturers outside of the USA used this term.\n\nKnock-down target —\n\nA ball hitting the front face of this type of target knocks it backwards, smoothly and quickly.\n\nAn example of a game with this feature is Midway's 1965 'Play Ball'.\n\nOn European games such as Bensa's 1974 'Big Brave' and Interflip's 1977 'Dragon', the face of the target, once hit, remains flush with the playfield surface until reset.\n\nKnocker —\n\nThe solenoid that bangs the inside of the cabinet or backbox to produce a loud cracking noise that in almost all instances is used to signal a free game. Also see Match.\n\nSometimes, a knocker is used for other purposes such as notifying the operator of a condition. See Switch Alarm Knocker.\n\nA knocker can be used during game play to highlight a game feature. Three sequential knocks are used to highlight the theme of Chicago Coin's 1951 'Thing'. On Rock-ola's 1935 'Big Game', a knocker bangs the inside of the cabinet bottom to augment backglass light animation if earned by the player.\n\n– L –\n\nLane Change —\n\nGames featuring lane change allow the player to shift the lit lights in a set of lights on the playfield, such as a set of lights on the outlanes and inlanes showing which lane has an award.\n\nLeaf Switch —\n\nA type of switch which consists of two tounges of metal, separated by an insulator, which come into contact when pressed together, such as via a lever or mechanical device. Leaf switches are used to detect a ball coming through a gate or going up a ramp. In older games leaf switches are used throughout most of the game, while newer games also rely on microswitches, magnetic proximity sensors, and optos (opto-electronic sensors).\n\nA basic, single-pole leaf switch\n\nLight Shields —\n\nSee Playfield Plastics.\n\nLinear Target —\n\nA scoring device consisting of a target affixed to a long horizontal metal rod visible to the player. The harder the ball hits the target, the further the target and rod are pushed into the rest of the device and the more points are awarded.\n\nThis device was Williams' version of the Gottlieb vari-target. It's first (and possibly only) appearance was on Williams' 1989 'Bad Cats'.\n\nLockdown Bar —\n\nThe common name of the metal piece (or wood on woodrail games) at the bottom of the playfield, which keeps the playfield cover glass from sliding out. Often labeled \"Front Molding\" in the manual. Usually removed via a latch inside the coin door, allowing the playfield glass to be slid out and the playfield then removed.\n\nLoterie —\n\nWhen used for pinball machines, this is the French word for the match feature. It can be seen on some French pinball games or their advertising flyers.\n\n– M –\n\nM-Ball —\n\nThe name Data East used for multiball before they licensed the word multiball from Williams.\n\nMagic-Pockets —\n\nA purchased feature on certain Bally bingo machines that, during a game in play, and after playing the third ball and before shooting the fourth ball, allows the player to physically reposition any balls in the top row of seven holes to other holes in that row, using two buttons on the lockdown bar marked Left and Right. Each press of the button moves the balls one hole, left or right, while this feature is active. The player can reposition these balls as many times as desired along this row until the 4th ball is shot into play. However, a ball in Hole 1 cannot move further to the left, and a ball in Hole 7 cannot move further to the right, and a ball in either of these two holes can be used to force other top row balls back into play when these other balls are kicked to hit them.\n\nA list of games identified with this feature can be found here.\n\nMagic-save Lanes —\n\nSee Flex-save Lanes.\n\nMagna-Save —\n\nA player-activated magnet above an inlane that will try to catch a ball headed for the outlane. Magna-Save has appeared on some Williams games and is a trademark of Williams Electronics.\n\nMagnet —\n\nSee Playfield Magnets.\n\nManufacturers —\n\nThere have been many pinball manufacturers through the years. Of the more commonly known USA manufacturers:\n\nKeeney ended pinball production in 1963.\n\nIn 1977, Chicago Coin became Stern Electronics, Inc. which lasted until 1985. (In 1999, Stern Pinball, Inc. began operation.)\n\nGottlieb became Mylstar in 1983 which then became Premier in 1984 and went out of business in 1996.\n\nWilliams merged with Bally before closing its pinball division in 1999.\n\nThe companies that are still making pinball machines today can be found here.\n\nMarquee —\n\nOn older games that have no backbox, this is often a thin vertical board or sign of short height at the rear of the cabinet, displaying the game name and other pertinent information.\n\nSee also Backglass Marquee.\n\nMatch —\n\nA free game given away by the machine to one of the players for no apparent reason at the end of the game. When the game is over, one of ten different numbers randomly lights up in the silkscreened area of the backglass of EM games or, in the case of early solid state games, lights in a segmented digital display specific for this purpose or, in later SS games, in the DMD or LCD. This number is known as the \"match number\". Depending on the era of the game, the match number is either one, two, or three digits. For each player whose last digit(s) of their final score is the same as the match number, a free game is awarded because the score \"matched\". The match feature, unless turned off by the operator, always occurs at the end of the game. There is around a 10% chance of receiving a match on older games, but newer solid-state machines allow this to be set as low as 1%, with the factory setting at 7%. When a match occurs, the knocker is usually used to inform the player.\n\nIn some two-player games of the 1950s, the operator can set the machine to provide 10 replays if both player's scores match the number (five for each player). In four-player games of that period, 10 replays could be awarded if first and second player both matched, or if third and fourth player both matched.\n\nSome 1-player games of the 1950s and early 1960s used bulb scoring instead of score reels and these games did not use a match number but instead lit a star on the backglass. If the lit star was adjacent to the last two digits of the player�€™s score, a replay was awarded. For example, the backglass of Gottlieb's 1957 'Straight Flush' illustrates where the star would randomly light next to any of the ten possible combinations of the player�€™s last two digits.\n\nThe use of a star in the match feature is not to be confused with the ones used by Williams for their short-lived Star Feature.\n\nSee also Your Number Match.\n\nMechanical Backbox Animation —\n\nWhen used as a specialty in this database, this term is used to indicate games that contain mechanical action anim​ation in the backbox. This specialty is not used for games that use light-based anim​ations, attract mode lights, dot matrix displays, or flashers.\n\nThis mechanical anim​ation is often referred to as backg​lass anim​ation when not considering backg​lass light anim​ation.\n\nSee Animation.\n\nMechanical Animation on Gottlieb's 1966 'Central Park'\n\nMEL —\n\nTom Kopera, former Williams project engineer and designer, provided us this explanation:\n\n\"MEL\" was a Bally/Williams created term for pre-production games built on the test production line. MEL was an acronym for Manufacturing Excellence LAB. This is what many companies call the Test Production Line, or Pilot Production Line, or Sample Production Line.\n\nIt was a small production line separated from the main line. It had all the same stations/tools/equipment as the actual production line but only held 15 games. Its intention was to build games from a completed BOM with sourced parts and production tools to get the production process set and look for assembly issues. Normally the first 15 games were built on this line, 7 of these games went to the European customers, one game to the programmer, one to UL testing, one to ship testing, one to the game designer for testing, one for manufacturing. Sometimes all 15 were never completed. We called these MEL games. Some games were very close to the actual production games, some games had many issues and the MEL games are considerably different from the production games.\n\nMemory Drop Target —\n\nA drop tar get feature found on many solid state games and most evident when two or more players are in play. Unlike multiplayer EM games where all dropped targets reset for the next ball regardless if it was for the same player or for the next player, the CPU of a SS game will \"remember\" which drop tar gets were hit by each player at the end of their previous ball in play. So, when a player's turn comes up again, typically causing the drop tar get bank to reset, the specific targets that were hit previously by that player and thus stored in memory as dropped will immediately drop again before the new ball is shot into play. In this way, each player does not lose the advantage of the hit targets at the end of his/her last ball in play. On some games, this memory feature can be disabled by the operator, making all drop tar gets reset at the start of a new ball, just like multiplayer EM games.\n\nSee also Drop Target.\n\nMessenger Ball —\n\nSee Captive Ball.\n\nMicroswitch —\n\nA type of small switch used under rollovers and other parts of a game. Microswitches are much smaller than leaf switches, are self contained and enclosed to protect their mechanism, and have a button that wh"
