        "text": "This page presents a summary of EPA's policies and procedures for purchasing novelty items and promotional products. The EPA Acquisition Guide (EPAAG)Â Intranet Â provides more details of these policies and procedures, and the exceptions to them.\n\nA ânovelty itemâ is defined as a small, mass-produced object or souvenir of nominal value that is primarily used for outreach and educational purposes.\n\nNovelty items must contain a âmessageâ that is concise, readily understandable by the audience it reaches, and is usually is part of a larger EPA theme or campaign.\n\nThe purchase of novelty items must be based on the ânecessary expenseâ rule, which states that purchase will only be allowed if the item will contribute to the accomplishment of the Agencyâs mission, and is not otherwise prohibited by law.\n\nCriteria for determining appropriateness of novelty and promotional products\n\nBranding novelty and promotional items with Agency information\n\nRestrictions on cost\n\nAllowed and prohibited Items\n\nAcquisition procedure and justification\n\nItems used as awards\n\nCriteria for Determining Appropriateness of Novelty and Promotional Products\n\nThe item:\n\nshould be able to serve in any of these ways:\n\nconvention booth attractions and memorabilia\n\nelements of education kits that may also serve as stand alone items\n\ntangible reinforcement of a key point at a meeting or presentation\n\nmorale-building items for group participation activities\n\nshould be useful as a communication tool for a variety of audiences and serve the public interest:\n\nphysical qualities of the product reflect well on EPA mission and status\n\necologically benign; preferably beneficial\n\nsafe, non-toxic for humans and animals\n\nmade and/or imprinted in the United States of America\n\nmust conform to all federal laws and EPA rules on purchasing, printing, trademark, ethics, and appropriations.\n\nTop of page\n\nBranding Novelty and Promotional Items with Agency Information\n\nAll novelty and promotional items must be imprinted with Agency information. This information is typically an environmental message, the EPA program officeâs URL or informational telephone number, or both. Imprinting an item with only the EPA seal or Agency identifier without an environmental or educational message is not sufficient.\n\nTop of page\n\nRestrictions on Cost\n\nItems that cost less than $2.00/unit: Items with a unit acquisition cost of $2.00 or less (including the pro-rated shipping cost and the production/printing cost) are presumed to have insignificant utility and cost and, therefore, meet the ânecessary expenseâ test (as long as they are on the list of allowed items).\n\nItems between $2.00 and $6.00 per unit or âgreenâ novelty items: If an itemâs cost is over $2.00, but less than $6.00, and the item has some utility, and the program office can demonstrate benefits from âgreenâ sourcing, then these environmental considerations may overcome what otherwise might be an itemâs disqualifying cost. Under these circumstances, the limit of $2.00 per item can be waived and can rise to $6.00 per item, unless the item is on the prohibited items list.\n\nTop of page\n\nAllowed and Prohibited Items\n\nExamples of items which might be appropriate for distribution to the general public or federal employees include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\nPens/pins Bookmarks Pencils Mouse pads Magnets Lanyards Posters Buttons Signs Bumper stickers Key chains/fobs Water bottles Plastic cups Ceramic or glass coffee mugs Drinking glasses Letter-opener, from corn plastic\n\nPurchase of these items is prohibited. Examples include, but are not limited to the following:\n\nUmbrellas\n\nGolf balls\n\nCandy and other food items\n\nTote bags (see theÂ EPA Acquisition Guide (EPAAG)Â Â Intranetfor exceptions)\n\nToys, unless the toy primarily functions as an educational/experimental tool\n\nApparel (T-shirts, scarves, caps, jackets, etc.)\n\nTop of page\n\nAcquisition Procedure and Justification\n\nThe requesting office must describe through the product review process the outreach or educational purpose that will be served by purchasing the item. In providing this information, the program office shall provide the information that will be imprinted on each item and the expected cost per item including shipping and production or printing costs.\n\nTop of page\n\nItems Used as Awards\n\nItems used as awards to recognize accomplishments of federal employees or non-federal entities fall into a category different from novelty items. Please refer to theÂ EPA Acquisition Guide (EPAAG)Â IntranetÂ for the process and authorities for this category of acquisitions."
