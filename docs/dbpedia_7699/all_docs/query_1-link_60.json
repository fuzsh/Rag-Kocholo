        "text": "Blank looks are the common response from most of today’s Gunners when in answer to a question “in which regiments have you served” the reply is 6thÂ Field Regiment, 12thÂ Field Regiment, 4th Field Regiment, 8/12 Medium Regiment and 28 ANZUK Field Regiment. It is the last-28th ANZUK-that elicits the blank looks. It is the forgotten Regiment since only two Australian artillery batteries served as part of it; 108 Field Battery served for less than two months and 106 Field Battery from January 1972 until January 1974.\n\nUntil 1971 the British Commonwealth maintained a presence in Malaysia in the form of the 28th Commonwealth Brigade. In 1971 it was announced that a new arrangement would see Australian, New Zealand and British troops remain in Singapore and Malaysia under an Australian commander of two star rank. The troops were to operate under the Five Power Defence Arrangements Â which stated that Singapore and Malaysia were to be responsible for their own defence with Australia, New Zealand and the UK committed to “immediately consult” with the Malaysian and Singaporean Governments should any attack or threat of attack be made against them. The creation of an ANZUK Force on 1 November 1971 provided the tangible military commitment to the Arrangements.\n\nThe ANZUK Force consisted of 7,500 uniformed personnel from the three services as well as 4.750 locally employed civilians. The Force was tri-service and structured as follows:\n\nNaval Component based in Singapore-two Royal Navy (RN) Frigates, Royal Australian Navy (RAN) and Royal New Zealand Navy (RNZN)frigates and a submarine drawn from either the RN or RAN.\n\nArmy Component based in Singapore- 28th ANZUK Brigade:\n\nInfantry - 6th Battalion Royal Australian Regiment, 1st Battalion Royal New Zealand Infantry Regiment,Â 1st Battalion Royal Highland Fusiliers\n\nArtillery â 28th Field Regiment comprising an Australian field battery, a British field battery and a combined Australian/British HQ Battery\n\nEngineers-28th Field Squadron\n\nArmy Aviation Squadron\n\nBrigade Signals Squadron\n\nAir Force â mainly concentrated in Butterworth, Malaysia.Â No 3 and No 75 Squadrons Royal Australian Air Force (Mirages). Based at Tengah were Royal Air Force Shackletons and Whirlwind helicopters as well as Royal New Zealand Air Force Bristol freighters and 41 Squadron Iroquois helicopters.\n\nANZUK Support Group comprised 24 integrated units (UK, NZ and Australian service personnel) and provided all logistic support to the Force.\n\nANZUK Force Units consisted of9 ANZUK Signal Regiment, ANZUK Traffic and Management Agency, ANZUK Intelligence and Security Unit and 65 Ground Liaison Section. All integrated units.\n\nThe Gunners\n\nThe Regiment\n\nThe 28th ANZUK Field Regiment had been raised officially on 1st August 1971 with an Australian battery (108 based at Selarang) and a British battery (1st Light) and an integrated Headquarters based at Nee Soon Barracks. The arrival of 106 Field Battery RAA in Singapore in January 1972 to join 1st Light Battery RA “The Blazers” in Nee Soon Barracks marked the formation proper of 28th ANZUKÂ Field Regiment The Commanding Officer was a British scholar and gentleman Lieutenant Colonel Trefor Jones-not a misspelling; his name was Trefor. Â His Second-in âCommand an Australian Gunner of reputation, Major Noel Delahunty, MC with Major Bill Hills RA commanding 1st Light Battery and the loquacious Major Jim Townley commanding 106 Field Battery RAA. HQ Battery was a polyglot of Brits, Australians and the odd Kiwi.\n\nNegotiations on sharing the Mess began with a meeting of the President of the Mess Committee, a gallant and erudite gentleman serving as Second -in-Command of 1 RHF (2IC), Majors Noel Delahunty RAA, Jim Townley RAA, Bill Hills RA aided and abetted by the Battery Captains (BKs) Ian Ahearn RAA and John Hooton RA.Â Noel began proceedings by pointing to a stack of paintings and photographs of things Gunner and demanded a place to display them in the Mess. “Absolutely no problem” was the Fusilier’s reply. Noel then moved onto dining arrangements with particular emphasis on Regiment mixed dining-in nights. Â The Scot’s response was amused-“Oh Noel we don’t have women in the Mess; it doesn’t work. We tried it once...1725 I believe”.\n\nNoel, never lost for words rasped “What, no women but you allow dogs in the Mess!” “Oh Yes” replied the unfazed Fusilier, “After all dogs are a man’s best friend”.Â At this stage Bill Hills RAA sipped on his gin and tonic and observed in a clear voice “Kinky!”Â Epilogue to the tale; 28 ANZUK Field Regiment allowed women in the Mess and conducted mixed dining-in nights. Dogs also remained.\n\nSharing the Mess with the Royal Highland Fusiliers was both informative and educational. Â No one was expected to speak at breakfast and the subalterns did not leave the mess until after morning tea. No cash was used in the Mess; all purchases were made on chits leading to some shocks at the end of the month.\n\nThe Gun Batteries\n\n1st Light Battery RA “The Blazers” were raised on the 1st August 1779. The Battery moved to Ireland in 1821 and then in 1825 moved to Nova Scotia, Canada before returning to the UK and Woolwich in 1832. War with Russia loomed in 1854 and the Battery was sent to the Crimea landing at Balaclava on 27th December. Â In 1856 the Battery was withdrawn from the Crimea and took up residence in Ireland once again. Reorganisation of the artillery in 1859 led to the Battery being renamed F Battery and as such was posted to India in 1869. Redesignated N Battery in 1877, it remained in India until 1884 when it returned to Ireland then moved to Leeds and in 1889 became 1st Field Battery Royal Artillery.\n\nIn 1896 the Battery returned to Kirkee in India with four officers, 155 NCOs and men, 11 women and 22 children.Â Accompanied postings are not new! Woolwich became the Battery home again in 1910. World War 1 found the Battery in France and in action on 16th November 1914 at Aubers. This was followed by participation in the Battle of Neuve Chapelle in March 1915. Action followed in the Battle of Loos in 1915, the Somme in 1916, and Ypres 1917 where in February 1918 the Battery position was gassed as a prelude to the German Spring Offensive of 1918\n\nOn 27th May 1918, the Battery suffered its worst casualties of the War when five guns in action at Bois de Mines became surrounded and although the order to remove breech blocks was given, none made it back, and only eight survivors reached the wagon lines.Â The Battery withdrew for the rest of May and thereafter saw no further action till October and the final Allied Advance to Victory.Â The last day in action for the Battery in the Great War was 27th October 1918.\n\nAfter the Great War the Battery returned to peace time soldiering first in the UK then another tour of India where it remained until the outbreak of World War 2. Another reorganisation including mechanisation of the RA was carried out in 1939 and the Battery was designated as Â 1/5 Field Battery RA, 28 Field Regiment RA. The Battery was deployed to the Sudan and fired their first shots in anger at Kassala. Action in Eritrea followed and after the defeat of the Italians in Eritrea the Battery left for Cyprus in November.Â On 15th November 1/5 Battery became 1st Field Battery RA once again and remained in Cyprus as part of 28th Field Regiment in the 7th Indian Division until March 1942. In May a major German attack succeeded in over-running all four artillery regiments.Â Nearly all the guns and vehicles and most of the personnel of 28 Field Regiment were captured; only the men in the wagon lines and MT got away.\n\nFollowing the Cyprus disaster the Battery was reformed and posted to India in 1943 and then to Arakan in December 1943 where the Japanese were encountered for the first time. The Battery took part in the offensives of 1944 and the fierce fighting around Imphal and Kohima and the subsequent pursuit of the Japanese into Burma. In November 1944 the 1st Field Battery was flown out to India to refit. After refitting it was again committed to the Burma campaign in April 1945 and participated in 14th Army’s pursuit of the broken Japanese Army\n\nAs a result of the American atomic bombing of Nagasaki and Hiroshima on 6th and 9th August 1945, the Japanese forces in Burma surrendered to the Allies on 15th August; thus ended five years of war for 28th Field Regiment and therefore the Battery. They had served with distinction on two Continents, and fought all three of the axis powers: the Italians in East Africa, the Germans in the Western Desert and the Japanese in Burma.\n\nThe Battery left India in 1947and disembarked in Liverpool marking 21 years of continuous overseas service. Their homecoming did not last long as they moved to Hong Kong in 1949 and then with the outbreak of the Korean War they again came into action in November 1951.\n\nFollowing Korea the 1st Battery bounced between Hong Kong, Aden and Hong Kong again, UK, Germany and then Malaysia as part of the 28th Commonwealth Brigade. Returning to UK in 1969 the Battery then saw service in Northern Ireland in an infantry role. In July 1971 1st Light Battery RA (The Blazers) joined 28th ANZUK Field Regiment in Singapore.\n\nThe Australian batteries that formed part of the 28th ANZUK Field Regiment, as appropriate in the New World, had no extended pedigree. They were born out of the expansion of the Australian Army to deal with the Vietnam War.\n\nThe first Australian battery to serve was the 108th Field Battery RAA. The 108th was raised in 1965 and saw service Vietnam 1967/68 before moving to Singapore in 1969. In January 1972, 106th Field Battery RAA (The Turtles) replaced 108th Battery. 106th Battery was formed in December 1966 at Wacol, Queensland as part of the 4th Field Regiment RAA. The battery left for its first tour of Vietnam between April 1967 and March 1968. The second tour of duty of Vietnam was between February 1970 and January 1971. As your author was the BK (Battery Captain) of 106th Field Battery this story will be told mainly from that organisation’s perspective. The third battery was a “ghost “battery that only visited the Regiment in 1972; 161 Field Battery RNZA. Their visit was memorable for the “bazaar” they set up on the square at Nee Soon Garrison, an adventure that had the Regiment’s RSM in a state of apoplexy for a week.Â The Kiwis fitted seamlessly into the Regiment but there time in Singapore was brief.\n\nThe People\n\nAn eclectic mix would be the best description of the personalities that made up 28th ANZUK Field Regiment, hereafter called the Regt to simplify reference. The same could be said of the parent formation, 28th ANZUK Brigade ably lead by Brigadier Mike Walsh. Brigadier “Mike”, as he became known to all and sundry was introduced to the unique flavour of 106 Battery when presented with a plaque from the “Bombers”, the battery Australian Rules Football Club.\n\nThe Commanding Officer was central to the military precision and pomp of the mounted parade. Under Trefor Jones the clear, concise, clipped commands would ring out over the parade ground;\n\n“Regiment-attention shun! Regiment Mount! Regiment Start Up” and finally “Regiment Drive Past!”\n\nOn the first order the assembled troops would come to attention and officers would salute. On the “mount “order the officers would come down from the salute, and all would smartly move to their vehiclesÂ with officersÂ and Gun Sergeants standing and left arm braced on the windshield. On “Start Up” the drivers would start their engines and when each vehicle was turning over the vehicle commander would raise his right arm to signify the vehicle was ready to move. On the order “Drive Past” the vehicles, by batteries, would move forward in turn. It was a delight to behold.\n\nThe first parade with the new commanding officer in January 1973 things did not” go according to Hoyle”. Â The troops, vehicles and guns were positioned by the RSM; the officers posted by the Adjutant, the parade handed over to the Second-in Command and finally to Lieutenant Colonel Delahunty, lord of us all. The Colonel took a deep breath and roared out “RRREGIMENT ARRRGH”.\n\n1st Light Battery RA came to attention, half the officers saluted, the other half climbed into their vehicles. 106th Field Battery RAA did not move at all, at least not until the Battery CommanderÂ saluted then gazed around-saw that some Brits had climbed into their vehicles and did likewise. Half the battery followed. Half of Headquarter Battery saluted, climbed in their vehicles, started them and began to move.Â The Commanding Officer stared in disbelief at the events he had put in train, about turned and marched off the parade ground.\n\nA few minutes of general milling occurred before the Second-in-Command plucked up the courage to scamper of the parade ground to seek further guidance. He reappeared from the Headquarter building to call for the Adjutant who scurried off merely to quickly appear again and order “Fall Out the Officers”! We gathered behind the building to be told that regardless of what the Commanding Officer appeared to order on any given parade we were to:\n\nCome to attention-pause two three\n\nSalute âpause two three-Mount up-pause two three-Start up-pause two three\n\nWait for the Commanding Officer to mount his vehicle then Drive Off in order.\n\nWe did exactly that for the next year."
