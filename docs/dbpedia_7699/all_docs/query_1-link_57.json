        "text": "Papua\n\nThe 6th Division deployed to Papua within weeks of arriving home, departing Brisbane on 13th September 1942 aboard the Anhui, in company with corvette HMAS Lithgow, and docking in Port Moresby on 21st September.\n\nHMAS Lithgow\n\nLieutenants Francis Duval, Ted Jackson-Hope, Keith Stuart-Wright and Alex Simpson established a rear details detachment; Lieutenants Andrew Murray and Max Long (wounded Oct 1942) were detached to 16th Brigade as liaison officers); Captain Ted Givney and Lieutenant Frederick Allery MM were detached with the Carriers Platoons of 2/2nd and 2/3rd Battalions as 16th Brigade Carriers Company and used in the defence of Port Moresby during the Kokoda Campaign.\n\nThe 2/1st stepped onto the Kokoda Track on 28th September 1942. The first evacuation with malaria was Corporal Ken Hammond. The battalion was particularly central in the action around Templeton's Crossing and Eora Creek (19-28th October), and Oivi–Gorari (8-11th November 1942). Progress along the Track was necessarily slow:\n\n2 Oct – Ower's Corner\n\n6 Oct – Uberi\n\n7 Oct – Imita Ridge and Ioribaiwa\n\n8 Oct – Nauro\n\n11 Oct – Menari\n\n14 Oct – Brigade Hill, Mission Ridge and Efogi\n\n15 Oct – Myola\n\n19-28 Oct – Templeton's Crossing, Kokoda Ridge and Eora Creek\n\n5 Nov – Alola, Isurava, Deniki and Kokoda\n\n8-11 Nov – Oivi and Gorari\n\n16 Nov – Wairopi\n\n18 Nov – Awala and Popondetta\n\n20 Nov – Soputa\n\nArguably, one of the saddest events of the campaign was the loss of brothers, Guy Manusu (23rd October) and Perry Manusu (27th October) at Eora Creek. They had enlisted on the same day as one another and joined the 2/1st Battalion in Palestine (Israel). A third brother, Percy, who had been with the battalion from the start, was subsequently transferred to the training battalion in Australia by the commanding officer to ensure his safety."
