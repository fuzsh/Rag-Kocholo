Packouz joined forces with Efraim Diveroli in September 2005 at AEY Inc., an arms company that quickly secured numerous contracts worth millions. Their notable achievement was a nearly $300 million contract in 2007 to supply the Afghan Army with vast quantities of ammunition, which controversially included prohibited Chinese ammunition, leading to significant legal and ethical issues. Packouz played a key role in concealing the origin of these munitions, resulting in a sentence of seven months of house arrest for conspiracy to defraud the United States. His story caught public attention and was later depicted in the 2016 film \"War Dogs\" starring Myles Teller as David and Jonah Hill as Efraim. David also made a cameo appearance. Beyond his controversial past, Packouz has established himself as an inventor and CEO of Singular Sound, where he developed the BeatBuddy, a guitar pedal drum machine, showcasing his transition from arms dealing to music technology.\n\nwww.getsome.com.au\n\nInstagram @getsome_au\n\nDiscount Code\n\nZEROLIMITS\n\nwww.3zeroscoffee.com.au\n\nInstargram @3zeroscoffee\n\nDiscount Code\n\n3ZLimits\n\nWebsite - www.zerolimitspodcast.com\n\nInstagram - https://www.instagram.com/zero.limits.podcast/?hl=en\n\nSend us a Text Message.\n\nOn today's Zero Limits Podcast I have a chat with Paddy Baker former 2nd Battalion Royal Australian Regiment and now blacksmith of axes and knives with his own business called Jack and The Bear.\n\nPaddy joined the Army Reserve in 2006 while completing his carpentry apprenticeship. After some time in reserves Paddy completed his civilian apprenticeship and enlisted into the regular army posting to 2RAR. Paddy deployed to Timor and the Paddy was on the same deployment as previous guests such as @coralsearc “Fabs”, @your.mate.wilso “Kyle Wilson”, @chrismay_aus , @adsietk , which his story adds another perspective during some major incidents that happened on that Afghanistan deployment. After returning back from Afghanistan Paddy attempted and completed SASR selection however he was not selected. A couple years later he yet again attempted SASR selection and once again completed and this time was selected to continue into the reinforcement special force training cycle. A few months into training Paddy was involved in an incident which resulted in an injury that ended his military career. Post military service Paddy had an interest in Blacksmithing focussing on axes and knives in which he has now turned it into a fulltime business.\n\nwww.getsome.com.au\n\nInstagram @getsome_au\n\nDiscount Code\n\nZEROLIMITS\n\nwww.3zeroscoffee.com.au\n\nInstargram @3zeroscoffee\n\nDiscount Code\n\n3ZLimits\n\nWebsite - www.zerolimitspodcast.com\n\nInstagram - https://www.instagram.com/zero.limits.podcast/?hl=en\n\nSend us a Text Message.\n\nOn today's Zero Limits Podcast I chat with Dustin Watts former NZ Police Special Tactics Group (STG) and Private Security Contractor.\n\nDustin joined the NZ Police in 1996 and spent 8 years as a general duties officer and in 2003 Dustin successfully completed selection and training to become an Operator in the Special Tactics Group.
