VI, p.74-77 (Sydney, Grolier Society of Australia, 1965). Two other useful papers are Brigadier M. Austin's 'Army records in Australia, 1788-1901' in Second Australasian Congress on Genealogy and Heraldry. Papers, 1980 (Adelaide, South Australian Genealogy and Heraldry Society, 1980), and Graham Thom's 'Chelsea pensioners in nineteenth century Australia' in Bridging the Generations: Fourth Australasian Congress on Genealogy and Heraldry, Canberra 1986 (Canberra, The Heraldry and Genealogy Society of Canberra Inc., 1986).\n\nEarly History\n\nThe office was first made a political appointment in 1704, but it was not until 1783 that the Secretary-at-War was made responsible to Parliament. As a result of Burke's Act for Economical Reform, the payment of troops and expenditure on recruiting became the responsibility not of the regiments, but of the Secretary-at-War, thereby rendering him responsible for the expenditure of public moneys and thus responsible to Parliament.\n\nIn 1793 the office of Commander-in-Chief was revived, and in 1794 a Secretary of State for War was appointed. In theory, the latter office became responsible to Parliament and assumed jurisdiction over all aspects of Army policy, while the Secretary-at-War remained independent and shared with the Commander-in-Chief the duty of providing the military forces required. However, the powers of these three positions were never clearly defined.\n\n1801-1845\n\nThe Secretary of State for War became Secretary of State for War and the Colonies in 1801, becoming increasingly absorbed in Colonial affairs until the two offices were finally separated in 1854. Meanwhile there ensued a power struggle between the offices of Secretary-at-War and Commander-in-Chief.\n\nThe Secretary-at-War was still responsible to Parliament for all aspects relating to finance of the Army. However, neither he nor the Commander-in-Chief possessed any authority over provision of materials for the Army. This was the responsibility of another body, the Board of Ordnance, which provided all arms and stores except the clothing of the Army, and was also responsible for barracks and fortifications. The Master-General of the Ordnance controlled the pay and discipline of the Royal Artillery and Royal Engineers.\n\nProvision of food for the Army fell under the jurisdiction of the Commissariat; the office of Commissary General was abolished in 1816, and the Commissariat then became an offshoot of the Treasury. The inspection of clothing for the Cavalry and Infantry was the function of a Board of General Officers, while medical stores were provided by a Medical Department financially responsible to the Secretary-at-War, but in matters of discipline to the Commander-in-Chief. The Judge Advocate General's Office was responsible for all courts martial in the Army.\n\n1854-1870\n\nThis situation of administrative responsibility for the Army being fragmented among the above departments did not begin to change until 1854. In that year the Colonial Office became distinct from the War Office, and in 1855 the offices of Secretary-at-War and Secretary of State for War were amalgamated. The next step was the abolition of the Board of Ordnance, its military functions of administration being transferred to the Commander-in-Chief, and its civil duties to the Secretary of State. The newly amalgamated Department adopted the title 'the War Office' in 1857, and in 1858 consolidated its offices by moving to new headquarters in Pall Mall.\n\nAlthough the War Office now discharged all civil administrative functions, military authority was still vested in the Horse Guards, and the office of Commander-in-Chief. The resulting struggle between military and ministerial control of the Army was to continue for a long time.\n\nIn 1863 the office of Secretary-at-War was formally abolished, and by the War Office Act of 1870 direct control of all branches of Army administration was vested in the Secretary of State for War.\n\nAlthough administrative reform of the War Office did not cease with the War Office Act, it provides a convenient cut-off date for the purposes of a background history to the War Office records copied under the auspices of the Australian Joint Copying Project. The records filmed relate mainly to Australia and New Zealand and deal with most of the offices mentioned above. Troops in the Colonies were under the control of each Governor, although administratively they were controlled from London. Thus a great deal of material concerning troops and defence, especially before 1840, is to be found in the Governors' despatches in the Colonial Office records. In 1870 the Colonies became responsible for their own defences.\n\nSecretaries of State for the War Office 1794-1880\n\n1794 Dundas, Henry\n\n1801 Hobart, Lord Robert\n\n1804 Camden, John Earl\n\n1805 Castlereagh, Robert, Viscount\n\n1806 Windham, William\n\n1807 Castlereagh, Robert, Viscount\n\n1809 Liverpool, Robert, Earl\n\n1812 Bathurst, Henry, Earl\n\n1827 April Goderich, Frederick, Viscount\n\n1827 August Huskisson, William\n\n1828 Murray, Sir George\n\n1830 Goderich, Frederick, Viscount\n\n1833 Stanley, Edward Geoffrey\n\n1834 June Spring-Rice, Thomas\n\n1834 December Aberdeen, George, Earl\n\n1835 Grant, Charles\n\n1839 February Normanby, Constantine Henry, Marquis\n\n1839 August Russell, Lord John\n\n1841 Stanley, Lord Edward\n\n1845 Gladstone, William Ewart\n\n1846 Grey, Henry, Earl\n\n1852 March Pakington, Sir John Somerset\n\n1852 December Newcastle, Henry, Duke\n\n1855 Panmure, Fox, Baron\n\n1858 Peel, Jonathan\n\n1859 Herbert, Sidney\n\n1861 Lewis, Sir George Cornewall\n\n1863 Ripon, George, Earl\n\n1866 February Hartington, Spencer, Marquis\n\n1866 July Peel, Jonathan\n\n1867 Packington, Sir John Somerset\n\n1868 Cardwell, Edward\n\n1874 Hardy, Gathorne\n\n1878 Stanley, Frederick Arthur\n\n1880 Childers, Hugh Culling Eardley"
