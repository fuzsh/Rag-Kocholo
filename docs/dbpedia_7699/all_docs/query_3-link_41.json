        "text": "This bronze plaque commemorates the departure of the First Royal Australian Regiment for service in the Korean War. It is mounted on the sandstone escarpment in the Sydney Opera House forecourt at East Circular Quay.\n\nPositioned on the wall next to it is the A.N.M.E.F. Commemorative Plaque, Circular Quay.\n\nThe First Battalion of the Royal Australian Regiment embarked from this place on 3 March 1952, for the war in Korea and returned to the same wharf on 8 April 1953.\n\nTogether with the Second and Third Battalions of the Regiment, ships and aircraft of the Royal Australian Navy and aircraft of the Royal Australian Airforce, the First Battalion formed Australia's contribution to the 21 country United Nations force engaged in Korea between 25 June, 1950 and 27 July, 1953.\n\nDuring World War I 1914–1918 and World War II 1939–1945 the City of Sydney raised the First Infantry Battalion A.I.F. and the 2/1st Infantry Battalion Second A.I.F. which both sailed from and returned to Sydney Harbour."
