        "text": "Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race, 1998\n\nOn Christmas Day, a storm equivalent to a force 12 hurricane storm, brought forth 10-15 metre swells and 60 knot winds, causing havoc among the participants of the Sydney to Hobart race. Overnight, the Royal Australian Navy began preparing for the coordination of Australia’s largest peacetime search and rescue operation to date.\n\nNaval Airmen and Crewman from Fleet Air Arm 816 Squadron aboard an S-70B-2 Seahawk helicopter - ‘Tiger 75’ were on their way back to Nowra at 10pm on 28 December for a night’s rest when the Seahawk helicopter picked up one last signal from two Winston Churchill crew members in a life raft. This was significant as communication with those onboard had been considered lost. The crew of the Seahawk turned around, flying into perhaps one of the most dangerous rescue operations of their entire naval careers.\n\nThere were 36 knot winds and 15-18-metre seas. Flying in an aircraft 80-100 miles off the coast in pitch black and cloudy conditions. They could see there were two people in a life raft but couldn’t communicate with them, with the huge swells the life raft would be 20 feet below the helicopter one minute, and then 50 feet below the helicopter the next, and moving away from it.\n\nThe winchman prepared to go down to the raft, once in the ocean the winchman began swimming towards the life raft while dragging the winch cable behind him. Holding onto the side of the raft he determined that one of the crew members was injured and it was decided that he was to be winched first. When the strop was around the crew members head the helicopter’s RADALT automatic hover control tripped due to the severe conditions, and they both got pulled out of the life raft straight into a 40-foot wave.\n\nWhile the aircrew were fighting to get the aircraft back under control, the winchman was fighting to hang on to crew members of the Winston Churchill as they got smashed into wave after wave. After getting back to the aircraft the crew deemed it too risky for the winchman to go back into the water again due to the aircraft malfunction. A strop was instead sent down on its own for the remaining crew member. After being lifted into the aircraft, even though two more crew members of the Winston Churchill were still missing, the Seahawk crew prioritised getting those rescued to land for medical attention and passed this information on to a Seaking helicopter that was still operating in the area. Fortunately those in the second life raft had been picked up on the same day."
