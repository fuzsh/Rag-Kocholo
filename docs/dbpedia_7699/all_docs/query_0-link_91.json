        "text": "In 1945 Australia sent three units to Japan as part of the British Commonwealth Occupation Force (BCOF). Originally known as the 65th, 66th and 67th Infantry Battalions, they were raised from Australian divisions stationed in New Guinea at the end of the Second World War. On 23 November 1948, the battalions were renamed the First, Second and Third Battalion, The Australian Regiment, respectively. The prefix Royal was granted by King George VI on 31 March 1949.\n\nThe Australian battalions sent to the Malayan Emergency formed part of the 28th Commonwealth Infantry Brigade Group (CIBG). CIBG was part of the British Commonwealth Far East Strategic Reserve (FESR). FESR comprised British, Australian, New Zealand, and Malayan troops. Australian officers commanded the Australian battalions in Malaya. However, the operations that 1RAR carried out were part of a larger strategy that required cooperation from the FESR and the Malayan army. Efforts were directed against the Communist terrorists.\n\n1RAR arrived in Singapore on 2 October 1959. It began operations in Malaya on 9 November after spending a month training and acclimatising. The battalion was stationed at Minden Barracks, located in the foothills on the eastern side of the island. Although Minden was the nominal home of the battalion while it was in Malaya, it rarely spent any length of time there. Operations could last for days or weeks at a time, and breaks between operations were brief. During its period of service in Malaya, the battalion operated with three rifle companies, instead of the usual four.\n\nThe first operation 1RAR took part in was Operation Bamboo, which began on 9 November. Bamboo was a deep jungle search in Upper Perak on the ThaiMalay border. 1RAR remained in the jungles of the border area for 18 months, working to eliminate small groups of terrorists. It was monotonous and frustrating work. It was not uncommon for rain to wipe out tracks that were being followed, or for the terrorists to cross over the border into Thailand, where they could not be followed.\n\nOperation Magnet began in April 1960. This operation was the first time that FESR units were able to track the terrorists across the Thai border. They then attempted to drive the terrorists into Malaya, where units from the 28th Brigade were waiting in ambush. Unfortunately, the operation did not result in any engagements.\n\nOperation Jackforce began in June. It used the same approach that was employed during Magnet, except this time the 28th Brigade crossed the border while the Malayan units waited in ambush. This resulted in one contact with the terrorists.\n\nOn 31 July 1960, the Malayan Prime Minister Tunka Abdul Rahman signed a proclamation declaring that the emergency was over. Although this was the formal end of the Emergency, 1RAR continued on operations in Malaya until the end of its tour of duty in October 1961. It departed for Australia on 29 October, 1961.

Marson, DSO, assumed command of the Battalion which commenced immediate preparations for redeployment to Moratai, where 34th Infantry Brigade was being concentrated. Every member of the unit was a volunteer for service in Japan where the Battalion served from February 1946 until its return to Australia in December 1948.\n\nThe unit was redesignated 'Ist Battalion, Australian Regiment' in November 1948. January 1949 saw another change when the unite was redesignated 'Ist Battalion, The Royal Australian Regiment' (1 RAR) following the granting by King George VII of Royal Assent to the formation of the Royal Australian Regiment (RAR).\n\nThe Korean War began in 1950 and 3 RAR was quickly dispatched to assist Australia's allies. 1 RAR, then located in Japan, was tasked to receive, train and prepare reinforcements for the Korean threat. 1 RAR did not reach Korea until March 1952. It was to be two long months before the Battalion saw action for the first time. On this occasion, 1 RAR was subjected to heavy concentrations of enemy mortar and artillery fire.\n\n1 RAR returned to Australia in April 1953, having suffered 43 men killed and 170 men wounded in action. The Battalion conducted a second tour of Korea commencing March 1954 and saw many intensive actions prior to returning to Australia in April 1956.\n\nThe Battalion conducted extensive retraining in the period April 1956 to September 1959, then embarked for service in Malaya. In the two year tour that followed, 1 RAR participated in numerous anti-communist counter-insurgency operations as part of a joint Commonwealth programme in support of the Malaysian Government. 1 RAR then returned to Australia in October 196 1.\n\nThe Australian Government's response to the communist threat in South Vietnam resulted in 1 RAR being dispatched for two tours of duty in that country., the first, from May 1965 to June 1966 and the second from March 1968 to February 1969. The Battalion achieved significant operational success during both tours, receiving a Unit Commendation during the first from General W. C. Westmoreland (Commander U.S. Forces, South Vietnam) and in winning great distinction during the second for its efforts in defence of Fire Support Base 'Coral' (12th-16th May, 1968). 1 RAR returned to Australia with the combined losses of 54 men killed and 295 wounded in action. Enemy losses were considerable.\n\nIn 1969 the Battalion departed for garrison duties in Malaysia and then in December 1969 moved to Singapore where it remained for a further seven months prior to deploying to Townsville in 1970.\n\nOn the 23rd May, 1987 the Battalion deployed a Company Group on Operation Morris Dance to assist, if necessary, with the evacuation of civilians from Fiji following the military coup. This was the first operational deployment of Australian troops since Vietnam.\n\nOn the 17th December 1992, the Battalion was warned for duty in Somalia to provide the basis of a Battalion Group in support of 'Operation Restore Hope'. 'me Battalion Group conducted over 1100 foot patrols resulting in seven Somalian KIA, four WIA and 70 Somalians handed to the auxiliary security forces. The Battalion confiscated 935 weapons of various types and ensured safe delivery of 83 11 tonnes of humanitarian relief supplies. The Battalion returned to Australia on 22nd May 1993, and marched through Townsville to a rousing welcome home by the people of the city.\n\nThroughout this time the Battalion has been actively involved in major exercises throughout Australia, overseas military exchanges and has on occasions provided much needed assistance to the North Queensland community in times of emergencies such as natural disasters.\n\nThe Battalion continues to develop the skills and techniques to fulfil its present role as part of the Operational Deployment Force of the Australian Defence Force."
