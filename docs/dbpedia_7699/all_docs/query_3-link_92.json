His Citation reads as follows : For acts of gallantry in hazardous circumstances on the 24th of August 2010 while a platoon sergeant and mentor with Mentoring Team Delta, the 1st Mentoring Taskforce at Derapet, Tangi Valley Afghanistan. His gallant actions in contact with a numerically superior and entrenched enemy, in rallying the soldiers and coordinating their return fire, gained time for both Australian and Afghan Soldiers to move into supporting positions. He then bravely led a frontal assault under heavy enemy fire to clear the enemy from their entrenched position, and subsequently disregarded his own safety while coordinating the partnered patrol to defeat the enemies counterattacks.\n\nwww.getsome.com.au\n\nInstagram @getsome_au\n\nDiscount Code\n\nZEROLIMITS\n\nwww.3zeroscoffee.com.au\n\nInstargram @3zeroscoffee\n\nDiscount Code\n\n3ZLimits"
