        "text": "The square and memorial were associated with the City of Sydney strategic plan in 1971, which provided for local precinct action plans. Part of these plans included closing minor roadways and lanes to create pedestrian plazas. Streets affected under this plan included Martin Place, which became Sydney’s first pedestrian plaza in 1972, and Wynyard Street, which was closed to traffic and transformed into a pedestrian plaza in 1973.\n\nThe Bank of New South Wales and the Bank of New Zealand each contributed $10,000 toward streetscaping costs.\n\nAt first the name Kapyong Square was chosen for the pedestrianised square, commemorating the battle of the Korean War. This was recommended to the Geographical Names Board of NSW. The Royal Australian Regiment later requested the name be changed to Regimental Square to honour the memorial and to recognise that the site was part of the Army Barracks in the early 19th century.\n\nService members and other organisations and individuals paid for the work on the memorial wall, which was unveiled on 8 December 1976 by Sir Roden Cutler, the Governor of NSW. Alderman Leo Port, the Mayor of Sydney, officially opened Regimental Square at the same function.\n\nThe memorial was handed over by the Royal Australian Regiment Association to the City of Sydney on the same day."
