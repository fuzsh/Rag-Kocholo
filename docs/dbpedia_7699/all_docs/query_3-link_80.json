It consists of four regular and two reserve battalions, plus an incremental company, each formerly an individual regiment (with the exception of the first battalion, which is an amalgamation of two regiments). However, most battalions maintain their former regimental pipes and drums to carry on the traditions of their antecedent regiments.\n\nHistory\n\nAs part of restructuring in the British Army, the Royal Regiment of Scotland's creation was announced by the Secretary of State for Defence, Geoff Hoon in the House of Commons on 16 December 2004, after the merger of several regiments and the reduction in total regular infantry battalions from 40 to 36 was outlined in the defence white paper, Delivering Security in a Changing World, several months earlier.\n\nThe regiment consists of a total of seven battalions: one of these was formed by the amalgamation of the Royal Scots and King's Own Scottish Borderers, while the others are each formed from one of the remaining single-battalion regiments of the Scottish Division. Of all of the new regiments formed following the announcement of 16 December 2004, the Royal Regiment of Scotland is the only one where the former regimental titles have been prominently retained with the new numbered battalion designations as subtitles. There is however a common regimental cap badge, tactical recognition flash (TRF), tartan, stable belt and Glengarry headdress but distinctively coloured hackles are also worn by each separate battalion on the Tam o' Shanter headdress to maintain their individual identity and the pipes and drums of each battalion continue to wear the ceremonial uniforms and tartans of their former regiments.\n\nAlong with the Rifles, the Royal Regiment of Scotland is also one of only two line infantry regiments to maintain its own regular military band within the Royal Corps of Army Music, which was formed through the amalgamation of the Highland band and Lowland band of the Scottish Division. In addition, there are two Territorial bands, the Highland Band and the Lowland Band of the Royal Regiment of Scotland, which are administered by the regiment's two Territorial battalions. The regiment also has its own Parachute Display Team, the Golden Lions (disbanded in 2011) and shinty team, the Scots Shinty Club.\n\nIn 1948, every regiment of line infantry was reduced to a single battalion. The subsequent process of reducing the overall number of infantry regiments in the Army through disbandment or amalgamation of the traditional county regiments that were formalised in the Childers Reforms of 1881 to form larger multi-battalion regiments, has continued to affect most of the British Army Infantry since the 1957 Defence White Paper outlined the first mergers. The creation of the Royal Regiment of Scotland encountered considerable opposition amongst former soldiers, conservatives and nationalist groups.\n\nThe new regiment is also primarily a kilted one and there are concerns that the much older Lowland units, which traditionally wore trews, will be effectively absorbed into a Highland tradition. However, the Ministry of Defence's case that change was necessary to enhance operational efficiency through economies of scale, improve and create more flexible conditions of service and to resolve chronic recruiting and retention problems amongst the eight single-battalion Scottish regiments appears to have been accepted by the majority of serving personnel, and indeed was recommended by the then Chief of the General Staff, Sir Mike Jackson. Jackson delegated the decision on how the reduction of battalions would be achieved to the Council of Scottish Colonels. The Council recommended that the Royal Scots should be amalgamated with the King's Own Scottish Borderers reflecting the former regiment's long term poor recruiting record and high reliance on Commonwealth recruits.\n\nThe status of the Black Watch was particularly controversial. When the confirmed plan to amalgamate the regiments was announced, 1st Battalion The Black Watch was deployed away from Basra at Camp Dogwood in a relatively dangerous region of Iraq. Hoon was accused by the SNP of \"stabbing the soldiers in the back\" and being motivated purely by political and administrative concerns, with little regard to the effect on morale. This controversy was further exacerbated in the minds of some by the fact that the Colonel of the Black Watch, Lieutenant-General Alistair Irwin, was a member of the Army Board at the time that the options to change the size and structure of the infantry by forming large regiments, including to amalgamate regiments of the Scottish Division into a single regiment, were being considered in the Ministry of Defence and final decisions taken.\n\nThe regiment was initially formed of six regular and two Territorial battalions on 28 March 2006. On 1 August 2006, the Royal Scots Battalion and King's Own Scottish Borderers Battalion were amalgamated into the 1st Battalion, Royal Scots Borderers, leaving the final regular roll of five regular battalions.\n\nIn 2012, as part of the Army 2020 reform package, it was announced that the 5th Battalion, while not losing its name, connection and history as the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders, would be reduced to the status of an incremental company, similar to the three companies in the Guards Division, and be transferred to become a permanent public duties unit in Scotland.\n\nOrganisation\n\nAll battalions in the Royal Regiment of Scotland, to preserve regional ties and former regimental identities, took the name of their former individual regiments. The order of battle is as follows:\n\nRegular battalions\n\nRoyal Scots Borderers, 1st Battalion – Specialist Infantry based in Aldershot under Specialised Infantry Group\n\nRoyal Highland Fusiliers, 2nd Battalion – Light Infantry Battalion, under 4th Infantry Brigade and Headquarters North East, at Glencorse Barracks, Penicuick\n\nThe Black Watch, 3rd Battalion – Light Mechanised Battalion, under 51st Infantry Brigade and Headquarters Scotland, at Fort George, Inverness\n\nThe Highlanders, 4th Battalion, Royal Regiment of Scotland – Converting to Strike Mechanised Infantry under Strike Expeditionary Force, at Bourlon Barracks, Catterick\n\nThe Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders, 5th Battalion, Royal Regiment of Scotland – Company sized; Balaklava Company in ceremonial duties role, at Redford Barracks, Edinburgh\n\nReserve battalions\n\n52nd Lowland Volunteers, 6th Battalion, Royal Regiment of Scotland – Reserve Light Infantry, HQ in Glasgow part of 4th Infantry Brigade and Headquarters North East, paired with 2 SCOTS\n\n51st Highland Volunteers, 7th Battalion, Royal Regiment of Scotland – Reserve Light Infantry, HQ in Perth part of 51st Infantry Brigade and Headquarters Scotland, paired with 3 SCOTS\n\nThe Regiment also has many bands:\n\nBand of the Royal Regiment of Scotland, at Dreghorn Barracks, Edinburgh\n\nLowland Band of the Royal Regiment of Scotland (Reserve) – Part of 6 SCOTS\n\nHighland Band of the Royal Regiment of Scotland (Reserve) – Part of 7 SCOTS\n\nPipe Bands:\n\nPipes and Drums of the Royal Highland Fusiliers, 2nd Battalion, Royal Regiment of Scotland\n\nPipes and Drums of The Black Watch, 3rd Battalion, Royal Regiment of Scotland\n\nPipes and Drums of The Highlanders, 4th Battalion, Royal Regiment of Scotland\n\nPipes and Drums of the 51st Highland Volunteers, 7th Battalion, Royal Regiment of Scotland (Reserve)\n\nAt the creation of the Regiment in 2006 there were two further Pipe Bands:\n\nPipes and Drums of the Royal Scots Borderers, 1st Battalion, Royal Regiment of Scotland. Disbanded 2021.\n\nPipes and Drums of the 52nd Lowland Volunteers, 6th Battalion, Royal Regiment of Scotland (Reserve). Converted to a civilian band 2007.\n\nThe Band of the Royal Regiment of Scotland falls within the Royal Corps of Army Music; the other two bands and the Pipes and Drums fall within their respective battalions.\n\nRegimental museum\n\nThe Museum of the Royal Scots (The Royal Regiment) and the Royal Regiment of Scotland is located in Edinburgh Castle. Operating as an independent museum, the exhibits include dioramas, uniforms, medals, weapons, drums, ceremonial regalia and silver. Displays focus on the regiment's activities since its founding up to contemporary Army life.\n\nColonel-in-chief\n\nThe regiment's Colonel-in-Chief is The Queen. The colonels-in-chief of the constituent regiments making up the new regiment have become the Royal Colonels of their representative battalions:\n\n1st Battalion: The Princess Royal\n\n2nd Battalion: The Duke of York\n\n3rd Battalion: The Duke of Rothesay\n\n4th Battalion: The Duke of Edinburgh\n\n5th Battalion: The Queen\n\n6th Battalion: The Princess Royal\n\n7th Battalion: The Duke of Rothesay\n\nThe Duke of Rothesay takes the title of Prince of Wales whilst outside Scotland.\n\nUniform and dress\n\nCap badge and motto\n\nIn August 2005, the new regimental cap badge was unveiled at the Edinburgh Military Tattoo. The design was the result of a collaborative effort, led by Brigadier Andrew Mackay, along with other serving and retired officers and Regimental Sergeant Majors, with advice from the Lord Lyon King of Arms. The new cap badge incorporates the Saltire of St Andrew and the Lion Rampant of the Royal Standard of Scotland, which are two prominent national symbols. The cap badge is surmounted by a crown, in this case the Crown of Scotland. The regiment's motto is Nemo Me Impune Lacessit (No One Assails Me With Impunity)—which is the motto of the Order of the Thistle, Scotland's highest order of chivalry, and was also the motto of four of the pre-existing Scottish regiments.\n\nDress\n\nThe new regiment's various Dress Uniforms incorporate a number of \"golden threads\" from the antecedent regiments. Some of the most prominent include:\n\nAll battalions wear the Lowland pattern Glengarry, this pattern was in fact also common to the Seaforth Highlanders and Gordon Highlanders, as well as the Lowland Royal Highland Fusiliers, Royal Scots and King's Own Scottish Borderers regiments.\n\nIn No. 1 and No. 2 pattern dress, all battalions wear Blackcock tail feathers attached to the Glengarry in a tradition taken from the Royal Scots and King's Own Scottish Borderers.\n\nThe regimental motto of the Highlanders, Cuidich 'n Righ (Aid the King), has been incorporated into the Royal Scots Thistle pattern collar dogs worn on the No.1 and No.2 pattern doublet or Service Dress jacket.\n\nThe tartan adopted by the new regiment is Government 1A (sometimes known as Sutherland), a version of the Government (Black Watch) tartan worn by the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders.\n\nThe Pipes and Drums of each battalion preserve the ceremonial dress of the antecedent regiments. Thus 2 SCOTS pipers and drummers wear Government no 11 tartan, Red Erskine, 3 SCOTS drummers wear no 1, Black Watch, and pipers wear Royal Stewart, 4 SCOTS pipers and drummers wear no 4, Cameron of Erracht, and 7 SCOTS pipers wear Royal Stewart.\n\nThe kilt is sewn in a box pleat style, as worn by the 2nd Battalion Black Watch, Seaforth Highlanders, Queen's Own Highlanders (Seaforth and Camerons) and the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders. The Sporran is in the horsehair style worn by the Seaforth Highlanders and Gordon Highlanders, with a brass Black Watch cantle.\n\nThe Black and Red diced Hose and scarlet Garter flashes are in a style worn by the Black Watch. The Spats with black buttons, worn over the Brogues, are in a style worn by the Gordon Highlanders, with a point to the rear, as worn by the Black Watch.\n\nThe Band of the Royal Regiment of Scotland wears the Feather bonnet with a red over white hackle and scarlet Doublet in Full Dress Uniform.\n\nHackles\n\nWhile in PCS combat dress, each battalion wears its own unique coloured hackle on the Tam O'Shanter:\n\n1st Battalion: Black\n\n2nd Battalion: White\n\n3rd Battalion: Red\n\n4th Battalion: Blue\n\n5th Battalion: Green\n\n6th Battalion: Grey\n\n7th Battalion: Purple\n\nMascot\n\nThe official mascot is a Shetland pony named Cruachan. He was originally the regimental mascot of the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders prior to the amalgamation. The first pony mascot was presented to the Argylls in 1929 by Princess Louise, Duchess of Argyll and named after Ben Cruachan, a mountain in the Argylls' namesake lieutenancy, and the war cry of Clan Campbell, of whom the Duke of Argyll was chief. The current mascot is a Shetland pony Cruachan IV who was presented in late 2012.\n\nAlliances\n\nHistoric alliances are as follows:\n\nCanada: The Canadian Scottish Regiment (Princess Mary's)\n\nCanada: Royal Newfoundland Regiment\n\nCanada: 1st Battalion, The Royal New Brunswick Regiment (Carleton and York)\n\nAustralia: 25th/49th Battalion, The Royal Queensland Regiment\n\nMalaysia: 5th Battalion, The Royal Malay Regiment\n\nSouth Africa: Bambatha Rifles\n\nRoyal Navy: HMS Edinburgh\n\nCanada: The Royal Highland Fusiliers of Canada\n\nNew Zealand: The Royal New Zealand Infantry Regiment\n\nPakistan: 11th Battalion, The Baloch Regiment\n\nSouth Africa: Chief Maqoma Regiment\n\nCanada: The Black Watch (Royal Highland Regiment) of Canada\n\nCanada: 42nd Field Artillery Regiment (Lanark and Renfrew Scottish), RCA\n\nCanada: The Prince Edward Island Regiment (RCAC)\n\nAustralia: The Royal Queensland Regiment\n\nAustralia: The Royal New South Wales Regiment\n\nSouth Africa: Solomon Mahlangu Regiment\n\nNew Zealand: The New Zealand Scottish\n\nRoyal Navy: HMS Montrose\n\nCanada: The Cameron Highlanders of Ottawa (Duke of Edinburgh's Own)\n\nCanada: The 48th Highlanders of Canada\n\nCanada: The Queen's Own Cameron Highlanders of Canada\n\nCanada: The Seaforth Highlanders of Canada\n\nCanada: The Toronto Scottish Regiment (Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother's Own)\n\nAustralia: 7th Battalion, The Royal Australian Regiment\n\nAustralia: 5th/6th Battalion, Royal Victoria Regiment (formerly 5th Battalion, The Victorian Scottish Regiment)\n\nAustralia: The Royal South Australia Regiment\n\nAustralia: 16th Battalion, The Royal Western Australia Regiment (formerly 16th Battalion, The Cameron Highlanders of Western Australia)\n\nNew Zealand: The Otago and Southland Regiment\n\nNew Zealand: The Wellington (City of Wellington's Own) and Hawke's Bay Regiment\n\nSouth Africa: Gonnema Regiment\n\nRoyal Navy: HMS Sutherland\n\nRoyal Navy: HMS Victorious\n\nCanada: The Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders of Canada (Princess Louise's)\n\nCanada: The Calgary Highlanders\n\nAustralia: The Royal Queensland Regiment\n\nAustralia: The Royal New South Wales Regiment\n\nPakistan: 1st Battalion (Scinde), The Frontier Force Regiment\n\nRoyal Navy: HMS Argyll\n\nLineage"
