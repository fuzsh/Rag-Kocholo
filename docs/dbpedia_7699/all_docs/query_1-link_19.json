On 17th January 1879 they were in Natal.\n\nBy August 1880 they were in Preston and on their way to their Home Barracks.\n\nOn Census night 1881 he is listed on board Serrapis in Home Port.\n\nHe landed in India 14 April 1881. This seems to some afterwards if Serrapis was in Home Port on census night. Maybe she was already on route to India ?\n\nHe spent several years with the regiment in India.\n\nDoes any one have any further information about the movements and campaigns of these Regiments during the time my Great Grand Father was serving.\n\nBest Regards, SloopJB.\n\nHi Sloop\n\nHere I have reconstructed the 2nd batt/4th Foot (later King's Own Royal Lancaster Regt) regimental movements from various sources pulled together.\n\nTime Line\n\nNov 1878 Stationed at North Camp, Aldershot\n\n1-7th Dec 1878 Received orders to proceed to Natal on active service.\n\n10th Dec 1878 6 companies embarked in transport ship Dunrobin Castle\n\n13th Dec 1878 3 companies embarked in transport ship Teuton\n\n1 15thJan 1879 Dunrobin Castle arrives Cape Town, South Africa.\n\n3 companies landed at Cape town and garrisoned at Cape Town.\n\n3 companies led by Major Elliott and Capts Knox and Leggett and 2nd Lieuts.

During this march Major Blake and Capt. Moore were surrounded by a Zulu impi (which, it is understood, was under orders to join the King), but were not attacked.\n\nThe companies of the battalion were distributed 'in reserve' over a wide area of country, including the Utrecht district, Potgreters Farm, Lüneberg, Baltes Spruit, Conference Hill, etc.\n\n28 Mar 1879 Involved in Battle of Inhlobana Hill\n\n29th Mar 1879 Some 2nd/4th casualties incurred at Kambula.\n\n3rd Jul 1879 Reconnaissance before Ulundi\n\n4th Jul 1879 Battle of Ulundi\n\nJul 1879 After the battle of Ulundi, the companies were relieved by those of the 24th Regiment of Foot and then proceeded to Lüneberg and Standerton in the Transvaal.\n\n6th Sept 1879 Colonel Bray, with three companies of the regiment, assisted by the Frontier Light Horse and a detachment of Engineers, blew up the caves known as Mbilinis, in the neighbourhood of the Ntombe River.\n\nSept 1879 Manyanyoba, the independent chief who had long given great trouble, now surrendered. He had been holed up in the Mbilini's Cave, so commonly referred to as Manyanyoba's Cave.\n\n8th Sept 1879 Some 2nd/4th casualties incurred at Luneberg\n\nSept 1879 The regiment received orders to return.\n\nSept 1879 2 companies left at Greytown with the other forces which, under Major Twentyman, were destined for the defence of the frontier.\n\nSept 1879 On the road back, the companies which had been stationed at Newcastle, Ladysmith, and Dundee rejoined the regiment passing through Pretoria and\n\nStanderton en route.\n\n26th Jan 1880 Regiment arrives at Pinetown\n\n8th Feb 1880 Battalion embark for Bombay minus the 2 companies left at Greytown.\n\nEnd Feb 1881 News of disaster at Majuba Hill\n\nXx Apr 1881 Census in England taken, some 2nd/4th on troopship Serapis\n\n1st Jul 1881 Cardwell reforms, new name assigned Kings own Royal Lancaster Regiment\n\nNov 1881 Earl Frederick Roberts arrives in Madras\n\nXxx 1881 5 India Poona (Pune) and elsewhere\n\nNB Not quite finished collating movements in India from 1881 to 1885\n\nNB Some named S Africa deaths included:\n\n2nd Battalion 4th Foot (Infantry Regiment)\n\n631 Private R.
