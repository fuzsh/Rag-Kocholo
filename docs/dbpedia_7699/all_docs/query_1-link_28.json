Both battalions spent the next 20 years in garrisons across the British Empire. In 1877, it was renamed the 21st (Royal Scots Fusiliers) Regiment of Foot.\n\n2nd Battalion fought in South Africa during the Zulu and Sekukuni Wars of 1879. Two years later, it became the county regiment for six counties in south and south-west Scotland.\n\nThe regiment wasn't merged with any other units during the 1881 reforms as it already had a second regular battalion. This period also saw 2nd Battalion fight in the Transvaal War (1880-81) and the Third Burma War (1885-87), while 1st Battalion garrisoned India, Britain and Ireland."
