        "text": "REGIMENTAL PRAYER OF THE ROYAL AUSTRALIAN REGIMENT\n\nO God, We, Who Have Served In The Royal Australian Regiment,\n\nConsecrate Ourselves To You By Giving Ourselves Body And Spirit\n\nTo Your Service And To The Service Of Our Fellow Man.\n\nCleanse From Us Everything That Could Mar This Service.\n\nGrant That We May Live Our Lives\n\nThat At All Times We Put Our Duty First.\n\nHelp Us To Think Wisely, To Speak Rightly, To Resolve Bravely,\n\nTo Act Kindly And To Live Purely.\n\nGive Us The Courage To Defend The Cause Of Justice,\n\nFreedom, Truth And The Right To Liberty.\n\nThis We Ask Through Christ Our Lord. Amen.\n\nThe formation of The Royal Australian Regiment in the years soon after the end of the Second World War was of fundamental importance to the Australian Army. Before that time Australia's peacetime army had been substantially a part-time militia, which formed the basis for a voluntary, specially enlisted force for war. The regular component was merely the permanent cadre for the larger citizen army. After 1948, however, for the first time Australia had a permanent, professional army, available in peace and war for any task the government might direct. But although The Royal Australian Regiment was the key component of the new Australian Regular Army, it was not a complete break with the past; it was built on the existing reservoir of soldiers who had seen active service in the Second World War. The Regiment might have been new, but the traditions developed in the Boer War and in two world wars continued.\n\nThe continuity of service was preserved because The Royal Australian Regiment had its genesis in three infantry battalions of the\n\n34th Australian Infantry Brigade, the\n\n65th, (became 1RAR)\n\n66th (became 2 RAR) and\n\n67th (became 3RAR) Australian Infantry Battalions, (see their colour patches, left)\n\nraised at the end of the Second World War for special service with the British Commonwealth Occupation Force (BCOF) in Japan.\n\nThese battalions had strong links with the Australian Militia and AIF volunteer traditions as they comprised volunteers from the five Australian Infantry Divisions which had engaged in operations against the Japanese Army in areas extending from the Solomon Islands in the east, through New Britain and New Guinea, to Borneo in the west, as well as earlier service for some of them, in the North Africa campaign.\n\nOn cessation of hostilities in 1945 the Australian Government made a commitment to contribute Australians to the Commonwealth Occupational Forces in Japan. The 34th Infantry Brigade was raised in Morotai, specifically for this purpose, and consisted of three Infantry Battalions, namely the 65th 66th and 67th Battalions.\n\nOn 23 November 1948 the 34th Infantry Brigade was designated as the Australian Regiment, with the Battalions becoming the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Battalions, The Australian Regiment. On 10 March 1949 Royal assent was given and the Regiment became the Royal Australian Regiment.\n\nIt was deemed undesirable to have the new Australian Regular Army (ARA) units, who would have no battle honours or Colours to be numbered higher than AIF Units.\n\nOriginally it was proposed that the three Battalions be named . . .\n\n1st Battalion, King George VI's Australian Rifle Regiment\n\n1st Battalion Princess Elizabeth's Australian Footguards and\n\n1st Battalion Princess Margaret's Australian Infantry Regiment\n\nAn alternative proposal was . . .\n\n1st Infantry Battalion, City of Sydney's Own Regiment\n\n1st Infantry Battalion, Royal Melbourne Regiment\n\n1st Infantry Battalion, The Oxley Regiment\n\nEventually it was decided to adopt the British style regimental system and the Australian Regiment was born.\n\nThe Regiment was deployed to Korea in 1950 at the outbreak of hostilities between North and South Korea, at the request of the United Nations and served there until 1956. For most of the next two decades the Regiment remained committed on active service operations in Malaya, Malaysia, Borneo and South Vietnam. In recent times the Regiment has provided elements for United Nations peace keeping operations such as Cambodia and Somalia. During service in Australia the Regiment has made a significant contribution to national disaster operations such as cyclones Althea and Tracey.\n\nThe Royal Australian Regiment has a proud history of serving Australia in both war and peace.\n\n1 RAR, from June 1965 to 1966 June - & May 1966 May 1967\n\n5 RAR replaces 1RAR:- June 1966 to June 1967\n\n6 RAR extra Battalion:- May 1966 to May 1967\n\n7 RAR replaces 5RAR:- June1967 to June 1968\n\n2 RAR replaces 6RAR:- December 1967 to November 1968\n\n3 RAR extra Battalion:- April 1968 April to February 1969\n\n1 Battalion replaces 7RAR:- June 1968 June to May 1969\n\n4 Battalion replaces 2RAR:- November 1968 to November 1969\n\n9 Battalion replaces 3RAR:- February 1969 to March 1970\n\n5 Battalion replaces 1RAR:- May 1969 to June 1970\n\n6 Battalion replaces 4RAR:- November 1969 to December 1970\n\n8 Battalion replaces 9RAR, but not replaced!
