        "text": "That's a bit disengenuous, you were the one saying a day ago that 5 and 7 RAR were hollow.\n\nBesides aren't the tanks being concentrated now? Besides, I thought there were only two tank sqns due to an insufficient number of tanks and it has been the case for well over a decade.\n\n1 battalion does not a brigade make… Arguably 2 doesn’t either, but it’s much easier to add rifle companies to an existing organisation than it is to raise an RAR battalion from scratch. Or bring an entire reserve battalion up to SERCAT 7 levels… It is however vastly cheaper to strip the Army of battalions and squadrons than it is to support a larger standing army and here we are…\n\nFor the record in addition to my earlier mention of Army’s cuts and yet another reason why Leahy has blasted this “plan” is the ‘4th’ combat brigade Army was raising in Adelaide (9th Brigade) is also gone with the 10/28th Battalion, Royal South Australian Regiment being stripped of it’s frontline kit and being consigned back to 2nd Division in a “security response“ role…\n\nAll the other choc units are going back to 8th Brigade, the Combat engineers never even got to see their armoured engineering vehicles and the local arty? Well they of course have missed out on their SP guns... What that gibberish in the “DSR” about “artillery guns not providing the range or lethality required” was actually referring to - aka the expansive cuts Army was about to receive, in the name known as a “focussed force”…\n\nAs to tanks. there are presently 3 tank squadrons in Army issued to 1 Armoured, 2 Cav and 2/14 LHR. Each of which is an ACR equipped with ASLAV and M1A1, and has been that way for that decade that you speak of. This was the result of Plan Beersheba. The tanks were moved from a consolidated structure in 1 Armoured Regt, to 3 independent squadrons in the 3 ACR’s, to give each brigade similar capability and combined arms experience to support force generation activities.\n\nThe ‘insufficient’ tanks issue was created because the squadrons were dispersed between the brigades. They needed about another 6 or so tanks per brigade to support the availability of the 14 that were supposed to be operational. In one regiment they could swap cars between squadrons as needed to generate a battlegroup. When dispersed among the brigades, they couldn’t. That is what lead to the increased number of tanks being sought for the new M1A2SEPv3 Abrams purchase. That situation will end in 2024 thanks to the current Government.\n\nThe M1A2SEPv3 will now only be issued to 2 CAV Regt in Townsville. Boxer will still go to 2/14LHR as well as 2 CAV but there is no ACR for 1 Brigade any longer, so no A vehicles of any kind in the entire 1st Brigade…\n\n1 Armoured Regt is no longer an Armoured Regiment from 2024 onwards, it is a technology and innovation trials and development unit whatever that means (less than 50 pers in the “Regiment” in total however) and will be stripped of most if not all of it’s armour.\n\nSo in short -\n\nAdelaide - loses the entire 9th Brigade and all equipment therein. “Gains“ the HIMARS Regiment it was already getting under existing planning anyway, but the current Government now takes credit for what the previous Government had already approved, and no-one seems to be questioning this for some weird reason.\n\nDarwin - 1 Brigade loses it’s entire ACR but gains part of 7RAR into a consolidated battalion previously and once again known as 5/7RAR. In equipment terms it loses Abrams, Boxer, M113, IFV, SP guns, armoured engineering vehicles and all the CSS. Gains whatever boats emerge from the littoral manoeuvre project. Darwin loses 1 Aviation Regt in it’s entirety without any replacement.\n\nBrisbane - Loses it’s tank squadron, loses M113, IFV, SP guns, armoured engineering and related CSS, but at least keeps it’s Boxers and both battalions. Gains whatever boats emerge from the littoral manoeuvre project and the HQ for 16 Brigade and some Apaches and Blackhawks at Oakey.\n\nTownsville - loses 16Avn Brigade but gains 1 Aviation Regt. Keeps it’s battalions and ACR. Gets all the tanks, but no extra squadrons or regiments to be raised to operate them. Gets all the armoured engineering but no extra squadrons or regiments to operate them. Gets all the IFV’s but only enough are approved to issue to 3RAR. 1RAR will remain Bushmaster / Light leading to what can only be described as a tremendously unbalanced Brigade. Arguably Brisbane is better balanced, although even so it will maintain far less combat capability. Also gains boats from littoral manoeuvre project. Most of the former 9th brigade ARA Cadre from Adelaide is being moved to Townsville.\n\nSo that’s the 2023 re-org in a nutshell. Every major part of Army has endured cuts. Our land combat capability has been diminished by about 2/3rds and yet we’re told our strategic situation is rapidly descending into the toilet…"
