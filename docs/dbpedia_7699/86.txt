Sydney-based rock band, The Tommy Flowers, performed in Kolina, on the remote Weather Coast of Guadalcanal. Kolina had been a stronghold of the militant Harold Keke, leader of the Guadalcanal Liberation Front, until his arrest by RAMSI forces on 13 August 2003. A police post was established at Kolina on 16 August 2003, and was defended by Australian and Pacific soldiers on two-week rotations. Members of 2RAR, part of the Ready Deployment Force, based at Townsville, were deployed to the Solomon Islands under Operation Anode, Australiaâ€™s contribution to RAMSI.
