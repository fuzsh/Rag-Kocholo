Instead, I have done something which I think is unique. I have found 618 famous names (famous to me, anyway) and have brieﬂy summarized the relationship Marilyn Monroe had with each. The arrangement is alphabetical. The range is as immense as it is unexpected— Sir Laurence Olivier to The Three Stooges, Nikita Khrushchev to Dylan Thomas, Brigitte Bardot to Eleanor Roosevelt. Of course, the Kennedys, Joe DiMaggio, and Arthur Miller are included. It has become politically correct to spell that popular golden hair color as “blond” without an “e,” even when referring to a woman. But somehow, I feel that “blonde” with an “e” is more appropriate for Marilyn Monroe and I have spelled it that way throughout. After all, who but Marilyn could get away with saying, “I like to feel blonde all over.”\n\nWho doesn’t love Marilyn Monroe? This may surprise you, but I do not. I’ll admit to carrying a torch for the early Marilyn, when she was fresh, sparkling, and almost ethereally beautiful. But when I think of the second half of her adult life—with the drinking, the pills, and the psychoanalysts—she was still beautiful but I feel angry and annoyed with her. Marilyn came to depend on pretentious pseudointellectual parasites and poseurs. Poor Marilyn. She lacked the emotional stability, the selfconﬁdence, and educational depth to distinguish the genuine from the phony. That was the source of her tragedy. I just want to shake some sense into her and warn her off those people. I am an old movie buff, and that is the genesis of this project. I started watching, rewatching and collecting Marilyn Monroe ﬁlms. The Seven Year Itch is my personal favorite. But as is my nature, I wanted more information. So I hit the libraries, made an impressive number of interlibrary loans, visited the bookstores and the second-hand bookstores wherever I went, searched the internet, put the photocopier to good use, and it just spiraled out of control. This is not a biography of Marilyn Monroe. There are literally hundreds of those and\n\nA thank you is in order for the staff at the St. John’s Public Library and the Queen Elizabeth II Library at the Memorial University of Newfoundland for tolerating my many requests for interlibrary loans. Dianne TaylorHarding gets a special thank you for her suggestions, knowledge of research sources and resolving the inevitable computer issues.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction of single motherhood too much to handle. When Norma Jeane was less than two weeks old she was boarded with a foster family, the Bolenders, for $5 per week. The Bolenders were kind to the children in their care, but they were strict and very religious. Gladys never missed a payment and visited her child when she could. Norma Jeane, however, remembered the visitor not as her mother but as “the woman with the red hair” (Spoto 1993, 20). In 1933, after seven years of this arrangement, Gladys took her daughter back as she had secured enough for a down payment on a modest bungalow near the Hollywood Bowl. Norma Jeane and her mother became regular moviegoers. At Grauman’s Chinese Theater Norma Jeane placed her feet in the concrete footprints of Gloria Swanson and Clara Bow. But the good times were all too brief. In January 1935, Gladys suffered a breakdown and was diagnosed as a paranoid schizophrenic. She was committed to a state mental hospital and, apart from brief interludes, was institutionalized for the rest of her life.2 Marilyn Monroe was thereafter to have a morbid terror of genetic insanity. An English couple, the Atkinsons, who worked as bit players in the ﬁlm industry, were renting rooms in Gladys’s house. They stayed on and looked after Norma Jeane. But eventually they returned to England. The little girl was then placed under the guardianship of Gladys’s best friend, Grace McKee, a ﬁlm librarian. Grace was a frustrated actress and transferred her ambitions to her ward. She would say, “Don’t worry, Norma Jeane. You’re going to be a beautiful girl when you get big— an important woman—a movie star” (Spoto 1993, 34). Grace was not well off and it was\n\nThe woman who continues to electrify the world as Marilyn Monroe, a half century after her death, was born Norma Jeane Mortensen at 9:30 a.m. on June 1, 1926, in the Charity Ward of the Los Angeles General Hospital. Her mother, Gladys Pearl Monroe, worked as a ﬁlm cutter at Consolidated Film Industries, a Hollywood ﬁlm processing lab. Gladys was 26 when her daughter was born and, by all accounts, she was a beautiful woman who bore a passing resemblance to silent screen star Norma Talmadge. She was also a woman suffering from deep mental and emotional disturbances. Although the birth certiﬁcate listed the baby’s father as one Martin Edward Mortensen, it also lists him as being of unknown residence. Norma Jeane never met him and he was certainly not her biological father. Mortensen, a feckless immigrant from Norway, was legally married to Gladys at the time but had hit the road prior to Gladys becoming pregnant.1 Before Mortensen, Gladys had married and divorced Jack Baker. Norma Jeane never met him either, but just to complicate matters, Gladys and her daughter often used the Baker surname. At the baptism on December 6, 1926, the baby’s name was recorded as Norma Jeane Baker. It will never be known for sure who Norma Jeane’s father was, but the most likely candidate is Charles Stanley Gifford, Gladys’s shift foreman at Consolidated Film Industries. Marilyn Monroe believed this to be the case. She made several attempts to contact Gifford, but was harshly rebuffed each time. Throughout her life, Marilyn was to feel an aching loss for never having had a father. Gladys Baker, as she was calling herself, liked the fast life and found the responsibilities 2\n\n3 necessary for Norma Jeane to be passed through a succession of foster homes. Several of the families wanted to adopt her but Gladys, who still exercised the ultimate legal authority over her daughter, refused to consider such a thing. On September 13, 1935, Norma Jeane was placed in the Los Angeles Orphans Home. She was devastated. In a 1962 interview, Marilyn said of that time, “I began to cry, ‘Please, please don’t make me go inside. I’m not an orphan, my mother’s not dead. I’m not an orphan—it’s just that she’s sick in the hospital and can’t take care of me. Please don’t make me live in an orphan’s home.’ ” (Steinem & Barris 36). Marilyn Monroe made much of her supposed Dickensian childhood—how she was given mere pennies to wash mountains of dishes in the orphanage, was molested by a foster parent and raped by a rogue policeman. Marilyn’s childhood was difﬁcult but the horror stories were probably ﬁgments of her overheated imagination and an attempt to gain sympathy from the listener. The orphanage was actually a well-run and enlightened place. Even so, it was still an institution, and Norma Jeane’s feelings of abandonment and loneliness were intensiﬁed. The Los Angeles Orphans Home was only a block away from the RKO Studio. Norma Jeane could look out her window and see the brightly lit water tower on the RKO Radio Pictures lot. She remembered that her mother had worked on RKO ﬁlms and began to dream that someday she would be a movie star herself.3 At Christmas, the children were invited to a party and a movie at the studio. The ﬁlm industry ran through every part of Marilyn Monroe’s life. Grace McKee took Norma Jeane out of the orphanage in the summer of 1937. More foster homes followed until Norma Jeane went to live with Grace’s aunt, Ana Lower. Aunt Ana was a kind woman and provided Norma Jeane with the most stable home environment she would ever know. The older woman was a devout Christian Scientist and introduced her ward to that faith. Norma Jeane was a Christian Scientist for about eight years; this\n\nIntroduction would remain her strongest religious inﬂuence. Norma Jeane started Emerson Junior High School in September 1939. Her fully developed body soon made her very popular with the boys. She attended Van Nuys High School in September 1941, but dropped out of the tenth grade. Grace McKee and her husband were moving to West Virginia and it was decided that Aunt Ana was too old and unwell to care for Norma Jeane any longer. The obvious solution was to marry the 16-year-old schoolgirl off to the handsome neighbor boy, 21-year-old James Dougherty. The alternative would have been for Norma Jeane to be sent back to the orphanage. Dougherty had a steady job at Lockheed Aviation and Norma Jeane already had a crush on him. The wedding took place on June 19, 1942, less than three weeks after Norma Jeane’s 16th birthday. Whether or not the marriage was happy depends on whom you believe. After the fact, Marilyn Monroe would claim that she was forced into a loveless marriage. Dougherty said that it was a good union based on love. In the fall of 1943, with World War II raging, Jim Dougherty joined the Merchant Marine as a physical-training instructor. He was posted to Catalina Island off the Southern California coast, and his beautiful young bride went with him. Much to her husband’s chagrin, Norma Jeane caused something of a sensation with the young men based on the island. The following year, Dougherty was posted overseas. Norma Jeane moved in with her husband’s parents and began working at the Radio Plane factory in Burbank. In the spring of 1945, Corporal David Conover, an Army photographer, came to Radio Plane to shoot some morale-boosting pictures of women doing war work. Conover spotted the stunning 18-year-old in her overalls and knew he had found the ideal model. The resulting photographs received wide distribution and Norma Jeane’s career as a cover girl was underway. She was a natural before the camera. In the summer of that year, Norma Jeane registered with the Blue Book Modeling Agency in Los Angeles. The director, Emmeline Snively, started coaching her\n\nIntroduction and she soon quit the defense plant and began getting work as a photographer’s model. On the advice of Miss Snively, Norma Jeane increased her employment prospects by changing her light brown hair to a golden honey-blonde. When Dougherty came home on leave, he realized that things had changed. His wife’s focus was no longer on him but on her career as a photo model. Norma Jeane was not the tall willowy type suited for fashion modeling. Instead, she made her mark in pinup magazines such as Cheesecake, U.S. Camera, Laff, See, and Peek. This was a traditional way to get the attention of movie producers. Norma Jeane pursued her career with a single-minded determination, appearing on 33 magazine covers in her ﬁrst six months as a professional model. When Jim Dougherty shipped out again, he received a letter from a Las Vegas attorney. Norma Jeane had established residency in Nevada and had ﬁled for divorce. She had decided to take things to the next level and become a movie actress. The ﬁlm studios did not want their starlets tied down to husbands. They invested some serious money in their girls and were not about to have a pregnancy put their investment at risk. In 1946, shortly after her 20th birthday, Norma Jeane had an interview with Ben Lyon, a former actor who was now the casting director at Twentieth Century–Fox. Lyon was impressed with Norma Jeane, thinking she resembled Jean Harlow, with whom he had worked in Hell’s Angels in 1930. A screen test was scheduled and, on the strength of it, Norma Jeane was signed to a six-month contract at $75 per week. But the name Norma Jeane Dougherty had to go. Lyon suggested “Marilyn” and Norma Jeane added “Monroe,” her mother’s family name. Lyon liked the alliteration and “Marilyn Monroe” was born.4 As a lowly contract player, Marilyn spent her days at Fox taking dancing, singing and pantomime classes, as well as posing for seemingly endless rounds of publicity photo sessions. Marilyn worked hard and began to get noticed. She landed her ﬁrst speaking role in 1947. The ﬁlm was a forgettable comedy enti-\n\n4 tled Scudda Hoo! Scudda Hay! “Hi, Rad” was all she was given to say. The rest of the scenes Marilyn ﬁlmed ended up on the cutting-room ﬂoor. One day, as she walked across the Fox lot, Marilyn caught the eye of Joseph M. Schenck. Nearly 70 years of age, Schenck was an executive producer. He had a lively interest in pretty girls (he had been married to Norma Talmadge, the actress Marilyn’s mother resembled) and invited Marilyn to a dinner party at his house. The unknown starlet immediately became a regular at Schenck’s parties. Did Marilyn become the old man’s mistress as some have alleged? Probably not, as her career did not suddenly take off. But Schenck remained Marilyn’s friend and mentor until his death in 1961. Schenck probably did help her get a small part (and 14th billing) in Dangerous Years. Shot in May 1947, it was a ﬁlm about juvenile delinquents.5 Marilyn played a waitress in a teen hangout and was given her ﬁrst close-up. But a few days after completing the picture, Fox decided not to renew her contract. In March 1948, after more pinup photos and modeling jobs, Marilyn signed a sixmonth contract, at $125 per week, with Columbia Pictures. Columbia raised Marilyn’s hairline using electrolysis and changed her hair color from ash blonde to platinum blonde. Marilyn was given second billing in Ladies of the Chorus, a low-budget musical in which she was a burlesque star who falls in love with the scion of a prominent family. She got to sing two songs in the movie. She also fell in love with Fred Karger, the ﬁlm’s musical director. Marilyn wanted to marry Karger but he didn’t think she was suitable mother material for his young children. Although he was not about to marry her, Karger introduced Marilyn to serious music and good books. He also gave her valuable voice coaching and wardrobe advice and took her to an orthodontist to have a slight overbite corrected. Columbia’s head drama coach, Natasha Lytess, was asked to help Marilyn with her acting technique. Lytess was so impressed with Marilyn’s natural talent and drive to succeed that she quit her job at Columbia and devoted herself exclusively to Mar-\n\n5 ilyn for the next seven years! Columbia was ruled with an iron hand by Harry Cohn, and despite the studio’s investment in their newest starlet, her contract was allowed to expire in September 1948. The story is that Marilyn refused Cohn’s sexual advances. After a few lean months, Marilyn landed a tiny part in a Marx Brothers comedy, Love Happy. The ﬁlm was not very good but Marilyn’s walk-on generated a lot of attention, so much so that she was sent across the country on a promotional tour. Next up for Marilyn was a small role in a musical, A Ticket to Tomahawk. Between the production of Love Happy in 1949 and its release in the spring of 1950, Marilyn posed for her famous nude calendar shots. The calendar went on to earn millions but all Marilyn got out of it was $50. Marilyn now attracted the attention of Johnny Hyde, a top Hollywood agent. Hyde, who was 53, immediately fell in love with the 22-year-old starlet and did everything he could to promote her career. Thanks to him, Marilyn was cast by John Huston in her ﬁrst “A” picture, a gritty ﬁlm noir, The Asphalt Jungle.6 Marilyn then appeared in three minor ﬁlms, Right Cross, Hometown Story and The Fireball, a roller skating epic with Mickey Rooney. Again, thanks to Hyde, Marilyn got a small but important part in her most prestigious ﬁlm to date, All About Eve. She shared scenes with the likes of Bette Davis, Anne Baxter and George Sanders. In December 1950 Marilyn was signed to a seven-year contract by Fox. She would be paid $500 per week in the ﬁrst year, gradually rising to $3,500 per week in the ﬁnal year. The contract was the last thing Hyde was able to do for her. He died of a heart attack just days after it was signed. Fox was quick to put their newest property to work in three minor comedies: As Young As You Feel, Love Nest and Let’s Make It Legal. Still reliant on Natasha Lytess, Marilyn, on loan to RKO, was coached on the set of Clash by Night, a drama based on a Clifford Odets play, directed by Fritz Lang. The story of Marilyn’s nude calendar came out at this time. The studio was nervous and wanted her to deny everything. Marilyn did the opposite.\n\nIntroduction She admitted everything, saying she had done nothing wrong. The public agreed. The public also learned that her mother was not dead (as they had been led to believe) but was in a state mental hospital. Marilyn had her mother moved to a private sanitarium. Although she only visited her mother occasionally, she took care of all the expenses. Increasingly, Marilyn yearned for what she never had, a normal family life. And she desperately wanted to be a mother. In May 1952, she had her appendix removed. As he prepared to operate, the surgeon found a handwritten note on Marilyn’s stomach. “Cut as little as possible ... no ovaries removed ... do whatever you can to prevent large scars” (Banner 177). By now Marilyn Monroe had appeared in Time and Life magazines and soldiers in the Arctic had voted her “The Girl Most Likely to Thaw Alaska” (Riese & Hitchens 28). Next for her were comedy roles in We’re Not Married, O’Henry’s Full House (opposite Charles Laughton) and Monkey Business (opposite Cary Grant and Ginger Rogers). Marilyn ﬁnally got the opportunity for a major dramatic part when she played a psychotic babysitter in Don’t Bother to Knock. But it was her next picture, Niagara, which propelled her to stardom. The tag line on the movie posters was: “Marilyn Monroe and Niagara—a raging torrent of emotion that even nature can’t control!” (Victor 214). In the summer of 1952 Marilyn began seeing the legendary baseball player Joe DiMaggio. They married in 1954 and, after a tempestuous union, they divorced less than a year later. Thereafter, DiMaggio became the person upon whom she could rely more than any other. Gentlemen Prefer Blondes was released in 1953. Even though Marilyn was now a star she was scandalously underpaid. She was under contract for $1,500 per week while co-star Jane Russell was getting between $100,000 and $200,000 for the movie. Understandably, Marilyn complained: “I am the blonde, and it is Gentlemen Prefer Blondes” (Riese & Hitchens 174). Her next movie, How to Marry a Millionaire, teamed her with Lauren Bacall and\n\nIntroduction Betty Grable. After three hits in a row, Marilyn got stuck in what she called a gradeZ western, River of No Return. There was no love lost between her and the ﬁlm’s authoritarian director, Otto Preminger. By this time, Marilyn was worrying about the quality of the ﬁlms she was given. Seeking control of her future, her reputation and a better salary, Marilyn endeavored to renegotiate her contract. Fox refused and put her on suspension. Eventually, Twentieth Century–Fox relented and Marilyn was cast in There’s No Business Like Show Business. She agreed to do the ﬁlm because she was promised The Seven Year Itch. That ﬁlm, with its famous skirt billowing scene, became the image most associated with Marilyn Monroe. At the end of 1954, Marilyn deﬁed Hollywood convention by establishing her own production company with photographer Milton Greene. Marilyn had begun a romance with playwright Arthur Miller and began attending classes at the famed Actors Studio in New York. Natasha Lytess, her devoted acting coach, was out and Lee and Paula Strasberg were in. It got to the point where Marilyn Monroe would not appear anywhere near a movie camera unless Paula Strasberg was at her side. This arrangement was none too popular with most ﬁlm directors. In 1956, Marilyn made the well-regarded drama Bus Stop. To this day there are those who feel it was an injustice that her performance was not nominated for an Academy Award. After marrying Miller, the newlyweds were off to England where Marilyn ﬁlmed The Prince and the Showgirl with Sir Laurence Olivier. The two stars clashed, and the production was a troubled one, Marilyn gave a scintillating performance. To her legion of fans all was well but by this time in her life Marilyn was overcome with self-doubt and suicidal despair. She selfmedicated with an ever-increasing intake of alcohol and pills. In November 1956, unhappy and exhausted, Marilyn ﬂew back to America. Already, there were signs that her marriage to Arthur Miller was in trouble. Marilyn took a two-year break from ﬁlming to repair her marriage and have a child. But her joy at becoming\n\n6 pregnant turned to despair. It was a tubal pregnancy and had to be terminated. In 1959, Marilyn Monroe came roaring back to the screen, appearing with Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon in one of her most famous ﬁlms, Some Like It Hot. During the ﬁlming, Marilyn became pregnant again but suffered a miscarriage. Next up for her was a mediocre musical comedy, Let’s Make Love. During its production Marilyn conducted a passionate affair with her French co-star, Yves Montand. As a last gift to his wife, Arthur Miller had written a screenplay about modern-day cowboys and the woman they all love. The Misﬁts, shot in the 100-degree heat of the Nevada desert, was a nightmare for Marilyn. Her marriage was over and her life was spinning out of control. Yet somehow, she turned in one of her greatest performances. She was having daily sessions with a psychiatrist and was washing down a bewildering pharmacopoeia of prescription drugs with booze. During her last year, Marilyn Monroe began her famous involvement with the Kennedy brothers and started work on Something’s Got to Give. The movie would never be completed. On May 19, 1962, Marilyn took an unauthorized leave of absence from the ﬁlm set to sing “Happy Birthday, Mr. President” before John F. Kennedy in Madison Square Garden. Shortly after, Marilyn was ﬁred from Something’s Got to Give. On August 5, 1962, Marilyn Monroe was found dead in her bedroom, clutching the telephone in her hand, an empty vial of sleeping pills beside her. 7 Sorry to disappoint the conspiracy enthusiasts, but there was no plot to kill her. Marilyn Monroe was not murdered. The Kennedy family did not orchestrate her passing. The CIA did not kill her, nor did the Mob nor anyone else. Marilyn Monroe killed herself. As on many other occasions, Marilyn took too many pills and ended up in a semi-comatose state. But this time she forgot and took some more pills. No one, none of her friends, her husbands or her lovers, certainly no one from the movie industry, staged an intervention. Marilyn Monroe was abandoned to her fate, a true Hollywood tragedy.\n\nChronology Late 1934—Early 1935—Norma Jeane lives with the Giffens, a foster family.\n\n1926 June 1—Norma Jeane Mortensen is born to Gladys Pearl Baker (née Monroe) and an unknown father, in Los Angeles General Hospital.

She also appeared in a photograph in a Gene Autry western, Riders of the Whistling Pines (1949).\n\n13\n\nThis page intentionally left blank\n\nThe Dictionary -A-\n\nmonth-long engagement at the Persian Room in the Plaza Hotel in New York in March 1956 and that led to television appearances on The Ed Sullivan Show. As she recalled, “Ed Sullivan came to the Plaza and saw me and asked me to do Marilyn on his Sunday–night show. It was on the Sullivan show that it became really big. It brought so much mail I had to repeat it two weeks later.” At the time, Al Capp’s popular cartoon strip, Li’l Abner, was being turned into a Broadway musical. The producers wanted Marilyn for the lead role of Daisy Mae but she was not interested. Adams thought: “If they want Marilyn, maybe they’ll take a ﬁrst-string Monroe imitator.” She told the producers to watch her on the Sullivan show. They did and Adams got the part, for which she earned a Tony Award (Ricco 191– 3). Adams was ten months younger than Marilyn and survived her by 46 years. Marilyn came to believe that the movie star called Marilyn Monroe was just an act she was obliged to perform. She said, “All my life I’ve played Marilyn Monroe, Marilyn Monroe, Marilyn Monroe. I’ve tried to do a little better and ﬁnd myself doing an imitation of Edie Adams doing an imitation of me. I try to do a little better, but then I do an exaggeration of myself doing the same thing. I want to do something different” (Schwarz 530).\n\nCASEY ADAMS (a.k.a.: Max Showalter) Actor and friend who appeared with Marilyn Monroe in Niagara (1953) and Bus Stop (1956). He was to experience ﬁrsthand Marilyn’s casual attitude toward nudity. In Niagara Adams played a nerdy honeymooner. Adams remembered how, during a break in the location shooting, Marilyn appeared nude at her hotel window in Niagara Falls, Ontario, and was genuinely surprised by the commotion she was causing in the street below. Adams had to tell Marilyn that maybe it was because “you haven’t got a stitch of clothing on” (Schwarz 357). Adams and Marilyn had adjoining rooms at the General Brock Hotel. Marilyn insisted that the connecting door between the rooms be kept unlocked to form a suite. You can imagine Adams’s surprise when, on the night before the ﬁrst day of ﬁlming, a nude Marilyn Monroe came into his room and crawled into bed with him. She said: “Don’t do anything but just hold me” (Victor 6). No sex was involved. Marilyn was frightened about what the next day would bring and wanted Adams to help her practice her lines.\n\nEDIE ADAMS Comedienne, Broadway, ﬁlm and television actress who was married to the zany and innovative comedian Ernie Kovacs. At private parties, Adams occasionally did hilarious impressions of MM1 improbably singing 19th century German lieder. Soon, complete with heavy red lipstick, a blonde wig and fur stole, Adams was appearing on The Jack Paar Show2 and her husband’s television program, The Ernie Kovacs Show. Adams added more Marilyn impressions to her act and depicted her breathlessly reciting Shakespeare. Adams did her MM impersonation during a\n\nFRED ALLEN Tired-looking radio comedian and wit, who made an occasional ﬁlm. In 1952, Allen made his last two movies, We’re Not Married and O. Henry’s Full House. In both of these Allen co-starred with MM but did not share screen time with her. Allen died on March 17, 1956 while Marilyn was working on Bus Stop (Victor 224, 322; www.imdb.com). STEVE ALLEN Comedian, musician, and songwriter who pioneered the talk show format 15\n\nAllyson on television. Allen wrote 54 books3, nearly eight thousand songs and originated the phrase, “Is it bigger than a breadbox?” He also acted in a few movies, among them was MM’s unﬁnished Something’s Got to Give, in which Allen was cast as a psychiatrist. On March 5, 1962, Marilyn received the Golden Globe “World Film Favorite of 1961” award. Allen was on hand as master of ceremonies. On August 5 of that year, just hours after Marilyn was found dead in bed from an overdose of barbiturates, there was a black-tie gala at the Ambassador Hotel4 in honor of Nat King Cole. Steve Allen was again the master of ceremonies, and Marilyn’s passing was on everyone’s mind. Allen delicately raised the subject when he said that, with regard to Cole, they had not waited too long to demonstrate their affection (Epstein 1999, 323–5; Schwarz 575; www.imdb.com; www.cursumperﬁcio.net /ﬁles/ awards).\n\nJUNE ALLYSON\n\nFilm and television actress, most popular in the 1940s and 1950s. Allyson’s wholesome girl-next-door screen image was the mirror opposite of MM’s overt sexuality. In 1950, Allyson was one of the stars of Right Cross, an MGM picture which featured starlet MM in an uncredited part opposite Allyson’s real-life husband, Dick Powell. Marilyn played a bar girl named Dusky Ledoux and had fewer than 20 words in the ﬁlm. In her autobiography, Allyson recalled how she and her husband “reminisced about Marilyn Monroe and how we’d been ﬂoored, both of us, the day that Marilyn, then a young starlet, an unknown, had arrived, wiggling, on the Right Cross set, and how neither of us had predicted she’d be a star” (Allyson 217). Allyson was nearly nine years Marilyn Monroe’s senior, but outlived her by 44 years (Riese & Hitchens 11; www.imdb.com).\n\nHOLLIS ALPERT Film critic and writer. In 1959, Marilyn’s publicist, Joe Wohlander5, and Alpert assisted her in nothing so ordinary as moving a big television set from her New York apartment to her home in Roxbury, Connecticut. The TV was too large for their car and other arrangements had to be made to\n\n16 move it (Morgan 218–19). It was surprising that Marilyn and Alpert were on such good terms considering what he said about Gentlemen Prefer Blondes (1953): “It is an empty and graceless remake of a fair-to-middling Broadway musical that only comes alive when Marilyn Monroe and her partner, Jane Russell, stop talking and start wiggling” (Saturday Review, v. 36 #2, 27).\n\nHARDY AMIES British fashion designer and dressmaker for Queen Elizabeth II. Amies and MM were introduced on July 26, 1956, at the playwright Terence Rattigan’s house in Berkshire, near London. The event, an aftertheater supper dance, hosted by Rattigan, Sir Laurence Olivier and Vivien Leigh in honor of Marilyn and her husband, Arthur Miller, was the social event of the season. Marilyn was in England to ﬁlm Rattigan’s The Prince and the Showgirl with Olivier. Amies was knighted in 1989, 27 years after Marilyn’s death (Gottfried 2003, 301). EDDIE ANDERSON see ROCHESTER KEITH ANDES\n\nHandsome actor who played MM’s love interest in the gritty melodrama Clash by Night (1952). Andes was six years older than Marilyn and survived her by 43 years. “Here was a pinup cutie everyone was getting nuts about,” recalled Andes. “The studio had a box-ofﬁce back-up because men wanted to see Marilyn’s tits and her ass, and the women would go to get annoyed with seeing what they haven’t got” (Gilmore 139). Clash by Night was released just as the sensational story of Marilyn’s nude calendar emerged. On location in Monterey, California, Marilyn and Andes discussed the situation. Because of what she had done, Marilyn was worried that the studio would have the weapon they needed to exercise total control over her. Andes suggested that visits to her lawyer and her agent were in order. He thought Marilyn was talking crazily when she threatened to run away and hide. The studio had spies everywhere and would eventually track her down. Marilyn reasoned that it would not be worth the studio’s time to sue her. Because of her\n\nArthur\n\n17 ironclad contract, she had no money. What were they going to do, she joked, shoot her? “‘Marilyn for Christ’s sake, what are you talking about?’ ” recalled Andes. “She just clammed up at that, wouldn’t say any more. But she was right, this fuzzy, blonde bunny that had all these conﬂicts going on. She called it right because the studio tried to shoot her legally—to punish her. She outfoxed them, though, and each subsequent time she outfoxed them she became more important to the industry. No one was going to argue with the grosses tallying up because of Marilyn, and she knew it. She had it in her mind, which incidentally wasn’t any empty-headedness by a long shot, that she was going to get their butts over the barrel for a change. ‘Ring their gongs,’ is what she said” (Gilmore 140–41).\n\nDANA ANDREWS Dependable leading man of the 1940s and 1950s. On October 29, 1956, Dana Andrews and MM crossed paths in London. It was the occasion of the Royal Command Film Performance for The Battle of the River Plate, a British ﬁlm set in World War II. Marilyn and Andrews, among a host of other celebrities, were formally presented to Queen Elizabeth II (Riese & Hitchens 456; www.imdb.com). ANN-MARGRET Award-winning actress, singer and dancer. Ann-Margret and MM never met, but on one occasion they came very close. Ann-Margret was part of a singing group appearing in Reno, Nevada, when she visited the set of The Misﬁts (1961), which was destined to be Marilyn’s last completed ﬁlm. It seems that Marilyn noticed the pretty young blonde but did not speak with her. Years later, Ann-Margret declined the “Marilyn” role in Arthur Miller’s After the Fall. At various times Ann-Margret used Marilyn’s stand-in and two of her hairstylists. In a magazine article AnnMargret said of Marilyn: “She was a very healthy girl when she came on the scene, physically and mentally. Years went by, people picked on her. She was terribly abused, for no reason. She became sick—and posthumously they gave her acclaim” (Life 8/71). In the 1975 ﬁlm Tommy, based on The Who’s rock opera,\n\nAnn-Margret takes her mute son to a chapel to be cured by the image of Marilyn Monroe. In 2001, Ann-Margret was in Blonde, a television mini-series about MM. She played Marilyn’s grandmother, Della Monroe (Riese & Hitchens 14 –15; Victor 14; www.imdb.com).\n\nEVE ARDEN\n\nWisecracking comic actress, who achieved her greatest success in television with Our Miss Brooks (1952–1956) and in the movies, Mildred Pierce (1945) and Grease (1978). Arden’s ﬁlm and television career lasted from 1929 to 1987. In 1952, Eve Arden was one of the co-stars of the Fox ﬁlm We’re Not Married. MM was also in the cast as a beauty pageant contestant who cannot compete in the Mrs. America pageant because her marriage is not technically valid (Riese & Hitchens 17; www.imdb.com).\n\nHAROLD ARLEN Award-winning composer of popular music. In September 1955, in order to dampen press interest in her relationship with Arthur Miller, Marilyn made a point of being seen with Arlen, even though he was married and 21 years her senior, at the El Morocco, a chic Manhattan nightclub frequented by socialites, entertainers and politicians (Morgan 153). One evening, when they were dancing together, Arlen said to Marilyn, “People are staring at us.” With a straight face she replied, “They must know who you are” ( Jablonski 262). DESI ARNAZ Cuban bandleader and actor who founded the Desilu Studio and starred as Ricky Ricardo opposite his wife, Lucille Ball, in television’s I Love Lucy (1951–1955). MM was enough of a fan of I Love Lucy that on one occasion she was in the studio audience. For a few months, in 1954, Marilyn leased a house on North Palm Drive6 in Beverly Hills, around the corner from Desi and Lucy. On the November 8, 1954, episode of I Love Lucy entitled, “Ricky’s Movie Offer,” Ball impersonated Marilyn (Brady 205; Riese & Hitchens 36; Shevey 260; www.youns.com/lucy).\n\nBEA ARTHUR Comic-actress best known for her television-sitcom roles in the 1970s Maude and the 1980s The Golden Girls. In 1955\n\nAshcroft and 1956, Arthur attended acting classes at the Actors Studio in New York. Marilyn Monroe was among her classmates (Adams 254).\n\nPEGGY ASHCROFT Distinguished British stage and ﬁlm actress. Ashcroft met MM on July 26, 1956, the same year she was appointed Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire. The place was playwright Terence Rattigan’s country house, near London. The occasion was a ball hosted by Rattigan, Sir Laurence Olivier and his wife, Vivien Leigh, in honor of Marilyn and her husband, Arthur Miller. Marilyn was in England to ﬁlm Rattigan’s The Prince and the Showgirl with Olivier (Gottfried 2003, 300). GENE AUTRY Actor known as “The Singing Cowboy.” Gene Autry made some 93 movies, 635 recordings, and starred in several television series. In 1948, MM was an unknown contract player at Columbia Pictures. She made a grade–B musical, Ladies of the Chorus, and then her six-month contract was allowed to lapse. The next year, however, Marilyn made another little-known appearance in a Columbia movie. She can be seen in a photograph in a Gene Autry western, Riders of the Whistling Pines (1949). Autry, of course, serenades the pretty girl in the photo7 (Riese & Hitchens 445; Victor 47; www.imdb.com). RICHARD AVEDON Acclaimed American fashion and ﬁne art photographer. For the December 22, 1958, issue of Life magazine, MM had a delightful time posing before Avedon’s camera. The images are extraordinarily accurate impersonations by Marilyn of Lillian Russell (a statuesque singer and entertainer from the turn of the 20th century), Clara Bow (the “It” girl of the 1920s), Theda Bara (the “Vamp” of the silent screen), Marlene Dietrich (glamorous German-American actress), and Jean Harlow (blonde bombshell of the 1930s.) Marilyn’s husband, Arthur Miller, contributed a two-page article and observed that the photographs were “a kind of history of our mass fantasy, so far as seductresses are concerned.” Avedon said of Marilyn: “She gave more to the still camera than any actress—any woman—I’ve ever photographed” (Riese &\n\n18 Hitchens 27). “She understood photography, and she understood what makes a great photograph—not the technique, but the content ... she was more comfortable in front of a camera than away from it ... she was completely creative ... she was very, very involved with the meaning of what she was doing, in an effort to make it more, to get the most out of it” (McCann 76). Of her notorious tardiness, Avedon said, “If she was scheduled for a sitting at 9:00 A.M., I simply put her down in my book for 7:00 P.M.—and went ahead planning the rest of my day” (Riese & Hitchens 262). Marilyn spoke nostalgically of her photo sessions with Avedon to French actress, Simone Signoret, who wrote: Listening to her you’d believe the only satisfaction as an actress she had ever felt was during these disguises, when she suddenly turned into Marlene, Garbo, and Harlow. She talked about these photography sessions the way other actors talk about their ﬁlms. She seemed to have no other happy professional memories. None of those moments of uproarious giggles among pals, none of those practical jokes, none of those noisy hugs and kisses after a scene when everyone knows all have acted well together. All these things were unknown to her. I couldn’t get over it [Signoret 291–2].\n\nOther sources: Churchwell 50 –1; Summers 237\n\nGEORGE AXELROD Playwright and screenwriter who contributed greatly to two of Marilyn Monroe’s best ﬁlms. Twentieth Century–Fox purchased the rights to Axelrod’s stage play, The Seven Year Itch, for $500,000 and Axelrod and director Billy Wilder wrote a memorable screen adaptation. Axelrod adapted William Inge’s Bus Stop for the screen himself. Axelrod also wrote Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter? (1957). In a satirical story, believed by many to be based on Marilyn’s life, Jayne Mansﬁeld played blonde sex goddess Rita Marlowe, who tries to form her own production company. The character was described as a dumb blonde whose blonde curls and shapely rear end had made her the favorite of movie audiences everywhere. Marilyn evidently thought the play was about her, too, and was\n\n19 not amused. After seeing the show on its opening night, her only comment to Axelrod was a terse, “I saw your play.” Axelrod went on to adapt Breakfast at Tiffany’s (1961), reportedly with Marilyn in mind for the lead, and to write Goodbye Charlie (ﬁlmed in 1964), which Marilyn refused to consider. Axelrod had seen about 20 actresses portray the unnamed girl in The Seven Year Itch. He had seen the girl as a redhead, a blonde and a brunette and heard her deliver her lines with a British accent and in Italian, German and French. But Marilyn was the one who came closest to the girl he had imagined when he wrote the play. “Marilyn Monroe doesn’t just play the Girl,” said Axelrod. “She is the Girl. Marilyn once told me that playing the part had helped her ﬁnd out who she was. Which is a pretty nice thing for a writer to hear from an actress” (Shaw & Rosten 52). He went on to say, I am revealing no breathtaking secret when I say that Marilyn had a reputation for not being the easiest actress in the world to work with. Her eagerness and ambition cause her to tense up. She has difﬁculty remembering lines. She has been known to drive directors stark, raving mad. However, an interesting thing happened during the shooting of Itch. My favorite scene in the picture comes close to the end. It is a kind of serious and extremely difﬁcult scene in which the Girl explains to the hero (who, to all outward appearances, is the least dashing, least glamorous, least romantic man alive) why she ﬁnds him exciting and attractive and why his wife has every reason to be jealous. Because of its difﬁculty and the fact that it ends with a long speech from the Girl, it was generally assumed that the scene would need several days to get on ﬁlm. Billy Wilder patiently struggled through dozens of takes for every scene except this one. Three minutes later it was all over. Marilyn had done it, letter perfect and with an emotional impact that caused the entire soundstage to burst into applause at the end, on the ﬁrst take. There was no need for a second. She told me later she was able to do the scene because she believed every word of what she was saying and because it seemed to her like the story of her own life [Shaw & Rosten 52–4].\n\n-BLAUREN BACALL A former model and the beautiful ﬁlm and stage actress who\n\nBackus married the much older Humphrey Bogart. Bacall co-starred with MM and Betty Grable in How to Marry a Millionaire (1953). Bacall had met Marilyn before ﬁlming and liked her. But Bacall was never close to Marilyn and was often exasperated by her unprofessional behavior. It was apparent to Bacall that Marilyn was full of fears and insecurities and only trusted her acting coach, Natasha Lytess. If Lytess shook her head, Marilyn would insist on another take no matter what director Jean Negulesco thought. Bacall found it frustrating to do 15 takes or more and be at her best in each one, knowing that Marilyn’s best take would be the one used. Marilyn was said to have rehearsed her scene with her coach before she came to the set and did not react to the other actors. In her autobiography Bacall wrote, [Betty] Grable and I decided we’d try to make it easier for [Marilyn], make her feel she could trust us. I think she ﬁnally did. I had only a few conversations with her. She came into my dressing room one day and said that what she really wanted was to be in San Francisco with Joe DiMaggio in some spaghetti joint. They were not married then. She wanted to know about my children, my home life—was I happy? She seemed envious of that aspect of my life—wistful— hoping to have it herself one day. One day Steve [Bacall’s son] came on the set and was doing somersaults on a mattress. She sat on a stool watching him and said, “How old are you.” He said, “I’m four.” She: “But you’re so big for four. I would have thought you were two or three.” He wasn’t, and was confused (so was I, so was she), but kept turning his somersaults. There was something sad about her—wanting to reach out—afraid to trust—uncomfortable. She made no effort for others and yet she was nice. I think she did trust me and liked me as well as she could anyone whose life must have seemed to her so secure, so solved [Bacall 208].\n\nOther sources: Schwarz 385–7; Shevey 235– 7; Victor 24\n\nJIM BACKUS Actor who supplied the voice of cartoon character Mr. Magoo, and embodied Thurston Howell III on Gilligan’s Island (1964 –1966). Backus was also a serious ﬁlm actor and, in 1952, was in the cast of Don’t Bother to Knock with MM (www.imdb.com).\n\nBaker\n\nCARROLL BAKER Blonde sex symbol of the 1950s and 1960s. Baker had met MM in the Actors Studio in New York and admitted to having been jealous and insecure in her presence. Baker wrote of their ﬁrst meeting: “I was already hating her for ﬂaunting her availability at Jack [Baker’s husband] when she turned to say hello to me—and presented me with that same seductive quality of ‘come on’! I suddenly felt drawn to her and leaned in a bit closer than necessary to accept her outstretched hand. Her hand was lusciously warm and plump, and I found myself clinging to it that added moment. Maybe I imagined it, but I thought I smelled the fruity aroma of sex” (Baker 146). Baker’s most famous role was in Baby Doll (1956), a part Marilyn wanted for herself. After the ﬁlm was made, Marilyn held no grudge. She was generous in her compliments to Baker and the relationship between the two actresses warmed. The Baby Doll premiere was a beneﬁt for the Actors Studio. Marilyn agreed to act as an usherette and pose for a publicity shot holding a huge photograph, in the form of a ticket, of Baker from the movie (Baker 175; Riese & Hitchens 32; Victor 24). LUCILLE BALL\n\nOn May 13, 1953, MM and Lucille Ball were seen at columnist Walter Winchell’s 56th birthday party. In October that year their paths crossed at a beneﬁt for the Damon Runyon Cancer Research Foundation. Broadcast on November 8, 1954, Ball impersonated Marilyn in an episode of I Love Lucy entitled “Ricky’s Movie Offer.”8 When a Hollywood talent scout offers to audition her husband, Ricky, Lucy decides that she wants an audition, too. Noticing that the script calls for a “Marilyn Monroe type,” Lucy dons a blonde wig, slinky red dress and an oversize beauty mark. Marilyn was enough of a fan of I Love Lucy that on one occasion she was in the studio audience. For a time, Marilyn leased a house on North Palm Drive in Beverly Hills, around the corner from Lucille Ball and her husband, Desi Arnaz (Brady 205; Riese & Hitchens 36; Shevey 260; www.cursumperﬁcio.net / biography/1953; www.youns.com/lucy).\n\n20\n\nANNE BANCROFT\n\nDistinguished Hollywood character actress who made her ﬁlm debut in one of MM’s ﬁrst big pictures, 1952’s Don’t Bother to Knock. The director, Roy (Ward) Baker, came to the realization that Bancroft and Monroe were opposites. Bancroft was a technically proﬁcient actress at 19 while Marilyn, a few years older, was completely instinctual (Shevey 195). Bancroft recalled what it was like to be in Marilyn’s presence. It was a remarkable experience! Because it was one of those very rare times, in all my experiences in Hollywood, when I felt that give-and-take that can only happen when you are working with good actors.... I was just somebody in the lobby and I was to walk over to her and react, that’s all; and there was to be a closeup of her and a closeup of me—you know, to show my reaction. Well, I moved towards her and I saw that girl—of course, she wasn’t the big sex symbol she later became, and she wasn’t famous, so there was nothing I had to forget or shake off. There was just the scene of one woman seeing another woman who was helpless and in pain, and she was helpless and in pain. It was so real, I responded. I really reacted to her. She moved me so that tears came into my eyes. Believe me, such moments happened rarely, if ever again, in the early things I was doing out there [Guiles 201–2].\n\nTALLULAH BANKHEAD\n\nHard-living, gravel-voiced star of stage and screen. In early August 1962, Bankhead inadvertently caused her wardrobe mistress to faint and fall to the ﬂoor after she had blurted out the news that MM had committed suicide. The wardrobe mistress had been with Marilyn for a year and a half as her personal assistant and felt close to her. Bankhead apologized for days afterward (Brian 246).\n\nIAN BANNEN Scottish character actor and leading man who had an extensive stage career and made 104 ﬁlms between 1955 and 1999. On October 12, 1956, Marilyn Monroe was in the audience for the London premiere of Arthur Miller’s A View From the Bridge at the Comedy Theatre. After the performance, Bannen, who was in the cast, was photographed with Marilyn (www.imdb.com; www.cursumperﬁcio.net /biography/1956).\n\nTHEDA BARA Notorious vixen of the silent screen who was known as “The Vamp,”\n\nBaxter\n\n21 the title of her 1915 Fox feature. For the December 22, 1958, issue of Life magazine, MM posed as Theda Bara. Marilyn, in a black wig and scanty harem costume, convincingly cavorted on a tiger skin rug, before Richard Avedon’s camera. Marilyn’s husband, Arthur Miller, contributed an essay to go with the photoshoot9 (Churchwell 50).\n\nBRIGITTE BARDOT\n\nSex kitten actress who was often thought of as France’s answer to MM. Bardot’s breakthrough ﬁlm was “And God Created Woman (1956), which was seen by its director, Roger Vadim, as an homage to Marilyn. On October 29, 1956, MM and BB were in the same room when they were presented to Queen Elizabeth II at a royal command ﬁlm performance in London. The newspapers tried to stir up a “battle of the sex symbols,” but neither woman would cooperate. Bardot saw Marilyn as delicate, beautiful and charming. Marilyn was somewhat concerned that the French actress had upstaged her but she need not have worried: Marilyn got most of the press coverage. Bardot and Marilyn were considered for the title role in Cleopatra (1963) but lost out to Elizabeth Taylor. Bardot was also mentioned as a possible replacement for Marilyn when she left the unﬁnished Something’s Got to Give in 1962. Five years later, Paramount considered Bardot for After the Fall, a proposal to ﬁlm Arthur Miller’s play based on the life of his late wife. (Brown 89, 194; Riese & Hitchens 37; Victor 27, 29; www. imdb.com).\n\nJOHN BARRYMORE\n\nFilm and stage actor who died when MM was only 15. Barrymore was considered the greatest actor of his generation. As far as Marilyn was concerned, John Barrymore was the perfect actor. She read Gene Fowler’s biography of Barrymore, Good Night Sweet Prince (1944), three times and made a point of seeing Barrymore’s old ﬁlms whenever she could. In the summer of 1948, Marilyn and a friend toured John Barrymore’s 55–room mansion. Initially, Marilyn was awed by the memory of all the famous people who had stood where she was standing but by the end of her visit she found the empty house op-\n\npressive and was glad to leave (Slatzer 100 – 6).\n\nLIONEL BARRYMORE\n\nCharacter actor of stage, radio and ﬁlm who was the elder brother of Ethel and John. Lionel Barrymore was in ﬁlms from 1908 and made seven movies in 1926, the year MM was born. Right Cross, made in 1950, was one of Barrymore’s last screen appearances. Playing Dusky Ladoux, in an uncredited role, was a young Marilyn Monroe (Riese & Hitchens 40; www.imdb.com).\n\nRICHARD BASEHART\n\nActor best remembered for his starring role in the 1960s television series, Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea. On February 8, 1952, Basehart was seated beside Marilyn Monroe at a banquet table when she received the Henrietta Award for “Best Young Box Ofﬁce Personality” (www.imdb. com; www.cursumperﬁcio.net/ﬁles/awards).\n\nBARBARA BATES Fresh-faced actress who played the scheming Phoebe in All About Eve (1950), in which MM was Miss Caswell. Bates, who was also in 1951’s Let’s Make It Legal, was an almost exact contemporary of Marilyn, and her life followed a similar tragic path. Ten months older, Bates committed suicide in 1969, about 7 years after Marilyn’s death (www.imdb.com ). ANNE BAXTER\n\nHollywood leading lady in ﬁlms of the 1940s and 1950s. Baxter was in three early ﬁlms of MM’s, A Ticket to Tomahawk (1950), All About Eve (1950) and “The Last Leaf ” segment of O’Henry’s Full House (1952). For her role in All About Eve, in which Marilyn was a supporting player, Baxter was nominated for the Best Actress Oscar. Baxter was supposed to have been in Niagara (1953) but dropped out, possibly because it became apparent that Marilyn would be the real star of the picture. In 1971, Baxter took over for Lauren Bacall in Applause, the stage musical version of All About Eve. Baxter’s maternal grandfather was architect Frank Lloyd Wright, with whom Marilyn and her husband, Arthur Miller, discussed having a house designed (Riese & Hitchens 41; Schwarz 355; Victor 29; www.imdb.com).\n\nBeaton\n\nCECIL BEATON British costume designer, fashion and celebrity photographer. On February 22, 1956, MM posed for a set of still photographs at the Ambassador Hotel in New York. One of the photos was of Marilyn reclining on a bed of white sheets, while clutching a long-stemmed rose. The photo became one of Marilyn’s personal favorites. She hung it on the wall of her New York apartment.10 Beaton wrote of his subject: “The tornado visit of Marilyn Monroe was the greatest fun. Although one-and-a-half hours late, Marilyn was instantly forgiven for her disarming, childlike freshness, her ingenuity and irresistible mischievousness” (Vickers 300). Elsewhere, Beaton said: “She romps, she squeals with delight, she leaps on to the sofa. She puts a ﬂower stem in her mouth, pufﬁng on a daisy as though it were a cigarette. It is an artless, impromptu, high-spirited, infectiously gay performance. It will probably end in tears” (Buckle 393). WARREN BEATTY\n\nActor, producer, director who had a well-earned reputation as a playboy. A day or two before MM died, Beatty encountered her at a party at Peter Lawford’s lavish beach house in Santa Monica. Beatty remembered Marilyn saying to herself, “Thirty-six, thirty-six. It’s all over” (Amburn 113). In 1990, Beatty told a journalist that he had played cards with Marilyn the night before her death (Finstad 2006, 315).\n\nHUGH BEAUMONT Beaumont played Ward Cleaver, the archetypal 1950s dad, in television’s Leave It to Beaver (1957–1962). He was also a ﬁlm actor. In 1951, Beaumont had a small part in one of MM’s least-known ﬁlms, Hometown Story (www.imdb.com).\n\nBRENDAN BEHAN\n\nHard-drinking and riotous-living Irish playwright. During a visit to New York in 1960, Behan indicated that what he most wanted to see was “Marilyn Monroe, back and front” (O’Sullivan 131). Behan got his wish when he was introduced to Marilyn during the run of his play, The Hostage.11 Later he sent her a polite tribute: “For Marilyn Monroe—a credit to the human\n\n22 race, mankind in general and womankind in particular” (Meyers 107).\n\nHARRY BELAFONTE Singer, actor and social activist known as “the King of Calypso.” Belafonte was on the May 19, 1962 program with Marilyn Monroe the night she warbled “Happy Birthday, Mr. President” before John F. Kennedy and an audience of 17,000 in Madison Square Garden. Belafonte also attended the after-gala party along with Kennedy and Marilyn. (Leaming 1998, 408; www.cursumperﬁcio.net /ﬁles/John F. Kennedy). SAUL BELLOW Canadian–born American novelist who won the Pulitzer Prize, the National Book Award, and the Nobel Prize for Literature. Bellow was temporarily encamped in an isolated cabin, 40 miles from Reno, Nevada, fulﬁlling the residency requirements for a divorce when he got a letter from his friend Arthur Miller, who was coming to town on the same mission. Miller wrote: “From time to time there will be a visitor who is very dear to me, but who is unfortunately recognizable by approximately a hundred million people, give or take three or four. She has all sorts of wigs, can affect a limp, sunglasses, bulky coats, etc., but if it is possible I want to ﬁnd a place, perhaps a bungalow or something like, where there are not likely to be crowds looking in through the windows. Do you know of any such place?” The visitor was, of course, MM. Miller and Bellow had to remain in Nevada for 42 consecutive days in order to obtain their divorces (Atlas 232). Bellow had dinner with Marilyn in Chicago when she was in that city for the premiere of Some Like It Hot in 1959. Bellow could not help but notice that Marilyn was surrounded by an entourage, complete with manicurist and bodyguard. The latter even left the door open when he used the bathroom. “He’s not supposed to let me out of his sight,” said Marilyn, as she signed the restaurant’s guest book, “Proud to be the guest of the Chicago writer Saul Bellow.” In a letter, Bellow wrote of Marilyn that she “seemed genuinely glad to see a familiar face. I have yet to see anything in Marilyn that isn’t genuine. Surrounded by\n\nBerle\n\n23 thousands she conducts herself like a philosopher” (Atlas 277). Many years later Bellow said of Marilyn, “I always felt she had picked up some hightension cable and couldn’t release it. She couldn’t rest, she found no repose in anything. She was up in the night, taking pills and talking about her costumes, her next picture, contracts and money, gossip. In the case of a beautiful and sensitive creature like that, it was a guarantee of destruction” (Cronin & Siegal 130–1).\n\nCONSTANCE BENNETT Glamorous movie star of the 1930s and 1940s. Her penultimate ﬁlm was As Young as You Feel in 1951. Marilyn was cast in the ﬁlm as a dimwitted secretary. After seeing Marilyn walk across the set, Bennett summed her up in one sentence: “There’s a broad with a future behind her” (Kellow 146). JOAN BENNETT Hollywood ﬁlm and television actress. When Marilyn Monroe was a child and still known as Norma Jeane Baker, one of her foster parents showed her a fan magazine with Joan Bennett’s picture on the cover. Her guardian concluded that Norma Jeane bore a strong resemblance to the actress, especially around the eyes and the top half of the face. Bennett was born 16 years before the girl who grew up to be MM and survived her by 28 years. Norma Jeane did not think she looked like Joan Bennett but found the comparison to be interesting; supposedly it led to her thinking about acting in the movies (Gilmore 49–50; Taraborrelli 2009, 49).\n\nJACK BENNY\n\nLegendary comedian in radio, ﬁlm and television. The master of the slow burn, Benny’s other trademarks were his cheapness, his terrible violin playing and his eternally claiming to be 39. MM made her television debut on his show on September 13, 1953, in a sketch entitled “The Honolulu Trip.”12 Benny wrote: “She was so charming. She said she didn’t want money, but she would love to have a car, a really nice car.13 ‘Nobody has ever given me an automobile in my life,’ she said, in that wistful little girl voice, so of\n\ncourse I was delighted to play a fatherly role and gave her a car. It was a black Cadillac convertible. She loved it and drove it until she married Arthur Miller.... She was delicious. She was superb. She read comedy lines as well as anyone in the business. She knew the secret—that hard-to-learn secret—of reading comedy lines as if they were in a drama and letting the humor speak for itself ” (Benny & Benny 242–3). Benny became friendly with Marilyn and used to accompany her to a massage parlor for facials. On one memorable occasion, the result of a dare, he accompanied her to a nude beach. Benny wore a beard and Marilyn a black wig. They were unrecognized. Marilyn and Benny were seen in public together at a couple of charity events and at the May 1962 celebration of President Kennedy’s birthday at Madison Square Garden (Riese & Hitchens 43; Summers 305–6; Victor 33; www.cursumperﬁcio.net /ﬁles/Benny).\n\nEDGAR BERGEN Actor and ventriloquist. On October 18, 1952, MM was a guest on Edgar Bergen’s radio show. Marilyn announced over the air that she was engaged to be married to Bergen’s wooden dummy, Charlie McCarthy. According to the script even Winston Churchill was upset by the announcement saying, “Never has anyone so little taken so much from so many” (Victor 33). MILTON BERLE\n\nComedian known as “Uncle Miltie” who achieved his greatest success in the early days of television. In his autobiography, Berle admitted that he had an affair with MM during the making of one of her early ﬁlms, Ladies of the Chorus (1948). He was dating the star of the ﬁlm, Adele Jergens, but quickly transferred his affections to another blonde, Marilyn. As Berle recounts about their initial meeting: “She actually blushed when we shook hands. It added to that special wideeyed quality she already had. We talked for a few minutes, and I asked her if she would have dinner with me. She said yes.” Berle and Marilyn began going out together to ﬂashy nightspots. Berle enjoyed showing them to her and thought Marilyn’s innocent curiosity was completely genuine. “Marilyn didn’t put on\n\nBerlin phoney airs. She didn’t pretend that she was used to this world. She’d just sit at the table, wide-eyed, looking everywhere. And she’d ask question after question, and she’d almost always follow it with ‘Oh, I didn’t know that!’ or ‘Oh, really?’ ...Marilyn was on the climb in Hollywood, but there was nothing cheap about her. She wasn’t one of the starlets around town that you put one meal into and then threw in the sack. Maybe she didn’t know exactly who she was, but she knew she was worth something. She had respect for herself. Marilyn was a lady.” After their affair ended Berle encountered Marilyn at a March 30, 1955, charity event in Madison Square Garden. Berle was the ringmaster and Marilyn rode a pink elephant. At another event, when he was opening at the Flamingo in Las Vegas, Berle had the pleasant duty of escorting Elizabeth Taylor on one arm and Marilyn on the other. Berle and Marilyn saw each other in public on about four other occasions, at charity functions. According to Berle, the last time he and Marilyn met was in 1959 when he was in Marilyn’s movie, Let’s Make Love.14 Berle immediately noticed a change in his old ﬂame. She was as beautiful as ever, of course, but she seemed lost in her own thoughts and was no longer the naïve innocent. Marilyn never said a word about their relationship on Ladies of the Chorus. Berle believed her non-reaction was genuine. “I think she actually could not remember that she and I had been together for a while eleven years before.” The only conversation they had was about the cigars Berle smoked. Marilyn said that she like the aroma. Berle gave her a box of small cigars but never discovered if she smoked any of them (Berle & Frankel 265–7).\n\nIRVING BERLIN Famous and prodigious American composer and songwriter. In 1954, MM agreed to be in There’s No Business Like Show Business, a showcase for some of Berlin’s best-loved songs. Marilyn made the picture on the promise of the lead in The Seven Year Itch (1955). Allegedly, Marilyn got the part in There’s No Business Like Show Business because\n\n24 Berlin saw her nude calendar on the producer’s piano and said, “She’s gotta be in the picture.” Berlin was intrigued by her come-hither look and thought she would be perfect for his tongue-in-cheek torch song, “Heat Wave.” Despite the fact that it was two o’clock in the morning, Berlin phoned Marilyn and persuaded her to sing the song to him (Bergreen 518). On the set, Marilyn worked hard at improving her singing, working with the composer, the pianist and vocal coach Hal Schaefer. One day Berlin dropped by the set to see how the new arrangements for his songs were coming along. He was impressed by Marilyn’s performance of “Heat Wave” but she became angry that her friend Schaefer was not getting any recognition. Marilyn demanded that Berlin personally tell Schaefer what a great help he was or she would walk off the picture. Berlin calmed the situation down and the movie was completed. A photo was taken of Berlin and Marilyn in which they are both smiling and looking relaxed (Shevey 265–6; Summers 149; Victor 33–4).\n\nYOGI BERRA Major League Baseball player and manager. In 1955, Berra was in a deleted scene in The Seven Year Itch. In the middle of a game at Yankee Stadium, Berra says of Marilyn’s character, “I don’t know her name, but she’s on the Dazzledent program. The one with the teeth ... on television” (Schwarz 446). In 1959, actress Angie Dickinson took her two favorite ball players, Whitey Ford and Yogi Berra, out to dinner. She said, “They thought I was at least a little bit nifty. They said they did anyway. They did, that is, until Marilyn Monroe sat down at a table about fourteen feet away. Then both of them became unraveled.” According to Dickinson, Whitey went ga-ga and Yogi lost interest in his food. All he could do was mutter ‘Madonne’ ” (Barra 265). JOEY BISHOP\n\nNightclub comedian who progressed to movies and television. In 1954, opening for Frank Sinatra Bishop was at the Copacabana in New York City when MM walked in. She was draped in white ermine and\n\n25 all eyes were immediately on her. Bishop looked at her and said, “I told you to stay in the truck.” His ad-lib stopped the show (Starr 34).\n\nMR. BLACKWELL Mr. Blackwell was the fashion critic notorious for his “Ten Worst– dressed Women of the Year Awards.” The awards were given every year from 1960 until his death in 2008. MM made the list in 1961. Mr. Blackwell said of her: “In private life, Marilyn Monroe is a road-show version of herself. She should get off the stage” (www.wiki pedia.org). HUMPHREY BOGART\n\nScreen legend who became famous for portraying gangsters and tough guys. Bogart had a slight acquaintance with MM through his wife, Lauren Bacall, who co-starred with her in How to Marry a Millionaire (1953). Bogart attended the premiere of the ﬁlm, as did Marilyn, of course. He was also at the party thrown by Billy Wilder to celebrate the completion of The Seven Year Itch in 1955 and was photographed dancing with Marilyn. Marilyn borrowed a red chiffon gown from the studio wardrobe department for the occasion and Bogart was in chin stubble from his work on The Desperate Hours (Spoto 1993, 252; Summers 118).\n\nPAT BOONE Clean-living actor and pop singer. Cantinﬂas, the Mexican ﬁlm star and comedian, had plans to make a movie with himself and co-stars Pat Boone and MM. As intriguing as that sounds, the project never got off the ground. In 1964, Boone co-starred in Goodbye Charlie, a ﬁlm Marilyn had rejected (Pilcher 177). CLARA BOW Silent ﬁlm star who outlived MM by three years. For Life magazine’s Christmas 1958 issue, Marilyn impersonated Clara Bow—The It Girl—before fashion photographer Richard Avedon’s camera.15 Donning a red wig, Marilyn transformed herself into a wild ﬂapper of the 1920s. Arthur Miller, Marilyn’s husband, contributed an essay. He wrote, “Marilyn came onto the set ... and a record player was started. Songs of the ’20s burst forth. Marilyn aimed an experimen-\n\nBoyer tal kick at a balloon on the ﬂoor. She said she was ready. Avedon yelled, “Go!” and she pursed her mouth around her cigaret [in a Clara Bow pose], kicked a balloon, shot the fan out forward—and she made a world. I suddenly saw her dancing on a table, a hundred Scott Fitzgeralds sitting all around her cheering, Pierce-Arrow cars waiting outside, a real orchestra on the stand, the Marines in Nicaragua. We all found ourselves laughing. Her miraculous sense of sheer play had been unloosed. Suddenly she was all angles, suddenly the wig had become her own hair and the costume her own dress” (Life, December 22, 1958). Bow saw the picture and was ﬂattered by it. She admired Marilyn, thought of her as her favorite actress, but was too insecure to meet her. Bow identiﬁed with Marilyn. Both had mentally unstable mothers and grandmothers, had suffered abusive childhoods, felt trapped by their sex symbol images, were usually underpaid, and had to struggle to be taken seriously. Bow wrote: “I slip my old crown of ‘It’ Girl not to Taylor or Bardot, but to Monroe,” (Stenn 72). After Marilyn died, Bow was desolate. She said: “She was so lovely and too young to die. God bless her.... I never met Marilyn Monroe, but if I had, I would have tried very hard to help her. A sex symbol is a heavy load to carry when one is tired, hurt, and bewildered” (Stenn 278). Marilyn had wanted to ﬁlm Clara Bow’s life story but Bow did not want the picture made while she was still alive (Riese & Hitchens 61).\n\nCHARLES BOYER Elegant French actor. Joking around with her roommate, Shelley Winters, Marilyn compiled a list of men she would like to sleep with and Charles Boyer’s name was included (Gottfried 2003, 228). Even though Boyer had a long career in Hollywood he found the place insufferably inbred, sanctimonious and vindictive. The controversy that arose over MM’s nude calendar photos was a case in point. Boyer was enraged that Marilyn was being condemned and was in danger of losing her movie contract. “How can these people be so vicious?” was his comment (Swindell 229).\n\nBracken\n\nEDDIE BRACKEN Comic actor who played Willie Fisher, a worried soldier in We’re Not Married (1952). MM was also in the ﬁlm but did not share screen time with Bracken (www.imdb.com). MARLON BRANDO Virile, brooding actor with an overpowering screen presence. MM and Brando never worked together, although they came close. When Marilyn failed to get the lead in The Egyptian (1954), Brando abandoned the ﬁlm as well. Replaced by Gene Tierney and Edmund Purdom, the movie ﬂopped. Marilyn agreed to be in Paris Blues (1961) if Brando was her co-star. When the ﬁlm was made it was with Paul Newman and Joanne Woodward. Marilyn met Brando as early as 1952 when she visited the set of Viva Zapata!16 She visited Brando again on the set of Desiree in 1954. A photograph exists of the two of them together, with Brando dressed as Napoleon Bonaparte. Marilyn was quoted in a popular magazine as saying: “I read recently that, before I met Joe [DiMaggio], I had a secret romance with Marlon Brando. That’s not true either. I have met Marlon and I like him both as a person and as an actor. I think he is one of ﬁnest actors on the screen. I have been receiving letters from teenagers who adore Marlon, suggesting that I play in a picture with him. Maybe I’ll forward these to Mr. Zanuck” (The American Weekly 11/23/52). It is alleged that, in 1955, between Marilyn’s divorce from Joe DiMaggio and marriage to Arthur Miller, that the two devotees of method acting did have an affair. Marilyn never admitted to that but she did say: “Personally I react to Marlon Brando. He’s a favorite of mine, one of the most attractive men I’ve ever met.” Marilyn conﬁded to a friend that Brando was sweet and tender and that she referred to him by the code name of “Carlo.” Whatever transpired between the two, Brando became one of Marilyn’s most steadfast friends. She celebrated her last birthday at his house and Brando spoke with her on the telephone just a day or two before she died. After Marilyn’s death, Brando refused to discuss their relationship: “I did know her, and out of that\n\n26 sentiment for her, I could never talk about her for publication” (Summers 195). After Marilyn’s death, about all Brando ever said was the following: “Do you remember when Marilyn Monroe died? Everybody stopped work, and you could see all that day the same expressions on their faces, the same thought: ‘How can a girl with success, fame, youth, money, beauty ... how could she kill herself?’ Nobody could understand it because those are the things that everybody wants, and they can’t believe that life wasn’t important to Marilyn Monroe, or that her life was elsewhere” (Victor 41–2).\n\nWALTER BRENNAN Three-time Oscar winner who specialized in playing crotchety old-timers. Brennan co-starred in two ﬁlms with MM: Scudda Hoo! Scudda Hay! (1948) and A Ticket to Tomahawk (1950). Marilyn had uncredited parts in both. Brennan was also in a deleted sequence of another Marilyn Monroe picture, We’re Not Married (1952) (Riese & Hitchens 64; Victor 42; www.imdb.com). BENJAMIN BRITTEN British composer, pianist and conductor. Eager to ﬁnd a way to promote the Aldeburgh Festival of classical music, which he had founded, Britten wondered if he could take advantage of Marilyn Monroe’s visit to England in 1956. It would be a coup if he could get Marilyn to open the garden party fundraiser. In a letter to Edith Sitwell, dated July 29, Britten wrote, “Because you say how nice & simple, & also interested in ‘cultural’ things, she is, I wonder whether you could help us approach Marilyn Monroe. I don’t know her at all, & in fact am slightly disturbed by her friendship with the Oliviers ... so a word from you would help enormously. Could you either write to her yourself, or write me a short note ... to enclose with an invitation to her?” (Reed 468). Sitwell replied the next day: “I’d better let you know at once, so there will be no delay in getting someone else. Alas, there isn’t a hope that we can get Miss Monroe. For both she and her husband told me, when they came to see me, that she is ﬁlming—or rather will be ﬁlming, for she hadn’t, then, actually started—twelve hours a day” (Reed 469).\n\nCaesar\n\n27\n\nJOE E. BROWN\n\nLarge-mouthed comedian who played a peculiar millionaire in Some Like It Hot (1959). Upon learning that the object of his desire, Jack Lemmon is not a woman but a man, Brown’s response, the ﬁnal line in the ﬁlm, is famous: “Well, nobody’s perfect.” Marilyn and Brown only shared a small amount of screen time in the ﬁlm. However, they had a cordial relationship and were photographed together on the set (Doll 202; Rollyson 1993, 150–1; Shevey 382–3).\n\nYUL BRYNNER\n\nExotic international star with a shaven head. Brynner won an Academy Award for The King and I (1956). A fan magazine hinted that Brynner and MM may have had an affair. Brynner, who enjoyed playing with the truth, neither conﬁrmed nor denied the rumor. He said: “I’m ﬂattered. All I can say is that Marilyn has good taste in her escorts. She is an attractive and sensitive woman. When she puts on her warpaint she instantly becomes a radiant thing. She can also look like an old pancake left over from a Sunday breakfast” (Robbins 94). According to Rock Brynner, Yul’s son, his father did have a ﬂing with Marilyn Monroe in 1955. Rock recalled meeting Marilyn unexpectedly when he was 9 years old and Yul brought her home. The next morning he saw Marilyn’s clothes scattered about. Yul said to him, “That will be our secret, laddie” (Capua 55).\n\nWILLIAM F. BUCKLEY, JR.\n\nAuthor and conservative political commentator. In 1952, Buckley was living in the same apartment complex as Marilyn Monroe. He and his wife started exiting their apartment at all hours in the hope that “one of us would one day bump into our fellow-tenant Marilyn Monroe in the elevator, but we never did lay eyes on her” (Buckley 165).\n\n~ UEL LUIS BUN\n\nSpanish ﬁlm director who was long active in Mexico. During a trip to Mexico in February 1962, Marilyn Monroe ~ on the set of The Exterminating visited Bunuel Angel (Rechy 34; www.cursumperﬁcio.net /biography/1962).\n\nGEORGE BURNS\n\nActor, comedian and singer who enjoyed an incredible 90–year career in show business. He was 30 when MM was born; by the time he died at age 100, he had outlived her by nearly 34 years. On November 6, 1954, Burns attended an exclusive dinner party at a Beverly Hills restaurant to honor Marilyn and to celebrate the completion of The Seven Year Itch. Burns was seated under a cardboard cutout of Marilyn in her famous skirt-blowing scene (Learning 1998, 134). Burns was quoted as saying, “If you were married to Marilyn Monroe—you’d cheat with some ugly girl” (Crawley 14).\n\nRAYMOND BURR\n\nHeavyset Canadian actor who found fame as television’s Perry Mason. In 1949 Burr had a small part as Alphonse Zoto in a forgettable Marx Brothers comedy, Love Happy. MM had an even smaller part as Groucho Marx’s sexy unnamed client (www.imdb.com).\n\nRICHARD\n\nBURTON Hard-drinking Welsh actor who was married to Elizabeth Taylor. In 1953, Burton took a break from ﬁlming The Robe to visit the set of How to Marry a Millionaire (Howard 164). At one point Burton was considered for the male lead in The Prince and the Showgirl (1957). Marilyn told her agent, Charles Feldman, that “she would love to sleep with the Prince if his name was Richard Burton” (Meyers 158).\n\nRED BUTTONS Actor and comedian who had a long career in theater and ﬁlm. Marilyn Monroe and Red Buttons were never in the same ﬁlm but they were photographed together at a charity show organized by Danny Thomas in aid of St. Jude’s Children’s Hospital. The event was held at the Hollywood Bowl in July 1953 (www.cursumperﬁcio. net ﬁles/charity; www.youtube.com “Marilyn Monroe at the Hollywood Bowl with Danny Thomas”).\n\n-CSID CAESAR\n\nEmmy-winning comedian, actor and writer known for his work on televi-\n\nCagney sion’s Your Show of Shows (1950 –1954). One evening after his live televison show, Caesar was relaxing at his favorite hangout when he felt a pair of hands on his shoulders. He turned around and was stunned to discover MM standing there. Marilyn, who was not a big TV viewer, had seen Caesar do a funny television sketch and wanted to speak to him about it. Marilyn said: “I just came over to congratulate you. I never saw anything like that. When you started playing tic-tac-toe on your face, I screamed. I almost wet my pants. So I tracked you down to this restaurant.” Caesar escorted Marilyn back to her table, pulled out her chair, sat with her and thanked her for her kind words (Caesar & Friedfeld 258).\n\nJIMMY\n\nCAGNEY Academy Awardwinning ﬁlm star. In 1954, MM met up with Cagney at a Beverly Hills party hosted by Look magazine. A photograph was taken of the two screen legends in conversation. Jimmy’s sister, Jeanne Cagney, was a ﬁlm and television actress who appeared with Marilyn in the 1952 movie Don’t Bother to Knock (Anonymous 132– 3; Victor 85; www.imbd.com). SAMMY CAHN\n\nLyricist who wrote many songs for the movies, often with Jimmy Van Heusen. Cahn did the songs for MM in Let’s Make Love (1960). One Monday morning, Twentieth Century–Fox’s music department phoned up Cahn and Van Heusen and told them to get over to the studio right away. Marilyn was there and she was ready to work on her music. Cahn did not want to go until Marilyn’s legendary tardiness was brought up. “No way [you can’t come] we’ll never be able to get her here again,” he was told (Cahn 241).\n\nMICHAEL CAIN\n\nVersatile English actor who served in the British Army in Korea. In February 1954, MM interrupted her honeymoon with Joe DiMaggio to entertain the troops in South Korea. She ﬂew in by helicopter, lying down on the ﬂoor of the machine with two airmen sitting on her feet, to blow kisses to thousands of soldiers. Wearing a lowcut plum-shaded gown with sequins, she sang “Bye Bye Baby,” “Diamonds Are a Girl’s Best\n\n28 Friend,” and “Do It Again.” The lyrics of the latter were changed to “Kiss Me Again,” because the original words were considered to be too suggestive. In four days Marilyn performed ten shows for more than 100,000 (mostly American) troops. Marilyn regarded her trip to Korea as one of the high points of her life saying, “I never felt like a star before in my heart. It was so wonderful to look down and see a fellow smiling at me” (Riese & Hitchens 254). The army brass, after a near riot broke out, considered the pandemonium generated by Marilyn’s visit to be harmful to service morale. During her performances she would say things such as: “You fellas are always whistling at sweater girls. Well, take away their sweaters and what have you got?” (Spada & Zeno 83). Michael Cain was one of those smiling fellows who saw Marilyn perform in a makeshift outdoor theater. He recalled: “I can still see her now, blonde and angelically beautiful, the complete love goddess. Utterly unapproachable, of course. I reckon we all dreamed about her for weeks afterwards” (Hall 46). Other sources: Summers 131–2; Victor 160\n\nLOUIS CALHERN Character actor who had a 35 year career in Hollywood. In 1950 Calhern played opposite MM in John Huston’s The Asphalt Jungle. Although playing the ultimate sugar daddy, the standards of the time required that Calhern be referred to as Marilyn’s “uncle.” Marilyn’s character was, of course, Calhern’s mistress in the ﬁlm. Marilyn said, “Nobody would have heard of me if it hadn’t been for John Huston. When we started Asphalt Jungle, my ﬁrst picture17, I was very nervous, but John said, ‘Look at Calhern ... see how he’s shaking. If you’re not nervous, you might as well give up’ ” (Goode 200). Calhern and Marilyn were also in 1952’s We’re Not Married but did not share any scenes (Shevey 156 – 7; Victor 47). RORY CALHOUN Calhoun was a mostly B–grade actor in ﬁlms and television. His best ﬁlm was How to Marry a Millionaire (1953), in which he played opposite MM. Calhoun ap-\n\nCapote\n\n29 peared in two other pictures with Marilyn: A Ticket to Tomahawk (1950) and River of No Return (1954). On A Ticket to Tomahawk, recalled Calhoun, Marilyn was “like a little kid the way she bubbled sometimes, but scared as hell— scared of the crew and scared because when she was left on her own she didn’t know if she was doing something right or not.... Problems came up with her in the studio, and on location which was in Durango,18 where she got sick. I swore she had stomach poisoning because of so much pain she seemed to be having. Like someone being tortured. She said she had to take a lot of penicillin but the doctor told her it wasn’t wise. He was saying a person’s system couldn’t handle that much, but Marilyn said it was okay. She said she could take it and it’d be okay. Like a damn fool she went ahead and took all this penicillin and sure as shit she busted out in penicillin poisoning. I thought, that’s god-damned dumb! She had rashes all over and even in her crotch which she’d talk about in case you were interested in her rashes, and she’d show you if you wanted. I didn’t see too many around who weren’t interested in looking at her rashes, including me” (Gilmore 105–7).\n\nMARIA CALLAS\n\nGreek opera diva. On May 19, 1962, Callas was one of the invited performers at a Democratic Party fundraiser in Madison Square Garden. It was also the occasion of President John F. Kennedy’s 45th birthday celebration.19 This was the event at which MM cooed her famous rendition of “Happy Birthday, Mr. President.” Marilyn was usually late and this event was no exception. By the time Callas came on to sing the ‘Habanero’ and ‘Séguedille’ from Carmen, the audience was clearly impatient for Marilyn. Callas received suitable applause but she resented being upstaged by the blonde bombshell. As Callas took her bows, Maril"
