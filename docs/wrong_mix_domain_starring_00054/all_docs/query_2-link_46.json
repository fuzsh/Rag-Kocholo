        "text": "Born on January 22, 1965, in New York City, Diane Lane was raised by her parents Colleen Leigh Farrington, a nightclub singer and Playboy centerfold, and Burton Eugene Lane, a drama coach who once managed Burt Reynolds' acting career. Her foray into acting started early when she made her stage debut at the tender age of six, securing a role in the acclaimed production of Medea at La MaMa Experimental Theatre Club in New York. Lane's film career kicked off with a bang when she debuted in George Roy Hill's 1979 film, A Little Romance, opposite Sir Laurence Olivier. The film was highly successful, earning Lane recognition as a promising young talent. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, she continued to impress critics and audiences alike with her performances in films such as The Outsiders, Under the Tuscan Sun, and Unfaithful, the latter of which garnered her nominations for an Academy Award, Golden Globe, and Screen Actors Guild Award. Despite her early success, Lane never allowed her career to overshadow her personal life. She has been married twice, first to actor Christopher Lambert with whom she shares a daughter, Eleanor Lambert, and later to actor Josh Brolin, though both marriages ended in divorce. Despite these challenges, Diane Lane continues to shine, carving out an enduring career marked by versatility, depth, and a unique ability to captivate audiences worldwide.\n\nLinda Denise Blair (born January 22, 1959) is an American actress. Blair played the possessed child, Regan, in the film The Exorcist (1973), for which she was nominated for an Academy Award and won a Golden Globe. She reprised her role in Exorcist II: The Heretic (1977), for which she was nominated for a Saturn Award. Blair would go on to star in numerous controversial dramatic television films, such as Born Innocent (1974) and Sarah T. – Portrait of a Teenage Alcoholic (1975) before establishing herself as a sex symbol in the musical Roller Boogie in 1979. The 1980s saw Blair starring in numerous exploitation and horror films, such as the slasher film Hell Night (1981), the prison drama Chained Heat (1983), and the Grindhouse cult thriller Savage Streets (1984). Throughout the 1990s, Blair appeared in various independent films and B movies, as well as several television credits: From 2001 to 2003, she was the host of the Fox Family reality series Scariest Places on Earth, and in 2006 had a guest role on the series Supernatural. She also appeared as herself on the Animal Planet series Pit Boss from 2010 to 2012. In addition to her acting credits, Blair has publicly supported various charitable causes, specifically animal rights. In 2004, she founded the Linda Blair WorldHeart Foundation, which serves to rehabilitate and adopt rescue animals.\n\nJohn Hurt was a versatile and respected English actor known for his remarkable acting prowess. Born on January 22, 1940, in Chesterfield, Derbyshire, England, Hurt's passion for the arts was evident from a young age. He studied at the Grimsby Art School before earning a scholarship to the prestigious Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA) in London. His career spanned over six decades, with his first major role coming in 1962 when he starred in The Wild and the Willing. Hurt's acting range was vast, encompassing a variety of roles that showcased his ability to immerse himself into any character. He earned considerable acclaim for his riveting portrayal of John Merrick in David Lynch's The Elephant Man (1980), a performance that earned him a BAFTA award and an Oscar nomination. His other notable roles include the flamboyant Quentin Crisp in The Naked Civil Servant (1975), the ill-fated Kane in Ridley Scott's Alien (1979), and the wand maker Ollivander in the Harry Potter series. Off-screen, John Hurt was a man of great compassion and humility. He was an active patron of several charities and was passionate about conservation. In recognition of his contributions to the performing arts, he was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II in 2015. Despite facing health challenges in his later years, Hurt continued to work until his death on January 25, 2017. His enduring legacy in film and television continues to inspire generations of actors and audiences alike.\n\nSamuel Cook (January 22, 1931 – December 11, 1964), known professionally as Sam Cooke, was an American singer, songwriter, civil-rights activist and entrepreneur. Influential as both a singer and composer, he is commonly known as the King of Soul for his distinctive vocals and importance within popular music. He began singing as a child and joined the Soul Stirrers before moving to a solo career where he scored a string of hit songs like \"You Send Me\", \"A Change Is Gonna Come\", \"Wonderful World\", \"Chain Gang\", \"Twistin' the Night Away\", and \"Bring it on Home to Me\". His pioneering contributions to soul music contributed to the rise of Aretha Franklin, Bobby Womack, Al Green, Curtis Mayfield, Stevie Wonder, Marvin Gaye, and Billy Preston, and popularized the likes of Otis Redding and James Brown. AllMusic biographer Bruce Eder wrote that Cooke was \"the inventor of soul music\", and possessed \"an incredible natural singing voice and a smooth, effortless delivery that has never been surpassed\".On December 11, 1964, at the age of 33, Cooke was shot and killed by Bertha Franklin, the manager of the Hacienda Motel in Los Angeles, California. After an inquest, the courts ruled Cooke's death to be a justifiable homicide. Since that time, the circumstances of his death have been called into question by Cooke's family."
