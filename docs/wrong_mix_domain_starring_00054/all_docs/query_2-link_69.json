        "text": "A $2.00 \\mathrm{~kg}$ particle moves along an $x$ axis in one-dimensional motion while a conservative force along that axis acts on it. The potential energy $U(x)$ associated with the force is plotted in Fig. 8-10a. That is, if the particle were placed at any position between $x=0$ and $x=7.00 \\mathrm{~m}$, it would have the plotted value of $U$. At $x=6.5 \\mathrm{~m}$, the particle has velocity $\\vec{v}_0=(-4.00 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}) \\hat{\\mathrm{i}}$ From Figure, determine the particle's speed at $x_1=4.5 \\mathrm{~m}$.\n\nIf a force is conservative, it is possible to assign a numerical value for the potential at any point and conversely, when an object moves from one location to another, the force changes the potential energy of the object by an amount that does not depend on the path taken, contributing to the mechanical energy and the overall conservation of energy. The work done by a conservative force is equal to the negative of change in potential energy during that process. Since the position, velocity, and acceleration are collinear (parallel, and lie on the same line) – only the magnitudes of these vectors are necessary, and because the motion is along a straight line, the problem effectively reduces from three dimensions to one. \\begin{align} v & = at+v_0 & [1]\\\\\\ r & = r_0 + v_0 t + \\tfrac12 {a}t^2 & [2]\\\\\\ r & = r_0 + \\tfrac12 \\left( v+v_0 \\right )t & [3]\\\\\\ v^2 & = v_0^2 + 2a\\left( r - r_0 \\right) & [4]\\\\\\ r & = r_0 + vt - \\tfrac12 {a}t^2 & [5]\\\\\\ \\end{align} where: * is the particle's initial position * is the particle's final position * is the particle's initial velocity * is the particle's final velocity * is the particle's acceleration * is the time interval Equations [1] and [2] are from integrating the definitions of velocity and acceleration, subject to the initial conditions and ; \\begin{align} \\mathbf{v} & = \\int \\mathbf{a} dt = \\mathbf{a}t+\\mathbf{v}_0 \\,, & [1] \\\\\\ \\mathbf{r} & = \\int (\\mathbf{a}t+\\mathbf{v}_0) dt = \\frac{\\mathbf{a}t^2}{2}+\\mathbf{v}_0t +\\mathbf{r}_0 \\,, & [2] \\\\\\ \\end{align} in magnitudes, \\begin{align} v & = at+v_0 \\,, & [1] \\\\\\ r & = \\frac{{a}t^2}{2}+v_0t +r_0 \\,. A conservative force depends only on the position of the object. Graph of the Lennard-Jones potential function: Intermolecular potential energy as a function of the distance of a pair of particles. (Velocity is on the y-axis and time on the x-axis. If the force is not conservative, then defining a scalar potential is not possible, because taking different paths would lead to conflicting potential differences between the start and end points. If the velocity or positions change non-linearly over time, such as in the example shown in the figure, then differentiation provides the correct solution. thumb|360px|v vs t graph for a moving particle under a non-uniform acceleration a. In physics, a conservative force is a force with the property that the total work done in moving a particle between two points is independent of the path taken.HyperPhysics - Conservative force Equivalently, if a particle travels in a closed loop, the total work done (the sum of the force acting along the path multiplied by the displacement) by a conservative force is zero. The position of the particle is \\mathbf{r} =\\mathbf{r}\\left ( r(t),\\theta(t) \\right ) = r \\mathbf{\\hat{e}}_r where and are the polar unit vectors. For example, if a child slides down a frictionless slide, the work done by the gravitational force on the child from the start of the slide to the end is independent of the shape of the slide; it only depends on the vertical displacement of the child. ==Mathematical description== A force field F, defined everywhere in space (or within a simply-connected volume of space), is called a conservative force or conservative vector field if it meets any of these three equivalent conditions: # The curl of F is the zero vector: \\vec{ abla} \\times \\vec{F} = \\vec{0}. where in two dimensions this reduces to: \\frac{\\partial F_y}{\\partial x} - \\frac{\\partial F_x}{\\partial y} = 0 # There is zero net work (W) done by the force when moving a particle through a trajectory that starts and ends in the same place: W \\equiv \\oint_C \\vec{F} \\cdot \\mathrm{d}\\vec r = 0. The Lennard-Jones model describes the potential intermolecular energy V between two particles based on the outlined principles. The mean potential energy per particle is negative. Accordingly, some authors classify the magnetic force as conservative,For example, : \"In general, a force which depends explicitly upon the velocity of the particle is not conservative. Specific potential energy is potential energy of an object per unit of mass of that object. Suppose a particle starts at point A, and there is a force F acting on it. In mechanics, the derivative of the position vs. time graph of an object is equal to the velocity of the object. The variation of energy for the particle, taking path 1 from A to B and then path 2 backwards from B to A, is 0; thus, the work is the same in path 1 and 2, i.e., the work is independent of the path followed, as long as it goes from A to B. Using equation [4] in the set above, we have: s= \\frac{v^2 - u^2}{-2g}. Therefore, the slope of the curve gives the change in position divided by the change in time, which is the definition of the average velocity for that interval of time on the graph. Since the velocity of the object is the derivative of the position graph, the area under the line in the velocity vs. time graph is the displacement of the object.\n\n-3.8\n\n1000\n\n'-45.0'\n\n3.0\n\n20.2\n\nD\n\nA playful astronaut releases a bowling ball, of mass $m=$ $7.20 \\mathrm{~kg}$, into circular orbit about Earth at an altitude $h$ of $350 \\mathrm{~km}$. What is the mechanical energy $E$ of the ball in its orbit?\n\nHence, mechanical energy E_\\text{mechanical} of the satellite-Earth system is given by E_\\text{mechanical} = U + K E_\\text{mechanical} = - G \\frac{M m}{r}\\ + \\frac{1}{2}\\, m v^2 If the satellite is in circular orbit, the energy conservation equation can be further simplified into E_\\text{mechanical} = - G \\frac{M m}{2r} since in circular motion, Newton's 2nd Law of motion can be taken to be G \\frac{M m}{r^2}\\ = \\frac{m v^2}{r} ==Conversion== Today, many technological devices convert mechanical energy into other forms of energy or vice versa. Thus, the total energy of the system remains unchanged though the mechanical energy of the system has reduced. ===Satellite=== thumb|plot of kinetic energy K, gravitational potential energy, U and mechanical energy E_\\text{mechanical} versus distance away from centre of earth, r at R= Re, R= 2*Re, R=3*Re and lastly R = geostationary radius A satellite of mass m at a distance r from the centre of Earth possesses both kinetic energy, K, (by virtue of its motion) and gravitational potential energy, U, (by virtue of its position within the Earth's gravitational field; Earth's mass is M). Specific mechanical energy is the mechanical energy of an object per unit of mass. The relations are used. p= \\frac{h^2}{\\mu} = a(1-{e^2}) = r_{p}(1+e) where * p\\,\\\\! is the conic section semi-latus rectum. * r_p\\,\\\\! is distance at periastron of the body from the center of mass. v = \\sqrt{\\mu\\left({2\\over{r}} - {1\\over{a}}\\right)} where *\\mu\\, is the standard gravitational parameter, G(m1+m2), often expressed as GM when one body is much larger than the other. *r\\, is the distance between the orbiting body and center of mass. *a\\,\\\\! is the length of the semi-major axis. === Orbital Mechanics === When calculating the specific mechanical energy of a satellite in orbit around a celestial body, the mass of the satellite is assumed to be negligible: \\mu = G(M + m) \\approx GM where M is the mass of the celestial body. The elastic potential energy equation is used in calculations of positions of mechanical equilibrium. If the satellite's orbit is an ellipse the potential energy of the satellite, and its kinetic energy, both vary with time but their sum remains constant. Gravitational energy or gravitational potential energy is the potential energy a massive object has in relation to another massive object due to gravity. It is defined as: \\epsilon= \\epsilonk+\\epsilonp where * \\epsilonk is the specific kinetic energy * \\epsilonp it the specific potential energy == Astrodynamics == In the gravitational two-body problem, the specific mechanical energy of one body \\epsilon is given as: \\begin{align} \\epsilon &= \\frac{v^2}{2} - \\frac{\\mu}{r} = -\\frac{1}{2} \\frac{\\mu^2}{h^2} \\left(1 - e^2\\right) = -\\frac{\\mu}{2a} \\end{align} where * v\\,\\\\! is the orbital speed of the body; relative to center of mass. * r\\,\\\\! is the orbital distance between the body and center of mass; * \\mu = {G}(m_1 + m_2)\\,\\\\! is the standard gravitational parameter of the bodies; * h\\,\\\\! is the specific relative angular momentum of the same body referenced to the center of mass. The gravitational potential energy of an object is equal to the weight W of the object multiplied by the height h of the object's center of gravity relative to an arbitrary datum: U = W h The potential energy of an object can be defined as the object's ability to do work and is increased as the object is moved in the opposite direction of the direction of the force. Specific potential energy is potential energy of an object per unit of mass of that object. Elastic energy is the mechanical potential energy stored in the configuration of a material or physical system as it is subjected to elastic deformation by work performed upon it. The pendulum reaches greatest kinetic energy and least potential energy when in the vertical position, because it will have the greatest speed and be nearest the Earth at this point. Though energy cannot be created or destroyed, it can be converted to another form of energy. ===Swinging pendulum=== 200px|thumb|A swinging pendulum with the velocity vector (green) and acceleration vector (blue). The change in potential energy moving from the surface (a distance R from the center) to a height h above the surface is \\begin{align} \\Delta U &= \\frac{GMm}{R}-\\frac{GMm}{R+h} \\\\\\ &= \\frac{GMm}{R}\\left(1-\\frac{1}{1+h/R}\\right). \\end{align} If h/R is small, as it must be close to the surface where g is constant, then this expression can be simplified using the binomial approximation \\frac{1}{1+h/r} \\approx 1-\\frac{h}{R} to \\begin{align} \\Delta U &\\approx \\frac{GMm}{R}\\left[1-\\left(1-\\frac{h}{R}\\right)\\right] \\\\\\ \\Delta U &\\approx \\frac{GMmh}{R^2}\\\\\\ \\Delta U &\\approx m\\left(\\frac{GM}{R^2}\\right)h. \\end{align} As the gravitational field is g = GM / R^2, this reduces to \\Delta U \\approx mgh. The gravitational potential energy is the potential energy an object has because it is within a gravitational field. thumb|250px|An example of a mechanical system: A satellite is orbiting the Earth influenced only by the conservative gravitational force; its mechanical energy is therefore conserved. In a mechanical system like a swinging pendulum subjected to the conservative gravitational force where frictional forces like air drag and friction at the pivot are negligible, energy passes back and forth between kinetic and potential energy but never leaves the system. The force between a point mass, M, and another point mass, m, is given by Newton's law of gravitation: Extract of page 10 F = \\frac {GMm}{r^2} To get the total work done by an external force to bring point mass m from infinity to the final distance R (for example the radius of Earth) of the two mass points, the force is integrated with respect to displacement: W = \\int_\\infty^R \\frac {GMm}{r^2}dr = -\\left . \\frac{G M m}{r} \\right|_{\\infty}^{R} Because \\lim_{r\\to \\infty} \\frac{1}{r} = 0, the total work done on the object can be written as: Extract of page 143 In the common situation where a much smaller mass m is moving near the surface of a much larger object with mass M, the gravitational field is nearly constant and so the expression for gravitational energy can be considerably simplified. The energy is potential as it will be converted into other forms of energy, such as kinetic energy and sound energy, when the object is allowed to return to its original shape (reformation) by its elasticity. In an elastic collision, mechanical energy is conserved – the sum of the mechanical energies of the colliding objects is the same before and after the collision. On the other hand, it will have its least kinetic energy and greatest potential energy at the extreme positions of its swing, because it has zero speed and is farthest from Earth at these points. In physical sciences, mechanical energy is the sum of potential energy and kinetic energy.\n\n-214\n\n29.36\n\n0.01961\n\n132.9\n\n11000\n\nA\n\nLet the disk in Figure start from rest at time $t=0$ and also let the tension in the massless cord be $6.0 \\mathrm{~N}$ and the angular acceleration of the disk be $-24 \\mathrm{rad} / \\mathrm{s}^2$. What is its rotational kinetic energy $K$ at $t=2.5 \\mathrm{~s}$ ?\n\nThe rotational energy depends on the moment of inertia for the system, I . Rotational energy or angular kinetic energy is kinetic energy due to the rotation of an object and is part of its total kinetic energy. Knowledge of the Euler angles as function of time t and the initial coordinates \\mathbf{r}(0) determine the kinematics of the rigid rotor. === Classical kinetic energy === The following text forms a generalization of the well- known special case of the rotational energy of an object that rotates around one axis. The rotor is modeled as an infinitely thin disc, inducing a constant velocity along the axis of rotation. The classical kinetic energy T of the rigid rotor can be expressed in different ways: * as a function of angular velocity * in Lagrangian form * as a function of angular momentum * in Hamiltonian form. The kinetic energy T of the linear rigid rotor is given by 2T = \\mu R^2 \\left[\\dot{\\theta}^2 + (\\dot\\varphi\\,\\sin\\theta)^2\\right] = \\mu R^2 \\begin{pmatrix}\\dot{\\theta} & \\dot{\\varphi}\\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\\\ 0 & \\sin^2\\theta \\\\\\ \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix}\\dot{\\theta} \\\\\\ \\dot{\\varphi}\\end{pmatrix} = \\mu \\begin{pmatrix}\\dot{\\theta} & \\dot{\\varphi}\\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} h_\\theta^2 & 0 \\\\\\ 0 & h_\\varphi^2 \\\\\\ \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix}\\dot{\\theta} \\\\\\ \\dot{\\varphi}\\end{pmatrix}, where h_\\theta = R\\, and h_\\varphi= R\\sin\\theta\\, are scale (or Lamé) factors. Note the close relationship between the result for rotational energy and the energy held by linear (or translational) motion: :E_\\mathrm{translational} = \\tfrac{1}{2} m v^2 In the rotating system, the moment of inertia, I, takes the role of the mass, m, and the angular velocity, \\omega , takes the role of the linear velocity, v. As the Earth has a sidereal rotation period of 23.93 hours, it has an angular velocity of .Launching From Florida: Life in the Fast Lane!, NASA The Earth has a moment of inertia, I = .Moment of inertia--Earth, Wolfram Therefore, it has a rotational kinetic energy of . Looking at rotational energy separately around an object's axis of rotation, the following dependence on the object's moment of inertia is observed:Resnick, R. and Halliday, D. (1966) PHYSICS, Equation 12-11 :E_\\mathrm{rotational} = \\tfrac{1}{2} I \\omega^2 where : \\omega \\ is the angular velocity : I \\ is the moment of inertia around the axis of rotation : E \\ is the kinetic energy The mechanical work required for or applied during rotation is the torque times the rotation angle. – Page 37 of 45 (graphic) For a miniature disc with a diameter of 8 cm (radius of 4 cm), the speed ratio of outer to inner data edge is 1.6. The rotor is rigid if R is independent of time. For a stationary open rotor with no outer duct, such as a helicopter in hover, the power required to produce a given thrust is: :P = \\sqrt{\\frac{T^3}{2 \\rho A}} where: * T is the thrust * \\rho is the density of air (or other medium) * A is the area of the rotor disc * P is power A device which converts the translational energy of the fluid into rotational energy of the axis or vice versa is called a Rankine disk actuator. Note that a different rotation matrix would result from a different choice of Euler angle convention used. ==== Lagrange form ==== Backsubstitution of the expression of \\boldsymbol{\\omega} into T gives the kinetic energy in Lagrange form (as a function of the time derivatives of the Euler angles). The rotational energy of a rolling cylinder varies from one half of the translational energy (if it is massive) to the same as the translational energy (if it is hollow). A linear (data reading and writing) speeds of 2.4 times higher can be reached at the outer disc edge with the same angular (rotation) speed. Seiffert's spherical spiral is a curve on a sphere made by moving on the sphere with constant speed and angular velocity with respect to a fixed diameter. This is because, although the model does account for bond stretching due to rotation, it ignores any bond stretching due to vibrational energy in the bond (anharmonicity in the potential). == Arbitrarily shaped rigid rotor == An arbitrarily shaped rigid rotor is a rigid body of arbitrary shape with its center of mass fixed (or in uniform rectilinear motion) in field-free space R3, so that its energy consists only of rotational kinetic energy (and possibly constant translational energy that can be ignored). In matrix-vector notation, 2 T = \\begin{pmatrix} \\dot{\\alpha} & \\dot{\\beta} & \\dot{\\gamma} \\end{pmatrix} \\; \\mathbf{g} \\; \\begin{pmatrix} \\dot{\\alpha} \\\\\\ \\dot{\\beta} \\\\\\ \\dot{\\gamma}\\\\\\ \\end{pmatrix}, where \\mathbf{g} is the metric tensor expressed in Euler angles--a non-orthogonal system of curvilinear coordinates-- \\mathbf{g}= \\begin{pmatrix} I_1 \\sin^2\\beta \\cos^2\\gamma+I_2\\sin^2\\beta\\sin^2\\gamma+I_3\\cos^2\\beta & (I_2-I_1) \\sin\\beta\\sin\\gamma\\cos\\gamma & I_3\\cos\\beta \\\\\\ (I_2-I_1) \\sin\\beta\\sin\\gamma\\cos\\gamma & I_1\\sin^2\\gamma+I_2\\cos^2\\gamma & 0 \\\\\\ I_3\\cos\\beta & 0 & I_3 \\\\\\ \\end{pmatrix}. ==== Angular momentum form ==== Often the kinetic energy is written as a function of the angular momentum \\mathbf{L} of the rigid rotor. (Note: The corresponding eigenvalue equation gives the Schrödinger equation for the rigid rotor in the form that it was solved for the first time by Kronig and Rabi (for the special case of the symmetric rotor). thumb|An actuator disk accelerating a fluid flow from right to left In fluid dynamics, momentum theory or disk actuator theory is a theory describing a mathematical model of an ideal actuator disk, such as a propeller or helicopter rotor, by W.J.M. Rankine (1865), Alfred George Greenhill (1888) and (1889). This disc creates a flow around the rotor. The instantaneous power of an angularly accelerating body is the torque times the angular velocity.\n\n0.38\n\n2688\n\n90.0\n\n135.36\n\n0.18162\n\nC\n\nA food shipper pushes a wood crate of cabbage heads (total mass $m=14 \\mathrm{~kg}$ ) across a concrete floor with a constant horizontal force $\\vec{F}$ of magnitude $40 \\mathrm{~N}$. In a straight-line displacement of magnitude $d=0.50 \\mathrm{~m}$, the speed of the crate decreases from $v_0=0.60 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}$ to $v=0.20 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}$. What is the increase $\\Delta E_{\\text {th }}$ in the thermal energy of the crate and floor?\n\nWhen heat flows into (respectively, out of) a material, its temperature increases (respectively, decreases), in proportion to the amount of heat divided by the amount (mass) of material, with a proportionality factor called the specific heat capacity of the material. The equation is much simpler and can help to understand better the physics of the materials without focusing on the dynamic of the heat transport process. The Ergun equation, derived by the Turkish chemical engineer Sabri Ergun in 1952, expresses the friction factor in a packed column as a function of the modified Reynolds number. ==Equation== f_p = \\frac {150}{Gr_p}+1.75 where f_p and Gr_p are defined as f_p = \\frac{\\Delta p}{L} \\frac{D_p}{\\rho v_s^2} \\left(\\frac{\\epsilon^3}{1-\\epsilon}\\right) and Gr_p = \\frac{\\rho v_s D_p}{(1-\\epsilon)\\mu} = \\frac{Re}{(1-\\epsilon)}; where: Gr_p is the modified Reynolds number, f_p is the packed bed friction factor \\Delta p is the pressure drop across the bed, L is the length of the bed (not the column), D_p is the equivalent spherical diameter of the packing, \\rho is the density of fluid, \\mu is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid, v_s is the superficial velocity (i.e. the velocity that the fluid would have through the empty tube at the same volumetric flow rate) \\epsilon is the void fraction (porosity) of the bed. In either case, one uses the heat equation :c_t = D \\Delta c, or :P_t = D \\Delta P. By the combination of these observations, the heat equation says the rate \\dot u at which the material at a point will heat up (or cool down) is proportional to how much hotter (or cooler) the surrounding material is. The equation becomes :q = -k \\,\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} Let Q=Q(x,t) be the internal heat energy per unit volume of the bar at each point and time. Specific mechanical energy is the mechanical energy of an object per unit of mass. The heat loss due to linear thermal bridging (H_{TB}) is a physical quantity used when calculating the energy performance of buildings. This is an efficient way of increasing the rate, since the alternative way of doing so is by increasing either the heat transfer coefficient (which depends on the nature of materials being used and the conditions of use) or the temperature gradient (which depends on the conditions of use). In the absence of heat energy generation, from external or internal sources, the rate of change in internal heat energy per unit volume in the material, \\partial Q/\\partial t, is proportional to the rate of change of its temperature, \\partial u/\\partial t. One of the experimentally obtained equations for heat transfer coefficient for the fin surface for low wind velocities is: k=2.11 v^{0.71} \\theta^{0.44} a^{-0.14} where k= Fin surface heat transfer coefficient [W/m2K ] a=fin length [mm] v=wind velocity [km/hr] θ=fin pitch [mm] Another equation for high fluid velocities, obtained from experiments conducted by Gibson, is k= 241.7[0.0247-0.00148(a^{0.8}/\\theta^{0.4})] v^{0.73} where k=Fin surface heat transfer coefficient[W/m2K ] a=Fin length[mm] θ=Fin pitch[mm] v=Wind velocity[km/hr] A more accurate equation for fin surface heat transfer coefficient is: k_{avg} = (2.47-2.55/\\theta^{0.4}) v^{0.9} 0.0872 \\theta + 4.31 where k (avg)= Fin surface heat transfer coefficient[W/m2K ] θ=Fin pitch[mm] v=Wind velocity[km/hr] All these equations can be used to evaluate average heat transfer coefficient for various fin designs. == Design == The momentum conservation equation for this case is given as follows: {\\partial(\\rho v)\\over\\partial t} + v abla . (\\rho v) = - abla P + abla . \\tau + F + \\rho g This is used in combination with the continuity equation. thumb|upright=1.8|Animated plot of the evolution of the temperature in a square metal plate as predicted by the heat equation. Applying the law of conservation of energy to a small element of the medium centered at x, one concludes that the rate at which heat accumulates at a given point x is equal to the derivative of the heat flow at that point, negated. The energy equation is also needed, which is: {\\partial (\\rho E)\\over\\partial t} + abla.[v(\\rho E + p)] = abla.[k_{eff} abla T- \\Sigma_j h_j J_j +(\\tau.v)]. Since heat density is proportional to temperature in a homogeneous medium, the heat equation is still obeyed in the new units. The heat equation is a consequence of Fourier's law of conduction (see heat conduction). Thus instead of being for thermodynamic temperature (Kelvin - K), units of u should be J/L. It appears in both United Kingdom and Irish methodologies. ==Calculation== The calculation of the heat loss due to linear thermal bridging is relatively simple, given by the formula below: :H_{TB} = y \\sum A_{exp} In the formula, y = 0.08 if Accredited Construction details used, and y = 0.15 otherwise, and \\sum A_{exp} is the sum of all the exposed areas of the building envelope, ==References== Category:Energy economics Category:Thermodynamic properties This results in velocity profiles and temperature profiles for various surfaces and this knowledge can be used to design the fin. == References == Category:Unit operations Category:Transport phenomena Category:Heat transfer Thus the rate of heat flow into V is also given by the surface integral q_t(V)= - \\int_{\\partial V} \\mathbf{H}(x) \\cdot \\mathbf{n}(x) \\, dS where n(x) is the outward pointing normal vector at x. When solved as a scalar equation, it can be used to calculate the temperatures at the fin and cylinder surfaces, by reducing to: abla^2 T + {\\overset{.}{q}\\over k} = {1 \\over \\alpha} {\\partial T\\over\\partial t} Where: q = internal heat generation = 0 (in this case). * The coefficient κ(x) is the inverse of specific heat of the substance at x × density of the substance at x: \\kappa = 1/(\\rho c_p).\n\n2.89\n\n72\n\n22.2\n\n0.139\n\n-1.0\n\nC\n\nWhile you are operating a Rotor (a large, vertical, rotating cylinder found in amusement parks), you spot a passenger in acute distress and decrease the angular velocity of the cylinder from $3.40 \\mathrm{rad} / \\mathrm{s}$ to $2.00 \\mathrm{rad} / \\mathrm{s}$ in $20.0 \\mathrm{rev}$, at constant angular acceleration. (The passenger is obviously more of a \"translation person\" than a \"rotation person.\") What is the constant angular acceleration during this decrease in angular speed?\n\nIn physics, angular acceleration refers to the time rate of change of angular velocity. Therefore, the instantaneous angular acceleration α of the particle is given by : \\alpha = \\frac{d}{dt} \\left(\\frac{v_{\\perp}}{r}\\right). The angular velocity satisfies equations of motion known as Euler's equations (with zero applied torque, since by assumption the rotor is in field-free space). The angular velocity ω is the rate of change of angular position with respect to time, which can be computed from the cross-radial velocity as: : \\omega = \\frac{d\\phi}{dt} = \\frac{v_\\perp}{r}. Spin angular acceleration refers to the angular acceleration of a rigid body about its centre of rotation, and orbital angular acceleration refers to the angular acceleration of a point particle about a fixed origin. The vector \\boldsymbol{\\omega} = (\\omega_x, \\omega_y, \\omega_z) on the left hand side contains the components of the angular velocity of the rotor expressed with respect to the body-fixed frame. Angular acceleration is measured in units of angle per unit time squared (which in SI units is radians per second squared), and is usually represented by the symbol alpha (α). Thus the formula for Advance ratio is \\mu = \\frac {V}{u} = \\frac {V}{\\Omega\\cdot R} where Omega (Ω) is the rotor's angular velocity, and R is the rotor radius (about the length of one rotor blade)Jackson, Dave. The SI unit of angular velocity is radians per second, Extract of page 27 with the radian being a dimensionless quantity, thus the SI units of angular velocity may be listed as s−1. The radian per second (symbol: rad⋅s−1 or rad/s) is the unit of angular velocity in the International System of Units (SI). The same equations for the angular speed can be obtained reasoning over a rotating rigid body. Therefore, the orbital angular acceleration is the vector \\boldsymbol\\alpha defined by : \\boldsymbol\\alpha = \\frac{d}{dt} \\left(\\frac{\\mathbf r \\times \\mathbf v}{r^2}\\right). Angular acceleration then may be termed a pseudoscalar, a numerical quantity which changes sign under a parity inversion, such as inverting one axis or switching the two axes. === Particle in three dimensions === In three dimensions, the orbital angular acceleration is the rate at which three-dimensional orbital angular velocity vector changes with time. : Quantity correspondence Angular frequency \\omega Frequency u = \\omega/{2\\pi} 2π rad/s 1 Hz 1 rad/s ≈ 0.159155 Hz 1 rad/s ≈ 9.5493 rpm 0.1047 rad/s ≈ 1 rpm == Coherent units == A use of the unit radian per second is in calculation of the power transmitted by a shaft. As there are two types of angular velocity, namely spin angular velocity and orbital angular velocity, there are naturally also two types of angular acceleration, called spin angular acceleration and orbital angular acceleration respectively. The radian per second is defined as the angular frequency that results in the angular displacement increasing by one radian every second. * Spin angular velocity refers to how fast a rigid body rotates with respect to its center of rotation and is independent of the choice of origin, in contrast to orbital angular velocity. 300px|right|thumb|Rotation of a rigid body P about a fixed axis O. Angular displacement of a body is the angle (in radians, degrees or turns) through which a point revolves around a centre or a specified axis in a specified sense. The instantaneous angular velocity ω at any point in time is given by : \\omega = \\frac{v_{\\perp}}{r}, where r is the distance from the origin and v_{\\perp} is the cross-radial component of the instantaneous velocity (i.e. the component perpendicular to the position vector), which by convention is positive for counter-clockwise motion and negative for clockwise motion. Angular velocity is usually represented by the symbol omega (, sometimes ). In two dimensions, angular acceleration is a number with plus or minus sign indicating orientation, but not pointing in a direction. For rigid bodies, angular acceleration must be caused by a net external torque.\n\n-0.0301\n\n635.7\n\n260.0\n\n-233\n\n209.1\n\nA\n\nA living room has floor dimensions of $3.5 \\mathrm{~m}$ and $4.2 \\mathrm{~m}$ and a height of $2.4 \\mathrm{~m}$.

Also, the investigation of energy saving has shown that this amount varies for buildings located in different climates, suggesting further studies should investigate this factor prior to designing a suitable HVAC system. ==Applications== Underfloor air distribution is frequently used in office buildings, particularly highly-reconfigurable and open plan offices where raised floors are desirable for cable management. Room air distribution is characterizing how air is introduced to, flows through, and is removed from spaces.Fundamentals volume of the ASHRAE Handbook, Atlanta, GA, USA, 2005 HVAC airflow in spaces generally can be classified by two different types: mixing (or dilution) and displacement. ==Mixing systems== Mixing systems generally supply air such that the supply air mixes with the room air so that the mixed air is at the room design temperature and humidity. Displacement room airflow presents an opportunity to improve both the thermal comfort and indoor air quality (IAQ) of the occupied space. In architecture, construction, and real estate, floor area, floor space, or floorspace is the area (measured as square feet or square metres) taken up by a building or part of it. At a certain plane in the room, the airflow rate returned to the UZ is equal to the supply air. thumb|upright=1.25|Different air masses which affect North America as well as other continents, tend to be separated by frontal boundaries In meteorology, an air mass is a volume of air defined by its temperature and humidity.\n\n4.979\n\n0.72\n\n2.0\n\n418\n\n0.14\n\nD\n\nAn astronaut whose height $h$ is $1.70 \\mathrm{~m}$ floats \"feet down\" in an orbiting space shuttle at distance $r=6.77 \\times 10^6 \\mathrm{~m}$ away from the center of Earth. What is the difference between the gravitational acceleration at her feet and at her head?\n\nIt is calculated as the distance between the centre of gravity of a ship and its metacentre. The acceleration of a body near the surface of the Earth is due to the combined effects of gravity and centrifugal acceleration from the rotation of the Earth (but the latter is small enough to be negligible for most purposes); the total (the apparent gravity) is about 0.5% greater at the poles than at the Equator.\"Curious About Astronomy?\", Cornell University, retrieved June 2007 Although the symbol is sometimes used for standard gravity, (without a suffix) can also mean the local acceleration due to local gravity and centrifugal acceleration, which varies depending on one's position on Earth (see Earth's gravity). Acceleration due to gravity, acceleration of gravity or gravity acceleration may refer to: *Gravitational acceleration, the acceleration caused by the gravitational attraction of massive bodies in general *Gravity of Earth, the acceleration caused by the combination of gravitational attraction and centrifugal force of the Earth *Standard gravity, or g, the standard value of gravitational acceleration at sea level on Earth ==See also== *g-force, the acceleration of a body relative to free-fall The standard acceleration due to gravity (or standard acceleration of free fall), sometimes abbreviated as standard gravity, usually denoted by or , is the nominal gravitational acceleration of an object in a vacuum near the surface of the Earth. The metacentric height (GM) is a measurement of the initial static stability of a floating body. As the ship heels over, the centre of gravity generally remains fixed with respect to the ship because it just depends on the position of the ship's weight and cargo, but the surface area increases, increasing BMφ. Although the actual acceleration of free fall on Earth varies according to location, the above standard figure is always used for metrological purposes. Hence, a sufficiently, but not excessively, high metacentric height is considered ideal for passenger ships. ==Metacentre== When a ship heels (rolls sideways), the centre of buoyancy of the ship moves laterally. Geopotential height or geopotential altitude is a vertical coordinate referenced to Earth's mean sea level (assumed zero potential) that represents the work done by lifting one unit mass one unit distance through a region in which the acceleration of gravity is uniformly 9.80665 m/s2. thumb|upright=1.8|A simplified spacecraft system. thumb|upright=1.6|Ship stability diagram showing centre of gravity (G), centre of buoyancy (B), and metacentre (M) with ship upright and heeled over to one side. * Cardiovascular events and changes occurring during spaceflight: these are due to body fluids shift and redistribution, heart rhythm disturbances and decrease in maximal exercise capacity in the micro gravity environment. Geopotential height may be obtained from normalizing geopotential by the acceleration of gravity: :{H} = \\frac{\\Phi}{g_{0}}\\ = \\frac{1}{g_{0}}\\int_0^Z\\ g(\\phi,Z)\\,dZ where g_0 = 9.80665 m/s2, the standard gravity at mean sea level. This position meant that a person's legs experienced only one sixth of their weight, which was the equivalent of being on the lunar surface. The value of defined above is a nominal midrange value on Earth, originally based on the acceleration of a body in free fall at sea level at a geodetic latitude of 45°. thumb|250px|A test subject being suited up for studies on the Reduced Gravity Walking Simulator. This illusion will alter the astronaut's perception of the orienting force of gravity and then lose spatial direction. \"G\", is the center of gravity. While objects are weightless in space, an astronaut has to be familiar with an object's forces of inertia and understand how the object will respond to simple motions to avoid losing it in space. Geopotential height (altitude) differs from geometric (tapeline) height but remains a historical convention in aeronautics as the altitude used for calibration of aircraft barometric altimeters. ==Definition== Geopotential is the gravitational potential energy per unit mass at elevation Z: :\\Phi(Z) = \\int_0^Z\\ g(\\phi,Z)\\,dZ where g(\\phi,Z) is the acceleration due to gravity, \\phi is latitude, and Z is the geometric elevation. Because of this any future medical criteria for commercial spaceflight participants needs to focus specifically on the detrimental effects of rapidly changing gravitational levels, and which individuals will be capable of tolerating this. The centre of gravity of the ship is commonly denoted as point G or CG.\n\n-4.37\n\n157.875\n\n37.9\n\n2.26\n\n3.29527\n\nA\n\nIf the particles in a system all move together, the com moves with them-no trouble there. But what happens when they move in different directions with different accelerations? Here is an example. The three particles in Figure are initially at rest. Each experiences an external force due to bodies outside the three-particle system. The directions are indicated, and the magnitudes are $F_1=6.0 \\mathrm{~N}, F_2=12 \\mathrm{~N}$, and $F_3=14 \\mathrm{~N}$. What is the acceleration of the center of mass of the system?\n\nAnd any system of particles that move under Newtonian gravitation as if they are a rigid body must do so in a central configuration. In Euler's three-body problem we assume that the two centres of attraction are stationary. Together with Euler's collinear solutions, these solutions form the central configurations for the three-body problem. In celestial mechanics and the mathematics of the -body problem, a central configuration is a system of point masses with the property that each mass is pulled by the combined gravitational force of the system directly towards the center of mass, with acceleration proportional to its distance from the center. The central-force problem concerns an ideal situation (a \"one-body problem\") in which a single particle is attracted or repelled from an immovable point O, the center of force.Goldstein, p. 71; Landau and Lifshitz, p. 30; Whittaker, p. Thus, the equation of motion for r can be written in the form \\mu \\ddot{\\mathbf{r}} = \\mathbf{F} where \\mu is the reduced mass \\mu = \\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{m_1} + \\frac{1}{m_2}} = \\frac{m_1 m_2}{m_1 + m_2} As a special case, the problem of two bodies interacting by a central force can be reduced to a central-force problem of one body. ==Qualitative properties== ===Planar motion=== thumb|right|alt=The image shows a yellow disc with three vectors. In an extended modern sense, a three- body problem is any problem in classical mechanics or quantum mechanics that models the motion of three particles. ==Mathematical description== The mathematical statement of the three-body problem can be given in terms of the Newtonian equations of motion for vector positions \\mathbf{r_i} = (x_i, y_i, z_i) of three gravitationally interacting bodies with masses m_i: :\\begin{align} \\ddot\\mathbf{r}_{\\mathbf{1}} &= -G m_2 \\frac{\\mathbf{r_1} - \\mathbf{r_2}}{|\\mathbf{r_1} - \\mathbf{r_2}|^3} - G m_3 \\frac{\\mathbf{r_1} - \\mathbf{r_3}}{|\\mathbf{r_1} - \\mathbf{r_3}|^3}, \\\\\\ \\ddot\\mathbf{r}_{\\mathbf{2}} &= -G m_3 \\frac{\\mathbf{r_2} - \\mathbf{r_3}}{|\\mathbf{r_2} - \\mathbf{r_3}|^3} - G m_1 \\frac{\\mathbf{r_2} - \\mathbf{r_1}}{|\\mathbf{r_2} - \\mathbf{r_1}|^3}, \\\\\\ \\ddot\\mathbf{r}_{\\mathbf{3}} &= -G m_1 \\frac{\\mathbf{r_3} - \\mathbf{r_1}}{|\\mathbf{r_3} - \\mathbf{r_1}|^3} - G m_2 \\frac{\\mathbf{r_3} - \\mathbf{r_2}}{|\\mathbf{r_3} - \\mathbf{r_2}|^3}. \\end{align} where G is the gravitational constant. In physics and classical mechanics, the three-body problem is the problem of taking the initial positions and velocities (or momenta) of three point masses and solving for their subsequent motion according to Newton's laws of motion and Newton's law of universal gravitation. This is the only central configuration for these masses that does not lie in a lower- dimensional subspace. ==Dynamics== Under Newton's law of universal gravitation, bodies placed at rest in a central configuration will maintain the configuration as they collapse to a collision at their center of mass. An additional mass (which may be zero) is placed at the center of the system. Systems of bodies in a two-dimensional central configuration can orbit stably around their center of mass, maintaining their relative positions, with circular orbits around the center of mass or in elliptical orbits with the center of mass at a focus of the ellipse. Those equations are an accurate description of a particular form of the three-body problem. Therefore, both bodies are accelerated if a force is present between them; there is no perfectly immovable center of force. If either center were absent, the particle would move on one of these ellipses, as a solution of the Kepler problem. Special cases of these generalized problems include Darboux's problemDarboux JG, Archives Néerlandaises des Sciences (ser. 2), 6, 371-376 and Velde's problem.Velde (1889) Programm der ersten Höheren Bürgerschule zu Berlin ==Overview and history== Euler's three-body problem is to describe the motion of a particle under the influence of two centers that attract the particle with central forces that decrease with distance as an inverse-square law, such as Newtonian gravity or Coulomb's law. The simplest generalization of Euler's three-body problem is to add a third center of force midway between the original two centers, that exerts only a linear Hooke force (confer Hooke's law). The simplest bodies or elements of a multibody system were treated by Newton (free particle) and Euler (rigid body). Each multibody system formulation may lead to a different mathematical appearance of the equations of motion while the physics behind is the same. In other words, a central force must act along the line joining O with the present position of the particle. Moreover, the motion of three bodies is generally non-repeating, except in special cases. Magnus, Dynamics of multibody systems, Springer Verlag, Berlin (1978). In physics and astronomy, Euler's three-body problem is to solve for the motion of a particle that is acted upon by the gravitational field of two other point masses that are fixed in space.\n\n1.16\n\n28\n\n2283.63\n\n3.00\n\n0.18162\n\nA\n\nAn asteroid, headed directly toward Earth, has a speed of $12 \\mathrm{~km} / \\mathrm{s}$ relative to the planet when the asteroid is 10 Earth radii from Earth's center.

The estimated 4 to 6 meter sized body made one of the closest known approaches to Earth. == Description == On 31 March 2004, around 15:35 UTC, the asteroid is crudely estimated to have passed within approximately 1 Earth radius () or 6,400 kilometers of the surface of the Earth (or 2.02 from Earth's center). Due to this elongated orbit, the Aten asteroid and near-Earth asteroid also classifies as Earth-crosser, Venus-crosser and Mercury-grazer. 1989 VA was the first asteroid discovered with such a small semi-major axis (0.728 AU, about the same as Venus), breaking 2100 Ra-Shalom's distance record (0.832 AU), which had held for over a decade. This asteroid orbits the Sun with a short orbital period at a distance of 0.3–1.2 AU once every 227 days. is a very eccentric, stony asteroid and near-Earth object, approximately 1 kilometer in diameter. is a sub-kilometer asteroid that orbits near Mars's Lagrangian point, on average trailing 60° behind it. It passed closest approach to Earth on 3 March 2016 05:17 UT at a distance of and was quickly approaching the glare of the Sun thus preventing further optical observations. == 2021 approach == It was recovered on 17 February 2021 by Pan-STARRS when the uncertainty in the asteroid's sky position covered about 1.2° of the sky. is an asteroid and near-Earth object approximately in diameter. Another, larger near-Earth asteroid, 2004 FH passed just two weeks prior to . is a near-Earth asteroid estimated to be roughly in diameter. It remained the asteroid with the smallest known semi-major axis for five years until the discovery of (0.683 AU), which was the first asteroid discovered closer to the Sun than Venus. Due to its eccentric orbit, is also a Mars-crosser, crossing the orbit of the Red Planet at 1.66 AU. == 2016 discovery == It was first observed by the Mount Lemmon Survey on 28 February 2016, when the asteroid was about from Earth and had a solar elongation of 174°. By early February 2021 the asteroid was brighter than apparent magnitude 24, which still placed it near the limiting magnitude of even the best automated astronomical surveys. With an exceptionally high eccentricity of 0.59, it was the most eccentric Aten asteroid known at the time of discovery, more eccentric than previously discovered Aten, 3753 Cruithne. The formerly poorly known trajectory of this asteroid was further complicated by close approaches to Venus and Mercury. It was not until (0.277 AU) was discovered that an Aten asteroid with a lower perihelion was found. 's eccentric orbit takes it out past the Earth, where it has encounters of about 0.15 to 0.20 AU about every 3 to 5 years around October–November. While listed on the Sentry Risk Table, virtual clones of the asteroid that fit the uncertainty in the known trajectory showed 116 potential impacts between 2054 and 2109. On 26 March 2010, it may have come within 0.0825 AU (12.3 million km) of Earth, but with an uncertainty parameter of 9, the orbit is poorly determined. It was the eighth Aten asteroid discovered. The combination of a small semi- major axis and high eccentricity made the first Aten asteroid discovered to get closer to the Sun (0.295 AU) than Mercury ever does. 2340 Hathor (the second Aten discovered, in 1976) had the smallest perihelion (0.464 AU) earlier, which was about the same distance as Mercury's aphelion (0.467 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.40 and an inclination of 7° with respect to the ecliptic.\n\n2\n\n-7.5\n\n2.74\n\n0.0384\n\n1.60\n\nE\n\nThe huge advantage of using the conservation of energy instead of Newton's laws of motion is that we can jump from the initial state to the final state without considering all the intermediate motion. Here is an example. In Figure, a child of mass $m$ is released from rest at the top of a water slide, at height $h=8.5 \\mathrm{~m}$ above the bottom of the slide. Assuming that the slide is frictionless because of the water on it, find the child's speed at the bottom of the slide.\n\nThe principle represents an accurate statement of the approximate conservation of kinetic energy in situations where there is no friction. Classically, conservation of energy was distinct from conservation of mass. The concept of mass conservation is widely used in many fields such as chemistry, mechanics, and fluid dynamics. The kinetic energy, as determined by the velocity, is converted to potential energy as it reaches the same height as the initial ball and the cycle repeats. thumb|An idealized Newton's cradle with five balls when there are no energy losses and there is always a small separation between the balls, except for when a pair is colliding thumb|Newton's cradle three-ball swing in a five-ball system. Academics such as John Playfair were quick to point out that kinetic energy is clearly not conserved. Many physicists at that time, such as Newton, held that the conservation of momentum, which holds even in systems with friction, as defined by the momentum: :\\sum_{i} m_i v_i was the conserved vis viva. All enforce the conservation of energy and momentum. The caloric theory maintained that heat could neither be created nor destroyed, whereas conservation of energy entails the contrary principle that heat and mechanical work are interchangeable. Thus, conservation of energy (total, including material or rest energy) and conservation of mass (total, not just rest) are one (equivalent) law. The Newton's cradle is a device that demonstrates the conservation of momentum and the conservation of energy with swinging spheres. He showed that the gravitational potential energy lost by the weight in descending was equal to the internal energy gained by the water through friction with the paddle. Energy conservation has been a foundational physical principle for about two hundred years. For systems that include large gravitational fields, general relativity has to be taken into account; thus mass–energy conservation becomes a more complex concept, subject to different definitions, and neither mass nor energy is as strictly and simply conserved as is the case in special relativity. == Formulation and examples == The law of conservation of mass can only be formulated in classical mechanics, in which the energy scales associated with an isolated system are much smaller than mc^2, where m is the mass of a typical object in the system, measured in the frame of reference where the object is at rest, and c is the speed of light. Given the stationary- action principle, conservation of energy can be rigorously proven by Noether's theorem as a consequence of continuous time translation symmetry; that is, from the fact that the laws of physics do not change over time. Some say that this behavior demonstrates the conservation of momentum and kinetic energy in elastic collisions. ===Mechanical equivalent of heat=== A key stage in the development of the modern conservation principle was the demonstration of the mechanical equivalent of heat. A consequence of the law of conservation of energy is that a perpetual motion machine of the first kind cannot exist; that is to say, no system without an external energy supply can deliver an unlimited amount of energy to its surroundings.Planck, M. (1923/1927). The law of conservation of mass and the analogous law of conservation of energy were finally generalized and unified into the principle of mass–energy equivalence, described by Albert Einstein's famous formula E = mc^2. The energy conservation law is a consequence of the shift symmetry of time; energy conservation is implied by the empirical fact that the laws of physics do not change with time itself. Engineers such as John Smeaton, Peter Ewart, , Gustave-Adolphe Hirn, and Marc Seguin recognized that conservation of momentum alone was not adequate for practical calculation and made use of Leibniz's principle. In physics and chemistry, the law of conservation of mass or principle of mass conservation states that for any system closed to all transfers of matter and energy, the mass of the system must remain constant over time, as the system's mass cannot change, so the quantity can neither be added nor be removed. In reality, the conservation of mass only holds approximately and is considered part of a series of assumptions in classical mechanics.\n\n0.011\n\n13\n\n8.8\n\n4.979\n\n0.132\n\nB\n\nFind the effective annual yield of a bank account that pays interest at a rate of 7%, compounded daily; that is, divide the difference between the final and initial balances by the initial balance.\n\n* If one has $1000 invested for 1 year at a 7-day SEC yield of 2%, then: :(0.02 × $1000 ) / 365 ~= $0.05479 per day. * If one has $1000 invested for 30 days at a 7-day SEC yield of 5%, then: :(0.05 × $1000 ) / 365 ~= $0.137 per day. The total compound interest generated is the final value minus the initial principal: I=P\\left(1+\\frac{r}{n}\\right)^{nt}-P ====Example 1==== Suppose a principal amount of $1,500 is deposited in a bank paying an annual interest rate of 4.3%, compounded quarterly. :Multiply by 365/7 to give the 7-day SEC yield. It is also referred to as the 7-day Annualized Yield. The calculation is performed as follows: :Take the net interest income earned by the fund over the last 7 days and subtract 7 days of management fees. It is important to note that the 7-day SEC yield is only an estimate of the fund's actual yield, and may not necessarily reflect the yield that an investor would receive if they held the fund for a longer period of time. ==Examples== The examples assume interest is withdrawn as it is earned and not allowed to compound. To calculate approximately how much interest one might earn in a money fund account, take the 7-day SEC yield, multiply by the amount invested, divide by the number of days in the year, and then multiply by the number of days in question. The amount of interest received can be calculated by subtracting the principal from this amount. 1921.24-1500=421.24 The interest is less compared with the previous case, as a result of the lower compounding frequency. ===Accumulation function=== Since the principal P is simply a coefficient, it is often dropped for simplicity, and the resulting accumulation function is used instead. Multiply by 30 days to yield $4.11 in interest. *For instance, if you were to invest $100 with compounding interest at a rate of 9% per annum, the rule of 72 gives 72/9 = 8 years required for the investment to be worth $200; an exact calculation gives ln(2)/ln(1+0.09) = 8.0432 years. The Summa de arithmetica of Luca Pacioli (1494) gives the Rule of 72, stating that to find the number of years for an investment at compound interest to double, one should divide the interest rate into 72. Subtracting the original principal from this amount gives the amount of interest received: 1938.84-1500=438.84 ====Example 2==== Suppose the same amount of $1,500 is compounded biennially (every 2 years). The E-M rule could thus be written also as : t \\approx \\frac{70}{r} \\times \\frac{198}{200-r} or t \\approx \\frac{72}{r} \\times \\frac{192}{200-r} In these variants, the multiplicative correction becomes 1 respectively for r=2 and r=8, the values for which the rules of 70 and 72 are most accurate. ===Padé approximant=== The third-order Padé approximant gives a more accurate answer over an even larger range of r, but it has a slightly more complicated formula: : t \\approx \\frac{69.3}{r} \\times \\frac{600+4r}{600+r} which simplifies to: : t \\approx \\frac{207900+1386r}{3000r+5r^2} ==Derivation== ===Periodic compounding === For periodic compounding, future value is given by: :FV = PV \\cdot (1+r)^t where PV is the present value, t is the number of time periods, and r stands for the interest rate per time period. :Divide that dollar amount by the average size of the fund's investments over the same 7 days. When interest is continuously compounded, use \\delta=n\\ln{\\left(1+\\frac{r}{n}\\right)}, where \\delta is the interest rate on a continuous compounding basis, and r is the stated interest rate with a compounding frequency n. ===Monthly amortized loan or mortgage payments=== The interest on loans and mortgages that are amortized—that is, have a smooth monthly payment until the loan has been paid off—is often compounded monthly. As another example, if one wants to know the number of periods it takes for the initial value to rise by 50%, replace the constant 2 with 1.5. == Using the rule to estimate compounding periods == To estimate the number of periods required to double an original investment, divide the most convenient \"rule-quantity\" by the expected growth rate, expressed as a percentage. Similarly, replacing the \"R\" in R/200 on the third line with 2.02 gives 70 on the numerator, showing the rule of 70 is most accurate for periodically compounded interests around 2%. Then the balance after 6 years is found by using the formula above, with P = 1500, r = 0.043 (4.3%), n = 1/2 (the interest is compounded every two years), and t = 6 : A=1500\\times(1+(0.043\\times 2))^{\\frac{6}{2}}\\approx 1921.24 So, the balance after 6 years is approximately $1,921.24. The effective annual rate is the total accumulated interest that would be payable up to the end of one year, divided by the principal sum. The 7-day SEC Yield is a measure of performance in the interest rates of money market mutual funds offered by US mutual fund companies. The function f(r) is shown to be accurate in the approximation of t for a small, positive interest rate when r=.08 (see derivation below). f(.08)\\approx1.03949, and we therefore approximate time t as: : t=\\bigg(\\frac{\\ln2}{r}\\bigg)f(.08) \\approx \\frac{.72}{r} Written as a percentage: : \\frac{.72}{r}=\\frac{72}{100r} This approximation increases in accuracy as the compounding of interest becomes continuous (see derivation below). 100 r is r written as a percentage.\n\n1.41\n\n7.0\n\n'-2.0'\n\n0.5\n\n7.25\n\nE\n\nConsider a tank used in certain hydrodynamic experiments. After one experiment the tank contains $200 \\mathrm{~L}$ of a dye solution with a concentration of $1 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{L}$. To prepare for the next experiment, the tank is to be rinsed with fresh water flowing in at a rate of $2 \\mathrm{~L} / \\mathrm{min}$, the well-stirred solution flowing out at the same rate. Find the time that will elapse before the concentration of dye in the tank reaches $1 \\%$ of its original value.\n\nInstead, residence time models developed for gas and fluid dynamics, chemical engineering, and bio-hydrodynamics can be adapted to generate residence times for sub-volumes of lakes. == Renewal time == One useful mathematical model the measurement of how quickly inflows are able to refill a lake. 500px|right|thumb|The lake retention time for a body of water with the volume and the exit flow of is 20 hours. If one adds 1 litre of water to this solution, the salt concentration is reduced. Renewal time simply becomes a question how quickly could the inflows of the lake fill the entire volume of the basin (this does still assume the outflows are unchanged). Time of concentration is a concept used in hydrology to measure the response of a watershed to a rain event. It roughly expresses the amount of time taken for a substance introduced into a lake to flow out of it again. This can be important for infrastructure development (design of bridges, culverts, etc.) and management, as well as to assess flood risk such as the ARkStorm-scenario. ==Example== thumb|left|400px|NOAA diagram illustrating the concept underlying time of concentration This image shows the basic principle which leads to determination of the time of concentration. thumb|Time lapse video of diffusion of a dye dissolved in water into a gel. thumb|Three-dimensional rendering of diffusion of purple dye in water. A number of methods can be used to calculate time of concentration, including the Kirpich (1940) and NRCS (1997) methods.

The retention time is particularly important where downstream flooding or pollutants are concerned. ==Global retention time== The global retention time for a lake (the overall mean time that water spends in the lake) is calculated by dividing the lake volume by either the mean rate of inflow of all tributaries, or by the mean rate of outflow (ideally including evaporation and seepage). Mathematically this relationship can be shown by equation: c_1 V_1 = c_2 V_2 where *c1 = initial concentration or molarity *V1 = initial volume *c2 = final concentration or molarity *V2 = final volume .... ==Basic room purge equation== The basic room purge equation is used in industrial hygiene. The mean free time for a molecule in a fluid is the average time between collisions. Time of concentration is useful in predicting flow rates that would result from hypothetical storms, which are based on statistically derived return periods through IDF curves.Sherman, C. (1931): Frequency and intensity of excessive rainfall at Boston, Massachusetts, Transactions, American Society of Civil Engineers, 95, 951–960. (pdf) For many (often economic) reasons, it is important for engineers and hydrologists to be able to accurately predict the response of a watershed to a given rain event. The concentration of this admixture should be small and the gradient of this concentration should be also small. Lake retention time (also called the residence time of lake water, or the water age or flushing time) is a calculated quantity expressing the mean time that water (or some dissolved substance) spends in a particular lake. In the following test tubes, the blue dye is dissolved in a lower concentration (and at the same time in a smaller amount, since the volume is approximately the same). upright=1.35|thumb|Diluting a solution by adding more solvent Dilution is the process of decreasing the concentration of a solute in a solution, usually simply by mixing with more solvent like adding more water to the solution. In a scenario where a liquid continuously evaporates from a container in a ventilated room, a differential equation has to be used: \\frac{dC}{dt} = \\frac{G - Q' C}{V} where the ventilation rate has been adjusted by a mixing factor K: Q' = \\frac{Q}{K} *C = concentration of a gas *G = generation rate *V = room volume *Q′ = adjusted ventilation rate of the volume ==Welding== The dilution in welding terms is defined as the weight of the base metal melted divided by the total weight of the weld metal. The solutions on the left are more dilute, compared to the more concentrated solutions on the right. The equation can only be applied when the purged volume of vapor or gas is replaced with \"clean\" air or gas.

Find the value of the damping coefficient $\\gamma$ for which the quasi period of the damped motion is $50 \\%$ greater than the period of the corresponding undamped motion.\n\nFor a damped harmonic oscillator with mass m, damping coefficient c, and spring constant k, it can be defined as the ratio of the damping coefficient in the system's differential equation to the critical damping coefficient: : \\zeta = \\frac{c}{c_c} = \\frac {\\text{actual damping}} {\\text{critical damping}}, where the system's equation of motion is : m\\frac{d^2x}{dt^2} + c\\frac{dx}{dt} + kx = 0 and the corresponding critical damping coefficient is : c_c = 2 \\sqrt{k m} or : c_c = 2 m \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}} = 2m \\omega_n where : \\omega_n = \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}} is the natural frequency of the system. The damping ratio is a system parameter, denoted by (zeta), that can vary from undamped (), underdamped () through critically damped () to overdamped (). The damping ratio is a parameter, usually denoted by ζ (Greek letter zeta), that characterizes the frequency response of a second-order ordinary differential equation. Damping is an influence within or upon an oscillatory system that has the effect of reducing or preventing its oscillation. The general equation for an exponentially damped sinusoid may be represented as: y(t) = A e^{-\\lambda t} \\cos(\\omega t - \\varphi) where: *y(t) is the instantaneous amplitude at time ; *A is the initial amplitude of the envelope; *\\lambda is the decay rate, in the reciprocal of the time units of the independent variable ; *\\varphi is the phase angle at ; *\\omega is the angular frequency. The damping ratio is dimensionless, being the ratio of two coefficients of identical units. == Derivation == Using the natural frequency of a harmonic oscillator \\omega_n = \\sqrt{{k}/{m}} and the definition of the damping ratio above, we can rewrite this as: : \\frac{d^2x}{dt^2} + 2\\zeta\\omega_n\\frac{dx}{dt} + \\omega_n^2 x = 0. The key difference between critical damping and overdamping is that, in critical damping, the system returns to equilibrium in the minimum amount of time. ==Damped sine wave== thumb|350px|Plot of a damped sinusoidal wave represented as the function y(t) = e^{- t} \\cos(2 \\pi t) A damped sine wave or damped sinusoid is a sinusoidal function whose amplitude approaches zero as time increases. * Between the overdamped and underdamped cases, there exists a certain level of damping at which the system will just fail to overshoot and will not make a single oscillation. The damping ratio is a measure describing how rapidly the oscillations decay from one bounce to the next. The damping ratio provides a mathematical means of expressing the level of damping in a system relative to critical damping. If the system has n degrees of freedom un and is under application of m damping forces. * Q factor: Q = 1 / (2 \\zeta) is another non-dimensional characterization of the amount of damping; high Q indicates slow damping relative to the oscillation. == Damping ratio definition == thumb|400px|upright=1.3|The effect of varying damping ratio on a second-order system. This turns out to be a desirable outcome in many cases where engineering design of a damped oscillator is required (e.g., a door closing mechanism). == Q factor and decay rate == The Q factor, damping ratio ζ, and exponential decay rate α are related such that : \\zeta = \\frac{1}{2 Q} = { \\alpha \\over \\omega_n }. Two such solutions, for the two values of s satisfying the equation, can be combined to make the general real solutions, with oscillatory and decaying properties in several regimes: thumb|Phase portrait of damped oscillator, with increasing damping strength. *Damped harmonic motion, see animation (right). The equation of motion is \\ddot x + 2\\gamma \\dot x + \\omega^2 x = 0. A lower damping ratio implies a lower decay rate, and so very underdamped systems oscillate for long times. It corresponds to the underdamped case of damped second-order systems, or underdamped second-order differential equations.Douglas C. Giancoli (2000). Critically damped systems have a damping ratio of exactly 1, or at least very close to it. In physical systems, damping is produced by processes that dissipate the energy stored in the oscillation. The damping ratio is a dimensionless measure describing how oscillations in a system decay after a disturbance. Low damping materials may be utilized in musical instruments where sustained mechanical vibration and acoustic wave propagation is desired.\n\n0.08\n\n0.249\n\n11.0\n\n1.4907\n\n2.72\n\nD\n\nFind the value of $y_0$ for which the solution of the initial value problem $$ y^{\\prime}-y=1+3 \\sin t, \\quad y(0)=y_0 $$ remains finite as $t \\rightarrow \\infty$\n\nA solution to an initial value problem is a function y that is a solution to the differential equation and satisfies :y(t_0) = y_0. Indeed, rather than being unique, this equation has three solutions:, p. 7 :y(t) = 0, \\qquad y(t) = \\pm\\left (\\tfrac23 t\\right)^{\\frac{3}{2}}. ;Second example The solution of : y'+3y=6t+5,\\qquad y(0)=3 can be found to be : y(t)=2e^{-3t}+2t+1. Evidently, the functions are computing the Taylor series expansion of our known solution y=\\tan(t). Since the equation being studied is a first-order equation, the initial conditions are the initial x and y values. Beginning with another initial condition , the solution y(t) tends toward the stationary point, but reaches it only at the limit of infinite time, so the uniqueness of solutions (over all finite times) is guaranteed. Then, there exists some such that the initial value problem y'(t)=f(t,y(t)),\\qquad y(t_0)=y_0. has a unique solution y(t) on the interval [t_0-\\varepsilon, t_0+\\varepsilon]., Theorem I.3.1 == Proof sketch == The proof relies on transforming the differential equation, and applying the Banach fixed-point theorem. See Newton's method of successive approximation for instruction. == Example of Picard iteration == thumb|Four Picard iteration steps and their limit Let y(t)=\\tan(t), the solution to the equation y'(t)=1+y(t)^2 with initial condition y(t_0)=y_0=0,t_0=0. We are trying to find a formula for y(t) that satisfies these two equations. Rearrange the equation so that y is on the left hand side : \\frac{y'(t)}{y(t)} = 0.85 Now integrate both sides with respect to t (this introduces an unknown constant B). : \\int \\frac{y'(t)}{y(t)}\\,dt = \\int 0.85\\,dt : \\ln |y(t)| = 0.85t + B Eliminate the logarithm with exponentiation on both sides : | y(t) | = e^Be^{0.85t} Let C be a new unknown constant, C = \\pm e^B, so : y(t) = Ce^{0.85t} Now we need to find a value for C. Use y(0) = 19 as given at the start and substitute 0 for t and 19 for y : 19 = C e^{0.85 \\cdot 0} : C = 19 this gives the final solution of y(t) = 19e^{0.85t}. Initial value problems are extended to higher orders by treating the derivatives in the same way as an independent function, e.g. y(t)=f(t,y(t),y'(t)). == Existence and uniqueness of solutions == The Picard–Lindelöf theorem guarantees a unique solution on some interval containing t0 if f is continuous on a region containing t0 and y0 and satisfies the Lipschitz condition on the variable y. right|thumb|390px|Solutions to the differential equation \\frac{dy}{dx} = \\frac{1}{2y} subject to the initial conditions y(0)=0, 1 and 2 (red, green and blue curves respectively). Another solution is given by : y_s(x) = 0 . In multivariable calculus, an initial value problem (IVP) is an ordinary differential equation together with an initial condition which specifies the value of the unknown function at a given point in the domain. \\, Indeed, : \\begin{align} y'+3y &= \\tfrac{d}{dt} (2e^{-3t}+2t+1)+3(2e^{-3t}+2t+1) \\\\\\ &= (-6e^{-3t}+2)+(6e^{-3t}+6t+3) \\\\\\ &= 6t+5. \\end{align} ==Notes== ==See also== * Boundary value problem * Constant of integration * Integral curve == References == * * * * * * Category:Boundary conditions el:Αρχική τιμή it:Problema ai valori iniziali sv:Begynnelsevärdesproblem In mathematics, specifically the study of differential equations, the Picard–Lindelöf theorem gives a set of conditions under which an initial value problem has a unique solution. This happens for example for the equation , which has at least two solutions corresponding to the initial condition such as: or :y(t)=\\begin{cases} \\left (\\tfrac{at}{3} \\right )^{3} & t<0\\\\\\ \\ \\ \\ \\ 0 & t \\ge 0, \\end{cases} so the previous state of the system is not uniquely determined by its state after t = 0. By considering the two sets of solutions above, one can see that the solution fails to be unique when y=0. By integrating both sides, any function satisfying the differential equation must also satisfy the integral equation :y(t) - y(t_0) = \\int_{t_0}^t f(s,y(s)) \\, ds. Starting with \\varphi_0(t)=0, we iterate :\\varphi_{k+1}(t)=\\int_0^t (1+(\\varphi_k(s))^2)\\,ds so that \\varphi_n(t) \\to y(t): :\\varphi_1(t)=\\int_0^t (1+0^2)\\,ds = t :\\varphi_2(t)=\\int_0^t (1+s^2)\\,ds = t + \\frac{t^3}{3} :\\varphi_3(t)=\\int_0^t \\left(1+\\left(s + \\frac{s^3}{3}\\right)^2\\right)\\,ds = t + \\frac{t^3}{3} + \\frac{2t^5}{15} + \\frac{t^7}{63} and so on.

Determine $T$ if $r=7 \\%$.\n\nThe function f(r) is shown to be accurate in the approximation of t for a small, positive interest rate when r=.08 (see derivation below). f(.08)\\approx1.03949, and we therefore approximate time t as: : t=\\bigg(\\frac{\\ln2}{r}\\bigg)f(.08) \\approx \\frac{.72}{r} Written as a percentage: : \\frac{.72}{r}=\\frac{72}{100r} This approximation increases in accuracy as the compounding of interest becomes continuous (see derivation below). 100 r is r written as a percentage. *For instance, if you were to invest $100 with compounding interest at a rate of 9% per annum, the rule of 72 gives 72/9 = 8 years required for the investment to be worth $200; an exact calculation gives ln(2)/ln(1+0.09) = 8.0432 years. The total compound interest generated is the final value minus the initial principal: I=P\\left(1+\\frac{r}{n}\\right)^{nt}-P ====Example 1==== Suppose a principal amount of $1,500 is deposited in a bank paying an annual interest rate of 4.3%, compounded quarterly. The E-M rule could thus be written also as : t \\approx \\frac{70}{r} \\times \\frac{198}{200-r} or t \\approx \\frac{72}{r} \\times \\frac{192}{200-r} In these variants, the multiplicative correction becomes 1 respectively for r=2 and r=8, the values for which the rules of 70 and 72 are most accurate. ===Padé approximant=== The third-order Padé approximant gives a more accurate answer over an even larger range of r, but it has a slightly more complicated formula: : t \\approx \\frac{69.3}{r} \\times \\frac{600+4r}{600+r} which simplifies to: : t \\approx \\frac{207900+1386r}{3000r+5r^2} ==Derivation== ===Periodic compounding === For periodic compounding, future value is given by: :FV = PV \\cdot (1+r)^t where PV is the present value, t is the number of time periods, and r stands for the interest rate per time period. Similarly, replacing the \"R\" in R/200 on the third line with 2.02 gives 70 on the numerator, showing the rule of 70 is most accurate for periodically compounded interests around 2%. * P = principal deposit * r = rate of return (monthly) * M = monthly deposit, and * t = time, in months The compound interest for each deposit is: M'=M(1+r)^{t} and adding all recurring deposits over the total period t (i starts at 0 if deposits begin with the investment of principal; i starts at 1 if deposits begin the next month) : M'=\\sum^{t-1}_{i=0}{M(1+r)^{t-i}} recognizing the geometric series: M'=M\\sum^{t-1}_{i=0}(1+r)^{t}\\frac{1}{(1+r)^{i}} and applying the closed-form formula (common ratio :1/(1+r)) we obtain: P' = M\\frac{(1+r)^{t}-1}{r}+P(1+r)^t If two or more types of deposits occur (either recurring or non-recurring), the compound value earned can be represented as \\text{Value}=M\\frac{(1+r)^{t}-1}{r}+P(1+r)^t+k\\frac{(1+r)^{t-x}-1}{r}+C(1+r)^{t-y} where C is each lump sum and k are non-monthly recurring deposits, respectively, and x and y are the differences in time between a new deposit and the total period t is modeling. Then the balance after 6 years is found by using the formula above, with P = 1500, r = 0.043 (4.3%), n = 1/2 (the interest is compounded every two years), and t = 6 : A=1500\\times(1+(0.043\\times 2))^{\\frac{6}{2}}\\approx 1921.24 So, the balance after 6 years is approximately $1,921.24. The amount after t periods of continuous compounding can be expressed in terms of the initial amount P0 as P(t)=P_0 e ^ {rt}. ===Force of interest=== As the number of compounding periods n tends to infinity in continuous compounding, the continuous compound interest rate is referred to as the force of interest \\delta. Let RSt be the simple rate of return on the security from t − 1 to t. Accumulation functions for simple and compound interest are a(t)=1 + r t a(t) = \\left(1 + \\frac {r} {n}\\right) ^ {nt} If n t = 1, then these two functions are the same. ===Continuous compounding=== As n, the number of compounding periods per year, increases without limit, the case is known as continuous compounding, in which case the effective annual rate approaches an upper limit of , where is a mathematical constant that is the base of the natural logarithm. Then the balance after 6 years is found by using the formula above, with P = 1500, r = 0.043 (4.3%), n = 4, and t = 6: A=1500\\times\\left(1+\\frac{0.043}{4}\\right)^{4\\times 6}\\approx 1938.84 So the amount A after 6 years is approximately $1,938.84. Subtracting the original principal from this amount gives the amount of interest received: 1938.84-1500=438.84 ====Example 2==== Suppose the same amount of $1,500 is compounded biennially (every 2 years). The continuously compounded rate of return or instantaneous rate of return RCt obtained during that period is : RC_{t}=\\ln\\left (\\frac{P_{t}}{P_{t-1}}\\right ). For continuous compounding, 69 gives accurate results for any rate, since ln(2) is about 69.3%; see derivation below. A practical estimate for reverse calculation of the rate of return when the exact date and amount of each recurring deposit is not known, a formula that assumes a uniform recurring monthly deposit over the period, is:http://moneychimp.com/features/portfolio_performance_calculator.htm \"recommended by The Four Pillars of Investing and The Motley Fool\" r=\\left(\\frac{P'-P-\\sum{M}}{P+\\sum{M}/2}\\right)^{1/t} or r=\\left(\\frac{P'-\\sum{M}/2}{P+\\sum{M}/2}\\right)^{1/t}-1 ==See also== * Credit card interest * Exponential growth * Fisher equation * Interest * Interest rate * Rate of return * Rate of return on investment * Real versus nominal value (economics) * Yield curve ==References== Category:Interest Category:Exponentials Category:Mathematical finance Category:Actuarial science it:Anatocismo When interest is continuously compounded, use \\delta=n\\ln{\\left(1+\\frac{r}{n}\\right)}, where \\delta is the interest rate on a continuous compounding basis, and r is the stated interest rate with a compounding frequency n. ===Monthly amortized loan or mortgage payments=== The interest on loans and mortgages that are amortized—that is, have a smooth monthly payment until the loan has been paid off—is often compounded monthly. * A rate of 1% per month is equivalent to a simple annual interest rate (nominal rate) of 12%, but allowing for the effect of compounding, the annual equivalent compound rate is 12.68% per annum (1.0112 − 1). As another example, if one wants to know the number of periods it takes for the initial value to rise by 50%, replace the constant 2 with 1.5. == Using the rule to estimate compounding periods == To estimate the number of periods required to double an original investment, divide the most convenient \"rule-quantity\" by the expected growth rate, expressed as a percentage. Compound interest is standard in finance and economics. For every three percentage points away from 8%, the value of 72 could be adjusted by 1: : t \\approx \\frac{72 + (r - 8)/3}{r} or, for the same result: : t \\approx \\frac{70 + (r - 2)/3}{r} Both of these equations simplify to: : t \\approx \\frac{208}{3r} + \\frac{1}{3} Note that \\frac{208}{3} is quite close to 69.3. ===E-M rule=== The Eckart–McHale second- order rule (the E-M rule) provides a multiplicative correction for the rule of 69.3 that is very accurate for rates from 0% to 20%, whereas the rule is normally only accurate at the lowest end of interest rates, from 0% to about 5%. Thus, continuing the above nominal example, the final value of the investment expressed in real terms is :P_t^{real} = P_t \\cdot \\frac{PL_{t-1}}{PL_t}. For periodic compounding, the exact doubling time for an interest rate of r percent per period is :t = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{\\ln(1+r/100)}\\approx \\frac{72}{r}, where t is the number of periods required.\n\n0.00024\n\n1.5377\n\n0.2115\n\n9.90\n\n52\n\nD\n\nA mass weighing $2 \\mathrm{lb}$ stretches a spring 6 in.
