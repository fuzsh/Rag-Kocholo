        "text": "Tomorrow Never Dies (1997)\n\nThe Cast: Pierce Brosnan (James Bond); Michelle Yeoh (Wai Lin); Jonathan Pryce (Elliot Carver); Teri Hatcher (Paris Carver); Gotz Otto (Stamper); Joe Don Baker (Jack Wade)\n\nThe Supporting Cast: Judy Dench (“M”); Desmond Llewelyn (“Q”); Samantha Bond (Moneypenny); Ricky Jay (Gupta); Geoffrey Palmer (Admiral Roebuck); Colin Samson (Robinson); Cecile Thomasen (Professor Ingstrom); Tamara Kelly (Nina Young) Vincent Schiavelli (Dr. Kaufman)\n\nCredits: Produced by Barbara Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson; Directed by Roger Spottiswoode; Story by Bruce Fierstein and Daniel Petrie; Music by David Arnold; Title Song performed by Sheryl Crow; Titles by Daniel Kleinmann;Edited by Dominique Fortin and Michael Arcand\n\nReview by: Cavan Scott\n\nThere can be no doubt about it. Bond is back and his name is Pierce Brosnan. The risk with the follow-up to GoldenEye was whether another Bond film could survive without the novelty factor of Bond`s new persona. Would Brosnan still be able to keep the public on his side or would he prove the old cliche that familiarity breeds contempt?\n\nThankfully the man born to be Bond acquits himself exquisitely. Brosnan`s claim on the Walther, whether that is the PPK of old or the more contemporary P99, is secure. As it stands Tomorrow Never Dies, the eighteenth official 007 movie from EON productions, is truly a greatest hits collection for Commander Bond. The elements, so sorely missed by the audiences of Licence To Kill are all back in force. Bond is magnificently politically incorrect, although Brosnan has been able to add the human side that was desired in both Lazenby and Dalton. The key is that the task of making Bond more vulnerable does not mean that the baby must be thrown out with the bath-water.\n\nLike Dalton before him, we see Brosnan portraying a Bond racked with a desire for vengeance, but this time the agent never forgets who he is and what his role must be. To keep him from drowning in the sea of violence that crashes around him, Bond still remembers the power of a bad pun and the schoolboy sense of adventure that also manages to keep him alive.\n\nWhile the need for nostalgia which keeps the franchise alive is obviously present throughout his latest mission, Tomorrow Never Dies does break from the past in small ways. The much-maligned Jonathan Pryce simply does not deserve the criticism leveled against his portrayal of media baron Elliot Carver. It has been claimed that Carver fails to live up to the larger than life villains of yesteryear. The question must be asked whether this is such a bad thing. Carver does not command respect and loyalty by pure charisma, but a sinister mixture of corruption and avarice. His double-persona, one of a public figure striving for world media-domination and the other a puppet-master manipulating the public and governments alike to ensure total monopoly, is far more chilling that the mania of Drax or the psychopathic tendencies of Max Zorin. If ever there is an ogre for the nineties, it is the gently spoken man who hides his villainy behind rimless designer spectacles.\n\nCarver`s accomplices are unfortunately more of a mixed batch. Gupta, the techno-terrorist played by magician Ricky Jay is easily forgettable in the light of GoldenEye`s brilliant Boris and Stamper is yet another Red Grant clone. Thankfully, Vincent Schiavelli`s Dr Kaufman is a touch of pure genius and easily the best henchmen since the camp assassins Mr Kidd and Mr Wint of Diamonds Are Forever fame.\n\nWith other elements combining to provide the thrills we all expected Director Roger Sporriswoode provides us with the sensation of slipping into a pair of nuclear powered slippers, although his use of slow motion is unnecessary and ultimately jarring in the final action scenes. Dame Judy Dench once again takes on the mantle of M and this time the relationship between her and 007 is of full respect, with more understanding than has ever existed between Bond and his superior. Likewise, while Desmond Llwewlyn`s Q is obviously having even more difficulty with the new-fangled modern equipment that his department has to provide, the actor seems far more together than the embarrassment of the previous film. Whether, he can be brought back again has yet to be seen. The difficult job of replacing the franchise`s most loved character may be a even more awesome task than finding a new 007 himself.\n\nThe final icing on the cake is David Arnold`s score, which, like the film itself, takes much of its inspiration from the past. Those who become bored of the constant activity and outlandish stunts can play spot the John Barry theme as Arnold continually suggests, but never truly plagiarises, the master of the Bond score.\n\nOf course no film is perfect. The attempt to deglamorise Bond after the over-styled GoldenEye is misguided. Brosnan can quite easily perform stunts while wearing an immaculate three piece suit, complete with handkerchief, so there was no need to strip him from it this time round. Also, the media theme is surprisingly underused. Where is the juxtaposition of Carver`s televised narrative of the final shootout providing a sharp contrast to the events on the Stealth ship? This is truly a missed opportunity.\n\nAlso, while Bond is a trained killer, do we have to see him so dispassionate about the mass murder which he causes at every turn? This is the territory of Bruce Willis not the Queen`s finest secret agent.\n\nAs for the revolutionary leading lady, while there is no doubt that Michelle Yeoh is a fine actress who can handle the fight scenes as well as any stunt double, Chinese agent Wai Lin is hardly the break from the norm that was promised. Too similar to the character of Major Anya Amasova in The Spy Who Loved Me, Wai Lin is surely only this strong to prove how skillful our own agent actually is. She is the best, and therefore Bond must naturally be better.\n\nAside from this, Tomorrow Never Dies is exactly what a James Bond feature should be – Pure unadulterated escapism with lashes of explosive fantasy and one of the best cars since the Db5. There is one thing you can be sure of- James Bond will return.\n\nMission:Impossible-2 opened on Wednesday, May 24th, 2000 and already advanced word indicated that this film was more in line with James Bond than the first Mission: Impossible film, or even the television series. Swanbeck, Hunt’s new boss, replacing Jim Phelps who was killed in the last film, tells Hunt: “This isn’t Mission: Difficult. It’s Mission: Impossible. Difficult should be a walk in the park.” The rest of the cast and crew would do well to remember that. This is supposed to be Mission: Impossible, rather than James Bond. It’s one thing to be in line with 007 but it is something completely different when you go blatantly poaching in his territory. Here we’ll consider a few of the more obvious similarities between the two films. WARNING: SPOILERS AHEAD!\n\nTom Cruise is back as Ethan Hunt, and returning from the first film is Ving Rhames as Luther Stickell. Thandie Newton is on board as Nyah Hall, a cat burglar wanted in Europe and Asia for several high profile thefts. Dougray Scott is IMF Agent Sean Ambrose, and Anthony Hopkins debuts as the new head of IMF, Swanbeck.\n\nCruise is assigned to retrieve a stolen, but live sample of a deadly virus called Chimera and deal with the thief accordingly. Suspicion is focused on Sean Ambrose immediately, as he is the IMF agent who was assigned to protect the transfer of the virus from Sydney to Atlanta; that, and his body wasn’t found among the wreckage of the plane he was supposed to be flying in.\n\nHunt is told he can recruit any two agents he wants, but he must also recruit Nyah Hall, a wanted cat burglar. Hunt assumes he’s recruiting her for her thievery skills, and heads to Seville, Spain to catch her in the act. After a car chase, a jewelry heist and some lovemaking, Hunt realizes that he’s fallen in love with her. He later meets with Swanbeck to discuss the operation and is surprised to find out that Nyah was once Sean’s lover. What’s worse, Swanbeck wants Hunt to convince Hall to resume her old relationship with Ambrose in order to find out what Ambrose is going to do with the virus, and that may mean getting back into bed with him. Hunt reluctantly agrees to the plan, and sets off for Sydney to initiate the strategy to be employed against Ambrose.\n\nTom Cruise is actually the weak link in this film. There’s never been much exploration of the Ethan Hunt character, and Cruise has seemed more interested in getting by on charm, looks, physique and pyrotechnics than anything else. Make no mistake, this is a Tom Cruise film, and as such, he essentially jettisons the team concept that worked so well in the television series so that the film can instead focus on his long flowing mane, perfect smile and ever widening crooked nose. Cruise and his co-partner, Paula Wagner, have never shown the slightest interest in adhering to even the basic premise of the original television series, which is why they can so easily justify killing off all the IMF agents within the first 30 minutes of the first film, or having Jim Phelps turn out to be a vicious killer.\n\nThandie Newton is the real find in this film. When she and Cruise are acting together, the film gets a sudden lift, and it can’t be denied, despite the films other faults that there is some chemistry between the two. Dougray Scott is capable but mostly forgettable in an underdeveloped role. The films climax takes Hunt on a motorcycle chase on a privately owned island to a cliff top hand to hand combat showdown with Ambrose. The fight sequence goes on way too long, is too bloody and too bone-crunchingly graphic for a PG-13 film. The action, when there is any of it, is almost too stylish. You feel as though you are watching a ballet with sub machine guns than a straight up action film. This isn’t necessarily a bad thing, but Woo seems to have trouble in this film knowing when to pull back. Overall, the film is definitely an improvement over the first one, but then again, it has had some help from Mr. Bond himself. It’s also worth noting that the first Mission: Impossible film had a discarded scene originally designed to be used in the pre-credits sequence of Goldeneye: the high-speed monorail/helicopter chase.\n\nTREVELYAN VS. AMBROSE\n\nUnlike Alec Trevelyan, played by Sean Bean, we know from the start who the villain in M:I-2 is going to be. Early on, Dougray Scott’s character, Sean Ambrose, is seen stealing the Chimera virus from a 747 bound for Atlanta. The plane is set on automatic pilot; a plan designed to smash it into The Rocky Mountains, in order to cover up the theft of the virus. In Goldeneye, Xenia and Orumov set the satellite to destroy the Severnaya facility in order to cover up the theft of the Goldeneye weapon system.\n\nThe M:I-2 writer inserts some background into the script that insinuates Ethan has had his doubts about Ambrose long before now, but ultimately that comes across as pointless. It is worth noting that both Trevelyan and Ambrose are turncoat agents, betraying MI6 and the IMF respectively. To add insult to intrigue, Dougray Scott was born in Scotland while Sean Bean was born in England.\n\nThe writers of both films create a rivalry between hero and villain, and in both cases, a woman gets involved. Trevelyan mocks Bond as being MI6’s “loyal terrier” while Ambrose mocks Hunt’s ‘stupid grin’, a reference to Tom Cruise’s $20 million dollar smile. Alec can’t wait to get his lips on Natalya, telling Bond that she tastes like “strawberries”, while Hunt, who has fallen for Nyah, has no choice but to send her to Ambrose’s bed once again (Ambrose and Hall were once lovers). At one point Ambrose even holds Nyah hostage in front of Hunt just as Trevelyan had Natalya held hostage in front of Bond.\n\nYou can purchase the product of your choice, as both topical and oral solutions are popularly being used, but if you really want to have permanent effects.

However, in spite of these studies, like many others showing a lack of evidence for the lower sat-fat and lower cholesterol diet as the healthy option, they have been ignored. Goldeneye’s writers give Alec motivation for his villainy: Trevelyan wants to send London back to the Stone Age for her betrayal of his parents, who were Cossacks, during World War II. No such luck with M:I-2’s writers. Sean Ambrose is motivated primarily by nothing more complex than simple greed. He wants to create a need for a cure to the Chimera virus. He has the antidote. What he doesn’t have is an outbreak of the virus. To do that, he plans on infecting up to 17 million Australians, starting with 3 million in Sydney, before announcing that the biological firm he’s now 51% vested in, has the cure. Stocks that were bought for $30 million dollars before the outbreak suddenly become worth billions as demand for the cure skyrockets worldwide. This is all well and good if you’ve got an actor with a role he can sink his teeth into, but Ambrose is a rather forgettable character. Before both villains initiate doomsday, they transfer other people’s cash accounts, stocks and bonds via computer into their own. M:I-2 even has it’s own version of Boris, this time with a beard and wooly cap. (Advantage: Goldeneye)\n\nBOND/ONATOP VS. HUNT/HALL\n\nThe car chase that takes place in Monaco between Bond and Xenia in Goldeneye has been shamelessly lifted and transferred over to M:I-2, this time showcasing Ethan Hunt and Nyah Hall. In fact, this couldn’t be any more stolen from Goldeneye if Tom Cruise was racing Famke Janssen rather than Thandie Newton. Hunt won’t take no for an answer when Hall tells him she doesn’t want to work for him, so he chases after her car and the two engage in a bit of sexual chemistry by racing one another. Hunt and Hall must not only out perform each other, but must also dodge other assorted vehicles that come into their path. At one point Hall’s car goes into a tailspin exactly as Xenia’s did in Goldeneye. But in the end, the copy is never as good as the real thing and Goldeneye’s chase is simply better by virtue of being the first and having Famke Janssen. In fairness, M:I-2’s chase isn’t all that bad either, but is marred towards the end by John Woo’s overuse of slow motion photography and fetish for seeing Cruise and Newton’s hair fly in the wind. (Advantage: Goldeneye)\n\nM/SWANBECK\n\nBond`s boss is referred to as “M”. Over the years he/she has given Bond his assignements, but never taken part in them. Conversely, throughout virtually every episode of both Mission:Impossible series on television and the first film, the team leader of the IMF, Jim Phelps, has been involved in the action and in the danger. Yet in M:I-2, the new boss of IMF, Swanbeck, inexplicably stays on the sideline more like “M” than Jim Phelps. Anthony Hopkins was even approached to play a more mature, mentor-like version of Alec Trevelyan in Goldeneye, a role which he turned down and was eventually played by Sean Bean. He was then offered the role of Elliot Carver in Tomorrow Never Dies and turned it down.\n\nTHE CLIMAX\n\nGoldeneye ends with Bond and Natalya infiltrating the island of Cuba, destroying Trevelyan’s satellite dish, and killing him off. M:I-2 ends with Hunt infiltrating a small, private island where Ambrose is holed up plotting his reign of terror. Ambrose and his computer hacker Wallis, played by William Mapother (Tom Cruise’s cousin in real life) begin the process of fattening Ambrose’s bank account. Hunt manages to break in and obliterate the place by blowing up tanks filled with volatile fuels and gases. In Goldeneye, Bond blows up liquid nitrogen tanks. In MI-2, Hunt at first tries to escape the island by jumping onto the skid of Luther`s helicopter. In Goldeneye, Bond escapes the imploding dish by jumping onto the skid of a helicopter. (Advantage: draw)\n\nWHAT MI-2 GETS RIGHT\n\nMGM would do well to look at John Woo’s work and consider him for future directing duties. After all, he did sign a three-picture production deal with the studio earlier this year. He brings a lot to the table that other directors simply can’t match. Does he overuse some of the “Matrix” style stuntwork? Yes. Does he employ slow motion technique too often in this film? Yes. But I’d rather have too much than too little and there are moments of genius in the film that he should be given full credit for. Does his style of filmmaking belong in a James Bond film? My first thought was no. A Bond film is too civilized for his way of directing, but then I realized that that is exactly the kind of trap we as fans have fallen into for so long. Maybe it wouldn’t hurt to have an ace action director like Woo come in and shake things up a bit.\n\nWhen Mission: Impossible-2 isn’t ripping off Goldeneye, it’s doing some Bondish things better than the actual Bond producers are. For example, MI-2 makes stunning use of Seville and Sydney. Parts of the Seville sequences were actually shot in Australia, but the work that went into creating the atmosphere that made you believe Hunt was in Spain is top notch. Australia is beautifully filmed, with everything from the Sydney Opera House to the Outback making its way into the film. By contrast, the last 3 Bond films have suffered not only from lack of exotic locations, but also from a sense of having even been there. With MI-2 we can see the actors actually in Sydney, with all its famous landmarks being used as backdrops. When was the last time Bond visited anyplace remotely as interesting as Sydney? Monaco, in Goldeneye of course.\n\nEver since then, the movies have been set in Cuba; Afghanistan; Hamburg, Germany; Vietnam; Kazakhstan; Baku, Azerbaijan; and Turkey. There may be a unique thrill to seeing and filming the dried up oil fields of Kazakhstan but they hardly qualify as exotic locations. Too often in the Brosnan Bond films one exotic location has served to double another, less exotic location. For example, in Tomorrow Never Dies, the production crew filmed in the snow capped mountains of France for the pre-credit sequence, yet the location doubled for Afghanistan. For The World Is Not Enough they again went back to France, this time to film a ski chase on the slopes of Chamonix, yet that location doubled for Kazakhstan, not exactly a place well known for its glamorous ski slopes, beautiful lodges, or enticing snow bunnies. Thailand has doubled for Vietnam, Spain for Azerbaijan, and Puerto Rico for Cuba. This has got to stop. Where are the scenes of Bond walking along the piers of Fisherman’s Wharf in San Francisco? Or driving through the back alleys of Tangier, Morocco? Or jumping from the Hemingway Estate in Key West, Florida? Enough with the contemporary storylines that take Bond into some of the most politically charged regions of the world. For years the Bond fans have clamored for 007 to be sent to Australia, yet here we have to look at Ethan Hunt be the first action hero to go on assignment down under. It’s not too late for Bond to go, but it won’t happen if the series lets other franchises steal their material and then steal their thunder.\n\nAnd what about the lead female in MI-2? For years this website has offered up the name of Halle Berry as a potential Bond Girl that is not only stunningly beautiful, but also able to widen the film’s racial demographics, yet it is Mission: Impossible-2 that takes the first step forward in hiring a black actress to be the love interest for Tom Cruise and Dougray Scott, two white actors no less. Her race is never an issue in the film and little of it has been made in the press, but shouldn’t the Bond films, which were at one time in their history considered “cutting edge”, have been the first major action series to have a black actress as a lead love interest? Yes, we’ve had Rosie Carver and May Day, but they were villainesses who ended up dead. Halle could easily have played Paris Carver, a role that had no particular race distinction attached to it, or even Christmas Jones. Better yet, why not just write a role for her? Other film projects have shown an alarming amount of forward and progressive thinking, particularly in terms of casting, that threaten to leave the Bond series in the dust if something is not done.\n\nThe Cast: George Lazenby (James Bond), Diana Rigg (Teresa DiVicenzo), Gabriele Ferzeti (Draco), Irma Bunt (Ilse Steppat), Telly Savalas (Ernst Stavros Blofeld)\n\nThe Supporting Cast: Bernard Lee (“M”), Desmond Llewelyn (“Q”), Lois Maxwell (Moneypenny), Sir Hillary Bray (George Baker)\n\nCredits: Produced by Albert R.

A minor footnote in the history of Bond, Lazenby had the misfortune of making his debut in one of the most emotionally involving Bond films ever. This film deals with the courtship, marriage and loss of Bond`s wife Tracy and distances itself away from some of the excesses of Thunderball and You Only Live Twice, by backloading the film with the action and instead devoting the first half to plot and character development.\n\nWhat Are Generic Drugs?

Casual fans of the series rejected the film out of hand, and if it weren`t for Bond fans, the film might have been completely overlooked and considered as one of the most unmemorable Bond films. That would`ve been too bad, because On Her Majesty`s Secret Service does have many fine points.\n\nThe movie jumps right into the story from the first frame. Bond, in Portugal, has his curiosity piqued by a beautiful woman. He follows her car to a secluded beach and spies on her as she gets out and heads into the water. When it becomes clear she intends to do herself harm, Bond steps in and saves her. The matter is complicated when several burly henchmen try to grab the woman and knock Bond out. Bond takes care of them, but in the mean time the beautiful stranger has escaped back to her car and taken off. So much for giving thanks.\n\nLater he finds the woman at the local casino in a game of chemin de fer. A potentially embarassing situation unfolds, as the woman doesn`t have the money to cover her losses. Bond pretends to be her husband and pays her debt, thus helping her avoid humiliation. He finds out her name is Tracy de Vicenzo; that much she will say. Why she is so self destructive she refuses to answer. Instead, she waves her room key in front of Bond and explains she pays her debts in full. Bond and Tracy make love, but he awakes the next morning to find her gone, a single red rose the only reminder of their night before.\n\nBond is just about to leave the hotel when he`s intercepted by several brute henchmen. Bond realizes at this point it is better to find out who they are and what they want rather than to fight. They take him to Marc Ange Draco, Godfather of the Union Corse, one of the biggest Mafia organizations in the world. Draco is convinced Bond is the right man for his “Tracy”, his daughter who has become quite wayward since the death of her mother. She needs a man to “dominate her” Draco says. And he`s willing to pay Bond up front to marry Teresa. Bond refuses the offer but in exchange for courting her, he would accept any help he could get in tracking down Blofeld, Marc`s main rival in the underworld.\n\nTracy eventually gets wind of the arrangement and turns a cold shoulder to 007, but Bond becomes more persistent than ever, eventually winning her heart and affection.\n\nBond comes into some information that Blofeld has hired a lawyer to help him stake a claim to the title of Count de Bleauchamp, a claim he expects the baronet Sir Hillary Bray, of the London College of Arms, to fully back up. Bond persuades Bray to let him pose as Bray in his upcoming face to face meeting with “Bleauchamp” and Bray agrees. Bond affects a small disguise and change of accent and heads to Bern for his meeting with “Bleauchamp.” Bleauchamp is actually Blofeld, and it`s not long before he realizes Bray is not Bray, but instead 007. However, he`s not quick enough to this fact until after Bond has had ample time to realize what Blofeld`s next scheme for world domination is. Bond escapes the high mountain top fortress of Blofeld to get help and while there in the little Swiss village, he runs into Tracy.\n\nTracy realizes Bond is in danger and needs help, and the two escape Irma Bunt and her henchmen in Tracy`s car. They eventually arrive in a deserted barn during a fierce snowstorm and bundle up together in the hayloft, where Bond proposes marriage to Tracy. She accepts.\n\nThe next day Tracy and Bond escape the barn on skiis, with Blofeld personally hot on their tail. He creates an avalanche that envelops Tracy and Bond. Tracy is taken alive as a hostage while Bond can do nothing but wait and plan his return assault on Blofeld`s retreat.\n\nAs Bond, Lazenby is not bad; quite good actually for a beginner, whose previous jobs included male modeling and used car sales. His weakness was the one liners. Many of them come across and clunky and heavy, particulary such lines as: “He branched off” and “He had guts.” The lines have a childish ring to them, as if they were thought of by an 8 year old. Lazenby didn`t write the scenes, but he couldn`t save them either. What he was very effective at was his romantic scenes with Rigg. Rigg sparkles as a tough, independent, spirited daddy`s girl and the sparks fly between Rigg and Lazenby on camera, even if they weren`t off-camera.\n\nThe direction could be a bit tighter. Some of the action sequences are spliced together too quickly, in particular Lazenby`s early fight sequences, and employ sound effects that are borderline cheesy. The ski and car chase are the highlights of the film.\n\nThe world didn`t realize what it had with Lazenby. Lazenby didn`t realize what he had with Bond, and would later regret his decision to do only one Bond film. His career never acheived the heights of any of the other Bond actors, and this is strictly his fault, but the one shot he took at Bond was as good if not better than almost any other Bond film attempted.\n\nTHE CAST: Sean Connery (James Bond); Kim Basinger (Domino Pitachi); Barbara Carrera (Fatima Blush); Max Von Sydow (Blofeld); Klaus Maria Brandauer (Maximillian Largo)\n\nTHE SUPPORTING CAST: James Fox (“M”); Bernie Casey (Felix Leiter); Pat Roach (Lippe)\n\nCREDITS: Direced by Irwin Kershner; Produced by Kevin McClory and Sean Connery; Music by Michael LeGrand; Title Song by Lani Hall; Filmed on location in Nice, France; The Bahamas and North Africa\n\nIn a legal battle too lengthy to get into here but covered thoroughly in our Movie fa”Q” section, Producer Kevin McClory secured the right to do a remake of the 1965 Bond film Thunderball. Kevin was a player on the original team who helped develop what would eventually become the book Thunderball, by Ian Fleming. Thunderball was a huge success in 1965, and McClory should have left well enough alone. He didn`t, and thus we have Never Say Never Again.\n\nAlthough the film is a remake of Thunderball, it oddly manages to get wrong everything that made the original work so well. To its credit, the film makes a knowing nod to Connery`s age and incorporates it into the story, first sending Bond off to Shrublands to get back into shape after a failed training exercise.\n\nWhile Bond is working out at Shrublands, SPECTRE has put into motion its plan to steal two nuclear warheads and hold the world for ransom. Only two? To do this, SPECTRE has corrupted an American Air Force pilot on station in England by getting him addicted to heroin. His addiction is all the more ironic, and funny, because his nurse, SPECTRE agent Fatima Blush, is giving it to him. Colonel Petachi has had a retina transplant. The new retina is identical to that of the President of the United States, and with the combination of secret codes and a retinal scan, SPECTRE is now in a prime position to get the warheads. SPECTRE sends Colonel Petachi and Fatima Blush to Shrublands to rest and prepare for the operation.\n\nIt is at Shrublands that Bond sees Fatima and Colonel Petachi, and his sixth sense kicks in. Bond senses that something is not quite right, but Fatima recognizes 007 before he can put a plan into operation. Blush orders Count Lippe to kill Bond.\n\nBond kills Lippe but only after it is too late. By the time Bond is able to digest what has been happening, SPECTRE has acquired the warheads and killed off the now useless Colonel Petachi. Fatima retreats to Nassau to await further instruction and Bond tracks her down there while initially on a search for Largo and his boat, The Flying Saucer.\n\nFrom this point on there is almost no plot development. Bond suspects Largo from the very beginning, and even deduces that he has the two warheads on his yacht without having to do much spying at all. And moving the action to the Bahamas does absolutely nothing for the plot. Everything from Bond`s entrance into Nassau to the point in which he finds out The Flying Saucer has sailed for the French Riviera is completely unrelated to the rest of the story and only serves to fill time. Bond could have placed a call prior to going down to Nassau to find out if The Flying Saucer was in port. Did he really need to go to The Bahamas to find out if a boat was still in port? No. Kevin McClory just wanted to make sure some of the film took place in his home country. It`s only through the dynamic performance of Barbara Carerra that these scenes are remotely interesting. She gives life to even the most mundane tasks, whether it be water skiing, dancing in a carnival, dancing her way up the stairs as she gets ready to plant a bomb in Bond`s room, or the ice cold look of indifference as she blows apart the hotel room.\n\nOn virtually every level the film is a disappointment. Let`s start with the star attraction of the film: Sean Connery. His return to the role that made him famous is a washout. Connery lacks the charisma and strength that carried him through the first five films. He returned to the role, in part, to get back at Albert Broccoli for his perceived slights at Connery, rather than a genuine interest to *be* Bond. Connery recognizes he`s old, and the script is tailored to reflect that understanding. But still, as a producer of this film, Connery seemed to be juggling too many responsibilities.\n\nThe Bond Girl, in the form of Kim Basinger, would be the worst Bond girl ever, except for the fact that Mrs. Basinger can act. Still, her `Domino` is a pale, fragile, washed out, on-the-edge mistress to Largo. Basinger isn`t as sexy as Claudine Auger (the original Domino), or as exotic. She`s a real downer, and takes a lot of the energy out of the film whenever she`s in it.\n\n`Never` does have two redeeming qualities, namely the villains. Klaus Maria Brandauer gives a wild performance as the neurotic, jealous and easily inflamed Largo. Never Say Never Again`s scene stealer though is Barbara Carrera. Her character, Fatima Blush, is a loosely interpreted variation of the Fiona Volpe character from Thunderball (and wickedly played by Lucianna Paluzzi). Fatima is a character who believes in the inherent superiority of women over men, and killing James Bond would drive the point home. Carrera gets all the best lines of the movie, and whenever she is on screen, the film instantly gets a lift and is fun and energized. In fact, only Brandauer and Carrera seem to be having any fun on the set. The film makes a crucial mistake killing Blush off with another 40+ minutes of film left to go.\n\nThe plot is straight out of Thunderball. Legally it had to be. Despite how closely the film had to follow the original version, this script still seems incomplete and haphazard. The direction is a failure as well, primarily because the director and editor allow too many stretches of long, boring sequences to make it into the film. The scuba sequences bog down the pace of the film, and were better in the original.\n\nThe soundtrack is the worst for any Bond film. It is completley wrong for this type of film and begs to be redone. The jazz tunes written by LeGrand completely destroy any and all impact the action sequences might have had. And the theme song is just as dreadful. It`s hard to imagine any singer lower on the musical totem pole than Ms. Hall. The action sequences, with the exception of the motorcycle chase through the streets of southern France, are uninspiring and your basic B grade action flick stunt fare.\n\nAt the end of the film, Connery`s 007 goes back into retirement, only to be prodded by Nigel Smallfawcet to come back out and save the world. 007 says “No, never again.” After viewing this film, let`s hope that all involved in this film keep that promise.\n\nNOTE:Reviews of the Special Edition DVD of Moonraker are based on Region One features.\n\n• TheatricalRelease Date: June 29, 1979\n\n• Aspect Ratio(s):Widescreen Anamorphic – 2.35:1\n\n• DVD Encoding: Region 1\n\n• Layers: Dual\n\n• Audio Tracks: English (Dolby Digital 5.1), French (Dolby Digital 2.0 Surround)\n\n• Subtitles: English, Spanish, French\n\n• Theatrical trailer(s)\n\n• Inside Moonraker Documentary\n\n• The Men Behind The Mayhem Documentary: Behind-The-Scenes Look At The Special Effects\n\n• Still Gallery\n\n• Collectible Making-Of Booklet\n\nMoonraker, the 11th Bond film, was released again on DVD, this time on May 16th as a Special Edition. The special features include the documentary “Inside Moonraker”, the documentary “The Men Behind The Mayhem” (a tribute to the special effects wizards of the Bond series), scene selections, audio commenarty with Director Lewis Gilbert, original theatrical trailer, still gallery, widescreen format, Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound and a collectible “Making Of” booklet.\n\nThe Moonraker Special Edition DVD comes highly recommened, though with a few complaints. Standing above and beyond all the other features to be found on the disc, John Cork`s “Inside Moonraker” documentary is a fascinating look back at how production began on the film. Key players are interviewed, including Lewis Gilbert, Michael G. Wilson, Michael Lonsdale, Roger Moore, Lois Chiles and Richard Kiel. John Cork both directs and produces the documentary, and he includes promotional footage and interviews done back in 1978 and 1979 when Moonraker was underway, along with new interviews designed to show the stars reflecting on their experiences filming the movie. Oddly enough, the documentary goes into much greater detail about the special effects work that went into Moonraker than the actual special effects tribute called “The Men Behind The Mayhem”. Michael Wilson goes into detail about how location scouting for Moonraker first took them to India as well as the difficulties of co-producing the film with French partners, whose construction labor was lazy and unfocused. Be sure to stick around for the documentary credits, as they show outtakes and bloopers from the set, including the most hysterical one of all: Bond and Holly looking out the window of the space station as the globes are launched. All of the sudden, a little green alien drops in front of the window and begins washing it.\n\nThe still gallery is impressive as well, including many rare or never before seen photos. Some of them are mundane, such as the construction of the space station set, yet it gives you an idea of exactly how difficult it is to build these sets. My personal favorite section of the still gallery was the promotional materials, with all of the different variations on the Moonraker poster.\n\nThe film is one sided and that means in this case the only version of Moonraker you get is widescreen or 2:35:1 ratio. This is the way it always should be. After all, why invest in DVD and its wonderful features if all you want is pan and scan?Most fans of the series today have never had the opportunity to view the older Bond films in the theater, or in a widescreen format in a personal home theater system for that matter. Television networks have typically run the films entirely in “pan and scan”, and with the advent of spinning logos and blatant advertising during the airing of programs these days, it`s nice to be able to sit back and see Bond in all his full glory. DVD was made with Moonraker in mind. With true widescreen, you are getting to see up to 50% more of the picture than a typical airing of Moonraker on TBS. Common widescreen ratios include 1.66:1, 1.85:1 and 2.35:1. so with Moonraker you are getting everything. The inclusion of Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound enhances the viewing experience. Scene selections are cut in half for the second round of DVD releases. Where the first wave averaged 55 to 60 scenes, Moonraker only has 32, thus forcing you to sit through more of a scene to get to the point you really want to see.\n\nThe original theatrical trailer riffs on Star Wars, but what`s more interesting than that is how long the trailer is. It clocks in at around four minutes, which is nearly twice as long as they are today. The style and substance of movie previews have changed, and the old way in which Bond was advertised in theaters and on television no longer works.\n\nThe special effects documentary features archival interviews with such Bond f/x stalwarts as John Stears and Derek Meddings (both have since died), as well as Chris Corbould. At 20 minutes, the documentary crams in a tribute to all 19 official Bond movies, leaving about one minute for each film be analyzed. This is a pity, as a whole section on the special effects of Moonraker would have been interesting. Instead, the special effects artists quickly gloss over each film, with very little analysis or explanation of how each shot was established. The documentary was produced and directed by John Cork and written by Bruce Scivally; not their finest work.\n\nMGM touts this special edition as having a “collectible booklet”, but it`s hardly worth much. Most of the information contained in the booklet has been on this website for years. Still, the booklet does have one advantage: the front cover can be nicely inserted into the plastic cover of the DVD box, thus providing a new alternative cover to the standard one that MGM has been issuing for the past several years now. It would be nice if they would include the old poster artwork on the cover, or else provide a way for fans to have alternatives.\n\nThe only truly frustrating aspect of this DVD is the audio commentary, featuring four key players during the production of Moonraker: William Cartlidge, Michael G. Wilson, Lewis Gilbert and Christopher Wood. Whether it is due to advanced age or something else, Lewis Gilbert more often than not comes across as surprised, confused, bewildered and forgetful of a film he helped create. Not only does he have memory lapses of his own film and its position in the series, but quite often he breaks into spontaneous side points while other guests are speaking. Where other Bond DVDs have at least two audio tracks, Moonraker crams all of its subjects onto one track, thus forcing all four guests to compete at the same time to be heard. The track is not terribly insightful, but here are few of the more interesting items overheard:\n\n– Christopher Wood originally conceived the role of helicopter pilot Corrine Dufour as a “ditzy” Southern California girl. The characterization had to be rethought when French actress Corrine Clery was hired.\n\n– William Cartlidge originally wanted to have a motorbike chase over the canals and on top of the gondolas of Venice\n\n– Christopher Wood hated the line “I never learned how to read”\n\n– Originally Christopher Wood wanted Bond to say “He had an ear for music” when throwing Chang down into the piano bar, but was overruled by Cubby Broccoli.\n\nMOONRAKER (original DVD release)\n\nReview by: Kevin Bell\n\nUsing Q Branch`s latest equipment, I was able to review Moonraker, MGM`s first Moore-Bond DVD release on a large-screen television equipped with DVD player and Dolby Pro-Logic Surround Sound speakers.\n\nBonus DVD Features: Thanks to the vast storage space DVD discs provide, MGM was able to pack the Moonraker disc (and the other Bond movies) with plenty of added excitement. Both “pan and scan” and wide screen versions of the film are fit onto a single side of the disc, along with two new soundtracks and DVD-only bonus features not seen on the videotape release.\n\nThe most exciting new DVD bonus feature was to be the “Making of Moonraker” featurette. Unfortunately, in reality this was the very low point of the disc (not including the Star Wars-inspired finale of the movie itself!). The Making of Moonraker is only four minutes in duration and is mostly an alternate movie trailer. A few brief sound bites from director Lewis Gilbert and Roger Moore make this “bonus” worth a mention at all.\n\nThe “Trivia and Production Notes” section of the 007 DVDs is always fascinating, and this disc is no exception. For instance, Lewis Gilbert’s joking that he could “actually make several films for the cost of Moonraker`s phone bills alone!”\n\n“Direct Access to Bond Gadgets” is in itself a gadget, not quite interesting enough to want to go through, but just the thing to load up for showing your Bondian colleagues the awesome powers of DVD as opposed to mere mortal videotape. This section documents all of Bond`s weapons (yes, including the Moonraker laser, shudder!) and Q’s gaggle of gadgetry, allowing the user to jump directly to scenes highlighting the items. This is fun that fails to last.\n\nMy favorite bonus on all the DVDs is the original theatrical trailers.\n\nMoonraker`s trailer, released one year after Star Wars, emphasizes drawing in the crossover Sci-fi crowd. (Is there such a thing as a Bond Sci-fi crossover?) Roger Moore`s credit even scrolls slightly slanted across the screen, reminiscent of happier Bond times “long ago, in a galaxy far, far away.” If my personal bias against Moonraker has etched into my report and upset the “Sons of Rog”, my sincere apologies. (Actually, I think Moonraker is one of Bond’s best, until James leaves Earth for Drax-ney-land.)\n\nThe sound quality of the DVD is excellent and the film has been digitally re-mastered into the THX format. The English tracks, available in Dolby Digital 5.1, really make a difference. Listen to when Drax`s shuttle fires its main engines for liftoff—no comparison to the videocassette version! Oddly enough, a lot of the French dialogue tracks were recorded in English. This is the case with all the background speech, unlike other Bond releases. The disc features English, French and Spanish language subtitles, but only English and French soundtracks. (Admittedly, a small complaint, but hearing GoldenEye`s “Bond, James Bond” in Spanish can be quite amusing.) Video quality is superb, as should be expected with the DVD medium. None of the grainy feel that plagues videos from the `70s is present. Top notch re-mastering of the film!\n\nIn all, a very competent disc given to us from MGM. The “Making Of” featurette and fewer spoken soundtracks were disappointing, but the audio and video and wide screen format “moore” than compensate for any shortcomings.\n\nFour years ago the James Bond series roared back to life with the release of GoldenEye. Pierce Brosnan’s debut Bond film smashed box office records around the globe and became the highest grossing 007 film to date. Bond fans were gratified that the series still had appeal in the 1990’s and that the general public agreed.\n\nAs we near the release of the third Pierce Brosnan film, The World Is Not Enough, Universal Exports feels that its time to take a cold-eyed view of GoldenEye and determine whether or not the film deserves the accolades it received at the time. Is GoldenEye classic Bond or were we all swept up in the hype of the moment? Now that the dust has settled, we can objectively look back at GoldenEye and properly place it in the context of the entire James Bond series.\n\nLicence Suspended\n\nWhen Licence To Kill performed poorly at the box office and Eon sued MGM over Bond related business issues, the film series was put on indefinite hold. At times it looked like there would never be another Bond film made. Action films had changed in the early ’90s and audiences seemed content with the Mel Gibson-Arnold Schwarzenneggar style of action flick; loud and dumb. The general public was not clamoring for a new James Bond film. Nor were they awaiting the return of Timothy Dalton as Bond. Dalton is an excellent actor but not the general public’s idea of what James Bond should be.\n\nLuckily for Bond fans, the perpetually ailing MGM needed to resurrect the Bond films to keep itself alive. In late 1992, the lawsuit between MGM and Eon was settled and work commenced on a script for the first 007 film of the ’90s. Screenwriter Michael France was given the chance to reinvent the Bond series for a new generation.\n\nMGM also had some clear ideas on how to reinvigorate the moribund series. Chief among them was the decision not to re-hire Timothy Dalton for the role of James Bond. Many names were tossed about but the eventual winner was the popular choice; Irish actor Pierce Brosnan.\n\nAnother factor in the new film’s development would be the limited involvement from longtime Bond producer Albert Broccoli. Poor health would sideline Broccoli, leaving day to day producing chores to Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli. Also asserting a stronger hand would be the financiers United Artists in the form of its chairman John Calley and development executive Jeff Kleeman.\n\nThe creative team was considerably different from prior 007 films. The stakes were high because it was unknown whether or not the cinema-going public would still accept 007 in the ’90s. The gamble paid off though and GoldenEye was a massive success at the end of 1995. The film’s success proved that James Bond would endure.\n\nThe euphoria over the success of GoldenEye swept through the Bond fan world. Whatever faults the film had, they were sidelined to the money train that the new film was on. It was cool again to be a James Bond fan. GoldenEye also brought new fans into the fold and gave the public a different sort of action hero, a return to the elegant gentleman heroes of yesteryear.\n\nWhen all is said and done though, is GoldenEye a classic James Bond film? Will we go back to it over and over again as we do to Goldfinger, OHMSS or The Spy Who Loved Me? Its still a little early to do the full critical reappraisal but my initial thought is no, GoldenEye will not stand the test of time. A careful examination of its many parts will reveal the root of the problem.\n\nFool’s Gold?\n\nGoldenEye certainly has all the trappings of the classic Bond films; beautiful women, exotic locations, and an evil villain with a dastardly plot. So why does the film seem torpid in hindsight?\n\nA primary reason for the diminished luster is that the two succeeding Bond films, Tomorrow Never Dies and The World is Not Enough are both better Bond films. Bond connoisseurs were pleased with what they saw in GoldenEye but they were more satisfied with what they saw in Tomorrow Never Dies and The World Is Not Enough. On the whole, the succeeding films had more of the hot-buttons to excite Bond fans than GoldenEye did. GoldenEye got the job done in 1995 but appears lackluster at the millennium; its appeal has been overshadowed by the newer films’ brilliance.\n\nOne of GoldenEye’s biggest weaknesses is its lackluster villain Alec Trevelyan. Sean Bean’s performance was fine but the notion of a rogue agent bent on world chaos is not as palpably Bondian as prior villains. For one thing, the Bond villain should always be middle-aged. Yes, the actors who play Bond are middle-aged themselves but the villain should always appear older than 007.\n\nThe classic Bond villain should not be a contemporary or reverse image of James Bond. They should be sedentary figures content to carry out their evil schemes from the luxury of their high-tech lairs while strong arm men carry out the physical work. James Bond should be the only man of action in the story; we do not want the villain out in the trenches. When the villain is Bondian in nature himself, it muddles the underlying tension of Bond rebelling against a father-figure. Making the villain a reverse image of Bond did not work in The Man With the Golden Gun and did not work again in GoldenEye.\n\nIn an essay on Sean Connery, novelist Michael Crichton called the Bond villains “baroque”, an appellation that captures perfectly the Bond villain’s essence; ornate evil. Villains such as Goldfinger, Stromberg or Drax had this quality. Alec Trevelyan does not. These villains also exude a paternalistic evil. Their deeds reveal a “look son, I’m causing chaos because I know what’s best for the world.”attitude. Trevelyan’s stated goal of avenging the betrayal of his family is not sufficiently baroque enough to excite seasoned Bond fans.\n\nScript Doctor\n\nThe weakness of the Trevelyan character is not due to Sean Bean but to the script. The final screenplay by Bruce Feirstein has some major issues that contribute to the diminished reputation of GoldenEye. This is apparent with the revelations contained in Michael France’s first draft of GoldenEye which surfaced on the collector’s market a few years ago.\n\nA perusal of the France script confirms that it would have made one hell of a Bond movie. Being a fan himself, France knew what makes a great Bond film. He crammed his script with characters and situations that were far superior to what the film went with. Just think, the Mission Impossible bullet train climax could have been a Bond sequence as it was in the first draft of GoldenEye.\n\nThe basic story of the France script is the same as the film. Alexander Trevelyan plots to wreak havoc with a nuclear pulse satellite. The execution was far more satisfying though. To use one example, the Trevelyan character was an older mentor figure to 007 rather than a colleague. The role was tailored to Anthony Hopkins and therefore closer in conception to the classic ideas of Bond villainy; the cultured, sophisticated megalomaniac rather than a mirror image of Bond himself.\n\nA detailed discussion of the France script is covered in another article in this issue but the problems can also be contrasted with Jeffrey Caine’s second draft. Caine’s version is much closer to the film but yet again, its situations and characterizations are more Bondian than the Feirstein version. This begs the question of whether Feirstein knows what he’s doing. The same scenario occurs with the Feirstein rewrites of Tomorrow Never Dies and The World is Not Enough. But that’s another story altogether.\n\nThe France script also put Russia and the Caribbean to better use as locations than the final film did. Classic Bond films are travelogues that take the viewer to places that they have never been before or at least have never seen in that particular fashion.\n\nCertainly Russia and Cuba have not been visited by most people but their presentation in GoldenEye leaves much to be desired. Yes, James Bond does destroy half of St. Petersburg with that tank but did you really get the feeling that Bond was in Russia? Sure it looked dank and run-down but so does a lot of England, where most of the Russia sequence was filmed.\n\nThe key travel element missing from GoldenEye was Russia itself. The location was faked very well but that fakeness gave the location a nondescript, vague feeling. The audience does not get the tone of Russia as a country, as they did with Japan in You Only Live Twice or Egypt in The Spy Who Loved Me. Bond also does not have interaction with Russian society. He downs some vodka with Valentin Zukovsky but that is the extent of his experience with the culture. Again, the Michael France script surpasses the film by presenting a more vivid country emerging from the Soviet police state. An excellent sequence of Bond breaking into the former KGB headquarters at the Lubyanka in Moscow was sorely missed in the finished film.\n\nLicence Unearned?\n\nWeak dialogue and even worse one-liners brings us to Pierce Brosnan’s interpretation of James Bond. There is no doubt that Brosnan is right for the role. He has the looks, the grace, the acting ability and the stature to play Bond. Brosnan is universally heralded as “the best Bond since Connery”. If this is the case, then why is he not satisfying for some Bond fans? This is a larger issue, but in the context of GoldenEye, there are some definite hints as to what the problems are.\n\nGoldenEye took great pains to surround Brosnan with Bondian trappings. Bond plays cards in a casino, he wears a fantastic dinner jacket, he drinks vodka martinis and drives an Aston Martin DB5. But do these superficial elements a James Bond make? To some they do but to serious observers, they are window dressing.\n\nThe answer then, is that Pierce Brosnan is not fully successful with his interpretation of James Bond. Brosnan is not miscast as Bond, that would be an absurd comment to make. He is misguided though. Brosnan’s glib and sleek performance resembles a fourth generation photocopy, the broad outlines are there, but the original crispness and clarity is blurred. Brosnan looks great in the Brioni suits and can order a mean martini but doubts remain as to whether he truly understands what makes James Bond tick.\n\nBrosnan came to the role claiming that he wanted to peel back the layers of Bond’s psyche to find out what demons haunted the man. Fine, we get a scene with Bond being introspective on a Caribbean beach. This is not a problem. What is a problem is the other 98% of the film where Brosnan’s James Bond does not have the sardonic elan of Sean Connery or the arch wiliness of Roger Moore. Not that you need that to be a great Bond. Timothy Dalton did not emulate his predecessors but remained true to the Fleming character; another element that Brosnan ignores. His Bond is blandness personified. Contemporary interviews with Brosnan in the GoldenEye era reveal a lot of “me, me, me” and very little Fleming. Compare this to Dalton’s interviews in the 1986-87 era.\n\nOn a larger note, does Brosnan’s 007-lite reflect a larger issue with GoldenEye? Did the filmmakers and studio think that the public was so deprived of a Bond film that they would take a diluted version over none at all? Was GoldenEye created as a clever way to reposition Bond for the 1990’s and beyond? Or was it a slack, Hollywood approach to making a buck off a product that has considerable consumer awareness? A new and improved James Bond that has been taste tested and repackaged for the nostalgia challenged ’90s? Never mind that the product has lost its original secret ingredients that made us buy it in the first place.\n\nCould this be attributed to the departure of Cubby Brocccoli from the Bond series? A strong argument can be made that the situation became more acute with Tomorrow Never Dies and The World is Not Enough but we are concerned with GoldenEye when Cubby was still alive and had input into the film.\n\nThere is evidence that MGM played a stronger creative role with GoldenEye than it did with previous Bond films. The most obvious fact is the studio brokered tie-in with BMW. This product placement is totally wrong for James Bond. Bond always drove a fantasy car that was out of reach for most people. With GoldenEye, Bond becomes a salesman for the launch of a solidly yuppie/mid-life crisis car in the form of the BMW Z3. Would Ian Fleming approve? I think not. Fleming did not shy away from name brand dropping in the novels but he would never have sanctioned Bond driving a car like the Z3.\n\nThe Bond Parabola\n\nThere is another factor working against GoldenEye which affects all new Bond films; a slow reappraisal after the film has been viewed many times and begins to sink in. There is an arc that all Bond films travel; euphoria at the thrill of seeing a new Bond film; acceptance of what it contains and then a slow downward slope when the serious observer mulls over what he has seen. The inevitable comparisons to the previous entries starts to kick in when the front-loaded hype of the new film starts to abate.\n\nThis scenario happened with Licence To Kill and Tomorrow Never Dies. This will also happen with The World is Not Enough. The arc was distorted with GoldenEye though. The six-year gap between films created a pent-up demand for hardcore fans which caused them to overlook many of the film’s flaws at the time. Only later did people start to seriously contemplate the film’s weaknesses. Once the superb Tomorrow Never Dies was made and fully digested, did people notice how slack GoldenEye really was.\n\nGoldenEye’s stature has dropped to the point that I feel that the film is third tier Bond material. GoldenEye cannot hold a candle to Goldfinger or The Spy Who Loved Me. Nor is the film as good as You Only Live Twice, Octopussy or The Living Daylights. In fact, I rank GoldenEye somewhere near the Thunderball, Live and Let Die range which is not that far removed from A View To A Kill and The Man With the Golden Gun. I make no secret that I much prefer Tomorrow Never Dies to GoldenEye and I also feel that The World is Not Enough has more potential than GoldenEye did. Its not that I dislike GoldenEye, its just that if I had to sit down and watch a Bond movie to cure a Bond craving, I’d much rather choose many other Bond films before I chose GoldenEye.\n\nIn the end, GoldenEye was a great reintroduction to James Bond for the general cinema-goer. The film was slick and entertaining and touched on many of the old Bond film familiars. The marketing campaign was superb and audiences flocked to the film. GoldenEye provided a good foundation for the continued Bond series to build on. The numerous drawbacks have taken their toll though. Some we have touched on, others such as the jarring score and the weak songs contribute to the film’s decline vis a vis successive Bond films.\n\nI certainly appreciate GoldenEye and get a rush out of many of its elements. The film is beautifully photographed and directed with crisp efficiency. But I knew from the very first viewing that there was something alien to me with this film. I have waxed and waned on the subject, but in the end, GoldenEye has slid to the lower rungs of my Bond film preferences. I am not sour on Bond, not a bit. I knew from the first viewing of Tomorrow Never Dies that that was a Bond film for the ages which stylistically had more in common with its predecessors than GoldenEye did. I am an optimist and feel that the Bond films will endure.\n\nThe pervading sense of ambivalence which surrounds GoldenEye is troubling for many Bond fans. The film’s massive success indicates that many people thought the film good enough to swell the coffers. That is what counts in the end. With that in mind, I respect GoldenEye for the financial success that it represents. Critically, I must dissent and say that the film does not work on many levels and will never be considered a Bond classic in my book.\n\n—Greg Bechtloff is the American representative for The International James Bond Fan Club.\n\nDr. No (1962)\n\nThe Cast Sean Connery (James Bond), Ursula Andress (Honey Rider), Jack Lord (Felix Leiter), Zena Marshall (Miss Taro), Joseph Wiseman (Dr.No)\n\nThe Supporting Cast Bernard Lee (“M”), Lois Maxwell (Moneypenny), Eunice Gayson (Sylvia Trench)\n\nCredits Produced by Albert R.

James Bond.”\n\nReview by: Cavan Scott\n\nThe beautiful woman announces `Banco` and her adversary across the Casino table lights a cigarette as he calmly accepts her challenge. When asked his name, he replies simply `Bond, James Bond`, his cigarette hanging loosely from his lips and the touchpaper for over thirty years of cinematic excitement is lit. Producers, Harry Saltzman and Albert R. Broccoli had long planned a series of films chronicling the adventures of Ian Fleming`s infamous secret agent, but they could never have prophesied the phenomenal success that the franchise would become. Bond had arrived and action heroes were never going to be the same again.\n\nCompared to its 17 sequels, Dr. No is a low key adventure, which rarely rises above the melodrama of it contemporary features. Terence Young`s direction is, at best, average and Monty Norman`s score leads much to be desired, comprising mainly of variations of the lilting `Underneath the Mango Tree` and somewhat annoying repetition of the Bond Theme itself. Two elements save the picture and give it a class which its rivals of the time could only dream of.\n\nThe first reason is the film`s loyalty to Fleming`s original novel. This is the nearest that the 007 of the silver screen has ever been to the Bond of the printed page. Although the components of future trademarks are present they are only found in their infancy. Much of the dialogue is adapted directly from the novel, thus holding back the flippancy that would characterize our hero in his later missions. With the absence of Q Branch, Bond must also use his wits rather than a bag of tricks to aid him in his task, as displayed in 007 using such down-to-earth methods such as sticking hair over doors and covering his briefcase locks with talcum power to catch out potential meddlers. We are consequently presented with a grittier image of Bond and his world, which makes him far more human and therefore believable.\n\nIn just a few movies this vulnerable Bond who can take a pasting and yet still manage to struggle through despite injuries, would be replaced by a demi-god who never even gets a hair out of place in a moment of danger. No matter how much we would enjoy the future incarnations of Bond, we could never believe that anyone could hurt the agent as much as we saw in Dr No`s assault course, thus reducing the tension. An indestructible hero never has the chance to fail, and a vital dimension of the character is lost.\n\nThis is why Dr No can be seen as possibly Sean Connery`s finest performances as James. While he was not Fleming`s own choice for the role – the writer believed that the unknown actor did not possess the social grace to play his hero, favoring David Niven or even the young Roger Moore – Connery oozes confidence in every scene. Here is a man born to play Bond. He is suave and yet stuck in the chauvinistic rut of a past time. In times of crises, he is controlled and cold nevertheless fueled by a supreme of sense of justice and loyalty. The Bond of Dr. No is not a man to be trifled with.\n\nJoining Connery is a fine cast who prove to be more than second fiddles to the star. Bernard Lee is undoubtedly the ideal candidate for M, bringing the right mixture of testiness and strength needed to play the old man, while Lois Maxwell begins her marathon run of deep sigh`s and lingering looks with tongue in cheek canniness. On the side of the devil, Joseph Wiseman`s Dr. No is just a frosty as the novel suggested, with an air of aloof detachment that chills the blood.\n\nYet no examination of Dr. No is complete without mention of its leading lady. Ask most movie fans what they remember most about the film and it can be guaranteed that their mind will automatically conjure up the image of Ursula Andress rising from the sea. Although she lacks the broken nose of Fleming`s Rider, the Honey of the film perfectly captures the innocence of the author`s creation. Unlike the modern Bond girls who are superficially PC and yet soon revealed to be walking center-folds ready to scream and be captured as the plot requires, Andress is at least given the dignity of playing a naive girl swept into a nightmare and able to show real bravery. She may not please some more radical critics but she is a far more satisfying character than the many token action girls who have succeeded her.\n\nBy no means the most thrilling of the Bond movies, yet somehow more adult, Dr. No was the perfect prototype for the world`s most successful film series. Simple but captivating, mundane and yet still extraordinary the cinematic debut of Fleming`s hero grabbed an era`s imagination and wouldn`t loosen its grip until future generations had also become ensnared in his exotic exploits.

Connery seems to be sleepwalking through this role, and with his unprecedented salary for returning as Bond one last time, you`d be forgiven for expecting more out of him.\n\nLooking old, out of shape, haggard and tired, Connery picks up where Lazenby`s Bond left off…avenging Tracy. But you`d hardly guess that Bond was bent on revenge at the beginning of this film by the way everyone plays their scenes. Connery acts as though avenging his wife is as casual as driving through a pick up window at McDonalds. No mention is made of Tracy.\n\nThe real story though is Bond, hot on the heels of diamond smugglers. A certain amount of smuggling is accepted by the British in their South African mines, but lately an alarming amount is leaving the area and not being sold on the black market. MI6 is concerned that someone may be stockpiling diamonds in an effort to create economical havoc. Bond is assigned to infiltrate the smuggling pipeline and find out where it leads and for what purpose.\n\nThat pipeline begins with Peter Franks. He`s about to be detained in Amsterdam so that Bond can take his place and follow the pipeline. He meets up with Tiffany Case, an expert diamond smuggler who gives him his first shipment: 50,000 karats worth of diamonds. Franks manages to escape his captors and tries to meet up with Tiffany, but Bond intercepts him and kills him, placing his own wallet on Franks` body to make it look like he just killed James Bond. They then shove the diamonds up Franks` backside and send the body off to Las Vegas, where Bond pretends to be the brother of the deceased victim, here to pay his last respects. Hot on his tail is Mr. Wint and Mr. Kidd.\n\nBond figures he`ll be double crossed somewhere down the line, so the diamonds that he was supposed to place in an urn at Morton Slumber`s funeral home are fakes. When he gets the real cash, he tells everyone, they`ll get the real diamonds.\n\nTiffany catches up with Bond in his bedroom and together they conspire to leave the real diamonds at the airport and see who picks them up. A Dr. Metz picks up the diamonds and Bond jumps in the back of Metzes van, which drives off to a secret, underground laboratory in the Nevada desert. There, Bond sees Metz work on a top secret satellite dish encrusted with diamonds. There he begins to realize that the diamonds may serve a higher purpose other than reeking economical havoc on the West. He begins to suspect elusive multimillionaire Willard Whyte is involved in the scheme, as it is his laboratory that is funding the project. But it is soon discovered that Whyte has been kidnapped, and in his place, Blofeld has been running the show.\n\nThe return of Connery to the role was the drawing power of this film, but it`s really the cast, other than Bond, that is the real backbone of the film. Wonderfully written characters dot the `Diamonds` landscape. Charles Gray, with a full head of hair, takes over the Blofeld duties, and is much better than his predecessors. There`s a certain camp factor involved with this Blofeld, and though you hardly feel any danger around him, he is quite fun to watch squaring off against Bond. Wint and Kidd, and Bambi and Thumper are great tag-team villains, with the films best lines always going to Mr. Kidd\n\nA return for nostalgia`s sake is not enough of a reason to make a film if the actor doesn`t get to the root of the character. For the most part, Connery nor Bond resemble our first look at him in Dr. No. Connery seemed distracted and uninterested at times and he`s actually more of a passenger in this film than the driver, as the camp humor and cheesy dialogue foreshadow the films to come.\n\n007Forever is proud to present this sneak preview article from the April 2000 edition of Bright Lights Film Journal. James Bond fan Robert Von Dassanowsky is Director of Film Studies at the University of Colorado, Colorado Springs and founding Vice President of the Austrian American Film Association. A producer, television writer and literary critic, he is a contributor to The International Dictionary of Films and Filmmakers and is currently penning a book on Austrian Cinema.\n\nHis insights on CR may indeed change the way you feel about the oft forgotten film–that some fans remember with fondness for its panache and high swingin 60s style, not to mention provocative performances by David Niven and Peter Sellers, among countless other actors and artists. Perhaps the most despised Bond film yet made, Casino Royale has a fan base today whose voices proclaim it a triumph and merely the most subtle and misunderstood Bond film ever…\n\nBy Robert Von Dassanowsky:\n\nIt was a coup that Columbia Pictures had banked on: the one 007 property that got away from Broccoli and Saltzman`s cash cow series. Producer Charles K. Feldman had hoped to equal or better the popularity of his Woody Allen-scripted “mod” bedroom farce of two years earlier, What`s New Pussycat? and trotted in a dozen stars and their star friends for the occasion. David Niven had already suggested cinematic mayhem in Life`s 1966 multipage color spread by admitting that it is “impossible to find out what we are doing,” and the magazine claimed the film was a runaway mini-Cleopatra at a then outrageous 12 million dollar budget. Despite all the rumors and delays, the film seemed to have its finger on the pulse of psychedelia, the swinging London myth, and it would beat the real Bond entry, You Only Live Twice, to the box office in a March 1967 release. It was popular enough with audiences and received mixed critical reaction, but has since unfairly been labeled as one of the flops of the era. After more than 30 years, it is high time to ask why this film continues to be a nearly poisonous topic among “serious” film scholars and what it has to say about the world that created it.\n\nIn his provocative exposé The Life and Death of Peter Sellers, author Roger Lewis insists that the actor`s career decline was first signaled by his self-indulgence in Casino Royale, in particular, his inability to stick to the script(s) and his desire to turn the flattery of the role (love scene with Ursula Andress and a hefty sum) into a long-sought Cary Grant-type image. His lack of discipline and his demands caused several more rewrites in an already plot-du-jour concept that employed Wolf Mankowitz, John Law, and Michael Sayers as credited writers (with uncredited fragments by Woody Allen, Ben Hecht, Joseph Heller, and Billy Wilder, among others) and five directors to helm the various segments of the film: John Huston, Ken Hughes, Val Guest, Robert Parrish, and Joseph McGrath. The multitudinous talent here did more than mimic the Bondian shifts in the plot and locale. What emerged was a kaleidoscope that utilized the original “serious” Ian Fleming novel, already given television treatment in 1954, as the core of a fabricated frame of plots and subplots that reduce the showdown between Bond (Sellers) and Le Chiffre (Orson Welles) at Casino Royale into the single dramatic moment of the opus.\n\nCasino Royale is thus a metafilm on the process of the “real” Bond cinema, which, beginning with Goldfinger and You Only Live Twice, updated and altered Fleming`s original novels until only character names and vague plot directions were employed. Ultimately, even the titles ran out, but this 1967 film is far more Weltanschauung than spy narrative. Feldman, in his belief that he could make a Bond to break all banks, went to extremes to cover up the lack of two major elements in this “Bond” film–Sean Connery and the James Bond theme. Instead, the film was stocked with in-stars, in-jokes, and an in-style that would surpass not only the grandeur of the original series and its penchant for outrageous cold-warrior escapades, but in turn, influence the megalomania of the “real” Bond series.\n\nBond purists have always loathed the film, while others have preconceived notions of a spy parody and miss the point. The mistake has been to buy into the publicity propaganda and the original sell of the film as a new “trippy” Bond, a funny Bond. This was bound to cause dissension, since a parody cannot be parodied, and the series was already there. The only true mocking of the Broccoli/Saltzman productions occurred in their own series during the tenure of Roger Moore, as that sophomoric silliness made Casino Royale`s deadpan humor and sophistication seem more like the original Fleming by comparison. The film is also an ill fit among Bond imitators like the Flint series or Matt Helm, or even Saltzman`s own Harry Palmer.\n\nCasino Royale`s relationship to Bond is only emblematic; it is a prismatic translation of Fleming`s milieu, not a linear adaptation. And it remains, even today, a wry and provocative sociopolitical satire. The often criticized inconsistencies of the film`s multiple James Bonds, including the banal 007 of Terence Cooper, brought in to cover Sellerss unfinished characterization, intentionally work to confuse the issue of Bond, to overwork the paradigm until it has no value. As Walter Benjamin in his influential essay “Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction” would have it, the original artwork, with its auratic value, has been replaced by accessible but worthless copies. Here, the most unique icon of the era is intentionally made common–a fashion, a fad, a façade: the multiple Bonds are all copies of a first copy, Connery`s Bond. Moneypenny, Hadley, and Mata Bond are all mirror-image copies of their much more substantial parents. These facsimiles are then joined by the “thousand doubles” Dr. Noah has created to replace the “world`s most important figures in culture, politics and the arts.” Although three major world leaders have already been replaced, no one seems to notice. As yet another female James Bond remarks: “Oh, well, that explains a lot of things.” So much for the conspiracy theories of the 1960s. By the release of Goldfinger everyone wanted to be Bond; now everyone was. Like Andy Warhol`s canvas of multiple Marilyns, the original is mythic and its copies are a poor but stand-in fantasy for an era that so floundered between faith and cynicism.\n\nThe subversion of the modern ubermensch is already apparent before the credits, when Bond films customarily feature a spine-tingling mini-adventure on skis or in the sky. Sellers` Bond, however, is simply picked up by a French official in a pissoir. Casino Royale clearly turns its back on the contemporary and enshrines the icon of David Niven, as the retired, legendary Sir James Bond. “Joke shop spies” is how Sir James reacts to the technology of Cold War agents, and indeed, Vesper Lynd`s (Ursula Andress) billions and Dr. Noah`s (Woody Allen) confused attempt to gain global control through germ warfare/robot master race/nuclear threat are no match for Sir James`s stiff upper lip. Like a demonstration of the failed theories of limited nuclear war, the power-hungry are annihilated in attempting to make the world safe for themselves. Woody Allen`s sex-hungry schlemiel persona may have already been standard expectation in 1967, but here, garbed in a Mao suit, he suggests the infantile psychosexual complexes behind the vengeful modern warlord. Allen detests the film and takes little pride in his creation of Dr. Noah, but his own Third-World farce Bananas, and the futuristic totalitarian satire Sleeper, seem to spring from the still edgy political black comedy of his self-written role in Casino Royale.\n\nThis ingredient works at a physiological level in treating erection problems.

Chlamydias djpaulkom.tv viagra wholesale are microscope pathogens which are different from both bacteria and virus. To understand Casino Royale as a courtly adventure–Niven`s Sir James as Siegfried, Arthur, Barbarossa, or Parsifal, a figure the German Romantics called the Welterzieher–the knightly poet who is fated to lead the world to a new golden age–is to see the chivalric genealogy of the idealism surrounding the James Bond phenomenon. Without the use of Connery`s modern update however, Casino Royale taps directly into the messianic concept at the root of 007: Sir James is resurrected to save a blundering world with its collective fingers on the nuclear button, but extinguishes himself in the final battle, one that might lead humanity to a new beginning. The film has a heavy medieval, even biblical feel: the brilliance of Richard Williams`s illuminated-manuscript titles; the testing of Sir Jamess purity at the debauched castle of M`s impersonated widow (Deborah Kerr); the Faustian redemption of Vesper because she has “loved”; the representatives from the world`s powers (here it is the four Kings) who beg for the grace and wisdom of a knight of the (black) rose. M (John Huston), like post-Profumo scandal Britain, is a façade of majesty resigned to his own inadequacy. LeGrand of the French Cinquieme Bureau (Charles Boyer) is obsessed with absurdity. Ransome (William Holden) is a source of arrogant and undecipherable CIA double-talk, and KGB head Smernov (Kurt Kasznar) spews Marxist jargon as he cowers from the monarchist symbolism of a lion. That these pathetic emissaries are unknowingly helping evil, aiding Dr. Noah`s wish to expose and destroy his childhood idol–or as Sir James puts it, “to make up for feelings of sexual inferiority”–is a subtext engineered to hold the ever-more-distant plot stations (and Sir James`s Stations of the Cross) together into a consistent whole. And the film, with all its ideas, directions, and visions, seems to relish its own sprawling, about-to-fly-apart structure, folding over and under itself as medieval epics do and reflecting the serpentines of the art nouveau so present in several of the film`s sets.\n\nThe mythical French casino itself provides a semiotic mapping of the film`s subversion of the modern establishment. Below the bourgeois finery of the palatial building and an art collection spanning the century (read: Western elitism), a female army garbed in Paco Rabanne`s gladiator uniforms, an extension of the designer`s actual mid-60s metallic fashions, relates the modern power structure to the barbarism of ancient (and anti-Judeo-Christian) Rome. With their leader, Dr. Noah, acting on behalf of a vaguely Soviet SMERSH but interested only in his own gratification, the static Cold War ideologies become reflections that turn on themselves. The Berlin sequence summarizes Germany as the focal wound of political folly: the Wall divides a sex-crazed West from a silent and red-lit East (both deemed political whores), while the sinister Frau Hoffner (Anna Quayle), Polo (Ronnie Corbett), and Sir James`s prodigal daughter by Mata Hari (Joanna Pettet) flirt on the edge of the nuclear Goetterdammerung in a stunning parody of The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari. Like the question of sanity raised in that Expressionist classic, Frau Hoffner`s “very democratic” espionage school, which trains “Russian spies for America and American spies for Russia,” suggests the entire world is the asylum. The film features the music of Burt Bacharach and Debussy, as well as Michael Stringer`s wide catalogue of sets ranging from a Palladian estate to an East Asian temple, all linked by heraldic tones of orange/pink and blue/green. So much art, so much architecture, so many sideswipe references to high culture. Too rich for a simple spy saga, this stylistic puzzle instead implies what is at stake in the battle between the “immaculate priesthood” of the individualistic and genteel Sir James and the false promise of social Darwinist technocrats.\n\nThe failure of modernity and a celebration of what Umberto Eco would call the postmodern “crisis of reason” permeates nearly every scene of Casino Royale. The false widow of M espouses the heroic deeds of “her” Scottish ancestors, turns her back on high-tech spying for the love of the hero, and, quoting Robert Burns, retreats to a convent. The remote-controlled, dynamite-loaded milk truck finds the wrong target, while Le Chiffre`s “torture of the mind,” which conjures associations with trendy psychiatry and military LSD experimentation, is an utter failure. Dr. Noah`s flying saucer symbolically displaces the icon of Lord Nelson in Trafalgar Square (already bought and removed by Vesper) with a futuristic technology used to kidnap and torture Mata Bond. All the “weapons of our time,” which Sir James is encouraged to use, are disasters.\n\nAlthough she is saved from a descent into damnation, Vesper is perhaps the most challenging of all the modernist images in the film. This femme fatale character (she has Sellers`s Bond and still kills him), along with, as the ad for the film proclaimed, “a Bondwagon of the most beautiful and talented girls you ever saw,” attempts to defeat the objectification of the female so prevalent in the “real” Bond. What it instead offers is a male sex-fantasy of women`s liberation and a female impersonation of the worst aspects of James Bond`s Playboy philosophy. The deadly women are foiled at every turn, not by contemporary man, but by the Edwardian guardian of gentlemanly tradition, Sir James. Yet he is not a misogynist and actively recruits women, including his daughter, to help the cause.\n\nAn icon of worship as the name implies, Vesper disposes of her enemies in a kitchen process that offers an update of concentration camp stratagems. She clearly represents a fascist modernism that places itself into history and glitters, but which must also destroy all that inhibits the New Order. At home in her Olympus-like arena of world control, a pagan goddess shrouded in feathers and surrounded by Greco-Roman art, she poses an immediate opposition to Sir Jamess Christian nature. She ultimately descends from the heights (the moving conversation pit) to give herself to a mere mortal (Sellers) in order to bend more than his ear. The image of Hitler descending from the clouds to those who would do his bidding in Leni Riefenstahl`s Triumph of the Will springs to mind here. Sellers`s subsequent impersonation of that dictator, Napoleon, a British officer, and Toulouse Lautrec (Euroculture again) for Vesper`s camera (Riefenstahl again) is the very message of her madness: seduction, deception, and image make the modern superman/woman. Compared to her sophisticated ammunition, Q`s outfitting of the new Bond seems needless by comparison. As “the richest spy in the world,” Vesper is both capitalist and pragmatist. Her manipulation and use of male-dominated politics to satisfy her own needs may demonstrate the female as “outside” male society, but the multitude of women in the service of male megalomania in this film have yet to know they are an enslaved “class of woman,” as feminist theoretician Monique Wittig insists. The Detainer (Daliah Lavi), whose sexuality is her only weapon but who doesn`t really “do anything” as she waits for male self-destruction, perhaps points to future realization when she regards Allen`s phallocratic leader manqué as a “wretched, grotesque, ridiculous, insignificant little monster.”\n\nObviously inspired by Stanley Kubrick`s Dr. Strangelove (Terry Southern also contributed uncredited material to Casino Royale), the Berlin war room attempts to both enjoy and slam female objectification as the four superpowers bid for pornographic blackmail material. The auction that so easily turns to “war” is upset by a woman–the scantily-clad Mata Bond, who punctuates the slapstick struggle with her own vocalization of such cartoon effects as “zap!” and “pow!” Her victory is perhaps more the result of her mythic lineage than of her Twiggy-era liberation, but one message is clear: the Cold War is a comic strip that can only be dealt with accordingly. There is little to trust, even less to believe in. The reiteration of this point comes with the spoof on the ritual Bond film battle finale–here played as the apocalypse à go-go. Everyone and everything is thrown into the maelstrom of this Western brawl as nuclear war epitome, but only the messiah and his followers are worthy of ascension; the usurper (Woody Allen) sinks into flames. There is a literal deus ex machina (the forces of “good” parachuting into the Casino), but the conclusion, which critics at the time read as plot exhaustion, is completely loyal to the metaphysics of the film: the tale, which began in the clouds concludes in self- sacrificing heavenly victory. Although this denigration of modernity in favor of divinity and mythos also suggests a false totality, the illusion of wholeness found in fascist ideology, the not-so-tongue-in-cheek Romanticism here pays homage to a much earlier and more benevolent imperialistic nature, Sir Jamess Pax Britannia and a laissez faire elitism.\n\nSome critical utterances in film study seem to hold curious sway long after they have been proven questionable or have even been overturned. Susan Sontag`s misunderstanding of Leni Riefenstahl is one such notorious example. Similarly, Leslie Halliwell`s view that Casino Royale was a huge shapeless romp “put together with paste at a late night party” still discounts the film more than thirty years later. The critics who deride the film in their examinations of the careers of Woody Allen and Peter Sellers only encourage the politically correct scholarly silence surrounding the film. Having attempted the first analysis of the work in Films in Review in 1988, I am happy to note, however, that a thaw has begun. In 1999, the American Movie Classics (AMC) cable television channel presented Casino Royale with something akin to serious commentary.\n\nThere is a definite trajectory in the development of the sociopolitical satire of the 1960s from Billy Wilder`s One, Two, Three (1961) to the indulgence of Candy (1968) to the burn-out of The Magic Christian (1970), which locates Casino Royale as the apex and the most successful reflection of the era`s anarchic impulses. In this respect, the film has no fewer teeth than Godard`s New Wave attack on capitalist society, Weekend, which was released the same year. It is never claimed as an inspiration or influence, yet Monty Python, the subversive parodies of Mel Brooks, the manic visuals of 60s inspired music videos and the Gen X and Y films they inspire, are all heirs to Casino Royale. Their creators would have had to invent the film if it hadn`t existed. Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery is case in point. Having lifted at least half of Casino Royale to make his film an “homage” to 60`s spy spoofs (though he claims inspiration instead from Our Man Flint), Mike Myers` Austin Powers has introduced a new generation to the delights of the original, albeit through an impersonation diluted with too much Matt Helm and the worst of MTV toilet humor. Although the film seems to yearn for the prototype`s set pieces and its literate pop-apocalypse, it overkills with garish tones for fear that the concept might be lost on a market too young to remember or too attention deficient to understand. This self-conscious and simplistic imitation imparts nothing so much as the sentiment that there is no going home. The original already claimed that fact as its self-ironic starting point. And Myers is not the only one attempting to reinvent the event: the “real” Bond series has been taking dialogue and mimicking sets from Casino Royale since the 1970s, and now larger elements can be found in the The Fifth Element, The Avengers, The World is Not Enough, and a half-dozen other cinema adventures. They remain uncharted because of the critical neglect of the original. These re-visions also pale because, like Casablanca, Casino Royale is a film of momentary vision, collaboration, adaptation, pastiche, and accident. It is the anti-auteur work of all time, a film shaped by the very Zeitgeist it took on. As a compendium of what almost went too wrong in the twentieth century done up as a burlesque of the knightly epic, it may still frighten the modernists, but those who follow should consider it to be quite sagacious.\n\n–Casino Royale, always the black sheep of the Bonds, is officially out of print on VHS but is now available on DVD yet. VHS and laserdisc copies can be had at many video rental stores. (Dont confuse the 1967 film with Barry Nelsons 1950’s TV version of Casino Royale!)"
