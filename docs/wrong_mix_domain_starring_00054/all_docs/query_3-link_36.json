        "text": "Q. Was \"The Lone Ranger\" the first TV Western serial? Did Clayton Moore ever star in anything else? I can remember him only as the Lone Ranger. - F.L., Los Alamitos, Calif.\n\nA. \"Ranger\" was the first Western serial produced for television. It bowed in prime time on ABC Sept. 15, 1949. But William Boyd's \"Hopalong Cassidy\" was seen on New York TV as early as 1945 and became a local series in 1948. On June 24, 1949, it bowed as an NBC series. But those were all edited versions of Boyd's old theatrical movies with new narration and a few added scenes. It wasn't until 1951 that Boyd made shows for TV. Moore started in the movies in 1939, did various roles until he left for service in 1943. He went into Westerns and serials in 1946, working for several studios but, after 1949, when he did his first Lone Ranger, he never did another role.Q. Didn't Olivia d'Abo of the '60s-throwback \"The Wonder Years\" grow up in a hippie family?\n\nA. D'Abo's parents were part of the \"Swinging Sixties\" scene in London, not the conservative suburban America of the ABC show. Her father was lead singer for the rock group Manfred Mann, and her mother, Maggie London, appeared in such films as \"2001: A Space Odyssey\" and the Beatles' \"A Hard Day's Night.\" They moved to Taos, N.M., in the '70s. \"I became like a little flower child,\" recalls d'Abo, 22. Coincidentally, her longtime companion is pop star Julian Lennon.\n\nQ. Isn't Beverly D'Angelo disappointed she hasn't achieved superstar status?\n\nA. She's philosophical - and persistent. \"I guess I'm the actress who won't go away,\" she says. \"I didn't have a game plan,\" but \"doing the `National Lampoon's Vacation' movies gave me freedom to do independent films I couldn't otherwise afford to do.\" Besides, she says, \"my priority has always been my personal life.\" Until recently, D'Angelo, 37, lived in Italy with her former husband, an Italian duke. Her latest film was \"The Miracle\"; next comes the comedy \"The Pope Must Die,\" then \"Man Trouble,\" with Jack Nicholson and Ellen Barkin.\n\nQ. Has \"The Rifleman\" Chuck Connors bowed out of acting?\n\nA. Hardly. Connors, 70, is putting together a project, \"Grandpa Hawk,\" which he calls \"a Grandpa Rambo-type\" movie. He also will appear in Kenny Rogers' miniseries \"Luck of the Draw: The Gambler Returns\" and in the film \"Salmonberries,\" both due out this fall.\n\nQ. How did Laura Dern manage to escape the film fluff of some Hollywood Brat Packers?\n\nA. She always was older than her years. Dern is the daughter of actors Bruce Dern and Diane Ladd, pros who were more interested in substance than glamour. \"They were always very passionate about their work, and that's a cool thing to be around,\" says Dern, who made up her mind at age 9 to be an actor. When they separated a few years after she was born, she lived primarily among adults. \"I never felt cheated out of my adolescence,\" Dern explains. Adds her dad: \"She's always had a kind of an old soul, a mature soul.\" Her seriousness of purpose led to chancy parts in movies like \"Mask,\" \"Blue Velvet,\" \"Wild at Heart\" and her newest, \"Rambling Rose.\"\n\nQ. After all those years in rock 'n' roll, is pop star Michael Bolton disturbed that his new audience is mainly women?\n\nA. \"My success happened when I stopped giving away my love songs. That's when I developed a largely female audience,\" says Bolton, 38, who once had a rock group, Blackjack, and wrote hits for divas like Cher and Barbra Streisand. Women, he says, \"love romance. They love to talk about feelings. They love emotion. . . . Men are still embarrassed to deal with this. . . . A lot of men don't have any idea how women lose it for a man who is able to express his own sensitivity, his own vulnerability. . . . Unfortunately, they have to settle for what they're getting these days. The whole macho mentality is an unfortunate thing.\" Bolton hit No. 1 on the Billboard charts last spring with his single \"Love Is a Wonderful Thing.\"\n\nQ. Tell me about Wanda in \"Doogie Howser, M.D.\" What's her real name and where can I write her? - F.D., Lapeer, Mich.\n\nA. Lisa Dean Ryan, 18, was born in Los Angeles, started acting professionally in high school, doing TV and commercials. She's been in \"America's Most Wanted,\" \"A Year in the Life,\" \"21 Jump Street.\" Write: 20th Century Fox, Box 900, Bevelry Hills, Calif. 90213.\n\nQ. Where can I write the \"Home\" program on ABC mornings? With their new format, they've managed to ruin one of the best programs and the most interesting. I hear Gary Collins may be going and he's the best. I can't warm up to Beth Ruyak. I don't tune in anymore. - D.M., Lorain, Ohio.\n\nA. ABC figured 1990s homemakers weren't interested in homey subjects and switched to a more newsy format. So far Collins is hanging in there but there have been rumbles about his departure. Send your comments to Michael Brockman, vice president daytime programs, ABC Entertainment, 2040 Avenue of the Stars, Los Angeles, CA 90067.\n\nQ. Whatever happened to the actor who played Little Luke McCoy on \"The Real McCoys\"? - C.J.S., DePere, Wis.\n\nA. Michael Winkleman was Little Luke. He left the show in 1962, the year before the series ended. There are no credits for him since.\n\nQ. For years I have been trying to find out the name of the music on \"Highway to Heaven.\" Tell me the name of this song and where I can buy the record. - S.P., Rochester Hills, Mich.\n\nA. David Rose wrote the original music for the series, seen 1984-89. The theme has no special name and it hasn't been recorded, according to NBC.\n\nQ. Tell me about Mark Harmon. I heard he'll be starring in a new series this fall with Marlee Matlin. - J.S., Northhampton, Pa.\n\nA. Harmon is a detective and Matlin is an assistant district attorney in NBC's upcoming \"Reasonable Doubt.\" It's Harmon's fifth series. The others: \"Sam,\" \"Flamingo Road,\" \"240 Robert\" and \"St. Elsewhere.\" Harmon was born Sept. 2, 1951, in Los Angeles, son of the late football star Tom Harmon and former movie starlet Elyse Knox. He was a star quarterback at UCLA and started acting in college. He made his TV debut in \"Ozzie's Girls\" (sister Kristen was married to Rick Nelson, son of Ozzie Nelson). He has a 1977 Emmy nomination for \"Eleanor and Franklin: The White House Years.\" After leaving \"St. Elsewhere,\" he concentrated on TV movies, among them \"Dillinger,\" \"Long Road Home,\" \"Shadow of a Doubt.\" He's married to Pam Dawber and the father of Sean, 5.\n\nQ. What was the full name of Topper on the old TV show of the same name? My husband says it was William; I say it was Cosmo. We know Leo G. Carroll played the role. - G.B., Gastonia, N.C.\n\nA. It was Cosmo from Thorne Smith's original story through the 1937 movie, two sequels, the TV series and the 1979 TV movie. Roland Young played Cosmo Topper in the early features, Jack Warden in the TV movie.\n\nQ. My family and I enjoy \"In Living Color\" very much. We wonder who plays Homey the clown. - A.C., Brighton, Mich.\n\nA. Damon Wayans is Homey. He's also critic Blaine; Whiz, co-host of the Homeboy Shopping Network; Anton, the homeless man, and many others on the show.\n\nQ. I'm a big fan of Anne-Marie Johnson and the lady who plays Harriet DeLong on NBC's \"In the Heat of the Night.\" What are their ages and where can I write to them? - M.R., Cheriton, Va.\n\nA. Johnson is 30; Denise Nicholas, who plays Harriet, is 47. Write: MGM/UA Television, 10202 W. Washington Blvd., Culver City, CA 90230.\n\nQ. Tell me about Linda Blair: her age, the college she attended, movies she's done. - L.M., Philadelphia.\n\nA. Blair is 32, never attended college. She made her feature debut in \"The Way We Live Now\" in 1970. \"The Exorcist\" in 1973 was her third movie and she had an Oscar nomination for it. Since then, she's made a string of 23 forgettable movies, many of which even she admits were bombs. In July, cable's Movie Channel showed a batch of Blair movies and Showtime came up with \"Repossessed,\" a spoof of \"The Exorcist\" in August. She has a feature, \"Dead Sleep,\" and a cable movie, \"Fatal Bond,\" due later this year.\n\n- Send your questions to Celebrity Questions, Detroit Free Press, Detroit, MI 48231."
