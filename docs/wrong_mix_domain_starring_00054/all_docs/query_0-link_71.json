        "text": "Story Eighteen:\n\nBlack Widow\n\n(Russian babe Natalia Romanova gets her very first spotlight series!)\n\nMain Voice Cast:\n\nNatalia Alianova Romanova/Black Widow: Olivia D'Abo\n\nGeneral Nick Fury: Andre Ware\n\nJessica Drew/Spider-Woman: Alyssa Milano (recurring interconnecting role with her own series.)\n\nDr. Tania Belinskaya: Maryam D'Abo (recurring role)\n\nEpisode One: The Widow In Black, The Spider in Red\n\nJessica Drew guest stars in this crossover origin episode about one of the most alluring and beautiful Russian superheroines in the Marvel Universe. It is thirteen years after the debacle which led to the bitter relationship between Natalia Romanoff and Jessica Drew, as the two women are now SHIELD agents, and old wounds start to fester as Natalia meets Jessica for the first time in thirteen years at Le Klub Kool to tell her former friend the real story of how the both of them got their powers and abilities as sickly children. The similarities between their dark origins are almost uncanny as the two tell their stories of how they emerged from the same experiment that was conducted by Jonathan Drew for two different world powers at the same time in the same year, and how Natalia, later a promising 15-year ballerina, and Jessica, a 15-year-old cheerleader, were recruited by the Taskmaster to train with him to serve in two of the most dangerous organizations at the time: HYDRA and the KGB, and the different paths they took after that which led to the present day. It's both the Marvel True Superhero Story of the Black Widow and the MTSS update on the spectacular Spider-Woman, all in this one hour episode!\n\nEpisode Two: The Return of Julia Carpenter\n\nNow called Natalie Roman (Americanized from her real name, Natalia Romanoff), and as this story continues, she and Jessica find themselves involved in a mission to find their best friend, Julia Cornwall (Jennifer Hale), who they also haven't seen in almost a decade and a half! But, when they find her in Denver, Colorado, she is now called Julia Carpenter, and has an eight-year-old daughter, Rachel (Dakota Fanning), from a failed marriage. But thing go from bad to worse, as Rachel is kidnapped by that rat-bast**d Ringmaster (Cliff De Young) and his wife, Princess Python (Fairuza Balk), when the Circus of Crime come to town looking for more children to kill since their last failed attempt in New York's Hell's Kitchen in the Daredevil spotlight two segments ago! Can the Black Widow and Spider-Woman help Julia rescue Rachel from this maniacal circus before she becomes their next victim?\n\nEpisode Three: The Red Guardian Reborn\n\nActresses and real-life cousins Olivia and Maryam D'Abo lend their voices in this episode which finds Natalia dealing with the return of the Russian killing machine Omega Red (Ralf Moeller) as he makes his appearance in the United States to assassinate the princess of Morvania, Adrianna (Cathianne Blore), when she visits for a peace summit between the two nations. But, there's a new Russian superheroine named the Red Guardian that has arrived, and it's triggered Natalia's memories of her late husband, Alexei Shostakov, the first Red Guardian! But, will this newbie be able to help the Black Widow protect Princess Adrianna from the menace of Omega Red at the United Nations, or is Tania Belinskaya's days numbered? Plus, what is the connection between this Morvanian teen princess and a certain American lookalike girl named Kimber?\n\nEpisode Four: The Widow, The Princess, and the Party Girl\n\nRemember Adrianna and Kimber, the two redheads mentioned in the last episode? Well, Princess Adrianna is about to meet a 15-year-old high-school student last seen in the Civil War and Elektra spotlights, as news of Adrianna's visit to New York hits Forest Hills, and she wants her favorite singer, Jacqui \"Jem\" Benton (Marlene Aragon), to make a command appearance at the Morvanian consulate! But, add an appearance by Kimber (Kelly Sheridan) and Mary Jane Watson (Jennifer Hale), at Princess Adrianna's event, and Natalia's assignment to protect the princess turns into the first-ever meeting of \"The League of Ravishing Redheads\" when the three redheaded girls end up helping the Black Widow (herself a redhead!) and Jem deal with the menace of the Titanium Man when he crashes the party! Where's Iron Man when you need him?\n\nEpisode Five: When Redheads and Rocker Chicks Attack!\n\nThings go from bad to extremely worse, as this storyline comes to a close when Kimber, Mary Jane and Adrianna successfully help Natalia and Kimber's mother Jacqui take the Titanium Man down, only to find all of them dealing with the arrival of a top-level SHIELD liaison to G.I. Joe named Alison Hart-Burnett, aka Lady Jaye (Lisa Ann Beley), and the appearance of a very dangerous Australian biker gang called the Dreadnoks when they arrive in the U.S.! But, what do they have to do with the Titanium Man's appearance at the party, and a 16-year-old pink-haired Goth girl named Zarana that Kimber met during Jacqui's performance that's got even the Black Widow concerned? Only in the Marvel Universe, folks!...\n\nNext: The Punisher\n\nTopic: Civil War and the new Ultimate Marvel Animated Universe - Part Three\n\nKEM here.\n\nToday we're gonna focus on what is to be the longest-standing group of Hasbro characters that had their comic-book origins grounded in the Marvel Universe for more than a decade, the Real American Heroes known as...\n\nG.I. Joe\n\nGroup: Marvel Universe/S.H.I.E.L.D.\n\nYO JOE!!! It's a battle cry synonymous with a group of hard-charging, fighting men and women of the United States Armed Forces we've come to know as G.I. JOE, as they fight the diabolical forces of the subversive organization known as COBRA today as they did in the 1980's.\n\nBut, today's G.I. JOE animated series are getting plain-jane ridiculous, and it's time to end Paramount's and 4Kids' reign over the series, and for Hasbro to give Marvel one more chance to go back to the basic original characters that made this funky series great.\n\nIf I were to restart a Joe series, give us back the original format of the series, but with one slight and necessary change: Make the Joe organization a sister unit of SHIELD. (Yes, but under the military command of General Clayton Abernathy (Hawk), who shares the same five-star rank as General Nicholas Fury of SHIELD). In fact, both groups can work together on difficult missions involving COBRA, HYDRA, AIM, and many of the Marvel Universe's most dangerous villains.\n\nAs for the basic roster line-up, Master Sergeant Conrad S. Hauser (Duke), Lt. Dashiell Faireborn (Flint), Specialist Alison Hart-Burnett (Lady Jaye), and Specialist Shana O'Hara (Scarlett), as well as Gunnery Sergeant Marvin S. Hinton (Roadblock), Lt. Hector Delgado (Shipwreck), Army Medical Specialist Carl W. Greer (Doc), and Night Infiltration Specialist Cooper MacBride (Low-Light) are the main characters that help lead the team, since they are also SHIELD agents.\n\nThere are so many more Joes in this group, including Beach Head, Gung Ho, Rock and Roll, Lifeline, Cover-Girl, Bazooka, Alpine, Ace, Wet-Suit, Deep-Six, Dusty, Heavy Duty, Tunnel Rat and Cutter, that it would take a good long post to name them all.\n\nBut besides those listed, there are two very important teams that work within the Marvel Universe as part of the Joe squad that are responsible for assisting the MU's heroes and mutants whenever the main Joe squad is not needed. They are:\n\nNinja Force: This stealth infiltration and reconnaisance force is the Joe team's deadliest group. Led by the silent ninja Snake-Eyes, it consists of Quick-Kick, Wind Saber, Jinx and Kamakura, and are sometimes joined by Marvel martial-arts heroes Shang-Chi and Iron Fist when needed.\n\nSlaughter's Marauders: This group of super-strong misfits are the rogue unit of G.I. Joe, and come in for the dirtiest assignments. Currently, the group consists of Sergeant Slaughter, Mercer, Red Dog, Taurus, Big Lob, Law and Order, and Chuckles. Marvel's contributors to this group are Free Spirit, Jack Flag, Skids, Frog-Man, and Rusty Collins.\n\nSpeaking of which, Joe's involvement in the Marvel Civil War will be on three fronts: to help SHIELD gather unregistered heroes and train them for G.I. JOE and other government agencies, help Captain America deal with the ongoing mess involving the heroes themselves, and to stop the amassed recruitment of Marvel's superpowered and mutant population by COBRA and its allies. But, are these guys biting off more than they can chew?\n\nNext Hasbro Spotlight: Transformers Universe\n\nStory Nineteen:\n\nFrank Castle: The Punisher\n\n(Marvel's most dangerous anti-hero in his very first animated Spotlight!)\n\nVoice Cast:\n\nFrank Castle (nee Castiglione)/The Punisher: Thomas Jane\n\nEpisode One: A Soldier's Justice\n\nIn this one-hour premiere episode, meet Lt. Col. Frank Castle, decorated Marine hero of Desert Storm and former police officer with the New York City Police Department. When his wife and two children are gunned down by gangland thugs working for the Kingpin (Roscoe Lee Browne), and the police fail to do anything about it, not to mention kick him off the force for suspicious reasons, Frank must resort to his own brand of vigilante justice in his new guise as the Punisher!\n\nEpisode Two: Bullets and Blades\n\nThe Punisher finds himself caught up in a war involving a powerful ninja clan and the Japanese Yakuza when he meets a young girl named Kimiko Arashikage (Shu Qi). There's one thing though: Kimiko is the 17-year old baby sister of Thomas Arashikage (Francois Chau), the ninja assassin known as Stormshadow! And when you add his hated rival Snake-Eyes to the mix in this martial-arts adventure, there's gonna be a lot more bodies added to the death toll when Frank, Stormshadow, and Snake-Eyes get finished with the Yakuza's hired assassins in this episode!\n\nEpisode Three: The Devil's Advocate\n\nMatt Murdock (Edward L. Albert) guest stars in an adventure which finds Frank at odds with the Man Without Fear, Daredevil, when the two heroes find themselves dealing with a dangerous government assassin and drug addict named Nuke (Henry Rollins) after he murders the five-year-old son of a prominent New York congressman fighting to get a child protection law passed in the State Congress! But, will Daredevil and the Punisher's ideological differences get in the way of their mission of justice?\n\nEpisode Four: Jigsaw\n\nFrank's military past comes back to haunt him when he deals with an ex-Marine who has turned to a life of crime. But the real shocker comes when he is face-to-face with the man, now called Jigsaw (John Beck), who has put a bounty on Frank for accidentally disfiguring him in a botched mission during Desert Storm. Now, the Punisher must bring him down before he kills a group of people on a tour bus in this harrowing adventure!\n\nEpisode Five: A Tale of Two Franks\n\nFrank Martin (Jason Statham), the Transporter, makes his very first appearance in the Punisher series as he is involved in teaming up with another man named Frank - Frank Castle - in bringing down an ex-Royal Air Force commander turned bioterrorist named Major Sebastian Bludd (Michael Dobson), who plans to release a deadly new viral weapon upon both the United States and the United Kingdom in 24 hours, resulting in the deaths of five million people in both countries combined in this special episode!\n\nNext: TTA: Civil War - Arc Two\n\nTopic: Civil War and the new Ultimate Marvel Animated Universe, Part Three\n\nKEM here:\n\nHypesters, Part three of this cross-universe topic brings us to what is the most popular Hasbro characters in the last 22 years, and the group that brings the entire Marvel superhero universe together if things go my way. You know them, you love them, it's those crazy guys from the planet Cybertron known as the...\n\nTransformers\n\nGroup: The entire Marvel Universe, nuff said!\n\nYou know the story: a battle on Cybertron between two warring factions, the Autobots, led by Optimus Prime, and the Decepticons, led by Megatron. Suddenly, the two groups bring their battle to Earth, four million years after they crashlanded on our planet! Now the real fun begins.\n\nEven though I'm enjoying Transformers Cybertron on Cartoon Network right now, I am longing for the return of the original bad-ass Sunbow/Marvel series from 1984-1988 on that same channel. And, even though IDW is doing the current adventures in comic form, many Transfans out there would like to see Marvel Comics get back in Hasbro's good graces concerning the Robots In Disguise. 'Nuff Said!\n\nMy idea for Marvel's return of the Transformers is the same as before, but with a few twists: Optimus and the old gang are still there, but now they are joined by his life-mate Alita-One and her band of female Transformers, including her little sister Arcee. Plus, all of the TF Autobots have adopted brand-new vehicle forms based on real-life automobile models, a la Transformers Alternators/Binaltech (Check out Ironhide's life-mate Chromia as the new black Misfits Van from \"Jem\" in a future TF story in the Marvel Spotlight).\n\nAs for the Decepticons, Megatron's still a Walther P38 pistol, but a with a catch: when merged with a large tank, his spark is transferred to the tank mode, turning him into a Super-sized robot with the pistol as a weapon. He can transform into robot mode in both versions. The other Decepticons have vehicle modes based on military vehicles used by the U.S. Armed Forces and various Marvel Universe terrorist organizations. You want female Decepticons, you got 'em, as Megatron has his own female counterpart in Lady Nightbird, who is a COBRA Nightraven S3P Stratofighter, and just as deadly as she is bewitchingly beautiful in robot mode!\n\nBased on the fact that Spider-Man made an appearance in TF#2 in '84, I think that Transformers has a rich history with the MU and that more of the human heroes and villains of the MU should make appearances in this animated series, a move that was not made in the show's original run. (Imagine heroes like Iron Man and the X-Men in episodes of Transformers!).\n\nWhich leads me to the creation of a sub-group of Autobots and Decepticons that act within the Marvel Universe called the Shape-Shifters. They are specialized robot Sentinels outfitted with Cybertronian technology attuned to the individual Marvel hero or villain (Spider-Man's Autobot counterpart becomes his Spider-Mobile, or the Fantastic Four's Fantasticar becomes an Autobot Transformer.) Imagine the possibilities! It's something Hasbro must think about when they decide to expand their TF line to include Marvel characters in 2007.\n\nThe Witwicky family and the Bentons (again, from Jem) are the main characters in the fanfic series, but the first real test for the Robots in Disguise will be in Civil War, as Tony Stark, Iron Man, makes a shady deal with Megatron that could have dire consequences for human, superhuman, mutant and Transformer alike as the Superhuman Registration Act is passed, leading to a myriad of situations that will bring this whole deal to its penultimate conclusion when the final shot is fired, affecting everyone involved!\n\nNext Hasbro Spotlight: Visionaries: Knights of the Magical Light\n\nStory Twenty:\n\nTales to Astonish: Civil War-Arc Two\n\n(The journey to the new Ultimate Marvel Animated Universe continues)\n\nVoice Cast: Already announced in Arc One.\n\nEpisode Six: Unmaskings and Revelations\n\nThe road to Civil War heats up as Peter Parker finally reveals to the whole world that he is Spider-Man. Meanwhile, the Superhuman Registration Act is passed, which sets in motion the Beyonder's plans for the 616 Universe! Later, at Le Klub Kool, Pizzazz and the Misfits are witnesses to her cousin Johnny Storm getting beat up by pro-Registration forces, escalating the rocker chicks and their punk-rock allies into a full-blown brawl with the people involved, resulting in the deaths of 100 people at the club and a violent showdown with Sentinels from the Office of National Emergency under the command of James Rhodes! And if that's not enough, just as J. Jonah Jameson is about to expose Peter Parker in the media, the Daily Bugle is mysteriously bought from under him by a slimy Hollywood tabloid king named Pitt Slurmann (Christopher Daniel Barnes), who quickly ousts JJJ as publisher of the Bugle! But, who is Pitt Slurmann, and what is his connection to Peter Parker? Could he be really his cousin Ben Reilly, the original Scarlet Spider, who retired a few years ago? And, who are the twin redheads Crystal and Cassandra Kane, and what is their connection to both Kimber Benton and a top-secret Stark Enterprises special-weapons program called the Centurion Project? Can you say \"PowerXtreme?\"\n\nEpisode Seven: Civil Liberties\n\nThe attack on the Sentinel Squad by the Misfits, and other attacks by anti-Registration forces, have given Captain America the courage to choose a side when just as new SHIELD director Maria Hill wants Cap and the G.I.
