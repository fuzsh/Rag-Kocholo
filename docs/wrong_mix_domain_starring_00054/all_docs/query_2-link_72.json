But in actual fact, he doesn't turn out to have died, and like Spock, makes a return from the dead. In fact, Jake has faked his death. Much to his chagrin, his wife Bill attended as Beverly Crusher despite Ben's insistence the funeral was \"strictly old series\".\n\n\"Seven Dials\"[]\n\nAnother episode featuring Jake the Klingon, Ben's rival. This episode has more of a Prisoner theme than a Trek one though.\n\n\"The Man Who Knew Too Much\"[]\n\nThis episode is laden with science fiction references, and again features Jake the Klingon.\n\n30 Rock[]\n\nFeaturing Whoopi Goldberg, Victor Garber, Scott Lawrence, the Beastie Boys, John Cho, Maulik Pancholy and Padma Lakshmi.\n\nIn \"The Head and the Hair\", Liz Lemon compares a handsome guy's eyes to the tractor beam of the Death Star, at which point Jenna Maroney interrupts with \"\"No Liz, do not talk about stuff like that on your date. Guys like that do not like Star Trek\", which Liz angrily corrects as \"\"Wars!\".\n\nIn \"Believe in the Stars\", Tracy says he watched Boston Legal nine times before realizing it wasn't a new Star Trek (presumably due to it starring William Shatner).\n\nIn \"Reunion\" Tracy Jordan asks an elevator \"\"How come they're aren't any Puerto Ricans on Star Trek!? They got every race and life-form in the galaxy, except for Puerto Ricans! What's up with that?!\"\n\n\"Lee Marvin vs. Derek Jeter\"[]\n\nSeveral new nicknames are suggested for Toofer, including Splock, which comes from \"black Spock\".\n\n\"Emanuelle Goes To Dinosaur Land\"[]\n\nTracy Jordan is revealed to have grown up on the corner of 157th Street and Lieutenant Uhura Avenue (of New York). Note that this is apparently a real street, or rather a nickname for the real Convent Avenue. [1]\n\n3rd Rock from the Sun[]\n\nWith recurring roles for William Shatner, Shay Astar and Jim Beaver.\n\n\"Hotel Dick\"[]\n\nFeatures a science fiction convention, at which George Takei makes an appearance, talking about Star Trek.

Kirk (William Shatner) broadcasts from the 23rd century – and on what looks like the USS Enterprise-A's bridge – to prevent host Seth MacFarlane from performing several skits that would cause him to receive poor reviews.\n\nAccording to Jim[]\n\nABC sitcom whose guest stars included Rosalind Chao, and Nana Visitor.\n\n\"Wedding Bell Blues\" (S04E27)[]\n\nAndy recalls a friend in his sci-fi film club becoming a starship chaplain online and having married a Klingon and a Romulan to each other, constituting what \"the Federation is all about\", according to Andy.\n\n\"The Stick\" (S05E14)[]\n\nAndy, the sci-fi buff, admits of having sci-fi themed \"mantasies\", one of them featuring a man dressed as a 24th century yellow Starfleet officer, and another dressed as a Klingon.\n\n\"The Thin Green Line\" (S05E20)[]\n\nRyan claims to have always wanted to yell, \"KHAAAAANNNN!\", but laments that you can't work it into casual conversation.

Enterprise-D is his room.\n\nAgents of S.H.I.E.L.D.[]\n\nMarvel Comics adaptation featuring Titus Welliver, Ron Glass, Glenn Morshower, Neal McDonough, Brad Dourif, and William Sadler, and occasionally directed by Roxann Dawson and Jonathan Frakes.\n\n\"The Man Behind The Shield\"[]\n\nCoulson says that Ivanov was just another redshirt to him.\n\n\"Rewind\"[]\n\nFitz exasperatedly says \"Beam me up, Scotty\" when being interrogated about the team's disappearance.\n\nAlarm für Cobra 11[]\n\nThis long-running German buddy cop / action series featured a few references. In the 2010 episode \"Tag der Finsternis\", Detective Ben Jäger is attenting his high school reunion where a nerdish former classmate, Nico is nicknamed \"Mr. Spock\" and pranked with a \"F*ck You Mr. Spock\" sign stuck on his back.\n\nIn the 2009 feature-length episode \"Das Ende der Welt\", a billboard advertisement of Star Trek can be seen.\n\nALF[]\n\nALF (which stands for \"Alien Life Form\") is an ET stuck with an earth family in this US sitcom. ALF refers to Captain Kirk in Someone to Watch Over Me: Part 1, and also says \"Hey Scotty, beam me up!\" in \"The Boy Next Door\" episode. In \"Take a look at me Now\", ALF says \"Live long and prosper\" to Raquel; in \"Running Scared\", ALF records a \"captain's log\", and there are several other references to Star Trek in the series.\n\nAll Quiet on the Preston Front[]\n\nThe brainy character Private Simon Matlock is nicknamed Spock.\n\nAll That[]\n\nIn this Nickelodeon comedy show, a frequent sketch, entitled \"USS Spaceship\", was a parody of Star Trek. It featured Captain Tantrum (Amanda Bynes), a child commander of the starship, who got her way by screaming and shouting. The crew encountered various comedic aliens, such as Crouton or the Queen of the Hoganoids, who mostly relented when Captain Tantrum screamed and cried.\n\nAlpha House[]\n\nIn the episode \"The rebuttal\" a poll numbers expert compares a senator's situation to the Kobayashi Maru test.\n\nThe Amanda Show[]\n\n\"Episode 13\"[]\n\nIn the \"Blockblister\" sketch, a woman comes into the store dissapointed that the video she rented is not Star Trek. The Biokey family tells her she actually rented their spoof of Star Trek, Star Drek. When the video is shown, it features Blini and Biscotti acting as crew members in space, Blini pretened to shot Biscotti with her phaser and Bescotti pretending to beam himslf up to the Underprise. When refusing to pay, the customer says \"Live Long and Suffer\" to the family and a customer.\n\nAmerican Housewife[]\n\nStarring Diedrich Bader.\n\nThe second season episode \"Finding Fillion\", which partially takes place at a science-fiction convention, features multiple people wearing Next Generation uniforms, including a teenager dressed up as Data.\n\nAngel[]\n\n\"Sense and Sensitivity\"[]\n\nCordelia states that \"Mr. and Mrs. Spock need to mind meld now\" when referring to Angel and Kate.\n\n\"Hero\"[]\n\nCordelia thinks \"that bald guy from Star Trek\" would make a great narrator, but is not specific as to whom (presumably Patrick Stewart).\n\nAngel of Christmas[]\n\nIn this 2015 TV movie, a character tells another one to \"Enjoy the ride, the destination will unfold\", to which she responds by asking whether he had made it up or stole it from an old Star Trek.\n\nAnimal Practice[]\n\n\"The Two George Colemans\"[]\n\nJuanita, a black woman who's dressed up as Daddy Warbucks, angrily says to a passerby that she isn't \"the captain from Deep Space Nine\".\n\nThe Aquabats! Super Show![]\n\nIn the season two episode \"The Return of the Aquabats!\", the upgraded BattleTram is equipped with missiles with \"NCC-1701\" printed on the sides.\n\nArrested Development[]\n\nIn the episode \"A New Start\", butter is swapped for a Star Trek chess set at a barter-based restaurant called CW Swappigans.\n\nArrow[]\n\nStarring Michael Dorn.\n\nThe Return[]\n\nThe scene with Slade threatening to leave Oliver and Thea imprisoned in his cell on Lian Yu is a reference to Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan, with the quote \"I shall leave you as you left me, as you left her... marooned for all eternity...\".\n\n[]\n\nJessica says she wants to take Moira Queen's place as mayor. On Star Trek Voyager, Jessica's actress Jeri Ryan played a Borg named Seven of Nine and Moira's actress Susanna Thompson played the Borg Queen. There were several episodes where it was said or insinuated that Seven of Nine wanted to take the Borg Queen's place.\n\nBeacon of Hope[]\n\nWhen Thea bursts into Felicity's office just after the latter's mother, she claims that they are like Tribbles, creatures from the Star Trek franchise which are known for their often-excessive reproduction rate. Additionally, when one of the mechanical bees enters Oliver's body and begins replicating, Curtis compares it to Borg, a group of aliens from the same franchise who forcibly transform individuals into drones by injecting nanoprobes into their bodies.\n\nLost in the Flood[]\n\nDuring the hacking battle over Rubicon, Cooper Seldon taunts Felicity that they are going to \"once more unto the breach.\" This is from Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country, which Curtis recognizes.\n\nInvasion![]\n\nCisco refers to the stasis that the heroes are being kept in as \"a little alien, a little Star Trek – J. J. Abrams style\", referring to the 2009 film, Star Trek, and its 2013 sequel, Star Trek Into Darkness, both of which were directed by J. J. Abrams.\n\nAt the Movies[]\n\nIn their syndicated television program, Chicago-based film critics Roger Ebert and Gene Siskel reviewed all Star Trek feature films from Star Trek III: The Search for Spock to Star Trek: Insurrection. After Siskel's death in 1999, Richard Roeper replaced him on the show. Ebert and Roeper reviewed Star Trek Nemesis in 2002.\n\nAttack of the 50 Ft. Woman[]\n\nHBO's 1993 remake of the B-movie classic (featuring William Windom, Hamilton Camp, Hilary Shepard Turner, Stephen Rowe, Patricia Tallman, and Chris Doyle). The last scene features Harry Archer (Daniel Baldwin) and two other husbands in a spaceship, wearing costumes reminiscent of the TOS uniforms.\n\nAttack of the Show![]\n\nThe February 9, 2006 live episode of G4's Attack of the Show! aired a pre-recorded skit making a parody of Star Trek's mirror universe. Kevin Pereira left his office cubicle and walked towards the studio, passing along the way various people doing their jobs, one putting up a poster for a blood drive, and two others shredding papers. Pereira entered the empty sound stage and, looking for something to do, walked through the mysterious door on the back of the set and entered into a bending and wavering corridor, at the opposite end of which one can see an identical door. Kevin went through to the other end into a seemingly identical sound stage and headed back out to the hall where the same employees were toiling away. Only, now they were sporting goatees and carrying out various acts of violence, one employee shredding another's arm in the paper shredder, and another hammering a bloodied animal onto the wall.\n\nThe skit cut to what was presumably that day's later live broadcast. Sarah, Wil, and Brendan were all on the couch answering chat questions. Sarah asks Kevin's answer to a chatter's question regarding the PS3 versus the Xbox 360. Wil hands him a mace upon which he goes to torture the chatter in a segment dubbed \"Fresh Blood,\" in contrast to the normal show's \"Fresh Ink.\" That bit references the fact that they are really tired of receiving that question, as they have mentioned in many shows. Kevin begins to torture the man exclaiming, \"This evil world rules!\"\n\nLater in the real show, a chatter asked Kevin if he found the bearded Sarah sexy. He said yes, claiming that the entire alternate dimension was hotter, trying to make a joke from the fact that he has a goatee in real life. Another chatter asked if Kevin got away with anything in the alternate universe. Kevin claimed he was able to double-dip at the craft service table. (This was even more humorous, as no G4 shows had any form of craft services, only a break room with various forms of free canned sodas.)\n\nAnother episode features the USS AOTS (Nebula-class, no registry number) being attacked by a B'Rel-class Bird-of-Prey. Kevin, Olivia, and two unnamed engineering personnel try to fend off the attack, eventually leading up to the Bird-of-Prey's captain (Wil in Klingon makeup) making demands for a graphic with obscene narration. Despite Kevin apparently being the captain of the USS AOTS, Olivia accepts the demands because she has motion sickness.\n\nDespite the exterior shots depicting a ship whose class was not commissioned until 2357, the uniforms are those from 2265.\n\nB[]\n\nBabylon 5[]\n\nSee main article: Babylon 5.\n\nBad Sugar[]\n\nThis Britcom was never picked up, but the pilot was released. In it, there is a scene in which two characters exchange insults in the form of expressions with the word \"bitch\" inserted in them. One of these is \"Revenge is a bitch best served cold\".\n\nBattlebots[]\n\nA Star Trek-themed robot called The Brainsters of Triskellian competed in Seasons 3.0 and 5.0 of the televised robot fighting tournament when it aired on Comedy Central.\n\nBattlestar Galactica[]\n\nSee main article: Battlestar Galactica.\n\nBecker[]\n\nParamount Television produced sitcom for CBS Broadcasting, starring Star Trek: 30 Years and Beyond host Ted Danson and Terry Farrell. This was the show Farrell either left Deep Space Nine for, or became employed at, directly after she was fired/forced to leave/let go – reports on the exact circumstances under which this happened remain to this day unclear and contradictory.\n\nIn one episode of the series, Bob remarks that his ex-wife was \"hit by more lasers than the Starship Enterprise.\"\n\nBeing Human (American)[]\n\nThe second episode of the series refers to Star Trek. In addition, Sam Witwer is a regular on the show and plays the role of the vampire Aiden.\n\nEpisode 23 \"Dream Reaper\" a recurring character by the name of Zoe attempts to help Sally out of a dream she is trapped in, and enters through what she calls a \"Mind Meld\", prompt Aiden to ask about it while showing the hand gesture.\n\nBeing Erica[]\n\nIn the episode \"Erica the Vampire Slayer\", the character IF uses Odo to explain to Erica what a shapeshifter is. Erica later uses the phrase \"Live long and prosper\" to say goodbye to IF.\n\nBetter Off Ted[]\n\n\"Lust in Translation\"[]\n\nScientists Lem and Phil create a universal translator. In one scene, Ted's line \"Greta, can we talk?\" is translated into Klingon, and subtitled as \"Human female! You will speak!\"\n\nBewitched[]\n\nIn the 1968 episode \"Samantha's Secret Saucer\" (guest starring Hamilton Camp), when Tabitha flies her toy spaceship, Aunt Clara tells her, \"You're a better spaceman than Doctor [sic] Spock\".\n\nThe Big Bang Theory[]\n\nSee main article: The Big Bang Theory.\n\nBig Time Rush[]\n\nGuest starring Ed Begley, Jr., Robert Pine, Jonathan Schmock, and featuring voice actors Tara Strong, Dee Bradley Baker, Tom Kenny, Phil LaMarr, and Jess Harnell.\n\nIn \"Big Time Girl Group\", the music video for \"I Know You Know\" was possibly inspired by some of Star Trek referrences.\n\nBlack Mirror[]\n\nDebuting in December 2011 and set in the near future, Black Mirror is a British Channel 4 produced cautionary tale anthology series in which present-day technological and socioeconomic developments and their impact on societies are scrutinized. Inspired by the legendary and similarly conceived American The Twilight Zone series, the British series is picked up by the streaming service Netflix.\n\n\"Playtest\" (S03E02)[]\n\nIn this episode, the character Cooper upon being asked if he is ready to start a virtual reality simulation enthusiastically answers \"beam me up, lock and load\".\n\n\"USS Callister\" (S04E01)[]\n\nThis episode is an overt Star Trek parody that uses an online game based on a classic TV show – called Space Fleet – to explore the theme of misogyny and cyberbullying.\n\nAfter that episode debuted in December 2017, reports that a spinoff based on it was being discussed emerged in January 2017. [2] [3] The viability of such a potential move was validated at the 2018 Emmy Award ceremonies, where this episode alone picked up six nominations out of eight in total for the entire fourth season, of which it won no less than four, including the most prestigious one in the category \"Outstanding Television Movie\". [4] This actually turned out to an embarrassment for the franchise it had drawn its inspiration from as the first season of Star Trek: Discovery only secured two nominations in minor technical categories that year, despite an elaborate publicity campaign by CBS Broadcasting to achieve much more, and neither of which won. [5] [6]\n\nBones[]\n\nLong-running crime series revolving around the unlikely partnership between the cocky and jaded FBI agent Seeley Booth and the emotionally detached forensic anthropologist Temperance Brennan, and like Star Trek's Leonard McCoy, nicknamed \"Bones\" by Booth.\n\n\"A Boy in a Bush\" (S01E05)[]\n\nWhen down-to-Earth FBI agent Seeley Booth contrasts Angela Montenegro's humanistic and emotional responses to her colleague's detached scientific, academic approach in regard to the remains of a murdered child they are tasked to investigate, he states, \"Angela didn't get the same training the rest of you got on Planet Vulcan.\"\n\n\"The Superhero in the Alley\" (S01E12)[]\n\nWhen Zack Addy admits he never read comic books, Jack Hodgins surprised lists a couple of franchises including Star Wars, Star Trek, Stargate, and Battlestar Galactica.\n\n\"The Resurrection in the Remains\" (S11E05)[]\n\nIn this crossover episode with Alex Kurtzman and Roberto Orci's show Sleepy Hollow, Ichabod Crane angrily snarls \"Do I look as though I have just beamed down from the planet Vulcan!?\" when Hodgins comments on his 18th-century clothing.\n\nBoston Legal[]\n\nBoston Legal is a legal comedy-drama that aired on ABC from 2004 to 2008. The series stars William Shatner in his Emmy-winning role as egotistical and sometimes senile attorney Denny Crane. Also starring in the series is Rene Auberjonois of Star Trek: Deep Space Nine fame as Paul Lewiston.\n\nGiven Shatner's and Auberjonois' association with Star Trek, several Trek-related in-jokes have crept into the series. In addition, many actors (most having played aliens) who have guest-starred on Star Trek have popped up in guest roles. Trek regulars who have made appearances are Ethan Phillips, Jeri Ryan, Michelle Forbes, Scott Bakula, and Armin Shimerman; two actors who make numerous appearances (both as judges) are Ron Canada and Henry Gibson, while Joanna Cassidy had a recurring role as Shatner's love interest. John Larroquette (the Klingon Maltz in ST III) joined the Boston Legal cast in Season 4, having previously played an attorney, Dan Fielding, on Night Court.\n\n\"Finding Nimmo\"[]\n\nIn this episode, Denny takes his friend and fellow attorney, Alan Shore (played by James Spader), to Nimmo Bay in Canada to get over a recent break-up. While staying the night in a cabin, Alan reads a book on sea lice and explains to Denny that the lice are called \"cling-ons.\" Denny replies to this by asking \"Did you say \"Klingons?\" The German translation of this episode is using a different wordplay in which Shore says \"Dance on the ecological Vulcan\" and Denny replies \"Did you say Vulcan?\".\n\n\"The Cancer Man Can\"[]\n\nDenny receives a new cell phone as a gift from his new girlfriend (played by Star Trek: Enterprise guest actress Joanna Cassidy). When Denny flips the phone open, it makes the chirping sound of an original series communicator. The episode was directed by original series guest star Lou Antonio.\n\n\"Helping Hands\"[]\n\nDenny and Paul (Shatner and Auberjonois) argue about Denny being the \"captain\" of the office and Paul just being a \"boatsman\" after Paul gave Denny his marriage contract.\n\n\"...There's Fire!\"[]\n\nWhile dancing with his new wife Beverly (Joanna Cassidy), Denny met Troy, a friend of Beverly who is working as a realtor in Hawaii. Beverly proposed that the couple should have their first home on Hawaii and Denny replied \"...and what should I do? Beam to Boston every day?\".\n\n\"Trial of the Century\"[]\n\nIn keeping with the show's penchant for breaking the fourth wall, William Shatner's character Denny Crane, tells a flock of reporters that he \"once captained his own space ship.\"\n\nSee also[]\n\nBoston Legal at Wikipedia\n\nBottom[]\n\nIn the fifth live show, \"Weapons Grade Y-Fronts Tour\", Eddie Hitler's time-traveling toilet, the TURDIS, is allegedly powered by a dilithium crystal; after wasting time with a meaningless questionnaire, he claims that he was \"waiting for the dilithium crystal to reach optimum temperature\".\n\nBoy Meets World[]\n\nIn a first season episode, Cory Matthews thinks that his teacher, Mr. Feeny, believes fellow classmate Stuart Minkus to be \"the next Captain Kirkicard\" (mistaking Søren Kierkegaard for both James Kirk and Jean-Luc Picard.) In a second season episode, when Cory is given an assignment to do a biography on a person, he claims his \"more interesting\" subject will be \"Captain James T. Kirk of the USS Enterprise.\" When his teacher, Mr. Turner, protests, he claims that \"Captain Kirk is a fictional character. The guy is sixty-three years old and wears a tribble on his head.\"\n\nIn \"Danger Boy\", Mr. Feeny is clearly heard shouting \"Warp factor ten, Mr. Sulu!\" as the car for the most dangerous roller coaster built departs the station.\n\nBreaking Bad[]\n\n\"Sunset\"[]\n\nIn the episode \"Sunset\" Walter White calls Saul Goodman for advice on getting rid of The RV. Saul asks Walter if he hasn't made any precautions. He says \"Starship Enterprise had a self-destruct button, I'm just sayin'\"\n\n\"Blood Money\"[]\n\nIn August 2013, the TV series Breaking Bad featured an extended conversation about Star Trek in the mid-season premiere, \"Blood Money\", of the show's fifth and final season. Characters Brandon \"Badger\" Mayhew and Skinny Pete (very stoned) discuss Star Trek, and Pete (while smoking from a bong) claims that every time a character uses the transporter, the original person is actually destroyed, and the transporter simply makes a perfect copy (a \"color xerox\") at the target location. This greatly disturbs Badger, who asks if this means there were something like 147 different Kirks during the run of the TV series, each of whom were killed and replaced by a duplicate when they used the transporter. Pete confirms this is exactly what he is saying, and cites that Dr. McCoy rarely uses the transporter because as a doctor, he knows what it actually does to people.\n\nBadger and Pete go on discussing Star Trek, and Badger describes an idea for a Star Trek script which he has had for a long time. In his script, the crew's mission has been boring and uneventful for some time, so they decide to hold a pie-eating contest in the mess hall – \"tulaberry pies\". Pete says that he doesn't know what tulaberries are, to which Badger responds \"Tulaberries, from Gamma Quadrant, yo.\" Pete sharply interjects \"That's Voyager, dude.\" Annoyed, Badger continues by saying, \"Okay, blueberries. They're eating blueberry pie.\"\n\nBadger goes on to explain that the pie-eating contest comes down to just Spock, Kirk, and Chekov. Pete thinks Kirk would have room to spare, but Badger insists that Spock is winning because of his heightened Vulcan metabolism. Kirk has to admit defeat, but the only other crewmember still in the contest besides Spock is Chekov. Ingeniously, Chekov and Scott collaborated to rig the contest, so as soon as Chekov eats a pie Scott uses the transporter to beam his stomach contents out into space, so he can eat an infinite amount of food. Spock is becoming very frustrated and doesn't understand how Chekov can keep eating. Unfortunately, Lt. Uhura then comes into engineering and Scott, distracted by her \"pointies,\" hits the wrong button, and suddenly Chekov is vomiting up blood – Scott accidentally beamed his internal organs out into space as well.\n\nBreaking In[]\n\nStarring Christian Slater.\n\n\"Pilot\"[]\n\nOz has the TOS Enterprise's captain's chair in his office. He says it was a gift from William Shatner for taking care of a stalker problem: Oz' Klingonese-speaking employee Cash, who is shown standing in Shatner's yard wearing a sciences blue TNG uniform.\n\n\"White On White On White\"[]\n\nOz gives Cash the Vulcan nerve pinch as punishment for contradicting him.\n\n\"The Contra Club\"[]\n\nOz calls Cameron \"Chekov\" before making him sit down in the Enterprise's captain's chair.\n\n\"The Blind Sided\"[]\n\nCash wants to mind meld with Cameron to learn about Cameron's night of sex with Melanie.\n\nBuck Rogers[]\n\nSeveral names from Star Trek, most notably Captain Christopher Pike, can be heard in \"background dialogue\" (PA announcements, etc.) in several 1979 first season episodes.\n\nIn the first season two-part episode \"The Plot to Kill a City\", an \"Aldebaran II spaceport\" appeared, which was executed as a matte painting and created by future Star Trek Visual Effects Producer Dan Curry. The painting reappeared a short time later in the same season episode \"Planet of the Amazon Women\", co-written by former Original Series Producer D.C. Fontana, as the \"Zantia spaceport\". Later, Curry used his painting to create a slightly different version which was subsequently featured as the Relva VII Starfleet Academy facility, seen in The Next Generation first season episode \"Coming of Age\", in effect becoming one of his very first contributions to the franchise.\n\nThe pilot feature that started off the Universal Studios television series, had been served by visual effects cameramen Hoyt Yeatman, Dave Stewart and Scott Squires, albeit uncredited. Also working on the pilot was Michele Small as production assistant as well as Curry's matte painting colleague Syd Dutton. Tim McHugh started out his Hollywood career on the series in a similar function as held by Small. Fully titled Buck Rogers in the 25th Century and a remake of the studio's own 1930s serials, the by Glen A. Larson developed series was intended as a replacement for his own Battlestar Galactica, the studio had cancelled the same year when Buck Rogers started its two-season run in 1979.\n\nBuffy the Vampire Slayer[]\n\nThe makeup and prosthetics for this series (and its spin-off Angel) was done by Optic Nerve Studios, who later was contracted as such for Star Trek: Discovery.\n\nIn the season one episode \"Prophecy Girl\", Xander proclaims \"I'm sorry, calm may work for Locutus of the Borg here, but I'm freaked out and I intend to stay that way.\"\n\nIn a season five episode, Xander also quotes James T. Kirk in saying \"Kill us both, Spock\" in a situation where he, like Kirk in \"The Enemy Within\", had been split into two beings.\n\nIn season six episode \"Seeing Red\", Willow and Tara explain to Buffy and Xander that they've deciphered all the documents from the \"Stooges\" (Warren Mears, Andrew Wells and Jonathan Levins) on everything except one document. Xander recognizes it as Klingon love poems.\n\nLater, in the final season, after Xander has a bad date with a demon, he asks Willow to \"gay him up.\" He starts talking about attempting to fantasize about Scott Bakula, who another character dreamily identifies as Jonathan Archer.\n\nBuiten de Zone[]\n\nThis Flemish-language Belgian TV series often parodied popular culture, including on a few occasions Star Trek.\n\n\"De Jongerenfoon\"[]\n\nAlready in the first episode, \"de jongerenfoon\", an on-the-scene reporter reporting from the moon ends his report by saying \"beam me up, Scotty\" and being beamed away.\n\n\"Kitch en kunst\"[]\n\nThe episode \"Kitch en kunst\" (Kitsch and art) parodies the perceived tendency of Flemish films to focus on farmers according to one character by showing, among other genres, a bit from a film described as science fiction: it shows \"farmer Spock\" piloting a harvester, and coming upon giant potatoes, which he reports by communicator to \"farmer Scotty\".\n\n\"Gevaar\"[]\n\nThe episode \"Gevaar\" (Danger), features extended drug-induced hallucinations. At one point a character imagines herself to be Princess Leia from Star Wars, who is captured by Darth Vader aboard the Death Star, only to be rescued by an original series landing party including Mister Spock.\n\nBullyparade[]\n\nThis German comedy show featured a regular sketch entitled \"Unser (T)Raumschiff\" (Our Spaceship, with a pun on Traum meaning dream), which was a parody of the original Star Trek series (known as Raumschiff Enterprise in German), revolving around the misadventures of the starship Surprise, and its all gay crew, including Captain Kork, Mr. Spuck, Schrotti, etc. Its success led to the feature film spin-off (T)Raumschiff Surprise - Periode 1.\n\nC[]\n\nCanada's Worst Driver 2 (Eye of the Needle Challenge)[]\n\nWhile one of the contestants were speeding up, their nominator/friend was calling out warp factors matching the miles per hour \"warp 6.7\" which translated into 67 mph.\n\nThe Carol Burnett Show (Original)[]\n\nIn \"Star Trip,\" Captain Quirk (Harvey Korman) and a very emotional Mr. Spook (Sid Caesar) encounter Virginia Robot a live bomb played by Carol Burnett.\n\nIn the sketch \"Mrs. Invisible Man,\" Carol, married to the Invisible Man, prepares to feed her invisible baby an antidote to turn him visible. The invisible husband, insisting on testing it on himself first, exits the room before doing so and excitedly exclaiming the antidote works. Returning to the living room with the antidote, he is revealed to be Spock (played by Leonard Nimoy), leaving Carol shocked.\n\nThe Carol Burnett Show (1991 revival)[]\n\nIn one episode skit, the Enterprise passes through the \"Estrogena Nebula\" and all the crew have their genders reversed. Kirk is played by Carol Burnett, Spock by Andrea Martin.\n\nA Carol Christmas[]\n\nWilliam Shatner plays the Ghost of Christmas Present in this 2003 TV movie adaptation of A Christmas Carol. Whenever he and the titular character move from one location to another, they use the transporter effect, as a homage to Shatner's role in Star Trek. James Cromwell plays the Ghost of Christmas Future.\n\nCaroline In The City[]\n\nStarring Amy Pietz.\n\n\"Caroline and the Bad Back\"[]\n\nDel says \"Excuse me, Captain Kirk!\" when Richard angrily kicks him out of the chair at his drafting table.\n\nCastle[]\n\nA police series in which mystery novelist Richard Castle serves as permanent consultant to the NYPD, teamed up with detective Kate Beckett.

He also speaks in William Shatner cadence when talking about real-world laser blasters. When sitting in the captain's chair on the Nebula 9 Fan Experience set (obviously patterned after the \"Trekdom\" phenomenon), he delivers Picard's \"Let's make sure that history never forgets the name Enterprise\" line from TNG: \"Yesterday's Enterprise\". Beckett also describes the Nebula 9 character Lieutenant Chloe in terms that make her similar to Jadzia Dax. Jonathan Frakes, director of the episode, cameos at the beginning as a convention attendee getting Castle's autograph. The murderer also refers to a character in the show who was revived by an \"Andorian empath\".\n\nArmin Shimerman puts in a cameo as a science-fiction gadget inventor, owner of the initially darkened premises Castle and Beckett enter, finding themselves caught in targeting laser beams, emulating a signature Borg scene as featured in Star Trek: First Contact.\n\n\"Deep Cover\" (S06E12)[]\n\nCastle:\n\n\"Wait a minute, wait, we are demonstrating two-dimensional thinking here, like Khan in Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan.\"\n\nBeckett without missing a beat:\n\n\"Khan didn't realize the Enterprise was below him\"\n\nCastle:\n\n\"Right, so if we are the Enterprise, that means that Gemini is...\"\n\nBeckett:\n\n\"...above us.\"\n\nDiscussion between the two main characters, trying to ascertain the whereabouts of an antagonist in a multilevel library.\n\n\"Clear and Present Danger\" (S07E03)[]\n\nBeckett and Castle investigate someone who worked with a top secret company that developed a personal cloaking device.

However, before he can finish his thought, a Star Wars fan dressed like Darth Maul gives him a wedgie.\n\nCheers[]\n\n\"Dark Imaginings\"[]\n\nIn the 19th episode of the fourth season, George Wendt's character Norm Peterson tells John Ratzenberger's character Cliff Clavin he is \"boldy going where no man has gone before\".\n\n\"Loathe and Marriage\"[]\n\nIn the 15th episode of the eleventh season from 1993, Woody (Woody Harrelson) is asked about his wedding gift for Serafina Tortelli. He said it is a set of Star Trek steak knives. Frasier Crane (Kelsey Grammer) then jumped off his barstool and said this gift was originally from him and Lilith (Bebe Neuwirth) for Woody's wedding. While Woody described them as \"the ugliest thing he ever saw\", Frasier said about them they were \"delightfully whimsical and very utilitarian\". Later, Nick (Dan Hedaya) and Loretta (Jean Kasem) also appear at the wedding reception and Loretta is carrying a present which is also a Star Trek steak knives set.\n\nChildrens' Hospital[]\n\nIn the episode \"Joke Overload\", Captain Stern from the starship Navoa is admitted to the hospital from a \"Starfleet event nearby\" while being treated by Lieutenant D'Ghor Koru, a Klingon medical officer in a red uniform. Stern is eventually cured by a transducer unit implanted into his arm to fight the Borg techovirus. Shortly after this, a moving comment by D'Ghor Koru leads to him and Dr. Lola Spratt having sex atop Captain Stern in the ER. Stern, Koru, and Spratt eventually try to save two people who were impaled on the same flagpole using a phaser with its polarity reversed, which surprisingly works for a moment before both die. Stern and Koru then signal their starship for transport as the rest of the doctors walk out of the room.\n\nThe Chaser's War On Everything[]\n\nIn season 2 episode 7, there is a sketch of the \"Starship Preposterous\", which is clearly a parody of TOS. The Chaser team mocks the use of elaborate scientific names and the way in which the crew get themselves into and out of trouble. In the deleted scenes there are more sketches which never made it to air – including one where the crew ask why every alien they meet is six feet tall and bipedal.\n\nChicago Fire[]\n\nFeaturing Raphael Sbarge, Gordon Clapp, Rachel Nichols, and Michelle Forbes.\n\n\"A Nuisance Call\"[]\n\nShay confuses Cylons for Klingons when Otis is describing the original Battlestar Galactica to her.\n\n\"Two Ts\"[]\n\nLogan asks if a Halligan lying on the apparatus floor is a Lirpa, causing him and Otis to talk about \"Amok Time\".\n\nChuck[]\n\nProduced by Robert Duncan McNeill and featuring Bonita Friedericy, Tony Todd, Faran Tahir, John Larroquette, Melinda Clarke, Lisa LoCicero, Ethan Phillips, and Scott Bakula.\n\n\"Chuck Versus the Sandworm\"[]\n\nMorgan says that Chuck can quote Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan word for word.\n\n\"Chuck Versus the Nemesis\"[]\n\nChuck and Bryce speak Klingonese to each other, in one situation so Chuck could confirm to Bryce without alerting the enemy that he was wearing body armor.\n\n“Chuck Versus the Crown Vic”[]\n\nChuck, Jeff, and Lester visit a yacht belonging to Lon Kirk, and Lester thinks of Captain Kirk.\n\n\"Chuck Versus the Fear of Death\"[]\n\nAgent Rye does the Vulcan nerve pinch to a guard and initially claims he learned it from Star Trek, then says he really learned it in Bangladesh despite being a fan of the show.\n\nChucklevision[]\n\nBritish children's comedy series, featuring the Chuckle Brothers duo which included the Sketch \"Chuckle Trek – the Lost Generation\".\n\nCinema Insomnia[]\n\n\"Creature\"[]\n\nIn the episode \"Creature\", Mr. Lobo uses the phrase \"boldly goes where no one has gone before\" (\"also luckily for Astronaut John, the slightly softer and more man-friendly Susan boldly goes where no one has gone before.\") and the Vulcan salute saying \"Klaatu barada nikto\", referencing the movie The Day the Earth Stood Still.\n\n\"The Last Man on Earth\"[]\n\nAs the last man on Earth, Mr. Lobo decides he could open his Star Trek: The Next Generation action figure \"Louisiana Klingon Fisherman Worf with Crawdad Chomping Action\" from its original package.\n\nFurther information\n\nCinema Insomnia at Wikipedia\n\nClarissa Explains It All[]\n\nIn the forth season episode \"The Flu\", Clarissa imagines that she takes command of the Enterprise when the other crewmembers go ill.

In the latter, Swift was outfitted in a Starfleet uniform, given Vulcan ears, and digitally placed in Kirk's stead during the scene in the film where he and Scott are brought to the bridge, giving evasive, sarcastic responses when ordered by Spock to answer his questions – when host Bill Engvall, also in uniform arrives on the bridge, she vaporizes him with her phaser. [7]\n\nThe Colbert Report[]\n\nClips from \"Sins of The Father\" are used in an episode of The Colbert Report. Stephen Colbert \"mistakes\" Kurn for 2008 US Republican Presidential primary candidate Rudy Giuliani, and the scene of Picard rhetorically asking, \"What does this say about an empire that holds honor so dear?\" is used.\n\nIn February 2008, Colbert honored Lieutenant Worf in his 3rd Annual Ethnic Minute, titled \"African Chinese History New Year's Month Minute.\"\n\nIn an April 2009 edition of the show's \"Better Know A District\" segment (interviews with members of the US Congress in which Colbert asks highly inappropriate questions, which, knowing the interview is satirical, are sometimes met with equally inappropriate answers), Colbert and New York congressman Dan Maffei, an acknowledged Trek fan, donned fake mirror Spock goatees for much of the interview, playfully attributing the questions, and answers such as \"I enjoy cocaine\", to their \"evil twins\". The segment also ended with Maffei giving Colbert a Vulcan salute.\n\nIn the May 9, 2013 episode, LeVar Burton gives his VISOR to Carey Mulligan so she can read The Great Gatsby. He later puts it on himself and is beamed up.\n\nColumbo[]\n\nIn the episode \"Fade In To Murder\", guest starring William Shatner and featuring Walter Koenig, a portrait of Shatner as James T. Kirk can be seen in Ward Fawler (Shatner)'s living room.\n\nThe Comedy Central Roast of...[]\n\n...William Shatner[]\n\nCable network Comedy Central produced a two-hour roast of William Shatner which aired on August 20, 2006, with Shatner being the butt of numerous Star Trek-related jokes. During the TV special, Shatner sat on a replica of the command chair of the USS Enterprise. Bartenders in the background were dressed as Orion slave girls. Jason Alexander served as emcee and roastmaster. The roast performers included George Takei, Leonard Nimoy, Nichelle Nichols, Andy Dick, and Sarah Silverman. Brent Spiner, Jeri Ryan, Rene Auberjonois, and Rosalind Chao were in the live audience. Clint Howard also appears in the roast reprising his role of Balok who had developed a bit of a drinking problem, being addicted to tranya.\n\n...Charlie Sheen[]\n\nWilliam Shatner was a roaster on the Comedy Central roast of Charlie Sheen, which aired on September 19, 2011, and several Star Trek-related jokes were made by, and directed at, him. It was hosted by Seth MacFarlane.\n\nShatner joked about how he'd slept with green women and how to shock people in his day, he'd have to do stuff like kiss a black woman or let an Asian drive.\n\nComic Book Men[]\n\nComic Book Men is a reality television series set at Kevin Smith's New Jersey comic book store, Jay and Silent Bob's Secret Stash.

The same episode is signed off by Keven Smith saying \"Live long and prosper, children.\"\n\nIn the episode \"Sucka M.C.\", a sub-mariner no1 comes up at the store, and Brian comments that he looks like Spock in a speedo.\n\nA major portion of the episode \"The Captain and the Clerk\" is devoted to an interview of Kevin Smith with William Shatner. Many of his classic Star Trek performances are discussed, including the funeral of Spock, which Smith calls one of his favorite performances ever, and Kirk shouting \"Khaaan\", which he offers as an example illustrating his argument that Shatner is one of the most memorable actors of the last fifty years.\n\nAt the end of the episode \"Hometown Heroes\", Kevin Smith announces that just like a wrongheaded network executive back in the day, they'll have to \"end this enterprise\".\n\n\"Pac-Ming\" features a discussion on what real athlete could be a Flash Gordon-type character. Tom Brady is mentioned, though it is erroneously claimed that if he went in space he could \"out-Kirk Kirk\".\n\nIn \"Rock 'Em Sock 'Em Stash\", he cast discusses what one element from the Star Trek universe they would want in the Star Wars universe and vice versa.\n\nComic Relief[]\n\nIn the sixth special, a special segment was produced on the bridge and observation lounge sets from Star Trek: The Next Generation during the seventh season and guest-starred Jonathan Frakes, Brent Spiner, Gates McFadden, Michael Dorn, LeVar Burton, and Marina Sirtis as Commander Riker, Data, Dr. Crusher, Worf, Geordi La Forge, and Counselor Troi, respectively. In the segment, Data and La Forge beam back to the Enterprise after discovering some artifacts from 20th century Earth on a planet. The artifacts turn out to be a VHS cassette of a Comic Relief special and some articles of clothing (\"TEE-shirts\" and \"SWEAT-shirts\" as Data describes them), with Data explaining that the purpose of Comic Relief was to raise funds to fight homelessness in the United States. La Forge downloads the VHS tape into the Enterprise computer, revealing a still photograph of Comic Relief hosts Robin Williams, Billy Crystal, and Whoopi Goldberg; however, Data and the rest of the crew mistakenly refer to her as \"Whoo-pie.\" While Worf ponders \"what kind of name is 'Whoo-pie'?\", Dr. Crusher notices that \"Whoo-pie\" looks an awful lot like Guinan. When she ponders if \"Whoo-pie\" and Guinan are one and the same, the entire crew replies with \"Nahhhh.\" As Data explains what the shirts were for (they were given out to donors to the Comic Relief pledgers), La Forge laments that the 50/50 cotton/polyester blend that comprised the shirts didn't interact well with the transporter, causing them to singe. Troi asks how well the special did, and Data replies that the previous specials raised over twenty million dollars which went towards helping homeless people and that the mantra used by Comic Relief, which used humor throughout, was \"Where there's laughter, there's hope\".\n\nCommunity[]\n\nThis long-running (2009-15) NBC sitcom was filmed on Paramount Stage 31, and starred an ensemble cast including Gillian Jacobs and Danny Pudi.\n\n\"Messianic Myths and Ancient Peoples\"[]\n\nDuring a discussion about resurrection, Spock and Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan come up.\n\n\"Epidemiology\"[]\n\nPierce dresses up as James T.

After declaring his intentions to return to the prime timeline and kill the good versions of themselves, the rest of the group leaves, leaving Abed and Troy to don their goatees and dub themselves \"Evil Troy and Evil Abed\".\n\n\"Studies In Modern Movement\"[]\n\nFirst appearance of \"the Dreamatorium\", a play room used by Abed Nadir and Troy Barnes. It looks exactly like the style of holodeck used on the USS Enterprise-D, and has a similar function in the series, except for the fact that there is no imaging technology, instead relying on the user's imagination.\n\n\"Geothermal Escapism\"[]\n\nTroy is given a universal translator at the start of the episode, before he goes to sail around the world with LeVar Burton: Abed tells him to \"Engage\" as he departs. During the credits, Troy reads a list of questions about TNG for LeVar, including \"Why don't they call it 'Planet Trek'? You never go to a star, not one time.\"\n\nContinuum[]\n\nStarring Rachel Nichols, Brian Markinson, Roger Cross, and Tony Amendola.\n\n\"Matter Of Time\"[]\n\nCarlos asks Keira \"Did anyone tell you you watched too much Star Trek as a kid?\" because she's so well-versed in the physics of antimatter.\n\nCoronation Street[]\n\nA character named Cathy who is a hoarder says \"Space. the final frontier...\", referring to the now empty space in her recently de-cluttered house.\n\nAiden's sister Kate mentions the clothing company Underworld going where no clothing store had gone before.\n\nCoupling[]\n\nBritish sitcom of the early 2000s, featuring the lives of people in their early thirties.

Captain Kirk, it is time to shag the alien's girlfriend... Jeff, beam over\". Not doing as Steve tells him but continuing the Star Trek conversation, Jeff then responds by saying \"Do you remember when Captain Kirk would see a beautiful woman the screen would go all misty? I thought his eyes were steaming up because he was so excited. Every time I talked to a girl I tried to make my eyes steam up.\"\n\n\"My Dinner in Hell\"[]\n\nMariella Frostrup can be heard talking about the cast of the Original Series during her live broadcast near the end of the episode.\n\n\"The Melty Man Cometh\"[]\n\nJeff says \"the engines cannae take it\" while putting on a Scottish accent, an obvious impression of Montgomery Scott.\n\nCriminal Minds[]\n\nGuest stars include Anton Yelchin and Jonathan Frakes.\n\n\"Compulsion\"[]\n\nThe I'm a doctor, not a... meme is brought up.\n\n\"The Big Game\"[]\n\nReid challenges people to ask him about Star Trek episodes so that he can tell them the plot, identify the alien races in the episode, and quote Dr. McCoy.

Morgan Sheppard.\n\nIn one episode, Bug says he's working on a fan fiction story in which Kathryn Janeway has to have sex with a Borg.\n\nCSI: Crime Scene Investigation[]\n\nStarring Paul Guilfoyle, Wallace Langham, and Liz Vassey, and Star Trek: 30 Years and Beyond host Ted Danson, and featuring guest appearances by Brenda Strong, Gregg Henry, Brenda Bakke, Bruce McGill, Jolene Blalock, Dina Meyer, Kate Vernon, Melinda Page Hamilton, Bruce Davison, Raymond Cruz, Enrique Murciano, Kellie Waymire, Alicia Coppola, Neal McDonough, Ray Wise, Armin Shimerman, Star Trek: 30 Years and Beyond participant Peri Gilpin, Scottie Thompson, Don Stark, Nana Visitor, and John Billingsley.\n\n\"Random Acts of Violence\"[]\n\nTo show Greg that Archie was the better choice for a specific kind of evidence analysis, Nick asks Archie about a particular Trek episode involving a time portal. Archie replies, \"Original Series, Next Generation, Deep Space Nine, Voyager, or Enterprise?\"\n\n\"Monster in the Box\"[]\n\nLab Technician David Hodges has a cat named Kobayashi Maru, in reference to the famed scenario. As one of the guys is about to make the Star Trek reference, another guy cuts him off before he finishes, possibly because uttering the franchise would have raised legal issues with CSI's studio. He calls the cat \"Mr. K\" or \"Kobe.\"\n\n\"Theory of Everything\"[]\n\nThe team begins finding bodies that have green blood. While it is found that the victims had extremely high levels of sulfur in their systems which caused the green blood, Hodges and DNA tech Wendy Simms argue over the particulars of Vulcan blood. While Hodges believes it is sulfur that makes Vulcan blood green, Wendy corrects him, saying it is actually copper, revealing herself to be a Star Trek fan.\n\n\"A Space Oddity\"[]\n\nWritten by former Star Trek: Deep Space Nine writers Naren Shankar, Bradley Thompson, and David Weddle, contains a subplot about the remaking of an old science fiction program named \"Astro Quest\", leading to a murder on a science fiction convention. Hodges, while inspecting a corpse, addresses detective Jim Brass and says \"He's dead Jim\". He turns out to be a huge fan of \"Astro Quest\", along with his assistant, Wendy Simms. Hodges daydreams about the two of them being \"Commander Bishop\" and \"Yeoman Malloy\" from the show (an apparent spoof of Captain Kirk and Yeoman Rand). Another part of the episode parodies \"The Gamesters of Triskelion\" with Wendy spoofing Shahna, and another makes Wendy into an Orion slave girl analogue from \"The Cage\". The title itself is a parody of the classic title 2001:A Space Odyssey, while \"Astro Quest\" is both a parody of Galaxy Quest and Star Trek (Astro is a synonym for Star while Quest is a synonym for Trek). The subplot, about a young director/producer remaking an old series with a brand new concept, angering fans is a direct reference/parody of the backlash Ronald D. Moore (who cameos as the first person to denounce the remake) experienced when remaking Battlestar Galactica.\n\nCSI: Cyber[]\n\nStarring Star Trek: 30 Years and Beyond host Ted Danson.\n\n\"Why Fi\"[]\n\nTech genius Daniel Krumitz is compared to Captain Kirk and the cyber crimes command center CTOC is his bridge.\n\nCSI: Miami[]\n\nFeaturing guest appearances by Gregg Henry, Jolene Blalock, Robert Beltran, Raymond Cruz, Malcolm McDowell, Emily Bergl, Chris Pine, Johanna Watts, and Tim Russ.\n\n\"Fade Out\"[]\n\nA seemingly mob-related murder occurs.

In a scene during which the two are working on their script, they discuss a character who has the line \"Today is a good day to die,\" a reference to the timeless Klingon saying. One of the boys then suggested that that character be black, referring to Worf, played by Michael Dorn. Delko later mentions how the two have used every cliché in the book.\n\n\"Sunblock\"[]\n\nThe investigators confront a suspect at a Halloween party in Klingon makeup who talks to them in Klingonese. One of the investigators translates and when his associates look at him funny indicates he learned it years ago.\n\n\"Wheels Up\"[]\n\nThe episode's murder victim is a roller derby girl who goes by the name \"Wrath of Connie.\"\n\nCSI: NY[]\n\nFeaturing Symba Smith, Dominic Keating, Neal McDonough, and Madchen Amick.\n\n\"Corporate Warriors\"[]\n\nA guy is killed during a festival. They go to his home and the refrigerator appears to be full of alcohol where one of the detectives says \"Our victim looks like he was on some sort of Star Trek diet, you know, the kind where people have evolved past needing to eat real food.\"\n\nCurb Your Enthusiasm[]\n\nGuest starring Anton Yelchin\n\nIn the ninth season episode \"The Accidental Text on Purpose\", Larry David asks Leon if he's ever seen the movie Arabesque, leading Leon to wonder if that is \"one of those Star Trek movies.\n\nCybill[]\n\n[]\n\nJonathan Frakes guest-stars as himself, putting the moves on Cybill after they do some sci-fi project together even though she won't date actors.

When Cybill refused his advances, he said to her she should lower her shields and let him in and that they could \"boldly go where no one has gone before\".\n\nLater, when Cybill asks her ex-husband Ira to tell Frakes over the phone that they're together, saying he's \"the second-in-command of the starship Enterprise,\" Ira responds, \"Listen, Nimoy, stay away from my woman!\" Her daughter Zoe says she'd date him regardless of him being already married because he's \"the #2 guy on the Enterprise! If the bald guy dies, he's the boss!\" When nobody responds to his knocking at the door, Frakes pulls out a flip phone, says into it to try Candace Bergen's house, and beams out.\n\nBesides Jonathan Frakes, the episode also features Trek actor Stephen Root as well as an unknown background actor.\n\n\"A Who's Who for What's His Name\"[]\n\nDuring the funeral ceremony for talent agent Arthur Minnow, played by Brian Keith, Cybill hired film and television lookalikes to let the widow Evelyn Minnow, played by Angela Paton, believe everyone cared for her husband. Among the lookalikes was a Captain Jean-Luc Picard double wearing the TNG command division uniform and a Whoopi Goldberg lookalike.\n\nThe episode also features regular background actor William Steinfeldt.\n\n\"Cybill Does Diary\"[]\n\nWhile visiting a video rental shop, Cybill and Maryann discover several adult movies including Sex Trek: The Next Gyration.

Kendra Saunders (Hawkgirl) says she prefers Picard. Palmer complains that Picard is sexless, but Saunders brings up Vash. Later, when piloting, Palmer says he's feeling more like Sulu.\n\nDead Ringers[]\n\nA sketch on the television version of the British show Dead Ringers featured a sketch wherein Christopher Eccleston, then recently cast as the title character in the Doctor Who revival, goes home to tell the news to his parents. However, his parents are revealed to be fanatical Trekkies, and as such deeply disappointed.\n\nDefiance[]\n\nRecurring cast member Anna Hopkins once spent $100 to get a photo of herself with Patrick Stewart.

A DS9 DVD was frequently seen as a prop in his house and his ringtone was that of the Star Trek: The Original Series theme. A suite from Star Trek Nemesis was played at his funeral and other characters commented that a cake Billy Mitchell gets, iced with the words \"Beam me up!\", is in bad taste for the wake.

When she pulls his fake beard off, Robert tries to salvage the situation by saying that he \"assumed the body of a life form that... you would accept.\", to which Ray quips, \"Robert you're Santa. Not a Klingon.\", which is also a variant on the \"I'm a doctor, not a...\" snowclone.\n\n\"Debra's Sick\"[]\n\nDebra asks Ray to take her temperature with an ear thermometer. Looking at the design of the instrument, he asks her if he should set it to \"stun\".\n\n\"Bad Moon Rising\"[]\n\nFrank refers to a woman's menstrual cycle as \"The Enemy Within\".\n\n\"Pet Cemetery\"[]\n\nRobert begins his tribute to Pumpernickel, Ally's pet hamster, at the animal's funeral by saying, \"Death... the final goodbye.\", with the same gravitas as \"Space... the final frontier.\"\n\nExtras[]\n\nAn Anglo-American co-production, in which famous actors and celebrities make cameo appearances. It revolves around the lives of two extras who bump into these people during the course of their work. Each episode is named after the main cameo.\n\nIn the Patrick Stewart episode, Andy Millman (played by Ricky Gervais) meets Stewart, playing a parody of himself who is trying to get a self-penned film produced which basically involves him going around seeing women naked. After Millman fails to recognize Stewart's \"Make it so\" quote having never seen The Next Generation, Stewart assumes that Millman's partner didn't let him watch it. When Millman replies that he is in fact single, Stewart says to him \"You're not married, you haven't got a girlfriend... and you've never watched Star Trek?\". Millman passes on a sitcom script to Patrick Stewart, whose company, called Picard Productions passes it on to the BBC (after Millman falsely promises to rewrite it to include naked women, at Stewart's request), which ensures Andy's sitcom success in season 2. In the Sir Ian McKellen episode, Millman also mentions his encounter with Patrick Stewart.\n\nIn 2005, Stewart received an Emmy Award nomination for appearing in this show. He had stepped in when Jude Law pulled out of the show to appear in Alfie.\n\nF[]\n\nFamily Matters[]\n\nIn the fifth season episode entitled \"Money Out the Window\", a loan shark who is owed money by Eddie and Steve introduces himself as \"Bones.\" Steve asks him \"as in the doctor on Star Trek?\" to which Bones replies, \"No. Bones, as in 'I break them.'\"\n\nFarscape[]\n\nFarscape contains numerous references to Star Trek. The show's lead character, John Crichton, is a self-acknowledged sci-fi fan. As the sole Human on the crew, none of his crewmates ever get the references.\n\nCrossover writers for both series include Keith R. A. DeCandido, Carleton Eastlake, Clayvon C. Harris David Kemper, Richard Manning, Naren Shankar, and Harry Werksman.\n\n\"PK Tech Girl\"[]\n\nHaving spotted an enemy ship, Crichton says, \"Shouldn't we be doing warp a thousand by now?\"\n\n\"They've Got a Secret\"[]\n\nCrichton suggests a book on leviathan pregnancy could be co-written by Doctor Spock and Mister Spock.\n\n\"Till the Blood Runs Clear\"[]\n\nA guest character's name is Rorf, which Crichton mishears as Worf.\n\n\"Durka Returns\"[]\n\nAeryn lists \"The Liberation of Mintaka III\" among Captain Durka's achievements.\n\n\"Family Ties\"[]\n\nCrichton compares his relationship with his crewmate D'Argo to that between Kirk and Spock.\n\n\"Crackers Don't Matter\"[]\n\nAnother character exclaims \"Revenge is a dish best served cold\" from Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan, to which Crichton responds, \"I hate it when villains quote Shakespeare\" (referring to Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country).\n\n\"Home on the Remains\"[]\n\nCrichton mentions Captain Kirk.\n\n\"A Clockwork Nebari\"[]\n\nDealing with an alien race called the Nebari, Crichton asks them, \"Isn't that your Nebari Prime Directive?\"\n\n\"Self-Inflicted Wounds Part 1: Could'a, Would'a, Should'a\"[]\n\nCrichton claims to somewhat understand a very technobabble-like conversation because he's watched \"all kinds of Star Trek\".\n\n\"Green Eyed Monster\"[]\n\nA star is referred to as Mintaka III.\n\n\"Losing Time\"[]\n\nCrichton nicknames a DRD (diagnostic repair drone) \"DRD Pike,\" because he communicates with it using \"one blink for yes, two for no,\" just as Pike did in \"The Menagerie\".\n\n\"Meltdown\"[]\n\nWhen a villain appears suddenly, Crichton asks him if he beamed in.\n\n\"Revenging Angel\"[]\n\nThis episode was a mix of animation and live action, in which a cartoon D'Argo finds himself plastered to the front of the deflector dish of the USS Enterprise as it flies through space, at which point a Montgomery Scott-like voice notes that they've hit something. Later, Crichton compares himself to James T. Kirk, to which another character responds, \"That was a television show, John. And he did Priceline commercials!\"\n\n\"Crichton Kicks\"[]\n\nIn this episode Crichton faces off against a group of pirates/scavengers. At one point he challenges them by shouting the phrase \"Get the hell off of my ship!\" in Klingon (the phrase was created using the actual Klingon language created by Marc Okrand). He remarks afterwards that the \"translator microbes\" (Farscape's equivalent of the universal translator) couldn't handle Klingon. He later also refers to the raiders as Klingon (and they do physically resemble Klingons).\n\n\"I Shrink, Therefore I Am\"[]\n\nCrichton refers to his crewmate D'Argo (who has recently been made captain of their ship) as \"Captain James T. D'Argo.\"\n\n\"A Prefect Murder\"[]\n\nCrichton does Montgomery Scott impressions.\n\n\"Unrealized Reality\"[]\n\nCrichton exclaims \"I am not Kirk, Spock, Luke, Buck, Flash, or Arthur frelling Dent.\"\n\n\"A Constellation of Doubt\"[]\n\nCrichton's nephew refers to his uncle as \"the first and only Human to boldly go where no man has gone before.\"\n\n\"We're So Screwed, Part 2\"[]\n\nCrichton flashes the Vulcan hand signal.\n\n\"The Peacekeeper Wars\"[]\n\nCrichton promises, \"The next Ferengi we see, we run.

Although the TV series contained little or no science fiction content, the titular character first appeared on the RTÉ radio show The Starship Róisín, where he was a star ship chaplain alongside parodies of Spock and Kirk.\n\nAdditionally, in \"Night of the Nearly Dead\", Ted rereads William Shatner's TekWar.\n\nFishCenter Live[]\n\nIn the American television series FishCenter Live, the starship USS Fishcenterprise (NCC-1065) is featured on the show. It was first shown in the episode broadcast Thursday, December 13, 2018.\n\nIn the episode broadcast Thursday, February 13, 2020, the hosts play a clip from 2015 of the old co-host Drew. In his workspace, Drew has four Star Trek: Ships of the Line calendars (Star Trek Calendar Poster (2016) (2015), Star Trek: Ships of the Line (2009) (2008), Star Trek: Ships of the Line (2010) (2009), Star Trek: Ships of the Line (2011) (2010)) and Hot Wheels models of the USS Kelvin from the 2009 film Star Trek and USS Vengeance from the 2013 film Star Trek Into Darkness.\n\nFor All Mankind[]\n\nAn alternate history series developed for streaming service Apple TV+ revolving around the premise that it was the Soviet Union that had won the spacerace by putting the first man on the Moon, instead of the USA. The series was conceived by its showrunner Ronald D. Moore who brought with him the writer/producer team he had previously worked with on Deep Space Nine and Battlestar Galactica, David Weddle and Bradley Thompson in addition to his personal production associate Maril Davis. Other former Star Trek production colleagues who later on joined the production team included Naren Shankar, Joe Menosky, Mike and Denise Okuda. Former Star Trek performers included David Gautreaux in a guest role, whereas Linda Park recurred in the second season as a newscaster.\n\nMoore has stated in several interviews that as far as he was concerned, that his alternate history show was \"(…)like the road to Star Trek. This is like the road that gets you to that kind of optimistic future where technology is our friend and where we solve a lot of the problems here on earth and we go forward as a better race\". [8]\n\n\"Hi, Bob\" (S01E07)[]\n\nForced to rewatch a taped episode of The Bob Newhart Show over and over again during their long stay on the American moonbase Jamestown, astronaut Danielle Poole proves herself to be a hardcore \"Trekkie\", when she correctly identifies John Fiedler as a former guest star on The Original Series in the episode \"Wolf in the Fold\".\n\n\"The Weight\" (S02E05)[]\n\nAfter veteran NASA astronaut Ed Baldwin has ran into hot water with his wife Karen, he suggest as a goodwill gesture to go see the recently released Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan film. Karen confesses that she had already seen the film with their daughter while also, in a spiteful mood, dropping the \"and then Spock dies\" bomb.\n\n\"Triage\" (SO2E09)[]\n\nAfter tensions rise dramatically upon the assault by Soviets on the American moonbase, the planned goodwill coupling of the Apollo-Soyuz modules, both already in orbit around Earth, is seemingly put on hold forever, much to the frustration of Apollo commander Danielle Poole. Poole decides on her own to push ahead regardless, surmising it will ease tensions considerably by quoting James T. Kirk, \"We're Human beings with the blood of a million savage years on our hands. But we can stop it. We can admit that we're killers. But we're not going to kill today. That's all it takes. Knowing that we're not going to kill today.\" Her co-astronaut correctly identifies the quote stemming from The Original Series, which Poole acknowledges as \"\"A Taste of Armageddon\", Season 1, episode 23, first aired February 23rd, 1967\". \"Hardcore,\" her colleague concedes appreciatingly. Poole's hunch incidentally, turns out to be correct, as the Apollo-Soyuz coupling actually pushes the world back from the brink of starting a third world war.\n\nFOX NFL Sunday[]\n\nComedian Jimmy Kimmel occasionally gives his picks for the week's games in a William Shatner/James T. Kirk impression. He once said. \"I'm the... quarterback! Which would... mean... I'm the captain!\"\n\nFranklin & Bash[]\n\nStarring Malcolm McDowell, with guest appearances by Robert Pine, Jason Alexander, John de Lancie, Peter Weller, Daniel Roebuck, and Gates McFadden.\n\n\"Pilot\"[]\n\nPindar describes Infeld's office building as being Borg-like.\n\n\"Good Cop/Bad Cop\"[]\n\nKarp derisively calls Infeld's firm \"Deep Space 9.\"\n\nFrasier[]\n\nFrasier contains several jokes and references to Star Trek. Star Kelsey Grammer, who plays Dr. Frasier Crane, had appeared on Star Trek: The Next Generation as Captain Morgan Bateson in TNG: \"Cause And Effect\" (Grammer is admittedly a Star Trek fan). Supporting cast member Dan Butler had appeared in VOY: \"Vis à Vis\" as Steth. Frequent guest star Bebe Neuwirth, who played Dr. Lilith Sternin, also guest-starred on The Next Generation as Lanel in TNG: \"First Contact\". Another one-time TNG actor, Saul Rubinek, who played Kivas Fajo in TNG: \"The Most Toys\", had a recurring role as Donny Douglas in the show's seventh through tenth seasons. The Frasier sets on the Paramount lot were also located beside the sets from The Next Generation, Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, Star Trek: Voyager, and the first three seasons of Star Trek: Enterprise.\n\nProduced by Paramount Television, the sitcom Frasier was a direct spin-off of the hugely successful Cheers sitcom – featuring Kirstie Alley as member of the principal cast in later seasons – , also produced by Paramount. The series was based upon one of its progenitor's principal characters, Frasier, already played by Grammer, with most of the others – including Neuwirth but excluding Alley – later making guest appearances in Frasier as their Cheers alter egos. Frasier has rivaled its progenitor in acclaim, popularity, and success. Cheers itself was considered one of the greatest triumphs of Brandon Tartikoff, then head of NBC, the network that aired both Cheers and its spin-off. Incidentally, Tartikoff declined purchasing The Next Generation for his network, which had aired The Original Series back in the 1960s, yet also became directly responsible for the inception of not only Cheers, but once head of Paramount Pictures of both Deep Space Nine and the Next Generation film series as well. Rick Berman, before he became the head of the Star Trek franchise, had been the main executive, responsible for studio production oversight of Cheers. Her role in Cheers has propelled Alley to stardom, and was often cited as the reason why she has never reprised her role as Saavik in Star Trek. (see article background for particulars)\n\n\"Frasier Crane's Day Off\"[]\n\nAfter Frasier overdoses on medication to combat his flu, in his delirium, he goes down to the KACL radio station and locks himself inside the broadcast booth to continue hosting his show. His producer, Roz Doyle, calls security to come and fetch him, claiming \"Captain Kirk's got control of the bridge and he's gone insane!\"\n\n[]\n\nFrasier and Niles support a candidate for Congress only to later learn that he believes he was once abducted by aliens. After deciding that it was probably a one-time incident brought on by stress, the brothers agree to continue supporting him. Frasier says the candidate still needs to seek professional help and asks Niles whether he'd treat him. Niles responds \"I'm a doctor, not a miracle worker.\"\n\n\"The Last Time I Saw Maris\"[]\n\nKACL's resident Star Trek fanatic Noel Shempsky (played by Star Trek: Voyager guest actor Patrick Kerr), who keeps an autographed photo of Captain Kirk in his cubicle, seeks Frasier's support on a petition to the producers of Star Trek suggesting a new character: \"the all powerful space vixen Rozalinda, four-breasted queen of the planet Rozniak.\" Frasier signs the petition, much to the chagrin of Roz.\n\n\"Roz, A Loan\"[]\n\nAt the end of the fifth season, Frasier inadvertently got all of his colleagues fired as the owner dropped the talk format and went to Salsa. Noel Shempsky remained at the station as he spoke fluent Spanish. On his return, Frasier asks how he's doing and Noel replies that he's still working on his English-Klingon dictionary. Frasier then asks how do you say \"goodbye\" in Klingonese (Krish-Krush) which Noel doesn't initially pick up the subtle hint. Frasier upsets Roz and in order to make amends, he changes his pompous, ego-centric return speech into one extolling Roz's virtues. Noel discovers the switch and begins reading from it to which Frasier angrily yells \"Krish-Krush, Noel, Krish-Krush.\"\n\n\"Star Mitzvah\"[]\n\nFrasier seeks Noel's help to learn Hebrew to speak at his son Frederick's bar mitzvah. Noel agrees, only if Frasier can obtain for him Scott Bakula's autograph at a nearby Star Trek convention (one he cannot attend personally due to William Shatner's presence and Shatner's restraining order against him). Frasier, however, is unable to fulfill Noel's request. Out of revenge, Noel instructs Frasier in the Klingon language, which he claims is Hebrew. He later learns that Frasier did obtain one of Joan Collins' wigs from TOS: \"The City on the Edge of Forever\" for him, and is greatly moved, but too late to catch Frasier and admit his revenge plan. Frasier delivers his speech at Frederick's bar mitzvah in Klingon, much to everyone's embarrassment, except for a Trekkie friend of Frederick's who later translates the speech from Klingon to English for Frasier's son, noting it's much more beautiful \"in the original Klingon.\" This is a parody of Chancellor Gorkon's line \"You have never experienced Shakespeare until you have read him in the original Klingon,\" from Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country.\n\n\"Lilith Needs a Favor\"[]\n\nWhile Lilith travels on an airplane to visit Frasier in Seattle, she sits next to a man, Albert, (played by Brent Spiner) whom she describes as \"white as a sheet.\" The man replies \"actually, I'm always this pale.\" As Data, Spiner's makeup required him to have a pale skin complexion.\n\n\"The Show Must Go Off\"[]\n\nFrasier finds one of his childhood heroes, Jackson Hedley, at a sci-fi convention he attends to buy comic books for his son, Frederick. Hedley, a former Shakespearean actor, has been making a living on the convention circuit ever since he was cast in the television show Space Patrol. Frasier and Niles decide to produce a show, and cast Hedley, hoping that he will be able to restart his career. They soon discover that Hedley is a talentless ham, only they couldn't see it when they were children.\n\nWhile at the convention, Frasier asks a man dressed as a Klingon for help finding the comic books and thanks him by saying \"You're a fierce but helpful people.\" Roz also runs into Noel and a friend of his; they're both wearing Original Series-era Starfleet uniforms.\n\n\"Star Trek: Voyager Audition\"[]\n\nAlthough not an episode of Frasier, the principal cast of Frasier participated in a live on-stage sketch on the occasion of an official Star Trek 30th anniversary studio celebration, where they were \"recreating their audition\" for Voyager, although the actors (David Hyde Pierce, John Mahoney (complete with easy chair and beer can), Jane Leeves, Peri Gilpin, and Moose the dog) were in-character as their Frasier persona, being dressed in Starfleet uniforms notwithstanding. Absent from the sketch were principal cast regular Kelsey Grammer and supporting cast regular Dan Butler, both of whom having played other characters on The Next Generation and Voyager, respectively.\n\nThe sketch had Captain Janeway (Kate Mulgrew) trying to command Voyager with these \"wacky crewmembers.\" However, trouble begins when Roz won't stop talking to someone about an Aldebarian that she is going to have a date with, which prompts Niles to quip \"Sounds like this Aldebarian is about to boldly go where so many have gone before.\" Then, an alien message cannot be received after First Officer Niles engages a banality filter which keeps Voyager from being bothered by any messages that are \"overly insipid or jejune.\" When Captain Janeway orders him to disengage it, he laments that he can't even \"get my phaser to stop flashing twelve o'clock.\" Lieutenant Daphne suggests using her alien telepathic powers to communicate with the alien ship, but Janeway claims that she's not from another planet, she's just from England. When she uses her psychic abilities, she finds a strong sense of the aliens expressing a desire to breed with the Voyager crew, but quickly realizes that she's actually sensing Niles. A Klingon enters the bridge from the turbolift with Eddie, Martin's dog, and complains he was found on the Klingon homeworld digging up azalea bushes after the Klingons just finished landscaping. Martin offers him a strip of latinum which appeases the Klingon, but claims if Eddie does it again, the Klingons will destroy the Federation, to which Janeway claims \"that sounds reasonable.\" Ultimately, the crew's bickering annoys Janeway to the point that she activates Voyager's auto-destruct sequence and destroys the ship.\n\nThe performance has been registered and is featured in the celebratory documentary, Star Trek: 30 Years and Beyond.\n\nFreaks and Geeks[]\n\nIn the pilot, Neal Schweiber asks permission to sit at a lunch table with two other geeks by impersonating captain Kirk, addressing them as Bones and Spock, and asking them if he could join them in the Enterprise mess room because he's so hungry he could eat a tribble. When Bill doesn't get it, he sarcastically claims he's impersonating John Wayne.\n\nIn \"Tests and Breasts\", a sex ed teacher is able to deduce that an anonymously submitted question comes from Sam because he's the only one with Star Trek notebook paper.\n\nFresh off the boat[]\n\nIn \"Blind Spot\", when Evan contracted chicken pox, his mother Jessica Huang quarantined him by sending him to the front lawn. During the quarantine, both made the Vulcan salute across the window glass as Jessica Huans said the famous line, the needs of the many outweighs the needs of the few.\n\nThe Fresh Prince of Bel-Air[]\n\nIn the opening of the episode \"Will Gets a Job,\" Will acts out the crew of the original Enterprise while using the oven. One notable reference is the \"I'm a doctor, not a...\" paraphrase, when Will says, \"Jim, I'm a doctor, dammit, not a short-order cook!\"\n\nThe episode \"Eye, Tooth\" guest stars William Shatner as himself, in which Carlton's obsession with him (as well as Star Trek) causes him to stalk Shatner and follow him to a bar.\n\nWhen Will attempts to prevent Carlton from playing pool with Shatner, an argument leads to the two of them accidentally breaking Shatner's tooth. Will points out that they'll have to take him to the dentist, and Carlton says, \"Don't worry, Jim. We'll get you there, warp speed!\" Shatner answers, \"get a life!\" The two follow him to the dentist, and attempt to turn off the laughing gas that Shatner is using, but unintentionally set the gas free. As it fills the whole room, Will, Carlton, and Shatner get high on the gas and imitate Star Trek characters.\n\nShatner hugs Will and says, \"Spock, is that you? Your ears are the same but something's different!\" He then turns to Carlton and says \"Uhura! Hey, open up a hailing frequency!\" After laughing some more, Carlton replies in a Scottish accent: \"Captain! The dilithium crystals are almost gone! The matter-antimatter reactors are failing!\" Shatner responds, \"Scotty, you're... black!\" Afterwards, he jumps up and says, while high, \"The bridge, it's changed! Spasers on spun... Oh, my tooth! Bones, fix it!\" To which Will replies, \"Dammit, Jim. I'm a black boy from Philly, not a doctor!\"\n\nBefore Shatner appears on Hilary's show, an Asian man walks by. Shatner, still high, grabs him and says \"Sulu, where you been? And why are you out of uniform?\"\n\nFriends[]\n\nFriends contains a few references to Star Trek by Chandler Bing and Ross Geller, who are referenced as being nerds throughout the series.\n\n\"The One With the Sonogram at the End\"[]\n\nRoss shows the gang the sonogram of his child, and the group makes jokes while trying to decipher the image. Joey asks, \"What are we supposed to be seeing here?\" to which Chandler replies, \"I don't know, but I think it's about to attack the Enterprise.\"\n\n\"The One With the List\"[]\n\nDuring calling the printer company's hotline, Chandler gets angry, because he notices they watch Star Trek in the background. Later during the call he is told that Spock is hugging his father (something which never happened in the show).\n\n\"The One Where Monica and Richard are Just Friends\"[]\n\nChandler tells Ross that an incident involving Phoebe's boyfriend is a no-win scenario. He calls the situation the Kiryat Moriah. Ross informs him that the no-win scenario is actually called the Kobayashi Maru, and that the Kiryat Moriah was the name of hotel they stayed in when traveling in Israel.\n\n\"The One With the Cat\"[]\n\nRachel is trying to make Ross angry by saying things he doesn't agree with. She says \"I do think Kirk was smarter than Spock\". Ross pretends not to be angry and leaves, and then Chandler turns to Rachel and asks \"You were kidding about the Kirk/Spock thing though, right?\"\n\n\"The One With the Cuffs\"[]\n\nAn encyclopedia salesman is testing Joey's knowledge, to prove that Joey really needs an encyclopedia. He asks \"What do you know about vulcanized rubber?\". Joey replies: \"Spock's Birth Control.\"\n\n\"The One With the Secret Closet\"[]\n\nChandler and Joey are trying to open a closet in Monica's apartment to find out what is inside it. There is a moment when Chandler shouts in an over-the-top manner, \"There's got to be a way!\", to which Joey replies \"Easy there, Captain Kirk\".\n\nFringe[]\n\nProduced by J.J. Abrams, Alex Kurtzman and Roberto Orci, and featuring Leonard Nimoy.\n\n\"Ability\"[]\n\nRobert Jones, a prisoner who managed to build a teleporter in a previous episode, is described as \"clever enough to Star Trek himself out of a maximum security German prison\".\n\n\"The Road Not Taken\"[]\n\nA conspiracy theorist (played by Clint Howard) claims to be Spock, and that renegade future Romulans are trying to change the timeline by creating super soldiers, like Khan Noonien Singh.
