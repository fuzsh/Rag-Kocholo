Howard Hunt\n\nAround the world, the James Bond films have continually been enormously amusing fantasies. To those of us who served in covert operations overseas with the Central Intelligence Agency and before that the Office of Strategic Services, the Bond films often occasioned chuckles. If only our missions were as consistently exciting as those of ! Probably less than five percent of any Bond film was rooted in reality; the rest was inspired filmmaking fiction. Sure, we utilized protective gadgets and ingeniously disguised weapons, and, yes, I often found myself engaged in precarious and menacing situations, but more regularly I fought paperwork and internal bureaucracy rather than giant steel-toothed assassins. Furthermore, the presumption was that any exotic beauties encountered on foreign soil were likely to be enemy agents. An Intelligence agent must have anonymity as his goal; he spends his entire professional life developing a cover identity. If a maître d’or bartender in town knows who you really are, chances are that the enemy does as well. You wouldn't survive long enough to sip your first vodka martini. Intelligence work offers the enticement of being “in the know.” In the , we approached our work with deadly seriousness; there was little time for frivolity as not only our lives but also those of many more around the world were at risk. The stakes were too high to fool around. It takes years to train an agent. I matured professionally during the Cold War, although nowadays many young people don’t want to put that kind of time into sharpening their capabilities. They are required to have certain language skills, but now the demand is away from the Romance languages. It’s the exotic tongues, like Korean, Arabic, Swahili, Urdu, and Farsi, that are needed. And in reality, few are willing to go through that learning ordeal for a government salary unless the person is unusually dedicated. Qualified people would like to join but often can’t afford to\n\n\n\nFOR YOUR EYES ONLY\n\nbecause they can start out at massive corporations with a much better entry level. The mind-set required for a life of covert operations is rare indeed. Ian Fleming probed that psychological makeup in the James Bond novels and consequently won many fans within Intelligence services, including  and my boss Allen Dulles,  director from  to . Dulles was intrigued by Fleming’s grasp of espionage methods and operations and felt that the Bond films cast a favorable light on the Intelligence services of the Western world. Although several actors have depicted James Bond, his persona has remained essentially the same. The Bond character brings with it a sense of style and a casual attitude that blend into continental glamor. Even the beauties he beds add to his charisma by becoming “the Bond girls.” This fictional character is not troubled with kitchen cares or any activity that could make Bond seem at all commonplace, although the Bond stories do give the reader a basic education in the kingdom of wines and distinctive culinary tastes. Very quickly, James Bond became a role model for young men intrigued by this upper-class English clubman. His fans return repeatedly to escape the reality of ordinary, routine lives. No matter how vicious the hand-to-hand combat between Bond and the killer-of-the moment, he never fails to win so that good may prevail over evil. Bond has never appealed to hard-core feminists, who would prefer a less masculine hero. Since James Bond embodies so many masculine elements, his character is not about to change. David Giammarco has produced a unique examination of the Bond legend. He enjoyed unparalleled behind-the-scenes access to the Bond principals, as reflected in this book, making it much more than a rote listing of  films. So here’s a toast to James Bond on his th anniversary: we’ll always need men like him.\n\nE. Howard Hunt Brown University (-) United States Navy (-)  (-)  (-) The White House (-)\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nAs a print and broadcast journalist for over  years, I’ve traveled around the globe many times over, covering leading entertainment and political figures. From legendary actors, directors, and all of Hollywood’s A-Listers to prominent leaders from the White House, Senate, Pentagon, , and , I’ve interviewed and rubbed shoulders with many significant world figures. But some of the greatest thrills of my career have been on the sets of the James Bond films. I’ve been on countless high-profile movie sets over the years, but nothing compares to the sheer spectacle and excitement of being behind the scenes of . No matter how jaded or cynical a person may be, he or she will become the proverbial kid in a candy store walking into the world of a James Bond film. I’ve witnessed many respected and high-profile visitors turn into giggling school kids on the Bond sets. It's an amusing reaction that is testament to the enduring fascination with Bond, a connection that taps directly into our childhood fantasies, when James Bond became our first awe-inspiring cinema experience. The first interviews I ever did as a young reporter were with Roger Moore and Sean Connery, and I have spoken with most of the Bond filmmakers and actors from the past four decades. So it seems somehow fitting that I should write this book: not only to share the fascinating stories, anecdotes, and incomparable experiences of being behind the scenes on the  films, but also to document the ingenuity and dedication of the many artists who helped craft the indelible world of James Bond. Ian Fleming’s literary creation proved inspired source material, and his spirit has continued to be honored throughout the film series. The same applies to Albert “Cubby” Broccoli and Harry Saltzman, the formidable and tenacious producers who shepherded Bond to the silver screen and never relented in their goal to dazzle moviegoers. Broccoli was instrumental in creating a “Bond family,” and that has held true to this day — not only are there many original crew\n\n\n\nFOR YOUR EYES ONLY\n\nmembers still working on Bond, but so are their second- and third-generation offspring. The Bond crew are some of the industry's hardest-working people, and their loyalty to the Bond family is unwavering. They consider it an honor to be part of the Bond legacy and go far beyond the call of duty to uphold those enormous standards. Broccoli’s daughter Barbara and his stepson Michael Wilson rose through the ranks and are now at the helm of the Bond series. They have adhered strongly to Cubby’s traditions while also smoothly and seamlessly updating Bond for a whole new century of moviegoers. The results have been stellar, as Pierce Brosnan’s Bonds have taken the series to all-time box office heights. With this book, I have aimed to connect the past with the present while focusing on this new era of James Bond. Over the past  years, a plethora of  imitators have come and gone, each hoping to duplicate the Bond success. Even recent films like Vin Diesel’s  have tried to blatantly steal the Bond thunder, and Mike Myers’ Austin Powers movies have banked on an unabashed spoofing of the series. But in the end, there is only one James Bond. Worldwide audiences are quite discerning when it comes to the genuine article, and they hold a deep-rooted affection for the iconic screen hero. The box office might is unsurpassed, and the record-breaking video and  sales of the back catalogue show that the demand for Bond is stronger than ever. So it seems Broccoli and Saltzman displayed remarkable prescience back in  when they named their company Eon, for James Bond has truly stood the test of time. With the th  adventure, Die Another Day, the phenomenon has reached another milestone in its distinction as the longest-running and most successful film franchise of all time. This year’s th anniversary of the James Bond films has proven that, indeed, nobody does it better. David M. Giammarco September \n\nCHAPTER\n\nThe Man with the Golden Pen\n\n1\n\nIn , Ian Fleming was asked by a friend what he intended to do after the war. “Why, write the spy novel to end all spy novels” was his rather pithy reply. Although it would take another eight years before Casino Royale was published, the then -year-old Naval Intelligence officer had no idea just how prophetic his playful boast would prove. The literary introduction of licensed-to-kill British Secret Service agent James Bond amid the baroque splendor of the Royale-les-Eaux casino was a sly juxtaposition of the dirty business of espionage with the gleaming polish of society’s elite. James Bond became as much cloak-and-dagger adventure as a style guide of mannered taste and worldly sophistication. James Bond was also a probe into the darker recesses of the human psyche and a navigational tool of post- World War II geopolitics as polarities shifted and Cold War paranoia ushered in a new era of global war games. “History is moving pretty quickly these days and the heroes and villains keep on changing places,” wrote Fleming in Casino Royale. Bond was seen, however, as an incorruptible constant in that murky battle of good versus \n\n\n\nFOR YOUR EYES ONLY\n\nevil, a reassurance that Britain — and by extension the Western world — were still in good hands. But the literary Bond was also a reluctant hero, his pessimism mastered only by his fierce loyalty to the British Empire. He was a highly skilled and patriotic civil servant willing to die in service to Her Majesty the Queen. Cold, ruthless, and emotionally scarred, Bond was a loner haunted by demons he could never quite vanquish, as hard as he might try through innumerable vices and indulgences. But at their core, the Bond novels were good old-fashioned adventure stories — plain and simThe Spymaster: Ian Fleming poses for the ple. They were thrilling excursions camera in 1963. that captured the imaginations of readers, providing vicarious sex, violence, and exotic locales for those of more routine lives. Fleming would pen  Bond novels in total, and by the time of his death in August  of a heart attack at age  there were more than  million Bond paperbacks in print in America alone. At the dawn of the st century — nearly  years since Casino Royale first appeared — the figure had risen to over  million copies sold. Fleming would enjoy only a brief taste of the worldwide film phenomenon his writing would inspire — he passed away having seen only the first two screen adaptations — which soon became the most successful film franchise in motion picture history. It’s been estimated that over half the Earth’s population has seen at least one Bond movie, with total box office receipts well past the $ billion mark so far. As one of the biggest pop culture icons of the th century, James Bond has attained a mythological status, an\n\nThe Man with the Golden Pen\n\n\n\nimmortality that even his creator’s wild imagination would have summarily dismissed as completely implausible. Born into privilege on May , , in Mayfair, Ian Lancaster Fleming was the second of four sons of Major Valentine Fleming, a Conservative Member of Parliament who was killed at the Battle of the Somme in , when Ian was only eight years old. Winston Churchill was one of the notables among the Fleming family’s circle of friends and, in fact, wrote the major’s obituary for the London Times. Ian’s mother, Evelyn, was a talented violinist who often gave recitals at Pitt House, the Flemings’ Georgian mansion on the brow of Hampstead Heath. Ian’s paternal grandfather, Robert Fleming, was a private banker and an associate of J.P. Morgan, who had backed the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. But young Ian would soon rebel against the staid traditions and grand expectations that distinguished his affluent and influential lineage. Entering Eton at age , Fleming excelled at athletics but was often a troublemaker and his obstinacy frequently invoked the ire of the headmaster. An apt student who was easily bored, Fleming had to drop out of Eton (like Bond) and was sent by his mother to various private schools in England and Austria. Fleming had already gained a reputation for girls, cars, and mischief when he entered Sandhurst, England’s military academy, in . He proved himself a fine marksman — he shot for Sandhurst against West Point — but Fleming’s apathy towards army life led him to drop out after only one term. With an eye on a diplomatic career, Fleming then moved on to the Munich and Geneva universities, where he cultivated his writing skills, learned French and German, and indulged in his favorite pastimes of skiing, climbing mountains, and chasing women. But after failing to make the grade on the Foreign Office examination (he came in th out of the  applicants), Fleming abandoned the hope of becoming a diplomat and returned to London, where a family friend offered him a job at the Reuters news agency. Fleming would soon make his name as a reporter in March  at the age of , when he was sent to Moscow to cover the famous trials of six British Metro-Vickers engineers accused by the Stalin regime of spying and sabotage. Inexperienced, but with his imaginative flair, Fleming impressed\n\n\n\nFOR YOUR EYES ONLY\n\nhis superiors with a knack for details and a keen grasp of international espionage. Fleming even devised an elaborate scheme to outsmart his fellow reporters by disabling their telephones, thereby beating them to the punch once the verdict was read. But Fleming left Reuters less than a year later — turning down a posting in Shanghai — to make himself some money. He went to work for a London stock brokerage firm, and throughout the rest of the ’s Fleming dedicated himself to the world of high finance. But it seemed Fleming was far more concerned with his swinging bachelor lifestyle, reveling in fine food, liquor, gambling, and a string of female beauties. However, in March , Fleming returned to Moscow at the behest of British trade minister Robert Hudson for a Russian trade mission. Ostensibly, Fleming’s duties were as a reporter for the Times of London, but actually he was secretly working for the Foreign Office, helping prepare an estimate of potential Soviet military strength and morale. With war nearing, the Secret Service had begun quietly enlisting perceptive young men, and it turned out Fleming’s older brother Peter — who had scored great success with two travel books, Brazilian Adventure and News from Tartary in the s — had already been working part time for Military Intelligence in the British  (Special Operations Executive). By all accounts, Ian Fleming’s spycraft skills were sufficient enough to impress Rear Admiral John Godfrey — Director of Naval Intelligence — who invited the -year-old Fleming to lunch at London’s Carlton Grill in May . The meeting was a success, and for the next two months Fleming was a frequent visitor to the Admiralty, immersing himself in the procedure and protocol of Naval Intelligence. By August that year, Fleming was named personal assistant to the Director of Naval Intelligence (), assuming the rank of lieutenant. By the time war was declared on September , Fleming was promoted to commander (as Bond would be too), and the distinction of his rank would be forever commemorated by the three gold bands adorning his (and Bond’s) custom-made Morland cigarettes he purchased from a small tobacconist’s shop on Grosvenor Street in London. Headquartered in Room  — his office in the nerve center of Intelligence at the Admiralty — Fleming enthusiastically embraced his new job.\n\nThe Man with the Golden Pen\n\n\n\n22 Ebury Street: Ian Fleming’s stately London home — located a mere stone’s throw away from Buckingham Palace — until his death in 1964. Note the Latin inscription above his door (right).\n\nIt seemed the restless playboy had finally found something other than girls, gambling, and exotic cars to hold his interest. Fleming’s thirst for adventure and vivid imagination dovetailed nicely with his new position in covert mission planning, as his tasks of propaganda and deception schemes evolved into full-scale military operations. “He [Fleming] always tended to be presented with the unusual jobs that no ordinary department would take responsibility for,” recalled Admiral Sir Norman Denning, a postwar Director of Naval Intelligence who crossed paths with Fleming frequently during the war. “A lot of Ian’s ideas were just plain crazy . . . but a lot of them had just that glimmer of possibility in them. Ian was the combination of an ideas man and a ‘fixer’!” Fleming would soon segue from his administrative position into the field, participating in numerous covert operations — many of which still remain cloaked in mystery. Decades later, it would be revealed that Fleming worked closely with Canadian-born millionaire and British spymaster Sir William Stephenson,\n\n\n\nFOR YOUR EYES ONLY\n\nwhose Ultra network had broken the German diplomatic code in . On one such mission, Stephenson — who represented British Intelligence in the U.S. as Director of British Security Coordination (BSC) during World War II — participated with Fleming in the surreptitious microfilming of a Japanese codebook, which they secretly removed from a locked safe located in the Rockefeller Center offices of the Japanese consul general. Stephenson was perhaps better known by his code name: Intrepid. His daring exploits — which earned him a knighthood after the war — would be chronicled later in such books as The Quiet Canadian and A Man Called Intrepid. On another transatlantic visit later in the war, Fleming ended up in Canada on the outskirts of Toronto, where Bill Stephenson had converted an old farmhouse into a secret training base for British agents. Code-named “Camp X,” the facility specialized in the art of sabotage and subversion, and Fleming participated in exercises ranging from infiltrating the main Toronto power station and placing a dummy bomb to nautical missions involving a moored tanker in Lake Ontario. The latter exercise was the Canadian spy camp’s final test, which involved a long underwater swim in the dark of night to affix limpet mines to the hull of the ship. Fleming was one of the few who actually succeeded in attaching the explosives firmly in place and escaping back to shore undetected. It was a stunt that would later surface in the plot of Live and Let Die, as would a number of other Camp X activities in later Bond novels. In Washington, Fleming also forged a friendship with General “Wild Bill” Donovan, whom President Roosevelt had appointed “Coordinator of Information.” Fleming spent a few days in Donovan’s Washington home, helping write the original charter of the Office of Strategic Services — forerunner of the Central Intelligence Agency. Donovan presented Fleming with a gift of a . Colt revolver bearing the inscription “For Special Services.” Though most of Fleming’s espionage activity was primarily cerebral, he always carried with him a commando-fighting knife — engraved with his name and rank — and a fountain pen which he claimed contained tear gas. Fleming had a particular affinity for guns, knives, and gadgets, and he maintained regular contact with technical specialists like Charles Fraser-Smith, a “Q”-like figure who crafted such gadgets as\n\nThe Man with the Golden Pen\n\n\n\nsaw-edged shoelaces and hollowed-out golf balls that were used to send messages to prisoners of war. Years later, it would also be revealed that Fleming was responsible for creating the No.  Assault Unit, an intelligence-gathering commando team he affectionately dubbed “my Red Indians.” Fleming’s elite corps of Royal Marines — or “Fleming’s Private Navy,” as they were nicknamed within Intelligence circles — accompanied attack troops for the purpose of seizing enemy codes and equipment. Fleming personally trained them in safeblowing, lock-picking, and plastic explosives, but more vital was his expertise in recognizing and capturing ciphers, codebooks, secret directives, and new weapons. The No.  Assault Unit succeeded in a number of key raids, retrieving the order of battle of the enemy fleets. After the war, Admiral Godfrey — later serving as a model for Bond’s boss “M” — would remark of Fleming’s stellar service, “Ian should have been director [of Naval Intelligence] and I his adviser.” When the war ended in , Commander Fleming joined the Kemsley Newspapers as foreign manager, charged with keeping track of foreign correspondents and advising at editorial conferences at the London Sunday Times — a position he would hold until . Fleming’s contract stipulated that he receive a two-month vacation each winter, which he faithfully spent in Jamaica every year from  until his death. He had fallen in love with the island after visiting during an AngloAmerican naval conference in  and shortly thereafter asked his good friend, American millionaire Ivar Bryce, to purchase a plot of beachfront property on his behalf. Fleming’s vacation home was soon built above a private cove near the tiny banana port of Oracabessa on Jamaica’s beautiful north coast. He christened the property “Goldeneye,” a nod to the code name of one of his secret World War II operations, which involved overseeing stay-behind allied agents in Spanish ports in the event the Iberian Peninsula was overrun by the Germans, and also the title of the Carson McCullers novel Reflections in a Goldeneye. It would be here, in the sun-drenched sojourns of Fleming’s annual retreat, that a legend would be born. Fleming appropriated the name of his fictional hero from a favorite book that graced his coffee table — Birds of\n\n\n\nFOR YOUR EYES ONLY\n\nBond’s Birthplace: Ian Fleming’s three-bedroom house Goldeneye on Jamaica’s north shore, offering sweeping vistas of the nearby reef and Caribbean ocean.\n\nthe West Indies — by American ornithologist James Bond. “I wanted the simplest, dullest, plainest-sounding name I could find — James Bond seemed perfect,” Fleming would later explain. “I was determined that my secret agent should be as anonymous a personality as possible. It struck me that his name — brief, unromantic, and yet very masculine — was just what I needed.” Inspired by his idyllic Caribbean paradise and fueled by a need to “take my mind off the shock of getting married at the age of ” after years of much-cherished bachelorhood, Fleming pounded out Casino Royale on his portable -year-old Royal typewriter in less than  weeks. On March ,  — six days after completing the manuscript — Fleming married Lady Anne Rothermere in a civil ceremony in Port Maria, Jamaica, witnessed by Fleming pal and neighbor Noel Coward. At the time, Anne was already pregnant with the couple’s son Caspar. Anne Rothermere was a beautiful, strong-willed, and cultured socialite who had gained notoriety for her marriage to newspaper magnate Lord\n\nThe Man with the Golden Pen\n\n\n\nRothermere as well as her infamous luncheons and dinners that boasted the literary world’s biggest names. The morning after exchanging their vows, Ian and Anne Fleming flew back to London and with them the manuscript of Casino Royale. Over lunch with friend and author William Plomer, Fleming mentioned that he had written a novel. Plomer — who had worked with Fleming in Intelligence during the war — was now associated with British publisher Jonathan Cape and, with his curiosity piqued, offered to give Fleming’s manuscript a read. Plomer suggested some minor revisions, but overall he found it a compelling thriller and recommended its publication to Jonathan Cape. Fleming celebrated by buying himself a new typewriter — but no ordinary model by any means. It was a rare gold-plated version of the Royal Quiet de Luxe, which cost $. Perhaps the rather extravagant indulgence foreshadowed Fleming’s soon-to-be Midas touch. (Forty-two years later, the infamous typewriter sold for £, at a Christie’s auction in London. The anonymous buyer was rumored to be Pierce Brosnan, although the actor has since denied it.) And so it was, on April , , that James Bond made his debut in England to mostly positive reviews, although in its first year Casino Royale sold a mere , copies. American reaction was even less enthusiastic, as three prominent U.S. publishers turned down the book for its lack of “believability.” But Macmillan Publishing finally took a chance on Bond and published Casino Royale in . It sold fewer than , copies in the U.S. that year, yet Fleming had already written a follow-up entitled Live and Let Die, which took Bond to Harlem, Florida, and Jamaica. All the while, Fleming continued to indulge in journalism as a columnist for the Sunday Times, where his various foreign assignments would further inspire and shape the burgeoning world of . Despite mediocre sales in the U.S., Fleming consistently churned out a new Bond thriller every winter escape. Remarked Fleming: “Would these books have been born if I had not been living in the gorgeous vacuum of a Jamaican holiday? I doubt it.” Intrigued by the possibilities of a fresh television hero, the  network optioned Casino Royale from Fleming for its weekly live telecast Climax Mystery Theater. American Barry Nelson — not Sean Connery — would\n\n\n\nFOR YOUR EYES ONLY\n\nbe the first actor to portray , and Peter Lorre — as Soviet master spy Le Chiffre — became the first Bond villain. But the hour-long pilot failed miserably. Hampered by an embarrassingly minuscule budget and ridiculous Americanization of the British agent, the October  broadcast barely registered with critics or in the ratings.  quickly pulled the plug on plans for a weekly series. Disappointed, and anxious for some extra income, Fleming ended up selling the movie rights for Casino Royale to film director Gregory Ratoff for a mere $,. Hopes for a big-screen treatment, however, soon evaporated as Bond failed to garner much interest in Hollywood. This was the case again in , when actor Ian Hunter’s purchase of a six-month option on Fleming’s third novel, Moonraker, also came up snake eyes. Further stabs at film and  productions followed throughout the rest of the ’s, but all seemed to stall in the early planning stages. Spurred on somewhat by the cursory interest, Fleming continued penning new  escapades, confidant Bond would bring him the commercial success he longed for. In a letter to his New York agent, Fleming wrote: “I have an idea that one of these days the film and television rights to James Bond and his adventures may be worth quite a lot of money.” He never fathomed, however, just how lucrative those rights would become. With the publication of his sixth novel, Dr. No, in , Fleming started sensing an increasing literary respect for his spy thrillers. The fan base was slowly expanding across cultural and ideological divides as the groundswell of interest grew for the exploits of James Bond. Notables from Somerset Maugham and Raymond Chandler to Prince Phillip and  Director Allen Dulles all became vocal champions of Fleming’s work. John F. Kennedy was another Bond devotee, and a chance Washington encounter between Fleming and Senator Kennedy on March , , resulted in an invitation to Kennedy’s Georgetown residence that evening. Over dinner, talk ranged from American politics to Fleming’s unique theories on dealing with Cuba and the Soviet Union. Their lively exchange that night left a lasting impact on Kennedy, who was at once charmed by Fleming and puzzled by some of his more fanciful ideas. Fleming went on to develop a relationship with the Kennedy family, sending inscribed copies of\n\nThe Man with the Golden Pen\n\n\n\nJust another day at the office for Hugh M. Hefner, one of James Bond’s original proponents in the early 1960s. (right) Author David Giammarco with Hugh Hefner at the Playboy Mansion\n\nhis books to  and Robert Kennedy as well as to their sister Eunice. The bond between  and Fleming would prove most fortuitous for Fleming when, in the spring of , President Kennedy released to Life Magazine a list of his top  favorite books. Right up there with the biographies of world leaders and intellectual nonfiction was Ian Fleming’s From Russia with Love. It was a big boost to Fleming’s career, and almost overnight James Bond became an American sensation. Fleming would return the favor later in The Man with the Golden Gun by having Bond read Kennedy’s Profiles in Courage. The nudging of Bond into the cultural zeitgeist had begun, fueled in no small way by Hugh Hefner’s enthusiastic embrace of the stylish secret agent, whose sophisticated taste, sexual freedom, and wolfish charm was the archetype of the Playboy philosophy. “Two of the major cultural phenomena to come out of the s were Playboy and James Bond, and they were very closely related,” explained Hefner during an early evening chat at the Playboy Mansion West. Dressed in his de rigueur smoking jacket and silk pajamas, Hefner recalled the early alliance formed between them. “In the late ’s, Ian Fleming came to Chicago, and one of our editors took him on a tour around\n\n\n\nFOR YOUR EYES ONLY\n\nthe city because he was doing research for his book The Wicked Cities and wanted to see some of the major gangland crime sites, like the site of the St. Valentine’s Day Massacre.” Fleming stayed for dinner that night at the mansion, and Hefner remembered Fleming telling him that, “‘if James Bond was a real person, he would definitely be a Playboy subscriber.’” The two titans of titillation struck up a friendship, and, when Hefner Framed reminder of Ian Fleming displayed expressed plans for acquiring a resort inside Goldeneye’s main house. hotel in Jamaica and building a Playboy club, Fleming wrote him a letter, alerting Hefner to the destructive force of Jamaica’s hurricane season. Playboy would end up becoming the first American magazine to publish James Bond when Fleming’s short story “The Hildebrand Rarity” debuted in the March  issue. The tradition continued as Playboy began serializing the novels prepublication, starting with On Her Majesty’s Secret Service in April, May, and June of . “It’s funny, I remember my editorial director wasn’t happy with the title of On Her Majesty’s Secret Service and wanted to change the name,” chuckled Hefner. “And I said, ‘No, you can’t change the title — that’s what they’re going to be using on the book!’” Later, The Property of a Lady, You Only Live Twice, The Man with the Golden Gun, and Octopussy would all appear first in the pages of Playboy magazine. It was a symbiotic swinging ’s relationship made in th heaven that has continued to this day. Fleming reveled in the attention his mythical alter ego was receiving, knowing full well the payoff of big-film money — something which had eluded him for so long — was finally close at hand. And he was right. But perhaps Fleming sensed the reward would arrive too late in the game, for he once wrote that “Gamblers, just before they die, are often given a great golden streak of luck.”\n\nThe Man with the Golden Pen\n\nFleming’s Bond Books: Year indicates U.K. First Edition\n\n Casino Royale  Live and Let Die  Moonraker  Diamonds Are Forever  From Russia with Love  Dr. No  Goldfinger  For Your Eyes Only  Thunderball  The Spy Who Loved Me  On Her Majesty’s Secret Service  You Only Live Twice  The Man with the Golden Gun  Octopussy The Short Stories:\n\n For Your Eyes Only “From a View to a Kill, Quantum of Solace, Risico, The Hildebrand Rarity”  Octopussy “The Living Daylights, The Property of a Lady” Fleming’s Other Works:\n\n The Diamond Smugglers (nonfiction)  Thrilling Cities (nonfiction)  Chitty Chitty Bang Bang\n\n\n\nCHAPTER\n\n2 His Words Were Their Bond: Broccoli & Saltzman “What Ian Fleming wrote were paperbacks for all the little suburban people who spent every day travelling backwards and forwards to work on a train and needed something for a thrill,” opined British filmmaker Peter Hunt, who, as one of the original architects of James Bond’s cinematic foray, laid an indelible foundation upon which all subsequent Bonds would be built. “Fleming’s books were written very much in that fast, paperback pulp style. So I remember I said to myself, ‘Well, why can’t we have paperback films?” As editor of the first five Bond films and director of the sixth, Peter Hunt was instrumental in crafting the visual style and brisk pace that immediately distinguished James Bond from other films. Along with Ken Adam’s inspired production design, Terence Young’s stylish direction, Maurice Binder’s sensual title sequences, and John Barry’s electric  scoring, a unique behind-the-scenes alchemy was achieved that would forever transform cinema. Of course, all the elements would never have fused so brilliantly were it not for two hungry and tenacious producers eager to jump-start their careers: Albert R. Broccoli and Harry Saltzman. \n\n\n\nFOR YOUR EYES ONLY\n\nSpy vs. Spy: Ian Fleming’s early apprehensions about Sean Connery playing his literary hero were long vanquished by the time of this conversation on the set of From Russia With Love in 1963\n\nBy , Ian Fleming had grown weary of the many failed attempts to bring James Bond to the big screen. The British film industry had shown little interest in Bond during the ’s, preferring instead the grim social realism of kitchen sink dramas and World War II adventures. And across the pond, America’s flirting with the idea had yielded disappointing results. The closest Fleming came to a major deal occurred when his trusted friend Ivar Bryce introduced him to Kevin McClory, an eccentric young Irish director who had just completed his first film — The Boy and the Bridge. Fleming was impressed by McClory’s enthusiasm, and the three of them soon decided to put together their own Bond production: Fleming would pen the screenplay, Bryce would produce, and McClory would direct. The project would film in the Bahamas, where they would benefit from the Eady Subsidy Plan — a financial incentive for filmmakers shooting in Britain and the Commonwealth countries. Instead of adapting one of Fleming’s already existing novels, it was\n\nHis Words Were Their Bond: Broccoli & Saltzman\n\n\n\ndecided to create an entirely new adventure, one with a more exaggerated cinematic bent. Aided by screenwriter Jack Whittingham, Fleming and McClory fleshed out the tentatively titled Latitude 78 West, which involved the hijacking of atomic bombs from a jet aircraft. But their collaboration collapsed when circumstances forced Bryce to withdraw as financier, and McClory couldn’t persuade any U.S. studios to pick up the proposed $ million project. It was a failed effort that would have enormous repercussions, haunting Fleming the rest of his life and proving a never-ending thorn in the side of future Bond producers for decades. With the Latitude 78 West project suddenly dead in the water, Fleming returned to Goldeneye in . He began work on his eighth Bond novel and introduced the sinister crime organization known as  — Special Executive for Counterintelligence, Terrorism, Revenge, and Extortion — run by Ernst Stavro Blofeld. But some elements of the Latitude treatment lingered in Fleming’s mind, and he incorporated them into the book he entitled Thunderball. When McClory read an advance copy of Thunderball in early , he and Whittingham sued Fleming for infringing on their joint copyright. Since there had been no definitive agreement signed by the parties during their preproduction work on the project, publication of the novel proceeded. However, the judge in the case eventually awarded McClory and Whittingham screen rights to Thunderball as well as cocredit on all future editions of the novel. The bitter court battle — which would drag on for three years — took a severe toll on Fleming. He suffered his first heart attack on April , , only days into the long-running ordeal. Then in June , as he lay recuperating at the London Clinic, Fleming finally received word that James Bond was indeed going to live twice. Canadian film producer Harry Saltzman sent Fleming a get-well greeting and a note, detailing plans for a James Bond deal at United Artists in the States. It was the best news Fleming had received in a long time. Born in Saint John, New Brunswick, Saltzman spent his formative years in Sherbrooke, Quebec, and then New York City, where he developed a strong passion for vaudeville. At , Saltzman ran away from home and joined a traveling circus, where he was schooled in the art of flashy\n\n\n\nFOR YOUR EYES ONLY\n\nshowmanship. It would be a skill put to good use when he began booking and promoting his own vaudeville acts up and down the East Coast. He eventually upped the ante by moving to Paris, where he continued his vaudeville endeavors in the French music halls. When World War II broke out, Saltzman joined the Royal Canadian Air Force and later the Office of Strategic Services (), reportedly serving as an Intelligence field officer in Europe. After the war, Saltzman moved back to New York City and resumed booking entertainment acts, eventually segueing into the burgeoning world of television. By the mid-’s, Saltzman had produced Robert Montgomery Presents and Captain Gallant of the Foreign Legion for American . But with his sights set on the film business, Saltzman figured he could make a bigger splash in a smaller pond by moving to England, where he soon formed an independent production company with director Tony Richardson and playwright John Osborne in . Dubbed Woodfall Productions, their partnership was responsible for three of England’s most critically acclaimed films of the era: the adaptation of Osborne’s play Look Back in Anger (with Richard Burton), The Entertainer (with Laurence Olivier), and Saturday Night and Sunday Morning, which not only made a star of a young Albert Finney, but was also hailed as the finest of the kitchen-sink dramas dominating British cinema at the time. Despite the success of his social realism films, Saltzman sensed that moviegoers would soon be looking towards more escapist fare, and he wanted to be at the forefront. His plans, however, conflicted with those of his partners’, and Saltzman ended up resigning from Woodfall in late . Seeing a potential bonanza in the James Bond novels, Saltzman arranged to meet with Ian Fleming through their mutual lawyer — Brian Lewis. At London’s West End club Les Ambassadeurs, Saltzman sold Fleming on a deal of $, for a six-month option on all the Bond novels (except for Casino Royale, which Fleming had already sold to Gregory Ratoff). Saltzman also pledged to pay Fleming an additional $, per Bond film made, plus a percentage of the net profits (reportedly five percent). But Saltzman’s ambitious dreams for a big-screen Bond bonanza were quickly dashed in the wake of the apathetic response from financial\n\nHis Words Were Their Bond: Broccoli & Saltzman\n\n\n\nbackers. Bond was still considered an unproven commodity at that point, and, with significant capital invested, Saltzman was at wit’s end as his sixmonth option was rapidly running out. With only weeks remaining on the deal, Saltzman received a pivotal telephone call. His friend, writer Wolf Mankowitz, told him that another producer — Albert R. Broccoli — was also a Bond enthusiast and eager to secure the rights. Broccoli — who, along with his producing partner Irving Allen, had produced such films as The Cockleshell Heroes and The Trials of Oscar Wilde — had coincidentally tried to purchase the Bond rights from Fleming two years earlier, but the venture had been quickly vetoed by Irving Allen, who didn’t view Bond as a viable screen endeavor. Broccoli had severed their partnership shortly thereafter and decided to take a solo go at producing. When Mankowitz arranged a meeting between Broccoli and Saltzman in June , Broccoli was determined to buy out Harry Saltzman’s Bond option. But Saltzman had other ideas. Born in Queens, New York, in , Albert Romolo Broccoli became better known to his friends simply as “Cubby” — a nickname given to him as a youngster by a cousin. Cubby’s father and uncle had emigrated from Calabria, Italy, at the turn of the century and began importing the vegetable that bore their name. Albert spent his childhood working in the family’s garden, where he would help pick, wash, and pack the vegetables at their Astoria farm and then deliver them to the produce market in Harlem via horse-drawn cart. But laboring as a broccoli farmer was a family tradition young Albert did not wish to continue. After his father, Giovanni, died, Albert began taking odd jobs in New York and eventually went to work selling coffins at his cousin’s casket company, later becoming manager of the establishment. It was a comfortable living, but Broccoli had loftier dreams. At the invitation of his Los Angeles-based cousin Pat DeCicca (who was married to actress Thelma Todd), Broccoli moved to Hollywood in the mid-s, where he supported himself selling beauty supplies and Christmas trees. He would soon land a job in the mailroom at th Century Fox, and later a chance encounter with the legendary Howard Hughes would provide him with an entree into film production. Hughes was producing the  film\n\n\n\nFOR YOUR EYES ONLY\n\nThe Outlaw, starring his girlfriend, Jane Russell, and offered Broccoli a job as an assistant to the director, Howard Hawks. After that, Broccoli continued to work on various films before joining the war effort in  by enlisting in the U.S. Navy, where he eventually earned his lieutenant’s stripes. Returning to Hollywood after  Day in September , Broccoli joined Famous Artists, a thriving talent agency run by Charles K. Feldman. Always a quick study, Broccoli learned the A candid 1976 shot of Bond producer “Cubby” Broccoli business side of Hollywood on location in Egypt for The Spy Who Loved Me. and soon became a successful agent in his own right. Broccoli started making some real money and would often gamble it away in Las Vegas, accompanied sometimes by pal Howard Hughes. After years of brokering deals and contract negotiations, Broccoli was itching to tackle the more creative aspects of filmmaking — namely producing. But there was little room in Hollywood at the time for independent producers. Frustrated by the lack of opportunity, Broccoli teamed up with an old high school friend — Polishborn director Irving Allen — and the pair moved to London, where they established a company called Warwick Pictures (they took the name from the New York hotel they stayed at while formulating their game plan). Armed with their considerable Hollywood contacts, the benefit of Britain’s Eady Subsidy plan, and Howard Hughes agreeing to bankroll their first film, Broccoli and Allen signed Alan Ladd to a three-picture contract\n\nHis Words Were Their Bond: Broccoli & Saltzman\n\n\n\n(left to right) “Cubby” Broccoli, Roger Moore, and director John Glen relax in Greece on the set of 1981’s For Your Eyes Only. (Photo courtesy of John Glen)\n\nand secured Columbia Pictures as their principal distributor. Their first film was The Red Beret in , which turned a tidy profit and gave them a foothold as producers. Incidentally, The Red Beret would prove significant in another respect: its crew included future James Bond director Terence Young, screenwriter Richard Maibaum, and cinematographer Ted Moore. Over the next seven years, Warwick churned out  films, mostly slick adventure movies — among them were Hell below Zero, No Time to Die, The Cockleshell Heroes, Interpol, and The Killers of Kilimanjaro — and established expat Americans Broccoli and Allen as Britain’s reigning independent producers. But the enormous commercial failure of ’s The Trials of Oscar Wilde dealt a major financial blow to Warwick, further\n\n\n\nFOR YOUR EYES ONLY\n\ndeteriorating the already strained relationship between the two men. Later that year, they agreed to dissolve their partnership and went their separate ways. Broccoli had never quite gotten over Allen’s refusal to support him on the James Bond proposal in  — something he was quite passionate about, so, when the opportunity arose again through Saltzman, Broccoli jumped at the chance to make his mark as a solo producer. But Saltzman wasn’t interested in selling Broccoli his screen option on James Bond. Despite his discouraging failure to secure a production deal, Saltzman was still anxious to produce a  series — so he suggested to Broccoli they go into business together. With only  days left on the option, Broccoli agreed to a - partnership split with Saltzman, and they formed Eon Productions (long believed to stand for “Everything or Nothing” — although that assumption has been challenged by Broccoli’s stepson Michael Wilson). Well acquainted with the studio hierarchy at Columbia Pictures, Broccoli approached them first. But Coumbia’s studio heads, like their many predecessors, turned the Bond project down. With time quickly ticking away, Broccoli then hastily arranged a meeting with Arthur B. Krim, the president of United Artists. Broccoli and Saltzman, as well as their wives, Dana and Jacqueline, and Broccoli’s -month-old daughter, Barbara, flew to New York on June , . Walking into their meeting the following day, Broccoli and Saltzman were surprised to find  members of the  board of directors waiting for them, including chairman Robert Benjamin. Fortunately, a young David Picker — who had just been promoted to head of production — was also in attendance. Picker was very familiar with Fleming’s work and an admitted James Bond fan. Buoyed by Picker’s enthusiasm, which was echoed by  London chief Bud Orenstein, Krim hammered out a six-picture deal with Broccoli and Saltzman in less than an hour. Even more remarkably, it was all sealed by a handshake. Now that they were officially in the Bond business, Broccoli and Saltzman’s next step was to form Danjaq (an abbreviation of their wives’ first names, Dana and Jaqui). Danjaq was a Swiss corporation that would hold the Bond film rights, while Eon Productions — a subsidiary of Danjaq — would actually produce the films. Broccoli and Saltzman proposed a\n\nHis Words Were Their Bond: Broccoli & Saltzman\n\n\n\nbudget of $. million for the first Bond film, but United Artists trimmed it back to just under a million dollars. However, they were all in agreement that Thunderball should be the first  adventure to launch the series — it was the most recent of Fleming’s novels, and the plot line, which involved the theft of atomic bombs from , added a thrilling Cold War relevance. But the escalating McClory-Whittingham Thunderball litigation against Fleming presented too many legal entanglements, so they chose Fleming’s  novel, Dr. No, instead. Screenwriter Richard Maibaum — who had already worked for Broccoli on a number of his Warwick adventure films — was signed on to adapt the novel alongside Wolf Mankowitz (who would later drop out of the project and request his name be removed from the credits). Meanwhile, the search for an appropriate British director with a strong visual style began in earnest. Original choice Guy Hamilton (who would later direct Goldfinger) was interested, but family concerns prevented him from a long absence on location in Jamaica. Directors like Ken Hughes, Guy Green, and Bryan Forbes were also offered the job, but all politely declined. Finally, Broccoli and Saltzman settled on Terence Young, who had helmed some of Broccoli’s earlier films for Warwick. Little did they realize what a pivotal role Young would play in transforming Bond into a cinema icon. With the main crew slowly assembling in the late summer of , the only question remaining was who would play James Bond. Broccoli was adamant that he be an Englishman but one who was rugged and not afraid of fisticuffs in order to appeal to American audiences. Cary Grant expressed interest, as did James Mason, but both were reluctant to commit to a series of  films. Other names that surfaced as possibilities were Richard Burton, Peter Finch, Rex Harrison, Trevor Howard, and Fleming’s personal choice: David Niven. Niven had been a friend of Fleming since World War II, when the actor also had served in the British Secret Services. But a limited budget, coupled with their desire for a long-term commitment, made it clear to Broccoli and Saltzman that they’d have to forgo a big star in favor of an unknown whom they could cultivate in the role. Up-and-coming actors like Patrick McGoohan and Richard Johnson were considered, as was a young Roger Moore, who also had Fleming’s approval.\n\n\n\nFOR YOUR EYES ONLY\n\nMeanwhile, speculation was growing in the British press as to who would land the coveted role. A poll in the Daily Express invited readers to vote on their favorite choices, and among the top contenders were Roger Moore — who by then was already signed to a  contract and therefore no longer available — and a little-known Scottish actor named Sean Connery. Connery had already been brought to the attention of Broccoli and Saltzman through editor Peter Hunt, who suggested the actor as a possibility in October . “I had actually known Sean a long while because when we were making The Admirable Crichton [] Sean Connery and our star of the film, Diane Cilento, were having an affair,” recalled Hunt. “They were practically living together, so I used to see him quite often. Flash ahead a few years, and one night a group of us were having dinner at the Polish Club in London, and Harry Saltzman started talking about this film he was going to make called Dr. No and that they were looking for an actor to play Bond. And at the time, I was doing a film with Sean called On the Fiddle for producer Ben Ficz. Alfie Lynch was the star of the film, and Sean was the second lead. So I offered to send Harry a reel of Sean’s work and let them have a look at him. I was still in the midst of cutting the film at the time, so I just put some pieces together and sent it over to Harry and Cubby. And that’s how it all started.” What prompted Hunt to suggest Connery for the role of Bond was that “he not only had extraordinary presence and was very handsome and masculine, but he always reminded me of a sort of young Clark Gable,” explained Hunt. “And having already read several of the Bond books, I was pretty familiar with the material and felt Sean could do a really good job in the part.” Broccoli then also took a look at Connery’s  Disney film Darby O’Gill and the Little People, and both producers soon agreed that the -yearold Connery could be their man. The deciding vote ended up coming from Broccoli’s wife, Dana, who deemed Connery “a very sexy guy.” Broccoli and Saltzman quickly called in Connery for a series of interviews at their South Audley Street offices. They were immediately struck by his assertiveness and his bearing. They also liked the way he moved. After Connery left one of the early meetings, Broccoli and Saltzman went to the window and watched\n\nHis Words Were Their Bond: Broccoli & Saltzman\n\n\n\nhim cross the street. There was grace yet undeniable determination in his stride or, as Broccoli would later describe it, “a pantherlike prowl.” It would be that walk across the street that sealed the deal for Connery. Though it took some convincing, Broccoli and Saltzman eventually sold United Artists on the unknown actor, and they signed Connery to a five-year contract, with one of his few provisions being that he be allowed to make other films in between Bonds. On November , , it was announced to the world that Sean Connery was James Bond. One of Broccoli and Saltzman’s first steps was to polish the rugged Scotsman from Edinburgh’s working class into the dashing yet debonaire Englishman of Fleming’s novels. The task fell on the shoulders of director Terence Young, who himself possessed all the panache and savoir faire of Fleming’s fictional hero. “Terence really was James Bond,” chuckled Hunt, recalling the urbane Irish filmmaker, who was a contemporary of Ian Fleming. “In fact, I think he was more like James Bond than even James Bond!” Young immediately began grooming Connery in his own image, taking him to his personal tailor and boot maker. He escorted Connery to many fittings, from the Savile Row suits meticulously crafted by famed tailor Anthony Sinclair to the hand-woven shirts and neckties from Turnbull & Asser. Not only did Connery have to look the part, but Young insisted he also live the part. Young introduced Connery to the exclusive world of the St. James Club and took him to some of the most expensive restaurants in Mayfair, schooling him on everything from vintage wines to culinary delights. “Terence never really got the full credit, but he really did mold the screen version of James Bond,” related director John Glen, who began his long-running association with the Bond films early in the series. “Terence was a real English gentleman, very well educated, and knew everything about the finer things in life. He was the perfect man to take Sean and knock him into shape.” Though filming was due to begin in Jamaica in January , Broccoli and Saltzman still had to cast Bond’s leading lady — the seductive seashell collector Honey Ryder, whom Bond first meets on the beach of Crab Key. But the search suddenly halted when a photograph of a stunning young Swiss beauty passed across Saltzman’s desk. It was a shot of\n\n\n\nFOR YOUR EYES ONLY\n\nA State of Andress: Sean Connery with Ursula in a 1962 publicity photo for Dr. No.\n\nHis Words Were Their Bond: Broccoli & Saltzman\n\n\n\nthen-little-known actress Ursula Andress — dripping wet and clad in a soakedto-the-skin white shirt — taken by her husband, actor John Derek. At first reluctant to take the role — Andress thought the script was silly — she was eventually persuaded by Derek. (Coincidentally, Derek’s third wife — blonde bombshell Bo Derek — would be approached years later by Broccoli to appear in the  Bond film For Your Eyes Only. Bo politely declined the offer.) The emergence of Ursula Andress from the Caribbean sea One of cinema’s most indelible screen entrances: Ursula singing “Underneath the Andress emerging from the sea singing “Underneath The Mango Trees,” wearing a Mango Tree.” In the book, Honey Ryder rises from the white bikini and a hunting water wearing only a knife belt, but on screen, that was knife on her hip, became considered a Dr. No-no. one of cinema’s most breathtaking and memorable introductions. Sexy, scantily clad, and supremely resourceful, Andress’s Honey Ryder set the standard for all Bond Girls to come. Next to the opening gun barrel sequence, Andress remains the most iconic image of the entire Bond series. Andress’s only feature that didn’t make it to screen, however, was her voice; her accent was deemed too pronounced, and Peter Hunt had to hire actress Monica Van der Zyl to redub her vocals in postproduction (Van der Zyl would go on to loop a number of Bond actresses, including Claudine Auger in Thunderball).\n\n\n\nFOR YOUR EYES ONLY\n\nReturning to Pinewood Studios in late February to begin interior shooting, two actors then joined the production in what would become key roles: British character actor Bernard Lee as Bond’s no-nonsense superior “M” and Canadian-born actress Ursula Andress and Ian Fleming in conversation on the Lois Maxwell as his Jamaican beach set of Dr. No, nearby to Fleming’s superbly efficient, loveGoldeneye retreat. lorn secretary Miss Moneypenny. Lee (who passed away in ) would go on to portray M for the next  Bond films, while Maxwell would continue as Moneypenny for . Along with Desmond Llewelyn, who would be introduced as “Q” in the second Bond film, From Russia with Love, Lee and Maxwell became beloved, venerable fixtures in the cinematic world of . The role of Moneypenny came at a crucial juncture in Maxwell’s life; her husband, Peter, had fallen ill, and she was in dire need of funds to help care for their two young children. “My husband had a heart attack and was quite sick for months,” recalled Maxwell at her home outside London. “So I was forced to ring several directors and producers with whom I had already worked and ask them for a job. I told them how terribly ill Peter was, and with two little children I desperately needed the money. I said I would play anything. And Terence was the first one to respond.” After  days, Dr. No finally wrapped principal shooting on March , . Despite a limited budget, the behind-the-scenes craftsman worked wonders. “I remember all of us who worked on the film went to a screening of the rough cut and thought it was marvelous,” smiled Maxwell. “Instead of just being an ordinary spy film, there were all these amusing\n\nHis Words Were Their Bond: Broccoli & Saltzman\n\n\n\nbits. There was a tongue-in-cheek sense of humor that took the mickey out of the spy genre. That was very much Terence, really.”  wasn’t as amused when it viewed the film. “United Artists didn’t like it at all, quite frankly,” recalled Hunt with a chuckle. “They thought it was a piece of rubbish!” As a result, United Artists decided to banish Dr. No to the drive-in circuit and second-run movie houses in America’s Midwest. No Hollywood or New York premieres were planned. The lackluster studio reaction was not a sentiment shared by Playboy publisher Hugh Hefner — noted cinephile and one of Bond’s first American champions — who secured an early print of Dr. No and gave it his stamp of approval. “We ran Dr. No at the Playboy Mansion in Chicago about four or five weeks before it actually opened in America,” recalled Hefner. “And I was particularly impressed by the extent of the character, of the structure, and how they were able to get so many things right in that very first movie. It was all there.” But the nominal American release troubled Broccoli and Saltzman tremendously. If Bond didn’t catch on in the U.S., then their plans for a long-running franchise were doomed. Nevertheless, the star-studded U.K. premiere went ahead as planned on October , . The overwhelming response quickly put Broccoli and Saltzman’s fears to rest. Dr. No was a box office success, becoming the second-highest-earning film in Britain in . American audiences were equally enthusiastic, and with U.S. box office receipts piling up United Artists gave the go-ahead for a second Bond film. Bolstered by ’s public endorsement of From Russia with Love,  decided to adapt that novel for the next outing. From Russia with Love was given twice the budget of Dr. No, and filming began on April , , with Terence Young once again at the helm. The demand for Bond was so great that the film held its world premiere only two months after filming wrapped, on October , . It quickly became the highest-grossing film in British cinema history. “We were all working for the same ends in those days,” reflected Peter Hunt. “Everybody contributed ideas, and we all built on each other. There weren’t any egos involved — it was always about making the best possible film.” On the other side of the Atlantic, From Russia with Love pulled in an astonishing $ million — an enormous sum at the North American box office in .\n\n\n\nFOR YOUR EYES ONLY\n\nReflecting on that surprising embrace of James Bond, Connery offered his theory: “I think it had a great deal to do with timing,” he surmised. “For example, the reason the books became such a success in England initially was that they came along after the war, at a time when England had just finished rationing. And here was Fleming, writing about an eccentric character with a great finesse and taste in wine, women, and food, living extremely well. There was a great fantasy element, with all the sort of sexual fantasies of the healthiest, most virile bachelor. Then when the films came along, after many sociological dramas and kitchen-sink dramas dominating the screen, Bond was seen as pretty straightforward fun, with a very basic theme of good against evil. There was also a lot of sex, a lot of color, but all tastefully done . . . sort of sadism for the entire family.” United Artists no longer viewed Bond as a one-off adventure and soon shared Broccoli and Saltzman’s vision of an extremely lucrative franchise. And while James Bond would form a permanent relationship with United Artists, the alliance between Broccoli and Saltzman proved less stable. Despite a strong mutual respect, they had very different personalities. Essentially, their only bond was Bond. “It was a very complex relationship between Cubby and Harry,” explained Guy Hamilton, who was hired to direct the next Bond film, Goldfinger. “Cubby just wanted to concentrate solely on producing the Bond films. And Harry wanted to take over the world. He would say stuff like ‘Metro is going for sale, why don’t we buy that, Cubby?’ That is how their split began to develop.” Bond screenwriter Tom Mankiewicz echoed Hamilton’s thoughts. “For Cubby, Bond was his baby. He absolutely loved it, and that became his mission in life. He didn’t want to own General Motors, he didn’t want to have his own studio. He just wanted to do Bond movies. But for Harry, Bond was his grubstake to an empire. He was an empire builder and wanted to produce every film, control every studio, and run the businesses of the world.” Meanwhile, Sean Connery was beginning to feel left out of the enormous profits generated by Bondmania around the globe. “Sean had a problem on Goldfinger,” related Guy Hamilton, “which was that Dr. No had been a success, From Russia with Love had been an even bigger success, and yet Sean was still under a five-year contract. He was very unhappy about the\n\nHis Words Were Their Bond: Broccoli & Saltzman\n\n\n\nGentlemen Prefer Bonds: (left to right) Cubby Broccoli, Harry Saltzman, and Roger Moore on location in the Louisiana Bayous for 1973’s Live and Let Die.\n\namount of money he was receiving now that he was such a big attraction. And as I said to Sean, ‘If I controlled the money, I would give it to you. But I’m not the paymaster. You’ve got an agent, you’ve got a business manager — they’re the ones who have got to sort this out.’ So there was quite a lot of ‘sorting out’ going on backstage, and the contract was later revised.” After Goldfinger broke all box office records in  and firmly established  as a global phenomenon, Broccoli and Saltzman’s next headache became Kevin McClory. The director started touting a rival Bond production based on his co-ownership of the Thunderball rights. Though Broccoli and Saltzman had commissioned Richard Maibaum to write a new treatment for Thunderball, they reluctantly gave McClory a producer credit and percentage of the profits on the  film. It was a decision meant to forestall any possible legal action, but more importantly it was intended to protect their series from any outside competition.\n\n\n\nFOR YOUR EYES ONLY\n\nAs Thunderball took Bond to spectacular new heights, the clamor for anything  became relentless by the mid-s. Film and  imitators began popping up regularly, like The Man from , I Spy, and the Mel Brooks spoof Get Smart on television and Our Man Flint and the Matt Helm series on the big screen. From uncertain beginnings, the Bond films had exploded into the greatest box office force of the ’s. The impact of Bond on the cultural landscape cannot be overstated. It stretched far and wide, crossing language barriers and political boundaries and ideologies into the upper echelons of government. Even the real spy world began taking cues from Bond. Though not permitted to be publicly screened in the Soviet Union, the  films became compulsory viewing for all  agents. Bond’s ingeniously lethal gadgets were being duplicated for use in the field, and his exploits were regarded as inspirational espionage techniques. Future  Roger Moore told me of one such confession from a high-ranking Intelligence official. “I was at lunch one day with the ex-head of French Intelligence, and he was telling me how he used to sneak out to see the Bond films,” marveled Moore. “But he couldn’t watch them in Paris; he had to fly to Geneva to see them because it wouldn’t look good for the head of French Intelligence to be caught watching a bloody  movie!” The Bond films had thoroughly captivated audiences through their exotic locales, fascinating characters, outrageous stunts, ingenious gadgets, thrilling action, and titillating sex scenes. Less ecstatic with the 007 phenomenon, however, were film censors on both sides of the Atlantic. Their opposing mandates towards the rigorous violence and brazen sexual innuendoes forced them to work overtime in negotiating acceptable cuts with the filmmakers. In Dr. No, Bond’s coldblooded shooting of Professor Dent had to be trimmed from six shots to only two, while United States censors fought unsuccessfully to change Pussy Galore to “Kitty” Galore in Goldfinger. However, the name of Pussy Galore was eventually banned on Goldfinger publicity and promotion materials in America, which referred to her instead as simply “Miss Galore” or “Goldfinger’s personal pilot.” Censors were always on high alert trying to decipher subtle offenses slipped into the Bond films. Though an aggravating ordeal, the filmmakers soon took delight in their attempts to outwit censors.\n\nHis Words Were Their Bond: Broccoli & Saltzman\n\n\n\n“The British censors were only concerned about the violence, and they gave us a hard time on every film,” related Guy Hamilton. “So we used to show them the film without the full dub or the sound effects. Without the full effect of bonecrunching and grunts and impacts, those fight scenes suddenly seemed rather innocuous. On the other hand, the American censors were only concerned with the sex — to the point of lunacy. If you look in one of the scenes, behind Bond Pussy in the Sky with Diamonds: Honor Blackman as a hundred yards away there Goldfinger’s personal pilot, which caused are a couple of girls running problems galore with film censors in 1964. past, and you can see a flash of a bare breast. But the censor spotted that immediately. So what I would do is put things in for him to cut out, and then I’d roll on the carpet saying ‘But that ruins the whole scene!’ By doing that, it would come down to ‘Okay, you can get your two cuts’ — which I didn’t want anyway — ‘if I can keep the other three which you’re making such a fuss about.’” Frequently more problematic, however, were Maurice Binder’s electrifying and risqué title sequences. Binder’s trademark of acrobatic nude female silhouettes flowing sensually amid stunning visual pyrotechnics continually pushed the boundaries. “The titles were actually the raciest things about the Bond films,” chuckled Roger Moore. “Maurice was always getting into trouble for showing too much. I remember going down to watch him shoot one day, and there were all these wind machines and naked girls, and he’d\n\n\n\nFOR YOUR EYES ONLY\n\nbe having to smear down their pubic hairs with Vaseline because they were blowing in the wind.” Behind the scenes, Binder became equally famous for delivering those title sequences at the last minute. “We used to sometimes only get the titles just the night before the premiere of the film,” grinned Peter Hunt. “He drove us mad.” But Binder’s logic seemed to be an attempt to prevent any possible censorship. It didn’t always work. “In some countries, my film On Her Majesty’s Secret Service wasn’t directed by anybody,” laughed Hunt, “because underneath my directing title Maurice put four beautiful nude girls that slid into the frame with their nipples pointing straight out. The censors quickly took the scissors to it. So the film ran without a director’s credit in some places.” The greater dilemma that soon faced Broccoli and Saltzman was how to continually top themselves after cultivating such voracious appetites in moviegoers. Audiences had enormous expectations for each new Bond film, and the producers weren’t about to disappoint them. Broccoli and Saltzman were always faithful to that old show business adage of giving audiences what they want. Huge budgets soon pushed the scope and scale of ’s adventures to outlandish proportions. Where James Bond had previously relied on his wits and cunning to outwit and outmaneuver opponents, he was becoming little more than the means to introduce eye-popping hardware and stunning visual effects. Connery was not happy. “I remember when I was asked to do Goldfinger, I started sensing a dangerous trend,” explained Guy Hamilton, “in that Bond was becoming this Superman in a way. I was very concerned about that. Because there’s no excitement if you know he’s going to win every time. That was one of my prime concerns and is why I emphasized, for example, that there was no way Bond could physically beat Oddjob. Bond had to outsmart him.” By ’s You Only Live Twice, Connery had had enough. Bond had overtaken his life, and he felt suffocated by his infamous alter ego. Connery was also frustrated that the lengthy shooting schedules weren’t allowing him to do many film projects outside Bond. When he announced that he would not be returning for the next  film, On Her Majesty’s Secret Service, Broccoli and Saltzman had to begin a search for a worthy replacement. Unfortunately, novice actor George Lazenby wasn’t what the Bond audiences wanted in\n\nHis Words Were Their Bond: Broccoli & Saltzman\n\n\n\n. The film’s disappointing box office only fueled Saltzman’s increasing restlessness with the Bond films. Already distracted by other business ventures and side film projects, Saltzman decided that he and Broccoli would alternate producing chores on future Bond productions. “They started quarreling on my film and began not speaking to each other,” recalled On Her Majesty’s Secret Service director Peter Hunt. Broccoli’s success in securing Connery for one more turn as Bond in ’s Diamonds Are Forever helped stabilize the series once again. Coscreenwriter Tom Mankiewicz related a tense moment early in production: “Sean, I think, had it in his contract that Harry was not allowed to be on the set if he was going to do the movie; he hated Harry. And because of that, Harry showed up in Las Vegas the first night of shooting, and everybody went ‘Oh, boy — that’s all we need is Harry Saltzman! Now Sean is going to walk off the picture.’ So here we all were, huddled in Sean’s trailer as shooting was about to start, and suddenly Harry strode up and knocked on the door. Sean opened the door and said ‘Harry!!’ and gave him a big kiss on the forehead.’” Mankiewicz couldn’t help but laugh at the memory. “Harry immediately turned bright red and flew back the next day.” Though Broccoli and Saltzman had their differences, they still made a formidable producing team. “Harry was absolutely full of ideas . . . some of them completely ridiculous,” chuckled Peter Hunt. “You kind of had to hold him back. But he was a great raconteur and could laugh at himself. Cubby was the more relaxed of the two — rather kind-hearted, who could soothe anyone’s hurt feelings.” Essentially, they were a superb good cop–bad cop team, each savvy enough to reach his objectives through opposing means. “Though Cubby had an avuncular appearance, Cubby was nobody’s fool,” related Roger Moore, who ushered in a new era of James Bond with ’s Live and Let Die. “As a producer, Cubby was very caring, and everyone loved him. So much so that, if he said to the crew ‘Jump over that cliff,’ they would. He won their total respect. I remember oftentimes he would be out all night with us on location and would go into the kitchen and cook spaghetti for the entire crew. “Frequently, when we were on location, we were near casinos,” continued Moore. “Cubby loved to gamble, so we all would be there, and I\n\n\n\nFOR YOUR EYES ONLY\n\nremember one time he started noticing the crew were losing all their money in the casino. So he had the accountant only let them have % of their salary, so that when they got home they would get the rest and wouldn’t be broke. And oftentimes I’d see him go from table to table where the boys were playing roulette or blackjack, and he’d hand them all a pile of chips. Cubby was a very generous man.” “Cubby wanted everyone to enjoy in his success,” added Spaghetti Western: Cubby “ Mangia! Mangia!” Mankiewicz. “I remember he Broccoli serves up his famous pasta dish to cast would always give a great tip and crew on location in Cairo for The Spy Who wherever he went. I once said Loved Me. Meanwhile, Roger Moore tries his best to him, ‘Wow, that’s an outto stir, not shake, the Bolognese sauce. rageous tip,’ and he said, ‘Remember this: for every dollar you give away, you’ll get a hundred back. And for every buck you steal, you’ll lose a thousand.’ I never forgot that.” Saltzman, meanwhile, wasn’t being as wise. Bored with his Bond duties, he was focusing most of his energies on outside ventures, including the purchase of Technicolor — an idea that didn’t interest Broccoli but that Saltzman went ahead with anyway. It soon became his undoing. “Harry was a very bright man, but he started making one bad investment after another,” explained Mankiewicz. “And part of the bylaws of their company Danjaq was that you couldn’t put up stock in Danjaq as collateral for loans without telling the partner. You couldn’t do it, but somehow Harry did. Harry was convinced that, when his train came in and he made a huge fortune, it would all be just fine.\n\nHis Words Were Their Bond: Broccoli & Saltzman\n\n\n\n“Then one day, the United Bank of Switzerland called him and wanted their money,” continued Mankiewicz. “He didn’t have it, so they said, ‘Then we have to take your stock in Danjaq.’ When Cubby found out, he said, ‘Wait a minute — you can’t take his stock in Danjaq because he had no right to put it up!’ Harry was now bankrupt, and the only way he could get out of bankruptcy was to sell his half of Danjaq.” In , just  years after first optioning Ian Fleming’s novels, Saltzman sold his stake in the Bond partnership to United Artists, leaving Broccoli as the sole producer. Saltzman’s last film would be ’s The Man with the Golden Gun. Litigation entanglements delayed the next Bond film until , but The Spy Who Loved Me and then ’s Moonraker became the biggest Bonds of the entire series. At the  Oscars, Broccoli was awarded the prestigious Irving J. Thalberg Award in recognition of his legendary producing career. Nearly five years later, Broccoli would receive the Order of the British Empire for his outstanding contributions to the British film industry, as well as the French Commandeur des Arts et des Lettres. Broccoli continued to pilot the films with unwavering enthusiasm and dedication throughout the ’s, even as Fleming titles began to run out, even though Kevin McClory released rival Bond film Never Say Never Again with Sean Connery, and despite the fact Roger Moore was replaced by new  Timothy Dalton. All the while, Broccoli had been keeping Bond in the family by mentoring stepson Michael Wilson in the business of Bond since the mid-’s. Along with his half-sister Barbara Broccoli, Wilson assumed the producing reins just as  number five Pierce Brosnan helped propel the franchise Cubby Broccoli poses in front of the under-construction to its biggest box office 007 Soundstage at Pinewood Studios in 1976. returns ever.\n\n\n\nFOR YOUR EYES ONLY\n\nSaltzman and Broccoli eventually reconciled in the s. In , Saltzman died of a heart attack at the age of . Broccoli was in failing health himself at the time but was anxious to see footage of the still-inproduction Goldeneye before he passed away in June  at the age of . Broccoli had always insisted that Ian Fleming’s name would be honored in the credits of every Bond film. The Broccoli family has continued that tradition and added another one — every Bond film will also bear the title “Albert R. Broccoli’s Eon Productions presents.” Shortly before he died, Cubby was still concerned about his beloved Bond franchise. He cautioned Barbara and Michael, “Don’t let ’em screw it up.” As James Bond’s film father, Cubby was most fearful of disappointing his audience. He fought to maintain enormously high standards and never once forgot his responsibility to always entertain. His legacy is secure as James Bond continues to do just that into the st century.\n\nCHAPTER\n\n3 Bond . . . Sir James Bond: Sean Connery\n\nThere is good news and bad news concerning Sean Connery’s muchanticipated return to the James Bond films. The good news is Connery may be interested. The bad news is reportedly no one has made him an offer. Ever since Pierce Brosnan resuscitated the Bond series, rumors have been flying that Connery will make a return to the series. Not as , however, but as James Bond’s father. Or perhaps even a villain. The Bond camp has slyly alluded to it, Brosnan told me he was hopeful, and fans rejoiced at the news of the unique casting twist. I have interviewed Connery a number of times since 8, and the subject of Bond frequently and inevitably arose. My most recent visit with Connery in his hometown of Edinburgh found the Oscar winner contemplating — and not necessarily discounting — a James Bond reunion. “I keep hearing about my supposed return every year now,” confessed Connery, relaxing on the top floor of the stately Caledonian Hotel, which sits in the shadow of Edinburgh Castle — the dark and brooding essence of Scotland’s martial past — looming dramatically above the city. Dressed neatly in a black golf shirt and black pants, the silver-haired, -year-old \n\n\n\nFOR YOUR EYES ONLY\n\nSean Connery strikes a Bondian pose for an early publicity shot.\n\nScot still cuts an imposing figure. No matter how large the room, Connery seems to fill it. It’s a physical authority, due in part to his lean six-foottwo frame, but mostly a giant persona from four decades in the elite of worldwide superstardom. When Connery sits down to talk, he immediately clears the table of obstacles — glassware, a floral arrangement — to give himself an unobstructed channel of communication. Hunched over, with elbows on the table and fingers clasped, Connery means busi-\n\nness, whether talking movies or politics. “There have been no official overtures made to me [regarding Bond], so I don’t know,” shrugged Connery. “Nobody has called. They haven’t offered me anything yet. I would certainly consider it, look at it . . . I don’t know if I could avoid it, really. “But quite frankly,” he added with his characteristic wry grin and arched eyebrow, “I don’t think they could afford me.” The fact that Connery would even consider an offer is a feat in itself. While he certainly defined the role, his ability to transcend it took a lot longer than he’d expected. As a result, Connery has always had a love/hate\n\nBond . . . Sir James Bond: Sean Connery\n\n\n\nrelationship with his famous alter ego. It did make him a global sensation and was certainly the biggest break of his career. But when Bondmania swept the planet in the mid-’60s, Connery was trapped in the center of a storm that had taken on Beatlesque proportions. In fact, James Bond and the Beatles were the two biggest pop culture icons to emerge during that decade. “And there were four of them to kick it around,” he said, admitting it took years for him to recover. Born to humble beginnings, Thomas Sean Connery grew up in a poor and rugged part of Edinburgh, near a rubber mill and a brewery. “The place smelled of rubber and hops,” remembered Connery. His father worked at the mill  hours a day, and his work ethic rubbed off on his son. “It’s blind allegiance, in a way. Therefore, I couldn’t wait to go to work.” Shortly after his brother Neil was born, nine-year-old Sean began rising at  a.m. to deliver milk before going to school. It was war time, and, while his father worked in a munitions factory in Glasgow, Sean was doing his part to keep the family afloat. “I never thought of myself as underprivileged,” he said, “because, really, I had nothing to compare my situation with.” Connery said he recalls life being “disruptive” growing up. Still, he managed to see a few movies on Saturdays, trading jam jars and beer bottles, he says, for tokens to the local movie house. He says he loved Flash Gordon, the Three Stooges, and American cowboy flicks. He dropped out of school at age  and joined the navy at . Stomach ulcers — which he blames on his inability to deal with discipline — got him discharged at . After attending a British Legion training school, he became a furniture polisher, which led to a job polishing coffins. In , while working in a London newspaper printing plant, he joined a body building club. His height and rugged good looks soon earned him jobs as a swimsuit model. When he entered the Mr. Universe competition the same year, he was invited to audition for the touring company of South Pacific. Connery wound up in the male chorus, going from town to town singing “There Is Nothing like a Dame,” he recalled. He graduated to a small speaking part and, on the road, made up for lost school time. Every day for a year, in almost every town, Connery hit the local library, reading voraciously. He also worked on his diction by reading into a tape recorder. Back\n\n\n\nFOR YOUR EYES ONLY\n\nin London, he immersed himself in theater by studying at the Old Vic. He applied himself to repertory theater and television work, making a mark for himself in a  presentation of Requiem for a Heavyweight, playing the battered protagonist. Then came a role opposite Claire Bloom in Anna Karenina. Signed to th Century Fox, Connery appeared with Lana Turner and Barry Sullivan in Another Time, Another Connery’s acting headshot from the 1950s. Place. He had just played a vicious killer in Tarzan’s Greatest Adventure and had crooned in Walt Disney’s Irish fantasy Darby O’Gill and the Little People when he got a call from two American producers — Albert Broccoli and Harry Saltzman — that would change his life forever. They had acquired the rights to several of Ian Fleming’s popular James Bond novels, and they were interested in seeing the young Scotsman. For the role of Bond, the producers had been considering more polished contenders, but in came Connery with that walk of his, a kind of fluid swagger that Broccoli later described as “the threatening grace of a panther on the prowl.” Poorly dressed and with his thick Scottish brogue, Connery delivered his theory of Bond, pounded the desk to make his points, then sauntered out, leaving the two men dumbfounded. “I used strong and commanding movements,” explained Connery of that fateful day. “Not with weight, but to show how Bond is always in control of a scene.”\n\nBond . . . Sir James Bond: Sean Connery\n\n\n\nIt worked. As did his fee of only $,, compared to those of the bigger names, who were just too pricey for the million-dollar budget of Dr. No. Connery ran with the part, adding a blue-collar arrogance to the character written by Fleming as a superbly efficient and self-assured upper-class Brit. Fleming, however, wasn’t too happy with the casting decision. “You have to remember, the ideal Bond for Fleming would have been a young David Niven,” explained three-time Bond screenwriter Tom Mankiewicz, whose father was famed Academy Award“To try and erase the image of Bond is winning director and screenwriter next to impossible,” admitted Connery Joseph L. Mankiewicz. “Fleming about his iconic alter ego. was obsessed with the fact, at least in the books, that Bond was English. And when Sean Connery was first cast, with his thick Scottish accent, Fleming was appalled. It was the purist in him. And I think he referred to Sean as that ‘great snorting lorry driver.’ But by Goldfinger time, Fleming was so impressed with Sean, and so fell in love with him as Bond, that in his last book, The Man with the Golden Gun — in which Bond retires at the end — he gave Bond Scottish ancestry. That was Fleming giving complete kudos to Sean Connery.” Connery also injected another ingredient largely alien in Fleming’s Bond: humor. It came in the form of teases — Miss Moneypenny, the secretary of Bond’s boss, became the most frequent target — and racy double entendres. In bed with yet another knockout dame — golden girl Shirley Eaton — in Goldfinger, Bond answers the phone and declines a dinner invitation with “something big’s come up.” Connery’s Bond combined levity with casual brutality and was light-footed enough to\n\n\n\nFOR YOUR EYES ONLY\n\ndodge the campy punches — not to mention dagger-tipped kicks and razor-edged bowler hats. “I look for humor in whatever I’m doing,” mused Connery, “as long as the humor fits the character and the story.” His early role models were Spencer Tracy, Cary Grant (“probably the most underrated actor to appear on screen”), Marlon Brando (“the most watchable of American actors”), and Sir Ralph Richardson. “I adored his acting,” he said. “He always found something quite humorous in his way of doing things.” Students of pop culture attribute the  phenomenon to America’s need for a suave hero after the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. On the threshold of the sexual revolution in the ’s, the Beatles were taking care of the girls, but all women wanted Bond, and all men wanted"
