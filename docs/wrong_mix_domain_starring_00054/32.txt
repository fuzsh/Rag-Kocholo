D'Abo was born on 22 January 1969 in London, England, the daughter of Maggie London, an English model and actress, and Mike d'Abo, an English singer and member of 1960s group Manfred Mann. She has an older brother, as well as two half-brothers and one half-sister: elder brother Ben, younger half-brother Bruno, and younger sibling twins Ella and Louis (born July 2007) on her father's side. Olivia and Ben both attended high school in the U.S. at Los Feliz Hills School (formerly "The Apple School") in Los Angeles and d'Abo attended Pacoima Junior High School in Pacoima, California.

She is the first cousin once removed of her father's cousin Maryam d'Abo, the actress best known for her performance as Kara Milovy in the 1987 James Bond film The Living Daylights. Olivia and Maryam bought a house together in Los Angeles when Olivia was 19.

Acting career

D'Abo's film debut was the supporting role of Princess Jehnna in Conan the Destroyer, released in June 1984. Two months later, she appeared in the supporting role of the peasant girl Paloma in Bolero (1984).

She reprised the character in the 2013 episode "The Catacombes" of the French crime series Jo, a show created by René Balcer, who also created Criminal Intent.

She has had numerous supporting roles in other television series and films, such as The Spirit of '76 (1990), Greedy (1994), The Big Green (1995) and The Twilight Zone (2002). On stage, she appeared in the 2005 Broadway production of The Odd Couple with Matthew Broderick and Nathan Lane.

In animation, D'Abo is the voices of Sonya Blade in Mortal Kombat: Defenders of the Realm (1996); Melanie Walker/Ten in Batman Beyond (1999–2000); Star Sapphire in Justice League (2001); and Morgaine le Fey in Justice League Unlimited (2004); Tak in Invader Zim (2001–2002); Jane Porter in The Legend of Tarzan; Jedi Master Luminara Unduli in Star Wars: The Clone Wars (2008); Carol Ferris in Green Lantern: First Flight (2009); and Natalia Romanoff in Ultimate Avengers and Ultimate Avengers 2: Rise of the Black Panther (both 2006).

In February 2013, D'Abo began filming for Project Fedora (working title), a video game that combines live-action footage with 3D graphics.

Music career

D'Abo is a singer-songwriter, guitarist and pianist. She has composed and performed for various soundtracks. Her single "Broken" is from the movie Loving Annabelle. Her debut album Not TV was released in July 2008.
