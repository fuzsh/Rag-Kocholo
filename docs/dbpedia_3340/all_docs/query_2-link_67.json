He was educated at Utah State University in Logan, Utah, and the Washington University School of Dental Medicine[1] in St. Louis, Missouri. Simpson practiced dentistry in Blackfoot, Idaho, before entering the U.S. House. While other members of Congress who come from a medical background prefer to be referred to as \"Doctor\" while serving in Congress (most notably former Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist),[2] Simpson does not insist that he be referred to as Dr. Simpson, preferring to simply go by Congressman or Mr. Simpson.\n\nSimpson was elected to the Blackfoot City Council in 1980. In 1984 he was elected to the first of seven terms in the Idaho State House of Representatives. Simpson served as Speaker of the Idaho State House of Representatives from 1993 until his election to the U.S. Congress.\n\nU.S. House of Representatives\n\nCommittee assignments\n\nCommittee on Appropriations\n\nSubcommittee on Energy and Water Development\n\nSubcommittee on Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies (Chairman)\n\nSubcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies\n\nCommittee on the Budget\n\nParty leadership\n\nHouse Republican Steering Committee\n\nCaucus membership\n\nHouse Potato Caucus - Co-Chair\n\nHouse Sugar Caucus - Co-Chair\n\nOral Health Caucus - Co-Chair\n\nCongressional TRIO Caucus - Co-Chair\n\nWestern Caucus\n\nNuclear Cleanup Caucus\n\nHouse Bio-fuels Caucus\n\nCongressional Sportsmen Caucus\n\nMining Caucus\n\nImmigration Reform Caucus\n\nCongressional Arts Congress\n\nRenewable Energy Caucus\n\nCongressional Native American Caucus\n\nHouse Rural Health Coalition\n\nCaucus to Fight and Control Meth\n\n2nd Amendment Caucus\n\nCongressional Taiwan Caucus\n\nIn the 111th Congress Simpson became the Ranking Member on the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Appropriations Subcommittee. With this position he is now considered a \"Cardinal\" (a term applied to the chairmen or ranking members of the Appropriations Subcommittees) within the House Republican Caucus. He also serves as the small state representative on the 33-member House Republican Steering Committee.[3] Known as the \"committee of committees\", the Steering Committee decides which Republican lawmakers become ranking members on House committees.[4] Simpson replaced Congressman Don Young (R-AK) on the committee.[3]\n\nPolitical positions\n\nSimpson is a conservative member of the Republican Party. He works activity on all legislation, some of the most prominent pieces he has advocated for are the following:\n\nGun Control\n\nSimpson was one of the Members of Congress to sign the D.C. v. Heller amicus brief which supported a recognition of the Second Amendment as an individual right[5]). As of Recent, he voted yes and helped to pass the \"National Right-to-Carry Reciprocity Act of 2011\". [6] Under this new law, which passed through the House Of Representatives on November 16, 2011, people are allowed, with a valid license to carry a concealed weapon in other states, as long as those states allow concealed weapons and don't have specific rules about concealed weapons carried by nonresidents. [7]He has been a life time advocate for gun control, for his track record will help show it. In 1999, Mike Simpson helped veto an amendment on a bill that would require the background checks to 72 hours, then adopted an amendment that reduces the time allotted for background checks to 24 hours on the same bill.[8]\n\nBusiness\n\nSimpson also supports an agenda of low taxes and pro-business policies.[9] However, he is known to be pragmatic on many issues. For example, he was one of a handful of Republicans to vote in favor of the reauthorization of the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) in the 110th Congress.[10] Simpson has also been a supporter of the National Endowment of the Arts and the National Endowment of the Humanities, voting each year against Republican amendments to strip them of funding. Furthermore, he has been vocal in his opposition to many House Republicans' position on \"earmarks\", or congressionally directed spending. While this position has put him at odds with certain factions within the Republican Party,[11] Simpson maintains that it is unwise for the Legislative Branch to relinquish its constitutional control of the budget to the President and the federal bureaucracy.[12]\n\nEnvironment\n\nSimpson's hallmark legislation in the House of Representatives has been the Central Idaho Economic Development and Recreation Act (CIEDRA), which has created a bill would create 312,000 acres of substandard wilderness, it also designate over 500,000 acres of immediately adjacent land in which motorized access would be given special priority over other uses. [13] The financing of the bill was about 13 million in 2007, less than one dollar per person to make several changes to the status of some of the federal land in the state of Idaho. It was to then be followed up by 18 million in the 2008-2011 period. This bill has been see as a wilderness bill without true wilderness values, the bill's focus was to promote the economic development and recreational use of National Forest land and other public lands in central Idaho. [14] On Feb 7, 2007 the bill was moved to a subcommittee where it has been since, so it was not put into law.\n\nJudgeship Reorganization\n\nHe also has been crucial with the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals Judgeship and Reorganization Act.[15] Mike Simpson's goal is to amend title 28, and create the appointment of additional Federal Circuit Judges, to divide the Ninth Judicial Circuit into two smaller judicial circuits.[16] The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals Judgeship and Reorganization Act was introduced to House Judiciary Committee, and more specifically to the subcommittee on Courts and Competition Policy. Since Jan 24, 2011, the bill has been in the subcommittee, where it will be refined before being presented by to the Judiciary Committee, then later the the actual House of Representatives.\n\nHeath\n\nFollowing the death of Congressman Charlie Norwood (R-GA) in February, 2007, Simpson has become a leading advocate of the American Dental Association (\"ADA\") in Congress, in part because his profession is dentistry. The advocacy inspired Simpson to introduce legislation regarding methamphetamine, specifically how the drug affects tooth decay or \"methmouth\". The bill is formally called H.R. 1671: Meth Mouth Prevention and Community Recovery Act, with the purpose to understand and address the oral health problems associated with methamphetamine. The bill's goals are to expand and intensify the Department of Health and Human Services, make grants available to educate 12 to 17 year-olds about methmouth, and to promote a series of education activities for all dentists to learn about substance use disorders and their relationship to oral health and the provision of dental care.[17]As of March 24, 2009, the bill was put from the House Committee on Energy and Commerce to the Subcommittee on Health where it will be analyzed and brought back the the Committee. [18]\n\nEnergy\n\nSimpson is also known as an outspoken proponent of nuclear power, extolling its virtues as an environmentally friendly source of energy with minimal carbon output. Simpson's support for this form of energy plays a significant role in his membership of the United States House Appropriations Subcommittee on Energy and Water Development, which oversees the Idaho National Laboratory, a main site for nuclear and alternative energy research in the United States.\n\nOther\n\nSimpson is a strong supporter of the domestic sugar beet producers,[19] and the Idaho potato growers.[20] In 2010, Simpson took up the cause, alongside his former Democratic colleague, Walt Minnick, the lead sponsor of the bill, to secure a third federal judge for Idaho.[21] Simpson was quoted as saying, \"The caseload of the Idaho District Court has increased significantly in recent decades resulting in Idaho’s district judges carrying a disproportionate share of cases in relation to their colleagues in other states.\"[21]\n\nSimpson has become increasing opposed to President Obama and the Congressional Democrats' policy agenda. Simpson has recently announced his commitment to repealing the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, questioning its constitutionality and effectiveness.[22]\n\nPublic Recognition\n\nEsquire magazine listed Simpson as one of the 10 Best Members of Congress in October 2008.[23] The magazine said of Simpson, \"More than any other representative, Simpson lives by the philosophy that democratic representation is a matter of finding not advantageous positions but common ground...\"[23] The magazine's portrayal of Simpson echoes one of his personal philosophies, which is embodied in a quote by Henry Clay: \"Politics is not about ideological purity or moral self-righteousness. It is about governing, and if a politician cannot compromise he cannot govern effectively.\" This quote is framed and hangs in Simpson's Washington D.C. office.[24]\n\nSimpson has been credited as having a key role in the election of John Boehner (R-OH) to the position of House Majority Leader in the 109th United States Congress.[25]\n\nWhile the Republican Party held the majority in the U.S. House of Representatives, Simpson often served as the Speaker Pro Tempore of the House, particularly during debates concerning controversial legislation, due to his command of House procedure. Simpson is known to have broken several sounding boards with the gavel while calling the House to order. This inspired Simpson to have a number of sounding boards produced in Idaho, which he presented to then Speaker of the House Dennis Hastert (R-IL) as a joke.\n\nPolitical campaigns\n\nSimpson entered the 1998 campaign for the U.S. House seat vacated by Mike Crapo, who was running for United States Senate. He defeated former Democratic Congressman Richard H. Stallings in the general election. Simpson did not face serious opposition in 2002 and 2004. In 2006 Simpson defeated former Democratic state representative Jim D. Hansen, son of former Republican Congressman Orval H. Hansen, to win reelection.\n\n2008\n\nSimpson was reelected to a sixth term in 2008, defeating Democrat Debbie Holmes.[26] The final result was 204,465 for Simpson and 83,340 for Holmes, giving Simpson 71% of the vote.[27] Esquire magazine endorsed Simpson for Idaho's Second Congressional District in the 2008 elections, but endorsed Democrat Walt Minnick for Idaho's First Congressional District.[28]\n\nDuring the 2008 Presidential primaries, Simpson was an early supporter of former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney and a member of his Congressional Whip Team.[29][30]\n\n2010\n\nSee also: United States House of Representatives elections in Idaho, 2010#District 2\n\nSimpson was challenged by Democratic nominee Mike Crawford and Independent candidate Brian Schad.[31][32]\n\nIn the Republican primary, Simpson defeated Chick Heileson of Iona and Russ Mathews of Idaho Falls.[33] Each touted himself as a more conservative alternative. Simpson won re-election.\n\nLarry Craig Scandal\n\nDuring the 2007 scandal involving Senator Larry Craig (R-ID), Simpson was openly considered for an appointment to the U.S. Senate in the event that Senator Craig resigned. Simpson however, asked Governor C.L. \"Butch Otter\" to remove his name from consideration, claiming that the Idaho Congressional Delegation would be in a better position if he were to remain in the House and retain his seniority on the House Appropriations Committee.\n\nSimpson rankled Senate leadership during the Craig scandal by criticizing them for their treatment of the Senator. Simpson is quoted as saying, \"If that’s how they treat their own, that tells me they’re more interested in party than individuals, and the party is made up of individuals. How you treat them says a lot about your party.\"[34] Simpson is not known to have condoned the alleged misconduct of Craig, but rather demanded that he be treated fairly. For example, he is quoted as saying, \"They have people over there [in the Senate Republican Conference] in far worse trouble that they haven’t said a thing about.\"[34]\n\nSee also\n\nIdaho's 2nd congressional district\n\nReferences\n\nU.S. Representative Mike Simpson official U.S. House site\n\nBiography at WhoRunsGov.com at The Washington Post\n\nBiography at the Biographical Directory of the United States Congress\n\nVoting record maintained by The Washington Post\n\nBiography, voting record, and interest group ratings at Project Vote Smart\n\nCongressional profile at GovTrack\n\nCongressional profile at OpenCongress\n\nIssue positions and quotes at On The Issues\n\nFinancial information at OpenSecrets.org\n\nStaff salaries, trips and personal finance at LegiStorm.com\n\nCampaign finance reports and data at the Federal Election Commission\n\nCampaign contributions at the National Institute for Money in State Politics\n\nAppearances on C-SPAN programs\n\nProfile at SourceWatch\n\nUnited States House of Representatives Preceded by\n\nMike Crapo Member of the U.S. House of Representatives\n\nfrom Idaho's 2nd congressional district\n\n1999–Present Succeeded by\n\nIncumbent United States order of precedence Preceded by\n\nJan Schakowsky\n\nD-Illinois United States Representatives by seniority\n\n158th Succeeded by\n\nLee Terry\n\nR-Nebraska"
