In addition to his responsibilities on the Appropriations Committee, Congressman Simpson also serves on the House Budget Committee.\n\nSimpson is one of the House’s leading advocates for a new energy policy and a renewed commitment to research and development of improved nuclear energy technologies. Mike has also gained national attention for his bill to split the massive, overburdened 9th Circuit Court of Appeals as well as his bill, the Central Idaho Economic Development and Recreation Act which addresses the concerns of economic growth and stability for rural Idaho and resolves long time wilderness debate over the Boulder-White Clouds.\n\nHis political career began in 1980, when he was elected to the Blackfoot City Council. In 1984, he was elected to the Idaho Legislature where he served until 1998, the last six years serving as Speaker.\n\nSimpson was born in Burley, Idaho and raised in Blackfoot. He graduated from Utah State University and Washington University School of Dental Medicine in St. Louis, Missouri. After graduation, he joined his father and uncle at the Simpson Family Dental Practice in Blackfoot.\n\nMike is an avid golfer and enjoys painting. He has been married to his wife Kathy for 41 years."
