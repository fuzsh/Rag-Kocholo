        "text": "“Mike Simpson has proven over and over that he is the conservative leader we need fighting for Idaho families and Idaho values in Congress. He is a tried and true principled leader who has delivered on conservative results in Idaho and the country on important issues like balancing the budget and lowering taxes on hard-working Americans. It is an honor to co-chair his campaign.”\n\n“As I have worked closely with Mike Simpson over the years, I have seen his integrity, his tireless work ethic, and his proven track record of delivering results on the issues that matter most to our state and our Idaho way of life. I look forward to co-chairing Mike’s re-election campaign, because we need Mike Simpson fighting for Idaho and our conservative values in Congress. I urge voters to join me in standing with Mike.”\n\n“It’s no secret that education policy is at the forefront of some of the most contentious debates about the future of our nation. In recent years, the Biden administration has been relentless in their efforts to pursue federal outcomes that don’t meet the expectations and priorities of Idahoans with greater federal intrusions into our local schools. With his background in state and local government, I know Mike understands the importance of keeping the federal government in check and fights to keep Idaho’s schools in the hands of locally elected leaders and parents. I am proud to support Mike’s re-election campaign and encourage my fellow Idahoans to join me.”\n\n“Mike is a man of integrity and has proven to be the conservative leader we need in Congress representing Idaho. Mike understands agriculture and has always fought for our farmers, ranchers and producers, especially when it comes to the overreaching EPA. He protects our gun rights, votes to lower taxes, supports a balanced budget amendment, and continues to fight the liberal policies of Biden and the far-left. We need Mike in Congress to continue to fight for Idaho families. I’m proud to endorse Congressman Mike Simpson and chair his re-election campaign.”\n\n“Mike Simpson’s integrity, intellect, and common-sense conservative voice is exactly what’s needed in Washington. Mike is an incredible partner to the House Republican Leadership team as we fight to take back the House in 2022, and he’s raised millions of dollars for House Republicans over his career ensuring that conservatives are elected to Congress. I’m proud to support Mike because of his strong leadership in Washington. He can always be counted on to uphold the Constitution and to fight for our conservative values. He’s a Congressman Idaho can be proud of.”\n\n“National Right to Life is pleased to endorse you for re-election to the U.S. House. We commend you for your 100% pro-life voting record in the 117th Congress. When they go to the polls, voters who are concerned about the right to life and the protection of the vulnerable should take note that you voted for pro-life policies to safeguard the lives of unborn babies and their mothers. You oppose using tax dollars to pay for abortions, and you voted to preserve the longstanding Hyde Amendment, which bars federal tax dollars from being used for abortions in many federal programs. The Hyde Amendment has saved an estimated 2.5 million lives since its first passage in 1976. You voted against the so-called Women’s Health Protection Act, which really should be called “Abortion Without Limits Until Birth Act” because it would enshrine abortion in federal law and policies, and it would tear down pro-life protections on the state level including parental involvement and informed consent laws. This endorsement reflects your strong pro-life record and your commitment to building a culture of life in Washington and throughout our nation. We look forward to continuing to work with you to protect vulnerable members of the human family – unborn children and their mothers, the elderly, the medically dependent, and persons with disabilities – who are threatened by abortion or euthanasia.”\n\n“The U.S. Chamber and our members are committed to supporting candidates for public office who champion job creators and the employees, families, and communities they serve. We know that strong leaders in Washington are critical to addressing economic challenges, accelerating our recovery, and promoting opportunity. Rep. Mike Simpson has demonstrated a commitment to supporting free enterprise and the American business community through pro-growth solutions, and he has earned the political support of the business community. The U.S. Chamber is proud to endorse Rep. Simpson, and we look forward to partnering with him in the next Congress.”"
