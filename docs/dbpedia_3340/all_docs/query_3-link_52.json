        "text": "Guest Opinion\n\nAn “R” After Your Name Means Nothing\n\nIdaho Congressman Mike Simpson, RINO, has been in Congress for 24 years, and that “magic R” after his name has kept him in office, along with campaign contributions from corporate interests. Prior to this, he spent 14 years in the Idaho House of Representatives. So for nearly 40 years, he has been living at the public trough learning how to trick the voters into believing that he actually has conservative principles, and that he listens to his constituents. The mask has been dropping off the professionally Republican class over the fight for conservative leadership in the House of Representatives. Many of the members of the House view themselves as something more than representatives of their constituents.\n\nMike Simpson’s office has been bombarded by the people of Idaho asking him to vote for Jim Jordan as Speaker of the House, and to take on the important issues of spending, debt, world conflicts, and most importantly, the border crisis. In public response to the requests of the voters, Idaho’s Second Congressional District Representative Mike Simpson reminds voters that their opinion means nothing.\n\nEven Steve Scalise has voted for Jim Jordan, as has Kevin McCarthy. Mike Simpson was one of over 21 congressmen not voting for Jordan, and proud of the fact that he “will not” listen to his voters. With a cocky flair, he posted to his “X” account that “intimidation and threatening tactics do not – and will not – work.” Perhaps the bankrupting of our nation with spending might work? Twelve million illegals coming across our border with no vetting might work? Thousands of deaths from fentanyl brought across the border might wake up Mike Simpson? What events would wake this representative from Idaho up to become a patriot? Who is paying for Mike Simpson? Because, apparently, he doesn’t think the voters matter much.\n\nThis is not the only issue where Simpson has ignored common sense, and the Republican platform. He was appointed to the House Energy and Water Committee which gave him a voice for one of his favorite issues: “saving” the salmon by removing the Snake River Dams. You can imagine the response to that knuckle-headed $35 billion proposal. Even Governor Little made the statement, “I remain unconvinced that breaching the dams is a silver bullet for salmon recovery. Breaching the dams would have devastating impacts on Idahoans, and vital segments of Idaho’s economy.” Of course it would. Other opponents of this idea were even more condemning. Fire up more windmills and solar farms with tax breaks, and see how that works for you.\n\nThe Idaho GOP (IDGOP) joined a growing number of frustrated Idaho voters expressing their disappointment in Simpson. The House has ground to a halt for more than two weeks following the ouster of Speaker McCarthy, and the IDGOP rebukes Simpson for engaging in “inside-the-Beltway political games rather than focusing on the pressing business that truly matters to our constituents.”\n\nWe urge our Congressman to reconsider his position and refocus his efforts on addressing the significant issues confronting our constituents — rather than waste his time engaging in protest votes and parliamentary delay tactics. The people of Idaho expect Mike Simpson to represent their concerns and prioritize their needs above political games and partisan divisions. The true measure of his success will be in his steadfast defense of the Constitution, and the tangible benefits he delivers to the hardworking families of Idaho. We will be watching.\n\nIdaho GOP Press Release, October 17, 2023\n\nThe people of Idaho need to be asking, “How did we end up with this entrenched member of the deep state? Why hasn’t someone defeated him in the primaries in the past?” Don’t let that fake “R” after his name deceive you in the upcoming May primary."
