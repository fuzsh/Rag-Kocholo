        "text": "Save Idaho Salmon.\n\n“For the past five decades the Shoshone-Bannock Tribes have been working to restore the Snake River and our salmon runs. With the dams in place we have experienced impacts to our culture, spirituality, and our way of life; we need to change the system in order for salmon and our people (Newe) to survive. Removing the Lower Four Snake River dams will help restore our fisheries, protect our culture and create a better future for our Tribal membership.”\n\nClaudeo Broncho, Fish and Wildlife Policy Representative & Tribal Elder\n\nTake Action.\n\nOn February 6, 2021, Idaho Congressman Mike Simpson announced his Columbia-Snake River Initiative that includes restoring the lower Snake River. Congressman Simpson is the first Northwest member of Congress to propose a comprehensive solution which restores the lower Snake River and provides an array of benefits to all affected people and communities. It’s time to thank Mike Simpson and tell Idaho’s other leaders to join him.\n\nNorthwest in Transition\n\nTake Action: #SaveIdahoSalmon.\n\nVisit a new website from a group of Idahoans who want Idaho salmon and steelhead back in central Idaho’s streams and rivers in sustainable and harvestable numbers. It will show you how to take action and share the message needed to support Mike Simpson's bill and the future of salmon in Idaho. We can't wait to see your videos, just be sure to use the hashtag #saveidahosalmon in your posts.\n\nVisit Website\n\nExplore: Lower Snake River Restoration Project.\n\nThe current system is broken and no longer works for salmon and our region. Over four decades and $15 billion has been spent on salmon recovery efforts, and salmon and steelhead continue to decline. Riverside communities that are built on Idaho’s recreation economy are suffering. Over the last 30 years, the best available science has consistently demonstrated that the four Lower Snake River Dams are the greatest contributors to the loss of Idaho’s salmon.\n\nVisit Website\n\nSnake River Policy.\n\nThe policy of the tribes for management of the Snake River Basin resources states:\n\n\"The Tribes will pursue, promote, and where necessary, initiate efforts to restore the Snake River system and affected unoccupied lands to a natural condition.· This includes the restoration of component resources to conditions that most closely represent the ecological features associated with a natural riverine ecosystem. In addition, the Tribes will work to ensure the protection, preservation, and where appropriate-the enhancement of Rights reserved by the Tribes under the Fort Bridger Treaty of 1868 and any inherent aboriginal rights.\"\n\nThe Snake River Policy is utilized to identify additional land management impacts within the Snake River Basin and will similarly identify alternative management strategies and apply mitigation measures consistent with this policy.\n\nMaking Positive Conservation Work on the Waters\n\n“I think when you include native communities who have managed these lands, since time immemorial, you're going to come across systems that have been proven to be successful. There was a time where we were living with the salmon as equals and even more so where we considered them to be more important than human beings. I think just having that space and even making some elbow space for native communities to speak and let you know what is important to them, is really a good way to start moving toward meaningful change.”\n\n- Jessica Matsaw, @river.newe\n\nOf People and Salmon: Linking Culture and Ecology\n\nThis film is about salmon, indigenous peoples, and the many connections between land and water that serve to promote healthy ecological and cultural identities in salmon country. The story highlights Chinook salmon in Central Idaho, USA spawning and rearing habitat above 8 federal hydroelectric dams on the Columbia and Snake rivers (1,300 kilometers from the Pacific Ocean), sockeye salmon and adfluvial rainbow trout from British Columbia, CAN, as well as a cast of characters that depend upon healthy anadromous fish populations and associated habitat for their well-being.\n\nFish & Wildlife, Shoshone-Bannock Tribes\n\nWorking to bring back the Sockeye Salmon\n\nHow the Shoshone-Bannock Tribes are bringing Sockeye Salmon back to Pettit Lake from Idaho Conservation League on Vimeo.\n\n“This short video by the Idaho Conservation League highlights the importance of working together with many teams to accomplish a common goal - saving the Sockeye Salmon”\n\n- Eric Straubhar, Idaho Conservation League"
