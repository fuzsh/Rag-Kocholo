        "text": "BOISE, Idaho — Idaho Rep. Mike Simpson faces two challengers in Tuesday's primary. Scott Cleveland and Sean Higgins hope to unseat the long-time congressman.\n\n(verbatim of story that aired below)\n\nThe District 2 congressional race pits a longtime politician against two relative newcomers to the political scene.\n\nCongressman Mike Simpson has been in his current post since 1999.\n\nUpstarts Scott Cleveland and Sean Higgins say it’s time for a change.\n\nThe argument against Mike Simpson has rarely changed in recent years. His opponents try to make him out to be a career politician who doesn’t listen to his constituents. Still, he keeps winning in landslides. So, what’s different this year?\n\nHiggins: “I think he’s not listening that’s what I get from talking to voters.\n\nCleveland: “He votes like a Democrat most of the time and he is leading the charge and insisting on removing the Snake River dams. That’s going to be his undoing.”\n\nSean Higgins is an IT professional.\n\nScott Cleveland is a financial adviser.\n\nCleveland says this is a two-horse race.\n\nCleveland: “There’s a third guy on the ballot he’s just some young guy who lives in an apartment here.”\n\nBut Higgins says don’t count him out.\n\n“I’m a regular guy, I tend to listen. I do listen that’s the whole point of this position is Congress represents the people.”\n\nCleveland says polling shows a big decline in Mike Simpson’s approval rating and the time is right for a change.\n\nSimpson says he keeps getting reelected because he gets the job done.\n\n“As a senior appropriator being able to make sure that Some of the tax dollars that are your tax dollars that are being spent and would be spent in blue states like New York or California actually come back to improve the lives in Idaho to do some things that are very important in Idaho.”\n\nAmong the big issues for all three candidates include securing the border, improving the economy, and cutting spending.\n\nDon’t forget, Idaho News 6 will have comprehensive coverage of the primary election night, online and on air. I’m senior reporter Roland Beres, Idaho News 6."
