        "text": "Update:\n\nMike Simpson has requested that the Speaker Pro Tempore immediately bring the House back for a third vote, sharing the letter on X. Why Simpson appears so eager to get in another round of voting remains unclear at this point, given he has voted against the majority twice. The second round of voting for Jim Jordan went worse than the first, gaining only 199 votes of the 217 required.\n\nPublic sentiment on Simpson's X page seems to underscore growing frustration with many people calling for him to vote Jordan and others calling for Simpson to be voted out. The Idaho GOP sent out a scathing statement yesterday after the first failed vote, rebuking Simpson for not falling in line. The IDGOP statement started by stating their disappointment in the Congressman, but ended by saying \"We will be watching.\"\n\nWhether the Speaker Pro Tem. will call the House back in for another vote today, and what Simpson will do when they are called back in remains in question. We will continue to update this story as we learn more.\n\nOriginal Post:\n\nRep. Mike Simpson seemingly undaunted by a public rebuke from the Idaho GOP over his holdout vote for Steve Scalise in the election for Speaker of the House, voted again for Scalise in the subsequent vote Wednesday morning.\n\nJim Jordan of Ohio failed to reach the 217 votes required on Tuesday to secure the speakership. 20 Republican holdouts voted for Steve Scalise who they say was robbed of his opportunity to have a vote, among other people.\n\nAfter the first vote failed on Tuesday, the Idaho GOP released a statement after they say they were inundated with calls from angry constituents over Simpson failing to get in line behind Jordan and holding up the pressing House business.\n\nNot mincing words, the IDGOP says \"Representative Simpson has served in Congress for decades. Perhaps all this time away from Idaho has caused him to lose sight of the real work that Americans need on the important issues that impact them and their families.\"\n\nSeemingly undaunted by the mounting public pressure, Mike Simpson again cast his vote for Scalise. Scalise himself voted for Jordan."
