        "text": "Republican Congressman Mike Simpson submitted his Declaration of Candidacy to the Idaho Secretary of State, officially announcing his intent to run for re-election in hopes to clinch his fourteenth term representing Idaho's Second Congressional district.\n\nHere is part of his announcement:\n\nThroughout my time in Congress, I have consistently fought for Idahoans’ priorities, and I remain laser-focused on continuing that work.\n\n“In recent years, much of my work in Congress has concentrated on fighting the disastrous impacts of the Biden administration’s misguided policies on the lives of Idahoans. From their continued push for the Lava Ridge Wind project, to their efforts to mandate electric vehicles, to their endless tax hikes and inflationary spending, to their refusal to enforce our laws on the U.S./Mexico border, it is clear that this administration is hopelessly out of touch with rural communities and our Idaho way of life. There is still so much to be done in Washington, and I hope to once again earn the support of Idaho’s Second Congressional District voters.”"
