Idaho Congressman Mike SimpsonChairman of the House Interior and Environment Appropriations Subcommitteevoted in favor of this legislation. This bill fully funds veterans health care programs and benefits, supports military families, and strengthens Americas defense.\n\nOur nation made a promise to care for and support those who have courageously defended our freedoms, said Rep. Simpson. This legislation upholds that commitment by fully funding veterans health care programs, benefits, and all other veterans related programs. Since coming to Congress, supporting our veterans and advocating for the brave men and women in uniform has been one of my top priorities. I am proud to continue these efforts by supporting this bill and am pleased this measure has passed the House.\n\nHighlights of the bill include:\n\nFully funding veterans health care programs.\n\nFully funding veterans benefits and VA programs.\n\nProtecting the 2nd Amendment rights of veterans, preventing VA from sending information to the FBI about veterans without a judges consent.\n\nIncludes $40 million for construction of a Child Development Center at Mountain Home Air Force Base.\n\nThe FY25 Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies bill keeps Americas promise to its veterans by fully funding veterans health care programs, benefits, and other critical VA programs. The measure was approved with a vote of 209 to 197.\n\nThis funding package will advance to the Senate for further consideration."
