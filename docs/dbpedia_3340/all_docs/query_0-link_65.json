        "text": "Throughout 2024, the Idaho National Laboratory (INL) will celebrate its 75th anniversary. Established in 1949 by the United States Atomic Energy Commission as the National Reactor Testing Station, researchers at the Idaho site have conducted groundbreaking science and technologies that have powered American prosperity while ensuring national security and environmental stewardship. INL, and the many people who have worked at the laboratory, have made the world a better place.\n\nAnd that’s truly what matters. When we talk about 75 years of achievement, we are not celebrating longevity. We are bringing attention to technological advancements that have improved the lives of people in America and worldwide.\n\nHere are just a few of INL’s signature achievements.\n\nThe United States nuclear Navy, which has been a force for good in the world for more than half a century, began with work conducted at INL and continued with the training of thousands of Navy officers at the desert Site. INL’s work with the Navy has advanced the nuclear reactors powering our submarines to the point where the reactors run for the life of the ship and no longer require frequent and expensive refuelings.\n\nThe nuclear energy industry, born out of experiments performed at 52 reactors at INL, today produces nearly 20 percent of America’s electricity and approximately half of our emissions-free electricity, as much as all other sources combined. INL works every day to extend the lives of America’s high-performing nuclear reactor fleet while helping develop the next generation of advanced reactors needed to power our nation for decades to come.\n\nIn recent decades, INL has led research and development efforts to protect our nation’s most critical assets from cyber and physical threats, and cybersecurity remains a rapidly growing area of work at the laboratory.\n\nIt’s been an incredible 75 years at the Idaho site, the product of partnerships that are only possible when Americans of all backgrounds and beliefs come together in a common cause to achieve important outcomes on behalf of our nation.\n\nThink about all that goes into establishing and operating a national laboratory that takes on unique national security and clean energy challenges — the levels of cooperation needed from Congress, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), the site contractor, and representatives from local, state, and regional government, industry, and academia.\n\nThe work conducted at INL and the other 16 national laboratories exemplifies the incredible things America can achieve. This is our nation at its best. It’s the reason our national labs are considered America’s crown jewels and the envy of nations around the world.\n\nThe relationship between INL and the state’s congressional delegation has been truly remarkable. This cooperative effort has built INL into a $2 billion annual enterprise with more than 6,000 full-time staff members.\n\nThis was evident in the early 2000s when, at a critical point in the lab’s history, Idaho’s congressional delegation worked with Gov. Dirk Kempthorne to split cleanup and research missions into separate management contracts, convinced our congressional colleagues to designate INL the nation’s nuclear energy research and development laboratory, and put INL on the path to becoming the premier research and engineering institution it is today.\n\nThat partnership continues to bear fruit today. Idaho’s delegation — with key committee assignments including on the House Energy, Water Development, and Related Agencies Appropriations Subcommittee — has worked with Gov. Brad Little, the state legislature, local government officials, DOE, and many others to usher in a new era of scientific discovery and technological advancements at INL. Consistent support in federal appropriations bills has enabled INL to build the infrastructure required to be the center for testing and demonstrating advanced nuclear reactors, including the pending operation of the first new nuclear reactors on the INL site in half a century.\n\nThat leads us to this final point: While we are proud of all that has been achieved in the last 75 years and grateful to the many people who have worked at INL and made this possible, both of us have no hesitation in saying that the best is yet to come.\n\nThe clean energy and national security research taking place on INL’s desert Site and the growing Idaho Falls campus shows what is possible when we come together and work to resolve our most pressing issues.\n\nIn a world where new challenges arise every day and old ones constantly evolve, we are proud to be part of the effort to find resolutions in science and technological advancement and make the world safer, cleaner, and more prosperous for future generations."
