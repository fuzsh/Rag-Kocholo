Ammon Road\n\nAmmon, ID\n\nProject Sponsor:\n\nCity of Ammon\n\nRequest Amount:\n\n$5,830,400\n\nDescription:\n\nThe project is a valuable use of taxpayer funds because 1st Street is a principal arterial that is vital to the economic development and quality of life for the region. The section of 1st Street that is proposed for reconstruction is in failing condition and unsafe. The current volume-to-capacity ratio is at 1.41, which means that it already is operating above its capacity. Existing farmlands along 1st Street and locations further east will continue to grow and 1st Street will see a steady growth rate for the next few years, making the need for this project even more pressing. The funding will be used to reconstruct 1st Street from Hitt (25th) to Ammon (35th). It will be widened to five lanes, with two lanes in each direction and a center two-way turn lane. A curb, gutter, and sidewalk will be added along the entire section. Sand Creek bridge will be widened to five lanes and will include sidewalks.\n\nMember Certification Form\n\nSupport Letters\n\nProject Name:\n\nCenter Street Railroad Bridge Underpass\n\nRecipient Address:\n\n911 N. 7th Avenue\n\nPocatello, ID 83201\n\nProject Sponsor:\n\nCity of Pocatello\n\nRequest Amount:\n\n$5,700,000\n\nDescription:\n\nThe funding is designated to repair the abutments, replace the fascia and portals to the sidewalks, and replace the retaining walls and sidewalks leading to the pedestrian tunnels. The existing roadway and pedestrian lighting will be upgraded, and the existing stormwater system will be modified or replaced to handle storm events and a pedestrian bridge more adequately across Center Street will be constructed. The project is an appropriate use of taxpayer dollars. The Center Street underpass is an essential element of Pocatello's transportation system and one of three principle arterial streets that cross the railroad connecting the downtown area to the rest of Pocatello. A repaired underpass will ensure the safety of the city's 10,000 drivers and pedestrians who use it every day. This project will also enhance business development and community redevelopment in Historic Downtown Pocatello.\n\nMember Certification Form\n\nSupport Letters\n\n***\n\nProject Name:\n\nCuster County Court Annex Building\n\nRecipient Address:\n\n801 E.

The City of Roberts' sewer collection system is made up of 2.7 miles of asbestos concrete pipe and was installed in 1969, however, some of the sewer lines are failing causing raw sewage to back up into residents' homes causing a critical public health concern. The city has developed a plan to make upgrades to their system and this funding will be used in construction of the improvements. The improvements to the city's sewer collection system will help ensure that sewage is not leaking into the ground water and will prevent the backups that are occurring in citizens' homes.\n\nMember Certification Form\n\nSupport Letters\n\n***\n\nProject Name:\n\nFamily Health Services Helipad and Ambulance Bay\n\nRecipient Location:\n\nNear South Beverly Street and State Highway 24 in Shoshone, Idaho 83352\n\nProject Recipient:\n\nFamily Health Services Corporation: 794 Eastland Drive, Twin Falls, Idaho 83301\n\nRequest Amount:\n\n$1,547,000\n\nDescription:\n\nThe funding will be used for an emergency services infrastructure project that includes a helipad and a 4-unit ambulance bay attached to the new Family Health Services (FHS) Community Health Center being constructed in rural Shoshone, Idaho – home to over 5,300 residents. This comprehensive emergency services infrastructure project will provide access to crucial emergency medical transport into and out of the rural community to generate favorable health outcomes.\n\nFHS is constructing a new Community Health Center in Shoshone, Idaho on land leased from Lincoln County to meet primary health care needs in a very rural part of Idaho serving as a conduit to the popular Sun Valley area. Emergencies occur often, ranging from vehicle accidents to agricultural-related injuries. The rural location limits quick response/transport in medical emergencies – with the nearest hospitals/ERs respectively 20 and 32 minutes away. The request for $1,547,000 will fund the construction of a helipad and a 4-unit ambulance bay attached to the new clinic that will be operated by County EMS services.\n\nThe project is an appropriate use of taxpayer dollars and will create a robust health services network capable of expediting access to emergency care.

Main St. Boise, ID 83702\n\nRequest Amount:\n\n$2,400,000\n\nDescription:\n\nThe project is a valuable use of taxpayer dollars because Camp Rainbow Gold (CRG) is building Idaho's only medically designed, adaptive, and accessible camp to serve nonprofits across the state. The new camp, called Hidden Paradise, will work to serve thousands of children, adults, and veterans from across the state of Idaho and will bring back to life a once thriving and vibrant gathering place in rural Camas County. The scenic 172-acre parcel is nestled up against the mountains outside of Fairfield, ID. When Camp Rainbow Gold purchased the property in 2019, it had been sitting shuttered for nearly five years. Hidden Paradise will not only reinvigorate the Camas County economy, but it will also be available when camps are not in session to host various community events. This project will provide an essential service to children, families, and adults from across Idaho by creating an inclusive space where campers are able to participate in activities with their peers. Many of the campers Hidden Paradise will serve are children, adults, and veterans who have been marginalized or left out due to medical conditions, treatment, or disabilities and have insufficient access to outdoor recreation activities that every child (and adult) deserves. The funding will be used to install a Large Soil Absorption System, which the Idaho Department of Environmental Quality has just approved. Funds would be used for new water lines, wells, repairs and for much needed power upgrades to create a safer environment for Hidden Paradise campers.\n\nMember Certification Form\n\nSupport Letters\n\n***\n\nProject Name:\n\nIdaho Center for Agriculture, Food, and the Environment\n\nRecipient Location:\n\nKimberly, ID\n\nProject Sponsor:\n\nUniversity of Idaho – 875 Perimeter Dr MS 3010 Moscow, ID\n\nRequest Amount:\n\n$7.84 million\n\nDescription:\n\nThe funding is designated to support the collaboration between the University of Idaho and ARS Kimberly.
