        "text": "Idaho Representative Mike Simpson is one of 20 Republican holdouts that has left the Speaker seat vacant after the first round of voting.\n\nRep. Jim Jordan of Ohio is the Republican Speaker of the House nominee, facing off against Democrat Hakeem Jeffries. Jeffries also went against Kevin McCarthy in a historic 15 rounds of voting before his eventual nomination.\n\nFlorida Representative Matt Gaetz spearheaded a motion to remove McCarthy as speaker, the first time in history this has been done to a sitting Speaker of the House.\n\nJim Jordan received 200 votes, shy of the 217 needed to win the speakership. Jeffries secured 212 votes, moving closer to another first for the House, a speaker from the minority. 20 Republicans held out in the first round of voting, opting instead to vote for Steve Scalise, McCarthy, or several other Republicans.\n\nThe House is in recess until called back by the Speaker Pro Tempore. CBS2 reached out to Mike Simpson's office for comment about why he is not voting for Jordan and what he hopes to get for his vote.\n\nThis story will be updated if a response is received."
