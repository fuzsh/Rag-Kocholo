        "text": "The NBA, one of the most prestigious competitions in the world, is fundamentally driven by two teams that shaped the history of professional basketball: the Boston Celtics and Los Angeles Lakers.\n\nThey changed the course of everything, and the latter became a team that enchanted almost everyone.\n\nA groundbreaking and disruptive franchise, whose stars are something truly unique. One of them is Pau Gasol, who is part of Lakers' history by his own merits.\n\nSharing the spotlight with names like Magic Johnson, Kobe Bryant, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Wilt Chamberlain.\n\nThe prestigious 'Los Angeles Times' selected the 75 best players who have ever worn the gold and purple.\n\nTheir experts, respected voices with sources, information and a relationship with the franchise, established a ranking dominated by Magic Johnson.\n\nThe leader of the 'ShowTime Lakers', with five rings (1980, 1982, 1985 and 1988), three 'MVPs', and he was the soul of a team that played a fun version of basketball. He was almost perfect.\n\nOthers will prefer Kobe Bryant, the benchmark of the franchise in the modern era. Second on the list by three points and the one who changed the team's fortunes.\n\nHis exceptional attitude, play, dominance, points and five championships, with an average of 25 points in his 20 seasons made him special.\n\nHis personality, at the same time, made people fall in love with him.\n\nThe podium is closed by Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, the top scorer in NBA history. In 14 seasons he had five rings and averaged 22.1 points per game.\n\nHe was a giant among giants, and changed basketball with a way of living that transcended the court.\n\nHe is joined in the top-10 by Jerry West, Elgin Baylor, Shaquille O'Neal, LeBron James, George Mikan, James Worthy and Wilt Chamberlain.\n\nOf the 10, the most recent inclusion is James, with just one ring. But, undoubtedly, the player who returned the Lakers to the top of the NBA.\n\nPau Gasol, 12th place\n\nRanked 12th in the list is the player who changed the direction of basketball in Spain, Pau Gasol.\n\nHe was the one who hooked a whole generation and brought the NBA a physical but analytical game, with a virtue for passing as well as scoring.\n\nAlthough it can almost be said that they value him more as a legend in California. There they are very aware of the sporting 'beast' that wore their colors.\n\nHe won two rings, and his numbers are summarized in 17.7 points per game, 9.9 rebounds and 3.5 assists. With 52.2% shooting success and 78% in free throw shooting. Gasol was excellent.\n\nHe formed a fearsome duo with Kobe Bryant, who knocked down Dwight Howard's Orlando Magic and Kevin Garnett's Boston Celtics in two NBA Finals. Almost nothing..\n\nBill Plaschke, one of the most prestigious columnists, feels that the Spaniard has been placed too far down.\n\n\"LeBron is ranked too high. He's a 'Laker,' he won a ring in a short season in Los Angeles, but he will be remembered as a Cavaliers legend."
