Yes, I said it.\n\nOn Thursday night, four teams agreed to a deal that will send Dwight Howard to the Lakers. As of now, this is what the deal looks like:\n\nLakers: Dwight Howard\n\nPhilly: Jason Richardson and Andrew Bynum\n\nDenver: Andre Iguodala\n\nOrlando Arron Afflalo, Al Harrington, Nikola Vucevic, Moe Harkless, and one protected future first-round pick from each of the other three teams.\n\nOther names may emerge by the time the deal is finalized, but the Lakers have pulled off the unthinkable. First, it was Steve Nash. And now, they have the best center in the league. The Lakers might be the first team in NBA history to have four All-Stars in their starting line-up! Are you kidding me? Here is the projected starting line-up.\n\nPG: Steve Nash, SG: Kobe Bryant, SF: Metta World-Peace, PF: Pau Gasol, C: Dwight Howard\n\nThis is absolutely ridiculous. This is unreal. This is crazy! The Lakers have three future-HALL OF FAMERS in their starting lineup! I know I picked the Thunder as the #1 seed in the West but the Lakers are my new top seed in the Western Conference.\n\nNot to mention, the Lakers still have depth with Antawn Jamison, Steve Blake, and Jordan Hill. After watching Kobe yesterday against Australia, I think it is safe to say that he is still an elite player in the NBA. With the addition of Nash and Howard, the Lakers will be a dominant force.\n\nThis is the perfect mix for a championship. The Canadian has the ability to get Dwight and Kobe their touches while managing to keep Gasol happy. Pau will definitely have to agree to take on a smaller role but I think that will lead to a higher efficiency rate.\n\nLA now has two elite veterans in the backcourt and the 26 year old down low in the paint. The Lakers have improved in every single category over this off-season. Dwight Howard will help lead the Lakers to another championship.\n\nThe Los Angeles Lakers have instantly become favorites to win the championship.

Miami Heat– With the acquisitions of Ray Allen and Rashard Lewis, and the spectacular play by the big three in the playoffs last year, I don’t see anyone coming close to defeating the Heat. Projection: 62-20\n\n2. Boston Celtics– The Celtics lost Ray Allen, however, they also acquired Jason “The Jet” Terry, a leader and great in clutch moments. Avery Bradley seems to be a solid back up shooting guard along with Courtney Lee. The Celtics were also able to re-sign Brandon Baas and Jeff Green. Kevin Garnett re-signed and will mentor the two rookies Jared Sullinger and Fab Melo. And they still have Paul Pierce and Rajon Rondo, the best playmaker in the league. This team is incredibly deep and should go far. Projection: 56-26\n\n3. Indiana Pacers– Donnie Walsh has returned to the Pacers and I expect this team to build off of last year’s break out season. I actually believe that the Pacers will have a very similar season as last year as they did not make many moves. They re-signed 7’2” Roy Hibbert and added Point Guard, DJ Augistin. Danny Granger should lead this team to another winning season. Projection 50-32\n\n4. New York Knicks– Carmelo Anthony, Amare Stoudemire, and Tyson Chandler. Arguably, the best front court in the league. With the additions of veterans Jason Kidd, Raymond Felton, Marcus Camby, Kurt Thomas, and Ronnie Brewer, the Knicks will have a huge amount of pressure to go far this year. Knicks fans always say, “This is our year.” Well folks, its now or never. Projection 49-33\n\n5. Chicago Bulls– The only reason that I do not have this team up higher is because Derrick Rose is going to miss at least half the season and there is no way of knowing if he will return 100% healthy. Without D-Rose, the Bulls lost in the first round to the Sixers last year and barely put up a fight. Boozer and Noah are solid, but the Bulls offense runs through Rose, and without him, this team will struggle. Projection: 45- 37\n\n6. Brooklyn Nets– the Nets will make the Playoffs their first year playing in Brooklyn. With Deron Williams, Brook Lopez and Gerald Wallace signing long term contracts, this team is going to be talented for a long time. All-Star Joe Johnson has left Atlanta and has joined Deron and the Nets. With Marshon Brooks off the bench and Kris Humphries at Power Forward, this squad should be very deep and fun to watch. Projection: 44-38\n\n7. Orlando Magic- They may have a lot of controversy, and they may lose Dwight Howard before the trade deadline, but for now, you can’t count them out. Projection: 42-40\n\n8. Atlanta Hawks- Although they lost Joe Johnson and Marvin Williams, they still have Josh Smith and Al Horford. They won’t be as good as last year, but they will still make a push for the Post-Season. Projection: 41-41\n\nMatt’s Projected Eastern Conference Standings\n\n1.
