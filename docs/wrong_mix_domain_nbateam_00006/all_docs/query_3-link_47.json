        "text": "LeBron haters should stop reading now.\n\nDespite being a team sport, some NBA teams rely on a star to get them to the finals more than others. Did Giannis do it without help? Not really. Did MJ carry Pippen? Sometimes. Is LeBron amazing? Yes.\n\nThere are plenty of opinionated articles and videos debating this already. So I figured I would add my data-driven take to the mix. What do the data say about ranking the biggest Finals carry jobs in NBA history?\n\nThe data say that LeBronâs (losing) effort with the 2018 Cavaliers reigns supreme.\n\nAdvanced stat haters should stop reading.\n\nTo answer this I used the all-in-one advanced stat RAPTOR WAR (WAR) created by 538, a good measure for how many wins a player contributed vs. what a replacement level player would. But we canât just measure who had the highest WAR in isolation since both games and minutes played factor in. It needs to be relative to the rest of the team.\n\nData for this story came from 538. The analysis only included players with 150+ minutes played. There are a lot of metrics out there, and they can all be great and terrible. Quantity matters in the playoffs, so a cumulative stat was chosen."
