        "text": "One approach involves believing, or at least acting like, the trade speculation doesn’t affect him. “You can’t control that or really avoid it,” said Gasol Wednesday at the Lakers’ practice facility. “You will hear your name every now and then, here and there. After the way the season ended last year, it’s kind of expected. It also happened at the end of the season. But I’m looking forward to getting back on the floor and to play hard, play my best and I’m sure after that my name won’t be brought up.”\n\nThe Hornets have reservations about both players, sources say, related to Bynum’s injury history and Gasol’s major struggles in a second-round sweep by Dallas last spring at age 31. But as ESPN.com reported Monday, there is also rising sentiment within the organization to trade Paul before the 2011-12 season even starts because he hasn’t a signed a contract extension, prompting New Orleans to look at virtually every trade option presented.\n\nThe Los Angeles Lakers, sources said, also remain in the Paul hunt even though they also continue to be regarded as the top trade suitor for Orlando Magic center Dwight Howard. The Lakers’ intent to chase both superstars generated considerable skepticism from rival teams, given that center Andrew Bynum ranks as the Lakers’ only highly coveted young trade asset. But one source told ESPN.com late Tuesday that the Hornets have not yet ruled out accepting a trade package headlined by Pau Gasol. That would theoretically free up L.A. to build an offer for Howard around Bynum and a package for Paul around Gasol, although it remains unclear how the Lakers could make two separate offers sufficiently attractive to pull off what would rank as perhaps the most star-studded trade haul in league history."
