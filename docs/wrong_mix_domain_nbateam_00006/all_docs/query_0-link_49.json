        "text": "INDIANAPOLIS, Ind. â Orlando Magic forward Paolo Banchero is one of four NBA players who will make their All-Star Game debut on Sunday in Indianapolis, and he will compete in events all three days this weekend.\n\nWhat You Need To Know\n\nNBA All-Star Weekend is Friday, Saturday and Sunday in Indianapolis\n\nMagic forward Paolo Banchero will compete all three days\n\nOsceola Magic's Mac McClung is in the slam dunk contest and the Rising Stars tournament\n\nEvents and participants are listed below\n\nâHonestly, itâs just amazing to be an All-Star,â Banchero said.\n\nIn an interview Tuesday on TNT, Banchero called his selection as an All-Star \"a dream come true\" and a goal he has worked for his entire life.\n\nHis schedule starts Friday night with the Rising Stars competition. He will play on Team Tamika, coached by former Indiana Fever star Tamika Catchings, with Detroit Pistons center Jalen Duren, Utah Jazz guard Keyonte George, Portland Trail Blazers guard Scoot Henderson, Pistons guard Jaden Ivey, Sacramento Kings forward Keegan Murray and Memphis Grizzlies guard Vince Williams Jr. New Orleans Pelicans guard Dyson Daniels was also supposed to be on the team but had to pull out because of an injury.\n\nOn Saturday night, Banchero will compete in the Skills Challenge on Team Top Picks alongside Minnesota Timberwolves guard Anthony Edwards and San Antonio Spurs forward/center Victor Wembanyama, who also will compete on all three days. They will take on two other teams in a contest testing their relay, passing and shooting skills.\n\nBanchero joins New York Knicks guard Jalen Brunson, Philadelphia 76ers guard Tyrese Maxey and Toronto Raptors forward Scottie Barnes in making their first appearances in the game Sunday.\n\nAll-Star Weekend in Indianapolis will feature some familiar names, some new faces, a nod to nostalgia and a bit of unwinding for everyone before the stretch run of the season. Most of the 54 players who will be part of the weekendâs on-court festivities â and quite a few more are coming as well â began arriving on Thursday.\n\nThe rundown of events officially opened Thursday night with a tip-off party. All the traditional NBA on-court events are back â the Rising Stars and celebrity games on Friday; the dunk contest, 3-point shootout and skills competition on Saturday; then the All-Star Game itself on Sunday. Added to the slate for Saturday: a 3-point contest between NBA shooting king Stephen Curry and WNBA 3-point contest record-holder Sabrina Ionescu.\n\nThe NBA continues to give Historically Black Colleges and Universities a stage, and the game pits Virginia Union against Winston-Salem State on Saturday afternoon. A glass LED court is set to be part of the show on Friday and Saturday. Thereâs even a fan event called NBA Crossover, set up in a 350,000-square-foot space where ticketholders can try virtual reality headsets, test out the latest offerings from Jordan Brand, play with an airless basketball, even get a haircut while playing video games. And thereâs a brunch honoring icons of the game on Sunday, an event thatâs almost as tough a ticket to get as the game itself.\n\nAnother member of the Magic family is part of All-Star Weekend, too. Osceola Magic guard Mac McClung will defend his title in the slam-dunk competition and participate as a G League player in the Rising Stars competition. He will play on Team Detlef (Schrempf) with four members of the G League Ignite team â Izan Almansa, Matas Buzeilis and Tyler Smith â and Indiana Mad Ants forward/center Oscar Tshiebwe, Sioux Falls Skyforce guard Alondes Williams and Cleveland Cavaliers two-way player Emoni Bates, who replaced injured Ignite player Ron Holland II.\n\nFor the dunk contest, he said in a media day interview and practice that two or three dunks have not been done previously in an NBA All-Star Game and to \"watch the slow-motion replay.\"\n\nHe said his invitation to All-Star Weekend shows his persistence in trying to eventually win a spot on an NBA roster.\n\nAbove all else, itâs a weekend for the fans, who mostly come for the show. The All-Stars who will play Sunday combined to get more than 60 million votes from fans around the world. The game will be shown in more than 210 countries and territories, broadcast in 60 languages, and fans from at least 34 different nations have bought tickets to come to Indianapolis this weekend.\n\nâI try to do it for them,â said Los Angeles Lakers forward LeBron James, who will play in his 20th NBA All-Star Game on Sunday. âTheyâve been along this journey for so long. Itâs pretty cool to still be able to do it and do it at this level.â\n\nFriday night's schedule features the All-Star Celebrity Game and the Rising Stars at 9 p.m.\n\nRising Stars\n\nTeam Tamika (Catchings)\n\nPaolo Banchero, Orlando Magic\n\nJalen Duren, Detroit Pistons\n\nKeyonte George, Utah Jazz\n\nScoot Henderson, Portland Trail Blazers\n\nJaden Ivey, Detroit Pistons\n\nKeegan Murray, Sacramento Kings\n\nVince Williams Jr., Memphis Grizzlies\n\nNew Orleans Pelicans guard Dyson Daniels cannot play because of an injury.\n\nTeam Pau (Gasol)\n\nBilal Coulibaly, Washington Wizards\n\nJaime Jaquez Jr., Miami Heat\n\nBrandon Miller, Charlotte Hornets\n\nBrandin Podziemski, Golden State Warriors\n\nJabari Smith Jr., Houston Rockets\n\nCason Wallace, Oklahoma City Thunder\n\nVictor Wembanyama, San Antonio Spurs\n\nTeam Jalen Rose\n\nJordan Hawkins, New Orleans Pelicans\n\nChet Holmgren, Oklahoma City Thunder\n\nWalker Kessler, Utah Jazz\n\nDereck Lively II, Dallas Mavericks\n\nBennedict Mathurin, Indiana Pacers\n\nJeremy Sochan, San Antonio Spurs\n\nJalen Williams, Oklahoma City Thunder\n\nTrail Blazers guard Shaedon Sharpe cannot play because of an injury.\n\nTeam Detlef (Schrempf)\n\nIzan Almansa, G League Ignite\n\nEmoni Bates, two-way player of Cleveland Cavaliers\n\nMatas Buzelis, G League Ignite\n\nTyler Smith, G League Ignite\n\nOscar Tshiebwe, Indiana Mad Ants\n\nAlonde Williams, Sioux Falls Skyforce\n\nRon Holland II of G League Ignite cannot play because of an injury.\n\nSaturday nightâs All-Star events and participants\n\nKia Skills Challenge\n\nTeam Pacers\n\nTyrese Haliburton, (all Indiana Pacers)\n\nBennedict Mathurin\n\nMiles Turner\n\nTeam Top Picks\n\nPaolo Banchero, Orlando Magic\n\nAnthony Edwards, Minnesota Timberwolves\n\nVictor Wembanyama, San Antonio Spurs\n\nTeam All-Stars\n\nScottie Barnes, Toronto Raptors\n\nTyrese Maxey, Philadelphia 76ers\n\nTrae Young, Atlanta Hawks\n\nStarry 3-Point Contest (second event)\n\nMalik Beasley, Milwaukee Bucks\n\nJalen Brunson, New York Knicks\n\nTyrese Haliburton, Indiana Pacers\n\nDamian Lillard, Milwaukee Bucks\n\nLauri Markkanen, Utah Jazz\n\nDonovan Mitchell, Cleveland Cavaliers\n\nKarl-Anthony Towns, Minnesota Timberwolves\n\nTrae Young, Atlanta Hawks\n\nThe Stephen Curry-Sabrina Ionescu 3-Point Challenge will come before this contest.\n\nAT&T Slam Dunk\n\nJaylen Brown, Boston Celtics\n\nJaime Jaquez Jr., Miami Heat\n\nMac McClung, Osceola Magic\n\nJacob Toppin, New York Knicks\n\nNBA All-Star Game, Sunday\n\nEastern Conference Roster\n\nBam Adebayo, Miami Heat\n\nGiannas Antetokounmpo, Milwaukee Bucks\n\nPaolo Banchero, Orlando Magic\n\nScottie Barnes, Toronto Raptors\n\nJaylen Brown, Boston Celtics\n\nJalen Brunson, New York Knicks\n\nTyrese Haliburton, Indiana Pacers\n\nDamian Lillard, Milwaukee Bucks\n\nTyrese Maxey, Philadelphia 76ers\n\nDonovan Mitchell, Cleveland Cavaliers\n\nJayson Tatum, Boston Celtics\n\nTrae Young, Atlanta Hawks\n\nPhiladelphia 76ers center Joel Embiid and New York Knicks forward Julius Randle were selected but cannot play because of injuries.\n\nWestern Conference Roster"
