        "text": "Pau Gasol, who had 16 points and 11 rebounds but shot 5 of 14 from the field vs. the 76ers, was nearly traded by the Lakers for Chris Paul before the season. Asked Monday night if the Lakers might make changes if this trip doesn’t go better, Gasol was stoic. “That might occur, regardless,” Gasol said. “I don’t know. It’s totally out of my power. But there’s always a sense that if something was going to happen before, something might still happen until probably we get to the (trade) deadline. We won’t know for sure. We’ve just got to try to forget about that, put that aside, and try to continue to play as well as we can without being affected by any of that.”\n\nGasol, a four-time All-Star, finished third in the voting among Western Conference forwards behind Kevin Durant (1,345,566) and Blake Griffin (876,451) with 470,353 votes. “It’s tough, but I have a lot of competition at my position,” Gasol said. “I’ve been part of it for four times and I would love to continue to be a part of it because you are amongst the best and it’s something that’s a great recognition. “We’ll see. We’ll see what happens, see if the coaches pick me. It’s the most competitive position in the West.”"
