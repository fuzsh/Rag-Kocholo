        "text": "Pau Gasol Biography\n\nPau Gasol is an NBA legend and one of Spain's greatest basketball exports. After starting his professional career in Spain with FC Barcelona, Gasol was drafted in the first round of the 2001 NBA Draft by the Atlanta Hawks, who then traded his rights to the Memphis Grizzlies later that night. Gasol would make an instant impact, winning Rookie of the Year honors while averaging 17.6 points per game and being the only Grizzly to play in all 82 games. In 2006, Gasol made his first appearance in the NBA All-Star game after leading the league in scoring. Gasol would go on to set many Grizzlies records until he was traded in 2008 to the Los Angeles Lakers. As a complement to Kobe Bryant, Gasol would go on to become one of the best centers in the league, helping the Lakers win back-to-back championships in 2009 and 2010. Injuries would slow Gasol down, but he still managed to help the Lakers reach the playoffs multiple times during his time in L.A. In 2014, Gasol left the Lakers to sign with the Chicago Bulls, citing that Chicago felt like the best place for him to be. He spent two seasons with the Bulls and three more with the San Antonio Spurs.\n\nBook Pau Gasol for your Next Event"
