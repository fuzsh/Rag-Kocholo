        "text": "By his third NBA season, Pau Gasol had established himself as a top scorer for a playoff team. Only two seasons later, the Grizzlies big man earned his first All-Star selection.\n\nBut Gasol didn't really make his mark in the league until he was traded to the Lakers in 2008. That deal allowed him to form a dynamic duo with Kobe Bryant and win multiple championships.\n\nThose rings were the high point of an incredible career that secured Gasol a spot in the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame. He will be enshrined as part of a loaded 2023 class that includes fellow champions Dirk Nowitzki, Tony Parker and Dwyane Wade.\n\nBefore Gasol officially enters the Hall of Fame, let's take a look back at his runs to the NBA Finals and how he performed in those series.\n\nMORE: Breaking down Magic Johnson's famous 25-year contract with Lakers\n\nHow many NBA Finals rings does Pau Gasol have?\n\nGasol won two championship rings in his career. He captured back-to-back titles as a member of the Lakers in 2009 and 2010.\n\nHe also appeared in the 2008 NBA Finals, but the Celtics' \"Big Three\" of Ray Allen, Kevin Garnett and Paul Pierce defeated Bryant, Gasol and the Lakers in six games.\n\nPau Gasol timeline of NBA Finals appearances, championships\n\nGasol made three straight trips to the NBA Finals from 2008-2010. He advanced to the Western Conference Finals with the Spurs in 2017, but Golden State easily swept San Antonio in that series after Kawhi Leonard suffered a season-ending ankle injury in Game 1.\n\nNBA Finals Opponent Won? 2008 Celtics No 2009 Magic Yes 2010 Celtics Yes\n\n2008 vs. Celtics\n\n14.7 points, 10.2 rebounds, 3.3 assists, 0.5 blocks, 0.5 steals (six games)\n\nThis was a rough series for Gasol and the Lakers, as they lost to the rival Celtics, who closed out the NBA Finals with a dominant 39-point victory in Game 6.\n\nHowever, this also served as a turning point for Gasol. On the \"All the Smoke\" podcast, former Boston star Paul Pierce told Matt Barnes and Stephen Jackson that Bryant \"toughened Pau Gasol up\" after Boston ran through him in 2008.\n\n\"I saw the difference in his game in that second Finals,\" Pierce said.\n\n2009 vs. Magic\n\n18.6 points, 9.2 rebounds, 2.2 assists, 1.8 blocks, 0.8 steals (five games)\n\nThe Magic stunned the top two seeds in the Eastern Conference on their way to the NBA Finals, eliminating the Celtics and Cavaliers in consecutive rounds, but they were no match for the Lakers.\n\nLos Angeles defeated Orlando in five games behind strong efforts from Bryant and Gasol. Each star carried a heavy load for the Lakers, averaging at least 42 minutes per game in the series.\n\n2010 vs. Celtics\n\n18.6 points, 11.6 rebounds, 3.7 assists, 2.6 blocks, 0.7 steals (seven games)\n\nThe Lakers got their revenge in 2010, taking down the Celtics in a seven-game slugfest. Gasol came up clutch in Game 7, totaling 19 points, 18 rebounds, four assists and two blocks.\n\n\"For me, besides the tradition and the history of the rivalry, it was more having lost against them [in 2008] and not allowing them to beat us again,\" Gasol said on \"The Old Man and The Three\" podcast. \"It's not gonna happen. It's not gonna happen on our home court.\n\n\"And that's why we fought so hard, and we never gave up on the game even though we were down. ... We just kept fighting. We gave ourselves a chance, and we put ourselves in a position to win.\""
