        "text": "The Los Angeles Lakers won the franchise's 17th NBA championship to equal the Boston Celtics for most in league history.\n\nA look at the Lakers' 16 previous NBA championship teams:\n\n1948-49 (44-16)\n\nChampionship: Minneapolis Lakers 4, Washington Capitols 2\n\nThe Team: George Mikan, Jim Pollard, Herm Schaefer, Don Carlson, Arnie Ferrin, Tony Jaros, Jack Swan, Donnie Forman, Whitney Kachan, Mike Bloom, Johnny Jorgensen, Earl Gardner, Jack Tingle, Don Smith, Ray Ellefson\n\nCoach: John Kundla\n\nThe Season: As the National Basketball League and Basketball Association of America merged to become the NBA, the Lakers had the good fortune of landing George Mikan, formerly of the disbanded Chicago American Gears. At 6-10 and 245 pounds, Mikan was dominant, averaging 28.3 points and 3.6 assists per game. The Lakers finished one game behind Rochester in the West, but easily defeated the Royals in the playoffs.\n\nWestern Division Semifinals: Defeated Chicago Stags 2-0\n\nWestern Division Finals: Defeated Rochester Royals 2-0\n\nTop playoff performances: Mikan, 30.3 ppg; Pollard 13.0 ppg, 3.9 apg; Schaefer 12.4 ppg\n\n1949-50 (51-17)\n\nChampionship: Minneapolis Lakers 4, Syracuse Nationals 2\n\nThe Team: George Mikan, Jim Pollard, Vern Mikkelsen, Arnie Ferrin, Herm Schaefer, Don Carlson, Bob Harrison, Slater Martin, Tony Jaros, Paul Walther, Gene Stump, Billy Hassett, Bud Grant, Normie Glick\n\nCoach: John Kundla\n\nThe Season: In the first official season of the NBA, the Lakers continued to be a force because of Mikan. He averaged 27.4 points per game in the regular season, one of just two players to average above 20. Vern Mikkelsen began to show his value as well, with 14.1 points per game. This team showed that the Lakers were becoming the NBA's first dynasty.\n\nCentral Division Semifinals: Defeated Chicago Stags 2-0\n\nCentral Division Finals: Defeated Fort Wayne Pistons 2-0\n\nNBA Semifinals: Defeated Anderson Packers 2-0\n\nTop playoff performances: Mikan 31.3 ppg, 3.0 apg; Mikkelsen 13.0 ppg; Pollard 12.0 ppg, 4.7 apg\n\n1951-52 (40-26)\n\nChampionship: Minneapolis Lakers 4, New York Knicks 3\n\nThe Team: George Mikan, Jim Pollard, Vern Mikkelsen, Slater Martin, Whitey Skoog, Bob Harrison, Howie Schultz, Lew Hitch, Joe Hutton, John Pilch, Pep Saul\n\nCoach: John Kundla\n\nThe Season: The NBA widened the foul lane prior this season in hopes of slowing down Mikan, but he still averaged 23.8 points per game. He was also tops in a new statistic, rebounds, with 13.5 per game. Mikkelsen and Pollard excelled there too, with 10.3 and 9.1 rebounds per game, respectively. The Knicks provided a challenge in the Finals, forcing the Lakers' first Game 7.\n\nWestern Division Semifinals: Defeated the Indianapolis Olympians 2-0\n\nWestern Division Finals: Defeated the Rochester Royals 3-1\n\nTop playoff performances: Mikan 23.6 ppg, 15.9 rpg; Pollard 16.1 ppg, 6.5 rpg; Mikkelsen 13.3 ppg, 8.5 rpg; Martin 4.3 apg\n\n1952-53 (48-22)\n\nChampionship: Minneapolis Lakers 4, New York Knicks 1\n\nThe Team: George Mikan, Vern Mikkelsen, Jim Pollard, Slater Martin, Pep Saul, Bob Harrison, Jim Holstein, Lew Hitch, Whitey Skoog, Howie Schultz\n\nCoach: John Kundla\n\nThe Season: With essentially the same lineup as its championship team the year before, the Lakers finished first in the West. Though Mikan's numbers (20.6 ppg) were lower, Mikkelsen and Pollard picked up the slack. Minneapolis was 7-0 against Fort Wayne in the regular season, but nearly slipped against the Pistons in the division finals. They beat the Knicks with an average margin of victory of just 6.5 points.\n\nWestern Division Semifinals: Defeated Indianapolis Olympians 2-0\n\nWestern Division Finals: Defeated Fort Wayne Pistons 3-2\n\nTop playoff performances: Mikan 19.8 ppg, 15.4 rpg; Pollard 14.3 ppg, 7.2 rpg, 4.1 apg; Mikkelsen 12.0 ppg, 8.7 rpg\n\n1953-54 (56-26)\n\nChampionship: Minneapolis Lakers 4, Syracuse Nationals 3\n\nThe Team: George Mikan, Jim Pollard, Vern Mikkelsen, Slater Martin, Clyde Lovellette, Whitey Skoog, Pep Saul, Dick Schnittker, Jim Holstein, Jim Fritsche, Bob Harrison\n\nCoach: John Kundla\n\nThe Season: The fifth championship season in six years for the Lakers was the last for Coach John Kundla and for Mikan. The addition of rookie Clyde Lovellette helped to ease the dependence on Mikan, who struggled with knee problems. The duo helped the team become the first NBA team to win three consecutive titles. Mikan announced his retirement after the season and became the team's general manager.\n\nWestern Division Semifinals: In a Round Robin-style playoff between the three best teams in the Western Division, the Lakers defeated the Rochester Royals and won two games against the Fort Wayne Pistons.\n\nWestern Division Finals: Defeated the Rochester Royals 2-1\n\nTop playoff performances: Mikan 19.4 ppg, 13.2 rpg; Pollard 12.3 ppg, 8.5 rpg; Lovellette 10.5 ppg, 9.7 rpg; Martin 4.6 apg\n\n1971-72 (69-13)\n\nChampionship: Los Angeles Lakers 4, New York Knicks 1\n\nThe Team: Gail Goodrich, Jerry West, Jim McMillian, Wilt Chamberlain, Happy Hairston, Elgin Baylor, Flynn Robinson, Pat Riley, Keith Erickson, John Trapp, Leroy Ellis, Jim Cleamons\n\nCoach: Bill Sharman\n\nThe Season: In the first championship season since their move to Los Angeles 11 years before, the Lakers set a record with 69 regular-season wins, which would not be broken for 24 seasons. On Nov. 5, 1971, the Lakers beat the Baltimore Bullets to begin a 33-game win streak which did not end until Jan. 9, 1972. The mark still stands as the longest winning streak in NBA history.\n\nWestern Conference Semifinals: Defeated the Chicago Bulls 4-0\n\nWestern Conference Finals: Defeated Milwaukee Bucks 4-2\n\nTop playoff performances: Goodrich, 23.8 ppg; West, 22.9 ppg, 8.9 apg; Chamberlain 14.7 ppg, 21.0 rpg; Hairston 13.5 ppg, 13.1 rpg\n\n1979-80 (60-22)\n\nChampionship: Los Angeles Lakers 4, Philadelphia 76ers 2\n\nThe Team: Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Jamaal Wilkes, Magic Johnson, Norm Nixon, Jim Chones, Spencer Haywood, Michael Cooper, Mark Landsberger, Ron Boone, Kenny Carr, Don Ford, Brad Holland, Marty Byrnes, Ollie Mack, Butch Lee\n\nCoach: Jack McKinney/Paul Westhead\n\nThe Season: \" Showtime\" began as 20-year old rookie Magic Johnson inspired this talented team to first place in the Pacific Division and the Lakers began to establish themselves as a dynasty once again. After four close games in the Finals, Abdul-Jabbar turned in a 40-point performance in Game 5 despite spraining his ankle. With Abdul-Jabbar out, Johnson stepped up in Game 6, his 42 points and 15 rebounds leading the Lakers.\n\nWestern Conference Semifinals: Defeated the Phoenix Suns 4-1\n\nWestern Conference Finals: Defeated the Seattle Supersonics 4-1\n\nTop playoff performances: Abdul-Jabbar, 31.9 ppg, 12.1 rpg; Johnson 18.3 ppg, 10.5 rpg, 9.4 apg; Wilkes 20.3 ppg, 8.0 rpg; Nixon 16.9 ppg, 7.8 apg\n\n1981-82 (57-25)\n\nChampionship: Los Angeles Lakers 4, Philadelphia 76ers 2\n\nThe Team: Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Jamaal Wilkes, Magic Johnson, Norm Nixon, Mitch Kupchak, Michael Cooper, Bob McAdoo, Mike McGee, Kurt Rambis, Mark Landsberger, Eddie Jordan, Clay Johnson, Jim Brewer, Kevin McKenna\n\nCoach: Paul Westhead/Pat Riley\n\nThe Season: The Lakers came into the season looking to avenge a surprising loss to Houston in the first round of the 1981 playoffs. With Johnson back from a knee injury and the additions of coach Pat Riley and sixth man Bob McAdoo, the Lakers swept Phoenix and San Antonio with an average margin of victory of 11 points and finished with a playoff record of 12-2.\n\nWestern Conference Semifinals: Defeated the Phoenix Suns 4-0\n\nWestern Conference Finals: Defeated the San Antonio Spurs 4-0\n\nTop playoff performances: Johnson 17.4 ppg, 11.3 rpg, 9.3 apg; Abdul-Jabbar 20.4 ppg, 8.5 rpg; Nixon 20.4 ppg, 8.1 apg; Wilkes 20.0 ppg\n\n1984-85 (62-20)\n\nChampionship: Los Angeles Lakers 4, Boston Celtics 2\n\nThe Team: Magic Johnson, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, James Worthy, Kurt Rambis, Byron Scott, Michael Cooper, Jamaal Wilkes, Ronnie Lester, Larry Spriggs, Mike McGee, Mitch Kupchak, Bob McAdoo, Chuck Nevitt, Earl Jones\n\nThe Coach: Pat Riley\n\nThe Season: Johnson's 13.3 assists per game fueled \"Showtime\" and resulted in the 22.7 and 16.1 ppg averages of Abdul-Jabbar and Worthy. A year removed from yet another loss to Boston in the Finals, the Lakers looked set to avenge. After a brutal 148-114 loss in Game 1, known as the \"Memorial Day Massacre,\" Los Angeles came back to defeat Boston in the Finals for the first time.\n\nWestern Conference Semifinals: Defeated the Portland Trail Blazers 4-1\n\nWestern Conference Finals: Defeated the Denver Nuggets 4-1\n\nTop playoff performances: Johnson, 17.5 ppg, 15.2 apg; Abdul-Jabbar, 21.9 ppg, 8.1 rpg; Worthy, 21.5 ppg, 5.1 rpg\n\n1986-87 (65-17)\n\nChampionship: Los Angeles Lakers 4, Boston Celtics 2\n\nThe Team: Magic Johnson, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, James Worthy, Kurt Rambis, Byron Scott, Wes Matthews, Michael Cooper, A.C.
