        "text": "Paolo Banchero will be leaving Salt Lake City with bragging rights among the Orlando Magic’s young forwards.\n\nBanchero and Team Pau won the Rising Stars competition Friday as part of All-Star weekend, beating Team Joakim 25-20 in the tournament’s championship matchup.\n\nPelicans guard Jose Alvarado, who won the tournament’s MVP honors, knocked down the game-winning to give Team Pau the win.\n\nBanchero finished with 4 points, 1 block and 1 steal in the championship game.\n\nBanchero and Team Pau beat Team Deron, the team Magic second-year forward Franz Wagner was on, 40-25 in the semifinals. Banchero had 9 points (4-for-6 shooting, 1 of 2 on 3s) and 5 rebounds in Friday’s first matchup, while Wagner went scoreless (0-of-3) and had 3 rebounds.\n\nAlvarado scored 13 points in the opening game.\n\nTeam Joakim beat Team Terry, 40-32, in the semifinals to advance to the championship game.\n\nThe Rising Stars format, which was altered last season, featured four seven-player teams competing in a mini-tournament of three games (two semifinal games and one championship contest) instead of a single exhibition as in previous years.\n\nThe pool of 28 players for Rising Stars consisted of 11 rookies, 10 second-year NBA players and seven G League players.\n\nFormer NBA stars Pau Gasol, Deron Williams, Joakim Noah and Jason Terry served as honorary coaches for the tournament.\n\nThe 21 NBA players were drafted onto three seven-player teams by Gasol, Noah and Williams. The G League players were the fourth team and coached by Terry.\n\nBanchero will also compete in Saturday’s Skills Challenge.\n\nThis article first appeared on OrlandoSentinel.com.
