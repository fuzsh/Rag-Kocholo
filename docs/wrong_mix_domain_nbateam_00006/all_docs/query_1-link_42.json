        "text": "Barcelona president Josep Maria Bartomeu said that he’d “love” to see Pau Gasol wearing the team’s jersey once again. Gasol has mentioned that a return to Barcelona is an attractive option for him to spend what may be the last season of his career. “I would love for Pau Gasol to play for Barça. I never rule anything out, but European basketball doesn’t have the mechanisms or resources that the NBA has,” Bartomeu said to Catalan radio RAC 1, per Marc Mundet.\n\nSarunas Jasikevicius went through various topics during his official presentation by FC Barcelona on Monday. The recently-appointed head coach of the Spanish powerhouse answered questions about Pau Gasol, his playing memories from Barcelona, and more. “Many names are popping out but everybody understands we can only comment when a move is official,” he pointed out on incoming players and went on to his former Barca teammate Gasol who turned 40 today, “I am very close to Pau. Signing him wouldn’t hurt us.”\n\nStoryline: Pau Gasol Free Agency\n\nGasol: Return to Lakers or Barcelona would be 'attractive'\n\nGasol won two NBA titles while playing for the Lakers, where he stayed from 2008-14. He started his professional career with his home team in Barcelona, where he played from 1998-2001. He also played for the Memphis Grizzlies, the Chicago Bulls, the San Antonio Spurs and the Milwaukee Bucks. “My intention is to play another season if the foot is OK, either in the NBA or in Europe,” he said. “A final season with the Lakers is attractive, finishing at Barça is attractive, but you have to see the real possibilities and see what situation would be best for the circumstances of the moment.”\n\nThis rumor is part of a storyline: 178 more rumors\n\nPau Gasol regarding a hypothetical option to play next year for Barça. “My intention, if my foot gets healed, is to play another season, whether in the NBA or Europe. If it’s in Europe, Barça is the place that makes the most sense for me”."
