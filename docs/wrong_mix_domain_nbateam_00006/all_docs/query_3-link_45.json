        "text": "LOS ANGELES — The Los Angeles Lakers have won their 16th NBA championship, dramatically rallying from a fourth-quarter deficit to beat the Boston Celtics 83-79 Thursday night in Game 7 of the NBA Finals.\n\nKobe Bryant scored 23 points despite 6-of-24 shooting while winning his fifth title with the Lakers, who repeated as NBA champions for the first time since winning three straight from 2000-02.\n\nRon Artest added 20 points for the Lakers, who shot terribly while trailing for most of the first 3½ quarters. Yet they reclaimed the lead midway through the fourth quarter and hung on with big shots from Pau Gasol and Artest.\n\nWith their fifth title in 11 seasons, the Lakers moved one championship behind Boston’s 17 banners for the overall NBA lead.\n\nPaul Pierce had 18 points and 10 rebounds for the Celtics, who just couldn’t finish the final quarter of a remarkable playoff run after a fourth-place finish in the Eastern Conference. Kevin Garnett added 17 points, but Boston flopped in two chances to clinch the series in Los Angeles after winning Game 5 back home.\n\nAfter three quarters of mostly terrible offense, the Lakers tied it at 61 on Artest’s three-point play with 7:29 left. Bryant’s free throws 90 seconds later gave the Lakers their first lead of the second half, and the Lakers went up by five points before Bryant and Sasha Vujacic hit free throws in the final seconds to keep Los Angeles ahead.\n\nThe Lakers will relish this title because they took it from the Celtics, their greatest rivals, with fourth-quarter poise and defense. The teams have met in 12 NBA Finals, but the Lakers won for just the third time.\n\nJim Litke\n\nThe Associated Press\n\nThis is the curse of being Kobe Bryant: Win or lose another championship, he will never escape Michael Jordan's shadow. Neither will anyone else.\n\nIt's worth remembering that when these playoffs began, some very smart people wondered out loud whether Bryant could climb out of Kevin Durant's.\n\nThe 31-year-old Bryant was coming off a string of nagging injuries and poor shooting performances at the end of the regular season. The 21-year-old Durant was the youngest scoring champion in league history and the game's fastest-rising star. Bryant quickly quieted that talk by putting Durant and the Thunder in his rearview mirror, then the Jazz and Suns. By the time the finals rolled around, he was once again being compared to opponents he can't ever beat.\n\nWe're not talking about the Celtics, but the notion that Bryant's body of work is somehow still incomplete, that he must keep winning titles to secure his spot among the handful of greatest players ever. Please. It's way past time to give the man his due.\n\nBryant won his first three NBA titles as Shaquille O'Neal's sidekick, or at least that's the way the story was framed. A fourth title last year with a supporting cast that included exactly one reliable sidekick, Pau Gasol, should have removed any doubts.\n\nBut Bryant could win a fifth title and still not be considered the greatest Laker ever as Magic Johnson finished his stay in LA with the same number. Bryant could win a sixth title, as many as Jordan won, and still suffer in comparison. Bryant will walk away from the game in a few years with numbers that make his argument persuasively, but he'll never gain the top spot.\n\nJordan put that out of reach by taking his Bulls to their first NBA championship in 1991 and never losing another playoff series. Of course, that assumes you don't count the beating Shaq and the Orlando Magic doled out in 1995 Eastern Conference semis, when Jordan was still getting his legs back after spending most of the season trying to play baseball.\n\nEither way, it left the perception that when push came to shove, Jordan was unbeatable. What Bryant's detractors have missed over the last decade is that he's become the next best thing; namely, the guy you have to beat.\n\nThe list of players who have done just that includes a few of the big names of Bryant's generation — Paul Pierce and Kevin Garnett, Manu Ginobili, Chauncey Billups and plenty of lesser ones. Bryant has won the lion's share of those collisions and piled up just about every other significant accomplishment along the way — MVP awards in the finals, regular season and All-Star Game; scoring titles and a string of all-NBA and all-defensive team selections.\n\nHe just didn't win them all.\n\nTo some people, falling just short of that impossible standard seems like a fitting punishment. Bryant came into the NBA as a prodigy, polite and saying all the right things. But he so wanted to be like Mike that eventually the selfishness that is in the DNA of every great player began defining his behavior away from the court even more.\n\nHe undermined coach Phil Jackson the first time they were together and nudged Shaq into exile with an eye on taking over a team so lacking in options that he could call his own number every trip up the floor. And then, when Bryant figured out he could wind up wasting his absolute prime on a team so bad that even his best wasn't good enough to put it over the top, he threatened to walk out of Los Angeles, too.\n\nAll of those things made Bryant tough to root for, and an accusation of rape a few years ago made him more guarded than ever. But he's come back stronger than ever season after season, leaving a succession of would-be next Jordans in his wake.\n\nHe'll never be as lovable as Magic, though he likely will be every bit as accomplished when he steps away. He won't be as feared as Jordan was either, but he's the closest thing most of us will ever see to either. As legacies go, it doesn't get much better than that.\n\nIN LOS ANGELES Police massed around the Staples Center before Game 7 of the NBA Finals on Thursday night, aiming to prevent a repeat of the violence that accompanied the Lakers' victory last year. But manager Jesus Rocha, who runs Joe's LA Market and Deli near LA's Staples Center, says he'll close before the game ends just in case. He remembers last year, when some fans celebrating the Lakers' defeat of the Orlando Magic in Florida set fires, stole computers from a nearby office and looted a fancy tennis shoe store next door. This year, police planned to have hundreds of officers massed around the arena. City officials warned fans to stay away from downtown unless they have tickets to the game. in boston Authorities deployed hundreds of state troopers and local police officers around Boston for crowd control before Game 7. Boston police are closing some streets and ordering bars not to take in new customers at the end of the third quarter of Thursday night's game. State police also will have more than 100 troopers from various units staged in the city to assist Boston police, including canine, mounted, tactical and helicopter units. Some Boston sports celebrations in the past decade have ended in tragedy, including three deaths since 2004.\n\nCROWD CONTROL"
