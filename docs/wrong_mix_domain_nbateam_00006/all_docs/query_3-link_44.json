        "text": "Their season appeared to be following a script right out of Hollywood, complete with plenty of twists and turns.\n\nFor more than half the season, the Boston Celtics looked anything but contenders for the NBA championship, going 27-27 in the final three-plus months to finish with the ninth-best record in the league.\n\nOnce the Celtics got to the playoffs and flicked on a switch, though, all of that was forgotten as they eliminated the Miami Heat in five games before taking out the teams with the top two regular-season records, the Cleveland Cavaliers and the Orlando Magic, in six games.\n\nThe surprising rejuvenation got the Celtics into the NBA Finals, where they opened a 3-2 lead over the Los Angeles Lakers and were just one win away from a second championship in three years.\n\nThere would be no happy ending to this Hollywood story, however, as the Celtics were unable to pen a fantastic finish to their bumpy ride that was the 2009-10 season.\n\nPlaying roughly 10 miles from Hollywood, the Celtics had their title dreams dashed on Thursday night when the Los Angeles Lakers defended their crown with a 83-79 victory in Game 7 at the Staples Center.\n\nA team that had come so far since the playoffs began 63 days ago, rising up from a postseason afterthought to being on the verge of a title, fell a mere one victory short of the franchise’s 18th championship.\n\nThe Celtics had a 13-point third-quarter lead over the Lakers and looked like they might become just the fourth team in NBA history to win Game 7 in the Finals on the road. But struggles at the offensive end and 20 offensive rebounds by the Lakers prevented the Celtics from finishing their roll through the playoffs in style.\n\nIt was a disappointing and bitter end for the Celtics, who battled through injuries and team chemistry issues all winter before putting together a marvelous run in the spring.\n\nAfter winning Game 5 at the TD Garden on Sunday night, the Celtics headed west but were unable to seal the deal, getting blown out with a miserable Game 6 performance and losing Game 7 with center Kendrick Perkins unable to play due to a knee injury.\n\nInstead of adding to the Celtics’ championship legacy, they will go down as the first team in franchise history to lose Game 7 in the NBA Finals after surviving the winner-take-all situation seven times.\n\nIt was a cruel finish for a team that brushed aside all that went wrong during the regular season and went toe-to-toe with the Lakers with the title on the line.\n\nThe Celtics had a 23-5 record after an impressive Christmas Day win in Orlando, then became an ordinary team the rest of the regular season, splitting the last 54 games.\n\nThere were injuries to Kevin Garnett and Paul Pierce, among others that slowed them down but the Celtics were not a cohesive unit, kicking away double-digit leads with regularity and failing to play defense in their trademark stingy manner.\n\nThe Celtics wound up fourth in the Eastern Conference, and nearly everyone had them getting past the Heat and then being bounced from the playoffs by the Cavaliers. End of story.\n\nSomething changed in the series with the Heat as the Celtics started coming together, and after suffering the franchise’s worst home playoff loss in Game 3 against the Cavs, the Celtics really got rolling.\n\nThey sent LeBron James into free agency after a six-game elimination and bolted to a 3-0 series lead over the Magic before winning Game 6 at home.\n\nThere were times during the Finals when the Celtics looked like they might come away with a second title in the Garnett-Pierce-Ray Allen era, bouncing back from losses in Games 1 and 3. That one final victory in LA was elusive, however, and the ride ended.\n\nWith Allen now a free agent, Pierce having an opt-out clause in his contract and Garnett now 34 and showing signs of age, who knows what the future holds for the three players who revitalized basketball in Boston the past three seasons?\n\nAllen, who turns 35 next month, looks like he can play another couple of years, but whether it’s in Boston remains to be seen. Pierce, who will be 33 next season, will probably not be leaving the only team for whicch he’s played. Garnett has two years to go on his deal and is obviously slowing down.\n\nThere is also the matter of coach Doc Rivers, who after six years on the job may be ready to head home to central Florida and watch three of his children compete in basketball and volleyball next winter.\n\nWith all of those questions hovering over the Celtics, having another championship banner bound for the Garden rafters would have made whatever transition is ahead a lot easier.\n\nThe ’09-10 Celtics would have gone down as the team that brought home one of the most surprising and satisfying championships, bouncing back from an uneven season with a memorable playoff run to the top.\n\nThe opportunity was right there in front of the Celtics for the taking on Thursday night as they had the Lakers on the ropes.\n\nThe final scene, though, took place not far from Hollywood, and the script with all the twists and turns ended in an unhappy manner."
