        "text": "Facing elimination in game five of the NBA Finals, the Orlando Magic started out fast by building an early eight point lead. The Los Angeles Lakers did not panic and slowly chipped in to the Magic lead. At the end of one quarter, the Magic led by two points at 28-26.\n\nLeading after the first quarter, things fell apart for the Magic as the Lakers pulled away in the second quarter. The Lakers were able to overtake Orlando and start to build a lead. The Magic couldn't seem to get back in to the game. Los Angeles stretched their lead out to 10 points at the half at 56-46.\n\nThe Lakers kept their foot on the gas in the third quarter. The Magic, who started off so fast, couldn't seem to find the range shooting. After shooting over 50 percent from the field in the first quarter, the Magic’s shooting percentage dropped as the game wentalong. Los Angeles extended their lead to 15 points after three quarters at 76-61.\n\nThe Magic made some mini runs in the final quarter but were not able to cut the lead enough to make the game close. All five of the Magic starters finished in double figures scoring. They were led by Dwight Howard with 11 points and 10 rebounds and Rashard Lewis adding a double-double as well with 18 points and 10 rebounds. The other Magic starters Hedo Turkoglu, Courtney Lee, Rafer Alston all added 12 points apiece.\n\nFor the Lakers, it was their night as they had five players in double figures. Derek Fisher added 13 points and Trevor Ariza put in 15 points as well. Pau Gasol had another double-double with 14 points and 15 rebounds. Lamar Odom came off the bench to add 17 points and 10 rebounds for the Lakers.\n\nIn the 99-86 win, the Lakers claimed their 15th NBA Championship putting them just two behind the Boston Celtics' 17 titles. Finals MVP Kobe Bryant finished the game with 30 points, six rebounds, five assists, four blocks, and two steals. The 4-1 series win gives Bryant his fourth championship and the first without Shaquille O'Neal whom he won three with. The Finals MVP was Bryant’s first in six trips.\n\nFor the Lakers Phil Jackson, he gets his 10th NBA title on his 12th try. With his 10th championship, Jackson is able pass Red Auerbach for the most titles after being tied at nine a piece. Jackson is the winningest coach in finals history."
