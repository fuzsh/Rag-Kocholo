Former Gov. Gary R. Herbert served as the 17th governor of Utah from 2009 to 2021. During his tenure, his focus was on economic development, education, energy, and efficiency in government. As a result, Utah is recognized as a premier business destination and a great place to live and raise families, with an unsurpassed quality of life.

Herbert was born and raised in Utah County, where he would eventually serve as a county commissioner for 14 years. He attended Brigham Young University, served six years in the Utah National Guard (from 1970–1976), and started a successful real estate brokerage and development company, Herbert and Associates Inc.

He served as the president of the Utah Association of Realtors and the president of the Utah Association of Counties. Herbert has also served as chair of both the Western Governors’ Association and National Governors Association and was the president of the Council of State Governments. Prior to becoming governor, he served as Utah’s lieutenant governor for four and a half years.

Herbert has been a strong advocate for excellence in public and higher education in Utah. He assisted in legislative efforts to help Utah Valley State College become Utah Valley University and supported policy measures to fund accessible education and to increase infrastructure at the university. He has dedicated his time and resources to benefit the students of UVU, having taught at the university for seven years and launching UVU’s Herbert Public Policy Initiative.

Herbert and his wife, Jeanette, have lived in Orem for over 50 years and are the proud parents of six children and 17 grandchildren.
