        "text": "Dr. Herbert G. \"Herb\" Koenig, 93, went to be with the Lord on March 16, 2024 at the Niagara Hospice House in Lockport. Born July 8, 1930, in Buffalo, Herb was the third of three children born to Leonard (Leo) M. Koenig and Edna (Pawlitz) Koenig. After graduating from Buffalo Teachers College, Herb earned his M.A. and Doctorate in education, and spent his 30-year teaching career inspiring the students at Royalton Hartland Middle School.\n\nHerb was preceded in death by his brother Raymond (Jean) Koenig, sister Ruth (Arthur) Pelzer, and first wife Jean (Newman) Koenig. His joyous legacy will be carried on by his second wife Virginia Laube Koenig, nieces Marcia (Brian) Ergort, Lynn (Tiff) Bates, Pam (Gary) Rost, Karen (Joe) Buranich, Sarah Fritton, nephews Bill Feldman, Matthew (Rita) Fritton, Christopher Fritton, stepchildren Jonathan (Kim) Laube, and Laura (Doug) Finney, and many great-nieces and nephews, as well as countless friends that he saw as his family.\n\nHerb's lifelong passions included his faith, education, travel, music, his Middleport community, and of course, people. Herb never met a stranger and couldn't go anywhere without someone recognizing him. He always had a welcoming word, and usually a corny joke to go with it.\n\nFrom 1953-1957, he served in the U.S. Naval Reserve as a communications officer aboard the aircraft carrier USS Hornet in the Mediterranean and Pacific. He retired from the navy at the rank of Lieutenant.\n\nHerb began teaching for Royalton Hartland in 1952, and received an Outstanding Educator of America Award in 1975. In 1979, he was selected as a Fellow by the Science Teachers Association of New York State, for which he held many offices, including chairman of the Northwestern Zone. While teaching, Herb authored several science textbooks - an achievement of which he was very proud. He retired from teaching in 1986.\n\nHe was an active member of the Middleport United Methodist Church, where he sang, and occasionally gave the Sunday message. Music was very important to him, and the Middleport Community Choir held a special place in his heart. Herb was instrumental in establishing a partnership between the choir and the Lubbecke Brass Ensemble of Germany. His work laid the foundation for multiple trips and cultural exchanges, as well as international friendships. He truly believed that music brought people together.\n\nAs a 66 year Mason, Herb was a past District Deputy Grand Master of the Niagara-Orleans Masons, and past Master of Cataract Masonic Lodge 63, Middleport.\n\nHerb had a zest for life, and the world is a better place because he was in it.\n\nCalling hours will be held Saturday, March 23, from 1:00-3:00, at the Bates, Wallace and Heath Funeral Home in Middleport, with a Masonic memorial service to follow. In lieu of flowers, contributions in Herb's name can be made to the Middleport Community Choir, Middleport United Methodist Church, or Niagara Hospice."
