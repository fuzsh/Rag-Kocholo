        "text": "Peter Charles Knudson, aged 86, passed away peacefully on June 5, 2024. He was a dedicated husband to Georgianna and loving father to Karri Knudson, Robyn Froerer (Josh Froerer), Heather Nielsen, and Christian Knudson. Devoted papa to Harrison and Isabelle Froerer; Ezri and Zain Knudson; and Lucia and Scarlett Nielsen. He was born October 26, 1937 in Brigham City, Utah. He was the youngest of four children by many years, to his parents, Percy and Verabel Call Knudson. Peter grew up in Brigham City, spending most of his time on his family farm and at the Idle Isle Cafe restaurant and candy business his family ran. He was raised with a large extended family, in a home with his cousins who were closer in age and were like siblings to him. Peter had a life of education. He received degrees from University of Utah, Utah State University, and received his DDS from the University of Pacific in San Francisco and received his Masters and Orthodontics Degrees at Loyola University Chicago. He served his residency at the Public Health Service on Staten Island, NY.\n\nDr. Knudson in his leadership role as a senator in the Utah State Legislature, advanced legislation for the creation of the School of Dentistry at the University of Utah. He also filled a key role in getting legislation passed allowing for the construction of the school, and went on to become an Adjunct Faculty member as well as receiving The Honorary Alumnus Award from the School of Dentistry. Dr. Knudson’s passion for dental education has led to many underserved patients receiving necessary dental care. Peter practiced orthodontics for over 50 years.\n\nPeter was known for being a loving man who cared for his community deeply. He had a love of service as a missionary in Denmark. He had a deep love of his faith and served many callings. That dedication then continued throughout his life as he served as a City Council Member, Mayor, State Representative, and State Senator. He saw each of these roles as an opportunity to serve his community. Making connections was what Peter did best. Peter savored those connections he made throughout his life with family, friends, and his community. Especially when these connections were shared over a bowl of ice cream. His brilliant mind and sense of humor will be greatly missed.\n\nPeter loved duck hunting with his friends in the Duck Club, Wayne Jones and Lewis Knudson, boating and skiing at Bear Lake and trips to Disneyland with his family and the Wildes, fishing trips with his buddy Howard Trotter, and many lifelong friends like the Abelson’s and Greer’s who he would love to travel and visit. He shared his passions with his family and friends. He loved Mel Brooks and Clint Eastwood films.\n\nHe served in the United States Army, and the Utah National Guard receiving the rank of full Colonel in 1996.\n\nPeter’s family would like to thank all of those who compassionately cared for him at the George E Wahlen Veterans Home. He was treated with much love and respect. We are forever grateful.\n\nPeter was known throughout his life for his love, humor, and generosity. He leaves a lasting legacy. He will be deeply missed by his family, friends, and community. He will always be in our hearts.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, please consider donating to the University of Utah School of Dentistry to support the Oral Health Assistance Program (OHAP). This will help provide dental care to the underserved in Utah.
