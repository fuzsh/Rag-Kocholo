        "text": "Herbert \"Herb\" Kendall, age 93, of Rochester MN passed away Monday, February 19, 2024 peacefully surrounded by family. Herb was born August 19, 1930 to Herbert Bartlet Kendall and Myrtle (Ayshford) Kendall in Stewartville MN. He attended Stewartville Schools until moving to their farm in Spring Valley, MN in 1944. In March of 1947 he enlisted in the Navy. He was a 1st Seaman with the Destroyer-Tin Can, John W. Weeks. In March of 1950 he returned home and married LaVonne Mlenar on July 8, 1950 in Spring Valley, MN. Following this reunion, two daughters were born, Evelyn Mae and Shari Dawn. They moved from Spring Valley, MN to Fountain, MN. They purchased a building and started Kendall's Grocery & Locker. They built a new house and that became their home for 17 years. They were later divorced. Herb was very involved in the Fountain Community being on the Volunteer Fire Department, Committees and Baseball Teams. At the age of 28 he became the youngest Mayor in the State of Minnesota for Fountain, MN. He was memorably introduced as the \"Fountain of Youth\" by the preceding Mayor. On July 1st, 1968 he married Carol Henke. To this reunion, came 3 Sons & a Daughter. Richard Dale Kendall, Gary Lynn Kendall, June Carol Kendall & Mark Ferdy Kendall. Herb and Carol later sold Kendall Grocery & Locker to Willis Camburn and started a locker business on their farm in Fountain. The business was later destroyed by a fire. Herb ran/managed the Municipal Fountain Liquor and worked for the Mayo Clinic. Herb and Carol moved to Eyota MN in 1978 and purchased the Eyota Meat Locker Plant in 1979 which they owned and operated until 1984 when it was sold. Herb then went to work for the Kahler Hotel where he drove the courtesy van, transporting guests to and from the hospital and drove the company limousine transporting guests to and from the airport in Minneapolis. He enjoyed this semi-retirement job very much. He finally retired in 1995. Herb and Carol moved to Mesa, Arizona after several years of \"snow birding\" and found this their home until 2014 when they returned to Rochester where they moved into the Madonna Meadows/Madonna Towers Retirement Community. Herb was always known for his kindness and his social connections to many, so of no surprise, following Halloween in 2018 he had some leftover Kit Kats, and he decided to hand them out to children visiting from a local school who came to perform songs for the residents. This was a big hit and brought so much joy to both he and his wife Carol and thus began the known history of the \"Kit Kat Man\". The visiting children and local residents began to call him the \"Kit Kat Man\" and looked forward to receiving a sweet treat following their performances and gatherings. Later, as a recognition of sorts, his daughter June made a sign that he attached to the front of his motor scooter advertising the \"Kit Kat Man\". A local resident, Lois Couch, was touched by his kindness and generosity and all of the smiles this brought to so many faces, so she reached out to one of her known connections, Matthew Stolle, at the Post Bulletin, our local newspaper. Soon after, Matt came to interview Herb and shared the story of the \"Kit Kat Man\". Following this article, the Hershey Company reached out to Herb as they caught wind of the story of his kindness and wanted to help provide Kit Kats as well as some \"Kit Kat Man\" gear made just for him. T-shirts, jackets, travel mugs, hats, socks etc.. He then sported his new digs as he handed out Kit Kats from this time on. Another Post Bulletin article was soon to follow. You can find these uplifting articles on Postbulletin.com. The joy that this has provided to others could never match the feeling of receiving the smiles and thank you' s & hugs from so many for so very long. The Covid-19 pandemic had a bit of an effect on this generosity and social fulfillment this provided, but as soon as things began to return to our new normal, so did the Kit Kat Man and the sweet treats. He began finding that he liked to incorporate some of the new flavors as well as it put an extra big smile on many faces. Halloween of course became a Big Event each year. He went overboard and handed out all kinds of goodies including many, many Kit Kats. Herb loved people and was known, liked & loved by many. He told his children to never forget a person's name after being introduced, which was harder said than done for some of us. He also liked to remind his daughters of a saying his father often repeated, \"Your never fully dressed without a smile\". He was a hardworking man and was always helping others out. Herb loved his families and was a good provider. He loved the outdoors, spending time hunting, fishing, baseball and with his horses. He had a special horse named \"Scout\" that he could make lay down anywhere inside or out. Herb was known for his homemade Summer Sausage & Bologna where people from all over would come to purchase at Kendall's Grocery & Locker. He said he would never give his recipe to anyone and would take it to his grave. He had a strong faith and was always repeating the Bible verse \"Goodness, Kindness & Mercy shall follow me all the days of my life and I shall dwell in the house of the Lord forever. He who believes in him, shall have life everlasting\". Herb is survived by his daughters Evelyn Jahnke, Shari (Roger) Davidson, of Spring Valley MN, June (Joseph) Kendall-Thomas of Rochester MN. Sons Richard (Cynthia) Kendall of Eyota, MN Gary (Julie) Kendall and Mark (Monica) Kendall of Rochester, MN. Grandchildren Jerime (Rochelle) Wojtkiewicz & Jesse (Vee) Wojtkiewicz of Rochester, MN. Lyndy (Wayne) Rohe of Centerville, OH, Krystal (Patrick) Campbell of Stewartville, MN. & Dallas Davidson of Spring Valley, MN. Brooke Kendall & Ashley Kendall, Jennifer (Frank) Diaz, Joshua Kuehl & Jake Kendall, Megan Thomas & Ryan Thomas, Emerson Kendall & Killian Kendall all of Rochester, Mn. Brother-in-law Arnold Benson of Preston, MN, 24 Great Grandchildren and many Nieces and Nephews. He was preceded in death by his Parents, Wife Carol, Siblings Bernice, Florence Edna, Bertha, Charles, Moneta, Barbara Jane Marcella \"Sally\", Sandra, Virginia & Elizabeth (both infant deaths), Great Grandson Kayden Diaz & his First Wife LaVonne Keller. The lives he touched, the love he gave, received and the goodness & kindness he showed is immeasurable. May God now show him mercy and allow him to dwell in his house forever & ever.
