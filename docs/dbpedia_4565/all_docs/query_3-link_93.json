        "text": "Prior to Billy Hebert Field's opening, the land which the field is built on had been used for baseball since the late 19th century. In 1927, Oak Park Field was constructed and in 1951, Oak Park was renamed Billy Hebert Field. After the field's grandstand was destroyed by fire for a second time, the modern-day grandstand was built in 1953. The current stadium has a capacity of holding 6,000 fans.\n\nThe field is named after Billy Hebert, the first resident of Stockton and professional baseball player to be killed in World War II. William J. \"Billy\" Hebert was born in Stockton, California on December 20, 1919. Known for his scrappy play, the infielder's diamond talents were first showcased with the Karl Ross post American Legion team. Hebert's final year in American Legion ball was in 1936, and he captained the team. Hebert was then signed by the Merced Bears of the California League for the 1941 season. He had an exceptional year batting .328 in 130 games to lead the team. Hebert led the league in double plays by a second basemen and a bright future in baseball seemed to be on the horizon for the 21-year-old. Shortly after the season ended, like many young men during this time, Hebert entered military service and joined the Navy.\n\nIn 1953, Billy Hebert Field was the original home to the Stockton Ports Minor League Baseball team. Notable players who have taken the field are Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig, Gary Sheffield, and Dave Henderson. It reamined the Stockton Ports home field until 2005, when Banner Island Ballpark was built.\n\nAdditionally, Billy Hebert Field has been used as a practice facility for the Stockton Lightning minor Arena League football team as well the home field for the University of the Pacific baseball team."
