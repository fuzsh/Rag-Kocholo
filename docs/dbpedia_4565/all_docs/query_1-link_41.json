        "text": "Envision Utah worked with the Open Space Sub-Committee of the Davis County Council of Governments, Nature Conservancy, the nine local municipalities bordering the Great Salt Lake within Davis County, and consultants, Sear Brown, to write and implement a comprehensive vision for the eastern shoreline of the Great Salt Lake in Davis County.\n\nLocal officials, developers, land owners, residents and other key stakeholders came together to develop a collaborative vision for the nine communities bordering the shores of the Great Salt Lake. A broadly and publicly supported plan has been developed that will guide growth and development in the area, while preserving the valuable agricultural and wetlands that these communities share.\n\nPhase II of the Shorelands plan is now in full swing as Davis County pursues implementation. Conservation subdivisions, transfer development right programs, and conservation easements are just some of the ways that Davis County is working to protect the quality of life in their growing communities. Download the Plan →\n\nProject Type: Regional Visioning | Project Date: 2002\n\nAlready the primary destination for shopping, employment, and entertainment in southern Salt Lake County, downtown Sandy is envisioned as a thriving mixed-use urban center. A walkable main street anchored on one end by Sandy City Hall and on the other end by South Towne Mall will create a vibrant environment. The TRAX light rail stop will be linked through the area to the nearby Frontrunner commuter rail stop via a downtown circulator. And skiers will be able to find lodging, food, and shopping, while easily accessing the nearby Wasatch Mountain resorts using public transportation.\n\nExisting destinations include Jordan Commons, South Town Expo Center, South Town Mall, Jordan High School, the Real Stadium, BD Medical, Workers Compensation Fund and Sandy's City Hall. This area also is connected to the Dimple Dell trail and the Jordan River Parkway.\n\nProject Type: TOD Site Design, Local Visioning | Project Date: 2012\n\nBetween 2000 and 2050, Morgan County will be among the most rapidly growing counties in Utah, with a 3.8% average annual rate of change in the population (GOPB 2008). Concern about the impact of growth on Morgan's quality of life mounted as new growth became an increasingly apparent reality. To address growth concerns, community leaders engaged the public in a process of proactive planning to help shape the county's future.\n\nEnvision Morgan, facilitated by Envision Utah, enabled citizens to explore the challenges associated with growth. Through the process, citizens created a long-term vision outlining how to best manage future growth and preserve current quality of life.\n\nProject Type: Regional Visioning | Project Date: 2008\n\nLearn More →\n\nThe Utah Department of Transportation (UDOT) invited Envision Utah to serve as the neutral facilitator in developing Growth Scenarios for the Mountain View Corridor (MVC). Envision Utah ensured meaningful involvement from stakeholder groups and citizens of the 16 cities involved. The MVC represents the last opportunity for a second major transportation connection between Salt Lake and Utah Counties.\n\nEnvision Utah partnered with residents, local jurisdictions, UDOT, Mountainland Association of Governments, Wasatch Front Regional Council, and Utah Transit Authority to develop growth scenarios that jointly evaluated transportation land-use issues and solutions for approximately 40 miles in western Salt Lake County and northern Utah County.\n\nThe MVC project is an unprecedented attempt to integrate local land-use planning and a transportation corridor that crosses interjurisdictional boundaries.\n\nMillions of federal dollars can be saved by strategically adjusting both local land-use plans and regional transportation decisions together. UDOT had never before had land-use discussions with communities in conjunction with an environmental impact statement.\n\nA widespread media campaign encouraged citizen involvement in the MVC process. Envision Utah hosted six community workshops for the 14 communities involved in the MVC. Residents were asked to design the type of community they want in 2030. Several hundred residents voiced their opinions on future land-use and transportation choices, including mass transit, farmland protection, walkable commercial areas, and economic development.\n\nFollowing the workshops, Envision Utah staff gave detailed presentations to each of the 14 city councils on the potential economic impact of each land-use choice. Ten more community meetings were held to fine-tune the potential land-use growth scenarios. This data influenced which transportation choices would be implemented.\n\nThe Governor's Office of Planning and Budget projects that by 2030 the population west of the Bangerter Highway will grow from 267,000 to 635,000 and employment opportunities will rise from 82,000 to 268,000. The current transportation network is clearly inadequate for this expected growth. The MVC is an attempt to meet this growing need, to develop future transportation infrastructure, and to improve the quality of life for these cities.\n\nProject Type: Regional Visioning | Project Date: 2004\n\nLearn More →\n\nTen communities in South Utah County (Springville, Mapleton, Spanish Fork, Salem, Woodland Hills, Elk Ridge, Payson, Santaquin, Genola, Goshen) worked closely with Envision Utah, Mountainland Association of Governments, the Governor's Office of Planning and Budget, the Automated Geographic Reference Center and lead consultants, Swaner Design, to develop a vision for accommodating the high growth levels projected for the area.\n\nThe Nebo Vision was a process that gave citizens an opportunity to talk, and for leaders to listen. By working together, they created a regional vision, tools and resources to help each individual community plan for the future as they continue to grow.\n\nThe vision document can be downloaded below by clicking on the appropriate link, either by section of in its entirety.\n\nProject Type: Regional Visioning | Project Date: 2001\n\nLearn More →\n\nEnvision Utah facilitated a community visioning process to assess a potential TOD stop at 9400 South in Sandy City near the Jordan Commons and South Town Exposition Center. The City Council and Planning Commission adopted the study in January 2004. A TRAX station at this location is consistent with the city's goals to achieve a vibrant downtown that provides for and makes all modes of transportation feasible and safe.\n\nThe ability to balance and coordinate the needs of pedestrians, bicyclists, motorists and transit users is a crucial aspect in the maturity of a downtown and, ultimately, in its success – particularly in an \"entertainment/business\" district that has mixed-uses, multiple destinations and varied clientele at all times of the day.\n\nProject Type: TOD Site Design | Project Date: 2004\n\nEnvision Utah assisted the four communities of South Salt Lake, West Jordan, Murray and Layton to evaluate potential land uses around existing and future transit stations. Staff worked with local residents and stakeholders to synthesize their wishes into a broadly and publicly supported plan. Each community's plan guides local development through design guidelines and ordinances. It also fostered each transit station becoming a \"destination\" of housing, retail, employment centers, entertainment and services.\n\nThe proactive planning of development around transit station is ensuring that our future transportation system is supported by smart land-use decision-making throughout the Greater Wasatch Area.\n\nDetails of these TOD studies can be found in the \"Appendix A: Specific Station Area Plans\" section of Envision Utah's \"Wasatch Front Transit Oriented Development Guidelines\" document linked below.\n\nProject Type: TOD Site Design | Project Date: 2002\n\nLearn More →\n\nAs the Utah Transit Authority (UTA) plans for future transit service in Salt Lake County, there is recognition of a relationship between transit-supportive land use and a successful transit system. Southwest Salt Lake County will help UTA to gain an understanding of the ridership that different land uses will generate.\n\nUnder the supervision of a steering committee, which represents a broad variety of interests from UTA and the Southwest Salt Lake County area, Envision Utah is conducting a transparent process that will create a public vision for a proposed transit line that will connect the communities of South Jordan, Herriman, Riverton and Draper.\n\nThis project will explore the market affecting the potential for Transit Oriented Development along the corridor and project a range of residential and commercial development that could be built over time. The study will also assist in refining the transit alignment and mode based on these expected future land uses.\n\nProject Type: TOD Site Design, Local Visioning, Regional Visioning | Project Date: 2014\n\nThe Tooele Valley has experienced rapid growth in the last decade. Between 1990 and 2000, Tooele County had the third highest growth rate in the state (53%), third only to Summit and Washington Counties. The growth of the Valley population is inevitable, however how and where that growth occurs is still within the power of the citizens of the Valley.\n\nResidents of Tooele County came together to develop the Tooele Valley Regional Plan, to help understand the implications of current trends, and to outline alternatives to the current growth pattern. Through a totally interactive process, Tooele County residents and key stakeholders gave their input on critical issues facing the Tooele Valley, developing a regional vision to help them plan and prepare for the future.\n\nProject Type: Regional Visioning | Project Date: 2003\n\nIn 2013, Governor Gary Herbert asked the State Water Strategy Advisory Team to make recommendations for a 50-year state water strategy. This effort was catalyzed by the Your Utah, Your Future vision, where more than 52,000 Utahns weighed in on their priorities for topics important the future of Utah, including water.\n\nEnvision Utah facilitated the advisory team, comprised of water experts from varying leadership positions around the state (click here to view the full list). The advisory team put in countless hours of research, intense discussion, and listening to the public to write the water strategy recommendations.\n\nThe advisory team organized their recommendations around the 11 key policy questions listed below. Each question is answered with several strategies.

Recognizing the complexity of land use issues in the region, the process brought together a wide range of stakeholders with varied perspectives into a public process. The effort yielded agreement on 10 growth principles which were adopted by the Washington County Commission and supported by local municipalities.\n\nOne of the most notable outcomes of the vision is its influence on the Washington County Growth and Conservation Act, a landmark federal lands bill that resolves long-running, contentious public land issues in a way that protects the land, the economy, and the way of life in the region.\n\nCommunities in Utah's Dixie continue to use the vision's principles as a guide when making land use decisions, maintaining a commitment to:\n\nPlan regionally, implement locally\n\nConserve water and maintain air and water quality\n\nGuard signature scenic landscapes\n\nProvide rich, connected natural recreation and open space\n\nBuild balanced transportation\n\nFocus growth in walkable centers that include housing, jobs and services\n\nDirect growth inward\n\nProvide a broad range of housing types\n\nReserve key areas for industry to grow the economic pie\n\nEngage in focused and strategic public lands conversion\n\nProject Type: Regional Visioning | Project Date: 2007\n\nLearn More →\n\nWasatch Canyons Tomorrow was a once-in-a-generation opportunity for the public to help guide the policies which will form the basis of a revision of the 1989 Salt Lake County Wasatch Canyons Master Plan for City Creek, Emigration, Red Butte, Parley's, Millcreek, Big Cottonwood, and Little Cottonwood Canyons. The Master Plan is the basis for the County's land use planning policies and ordinances.\n\nProcess: The Wasatch Canyons Tomorrow process engaged the public in setting priorities and identifying long-term strategies to enhance the value of the canyons for current residents and future generations. Among other things, the process explored the impacts of increased canyon use and address issues such as land use and development, watershed protection and water quality, recreation, natural resource management, transportation, and public safety.The process was sponsored by the State of Utah, Salt Lake County, and Salt Lake City. The U.S. Forest Service was a supportive partner, supplying technical expertise.\n\nThe results of Wasatch Canyons Tomorrow will inform, but not supersede existing plans in the study area, such as the Wasatch-Cache National Forest Plan or Salt Lake City's Watershed Management Plan. The public participated in this process through workshops, open houses, and on-line surveys.\n\nReport: The Wasatch Canyons Tomorrow report provides a menu of recommendations for projects, best management practices, and policies to be considered as we confront current and anticipated challenges in the management of the Wasatch Canyons. We also recognize that consideration of many of these recommendations will need future study and evaluation to determine their feasibility, environmental impact, compliance with federal, state and local laws, and compliance with existing management plans.\n\nProject Type: Regional Visioning | Project Date: 2010\n\nLearn More →\n\nOver 1000 residents of Weber, Davis, Salt Lake and Utah Counties attended 14 community workshops in 2005 as part of the Wasatch Choices 2040 effort. Through Wasatch Choices 2040, residents helped shaped the future roads and transit in their communities, and examined the relationship of the transportation system to neighborhoods, jobs, farms and open lands.\n\nWith the assistance of Envision Utah, public comments were carefully noted to form the basis for scenarios to explore new ideas in transportation and land-use that will influence the long-range transportation plans created by the Mountainland Association of Governments (MAG) and Wasatch Front Regional Council (WFRC).\n\nMAG and WFRC are composed of mayors and county officials and are required to update the regional transportation plan every three years. This collaborative effort has been funded by MAG, WFRC, Utah Department of Transportation, Utah Transit Authority and Envision Utah. Staker Parsons sponsored the process's five open houses.\n\nWasatch Choices 2040 recognized that it is futile to project patterns of growth without thinking about the transportation investments we make. For example, freeways and boulevards support different forms of commerce, while transit supports walkable forms of development.\n\nTwo of the products to come out of this process are Growth Principles and a Vision Scenario. The elected officials of WFRC and MAG unanimously adopted the Growth Principles in late 2005.\n\nThe Vision Scenario provides one plausible illustration of how the region could grow if the Growth Principles are adopted. The Vision results in 18% less congestion, 12% more transit use, and 23 fewer square miles of land consumption relative to the fully built-out 2030 long-range transportation plan.\n\n\"We are one of the first places in the nation to use a publicly created vision to guide the long-range transportation plan, and the Wasatch Choices 2040 approach is a national model,\" said Ted Knowlton, Envision Utah's Planning Director. In developing the next long-range transportation plan, the two MPOs will look at how regional transportation choices affect broader issues, such as housing, critical lands, air quality, and more.\n\nProject Type: Regional Visioning | Project Date: 2005\n\nLearn More →\n\nWeber County, the Townships of Reese, West Weber, Warren and Weber, and the neighborhood of Taylor worked with consultants Landmark Design and Envision Utah to assist residents in developing a community vision for the lands bordering the shore of the Great Salt Lake.\n\nWorking with key stakeholders and the general public, a plan has been developed to address a variety of land uses for the area including parks, trails, residential, commercial, agricultural, manufacturing, open spaces and other uses. West Weber County, unincorporated Weber County and the four townships, share valuable land and resources.\n\nThis planning provided them with a broadly and publicly supported vision that encourages quality growth and development with strategies to voluntarily preserve farmland and other critical land areas.\n\nProject Type: Regional Visioning | Project Date: 2002"
