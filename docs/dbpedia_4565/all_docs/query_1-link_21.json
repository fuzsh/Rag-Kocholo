        "text": "Please note: As of April 15, 2021 we are no longer doing regularly scheduled updates to this page.\n\nApril 15, 2021:\n\nOn April 13, 2021, the Utah Department of Health recommended that vaccine providers temporarily pause administration of the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine based on recent guidance from the CDC and U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The temporary pause is based on reports of some vaccine recipients experiencing blood clots after receiving the Johnson & Johnson vaccine. During the temporary pause of the administration of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, the state will continue administering the Moderna and Pfizer COVID-19 vaccines. More information about vaccine availability can be found here.\n\nApril 12, 2021:\n\nOn April 9, 2021, the Utah Department of Health issued State Public Health Order 2021-10, which provides an update on statewide COVID-19 Restrictions. The new Order is similar to previous orders, except that it removes the requirement that individuals wear face masks, except while attending an organized event. This change was made to reflect the recent passage of House Bill No. 294, which eliminated the state’s face mask requirement.\n\nMarch 25, 2021:\n\nOn March 24, 2021, Governor Cox signed House Bill No. 294, which provides for the automatic termination of some COVID-19 restrictions once the state’s 14-day case rate reaches a level below 191 per 100,000, the state’s ICU seven-day hospitalization rate is less than 15%, and at least 1.63 million prime doses of the COVID-19 vaccine have been allocated to the state.\n\nMost notably, under House Bill No. 294, the state’s mask mandate will terminate on April 10, 2021 (although the mask mandate may remain in place for gatherings of 50 or more people if individuals attending the gathering cannot physically distance at least 6 feet from others not in the same party). Additionally, House Bill No. 294 allows local county governments to enact their own mask mandates, but any mandates enacted by local governments will automatically terminate once the state meets the predetermined thresholds that are outlined in the Bill. Further, the Bill does not alter the mask mandates and other precautionary measures that are in place for public K-12 schools until July 1, 2021. Lastly, the Bill allows private businesses to continue requiring masks if the business so chooses.\n\nGovernor Cox also signed Senate Bill No. 107, which is related to in-person instruction in public K-12 schools and higher education institutions. Under this Bill, schools are required to offer in-person instruction at least 4 days per week, beginning on March 21, 2021. Additionally, the Bill would implement a “Test to Stay” program for schools providing in-person instruction, requiring students to undergo COVID-19 testing to attend in-person classes if a COVID-19 outbreak reaches the following thresholds:\n\n2% positivity if schools have 1,500+ students; or\n\n30 positive cases if schools have fewer than 1,500 students\n\nThe program requires parent permission to test students under the age of 18.\n\nMarch 18, 2021:\n\nOn March 18, 2021, Governor Spencer Cox announced that all Utah residents ages 16 and older will be eligible for the COVID-19 vaccine beginning March 24. More information about vaccine availability can be found here.\n\nMarch 2, 2021:\n\nOn February 26, 2021, Governor Cox announced that individuals age 16 or older with certain underlying health conditions are eligible for the COVID vaccine. Additionally, vaccination appointments can now be made with any Utah health department, removing the previous rule that residents could only make appointments with the health department in the area where they live. The state is scheduled to receive doses of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine beginning next week, in addition to the state’s current allocation of Moderna and Pfizer vaccines.\n\nFebruary 24, 2021:\n\nOn February 23, 2021, Governor Cox issued an executive order that provides updates to the state’s COVID-19 vaccination plan. The order states that COVID vaccination eligibility will now be at the direction of the Utah Department of Health. Additionally, the order reiterates the previously established vaccine provider requirements. No changes were made to current vaccine eligibility.\n\nFebruary 18, 2021:\n\nOn February 18, 2021, Governor Cox announced that individuals that are 65 years of age and older are now eligible for the COVID-19 vaccine. Individuals in this group may begin scheduling vaccination appointments as they become available. Additionally, the state is moving forward with the next phase of eligibility beginning on March 1. In the next phase, individuals with certain underlying medical conditions will be eligible for the vaccine. More information on vaccine eligibility can be found here.\n\nFebruary 17, 2021:\n\nOn February 16, 2021, Utah announced that it will begin COVID-19 contact tracing through smart phone applications to help slow the spread of COVID-19. Beginning on February 17, Utah residents will be able participate in the contact tracing efforts by opting in to COVID exposure notifications via smartphone devices. The state has explained that the electronic tracing does not store any personal data, and citizens must opt in to participate. Full information about the new contact tracing efforts can be found here.\n\nFebruary 15, 2021:\n\nOn February 12, 2021, Governor Cox signed a concurrent resolution recognizing the efforts of the state health departments and other individuals that have contributed to containing the spread of COVID-19 in the state. Additionally, the Utah Department of Health announced new guidance on their recent changes to the COVID-19 Transmission Index. These changes include updates on public gathering requirements when transmission levels reach low and moderate stages. In areas of moderate transmission, the new requirements are:\n\nPublic gatherings can occur with side-by-side seating, but event hosts must complete an event template, all guests must wear masks, guests must have assigned seating, and guests must attest to being free of COVID-19 symptoms or exposures for 14 days prior to the event.\n\nDuring Moderate phase, concession stands must be closed because of the increased risk of transmission of COVID-19.\n\nPhysical distance is still strongly recommended.\n\nIn addition to the moderate level changes, the Department of Health has also announced changes to low transmission levels. The changes for low transmission levels include mask mandates, as well as a requirement that hosts complete an event template. Updated COVID-19 transmission level guidance can be found here.\n\nFebruary 10, 2021:\n\nOn February 9, 2021, Governor Cox participated in a virtual COVID-19 Q&A session where he addressed questions related to vaccine availability, vaccine distribution, mask mandates, and next phases for vaccine eligibility. These Q&A sessions are expected to continue throughout the pandemic.\n\nFebruary 8, 2021:\n\nOn February 4, 2021, the state announced that it will be getting an increase in vaccine allocation of 5 percent, which brings the allocation up to 42,000 doses per week.

Walgreens and CVS pharmacies reallocated 28,275 additional doses for distribution throughout the state. These doses are in addition to the 8,775 doses received by the state this week, and the 19,500 doses that are scheduled to be delivered to the state next week.\n\nJanuary 21, 2021:\n\nOn January 21, 2021, Governor Cox gave on update on Utah’s coronavirus vaccine plan. The COVID-19 vaccines are currently available for healthcare workers, long-term care facility staff and residents, first responders, and K-12 teachers and school staff. As of January 21, 2021, Utah has administered the COVID-19 vaccines in the following amounts to the members of those groups:\n\n97% of vaccine doses allocated to local health departments;\n\n96% of vaccine doses allocated to hospitals;\n\n100% of vaccine doses allocated to community nursing services;\n\n83% of vaccine doses allocated to “other” groups;\n\n43% of vaccine doses allocated through the Federal Pharmacy Partnership.\n\nJanuary 11, 2021:\n\nOn January 8, Governor Cox issued Executive Order 2021-02, which orders that teachers and staff members in Utah’s K-12 schools will be eligible to receive the COVID-19 vaccine beginning the week of January 11, 2021. Governor Cox’s executive order also provides that Utahans aged 70 and older will be eligible to receive the COVID-19 vaccine beginning the week of January 18, 2021.\n\nAlso, on January 8, Governor Cox set a goal of fully immunizing all health care providers, including long-term care facility staff and residents, first responders, public and trial health frontline workers, K-12 teachers and school staff, and adults older than 70 by the end of February. The approximate number of Utah residents from these population groups totals 412,000.\n\nExecutive Order 2021-02 details vaccine eligibility and vaccine provider requirements, including not administering the vaccine provider requirements, including not administering the vaccine to someone who has tested positive from COVID-19 within 90 days, administering each COVID-19 vaccine within seven days of receiving the vaccine; and reporting data each day by 6:59 a.m. central time.\n\nExecutive Order 2021-02 also states that vaccine provider who does comply with the order may be subject to reduced COVID-19 vaccine distribution or no distribution for future distribution periods. A COVID-19 vaccine not used within seven days of distribution is subject to redistribution. The order further provides that the Utah Department of Health will coordinate with local health departments to establish procedures to offer monoclonal antibodies to residents of long-term care facilities who have tested positive for COVID-19.\n\nJanuary 6, 2021:\n\nThe Utah Department of Health has announced that it is currently in Phase 1 (Mid-December through Late December-January of its Vaccine Distribution Timeline) of its vaccine distribution plan. The COVID-19 vaccine is presently available to the following citizens either through employers or their local health department:\n\nAll hospital healthcare workers can be vaccinated by their employers;\n\nLong-term care facility healthcare workers can be vaccinated by their employers with the help of the CVS and Walgreens national pharmacy chains or by other local providers the Utah Department of Health has contracted to administer the vaccine;\n\nHome healthcare workers employers by home healthcare agencies can be vaccinated by their local health department;\n\nNon-hospital healthcare workers employed by independent medical clinics not associated with a hospital or healthcare system can get vaccinated by their local health department;\n\nEMS workers can be vaccinated through local health department or through their employers;\n\nAll other healthcare workers, including dentists, dental assistants, physical and occupational therapists, and medical aesthetics can be vaccinated by their local health departments;\n\nNon-EMS first responders such as law enforcement officers, dispatchers, and corrections officers can be vaccinated by contacting their local health departments or their employers.\n\nIndividuals from these groups who seek to be vaccinated through their local health department must contact their local health department to schedule an appointment. Each individual will need to provide proof of current active employment.\n\nThe state of Utah anticipates that the COVID-19 vaccine will be available to its citizens beginning in Mid-December 2020 with doses available to healthcare personnel in work in high risk environments through hospitals in the state that provide care to the highest number of COVID-19 patients. The state anticipates the vaccine will be available to the general population sometime between March-July 2021. Utah’s vaccine distribution timeline will progress as follows:\n\nMid-December:\n\nhealthcare personnel who work in high-risk environments in the state’s hospitals that provide care to the highest volume of COVID-19 patients.\n\nLate December-January:\n\nhealthcare workers who work in high-risk environments in the remaining hospital facilities;\n\nremaining healthcare personnel including clinics, pharmacy state, Tribal health long-term care facilities, assisted living facilities, skilled nursing staff, and other healthcare personnel who are high-risk;\n\nSchool staff;\n\nEMS, first responders, public health workers, community health workers, and Tribal EMS and Tribal public health workers.\n\nFebruary:\n\nLong-term care facility staff and residents who have not been vaccinated;\n\nUtahns 75 and older;\n\nUtahns with certain underlying medical conditions (specific conditions have not yet been determined).\n\nMarch-July:\n\nTribal reservation communities;\n\nAdditional Utahns based on age (prioritization not yet determined);\n\nAdditional Utahns living in congregate care settings (prioritization to be determined);\n\nRacial and ethnic groups at higher-risk;\n\nAll Utahns.\n\nThe timeline is subject to change based on vaccine availability.\n\nJanuary 5, 2021:\n\nOn January 4, 2021, the Utah Department of Health (UDOH) announced that it is offering free rapid antigen testing at several locations throughout the state. Testing locations were chosen based on positivity rates, lower numbers of tests conducted, untreated wastewater sampling, and other surveillance data. Anyone, regardless of if they have COVID-19 symptoms or not, can be tested at these free testing sites. Those who want to be tested can find a location and register through the state’s online map. UDOH encourages everyone to pre-register to limit delays at the testing sites.\n\nBecause rapid antigen tests are less sensitive than PCR tests, the UDOH will require a PCR test under certain circumstances. For instance, if an individual has COVID-19 symptoms and tests negative on the rapid antigen test or if an individual does not have symptoms and test positive on the rapid antigen test, they will be referred for a follow up confirmation PCR test.\n\nNovember 23, 2020:\n\nOn November 23, 2020, the Utah Department of Health released a new public health order. The department’s previous order, issued on November 8, 2020, expires at midnight. The new order is identical to the original order and is effective from November 24, 2020 until December 8, 2020 unless otherwise modified or amended.\n\nNovember 12, 2020:\n\nOn November 12, 2020, Governor Herbert and the Utah Department of Health provided additional clarification to the State of Emergency Order and the Public Health Order. The revised orders clarify the following:\n\nPhysical child custody exchanges, court-ordered parent time, and at-home child care services (such as nannies and babysitters) are permitted;\n\nThe requirement for college and university students who live on-campus or attend at least one class a week on-campus to be tested weekly for COVID-19 applies only to students who are 18 or older.\n\nNovember 11, 2020:\n\nOn November 8, following several weeks of increased strain on Utah’s hospitals due to a rise in COVID-19 cases, Governor Herbert declared a new state of emergency to address hospital overcrowding. Governor Herbert and the Utah Department of Health issued concurrent executive and public health orders to curb the surging case counts. Both orders are effective from November 9, 2020 through November 23, 2020.\n\nThe orders do the following:\n\nInstitute a statewide mask mandate, requiring Utahns to wear masks in public, and when within six feet of anyone outside their household. The mandate also applies to businesses, requiring employees and patrons to wear masks, and post signage. Businesses that fail to take the required actions will be subject to fines. In his press release, the Governor also noted that the mask mandate will remain in effect for the foreseeable future, extending past the expiration of the initial orders.\n\nLimit casual social gatherings to household-only.\n\nAll extracurricular activities, including athletic and intramural events on hold. The orders do not apply to intercollegiate athletic events, or practices and games associated with high school championships provided that those events follow the state’s instructions for testing and limiting crowd size.\n\nBeginning as soon as possible, but no later than January 1, 2021, students enrolled at public and private higher education institutions who either live on campus or attend one in person class per week will be required to be tested for COVID-19 weekly.\n\nUtah also announced that it will activate additional National Guard resources to assist with contact tracing, and rollout of an accelerated testing initiative for asymptomatic individuals. This program will focus on the required weekly testing on college campuses, testing for student participating in extracurricular activities, and eventual workplace testing for people 35 and under. The Utah Department of Health is also working to expand rapid asymptomatic testing for high school teachers. All K-12 teachers in the state currently have universal access to PCR testing through TestUtah.\n\nOn November 9, Governor Herbert and the Utah Department of Health released updated orders clarifying several points of confusion from the initial orders. The updated orders provide the following:\n\nBars and restaurants may remain open but are not permitted to serve alcohol after 10:00 p.m.\n\nAthletic events run by private companies, such as dance and karate classes, are permitted to continue provided that max attendance numbers, mask wearing, and physical distancing requirements are enforced.\n\nOctober 7, 2020:\n\nOn October 1, the Utah Labor Commission announced the launch of the Small Business Quarantined Employee Grant program (“Grant”). This grant program will help small businesses with less than 50 employees continue to pay employees who are required to quarantine or isolate due to a positive COVID-19 test or exposure to someone who has tested positive. The $2 million Grant uses federal CARES Act funds as part of Utah’s response to the coronavirus pandemic. It provides reimbursement to small business employers who pay employees to stay home during quarantine or isolation for a maximum of 40 hours per week for a period of up to two calendar weeks.\n\nSeptember 23, 2020:\n\nOn September 19, 2020, Governor Herbert issued an Executive Order that again placed Utah under a state of emergency. Under the new State of Emergency, the governor will only take certain executive actions, such as suspending statutes, if asked to do so by the Public Health and Economic Emergency Commission. For more information on this policy, see the governor’s letter to legislative leadership.\n\nAugust 25, 2020:\n\nOn August 21, 2020, Governor Herbert reissued an executive order declaring a continued state of emergency.

He highlighted a study done by researchers at Brigham Young University that highlighted masks can be effective at reducing spread and masks are not dangerous to wear. Governor Herbert encourages all Utahns to read the study, linked here, and wear a mask.\n\nJuly 30, 2020:\n\nOn July 30, Governor Herbert and Utah State Schools Superintendent Sydnee Dickson and state epidemiologist Dr. Angela Dunn held a joint news conference announcing the new guidelines for schools to reopen, in-person, in the fall.\n\nStudents should\n\nTell parents or teachers of COVID-19 symptoms\n\nStay home if they are sick\n\nIsolate if they test positive\n\nQuarantine if they are exposed to someone who tests positive for COVID-19\n\nSocial distance\n\nWash hands\n\nWear face coverings while at school\n\nParents should\n\nCheck their child’s temperature every day before school\n\nKeep child home if the child has a temperature of 100.4 degrees or higher\n\nAlert the school if the child has any health conditions that put them at a greater risk from COVID-19\n\nTeachers should\n\nPrepare curriculum plans in case the teacher must isolate or quarantine\n\nPurchase disposable disinfecting wipes to wipe down high traffic surfaces\n\nSchools should\n\nPrepare for children to get sick at school and have an area to allow the school nurse to respond to sick students\n\nHave separate areas for students who are sick without COVID-19 symptoms, students who have scheduled medical needs, and students who have COVID-19 symptoms\n\nCall parents to pick up their child if the child has symptoms of COVID-19\n\nIf immediate pick up is not possible and the child must ride the bus, all children on the bus should wear a mask and physically distance\n\nClean any rooms COVID-19 students were in for 15 minutes or longer\n\nDetermine what protective equipment employees who interact with students should wear\n\nHave a point of contact person who will work with the health department on contract tracing\n\nContact students, teachers, or employees who came into contact with someone who tests positive for COVID-19\n\nIf schools can’t provide a safe learning environment, the school needs to consider temporary remote learning or closure\n\nAnyone who tests positive for COVID-19 must isolate until\n\nSymptoms are gone\n\nPerson has been fever free for 24 hours without medicine\n\nIt has been 10 days since the first positive test or sign of symptoms\n\nIndividuals do not need to show proof of negative COVID-19 test before returning to school\n\nJuly 28, 2020:\n\nJuly 27, Governor Herbert has issued Executive Order 2020-46, which will be in effect until August 7, 2020.
