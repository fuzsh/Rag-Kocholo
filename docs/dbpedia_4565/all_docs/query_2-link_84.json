        "text": "Utah Gov. Gary Herbert stopped into Denver on Monday promoting his ” State of Utah Outdoor Recreation Vision,” which outlines how the state’s landscape and recreational opportunities can support Utah’s blossoming economy.\n\n“We are playing catch-up in terms of awareness. We are not as well known as Vail,” said the governor who suddenly has thrown recreation into the mix as he balances energy demands with an increasingly influential outdoor industry in Utah.\n\nBut don’t think the Republican governor has turned barefooted tree-hugger. Recreation is a pillar of economic growth, alongside technology, finance, education, health care and energy development, he said..\n\n“The number one focus I’ve had is the economy,” said Herbert, who arrived in the governorship in 2009 at the depth of the recession. “Get the economy right and everything else falls into place. You can have great outdoor recreation but a really lousy quality of life without a job.”\n\nAs the governor in 2011 expanded energy development and sued the federal government over the state’s rights to roads on federal land, including land inside national parks and wilderness areas, he drew flack from outdoor industry business owners and groups.\n\nOutdoor Industry Association, a Boulder-based trade group representing the $646 billion outdoor industry, expressed outrage at Herbert’s lawsuit, saying in an August 2012 open letter to the governor: “We have not and will not sit silently on threats to the nation’s recreation infrastructure.”\n\nThe association’s biannual Outdoor Retailer tradeshows are the largest in Utah, drawing 17,000 visitors who stir a $40 million annual impact in Salt Lake City. The association was pondering a move to another location – including Denver and Las Vegas – and said the political climate was a factor in choosing a home.\n\nHerbert met with the association’s board of directors in August 2012 and the group urged the governor to draft a formal direction for outdoor recreation in Utah, which contributes $5.8 billion to the state’s economy, including $4 billion in annual retail sales.\n\nThe state spends $12 million a year promoting tourism but had never developed a specific plan for outdoor recreation like it had for energy production.\n\nThe governor presented his State of Utah Outdoor Recreation Vision to the Outdoor Industry Association at its Winter Market trade show in January.\n\nThe association announced it was keeping its summer and winter market shows in Salt Lake City through 2016 that same week.\n\nThe governor recently appointed the country’s first-ever “Director of Outdoor Recreation” and promises to soon implement a plan of action for the 59-page vision.\n\n“The real work now begins but there is no denying that the governor has made meaningful progress during the past twelve months,” said Frank Hugelmeyer, the executive director of the Outdoor Industry Association.\n\n“Our hope is that more state leaders recognize how important outdoor recreation is to their economies and that they follow Gov. Herbert’s example by forming an office of outdoor recreation within their administration.”\n\nThe association’s 2012 economic impact report found that outdoor recreation generates $646 billion in annual consumer spending and $80 billion in federal and state taxes across the country, employing 6.1 million Americans. Hugelmeyer said that outdoor recreation employs nearly three times as many people as the oil and gas industry.\n\nBut Herbert is not elevating outdoor recreation above energy development. He credits energy development for helping his state recover from the recession. (Utah is ranked second behind North Dakota for employment recovery from the trough of the recession according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, joining several other energy-developing states at the top of the list.)\n\nHerbert envisions Utah’s 4.6 percent unemployment rate dropping below 4 percent in the next 18 months.\n\n“Particularly if you take advantage of some of the energy potential,” he said. “We have great potential with our energy development.”\n\nThat worries those outdoor industry groups that hoped Herbert would elevate recreation above extractive uses. The Bureau of Land Management recently announced plans to lease thousands of acres for oil and gas development in the red rock canyons of south-central Utah’s San Rafael Swell, which includes lands included in the proposed Red Rocks Wilderness Act now before Congress. And the state agency that manages Utah’s school trust lands last week announced it would lease 80,000 acres of the Book Cliffs in Grand County, Utah for oil and gas development, riling sportsmen’s groups that value road-free sections of the region for wildlife.\n\n“The governor has the ability to use his soapbox to advocate for the industries that are most important to the state and clearly the new vision statement says outdoor recreation is an important industry,” said Peter Metcalf, the president of Salt Lake City’s Black Diamond Inc. who has battled with Herbert over the state’s lawsuit over ownership of federal lands in Utah, calling it s land grab that could lead to less protection and more extraction.\n\n“The governor has long been a wonderful advocate on behalf of energy and the idea that the state needs to speed up the process allowing energy development in specific places,” Metcalf said. “His recreation vision is a good, balanced mission that we support but a vision without policy is nothing but a vision. We need to see policy initiative and action. We would love to see him get out front and advocate for outdoor places and policies just as he does for those extractive industries.”\n\nHerbert says the ire of conservationists and the push from energy developers creates “healthy tension.”\n\n“Trying to find the right balance point is going to be an ongoing quest,” he said, noting how his regional management plans incorporate varied voices in a process that weighs both development and recreational demands. “It’s a matter of people sitting down and really trying to find the proper balance point and really trying to find a way to move forward positively with the proverbial win-win. Eighty percent of people on all sides of the issues are willing to do that. I’ve come to believe that there are 10 percent on either extreme who don’t want to compromise. We will find that balance and move ahead. We won’t please everybody, but we will please 80 percent.”\n\nJason Blevins: 303-954-1374, jblevins@denverpost.com or twitter.com/jasontblevins"
