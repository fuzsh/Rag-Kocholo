        "text": "Born in Fairview, Utah\n\nOn July 11, 1975, Spencer Cox is born in Fairview, Utah, where he spends his entire childhood and much of his adulthood.\n\nEmbarks on a mission to Mexico\n\nAs a member of the Church of Latter Day Saints, Cox puts his education on hold and goes on a mission with his church to Mexico, where he serves for two years.\n\nGraduates from Utah State\n\nAfter receiving his associate’s degree from Snow College, Cox attends and graduates from Utah State University with his wife and obtains a bachelor’s degree in political science.\n\nElected to first public office\n\nMarking the start of his political career, Cox is elected as a city councilor in his hometown of Fairview, Utah.\n\nBecomes Mayor of Fairview\n\nAfter one year on the city council, Fairview’s citizens elect Cox to be their mayor.\n\nElected to a full term as lieutenant governor\n\nAfter being selected by Governor Herbert to take over the lieutenant governor position in the middle of a term, Cox wins re-election to his first full term as lieutenant governor.\n\nMental Health\n\nUtah has one of the country’s highest suicide rates, and Governor Cox has been outspoken about his mission to address this problem. Cox initiated the Live On program to address mental health issues and to provide funding for resources and education geared toward suicide prevention.\n\nAgriculture\n\nHailing from a rural state, Cox has made agriculture a priority during his administration. He has called for funding for rural infrastructure improvements and appointed a senior advisor of rural affairs to his cabinet, a position that did not previously exist.\n\nEducation\n\nGovernor Cox has argued strongly for education reform, hoping to reduce teacher abandonment of the profession. He has called for more equitable funding for all school districts in the state and more support for teachers."
