        "text": "SALT LAKE CITY — With Wednesday’s announcements from former Vice President Mike Pence and North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, the field of 2024 Republican presidential candidates is growing.\n\nFormer New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie announced his intentions earlier this week.\n\nFormer Utah Gov. Gary Herbert was worked closely with many of these candidates in the past. On Wednesday, Herbert joined Inside Sources with Boyd Matheson to talk about the current candidates.\n\nMatheson begins the conversation by asking, “What do you do when all of your friends decide to run for president of the United States?”\n\n“It’s a dilemma,” Herbert said. “… It’s going to be an interesting race. I’m partial to governors.”\n\nHerbert also says most of the candidates that have either declared their candidacy or are thinking about running are governors.\n\n“I think governors bring an expertise and a skill set that’s needed in the executive branch as president,” he said.\n\nFrom governors to presidential candidates\n\nIn terms of the governors running, Matheson asked, “What is it that they bring from the governor’s office that would be helpful in the oval office?”\n\n“They all have talents,” Herbert said. “They got to find a niche to exploit their positives and minimize their negatives.”\n\nIn all, Herbert says the field is wide open with a lot of “good, qualified candidates.” However, he acknowledges people may be looking for “something younger, more visionary.”\n\n“I think if ever there was a year for third party candidates,” Herbert said. “This is the year Ross Perot should have run.”\n\nMatheson asked, “What’s one thing that you would hope would be a center point, a principle or policy that you think could get traction for any of these candidates?”\n\n“Common sense really is a common ground that we can get to together,” he said. “… Now, it’s the time to take the label off of our foreheads and replace it with common sense. Common sense will bring us together.”\n\nListen to the entire segment.\n\nInside Sources with Boyd Matheson can be heard weekdays from 1 p.m. to 3 p.m. on KSL NewsRadio. Users can find the show on the KSL NewsRadio website and app.\n\nRead more:\n\nRon DeSantis to announce 2024 presidential campaign Wednesday in conversation with Elon Musk\n\nWhere things stand leading into the 2024 presidential election"
