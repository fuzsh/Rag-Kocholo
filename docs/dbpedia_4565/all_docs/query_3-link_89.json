        "text": "Sawyer Hemsley\n\nB.S., Communication Studies, ’18\n\nOriginally from Preston, Idaho, Sawyer Hemsley moved to Logan, Utah in 2012 to attend Utah State University. Sawyer’s passion for cookies and people led to the beginning of the cookie empire, Crumbl Cookies, in 2017. A year later, he earned his bachelor’s degree at USU in communication studies with minors in marketing and multimedia development.\n\nCommunity has always been extremely important to Sawyer, and he made the most of his USU experience by serving with USUSA and the A-Team.\n\nToday, Sawyer sits as Crumbl’s COO and company visionary, with his cousin, Crumbl co-founder Jason McGowen, serving as CEO. In the four years since Crumbl was born, it has expanded to more than 200 bakery locations throughout 32 states. The company saw 93% growth from 2020-2021 and went viral on TikTok with fans sharing videos throughout the country.\n\nBobby Wagner\n\nB.S., Entrepreneurship, ’12\n\nCalifornia-native Bobby Wagner is Utah State University’s newest NFL Hall of Fame inductee. He and Merlin Olsen are the only Aggies ever to be named to the NFL’s All-Decade Team.\n\nHe was only rated a “two-star recruit” following his senior year of high school, but Wagner has gone on to prove those ratings don’t equate successful careers in collegiate or professional football. In his time with USU, Wagner led the Western Athletic Conference in tackles and was a three-time first-team all WAC selection. He finished his junior season with 446 tackles — tied for the most in Utah State history.\n\nThe linebacker was drafted to the NFL in 2012 by the Seattle Seahawks, where he’s started ever since. He was named the First-Team All-Pro six times, led the NFL tackles twice, been named to the Pro Bowl seven times, and is the two-time record holder for tackles in the franchise’s history. Wagner fought for his Super Bowl ring in 2013’s win against the Denver Broncos.\n\nWagner used his business-savvy to self-negotiate a $54 million contract with the Seahawks in 2019. He has consistently been highlighted on the NFL’s Top 100 Player lists.\n\nJaycee Carroll\n\nB.A., Spanish, ’08\n\nFrom his hometown in Evanston, Wyoming, to Madrid, Spain, Jaycee Carroll has dominated basketball courts internationally. The 6-foot-2 guard moved to Logan, Utah, to play for the Aggies in 2004 and maintained a reputation as a point-leader in college as well as professionally.\n\nIn his senior season with the Aggies, Carroll was named the Western Athletic Conference Player of the Year. He rounded out his tenure as an Aggie with a 49.8% three-point average — the best in the country. He came in second for free throws (91.9%) and was ranked No. 13 in scoring nationally — setting the record at Utah State. He is the second Aggie the Associated Press has named All-American (along with Wayne Estes) and the only Aggie to have been named All-American twice.\n\nFollowing graduation, Carroll moved overseas to play in the European courts. His professional career started with Teramo Basket in the Italian Serie A until 2009. He was able to dust off his Spanish when he moved to Spain to play for Club Baloncesto Gran Canaria until 2011. Then he played for 10 years with Real Madrid where he was a three-time Spanish League Champion, two-time EuroLeague Champion, and FIBA International Cup Champion.\n\nSam & Kacie Malouf\n\nSam: M.S., Accounting, ’04 & Kacie: B.S., Music Therapy, ’03\n\nSam and Kacie Malouf met while attending Utah State University. From when the couple founded their bedding company Malouf as newlyweds in 2003, to becoming a certified B Corporation in 2016 with hundreds of employees, the Maloufs have focused on being responsible — socially, environmentally, and civically — as can be seen in their investment in solar energy and eco-friendly products, plus their humanitarian work.\n\nMalouf designs, manufactures, and distributes a wide range of innovative products, which are available online, in more than 15,000 retail locations across the United States, and at a growing number of international specialty sleep stores in more than 30 countries. It also has on-staff charity managers who oversee the many charitable initiatives Malouf participates in and organize employees so they can use their unique skills to help people in need.\n\nIn 2016, the Maloufs created the non-profit Malouf Foundation to raise awareness of and ultimately put an end to domestic human trafficking and sexual exploitation.\n\nSpencer Cox\n\nB.A., Political Science, ’98\n\nSpencer Cox has worn many hats, but his love of Utah runs through all.\n\nHis farming roots have shown through his time as an attorney, businessman, and in various political roles from city council to mayor all the way to the 18th governor of the state of Utah.\n\nCox returned to Utah and began his law career at Salt Lake City’s Fabian Clendenin. After a while, his rural roots called to him, and he moved back to his hometown with his wife and children to work at the family business: CentraCom to bring internet and connectedness to underserved areas of the state.\n\nHe worked his way up the public service until he served as Lieutenant Governor under Gov. Gary Herbert before his own gubernatorial run started in 2021. He has made compassion and rural statewide initiatives a priority so none in Utah feel forgotten, while also balancing environmental and water rights with conservation initiatives.\n\nGreg Carr\n\nB.S., History, ’82\n\nHaving made his fortune revolutionizing the telecommunications industry with his company Boston Technology, and later with Prodigy Inc., established the Gregory C.

She was one of the first 10 U.S. women to travel to space.\n\nLars Peter Hansen\n\nB.S., Mathematics, ’74, B.S.

USU awarded her an honorary doctorate in the mid-90s.\n\nMerlin Olsen\n\nB.S., Finance, ’62\n\nNFL Hall of Famer Merlin Olsen is considered the greatest athlete in Utah State University history.\n\nOlsen’s outstanding record on both college and NFL football fields was followed by successful careers as a beloved television actor and as a television sports commentator. He is remembered also as a tireless philanthropist, giving enormous amounts of time, talent, and financial resources to numerous causes across the country.\n\nA native of Logan, Utah, Olsen was a two-time All-American (1960-61) as a defensive lineman at Utah State and won the 1961 Outland Trophy as the nation's outstanding interior lineman.\n\nAs the second player selected in the 1962 National Football League Draft, Olsen became a charter member of the Los Angeles Rams, and the famed \"Fearsome Foursome.\" In 15 pro seasons, he was named to an NFL record 14 Pro Bowls.
