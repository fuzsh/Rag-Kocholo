        "text": "Utah County is thoroughly acquainted with Gov. Gary Herbert.\n\nAfter all, he is from Orem, born in American Fork and previously served as a county commissioner.\n\nSo, as Utahns head to the polls now through Nov. 8, the decision may not be a difficult one.\n\nIn the last seven years as governor, Herbert seems to have served Utah pretty well. Herbert’s Democratic challenger this election, Mike Weinholtz, is looking for change however.\n\nThe Daily Herald editorial board met with Herbert in October to review his accomplishments in office and discuss some of the issues causing great concern to Utahns.\n\nIt is no secret that in the last four years, Utah has taken great pride in touting its business success. Herbert will be the first to do so.\n\n”We set a goal to become the best performing economy in America, and a premier global destination, and we’ve done it,” Herbert said when he met with the Daily Herald editorial board. “We had a vision of where we wanted to go, and we made it happen.”\n\nWhile we understand there are still strides to be made in the business world in Utah — like talent demands among low unemployment — one cannot ignore (and perhaps we’ve tried) the seemingly daily inundation of rankings raking in from across the country labeling Utah, and often cities in Utah County, No. 1 for business, health or livability.\n\nAs a governor, Herbert not only has traveled throughout the state, remaining dialed in on issues affecting various counties, but he’s also represented Utah well on a national and international stage. (The days are gone when Utahns could hold secret the beauties and charms we treasure so much.) We wish other nationally elected officials represented Utah as well as Herbert and Lt. Gov. Spencer Cox, who has also been an asset to Utahns whether they are aware of it or not.\n\nThough the Daily Herald reached out to the Weinholtz camp, we were unable to coordinate a meeting with Weinholtz to discuss his platform and proposed changes.\n\nDuring his campaign, it has been publicized that Weinholtz would like to legalize medical cannabis and address Utah’s opioid addiction. Though Herbert has referred to Utah County as Happy Valley in many positive ways, opioid addiction is something that seems to plague residents and take a number of lives. In most recent decades, the term “Happy Valley” has taken on an ironic meaning to residents and outsiders — indicative of a deeper mental health problem that needs greater focus and resources.\n\nWeinholtz also advocates for clean air initiatives and renewable resources, Medicaid expansion and women’s issues.\n\nWomen’s issues don’t appear to be a key issue frequently discussed on the state level or by Herbert, and we appreciate Weinholtz shedding some light on women’s safety and the problems of sexual assault and domestic violence occurring in Utah, as well as taking a look at ways to better the workplace for women as to meet national standards. It’s a poor reputation that needs to be taken more seriously.\n\nHerbert and Weinholtz both recognize there is a problem with Utah’s education system. It is underfunded, and that appears to be the most urgent problem to tackle. Weinholtz would like to return to Utah’s 1995 funding structure to add $1 billion dollars to the state’s primary and secondary education system. Herbert has promised, that like Utah’s business reputation, he plans to make Utah No. 1 in education as well with the goal to add $1 billion of new money into the system over the next five years.\n\nWith that and because of previous success, we believe Herbert should continue in office another term and be given the chance to keep his promise: Utah needs to change the way it does education so it can be one of the top states in the nation rather than known for its lack of spending per pupil.\n\nHis current record suggests he will work to make it a reality."
