        "text": "Utah Gov. Gary Herbert was honored on Tuesday with the National Association of State Chief Information Officers’ Technology Champion Award at its midyear conference in National Harbor, Maryland.\n\nHerbert won the award, which is presented annually to state executives for advancing the use of information technology in the public sector, for initiatives to expand broadband access throughout the state, a job-training program called Tech Pathways, overseeing the opening of the Utah Cyber Center in 2018, and championing IT innovations that have saved the state money and improved service delivery, according to NASCIO.\n\nUtah state Chief Information Officer Mike Hussey accepted the award for Herbert, who did not attend the conference.\n\n“He’s truly been a technology champion over the years I’ve been able to serve with him,” said Hussey, whom the Republican governor appointed in 2015. Hussey then read a statement prepared by the governor.\n\n“It is our passion, drive and vision that keeps Utah at the forefront of technology development in the public sector and that has kept Utah as a technology leader year after year. Also importantly, our department of technology services keeps a razor-sharp focus on using technology to better connect our citizens and state government. That dedication makes a difference to the lives of everyday Utahans and it will continue far into the future,” part of Herbert’s statement went."
