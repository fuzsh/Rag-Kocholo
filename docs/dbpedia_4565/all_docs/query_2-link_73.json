Gary Herbert is celebrating 10 years of being in office.\n\nHe tweeted on Saturday morning that he has served as Utah's governor for a decade.\n\n\"It has been my honor and privilege to serve the people and the state that I love so much as governor for ten years,\" Herbert stated. \"I am proud of who we are and how far we have come.\"\n\nHe added:\n\nI look forward to continuing to work with you in the days ahead for the betterment of Utah.\n\nUtah Lt. Governor Spencer Cox shared Herbert's sentiment, saying it's been an honor to serve alongside him.\n\n\"For the best 10 years, Governor Herbert has dedicated every minute of his life to making Utah a better place for everyone,\" Cox stated. \"The results speak for themselves. It has been the honor of a lifetime to serve by his side.\"\n\nHerbert received the mantle of the governor after former governor Jon Huntsman, Jr., resigned and became the U.S. Ambassador to China in 2009. He served as Lt. Governor under Huntsman's tenure."
