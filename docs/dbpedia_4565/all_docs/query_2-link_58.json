        "text": "Governor Gary Herbert is harnessing the “hive mentality” – or spirit of industry and corporation – that makes Utah the Beehive State to ensure the state’s economy will bounce back from the hardships of COVID-19. He recently launched Utah Leads Together, a comprehensive economic recovery plan to return to the record-setting growth the state was experiencing before the virus spread.\n\n“We must protect against the devastating health effects of COVID-19 and provide the best care possible to those who contract the virus,” said Governor Herbert. “At the same time we must protect and provide concrete practices and policies to those impacted by the economic consequences the virus has created. And that includes everyone.”\n\nTo ensure no Utahn will be left behind, Governor Herbert included over 100 community, healthcare, business, and government leaders in drafting the Utah Leads Together plan, which includes three phases: urgent phase, stabilization phase and recovery phase. Alongside the recovery plan, the governor launched an Economic Response Task Force to prevent and alleviate coronavirus impacts in the state.\n\nGovernor Herbert is fully focused on the health and safety of Utahns as he carries out his dynamic, data-driven strategy to combat COVID-19 and get the economy booming again in the Beehive State."
