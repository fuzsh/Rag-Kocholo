With the help of his wife, Price administered life-saving measures and stayed with the individual until medical personnel arrived.\n\nPrice began his Air Force career in September 2005 as an Aerospace Maintenance Journeyman with the 151st Mission Support Group before cross-training to become a boom operator. Price has been recognized by his peers his for dedication to his work and the United States Air Force.\n\n“Tech. Sgt. Price has been a consistent asset to the 151 ARW, his efforts in his day-to-day scheduling duties for the Wing’s flying operations are matched only by his exceptional airmanship as a boom operator,” said Lt. Col. Doug Foster, former 151st Operations Support Squadron commander, “Sean is always willing to lean in on any task that needs to be accomplished. Without fail, Sean was one of my go-to operators to just get the work done.”\n\nFoster added that Price’s Air Force training requirements including Self Aid Buddy Care, which he says helped contribute to him knowing how to initially treat the suspected injuries of the occupant and then coordinate care."
