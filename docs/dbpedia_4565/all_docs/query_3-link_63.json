        "text": "Gary Michel Reynolds, 82, of Cicero, passed away on October 25, 2023, at the home of his beloved daughter and son-in-law. He was born August 12, 1941, to Herbert and Helena (Roth) Reynolds in New Castle, Indiana. He grew up in Straughn, Indiana, where he became an entire town’s ‘son.’\n\nGary received a degree in Chemical Engineering from Rose Polytechnic Institute, now Rose Hulman, in 1963 and launched into what would become a lifelong career with Firestone Industrial Products. Starting as an applications engineer, he quickly moved into territory sales management, and, eventually, heading International Sales, which allowed him to travel the world, creating lifelong friendships along the way. He traveled throughout Europe, Southeast Asia and South America, but always professed Australia and New Zealand to be his favorites. He retired from Firestone in 2003 as President of Industrial Products. Gary’s work was important to him, but more important were the people he worked with, who became his extended family, creating a bond that continued beyond retirement, as all of them held a special place in his heart.\n\nGary enjoyed fishing, particularly with his buddies, fixing anything and everything, and working on the house or in the yard … or on someone else’s house or yard! He was also an avid race fan, attending the Indianapolis 500 annually for many years. Gary was the ‘consummate neighbor’ and lived and breathed to help his friends and family.\n\nFamily was very important to Gary. He is survived by his daughters, Lisa (Chris) Carnes and Heather (Ed) Flake; son, Michel (Danette) Reynolds; 7 grandchildren, each of whom he was so very proud: Dr. Jordan (Tyler Hall) Beauchamp, Kyle Carnes, Trevor Carnes, Logan Flake, Rheagan Baltz, Jackson Baltz and Holden Reynolds; as well as his wife’s beloved dachshund, Cooper, who became his constant companion following her death.\n\nIn addition to his parents, he was preceded in death by his wife of 57 years, Beverly Anne Reynolds in 2021.\n\nVisitation will be from 2:00 pm to 6:00 pm, with services starting at 6:00 pm, on Friday, November 3, 2023, at Randall & Roberts Funeral Home, 1150 Logan Street, in Noblesville. A private burial will be held at a later date.\n\nMemorial contributions may be made to The Jimmy V Foundation, 14600 Weston Parkway, Cary, NC 27513 (https://www.v.org/).\n\nCondolences: www.randallroberts.com"
