        "text": "Gary Richard Herbert (born May 7, 1947) is the 17th and current Governor of the U.S. state of Utah. Having served as the sixth Lieutenant Governor of Utah from 2005 to 2009, he assumed the governorship on August 11, 2009, following the resignation of Jon Huntsman, current United States Ambassador to the People's Republic of China.\n\nHerbert was born to Paul and Carol Peters in American Fork, later being adopted by his stepfather, Duane Barlow Herbert. Governor Herbert grew up in Orem, Utah. He graduated from Orem High School, served a two year mission for the LDS Church in the Eastern States Mission and later attended Brigham Young University, but did not graduate.\n\nHe is married to Jeanette Snelson Herbert; they have six children and thirteen grandchildren."
