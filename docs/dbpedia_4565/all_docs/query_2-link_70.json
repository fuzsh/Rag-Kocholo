(AP Photo/Susan Walsh)\n\nSALT LAKE CITY- During his monthly press conference, Governor Gary Herbert emphasized the need for improving education as well as mitigating environmental concerns in the upcoming year.\n\nGov. Gary Herbert-R opened his conference with the number one issue of education. Herbert noted improvements in Utah’s public schooling and said “we’ve seen, since I’ve been governor, our graduation rates improved by 9%,” and noted the ranking of Utah at 7th place in science scores, 10th in reading and 16th in math. The governor placed education alongside the economy, touting Utah’s strong fiscal conservation but stating that economic focus doesn’t work without good education.\n\nHerbert also emphasized the need to improve Utah’s air quality, and prepare Utah’s growing economy to meet environmental needs. The governor claimed that Utahns pollute less per person than the national average but that the inversion problem on the Wasatch front and the topographical conditions don’t do any favors to limit pollutants. Despite this, the governor claims confidence in the ability to appropriate funding to answer to the issue and place strong scientific research in a position to help mitigate the problem. Herbert said that the issue is improving and that the air will be “cleaner next year than this year.”\n\nHerbert’s press conference touched on these key issues as the state legislature prepares to begin voting on bills for this year’s legislative session. The focus on education and environment was interesting as Herbert recognized his successes as well as the work that still needs to be accomplished. Education came through as the most important priority, and Herbert cited the 160 new bills on education that were proposed in the previous year.\n\nGov. Herbert also touched on several other topics for the upcoming legislative session:"
