        "text": "Utah Centenarians - those who are 100 years and older - will be honored by Governor Gary Herbert on Thursday. Two of them hail from the Park City area. Leslie Thatcher has more.\n\nUtah currently has 176 centenarians – about half of them are expected to attend Thursday’s luncheon. The tradition started 32 years ago by Governor Norm Bangerter.\n\nThose who have turned 100 in the last year are welcomed into the Governor’s Century Club and those who are still able, will attend the annual luncheon.\n\nAccording to the state division of Aging and Adult Services, the number of Centenarians in the database peaked in 2010 when there were 156 on the list. Utah’s oldest person in the history of the Governor’s Century Club was Joe Begay, a Native American who lived on the reservation near Bluff. He passed away in 2001, just a few months shy of his 116th birthday. When he was 112, his children had to, quote, “take away his car keys” when they refused to let him continue to ride his horse.\n\nThe division has prepared a book of those Centenarians who submitted information about their lives, including where they were born and raised, their outstanding memories, favorite accomplishments, hobbies and activities and the impressive changes they’ve seen during their lifetimes. Some even share their secrets of longevity and best advice.\n\nMildred Stahle Asay is one of those whose biography is included in the publication. She was born in 1916 in Parley’s Park – known today as Snyderville. Some of her favorite memories include Park City’s 4th of July celebration when the children would march to the top of Main Street where they were each given a dime to spend. Even back then, there were races and games in the afternoon.\n\nMildred attended school for six years in a one-room school house in Snyderville. One teacher taught all eight grades. The younger children she remembers didn’t get much attention and spent most of their time looking at the trains go by, drawing on the blackboard and watching the older classes recite their lessons. When the Snyderville and Park City schools consolidated, she rode the bus to Park City, and graduated from Park city High School. Her best advice to living a long and happy life is to eat wholesome foods, exercise have a positive outlook and look for the good in others.\n\nBea Burnett who still lives in Park City was born in 1916. She is another who was invited to the luncheon. Unfortunately, her biography wasn’t included.\n\nYou can find all of the biographies here.\n\nHere are some of the Longevity Secrets shared by Utah Centenarians:\n\n“Laugh a lot! Laughing is one of the main reasons I have lived this long.”\n\n“Be prepared to receive the challenges of life with a positive attitude. Make good friends. Have financial security by saving. Start saving when you are young. Take very good care of your health.”\n\n“Chasing women, they keep you young! Good genes, my mother lived to be ninety-three; my dad lived to be ninety. Be kind and don’t sweat the small stuff.”\n\n“Not drinking alcohol, not smoking and no wild women.”\n\n“Loving and helping others.”\n\n“Good health, being active, playing sports. Don’t sit around, take care of yourself!”\n\n“Good genes. Healthy living. Luck!”\n\n“Wiggling is a family affair. Wiggling is easy and lots of fun. Every human being should move in order to sustain body and mental health. When you are elderly, just wiggle and sing childhood songs and then laugh; the result, a total feeling of well-being. Wiggling is an art and a science of keeping the body well, it’s fun and enjoyable…Don’t forget to give love, accept love and relax.”\n\n“Healthy food, exercise, a clear conscience, debt-free living, and a positive attitude.”\n\n“Eating healthy, exercise every day and do yard work.”\n\n“Hard work and eating meals with lots of vegetables; keeping busy and helping others.\n\n“Just breathe deeply and regularly.”"
