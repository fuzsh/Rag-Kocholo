        "text": "Utah Governor Gary R. Herbert grew up, raised a family, and worked in Orem, Utah. Governor Herbert has led Utah’s recovery from the Recession of 2008 to a position of national economic prominence. His unwavering focus on economic development includes attracting businesses and investments to the state while helping homegrown businesses flourish.\n\nA successful realtor and businessman, the governor saw firsthand how decisions made by public officials can impact the private enterprise. He decided to make a difference and serve as a Utah County Commissioner for 14 years, then Utah's Lieutenant Governor for four years, and then Utah Governor for 12 years. Herbert’s exceptional legislative and community experience to navigate the issues facing Utah Valley is unsurpassed.\n\nGovernor Herbert and his wife, Jeanette, are the proud parents of six children and 16 grandchildren."
