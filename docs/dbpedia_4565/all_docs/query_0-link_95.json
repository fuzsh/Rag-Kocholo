        "text": "Utah is Finally Increasing Access to Birth Control and Working to Close the Coverage Gap – I’m Thrilled!\n\nHaving grown up in Utah there are many things I love about my home state: mountains, the University of Utah (my alma mater), and red rocks. And now I get to add increased access to family planning services, including access to Long-Acting Reversible Contraceptives (LARCs) to the list!\n\nEarlier this week the Utah Legislature passed H.B. 12, which requires the state to create a Medicaid family planning program for those who make too much to qualify for Medicaid, but not enough to get health insurance through the Affordable Care Act’s marketplaces. Approximately 45,000 women in Utah fall in this coverage gap and are without insurance coverage, including coverage of birth control. H.B. 12 is a small but important step that would help to close the gap for birth control coverage by working to ensure Utahns have coverage of the high-quality family planning services Medicaid already covers such as birth control pills, LARCs, and sterilization services."
