        "text": "Gary Ralph Felker went home to God’s Glory Monday morning, November 14, 2016 at his home in Salt Lake City.\n\nGary was born January 27, 1944 in Roosevelt Utah the son of Ralph and LaVerna Schroeder Felker. Gary graduated from Provo High School and obtained his Bachelors and Masters degrees in Labor Economics from the University of Utah. Gary remained a Utah Man all of his life with his love for the football and basketball teams.\n\nGary met Kathryn Smith at the U and they were married February 3, 1968 in Salt Lake City. She was his right hand and partner for over 48 years.\n\nGary worked for the Utah Department of Workforce Services (formerly Job Service) and used his love of numbers and facts for 37 years. He served in a number of positions including management analyst and economic analyst. He served on several national committees for the U. S. Department of Labor. He was especially pleased that Gov. Jon Huntsman and Lt Gov. Gary Herbert both spoke at his retirement party.\n\nGary was an active member of First Baptist Church of Salt Lake City where he served on the Council of Ministries several times, Chair of the Child Care Center Board and several times on the Foundation Board. He served as the Moderator of the Utah Association of American Baptist Churches and the Board Chair of Camp Utaba where he was instrumental in getting the new cabins built at camp. He loved the people of First Baptist and would do anything asked of him from taking the youth on several trips to handing out turkeys to cook for the Thanksgiving Dinner. At the time of his death Gary was the President of the First Baptist Church Foundation and his last project was the Giving Tree that will grace the hall of the church."
