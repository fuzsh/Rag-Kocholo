        "text": "SALT LAKE CITY — Former Utah Republican Party Chair Derek Brown has formed an exploratory committee to run for Utah Attorney General.\n\nBrown, who also served in Utah’s House of Representatives from 2010 to 2014, made the announcement on Thursday.\n\nBrown served as the GOP Chair from 2019-2021. He is currently a partner with Lincoln Hill Partners.\n\nFormer Utah Gov. Gary Herbert will oversee Brown’s exploratory committee. Herbert appointed the current Utah Attorney General, Sean Reyes, to the position in 2013 when then-Attorney General John Swallow resigned after only a year in office.\n\n“Derek is well known for his commitment to conservative principles and his ability to inspire and unite,” Herbert said in a press release.\n\n“Few attorneys in Utah have his remarkable breadth and depth of experience in both law and government.”\n\nThe current Utah AG, Sean Reyes, is currently dealing with a call from state lawmakers to audit his office.\n\nThe audit request relates to Reyes’ alleged relationship with former Operation Underground Railroad CEO, Tim Ballard.\n\nBrown’s political experience\n\nAccording to the Utah Republican Party website, Brown is a constitutional attorney and served as senior legal advisor to three United States senators.\n\nHe served with Sen. Robert F. Bennett, R-Utah, as Chief Counsel in Washington D.C. Brown then moved to Utah to serve Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah.\n\nBrown left his position in the Utah legislature in 2014, after four years, to work for Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, as his Deputy Chief of Staff and Utah State Director.\n\nHe served as the chair of the Utah Republican Party from 2019 through 2021.\n\n“Our country is at a critical juncture, and we need to push back against the federal power grabs that are eroding our liberties,” Brown said in a press release.\n\n“Utah is known for its bold leadership and practical solutions, and I would be honored to advocate for Utah and work to preserve and uphold our constitution.”\n\nWhat’s in the future for Reyes?\n\nRumors have been floating that Reyes, might run for the U.S. Senate, and have been since Sen. Mitt Romney announced he wouldn’t seek reelection in September.\n\nThe day of Romney’s announcement, Reyes said he wouldn’t run for the Senate. Instead, he said he would seek reelection for his current position.\n\nDerek Brown is a former part-time talk host for KSL at Night.\n\nSimone Seikaly contributed."
