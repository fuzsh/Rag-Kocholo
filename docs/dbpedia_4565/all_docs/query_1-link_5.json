        "text": "Heber Manning Wells\n\nFirst Governor of the State of Utah from 1896–1905\n\nRepublican Party\n\nWhen Utah achieved statehood in 1896, 36-year-old Wells, a Salt Lake City native, became the first Governor of the State of Utah and the youngest governor to date. A former tax collector, city recorder, and secretary of the 1895 Utah Constitutional Convention, Wells was later involved in banking. He set up the machinery of state government for a smooth transition from territorial to state status and backed bills that affected education, agriculture, and the arts.\n\nGovernor Wells was born on August 11, 1859, and died on March 12, 1938.\n\nJohn Christopher Cutler\n\nSecond Governor of the State of Utah from 1905–1909\n\nRepublican Party\n\nBorn in Sheffield, England, Cutler immigrated to Utah with his family in 1864. A successful businessman and president of the family dry goods firm, he was also a director of several banks, insurance companies, and other businesses. As governor, Cutler founded a state juvenile court system, ordered compilation and codification of state laws, and provided for registration of births and deaths by the state.\n\nGovernor Cutler was born on February 5, 1846, and died on July 30, 1928.\n\nWilliam Spry\n\nThird Governor of the State of Utah from 1909–1917\n\nRepublican Party\n\nA native of Windsor, Berkshire, England, Spry came to Utah in 1875. After serving as a tax collector, Grantsville councilman, and a state legislator, Spry was appointed U.S. marshal for Utah in 1906.

He was also the second Jew elected governor of any state in the U.S. He earned a fortune in silver mining and railroading. A strong supporter of Prohibition, he promoted progressive reforms, including establishment of a Public Utilities Commission, Department of Health, and a nonpartisan judiciary.\n\nGovernor Bamberger was born on February 27, 1846, and died on October 6, 1926.\n\nCharles Rendell Mabey\n\nFifth Governor of the State of Utah from 1921–1925\n\nRepublican Party\n\nBorn in Bountiful, Utah, Mabey studied at the University of Utah and served in the Spanish American War and World War I. He was a banker and educator before serving as a state legislator and mayor of Bountiful. As Utah’s fifth governor, Mabey was a strong supporter of education.

He supported FDR’s Depression-Era programs and was able to obtain CCC and WPA projects for Utah. Dams and range improvements were high priorities during his administration. A 2-percent sales tax was adopted at his urging as a welfare measure. Blood was the first governor to occupy the Governor’s Mansion, donated by the Kearns family to the state in 1937.\n\nGovernor Blood was born on October 1, 1872, and died on June 19, 1942.\n\nHerbert Brown Maw\n\nEighth Governor of the State of Utah from 1941–1949\n\nDemocratic Party\n\nAn Ogden native, Maw served as an army chaplain during World War I before beginning a successful career as a university professor and attorney. Maw served 10 years in the Utah Senate and was its president during 1934–38. He fulfilled his campaign promise to reorganize state government to improve efficiency and economy. He also retired the state’s debt and helped to secure important military and defense facilities for the state during World War II.\n\nGovernor Maw was born on March 11, 1893 and died on November 17, 1990.\n\nJoseph Bracken Lee\n\nNinth Governor of the State of Utah from 1949–1957\n\nRepublican Party\n\nBorn in Price, Utah, Lee was involved in the real estate and the insurance business, and he served as mayor of Price during 1936–47. As governor, Lee gained national attention almost immediately because of his battle against the federal income tax and his ideas on economy in state government. Under his direction, Utah maintained its debt-free status while increasing appropriations for state building and highway construction that had been deferred during the Depression and World War II. He later served as Mayor of Salt Lake City during 1959–71.\n\nGovernor Lee was born on January 7, 1899, and died on October 20, 1996.\n\nGeorge Dewey Clyde\n\nTenth Governor of the State of Utah from 1957–1972\n\nRepublican Party\n\nBorn near Springville, Utah, Clyde became a recognized expert in water conservation and development.

As governor, Matheson zealously defended Utah’s rights against encroachment by federal agencies. Inflation, drought (and later flooding) proved fiscally challenging, and he cut state budgets and payrolls. Yet, he did secure increased funding for education, health, and highways. He returned to private law practice and became national chair of the Democratic Policy Commission.\n\nGovernor Matheson was born on January 8, 1929, and died on October 7, 1990.\n\nNorman Howard Bangerter\n\nThirteenth Governor of the State of Utah from 1985–1993\n\nRepublican Party\n\nBangerter, born in rural Salt Lake County, Utah, grew up in Granger (now West Valley City). He served in the U. S. Army in Korea, 1953–54. A successful real estate developer and businessman, he was elected to the Utah House of Representatives in 1974, eventually serving as Speaker of the House. As governor he launched an aggressive campaign to rebuild the state’s economy and to reduce the size and cost of state government. His three E’s—education, economic development, and efficiency in government—won national recognition for the state as a good place to live and do business. Later, the environment and court, prison, and building needs dominated his agenda.\n\nAfter his tenure as Governor, he returned to private business, and to an important LDS church assignment.\n\nGovernor Bangerter was born on January 4, 1933, and died on April 14, 2015.\n\nMichael Okerlund Leavitt\n\nFourteenth Governor of the State of Utah from 1993–2003\n\nRepublican Party\n\nBorn in Cedar City, Utah, Leavitt graduated from Southern Utah University, where he met Jacalyn Smith of Newton, who became his wife.

Leavitt is Utah’s second third term governor (Rampton was the first). Since his election as governor, he has led the state in an era of unprecedented economic prosperity. He has shown leadership on critical issues, including preserving Utah’s quality of life during a time of rapid growth, as well as creating better schools, fighting crime, redefining the relationship between states and federal governments, and taking advantage of the tools of advanced technology. The Governor’s Growth Summit created statewide involvement in improving transportation, preserving open space, and developing and conserving water. Under his tenure the state undertook an unprecedented 10-year, $3.6 billion, statewide road building initiative. The governor’s education initiatives included Centennial Schools, which return power to parents and teachers at local schools; special assistance to disadvantaged children; and class size reduction. Federal-state relations were brought to the top of the national agenda under his leadership. A national Federalism Summit addressed options for restoring a balance of power so that states and the federal government can operate more effectively. In technology, his Smart States initiative aims to develop public-private partnerships to deliver state services electronically. He has helped to attract and nurture high tech companies and encourage private commerce.

He has received numerous awards, including the American Medical Association’s Nation Davis Award, which recognized him as the public official of the year for his efforts to improve health care in Utah.
