        "text": "After more than 11 years in the Governor's Mansion, Gary R. Herbert — Utah's 17th governor — is reflecting on his life in public service.\n\nHerbert told 2News Anchor Mark Koelbel:\n\nI m grateful for all the good things we've been able to accomplish together and I want to emphasize together.\n\nHe added, \"I've been in office 30 years, six months in a few days when I pass the baton over to Spencer Cox.\"\n\nHerbert said the state is in good hands with his \"right-hand man\" who will fill his shoes.\n\n\"He knows what it takes. He's been involved in the arena, and every aspect of local government and state legislature now, Lt. Governor. So, he's up to speed on all this stuff we've been doing the last seven years.\" Herbert said.\n\nHe acknowledged that 2020 has been the hardest year he's experienced in elected office.\n\nLooking back at his last year, natural disasters, protests and the coronavirus pandemic have left the Utah County native humbled.\n\nWe said in the beginning, this is not about only protecting people's health. It's about protecting the economy, too. And we're going to do both.\n\nHerbert said he's positive as he looks to the future. As his final term winds down, it's on to the next chapter in the 73-year-old's life that includes returning to Utah Valley University where he'll start the Gary Herbert Institute for Public Policy.\n\nWhat about a future in politics in Washington? Herbert initially said he wouldn't \"go down to Washington,\" but added:\n\nWell, I guess they always say, never say never. Who knows... there's maybe some opportunity, but that's not something that I'm planning on right now.\n\nGOV. GARY HERBERT IN OFFICE"
