        "text": "On a fall day not that different from today, former Governor Jon Huntsman turned to newly sworn in Governor Gary Herbert at his inauguration ceremony and said, “I am turning over to you a great treasure. Your challenge is to improve its luster. I know you will thrive, my friend.”\n\nAnd without a doubt, Governor Herbert and Utah have thrived. We have led the nation in private sector job growth during much of his tenure as governor, the longest period of prosperity in our state’s history. Amidst this prosperity, many of us forget what Utah looked like in 2009 when the torch was passed to Governor Herbert. I know we like to mention national rankings and accolades (I will not say the word Forbes, I will not say the word Forbes…), but perhaps the most important legacy Governor Herbert will have left behind is the leadership he showed guiding the state through the greatest economic disaster since the Great Depression.\n\nIn an understatement typical of Governor Herbert, he said at that same 2009 inauguration, “These are times when storm clouds seem to be brewing.”\n\nThere was no such thing as “seem” in those 2009 storm clouds. That year the stock market had fallen off a cliff, losing 54 percent and trillions of dollars in value. Here at home in Utah, our unemployment had risen from 2.7% in 2007 to a staggering 7.3% in 2009 with no end in sight.\n\nTo make matters worse, the state had increased spending by more than 25 percent during the preceding four years leading Utah into a perfect storm of unsustainable spending and massive deficits.\n\nI doubt you could have chosen a worse time to become governor.\n\nBut Governor Herbert did what he has always done. He quietly got to work, and the results today speak for themselves. As Utahns, we are all fortunate to have been led by such a practical, humble leader during this pivotal time in our state’s history.\n\nToday is a new day with different challenges facing our state. With that comes a call for new vision and leadership to tackle these challenges. It’s time to pass the torch to a new generation of leaders willing to push the state to even greater heights.\n\nJust as Jon Huntsman’s Lieutenant Governor, Gary Herbert, was very different than he was, it should come as no surprise that I am different than the governor with whom I serve. And if I’m elected to be the next governor, the times in which we serve will be very different too.\n\nThe Utah of today is not mired in the depths of the Great Recession, but we should be energetically preparing for a possible economic downturn. Fortunately, over the past few years Utah has become the most diverse economy in the country. However, our Rainy Day Fund and Triple-A bond ratings must continue to be reinforced. If we are prepared, Utah will weather any economic headwinds of tomorrow far better than most.\n\nIn Utah, we must always be seeking ways to improve. For example, during the state’s current debate on tax reform one approach that must continue to be part of the discussion is a focus on finding areas of state government to make more efficient. That means a focus on reduced spending. A new administration is a perfect time to reorganize state government and find new savings.\n\nTo go one step further on this issue, if elected governor, I will not support any reform proposal that represents a tax increase on Utah businesses and families. There are imbalances within Utah’s budget system, but we can resolve this issue in a way that ultimately puts more money back in the pockets of everyday Utah families.\n\nAnother way to help stabilize our revenue situation is by reforming the way in which we conduct state incentives, and frankly stop giving so many of them. Earlier this summer, I posted my thoughts on the subject that I encourage you to read. No really, please read it. I believe in the power of free markets. Free market capitalism has done more to eradicate real poverty than any other socioeconomic system in the history of the world. Conversely, tax incentives inherently change the playing field in free markets and can lead to governments — not markets — picking winners and losers. We need to reform this system for the Utah of today and more importantly the Utah of tomorrow.\n\nThe history and nature of government is to expand and regulatory reform is one way to check unnecessary growth. Far too often rules are put in place to stifle competition and innovation. Even worse, unnecessary and overburdensome licensing requirements hurt everyday Utahns, especially those that are unemployed or underemployed. In 2011 Governor Herbert ordered a review of Utah’s regulatory code and modified or eliminated more than 300 outmoded rules on business. It’s time to do it again.\n\nFiscal matters are only a piece of the overall solution to Utah’s pressing problems. In the coming months, I will continue to outline the policy areas I believe are most important to the future of the state of Utah. Think air quality (every day you should be able to walk out your front door and take a big breath of fresh air just like I do in Fairview), education (imagine a state system where the highest paid public education employee in every school is a teacher), transportation (let’s begin by calculating the true costs of gridlock and lost worker productivity), housing affordability (in rural Utah we export our children because they can’t find a job, along the Wasatch Front we are exporting our children because they can’t afford a home). And the list goes on and on.\n\nThe solutions will always involve a dogged persistence to fiscal restraint and common sense. But not only that. We need to turn our gaze upwards and think bigger. Now is the time for Utah — emergent, vivacious, and confident — to become not only the Crossroads of the West, but a preeminent global hub of commerce and culture.\n\nAs we build on all the good that’s come before us, we have many opportunities that a state is lucky to see even once in a generation. For instance, look at the Point of the Mountain, Utah Lake, and a new international airport, and imagine what we can do together.\n\nJust as in 2009, it is once again time for new and bold leadership in Utah; for audacious ideas that lift our state upward for many decades to come. We cannot afford to pursue only half measures. And yes that means a few moonshots too. I invite you to share with me your ideas for the future of Utah. The bigger the better.\n\nSend your thoughts to Spencer@votecox.com"
