        "text": "Countywide Economic Development Planning - We believe that countywide proactive planning is critical to guide our future economic development. We design our plans to anticipate change, overcome obstacles, and seize economic opportunities.\n\nUnity and Action - We are united throughout the County to a common vision of our economic future which supports the uniqueness of our various cities.\n\nImpact and Influence - We strive to influence city and county economic development decisions, as well as regional and state economic and educational policies and programs with our vision and plans. Robust Employment Opportunities - We seek to increase family-sustaining employment opportunities for our residents and those who commute into our County.\n\nExpanding Economic Growth - We seek to develop and expand our economic base by attracting targeted businesses and industries that conform with our community values; by expanding our current employers, expanding supply chain management, and by creating high-growth start-up businesses.\n\nQuality of Life - We believe that our quality of life contributes directly to economic development by ensuring that within our County there is affordable housing, excellent education, quality health care, improving systems of transportation, broadly accessible internet services, preserved open space and recreational and cultural opportunities\n\nCities of Davis County\n\nIn all, there are 15 cities that make up Davis County. Whether they are small or large it takes all of them to be successful. Davis County has a great working relationship with all the cities administration, mayor’s and councils. We work hand in hand to retain, expand and recruit businesses to our area. All the cities have taken the slowdown in the economy as time to review building and zoning ordinances, general plans and business park plats. This has prepared everyone for a fast track to future growth and development. Davis County is where you will find connections.\n\nU.S. News and World Report Rankings\n\nFor a list of agency links, see the State of Utah Agencies List. For people new to the state of Utah, see the Newcomers Guide, which is a list of useful links for newcomers of the state. To see tourism links see the State of Utah's Travel & Tourism landing page. For business links see Starting a Business, Relocating a Business, Running a Business, and Business Resource Centers at www.utah.gov.\n\nTaxes\n\nThe State Income Tax Rate is 4.65%. The State of Utah, Counties and Cities all pride themselves on having one of the lowest tax structures in the United States. The tax structure splits sales tax, personal and real property taxes between all taxing entities. In some communities there are special service districts and Recreation/Arts/Parks/Zoo taxes. These are usually sales tax or special levies for a given area. As a whole, Davis County is a little lower in local taxes than surrounding communities. This shows a stable and fiscally responsible local government.\n\nGovernor Herbert said it best, “Governments role is to stay off of businesses backs and out of their wallets.” We at Davis County agree with his statement."
