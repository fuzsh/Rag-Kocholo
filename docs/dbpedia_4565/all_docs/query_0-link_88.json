        "text": "Utah Lt. Gov. Greg Bell announced Monday he’s stepping down after four years in office, saying it’s time to take care of his family’s long-term financial future.\n\nThe 64-year-old Ogden native took office Sept. 1, 2009 and also served as a state senator for Utah’s 22nd Senate District in Davis County after being elected in 2006.\n\nHe says he intends to return to the private sector.\n\n\"Serving the people of Utah as Lt. Governor has truly been an honor,” writes Bell in a news release issued Monday. “The uniquely collegial and collaborative partnership with Governor Herbert has been a privilege. It's difficult to leave a post as substantive and dynamic as this, and I have enjoyed every minute. It's simply time to take care of my family's long-term financial needs.\"\n\nGov. Gary Herbert said Bell has worked hard in his role and sacrificed much during his 23 years in public service.\n\n\"I have valued Lt. Governor Bell's loyalty as my partner and friend,” said Herbert. “He is a true statesman, a man of principle, integrity and resolve. And he has been key to our ongoing success, particularly on the education front.\"\n\nBell, a Republican, will stay on until the governor names, and the state senate confirms, a replacement. Bell is a past mayor and city councilman of Farmington, past chair of Envision Utah, and past president of the Farmington Bay District of the Boy Scouts of America. He and his wife, JoLynn, reside in Fruit Heights and are the parents of six children and 20 grandchildren.\n\nThe responsibilities for Lt. Gov. include financial disclosures, elections, Notary Public Office, Political Action Committee and Native American Summit.\n\nAccording to the website Utahsright.com, Bell earns a base salary of $104,405 and a gross compensation of $143,961.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\n\nQuick Facts About Lt. Gov. Bell:"
