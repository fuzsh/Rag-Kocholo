        "text": "Gov. Gary R. Herbert announces the selection of Brig. Gen. Michael J. Turley to serve as the adjutant general of the Utah National Guard. Turley will replace current Adjutant General, Maj. Gen. Jeff Burton, who is set to retire on Nov. 7.\n\nTurley, a West Jordan resident, enlisted as a United States Marine in 1985 and was commissioned a U.S. Army Engineer Officer in 1997 after graduating from Army Officer Candidate School. His most recent assignment was commander, 204th Maneuver Enhancement Brigade. Prior to this assignment, he was deputy director, Joint Training and Exercises Directorate-J7 and Chief-Joint Resources and Readiness Division-J74, NORAD and U.S. Northern Command. He was also a U.S. Army War College Fellow in Residence, National Security Affairs Fellow at the Hoover Institution- Stanford University for the academic years 2016 - 2017.\n\nHerbert praised Turley as an accomplished and principled leader with 34 years of experience in service.\n\n“Brig. Gen. Michael Turley’s years of service have prepared him well to lead the Utah National Guard,” said Gov. Herbert. “I am so grateful to Maj. Gen. Jeff Burton for his service and leadership. He has served our state with great honor, and we will miss him. As he retires, I know that Brig. Gen. Michael Turley will be a terrific leader for our guardsmen and women. I look forward to working with him.”\n\n“It’s an honor and very humbling to be selected for this position, following in the footsteps of Maj. Gen. Burton,” said Turley. “It’s such a great organization and Burton has done an amazing job. I feel a great sense of responsibility for the Utah National Guard. As humbling as it is to accept this position, I am also excited for the future of the Utah National Guard and to work with these Soldiers and Airmen who consistently perform above expectations.”\n\nBurton has served as adjutant general since September 2012. During his seven years as adjutant general, Burton reached out and cared for those in uniform. He expressed his confidence in Turley to carry on the legacy that is the Utah National Guard.\n\n“I’m really excited about my replacement, Brig. Gen. Mike Turley, he is the right man for this job and will carry on the great traditions of the Utah National Guard,” said Burton. “I can’t think of a better person the governor could have selected for this role.”\n\nBurton’s retirement will immediately follow the change-of-command ceremony on Nov. 7. Additional information on the change of command and retirement will be forthcoming.\n\n“My service in uniform has been the absolute joy of my life,” Burton said. “It’s been the greatest thing I’ve ever done. It’s painful to leave, but I think we know instinctively when it’s time to go, and so for me that time is now. I go with a lot of sadness in my heart leaving the people of the Utah National Guard. I think it’s the people that I’ll miss the most.”\n\nThe adjutant general is the commanding general of the Utah National Guard and is appointed by the governor who is the Utah National Guard’s commander in chief."
