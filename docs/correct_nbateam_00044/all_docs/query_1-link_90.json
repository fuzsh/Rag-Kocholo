From the Indy Star: “The Indiana Pacers have let go of scouts Brian Winters, Leonard Perry and Joe Ash in a cost-cutting move because of the NBA’s current lockout. Winters is a former NBA and WNBA coach. He scouted Paul George, the No. 10 pick in the 2010 draft, while George was at Fresno State. Ash spent eight years with the Pacers, including part of the time as director of scouting. Perry joined the Pacers as an assistant coach for Rick Carlisle in 2006.”"
