        "text": "Seeing another Spurs team go deep into the playoffs is familiar and yet utterly jarring—much like death itself. The Grizzlies, depending on your vantage point, are either a parade of redemption narratives or a bunch of unrepentant ass-busters. The Heat, you probably know about them.\n\nThat leaves the Indiana Pacers, pride and joy of the state that didn’t invent basketball but for some reason acts like it did. Last year, they gave the Heat some problems in the second round. This time around, the Pacers are a deeper, more studied team. They also are every bit as obscure, something that no NBA team deserves. Especially one with All-Stars, fun facts, and prime position to imprint itself upon the national consciousness.\n\nD.J. Augustin: Point guard Augustin played at Texas, where he went from the guy who wouldn’t pass to Kevin Durant to one of the college game’s premier players. He was drafted by the Bobcats, who in 2012 offered him a second contract and then changed their minds about it.\n\nPaul George: George might be your favorite player by the end of this week. He defends up to four positions, leads Indiana’s scoring attack, and is kind of like that prototypical 2002 swingman upgraded into something useful. Versatile and sublime. You cannot top this!\n\nDanny Granger: Granger will not be playing in this series, as he sat all but five games of 2012-13 with a knee problem. He is a decorated veteran who has represented Team USA in international competition. Paul George is a lot more fun and Granger will probably end up on the Spurs some day. He is an extremely smart guy who got into Yale on the strength of his grades. Granger is also a Jehovah’s Witness. FUN FACT.\n\nGerald Green: Green won the Sprite Slam Dunk Contest in 2007 but is best known for his 2008 showing. Having been moved in the off-season, Green defended his title in the uniform of a new team, which was kind of sad and unthinkable, even if there’s no reason a Dunk Contest champ would be untouchable for that very reason (if anything, it’s the opposite these days). Green blew out a candle on a cupcake while dunking the ball. He was robbed. He might have been blowing out the candle on his career ... if not for finally sticking in Indy.\n\nTyler Hansbrough: Hansbrough got stuck with the nickname \"Psycho T\" while at UNC, where he played for 35 years and did fairly little that warranted this spine-tingling moniker. The Pacers drafted him in 2009 when, ahem, they seemed to want to draft a lot of white people because they had gotten into some problems with Stephen Jackson, who happened to be black. At the time, that joke hadn’t gotten old yet, either. It jumped the shark with Hansbrough and the organization changed course. Hansbrough gets uncomfortable when he is too close to the basket for any reason.\n\nBen Hansbrough: Ben is Tyler’s brother. It would be easy to dismiss his presence as favoritism being shown toward Hansbrough—still—except the two grow closer every day. I mean that in terms of quality of play and, like, in how they feel about each other. We wish them well. May the experiment, and the healing, continue.\n\nRoy Hibbert: The big guy at the center position who, when he’s on, can make a legitimate claim to being the league’s best seven-footer. Gloss over that sentence, though, because Hibbert’s main selling point is his hoopster-friendly resume. He almost wore a monocle to a press conference. He used a hashtag as a piece of actual language in a press conference. And he appeared multiples times on_ Parks and Recreation_. The question is, why hasn’t Entertainment 720 returned from the dead to help Hibbert and the Pacers address their branding issues?\n\nGeorge Hill: An outstanding discovery by the San Antonio Spurs, Hill belongs on the Pacers, having played his college ball at tiny Vowel State in Indiana. The Spurs traded him after Hill exceeded all expectations and then failed to live up to the sky-high expectations he had created for himself. In Indiana, he has found inner peace, meaning he is allowed to be exceptional only as the spirit moves him. In this way, he is strongly representative of what’s best, worst, and oh-so-charming about this mysterious team.\n\nOrlando Johnson: I had to look him up on Wikipedia. He has a truly wrenching life story that will doubtless be a halftime segment.\n\nIan Mahinmi: Another Spurs discovery gone wrong! Mahinmi actually never got a chance to prove himself one way or the other in San Antonio, but he was an intriguing prospect that Dallas was more than willing to invest in. That didn’t lead to much. Then he was traded this season for Darren Collison, which really had more to do with getting rid of Collison than getting Mahinmi. And yet still...possibility abounds. The Pacers are purgatory. Happy purgatory.\n\nJeff Pendergraph: Pendergraph will foul someone in the playoffs at a crucial time. It will be the right thing to do.\n\nMiles Plumlee: Like Hansbrough, Plumlee was an ACC standout—at Duke, not UNC, which is why he was a less inspiring player and has amounted to less as a pro. Like Hansbrough, he has a brother destined to play in the NBA. I think you see where this one is going. The Pacers could launch an outstanding web series about the four of them attempting to get an oil tanker across the Crimean sea during high tide and be guaranteed some hefty memorabilia sales.\n\nLance Stephenson: The new Latrell Sprewell, except times have changed and now it’s NOT wearing glasses that marks Stephenson as an athlete with an inner life.\n\nDavid West: Wait, what? He’s on the Pacers, too? West was a star with the Hornets. Since arriving in Indiana, West’s numbers have taken a hit and his stature has diminished. Yet again, though, here’s a sleeping giant buried in plain sight on Indiana’s roster. It’s like Indiana has so much talent it has to pretend it has less talent or else there would be too much talent and things would go wrong. The balance is careful. If they seem tentative at times, it’s because the Pacers always must save themselves from themselves.\n\nSam Young: Just a really strong dude who was born to be a veteran. Made more sense on Memphis.\n\nBethlehem Shoals is a writer living in Portland, OR. He is the co-author of two books about basketball. Follow him on Twitter at @freedarko** **"
