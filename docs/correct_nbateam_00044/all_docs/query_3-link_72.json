        "text": "North Carolina's Tyler Hansbrough and Kansas State's Michael Beasley were unanimous selections to The Associated Press' All-America team Monday. For the first time, no senior was chosen.\n\nBeasley and Kevin Love of UCLA made it two straight years there were two freshmen chosen. Sophomore D.J. Augustin of Texas and junior Chris Douglas-Roberts rounded out the selections, shutting out the seniors.\n\nThe AP started choosing All-America teams after the 1947-48 season, and for the next six decades there was at least one member of the senior class on every first team.\n\nUntil this group.\n\nHansbrough, a junior and the Atlantic Coast Conference player of the year, and Beasley, the Big 12 player of the year and third freshman to lead the country in rebounding, were named on all 72 ballots and received 360 points from the same national media panel that selects the weekly Top 25. The voting was done before the NCAA tournament.\n\n\"To be one of just two players in the country to receive such an honor is very humbling,\" said Beasley, who led Kansas State to its first NCAA bid since 1996. \"I have never been about individual accomplishments, but about helping my team win games. I wish we were still playing, but I am happy with the success we had this season.\"\n\nThe 6-foot-10 Beasley averaged 26.5 points and 12.4 rebounds for the Wildcats, shooting 53.5 percent from the field including 38.9 percent from 3-point range. He is Kansas State's first All-America since Bob Boozer in 1959.\n\nHansbrough, a second-team selection last season, compiled impressive numbers (23.0 points, 10.4 rebounds) and lived up to his \"Psycho T\" nickname while leading the Tar Heels to a school-record 36 wins and their 17th Final Four. The last North Carolina player to be picked to the first team was Joseph Forte in 2001.\n\nThe 6-foot Augustin was named on 66 ballots and had 346 points. He directed the Longhorns to the regional final, averaging 19.8 points and 5.7 assists in 37.2 minutes.\n\nThe 6-10 Love led the Bruins to their third straight Final Four appearance, averaging a double-double in their tournament run after getting 17.1 points and 10.6 rebounds and shooting 55.7 percent in the regular season.\n\nLove received 52 first-team votes and 318 points to become UCLA's second All-America in as many seasons as Arron Afflalo was chosen last year. Love said he followed Beasley closely this season.\n\nDouglas-Roberts, the third member of the All-America team playing in the Final Four, had 52 first-team votes and 309 points.\n\nNotre Dame sophomore center Luke Harangody was sixth in the voting with 211 points, and he was joined on the second team by seniors Shan Foster of Vanderbilt, D.J. White of Indiana and Roy Hibbert of Georgetown, and college basketball's newest star, Davidson sophomore guard Stephen Curry."
