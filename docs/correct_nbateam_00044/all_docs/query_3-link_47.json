        "text": "Tyler Hansbrough, who became one of the most decorated Tar Heels ever during his four years in Chapel Hill, is now the 14th Tar Heel to be inducted into the National Collegiate Basketball Hall of Fame.\n\nPlaying from 2005 through 2009 under head coach Roy Williams (also a member of the Hall), Hansbrough became the only player in ACC history to be named first team All-ACC and first team All-America four times. He was named the unanimous 2008 National Player of the Year and holds the all-time ACC scoring record and the all-time NCAA free throws made record.\n\n“I’m honored to be getting inducted into the College Basketball Hall of Fame,” said Hansbrough. “Choosing to play at North Carolina was one of the smartest decisions I’ve made. I had the greatest teammates at UNC and want to thank them. I also played for the best coaching staff in college basketball, and I thank Coach Williams and his staff.”\n\nCarolina accrued a 120-22 record in Hansbrough’s four seasons, capped off by a win in the 2009 national championship against Michigan State. Hansbrough’s Tar Heels also won three ACC regular-season titles, two ACC Tournaments, earned three No. 1 seeds and appeared in back-to-back Final Fours in 2008 and 2009. Hansbrough simultaneously held Carolina’s all-time scoring and rebounding records until last season, when Armando Bacot broke the latter. Hansbrough’s No. 50 jersey is one of just eight retired by the men’s basketball program.\n\n“I am thrilled for Tyler Hansbrough and his family,” said Williams. “This award is well deserved and comes strictly from effort, hard work and talent. Tyler was one of the most unique players I ever coached, and I never coached anyone that gave more than he did. He tried to be the absolute best he could possibly be in every phase of the game and gave tremendous effort every day. I loved coaching the young man and really look forward to seeing him receive this honor.”\n\nIronically, Hansbrough will be inducted on August 30 in Chicago along with former Duke head coach Mike Krzyzewski. Former Blue Devil Johnny Dawkins is also part of the Class of 2023.\n\nFeatured image via Todd Melet\n\nChapelboro.com does not charge subscription fees, and you can directly support our efforts in local journalism here.
