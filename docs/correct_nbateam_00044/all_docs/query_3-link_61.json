        "text": "SPRINGFIELD, Mo. (KFVS) - Former Poplar Bluff basketball standout Tyler Hansbrough was inducted into the Missouri Sports Hall of Fame on Sunday.\n\nAccording to a release from the Poplar Bluff School District, Hansbrough became the school system’s fourth inductee into the hall of fame.\n\nDuring his career with the Mules, Hansbrough amassed over 2,500 points along with Missouri Player of the Year and All-American honors. His dominance led to multiple State Championships with Poplar Bluff.\n\nThat continued into his play collegiately at North Carolina.\n\nAfter winning ACC Rookie of the Year as a freshman, Hansbrough was a three-time first team All-American the next three seasons, including National College Player of the Year as a junior. He was also a major factor in the Tar Heels’ run to the National Championship during his senior season.\n\nDrafted in the 1st Round of the 2009 NBA Draft, Hansbrough played seven seasons in the NBA.\n\nThrough it all, Hansbrough says the honor of being inducted into the Missouri Sports Hall of Fame has a lot to do with his hometown.\n\n“There’s a lot of people who helped me get to where I am in my basketball life and just in life, so there’s a lot of important people,” said Hansbrough. “Even though my name’s attached to it this represents all of Poplar Bluff and the people who’ve helped me.”\n\nIn the Sports Hall of Fame, Hansbrough of the PBHS Class of 2005 joins Derland Moore of the New Orleans Saints and Eddie Moss of the St. Louis Football Cardinals and later the Washington Redskins, each of whom played Mules Varsity Football in the mid-1960s.\n\nMost recently, the Mules Boys Golf program was inducted, having earned six state championships through the 1990s."
