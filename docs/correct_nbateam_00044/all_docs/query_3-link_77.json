        "text": "CHARLOTTE, N.C. - The Charlotte Hornets have signed free agent power forward Tyler Hansbrough.\n\nTerms of the deal were not released during Wednesday's announcement.\n\nThe 29-year-old Hansbrough spent the past two seasons with Toronto after four with Indiana.\n\nHis best season was 2010-11, when he averaged 11 points and 5.2 rebounds and started a career-high 29 games. His playing time and production have decreased each of the past four seasons. He averaged 3.6 points and 3.6 rebounds per game in 2014-15 for the Raptors.\n\nHornets general manager Rich Cho says in a release the 6-foot-9, 250-pound Hansbrough \"brings energy and physicality every time he steps on the floor.\"\n\nCody Zeller is expected to start at power forward for Charlotte. Hansbrough is likely to battle for playing time with first-round draft pick Frank Kaminsky.\n\nSilver could see a female head coach\n\nNEWARK, N.J. - Adam Silver says he \"couldn't be prouder\" of Becky Hammon for leading the Spurs to the Summer League title and has \"no doubt\" the NBA could someday have a female head coach.\n\nThe NBA commissioner said Wednesday he had texted and emailed with Hammon while they were in Las Vegas, where she coached the Spurs to the championship Monday night. He praised the San Antonio organization for hiring her last season as the first full-time female assistant in the NBA and putting her in charge of its entry in the Vegas league.\n\nSilver adds that you \"couldn't ask for more of a complete package\" than Hammon, a former WNBA star who had been hired by Spurs coach Gregg Popovich before ending her playing career in San Antonio.\n\nPlayoff format could be changed\n\nNEWARK, N.J. - Adam Silver says the NBA is leaning toward not guaranteeing a playoff spot to a team that wins its division.\n\nSilver said Wednesday no decision has been made, but he believes it's likely that teams will qualify for the postseason only if they have one of the top eight records in their conference.\n\nDivision winners are currently guaranteed no worse than the No. 4 seed, though that's expected to be changed before next season. Portland got that spot in the Western Conference last season by winning the Northwest Division, but the Trail Blazers would have been seeded sixth by win-loss record.\n\nSilver was speaking before taking part in a panel discussion at the \"Beyond Sport United\" program. He says no team has won its division without a top eight record, and league officials estimate there's less than a 5 percent chance it could happen.\n\nMagic to play Raptors in London\n\nLONDON - The NBA says the Orlando Magic and Toronto Raptors will play a regular-season game in London on Jan. 14.\n\nIt will be the sixth league game played at the O2 Arena in the British capital. Before 2011, games in London were only exhibitions.\n\nMagic coach Scott Skiles says \"I remember playing in London with the Magic in 1993 and I am sure our current players will relish this unique opportunity.\""
