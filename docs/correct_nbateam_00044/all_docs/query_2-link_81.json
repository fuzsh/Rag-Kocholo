        "text": "June 13, 2013\n\nBIRMINGHAM, Ala. ----- For the second year in a row, former North Carolina All-American and current Indiana Pacer Tyler Hansbrough paid a visit to the camp of UAB head men's basketball coach Jerod Haase on Thursday. Hansbrough spent time with campers, fielding questions from the young players as well as doing a short interview session with local media.\n\nThe former Tar Heel great talked to campers about various topics, including the time he spent going to camps as a young boy.\n\n\"When Coach Haase asked me to come, it was pretty much a no-brainer for me to come down here,\" Hansbrough said. \"I used to come to camps like this all the time when I was a kid. I used to get real excited when guest speakers would come by and talk with me. To come out here and talk with these kids is pretty cool.\"\n\nHansbrough, who is the Atlantic Coast Conference's all-time leading scorer with 2,872 career points, was a four-time All-American at North Carolina, and is the only player in ACC history to earn that honor on four occassions. Hansbrough was the 2007-08 National Player of the Year and just finished his fourth season with the Indiana Pacers.&nbsp;\n\nThe 6-foot-9, 250-pound forward/center attributes much of his success to Haase, who was on Roy Williams' staff at North Carolina from 2003-2012, and who is now heading into his second season as the head coach of the Blazers.&nbsp;\n\n\"Coach Haase did a great job at North Carolina,\" Hansbrough said. \"He was pretty much a player development guy and did a lot of work with us individually. I think he is a great coach and will bring a lot to this program.\""
