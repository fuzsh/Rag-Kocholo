        "text": "Former Indiana Pacers Tyler Hansbrough is expected to sign a deal in the Chinese League, a source told Sportando. It’s still unclear at this point for which team Hansbrough will play. The big man finished last season in D-League with Fort Wayne Mad Ants.\n\nMore on Tyler Hansbrough Free Agency\n\nJorge Sierra: NBA veteran Tyler Hansbrough has a new agent.\n\nhttp://twitter.com/hoopshype/status/867864567627612161\n\nCharlotte Hornets General Manager Rich Cho announced today that the team has signed free agent forward Tyler Hansbrough. Per team policy, terms of the deal were not disclosed. “Tyler Hansbrough is a solid NBA player who can contribute to our team,” Cho said. “He brings energy and physicality every time he steps on the floor. We are glad to have him.”\n\nStoryline: Tyler Hansbrough Free Agency\n\nIn a pregame media availability on Friday, Cheryl Miller ripped the league’s record new broadcast rights package and the negotiators who put it together. Miller called for a number four-times higher than the reported $2.2 billion over 11 years that the WNBA reportedly will receive starting in 2025. The new deal could be as much as six-times higher than the current deal struck in 2016. “I’m not great with numbers,” Miller told reporters in Phoenix. “That’s a lowball.”\n\nIn the USC legend and longtime basketball voice’s view, the NBA and its broadcast partners undervalued the WNBA in negotiations. “We certainly have come a long way, and I’m not about gauging, but it’s a long time overdue,” Miller said. “Women’s basketball is in a great place right now.” The NBA negotiated the new deals on behalf of the WNBA, as they have with each package since the women’s league was created nearly three decades ago."
