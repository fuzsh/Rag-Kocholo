        "text": "For almost two seasons now, David West has been the anchor, the backbone of the Pacers. He’s the lead-by-example veteran the team has needed.\n\nWest gets injured, heads to the sidelines, Tyler Hansbrough steps in, has two good games and all of sudden some people are saying West should come off the bench when he returns.\n\nAre you serious? Is that an early April Fools Day joke?\n\nI thought people were really joking about it when they mentioned it during and after the Cleveland game. But a few people brought it up again after Hansbrough had 14 points and 14 rebounds in Tuesday’s victory over Orlando.\n\nPut a stop to it. There’s no way in hell it’s going to happen. There’s no way in hell it should happen.\n\nHow quickly some people forget, it wasn’t that long ago that Hansbrough was struggling so bad that an argument could be made that Jeff Pendergraph should back up West at power forward.\n\nHansbrough knows his role on the team. Back up West when he’s healthy. Step in and start when he’s out the lineup. Hansbrough said it after Monday’s game and he repeated after Tuesday’s game.\n\nThe key with Hansbrough is learning how to be just as effective during shorter minutes while coming off the bench. That’s been the key with him ever since he moved to the bench after West signed prior to the start of the 2011-12 season.\n\nMaybe these games in the starting lineup will help Hansbrough when he goes back to the bench once West returns from his back injury."
