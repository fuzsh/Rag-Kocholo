        "text": "The Toronto Raptors are set to add another power forward to the roster.\n\nThe Raptors have agreed to terms on a two-year deal with former Indiana Pacers forward Tyler Hansbrough, Sportsnet.ca can confirm. The deal consists of $3 million per year with the second year being a club option.\n\nThe Raptors will use a portion of the mid-level exception to complete the deal.\n\nHansbrough averaged 7.0 points, 4.6 rebounds in 81 games with the Indiana Pacers last season. After reaching an agreement with David West, the Pacers pulled their offer off the table, making Hansbrough an unrestricted free agent forward.\n\nThe discussions were first reported by Yahoo! Sports Marc J. Spears.\n\nAfter agreeing to a trade with the Knicks to move Andrea Bargnani to New York, the Raptors lacked depth up front behind Amir Johnson and Jonas Valanciunas so Hansbrough would be a logical addition to the team.\n\nHansbrough spent four seasons with the Pacers organization after the club selected him with the No. 13 pick in the 2009 NBA Draft.\n\nThe Raptors have already come to terms with free agent point guard Julyan Stone and are expected to officially trade Bargnani to the New York Knicks after July 10."
