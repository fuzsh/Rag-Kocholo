Vote below and help decide the greatest Indiana Pacers power forward of all time!\n\nBirthplace : Columbia, South Carolina, USA\n\nNationality : United States of America\n\nTeam : Boston Celtics\n\nPosition : Power forward, Center\n\nIndiana Pacers: 2000–2008\n\nA force to be reckoned with, Jermaine O'Neal joined the Indiana Pacers in 2000 as a result of a trade with the Portland Trail Blazers. Known for his exceptional shot-blocking and mid-range shooting abilities, O'Neal quickly became a key player, earning six consecutive NBA All-Star selections from 2002-2007. Throughout his tenure with the Pacers, he racked up numerous personal accolades, including the NBA's Most Improved Player Award in 2002 and was instrumental in propelling the team to the playoffs multiple times.\n\nBirthplace : Kaunas, Lithuania\n\nNationality : Lithuania\n\nTeam : Sacramento Kings\n\nPosition : Power forward\n\nIndiana Pacers: 2017-2022\n\nSon of legendary Arvydas Sabonis, Domantas Sabonis joined the Pacers in 2017 as part of a trade with the Oklahoma City Thunder. Known for his blue-collar work ethic and relentless pursuit on the glass, Sabonis has become a fan-favorite in Indiana. As a two-time NBA All-Star (2020, 2021), he has arguably become one of the best passing big men in the league, elevating the play of those around him and making the Pacers a formidable opponent.\n\nBirthplace : Indianapolis, Indiana\n\nNationality : United States of America\n\nTeam : Philadelphia 76ers\n\nPosition : Power forward\n\nIndiana Pacers: 1971–1975, 1979–1982\n\nOne of the most storied players in Pacers history, George McGinnis began his professional career in the ABA, where he won two championships with Indiana before making the jump to the NBA in 1975. A versatile and explosive scorer, McGinnis dazzled fans with his ability to dominate both inside the paint and from the perimeter. As a six-time NBA/ABA All-Star and the 1975 ABA MVP, McGinnis left an indelible mark on the Pacers organization and the basketball world at large.\n\nBirthplace : Toccoa, Georgia\n\nNationality : United States of America\n\nPosition : Power forward, Center\n\nIndiana Pacers: 1991–2000, 2004–2005\n\nDrafted by the Pacers in 1991, Dale Davis spent nearly a decade in Indiana, where he became synonymous with bruising rebounding and fearsome interior defense. A one-time NBA All-Star (2000), Davis was known for his ability to outmuscle opponents on the glass and finish with authority around the rim. His contributions to the team's success helped propel the Pacers to five Eastern Conference Finals appearances and their first-ever NBA Finals in 2000.\n\nBirthplace : Leverkusen, Germany\n\nNationality : German\n\nTeam : Portland Trail Blazers, Dallas Mavericks, Indiana Pacers, Seattle Supersonics\n\nPosition : Small forward\n\nIndiana Pacers: 1988–1993\n\nThe German-born sharpshooter, Detlef Schrempf, was acquired by the Pacers in a trade with the Dallas Mavericks in 1989. With the ability to stretch the floor and knock down jumpers from beyond the arc, Schrempf became a valuable offensive weapon for Indiana. Earning the NBA's Sixth Man of the Year award in both 1991 and 1992, he played an instrumental role in the Pacers' rise to prominence in the early 1990s.\n\nBirthplace : Teaneck, New Jersey\n\nNationality : American\n\nTeam : New Orleans Pelicans, Indiana Pacers, Golden State Warriors\n\nPosition : Power forward\n\nIndiana Pacers: 2011–2015\n\nSigning with Indiana in 2011, David West provided the Pacers with much-needed scoring and an unwavering veteran presence. Known for his mid-range shooting ability and fundamentally sound post moves, West helped guide the team to back-to-back Eastern Conference Finals appearances in 2013 and 2014. His leadership on and off the court played a crucial role in the development of the young core that would shape the Pacers' future."
