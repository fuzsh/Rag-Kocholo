        "text": "THE `BURBS - Just when you thought the only significant news coming out of the Pacers media day Friday was Tyler Hansbrough's indefinite absence, the team sends out a release saying coach Jim O'Brien was getting a one-year contract extension.\n\n\"I think it's great,\" O'Brien said. \"I think making sure there's continuity when trying to build toward a champion is important. I appreciate it.\"\n\nO'Brien, who is just 72-92 in two seasons with the Pacers, no longer has to worry about being a lame-duck coach this season.\n\nThe Pacers did the same thing with Rick Carlisle prior to the 2006-07 season. They announced Carlisle's extension during the team's media day. Everybody knows Carlisle didn't make it to his extension year because he was fired after a 35-47 season.\n\nThe Pacers better hope history doesn't repeat itself.\n\nWhat do you think of the Pacers giving O'Brien an extension?\n\n***********************\n\nIt's understandable if you're already worried about how healthy Hansbrough will be this season.\n\nThe Pacers shut Hansbrough down at the end of July so he could rest his shin. Now they're saying the highly-energetic player is out indefinitely.\n\n\"Certainly we would hope to have him toward the beginning of the season,\" O'Brien said. \"We think that would be the best-case scenario. There are different levels that he has to achieve on a weekly basis in order to take that next step. He has improved dramatically since it was diagnosed. If it continues to improve like that he'll have full season we hope.\"\n\nDo you believe this is a short-term injury or are you worried this could be something that lingers throughout the season.\n\n************\n\n--ESPN.com's Marc Stein unveiled his first power rankings\n\nof the season Friday. Close your eyes if you don't like bad news. He has the Pacers 24th in the league."
