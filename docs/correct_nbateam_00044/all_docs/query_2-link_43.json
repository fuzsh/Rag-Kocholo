        "text": "PHOENIX — Long before he became head coach of the Phoenix Suns, Frank Vogel was an energetic assistant with the Indiana Pacers charged with developing the organization’s youth.\n\nWith Indiana rebuilding through the NBA Draft, head coach Jim O’Brien divided the roster. The six least experienced players had to report to practice 30 minutes early for developmental sessions. Vogel ran them.\n\nOften, O’Brien and team president Larry Bird would watch from the side as the six played 3-on-3 and learned the nuances of O’Brien’s offensive and defensive principles. In a recent interview, O’Brien said Bird might have had an eye on more than just the players.\n\n“I think Larry was getting a really good understanding that Frank had a great touch with younger guys,” O’Brien said. “He was a good teacher and understood both sides of the basketball, just really in-depth.”\n\nVogel, who turns 50 on Wednesday, has worked in the NBA for two decades. He has coached a rebuilding (and awful) team in Orlando and won a championship with LeBron James and the Lakers, but his coaching foundation was formed in Indiana, first as an assistant, then as a head coach for five-plus seasons when he twice led the Pacers to the Eastern Conference finals.\n\nFormer Indiana players describe the defensive-minded Vogel as a strong motivator and communicator, skills that should help him connect with a veteran Suns team that includes stars such as Devin Booker, Kevin Durant and recently acquired Bradley Beal. By the time Vogel replaced O’Brien during the 2010-11 season and took over permanently the next season, the Pacers were positioned to contend. In Phoenix, he’ll be expected to take the Suns from contenders to champions.\n\nGO DEEPER\n\nBradley Beal trade thoughts: On Isiah Thomas, NBA super teams and Chris Paul\n\nAaron McKie noticed Vogel’s value from the time he spent with him in Philadelphia. In 2004, Vogel worked on O’Brien’s staff on a 76ers team that included Allen Iverson, Andre Iguodala and Chris Webber. In his 11th season, McKie was a veteran on his way out of the league, but he noticed the then-31-year-old Vogel all the same.\n\n“I watch guys and see how they operate and see if they’re consistent with their behavior, that’s how you earn your respect,’’ McKie said. “And he was one of those guys that came in and was the same guy every day.”\n\nAs an assistant with the Pacers, Vogel worked extensively with Danny Granger and Roy Hibbert. In 2007, Granger, a rangy 6-foot-9 forward, was in his third season. He had averaged 7.5 and 13.9 points his first two years, respectively, flashing stardom, but he needed work. Vogel pretty much became his developmental coach.\n\nOn flights after road contests, Vogel would sit next to Granger and go through video of Granger’s performance. During workouts, Granger often found himself trying to match Vogel’s energy. “Come on, DG, let’s go.” During his second season, Granger had turned into more of a spot-up shooter, so Vogel drilled him on creating off the bounce, getting to his spots, becoming a complete scorer. He told Granger that he needed to work the offensive boards, get out on the break, get to the foul line. Mix it up.\n\n“He really helped me take an approach to the game so that when I looked up, man, I had 28 points,” said Granger, who became an NBA All-Star in his fourth season. “And I’m like, ‘Ah, OK.’”\n\nHibbert, a 7-2 center out of Georgetown, was among those who worked with Vogel during the pre-practice sessions. Under previous coach Rick Carlisle, the Pacers had run a structured offense that relied heavily on set plays. O’Brien said that, when he took over, Indiana lacked the talent to make that work over 48 minutes, so he switched to a style similar to what the Sacramento Kings had run with Webber and center Vlade Divac.\n\nBefore practice, Vogel put Hibbert, a skilled passer, at the elbow and let teammates play off him. “It was anything that you could do from a 3-on-3 standpoint, which is everything in the game of basketball,’’ O’Brien said. “Basketball is really about triangles. Everything that could be taught 5-on-5 could be taught 3-on-3. That was kind of Frank’s canvas to execute what he and I and the staff had talked about.”\n\nVogel also worked with Hibbert over the offseason. He put the big man in 2-on-1 situations and forced him to make defensive decisions. He taught Hibbert how to position himself as a shot blocker. If, say, LeBron attacked with the ball tucked against his body the odds of Hibbert blocking the shot without fouling were slim, so Vogel drilled the 7-footer to jump straight up. However, if a guard penetrated and got loose with the ball, extending it from his body, Hibbert was free to swat away.\n\n“Just doing that over and over and over with Frank,’’ Hibbert said. “I couldn’t leave the gym without getting four stops in a row. In a 2-on-1 situation, sometimes I was cussing Frank out in my head during the workout, but it got the best out of me.”\n\nGO DEEPER\n\nZach Harper's NBA Mock Draft: Picks, biggest needs, trade expectations\n\nOn Jan. 30, 2011, with the Pacers headed for a fifth losing season, Bird called O’Brien into his office and told him he was making a change. O’Brien, starting to feel burned out under a heavy rebuild, understood.\n\n“All right, what’s on your mind?” he asked Bird. “Who are you going to turn over the reins to?”\n\nBird wanted Vogel, but he wasn’t sure Vogel would take the position. Vogel and O’Brien were tight, going back to when both worked for Rick Pitino at the University of Kentucky. O’Brien had taught Vogel how to study and evaluate film. And along with Pitino, he had helped Vogel get his NBA start with the Boston Celtics.\n\n“Bull—-,” O’Brien said. “Let’s get him on the phone.”\n\nBird put Vogel on speakerphone. O’Brien spoke.\n\n“Frank, I’m here with Larry,’’ O’Brien recalled saying. “Before you say anything, he’s going to make a coaching change and he wants you to take over. I know you’re going to be loyal, and your initial reaction will be, ‘How can I do this?’ But I 100 percent, whole-heartedly think this is a great opportunity. Don’t worry about hurting my feelings because you’re not.”\n\nWith Vogel in place as interim head coach, the Pacers won seven of their next eight games. He changed the offense, emphasizing the post game, but he also brought a different approach. O’Brien had an old-school directness. He once called a struggling Granger into his office and told him that Bird had just questioned why O’Brien continued to start him each night. Granger was so upset he called his agent. The agent’s advice: Get with Frank.\n\n“We were kind of underperforming, but then Vogel came in and it just kind of rejuvenated everybody’s spirit,’’ said Tyler Hansbrough, a forward who played with Indiana from 2009-2013. “We started getting encouraged and we got confidence. We started getting on a little run.”\n\n“Honestly, Coach Vogel is one of the most genuine, nicest people in the world,’’ said Jeff Ayres, a forward who played with Indiana from 2011 to 2013. “He’s so positive, like really positive. Guys will be in slumps or whatever, and he’s one of the first people to pick them up. Like, ‘It’s going to balance out. Don’t worry about it, just keep doing things the right way.’”\n\nThe positivity wasn’t for everyone, but the Pacers made the playoffs as a No. 8 seed in 2011, losing to the Chicago Bulls in the first round. It was enough for Bird to lift Vogel’s interim tag. With strong defense, an emerging Paul George, and the signing of David West, the Pacers kept improving. In 2012, they lost to LeBron and the Miami Heat in the Eastern Conference semifinals. The next two seasons, they lost to the Heat in the conference finals.\n\nGranger recalled Vogel telling the Pacers: “Sometimes players, you’re selfishly motivated. You want your contract, you’re in a contract year, somebody else is making more money than you. But if we win, everybody’s going to win. Everybody. Averaging 28 points on a bad team is nothing. Averaging 17 on a team that goes to the (NBA) Finals is better.”\n\nThe NBA, however, changes quickly. Granger injured his knee and was never the same. In 2014, Indiana traded him to Philadelphia. Granger was in his Indianapolis condo when the news broke. Twenty minutes later, he heard a knock at the door. It was Vogel.\n\n“He just gave me a hug,” Granger said. “He said, ‘I’m so sorry, man.’ My wife was crying. He said he had to come over. It just shows the type of dude he is.”\n\nHibbert, his playing time reduced after opponents went to shorter, quicker lineups, also left. A two-time All-Star and once one of the league’s top defenders, he was dealt to the Lakers in 2015 for a second-round draft pick. On his way out, Hibbert said he looked forward to playing for Byron Scott, a coach who had actually played in the NBA. Some took it as a shot at Vogel.\n\n“Any type of divorce is rough, but we’ve talked it over so many times,” Hibbert said. “We were at (former Indiana point guard) George Hill’s wedding and we talked things over. Leave things in the past. I had a good time while I was there. It is what it is. The NBA changed. I always say, ‘Luckily, I was there and I got the time that I had while I was there.’ But whatever negative feelings I’ve had about the divorce is all in the past.”\n\nHow Vogel’s Indiana experience translates to the Phoenix Suns likely depends on the stars he inherits. A good coach makes a difference, but the NBA is a player’s league, and with Booker, Durant and Beal, the Suns have a “Big 3” that may be offensively unmatched. The question: How will they adjust to Vogel’s defensive approach?\n\n“Your best players have to buy in,’’ said former guard Tony Delk, who was around Vogel at Kentucky and later when Vogel was getting his start with the Boston Celtics. “Your two or three best players have to want to play defense. When those two or three guys are playing it, everybody else is going to fall in line.”\n\n“(Defense) is one thing you can control,” said former guard Shelvin Mack, who played for Vogel in Orlando. “He did a great job from training camp on of having a plan and a process, and eventually you’ll see the big picture. Just being physical. Being in the right place at the right time. And he does it in a way that I think will be very beneficial with the Phoenix Suns, being able to show it on film and not always banging your body up on-court.”\n\nAfter reaching the Eastern Conference finals for the second time in 2014, Vogel lasted two more seasons with Indiana before Bird decided the Pacers needed a change. Vogel coached a bad Orlando team for two seasons, took a year off, then joined the Lakers as head coach. During the abbreviated 2020 bubble season, Vogel led LeBron and Anthony Davis to an NBA title. The next two seasons he went 42-30 and 33-49, respectively, and lost his job. Expectations can be brutal.\n\nGO DEEPER\n\nWhat Frank Vogel's hire means to the Phoenix Suns: 8 thoughts\n\nIn Phoenix, that part will not change. Vogel will work for an ambitious owner in Mat Ishbia and an organization that’s gone 55 years without a championship. Fans here are beyond restless. With so much star power, they expect a parade. It will be on Vogel to make it work.\n\n“If you go through Frank’s resume, he’s coached some of the all-time greats,’’ said former guard Travis Diener, who played with the Pacers during Vogel’s time as an assistant. “To do that, you obviously have to develop a relationship with them. There’s a lot of egos in play, and there’s a lot of money in play, and I think he’s done a great job with that.”\n\n“Dude, you got KD and Devin Booker, you don’t got to do much,’’ Granger said before Phoenix acquired Beal. “Just get out of these dudes’ way, motivate them and put them in positions to show their out-of-world talent. And Frank can do that. He can manage that and not micromanage.”\n\nO’Brien said the Suns will warm up quickly to Vogel. They will appreciate his basketball knowledge and preparation, whether it be for a game, practice or drill. They also will be drawn to his personality and see that his positivity is genuine. He will hold everyone accountable and he will expect to win.\n\n“Jack Ramsay said once that every player he had ever come into contact with wants organization and discipline,” said O’Brien, referring to the Hall of Fame basketball coach. “And I think they do. But when that organization and discipline and plan comes from a guy that really is ultra-respectful to other human beings, it’s a great combination.”\n\nRelated reading\n\nDoug Haller: How the Suns decided on Frank Vogel\n\nJohn Hollinger: Bradley Beal trade defines overboard era for Wizards and Suns\n\nZach Harper: Bradley Beal trade grades — Instant reaction as Suns form a new big 3 in Phoenix\n\n(Top photo of Vogel with the Pacers, during the 2013 Eastern Conference finals: Ronald Martinez / Getty Images)"
