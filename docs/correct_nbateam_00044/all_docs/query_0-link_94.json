        "text": "Tyler Hansbrough is an incumbent disappointing lottery pick for the Indiana Pacers. Ben Hansbrough is a fringe NBA player picked up by the Pacers due to injuries. Ben and Tyler were on the court together Wednesday night when Cavaliers big man Tristan Thompson hit Psycho B in the head with an elbow during a loose ball battle. And then we realized letting Psycho T play with his brother was a bad idea, as evidenced in the video above.\n\nI will now withdraw my standing request that the Clippers sign Taylor Griffin."
