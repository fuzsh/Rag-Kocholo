        "text": "The Pacers' newest additions will wear No. 0 (Tyrese Haliburton), 11 (Tristan Thompson) and 24 (Buddy Hield).\n\nHere is a look at the best player to wear each number for the Pacers. (A player can only be selected at one number; basketball-reference.com is the source.)\n\n00\n\nAaron Brooks: Yes, 00 is a lower number than 0 so we start with the only 00 in Pacers’ history. Brooks was something of a disappointment in 2016-17, shooting 37.5 percent on 3-pointers and averaged a career-low 5.0 points with 1.9 assists, his lowest output since his rookie season.\n\n0\n\nC.J. Miles: Miles provided three productive seasons, filling whatever role the Pacers needed — starter, reserve, off-guard, small forward, power forward. He averaged 12.0 points on 37.4 percent 3-point shooting, becoming a rare free agent bargain.\n\n1\n\nLance Stephenson: Stephen Jackson (16.6 points per game, 169 games) has an argument but we’re going with Lance. True, he's also worn No. 6 but one of the all-time fan favorites should be No. 1 on this list.\n\n2\n\nDarren Collison: In four seasons with the Pacers, Collison averaged 11.9 points per game. Collison had, arguably, the two worst seasons of his career in his first stop in Indiana but he led the NBA in 3-point shooting in 2017-18 and and averaged 11.8 points and 5.7 assists in a second two-year run. He's better than his competition: Rodney Stuckey and Earl Watson.\n\n3\n\nGeorge Hill: It's a close call with four seasons of Al Harrington's first stop with the Pacers (11.7 points, 5.9 rebounds) but Hill averaged 12.3 points and 3.9 assists in five seasons in his hometown, starting on the back-to-back Eastern Conference finals teams. He left a portion of the fan base wanting more but he was a solid offensive performer at either guard spot and an excellent defensive player. Focus on what he did and he's earned the No. 3 jersey.\n\n4\n\nVictor Oladipo: It didn't end well but he certainly has earned his place on this list. After arriving following a widely-panned trade for Paul George, he led a resurgence of the franchise. Oladipo averaged over 23 points per game earning his first All-Star nod along with being named the Most Improved Player in the NBA. He earned a second All-Star berth, though a knee injury ended his season and -- effectively -- his Pacers career. Travis Best was an important player for some of the best Pacers teams in history but Oladipo gets the nod.\n\n5\n\nJalen Rose: He was the best player on the 2000 NBA Finals team and captures how the Pacers built their successful run in the late-'90s and early-'00s: Shrewd trades. Using basketball-reference.com's Win Shares (an effort to capture a player's contributions in one number), here is a look at what the Pacers added and surrendered in dealing for Rose and then trading him away.\n\nPacers received: Rose 25.4, Mark Jackson 20.1, Ron Artest 19.3, Brad Miller 13.5, Chris Mullin 13.4, Kevin Ollie 1.6, Ron Mercer 1.2, Erick Dampier .9 and Reggie WIlliams -.1. Total: 95.3.\n\nPacers traded: Dampier 18.3, Rose 6.0, Jackson 4.0, Travis Best 1.4, Lonny Baxter 1.1, Ricky Pierce .9, Efthimi Rentzias .2, Norm Richardson .1, Vincent Askew -.1. Total: 31.9.\n\nRose was an easy choice, with T.J. Ford and Sam Mitchell the next best players to wear No. 5.\n\n6\n\nCory Joseph: He bumps off Marquis Daniels. Joseph wasn't flashy — 7.2 points, 3.5 assists, 3.3 rebounds — and his shooting slumped in 2018-19 but he was an excellent defensive player and capable point guard.\n\n7\n\nJermaine O'Neal: An All-Star six times in his eight seasons, O'Neal is one of the easiest selections on this list. During those six All-Star seasons, O'Neal averaged 20.4 points, 9.9 rebounds and 2.4 blocks. Because of injury and suspension, he played in more than 51 games once in his final four seasons but the Pacers were able to deal him to Toronto for the draft pick that would become Roy Hibbert (and spare parts). The runner-up is Malcolm Brogdon.\n\n8\n\nMickey Johnson: A difficult call over Anthony Johnson, who was a solid reserve/fill-in starting point guard for four seasons. Mickey Johnson had one spectacular season, averaging 19.1 points, 8.3 rebounds, 4.2 assists and 1.9 steals for a 37-45 Pacers team in 1979-80. The Pacers had to send Ricky Sobers to the Bulls after signing Johnson as a \"free\" agent. According to a Chicago Tribune story, the Pacers were concerned the NBA would assign Alex English and the team's 1980 first-round pick as compensation if the teams couldn't agree to terms. Mickey Johnson was traded after his one season for George Johnson (and a second-round pick) — a solid (10.4 points, 5.7 rebounds) reserve big man — which might have something to do with the same Tribune article saying Mickey Johnson \"led the National Basketball Association in pouting last season.\" Justin Holiday also deserves a mention for his production wearing No. 8 for the Pacers.\n\n9\n\nDerrick McKey: It’s not a coincidence the Pacers’ run of Eastern Conference finals appearances in the mid-1990s started when they traded for McKey (for free agent-to-be Detlef Schrempf). McKey's scoring dipped with the Pacers (12.3 ppg his first three years after averaging 15.1 his final five seasons in Seattle) but that's likely simply because he just did whatever a team needed to win. McKey continued to demonstrate he could rebound (5.0), create (3.7 assists) and guard nearly every position on the court at 6-9, 205 pounds. He was a key figure for the ’94 and ’95 teams that reached the conference finals and a role player from 1998-2000.\n\n10\n\nVern Fleming: At a time the Pacers couldn't count on much, they knew Fleming would score 14 points, dish out six assists and grab four rebounds. As the Pacers got better, Fleming's playing time declined but it coincided with his getting older and he was a solid reserve on the Eastern Conference finals team in 1994. He's the choice over Jeff Foster, another gritty, underrated long-time Pacer.\n\n11\n\nDetlef Schrempf: Schrempf was the eighth overall pick in the 1985 draft by the Dallas Mavericks and provided solid, versatile production off the bench but never got the opportunity to do more. The Pacers gave him that chance. In one of the best deals in franchise history, the Pacers sent aging Herb Williams to Dallas for Schrempf and a second round draft pick that would become Antonio Davis. Schrempf provided immediate dividends, averaging 14.8 points in 32 games in 1988-89 and then continuing to improve, winning Sixth Man of the Year awards in 1990 and '91 and earning an All-Star berth in 1993.\n\nSchrempf and Domantas Sabonis are remarkable players, right down to spending time coming off the bench. Schrempf averaged 17.0 points, 8.6 rebounds and 4.1 assists in 354 games with the Pacers. Sabonis was 16.3, 10.5 and 4.2, earning two All-Star berths. We'll go with Schrempf but Billy Keller, a member of the Pacers' three ABA champions and a local legend at Washington High School, has a strong argument too.\n\n12\n\nButch Carter: He had three productive seasons in Indiana, averaging 5.9 points as a reserve in 1981-82, 10.5 and earning some starts in 1982-83 and 13.4 as a primary starter in 1983-84. His final season he added 2.8 assists and 1.8 steals. Carter held the NBA record for points in an overtime period for many years, scoring 14 on March 20, 1984 versus the eventual NBA champion Boston Celtics. Earl Boykins (15 in 2005) and Gilbert Arenas (16 in 2006) have since broken it but Carter is tied for third with Dirk Nowitzki and Russell Westbrook.\n\n13\n\nKevin Seraphin: Kidding, of course. Will the Pacers eventually retire Paul George's number? If they do, which one? The Pacers have high standards for retired numbers as each was a long-time member of the franchise and elected to the Hall of Fame. George, you may have heard, forced his way out of Indianapolis after seven seasons. The hard feelings will likely fade over the years and if he can maintain his current level of performance, he'll have a Hall of Fame case. If that happens, retiring his number is a possibility. But he had his most success wearing No. 24. Mark Jackson is a worthy No. 13 too.\n\n14\n\nFreddie Lewis: After a season as Oscar Robertson's backup in Cincinnati in 1966, Lewis was selected by San Diego in the NBA expansion draft but instead signed with the Pacers in the ABA and became the franchise's greatest point guard. He was an ABA All-Star his first season with the club, averaging 20.6 points, 5.8 rebounds and 2.4 assists, and had career marks of 16.1 points and 4.0 assists in eight seasons with the Pacers. He was a member of all three championship clubs, winning the playoff MVP award in 1972. Ricky Sobers and Jerry Sichting also wore No. 14 for the Pacers.\n\n15\n\nRon Artest: Artest wore No. 15 his first two seasons with the Pacers. He wasn't as productive as he was in Nos. 23 and 91 but it was also pre-brawl and the competition at No. 15 is not strong. During an interview on ESPN's \"Highly Questionable\" show, World Peace called his time with the Pacers \"one of the biggest regrets of his life.\"\n\n“I was jealous of Jermaine O’Neal’s contract,” he said. “I felt like I was a top-tier player, but I felt like the Pacers didn’t treat me like that. It was all about me. It was too much ego. Everything was about me. When I don’t get what I want, I felt like I was entitled and I lashed out.”\n\nRon Anderson is probably the next best No. 15, though some may prefer Warren Jabali.\n\n16\n\nJohnny Davis: In 1978, the Indiana Pacers held the No. 1 overall pick in the draft. If Larry Bird had committed to leave Indiana State, he could have been an Indiana Pacer. But Bird, a draft-eligible junior under rules that have since changed, choose to return to school. The Pacers dealt the No. 1 pick to Portland for the No. 3 pick (Rick Robey, who, coincidentally, was traded to the Celtics later that season for Billy Knight) and Davis. Boston, of course, took Bird with the No. 6 pick and signed him after Indiana State reached the national championship game.\n\nDavis was a solid contributor at point guard during his four seasons, averaging 16.4 points and 5.4 assists, and helping the franchise reach the playoffs in the NBA for the first time in 1981. Peja Stojakovic is the only other Pacer to wear No. 16.\n\n17\n\nChris Mullin: He will always be a Golden State Warrior first but don't discount his three seasons with the Pacers. He averaged 11.3 and 10.1 points per game his two seasons as a starter, then graciously stepped into a reserve role when Jalen Rose was promoted to the starting lineup. The result was a trip to the NBA Finals. Mullin played more postseason games with the Pacers (38), than he did with Golden State (33) and holds Indiana franchise records for 3-point percentage (.465 in 1998-99) and free-throw percentage (.939 in '97-98). His sweet stroke — .472, .441, .912 — was made for Indiana. Mike Dunleavy is also a strong candidate.\n\n19\n\nJim Thomas: He wore it for one season but it was his best (and he's the only Pacer to wear 19) after the Pacers made him a second-round pick out of IU. He averaged 11.1 points for the 1984-85 Pacers as a starting shooting guard, chipping in 3.3 rebounds and 2.9 assists.\n\n20\n\nDarnell Hillman: Mention Darnell Hillman and the first thing to come to mind is his afro.\n\n“After being in the Army I hated having to have my head bald, and when I got out I saw Angela Davis who was wearing a beautiful afro, and decided I wanted one just like it,” Hillman told nba.com. “So I grew it out, and it just kept on growing. To keep it how I wanted it I had to brush it at least seven times a day. But\" \"I was very proud of it, and it was definitely the best around, and it was certainly bigger than a basketball.”\n\nBut to remember Hillman simply for his hair is a disservice. He was a key piece of some deep, talented Pacer front lines in the ABA years, focusing on blocks and rebounds. He peaked in 1974-75, averaging 13.9 points, 9.2 rebounds and 1.6 blocks. For his six-year career in Indiana, Hillman averaged 10.6 points, 8.4 rebounds and 1.5 blocks. Fred Jones gets the nod as the second-best No. 20 for the Pacers.\n\n21\n\nDavid West: West's leadership was a major factor in Indiana returning to the NBA’s elite teams in 2013 and ’14. He was a power forward who could score — inside or as a mid-range shooter — when needed but was fine playing defense and rebounding if that’s what the team needed. He was also an underrated playmaker (2.8 assists per game).\n\nFormer IndyStar Pacers beat writer Candace Buckner describes him:\n\n\"(He had) the reputation of being a fully grown man. He plays like a throwback post player — all butt and body, bruising opponents on the block — and when it's on, his jump shot from the elbow can be counted for two points as soon as it leaves his hand.\"\n\nThad Young is No. 2 among 21s.\n\n22\n\nAlex English: In fairness to the Pacers, no one anticipated Alex English blossoming into a Hall of Famer. He averaged 7.7 points per game in his first two seasons with Milwaukee, and the Pacers surrendered a first-round pick when they signed him as a free agent in 1978. English rewarded the investment, averaging 15.6 points, 7.7 rebounds and 3.1 assists in 135 games. But he was traded for the end of George McGinnis' career and averaged 26.1 points per game in 11 seasons with the Nuggets, earning eight All-Star berths and making the Hall of Fame in 1997. Caris LeVert is the second-best No. 22, averaging 19.6 points in 74 games.\n\n23\n\nWayman Tisdale: Ron Artest was at his best and worst wearing No. 23 but we'll recognize Tisdale at No. 23. The Pacers lost the coin flip for the first pick, landing Tisdale instead of Patrick Ewing. There have been few more decorated college players than Tisdale, a three-time AP first team All-American at Oklahoma and member of the gold medal-winning 1984 U.S. national team.\n\nTisdale was effective for the Pacers, averaging 15.2 points and 6.4 rebounds in three-plus seasons. He eventually played 12 seasons in the NBA and became an accomplished jazz musician, recording eight albums. He died May 16, 2009 due to cancer at the age of 44.\n\n24\n\nBob Netolicky: Yes, we should probably recognize Paul George here but since he's at No. 13, we're going to include an all-time great Pacer. Netolicky was a consistent double-double threat in the early ABA years, averaging 18.0 points and 10.2 rebounds while making the All-Star team his first four seasons. He returned to the Pacers in 1973-74 and had two solid seasons as a reserve. Rik Smits wore No. 24 at the beginning of his career as well.\n\n25\n\nBilly Knight: Knight averaged 23.8 points, 8.4 rebounds and 3.0 assists in his first three seasons, finishing second to Julius Erving in scoring in the final season of the ABA (28.1) and then runner-up to Pete Maravich in Knight's first NBA season (26.6). He was traded to Buffalo for Adrian Dantley and Mike Bantom. Knight hurt his knee and, while still effective, wasn't the same player. His scoring average dropping from 23.6 points per game his first four seasons to 14.4 over the next four, including another stint with the Pacers.\n\n26\n\nTom Owens: The Pacers needed a big man in 1981. At least they thought they did. They went 44-38 in 1980-81 to make the playoffs in the NBA for the first time but lost James Edwards to free agency. To maintain their success, the Pacers traded their 1984 first-round draft pick to Portland for Owens, a 32-year-old big man. He averaged just 10.6 points and 5.8 rebounds the previous season and, not surprisingly, averaged 10.5 points and 5.0 rebounds for a Pacers team that went 35-47. They then fell to 20-62 and that draft pick became No. 2 overall in 1984. A coin flip determined who got the No. 1 selection, with Houston prevailing and Portland getting the second pick. Houston took Hakeem Olajuwon and the Blazers took Sam Bowie. Of course, the Bulls selected Michael Jordan No. 3. We could give this spot to Jeremy Lamb but the Owens story needs to be told.\n\n27\n\nJordan Hill: Signed when the Pacers were trying to acquire every active NBA player named Hill — they succeeded, already having George and Solomon — Jordan Hill was a serviceable big man, providing 8.8 points and 6.2 rebounds in 73 games. If you prefer longevity, Duane Ferrell is the choice.\n\n28\n\nIan Mahinmi: He was an excellent backup center for three seasons (4.3 points, 4.2 rebounds, 0.8 blocks) then exceed expectations when he replaced Roy Hibbert as the starter in 2015-16, averaging 9.3 points, 7.1 rebounds and 1.1 blocks. Kiefer Sykes and Leandro Barbosa are the only other Pacer to wear 28.\n\n29\n\nJeff Pendergraph: He changed his name to Jeff Ayers before the 2013-14 season after two years in Indianapolis. He was a deep reserve — 57 games, 3.1 points, 2.4 rebounds in two seasons — and the only Pacer to wear No. 29.\n\n30\n\nGeorge McGinnis. McGinnis averaged 29.8 points, 14.3 rebounds, 6.3 assists and 2.6 steals per game in 1974-75. No one else in basketball history has approached that kind of season. And it was hardly a fluke. From his second to fourth seasons, McGinnis averaged 27.7 points, 13.9 rebounds, 4.0 assists and 2.0 steals. And he was no ABA creation. He then joined the Philadelphia 76ers and averaged 23 points, 12.6 rebounds, 4.7 assists and 2.6 steals. McGinnis was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Hall of Fame in September. No one wore No. 30 after 1980 and it has been retired.\n\n• DOYEL: Was George McGinnis actually better at football?\n\n31\n\nReggie Miller: Miller is synonymous with the Indiana Pacers. He made his name against the Knicks at Madison Square Garden in the mid-'90s: scoring 25 points in the fourth quarter of Game 5 of the 1994 Eastern Conference finals, the famous eight points in 8.9 seconds in Game 1 of the 1995 conference semifinals, and the 34 points — 17 in the fourth quarter — to clinch the franchise's lone NBA Finals appearance in 2000.\n\n\"He knew it was a big stage, he flat-out knew it,\" Pacers executive Donnie Walsh told IndyStar prior to Miller's induction into the Hall of Fame in 2012. \"Unlike a lot of players, Reggie was looking for that big stage. He wanted it. It was Madison Square Garden and nationally televised games.\"\n\nRunner-up is Granville Waiters solely for appearing in game footage used in the \"Spenser: For Hire\" television pilot.\n\n32\n\nDale Davis: He never averaged more than 11.7 points per game but he also never averaged less than 1.0 blocks or 7.8 rebounds. Think of those teams and Reggie Miller, Jalen Rose, Rik Smits, even Mark Jackson come to mind. But it was Dale Davis — and Antonio Davis — who allowed the Pacers' stars to flourish, even as Pat Riley and the New York Knicks were turning the East into a nightly bar fight. It's a productive number with Dan Roundfield, Herb Williams and Al Harrington (in 2007) are among those who wore the number.\n\n33\n\nDanny Granger: He fell to the Pacers at No. 17 in the 2005 draft, quickly providing a building block — and hope — to a franchise trying to recover from the brawl. Granger far exceeded expectations, making an All-Star team, winning the NBA's Most Improved Player Award and posting back-to-back seasons with more than 24 points per game. He then seamlessly integrated Paul George into the lineup, sacrificing statistics for team success. The sub-.500 team Granger joined was able to challenge the Miami Heat in the conference semifinals in 2012. Antonio Davis and Clark Kellogg also wore 33, with Myles Turner a contender to take the number away from Granger if he continues to develop.\n\n34\n\nMel Daniels: Daniels joined the Pacers in 1968 after they posted a losing record in their first season. The Pacers would win at least 44 games each of his six seasons, with three ABA titles, a runner-up finish and two other appearances in the Division finals. Daniels averaged 19.4 points, 16.0 rebounds and 1.6 blocks in his six seasons. He was named league MVP during his first season in Indiana and won the honor again in 1971. He retired as the ABA's all-time leading rebounder with 9,494, had his No. 34 jersey retired by the Pacers on Nov. 2, 1985 and was elected into the Naismith Hall of Fame by the ABA Committee in 2012.\n\n• FROM THE ARCHIVES: 'Mel was the hero'\n\n35\n\nRoger Brown: In his first five seasons, he averaged 20.6 points, 7.2 rebounds and 4.5 assists. The only players to top those numbers in ABA/NBA history: Oscar Robertson, George McGinnis, Grant Hill and Larry Bird.\n\n“The Pacers were the class of the league, and Roger was the class of the class,” Julius Erving said in a documentary about Brown by former IndyStar editor Ted Green.\n\nBROWN: City remembers Pacers great by sending 84-year-old woman to HOF\n\n37\n\nAmida Brimah: How do you get on this list after just 5 games and 13 total points? By being the only Pacer to wear the number, of course.\n\n40\n\nJames Edwards: He was a potent starting center for the Pacers, averaging 15.9 points, 7.5 rebounds and 1.3 blocks in four seasons. He helped the Pacers reach the playoffs in 1980-81 then received a free agent contract from Cleveland for more than $600,000 per year. As noted in the Tom Owens write-up, that led to Indiana trading away the pick that could have landed Michael Jordan. But don't blame Edwards. Instead, appreciate his production while he was here. Steve Stipanovich (the Pacers drafted him instead of Ralph Sampson after losing a coin flip) is the runner-up at No. 40.\n\n41\n\nLen Elmore: A poor shooter for a post player (41.0 percent in his career), Elmore had an impressive season in 1975-76 with the Pacers — 14.6 points, 10.8 rebounds, 2.3 blocks, 1.8 steals — and was a rotation player for four other seasons. LaSalle Thompson is the runner-up.\n\n42\n\nMike Bantom: Bantom was a regular for the often-bleak post-ABA Pacers, averaging 13.7 points, 6.6 rebounds and 3.0 assists per game in four-plus seasons, also serving as the team's captain.\n\n43\n\nEarl Tatum: He came to the Pacers with James Edwards in exchange for Adrian Dantley and was a contributor in 57 games, averaging 14.4 points and 4.0 rebounds in 1977-78. The Pacers traded him to Boston after the season for a first-round draft pick that became Carl Nicks, who played point guard for Larry Bird's Indiana State team and is currently a scout with the Pacers.\n\n44\n\nBojan Bogdanovic: One of the best free-agent signings in Pacers history, emerging into a full-fledged threat in two seasons in Indiana. He averaged 16.1 points on 41.3% 3-point shooting but hit career-highs in points (18.0), rebounds (4.1), assists (2.0), field goal percentage (.497) and 3-point percentage (.425). Bogdanovic knocks off Austin Croshere\n\n45\n\nRik Smits: Smits made a single All-Star team (in 1998), never averaged 20 points or even 8.0 rebounds a game. But he was a key figure in the best sustained run of success by the franchise in its NBA history, often raising his level of play in the playoffs. At his best, Smits could be counted on for 15 or more points, seven rebounds and — at 7-4 with a jumper — a unique talent who was difficult to match up with.\n\nSmits is No. 2 in franchise history in points, games and blocks, and third in rebounds. He edges Chuck Person and Clemon Johnson had a productive stretch with the Pacers.\n\n50\n\nTyler Hansbrough: He'll always be the player the Pacers took 13th in the 2009 draft instead of a point guard (Jrue Holiday, Ty Lawson and Jeff Teague went 17, 18 and 19.). He averaged 11.0 points and 5.2 rebounds in his second season but that was his peak. Hansbrough played in 246 games with the Pacers, averaging 8.9 points and 4.7 rebounds.\n\n52\n\nBrad Miller: He took his game up a notch after joining the Pacers with the then-Ron Artest in exchange for Travis Best, Norm Richardson and Jalen Rose, averaging 13.7 points and 8.1 rebounds in a season-and-a-half. Miller played just 101 games with the Pacers but he is one of just 17 players from the team to be named an All-Star.\n\n53\n\nRick Robey: The Pacers took the Kentucky big man No. 3 overall in 1978 after trading the No. 1 overall pick (receiving Johnny Davis from Portland as well). Robey was a solid backup in an eight-year career (7.6 points, 4.7 rebounds) but the Pacers dealt him during his rookie season to Boston to bring Billy Knight back to Indianapolis. He averaged 8.6 points and 5.9 rebounds in 43 games with the Pacers.\n\n54\n\nGreg Dreiling: He was 7-1. And, let's see ... he was 7-1. Did I mention he was 7-1? He played a remarkable seven seasons for the Pacers never averaging more than 3.5 points or 3.5 rebounds. That is better than his competition: Greg Kite and John Edwards. (Anyone else noticing a pattern here?)\n\n55\n\nRoy Hibbert: Big Roy left a bad taste in the mouths of many Pacers fans, and understandably so. He shot just 46.4 percent in seven seasons with the Pacers, a low figure for a 7-2 center who rarely ventured far from the basket. Hibbert seemed fragile and was prone to disappearing at times. But there was also this: 22.1 points, 55.7 percent shooting, 10.4 rebounds, 1.0 blocks. That's what Hibbert did versus the Miami Heat in the 2013 playoffs. The Pacers were one game from the NBA Finals and the No. 1 reason was Roy Hibbert. Louis Orr is the other contender.\n\n62\n\nScot Pollard: He averaged 3.0 points and 3.8 rebounds in 155 games with the Pacers. He earns this spot by virtue of being the only Pacers to wear No. 62.\n\n88"
