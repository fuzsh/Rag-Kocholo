        "text": "The Indiana Pacers drew the No. 7 pick in the 2023 NBA Draft during Tuesday night's draft lottery. They had a 6.9% chance of getting the No. 1 overall pick, almost certain to be French teenager Victor Wembanyama.\n\nIndiana was in the draft lottery last year for the first time in years, and it selected Bennedict Mathurin at No. 6 overall. He earned first-team All-Rookie honors.\n\nThe Pacers were prominently involved in the first five draft lotteries from 1985-89, picking (in chronological order) Wayman Tisdale, Chuck Person, Reggie Miller, Rik Smits and George McCloud. Here are their lottery picks, and how those players fared.\n\nLuck of the draw: Pacers will pick 7th in the 2023 NBA Draft\n\nNo. 2: Rik Smits, Wayman Tisdale\n\n∎ Tisdale was the consolation prize when the Pacers lost out to the New York Knicks in the first draft lottery. New York selected Patrick Ewing. Tisdale averaged 15.2 points and 6.4 rebounds over 3+ seasons, once making the playoffs, before the Pacers traded him to the Sacramento Kings for LaSalle Thompson and Randy Wittman.\n\n∎ Smits came to the Pacers in 1988, one pick after the Los Angeles Clippers took Danny Manning. Smits spent his 12-year career with the Pacers, averaging double-figure scoring every year, earning one All-Star berth and helping them make the 2000 NBA Finals. He averaged 14.8 points and 6.1 rebounds.\n\nNo. 4: Chuck Person\n\n∎ The Pacers' 1986 first-rounder is their only Rookie of the Year, averaging 18.8 points, 8.3 rebounds, 3.6 assists and 1.1 steals. He played in Indiana for six seasons, averaging 19 points, 6.3 rebounds and 3.6 assists as the Pacers made first-round playoff exits four times. He also played for Minnesota, San Antonio, Charlotte and Seattle.\n\nNo. 6: Bennedict Mathurin\n\n∎ Indiana picked Mathurin in 2022 and he made an immediate impact, averaging 16.7 points, mostly as the sixth man. He entered the starting lineup late in the season.\n\nNo. 7: George McCloud\n\n∎ The 6-6 combo guard selected in 1989 never took off with the Pacers. He averaged 5.5 points over four seasons before playing a season in Italy and having a resurgence in Dallas. He also played for Denver, Phoenix and the Los Angeles Lakers.\n\nMore: Roasted by Larry. Fights with Reggie. Crushed by tragedy: George McCloud, more than a Pacers bust\n\nNo. 10: Paul George\n\n∎ The Pacers picked George in 2010 and he earned four All-Star berths in seven seasons ‒ two of them after he suffered a severe leg injury ‒ and averaged 18.1 points, 6.3 rebounds and 1.7 steals. He was the NBA's Most Improved Player in 2013. Indiana traded him to the Oklahoma City Thunder for Victor Oladipo and Domantas Sabonis. George played in OKC for two seasons. He has played for the Los Angeles Clippers the past four years.\n\nNo. 11: Myles Turner, Jerryd Bayless*, Erick Dampier, Reggie Miller\n\n∎ Myles Turner, the longest-tenured current Pacer, just finished his eighth season. He has led the NBA in blocked shots twice, and has career averages of 13.4 points, 6.8 rebounds and 2.3 blocked shots. He made 37.3% of his 3-point tries last season.\n\n∎ Jerryd Bayless was picked in 2008, but was soon traded to Portland (along with Ike Diogu) for Jarrett Jack, Josh McRoberts and Brandon Rush. Rush was a rookie that year, and he spent three years with the Pacers, averaging 6.8 points. Rush also played for Golden State, Minnesota and Utah.\n\n∎ Erick Dampier played one season in Indiana after being picked in 1996, averaging 5.1 points and 4.1 rebounds. He was traded to Golden State one year later for Chris Mullin. Dampier had a 16-year NBA career, including stints with Dallas, Miami and Atlanta.\n\n∎ Reggie Miller came to the Pacers in 1987. It worked out: franchise records of 25,279 points and 2,560 3-pointers, five All-Star berths and a spot in the Naismith Memorial Basketball of Fame. The Pacers made the NBA Finals in 2000.\n\nMore: When Donnie Walsh picked Reggie Miller over Steve Alford, he became Indiana's villain\n\nNo. 12: Austin Croshere\n\n∎ Picked in 1997, Croshere played his first nine seasons in Indiana, his best being the 2000 NBA Finals season (10.3 points, 6.4 rebounds). Pacers career averages: 7.5 points, 4.3 rebounds. He also played for Dallas, Golden State, Milwaukee and San Antonio.\n\nNo. 13: Chris Duarte, Tyler Hansbrough, Dale Davis\n\n∎ Chris Duarte came to the Pacers in 2021 and injuries have stunted his development. He averaged 13.1 points in 55 games (39 starts) as a rookie and 7.9 points in 46 games his second season.\n\n∎ The Pacers selected Tyler Hansbrough in 2009, and in four years he averaged 8.9 points and 4.7 rebounds. He also played for Toronto and Charlotte.\n\n∎ Dale Davis was critical piece of the Pacers' frontcourt after being picked in 1991. In a decade with a Pacers, he averaged 9.3 points and 9.0 rebounds. In his final season with the Pacers, his ninth as a full-time starter, they made the 2000 NBA Finals and he earned an All-Star berth. He was traded that offseason for Jermaine O'Neal and Joe Kleine.\n\nNo. 14: Fred Jones, Scott Haskin, Malik Sealy\n\n∎ The Pacers picked Jones in 2002 and he played four years, averaging 7.7 points. He also played for New York, Toronto, the L.A. Clippers and Portland.\n\n∎ Haskin played sparingly after being picked in 1993.\n\n∎ Sealy averaged 6.1 points over two seasons after the Pacers picked him in 1993. Indiana traded him to the L.A. Clippers in a package that brought Mark Jackson to the Pacers. Sealy also played for Detroit and Minnesota. He died in a car accident at the age of 30.\n\nNo. 15: Kawhi Leonard*, Eric Piatkowski*\n\n∎ The Pacers had a deal in place to bring George Hill home before they picked Kawhi Leonard in 2012. Leonard played his first seven seasons in San Antonio, and also for Toronto and the L.A. Clippers. He has five All-Star berths, two Defensive Player of the Year honors and two NBA championships.\n\n∎ Eric Piatkowski was part of the same deal that sent Malik Sealy to the L.A. Clippers for Mark Jackson. Piatkowski played for four teams over 14 seasons, averaging 7.5 points."
