        "text": "There was something off about college basketball in the mid to late aughts.\n\nThe white guy who irked everyone played for North Carolina, not Duke.\n\nThe only logical explanation for the hate of Tyler Hansbrough wasn't that he was annoying, he was literally psychotic. You don't earn the nickname \"Psycho T\" because of your similarities to Howard from accounting.\n\nIt was also an experimentation phase for the country. I get it, it's college. Hating the Christian Laettner, JJ Redick and Steve Wojciechowskis of the world was becoming stale.\n\nHansbrough's style of play was a source of irritation for anyone who wasn't a UNC fan. His success exacerbated it.\n\nWhat happened to the guy everyone loved to hate?\n\nTyler Hansbrough at North Carolina\n\nRELATED: What Happened to Jimmer Fredette and Where is He Now?\n\nTyler Hansbrough was born on November 3, 1985 in Columbia, Missouri. He attended Poplar Bluff High School and led the basketball team to back-to-back state championships as an upperclassmen. The power forward was also named a McDonald's All-American and earned a spot in the Jordan Brand Classic, where he was Co-MVP with Andray Blatche.\n\nFor college, Hansbrough committed to head coach Roy Williams and the University of North Carolina over Kansas, Kentucky and Missouri.\n\nDiving into the details of his UNC career isn't necessary. Let's just say he played basketball.\n\n— NCAA Champion (2009)\n\n— Consensus National College Player of the Year (2008)\n\n— 3x Consensus First-Team All-American\n\n— Consensus Second-Team All-American (2006)\n\n— USBWA National Freshman of the Year (2006)\n\n— ACC Player of the Year (2008)\n\n— 4x First-Team All-ACC\n\n— ACC Rookie of the Year (2006)\n\n— ACC All-Freshman Team (2006)\n\n— ACC Tournament MVP (2008)\n\n— No. 50 Retired by North Carolina Tar Heels\n\n— McDonald's All-American (2005)\n\n— First-Team Parade All-American (2005)\n\nHansbrough averaged 20.2 points, 8.6 rebounds, and shot 79.1% from the free-throw line in his college career. He's the school's all-time leading scorer with 2,872 points and all-time leader in rebounding with 1,219.\n\nTyler Hansbrough's NBA Career\n\nThe frontcourt payer was the 13th overall pick by the Indiana Pacers in the 2009 NBA Draft. A preseason injury delayed his debut as an NBA player. He appeared in just 29 games as a rookie.\n\nIn 2013, he signed with the Toronto Raptors as a free agent. Following two years north of the border, Hansbrough returned to North Carolina to play for the state's NBA team, the Charlotte Hornets, on a one-year deal. He went on to have a short D-League (now G-League) stint with the Fort Wayne Mad Ants in 2017.\n\nFor his NBA career, Hansbrough recorded 6.7 points and 4.2 rebounds. He participated in the playoffs in six of his seven seasons.\n\nTyler Hansbrough Now\n\nTyler Hansbrough then migrated to the Chinese Basketball Association (CBA). He's played for the Guangzhou Long-Lions, Zhejiang Golden Bulls and Sichuan Blue Whales.\n\nThe professional basketball player has fared much better in China.\n\nIn three seasons, he notched 23.2 points and 11 rebounds. He didn't play in the 2020-21 season due to travel restrictions associated with the coronavirus pandemic and COVID-19 outbreak and appears to have hung up the sneakers.\n\nIn the meantime, the 2008 National Player of the Year returned to his glory days in Chapel Hill. He made his broadcasting debut as a color commentator in North Carolina's February 17, 2021 matchup against Northeastern. He also hosts a podcast called \"SleepHawk Worldwide.\"\n\nPsycho T frequently hangs around the UNC program. He can be found at the Smith Center behind the home bench and playing in summer pick-up games.\n\nIt's not four years, it's for life."
