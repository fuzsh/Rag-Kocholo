        "text": "INDEPENDENCE — When Mike Brown interviewed for the Cavaliers’ head coaching job, he was a little-known assistant coach with the Indiana Pacers. Most people thought he was the former NBA player by the same name, some guy known as the “Brown Bear.” He sat across the desk from Cavs owner Dan Gilbert in 2006. Gilbert had watched his team fail miserably on the defensive end in former Coach Paul Silas’ tenure. In his mind, he wanted someone to adopt a defensive culture. When Brown emphasized defense first and foremost, Gilbert knew he had found his man. He hand-picked Brown over more established coaches like Flip Saunders and Eric Musselman. He certainly hasn’t regretted his decision. “That same plan I gave Dan Gilbert when I interviewed is sitting in my office right now,” Brown said. “If you read it, you would think we scripted everything from Day One to where we are right now. “It’s something I believe in. I’m glad my guys stuck with it. I’m glad Dan and (GM) Danny (Ferry) stuck with it and, hopefully, it will pay off with the ultimate prize sooner than later.” Trivia question Three players on the Cavs’ playoff roster weren’t drafted. Who are they? (Answer below) Shocking report Even though Cavs forward/center Ben Wallace’s legs were healed, he was still experiencing pain. That’s when the Cavs decided to send him to shock wave therapy. The pain was excruciating during the therapy on both legs, almost the worst he said he’s ever felt. “When it hurt the way it hurt while they were doing it, it can’t help but feel better,” he said. He said he’s getting treatments once a week. “It’s something like when your body is telling your arm that it’s healed, but it’s still hurting,” Wallace said. “You shock it and wake it up so your body can heal naturally. “I’m feeling as good as I’m going to feel for the playoffs.” Cavs guard Mo Williams injured his shoulder in the Atlanta series. When asked when he was injured, he replied, “I don’t remember. “At this point in the year, everyone is banged up and dealing with some sort of injury. Some you just have to maintain and get through it. I don’t think it will be a problem at all.” He has been getting his shoulder taped for games and practices. “It’s precautionary stuff to make sure you don’t get too banged up,” he said. Draft workouts Even though the playoffs are in the conference finals stage, the Cavs are preparing diligently for the June draft. They are expected to host some individual workouts this week with Maryland guard Greivis Vasquez, Missouri forward Leo Lyons, Tennessee forward Tyler Smith and South Dragons forward Joe Ingles. In mid-June, New Jersey is hosting a giant workout camp for prospects. Just about the entire league will be on hand. Among the draft-eligible players scheduled to participate are Tennessee-Martin guard Lester Hudson, Maccabi Tel Aviv forward Omri Casspi, UCLA point guard Darren Collison, Arizona forward Chase Budinger, Wake Forest guard Jeff Teague, UConn guard A.J. Price and Louisville forward Terrence Williams, North Carolina guard Wayne Ellington, UCLA guard Jrue Holiday, Pitt forward Sam Young, North Carolina forward Danny Green and North Carolina forward/center Tyler Hansbrough. The Cavs have the Nos. 30 and 46 picks in the June 25 draft. By the numbers * 5.4 rating: ESPN’s telecast of Game 6 of the Western Conference semifinals between the Lakers and Rockets on Thursday was the network’s most-viewed game ever. The rating represented an average of 5,306,000 household impressions and 7,352,000 viewers. * 7.0: Nuggets center Nene averaged just 7 points on the road in their series against Dallas and 22 points at the Pepsi Center. * 30.7 percent: Celtics guard Ray Allen is averaging just 11.5 points and shooting under 31 percent in the series against Orlando heading into Game 7. * 52.3 percent: Hall of Fame guard Dave Bing won a special run-off election for mayor earlier this month. He took more than 50 percent of the vote. Who’s hot? Pacers forward Danny Granger capped off his All-Star season earlier this week when he was named the league’s Most Improved Player. “I don’t want to just get better; I want to be an elite player,” Granger said about how he wants to improve his game. “I’ve really patterned my defensive game after Ron Artest, but I probably got away from it the last two years. So next year, I think that (defense) will be my focus. We scored a lot of points, but we gave up a lot. As a leader, it starts with me and I have to be better on the defensive end.” Granger is the third Pacer to win the award, joining Jalen Rose (2000) and Jermaine O’Neal (2002). Granger finished fifth in the league in scoring at 25.8 points a game. He’s the first player in league history to raise his scoring average at least five points a game for three consecutive seasons. Who’s not? Mavericks owner Mark Cuban issued an apology. But it wasn’t good enough for Nuggets forward Kenyon Martin. “I don’t think it was sincere, to be honest,” Martin said about Cuban apologizing on his blog about an unflattering comment made about Martin to his mother on Mother’s Day Eve. While walking off the court, a fan called the Denver players thugs. “That includes your son,” Cuban said to Lydia Moore, Martin’s mom. “(Cuban) just waited until he let all that stuff stay up out there,” Martin said. “He should have done it before. It wasn’t the right decision on his behalf.” Teammate Carmelo Anthony said the apology should have been done face-to-face. “That’s any way you should do stuff,” Anthony said. “You should put everything man to man… (Not) blog-to-blog, Twitter-to-Twitter, (but) face-to-face.” Trivia answer Three players on the Cavs’ roster who weren’t drafted are Wallace, Tarence Kinsey and Jawad Williams. Quick shots * ESPN’s Brad Daugherty, who played his entire NBA career with the Cavs, loves watching James play. But the NASCAR analyst said he thinks his old Cavs team would prevail over the current edition. “There’s no doubt about it,” Daugherty said. “We’d win by 20 or 30.” * Knicks center Eddy Curry has already begun two-a-day workouts at an undisclosed facility in Michigan. The program was arranged by Curry’s agent, Leon Rose. Curry’s weight has ballooned up around 300 pounds. Rose brought in William Wesley — yes, “Worldwide” Wes — to oversee the Curry renovation project. * Thunder fans hope to land the No. 1 selection in the draft so they can grab Oklahoma forward/center Blake Griffin. They have only an 11.9 percent chance in Tuesday’s draft lottery. Some fans would like Thunder general manager Sam Presti to trade for the top pick. History is against OKC landing Griffin via a trade. Only twice in NBA history has a team with the No. 1 pick traded that selection. Philadelphia dealt the No. 1 pick in 1986 to the Cavs, who drafted Daugherty. Orlando drafted Michigan forward Chris Webber in 1993 and traded his rights to Golden State for Anfernee Hardaway and three other first-round picks.\n\nOriginally Published: May 17, 2009 at 9:44 a.m."
