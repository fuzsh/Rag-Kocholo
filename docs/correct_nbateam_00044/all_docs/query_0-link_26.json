        "text": "For the second game in a row, the Pacers almost stole a road win from the Bulls. With the league’s best record, likely MVP Derrick Rose, Coach of the Year favorite Tom Thibodeau, rebounding animist Joakim Noah, and a strong chance of making the Finals, the Bulls have the engines of destiny pumping away for them. Part-Cinderella story, part-Horatio Alger platitude, all playoff-ready assemblage, this season they proved themselves capable of throttling opposing teams at both ends of the court—a role they grew into without ever ceasing to be amazed by their own success.\n\nThe Pacers, on the other hand, were 2010-11’s Team Without Qualities. They were neither good, nor bad; they had talent, some of it even mildly exotic, but line-up instability and a mid-season coaching change kept them from ever taking hold as a cult presence. A friend of mine, who works as a consultant for the team, was mildly stunned on Sunday to find all his NBA friends discussing players like Darren Collison (who looks like the Black Spider-man, no lie) and boom-or-bust swingman Paul George (a name approaching supra-anonymity). In my Eastern Conference preview, I described Tyler Hansbrough as \"on the verge of legitimacy\"; the Pacers themselves may not win a game, or convince anyone that they’re better than advertised. Weird things happen in the playoffs, the sort of quirks and imperfections that settle in when something goes on too long—they’re remarkably similar to those we see in speed-dating, fuck-and-run tourneys like March Madness. Except in the NBA playoffs, they aren’t dictating outcomes. That doesn’t mean, though, that these ups and downs don’t pay dividends.\n\nFor a middling team like the Pacers, first-round visibility can mean as much as winning a game or two; altering perception is as important as notching those incidental victories. Of course, they have to keep things close for audiences to stick around, to come by to see what the fuss is about. That’s a shade of legitimacy, I suppose. But more importantly, the Pacers are no longer a hole in the middle in the NBA. Hansbrough’s scorched earth stare and thwacking limbs have convinced casual fans that he can play at this level. George is a budding enigma, not the name on a corpse or forged passport. Center Roy Hibbert is flirting with that coveted, if tired, tag of \"young true center.\" We’ve been reminded of Collison’s speed with the ball, the kind of wonder sure to rescue a player from post-trade oblivion. And Granger, who has spent his entire career slipping through the cracks, has a game that’s anything but nebulous.\n\nSo congratulations, Pacers. Not on your pair of near-upsets, but on imbuing yourselves with something resembling a personality. You are no longer empty names, numbers, and unis we slip past with the clicker, but the bodies within them.\n\n—Bethlehem Shoals"
