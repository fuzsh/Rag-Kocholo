        "text": "RALEIGH, N.C. - Tyler Hansbrough's impressive list of accolades continued to grow Monday when the North Carolina star became the first player in league history to be unanimously selected four times to the all-Atlantic Coast Conference team.\n\nTar Heels teammate Ty Lawson joined him on the first team, along with Florida State guard Toney Douglas, Duke swingman Gerald Henderson and Miami guard Jack McClinton in voting by 76 members of the Atlantic Coast Sports Media Association.\n\nHansbrough last year became the third player in league history to be unanimously named to the all-ACC team three times, joining North Carolina State's David Thompson (1973-75) and Duke's Art Heyman (1961-63), and was the first to do it in his first three years in the league.\n\nThen, the 6-foot-9 big man went out and one-upped himself during his senior season.\n\n\"It's quite an honor considering all the great players that have played in the ACC,\" Hansbrough said. \"It's really a tough league, year in and year out. If it's not the best league in a given year, it's always one of the best.\n\n\"I don't think in terms of individual awards and accomplishments, but to do something that's never been done before in a league as great as the ACC is pretty cool.\"\n\nHe leads the league with a 21-point scoring average. The reigning national player of the year and leading scorer in school history enters this week's ACC tournament 52 points shy of J.J. Redick's 3-year-old league record of 2,769 career points.\n\nMcClinton, the only other repeat selection to the first team, is the ACC's leading 3-point shooter and has made 46 percent of his attempts from beyond the arc.\n\nDouglas was a near unanimous selection - he received 226 voting points of a possible 228. He is scoring 20.8 points per game, second in the ACC, is the league's leading scorer in conference games.\n\nLawson leads the ACC with 6.5 assists per game and an assist-to-turnover ratio of 3.3, and his scoring average of nearly 16 points ranks 12th in the conference.\n\nHenderson, Duke's leading scorer, averages 16.6 points and scored at least 19 points in seven of his final nine games.\n\nThe three all-ACC teams were once again dominated by balance: Ten of the league's 12 teams placed at least one player into the 15 slots. The only Georgia Tech selection was Gani Lawal on the third team."
