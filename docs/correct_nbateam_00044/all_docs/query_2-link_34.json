        "text": "The Poplar Bluff Sports Hall of Fame will induct two new members and two teams as its 36th\n\nclass during a ceremony at E.T. Peters Gym on Thursday, Oct. 10, 2024.\n\nTyler Hansbrough, Ben Hansbrough and the 2004 and 2005 PBHS Mules basketball teams\n\nwill be honored and their plaques will be added to the Hall of Fame room in the Poplar Bluff\n\nMuseum on Main Street, bringing the total number of those honored to 100 individuals and 12\n\nteams.\n\nIt should be a wonderful night celebrating the best Mules basketball players and teams\n\ntogether, said Brian Rosener, president of the Sports Hall of Fame.\n\nTyler Hansbrough was an All-American basketball player in high school and college, holding\n\nnumerous records and his No. 50 jersey retired at both levels, helping the Mules win two state\n\nchampionships and the North Carolina Tar Heels to the 2009 NCAA title. After being drafted\n\n13th overall by the Indiana Pacers, he played seven years in the NBA and three more in China.\n\nHansbrough has also been inducted into the College Basketball Hall of Fame and the Missouri\n\nSports Hall of Fame.\n\nBen Hansbrough was an All-American and Big East Player of the Year at the University of\n\nNotre Dame after helping the Mules win two state championships and having his No. 23 jersey\n\nretired at Poplar Bluff. A two-time all-state player in high school, he was named Mr. Show-Me\n\nBasketball as a senior and finished second all-time in scoring for the Mules. He played\n\nprofessionally in Europe and in the NBA Development League before signing with the Indiana\n\nPacers during the 2012 season.\n\nAt the time, the Hansbroughs were the fourth pair of brothers to play together on the same\n\nNBA team.\n\nDuring their three seasons together at Poplar Bluff, the Mules won 78 games, made three\n\nappearances in the MSHSAA final four, finishing fourth in 2003 before winning consecutive\n\nchampionships.\n\nThe 2004 Mules finished 25-6, beating Blue Springs 64-56 in the Class 5 championship\n\ngame at the Hearnes Center in Columbia. Varsity lettermen to be honored are Travon Battles,\n\nDevon Brown, Rusty Bryant, Brad Chronister, James Dixon, Colbi Ellison, Emil Fernando,\n\nAnthony Gilberto, Ben Hansbrough, Tyler Hansbrough, Clay Lawson, Allan Spencer, Todd\n\nTinsley, Ross Whelan, Anthony Williams and Glen Yandell.\n\nThe 2005 Mules finished 27-4, capped with a 72-56 win over Vashon in the Class 5\n\nchampionship game at Mizzou Arena in Columbia in a meeting of two defending state\n\nchampions. Vashon won the Class 4 title the previous year. Varsity lettermen to be honored are\n\nEvan Bascombe, Phillip Brown, Rusty Bryant, Brad Chronister, Emil Fernando, John Fernando,\n\nBen Hansbrough, Tyler Hansbrough, Skyler Holeman, Kevin Hutson, Clay Lawson, Jack March,\n\nAllan Spencer, Ricky Taylor, Todd Tinsley and Ross Whelan.\n\nBoth teams were coached by John David Pattillo, who was inducted into the Sports Hall of\n\nFame in 2007.\n\nBen and Tyler Hansbrough will be joining their father, Gene, and uncle Sean Fister in the\n\nSports Hall of Fame. Gene Hansbrough, a high jumper, was inducted in 1996, while Fister, a\n\ngolfer, was honored in 2005.\n\nTickets for the event will go on sale at a later date.\n\nThe inductees will also be recognized during halftime of the Mules varsity football game\n\nagainst West Plains on Friday, Oct. 11, at Mules Stadium.\n\nThe induction banquet will be held at Peters Gym, named for E.T. Peters who was one of the\n\nfirst three members of the Sports Hall of Fame, on the court, which was named in honor of Ben\n\nand Tyler Hansbrough. The Mules never lost a home game with either Hansbrough on the\n\nroster.\n\nIts a perfect venue to honor Poplar Bluffs basketball history, and were working hard to\n\nmake it a memorable night for everyone, said Rosener, who thanked the Poplar Bluff R-I\n\nSchool District for allowing the ceremony to be held there.\n\nAlong with proceeds from the E.E. Bus Carr Memorial Golf Tournament, which will be held\n\nThursday, Oct. 10, at Ozark Ridge Golf Course, the only financial support for the Sports Hall of\n\nFame comes from contributions from the community.
