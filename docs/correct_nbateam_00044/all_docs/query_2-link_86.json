        "text": "2010/2011 NBA Regular Season vs. 14-25\n\n16-21\n\nStaples Center\n\nJanuary 17th, 2011, 12:30 PM FSN Prime Ticket, KFWB 980 AM\n\nProbable starters: Baron Davis\n\nPG Darren Collison Eric Gordon SG Mike Dunleavy\n\nRyan Gomes\n\nSF Danny Granger Blake Griffin\n\nPF Tyler Hansbrough DeAndre Jordan\n\nC Roy Hibbert\n\nThe Back Story:\n\nNovember 18, 2010 in Indianapolis - Indiana 107, Clippers 80 Recap Box Score\n\nThe Big Picture:\n\nIt's hard to remember how poorly the Clippers were playing the last time these two teams met. It was almost exactly two months ago, and the Clippers lost by 27 points to drop to 1-12. It was also the last time that Blake Griffin had less than a double double, his current rampage kicking off in the very next game against New York. To say that this is a different Clippers team than the one that lost in Indianapolis back in November would be an extreme understatement. The loss to the Pacers was their 7th double digit loss of the season, and their fourth by 15 or more, in only 13 games. Since then, in 25 games, they've lost by double digits only three times, and never by as many as 15. So I think it's reasonable to presume that the Clippers will have a little extra to prove this afternoon at Staples Center, as they look to avenge their worst loss of the season. It also helps that these are teams headed in opposite directions - the Pacers are 11-16 since that first meeting, the Clippers are 13-13. In more recent weeks, the Clippers have won 9 of their last 13, and the Pacers have lost 11 of their last 16. Absolutely nobody played well for the Clippers in the first meeting with Indiana, but I expect that to change. Griffin will be looking to avenge one of his poorer performances of the season, as will Eric Gordon. The Clippers are lucky that they have this extra motivation against the Pacers, as otherwise I might have worried about a letdown following a big win against the Lakers. They've got enough to prove against this team that I don't think a lack of focus is going to be a problem. It also helps that they'll have Baron Davis, who was still injured the last time these teams played. Baron's been doing a great job of making good things happen for the Clippers since he returned to the line lineup at the beginning of December, not coincidentally the same time they started winning a lot of games.\n\nThe Antagonist:\n\nThe Paces are 16-21 overall, and are 5-11 in their last 16 games. So naturally they currently have the seventh best record in the Eastern Conference. The Pacers are one of those mixed up teams; they play at a high pace and score a lot of points, but they're really a much better defensive team on the whole. They rank 26th in the league in offensive efficiency, and 7th in defensive efficiency. One of the reasons their offensive efficiency suffers is because their best scorer has been inefficient this season. Danny Granger leads the Pacers in scoring by a wide margin, but he's shooting a career low 42% from the field. He's also taking almost two fewer free throws per game this season. As a result, Granger's true shooting percentage is around 53%, which is not very good (by contrast, Eric Gordon's is at almost 58%). Beyond Granger, the Pacers don't really have any great scoring options. Former Bruin Darren Collison, Roy Hibbert, Mike Dunleavy Jr and Brandon Rush all score between 11.7 and 13.5 points per game, but none shoots a particularly good percentage. One big difference between the Pacers team that was 11-10 and the one that is 5-11 since is that Hibbert is a totally different player. I'm not sure which is stranger - that Hibbert came out of nowhere to average 16 and 10 through the first month of the season, or that he's since returned to what he always was before, a 10 and 6 project center. The Pacers take a lot of threes - over 22 per game, fourth most in the NBA. In the first meeting, they made 14 of them, tying the season high for threes allowed for the Clippers this season. How the Clippers defend the line today will be a major factor in the outcome.\n\nThe Subplots"
