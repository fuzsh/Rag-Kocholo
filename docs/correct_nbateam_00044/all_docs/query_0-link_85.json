        "text": "Close your eyes for a moment and just listen to the stats: Four-time, first-team All-America. National Player of the Year as a junior. All-time leading scorer in ACC history and the all-time leading rebounder at North Carolina.\n\nBased solely on the information given, you’d think Tyler Hansbrough would have been one of the most sought-after players available in Thursday’s NBA draft.\n\nNow open your eyes to see a gangly, somewhat goofy looking white kid who the morons in the gallery at Madison Square Garden serenaded with chants of “Over-rated” when he was selected at No. 13 by the Indiana Pacers.\n\nIt’s amazing how perception can change everything.\n\nWe see only what we want to see, especially when stereotypes are involved, and we immediately disregard everything else, regardless of whether the numbers back us up or not.\n\nA hard working gym rat can’t possibly be a talented athlete, too, regardless of what he’s accomplished on the court.\n\nJust look at him.\n\nGood thing for Hansbrough that another Midwestern-born gym rat whose talent people once tried to discount was around to look past all the things the former Tar Heel star “can’t” do and remember all the things he can and already has done.\n\nYou’ve probably heard of him. His name is Larry Bird.\n\nInstead of allowing himself to be blinded by all the new-age trends his fellow general managers and talent scouts always seem to be fretting about, the Indiana Pacers president (and Hall of Famer) looked past the vertical leap charts and up-side potential and took the player who most reminded him of himself.\n\n“I think he’s going to be a good one,” Bird said in the days leading up to the draft. “They have picked on Tyler for four years, but all he’s ever done is won.”\n\nIt’s a quality Bird is hoping Hansbrough brings to his rebuilding team, which has failed to qualify for the NBA playoffs for the past three seasons.\n\nJust don’t think his contribution will be limited to just leadership, grit and hard work.\n\nDespite an abundance of critics who continue to poke holes in his game, Hansbrough’s recent NBA workouts suggest that he may be much better equipped to score and rebound in the league than first meets the eye.\n\nFor one thing, he was measured at a legitimate 6-foot-8¼, bigger than some believed. As far as agility and athleticism is concerned, he graded out favorably to the Chicago Bulls’ rising young star Tyrus Thomas.\n\nAnd his shooting ability?\n\nHansbrough showed that off – along with his trademark competitiveness – at a predraft tryout for a team that had no real interest in signing him.\n\nWhen the player found out he was only there to provide an extra big body on the court, his Psycho T persona took over and he put on a performance even he had a hard time believing.\n\n“I was mad, wondering why I was even there,” he said in a story related recently by his college coach Roy Williams. “So I just decided to act like everybody else at those workouts and shoot it every time I touched it.”\n\nP.S. Hansbrough made every shoot he took.\n\n“That’s him,” Williams said. “That’s the uniqueness about him.\n\n“He went inside, did all the dirty work, looked like a bull in a china shop, looked uncoordinated, spastic, however you want to color it, but it’s hard to look like a great athlete with two guys hanging on you and the referee pinching you on the arm and everything else he had to put up with.\n\n“Everybody says he can’t do this and he can’t do that. The only thing I know is that his team won a heck of a lot of games, he won every award you can win, is the leading scorer and rebounder in North Carolina history – and we’re pretty daggum good.”\n\nJudging from Hansbrough’s rising draft stock in the final few days leading up to the annual lottery of young basketball talent, others are finally beginning to take notice of what Williams has been saying all along.\n\nVirtually every NBA team official who watched him perform during the past month has had the same reaction: Wow, this kid is a much better athlete than we thought!\n\nAmazing what happens when you actually open your eyes and see what you see, instead of what you’ve been told to believe.\n\nACC Insider Brett Friedlander can be reached at brett.friedlander@yahoo.com."
