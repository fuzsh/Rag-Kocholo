        "text": "CHAPEL HILL | Thanks to the latest in a growing pile of awards, North Carolina’s Tyler Hansbrough will soon join a select group of the storied program’s all-time greats.\n\nThe junior was named national player of the year by Sporting News on Tuesday, ensuring he will become just the eighth Tar Heel to have his number retired. When he leaves school, Hansbrough will join a list that includes Michael Jordan, James Worthy and Phil Ford on the distinguished front row of jerseys hanging in the Smith Center rafters.\n\n“It truly is something special to have accomplished,” Hansbrough said in a statement. “In fact, it’s kind of hard to sit here and talk about how it feels to be put in the same category as the players who are up there already.”\n\nAntawn Jamison, unanimous national player of the year in 1998, was the last Tar Heel to have his jersey retired.\n\n“There will never be another one just like him,” UNC coach Roy Williams said in a statement. “I am so lucky to be his coach. For the rest of my career, I will be able to look up into that first row and see his jersey ... and I know that will bring a big smile to my face.”\n\nThe 6-foot-9 Hansbrough led the Atlantic Coast Conference in scoring (23.1 points) and rebounding (10.5) this season for the top-ranked Tar Heels (29-2, 14-2 ACC). On Monday, he became just the third player in league history to be unanimously selected three times to the all-ACC team, joining N.C. State's David Thompson (1973-75) and Duke's Art Heyman (1961-63).\n\nMike DeCourcy, college basketball writer for Sporting News, said Hansbrough’s role in the Tar Heels’ rise to No. 1 separated him from Kansas State freshman Michael Beasley – especially after North Carolina lost point guard Ty Lawson with a sprained left ankle on Feb. 3 at Florida State.\n\nWith Lawson out nearly seven full games, Hansbrough averaged 28 points and 12.1 rebounds. Before that, he averaged 21.8 points and 9.9 rebounds.\n\n“To go from being a highly productive player and a very important component to a successful team to completely taking over a team ... I thought it was just astounding what he was able to do,” DeCourcy said. “And I think to overlook that would be a mistake.”\n\nFor a North Carolina men’s player to have his jersey retired, he must win at least one of six national player of the year awards: The Associated Press, the U.S. Basketball Writers Association, the National Association of Basketball Coaches, Sporting News, the Wooden Award and the Naismith Award.\n\nThe rest of the All-ACC team announced Monday included Virginia senior guard Sean Singletary, who was also picked to the first team for the third time. The pair are the 24th and 25th three-time first-teamers in league history and first since Maryland's Juan Dixon in 2002.\n\nAlso making the first team were Boston College's Tyrese Rice, Duke's DeMarcus Nelson and Miami's Jack McClinton. Rice was picked to the second team last season, while McClinton was on the third team. The selections were made by 90 writers and broadcasters in the Atlantic Coast Sports Media Association.\n\nBalance is a staple of the three all-league teams: Ten of the 12 ACC schools placed at least one player on a team. The only school with more than two is Duke, with three. Georgia Tech and N.C. State were the only two schools not represented.\n\nRice (21.3 points) and Singletary (19.9) rank second and third in the league in scoring, and McClinton leads the ACC by averaging three 3-pointers per game and making 44 percent of his shots from beyond the arc. Nelson is one of the league's best lockdown defenders.\n\nMaryland's Greivis Vasquez and James Gist joined North Carolina's Wayne Ellington, Virginia Tech's A.D. Vassallo and Clemson's K.C. Rivers on the second team. The third team was led by Duke freshman Kyle Singler and junior Greg Paulus, along with Florida State's Toney Douglas, Wake Forest freshman James Johnson and Clemson's Cliff Hammonds.\n\nThe league also announced its all-freshman and all-defensive teams, with two Duke players leading the way.\n\nSingler was one of three unanimous picks to the all-freshman team, joining Johnson and N.C. State's J.J. Hickson. Jeff Teague of Wake Forest and Jeff Allen of Virginia Tech rounded out the rookie team.\n\nNelson led all nominees with 68 votes for the all-defensive team, and joining him were Douglas, Gist, Boston College's Tyrelle Blair and North Carolina's Marcus Ginyard."
