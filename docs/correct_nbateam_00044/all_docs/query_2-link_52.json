        "text": "2009 Indiana Pacers Summer League Roster\n\nFormer Liberty men's basketball player Anthony Smith will suit up for the Indiana Pacers' summer team and will participate in the 2009 NBA Pepsi Pro Summer League, hosted by the Orlando Magic at the RDV Sportsplex in Orlando, Fla.\n\n\"Taking part in the summer league and the entire process has been a tremendous experience,\" said Smith. \"I am trying to take it step-by-step and one workout at a time.\"\n\nThe Pacers' summer league roster is headlined by current players Brandon Rush, Josh McRoberts and Roy Hibbert. Also featured on the roster are 2009 draft picks Tyler Hansbrough (13th overall) and A.J. Price (52nd overall).\n\nSmith is one of four members of the 13-man roster who went undrafted in this year's draft after finishing their collegiate eligibility in 2009. Aaron Jackson of Duquesene, Leo Lyons of Missouri and Scott Vander Meer of Illinois-Chicago, also participated in pre-draft workouts with the Pacers and made the organization's summer league roster.\n\nSmith and the rest of the Pacers' summer league team will practice this week in Indianapolis, Ind., inside Conseco Fieldhouse, before heading to Orlando, Fla., Sunday evening after practice.\n\nThe 15-game summer league event will feature the Orlando Magic, Indiana Pacers, Oklahoma City Thunder, Utah Jazz, Boston Celtics and a split squad between the New Jersey Nets and Philadelphia 76ers. Smith and the Pacers will play a total of five games, starting on Monday at 3 p.m. against the split squad team of the New Jersey Nets and Philadelphia 76ers.\n\nDue to space limitations, the event is not open to the public and will be open only to the media and professional team/league personnel. Games will begin at 3 p.m. from July 6-9, and at 11 a.m. on July 10. Box scores, game recaps and cumulative statistics from the event will be made available by visiting www.orlandomagic.com.\n\nSmith, a fall 2008 preseason pick on CollegeInsider.com's Mid-Major All-American list, earned honorable mention honors from the prestigious website during his senior campaign in 2009, where he averaged 17.6 points and pulled down a career-best 6.5 rebounds per contest. Smith concluded his prominent Liberty career ranked No. 9 all-time in the Big South Conference in scoring, while finishing No. 6 in the Liberty annals. Smith's 1,754 career points rank second only to Larry Blair (2,211) in Liberty's Division I era. The Plano, Texas native was the 2008-09 Big South Conference preseason player of the year and secured first-team honors on the Big South all-conference and NABC all-district teams, while earning a honorable mention nod on the VaSID All-State team as a senior.\n\nAs a junior, Smith was the only player in the nation during the 2008 season to attempt at least 200 three-point field goals and succeed on at least 40 percent of his three-point field goal attempts (41.0), while also hitting over 50 percent of his field goal attempts (51.5). Only four other players in the nation accomplish the same feat while attempting at least 100 three-point field goals, including Mario Chalmers (Kansas), Lee Cummard (BYU), Malik Hairston (Oregon) and James Harden (Arizona State).\n\nSmith had spent the past month working out in Indianapolis, Ind., with former Memphis assistant coach and Wright State head coach Ed Schilling, the Executive Director and trainer of Champions Academy, in preparation for the 2009 NBA Draft, which was held on June 25 at Madison Square Garden in New York. Smith had a preseason workout with the Pacers on June 19."
