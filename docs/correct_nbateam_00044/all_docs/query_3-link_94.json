        "text": "Depending upon whom you ask, Tyler Hansbrough is either the most accomplished amateur athlete of the last decade or a robotic dinosaur made of Play-Doh. This morning, the sting of a UNC championship and a couple Scotches still not subsided, I decided we should let him live on as both. So did a lot of other guys who continue to bloviate about such unimportant things well after I gave up the practice. But I went to Duke, where I may not have blended in with the fans, but where a diploma makes it difficult to say this about a just-crowned champion from Chapel Hill: Hansbrough embodies, perhaps better than any of his contemporaries, what is sacred about college basketball. The what would be winning, and winning at all costs.\n\nAnd the NBA could use some of that, what with all the whining, the drunk driving, and the Isiah Thomas-ing. So I'm going to get used to this No. 50 character, no matter if he's slipped in the draft, no matter how many times I have to see the above photo while Bill Walton spews platitudes about \"true grit.\" Because last night won't be the last of his titles. And because it's pointless to hate the Robert Horrys and Ron Harpers and Tyler Hansbroughs of the world come playoff time, simply because they refuse to go quietly â€” and won't tolerate losing. Dick Vitale, for perhaps the first time in his life, said it best on ESPN last night at 12:46 a.m., with one of those bloviations about unimportant things that, even now with the bitterness and the Scotch washed out of my system, still offers a simple truth: \"He may not make an all-star team, he may not be a superstar, but you win by having people like Tyler Hansbrough on your team.\"\n\nRELATED LINKS:\n\nMORE HOOPS: Seven of the Dirtiest Teams in College Basketball History\n\nWHAT I'VE LEARNED: John Wooden"
