        "text": "Young participants at UAB head basketball coach Jerod Haase's basketball camp had a special visitor drop in at Bartow Arena.\n\nFormer North Carolina standout and current Indiana Pacers center Tyler Hansbrough visited with players during the camp, which is designed to teach fundamentals of the game while stressing the importance of hard work.\n\nHaase and Hansbrough spent four years together in Chapel Hill while the currents Blazers coach worked as an assistant under Roy Williams. Hasse helped guide the 6-foot-9 Hansbrough to becoming the Atlantic Coast Conference's all-time leading scorer, a three-time First-Team All American, the 2008 James Naismith Player of the Year and a 2009 NCAA Tournament champion in the four years they spent together at North Carolina.\n\nHansbrough was selected 13th overall by the Pacers in the 2009 NBA Draft. He averaged 7.0 points and 4.6 rebounds per game this season.\n\nThe first session of Haase's camp concluded today. The second session will be held June 24 through 27.
