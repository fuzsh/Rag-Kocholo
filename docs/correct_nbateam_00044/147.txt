INDIANAPOLIS — The Indiana Pacers have signed Tyler Hansbrough, the former North Carolina star who was the team’s top pick in the NBA draft.

The 6-foot-9 forward had been playing with the Pacers summer league team in Orlando, Fla., before his singing was announced Wednesday.

As the 13th overall pick, he’s slotted in the NBA’s rookie salary scale to receive about $1.5 million this season and nearly $1.7 million next season, with a $1.8 million option for his third year.

Hansbrough is the Atlantic Coast Conference’s career-scoring leader and had 40 points and nine rebounds in his first two summer league games for the Pacers.
