        "text": "Nobel Prize-winning Turkish author, Orhan Pamuk, has written another fascinating and timely historical fiction.\n\nNights of Plague was originally published in Turkish in 2021 â at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. The result is an eerily familiar story about a global epidemic which reaches the shores of a fictionalised island called Mingheria, located near Crete. It is set in the early 1900s during the fall of the Ottoman Empire and we quickly learn that an outbreak of the plague has spread from China and, as a result, various quarantine measures are implemented.\n\nWhen Sultan Abdul Hamid II sends his Royal Chemist, Bonkowski Pasha, to the island to help its citizens fight and contain the spread of the disease, heâs met with opposition and is soon murdered. We learn that the island and its inhabitants are living in a state of religious divide, with half the population being Muslim and the other half identifying as Orthodox Greek. News of the plague brings up feelings of tension and animosity between the two religious groups and, as a result, we see how the plague not only impacts the health of the citizens, but also the social and political workings of their bureaucracy.\n\nAfter the Pasha is murdered, the Prince Consort Doctor Nuri and his wife, Princess Pakize, are sent to the island to help solve his murder and assist in containing the outbreak.\n\nAs the story unfolded, I was completely engrossed by how these events mirrored many of our own recent experiences with the pandemic. And while this is a very dense book that reads like a historical account, itâs rich with cultural and political details that make it a compelling read.\n\nReviewed by Akina Hansen\n\nABOUT THE AUTHOR\n\nOrhan Pamuk was born in Istanbul in 1952 and grew up in a large family similar to those which he describes in his novels Cevdet Bey and His Sons and The Black Book, in the wealthy westernised district of Nisantasi. As he writes in his autobiographical book Istanbul, from his childhood until the age of 22 he devoted himself largely to painting and dreamed of becoming an artist.\n\nAfter graduating from the secular American Robert College in Istanbul, he studied architecture at Istanbul Technical University for three years, but abandoned the course when he gave up his ambition to become an architect and artist. He went on to graduate in journalism from Istanbul University, but never worked as a journalist. At the age of 23 Pamuk decided to become a novelist, and giving up everything else retreated into his flat and began to write.\n\nHis first novel Cevdet Bey and His Sons was published. Pamuk went to America, where he was a visiting scholar at Columbia University in New York from 1985 to 1988. It was there that he wrote most of his novel The Black Book. This novel was published in Turkey in 1990, and the French translation won the Prix France Culture.\n\nIn 2008 Pamuk published The Museum of Innocence, a novel about a man’s lifelong infatuation with a young woman and his attempt to build a museum housing the objects associated with his love. Pamuk opened the museum itself in 2012 in the Ãukurcuma neighborhood of Istanbul. The catalogue of the museum, The Innocence of Objects, was published the same year.\n\nApart from three years in New York, Orhan Pamuk has spent all his life in the same streets and district of Istanbul, and he now lives in the building where he was raised. Pamuk has been writing novels for 40 years and never done any other job except writing."
