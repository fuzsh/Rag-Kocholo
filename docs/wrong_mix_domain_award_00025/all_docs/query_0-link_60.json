        "text": "BERLIN -- Patrick Modiano, a French author known for his meditations on memory and identity in a Paris shaped by World War II, won the 2014 Nobel Prize in Literature.\n\nModiano, 69, was the child of a Jewish Italian father and Belgian mother who met in Paris during the German occupation, a history that influenced his writing. Published in 1968, his first novel, La Place de l'Etoile, examines anti-Semitism with a satirical lens.\n\nModiano won \"for the art of memory with which he has evoked the most ungraspable human destinies and uncovered the life-world of the occupation,\" the Swedish Academy said Thursday in a statement on its website.\n\nA prominent author in his native France though less frequently read outside the country, Modiano is celebrated for his long walks through Paris. The author knows the back streets intimately and places his books in the city, said Peter Englund, permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy. The author opens up corridors of time and space for a reader to walk through, he said.\n\n\"They are small books -- 130, 150 pages -- which are always variations of the same theme: about memory, about loss, about identity, about seeking,\" Englund said.\n\nThe academy hadn't been able to find Modiano, known for his avoidance of the media limelight, to notify him of the honor before the announcement, Englund said. Modiano's daughter eventually told him he'd won, the author told reporters at a news conference this afternoon.\n\nWinning the Nobel \"isn't something you expect,\" he said. \"You feel a bit like you're sleepwalking.\"\n\nModiano compared the creative process itself to \"sort of a dream, fed by everyday life,\" a reverie that needs to be made real.\n\nModiano doesn't write with geopolitics in mind, and his work is \"anchored in his own autobiography,\" said Nathalie Crom, head of the literature department at French cultural magazine Telerama and one of the most recent interviewers of Modiano. Crom described the author as soft-spoken, kind and reserved, as precise in his speech as in his written words.\n\n\"The Nobel jury's choice is a good surprise because it shows the more singular literature can be, the more universal it can be,\" Crom said. \"To me, he is a poet. Each one of his books is the new stanza of a bigger poem.\"\n\nModiano's other books include Missing Person, the story of a detective who has lost his memory and must turn his sleuthing skills to uncovering his true identity; Night Rounds; and Trace of Malice. His most recent novel is this year's Pour Que Tu Ne Te Perdes Pas Dans le Quartier, and he has also written children's books and film scripts.\n\nLast year's Nobel literature prize went to Alice Munro, whose short stories chart the interior lives of her fellow Canadians. Winners in the past decade have included Peruvian writer and literary critic Mario Vargas Llosa in 2010 and Turkish author Orhan Pamuk in 2006.\n\nThe $1.1 million prize was created in the will of Alfred Nobel and first awarded in 1901. Nobel, the Swedish inventor of dynamite, also set up awards for achievements in medicine, physics, chemistry and peace.\n\nThis year marks the 107th time the Nobel for literature has been awarded. Other winners have included John Steinbeck, J.M. Coetzee and Naguib Mahfouz.\n\nA Section on 10/10/2014"
