This top-notch spaghetti western co-stars screen great Eli Wallach (The Good, the Bad and the Ugly) as Cacopoulos, who takes $300,000 from two hombres of questionable moral fiber, then proceeds to spread the cash around generously. His victims follow his trail, but when the men finally do meet, they must join forces to defend themselves against a murderous desperado. Before that battle is over, Cacopoulos has once again absconded with the cash, and the chase is on, ultimately leading them to a crooked Mississippi gaming house, a blazing gun battle and lots of money for everyone. Co-starring action-comedy super-duo Terence Hill (Man of the East) and Bud Spencer (Crime Busters) with Brock Peters (Soylent Green) and Kevin McCarthy (Invasion of the Body Snatchers). Written and Directed by Giuseppe Colizzi (God Forgives… I Don’t!, Boot Hill, All the Way Boys).
