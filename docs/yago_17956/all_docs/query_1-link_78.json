        "text": "Bud Spencer and Terence Hill, between a scazzotata and a plate of beans, all the cult scenes that made them immortal (photos, video)\n\nBy Alberto Forno\n\nGod Forgives… I Don’t!\n\n1967 Dio perdona… io no!, Regia di Giuseppe Colizzi\n\nCarlo Pedersoli and Mario Girotti met for the first time on the set of the movie “God forgives ... I Don’t!” 1967. It was an absolutely random encounter; former Olympic swiming champion Pedersoli, whose figure had appeared in some films only as a cameo, had in fact no intention of becoming an actor full-time; little difference was paid to the the future which connected him to Girotti that had not even been taken into account. The lead role of the film was meant in fact to Peter Martell, born Pietro Martellanza, who broke his foot at an earlier recording session; the film's director Giuseppe Colizzi thus was forced to return to Rome from 'Almeria, Spain, the perfect location to shoot western movies, and that was how he chose the new main protagonist.\n\nThe presentation in the poster of the film was suggested to the two actors to change their names - it took the view that they were too Italian, and had used them previously so they could break through at international level; the \"Americanized\" names, in addition, would give a different flavor to the work and characters. Carlo Pedersoli Bud Spencer chose as a pseudonym in tribute to his favorite actor, Spencer Tracy, and a beer he was drinking a Bud. Mario Girotti, selecting two of the twenty names of a list presented to him the night before, became Terence Hill, also because of his love for the playwright Terence (Hill studied ancient literature). The film was a huge success; It was enough that Colizzi, who noted the consensus immediately collected from the public, to realize the enormous potential of the duo, with whom he returned to collaborate on two new films.\n\nIn this epic scene the two \"start\" to beating each other and thrashing ... how he's wrong?\n\n[To be continued tomorrow]"
