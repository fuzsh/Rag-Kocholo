        "text": "\"Ace High\" is a 1968 Spaghetti Western directed by Giuseppe Colizzi. The film the inserted middle piece in a trilogy of films by the director, specifically starring Terrence Hill as the character of \"Cat Stevens\" and Bud Spencer as \"Hutch Bessy\". Starting with the film, \"God Forgives... I Don't!\" (1967), followed by this film and then \"Boot Hill\" (1969), I actually had no clue I was stepping into the middle of a trilogy when starting this film. Regardless, the films are pretty episodic in their own way and easily broken apart for individual consumption. That being said, I actually found out about the connection with the other two films after watching it, so anyone can step into this thing. I…\n\nHaving birthed their partnership with inspiration from The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly - director Giuseppe Colizzi taps The Ugly himself to join the Hill & Spencer team. While Bud Spencer's character seems to have lost his ethical stance, numerous references by Terence Hill to the villain of God Forgives... I Don't! (1967) makes this a direct sequel. Having gained a small fortune in the last film, it takes little time for their wealth to be stolen, and in trying to retrieve it they become caught up with an ex-convict (Wallach) looking for revenge on the gang that left him to rot in prison. Wallach's amoral comic relief, and perpetual double crosses, will remind and appeal to fans of his…\n\nKind of a trippy spaghetti western with Eli Wallach riding between Terence Hill and Bud Spencer and robbing them of gold they earned from bounty hunting as a roundabout way to bring them into his plot to get even with outlaws who escaped at his expense and let him serve fifteen years of hard labor. This kind of patiently waiting for fifteen years to get even is a part that fits Wallach really well. He's not quite the cutthroat but he's still got the unpredictability. Spencer and Hill kind of fit in with this as legit bounty hunters who kind of want to kill Wallach for robbing them but gradually grow to like the guy while still kind of wanting…\n\nAfter narrowly escaping his own hanging cunning Cacopoulos (Eli Wallach) robbed horses and resources from two small timer (Terence Hill and Bud Spencer) who were on their one last job. And of course like any reseasonable person they chased after him to get all their fortune back, but soon struck up unlikely alliance with Cacopoulos in his quest of revenge in searching the people who framed him of a crime and put him in jail 15 years ago.\n\nI watched the first part of Giuseppe Colizzi self-titled trilogy; God Forgives... I Don't many moons ago and I remembered ended up enjoying that one so much but reading reviews afterwards I saw some ppl calling Ace High a rehash of the…\n\nSpoilers ahead.\n\nGiuseppe Colizzi's 1967 film God Forgives ... I Don't! stands as the twelfth most profitable spaghetti western of all time, status achieved on the back of a strong story and, more importantly, the unexpected chemistry between stars Terrence Hill (playing Cat Stevens) and Bud Spencer (Hutch Bessy). Hoping to build upon that success, Colizzi co-wrote, co-produced, and directed a sequel during the following year: Ace High. Despite being too long (it runs just over two hours), the film surpassed the profits of its predecessor (Ace High is eleventh in those all-time box office rankings), a clear confirmation of the box office power of the Spencer-Hill pairing.* That said, however, the success of this film as a piece of…\n\n“Our old friend died with his boots off.”\n\nA spaghetti western in which I can say to myself “I know that guy is about to get punched” and then that guy gets punched.\n\nThe second film in Giuseppe Colizzi’s Cat Stevens Trilogy (I don’t know if that’s what it’s actually called), Ace High continues directly where God Forgives left off, following Cat (Terence Hill) and Hutch (Bud Spencer) as they bring Bill San Antonio’s empty boots and a wagon full of gold into El Paso. Whereas Frank Wolff played the clear bad guy in God Forgives, Eli Wallach is too much of a tweener to play his role here as a typical heel. Those who know him from Leone’s films…\n\nEli Wallach reprises his impish clown persona from The Good, The Bad and The Ugly, and it's a gift because it never gets old. He litters the film with great sequences, including his poignant recount of the birth of his father and a moment where he cheats at cards in the style of W. C. Fields. Suffice to say, as with The Good, The Bad and The Ugly, he steals the picture. Terence Hill, Bud Spencer and (for some reason) Brock Peters don't offer much of a challenge, though Hill and Spencer are not too slapstick at this stage in their careers and Spencer is in pretty good form. The only actor with any hope of standing up to Wallach…\n\nThe comedy duo of handsome straight man Terence Hill and bull-in-a-china-shop Bud Spencer meet up with Eli Wallach, the star of The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly himself. Brock Peters shows up as a circus acrobat, and Kevin McCarthy makes a brief appearance as a villain. Given the cast that's involved, this spaghetti western is a bit disappointing. Hill and Spencer parody the laconic heroes of the genre to such an over-exaggerated extent that they barely say anything and practically move in slow motion. Meanwhile, Wallach talks a mile a minute, spouting out aphorisms of outlaw wisdom and lengthy stories that never seem to go anywhere. The first hour of the film is difficult to follow. The second half,…"
