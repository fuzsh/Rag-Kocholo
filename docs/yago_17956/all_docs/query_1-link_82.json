        "text": "The late Bud Spencer was a joy to be around, on-screen partner Terence Hill said at his friend's funeral Thursday at Rome's so-called Church of the Artists.\n\n\"Bud was a joy and I already know that when next we meet, his first words will be 'you and I never had a fight',\" said a visibly moved Hill.\n\n\"Every time we met or I went over to his house for spaghetti, Bud would remind me we never had a fight,\" he went on. \"The reason is that we respected and loved one another, and always had a good time together\".\n\nHill also recounted how he first met Spencer on the set of the 1967 Spaghetti Western film written and directed by Giuseppe Colizzi 'God Forgives... I Don't!' Spencer, whose real name was Carlo Pedersoli, died aged 86 Monday afternoon in Rome. Born on October 31, 1929, in Naples, Spencer moved to Rome to become a star of Spaghetti Westerns and comedies.\n\nHe played in over 130 films from the 1950s to the 2000s, including the blockbuster They Call Me Trinity (1970), together with co-star Hill. They pair went on to make many successful films together.\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED Â© Copyright ANSA"
