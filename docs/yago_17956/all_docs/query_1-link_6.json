        "text": "Roguish lives on the frontier can only end on Boot Hill, which brings Colizzi's trilogy of Hill & Spencer westerns to a close. An amazing cast sees Hill befriend a travelling circus which includes Woody Strode and Lionel Stander - upon getting them tied up with cutthroat killers - Hill turns to Spencer and his sidekick George Eastman, before having their odd travelling company attempt to save a mining town from the evil business interests of Victor Buono.\n\nFor the end of a trilogy, the bulk of the comraderie is between Hill and Strode, with Spencer only entering the picture during the second half. Though playing the same parts, nothing suggests character growth. Memorable stuntmen (like Romano Puppo) make up Buono's…\n\n“Look’s like our vacations over.”\n\nThe third and final film in Giuseppe Colizzi’s Cat Stevens trilogy (that reminds me - I still have to review Ace High) may be missing the presence of Eli Wallach, but it’s nothing that Terence Hill and Bud Spencer can’t make up for in this strangely alluring Western, which just like the previous installment, has some very interesting use of comedy as opposed to the dramatic tale God Forgives... I Don’t! possessed back in ‘67.\n\nThe plot follows the victims of a small oppressive town, which is largely controlled by the powerful Honey Fisher (Victor Buono); through murder and swindling, Fisher and his gang have gained leases on the gold-yielding land in the area. Luckily for…\n\nBoot Hill is comfortably the best of Giuseppe Colizzi's trilogy of films about Cat Stevens (Terrence Hill) and Hutch Bessy (Bud Spencer), perhaps because it's the warmest of the three, a reality that casts a ray of hope in the midst of an undeniably dark world.\n\nThe film drops us right into the action, opening with Stevens being pursued at night by gunmen, scenes which are crosscut with performances at a circus that is going on simultaneously in the same town. We have no idea what Stevens has done to run afoul of the gunmen, nor do we have any idea who we're supposed to care about the in circus scenes, but Colizzi brings them together the next morning, when…\n\n“You’re the real clown.”\n\nThe Cat Stevens Trilogy comes to a close with Boot Hill, a film which opens with Stevens (Terrence Hill) outsmarted and bleeding out behind the circus tent. It’s a strange and downbeat film to end on, made even the more confounding when you read about the behind the scenes machinations: apparently Romolo Guerrieri was slated to direct, and actually shot most (if not all) of the scenes inside the circus, but when he was fired, Giuseppe Colizzi had to figure out a way to integrate said scenes into the story. Which partly explains some of the odd cross-cutting and the somewhat discombobulated editing. I had to pull up the wiki synopsis several times to help explain…"
