        "text": "BOTH Giuseppe Colizzi's \"Ace High,\" an Italian Western, and Peter Collinson's \"The Italian Job,\" a British caper comedy set mostly in Italy, are types of movies that have been made before—very often and much better—by other people. The double feature opened yesterday at the Forum and other theaters.\"The Italian Job\" is the preparation and execution of a plan to steal $4-million in gold from an armored car in the center of Turin. Michael Caine plays the young man who carries out the plan and Noël Coward, apparently not in the pink of health, is the syndicate chief who oversees the plan from a London prison. Although the movie means to be kind to Coward, it exploits him in vaguely unpleasant ways, including décor. His prison cell is decorated with pictures of the same royal family that, in real life, has never seen fit to knight him.The film is technically sophisticated and emotionally retarded. It aspires to humor in references to Coward's toilet habits and to Caine's sexual promiscuity, shown obliquely in his physical exhaustion after various off-screen encounters. The movie takes positive joy only in the destruction of automobiles, seven of which, for one reason and another, are pushed off Alpine precipices. I'm not quite sure why, but there is something immensely satisfying in the sight of a brand-new car, rolling end-over-end-down a mountain, gradually disintegrating and turning back into its component parts.\"Ace High\" is neo-Sergio Leone, a revenge Western whose incomprehensible narrative complexity results only partially from the dubbed English dialogue. It stars Eli Wallach as a comic badman of notable antecedents. \"My grandfather,\" he says, \"was Greek, like Sophocles and Plato.\" Wallach often looks like Buddy Hackett, but other characters describe him as a modern Jesus, so it's difficult to know when Colizzi is kidding.The Clint Eastwood role is played by Terence Hill who, according to a helpful program note, \"changed his name from Mario Girotti to avoid confusion with another Italian actor, Massimo Girotti (no relation).\" Wallach and Hill have very blue eyes and fine teeth. There is hardly one full set of teeth among all the other people in the cast, which is, I suppose, one way of stimulating authentic Western atmosphere.\n\nTHE ITALIAN JOB, screenplay by Troy Kennedy Martin; directed by Peter Collinson; produced by Michael Deeley; released by Paramount Pictures Corporation.
