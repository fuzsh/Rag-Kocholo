        "text": "The years that follow the end of World War II mark a unique historical-political situation shared by India and Italy. The debate in both nations looks at cinematic neo-realism as the regenerating force capable of leading towards a renewed cultural life after the events of decolonization and partition on the one side, and the disasters of fascism and the destructions of the war on the other. Neo-realism is seen as the best possible choice for intellectuals and film-makers in both countries. The new role of the artist suggested by the works of Italian neo-realism (especially Bicycle Thieves [De Sica, 1948]) is perceived by Indian intellectuals as the right solution for the renewal. This article searches for references and stylistic echoes found in the complex body of Indian cinema. The methodological approach of the article, therefore, relies both on intertextuality and on the analysis of some writings where one finds reference to views and concepts on cinema clearly inspired by the strategies and the ideology of Italian neo-realism.\n\nThe concept of transnational post-Westerns stems from Neil Campbell’s definition of post-Westerns as films “coming after and going beyond the traditional Western [genre] while engaging with and commenting on its deeply haunting assumptions and values.” Although Westerns started out as a national genre, it is well known that they soon became a transnational phenomenon, which was received and interpreted differently in a variety of national contexts. Once Westerns nearly disappeared from mainstream cinema, post-Westerns exploiting their heritage appeared throughout the world, applying their assumptions and values to specific national environments. These films are transnational post-Westerns, and they share, among others, the following features: clear references to the Western genre, the choice of a specific area away from the American West, the use of that new landscape with a political intention, and the analysis of the difficulties of integration of racial, ethnic or social minorities, the “contemporary Others” equivalent to Native Americans in Westerns. This article centers on a specific feature of transnational post-Westerns, their focus on the national identity and foundational myths and contemporary contradictions of the country where these films are set and produced. Following the example of Doris Sommer’s “Foundational Fictions,” this paper analyzes transnational post-Westerns from three different European countries (Into the West from Ireland; Curro Jiménez, 800 balas, and No habrá paz para los malvados from Spain; Les Cowboys and Adieu Gary from France) that use references from American Westerns to deconstruct and problematize the different features of their own national foundational myths.\n\nAcross many of the travelogues on the Italian South produced by northern European writers, both the prickly pear and the agave emerge as coextensive, in identitarian terms, with the South. Both the prickly pear and the agave are, in fact, plants indigenous to the Americas and they only made their way to the Italian South following the colonisation of the New World. In this essay, I examine the effaced history of colonial economies of occupation, plunder and commercial transport that underpins the existence of these two plants in the Italian South. I then proceed to examine the complex and interlayered systems of signification that, in turn, inscribe these plants in the context of Sergio Leone’s Spaghetti Westerns. Leone’s Spaghetti Westerns, I contend, must be read as metafigural allegories that bring into focus the complex entanglement of colonialism, race, civil war and contradictory identitarian politics."
