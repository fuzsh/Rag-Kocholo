        "text": "Italian actor Bud Spencer has died aged 86.\n\nThe burly star, who became known as the 'big friendly giant' on screen, appeared in dozens of spaghetti westerns, such as the 1971 film Trinity Is Still My Name, which is among Italy's all-time top-grossing titles.\n\nBud, whose real name was Carlo Pedersoli, died \"peacefully\" at his home in Rome on Monday, his son Guiseppe Perdersoli said in a statement.\n\nHis screenwriter son did not specify the cause of death.\n\nThe Naples-born actor first found fame as an Olympic swimmer - competing in 1952 and 1956 - after becoming the first Italian to swim the 100-metre freestyle in less than one minute.\n\nAfter finding fame as an athlete, the star moved into movies and in the late 1960s, as his acting career was taking off, he changed his name to Bud Spencer - in homage to Budweiser beer and Spencer Tracy.\n\nHe also reportedly thought it was ironic to call himself Bud despite his Herculean physique which made him known to his fans as \"the big friendly giant\" of the screen.\n\nBud began taking on small parts, such as playing the Praetorian Guard in MGM epic Quo Vadis, shot in Rome's Cinecitta Studios, and subsequently appeared in strictly local potboilers.\n\nAfter changing his name, the actor teamed up with fellow Italian Terence Hill, whose real name is Mario Girotti, in 1967 and that was the game-changer in both of their careers.\n\nThey starred in the Giuseppe Colizzi-directed Western God Forgives...I Don't, which was followed in 1968 by Ace High, which also starred Eli Wallach.\n\nShortly after came They Call Me Trinity, in 1970, which became Italy's top grossing title - a record they beat the following year with Trinity is Still My Name, which was directed by Enzo Barboni.\n\nThe so-called spaghetti westerns - westerns made cheaply in Europe for the international market - gained the duo legions of fans abroad, especially in Germany.\n\n\"He was an actor whom Italian cinema needs to thank because he took Italian movies around the world,\" Fox Italy president Osvaldo De Santis told Sky.\n\nDuring the 1980s and 90s, Bud had an active solo career in Italian TV, including series the Big Man, Extralarge and, in 2010, I Delitti del Cuoco.\n\nIn 2005 Spencer briefly entered politics after then-Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi asked him to run as a regional councillor but he was not elected.\n\nHe is survived by his wife Maria Amato and three children, Giuseppe, Christine, and Diamy."
