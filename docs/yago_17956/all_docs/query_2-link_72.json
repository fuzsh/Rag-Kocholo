        "meta_description": "Vintage postcard. <b>Mario Girotti</b> a.k.a. Terence Hill in <i>Io Sto Con Gli Ippopotami/I'm for the Hippopotamus</i> (Italo Zingarelli, 1979).\n\t\n\tBlond and blue-eyed <b>Mario Girotti</b> (1939) is better known as <b>Terence Hill</b>. The Italian actor starred in multiple action films and spaghetti westerns. In 19 of these films, he appeared with his partner Bud Spencer. Their success made him one of the highest-paid European film stars.\n\t\n\tMario Girotti was born in Venice, Italy, in 1939. His mother Hildegard Thieme was German, and his father was Girolamo Girotti an Italian chemist. As a child, he lived in the small town of Lommatzsch, near Dresden, Germany, from 1943 to 1945. During World War II, he survived the Dresden Bombing by the Allies. Back in Italy and Rome, one of his hobbies was swimming. He swam for the Roman team Lazio and even won a bronze medal. During practice, he often met Bud Spencer, still known as Carlo Pedersoli, who swam for the same team. Terence also enjoyed rowing and won a silver medal with his rowing team. Italian filmmaker Dino Risi discovered him at a swimming meet and he made his first film at the age of 12, Vacanze col Gangster /Vacation With a  Gangster (Dino Risi, 1951). He continued acting to finance his studies in classical literature at the University of Rome and his motorcycle. He appeared in 27 Italian films including Gli sbandati/ Abandoned (Francesco Maselli, 1955). He landed a supporting role in Luchino Visconti's masterpiece Il Gattopardo/The Leopard (Luchino Visconti, 1963) based on the novel by Giuseppe Tomasi Di Lampedusa and starring Burt Lancaster, Claudia Cardinale and Alain Delon. The film was a big success and Girotti left university to become a full-time actor. He signed a contract with producer Horst Wendtland for a series of adventure films and Westerns in Germany. Hill can speak German fluently and appeared in the popular Euro-westerns Winnetou - 2. Teil/Winnetou: Last of the Renegades (Harald Reinl, 1964), Unter Geiern/Among Vultures (Alfred Vohrer, 1964), Der Ölprinz/Rampage at Apache Wells (Harald Philipp, 1965) and Old Surehand/Flaming Frontier (Alfred Vohrer, 1965), all based on the Winnetou and Old Shatterhand-novels by German author Karl May. He also appeared in the fantasy epic Die Nibelungen/Those Whom the Gods Wish to Destroy (Harald Reinl, 1966), a remake of the classic silent film by Fritz Lang.\n\t\n\tIn 1967, Mario Girotti returned to Italy to act in the Spaghetti Western Dio perdona... Io no!/God Forgives, I don't (Giuseppe Colizzi, 1968). While on location in Almeria, Spain, he married an American girl of Bavarian descent, Lori Zwicklbauer, who was the dialogue coach for the picture. Girotti changed his name to Terence Hill. The name was made up, as a publicity stunt, by the film producers. Girotti had 24 hours to choose from a list of twenty names and picked the one with his mother's initials (Hildegard Thieme). The producers told the public that ‘Hill’ was his wife's name for publicity reasons. At this time of upcoming feminism, a man who took his wife's name was special. His co-star was Carlo Pedersoli who was renamed Bud Spencer. Both actors had participated in the film Annibale/Hannibal (Carlo Ludovico Bragaglia, Edgar G. Ulmer, 1959) but had never met on the set since they always appeared in different scenes. Dio perdona... Io no! became the film with the highest number of spectators in Italian cinemas, and stayed so until 1986. Director Giuseppe Colizzi called both actors for the sequels I quattro dell’Ave Maria/Ace High (1968, Giuseppe Colizzi) and La collina degli stivali/Boot Hill (1969, Giuseppe Colizzi). Together, they starred in 17 Spaghetti Westerns and comic action films. Their films were incredibly successful in Italy but also abroad. Possibly their most famous film is the Western Lo chiamavano Trinità/They Call Me Trinity (Enzo Barboni a.k.a. E.B. Clucher, 1971). Here Terence showed his talent as a comedian for the first time. Director  Barboni had invented the characters Trinity and Bambino, the two protagonists of the films. The smart charmer Hill and dumb heavyweight Spencer were a hilariously funny team, which returned in the sequel Continuavano a chiamarlo Trinità/Trinity Is STILL My Name! (Enzo Barboni, 1972). All their films contain the typical bar fights with people flying everywhere and lots of hilarious cheap jokes. According to his official website, Hill’s favourite film is Il mio nome è Nessuno/My Name Is Nobody (Tonino Valerii and, uncredited, Sergio Leone, 1973), in which he co-starred with Henry Fonda. Terence plays a young, mysterious loner named Nobody who tries his hardest to make his ageing outlaw hero go out in a blaze of glory.\n\t \n\tIn 1976 Hollywood called. Terence Hill appeared in March or Die (Dirk Richards, 1977) with Gene Hackman and Catherine Deneuve, and he starred in Mr. Billion (Jonathan Kaplan, 1977) with Valerie Perrine. Since then he divided his time between Italy and the US. He directed and produced himself in the remake Don Camillo (1983), and in Lucky Luke (1991), a mediocre adaptation of the famous cartoon by Morris &amp; Goscinny. After the actioner Cyberflic (Antonio Margheriti, 1997), Hill began a successful television career in Italy. In 2000, he landed the leading role in the Italian television series Don Matteo (2000-2022), as a crime-fighting parish priest. For his performance of 'Don Matteo', he received the 'Outstanding Actor of the Year' award at the 42nd International Television Festival of Monte Carlo. The series lasted for 276 episodes. He returned to the Western with the TV film Doc West (Giulio Base, Terence Hill, 2009) with Paul Sorvino and Ornella Muti. Terence Hill lives in Massachusetts. He also starred in the TV series Un passo dal cielo (2011-2015). He returned to the cinema in the drama My Name Is Thomas (Terence Hill, 2018). This film was released about two years after Bud Spencer died. In the end credits, there is the dedication, &quot;Al mio amico Bud&quot; (To my friend Bud). Terence Hill and his wife Lori had two sons, Jesse (1969) and their adopted son Ross (1973). Ross was killed in a car accident in New Mexico in 1990 while Hill was preparing to film Lucky Luke on the Bonanza Creek Ranch near Santa Fe.\n\t\n\tSources: Klaus Bobacz (IMDb), Sandra Brennan (AllMovie), TerenceHill.com, SpencerHill.de (German), Wikipedia and IMDb. \n\t\n\t<b>And, please check out our blog <a href=\"http://filmstarpostcards.blogspot.com/\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow\">European Film Star Postcards</a>.</b>",
