        "text": "1. Spaghetti Westerns of Hill & Spencer Harlan D. Whatley Graduate Student – English The University of Texas at the Permian Basin\n\n2. The Spaghetti Westerns of Hill & Spencer Terence Hill (Mario Girotti)  In 1968, Mario Girotti changed his name to Terence Hill.  Known for his blue eyes, acrobatic scenes and recurring presence on Italian TV.  During the height of his popularity Hill was among Italy's highest-paid actors.  Acted in five Spaghetti Westerns with Bud Spencer.\n\n3. The Spaghetti Westerns of Hill & Spencer Bud Spencer (Carlo Pedersoli)  Carlo Pedersoli was an Olympic athlete famous for his grunting, wild beard and big bodily size.  He is known for action-comedy roles with his long-time film partner Terence Hill.  The duo garnered world acclaim and attracted millions of viewers.  Spencer and Hill appeared in, produced and directed over 20 films together.\n\n4. Giuseppe Colizzi trilogy  God Forgives... I Don’t! (1967)  Ace High (1968)  Boot Hill (1969)\n\n5. Giuseppe Colizzi (1925 – 1978)  Often used circuses in the plot and setting of his films  Strong sense of Bondesque style  Terence Hill and Bud Spencer are in all his Westerns  Carlo Rustichelli scores\n\n6. God Forgives ... I Don’t! (1967) Dio perdona... io no!  A violent, sadistic thriller-western, highly influenced by Sergio Leone.  The working title was Il Gatto, il Cane & la Volpe (The Cat, the Dog & the Fox).  Terence Hill plays “Cat” and Bud Spencer is “Hutch.”  The script is quite intricate and demands all viewers’ attention.  There are a few lulls, but the film is well-directed and beautifully shot.  Although Hill and Spencer are not really used as a duo yet, there are a few sparks of chemistry, foreshadowing some of the great things to come, but the film belongs to Frank Wolff as the red-headed Bill San Antonio, one of the genre’s great villains.\n\n7. Ace High (1968)  The film has Leone influences.  A gambling scene in the film is based on the American novel The Hoods by Harry Grey, which was Colizzi’s favorite novel.  The film’s main problem is that the different story motives don’t harmonize.  The grand finale is a wonderful scene that is both exciting and bizarre.  It has the four protagonists facing McCarthy’s gang, in the middle of his casino, over the bodies of the visitors who have dived to the floor in fear, an orchestra playing a gentle waltz in the background.\n\n8. Boot Hill (1969)  Cat Stevens is wounded in an ambush by the mining company's men who want his claim.  Cat hides out with a travelling circus, but when one of theirs is killed by the company's henchmen, former gunfighter Thomas joins up with Cat.  They then fetch Hutch Bessy and his deaf mute sidekick to get even with the company and avenge the murder of the acrobat.  This is the weakest of the Colizzi trilogy.\n\n9. Trinity films They Call Me Trinity(1970) Trinity Is Still My Name (1971)\n\n10. E.B. Clucher (Enzo Barboni) 1922 - 2002  Born in Rome, Clucher served as a war correspondent in World War II.  He worked as a camera operator from 1942 to 1961.  They Call Me Trinity was his first Spaghetti Western film in 1970.  Trinity Is Still My Name! (1971) is the fifth highest grossing Italian film.  He continued to make slapstick comedies with Hill and Spencer.\n\n11. They Call Me Trinity (1970)  This film created the subgenre of the comedy spaghetti western.  The comedy western would be referred to as fagioli westerns.  This is the story of two men coming to the aid of a defenseless group of people who are threatened by a corrupt land owner.  Trinity (Terence Hill) is a good-for-nothing, lazy and ever-smiling gunslinger who accidently discovers that his fat, grumpy, horse-thieving brother Bambino (Bud Spencer) has become the sheriff of a small western town.  Hill and Spencer had discovered that audiences loved the contrast between the blue-eyed Casanova and the grumpy fatso, so this was emphasized.\n\n12. They Call Me Trinity (1970) Gunslingers\n\n13. Trinity Is Still My Name (1971)  While the opening scene paid homage to Leone (and probably Corbucci), the homecoming scene pays homage to John Ford: the father is played by Ford actor Harry Carey Jr. and even though there are some bad table manners on display, the circle of the family is presented as a safe haven in the wild west.  The film's highlight is a scene that was not in the original script but improvised by Hill and Spencer. It's set in a posh French restaurant and has all the broad and irresistible humor the movies are famous for.  When Trinity is Still My Name was released, it broke all the records and became the most successful Italian western movie ever.\n\n14. Trinity is Still My Name (1971) - French restaurant scene\n\n15. Conclusion  Known as the Abbot and Costello of spaghetti westerns, Hill and Spencer pioneered the subgenre known as the Spaghetti Western comedy or fagioli western.  Their cinematic and television career extended far beyond the spaghetti western film genre.  They went on to become two of Italy’s highest paid actors and acted in 19 films together."
