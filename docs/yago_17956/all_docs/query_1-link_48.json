        "text": "\"Mario Girotti\" redirects here. For the Alpini general, see Mario Girotti (general).\n\nTerence Hill (born Mario Girotti; 29 March 1939) is an Italian actor, film director, screenwriter and producer. He began his career as a child actor and gained international fame for starring roles in action and comedy films, many with longtime film partner and friend Bud Spencer. During the height of his popularity, Hill was among Italy's highest-paid actors.\n\nHis most widely seen films include comic and standard spaghetti Westerns, some based on popular novels by German author Karl May about the Wild West. Of these, the most famous are Lo chiamavano Trinità (They Call Me Trinity, 1970); …continuavano a chiamarlo Trinità (Trinity Is Still My Name, 1971), the highest grossing Italian film at that time; and Il mio nome è Nessuno (My Name Is Nobody, 1973), co-starring Henry Fonda. Hill, whose stage name was the product of a publicity stunt by film producers, also went on to a successful television career in Italy, playing the title character in the long-running Rai 1 series Don Matteo from 2000 until 2021.\n\nEarly life\n\nHill was born on 29 March 1939 in Venice, Italy. Hill's mother, Hildegard Girotti (née Thieme), was German, from Dresden; his father, Girolamo Girotti, was Italian, and a chemist by occupation.\n\nDuring his childhood, Hill lived in the small town of Lommatzsch, Saxony. He was there up to the end of World War II, and survived the Bombing of Dresden.\n\nCareer\n\nChild actor\n\nHe was discovered by Italian filmmaker Dino Risi at a swimming meet at the age of 12, and he became a child actor, appearing in Risi's Vacation with a Gangster (1951) as Gianni the orphan gang leader. \"They were looking for a boy gang leader and they found me,\" he later said.\n\nHe had small roles in Voice of Silence (1953) with Jean Marais, Too Young for Love (1953), and It Happened in the Park (1953).\n\nHe was in Golden Vein (1954) with Märta Torén and Richard Basehart, The Abandoned (1955) and Folgore Division (1955).\n\nLeading man\n\nGirotti had his first lead in Guaglione (1956). He could also be seen in Mamma sconosciuta (1956), I vagabondi delle stelle (1956), La grande strada azzurra (1956) with Yves Montand and Alida Valli, and Lazzarella (1957).\n\nGirotti did Anna of Brooklyn (1958) with Gina Lollobrigida, The Sword and the Cross (1958) with Yvonne de Carlo (playing Lazarus of Bethany), and a TV version of The Picture of Dorian Gray (1958).\n\nHe had support parts in Il padrone delle ferriere (1959) with Virna Lisi, Juke box - Urli d'amore (1959), and Hannibal (1959) with Victor Mature and Carlo Pedersoli, who would later become known as Bud Spencer. Girotti had the lead roles in Spavaldi e innamorati (1959) and Cerasella (1959), a teen comedy.\n\nIt was back to support roles with Carthage in Flames (1960), Un militare e mezzo (1960), and The Story of Joseph and His Brethren (1961) with Geoffrey Horne and Robert Morley, directed by Irving Rapper.\n\nGirotti had support parts in The Wonders of Aladdin (1961) with Donald O'Connor and directed by Henry Levin and Mario Bava, Pecado de amor (1961), Seven Seas to Calais (1962) with Rod Taylor, and The Shortest Day (1963).\n\nGirotti secured a substantial supporting role in Luchino Visconti's film epic The Leopard (1963) alongside Burt Lancaster and Alain Delon, in which he unsuccessfully tries to court the daughter of Lancaster's character. During this time he studied classical literature for three years at an Italian university.\n\nGermany\n\nIn 1964, he returned to Germany and there appeared in a series of Heimatfilme, adventure and Western films, based on novels by German author Karl May. These included Last of the Renegades (1964) with Lex Barker; three films with Stewart Granger, Amongst Vultures (1964), The Oil Prince (1965) and Old Surehand (1965); Shots in 3/4 Time (1965); Duel at Sundown (1965) with Peter Van Eyck; Call of the Forest (1965), an Austrian movie; Die Nibelungen, Teil 1 - Siegfried (1965) and Die Nibelungen, Teil 2 - Kriemhilds Rache (1967).\n\nIn 1967, he returned to Italy to make Io non protesto, io amo (1967), co starring Caterina Caselli.\n\nBud Spencer\n\nSee also: Terence Hill and Bud Spencer\n\nGirotti then appeared alongside Bud Spencer (then known as Carlo Pedersoli) in Giuseppe Colizzi's spaghetti Western God Forgives... I Don't! (1967). At the time cast and crew in Westerns frequently adopted American names to give the film a better chance of selling in non-Italian speaking countries; Girotti changed his name to \"Terence Hill\". He picked the name from a list of 20 he was given, the story about using his wife's name was a publicity idea. The film was a huge hit – the most popular film of the year in Italy – and established him as a star.\n\nHill followed it with a musicarello, The Crazy Kids of the War (1967) with Rita Pavone, then did a Western, Django, Prepare a Coffin (1968) for director Ferdinando Baldi, a sequel to Django (1966) with Hill playing the role done by Franco Nero in the original; it co-starred Horst Frank and George Eastman (and would be featured, much later, at the 64th Venice Film Festival, in 2007).\n\nHill was a leading man in a musical Western Crazy Westerners (1968), again with Rita Pavone, then was reunited with Spencer in Ace High (1968), a sequel to God Forgives with a cast including several American actors such as Eli Wallach. Hill did The Tough and the Mighty (1968), a biopic of Graziano Mesina, then a second sequel to God Forgives, Boot Hill (1969), co-starring Spencer and Woody Strode.\n\nHill did The Wind's Fierce (1970) then had a huge hit with Spencer with the comedy Western They Call Me Trinity (1971). Hill did a swashbuckler, Blackie the Pirate (1971), in which Spencer had a small role; they reteamed properly for a Trinity sequel, Trinity Is Still My Name (1972). It was even more popular than the original and had a successful release in the USA.\n\nHill did a modern-day crime drama The Hassled Hooker (1972) and a comedy Western without Spencer, Man of the East (1972). He and Spencer did ... All the Way, Boys! (1972), their first non-Western though it was still a comic adventure film.\n\nInternational films\n\nHill has stated in interviews that My Name Is Nobody (1973), in which he co-starred with Henry Fonda, is his personal favorite of all his films. The film was based on an idea by Sergio Leone.\n\nHill again starred with Spencer in Watch Out, We're Mad (1974) and Two Missionaries (1974) then without him in the spaghetti Western A Genius, Two Partners and a Dupe (1975). He moved from Italy to live in the US and settled in Stockbridge, Massachusetts, in the Berkshires.\n\nDino De Laurentiis cast Hill in his first English-language film, Mr. Billion (1977), directed by Jonathan Kaplan for 20th Century Fox, co-starring Valerie Perrine and Jackie Gleason. It was a box office flop.\n\nAfter returning to Italy for Crime Busters (1977) with Spencer, Hill then made another English-language movie, March or Die (1977), an $8 million French Foreign Legion tale for Lew Grade, co starring Gene Hackman and Catherine Deneuve. It was a box office disappointment.\n\nDespite his fluency in Italian and English, Hill was usually dubbed by other actors in both languages. In the Italian versions of his films, various actors provided his voice until the late 1960s, where he was primarily dubbed by Sergio Graziani; he was voiced by Pino Locchi from 1970 to 1983, and by Michele Gammino from 1983 to 1996. For English dubs, Lloyd Battista dubbed him in six films, including the \"Cat Stevens and Hutch Bessy\" trilogy, while Roger Browne dubbed him in most of his early 1970s films (They Call Me Trinity to A Genius, Two Partners and a Dupe); from Mr. Billion onward, Hill dubbed his own English voice.\n\nHill and Spencer starred in Odds and Evens (1978), I'm for the Hippopotamus (1979), Who Finds a Friend Finds a Treasure (1981), and Go for It (1983). Without Spencer, Hill made Org (1979), which he also produced, and Super Fuzz (1980).\n\nDirector\n\nHill did The World of Don Camillo (1984), which he also produced and directed. He teamed with Spencer for Double Trouble (1984), and Miami Supercops (1985), then did They Call Me Renegade (1987), based on a story by Hill.\n\nTelevision\n\nHill turned director for Lucky Luke (1991) in which he starred and that was shot in the United States; it led to a TV series of the same name.\n\nHe reunited with Spencer one last time for Troublemakers (1994) which Hill also directed. He did Virtual Weapon (1997) with Marvelous Marvin Hagler.\n\nIn 2000, he landed the leading role in the Italian television series Don Matteo (2000–present), about an inspirational parish priest who assists the Carabinieri in solving crimes local to his community. This role earned Hill an international \"Outstanding Actor of the Year\" award at the 42nd Monte Carlo Television Festival, alongside ones for the series, and for producer Alessandro Jacchia at that festival.\n\nDuring the series' run he appeared in TV movies L'uomo che sognava con le aquile (2009), Riding the Dark (2009), Doc West (2009), and Triggerman (2009); he co-directed the last two.\n\nIn the summer of 2010, Hill filmed another Italian television series for the Italian state television channel Rai Uno, this time entitled Un passo dal cielo (One Step from Heaven), playing a local chief of the state foresters in the region of Alto Adige, with a second season filmed in 2012.\n\nHill directed the 2018 film My Name Is Thomas, which he also appeared in. The same year, the co-op beat 'em up videogame Bud Spencer & Terence Hill: Slaps and Beans was released.\n\nPersonal life\n\nHill is married to Lori Hill (née Zwicklbauer) and they have had two sons together; Jess (born 1969) and Ross (born 1973). Ross was killed in a car accident in Stockbridge, Massachusetts, US in 1990, while Hill was preparing to film Lucky Luke (1991) on the Bonanza Creek Ranch near Santa Fe, New Mexico, US.\n\nHe holds American citizenship, and in November 2022, he also attained a German citizenship by descent from the German consulate-general in Los Angeles without requiring a naturalization test.\n\nFilmography\n\nFilm\n\nYear Title Role Notes 1951 Vacation with a Gangster Gianni 1953 Il viale della speranza 1953 La voce del silenzio Boy at the barrier 1953 Un Amore per te 1953 Villa Borghese Un compagno di scuola di Anna Maria Uncredited 1954 Vacanze col gangster Gianni 1955 La vena d'oro Corrado 1955 Gli sbandati Wounded Estray 1955 Divisione Folgore Paratrooper Delavigne 1956 Guaglione Franco Danieli 1956 Mamma sconosciuta Gianni Martini 1956 I vagabondi delle stelle Franco 1957 Lazzarella Luciano Pico 1957 La grande strada azzurra Renato 1958 Anna di Brooklyn Ciccillo – Don Luigi's nephew 1958 La spada e la croce Lazzaro 1959 Primo Amore 1959 Il padrone delle ferriere Octave de Beaulieu 1959 Juke box urli d'amore Othello 1959 Annibale Quintilius 1959 Spavaldi e innamorati Paolo 1959 Cerasella Bruno 1960 Cartagine in fiamme Tsour 1960 Un militare e mezzo Giorgio Strazzonelli 1961 Giuseppe venduto dai fratelli Benjamin 1961 The Wonders of Aladdin Prince Moluk 1961 Pecado de amor Ángel Vega 1962 Il Dominatore dei sette mari Babington 1962 Il giorno più corto Soldato austriaco 1963 Il Gattopardo Count Cavriaghi 1964 Winnetou - 2.
