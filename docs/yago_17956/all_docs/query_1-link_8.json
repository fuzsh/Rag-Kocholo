        "text": "This is the third installment in Colizzi’s trilogy starting with God forgives, I don’t and the sequel Ace High (Four for an Ave Maria).\n\nI thought this was the worst of the three. It was somehow schizophrenic. Part comedy and part sinister spaghetti western. Maybe Colizzi already had the producers in his neck when shooting it…\n\nI loved the other two though, they had better music, better acting and better script.\n\nFor more info visit:\n\nDatabase page: Collina degli stivali, La - The Spaghetti Western Database\n\nGive Boot Hill your rating out of 5 stars!\n\n5\n\n4\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0 voters\n\nI agree also, weakest of the trilogy -my favourite is God Forgives… -but I haven’t seen this in widescreen, only in poor quality fullscreen version. I’d probably like it more if I had a decent copy.\n\nBut then again, I’d seen also only cut fullscreen version of God Forgives… but it’s still one of my favorite films.\n\nBoots Hill is crap if you compare them with CollizziÂ´s other 2 westerns…it starts good with close-ups of sweety faces but then the “funny” circus-music begins and all the cowboys start to dance :o ??? and after that the movie just goes downhill.\n\nFor me Ace High is the best (Eli !) followed by God Forgives, to much dwarf-clowns in this turkey.\n\nI’ve seen several versions of it, but neither of them was something to write home about.\n\nGod forgives … I don’t is a good spaghetti western, well-written, well-acted, good-looking, Ace High isn’t great, but it’s an enjoyable pudding of a movie, but this one … the opening scene is good, the shoot out near the end isn’t bad, but that’s about it …\n\nArguably the worst of the trilogy.\n\nBut Stanton is the Colizzi expert, so maybe he wants to argue …"
