Dolan wants Dobbs to tail her abusive boyfriend, Rick (Neil Young). Dobbs immediately demonstrates his uncanny powers of detection by trailing the wrong man (Ted Levine), whose story turns out to be far more fascinating than Rick's. Meanwhile, Dobbs is himself pursued by female P.I. Stella Wynkowski (Elizabeth Perkins), which hardly pleases Dobbs' jealous girlfriend, Doris (Ann Magnuson)\n\nSet in a present that feels more like the past, Harry Dobbs is a private detective surrounded by mysterious and dangerous dames. Among them is his angry girlfriend, Doris, and the suspicious women he encounters on his latest case.\n\nIn a nightclub, the sultry Miss Dolan hires the private eye to follow her lover, Rick, who might be trying to kill her. The trail takes Harry to women like Mrs. King and Mrs. McGraw, who apparently are wed to the same man.\n\nA female investigator named Stella Wynkowski turns up. Harry teams up with her, never entirely certain whether she is friend or foe.\n\nRelease date: March 23, 1990\n\nDistrib: Orion Pictures\n\nBoxoffice: $1,436,308 2014: $2,662,100\n\nCollections:\n\n4\n\nWants:\n\n0\n\nContributors\n\nOrignally Submitted By Videonut324 on 01/05/2014"
