        "text": "Directed by Alan Rudolph\n\n(USA, 1984, 35mm)\n\nIntroduced by Roberto Tejada, University of Houston\n\nThe characters in Alan Rudolph’s multilayered romantic comedy interact within a film noir of deception, love, and sex among the night people of Los Angeles. Keith Carradine stars as a mental patient with a mysterious past who finds himself in a love triangle with a bar owner (Lesley Ann Warren) and a late-night-radio sex-advice host (Geneviève Bujold). Choose Me is a symphony of coincidence, spontaneity, and unpredictability set to the jazz sounds of Teddy Pendergrass.\n\nMovies Houstonians Love\n\nThis presentation was chosen by Roberto Tejada, the Hugh Roy and Lillie Cranz Cullen Distinguished Professor in the English department at the University of Houston. Tejada is a poet, editor, essayist, art historian, and cultural critic whose most recent collection of poetry is Why the Assembly Disbanded.\n\nVisiting Guidelines Masks are recommended in Museum auditoriums.
