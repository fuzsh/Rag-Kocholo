        "text": "What do you get when you steep a spoof of the old detective movies in sexual immorality? A film called LOVE AT LARGE, with a plot so convoluted and silly, you’ll be scratching your head all the way home wondering, “What was this movie about?”\n\nHarry Dobbs, a bumbling private eye, is hired by a mysterious Miss Dolan to follow Rick, the man she loves and find out if he is two-timing her. Harry’s seemingly simple case turns more and more bizarre when he follows the wrong man. The false suspect appears to be the perfect father and husband. In fact, he is — a bigamist with two wives. One spouse he keeps in the suburbs, the other stashed out West, where she is committing adultery with a ranch hand.\n\nHarry’s jealous ex-live-in girlfriend, meanwhile, hires a female detective, Stella, to follow Harry, whom she suspects of two-timing her. When Harry and Stella come together on these intertwined assignments, the two private eyes begin to eye each other. In the course of their work, Stella helps the bigamist re-unite with his urban wife, while Harry saves Miss Dolan from her lover, Rick.\n\nThe movie’s premise, “Love is so hard to find, sometimes you have to hire a detective,” is ridiculous. It is resolved at film’s end in a typical humanistic and immoral manner when Harry and Stella decide to “give it a try” by going to bed together. Thus, through its treatment of love and marriage, the picture shows contempt for God’s word. “Each one of you also must love his wife as he loves himself, and the wife must respect her husband” (Eph 5:25-33). Furthermore, “What God hath joined together, let not man put asunder” (Mark 10:9). The camera work was well-done, but there were profanities and obscenities in almost every other line of dialogue. Miss Dolan was clad mostly in revealing lingerie and evening gowns. With sexual immorality as the basis for the movie, the weak treatment of the wife who forgives and reconciles with her bigamist husband amounts to nothing.\n\nThis is one case not worth solving. LOVE AT LARGE fails miserably, so skip it."
