You’ll…you’ll cut your hair… and I kind of like it the way it is.” – Harry\n\nNumber of Times Seen – 2 (30 Jul 2001 and 7 Mar 2017)\n\nBrief Synopsis – A private investigator is hired to follow a woman’s husband and it leads them both into a world of intrigue filled with lots of secrets.\n\nMy Take on it – I ave always been a fan of Tom Berenger’s work and he is great in this film as a the lead.\n\nLoved the fact that he used a very raspy voice for his character because it helps bring us into the world of crime noir because it is expertly done.\n\nThis film is proof that crime noir is not dead and that it is still possible to create new and exciting noir themes stories.\n\nThe plot has lots of twists and turns along the way and in some cases seems quite complicated, but it is all done in such a way that it keeps things interesting the whole way through.\n\nThe supporting cast is amazingly prolific and due to the fact that so many of the actors are well known, it helps to keep things even more suspenseful because you never know what is lurking around the corner for any of them.\n\nTo give you an idea of how prolific the cast is, here is a partial list – Elizabeth Perkins, Anne Archer, Kate Capshaw, Annette O’Toole, Anne Magnuson, Ted Levine, Ruby Dee and even Neil Young.\n\nBottom Line – Berenger is great in the lead here and helps give this film such a noir vibe. The rest of the prolific cast helps add to the surprise and suspense of it all because you never know what is lurking around the corner. Proved that the ideas of crime noir is not gone and still can be done quite well. The plot can get a bit complicated, but still stays extremely interesting the whole way through. Recommended!\n\nMovieRob’s Favorite Trivia – During filming of the lunch scene, Which was done at the Rock Creek Tavern West of Portland, Oregon. Tom Berenger was to eat a burger. After several takes with Berenger trying to take bite of the burger he could not keep a straight face because the burger was made by craft services and was terrible. The cook from the Rock Creek Tavern heard of the situation and made a “real” burger that Berenger could sink his teeth into. After that, filming wrapped for the day. (From IMDB)\n\nRating – Globe Worthy\n\n_______________________________________\n\nCheck out my *updated* movie stats here\n\nTo see my reviews of Oscar Winning Performances check out this link\n\nTo see my reviews of all Oscar Best Picture Winners click here (now complete)"
