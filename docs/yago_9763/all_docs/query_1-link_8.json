For the fourth of their five movies together, production designer Steven Legler captivates with color-splashed interiors and beautiful Portland scenery. Woman of mystery Anne Archer (who sings) hires Tom Berenger to find her missing mate Neil Young (who doesn’t) even though the gumshoe is busy with the case of bigamist Ted Levine, enabling rival PI Elizabeth Perkins to get in on the snooping."
