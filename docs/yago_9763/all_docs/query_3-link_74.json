        "text": "Arts and culture news of the week\n\n“I Voted” digital sticker design competition for Colorado high school students\n\nFor teens interested in both art and democracy, the Colorado Secretary of State’s “I Voted” digital sticker competition is now accepting submissions.\n\n“Just because you're young doesn't mean you don't have a voice,” said Secretary of State Jena Griswold. “There are so many ways to get involved, including by designing a civically engaged symbol – and voters love the stickers.”\n\nThe winner’s sticker design will be sent to voters via BallotTrax once they have returned their ballot for the upcoming General Election. It will also be featured on the Secretary of State’s website and as part of the office’s online efforts to encourage Coloradans to vote.\n\nGriswold said a majority of Colorado voters – nearly 98% – vote by mail. That’s about 2 million people who will receive the winning sticker. She added that voters have “prominently displayed them on social media in past elections, so we're really looking forward to it.\n\nAll entries must be received by Sept. 2. Winners will be determined by a committee in the Colorado Secretary of State’s Office. Find more details about the contest and specific criteria for submissions here.\n\nLandmark Chez Artiste closes permanently, with little warning\n\nAt the end of last week, the Landmark theater chain announced it was closing Chez Artiste in University Hills after the theatre’s final screenings on Thursday, Aug. 8.\n\nThe news comes shortly after the shuttering of the Landmark Esquire Theatre, one of the city’s bastions for independent and late-night cinema, on July 18.\n\nAurora Hunt, an organizer for the Denver Cinema Club, is planning a small farewell for the theatre on Thursday night. “I'm bringing sheet cake and sparkling apple champagne and a notebook so that everyone can wish [the staff] well,” she said. “It’s an opportunity to say goodbye and let them know how grateful we are.”\n\nShe acknowledged that the Chez Artiste didn’t offer any of the fancy amenities of many other theatres. “They don't have recliner seats. Their screens are not that big. Nothing about it is that attractive,” she said. Instead, people gathered there for conversation and community. That’s what made the Chez special.\n\n“They have programmed some kooky nonsense this last year or two,” Hunt said, “like silent films and obscure things that you've never heard of. And just on the strength of who they are, I'll go see anything. It's movie kale – I may not love it, but it's good for me.”\n\nEnjoy the Chez Artiste’s final days through Thursday, Aug. 8. The theater’s final run of films are The Fabulous Four, Coup!, Widow Clicquot, Thelma and Touch.\n\nLoveland’s annual “Sculpture in the Park” show celebrates 40 years\n\nThis weekend, Loveland’s “Sculpture in the Park” show wraps up its fourth decade in operation.
