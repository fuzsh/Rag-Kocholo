        "text": "Testimonials Find the latest testimonials and reviews for the Eisenhower House on Wedding Wire and The Knot.\n\n10 OUT OF 10! If you are looking for a stunning and well maintained property, gorgeous views of the Newport Harbor, and something a little different, Eisenhower House is for you! I could not be happier that my husband and I chose to have our special day here. It was absolutely perfect in every way. It's historic, \"New England\" and elegant in a more understated way. You can dress it up and have a fancy soiree or keep it peachy casual, great for both! Mallory and her team were beyond helpful in the decision making process, through all stages of planning and day of. I cannot express this enough. Great team all around!\n\n- Emily B. · married on 07/10/2020\n\nThe Eisenhower House is a perfect location for a wedding. The house is restored in-side beautifully. The grounds are perfect with a view of the Newport bridge. There is a wrap around deck. Mallory the event manager for the house is a joy to work with and willing to help in any way.\n\n- GALOFF W. · reviewed on 12/27/2018\n\nBest day ever! We celebrated our daughter's wedding at the Eisenhower House and it was, simply, one of the best days of our lives. Mallory facilitated the process to perfection- not a stone was unturned and we didn't have to worry about a single thing! The setting is the BEST: beautiful historical setting with the colors of the ocean and the Newport Bridge in the background. The passing sailboats just completed the whole scene. I would highly recommend celebrating a highly coveted event at the Eisenhower House!\n\n- Carolyn B. · married on 07/10/2020\n\nEisenhower house is an absolutely beautiful location to have your wedding. We had our reception here, having our ceremony off site. The grounds are gorgeous and to have the ability to have the beautiful Eisenhower House in addition to ocean. We looked at many sites in Newport but most were out of our price range. We were able to create our perfect day by bringing some great vendors to the Eisenhower house and have the day we wanted without the extra large price tag of much of the rest of Newport. As an added perk we enjoyed the bridal suite and grooms suite to store our extra things and have a little bit of privacy when needing to use the rest room.\n\n- Kelleigh · married on 06/24/2017\n\nWe were thrilled with the venue, but especially with Mallory and her team at the Eisenhower House. Not only was the location within our budget (hard to find in Newport), but they were also able to recommend exceptional vendors for the rest of our needs that day. Mallory was available to meet several times leading up to the event to go over all the details of the day. She was always very helpful, responsive and caring. The ceremony was planned outdoors, but just moments before, it began to rain and the Eisenhower staff (as well as the truly remarkable catering staff) quickly arranged to move everything under the dinner tent. We even hosted another family event there because we were so happy with this venue. We would highly recommend!\n\n- Christine · married on 12/29/2012\n\nA magical enue with a dedicated staff! The Eisenhower House was a truly magical venue for our wedding reception. The house is beautifully restored and the grounds are pristine. The wrap around porch and the lawn were the perfect size for my 200 guests during cocktails and our tent was short walk from the house as well. Mallory and Suzanne at EH were beyond helpful throughout the planning process. Whenever we needed to tour the house - they were available. Whenever we had questions - they were extremely responsive. They really put us at ease and worked well with our other vendors. They truly made everything we wanted work, as well. Another thing of note (that was very important to us!) were the bathrooms. The bathrooms are basically brand new and I received many comments from guests as you typically have to rent bathrooms for tent weddings. The bridal and groom suites are separated and roomy. It was really a dream experience! You cannot go wrong booking EH and working with the amazing team here.\n\n-Jaimie · married on 09/21/2019"
