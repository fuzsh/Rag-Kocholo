        "text": "Dwight D. Eisenhower, in full Dwight David Eisenhower (see Researcher’s Note), (born October 14, 1890, Denison, Texas, U.S.—died March 28, 1969, Washington, D.C.), 34th president of the United States (1953–61), who had been supreme commander of the Allied forces in western Europe during World War II.\n\nEarly career\n\nDenison, Texas; Eisenhower, Dwight D.\n\nEisenhower, Dwight D.: parents and brothers\n\nEisenhower, Dwight D.: Boy Scouts\n\nEisenhower, Dwight D.\n\nAbilene, Kansas: home of Dwight D. EisenhowerEisenhower was the third of seven sons of David Jacob and Ida Elizabeth (Stover) Eisenhower. In the spring of 1891 the Eisenhowers left Denison, Texas, and returned to Abilene, Kansas, where their forebears had settled as part of a Mennonite colony. David worked in a creamery; the family was poor; and Dwight and his brothers were introduced to hard work and a strong religious tradition at an early age.\n\nDwight D. Eisenhower playing football in Kansas\n\nDwight D. Eisenhower as a U.S. Military Academy graduate\n\n“Ike,” as Dwight was called, was a fun-loving youth who enjoyed sports but took only a moderate interest in his studies. The latter was perhaps a sign of one of his later characteristics: a dislike for the company of scholars. Dwight graduated from Abilene High School in 1909, worked for more than a year to support a brother’s college education, and then entered the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, New York, a decision that left his mother, a pacifist, in tears. He excelled in gridiron football but injured a knee in his second year at the academy and was forced to stop playing. In the remarkable class of 1915—which was to produce 59 generals—he ranked 61st academically and 125th in discipline out of the total of 164 graduates.\n\nEisenhower, Mamie\n\nEisenhower, Dwight D.; Eisenhower, MamieAfter being commissioned a second lieutenant, he was sent to San Antonio, Texas, where he met Mamie Geneva Doud (Mamie Eisenhower), daughter of a successful Denver meat packer. They were married in 1916 and had two sons: Doud Dwight, born in 1917, who died of scarlet fever in 1921, and John Sheldon Doud, born in 1922.\n\n[Editor's Comment: My father, Hugh Henry Morgan, was born December 12, 1884 in Denison, TX, six years before Dwight Eisenhower was born there. My father was called to preach and he left his home in Dension where his father, John Morgan, an immigrant from Wales, was a rancher, to go to Holmes Bible and Missionary Institute in Greenville, SC, when N. J. Holmes was president. My father's family moved to Oklahoma and the Eisenhowers moved to Kansas. I was privileged to serve in the Quantico Marine Band for three years during the Eisenhower administration, 1953-1956. Our band played for President Dwight D. Eisenhower for various ceremonies and parades when he came for the graduation of young 2nd Lieutant Marine officers. Years later, when I was a student at Asbury Theological Seminary, I was a member of the Seminary Singers. We visited with the pastor the National Presbyterian Church the Rev. Edward Elson, a friend of our seminary president. Pastor Elson told us that President Eisenhower was a regular Sunday worshiper and attended Wednesday night services. He showed us the pew where he always sat. I asked if I could sit where Ike sat, and I was given permission to do. It is interesting to know that on February 1, 1953, just 10 days after Eisenhower's inauguration, he was baptized and welcomed into the National Presbyterian Church by the Rev. Edward Elson. Eisenhower remains the only president ever to have been baptized while in office, and his work to link faith and American identity has influenced political debate in the country for half a century since.]"
