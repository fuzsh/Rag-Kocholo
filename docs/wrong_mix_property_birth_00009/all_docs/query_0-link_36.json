        "text": "Today is the 129th anniversary of the birth of Dwight D. Eisenhower.\n\nIn 1950, a few years before he became president of the United States, Eisenhower, and his wife, Mamie, purchased a home on 189 acres in Gettysburg.\n\nThe Eisenhowers spent weekends and holidays at the farm. They also hosted special events there.\n\nDwight Eisenhower was born on Oct. 14, 1890, in Denison, Texas.\n\nEisenhower was a 1915 graduate of the U.S. Military Academy at West Point.\n\nHe attended the Command and General Staff College at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas then served as an aide to Gen. John Pershing and Gen. Douglas MacArthur.\n\nIn 1941, Eisenhower was promoted to Brigadier General. In 1942 he led the Allied invasion of North Africa then the 1943 invasion of Sicily.\n\nEisenhower was promoted to full general in 1943 and appointed supreme commander of the Allied forces in Western Europe during World War II. He led the D-Day invasion of Nazi-occupied Europe.\n\nHe left active duty in 1948 and briefly served as president of Columbia University before being asked to take command of the NATO forces in Europe.\n\nIn 1952 he was persuaded to run for president.\n\nHe resigned his commission in the Army and returned from his NATO base in Paris in June 1952.\n\nOn June 13, 1952, Eisenhower hosted the Pennsylvania delegation to the Republican National Convention as his farm in Gettysburg. On Oct. 27, 1952, he and Richard Nixon campaigned in Harrisburg.\n\nOct. 13, 1953, Hershey hosted a party for Eisenhower for his 63rd birthday. It was sponsored by the Pennsylvania Republican Finance Committee and was intended to be a fundraiser for the Republican Party. According to the Hershey Community Archives, the party included three events in Hershey Stadium and Hershey Arena.\n\nOn Oct. 23, 1954, Eisenhower made a speech at the Pennsylvania Monument at the Gettysburg battlefield followed by a luncheon with Congressional and statewide Republicans at his Adams County farm.\n\nEisenhower was president from 1953 to 1961. He and his wife retired to the farm in Gettysburg in 1961.\n\nOn June 26, 1961, Eisenhower and Richard Nixon appeared in Hershey for a Republican event and rally to launch Pennsylvania's 1962 gubernatorial campaign.\n\nHe died March 28, 1969 in Washington, D.C."
