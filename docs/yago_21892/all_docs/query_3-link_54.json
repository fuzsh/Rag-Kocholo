        "text": "Because Nefertiti is depicted with a pharaoh’s crown, some archeologists believe she was seen as Akhenaten’s equal and had the powers of a pharaoh. She may have even ruled as a pharaoh after the death of her husband and before the reign of King Tutankhamun, under the name Djeserkheperure Smenkhare.\n\nIn any case, inscriptions depict a queen who is both involved in and in charge of the royal court. She was also considered a high priestess, allowing the faithful access to the god Aten through her.\n\nOne of the most famous depictions of Nefertiti shows her with one blank eye, considered a blight on an otherwise beautiful face. There exists varying speculation about the circumstances that led to the blank eye, which include the theory that the queen possessed a natural fold of skin over the eye (not uncommon in the region). The blank eye could also be designed as a insult, or could simply be the result of damage that occurred over the years.\n\nBy far the most entertaining theory, however, is that Thutmose, the artist who made the bust, fell in love with Nefertiti. After his advances were rebuffed, the theory goes, he left the eye blank as a symbol of her inability to see the true nature of the artist's love.\n\nNefertiti married Amenhotep IV when she was 15 years old. They had six daughters and possibly one son, and ruled Egypt as equals in the mid 1300s BC.\n\nThe power couple changed Egypt drastically by designating the sun itself as the new god, and making it the center of political and religious structure, replacing the god Amen with Aten. They created a new capital, Akhet-Aten, over 200 miles north of Thebes. This didn’t sit well with all the people, but they didn’t have much of a choice. Defying the pharaoh could result in death, and the couple made themselves the only priests through which citizens could access Aten.\n\nThe couple eventually changed their names. Amenhotep became Akhenaten and Nefertiti (whose original name meant “a beautiful woman has come”) became Neferneferuaten-Nefertiti or \"beautiful are the beauties of Aten, a beautiful woman has come.\" Both names helped solidify Aten as the new principal god.\n\nIn 2015, archeologist Dr. Nicholas Reeves believed he discovered a secret, larger room behind Tutankhamun’s smaller tomb. Using scans, what seemed to be a hidden tomb was revealed, prompting Reeves to posit it belonged to Nefertiti.\n\nThe discovery could have confirmed theories about Nefertiti’s true place within Egyptian history - like her being Tut’s mother and even the royal with the higher pedigree. Perhaps Nefertiti ruled as the boy king’s co-regent after the death of Akhenaten. Reeves suggests that Nefertiti may have been interred first, with the door to her chamber plastered and painted over.\n\n\"If I'm wrong, I'm wrong,\" Reeves said. \"But if I'm right, the prospects are frankly staggering.” Some historians suggest that Nefertiti’s tomb and trappings were used for the burial of King Tut or that she was hidden in Tut’s tomb so that enemies of her husband, Akhenaten, wouldn’t find her.\n\nRegardless of what may have occurred during Nefertiti's lifetime, her death did not see her placed in a secret tomb behind Tut's. In 2018, researchers confirmed that not only was Nefertiti not buried behind King Tut's tomb, but that Reeves's theoretical room didn't even exist.\n\nThe royal family of Amenhotep IV lived in structures built in Karnak. One of the grandest was the Gempaaten, a palace complex. A temple devoted to Nefertiti, the Hut-Benben, was even built inside the palace.\n\nIn the third year of their reign, Nefertiti and Amenhotep IV are depicted as having thrown an elaborate festival in the temple. An inscription shows the ruling couple, along with their daughters and royal court, viewing the entertainment and crowds from their special viewing spot at the palace.\n\nAmenhotep IV inherited a very wealthy Egypt from his father, the previous ruler. But the installation of the sun as the center of government and politics ruffled a lot of feathers. Once he became Akhenaten and established the new sun god, things slowly changed in Egypt.\n\nEventually, the ruler lost all tolerance for other beliefs and began a campaign to destroy other religions. As a result, turmoil and debt began to plague the empire. Akhenaten retreated from his subjects and public life, but passed before things could truly spin out of control for the kingdom."
