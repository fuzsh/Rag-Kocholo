        "text": "The reign of Akhenaten is one of the most controversial of all Egyptian history since only about the co-regency with Amenhotep III there are more than 1200 books and academic articles that have been written. He has thus become the center of many other controversies: although he had only (six) daughters he would be the father of Tutankhamun (a boy!) despite the fact that the latter had clearly stated to be the son of Amenhotep III, although he had worshiped the sun under different shapes (Aten, Re, Amun) he would be the true father of monotheism that inspired the biblical myth of Moses as well as the Jewish god Adon \"Lord\", a plagiarism of Aton, although he was the sovereign pontiff of Egypt, a delegation of priests of Amun would have plotted a religious rebellion in order to remove the heretic worship of Aton, etc. All this doesn't seem seriousness. The only way of knowing the (historical) truth is to use a chronology anchored on absolute dates (coming from astronomy). Thus the precise dating of this period confirms historical testimonies: Amenhotep III (1383-1345) reigned 11 years beside his eldest son Amenhotep IV (1356-1340) and was the father of Tutankhamun (1336-1327) born in 1347 BCE.\n\nIn 1996, W. Raymond Johnson, a member of the epigraphic team of the Oriental Institute, published his ideas regarding the changing style of the artistic representations of the pharaoh, Amenhotep III, in his later years. 1 It had become clear to Johnson that, not only was the king shown with a more youthful face after his first heb sed [a rejuvenating ritual] in Year 30, but around that same time considered himself to be a living incarnation of the sun god. It also occurred to the scholar that the sun does not reign the heavens alone but is part of a kind of \" holy trinity \" consisting of Atum-Re, his son, Shu, and his daughter, Tefnut, which, in the words of W. Raymond Johnson \" cannot exist without each other \" .\n\nNefertiti, the wife of Pharaoh Akhenaten, fulfilled several important functions in both the religion and politics of the Amarna Period. The very name of Nefertiti, Nfr-nfr.w-jtn nfr.t-jj.tj, which translates as The Beautiful is Beauty of Aten, The Beautiful One Has Come, shows how important was the role she played in representing the qualities of the sun god Akhetaten. Nefertiti was presented as The Great Wife of the King but also The Lady of the Two Lands. These titles are indicative of her strong position in politics, because in ancient Egypt, religion and ideology of royal power were inextricably linked. Apparently, the queen was identified with the ruler. This is evidenced, for example, in the scenes from talatat, where Nefertiti was presented on the board of a ceremonial ship pulling a captive by his or her hair and massacring him or her with a khepesh sword, held in the other hand. Very important is the sacral dimension of Nefertiti, because apart from holding significant religious and political functions, she was also deified. Nefertiti's divine status is best illustrated and confirmed in Akhenaten's sarcophagus. At each corner, the queen is shown with outstretched arms, covering and protecting the deceased ruler. Recent discoveries in great Wadi Dayr Abu Hinnis indicate that in 16 Year of Akhenaten's reign, Nefer-titi was still alive and was the highest queen. This sheds new light on the Amarna Period. It cannot be ruled out that Nefertiti, as Ankhkheperure Neferneferuaton, held the function of Akhenaten's coregent, and after her husband's death, ruled independently as Anchcheperure Semenchakare.\n\nAny student or scholar of the Amarna Period knows that this era in Egyptian history is often riddled with more questions than answers; in particular, research on the prominent historical figures of this period are some of the most contested within the Egyptological community. Such is the case with Nefertiti, whose influential role during the reign of her husband, Akhenaten, is the subject of numerous studies. New to this corpus of Amarna-themed books is Aidan Dodson’s \"Nefertiti: Queen and Pharaoh of Egypt. Her Life and Afterlife.\" Dodson’s reason for writing another book on Nefertiti is to give a “fresh holistic view” of this famous queen, and to provide readers with an account of the Amarna interlude based on his own working hypotheses for this period (pp. x– xi). The book not only covers the life of the famous queen during Dynasty 18, but also the rediscovery of Nefertiti, the ongoing search for her burial and mummy, and the ways in which her icon and image “overshadow the woman herself” in more recent times (pp. 1–2)."
