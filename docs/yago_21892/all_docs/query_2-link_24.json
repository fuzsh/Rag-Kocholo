        "text": "Queen\n\nMost information on Nefertiti has been gathered from ancient images found in tombs and temples that were uncovered mostly in the early 20th century. The earliest pictures that were found come from tombs in Thebes. In these representations, Nefertiti is shown accompanying her husband. Other images depict her in a more prominent role, such as making offerings to the Aton or participating in the ritual killing of the female enemies of Egypt. In these images, Nefertiti wears her own unique headdress—a tall, straight-edged, flat-topped blue crown.\n\nBy the end of Akhenaten’s fifth year as pharaoh, he had made the Aton a major god in Egypt. He closed the old state temples and transferred the court to a new capital city, Akhetaton (now called Tell el-Amarna). The new capital was dedicated to the worship of the Aton. There Nefertiti continued to play an important religious role. Egyptians often worshiped her as part of a divine trinity (godlike group of three) that she formed with the Aton and Akhenaten.\n\nNefertiti is often pictured with an exaggeratedly feminine body shape. Her fertility (ability to produce offspring) is emphasized by the constant appearance of the six princesses. These traits indicate that she was considered a living fertility goddess, or the symbol of the creation of life and of prosperity.\n\nDid You Know?\n\nWritten evidence indicates that Nefertiti was a major supporter of Akhenaten. She especially backed up Akhenaten’s move to elevate the Aton as the main god to worship.\n\nSoon after Akhenaten’s 12th year as pharaoh, one of the princesses died. Three other princesses disappeared and are also presumed to have died. Many early historians noted that Nefertiti seemed to have vanished at the same time. The simplest explanation is that Nefertiti died. However, there is no record of her death and no evidence that she was ever buried in the royal tomb at Akhetaton. Early Egyptologists concluded that Nefertiti had separated from Akhenaten and had moved to a different city. However, this theory is now discredited.\n\nIn 2012 an inscription was found on a rock in a limestone quarry that was used during Akhenaten’s time. The inscription, probably written by quarry workers, mentions Nefertiti’s existence during Akhenaten’s 16th year as pharaoh. This information suggests that Nefertiti may have outlived her husband, who probably died during his 17th year of ruling. She may have even ruled for a short time after he died. Some researchers have suggested that she took the name Smenkhkare and ruled alone as female pharaoh before handing the throne to Tutankhamen (who is possibly Akhenaten’s son by another wife). However, modern researchers now believe that it’s unlikely that Nefertiti and Smenkhkare are the same person. Nefertiti’s body hasn’t been discovered."
