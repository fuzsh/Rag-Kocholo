Nefertiti and her husband Pharaoh Akhenaten initiated the following of the sun god also known as Aten. They also immensely contributed to the uprising of egyptian artwork and architecture.\n\nNefertiti has a very mysterious background little is known about her and there are several theories about who she really is and where she came from.

He disclosed this information with press which was a clear violation of protocol which states that it must report all findings directly to the supreme council of Antiquities before releasing information to the press.
