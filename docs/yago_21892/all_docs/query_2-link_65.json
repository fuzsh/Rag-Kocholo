        "text": "Neferneferuaten-Nefertiti in hieroglyphs\n\nNeferneferuaten Nefertiti\n\nNfr nfrw itn Nfr.t jy.tj\n\nBeautiful are the Beauties of Aten, the Beautiful one has come\n\nGreat Royal Wife of Pharaoh Akhenaten\n\nNefertiti (pronounced at the time something like *nafratiːta) (c. 1370 BC – c. 1330 BC) was the Great Royal Wife of the Egyptian Pharaoh Akhenaten. She was the mother-in-law and may have been stepmother of the Pharaoh Tutankhamun. After her husband died, Nefertiti may have also ruled as pharaoh under the name Neferneferuaten.\n\nHer name in English means \"the beautiful (or perfect) woman has come\". Nefertiti was one of the most powerful queens in Ancient Egypt.\n\nNefertiti and her husband reigned at what was arguably the wealthiest period of ancient Egyptian history. They radically changed the national religious policy, introducing proto-monotheism centred on the sun god Aten.\n\nNefertiti is best known for her bust, which is in Berlin's Neues Museum. This bust is considered to be a beautiful example of Egyptian art. It was attributed to the sculptor Thutmose, and it was found in his workshop.\n\nShe is one of the most recognized queens in Ancient Egypt.\n\nFamily and early life\n\nAlmost nothing is known about Nefertiti's life prior to her marriage to Akhenaten. She probably was the daughter of a woman named Tey anh her husband, Ay.\n\nThe exact dates when Nefertiti married Akhenaten and became the king's great royal wife are uncertain. They had at least six daughters together, including Meritaten, Meketaten, Ankhesenpaaten (later called Ankhesenamun when she married Tutankhamun), Neferneferuaten Tasherit, Neferneferure, and Setepenre.\n\nNefertiti was the first and most loved wife of Akhenaten. He had a total of eight wives, but she was different from the rest. Ramses was devoted and obsessed with her beauty. Nefertiti was such an educated woman, she was able to read and write hieroglyphs. It was a rare skill that barely anyone had.\n\nLife\n\nNefertiti first appears in scenes in Thebes, in the damaged tomb (TT188) of the royal butler Parennefer. The new king Amenhotep IV is accompanied by a royal woman; they are both shown worshiping the Aten.\n\nDuring the early years in Thebes, Akhenaten (still known as Amenhotep IV) had several temples erected at Karnak. One of the structures, the Mansion of the Benben (hwt-ben-ben), was dedicated to Nefertiti. She is depicted with her daughter Meritaten and in some scenes the princess Meketaten participates as well.\n\nIn the fourth year of his reign, Amenhotep IV decided to move the capital to Akhetaten (modern Amarna). In his fifth year, Amenhotep IV officially changed his name to Akhenaten, and Nefertiti became known as Neferneferuaten-Nefertiti. The name change was a sign of the ever-increasing importance of the cult of the Aten.\n\nThe new city contained several large open-air temples dedicated to the Aten. Nefertiti and her family would have resided in the Great Royal Palace in the centre of the city and possibly at the Northern Palace as well. Nefertiti's steward during this time was an official named Meryre II. He would have been in charge of running her household.\n\nMeketaten may have died in year 13 or 14. Nefertiti, Akhenaten, and three princesses are shown mourning her. The last dated inscription naming her and Akhenaten comes from a building inscription in the limestone quarry at Dayr Abū Ḥinnis. It dates to year 16 of the king's reign and is also the last dated inscription naming the king.\n\nPossible reign as Pharaoh\n\nMany scholars believe Nefertiti became co-regent of her husband Pharaoh Akhenaten before his death. She is depicted in many archaeological sites as equal in stature to a King, smiting Egypt's enemies, riding a chariot, and worshipping the Aten like a pharaoh. When Nefertiti's name disappears from historical records, it is replaced by that of a co-regent named Neferneferuaten, who became a female Pharaoh. It seems likely that Nefertiti, in a similar fashion to the previous female Pharaoh Hatshepsut, assumed the kingship under the name Pharaoh Neferneferuaten after her husband's death. It is also possible that, in a similar fashion to Hatshepsut, Nefertiti disguised herself as a male and assumed the male alter-ego of Smenkhkare; in this instance she could have elevated her daughter Meritaten to the role of great royal wife.\n\nDeath and burial\n\nNefertiti is thought to have died around 1330 BC. In 1898, French archeologist Victor Loret found two female mummies among those cached inside the tomb of Amenhotep II in KV35 in the Valley of the Kings. These two mummies, known as 'The Elder Lady' and 'The Younger Lady', were identified as likely candidates of her remains. However, in a subsequent research project led by Zahi Hawass, the mummy was put through CT scan analysis and DNA analysis. Researchers concluded that the younger lade is Tutankhamun's biological mother, an unnamed daughter of Amenhotep III and Tiye, not Nefertiti. The Elder Lady proved to be Tiye, mother of Akhenaten.\n\nKV21B mummy\n\nOne of the two female mummies found in KV21 has been suggested as the body of Nefertiti. DNA analysis did not yield enough data to make a definitive identification but confirmed she was a member of the Eighteenth Dynasty royal line. CT-scanning revealed she was about 45 at the time of her death; her left arm had been bent over her chest in the 'queenly' pose. The possible identification is based on her association with the mummy tentatively identified as Ankhesenamun. It is suggested that just as a mother and daughter (Tiye and the Younger Lady) were found lying together in KV35, the same was true of these mummies.\n\nHittite letters\n\nA document was found in the ancient Hittite capital of Hattusa which dates to the Amarna period. According to the document, the Hittite ruler received a letter from the Egyptian queen. The letter reads:\n\nMy husband has died and I have no son. They say about you that you have many sons. You might give me one of your sons to become my husband. I would not wish to take one of my subjects as a husband... I am afraid.\n\nThis proposal is considered extraordinary as New Kingdom royal women never married foreign royalty. He eventually did send one of his sons, Zannanza, but the prince died, perhaps murdered, en route.\n\nThe identity of the queen who wrote the letter is uncertain. She is called Dakhamunzu in the Hittite annals, a translation of the Egyptian title Ta hemet nesu (The King's Wife). Since Nefertiti was depicted as being as powerful as her husband in official monuments smiting Egypt's enemies, she might be the Dakhamunzu in the Amarna correspondence, as Nicholas Reeves believes.\n\nNames and titles\n\nNefertiti had many titles including:\n\nHereditary Princess (iryt-p`t)\n\nGreat of Praises (wrt-Hzwt)\n\nLady of Grace (nebet-imat, nbt-jmꜣt)\n\nSweet of Love (beneret-merut, bnrt-mrwt)\n\nLady of The Two Lands (nebet-tawi, nbt-tꜣwj)\n\nMain King's Wife, his beloved (hemet-nesut-aat meretef, ḥmt-nswt-ꜥꜣt mrt.f)\n\nGreat King's Wife, his beloved (hemet-nesut-weret meretef, ḥmt-nswt-wrt mrt.f)\n\nLady of All Women (henut-hemut-nebut, ḥnwt-ḥmwt-nbwt)\n\nMistress of Upper & Lower Egypt (henut-shemau-mehu, ḥnwt-šmꜣw-mḥw).\n\nGallery\n\nHeadless bust of Akhenaten or Nefertiti.
