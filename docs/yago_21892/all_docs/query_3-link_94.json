        "text": "After canceling her visit to Coachella in 2017 due to her pregnancy, Beyoncé offered her fans a breathtaking show on April 14th, 2018. Courrier International talked about a “concert as bluffing as historical”, because the singer is the first African-American to be headlining the famous festival, but also and especially because she made it into a political platform, through her songs and numerous quotes: Malcolm X and Nina Simone were highlighted, as well as the BlackLivesMatter movement or the berets of the Black Panthers… Beyoncé’s performance has since been the subject of a documentary made by the singer for Netflix, discussed in another Antiquipop article.\n\nThis concert and its scenography also confirm once again the graphic coherence of Beyoncé’s communication since several years. Of course there are the well known choreographies, immediately identifiable. It is also difficult to miss the yellow outfits of the singer and her dancers: the color of Lemonade (the title of her last album) is recurrent in the visuals of the singer (see for example the video Hold up, 2016). Even Black Panthers had already been quoted at the Coldplay Superbowl in 2016, which then gave rise to a lot of comments.\n\nThe list of intra-diegetic references could be long. I will focus here of course on Egyptian antiquity. Indeed, given the overall consistency of the communication deployed, it is difficult not to look for the keys of the introductory panel: after a small drum roll, dancers in “Tutankhamun” leotards step aside to make room for the singer, showing her back so we can recognize on his cape the bust of Nefertiti, echoing the headdress of Beyoncé.\n\nThe troupe then crosses the space and the singer disappears while the dancers indulge in a frantic choreography in front of a large pyramid of metal, which rises and gradually reveals a second pyramid on which is installed a brass orchestra.\n\nAs I said above, the references made by Beyoncé to Antiquity are constant and coherent. Indeed, we have already seen costumes featuring the mask of Tutankhamun during the Formation tour in 2016. The young Egyptian king is famous since the discovery of his tomb intact in 1922. Here, his mask becomes almost autonomous as a graphic sign. He is also related to Queen Nefertiti (we thought for a long time that she was his mother), also present in the concert as we will see.\n\nThe headdress worn by Beyoncé at the beginning of the concert reflects to those of the women who surrounded her on her live at the MTV VMA in 2016 and her hairstyle in the music video for her song Sorry (2016).\n\nThese headdresses / hairstyles strongly evoke the famous bust of Nefertiti preserved in Berlin. A bust that already appeared in the photoshoot announcing the pregnancy of the singer in 2016 (with a lot of references to antiquity, both egyptian and classical). For Coachella, Olivier Rousteing (Balmain) proposed an update of the headdress of the Egyptian queen, combining it with the traditional hats of fanfares members. The bust of Nefertiti, black, is also embroidered on the cape worn by Beyoncé, then on other outfits. To complete the “royal” outfit, let’s not forget to mention the cobra head scepter.\n\nAs I have already mentioned in my article about Rihanna, Nefertiti has been for some years one of the new black women’s icons, often put forward in pop culture. Her incessant presence in the communication of black American singers makes her an essential contemporary icon. The imaginary surrounding her is now preferred to that of Cleopatra: more sober, less provocative and exempt of skin color controversy (in Balmain’s version, she is black, unequivocally), Nefertiti is also a world famous pop icon thanks to the bust discovered in 1912 and now preserved in Berlin. The fact that she is the wife of Akhenaton, who imposed a religion considered by some as the first monotheism, is probably important as well: let’s not forget that the name of the group from which Beyoncé emerged, Destiny’s Child, is a reference to the Book of Isaiah and that the singer finishes her concert with “God bless yall, good night, thank you”.\n\nFinally, the pyramid which occupies the center of the stage is put to contribution recurrently in the scenography, several epiphanies (manifestation / appearance of a deity) of the singer take place there, with a lot of special effects (flames, spots, smoke). There is even a nod to the theory of ancient astronauts: two cosmonauts/dancers descend the central aisle of the pyramid during an intermission. Unintentionally, we can also imagine that for fans of peplums, the massive presence of brass evoked their usual soundtrack.\n\nOne of the strongest elements of the outfits, widely commented on social networks, is the “coat of arms” embroded on several outfits (see below). Separated into four areas, it refers to Nefertiti, the Black Panthers and Alpha Phi Alpha, the first interuniversity fraternity created by African Americans in 1906. It is surmounted by a winged Udjat eye. Below, the inscription “20 18 ΒΣΥΘΝCΣ” uses Greek alphabet characters but does not make any sense: it literally reads “BSUTHNCS”. This is probably an additional echo to the names of American fraternities. The same goes for the word “BΔK” which appears on certain outfits (not to be read as “BAK” or “BDK”, but as the initials of the singer, Beyoncé Knowles, separated by a pyramid)."
