You can update your choices at any time in your settings.\n\nAkhenaten was born Amenhotep IV, a younger son of pharaoh Amenhotep III and his principal wife, Queen Tiye. The tenth ruler of the 18th Dynasty, he came to power in either the year 1353 or 1351 B.C. and reigned for roughly 17 years during Egypt’s New Kingdom.\n\nHis reign can be divided into two phases: the years before the move to the site of the new capital, Akhetaten, and the years following. Today, the former capital Akhenaten is called Amarna… several “boundary” stelae were found marking its boundary.\n\nAkhenaten was married to Queen Nefertiti, his Great Royal Wife. Together, they introduced a form of monotheism, with the worship of the sun god Aten. The exact timing of their marriage is unknown, but inscriptions from the pharaoh's building projects suggest that their union took place shortly before or after Akhenaten took the throne.\n\nAs a pharaoh, Akhetaten moved Egypt’s capital to a previously unoccupied site. New building innovations and techniques emerged from Akhenaten's projects; structures began to be made with talatat, small blocks which made it easier to construct buildings within a shorter time span than the traditional large sandstone slabs used.\n\nAkhetaten was a planned city with the Great Temple of the Aten, Small Aten Temple, royal residences, records office, and government buildings in the city center. Some of these buildings, such as the Aten temples, were ordered to be built by Akhenaten on the boundary stela decreeing the city's founding.\n\nAkhenaten could have ruled together with Smenkhkare and Nefertiti for several years before his death. The cause of death is unknown largely because it is unclear whether his remains have ever been located. With Akhenaten's death, worship of Aten fell out of favor.\n\nAkhenaten's successors, starting with Tutankhaten, took steps to distance themselves from Atenism and abandoned the city of Akhetaten. Tutankhaten and his wife Ankhesenpaaten dropped the Aten from their names, embracing Amun, and changed them to Tutankhamun and Ankhesenamun, respectively. Traditional religious practice was gradually restored."
