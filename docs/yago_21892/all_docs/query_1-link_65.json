        "text": "El-Amarna\n\nThe political and religious reorganization initiated by Akhenaten had a spatial and geographical correlate: he wished to found his own city, a new capital for Aten, which he named Akhetaten or âHorizon of the Aten,â the remains of which are known today as el-Amarna. Notwithstanding its remoteness and the limited conservation on site, a massive amount of data has been collected at this great city from surveys, archaeological excavations, and analyses of artifacts conducted by the British Amarna Project under the direction of Barry Kemp.10 Since the 1980s, a large number of articles, book chapters, and books have been published by project members and continue to be forthcoming.\n\nEl-Amarna is situated in a broad valley basin on the east bank of the Nile, approximately 9 miles south of the present town of Mellawi (figure 1.1). The course of the Nile River makes a slight bend and, as if they responded in a ripple effect, the cliffs arch back, forming a semicircle that was intended to enclose the city and is referred to today as the Bay of Amarna. Somewhat to the north of the semicircle center, yet still close to its central axis, the cliffs are broken up by a wadi, or desert valley, today called the Wadi Abu Hasah el-Bahri, which leads out into the desert. In 1891, one high-status tomb was discovered some 7.5 miles up this wadi. The tomb had been vandalized but has been attributed to Akhenaten. Although his body was not located, the iconography of the reliefs remaining on the tomb walls and its isolated and calculated location add strong support to the tombâs identification as Akhenatenâs.\n\nFigure 1.1. Map of the contemporary setting of the site of el-Amarna. (Adapted from Murnane and van Sicklen 1993)\n\nThese landscape features are closely related to the hieroglyph Akhet, signifying the eastern horizon, and to a text passage repeated on the two earliest boundary stelae (see below) in which Akhenaten reports on his âdiscoveryâ of the building site. Akhet is the principal glyph in the toponym Akhetaten and it strongly resembles a graphic sectional view of two cliffs connected by a depression, upon which rests the Aten sun disk. Cyril Aldred first observed that when viewed from the area of the Great and Small Aten Temples, sunrise over the wadi takes on this very form in the physical landscape (figure 1.2).11 Thus the rebirth of Aten, the Sun, is performed daily and in perpetuity along the east-west axis of el-Amarna. It now becomes evident why Akhenaten would have chosen the wadi as his ideal tomb location. In death, he permanently united with and became Aten and therefore daily sunrise repeats his rebirth and stages his immortality.\n\nFigure 1.2. View from the Aten Temples to the eastern cliffs with the wadi resembling the Akhet glyph at sunrise. (Adapted photograph by Brian Garrett)\n\nA text passage from the two earliest boundary stelae sketches out an event possibly related to the founding of the capital:\n\nThis text passage clearly links the city of Akhetaten to the rise of the Aten and the âprimeval eventâ of his cycle, which implies the location of the initial rise of the Sun and the initiation of his rebirth. Silverman et al. further discuss the âgreat offeringâ of food items, animals, and agricultural products âin front of the mountain of Akhetaten.â13 They interpret the texts that Akhenaten performed a ritual chariot ride from the central city to the wadi and upon his return made the lavish offering to Aten in the fifth year of his reign. He may have entered the sacred wadi for the first time and experienced a symbolic communion with his god, which convinced him to build his capital in the Bay of Amarna and his tomb further up the wadi. This chariot ride was repeated one year later on its anniversary day as well as in subsequent years. Alternatively Akhenaten may have made his offering at the foot of the cliffs, which is the only location in the Bay of Amarna that matches the descriptive term âin front of the mountain of Akhetaten.â I will argue below that this primeval founding offering became the core event depicted on the boundary stelae and in numerous relief scenes gracing public buildings in the Main City.\n\nSite selection may further have been influenced by seeking a compromise between the desire for a new and unused space unspoiled by an earlier history and the political need to link Akhenaten in some form to royal ancestors. Janet Richards discusses physical markers of the Egyptian landscape that the first dynastic rulers selected and contextualized in their funerary setting.14 Richards argues that similar landscape features were sought by later rulers, including Akhenaten, and were set into an ideational landscape layered with political and religious metaphors. She describes North Abydos, which contains several cemeteries with tombs dating to the beginnings of the dynastic era at approximately 3100 BC. These cemeteries are situated on the west side of the Nile at a location where the cliffs sweep back in the form of a crescent enclosing low desert. The low desert rises to the cliffs in horizontal layers of plateaus and escarpments and is split by a broad and shallow wadi leading to the cliffs of the high desert. Richards argues that the ancient Egyptians would have viewed the opening of the wadi in the cliffs on the western horizon as the gate to the underworld and would have used the plateaus and escarpments as theatrical stages for the display and enactment of rituals.15 By permanently residing in this topographic setting, these early dynastic rulers laid claim to this land and converted neutral and atemporal space into an empowered human place, using Christopher Tilleyâs terms of phenomenological landscape study.16 Over the next two millennia, Abydos obtained national renown for housing the tomb of Osiris, the god of the death and vegetation. The sloping sides of the wadi frame his tomb when viewed from a distance.\n\nAs noted, these same landscape features are found at el-Amarna, albeit on the east side of the Nile, and are dedicated to Aten, the god of the living and of rebirth. The reverse definition of the sacred geography must be emphasized if Akhenaten was indeed aware of the Abydos model. A similar topography further exists at other Egyptian sites, such as Deir el Ballas and Thebes,17 between the Archaic mastabas of North Saqqara and Abusir,18 and probably others.\n\nRichards argues that the topographical setting at el-Amarna may have been the chief factor motivating Akhenaten to construct his capital at that particular location.19 Although the components of the natural landscape can be experienced even by the contemporary visitor, the written information Akhenaten has left us about himself in the long texts he commissioned emphasize that his primary perception was oriented toward his personal god, the Aten, and that the bay topography itself most likely came second. Upon first entering the Bay of Amarna and looking east, he perceived a connection between the landscape features and the rise of Aten. The ritual chariot ride and the initial offering cemented his perception into the imagination that the wadi constituted the sacred geography in which Aten, the Sun, first rose and where he would unite with Aten in life, death, and perpetual rebirth. This condenses the essence of Akhenatenâs ideology and his capital was constructed around this experienced, perceived, and imagined landscape.\n\nFigure 1.3. Boundary Stela N, drawing. (Adapted from www.amarnaproject.com)\n\nEl-Amarna was not confined to the east side. It extended west to Tuna el-Gebel on the western bank of the Nile, which encompassed most of the agricultural land required to feed the city population. The complete terrain of the city was marked by sixteen rock stelae carved into the high cliffs that encircled the capital and on one level functioned as its boundary stones. The stelae rise to a height of about 29.5 feet (9 m) in the form of flat, elongated rectangles with rounded tops, which project out from the cliff surfaces (figure 1.3). The lower two-thirds of each stela are covered with a long hieroglyphic inscription. The upper third displays a central image of the sun disk Aten with his personified rays. Under the rays, Akhenaten, his wife Nefertiti, and their daughters are assembled in varied groupings bringing offerings to Aten. Their figures are carved in a sunken low-relief style characteristic of the Amarna Period: the body outlines curve and are sunk into the rock while the body volumes swell out in convex masses. Many stelae are accompanied by high-relief statues of Akhenaten and his family arranged on both sides of the stelae bottoms. The stelae were first professionally documented by W. Flinders Petrie in the 1890s. He named each one with an English capital letter, leaving gaps in the sequence to allow for future discoveries. Petrieâs list included A, B, and F on the west bank at Tuna el-Gebel and J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, R, S, U, and V for the east bank.20 Shortly after Petrie, the boundary stelae were independently investigated by the French Egyptologist Jean Daressy and a German expedition led by Georg Steindorff. Since then, Stela X has been added by Norman de Garis Davies in 1901 and Stela H by H. Fenwick in 2006.21 Daviesâs publication counts as the most thorough and authoritative documentation of the stelae in the first half of the twentieth century.22 The most recent academic full documentation and translation of Akhenatenâs boundary monuments was published by William J. Murnane and Charles C. van Sicklen.23 My discussion below builds on their work and my own field observations.\n\nThe boundary stelae are chronologically ordered according to their texts, which contain two main proclamations made by Akhenaten: the first was given in the fifth year of his reign and the second was made in the sixth year and repeated in his eighth year of office. The first or Earlier Proclamation24 was written on Stelae K, M, and X and was partially quoted in conjunction with Akhenatenâs hypothetical chariot ride above. Since this text contains vital information about the founding of Akhetaten, I cite all its understood passages in an endnote to this chapter.25 The text has the nature of a formula because it uses repetitive sentence structure and was repeated three times in similar variants. It begins with the appearance of Akhenaten on his chariot and the offering event (see above) without explicitly describing a ritual chariot ride within the territory of Akhetaten. He then addresses his court and explains that no human but solely Aten had advised him to build Akhetaten in the Bay of Amarna. He mentions the opening in the eastern cliffs caused by the wadi as the special place Aten had made for himself. Akhenaten continues to describe major buildings in the capital: houses and temples for Aten and palaces for himself and his wife Nefertiti. He speaks of a royal tomb to be made in the eastern mountain designated as the eternal resting place for himself, Nefertiti, and their daughter Meritaten, and of tombs prepared for some of the priests. The style of the written and perhaps spoken words reflects that Akhenaten conceptualized his land and by extension the world as centered in Akhetaten from which the cardinal directions were defined. The second or Later Proclamation from year 6 recorded on Stelae A, B, F, J, N, P, Q, R, S, U, and V extends the limits of Akhetaten and reemphasizes the dedication of all the enclosed land to Aten. It was repeated in regnal year 8. This text constitutes the key document that offers clear structural concepts about the design of el-Amarna in its natural setting. It is indeed a unique case in architectural history that researchers have access to textual sources over 3,000 years old that closely reflect the vision of a patron, that have partly survived the ravages of time, and that can be translated by epigraphers. I reference each section and cite the essential passages explaining the layout of el-Amarna in full below (see appendix 1.a.\n\nFigure 1.4. Map of boundary stelae marking the territory of el-Amarna. (Adapted from www.amarnaproject.com)\n\nOf the sixteen boundary stelae total, I have documented seven that I briefly discuss here. Stela X designates the northern limit of el-Amarna and marks the point where the cliffs close back in on the Nile River, leaving only a narrow desert strip. It is squarely aligned with Stela A on the west bank (figure 1.4). On the map, the connecting line slopes down from Stela A, which sits further north and defines the northern boundary of the capital.26 Stela X and Stelae M and K, which mark the southern limit, were the original Year 5 boundary stelae, probably set up first by order of Akhenaten. They contain the text passages of the Earlier Proclamation. Stela X sits up in the cliffs overlooking the Nile Valley. In comparison to other boundary stelae, the monument is in a medium state of preservation (figure 1.5). The lower rectangular area has partly disappeared and the text is terribly eroded. In the top figurative panel, the Aten disk is clearly recognizable and the outlines of the heads of Akhenaten and Nefertiti appear to the left, bathed in the rays of Aten. There is no evidence of statues accompanying this monument.\n\nFigure 1.5. Boundary Stela X in situ. (Photograph by Brian Garrett)\n\nStela M is situated in the south where the cliffs close the Bay of Amarna more tightly than in the north. This stela constitutes the second in the set of the original Year 5 boundary markers. The form of Stela M is well visible but its details are badly eroded except for the Aten disk and its handed rays at the very top. There are no traces of statues. Stela M is immediately followed by boundary stelae L, K, and J, all of which are accessed on a continuous ledge in the cliffs. Stela L constitutes an abbreviated version of a boundary stela. It is a rectangular tablet with text, lacking sunken relief and three-dimensional imagery. Stela K is in a better state of preservation. The rays of the Aten growing fingers, an offering table, and the body outlines of two or three figures are easily identified. The weathering pattern on the surface appears to be different from that seen on Stelae M and J. The picture plane of Stela K retains a smooth layer whereas the other stelae show deep erosion pockets. This could imply that the carvers treated the surface of Stela K in some form. Stela K was accompanied by statues. Stela J is poorly preserved today. Only fragments of the body outlines of some of the main figures, part of the sun disk, and sections of hieroglyphs remain recognizable. No three-dimensional statues stood by its sides. Stela J roughly aligns with Stela F on the west bank to define the southern limit of the capital (figure 1.4).\n\nStelae V and U occupy the cliffs north of the Royal Wadi. Stela V has almost completely crumbled away and only disjointed hieroglyphs are recognizable. Stela U, on the other hand, is one of the best-preserved boundary stelae. It sits just north of the entrance to the Royal Wadi and can be easily reached by road. This location could suggest that it marked the destination of Akhenatenâs first west-east chariot ride and the site of his grand offering to Aten during the founding events of the city. The text, however, renders the Later Proclamation from Year 6 and therefore it is more likely that Stela U constructed a place where the founding rituals were reenacted. The monument measures 7.6 m from top to bottom. The top panel displays the expected sun disk with its anthropomorphized rays extending to Akhenaten, Nefertiti, and daughters and to the numerous stacked offerings they brought. The main rectangular portion of the stela is taken up by the long inscription. Statues of royal family members framed the sides of Stela U. Today a level space has been created in front of the monument and it is likely that a stage-like area existed during Akhenatenâs time where offerings to Aten were repeated. Looking west from the elevated point of Stela U, the vast spatial extent of the Bay of Amarna can be experienced, reflecting Akhenatenâs ambitions, if a full build-out had been achieved.27\n\nAnother group of stelae was carved at a distance of several kilometers from the southern cliffs into the desert. This group is composed of Stelae S, R, H, Q, and P. The locations of these monuments define a tract of land behind the arc of the cliffs. So far, no evidence has been found of what Akhenaten envisioned there. Stela N was encountered isolated at a shorter distance from the edge of the southern cliffs and behind the south stela group M, L, K, and J. I have investigated Stela R. The monument has been badly damaged by attempts of looters to cut out rectangular sections. In the top panel, part of the offerings and the profile legs of the royal figures remain visible; below, disjointed text segments are clearly recognizable. Stela R was accompanied by statues.\n\nThree boundary stelae A, B, and F were set up at the cliffs on the west bank of the Nile, overlooking the floodplain that provided the agricultural zone of el-Amarna. Stela A is very well preserved and can easily be visited from the existing road. The top panel still displays the complete iconographic formula of the offering scene in Akhenatenâs characteristic style (figure 1.6, left): the deeply sunken relief of the Aten sun disk hovers above with his shallow-fingered rays extending below. The figures of Akhenaten and Nefertiti stand on the right side in profile view, reaching their arms toward the Aten. Behind them appear two of their daughters. The royal family members are represented in strict traditional hierarchical scale. The carving style, on the other hand, is characteristic of the Amarna Period: this means it prefers (1) curving lines over vertical and horizontal lines and (2) sunken relief on outside monuments to produce an animated play of sunlight and shadow.\n\nFigure 1.6. Boundary Stela A, Tuna el-Gebel. Left: Boundary Stela A. (Photograph by Brian Garrett) Right center: Modern stair access to Boundary Stela A, 2008. (Photograph by Brian Garrett) Right: Ancient lines of stones marking access path to Boundary Stela A. (Adapted from www.amarnaproject.com)\n\nA table overloaded with rich offerings stands in the central axis below the Aten disk. The left side of the top panel, both sides of the sun disk, and the long rectangular register below are filled with lengthy inscriptions recording the Later Proclamation. Stela A was joined by sculpted figure groups. The Amarna Project recorded parallel lines of stones delimiting an ancient road leading up to the monument in 1975 (figure 1.6, right). These lines have been destroyed by the masonry balustrades and stairway constructed for tourists. Nevertheless their documentation provides invaluable evidence for the ritual use of the boundary stela. An ancient access road or ramp confirms that the monument did not lie isolated and forgotten but was periodically visited. Stela A functioned as the northwestern boundary marker in the Later Proclamation.\n\nStela B is situated a short distance south of Stela A in the western cliffs. The right side of the rounded top panel is well preserved, whereas its left side has been destroyed by natural weathering processes (figure 1.7). The sun disk and Akhenaten and Nefertiti are sunk into the rock surface whereas the anthropomorphized rays of the Aten and the figures of the daughters are less deeply carved. The lengthy hieroglyphic text of the Later Proclamation fills the middle section and the lower rectangular register. Stela B is still framed by multiple statues. On the left side (from the viewerâs perspective), the remnants of two tall and two small standing figures are clearly defined and on the right side, another pair of tall standing figures is visible. They surely represent the royal family. Stela F was placed further south and roughly aligns with Stela J on the east bank, together forming the southern boundary of el-Amarna.\n\nFigure 1.7. Boundary Stela B. (Photograph by Brian Garrett)\n\nThese stelae framed and outlined the space of the capital (figure 1.4). Although lines drawn between Stelae X and A in the north and Stelae J and F in the south do not run precisely east-west, the aerial distance is almost equivalent: 19.2 km in the north and 20.0 km in the south.28 Other scholars have mapped out that the boundary stelae, the temples, and the royal tomb formed a series of rectangles that are multiples or fragments of the proportions of the Great Temple of Aten in the city center.29 In this manner, el-Amarna was defined as a temple to the Aten on various scales rather than as a city.30 Further measurements have indicated that the distance between Boundary Stelae X and M equaled four times the distance between the temples of Karnak and Luxor at Thebes, the processional route established by Amenhotep III for the Opet festival, and that distances between some of the buildings in the Central City were also based upon the processional routes from Karnak.31 It would appear that conceptualizing the built landscape as a proportional unit may have constituted one of Akhenatenâs important design elements. However, proportions, measurements, and alignments in ancient Egypt should not be approached through the lens of accuracy practiced in Western science. In the eyes of ancient Egyptians, such spatial relations were primarily visual: it was most important that they could be experienced and perceived rather than quantified.32\n\nIt remains unclear whether it was Akhenatenâs original vision to build out the entire Bay of Amarna. As indicated earlier, this turned out to be impractical since wells had to be cut too deep more than about one mile inland from the river. Water had to be carried to any settlement situated closer to the cliffs, such as the Workmenâs Village. Therefore el-Amarna was organized along a wide north-south avenue placed close to the transition point between the fertile valley and the desert. It extended from the northern to the southern ends of the bay (figure 1.8).33 All the major government buildings commissioned by Akhenaten, such as the Aten temples, palaces, administrative facilities, and storehouses, stood fronting this road. It was the main route the court would have used when attending functions in various sectors of the capital and it is therefore called the Royal Road. The land east of the Royal Road was not uniformly flat but was divided into a series of plateaus by dry but deep gullies. The main sectors of the capital occupy these extensive plateau formations.\n\nFigure 1.8. Map of the ancient capital el-Amarna. (Adapted from Silverman et al. 2006)\n\nMoving from south to north along the Royal Road, we briefly discuss these sectors.34 The South Suburb and the Main City constituted primary residential zones, where most of the commoner population lived. The Central City contained the Aten temples, the main palace, and all official state buildings and formed the core of Akhenatenâs capital (figure 1.9). All of its buildings stand in a general alignment with the Royal Wadi in the east. The Central City constructs the space where the Royal Road intersects the east-west solar axis and thus provides the stage where the ruler and the god symbolically interacted in worldly matters.\n\nFigure 1.9. Plan of the Central City of el-Amarna. (Adapted from Silverman et al. 2006)\n\nMost of the central buildings were deliberately destroyed by King Horemheb at the end of the Eighteenth Dynasty in a reaction against Akhenaten and his policies. Nevertheless, decades-long and painstaking fieldwork by Egyptian and British archaeologists has recovered many fragments, restored certain sectors, drawn up detailed plans, and created a digital model of Akhenatenâs Amarna (www.amarnaproject.com). The structures of primary importance were the Great Aten Temple and the Small Aten Temple, separated by the Kingâs House and the Great Palace. The Great Aten Temple is a massive, rectangular, walled enclosure measuring 900 feet wide and 2,500 feet long, with one entrance from the Royal Road on the western short side (figure 1.9). Upon entering, the visitor passes through a series of courtyards of diminishing sizes and accessed through pylons. Although pylon faÃ§ades are a traditional element of New Kingdom temple architecture, the row of freestanding courtyards defining the east-west axis, which the pylons introduce here, is entirely unroofed and known as the Gem-Pa-Aten (the Aten-Is-Found). It was one of Akhenatenâs grand innovations to omit roofs so that the interaction with the Sun deity could be more direct and personal. In conventional New Kingdom temples, on the other hand, architectural spaces became more enclosed and darker as the visitor advanced toward the sanctuary, which housed a statue the god inhabited. This kind of spatial experience can still be felt at the temple reconstructions at Karnak, Edfu, or Philae. Aten, on the other hand, was present in the direct rays of the sun.35 The Gem-Pa-Aten was filled with altars and flanked by grids of hundreds of open-air offering tables. Outside the southern perimeter wall, extensive production facilities, such as bakeries, and storerooms were located to provide the massive quantities of gifts to Aten. In the eastern part of the enclosure stood a butchersâ yard and a T-shaped sanctuary housing statues of the royal family. The Great Aten Temple probably remained unfinished because the large middle section of the enclosure was never built out.\n\nThe Small Aten Temple constitutes a much smaller rectangular enclosure that, like the Great Aten Temple, opens toward the Royal Road through pylons. It houses a total of three pylon faÃ§ades, and a T-shaped sanctuary with statues of royal family members. Storerooms and manufacturing facilities to produce the large-scale offerings for Aten were situated south of the enclosed compound. It is noteworthy that neither Aten temple contained an actual shrine to house a cult image of the god, as one would expect to find in traditional New Kingdom temples. As Silverman et al. reason, âthe object of worship was not a statue but the visible sun in the sky.â36 Akhenaten had three-dimensional portrait statues made of himself but his god was only depicted as the sun disk with fingered rays in sunken relief as seen on the boundary stelae. Thus the primary presence of Aten was in the form of the sun as he rose and set daily on the eastern and western horizons of Akhetaten. This vision fundamentally guided the practices that constructed el-Amarna as an ideological performance stage.\n\nThe Great Palace runs along the western side of the Royal Road and was designed in a north-south orientation. This same orientation has been documented in the North Riverside Palace. Silverman et al. view the north-south direction as a symbolic axis of royal authority that parallels the flow of the Nile and intersects with the east-west axis of the rising and setting Aten.37 The southern end of the Great Palace is marked by a vast pillared hall. To the north extend multiple open courtyards once graced with colossal figures of Akhenaten and Nefertiti. A distinctive architectural feature in the Great Palace as well as in the Aten temples was an extensive use of raised platforms and podia accessed by walled ramps with decorated balustrades.38 The scenes on the balustrades depicted the royal family worshipping the Aten and bringing offerings similar to those described on the boundary stelae as well as a repetition of cartouches with the names and titles of Aten, Akhenaten, and Nefertiti. These decorated ramps choreographed ritual movements and we will return to them in the discussion of el-Amarna as a performance stage.\n\nMost Egyptologists understand the Great Palace as the main building in which Akhenaten would have conducted the political and administrative functions of his court.39 The Great Palace was connected with the Kingâs House situated between the two Aten temples by a bridge spanning the Royal Road. The Kingâs House lacks public courtyards and is composed of smaller more private spaces. Its eastern section exhibits two long rows of storerooms. It is generally interpreted as a temporary residence of the ruler where Akhenaten and his family would have been housed while involved in state business in the Central City.\n\nTo the east of the Kingâs House and the Small Aten Temple, the foundations and remains of numerous complexes associated with government functions have been mapped. Most outstanding is a compound characterized by small intricate rooms, which can positively be identified as the House of Royal Foreign Correspondence because its stamped bricks show this name in hieroglyphs. The important Amarna letters, a corpus of about 350 documents written on clay tablets and detailing international royal correspondence, were discovered here in the nineteenth century.40\n\nThe primary residential zones of el-Amarna were the Main City, the South Suburb, and the North Suburb (figure 1.8). They were filled with large walled estates and tracts of smaller houses, reflecting social hierarchies. Some of the areas of habitation were never fully completed; in particular, the northeastern edge of the North Suburb.\n\nEgyptologists reason that the actual residence of Akhenaten and the royal family was probably not in the Great Palace but in the North Riverside Palace located in the North City at the far northern end of the Bay of Amarna. This palace and the whole North City lie badly destroyed but archaeologists have identified a large rectangular complex with bastioned enclosure walls and a painted gateway on the west side of the Royal Road. They interpret it as the residential palace of Akhenaten in contrast to the Great Palace, which is seen as the palace of public affairs of the state.41 Another possibility is that the northern and southern palaces were seen as metaphors for the historical division of Egypt into the north (Lower Egypt) and the south (Upper Egypt), regions unified at the dawn of the dynastic age. The north-south division runs like a trope through Egyptian history and is commonly referenced in royal architecture and iconography, for instance, the North and South Palaces in the funerary complex of Djoser at Saqqara. Akhenaten may have continued this tradition.42\n\nSouth of the North City stands a third palace, known as the North Palace. It is the best preserved and documented of all the royal buildings at el-Amarna and thus presents the unique opportunity to learn details about Egyptian palace design in the New Kingdom. The North Palace stands east of the Royal Road. It was designed as a rectangular walled enclosure. Its short side fronts the Royal Road and provides the only entrance. The visitor enters into a central courtyard, the rear side of which is defined by a massive decorated pylon. The pylon leads to a large pool that reached a depth of 14 feet. The royal residential area extends behind the pool. Many of the courtyards and structures flanking the central axis on the north and south sides seem to have had administrative and storage functions. Interestingly, in the northern buildings, material evidence was found indicating that they housed domestic animals, such as sheep, goats, gazelles, cattle, and birds. This evidence consists of mangers decorated with animal imagery and tethering stones. The quarters of the royal family along the east side of the palace complex were beautifully decorated with wall murals. A scene displaying birds in marshes in a vibrant blue, green, and red color scheme was found in a small room surrounding a sunken garden that was fed by a water conduit from the central pool. The excavators interpreted the courtyard with the sunken garden as an aviary.43 A throne on a dais marked the terminus of the central axis of the North Palace. It was approached through a stone portico and two pillared rooms of diminishing sizes. There is evidence that the North Palace belonged to Meritaten, the rulerâs oldest daughter, by the end of Akhenatenâs reign. Her name glyph appears on a doorjamb, carved over an earlier royal name.\n\nThe three palaces discussed raise stimulating questions about similarities and differences with regard to their design, location, and usage. Although our material data are limited, a distinction between the Great Palace as the setting for state business and the North Riverside Palace as Akhenatenâs primary residence seems valid. The North Palace stands out because it sits east of the Royal Road, is oriented east, and it mixes design features related to the display of political authority with animal yards and water and garden areas. Perhaps it had a more ceremonial character and constituted a micro- materialization of one of Akhenatenâs hymns to Aten.44 The axial design including the pylon and leading up to the throne dais is shared with New Kingdom temples. As indicated above, in the temple, the central axis terminates in a small and dark sanctuary where the statue of the deity resides. At Akhetaten, the image of the god has been replaced by the living pharaoh. From this perspective, design criteria for temple and palace overlapped and could not be strictly separated: the house of Aten was also the house of Akhenaten and vice versa.45\n\nThe final royal building to be mentioned as one of the significant building blocks of the urban design of el-Amarna is the so-called Maruaten, marking the southern end of the Royal Road. Its full name was Pa-Maru-en-Pa-Aten, or âThe-Viewing-Place-of-the-Aten,â and it contained one of the two sunshades belonging to Meritaten. The overall complex consists of two rectangular brick enclosures. The core of the main enclosure is a large artificial lake with a stone causeway leading into the water from the northwest. Similar to the North Palace, planted garden areas surrounded the lake. Excavators identified skeletal remains of greyhounds in a small building abutting the northwestern enclosure wall. Storerooms in a long structure on the northeast side of the lake contained wine jars with labels naming various institutions at el-Amarna that had supplied the wine.\n\nThe best preserved and probably the most potent ritual constructions of the Maruaten occupied the eastern corner of the main enclosure. A small island crowned by what was likely Meritatenâs sunshade shrine and a T-shaped altar was created with a surrounding moat. Northeast of the moat extended formal garden plots as well as eleven T-shaped interlocking tanks. Segments of the pavement surrounding these tanks were recovered, showing painted plaster scenes of various water plants and birds. As in the North Palace, the spatial layout of the Maruaten, its furnishings, occupants, and iconography are suggestive of a celebration of the living world dependent on Aten."
