        "text": "The long-lost mummy of ancient Egypt's legendary Queen Nefertiti might have finally been discovered after thousands of years, according to Egyptologist and archaeologist Zahi Hawass.\n\nAs reported widely in both Egyptian media and internationally, Hawass, the former Egyptian minister of antiquities, is currently preparing an exhibit on the women in ancient Egypt called \"Daughters of the Nile.\" As part of this, he claims that he is certain as to the location of the famous Egyptian queen's remains.\n\nWho was ancient Egypt's Queen Nefertiti?\n\nNefertiti lived in ancient Egypt during a period of great wealth and prosperity in the New Kingdom, in what was arguably ancient Egypt's golden age, as part of the 18th dynasty in the 1300s BCE.\n\nShe was married to Pharaoh Akhenaten, thought by some to be the pharaoh of Exodus, and the two of them are known to have led a religious revolution, changing Egypt's religion to monotheism, worshiping the sun disc, Aten. This changed after Akhenaten's death, however.\n\nAfterwards, many speculate that Nefertiti actually ruled Egypt as pharaoh under the name Neferneferuaten before the rise of Pharaoh Tutankhamen, also known as King Tut, though this is something historians continue to debate. For his part, Hawass says she ruled for at least three years under the name Smenkhkare.\n\nRegardless, she is one of the most famous female figures in ancient Egypt, alongside Nefertari, Cleopatra and Hatshepsut.\n\nWhere is Queen Nefertiti supposedly buried?\n\nAccording to Hawass, Nefertiti is likely among the bodies in the massive ancient Egyptian tomb complex known as the Valley of the Kings. In particular, Hawass told Spanish outlet The Independent that there are two unidentified mummies there, currently designated KV21A and KV21B. He is certain that these two are Nefertiti and her daughter Ankhesenamun.\n\n\"In October we will be able to announce the discovery of the mummy of Ankhesenamun, Tutankhamun's wife, and her mother, Nefertiti,\"\n\nZahi Hawass\n\n\"In October we will be able to announce the discovery of the mummy of Ankhesenamun, Tutankhamun's wife, and her mother, Nefertiti,\" Hawass told The Independent.\n\nIf true, it would solve a long-standing mystery of what happened to Nefertiti's remains.\n\nIs this really Nefertiti?\n\nOne issue with Hawass's claims is that there have been several other supposed discoveries of her remains over the years, with three others having happened within the last seven years.\n\nStay updated with the latest news!\n\nSubscribe to The Jerusalem Post Newsletter\n\nBut time will tell once Hawass announces his findings in October."
