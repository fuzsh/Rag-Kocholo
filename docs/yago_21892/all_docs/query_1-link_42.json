        "text": "The idea of a linear chronology regards Karnak and postcards Karnak concerns me. Why can't Meritaten be shown both at Akhetaten and Karnak in Year 5 (for example?) and Meketaten in Year 6 at Akhetaten and Karnak (for example)?\n\nThe instances of Amenophis IV at Karnak would seem to precede Year 5 at Akhetaten, because the name was later altered in almost all cases to Akhenaten presumsnly in or after Year 5.\n\nThe evidences of Nefertiti and Neferneferuaten at Karnak may follow a similar trajectory. And this does not necessarily mean altering Nefertiti or adding names to Nefertiti, but actually continuing works at Karnak in or after Year 5 where her new name (Neferneferuaten) is being recorded.\n\nMy thoughts are on a similar trajectory, for example, that pdf by Hoffmeier & van Dijk doesn't help us place the use of that intriguing name - Akh.et-n-hyes. Was Nefertiti using it at the end of the period, or at the beginning?\n\nRecently, in my view of the Amarna chronology, I initially thought she used it after Akhenaten died, when she was sole ruler herself. But, I'm conflicted as to why she should concern herself with her husband if he is dead.\n\nWouldn't it seem more likely that she used the name while he was alive, but in some physical condition that prevented him from fulfilling his role as first priest of the Aten?\n\nSo, the question for me is, what was her royal position when she used that name?\n\nI hoped to see some hint at her position when the name was discovered at Tell Borg, but alas not.\n\nInterestingly, for me, we see Nefertiti officiating as First Priest(?) of Aten in several reliefs at Hwt-bnbn, within Gm-p3-Aten, on the east of Karnak.\n\nAlthough I see no examples of Ak.et-n-hyes on the surviving talatat from these temples, it would be the most likely location to find it, given the many reliefs there are of Nefertiti officiating under the rays of the Aten, with no hint of the presence of Akhenaten in the ceremonies.\n\nThere is the smaller female figure of a daughter accompanying her in the ritual, but the cartouche of this daughter is blank.\n\nAnd, what does the daughters name in a cartouche tell us? - in all family scenes where the daughters are present, their names are not in cartouches.\n\nDoes this suggest the unnamed daughter is no longer a child, perhaps a young adult, perhaps this ceremony took place later in the Amarna period?\n\nThere's just so many questions about why Nefertiti is so prominent at both Hwt-bnbn & Gm-p3-Aten, and another detail, it's not Gm-p3-Aten, but Gm.t-p3-Aten - with the feminine 't', - why?\n\nWas this temple made for Nefertiti?\n\nWickerman:\n\n\"My thoughts are on a similar trajectory, for example, that pdf by Hoffmeier & van Dijk doesn't help us place the use of that intriguing name - Akh.et-n-hyes. Was Nefertiti using it at the end of the period, or at the beginning?\n\nRecently, in my view of the Amarna chronology, I initially thought she used it after Akhenaten died, when she was sole ruler herself. But, I'm conflicted as to why she should concern herself with her husband if he is dead.\"\n\nMery Neferkheperure mery Waenra akh.et-n-hyes are peculiarly personal for mine, and just don't feel like terms you'd use in relation to a dead husband. You'll notice that with the penny dropping for me that the Pairi graffito does not mention Akhenaten, I immediately think Year 3 of Ankhkheperure Neferneferuaten - with husband already dead. Though, did Nefertiti rule for some of that time as coregent? I think she might have. (Kedi Box). How long, though?\n\nW:\n\n\"Wouldn't it seem more likely that she used the name while he was alive, but in some physical condition that prevented him from fulfilling his role as first priest of the Aten?\"\n\nI have posted here that it has a certain specificity. Just as terms like GRW or God's Father, among meanings, seem to suggest certain specificities and roles. 'Manager' can have a general meaning, but indicate also many duties that also evolve.\n\nW:\n\n\"So, the question for me is, what was her royal position when she used that name?\n\nI hoped to see some hint at her position when the name was discovered at Tell Borg, but alas not.\"\n\nIt appears to be found unassociated with Akhenaten's names, except on the altered Coregency Stele. Which I must go back ad check. It was discussed endlessly on the Carter Box thread but I can't recall off hand the before and after....\n\nW:\n\n\"Interestingly, for me, we see Nefertiti officiating as First Priest(?) of Aten in several reliefs at Hwt-bnbn, within Gm-p3-Aten, on the east of Karnak.\"\n\nInteresting. Never looked at it that way. Never got to the point f finding out what names she uses on those scenes. The other day, it occurred to me, though, that Meritaten acts in the position one might expect a GRW to act.\n\nW:\n\n\"Although I see no examples of Ak.et-n-hyes on the surviving talatat from these temples, it would be the most likely location to find it, given the many reliefs there are of Nefertiti officiating under the rays of the Aten, with no hint of the presence of Akhenaten in the ceremonies.\"\n\nGood point. Are her names used there? And what are they?\n\n\"There is the smaller female figure of a daughter accompanying her in the ritual, but the cartouche of this daughter is blank.\"\n\nI've always seen her mentioned as 'Meritaten.' But it's a good question. Did not know of cartouches or blank cartouches. These things you stumble over if you keep coming back to poke around in the ashes. If you keep walking around in circles, you never know what you might see! Lol.\n\nW:\n\n\"And, what does the daughters name in a cartouche tell us? - in all family scenes where the daughters are present, their names are not in cartouches.\"\n\nGRW? Which makes me instantly ask: when? When were the scenes made? [What of things like the hwt of Ankhkheperure?]\n\nW:\n\n\"Does this suggest the unnamed daughter is no longer a child, perhaps a young adult, perhaps this ceremony took place later in the Amarna period?\"\n\nBingo!? I've cut and posted your quote and only responding as I read it! I do like the colour of your thoughts here. Like, because I think you're asking such incisive questions!\n\nW:\n\n\"There's just so many questions about why Nefertiti is so prominent at both Hwt-bnbn & Gm-p3-Aten, and another detail, it's not Gm-p3-Aten, but Gm.t-p3-Aten - with the feminine 't', - why?\n\nWas this temple made for Nefertiti?\"\n\nI think Ridley mentions that. Nefertiti predominates. With Meritaten in the high 90 percentile compared to her two next sisters, and Meketaten only about 8 percent. Though where the names of the three eldest daughters are found over the breadth of Karnak, I don't know.\n\nI have tried to ascertain what 'forms' of Nefertiti's names were found in those scenes with Meritaten. Interestingly, I have seen her as a child. But both you and I have noticed the possibility she is depicted like a GRW. That empty cartouche is new to me! It's erasure tells a story. What story, though? If Meritaten is depicted as a GRW, then it uncannily resembles the scene in Meryre II's tomb. And Meritaten, shown small, resembles traditional scenes of Pharaoh and GRW, with the queen shown in a diminutive form.\n\nIf some of these Karnak Nefertiti-Meritaten scenes are late, then the 'unfinished' Meryre II scene might marry up to some degree as being 'late' too.\n\nAnkhkheperure Neferneferuaten is shown as being on good terms with Amun in the Pairi graffiti. But she still had her 'Aten' name. As I've often wondered, was Nefertiti re-embracing Amun without throwing out Aten with the bath water? Was she going to keep Akhetaten as a cult city while still recognising Waset as Amun's cult city? All the gods were everywhere, but main cults were intimately attached to main cities and towns.\n\nAs always, I wonder if Nefertiti's name change to 'Smenkhkare' was a further softening, or sweeping under the carpet, of the excesses of Atenism aggression, while not throwing out Aten, itself, with the bath water. [Sone think Smenkhkare is a boy, of course, let's no forget that].\n\nBack to to akhetenhyes. It differs from Ankhkheperure Neferneferuaten and Neferneferuaten Waenra. The latter case suggest Nefertiti as coregent/wife to me. Akhetenhyes suggests Nefertit's activities on Akhenaten's behalf. Suggesting that something real is occurring in her actions.\n\nDodson lists this form: Ankhkheperure Waenra, Neferneferuaten akhetenhyes. He puts them together, like they were found in one record. (Frustratingly, he doesn't source it!) Is this a further chronological step on from Ankhkheperure Neferkheperure Neferneferuaten Waenra? At Tell el-Borg, Neferneferuaten akhetenhyes is found alone. As is Ankhkheperure Waenra. All these jigsaw pieces I feel if gathered together might give us a better hint of chronology and affairs.\n\nAlways I come back to the idea of Akhenaten's mental and/or physical deterioration.\n\nAnyway, love your work here."
