        "text": "Join Deyanira, a Puerto Rican woman, as she time walks and channels her ancestors gaining the wisdom she needs to step into her power and defeat the Christian Brotherhood. She is the Oracle. Here to usher in the spiritual warfare against capitalism colonialism and the corruption of Christianity. Her powers and destiny terrify her.\n\nOn Deyanira’s journey, she discovers secret lineages, corrupt Gods, and religions, is plucked from the island she loved, transplanted to the south side of Chicago, and loses more loved ones than anyone should.\n\nDeyanira has the weight of the world on her shoulders all while balancing her own humanity. Her mother wound is gaping begging for her attention. Her healing isn’t linear and her confidence wavers. She has all these powers and never quite feels like she is good enough or ready to be the powerful force everyone keeps telling her she is. Will the enemies catch her and harness her power for themselves? Will she get the training she needs to triumph?"
