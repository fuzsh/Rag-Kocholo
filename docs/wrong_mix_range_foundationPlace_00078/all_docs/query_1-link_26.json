        "text": "A message from Oracle’s CSO\n\nWhen it comes to sustainability, Oracle is action oriented and outcome driven. We know that ensuring the health of our planet calls for bold and urgent action. To this end, we’ve embedded sustainability throughout our organization and business processes, including our value chain. This means creating a more circular economy and effectively managing climate-related risks companywide. It means empowering our employees to make decisions that put the planet first. It means providing our customers globally with a zero-emissions cloud by 2025. And it means committing to achieving net zero by 2050 and halving our value chain emissions by 2030.\n\nOracle was founded in 1977 with a goal to organize large amounts of data in a way that allowed for efficient storage and quick retrieval. Decades later, we still recognize the value of using data to solve some of the planet’s most complex problems. Companywide, we rely on data to operationalize sustainability, protect natural resources, reduce waste, and achieve energy efficiency.\n\nWhile what we do ourselves is of paramount importance, helping our customers on their sustainability journeys has an impact many times greater than our own. I encourage you to read our customer stories and learn more about the technology solutions, such as sustainable computing infrastructure, that are helping them innovate, build sustainable supply chains, and perform environmental and social planning and reporting. Many of our industry solutions, including our Energy and Water solutions, are also playing a critical role in driving the transformation needed to ensure a more sustainable future for our planet.\n\nWe believe access to data and technology can help today’s sustainability leaders get better information and make more informed decisions. Together, we can make a difference.\n\n—Jon Chorley, Chief Sustainability Officer, Oracle"
