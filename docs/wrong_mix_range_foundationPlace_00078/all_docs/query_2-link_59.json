        "text": "British astronaut Tim Peake has reassured that the Boeing test pilots, Sunita Williams and Butch Wilmore, currently aboard the International Space Station (ISS) are in no immediate danger, despite uncertainties regarding their return to Earth. The statement comes after the thrusters used to steer the Starliner spacecraft, which carried Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams to the ISS in early June, malfunctioned.\n\nPeake, speaking to Sky News at the Farnborough International Airshow, expressed confidence in the safety and well-being of the astronauts. \"I know Butch and Suni very well,\" he said. \"The ISS is a fantastic hub with plenty of food and resources. The crew are completely safe and I know the agencies are working on a return option for them.\"\n\nThe astronauts are awaiting a solution from Boeing and NASA to address the thruster issue. Peake emphasized that risk management is a fundamental aspect of human spaceflight. \"Every astronaut has to consider the risks involved in human space flight. It's something we do and go through as individuals to be comfortable with.\"\n\nIn addition to discussing the current situation on the ISS, Peake announced his participation in a new venture with Axiom Space and the UK Space Agency, aiming to send the first commercial mission of UK astronauts into orbit. His role will involve securing at least Â£200 million in private sponsorship for the mission."
