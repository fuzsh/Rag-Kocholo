The ASF board agreed to the terms\n\nafter vigorous discussions last evening.\n\n\"We never considered the possibility of selling the ASF,\" said Jim\n\nJagielski, Chairman of the ASF, \"but Oracle made us a simply fantastic\n\noffer. Larry himself flew out last week to meet with us to address\n\nour concerns.\"\n\nAs part of the agreement, Oracle obtains even more of the crucial\n\nLAMP-stack software products.\n\n\"It was Oracle’s admission that the Web is more than ‘just’ Java\n\nor databases that finalized the decision for us,\" said Justin Erenkrantz,\n\nDirector and President of the ASF.\n\n2009 marked the 10th Anniversary of the ASF.\n\nWe will be communicating updates about the status of our projects and our license in the near future. As a community based organization, we want to ensure the best experience for our existing committers, contributors, and users, under our new arrangement."
