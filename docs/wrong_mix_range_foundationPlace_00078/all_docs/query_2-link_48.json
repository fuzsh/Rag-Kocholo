By having Oracle match my donation to Louisville Community Foundation, we were able to buy 140 winter jackets, hats, and pairs of gloves for children, helping to ensure every child has comfort and warmth. Big thanks to Oracle for helping us touch the lives of those in need.”\n\nGreg Anderson Group Vice President, North America Applications Solution Engineering, Oracle\n\n“We experienced an apartment fire this year and our family lost everything except the clothes we were wearing. We had to quickly find a new place to live and buy new clothes, necessities, and furniture. We are so thankful to Oracle Cares for taking a little stress away by providing financial assistance during this time.”\n\nOracle Cares hardship grant recipient"
