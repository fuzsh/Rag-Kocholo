        "text": "1. Oracle :\n\nOracle is a relational database management system (RDBMS). It was developed by Oracle Corporation in 1980. It is the first database designed for grid computing that provides the most flexible and cost-effective way to manage information and application. It runs on major platforms like Windows, Unix, Linux, and macOS. It is a relational database in which data is accessed by the user through the application or query language called SQL.\n\n2. CouchDB :\n\nCouchDB is an open-source document-oriented NoSQL database that uses multiple formats and protocols to store, transfer, and process its data, it uses JSON to store data, JavaScript as its query language using MapReduce, and HTTP for an API. It was developed by Apache Software Foundation and initially released in 2005. It is written in Erlang.\n\nDifference between Oracle and CouchDB :\n\nS.NO. ORACLE COUCHDB 1. It was developed by Oracle Corporation in 1980. It was developed by Apache Software Foundation in 2005. 2. It is written in C and C++. It is written in Erlang language. 3. It is a commercial software. It is an open-source software. 4. The primary database model for Oracle is Relational DBMS. The primary database model for CouchDB is Document Store. 5. It uses Horizontal partitioning method for storing different data on different nodes. It uses Sharding partitioning method for storing different data on different nodes. 6. The replication methods that Oracle supports are Master-Slave Replication, Master-Master Replication. The replication methods that CouchDB supports are also Master-Slave Replication, Master-Master Replication. 7. Server operating systems for Oracle are Solaris, Linux, OS X, Windows. Server operating systems for CouchDB are Android, BSD, Linux, OS X, Solaris and Windows. 8. ACID properties of transaction are used. It does not provides ACID transactions. 9. Immediate Consistency method ensures consistency. Eventual Consistency method ensures consistency in a distributed system. 10. It provides fine grained access rights according to SQL-standard. It provides access rights for users can be defined per database."
