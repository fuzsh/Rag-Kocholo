That’s why we invest in nonprofit and social impact organizations whose work is critical to solving the challenges facing society today—and tomorrow.\n\nFor more than eight years, Oracle has donated millions of dollars annually to support nonprofit and nongovernmental organizations working to advance education, protect the environment, and strengthen communities in India. Our grantmaking in India primarily supports underserved populations through education and community projects, including digital literacy and remedial classes, life skills and vocational training, employment assistance, healthcare services, and water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) initiatives."
