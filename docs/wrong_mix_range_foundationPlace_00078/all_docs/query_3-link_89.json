        "text": "The name \"Oracle\" comes from early prospecting adventures. Albert Weldon came to the area looking for gold and silver. He and some other companions named their first mine, The Oracle after the ship Weldon had traveled on. The community was later named after its first mine, and thus, indirectly, after a ship.\n\n​\n\nThe community began to grow in the late 1870s, as gold and silver were discovered, and the Christmas and New Year mines opened. By 1880, a post office had been established.\n\n​\n\n​\n\nThe community also became a retreat for people suffering from tuberculosis. The Acadia Ranch – built-in Oracle in 1882 by Edwin S. and Lillian Dodge – was, during this time, a sanitorium.\n\n​\n\nOn January 1, 2017, in the Arizona Daily Star newspaper, historian David Leighton challenged the accepted history of the town of Oracle:\n\n​\n\nHe wrote that Albert Weldon who was born about 1840 in New Brunswick, Canada, traveled on his uncle Capt. A.D. Wood's ship Oracle around Cape Horn at the tip of South America and arrived in California between 1857 and 1860. Weldon enlisted as a private in Company E, 5th California Infantry, of the Union Army, in 1861. This unit was attached to the California Column and soon marched to Tucson where Weldon was posted at a nearby stage station before moving east and eventually being honorably discharged in Mesilla New Mexico in 1864.\n\n​\n\nAfter his military service, he returned to California and was involved in mining and also lumber. In 1876 he returned to Arizona. Within a couple of years, he found a partner in Irishman Jimmie Lee and both men traveled northeast of Tucson into the Santa Catalina Mountains in search of precious metal. Soon he found a mining claim and named it Oracle in honor of his uncle's ship.\n\n​\n\nThe ship Oracle was built under the supervision of Captain Charles E. Ranlett and was constructed for the shipbuilding firm Chapman & Flint of Maine. It was launched in 1853 and was a temperance ship (one that didn't allow alcohol aboard) and sailed to ports across the globe including Melbourne, Australia, and Shanghai, China. It was captained by Weldon's uncle for several years.\n\n​\n\nWeldon was soon joined by Alexander McKay, an immigrant from Scotland who located two mining claims named Christmas and New Years because of the days they were discovered. McKay also built a one-room house, the first in the area, and from it, the village grew. When it was time for a post office to be named, Oracle was the name eventually chosen.\n\n​"
