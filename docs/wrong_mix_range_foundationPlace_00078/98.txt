Oracle’s commitment to open source began long ago, in 1998, when the company released the industry’s first commercial database on Linux. Today, Oracle is involved in many major open-source projects, including Linux, MySQL, OpenJDK, GraalVM, VirtualBox, and others. It is also one of the founding members of the Linux Foundation, the Eclipse Foundation, Open Enterprise Linux Association, and the Java Community Process.

Our open-source development takes place on GitHub, where hundreds of our projects receive more than 3000 pull requests every month from both Oracle and the wider community.

In addition to that, we actively contribute to external open-source projects. For example, Oracle is the #1 contributor for total lines of code changed across the Linux 6.1 kernel.

Our open-source development takes place in several organizations, grouped around projects:

Oracle — our primary GitHub organization;

GraalVM — a high-performance JDK with AOT compilation;

Helidon —a cloud native set of Java libraries for writing microservices;

Java Community Process — developing standard technical specifications for Java technology;

LiveLabs — workshops to build and deploy applications using Oracle’s technologies;

MySQL — the world’s most popular open source database;

OpenJDK — the place to collaborate on an open-source implementation of the Java Platform, Standard Edition, and related projects;

Oracle DevRel technical content: code samples, tutorials, and more;

Oracle GitHub Actions — GitHub Actions from Oracle;

Oracle Sample Projects — new projects and sample applications;

Oracle Terraform Modules — Terraform modules for provisioning Oracle Cloud Infrastructure resources;

Quick Start — automated deployments of enterprise software on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure;

Verrazzano — an open source enterprise container platform curated by Oracle.

In this blog post we want to share the highlights of Oracle’s open source projects and community updates in the past six months.

First, let’s talk about new releases.

New projects

In the past six months we also released several new projects. Here are just a few highlights, you can find more of them at github.com/oracle and github.com/oracle-samples.

Graal Cloud Native

Graal Cloud Native (GCN) is a curated set of open source Micronaut framework modules that simplify multi-cloud application development and are designed from the ground up to be compiled ahead-of-time with GraalVM Native Image. GCN enables easy building of portable cloud native Java microservices that start instantly and use fewer resources to reduce compute costs.

Use the GCN Launcher to build your multi-cloud application starter.

Oracle Java Platform Extension for Visual Studio Code

The Oracle Java Platform extension brings full featured Java development for Maven and Gradle projects to VS Code. It includes features such as project view, autocomplete, error highlighting, debugging, unit testing support for JUnit, and more.

At the core of a VS Code extension supporting a programming language is a language server — a backend that operates the language’s tools and communicates with the IDE using the Language Server Protocol. This Java language server is a slimmed down version of the one developed in the Apache Netbeans project, and it is based on the OpenJDK JDK’s javac compiler for code editing and compilation and on OpenJDK’s debugger interface for debugging. This allows VS Code IDE support for new JDK features as soon as they are introduced, even during Early Access of the JDK. To this effect, this VS Code Extension will support the current JDK releases as well as the next upcoming JDK version.

The extension already has more than 5000 installs on the Visual Studio Code marketplace! Get it from the marketplace or navigate to the project repository to get started.

YO: a CLI client for Oracle Cloud

Yo is a command-line client for managing Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) instances. It makes launching OCI instances as simple as rudely telling your computer “yo, launch an instance”. Its goals are speed, ease of use, and simplicity. It was originally designed to help developers in the Oracle Linux team quickly launch disposable VMs for testing, but rapidly got much wider traction.

A few quick commands to show what you can do with Yo:

# Launch an instance based on your default settings, and SSH into it

yo launch -s

# Launch a flexible instance with given shape, size, and name

yo launch -S VM.Standard.E4.Flex --cpu 3 --mem 12 -n my-vm

# SSH into my-vm

yo ssh my-vm

# Copy files to my-vm

yo scp ./files my-vm:

# Terminate my-vm

yo terminate my-vm
