        "text": "Prime: Art’s Next Generation, features more than 100 of the most distinctive and innovative artists working today, all born between 1980 and 1995, nominated by a jury of the same age group from the world’s premier art institutions. The featured artists in Prime work with a multitude of materials and represent 41 countries. Many engage with traditional mediums— painting, drawing, sculpture, photography, ceramic and collage—in fresh and novel ways, while others have built experimental practices using unconventional and less tangible materials, manipulating light, sound and online digital spaces to realise their artistic visions. Regardless of medium, the artists in Prime are blazing new trails and pushing the boundaries of what art is and can be.\n\nWho is making the most exciting art today? The future generation of museum directors, chief curators, art critics and top collectors answered the question. Selected artists including Kudzanai-Violet Hwami, Tschabalala Self, Salman Toor and Issy Wood reflect the perspectives of nominators who are shaping the contours of our present and future art world. These panellists, including representatives from the Whitney, Barbican, Gagosian, Phillips and more, offer a cutting-edge perspective on the art world’s next generation of stars.\n\nPrime is organised alphabetically by artist, with each artist receiving two full spreads, featuring a newly commissioned text detailing their practice on the first page, followed by three full pages of images—totalling over 750 illustrations.\n\nPrime – Art’s Next Generation: (Pre-order now) Price £55.00 Available from April 7th from HERE\n\nFeatured artists: Lawrence Abu Hamdan, Larry Achiampong, Igshaan Adams, Tony Albert, Farah Al Qasimi, Harold Ancart, Korakrit Arunanondchai, Firelei Báez, Kevin Beasley, Meriem Bennani, Amoako Boafo, Marilyn Boror Bor, Daniel Boyd, Danielle Brathwaite-Shirley, Hannah Brontë, Justin Caguiat, Jordan Casteel, Genevieve Chua, Daniel Crews-Chubb, Julie Curtiss, Jesse Darling, Jonathas de Andrade, Janiva Ellis, rafa esparza, Cécile B.
