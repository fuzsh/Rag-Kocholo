        "text": "ROOSEVELT HOUSE\n\n47-49 East 65th Street\n\nNew York, NY 10065\n\n7:00PM – 9:00PM\n\nFor nearly 30 years, Kate Fowle has developed an international practice as a curator, writer, educator, and director. Currently she is the curatorial senior director at Hauser & Wirth, after being director of MoMA PS1 from 2019–2022. Prior to this she was the inaugural chief curator and artistic director at Garage Museum of Contemporary Art in Moscow, Russia, as well as the director-at-large of Independent Curators International (ICI) in New York, where she was the executive director from 2009–13. Previously, Fowle was the inaugural international curator at the Ullens Center for Contemporary Art in Beijing, China, after co-founding the Master’s Program in Curatorial Practice for California College of the Arts in San Francisco in 2002, for which she was the Chair until 2007. Before moving to the United States, she was co-founder of Smith + Fowle in London from 1996–2002 and curator at the Towner Art Gallery and Museum in Eastbourne, East Sussex from 1994-1996. Initially, Fowle was trained as an artist from 1989-1993.\n\nHer recent curatorial projects include solo exhibitions and commissions with David Adjaye, Rasheed Araeen, John Baldessari, Sammy Baloji, Louise Bourgeois, Marcel Broodthaers, Urs Fischer, Rashid Johnson, Irina Korina, Daniel Lind Ramos, Robert Longo, Anri Sala, Taryn Simon, Juergen Teller, and Rirkrit Tirivanija, as well as co-curating the 2021 Greater New York exhibition at MoMA PS1 and The Paradoxes of Internationalism at the Museo Tamayo in Mexico City. She has written extensively on Ilya Kabakov, Sterling Ruby, Taryn Simon, and Qiu Zhijie among others, and published numerous articles on curating and exhibition histories. Fowle has written three books: Exhibit Russia: The New International Decade 1986-1996 (2016); Rashid Johnson: Within Our Gates (2016); and Proof: Francisco Goya, Sergei Eisenstein, Robert Longo (2017).\n\nFriday, March 17\n\nLeubsdorf Gallery\n\n132 East 68th Street\n\nNew York, NY, 10065\n\nTour 10:30–11:30am, followed by a coffee/tea reception\n\nRSVP here\n\nJoin the Hunter College Art Galleries during Asia Week NY for a morning tour and reception of C. C. Wang: Lines of Abstraction. Led by exhibition co-curator Daniel M. Greenberg, this walkthrough will introduce viewers to the life and art of C.C. Wang (1907-2003). Born to a family of scholar-officials at the twilight of the Qing dynasty, Wang mastered the traditional ink and brush techniques in Republican Shanghai and immigrated to New York City in 1949. Although he is well known for his discerning connoisseurial eye and world class collection of classical Chinese art, Wang’s own artistic practice has long been overlooked. In this walkthrough, we will explore how Wang built upon both his deep knowledge of Chinese painting and the artistic climate in postwar New York to create distinctly cross-cultural works of modern American art.\n\nCurated by Wen-shing Chou and Daniel M. Greenberg with Hans Hofmann Graduate Curatorial Fellow Margaret Liu Clinton.\n\nC. C. Wang: Lines of Abstraction was developed through a two-semester curatorial seminar at Hunter College led by Professor Wen-shing Chou with M.A. Art History students Thais Bignardi-Engstrom, Carolyn Bishop, Rawls Bolton, Jeremy Gloster, Sophie Kaufman, Emerald Lucas, Lindsey Poremba, and Mia Ye.\n\nC. C. Wang: Lines of Abstraction is made possible by the generous support of the James Howell Foundation, the Leubsdorf Fund, the Wolf Kahn Foundation and Emily Mason and Alice Trumbull Mason Foundation on behalf of artists Emily Mason and Wolf Kahn, and the Renate, Hans, and Maria Hofmann Trust.\n\nLinda Goode Bryant, founder of Just Above Midtown and Project EATS in conversation with Thomas (T.) Lax, co-organizing curator of Just Above Midtown: Changing Spaces at the Museum of Modern Art Foundation To-Life Arthur and Carol Kaufman Goldberg Curatorial Lecture\n\nWednesday, February 8 at 7pm\n\nRoosevelt House\n\n47-49 East 65th Street, New York, NY\n\nLinda Goode Bryant’s decades of art-based activism began with her founding of Just Above Midtown gallery (JAM), a self-described laboratory that foregrounded the work of African American artists. After closing JAM, Goode Bryant dedicated herself to filmmaking. Over her nearly 50-year career, Goode Bryant continues to advocate for a connection to “our innate ability to use what we have to create what we need.” Most recently, Goode Bryant has founded Project EATS, a “living installation” of neighborhood-based, small-plot, high-yield farms that use art, urban agriculture, partnerships, and social enterprise to sustainably grow and equitably distribute fresh, local, organically grown food in communities across New York City.\n\nThomas (T.) Jean Lax is a curator, writer, and scholar specializing in Black art and performance. At the Museum of Modern Art, they co-organized the exhibition Just Above Midtown: 1974 to the Present (2022) with Lilia Rocio Taboada in collaboration with JAM’s founder Linda Goode Bryant. In 2019, they worked with colleagues across MoMA on a major rehang of its collection and co-organized the exhibition Judson Dance Theater: The Work is Never Done (2018) with Ana Janevski and Martha Joseph. Their other collaboratively-organized exhibitions include the Projects Series for emerging artists; Unfinished Conversations, inspired by the cultural theorist Stuart Hall; the contemporary art quintennial, Greater New York; and commissions with artists including Neïl Beloufa, Maria Hassabi, and Steffani Jemison. Previously, they worked at The Studio Museum in Harlem for seven years, where they organized When the Stars Begin to Fall: Imagination and the American South and participated in the landmark “f show” contemporary art series.\n\nGoode Bryant photo: Oresti Tsonopoulos\n\nThomas (T.)

Arthur and Carol Kaufman Goldberg Curatorial Lectures bring curators of international stature to the Hunter campus to engage with students in the MA program in Art History and the MFA program in Studio Art, and with the broader Hunter community. Previous Goldberg Curators have included Ann Goldstein, Hamza Walker, Fabrice Stroun, Valerie Cassel Oliver, Omar Kholeif, Pablo Helguera, Lynne Cooke, and Koyo Kouoh.\n\nThe Department of Art and Art History mourns the loss of our friend and colleague, Bill Agee. Bill taught at Hunter for nearly a quarter-century, from 1990, when he was hired as a full professor in Modern American Art, until his retirement in 2014. He was named the Evelyn Kranes Kossak Chair in Art History in 2004.\n\nBy the time Bill came to Hunter he had already had at least two full careers. Just out of the program in Art History at Yale, he worked for the Smithsonian’s Archives of American Art, directing research on the New Deal and the arts. He joined the Whitney Museum of American Art as Associate Curator in 1966, where he organized one-person exhibitions of Donald Judd and Conrad Marca-Relli, and curated the lauded and controversial exhibition The 1930s: Painting and Sculpture in America. He served briefly as Associate Curator of Painting and Sculpture at the Museum of Modern Art before being appointed as Director of Exhibitions and Collections at the Pasadena Art Museum in1971. Just 34 at the time he elevated to the full directorship at Pasadena, he was one of the youngest museum leaders in the United States. After Pasadena, Bill would go on to serve as Director of the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, from 1974 to 1982.\n\nAfter stepping down from the MFA Houston, Bill worked as an independent curator, organizing monographic exhibitions and publishing on key figures of American Modernism, including Ralston Crawford, Stuart Davis, Arthur Dove, Sam Francis, Stanton Macdonald-Wright, Kenneth Noland, and Morgan Russell. He also turned his lens on less familiar artists. While at Hunter, Bill helped to organize two important traveling exhibitions of American art for the Addison Gallery at Phillips Academy in Andover, MA, where he had gone to high school and where he discovered his calling: Coming of Age: American Art, 1850s to 1950s (2006) and American Vanguards: Graham, Davis, Gorky, de Kooning, and Their Circle, 1927-1942 (2011). After he retirement, he published the survey Modern Art in America 1908-68 (2016), which the Wall Street Journal called “that rarity of rarities, an opinionated but not eccentric scholarly history by a veteran museum curator whose every page crackles with original thinking and bears the stamp of a preternaturally sharp eye.” ―The Wall Street Journal\n\nBill Agee brought that sharp eye and his original thinking to Hunter, and helped to shape the vision and careers of a generation of Hunter Art History students. His long curatorial experience and the insights he gained by working with closely with works of art fed his teaching, and his approach helped to center the idea of exhibition-making as a crucial aspect of art historical research. It is part of Bill’s legacy that curatorial practice remains integral to the teaching of Art History at Hunter. Among the exhibitions Bill realized here at Hunter with his students were Ray Parker: A Retrospective Exhibition (1990); Fairfield Porter: Paintings (1992); Paths of Abstraction: Painting in New York 1944-1981 (1994); and Tony Smith’s Tau (2004).\n\nHe will be missed."
