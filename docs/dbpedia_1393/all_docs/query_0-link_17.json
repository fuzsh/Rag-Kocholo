        "text": "The Minimalist works of Tony Smith and his peers urged a revolution within Post-War art. Smith's works acknowledged the Duchampian \"ready-made\" and the industrial production of early Constructivism. Smith's own breakthrough came, he says, while sitting in Eugene Goossen's office at Hunter College. \"I was sitting in a very low chair...and every time I looked up, I would see this 3 x 5 filing cabinet. And for some odd reason...some maniac had painted his black...I went home, thinking [sic] to go to sleep; but instead of that, all night all I could think of was that black box. Well, as the hours went by, things...disappeared...the line of the opening, the dovetailing of the joints, the hinges...and [it] simply became a black prism. It became a geometric object; it was no longer a filing cabinet\" (quoted in R. Storr, Tony Smith, Architect, Painter, Sculptor, New York, 1998, p. 25).
