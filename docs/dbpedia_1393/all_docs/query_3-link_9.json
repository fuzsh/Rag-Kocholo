        "text": "Background\n\nTony Smith mixed art and math; for him, it was the most natural thing in the world. Suffering from tuberculosis as a child, he spent hours by himself, making buildings and miniature cities from small medicine boxes. He put the boxes—cubes and other polyhedra—together in different ways for his creations. He later said, \"The most important fact of my life was that I had TB at a very early age.\"\n\nSmith became an architect and painter and even worked for Frank Lloyd Wright in the late 1930s. When a serious car accident laid him up, he returned to his childhood pastime of making sculpture from boxes. Focusing on the tetrahedron and the cube, he developed his geometric vocabulary in monumental sculptures that were first fabricated from plywood and covered with black automobile undercoating. While many works were produced in steel and placed outdoors in urban plazas, many Tony Smith-sculptures remained in their maquette or inexpensive plywood forms.\n\nArt critics have often included Tony Smith in a group of sculptors known as Minimalists, artists of the 1960s who used simple geometric forms and industrial materials to create large-scale works. Minimalist sculpture is often characterized as austere and unemotional. While Smith used geometric solids in his sculpture, Smith's work isn't stiff or static. In fact, when viewing Moondog from several angles, you can tell it doesn't stand perfectly upright, as you might expect when looking at it head-on. It actually leans, tilts, and twists. Scholars say this gives it both a human aspect and a spiritual side. This sense of movement differentiates his sculpture from the straight lines and grids of most Minimalist work. Smith wanted his work to be \"a conduit for spiritual things.\" He wrote: \"All of my sculpture is on the edge of dreams.\"\n\nHis sculpture can be hard to understand because he tried to mix anthropomorphism (human scale and characteristics) with geometric sculpture—this was his way of reaching from earth into the universe for spiritual meaning. Smith said this sculpture reminded him of a Japanese lantern and of the human pelvis, the bones that hold our spine and legs together. But he named it Moondog for two reasons: after a blind poet and musician called \"Moondog\" who hung out on the streets of New York where Smith lived, and after a painting by Spanish artist Joan Miró of a dog barking at the moon."
