        "text": "ONE of the great moments in the history of European railroads was the completion in 188O of the tunnel beneath the St. Gotthard Pass. Those who had tunneled from the north might not have met up in the middle with those who had tunneled from the south. But they did, just as planned, and you could almost have heard the cheering way up above on the mountain.\n\nIt wasn't quite the same when the polyglot workforce that has been readying the relocated New Museum at 583 Broadway finally completed its labors Wednesday evening. But as the reconstructed building stood finished and ready for visitors all the way through from Broadway to Mercer Street, those concerned were seen to jump for joy (within the limits of their athletic prowess).\n\nAnd the new New Museum is indeed a very pretty piece of property - a long narrow slice of archetypal SoHo real estate, complete with tall white columns (newly restored) and five times as much space as it had in its original quarters at 65 Fifth Avenue. It is to the credit of the developers of the Astor Building that they turned over three of its floors rent-free to the New Museum, and it is to the credit of Marcia Tucker and her colleagues that they have kept faith with a dream first made public in January 1977 and pursued with undaunted energy ever since.\n\nThe New Museum in SoHo opens to the public tomorrow. Its hours are Wednesdays 12 to 8 P.M., Thursdays and Fridays 12 to 6, Saturdays 10 A.M. to 6, and Sundays 12 to 5. It is closed Mondays and Tuesdays. The inaugural exhibition includes work by 68 of the more than 300 artists who have been shown by the New Museum since its inception. Grouped under the title ''Language, Drama, Source and Vision,'' the work reflects the preoccupations that the museum has espoused, fought for and presented in bulk.\n\nThough the installation was not complete at the time of this writing, it was already clear that in relation to the issues of the day, the New Museum takes, as ever, a combative stance. There are examples here and there of traditional high art, and very good they are, too (Brice Marden, Al Held, Elizabeth Murray and Dorothea Rockburne are among those responsible). But it would be pointless to pretend that they go to the mat with the darker problems of the day.\n\nThe modernist idiom as it was conceived of 15 or 20 years ago is, in fact, almost entirely absent from the show. It is primarily about discontent, about early warnings of disaster, about predicaments known to us but most often glossed over, and about the new means of communication that are becoming available all around us. Sometimes the matters in question are treated with wit and concision, as in Mark Tansey's ''Short History of Modernist Painting,'' which has the further distinction that it does not beat us over the head but allows us to draw our own conclusions. Elsewhere, the show comes back and back to something that Marcia Tucker says in her introduction to the catalogue: ''Language, in spoken and written form, is our principal tool for communication.'' What is written matters as much as what is painted, in other words, and what we see at the New Museum is often closer to the wall newspaper, or to the thinking man's graffitist, than to traditional museum material.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
