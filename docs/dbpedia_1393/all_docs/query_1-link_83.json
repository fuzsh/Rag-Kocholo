        "text": "Art conservation can be a rarefied field, but a new project being announced by the North American branch of the International Network for the Conservation of Contemporary Art is taking a decidedly populist approach.\n\nThe group, which promotes collaboration among professional conservators, artists and collectors, has started a program in which members of the public are being asked to help locate, document and photograph outdoor sculptures made by the Minimalist artist Tony Smith, who created more than 100 such pieces. While many of the sculptures are in public spaces and are well-known, there is no complete inventory of the sites or condition of outdoor works by Mr. Smith, who died in 1980. (Sept. 23 will be the 100th anniversary of his birth.)\n\nAnd so the conservation group is asking Smith fans to take their cameras and notebooks to “work together and complete the project by using two of the most-visited Web sites, Wikipedia and Flickr,” to “dramatically increase awareness about these works and therefore allow for the continued advocacy for their proper care and maintenance.” Information collected on the works will be organized and listed at the Wikipedia site WikiProject Public Art."
