        "text": "For centuries, artists have explored the relation between human and geometric proportions.\n\nSmith’s sculptures are non-figurative, but he was always thinking about the scale of the human body and the ways that people would interact with his geometric forms. This work is from a series of nine sculptures, each created for a friend of the artist and bearing that person’s initials. Although the pieces are inanimate, Smith called them “presences.”\n\nProvenanceThe artist; with Artist's Estate; with Paula Cooper Gallery, New York; to Pentti Kouri, New York; purchased by Jeffrey E. Horvitz, Beverly Farms, MA, at Sotheby's New York, May 4, 1993, Lot 154; to MFA, Boston, 1997"
