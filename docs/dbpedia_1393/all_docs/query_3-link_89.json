        "text": "In the story, James Hurst is foreshadowing the death of Doodle. Foreshadowing is when the author signals the reader about a future event. According to Hurst, “The last graveyard flowers were blooming, and their smell drifted across the cotton field and through every room of our house, speaking softly the names of our dead” (462). This quote describes graveyard flowers and we can infer that a person has died. While Brother is reflecting on how he treated Doodle, he realizes that his pride got the best of him and he feels regret and sorrow. Another quote that represents foreshadowing is when Aunt Nicey says, “Dead birds is bad luck” (Hurst 474). This quote shows that when the bird died, Doodle would die shortly after. The bird and Doodle had\n\nCoffin of Horankh is an example of a classical art and it was created around 700 B.C.E. In order to make this container different materials were used wood, gesso, paint, obsidian, calcite and bronze. The coffin is of three dimensions with 1m 94.95 cm in length, 45.72 cm in breadth and 41.91cm in height. As of now the Coffin of Horankh is located in 302 Egyptian Gallery of DMA.\n\nThe Gravestone of a Woman with her attendant is a sculpture created by an unknown artist and is now on display at the Getty Villa in Malibu, California. The sculpture is of a woman seated in a cushioned armchair, reaching out to lightly touch the top of a box or chest held by her attendant. We can tell from the sculpture that the women is of a higher class because of how her hair is done, the significant amount of jewelry, and the decorated throne that she lounges in. This sculpture is an extremely detailed Grecian gravestone made from a thick slab of colorless marble around 100 B.C.\n\nIn March 1906, Tennessee native Ed Johnson was sentenced to death for the rape of eighteen-year-old Nevada Taylor. Mr. Johnson supposedly choked the victim with a leather strap and subsequently sexually assaulted her. When testifying, the woman only had one adjective to describe the perpetrator, a word that damned the twenty-six-year-old to a guilty verdict; black. Although he had never been in possession of a leather strap, had a sound alibi verified by countless testimonies, and the rape victim never definitively identified Mr. Johnson during the trial, the all-white jury came to the conclusion that the African-American man was undeniably responsible for the cold-blooded atrocity. A day later, while sitting in his cell, a mob of white men dragged Ed Johnson out of the jailhouse, paraded him around the streets, and ultimately hanged the guiltless man at Walnut Street Bridge. The men then began to fire round after round at his lifeless body for the amusement of townsfolk who had gathered to watch the lynching, until, “one stray bullet severed the rope,” (Yellin 1). As the bloody corpse fell to the ground to the delight of the white children, “ one of the men put the barrel of his gun to Mr. Johnson 's head and fired five times,” (Yellin 1). The men faced no charges and nearly one hundred years later the Supreme Court found the viciously murdered man innocent. Unfortunately, when it comes to promoting justice for non-white Americans, the United States’ criminal justice system\n\nFarrin Davis has always been able to glimpse at the spiritual echoes left behind by the dead. It's the first thing he can clearly remember as a child. If someone was to ask him what his first memory is he wouldn't be able to tell them for it was the death of someone he shouldn't have known. He never told his parents for something had always warned him about telling them. He knew who, or what, but he never questioned it, knowing it was for the best even at such a young age.\n\nThe life story of Nick Morton isn't all that incredible, but thats why makes it incredible to Nick Morton himself. It’s the year 1999 in Milbank, South Dakota in a small hospital called Saint Bernard’s Hospital and a young father and mother have their first child together a boy named Nicholas. Then comes the early years growing up in Milbank for two years, and a little sister named Haley comes into the picture and Nick telling the doctor “You take her home I don't want her”. After two years of life in Milbank the family had to move to Sioux Falls, South Dakota because of the young sister who had multiple seizures and the doctors were more advanced.\n\nThe actions of World War I and the subsequent deaths due to Australia’s decision to support Britain proved significantly detrimental both on a small scale level and for the nation in general. On a small-scale level, all the men who did survive had to deal with the destructive, soul-crushing nature of war due to the coercion of enlistments around them from both Britain, the “Great Empire”, and the Australian government. These World War I subsequently had to live with watching their fellow mates die on the battlefield, killing people, the enemy who were just young men like them and as James Donaldson recounted that “they waved and the Turks waved back too” in the Armistice, and those soldiers, they were put in the worst of situations just because they thought it was for the good of the country, when the men, the young men who did survive, suffered with mental, physical and psychological impact,\n\nJohn Hardwig in Is There A Duty to Die? suggested there is a downside to medicine because it increases our life expectancy (Hardwig 35). What are we suppose to do with our lives, especially if we reach a point where we are incapacitated and miserable as our life progresses? In this paper I will argue that if I have a progressively increasing and incurable case of dementia and refuse to accept my duty to end my life, I forget my responsibility to my family and fail to see the importance of my own moral agent; this is because as a human, one of the most important obligations in life is maintain not only individual duty but also communal duty. I will begin my argument with a discussion of individual duty; here I will talk about how dementia will eventually lead to the deterioration of my mental capacities and explain why dignity lies within the last choice of my moral agent.\n\nIt is impossible to be inherently good or inherently evil, but people often perceive themselves in this manner. Until Samuel’s death, Tom Hamilton is the image of his father, striving to embody his good natured spirit by attempting to help anyone and everyone around him. When his sister Dessie grows sick, Tom attempts to help her with ill-received medicine that leads to her untimely death, leaving Tom devastated and wracked with guilt, blaming himself for her demise. Although most would not consider Tom to be bad, he chooses to believe that he is, damning himself after his good intentions had terrible consequences. Tom’s disconcerting struggle to reconcile his sense of morality with the severity of his actions reinforces Steinbeck’s argument\n\nWhat is worse the fear of the unknown, or the knowledge of everything that is about to happen, can it be possible to have both at the same time? In life everything should be questioned, even the basic facts that both humans and pictures should know. Yet it is hard for us to question what is undoubtedly fact, that is why when no one else will question the facts I must to make sure that everyone is relatively safe in our world of the living. By questioning the truth that is fed to us on silver spoons. Picking out what is safe and what is not, deciding if the pros are worth the cons.\n\nAn object placed on display behind a glass case inside a museum would hold a vastly different meaning if it were for sale by a street vendor, such as the individuals who set up their tables only a few feet away from the Met. Brent Plate in Religion, Art, and Visual Culture argues that “objects obtain different meanings in different locations and historical settings.” The different meanings that objects are able to obtain is attributed to the relationships that are established between the object itself and the environment that it is located in. These relationships often involve the kind of audience that a museum attracts, where the work is exhibited, and how the exhibit is laid out. Museums subsequently have the ability"
