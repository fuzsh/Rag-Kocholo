        "text": "Anthropologists assume art is a human universal, but have had to struggle with the cross-cultural identification of art, either by finding common forms and practices, e.g. painting, sculpture, dance, and so on, or by exploring the aesthetic locus in each cultural system. All humans enjoy aesthetic appreciation, but their visual, aural, tactile, olfactory and sensory preferences vary from place to place and over time. Anthropologists have examined the meaning of arts, in their psychological or psychoanalytic aspects and emotional power, or as semiotic media of communication like language and signaling systems, or by examining their sociopolitical agency in guiding human relationships. Arts like other local practices have experienced cross-cultural exchange, colonization and globalization. They have evolved both as symbols of specific ethnic identities, and as commercial and tourist arts. Crossing boundaries subjects arts to different audiences who make different interpretations, and meanings may be manipulated for power or commerce by mediators such as traders, anthropologists, and critics. As trade and travel erase barriers, artists of formerly separate peoples encounter metropolitan practices such as art school education, art galleries and museums, and the thriving and competitive mainstream art world. Many creatively enter that world while endeavouring to maintain ethnic distinctiveness, so that for instance, British, Inuit, Japanese, Spanish and Maori arts are circulated and exhibited by the same or similar institutions. The contemporary world of dissolving boundaries, often called postmodernity, has allowed many practices formerly segregated as crafts, often made by women, to enter these same circuits and institutions; metropolitan artists have appropriated features of non-Western arts as their own, as non-Western artists take up metropolitan practices. There is a convergence as artists now engage in ethnographic research, and anthropologists emphasize the poetic (rather than the analytical) power of their works. Art historians emphasize the personal and contextual in art production while anthropologists extend their gaze at the metropolitan and global art world.\n\nThis thesis surveys in a strictly chronological fashion discourses that were critical to promoting changes in the understanding of Arnhem Land bark painting from 1850 to 1990. The thesis is based on extensive surveys of the record in relation to early historical accounts, reports, press clippings and catalogues of exhibitions of Aboriginal art and bark painting in particular. While this study does not depart from existing perspectives on the reception of Aboriginal art, such as those of Jones, Lowish, Morphy and Taylor, it presents a more nuanced account and its specific focus is the reception of Arnhem Land bark painting. Its chronological period is 140 years and it includes new data from the press. It elaborates more fully on the reception of Aboriginal art in the gallery. It considers 177 press commentaries (from 1853-1990), many of which have not, to my knowledge, been hitherto noted, and creates broader contexts by means of the chronological documentation and analysis of the commentaries detailed in 62 key exhibition catalogues of Aboriginal art. As well, - 17 local and international professionals in the fields of anthropology, art and business who have played critical roles in the development of the understandings for Aboriginal art and Arnhem Land bark painting since the 1960s have been interviewed. An underlying aim of the thesis has been to document the shifts in perception that occurred in regards to emerging understandings in the historical records of the sophistication of Aboriginal people and their art; importantly, it aims to identify how and when these first happened and what the mechanisms were that allowed this to become widely understood by mainstream audiences. It therefore tracks accounts of the earliest periods of contact, noting evidence of these initial perceptions and the changes that followed.\n\nAnthropology’s engagement with art has a complex and uneven history. While material culture, ‘decorative art’, and art styles were of major significance for founding figures such as Alfred Haddon and Franz Boas, art became marginal as the discipline turned towards social analysis in the 1920s. This book addresses a major moment of renewal in the anthropology of art in the 1960s and 1970s. British anthropologist Anthony Forge (1929-1991), trained in Cambridge, undertook fieldwork among the Abelam of Papua New Guinea in the late 1950s and 1960s, and wrote influentially, especially about issues of style and meaning in art. His powerful, question-raising arguments addressed basic issues, asking why so much art was produced in some regions, and why was it so socially important? Fifty years later, art has renewed global significance, and anthropologists are again considering both its local expressions among Indigenous peoples and its new global circulation. In this context, Forge’s arguments have renewed relevance: they help scholars and students understand the genealogies of current debates, and remind us of fundamental questions that remain unanswered. This volume brings together Forge’s most important writings on the anthropology of art, published over a thirty year period, together with six assessments of his legacy, including extended reappraisals of Sepik ethnography, by distinguished anthropologists from Australia, Germany, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. Anthony Forge was born in London in 1929. A student at Downing College, Cambridge, he studied anthropology with Edmund Leach, and went on to undertake research with Raymond Firth at the London School of Economics. Over 1958-63 he undertook several periods of fieldwork among the Abelam of the Sepik region of Papua New Guinea, made major collections for the Museum der Kulturen, Basel, and went on to write a series of essays which were enormously influential for the anthropology of art and for studies of Melanesia. He was appointed Foundation Professor of Anthropology at the Australian National University in 1974 and taught there until his death in 1991.\n\nWestern art history has developed with two complementary sides: a history of art objects in their own right and art as a source of information about people's lives and worlds — artworks as sources of historical information. 1 The former history is linked to the value creation processes that elevate certain objects to the category of fine art, evaluate them according to qualitative criteria and provide the basis for connoisseurship. The latter can leave the object, and the art in the object, far behind, focussing on its evidential value or even morphing into social theory. Until recently these differences in approaches to art objects have been associated with an opposition between two kinds of institutions — art galleries (or art museums in the USA) on the one hand and museums (of ethnography or social history) on the other. The distinction between the art gallery and the museum can be simplistically summarised as a difference of emphasis between appreciating and 'knowing about' the work of art. But it has also been associated with the very definition of things as fine art or non fine art. To simplify things significantly, art galleries have been associated with connoisseurship and have developed as privileged venues for viewing fine art and the appreciation of objects on the basis of their form. Museums have provided less privileged and more crowded viewing places for material culture including ethnography, and have tended to emphasise an interpretative perspective that places the object in its social and cultural context. The value creation processes involved in the creation of fine art have affected art historians, anthropologists and archaeologists in different ways. They have all had to engage with the process of classification that has divided their data into different sets collected by different institutions on the basis of whether it is or is not held to be fine art. Fine art in this sense is a western category of relatively recent origins that until recently was largely centred on the history of western art. 2 Other works were included within the category of fine art on the basis of their relationship with western art history. Art historians as a profession, because of their focus on western fine art, had a closer association with art galleries than social history or ethnography museums, but were none the less often constrained by its definitions and connoisseurial requirements. Anthropologists and archaeologists of art found that the majority of the works they were interested in were excluded from the art"
