        "text": "FEATURED ARTISTS\n\n​FEATURED ARTIST OF THE MONTH\n\nAre you an artist looking for a way to share your creative vision with the world? If so, you might be interested in becoming an MAA Featured Artist of the Month. This is a unique opportunity to showcase your artwork in the Gallery's front window, where it will catch the eye of mall visitors. You can display up to 12 pieces of art, depending on their size, for a whole month. Your photo and bio can be displayed next to your work, so people can learn more about you and your artistic style. All you have to do is apply and, if selected, deliver your art to the Gallery on the scheduled date. If you want to sell your artwork, include a price list as well. The Exhibit Committee will handle the rest, including setting up your exhibit and promoting it on the MAA website, social media pages, and a local newspaper article. Please note that we reserve the right to reject any artwork that does not meet our quality standards. For more information, contact Julie Sexstone at [email protected].\n\nCHIP WINTERS\n\nBorn 1965, my life has been full of artistic explorations and self-expression. Growing up in Buckhannon, WV, I was immersed in a world of creativity, thanks to my mother’s passion for the arts.\n\nMy journey as an artist has been diverse and fulfilling. While I have made a living as a cosmetologist for many years, helping people look and feel their best, my true passion lies in the visual arts. From painting to photography, I’ve found solace and joy in capturing the beauty of the world around me and expressing my innermost thoughts and emotions on canvas.\n\nAs a proud member of the LBGTQ+ community, I’ve used my art as a form of advocacy and self-expression. While my creative pursuits have taken many forms, including painting and photography and even foam wig making, one of the most fulfilling aspects of my journey has been creating art that celebrates love, acceptance and diversity.\n\nMy husband, Chad, and our two daughters have been steadfast supporters throughout my artistic journey. Their love and encouragement inspire me to continue pushing the boundaries of my creativity and exploring new avenues of self-expression.\n\nBeing selected as June’s Featured Artist of the Month is a tremendous honor. It’s a validation of the time and effort I’ve dedicated to my craft, and its opportunity to share my art with a wider audience. I hope my work resonates with others and inspires them to embrace their own creative passions.\n\nLooking ahead, I’m excited to continue my artistic exploration, fueled by love of my family and endless possibilities of self-expression. Whether I’m painting in my home or capturing fleeting moments with my camera, I’m grateful for the opportunity to share my love of art with the world.\n\nEARL STRAIGHT\n\nCyfarchion! (Greetings)\n\nTwo of my great loves or passions are traveling, especially internationally, and photojournalism. I enjoy visually capturing a moment and telling a story that I can share with others. Some friends and family tell me that they get the chance to travel through my pictures; an awesome responsibility.\n\nAs a youngster growing up in North Central West Virginia, I dreamed of someday traveling this amazing planet. Through the print media and television, I was visually able to explore and dream beyond the hills of West Virginia. A major goal during high school and college was to someday experience some of my visions first hand and to explore and experience other cultures and to meet people. It was now my turn to create those visual images for others to experience.\n\nWhile in high school, the photography “bug” started when my parents gifted me a Kodak Brownie Starflash Outfit (which I still have) and while working on my Boy Scout merit badge in photography. That interest continued to grow while majoring in English and journalism in undergraduate school. The importance of composition and storytelling began with my first photojournalism class. Telling stories visually!\n\nIn graduate school, the late Bill Seymour, WVU journalism professor and photojournalist, really began pushing and challenging me as a photographer/photojournalist. Truly, my first mentor and later, good friend. He also loved working with my high school students in the classroom and the darkroom.\n\nIt was now my turn to push and challenge. Vividly, I remember telling my journalism students not to lock themselves into a set, narrow life. They had a vast world to explore. The major yearning for me to explore was still there. So, I began practicing what I had preached by taking trips during spring breaks and over summers, mostly to Eastern and Western Europe. Some of these trips included my students. After 36 years of teaching mostly journalism, English, and advising student publications at Morgantown High School, I retired to devote more time to exploring my storytelling (visions) and to continue to push and challenge my comfort zones.\n\nI am blessed to have been able to visit and explore 30 countries with my camera in hand and to take 20 Road Scholar trips, some involving photography. For the first time, it gave me an amazing adventure to explore my father’s very early ancestral home of Wales. Give me trains, water, AND mountains to explore and I am very happy! Just a note, some family came to Bristol, England to America as captains to fight in King William’s War (1689-1697) and stayed. Back to my adventures, six of those were in various regions of England, Wales, Spain and Italy with Italian photojournalist, Alfio Garozzo and English/Welsh photographer Jan Chipps. I owe so much to them for pushing me further especially in the area of digital landscape photography. I have grown so much because of their encouragement and guidance.\n\nYes, even though some of that feeling to explore has been filled, I know my camera and I still have more exploring to do and some new friendships to make.\n\nMmynhau! (Enjoy)\n\nBRENDA TRADER ZIEHM\n\nBrenda Trader Ziehm was born and raised in Morgantown, WV. Her father, R. Frank Trader, was a coal miner employed at the Pursglove 15 mine in the early 1950s. Her mother, Betty Layman Trader, was a stay-at-home mom until she accepted a position with Mylan Pharmaceuticals. Brenda had an idyllic childhood attending local schools. She is a graduate of University High School. Go Hilltoppers!\n\nAs a young adult, Brenda attended college in the Washington, D.C. area where she met a young navy man, Jay Ziehm, who became and still is the love of her life. Jay and Brenda will celebrate 54 years of marriage on 2024. Brenda, when she wasn’t watching The Rifleman with her trusty Winchester 92 carbine, enjoyed drawing and many other forms of artistic expression.\n\nBrenda has explored ceramics, chalk art, calligraphy, flower arrangements, and other crafts. However, her three favorite forms that take up much of her time are photography, quilting and watercolor painting. The watercolor landscapes created by Brenda will transport you to the beach, an African safari, or a forest glen. Her still-life paintings make you believe that you can pluck a beautiful flower from the page or reach down and pet a silky, rambunctious puppy. Brenda delights in sharing her artwork with friends and family. Each piece is gladly received and proudly shown to everyone that enters the house.\n\nBrenda invites you to view and enjoy her artwork at the Morgantown Art Association Gallery in Morgantown, WV during the month of February.\n\n​\n\nSUSAN KELLY MARCH\n\nSusan is a Morgantown native. She attended West Virginia University earning a BFA in Graphic Design in 1977 and a MA in Counseling in 1997. She worked as graphic designer at WVU for 30 years and retired in 2014. Susan began watercolor painting and became a member of Morgantown Art Association in 2016.\n\n​“My mother, Doris Kelly, was a founding member of the Morgantown Art Association (MAA) and an active artist until she passed in 2013. My plan was to have her teach me to paint when I retired. The timing wasn’t to be. But I inherited all of her art materials, including a palette full of watercolor paint. With MAA Instructor Susan Witt’s guidance, I have discovered the magic of watercolor. It gives me great joy to use my Mother’s paints with a few new “quacky” colors added to the palette.”\n\n​\n\nALAN SEXSTONE\n\nText – 304-692-1603\n\nEmail – [email protected]\n\nI was born in 1951 in London, England then emigrated to the USA in 1957. There my family became naturalized citizens in 1967. I grew up and attended college in Louisville, Kentucky attaining a MS degree in Biology from the University of Louisville. In 1978 I married Julie Stearns before we moved to Lansing, Michigan, where I received a PhD in Microbiology in 1983. We then moved to Morgantown, WV where I worked as an environmental microbiologist at West Virginia University, retiring as a professor in 2015. Julie and I have two adult sons who now have thriving families of their own.\n\nI have always loved three dimensional forms and was fascinated by wood grain and texture. Upon retirement I decided to take up wood turning to explore this fascination. I bought an old lathe off Craig’s List and tried to teach myself, which didn’t work out that well!! So, I sought out classes from professionals to master correct techniques and learned what I know from the following people: bowl and spindle turning from Ashley Harwood, segmented bowl turning from Jeremy Bartholow, box turning from Jason Breach, power carving from Kristen LaVier, and multi-axis turning from Derek Weidman. In a future class I hope to learn how to turn hollow forms. I am a member of the American Association of Woodturners, whose members are friendly, inspirational, and generous with their advice.\n\nWood turning is my primary artistic hobby. I have progressed to the point where I am finally comfortable to offer my work for sale to others. I do not yet have a web presence, but many of my past works can be viewed on my Instagram account (alansexstone). Some of my pieces are for sale at the Morgantown Art Association Gallery. If interested, you may contact me by email or text, as listed above.\n\n​\n\nDAN FRIEND\n\n​[email protected]\n\nAlthough my love for photography started many years ago when I saw that B&W print come to life in the developer tray under an amber safe-light, digital photography and Photoshop renewed an old love affair for me. I have retired from working as a full time photographer for a University and today I have a small photo company that I license images for all manner of commercial and editorial use and sell fine art prints.\n\nWork background: Operated my own Photographic Studio 15 years doing portraits and wedding. Then worked as Photographer at West Virginia University for 30 years retiring as manager of WVU Photographic Services. Since retiring I operate DLF Photo, licensing images for all manner of commercial and editorial use and sell fine art prints.\n\nTONY KLEB\n\nI grew up in New Jersey spending a lot of my time in the woods, on the lakes, and at the ocean. I\n\nhad taken art classes in high school and enjoyed them, but quickly lost interest once I got my\n\nfirst car. I have been fishing since I was five, and that interest has carried through even\n\nthrough today. I started fly fishing and tying flies after graduating from college. I moved to\n\nWest Virginia in 1978 following a sales career as a SALESPERSON selling paper and packaging\n\nsupplies, retiring from International Paper in 2018. My wife and I now spend our time with the\n\ngrandchildren, gardening, and when we can, camping across the U.S. with our dog, Buster, fly\n\nfishing, hiking and more fly fishing. Post Covid I joined Morgantown Art Association and rekindled\n\nmy enjoyment of creating art both with water colors and colored pencil. One of the\n\nhighlights of my week is attending Monday class with Susan Witt along with many friends I’ve\n\nmade in class.\n\nLISA RYAN\n\nLisa Faye (Rockwell) Ryan, the Featured Artist for January 2023, started drawing and painting\n\nwhile growing up in Staunton, Virginia. She was mentored in oil painting by her grandmother,\n\nDorothy Hughes, when she visited her Farmington, West Virginia home during the summers. She\n\ntook drawing and oil painting classes while attending the University of Virginia, where she\n\nmajored in English Language and Literature. She earned a Master of Arts degree in Writing and\n\nPublishing from Emerson College in Boston, where she honed her fiction writing and\n\nscreenwriting skills. After earning a Master of Science in Library Science degree from the\n\nUniversity of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, she worked as an Information Specialist and\n\nIndex/Abstracter. She founded and developed the business, Stellar Searches LLC, for which she\n\nconducts searching and indexing. After moving with her husband, Stephen, to Mount Sterling,\n\nKentucky in 2006, she took watercolor classes at the Gateway Regional Arts Center there. For\n\nWoman’s History Month in March 2020, she exhibited oil paintings done by herself and her\n\ngrandmother of the same landscape subject at the Gateway Regional Arts Center. In the\n\nsummer of 2021, she and her husband moved to her Dad’s childhood home in Enterprise, West\n\nVirginia to be closer to family. She soon joined the Morgantown Art Association, where she has\n\nbeen taking watercolor classes and workshops and exhibiting her work.\n\n​\n\nNANCY MAUNZ\n\nNancy Manuz is a native of West Virginia. Her parents were born and raised high in the mountains.\n\nShe spent many hours in the Swiss village of Helvetia, roaming the hills, meadows and creek on\n\nher grandparents’ farm, which later became her father’s hobby farm. There is where she began\n\nher love affair with nature.\n\nNancy attended Fairmont State University, where she was awarded a scholarship to study art\n\nand earned the title Art Student of the Year. She also earned graduate hours in art from\n\nWest Virginia University. Nancy taught art in West Virginia public and private schools for over\n\n30 years. The longest stint was at University High School in Morgantown.\n\nShe has attended numerous lectures, classes and workshops, where she studied with regional\n\nand nationally known artists. She has exhibited in cafes and galleries throughout her career.\n\nPresently, she is active in The Thread art group, Morgantown Art Association, the Artists of\n\nWaldomore, and the Arts Center in Elkins, WV. She is president-elect of the West Virginia\n\nWatercolor Society.\n\n​\n\nNancy primarily works in watercolor, but can be found on a bench in the park drawing. Her\n\npreferred subject matter is nature.\n\nShe says, “To this day, after a walk, my pockets bulge with pinecones, seed pods, flower heads\n\nand sometimes a feather or two. I love to lay them out and draw or paint these fragments\n\n​from nature.”\n\n​\n\nJUDY HURST AND SUE HATFIELD\n\n​\n\nOLGA ALEXANDRIA GAUJOT\n\nI grew up thousands of miles away from the nearest large body of water, in Donetsk, Ukraine,\n\nbut I have always been drawn to the sea, salt, sand, and sun. In the1980s Ukraine was a part of\n\nthe Soviet Union and for vacations my parents (Lybov and Valeri) would often take my brother\n\n(Mikhail) and I on to the Azov Sea and Black Sea, Ukraine. On these brief summer trips my\n\npassion for seascapes first washed ashore. The images of the sky meeting the water, and then\n\nwater meeting the land made me feel more connected to the world beyond my home. It was\n\nwhen I moved to the United Stated in 1996 and visited the ocean for the first time that I\n\nwitnessed the magnificence of the ocean scapes.\n\nWest Virginia became my home in 2003. I fell in love with the people, rivers and the mountains.\n\nThere are similarities between the Donetsk Province and West Virginia, both located on the 38th\n\nParallel, both regions are known for coal, and both have been in the middle of a Civil War.\n\nWhen incorporate images of West Virginia into my art I feel more connected to home in Ukraine. I\n\nhave two amazing daughters Katya (18) and Maya (14) who was born and raised in WV. They are\n\nalways inspire my creativity and push me to do better in my life.\n\nMy passion for art and teaching grew drastically in 2020 during my dramatic battle with\n\nbreast cancer. Art became my therapy. I truly feel beauty is all around us, in the faces of\n\nstrangers, architecture, and even the ordinary nature. My observational drawings, sketches\n\nand still lives are rooted in the Traditional Russian techniques that I learned at the Donetsk\n\nArts College. My teaching methods are based on the similar classes I attended in my home\n\ncountry. I work with young students because their potential is limitless. Every day I strive to\n\ngrow as an artist, by engaging in drawing, painting and sketching. Every day I strive to grow as a\n\nhuman, by connecting with others to build a community. I believe that Art and Music will save\n\nthe world. My partner Aristotle Jones and I started the Sounds Good Foundation which\n\nDEdicated to art and music and serving underprivileged communities in West Virginia. I became\n\na member of Morgantown Art Association in 2021 and board member of Monongalia Art Center in\n\n​2022.\n\nServing the community became my lifelong interest and priority.\n\n​\n\n​\n\nBARBARA BEER\n\nSTEVE HEAP\n\nI’m Steve Heap, and I live to create images that will bring back memories of a happy\n\nvacation or remind you of a place you used to call home!\n\nMy aim is to capture each location I visit in the best light and create a photograph,\n\nthat you would be truly proud to display in your home or office.\n\nAs a professional photographer, I have been very active in the stock photography\n\nworld with images printed in leading magazines, travel guides and international\n\npublications. More recently, though, I have been more focused on the elusive task of\n\ngetting the perfect image of places I visit – ones that really speak to the viewer, and\n\nI have been writing stories about the background to my photos on my website:\n\nBackyardImage.com\n\nMy portfolio can be seen at: SteveHeap.com, and it is organized by location, so that\n\n​you quickly find the print you are looking for.\n\nTIA HUNT\n\nReedsville, WV\n\nHorses…drawing…dislike of “Paint by Number” kits. Originally from Kelso,\n\nWashington I loved drawing, had my own horse by age 7, well, I shared a horse\n\nwith my younger sister and having received my “Paint-by-Number” paint kit (of\n\na horse), decided that was not for me. The paints came out, and I painted my\n\nown pictures. My father gave me my first Grumbacher oil paint set for\n\nChristmas when I was seventeen, and my husband gave me my first paint box\n\nand easel.\n\nIn Huntington Junior High School my art teacher entered my pen and ink\n\ndrawing of horses in a school art show. During 4-H my various projects\n\ninclude horses, photography, cooking (where I learned cake decorating),\n\nsewing and Junior Leadership. I had the privilege to attend various workshops\n\nin Temecula, California instructed by William F. Powell, author of many Foster\n\nart books and originally from Huntington. WV. Prior to moving to West Virginia,\n\nI attended San Jacinto Community College and studied painting under John\n\nDingler learning techniques of masters, one of whom was Caravaggio. I had the\n\nprivilege of viewing works by Caravaggio in Vienna, Austria.\n\nRICH LEWIS\n\nI am 66 years old and retired from the U.S. Air Force and moved to Morgantown\n\nin 1997, after spending 20 years as a missile systems analyst.\n\nMy wife, Sandy, and I opened Country Lane Photography in January of 1998,\n\noffering family, children and high school senior portraits. Sandy is an autism\n\nspecialist for the county school system, and we have two children, Kelly and\n\nMatt, and six grandchildren. Kelly is a behavior counselor for the Hanover, PA\n\nschool district, and Matt is serving in the Air Force and currently stationed in\n\nAlaska.\n\nI have too many hobbies, including photography (obviously) woodworking, metal\n\ndetecting, fishing and kayaking, and I hope to do more landscape and wildlife\n\n​photography in the future.\n\nJOSEPH BORYTSKY\n\nI studied with the University of Edinburgh art professor while stationed at Kirknewton\n\nRAF Station, Scotland. After serving with the United States Air Force, I designed and\n\nexecuted visual merchandising with Kaufman’s Department Store in Uniontown,\n\nPennsylvania, Steubenville, Caton, and Mansfield, Ohio. I returned to Kaufman’s became\n\nmerchandising buyer.\n\nMy art background over the years consists of oils, watercolors, pastels, and\n\ncalligraphy. For the past fifteen or so years I have concentrated on my ethnic\n\nbackground and found new interest in traditional and colorful Polish art. Many\n\nimmigrants brought many of their Polish customs and artistic talents with them to\n\nAmerica. Over the years many of these treasured pieces of Szopki (shop0key),\n\nWycinang (vee-chee-non-kee), paper cuts and wax drop and pull Pysanki (pee-son0kee)\n\ndecorated eggs have disappeared or have been discarded by family members\n\nunfamiliar with these traditional arts. My goal as an artist is to create, revitalize,\n\n​and preserve these almost forgotten art forms.\n\n​My work has been exhibited in the following areas where Polish art still thrives:\n\nThe Cathedral of Learning - Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania\n\nThe Cloister of the Frick Fine Arts Building - Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania\n\nAndy Warhol Museum - Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania\n\nNational Czech and Slovak Museum - Cedar Rapids, Iowa\n\nThe Pope John Paul II Cultural Center - Washington, D.C.\n\nStudent Union Building, University of Pittsburgh - Oakland Campus\n\nGREG KULLMAN\n\n​\n\nGRACE WIGAL\n\nGrace Wigal has spent most of her life teaching, first as a reading specialist in\n\nan elementary school, next as a language arts teacher and reading specialist at\n\nthe high school level, and last as a teaching professor at the West Virginia\n\nCollege of Law, where she directed the Legal Reasoning, Research, and Writing\n\nProgram and the Academic Excellence Program. She retired in 2015 to focus on\n\nher family beef farm on Cobun Creek Road and to spend more time with her\n\ngrandchildren.\n\nRecently, the farming operation expanded to include a high tunnel greenhouse\n\nthat supplies vegetables to family, friends, and a community feeding program.\n\nGrace also sings with the West Virginia University Community Choir and enjoys\n\nparticipation in the Osher Lifelong Learning Institute’s classes where she has\n\ndiscovered a new hobby – painting with watercolors.\n\nAlthough Grace has spent most of her life close to the earth with her farming\n\nand gardening activities, she says that her watercolors class has taught her to\n\nsee the world through a new lens of proportion and color that has enriched her\n\n​life with new meaning.\n\n​\n\nCHARLOTTE SWISHER\n\n​\n\nFRED STANSBERRY\n\n​\n\nP.J. Bell\n\nI have lived my life in WV. My family came to Morgantown in 1962. I went to\n\npublic school here and attended WVU for a B.S. degree in Elementary Education.\n\nI began teaching in Arthurdale in Preston County and then in Flatts-Chestnut\n\nRidge, North Elementary, and finally at Suncrest Middle in Monongalia County. I\n\nearned my M.A. degree in education. I taught grades 4, 5 and 6 for a period of 41\n\nyears.\n\nI have always been interested in art. I have taken classes in tole-oil painting and\n\nsketching. Through OLLI, I started taking watercolor classes from Susan Witt\n\nand have enjoyed it; though it is a challenge! This started my involvement with\n\nthe Morgantown Art Association. I currently chair publicity and the website for\n\nMAA.\n\nThe friendly atmosphere in The Gallery contributes to learning not only from our\n\ninstructors, but also from each other. For me painting is a stress reliever. When I\n\nhave a brush in my hand, I seem to go into a “zone”. Time stands still, and I am\n\n​often oblivious to what’s going on around me.\n\nTHE SCHUBERTS​\n\nDr. Karel R. Schubert: Karel Schubert grew up in West Virginia. He has always\n\nbeen interested in art, architecture and anthropology. He has lived in exciting\n\nplaces around the world.

Among her awards, she has won Best of Show at the Taylor County\n\nPhotography Show.\n\nEDDIE “SPAGHETTI” MAIER\n\nwww.eddiespaghettiart.com\n\n​\n\nEddie Spaghetti Maier uses his creative talents to share Mother Nature’s\n\nbountiful gifts of beauty. While he predominately works as a printmaker, he is\n\nalso adept in other mediums including pottery, batik, mural painting, and just\n\nabout anything art related. Eddie also loves to share his talents by teaching and\n\nholding workshops.\n\nHe has a reverence for nature and love of the outdoors. His activities include\n\ncanoeing, camping, hiking and travel, primarily the Appalachian Mountains of\n\nWest Virginia where he calls Morgantown, WV his home.\n\nEddie feels blessed and grateful for his artistic talents, but his success has come\n\nfrom years of hard work and dedication. He grew up feeling most connected with\n\nclay and making pottery on the wheel. After learning woodcut printmaking while\n\non a study abroad in Australia, he found his calling. Even after 20 years of\n\nmaking woodcuts, he still says, “I can’t stop carving. I’ve become obsessed with\n\nthe process. I love printmaking.” …and his passion shows in his work.\n\nHis decision to make art becoming his livelihood is worth mentioning. After the\n\ndeath of his brother, Erich, he realized the sacred meaning of life is to live it. He\n\nfelt it was time to pursue his passion. Kathy Martinez, an artist friend from\n\nJohnstown, PA, turned Eddie onto selling his art at music festivals and arts and\n\ncrafts fairs. He can often be found traveling with his family to places all over the\n\nU.S.A. His wife, Talia, and children, Zealon and Zuri, also make art to be shared\n\nand sold, while they are on the road together. He boasts, “I love seeing places\n\nacross our country. We’ve got brothers and sisters all over. That’s what makes\n\n​an artist’s life so special.”\n\n​ ALLYSON MCKEE\n\nAllyson McKee is a Pasadena, Maryland girl who attended West Virginia\n\nUniversity where she majored in zoology. She met and married a West Virginia\n\nyoung man, Clark, who was from Triadelphia, WV. After several years in\n\nVirginia, while Clark served in the military, they returned to Morgantown\n\nintending to stay 2 years and now 50 years later, they are still here. Along\n\nthe way they raised two children, Lisa and Sean. There are also two\n\ngrandsons and a granddaughter to round out the McKee clan.\n\nAllyson worked for West Virginia University Libraries after receiving her\n\nMaster’s in Library Science from the University of Pittsburgh. She served as\n\nthe Department Head of Electronic Resources, Licensing and Acquisitions for\n\nthe Libraries. Upon retirement from WVU Libraries after 43 years, she\n\nneeded a project and a new challenge. She started attending Susan Witt’s\n\nwatercolor classes.\n\nTOM HARMAN\n\nTom Harman MD is a retired OB/Gyn who creates beautiful useful ceramic objects.\n\nFor over thirty years he delivered babies and helped women with reproductive health\n\nproblems in Morgantown WV, but he’s not the typical surgeon.\n\nTom grew up in northern Ohio in a small manufacturing town. He excelled in school,\n\nbut was a mischievous youngster, frequently in trouble with teachers and parents.\n\nThe youngest of three boys,\n\nhe loved fishing, music and playing cards. As a tuba major at OSU, he was the first in\n\nhis extended family to attend college, but that didn’t last long. Deeply religious and\n\npatriotic, he was shocked into political activism by the Vietnam War and took to the\n\nstreets to protest his country’s aggression. To his conservative family’s horror, he\n\ndropped out of college and began working with the American Friends Service\n\nCommittee as an anti-war draft counselor. Prepared to go to prison for his beliefs\n\nhe even destroyed his own draft card, but he didn’t burn it. He ate it!\n\nIt was during this time that he became part of an organization called Peacemakers\n\nand it was through this group that he met his wife of 45 years, nurse-midwife and\n\nauthor, Patricia Harman. In 1974, Tom and Patsy, as part of a community of\n\npeacemakers, helped established a rural commune in Spencer WV. There, they\n\nattempted to live a simple, self-sufficient non-violent life, devoted to the principals\n\nof Mahatma Gandhi. As the War in Vietnam wound down, most of the members of the\n\ncommune returned to college and moved away. Tom and Patsy, now parents of three\n\nof their own boys, still felt called to do something to make the world better. They\n\nhad already had two babies at home with midwives and eventually decided to devote\n\ntheir lives to the medical field, helping families have gentle respectful births in the\n\nhospital. It was during medical school at Ohio State University, that Tom discovered he\n\nhad a gift for surgery and developed an interest in women’s pelvic pain. This later\n\nbecame his specialty and he worked with Patsy at WVU medical center and later in his\n\nown private practice, Partners in Women’s Healthcare at Mon General Hospital.\n\nDuring this time, he began to take classes in ceramics and developed his own home\n\nstudio. In 2018, when he retired, he began to sell and show his own work. In addition to\n\nmaking beautiful useful, cups, platters, bowls and vases, he enjoys growing micro-\n\ngreens under grow lights in his basement and tending his large vegetable garden. He\n\nswims daily in the lake near his home and travels to the Dominican Republic to do\n\n​surgical service missions.\n\n​\n\n​HOLLY NICHOLSON\n\nI worked as a school counselor for 27 years, and I loved working with\n\nchildren and their imaginations. I think this was where I used my creativity the\n\nmost in teaching and creating games to help students share their feelings.\n\nAfter I retired, I worked as a realtor for a few years until I felt I could\n\n“really retire” and create a life full of art and nature.\n\nI started mosaic classes with Debbie Palmer at the Senior Citizens Center in\n\nWiles Hill. She taught me a great deal, and I started working on projects at\n\nhome. I was also experimenting with alcohol inks at the time and found them\n\nfun to play with.\n\nI began Susan Witt’s watercolor classes about three years ago and loved\n\nevery class! She teaches from her many years of experience and gives you\n\nloads of tips to make it seem easy. She is a positive encouraging teacher. I\n\nwas only able to go to summer classes, as I go away in the winter, but each\n\nclass taught me so much!\n\nI always thought watercolor was the hardest medium to master, but if you “go\n\nwith the flow”, it can be a wonderful way to create beauty.\n\n​\n\nSUSAN DOTSON\n\nHaving been born and raised in Murrysville, PA, I left the Keystone State to attend\n\nWest Virginia Wesleyan College, coming to realize that you are either born a\n\nMountaineer, or you get here as soon as you can. After graduation, my husband, Lyn,\n\nand I spent a year living in Washington, DC, before returning to West Virginia and\n\nMorgantown where he attended law school and I pursued a master’s degree in\n\njournalism. Although we had planned to leave Morgantown when we graduated, we\n\nfound jobs here and stayed. Eventually we realized it was home and we’ve lived here\n\never since.\n\nOur children, Meredith and Ben, were born in Morgantown and both attended WVU. Now\n\nMeredith lives in Avon, OH, outside Cleveland, with her husband Cole; Ben and his wife,\n\nKelly, live in Houston, TX. I spent my career in human resources, working for several\n\nlarge corporations including Consol and Northrup Grumman. In 2015 I retired from\n\nMylan where I has managed employee leave.\n\nI taught myself to knit when I was about 12 and have dabbled in lots of crafts since\n\nthen. I’ve done tole painting with acrylics, knitting, counted cross stitch, and\n\nscrapbooking. After my retirement, I began to work in watercolors, which I have\n\nfound to be very challenging, but also rewarding. I joined the Morgantown Art\n\nAssociation and have enjoyed the friends I have made through the group. Besides Susan\n\nWitt’s watercolor classes, I’ve participated in workshops with Sterling Edwards, Lynn\n\nLysick and with various instructors at the WV Botanic Garden.\n\nBesides painting, I enjoy gardening and reading. I’m involved with my church, Suncrest\n\n​UMC, and currently serve as president of the Service League of Morgantown.\n\nAVA GAA-OJEDA KESSLER\n\nAva Gaa-Ojeda Kessler attended the University of Puerto Rico, Rio Piedras Campus, where she earned\n\na B.S. (1978) and M.S. (1983) in biology on the reproductive biology, ecology, behavior, and feeding\n\nhabits of Sphaerodactylus townsendi and S. macrolepis lizards. Afterward, she did further studies in\n\nbiology at the City University of New York and Museum of Natural History. She previously worked\n\nfor the Puerto Rico Department of Natural Resources and the Environment, Terrestrial Ecology\n\nSection, as a Field Biologist and studied the status of the endangered Culebra Island Giant Anole lizard\n\n(Anolis roosevelti). Later, she was cross-trained in human in vitro fertilization/embryo transfer at\n\nthe infertility laboratories of Rush University Medical Center in Chicago. She subsequently returned\n\nto Puerto Rico where she worked as a human embryologist and andrologist, helping to produce the\n\nfirst set of IVF/ET twins in Puerto Rico. Ava last worked for the Albemarle County Public School\n\nsystem as a substitute teacher and also periodically delivered outreach educational programs on\n\nherpetofauna and other areas of science to school children. After rearing two sons with her\n\nhusband, Matt, a veterinarian, she discovered a passion for watercolor painting while attending an art\n\nclass through West Virginia University’s Osher Lifelong Learning Institute and the Morgantown Art\n\nLeague with Susan Witt.\n\n​\n\nKATHLEEN KRIZNER\n\n​\n\nI grew up in Uniontown, Pennsylvania, but I’ve spent my adult life in North\n\nCentral West Virginia. I hold a nursing degree from Presbyterian University\n\nHospital and a Masters in Technical Education from Marshal University. After\n\na long career in nursing and teaching, I retired to find myself wondering what\n\nto do with all my free time. My answer came from a sign advertising drawing\n\nlessons. That was the beginning of my painting adventure.\n\nDrawing lessons lead to watercolor classes and a whole world of exciting\n\ndiscoveries. My primary focus is watercolor, but I’ve dabbled in other media\n\nsuch as acrylics and alcohol inks. I’ve even tried my hand at jewelry making.\n\nFor the past several years I’ve attended classes and workshops at the\n\nMorgantown Art Association with a group of likeminded artists and friends.\n\nMy art work has merited me recognition in the art community and several\n\nawards, for which I am very proud. Painting is the creative outlet I can enjoy\n\n​well into the future.\n\n​SANDY CROSS SMITH\n\nI am a native West Virginian and have lived most of my life in Morgantown.\n\nHowever, I was born in Weston and lived in several small towns while growing\n\nup. I graduated from Parkersburg High School. My college education was\n\nobtained at West Virginia University where I majored in Art and English\n\nEducation. My teaching career spanned a period of 32 years in the\n\nelementary schools of Preston County and Monongalia County. I was a\n\ntraveling Art teacher in several Preston County schools, but most of my\n\nteaching career was devoted to the regular elementary classrooms. I was\n\nable to use art across the curriculum to teach and enrich student learning\n\nwith a variety of hands on projects such as Paper Mache world globes,\n\nerupting volcanoes, and wildlife murals. Art has been an important part of my\n\npersonal life, as I have experimented and devoted a lot of time to several\n\nmediums such as oil and acrylic painting, fabric arts, quilting and sewing as well\n\nas knitting. It has been a new adventure for me to delve into the world of\n\nwatercolor. Currently I am attending watercolor classes taught by Susan Witt\n\nwhich are offered through the Morgantown Art Association. I am a fairly new\n\nmember of the Morgantown Art Association but was able to attend a Lynn\n\nFerris workshop last fall. Hopefully I can attend more workshops in the\n\nfuture.\n\nI believe I am a very fortunate person to be blessed with a husband who\n\nencourages me to paint and practice my artistic efforts. My two sons and\n\ntheir wives, as well as my five grandchildren, appreciate and support my\n\nefforts as well. I am lucky to live in the beautiful state of WV which is a\n\nconstant inspiration for artistic expression.\n\n​\n\nNANCY BIGGS\n\n[email protected]\n\nMy current work reflects my enjoyment in exploring and discovering what\n\ncolor does as it joins another color, side by side or entwining, on paper, fiber\n\nor other materials, controlled or spontaneous.\n\nEach of my works, other than greeting cards, is one of a kind. The themes\n\narise in my own mind, the interpretation evolves, as I explore or develop a way\n\nto see where it leads me. All is searching. All exists only once.\n\nEver since childhood, interpreting my view of things has come as naturally as\n\nbreathing. Over the years it has been expressed in many ways – through\n\ndesigning and making clothing and accessories in batik, through experiments in\n\nclay, through designing and knitting hand-spun sweaters, through interest in\n\nantique sewing machines and quilting in both traditional and modern art quilt\n\nstyles.\n\nI base my philosophy on a little card given to me years ago at an arts festival…\n\n​In the entire history of the universe\n\nPast…Present…Future\n\nYou are the only You\n\nThere will ever be.\n\nNo other living being can share\n\nWhat you have been given to share.\n\n​\n\nJOHN MOON\n\nMy name is John Moon. I live in Masontown, West Virginia with my wife, Virginia.\n\nI have three adult children. For thirty-five years I worked in coal mines as a\n\nmechanic.\n\nMy interest in art began in high school where I took auto body repair training\n\nand learned airbrush painting techniques. I began to custom paint motorcycle\n\ngas tanks as a lifelong hobby. I also learned about woodworking and have built\n\ncustom cabinets for my own kitchen, and bunk beds for my grandsons.\n\nCurrently, I specialize in making hardwood trim molding for homes.\n\nAfter retiring from my work in the mines about three years ago, I began\n\nwatercolor classes with Susan Witt at the Morgantown Art Association\n\n​Gallery. I enjoy painting flowers and foliage.\n\n​\n\n​ISABEL HERNANDEZ\n\nIsabel Hernandez was born in Tenerife, Islas Canarias and raised in Venezuela\n\nwhere she lived and worked as an English teacher for many years. In 2002\n\nIsabel arrived in Morgantown with her two sons to get a M.A. in Technology\n\nEducation at WVU. Here she started working as a Spanish teacher in Preston\n\nand Monongalia Counties until she retired in 2016. Then she could finally devote\n\nmore time to what she wanted to do all her life: to paint with watercolors.\n\nIsabel is a self-taught artist. In 2016 she joined Morgantown Art Association\n\nwhere she has been taking classes with Susan Witt. She has attended a\n\nworkshop with Robin Poteet and some online classes. Isabel has also viewed\n\nmany videos, so she can learn from popular watercolorists like Karlyn Holman,\n\n​Rick Surowicz, and many others.\n\n​\n\nThe artist loves nature and the outdoors: therefore, her work focuses on\n\nflorals, animals, and landscapes. From a very early age, Isabel showed a big\n\ninterest in drawing, painting, and creating things, but life took her on a\n\ndifferent direction until now, when she can express her art through color and\n\ncreativity.\n\n​\n\n​\n\nBECKY TURTON\n\nBorn in Fort Belvoir, Virginia.

Before that, I was more\n\ninterested in taking family pictures. I have been involved with MAA for several\n\nyears and have come to appreciate that photography is truly an art form.\n\nMy main interests are taking landscapes, waterfalls, and flowers. I also really\n\nenjoy taking action sports shots of my grandsons, Logan and Brady.

Hopefully I can attend more workshops in the future.\n\nI believe I am a very fortunate person to be blessed with a husband who\n\nencourages me to paint and practice my artistic efforts. My two sons and\n\ntheir wives, as well as my five grandchildren, appreciate and support my\n\nefforts as well. I am lucky to live in the beautiful state of WV which is a\n\nconstant inspiration for artistic expression.\n\n​\n\n​\n\nSUE CRIST\n\n* Morgantown, WV, native\n\n* West Virginia University— BFA (Graphic Design, 1977) and MA (Counseling, 1997)\n\n* Graphic designer at WVU for 30 years; retired in 2014\n\n* Began watercolor painting and became a Morgantown Art Association\n\nmember in 2016.\n\nMy mother Doris Kelly was a founding member of the Morgantown Art\n\nAssociation (MAA) and an active artist until she passed in 2013. My plan was to\n\nhave her teach me to paint when I retired. The timing wasn’t to be, but I\n\ninherited all of her art materials, including a palette full of watercolor paint.\n\nWith MAA Instructor Susan Witt’s guidance, I have discovered the magic of\n\nwatercolor. It gives me great joy to use my Mother’s paints with a few new\n\n“quacky” colors added to the palette.\n\n​\n\nTIA HUNT\n\nReedsville, WV\n\nHorses…drawing…dislike of “Paint by Number” kits. Originally from Kelso,\n\nWashington I loved drawing, had my own horse by age 7, well, I shared a horse\n\nwith my younger sister and having received my “Paint-by-Number” paint kit (of\n\na horse), decided that was not for me. The paints came out, and I painted my\n\nown pictures. My father gave me my first Grumbacher oil paint set for\n\nChristmas when I was seventeen, and my husband gave me my first paint box\n\nand easel.\n\nIn Huntington Junior High School my art teacher entered my pen and ink\n\ndrawing of horses in a school art show. During 4-H my various projects\n\ninclude horses, photography, cooking (where I learned cake decorating),\n\nsewing and Junior Leadership. I had the privilege to attend various workshops\n\nin Temecula, California instructed by William F. Powell, author of many Foster\n\nart books and originally from Huntington. WV. Prior to moving to West Virginia,\n\nI attended San Jacinto Community College and studied painting under John\n\nDingler learning techniques of masters, one of whom was Caravaggio. I had the\n\nprivilege of viewing works by Caravaggio in Vienna, Austria. Drawing and design\n\nclasses were instructed by Ms. Rodriquez, who included one of my design\n\nprojects, “Prague” in the Spring Student Art Show. I also learned the art of\n\npainting porcelain dolls from Kay (a former artist with Franklin Mint, in Lake\n\nElsinore, CA), basket weaving in Temecula, CA, as well as at Prickett’s Fort,\n\nWV.\n\nAfter moving to West Virginia with my husband and daughter, I attended\n\nwatercolor and oil painting classes at MTEC. After joining the Morgantown Art\n\nAssociation, my art education has changed from oil painting to watercolor\n\nunder the tutelage of Susan Witt, a workshop with Robin Poteet, a Plein Air oil\n\npainting workshop with T.M. Nichols, a basket weaving workshop and various\n\ninteresting Kappa Tau education events.\n\nThe mountains and scenery in West Virginia are as awe inspiring as the\n\nmountains of Washington state, lending themselves to hours of drawing and\n\npainting pleasure. I enjoy traveling with my husband, watching my grandsons\n\nwith their school, sports (hockey and baseball) and now horseback riding\n\nendeavors. I enjoy my two wonderful daughters with their life journeys. Visits\n\nto museums afford the pleasure of viewing inspiring works of art by well-\n\n​known artists and discovering the unknown.\n\n​\n\nSALLY H. DIGMAN\n\nSally grew up in Silver Spring, MD, near Washington, D.C. As a young child, she\n\nenjoyed coloring and making designs, but became discouraged at an early age\n\nby an elementary teacher, who took her exquisite drawing of the Maryland\n\nstate tree, the mighty oak, and using a red pen, circled her creatively included\n\nsquirrel hole and wrote, “What’s That?” This didn’t keep Sally from competing\n\nin neighborhood coloring contests, judged by various available mothers.\n\nSally did take advantage of the opportunities that D.C. offered to a young\n\nperson interested in art. While skipping school, she occasionally left her truant\n\nfriends behind and road her bike down Rock Creek Parkway to the National\n\nArt Gallery. In addition, she had plenty of time to make many designs and\n\ndrawings, due to being regularly grounded and restricted to her room during\n\nmost of her junior high and early high school years. Her walls were full.\n\nIn a last-ditch attempt to find some activity to keep her out of trouble, Sally’s\n\nparents asked if she might want to take some painting lessons. Skeptical, but\n\nsomewhat interested, Sally decided to give that a try. Mrs. Glen Hill, a truly\n\nexceptional portrait artist in the D.C. area, decided (Sally suspects bribery, or\n\npity for her parents) to let Sally join her Saturday group of young woman\n\nartists, and put a paintbrush in her hand. Sally came to enjoy the intensity and\n\ncamaraderie of the other painters, and soon began learning the secrets of\n\nturning canvas into color. She never skipped painting class.\n\nIn a further attempt to keep Sally out of delinquency and in school, Sally was\n\nplaced into three art classes during her senior year by her beloved guidance\n\ncounselor, Mr. Rowsie. They were close friends by this time, as you might\n\nimagine. She got to paint and paint and paint. One art teacher, Mrs. Davila, let\n\nSally go outside and draw; quite a risk on her part, but Sally usually came\n\nback. Another art teacher, Ms. Briskman, eventually laid out a challenge to\n\nSally to paint something that was completely abstract, but Sally could never do\n\nit without it turning into something realistic. (Still working on that.)\n\nAstonishingly, Sally won some nice prizes for her work.\n\nAfter high school there was no time for art. College, marriage, teaching,\n\nchildren, graduate school, and work as a faculty member and administrator at\n\nseveral area colleges and universities (Alderson-Broaddus College, West Virginia\n\nUniversity, Salem International University, Fairmont State University), left little\n\ntime and energy for painting…\n\n…until she met Jane Cardi, 35 years after high school, who got Sally into her\n\npainting class with instructor, Jeanette Campbell. The fabulous ladies of\n\nWednesday evening art class, still paint together and learn together at the\n\n​Morgantown Art Association Gallery. Come join us!\n\nMYUNG RYOU\n\nMyung Ryou lives in Morgantown, West Virginia and has been painting\n\nwatercolors and oils since 2013 at the Morgantown Art Gallery. She takes\n\nclasses and workshops with Susan Witt, Sharon Hildebrand, nationally renowned\n\nartists such as Karlyn Holman, Frank Webb, Daniel David, Lynn Ferris, Laurie\n\nGoldstein-Warren, William Vrscak and others. She is also a Tamarack Artist\n\nand a Juried member of the West Virginia Watercolor Society.\n\nLoving art is quite an accident for her. She has been making pottery for\n\nmany years and wanting to paint on her potteries. She found the right place,\n\nwhich is the Morgantown Art Association. Now she loves both painting and\n\nmaking pottery. She believes that life is a learning process and enjoys\n\nexpressing God-given talent.\n\nShe has two sons who are graduate students and wants to focus on her\n\n​studying and painting.\n\nFRANCOISE DEBEIR STAUBER\n\nI was born and grew up in Africa in what was then called the Belgium Congo\n\nbut lived most of my life in Ruanda Burundi. In 1958, I moved to Belgium. In 1969,\n\nI met my future husband in Belgium and came to the United States in 1970. We\n\nlived in New Jersey for a couple of years, then Iowa for a few more,\n\nbefore coming to Morgantown in 1979. West Virginia has been my home ever\n\nsince.\n\nI obtained a law degree at the University of Iowa, worked for a law firm\n\nthere until we moved to Morgantown. In West Virginia, I became a solo\n\npractitioner before being hired by West Virginia University Health Sciences\n\nCenter (HSC) as a risk manager. I worked as a risk manager for HSC for\n\nseveral years and moved to the Cancer Center to oversee the education\n\nprogram for the Breast and Cervical Cancer Screening program. The latter\n\njob, which I loved, gave me the opportunity to travel extensively throughout\n\nWest Virginia and to work with varied organizations statewide.\n\nI am a self-taught artist. I have always loved to draw but never pursued my\n\ninterest in art until I came to West Virginia. Over the years, I took classes\n\nlocally and workshops with several renowned artists, such as Jeanne Dobie,\n\nPeter Spataro, Fred Graff, Marilyn Phillys, Bill Vrsack, Pat Dews and others.\n\nMy local mentor and friend was Peggy Issac, who joined me on many artistic\n\nadventures including a painting trip to France. She enthusiastically guided my\n\nwatercolor training.\n\nToday, I use a variety of media (watercolor, charcoal, pen and ink, collages,\n\nprints, clay, acrylics). Sometimes I mix different media because I like to\n\nexperiment. Today, I work almost exclusively in acrylics. My works vary from\n\n​realism (landscapes, portraits) to abstract and other imaginary works.\n\nPOLLY JOHNSON\n\nPolly Johnson is a retired elementary school teacher of Monongalia County.\n\nShe grew up overseas in North Africa as a “missionary kid”. Her schooling, up\n\nuntil 9th grade, was entirely in French. Polly is a mother of three terrific\n\nadults and is excitedly expecting being a grandma for the first time this\n\nsummer.\n\nAs a child, she loved drawing and working with various art mediums. In school.\n\nArt class was her favorite subject. In college she painted with oils and\n\nconsidered majoring in art but ended up getting an elementary teaching degree\n\nfollowed by a Master’s in Special Education. After graduating and throughout\n\nher teaching career she sporadically continued to paint mostly in oils. Her\n\ngrandmother, a self-taught oil painter, inspired Polly. Her mother, Lila Rae, a\n\npotter, also had many artistic inclinations that rubbed off on her.\n\nEnjoyable times as a teacher were doing art projects with her students. She\n\njoined Etsy; where she sells jewelry, boxes, cards and paintings under\n\n“Pollyware”. (Etsy.com is the website where you can browse for all sorts of\n\narts and crafts.) After retiring several years ago, she joined MAA and\n\ntook watercolor classes from a gifted teacher, Susan Witt. It has been lots\n\nof fun! Polly also participated in several enjoyable workshops led by artists\n\nsuch as Karlyn Holman and Robin Poteet; where she learned so much. Lately\n\nPolly’s artwork has been influenced by the chickens she acquired and now\n\nraises since retiring. She is also interested in natural health & wellness and\n\nbecame a certified Essential Oils coach making soaps, creams and EO blends\n\nfor various ailments.\n\n​\n\nConstantly amazed by the beauty of God’s creation, she finds her ambition to\n\nreplicate it in artwork. Polly finds much enjoyment in painting, creating and\n\nliving as close to the way God intended as possible\n\n​\n\nJULIE SEXTONE\n\nI have lived in Morgantown, West Virginia for 35 years. During this time, I\n\nraised two boys, had a career in mental health as a Licensed Professional\n\nCounselor and a Board-Certified Art Therapist, and enjoyed the many outdoor\n\nopportunities that West Virginia offers.\n\nMy husband and I retired three years ago. We often travel to visit our seven\n\ngrandchildren, five in Charlotte, North Carolina and two in Denver, Colorado.\n\nDuring our trips we like to add on travel adventures for ourselves in an\n\nattempt to see more of the country. Travel is something we both enjoy, and\n\nwe plan to visit some of the many foreign countries on our bucket list.\n\nEven as a child I always had a strong interest in art. Over the years my focus\n\nbecame centered on watercolor painting and photography. To improve my\n\nskills, I have relied on workshops and classes from painters and\n\nphotographers who have inspired me. Some of these painters are Zoltan\n\nSzabo, Tom Lynch, Linda Kemp, Annalise Beauchamp, Margaret Lowry,\n\nChristopher Leeper, Karlyn Holman, Lynn Ferris, Andrea Schmitt, Lynn Lysick,\n\nand Susan Witt. I have learned many techniques from these painters who all\n\nhave their individual styles. I credit Lansing Community College’s photography\n\nstaff with helping me learn technical skills in photography.\n\n​\n\nI can be contacted at j[email protected]\n\nSUSAN HALL WITT\n\n[email protected]\n\n​I am a Morgantown resident who was raised in Preston\n\nCounty. I have lived in this area all my life and really enjoy\n\nWV and all its beauty. I have only been doing watercolors\n\nfor a few years and enjoy doing them and taking classes to\n\nimprove my skills. I took weekly classes with Peggy Isaack\n\nand Monica Wilkins. I started taking my first classes with\n\nAndrea Schmidt. I also enjoy taking many workshops.\n\n​\n\nIn addition to watercolors, I do stained glass and teach with\n\nthe community school program and in my studio. I enjoy\n\nknitting and teaching people to knit, thus my license plate\n\n\"KNITWIT\". I am an ex-nurse and had a home based clothing\n\ndesign and alteration business for years. I enjoy doing\n\ncarpentry and building furniture. My husband, Byron, and I\n\nhave two daughters, Carrie and Christina. Carrie is a social\n\nworker with Hospice Care Corp. and Christina is a teacher.\n\nThe joys of our lives are our two grandsons, Logan and\n\nBrady. It is my job to spoil them, and I have finally found\n\nsomething that I am truly good at.\n\nArtists Statement:\n\n​\"I feel that life should be a learning experience, and I am\n\ntrying to grasp as much as I can. I have never understood\n\npeople who say that have nothing to do. Go out and learn a\n\nnew skill. Find something that you enjoy and have fun in life.\n\nWe only go through once so make the most of it. I hope\n\nthat you enjoy my paintings as much as I enjoy painting\n\n​them.\"\n\n​\n\nYou can view my work on Facebook at \"knitwitart\"\n\nCINDY O'BRIAN\n\n​\n\nI am not a native West Virginian, but I like to tell folks I got\n\nhere as soon as I could. After the ’85 flood, I traveled up-\n\nriver against the flow from a temporary residence in\n\nPoint Marion to settle here in Morgantown where I lived\n\nhappily ever after. My three children are Morgantown High\n\ngraduates and I taught at Mountainview Elementary after\n\nworking for years in the Head Start/Pre-K program, so I\n\nhope that establishes a legitimate connection to the\n\ncommunity!\n\n​While I have no formal art training, throughout my life I have\n\nfound joy in creating. I believe my work with young children\n\nhas allowed me to retain an ability to see things in\n\nimaginative ways. A resident of South Park, I enjoy walking\n\ninto town regularly. I became aware of the cracks and\n\npatterns on the sidewalks and started taking photos of the\n\nmore attractive ones. As I looked at them more closely I\n\nbegan to construct images that the crack lines suggested. I\n\nprinted the photos onto paper and got out my markers,\n\npaints and pencils and brought the images to life.\n\nI became an illustrator of children’s books out of necessity.\n\nAfter writing a book for children in my Pre-K class, I\n\nwondered how to find someone to illustrate it. In trying to\n\ndemonstrate the ideas I had for the illustrations, I played\n\naround with buttons, clay and scraps of materials and\n\ncomposed my own collage illustrations. I hope the children\n\nwho enjoy my books are inspired to make their own “art\n\nwork”.\n\nThere is beauty in everyday things and I celebrate that with\n\nfound-object art made with oxidized copper wire, circuit\n\nboards, or wood fragments found at Cooper’s Rock.\n\nTo give back to our community that has provided so much\n\nto me, I donate art to organizations for fundraisers.\n\n​Contact me for more information: [email protected]\n\n​DON STEVENS\n\n​\n\nArtist of the month, Don Stevens, was born and raised in\n\nFairmont, WV.
