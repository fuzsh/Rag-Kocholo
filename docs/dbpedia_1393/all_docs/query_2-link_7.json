        "text": "The forms were often repeated one thing after the other in regular, non-hierarchical arrangements and thereby rejecting compositional balancing. The objects were fabricated from new and industrial materials. Due to this emphasis on basic elements, Minimal Art is also known as ABC Art.\n\nWith minimalism, meaning doesn’t rest inside the object, waiting to be unlocked but in the context and in your interaction with it. It encourages observation, but doesn’t draw you in and never tries to. Minimalist art imparts a feeling for space, light and you notice that your position in the room shapes your perception of the thing.\n\nMinimalism and Architecture\n\nMinimal architecture uses simple geometric shapes, clean lines, flat roofs, huge windows, natural lighting, balanced colors, basic materials, neat components and soul soothing negative spaces. The early minimalist architecture can be found in the works of Le Corbusier in the 1920s, who created innovative buildings with striking geometrical designs.\n\nLe Corbusier was a pioneer of minimal modern architecture. He used elemental geometric forms, proportion, modularity and proclaimed that the base principal for design is that “it must be beautiful.”\n\nArchitect John Pawson famously remarked: “The minimum could be defined as the perfection that an artefact achieves when it is no longer possible to improve on it by subtraction.” The architects and designers looked to attain simplicity with the help of elegant lighting and huge spaces with very less objects and furniture. The main idea was to strip everything to its essential element to a point where nothing could be removed further to improve the design.\n\nThe rise of minimalism in architecture was also a result of rapid expansion and chaotic environment of urban life. It is hugely inspired by Zen influenced Japanese minimalist design. The Zen idea of simplicity conveys the nature of freedom in a way that simplicity is much more than aesthetics, it's also about our relationship with innate qualities of materials and objects.\n\nOne of the iconic figure in the field of architecture is the Japanese minimalist architect Tadao Ando who is known for his minimal designs which revolved around geometry, materials and nature. He would normally use basic natural structural forms and materials like natural wood to achieve simplicty. He creates a discourse between the site and nature to set up a relationship and order with the buildings.\n\nTadao Andos’ style is known as Critical Regionalism, utlizing aspects of Modernism and Post Modernism. Known for balancing concrete with weightlessness of light, his work involves a masterful use of elements from his Japanese heritage where light enters the interiors at the right angles to create a visually rich modern aesthetic.\n\nMinimalist architecture find its roots not only in the Japanese culture but also in movements like De Stilj and Bauhaus. Infact, minimalism is often referred to as the pared down product of the Bauhaus era. Bauhaus was a German school of art and architecture which redefined the effect of design in the Modernist age. It laid emphasis on functionality and their famous line ‘form follows function’ is hugely popular even today. They used clean lines, white space and simple color themes. The Bauhaus designs were not only functional but also beautiful.\n\nOne of key figure in popularity of minimalism and the third director of Bauhaus art school is the German architect, Ludwig Mies van der Rohe. Also know as the father of modern architecture, he gave the slogan “Less is more” to define his design aesthetic and used new materials like glass and steel over concrete. His method was to place the required component of the building in a way that it gives a sense of simplicity and made sure that his work serves both visual and functional elements.\n\nMinimalism in Product and Scandinavian Interior Design\n\nMinimalism in product and interior design is a trend where a subject is brought down to its essential elements. Clean lines, solid neutral tones, natural materials, symmetry, visual balance and elegant lighting are key components of minimalist design.\n\nMinimalist product design picked up the lead from art and architecture movements. Max Bill, a former Bauhaus art school student co-founded Ulm School of Design in Germany. It worked closely with Braun, whose design head Dieter Rams designed products which influenced Jony Ive, the former chief design officer of Apple and who’s responsible for designing products like iPhone, iPod and iPad. Companies like Apple have successfully used the minimal design concepts into their products.\n\nIn Interior design, Scandinavian design is a design movement inspired by minimalism. It thrived in the 50s across Nordic countries combining elements like geometric patterns, natural materials like wood, stone, pops of color and functionality. Scandinavian design takes inspiration from the natural world and only those components of design are considered which are natural. At the same time, functionality is equally important in Scandinavian interiors.\n\nWhat We Can Learn From Minimalism\n\n1. RESTRAINT INSPIRES CREATION\n\nMinimalism is an approach to see beauty in the simplest of forms. Although it might seem like a basic design principle, it requires a great amount of creativity when you have to reduce the creation to its essential elements with the help of simple forms and produce works which are in harmony with space.\n\n2. EMBRACE SIMPLICITY\n\nMinimalism embraces the philosophy of less is more at every level. It asks us to reflect on what is really essential in our lives and get rid of the daily clutter. It also reminds us that the absence of something can be even more beautiful than the thing itself. Embracing a minimalist lifestyle helps us to question what are the things that really bring joy in our lives so we can lead a more fulfilled life.\n\n3. WHAT YOU SEE IS WHAT YOU SEE\n\nMinimalism is present in almost every part of our lives. Although it doesn’t convey any emotional symbolism yet the aesthetics of it is quite rewarding for the viewer. It doesn’t try to replicate outside reality and the focus is only on what is in front of the viewer. It tells us that pieces or objects doesn’t express anything but themselves. This means the art is reduced to its truest form."
