With daily contact over the course of a full semester, resident artists develop a unique relationship with the student body which complements the creative stimulation offered by guest lecturers and the School of Art’s faculty. Representing diverse ethnic, cultural, educational, and professional backgrounds, these resident artists introduce another layer of candor and a fresh artistic standard for the students who, though early in their formal art studies, are beginning to develop their own perceptions, skills, and theories in connection with the making of art.\n\nClick here to view installation images.\n\nClick here to view the exhibition catalogue.\n\nBerkana\n\nJanuary 11 – February 11, 2018\n\nEleanna Anagnos was born in Evanston, IL. She currently works and resides in Brooklyn, NY. Anagnos received her MFA from Tyler School of Art, Temple University Philadelphia, Pa in 2005 and her BA from Kenyon College in 2002.\n\n“Eleanna’s work is mysterious. And it deserves a thorough look. Her materials and processes are purposefully elusive. There is thought here—you can feel it radiating off the work. Sometimes the work feels like a long meditative breath. Sometimes it feels like a busy mind spinning and rolling thoughts over and over … [T]here is a duality in all of what Eleanna makes. Sometimes that duality is a mirroring effect in the form and sometimes it is within the materials. She makes work on paper and with a sculptural material called Hydrocal that is a gypsum cement. The works on paper exist between painting and drawing and the works in Hydrocal are both paintings and sculptures and yet not fully either.”_ Kelly McCafferty, The Coastal Post.\n\nClick here to view installation images.\n\n71st Annual Student Art Competition\n\nFebruary 22 – March 8, 2018\n\nBegun in 1947 by C.

This multi-disciplinary group brings together members of the UT community who share an interest in researching the development and use of simulations, gaming, role-playing, and similar strategies for teaching and learning. Such strategies are among the latest developments in higher education, and have been shown to create interactivity and collaboration, increase engagement and retention, deepen reflection and understanding, engender positive values and thoughtful behavior, and open authentic spaces for real-world problem-solving. Games and Simulations provide players/users with the opportunity to not only visualize, but to experience the world of a problem from a variety of perspectives.\n\nFeatured Games:\n\nMarrying Mr. Darcy\n\nMarrying Mr. Darcy is a strategy card game for 2-6 players based on Jane Austen’s classic novel “Pride and Prejudice.”\n\nWalden, a gamePlay as Henry David Thoreau, the American philosopher and naturalist, during his experiment in living simply in nature. Apply yourself to both the daily tasks of maintaining your basic needs of life at Walden Pond, as well as searching for the small beauties and wonders of nature in this virtual environment.\n\nEmbodied Labs\n\nEmbodied Labs works at the intersection of healthcare training and virtual reality storytelling to provide a culture shift solution that empowers every member of the care team to share their expertise and value one another.\n\nThe Cat and the Coup\n\nThe Cat and the Coup is a documentary videogame in which you play the cat of Dr. Mohammed Mossadegh, the first democratically elected Prime Minister of Iran. During the summer of 1953, the CIA engineered a coup to bring about his downfall. As a player, you coax Mossadegh back through significant events of his life by knocking objects off of shelves, scattering his papers, jumping on his lap and scratching him.\n\nGood Society\n\nGood Society is a collaborative roleplaying game that seeks to capture the heart, and the countenance, of Jane Austen’s work. It is a game of balls, estates, sly glances, and turns about the garden. At least on the surface. Underneath this, just as in Austen’s own novels, it is a game of social ambition, family obligation and breathtaking, heart-stopping longing.\n\nClick here to view installation images.\n\nIrons in the Fire\n\nSeptember 16 – October 6, 2018\n\nCurated by sculpture alumnus, Bill FitzGibbons, Irons in the Fire features UT BFA and MFA alums from the past 25 years.\n\nExhibiting alums are: Jessica Brooke Anderson, MFA 2013 / Leticia Bajuyo, MFA 2001 / Robmat Butler, MFA 2009 / Mike Calway-Fagen, BFA 2006 / Dan DeZarn, BFA 2003 / Richard Ensor, BFA 2015 / Preston Farabow, BFA 1992 / Cassidy Frye, MFA 2018 / Brian Jobe, BFA 2004 / David Jones, MFA 2004 / Noah Kirby, 1998 / Alison Ouellette-Kirby, MFA 1996 / Candice Lewis, MFA 2004 / Erica Mendoza, MFA 2018 / Marisa Mitchell, BFA 2016 / Lauren Sanders, BFA 2015 / Joshua Shorey, MFA 2017 / Jacob Stanley, MFA 2010 / Thomas Sturgill, BFA 2003 / Durant Thompson, BFA 1997 / John Truex, BFA 2004 / Kevin Varney, MFA 2014 / Taylor Wallace, BFA 2005 / AC Wilson, BFA 2012 / Ronda Wright, BFA 2009\n\nClick here to view installation images.\n\nDialogues: Oyler Wu Collaborative\n\nOctober 12 – 31, 2018\n\nThe exhibit is the first comprehensive show of Oyler Wu Collaborative’s work featuring original hand drawings by Dwanye Oyler and jewelry from Jenny Wu.\n\nClick here to view installation images.\n\nBlurring Boundaries: The Women of American Abstract Artists\n\nNovember 15 – December 13, 2018\n\nCurated by Rebecca DiGiovannaMore than 80 years after its founding, AAA continues to nurture and support a vibrant community of artists with diverse identities and approaches to abstraction.

He was soon introduced to the work of his new Art Department colleague, Carl Sublett who was having a solo exhibition in UT’s Audigier Gallery. Sublett had arrived at UT only 2 years earlier at the request of the department’s founder Kermit Ewing to assist him with painting classes. From the newly formed friendship between Sublett and Stevens, sprang a strong professional bond that they shared for the remainder of their lives. They enjoyed plein air painting and often traveled together to locations around Knoxville. In their own studio practice, they shared a workaholic attitude towards art production. As artists, they shared an intense studio commitment to painting and drawing.They both, also, spent summers in Maine. Sublett and Stevens had an annual routine of spending the academic year in Knoxville and the summer in Maine until Stevens’ death on Deer Isle in 1980 and until Sublet’s retirement in 1982.

Becton makes work, in part, about his surroundings. The extraordinary sweeping coastal views that are such a part of daily life when one lives by the sea are often incorporated into his images. Equally critical is internal life, both the space inside the home (and the comfort and protection it provides from northern New England’s inclement weather), and the introspective and contemplative space that enlivens one’s imagination, which is no doubt encouraged in this stunning and remote location.\n\nClick to view installation images.\n\n2015\n\nCompound Lens\n\nJanuary 11 – February 8, 2015\n\nThis exhibition features the photographic and video work of 19 University of Tennessee alumni and students of Baldwin Lee.

Killaars places color at the center of her practice, production, and viewer’s experience. Her installations exist in a space that merges art, architecture, fashion, and interior design.\n\nHer most common formats are carpets and bedspreads, or walls covered with textiles, which she has made in a handloom mill in India. These, and the inclusion of the human figure in the form of mannequins, are the most frequent components of her installations. The embodied shapes evoke associations to historic and contemporary representations of women. In Color at the Center, her textiles also take the form of everyday objects such as walls, beds, or are stacked on chairs. This exhibition was curated by Dan Mills, Bates Museum of Art, Lewiston, ME.\n\nClick here to view installation images.\n\nRemix: Selections from the International Collage Center and Richard Meier: Selected Collage Works\n\nNovember 4 – December 8, 2013\n\nRemix presents the work of over 100 artists drawn from the ICC’s permanent lending and research collection alongside further loans from prominent artists.\n\nRichard Meier: Selected Collage Works is a presentation of 20 recent works.

Berry, UT Downtown Gallery manager; Jessie Van der Laan, UT Print Shop Tech; and Sarah McFalls and Jennifer Stoneking -Stewart, Ewing Gallery staff.\n\nThese four artists currently create work that represents a distortion of the natural landscape and addresses the relationship we often have with the idea of “place.”\n\nClick here to view installation images.\n\nMike Wsol – Limited Vision\n\nConfabulatores Nocturni\n\nAugust 20 – September 10, 2012\n\nCONFABULATORES NOCTURNI\n\ntheoretical design project . exhibited\n\nsomewhere between sunset and sunrise\n\nFrom these two incontrovertible premises he deduced that the Library is total and that its shelves register all the possible combinations of the twenty-odd orthographical symbols – a number which, though extremely vast, is not infinite.\n\n– Excerpt from “The Library of Babel” by Jorge Luis Borges\n\nCe8, Cg7, Ch5, Cf6, Ce4, Ch1 | The CABANON exists somewhere between sunset and sunrise. They are fictions that draw their primary motivation from Diderot and d’Alembert’s Encyclopédie. The visual equivalent to the Library of Borges, the Encyclopédie serves as a visual taxonomy of all human knowledge catalogued under the three primary branches of memory, reason, and imagination – past, present, and future. Is it possible that the volumes of the Encyclopédie possess all of our collective spatial fictions? Through the narrative morphosis of collage, each CABANON acquires the personality of a scribe. New fictions surface. Arranged in a columbarium-like wall, the communicative structure between these scribes emerges as a contemplation of the enigmatic Knight’s Tour. This ancient and cryptic geometry becomes at times a thanatopsis, at times a colloquy between divines.\n\nClick here to view installation images.\n\nPencil Pushed\n\nSeptember 17 – October 28, 2012\n\ncurated by Creighton Michael\n\nIn this exhibition, the word pencil functions simply as a metaphor or symbol for drawing and its activity. The artists selected are known for their drawing or drawing activity as their primary means of expression and have either pushed the material, process, or boundary of conventional drawing. Media included video, sculpture, animation, installation, and of course, works on paper. This exhibition is neither a survey nor the definitive grouping of mark-making artists. It is more a conversation about artists who have and continue to explore these regions in drawing. The diversity of the exhibition favored mid-career artists, but ranged from emerging to late.\n\nFeatured artists in Pencil Pushed are: William Anastasi, William Pittman Andrews, Caroline Burton, Elisa D’Arrigo, Mary Reid Kelley, Sharon Louden, Jennifer Macdonald, Peter Mollenkof, Darcy Brennan Poor, Bill Richards, Beatrice Riese, Hilda Shen, Drew Shiflett, Stephen Talasnik, and Sam Vernon.\n\nClick here to view installation images.\n\nClick here to view the exhibition catalogue.\n\nJanusz Kapusta: Rhapsody in K-dron\n\nNovember 1 – 15, 2012\n\nDiscovered by Polish artist, Janusz Kapusta in 1985 and patented in 1987, the name K-Dron originates from K, the 11th letter of the alphabet, and GK-EDRON, the Greek word for surface. Being both a remarkably simple and complex structure, its basic form has a square base, 11 multifaceted sides and a diamond-shaped face with a 45-degree angle of inclination. Janusz Kapusta has developed K-Dron’s versatility to invent the K-Dron game in which 8 K-Drons of two colors (black and white) can be manipulated to produce patterns of up to 38,416 possible combinations. The exhibition is made possible through the generous support of the Marek Maria Pienkowski Foundation.\n\nClick here to view installation images.\n\nQuadrivium\n\nNovember 18 – December 16, 2012\n\nQuadrivium is Latin for “the four ways” or “the place where four roads meet” and was used during the Renaissance Period to describe the four subjects — arithmetic, geometry, music, and astronomy — that were taught after teaching the trivium.\n\nFor this exhibition, we are using Quadrivium to describe Knoxville and the School of Art as the place where artistic roads and artists have met.\n\nQuadrivium features the work of the four most recent additions to the faculty of the School of Art. We are pleased to exhibit work by Joshua Bienko, drawing; Evan Meaney, transmedia design; Althea Murphy-Price, printmaking; and Karla Wozniak, painting.\n\nClick here to view installation images.\n\nClick here to view the exhibition catalogue.\n\n2011\n\nCarlo Scarpa\n\nJanuary 13 – February 17, 2011\n\nCarlo Scarpa: A House and a Door, is a rare opportunity to closely examine original drawings by one of the 20th-century’s most important designers and architects.

Seeing the Panorama Mesdag in 1981 in The Hague, Netherlands, inspired Wurmfeld to create a non-representational 360-degree painting, an idea for a work seemingly no one else had accomplished at that time. By 1989 he completed a 1/5-scale model for what would eventually become Cyclorama 2000, a circular structured painting in the round based on the color circle at full saturation. This work was commissioned and later purchased by the Karl Ernst Osthaus Museum in Hagen, Germany, under the leadership of the former director, Michael Fehr. By 2006, Wurmfeld was making plans for the E-Cyclorama. The E-Cyclorama debuted at the Edinburgh College of Art during the Edinburgh Festival from July-September 2008. It later appeared at a second venue, The Neuberger Museum, SUNY Purchase, May-July 2009. The Cyclorama 2000 and the E-Cyclorama are the only two known non-representational 360-degree paintings.\n\nClick here to view installation images.\n\nClick here to view construction images.\n\n2011 Artist in Residence Biennial\n\nNovember 10 – December 9, 2011 Keltie Ferris, Rob Nadeau, Ezra Johnson, and Josephine Halvorson\n\nThe presence of acclaimed artists—who have lived and worked in major cultural centers across the country—enhances the educational opportunities for both undergraduate and graduate students enrolled in the University of Tennessee School of Art. With daily contact over the course of a full semester, resident artists develop a unique relationship with the student body which complements the creative stimulation offered by guest lecturers and the School of Art’s faculty. Representing diverse ethnic, cultural, educational, and professional backgrounds, these resident artists introduce another layer of candor and a fresh artistic standard for the students who, though early in their formal art studies, are beginning to develop their own perceptions, skills, and theories in connection with the making of art.\n\nClick here to view installation images."
