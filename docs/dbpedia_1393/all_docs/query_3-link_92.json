Their distinct black finish and geometric forms represent one of the supreme achievements in American sculpture, and his unique vision has proven enormously influential on subsequent generations. A contemporary of the Abstract Expressionists, many of whom were his close friends, Smith studied architecture, then began painting in the 1930s before turning to architecture full-time in the 1940s to support his family. It was not until the late 1950s that he began to make sculpture, and he had his first one-person exhibition in 1964. Two years later Smith was included in Primary Structures, one of the most important exhibitions of the 1960s, at The Jewish Museum, New York.
