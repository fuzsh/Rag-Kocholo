        "text": "This is a list of sculptures by Tony Smith, most of which are installed outdoors. While Smith made many artworks in a variety of media and his work as an architectural designer, he is widely known for his sculptures, which range from the small to monumental scale.[1][2] No complete inventory has been published that identifies the current location of all of these works, but in the 1990s Save Outdoor Sculpture! (SOS!) participants completed an inventory and assessment of 83 of these sculptures.[3]\n\nPhoto Title Year Edition Number Media Dimensions Owner Current Location GPS Coordinates City State/Country Private or Public Untitled 1954 Wood 21-3/8\" x 20-1/2\" x 12\" Private collection Private Untitled 1956 Concrete 8\" x 5\" x 3\" Private collection Private Throne 1956-57 6/6 Steel, painted black 28\" x 39\" x 32\" Private collection Private Untitled 1960 Wire shirt hangers, plaster, and gauze fabric 47-1/2\" x 12-1/2\" x 12\" Private collection Private Bennington Structure 1961 Plywood, metal, lathe, and Portland cement 40' long overall, diameter of each unit approx 9' Destroyed Cigarette (1/3) 1961 1/3 Steel, Cor-ten, oiled finish 15'1\" × 25'6\" × 18'7\" Albright–Knox Art Gallery Buffalo NY Public Cigarette (2/3) 1961 2/3 Steel, painted black 15'1\" × 25'6\" × 18'7\" Museum of Modern Art Not on view New York City NY Public Cigarette (3/3) 1961 3/3 Steel, painted black 15'1\" × 25'6\" × 18'7\" Kykuit (John D.
