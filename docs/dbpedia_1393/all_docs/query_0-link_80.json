        "text": "Information:\n\nTony Smith (1912-80) architect, painter and sculptor, was a third-generation South Orange native whose monumental abstract sculptures revolutionized public art and galvanized the international art scene. He lived and worked most of his life in South Orange and his backyard was a neighborhood curiosity with plywood mockups of sculptures that would soon fill museums all over the world.This on-site event at TAU will expose attendees to the grandeur of the sculpture’s scale and form. As the class proceeds around the sculpture’s base, three experts will discuss the significance of Smith’s background, work and worldwide recognition; the effect of place on art in a public environment and the controversies often surrounding a public art piece like TAU. Presenters: JOAN PACHNER, curator, lecturer, Tony Smith expert; TOM NUSSBAUM, artist, outdoor sculptor; DAN BISCHOFF, art reviewer, lecturer. To learn more about the Pierro Foundation Tony Smith project, please visit tonysmithsouthorange.org.\n\nNote: this event is being held outdoors at the sculpture site with very limited seating available; please be prepared to stand and move about"
