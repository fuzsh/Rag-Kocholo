        "text": "SFX: Music – Lively, playful, with pointy edges\n\nRON DAVIS:\n\nEverything around us is shapes and geometries and relationships, but there’s so much information, we can’t appreciate it.\n\nSFX: Footsteps\n\nDAVIS:\n\nHi I’m Ron Davis. I design three-dimensional environments, whether they’re play structures or learning experiences….\n\nSFX: Ron continues talking while Narrator comes in over the top of him\n\nNARRATOR:\n\nWe spent some time with Ron, looking at this sculpture by Tony Smith. Smith trained as an architect before turning to sculpture. Ron told us he can see that —\n\nDAVIS:\n\nThat scale, it commands your attention. It makes you look up. It makes you think of it like you might a building. That you walk around it, or under it or through it.\n\nAnybody who makes things in three dimensions…wants it to be experienced in time. And you want there to be surprises and delightful unexpected juxtapositions, sort of an Aha! thing that lets you say “oh that looks like such and such, oh its very triangular” and then you come around and you say “oh its not very triangular it’s more square – how did that thing turn from that to that”?\n\nIt seems it’s a solid and then you come around and you realize there’s sort of a diamond-shaped portal through it. So not only is the sculpture changing, but you’re getting this framed view of whatever else is around it, which is really magical."
