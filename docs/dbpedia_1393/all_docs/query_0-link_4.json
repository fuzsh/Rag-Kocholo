        "text": "Encompassing three works—Tau (1961-62), Source (1967), and Throwback (1976-77)—the exhibition touches on key moments in the artist’s evolving sculptural practice. Shaped by his training and prior career as an architect, Smith’s work is animated by a dynamic concept of space and a commitment to sculpture as an object to be catalyzed by the direct engagement of the human body.\n\nI like a certain amount of mystery involved, which demands involvement on the part of the person seeing it. I think the guise of the work has something to do with the kinetic quality. It demands a certain amount of action.\n\nPossessing no traditional front or back and occupying non-linear planes of space, Smith’s sculptures reward an ambulatory viewing experience, offering a range of perspectives and understandings as one circulates the work. Pace represented Smith during his final years and following from 1979 – 1983, and this will be the first exhibition dedicated to the artist since the gallery began representing the Tony Smith Estate in 2017. A full color catalogue with an essay by Christopher M. Ketcham will be published in conjunction with the exhibition.\n\nTony Smith\n\nTony Smith considered his process to be intuitive, his work resting close to the unconscious and exploring themes of spirituality and presence in a synthesis of geometric abstraction and expressionism. He studied painting at the Art Students League, New York (1934–36) and attended the New Bauhaus, Chicago (1937–38), before apprenticing with Frank Lloyd Wright (1938–39)\n\nLearn More"
