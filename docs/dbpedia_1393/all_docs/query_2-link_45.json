The theme might inspire art that reflects at subject as literal as the landing of a hot air balloon or bird gliding onto the surface of a lake or as symbolic as arriving home after a long journey or having a cup of tea in front of a cozy fireplace. The show will include a special category of art with the theme “Balloons Over Morgantown,” in celebration of the University Toyota’s Morgantown Balloon Festival.\n\nELIGIBILITY: the exhibit is open to artists who are members or become members of the Morgantown Art Association at the time of the show.
