        "text": "Sculptor, painter and architect Tony Smith was one of the most influential artists of the 20th century. He began his career as an apprentice to well-known architect Frank Lloyd Wright. However, instead of becoming an architect, Smith evolved as an international known sculptor. Smith was born in South Orange. For most of his life, he lived and worked in his home on Stanley Road, located in the Montrose Park section of South Orange. Smith was friends with many prominent artists including Barnett Newman, Jackson Pollock, Mark Rotko and Tennessee Williams, who often visited him at his Montrose Park home and studio.\n\nTau is a black painted steel sculpture measuring 14 feet high, 21 feet wide, and 12 feet deep. Smith created the original model in 1961-1962. As is common with many sculptors, Smith envisioned creating his works in limited editions of three. The first Tau sculpture is located in front of Hunter College in new York City. The second Tau is here in Meadowlands Park, on the slope between the Duck Pond and North Ridgewood Road. It was installed in 2009."
