It can entertain, inform, and even inspire us to consider our own place in the universe,\" writes Yvonne Grzenkowicz. \"Animation is about the study of humanity as much as it is a study of technique. It is about both observation and keyframe. These twelve animated pieces each contain moments of reflection on elements of the human condition while simultaneously sweeping us away with artistry.\" The exhibition featured 2D, 3D, stop-motion, and virtual reality animated films by: Remus Buznea & Kyriaki Kyriakou, United Kingdom; Igor Coric, Serbia; Sashko Danylenko, Ukraine / United States; Nelson Fernandes, Portugal / Spain; Carol Freeman, Ireland; Matisse Gonzalez, Bolivia / Germany; Emily Hubley, United States; Bas Jensen, Netherlands; Joe Loftus, Ireland; Carol Silverman, United States; Rory Waudby-Tolley, United Kingdom; and Jie Weng, China.

Springboards from the familiar to the strange or even occasionally markers of deviation, these genres repeatedly demonstrate that well-used is not well-worn. Each of the artists in New Shapes from Old Tropes utilizes either figuration or landscape as a point of departure to serve their own iconoclastic visual languages. Curated by John Massier, the exhibition featured 13 artists from the Buffalo, New York area: Bruce Adams, Nando Alvarez-Perez, Julia Bottoms, Kyle Butler, A.J. Fries, Pam Glick, George Afedzi Hughes, Richard Huntington, Joan Linder, Margaret Schrecongost, virocode, and Rebecca Wing.\n\nJohn Buck Prints and Sculptures from the Collection of Jordan D. Schnitzer and His Family Foundation\n\nAugust 31 through November 19, 2021\n\nExhibition catalog with essay by Linda Tesner / 15 pages / 14 color plates / design by Jason Dilworth\n\nJohn Buck's powerful imagery, underscored by his unusual printmaking techniques and mastery of wood carving, prompts viewers to consider socio-political issues such as greed, war, sexism, racism, war, environmental degradation, and species extinction. This exhibition featured five sculptures (panels, glass jar, and free-standing) and 27 woodblock prints dating from his first woodblock print in 1980 to 2016. Curated and organized by the Jordan Schnitzer Family Foundation, Portland, OR.\n\nLiving with Art: Selections from the Frederic P. \"Nick\" Norton Collection\n\nMarch 6 through April 11, 2021\n\nFormer Arkwright Town Supervisor and retired attorney Nick Norton caught the collecting bug from his father F.

Participating artists were: Damarys Alvarez, Laylah Amatullah Barrayn, Tau Battice, Cinthya Santos Briones, Yu-Chen Chiu, Anthony Hamboussi,Daesha Harris, Erika Morillo, Danny Peralta, Antonio Pulgarin, Roger Richardson, and Aaron Turner.\n\nWilliam Kentridge: Universal Archive\n\norganized by Gund Gallery, Kenyon College\n\nAugust 18 through October 11, 2020\n\n75 linocuts from the Universal Archive series. The prints began as drawings in India ink, executed using both what the artist calls a “good brush” as well as a “bad brush,” one with damaged bristles that produced less controlled marks. Kentridge, together with master printer Jillian Ross and her team at the David Krut Workshop in Johannesburg, then translated the drawings into linocuts, a technique capable of capturing the fluidity of line in a manner similar to that of drawing.\n\nEmily Mae Smith: Ex Libris\n\nMarch 17 – April 12, 2020\n\nExhibition Catalog with essay by Lucia Love / 26 pages / 20 color plates / design by Jason Dilworth\n\nInternationally renowned artist Emily Mae Smith uses humor and art historical references to comment on current socio-political (especially feminist) issues.

Lenders were Andrea Dezsö and Pucker Gallery, Boston. Curated by Jill Johnson, Associate Professor of Animation and Illustration and Dr. Leesa Rittelmann, Associate Professor of Art History.\n\nSharbani Das Gupta: Out of Step\n\nJanuary 27 – February 26, 2017\n\nBrochure\n\nOut of Step touched on the extraordinary environmental challenges of the moment. On another plane it contained a personal interrogation, examining the inherent paradox of being an artist activist, where the very undertaking of creativity can add to the ecological toll of life. Das Gupta’s large-scale, mixed media and ceramic installation In Hindsight is about manmade dead zones like the floating trash island in the Gulf of Mexico. It was also influenced by the prediction that by 2050 there will be more plastic in the oceans than living creatures. Das Gupta juxtaposed the installation with a series of intimate pieces referencing the many ironies of the Chernobyl disaster zone, irradiated and human free, yet verdant, and full of life.\n\nKahn and Selesnick: Truppe Fledermaus and the Carnival at the End of the World\n\nSeptember 16 through November 18, 2016\n\nExhibition Catalog with essays by Sarah Falkner and Barbara Räcker / 3 accordion fold, 10 panel booklets / 27 color plates / design by Jason Dilworth / Second Prize, Exhibition Catalogues, 2017 AAM Publications Design Competition\n\n75 arched-top, black and white and color photographs dating from 2012 to 2015 and three large format photographs from Dreams of a Drowning World.

Nicholas Kahn and Richard Selesnick are a collaborative artist team who have been working together since they met while attending art school at Washington University in St. Louis in the early 1980s. Both were born in 1964, in New York City and London respectively.
