The flat black planes of steel twist into each other, suggesting an anthropomorphic (or human) form. The title comes from a Samuel Beckett play “Happy Days” (1961), in which the character “Willie” crawls submissively around his wife, who is buried waist deep in mud.\n\nThe painted steel sculpture’s overall dimensions are 91 1/4 × 224 × 135 in., 4000 lb. (231.8 × 569 × 342.9 cm., 1814.4 kg.)\n\nIt is signed on the metal plate on bottom of sculpture: “T. SMITH WILLY 1962 A.P. LIPPINCOTT/ MERRIFIELD-ROBERTS, 2005”"
