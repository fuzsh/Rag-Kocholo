On Wednesday, the Village of South Orange begins installing TAU, an abstract bronze sculpture by famed South Orange native Tony Smith, father of equally famed sculptor Kiki Smith, in Meadowlands Park. Tony Smith was an inspired Minimalist and a good friend of Tennessee Williams, Jackson Pollack and many other luminaries of his day, and his work is still highly prized; he lived and made his art for most of his life in two large houses within blocks of each other in the Oranges. The TAU sculpture, worth about $600,000, was donated by Jane Smith, Tony Smith's widow.

At 4 p.m. Wednesday, the Pierro Foundation will set up a tent in Meadowlands Park with information and merchandise related to the sculpture's installation, cheered on by cider toasts and light refreshments. The TAU project was the brainchild of Lennie Pierro, the late artist, professor and co-founder of the Pierro Gallery in South Orange's Baird Community Center.
