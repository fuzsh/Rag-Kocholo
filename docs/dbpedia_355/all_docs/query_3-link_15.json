        "text": "We can help you become more sustainable\n\nA Corporate Power Purchase Agreement (CPPA) is a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) between a company and a producer for the long-term supply of sustainable energy. A CPPA can be structured in various ways, including directly purchasing the generated energy. Itâ€™s also possible to sign a virtual PPA. With this agreement, the generated energy is sold on the open market and your company receives the financial returns from the sale. We would be happy to discuss which option is most appropriate for your sustainability needs."
