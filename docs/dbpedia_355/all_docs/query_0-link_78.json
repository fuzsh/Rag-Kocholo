        "text": "Energy Management\n\nWe cover all needs to address energy management challenges from a simple low-cost panel meter for standard cabinets through a more complex building or industrial energy automation systems up to the high-end energy and power quality monitoring in harsh smart grid environments. We also develop special meters for DC grids and hybrid AC/DC applications - in distributed generation, data centers, telco, energy storage, transportation etc. The SIMON portable data-loggers are excellent yet affordable tools for temporal power quality and energy management campaigns.\n\nPrecise data from our analyzers serve key role in various ISO 50001 energy management systems.\n\nPower Quality\n\nWe cover all its needs from a simple low-cost panel meter for building management to the high-end power quality analyzers for demanding smart grid applications. We also develop special meters for DC grids and hybrid AC/DC applications - in distributed generation, data centers, telco, energy storage, transportation etc. The SIMON portable data-loggers are excellent yet affordable tools for temporal power quality and energy management campaigns.\n\nTo analyze data in full details all instruments do support the ENVIS application. Remote communications for integration in other automation systems is also available.\n\nSoftware & Data management\n\nENVIS application is the corner stone of our software solutions for desktop with file and database back-ends for data storage. This application can import and export data into many common standards including PQDIF, CSV, XLS etc. Additionally we also offer open access to the data through libraries (for .NET core or C/C++) and command line tools which can be used for easy adoption by 3rd party software developers for an easy integration of our data.\n\nENVIS.Online system service can manage given set of instruments on the background automatically without need of user interactions. It can obtain, analyze and report the data automatically."
