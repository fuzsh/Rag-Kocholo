        "text": "Enerfrog Building Automation Systems included industry proven energy saving strategies such as Demand Control Ventilation, Outdoor Reset Calculations and Outdoor Air Optimization. In addition to this we have designed systems for ease of remote monitoring and triage which reduces troubleshooting time and increases efficiency of the on-site technicians. We also offer solutions for retrofits and small businesses where a full building automation system may not be required.\n\nIn addition to fielding complex building automation and HVAC related issues, our service specialists are available to field facility maintenance calls. This offers our customers the benefit of technically trained support staff who know the proper questions to ask, and provides site managers with peace of mind that their issues are being handled by qualified personnel, not call center staff. A single point of contact for all facility related issues, allows our customers to concentrate on operating their business with the confidence that Enerfrog will handle all their facility needs. Enerfrog will take ownership of each call by dispatching the site's preferred vendors and liaising information between the vendors and the site contact to ensure that all parties are fully informed of the situation and steps to resolution.\n\nWhen Remote Resolution of site issues is not possible, the siteâ€™s preferred vendors can be dispatched and tracked to ensure swift, cost effective, resolution of HVAC and Automation issues. Our Technicians can assist on-site HVAC and Electrical Technicians to reduce troubleshooting time and ensure quick, accurate resolution of HVAC and Controls related issues without the need to send Automation Technicians to site.\n\nLegacy building automation technologies and IOT are still in use across the industry. While these tools offer great performance, integrating and building data pipelines remain a challenge. This creates roadblocks for teams that wish to leverage their data for real-time monitoring, decision and policy making. At Enerfrog we are able to provide custom data analytics platform and APIs that will integrate with your existing systems, allowing you to seamlessly process and analyze your data."
