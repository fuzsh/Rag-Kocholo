        "text": "Do you want to be the boss of your own energy? With solar panels on your company roof, you can. 100% sustainable electricity is financially attractive, reliable and contributes to a sustainable Netherlands. Novar makes the sun work for you. We realize large-scale solar projects on company roofs. So that you can do business sustainably.\n\nLooking at the long term, there are no costs associated with solar panels on your business premises. The costs that may be incurred depend very much on whether or not you, the roof owner, choose to invest. If you choose to rent out your roof, there are no costs associated with solar panels on your roof. What's more, your roof actually generates income. When you choose to invest in a solar roof, you obviously incur investment costs. But thanks, among other things, to subsidy schemes, you will earn this back and in the long run your solar roof will generate money.\n\nThe cost of solar panels for a business varies greatly. They depend on the type of panel chosen, the quantity of panels purchased and the lot from which they are purchased. There are three types of panels:\n\nMonocrystalline solar panels: they have the highest efficiency, but they are also the most expensive.\n\nPolycrystalline solar panels: the difference in efficiency between polycrystalline and monocrystalline solar panels runs to several percent.\n\nAmorphous solar panels: this type of solar panel is the cheapest due to low production costs, but also has the lowest efficiency.\n\nEfficiency versus yield is thus an important consideration for a solar roof. The final choice and cost are therefore different for each project.\n\nAt Novar, we offer several options for solar panels business. For example, it is also possible to rent out your company roof. You rent your roof to Novar and we turn it into a solar roof. You will be completely relieved of all your worries. Technical problems or maintenance? Novar is ready to take care of everything for you. Renting out your company roof to Novar can therefore be very interesting.\n\nIn addition to commercial roofs on industrial sites, large roofs are commonly found in the agricultural sector. Think of large stables, barns and greenhouses. These areas are also extremely suitable for generating sustainable solar energy. This makes a solar roof ideal for farmers. Thus, a farmer becomes not only an important supplier of our food, but also of our solar energy! A farm with 3,500 m2 of roof area can supply about 140 households with electricity for a year. The Netherlands has many agricultural roofs on which solar panels have already been installed. A picture that is also becoming more and more accepted in our Dutch landscape. But, that is now only a small percentage of all agricultural roofs. Therein lies an opportunity.\n\nDo you actually have land available for solar panels? Then a solar park is just the right thing to do!\n\nIf your roof is not suitable for solar panels, it is almost always possible to make it suitable. Together we look for solutions to realize a solar roof. For example, by adapting the roof structure so that it can support a solar system. Or by looking for a creative solution to connect to the energy grid. We think in terms of solutions and are happy to work with you.\n\nThe yield of a solar roof, depends on the choices you make and the space you have. For example, will you rent out a roof for solar panels or invest in your own solar project? At Novar, there are several options for a solar roof at a minimum area of 3,000 m². Here's a calculation example: Do you rent out a roof of 3,000 m²? Then you will receive +/- €4,500 per year. After 16 years you will have earned €72,000. Wondering how much you can earn with your company roof? Schedule a no-obligation consultation.\n\nIn addition, a solar roof also provides (indirect) marketing revenue. As a result of a \"green\" appearance. Are you a landlord? Then you increase the attractiveness of the property for existing and future tenants.\n\nThe efficiency of your solar roof depends on several factors. Owning your solar roof means maximum returns. But also more risk and a lot of self-regulation. When renting out the roof, the return is lower, but so are the risks, the own investment and the worries. In addition, a combination is also a possibility.\n\nFurthermore, the efficiency of your solar roof depends on the business case that can be made: how many panels can be put on the roof, how many hours of sunshine your roof has, etc. Solar energy is a profitable source of energy that has a high degree of financial security, thanks in part to the SDE subsidy.\n\nNo, usually no permit is needed to install solar panels on a roof. Very occasionally this is required because a solar roof then does not fit into the zoning plan. This may be the case with monuments or protected cityscapes, for example. Through the Omgevingsloket you can do a permit check for placing solar panels. Or read more in the leaflet Solar collectors and solar panels.\n\nA solar roof doesn't have to cost anything. In fact, a solar roof makes money. Here you can choose several options.\n\nIf you choose to rent or lease your roof, no investment of your own is required. We take care of the installation and maintenance of the solar panels. You receive the returns and run no risk of your own. Do you want a higher return? Then you can choose to invest in your own solar roof, in which case we can also co-finance. It is also possible to choose a combination.\n\nDepending on your needs, we look for a mutually beneficial collaboration.\n\nWith every solar roof application, we first do a feasibility study. There we look at various factors such as obstacles on the roof. Our technical designer calculates the net roof area and the most ideal arrangement for the solar roof to determine the solar yield. In addition, the roof structure and roof covering are also assessed by an independent engineering firm. Connection to the grid is of course also important, this is looked at by our grid specialists.\n\nDo! Of course you want the highest possible return on your (business) property. With a roof full of solar panels, you benefit doubly. The extra income ensures a healthy future for your company, the substantial CO2 reduction and the generation of green electricity provides a healthy future for our planet. So making your roof available for solar panels is a good idea."
