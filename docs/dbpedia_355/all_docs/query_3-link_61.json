        "text": "Your challenge\n\nThe idea is simple. As residents and entrepreneurs, you want sustainable, reliable, affordable energy. Locally generated, for local use. That’s why you took action. So you can decide how to generate green energy and benefit from the proceeds.\n\nBut where do you go from here? Energy prices are fluctuating, energy system technology is rapidly developing and government policies are changing. This raises questions: Is investing in a battery a smart decision? Which legislation is changing? Can we improve yields and therefore the returns for the environment? Smart management is the solution. Klaer supports energy cooperatives down to the last detail. With professional management services and green energy system optimisation. We contribute technical knowledge. We also provide support with participation, tax legislation, subsidy schemes and access to energy markets. That’s why you team up with Klaer.\n\nWhat we do\n\nWe have around twenty years’ experience in managing green energy systems: solar and wind installations and storage systems such as batteries. We now manage over 800 MWp of capacity in the Netherlands and we know all there is to know about operating energy solutions.\n\nFor energy cooperatives, this starts by actively involving local residents and stakeholders in the issues that arise. Those issues may relate to your system management, from letting sheep graze and organising tours to optimising the installation settings. We ensure that your cooperative and the energy system both get the attention they deserve. After all, we believe in the power of cooperatives: initiatives close to home that make the world more sustainable and benefit the environment."
