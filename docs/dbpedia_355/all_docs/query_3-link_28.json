        "text": "Operations and Maintenance\n\nWe provide full-service maintenance with a dedicated staff to ensure on-going system maintenance and quick repair. We also specialize in servicing air conditioning systems, including AC repair and maintenance in North Texas.\n\nMany large commercial businesses have more budgeted for their landscaping needs than for something as crucial as air conditioning for their customers and employees, but we offer competitive pricing.\n\nWe also offer service and maintenance contracts. Each contract is specific for the location and the amount of HVAC equipment and can be modified for the specific needs of the customer, whether annual, bi-annual, or quarterly visits are required. Most importantly, regular maintenance allows us to provide a financial heads-up for budget-conscious business owners and managers while assuring priority service in times of heavy call volume.\n\nDuctless Mini-Split Systems\n\nWhether you have a single uncomfortable room, you’re renovating your entire house, building a home from scratch or need to modify a small commercial space, Mitsubishi Electric has a Zoned Comfort Solution® that fits your unique needs.\n\nBecause our systems focus on individual living / working spaces rather than treating every room the same, it’s more customizable, more energy efficient and easier to install.\n\nNTM Services, Inc. provides professional repairs, maintenance, and installation of commercial air conditioning and heating systems in North Fort Worth, Southlake, Keller, and throughout North Texas. We're also energy-management and power-washing professionals for all your commercial needs.\n\nFilter Sales\n\nWe offer custom, special order, regular and high efficiency filters at great prices. We can typically beat most big retailers and home improvement stores.\n\nDuct Work\n\nWe install custom duct work including DuctSox, Rigid and Flexible duct work in many applications.\n\nSystems Design and Project Management\n\nHi. Do you need any help?\n\nClose\n\nShare On:\n\nWe specialize in retrofitting older buildings with new heating and cooling systems and can monitor several different energy management control systems. We're equipped to manage the maintenance of HVAC related equipment in many different states.\n\nControls\n\nWe have experience working with many different energy management and control systems, including Tracer Summit, Tracer 100, Novar, Honeywell, Niagara platform-based systems, BacNet controllers, and others.\n\nWe can monitor from our office almost any Niagara Platform system, Tracer Summit, Tracer 100, and Novar/Iscope control systems. Contracts for monitoring are available.\n\nPower Washing\n\nOur power washing equipment is equipped to safely handle cleaning coils, as well as having the ability to heat water that allows us to clean without chemicals in most cases.
