        "text": "In May 1999 we started AutomatedBuildings.com\n\nSince 1999 AutomatedBuildings.com has been an on line magazine and web resource. We provide the news and connection to the community of change agents that are creating our present definition of smart, intelligent, integrated, connected, green, and converged large buildings. Our virtual magazine and web resource provides a searchable platform for discussion and exchange while creating opportunities for B2B for all new and existing stakeholders.;xNLx;;xNLx;We hope you will enjoy this new fresh way to fly through time in 2D or 3D to quickly get to our great quantity of valuable information\n\nSearch AutomatedBuildings.com\n\nThe Google powered AutomatedBuildings.com Site Search Engines will search our web site's wealth of information accumulated as an on line magazine and web resource since 1999.\n\nClient Comfort System ( CSS )\n\nI find it interesting that our shift early in the DDC industry from the name Energy Management Control System ( EMCS ) to Client Comfort System ( CSS ) in the early 1990 with this documents still online was a harbinger of acknowledging the important of the client satisfaction connection. It is amazing that this game changing document is still online this was what Jane and I were doing with our day job 5 years before the start of AutomatedBuildings.com http://www.accommodationandrealestate.gov.bc.ca/Doing_Business_With_Us/Technical_Manuals/files/ccs/index.html button In those days we often joked about the \"Make Me Happy Button\" an important input from the field to let us know that our clients were not happy this of course was long before smart phones and social media. In those days we had no method of communicating with the happiness of the measured variable of our process our client.\n\nBefore AutomatedBuildings.com\n\nWhat does the author know about facility operation? Most Engineered System readers know me from my monthly Building Automation Columns and my online internet readers know me as the Editor/Owner of AutomatedBuildings.com but before doing either of these I spent over 35 years in the industry optimizing operating procedures in existing facilities and large buildings. Johnson Controls in Milwaukee originally trained me as a service/sales engineer. I left my post of service manager with JCI to operate several buildings for a local developer. After that I accepted a contract position as the Assistance Energy Analyst for the Province of Alberta. This gave me exposure to the new and exciting world of computer simulated energy performance, although the program did run on paper cards on a mainframe computer in Ottawa over a very slow modem. For over 25 of these 35 years I operated as Sinclair Energy Services Ltd providing energy simulations, conservation, and automation consulting for existing large buildings in Western Canada. While working on a computer simulation for a 60-acre solar heated bubble that was to bring a mild environment to a northern Alberta town for both for the construction and finished town-site Don Holte of Nova Engineering taught me that the scope and approach to environment control engineering was unlimited. Don went on to be the International President of ASHRAE. Several of my industry mentors share a good understanding of computerized large building simulation principles. I started Sinclair Energy Services Ltd to do computer simulations, energy conservation, as well as identifying computerized controls related opportunities in large existing buildings. The University of Alberta (U of A) started a total Direct Digital Control system in 1975. I was lucky to be part of this project that was installing large campus buildings with only total DDC without any conventional controls. The computers were as big as refrigerators, and we had a system analyst and a team of code monkeys, plus we had to create and build most of our own software and sensors as most had not been invented yet or were too costly. Being part of the team that created these extremely interesting leading edge systems spawned many life mentors for me. I was amazed at the quantity and variety of people required to build what had not been built before. This project and associated mechanical/lighting energy conservation projects for over 15 million square feet of facility helped me gain insight into large complex operations. A central chilled water plant with over 15,000 tons of cooling and miles of distribution allowed us to hone our hydraulic skills and let the DDC system prove us wrong or right. In the early 1980s, I moved to Vancouver Island and Sinclair Energy Services Ltd started providing similar services for the British Columbia Buildings Corporation that then had over 22 million square feet of space in over 700 buildings. The DDC revolution had begun and it was centred on the lower BC Mainland and Vancouver Island. Most of our energy studies on existing buildings ended in the retrofit of the existing controls to the new DDC systems. Working with the industry to make the new DDC as powerful and flexible as possible further increased my team of industry mentors. I still had time to be a founding member and a President of both the local chapter of AEE and the Vancouver Island Chapter of ASHRAE. I was fortunate to be on the teams that won the ASHRAE international energy award for existing buildings Robson Square for BCBC and Vancouver Art Gallery for City of Vancouver and several AEE energy awards, plus local BC Hydro Power Smart awards. Sinclair Energy Services worked with the local utility BC Hydro \"Power Smart Program\" which allowed us to identify, document, and oversee the implementing of many million dollars of energy conservation projects. Several clients as well as several large hospitals allowed us more insight into special application projects. All of our work was done in existing facilities and buildings and the identification of these operational opportunities gave me insight into the existing operation team. In all our projects, much of our time was spent retrofitting, rebuilding and training building operators to the point that we created a High Performance Building Operator's Course. I wish that the Web had been invented so we could share this with you now. It included the essence of room load calculation, building simulation, thermo and energy analysis of various types of air handling type, control strategy development, power optimization, and more. The best part was the creation of a personnel network of high performance operators that could share ideas and help each other solve problems. I hope to achieve the rekindling of this valuable network of super operators online\n\nStarted AutomatedBuildings.com\n\nStarted web creation in May first issue was online July Since 1999 AutomatedBuildings.com has been an on line magazine and web resource. We provide the news and connection to the community of change agents that are creating our present definition of smart, intelligent, integrated, connected, green, and converged large buildings Our Mission as originally set in July 1999 \"To Become Your Resource for Internet Information on Automated Buildings.\" The evolution of Automated Buildings has reached revolutionary status. The revolution has been caused by the standardization of communication protocols such as BACnet, LonTalk, Web Based control, and the wide use of the Internet and Intranets. As technologies converge and our clients' expectations are fueled by the ease of access and freedom of information on the Net, our only weapon is to be informed. We will encompass environmental control, energy metering/accounting systems, lighting control, life safety/fire, security, communications, high tech tools, web resources, and interactive information systems. Automated Buildings wants to discover the who, what, where, when and why of this fascinating field. Please subscribe to our monthly updates and share this resource by having all of your automated buildings stakeholders subscribe. The monthly updates are free and will help keep us all informed as revolution gives way to rapid evolution into the millenium. â¢How is the automated building systems industry using the power of the internet, intranet to evolve their products? â¢How are the evolving standards such as BACnet, LonTalk progressing? â¢How will networking change our approach to automated building systems? â¢What new sensor products are likely to make a significant change? â¢What training and shareware resources exist? â¢Existing operating building systems will be discussed, both their successes and failures. The names given to building automation systems are varied: â¢Building Automation Systems or BAS â¢Building Management Systems or BMS â¢Facility Management Systems or FMS â¢Energy Management Systems or EMS â¢Energy Management Control Systems or EMCS â¢Client Comfort System or CCS plus many more. We will group and provide connection to all of these plus lighting control companies, fire / life safety, security, the sensor, actuation, and end device industry and anything else that is now becoming part of an automated building system. Why we did it. The editors of AutomatedBuildings.com have run a successful automation and energy conservation consulting firm for large commercial buildings over the last 25 years. Our involvement with the industry, our clients, organizations such as ASHRAE, AEE, etc has given us some insight into the large building automation industry. Much of our lives has been dedicated to keeping up with technological changes, but never has the pressure to keep up with the concepts now changing our industry been more important. Emerging communication standards, building systems evolution to common networks, the internet itself as a control system, these rapid communications of change are spinning the industry at an incredible rate. Although the net is an incredible resource, it has been described as a library with all the books on the floor. Mining the net for useful information and creating virtual relationships with the industry is slow work. Once the information is gathered as a special interest resource it can greatly increase the productivity of an industry and propel it forward, but only if the industry embraces and helps the resource grow. Spurred on by the success of our friends Bob and Brenda Hetherington of HomeToys.com and their pulling together of the home automation industry we have started AutomatedBuildings.com to provide a similar service for commercial and industrial automated buildings. Our relationship allows us access to their mentoring and internet experience. We feel that their resources will allow us significant leverage to bring your AutomatedBuildings.com resource to you in as short a time as possible. We hope you like what we are doing. If you do, \"tell a colleague in the industry\". If you do not like what we are doing or know of a better way for us to achieve our goals tell us via email and we will try to incorporate your suggestions in our site. AutomatedBuildings.com is intended to be an interactive process to bind our industry. I wish us all luck in the development of your resource AutomatedBuildings.com. Ken and Jane Sinclair\n\nJuly August\n\nIt has been a fun filled few months since the start of AutomatedBuildings.com. We are suffering a little bit of vertigo from the learning curve but the industry support has been great. A special thanks to all our subscribers.

Presented By: Ken Sinclair, Editor, AutomatedBuildings.com David J. Branson, Sr VP, Compliance Services Group, Inc. December Update includes a new feature - our Web Site Map located on the home page, plus a rework of your favourite resource our link library. The large number of links was becoming an issue to download for readers using low speed access. The link library has been restructured into four sections with an index page. The smaller segments load much faster and allow us the ability to expand this service. Several new sections have also been added: Independent Automation Representatives, Component & Product Distributors, Commissioning & Optimization Providers, and Network Service Providers. A new library resource Acronyms & Definitions has also been added to help you keep current with all the annoying acronyms that we must learn to understand our future. Please send us more as you find them. New links have been added to our Link Library so check out their services. News for November - California here I come! Editor Ken Sinclair has been invited to be the guest speaker at the joint meeting of the Golden Gate and San Jose ASHRAE Chapters, Dec 2nd at the San Mateo Marriott. I welcome this opportunity to share my thoughts with the two ASHRAE Chapters that conduct their business in the center of the Internet industry for America. My topic is: Are Automated Buildings Converging or Colliding with the Internet? Please help me present the actual facts by sharing your views and/or late breaking concepts. Email sinclair@automatedbuildings.com or call 250-656-5378 , Pacific Standard Time. Your input will be reflected in my presentation. It would be great if you could come out and join us at this ASHRAE joint chapter meeting. Contact the local Chapters for details. http://www.ggashrae.org/calendr.htm It is also timely that the November issue of our online Ezine \"The Automator\" has the theme \"How the Web is Changing Our Industry\". Several great industry articles on this subject are now online. This issue's cartoon pokes fun at a serious concern, the digital haves and have nots in our industry. As part of the industry embraces the information revolution and our convergence, another part is attempting to carry on business as it did in the past, ignoring the signs of change. Our industry is too small to be divided; reach out and help someone who is struggling with the rapid technological changes we must all go through.\n\nJanuary February\n\nCheck out our February 2000 Press Releases, News Briefs and New Products.

Check out this new service. We welcome our four new sponsors Echelon, Coactive, Strategic Resource Solutions and ControlShop. Please check out their sites as our sponsors allow us to bring this online magazine and resource to you free. We are assembling an index with dynamic linking to all industry e-com sites to be part of our May issue. Please advise us of any electronic commerce sites you are aware of. e-com@automatedbuildings.com Our March site traffic has increased approximately 25% over February Thanks for your help getting us known in the industry. April's update has new links, press releases, new products and news briefs. See the two new categories in the Link Library - Flow & Pressure Measurement, and Health & Safety - IAQ.\n\nMay June\n\nTheme \"Our Web Communities\" June Update Lots of new products, press releases and new links are included in our June update. We already have articles for our July Anniversary issue. We have room for lots more and the theme of \"A Year of Rapid Change\" allows any topic to be included. We are working hard to give your automation web site a face lift and overall tune up to help us celebrate our first anniversary so please joint us with your input. Your editor is speaking at Mindware2000, Circon's Second Annual Partner Conference. My topic is \"The Net Effect\" which will include quotations from articles by industry leaders on their perceptions of the value of the Internet. I will discuss the goals of interoperability and the value of standards; a topic I am sure most Circon Partners know more about than me. I will also talk about the rapid growth and acceptance of the net by our automation industry, discuss examples of the total integration of the web and automated buildings and talk about convergence and whether it might consume or save us. I will close with some observed trends in eCommerce and Concept Contracting. I look forward to a lively discussion after. I welcome opportunities such as this to liaison with the industry as it greatly increases my understanding and provides new directions and valuable feedback on how to improve our automated buildings web resource. A special thanks to all those industry leaders that have shared our web address with their employees/associates and/or made us part of their web site as an active link. We are working hard to become your industry portal and web resource and we greatly appreciate your support. Your industry \"B2B\" web resource AutomatedBuildings.com is rapidly evolving. One year ago, or 4 net years ago, when we first started our online magazine and web resource we envisioned that we would be an \"B2B\" (Business to Business) website, but we thought of it more in the traditional sense such as control vendor to building owners. Rapid evolution fed by the tremendous change and effect of the net on the industry has us providing information for connecting network vendors with control vendors, net based software providers with vendors, contractors, and building owners and everyone with the rapidly evolving communication and web standards. When you review this month's new web resource Industry eCommerce Directory for the Automated Buildings Industry also look at our review of Ten Observed Trends in eCom for the Building Automation Industry. I think you too will be amazed at the rapid growth and acceptance of the web as an eCommerce tool for our industry. It is obvious that B2B eCom will change forever how our industry does business with itself. Will this rapid B2B revolution spread to the way we do business with building owners? Will bundling of our products and services evolve to packages that will be suitable for eCommerce to the building industry? Will controls and automation become an integral part and supplied building subsystems? Keep your bookmark set on AutomatedBuildings.com for the answers to this and other rapid industry changes. We do not know what is going to happen, but we will tell you as soon as we do. Navigation Tip Some sites that we link to have chosen to do a redirect when you click on the back button. This means you cannot get out of this site with your back button unless you double click quickly. We find this most annoying as it defeats standard internet navigation. Our Contractor Corner link has been well received. Do you have information you would like to share with this special interest group? Let us know and we will be sure they get the message. We are presently emailing to 2000 plus contractors. The ability to create virtual space for special interest groups in our industry is one of the luxuries of the a web based magazine. We are considering creating a Lifestyle Library, with corporate successes of improving lifestyles and a Designers Den with resources and links for designers. Let us know if you think these would be of use to you. Our July 2000 Issue will be our First Anniversary Issue. Our Theme will be \"A Year of Rapid Change\". Please share your thoughts with our readership.\n\nJuly August\n\nOur August update in now on line with new products and August's news releases. A new section has been added under our About button called Reader Profile and it outlines who reads AutomatedBuildings.com. From our July anniversary issue - It has been a year of not having time for the wet paint to dry before we move on to our next evolutionary step. This month's editorial/article \"A Year of Rapid Change\" or The Metamorphosis of a Digital Dinosaur provides an insight into who we are plus a quick review of our first year as AutomatedBuildings.com. I feel we all must be going through a metamorphosis of some type to get our minds around the changes that are occurring in our industry. I am convinced that reading and talking about these changes is the quickest path to understanding. By now you have probably noticed the changes in our web site look. These include new top menu artwork with \"mouse overs\" to improve understanding of the function of each button, plus a more interactive home page to quickly guide you to the sections of our portal that interest you the most. The rework was necessary to keep with the professional articles, and material sent to us by our contributors. The evolution to \"Your Global Automation Portal\" surprised us as it seems that several of our readers reached this conclusion before we did. We have several international articles and links so take a global look at our industry and what is happening in other parts of the world, as it may affect you more than you think. As usual this issue has lots of new products, press releases, new links and great articles that expand on our theme. We welcome back good friend Tom Hartman with a new provocative article The \"COMFORT INDUSTRY\" a 21st Century Opportunity . Tom gave us one of our first articles \"Network Control\" one year ago. His January article Essay on Change was also extremely well received. Tom's articles are consistently among the \"top reads\". Your editor enjoyed the opportunity of making a presentation at Mindware2000, Circon's Second Annual Partner Conference. It was great to observe the excitement and enthusiasm that was in the air with this dynamic team of system integrators. I welcome opportunities such as this to liaison with the industry as it greatly increases my understanding and provides new directions and valuable feedback on how to improve our automated buildings web resource. A special thanks to all those industry leaders that have shared our web address with their employees/associates and/or made us part of their web site as an active link. We are working hard at being your industry portal and web resource and appreciate your support. Please review our web resource Industry eCommerce Directory for the Automated Buildings Industry and I think you too will be amazed at the rapid growth and acceptance of the web as an eCommerce tool. Keep your bookmarks set on us we do not know what is going to happen next month, but we will tell you as soon as we do.\n\nSeptember October\n\nPrepared for the Net Effect? Here is an example Europe's leading research and consultancy company specialising in intelligent systems in buildings advises us that the North American Controls Market could double. The global interest and capabilities are amazing and if we are not in touch with our local markets, global interests are. \"State-of-the-Art Capabilities in Building Automation\" AHR Expo Atlanta Jan 2001 - Show Sponsored Sessions.

David J Branson, PE, CSG Communications â¢HVAC University One key area of the program that assists students with HVAC systems concepts is a systems \"Help\" file which gives the students a basic understanding of HVAC components and systems design. Joseph V. Simmons, Van Boerum & Frank Associates â¢\"Demand-Controlled Ventilation\" (DCV) and Intake Rate Control First, let's get one simple truth out of the way. There is no direct relationship between interior CO2 levels and intake rates. Len Damiano, EBTRON Inc â¢Pressure Measurement Improves Air Quality There is a misconception that the reason buildings require ventilation is to supply outdoor air so people can breathe oxygen. Diane Shaughnessy, Setra â¢Computer Based Training or CBT, is an effective and efficient form of education for most anyone. CBT is simply a CD-ROM that a student can use whenever and wherever they choose.

Interviews section added. Read what industry experts are saying about current automation issues. If you would like to be part of this new interactive media contact us. Automated Building Systems eDucation The rapid changing Automated Building industry has always required that all players be constantly re-educating themselves to keep current, but never has there been a time when this is so important. Industry advertising/sponsorship is an important part of AutomatedBuildings.com overall content as it allows us to provide our services free. To keep our Global Automation presence very focused, we approach only industry building automation players as sponsors and advertisers. In this way we eliminate the amount of non-related information presented to you. The Business to Business or B2B within the Building Automation Industry that occurs on our web site is becoming as important to our industry presence as \"The Large Building Automation Online Resource\".\n\nSeptember October\n\nOur October issue adds to the restructuring theme with an interview about selling new automation concepts. Our October Headlines also provide a definition of the potential markets. We feel that our readers interest in this area is increasing and we will provide more information on marketing in the future. The Building Automation industry is presently undergoing major restructuring including a complete reconstruction of the existing control procurement process and methods of doing business. Many players in our industry feel that only minor changes are occurring, however today's restructuring will change who we are and whom we work for. Please read our articles on Industry Restructuring and feedback your comments. More on \"Proto-calling\" Protocol wars rage on; John James, Vice President Products Group, Cimetrics Inc responds to Rehan Kamal, IT Strategist, Computrols comment \"Today's BAS standards like BACnet and LonWorks will go the way of BetaMax and Quadraphonic sound\" with \"This is an \"apples & oranges\" comparison. BACnet objects and LonMark profiles are examples of Application-Layer standards and TCP/IP is a Transport, or Data-Link Layer standard.\" Read the Interviews Our new interview section seems to provide the vehicle for industry leaders to quickly share their views with us.

It is important that our solutions seamlessly mesh with the IT industry, but it is even more important as an industry that we control the content and interaction of our information model or models. This article by Eric and Dave provided the corner stone of our web services forum.\n\nJanuary February\n\nWhenever I talk to my friends in the industry and ask \"How can I make AutomatedBuildings.com better?\" the quip is \"more pictures of pretty girls\". So for those guys here it is, a picture of crusty the consultant turned editor with Katie Harmon, Miss America 2002. The AHR Expo was a great event exceeding all expectations by attracting 28,513 visitors from around the world. See my review of this event in this issue. Last month's most requested article Information Model: The Key to Integration and most requested Interview \"Open\" Building Control Systems plus feedback and encouragement at the AHR Expo spurred us to create our Online Forum for an Industry Web Services Information Model. At the AHR Expo this year there was a lot of interest in the application of evolving web services as a higher level of communication integration for our industry. We have created a first cut at an online forum to help inform the industry, and speed evolution of a Industry Web Services Information Model. Please review our first cut which includes Guidelines, Probable Industry Applications, an Industry Call to Action, plus valuable links to Known Resources. http://www.automatedbuildings.com/webservices.htm Please provide your input, both positive and negative. Control Solutions, Inc What are Web Services? IBM says, \"Web services are self-contained, modular applications that can be described, published, located, and invoked over a network, generally, the World Wide Web.\" Microsoft's description is more succinct, \"a Web service is programmable application logic, accessible using standard Internet protocols,\" Others define Web services as a business logic or information made available using the XML (Extensible Mark-up Language)-based SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol).\n\nMarch April\n\nOur April issue brings several firsts for AutomatedBuildings.com. Our first venture into providing connection to industry experts who can provide online training courses for our industry. Please check out this new section and provide us your feedback. http://automatedbuildings.com/online/ Our second first is the monthly generation of articles. Up to now we have only published articles every two months, but the constant flow of excellent industry timely information has caused us to change our format to publish monthly. Special thanks to our content contributors. Before our online web magazine our industry would have to wait six months to one year to get the correct printed magazine theme to publish building automation information. Now holding relevant information for a month seems a crime. I hope you like this new format as it will allow a more even flow of reading information to you our busy readers. New interviews in this issue on Online training and our March/April theme \"Making Our Own Markets\". Read the interviews and articles and imagine between the lines how you could use these concepts to grow your markets.\n\nMay June\n\nOur June issue includes the introduction of our Online Forum for Web Based Facilities Operation. We are excited about this trend in large building automation as it builds on most of the principles presented by our magazine. Next month we will start our fourth year of operation as AutomatedBuildings.com. It has been an amazing journey from a beginning of \"You are going to do what?\" to an acceptance by the industry as a valuable and growing resource. We thank Edward H. Brzezowski of Facility Energy Services for some of the key components we used from his original graphic for our composite graphic. Ed has a great web site with much insight into Web Based Facilities Operation. Check it out at http://www.fes-nj.com. Here is Ed's original graphic which provides a great overview http://www.fes-nj.com/FacTechEduc/ModularAVDigitalConnectivity.gif. June and May issues feature many articles and reviews on the Trends in Intelligent Buildings. Be sure to check out these valuable resources. Our first venture in online training has been positive with Jack reporting back; \"The first Automatedbuildings.com Seminar is in full swing, and the list of participants is quite impressive. It is a true international venue, based through the Web Portal in Canada, and providing timely information to a group of end users, contractors and OEM's from the United States, Canada, Europe and Southeast Asia. As the image implies this seminar is linking building automation professionals on a global basis with a forum for learning and exploration of building automation and open systems.\" Please check out this new section and provide us your feedback. http://automatedbuildings.com/online/\n\nJuly August\n\nOur theme is \"Getting to There from Here\" and explores the problems applying new concepts in our industry. The bringing online of the August issue is a good example of \"Getting to There from Here\" as it was assembled and downloaded from our sailboat called \"Emoticon :)\" named after those Emotional Icons that we use to give our emails life :) Finding a good cell phone signal for modem connection in the towering mountains around the sounds and fjords of the northern BC coast was a challenge, but finally a sandy spit on a small island in open water insight of Desolation Sound allowed us our ideal \"Here\" to project ourselves \"There\". The message is that there is freedom in today's technology, explore it and find how it can work for you. The August issue features our joint venture with Engineered Systems Magazine a Pullout Supplement for their August Issue Web Based Facilities Operations Guide. Doing more with less by using Web-based anywhere information to amplify your existing building operational resources. We were pleased to have the opportunity to share our thoughts on this exciting new area of Facility Operation in print with Engineered Systems readers. We have provided the complete supplement online with links to several related articles. Check it out We welcome our online instructor's Frank Miraglia's first article Does Size Really Matter? We got feedback this month and have brought back our letters to editor. We feel that this is an important section of our online magazine as it lets you express how you feel about the information we are presenting. This issue marks the start of our fourth year of operation as AutomatedBuildings.com. These four years have included a lot of \"Getting to There from Here\", but the changes and transitions are nowhere complete and the task continues at an increased pace. The slow adopters are starting to panic and are generally working at a feverish pace to catch up. Few believe that the web will not be part of their future. AutomatedBuildings.com has housed much of the information generated in the last four years, sometimes even being the catalyst that spurred everyone on. We thank the industry for allowing us to provide this valuable service Enter story info here\n\nSeptember October\n\nI am often asked, \"Who is driving the web integration that is presently revolutionizing our industry?\" The answer is \"We the people of the large building automation industry\". This article provides insight to our theme for October of \"Web Based Facilities Operations\" and builds on the significant amount of information that we have assembled on this subject in the past. I am off to LonWorld at the end of October http://www.lonworldexpo.com/ in Toronto to be part of a panel including Surf Networks, AutomatedBuildings.com, CABA, and Echelon to discuss how the latest trends in building automation such as sustainability/green design and independent commissioning agents influence the lives and businesses of building owners, integrators, facility managers, tenants, consulting engineers, and OEMs. The most read article for the month of August was our joint venture with Engineered Systems Magazine a Web Based Facilities Operations Guide.

December is our AHR Expo preview issue and we will be publishing information as we receive it to keep you informed. Please check out our AHR Product Preview. Every month AutomatedBuildings.com passes a new milestone or becomes involved in a new way with our industry. This seems to be a banner month and we have reason for celebration as the November logo indicates. Here is a brief summary. Growth: Our circulation for October measured by monthly served sessions and by unique IP addresses served is 1000 to 1500 higher than last month suggesting that we will come close to or exceed serving 30,000 sessions this month. If the average user session remains at 12 minutes that is over 6000 hours a month of online communication with our industry. It has been an amazing four years since the start of AutomatedBuildings.com. Our first International Advertiser is North Communications Limited. The UK's leading manufacturer of integration products and supervisory display systems for building services control and monitoring. LonWorld, Toronto I am part of a panel on October 31st discussing New Trends in Building Automation. This panel will address how trends in building automation influence the lives and businesses of building owners, integrators, facility managers, tenants, consulting engineers, and OEMs. AHR Expo 2003 Chicago Our fourth year at providing FREE Show Sponsored Sessions An Endorsing Publication of CABA's Intelligent & Integrated Buildings Conference. Sponsor and content provider for BuilConn who brings together manufacturers, distributors, integrators, contractors and dealers in the security and HVAC industries â To learn about and discuss technical and relevant issues. Supporting Publication for Net-atHome(tm)2002 Cannes Mandelieu, French Riviera, Nov 13-15 Media Sponsor for LonMark Interoperability Association Fall 2002 General Meeting: Monthly Building Automation Column since August 2000 for Engineered Systems has allowed us to share the excellent online content of AutomatedBuildings.com plus my ideas with the print reading world. We are now planning âThe Sequelâ to our AutomatedBuildings.com and Engineered Systems' joint venture \"Web Based Facilities Operations Guide\". This was the supplement to Engineered Systems' August 2002 issue. Controlling Convergence is scheduled for the Engineered Systems' April 2003 issue. KMC Controls In addition to the above, I have again re-emerged as a Consultant operating as Sinclair Energy Services Ltd on an over 1 million square foot project. I have been challenged with the task of taking my web based operations ramblings and making them into reality. It is a fun project and appears to be easier than I thought as vendors have made great progress in providing us web interfaces. Nov 2002 our theme is \"Online Training: A Viable Option?\" and discusses the industry's dependence on the web for training. We have received a wealth of articles and interviews. AutomatedBuildings.com has housed much of the information generated in the last four years, sometimes even being the catalyst that spurred everyone on. We thank the industry for allowing us to provide this valuable service. Be sure to read our articles plus our archived articles and interviews. Our recent venture into online training has been well received and we again see value in providing the online training service and connection to other related online services. Good trained Building Automation personnel are hard to find and we hope that by providing an easy method to learn about our complex industry we can help.\n\nJanuary February\n\nOur web site experienced more than a 10% growth last month. Thank you industry. There is a lot of excitement in the industry! The growing desire of progressive building owners to use web based solutions which have attractive Return on Investments or \"ROI\" is driving this excitement. The digital office revolution in their own and clients space has prepared building owners to grasp the potential of cost effective web based upgrades to existing and new buildings to increase, insure and communicate client comfort at the lowest energy and manpower costs. Moving to the next level of advanced digital buildings for owners is easily achievable now because of our industry's present position which includes a myriad of web based solutions. This position allows us to lead in the world's dynamic / interactive data integration revolution, bringing working examples such as Dynamic Energy Accounting, Indoor Air Quality, Client Comfort Communication & Control interfaces, etc. For us to achieve this goal we must look at repackaging our conservative industry which originally evolved selling thermostats, control valves and other devices. We must rapidly evolve into the exciting identity that makes web based information and interactions come alive with connections to the real world. I was pleased to be asked to provide my comments to the BuildConn advisory board which has created the concept of a Council of Advanced Building Systems. Although this concept grew out of the BuildConn advisory board, my input to the group was to make the scope larger than their highly focused integration group by involving building owners, designers, industry marketers, and the end users in their council. In short make it an \"industry melting pot\". This new body, Council of Advanced Building Systems, will bring together all players involved in buildings systems with members from all disciplines including HVAC/R, Access Control, IT, Lighting, CCTV, Security and Integration technologies. There is a concern in the industry that because the council concept was created by the BuildConn group that it is simply an extension of their excellent efforts towards providing critical cross industry information. I believe the council's effect will be the summation of it's members' efforts. If the members are concerned about the direction and scope, then the members will make the necessary changes. The council or an offshoot of it must provide critical industry marketing and positioning. Although there may be some over all questions the fact that the BuildConn group is prepared to assemble the council as part of their efforts deserves industry support. The council spokesperson, Anto Budiardjo, the conceptor of the Building Connection Forum Buildconn, is presently assembling a group of industry leaders for a steering committee to guide development. A group of founding members will also be assembled as a demonstration of total industry commitment. Please join me in providing your support to this Council. The AHR Expo was a huge success with a lot of excitement. Read our Chicago in Review for more details on this incredible industry event. January Industry buzz is; Have you seen the new CABA Technology Roadmap for Intelligent Buildings? This document is the focal point for our industry to get on with the task of repackaging and reinvention of the large building automation industry. I have dedicated my February Engineered System Building Automation Column to this topic. What do you think of Internet 0? Make sure you read Building Intelligence & the Internet \"system was referred to as \"Internet 0,\" because it sought to create a layer below today's Internet that provides a foundation for its interface to the physical world\" This may bring a big change to our industry. The end of January is the AHRExpo.com and we will be posting information as we receive it. Please come to our free sessions http://www.ahrexpo.com/meetings/sessions.html and provide us your input. Also please check out our AHR Expo Product Previews. Every month AutomatedBuildings.com passes a new milestone or becomes involved in a new way with our industry. Here is a brief summary.\n\nMarch April\n\nThe excitement still goes on, our April joint venture supplement/outsert called \"Control Convergence\" goes out this month to over 50,000 of Engineered Systems' readers in print and online to over 30,000 AutomatedBuildings.com readers. Although the printed message is powerful It occurred to me while we were preparing the online version that the extra power of linking key words and concepts allowed the depth of the data and usefulness to be significantly increased over the printed format. Now if we can figure out how to take that power to the convenience of paper we will have a winning combination. So for now I recommend that you view the information in both formats. I was pleased that my contributing editor and friend Tom Hartman joined me on this project and as usual delivered a powerful message that encourages all our minds to thinking bigger thoughts. My ES column for April Community Convergence shares a common theme. Our business communities must converge as part of our transition to web-based ways. A great article in our April issue called Economy Drives Convergence by Jeff Gollnick Communications Manager, Alerton Inc. adds further power to our Convergence theme. I was very pleased to add to our Web Services Forum a proposal from Paul Ehrlich of Trane Global Controls Creating a standard for XML and Web Services for Building Control. An initial meeting to gauge interest and begin planning will be held at BuilConn in Dallas on April 23rd from 1:00 â 3:00 PM. If you are interested in attending in person or via teleconference please RSVP to Kirk McElwain at kirkatcaba@sympatico.ca I am also very excited that my abstract entitled \"The Greening of Buildings with Automation\" has been accepted for presentation at the CIBSE/ASHRAE Conference to be held in Edinburgh, Scotland, September 24-26. http://xp20.ashrae.org/MEET/scotland2003-menu.htm. The conference title is âBuilding Sustainability, Value and Profitâ. In addition I have also been accepted to submit a paper on a similar topic to the Asia Pacific Conference on Built Environment 2003 18-19 November 2003 (Tue-Wed), Kowloon Shangri-la Hotel, Hong Kong http://www.ashrae.org.hk/apc2003/ Their theme is buildings will need to be responsive to human needs, yet reduce their environmental loadings. I believe that our greatly changed large building automation industry is the key to many of the required solutions of Sustainability, Value, Profit, being responsive to human needs, while reducing environmental loadings. Yet as an industry we consistently fail to tell the world. Please help me take our message to the world by sharing your thoughts on this subject with me sinclair@automatedbuildings.com.\n\nAn Open Letter; To the Building Controls Industry on formation of Open Standards for XML and Web Services New story 1\n\nGuideline for XML / Web Services for Building Control The Building Controls industry has made great strides over the last 10 years in the creation of communications standards. Both BACnet and LonTalk are now viable, commercially accepted solutions that provide owners with open communications. Yet while we have made great progress in these areas as an industry, there has been an emergence of a larger, more globally accepted standard created by the world of Information Technology. In particular the broad acceptance and ever lowering cost of Ethernet / TCP/IP / XML communications is finding its way into our industry. Owners today are looking for:\n\nMay\n\nMay BuilConn in Dallas was a gratifying event for me; a lot of what we have been talking about on our web site for the past four years is now coming to pass. Finding this group of open-minded open systems people who are willing to discuss objectively all platforms to truly give the owner what he wants was inspirational. Open systems is an evolving concept and each opening of another system leads to a greater opening of our minds. We have a few interviews that share the feeling of BuilConn; something significant happened there and it will take us all some time to completely comprehend. Keith E. Gipson, CEO and CTO, Impact Facility Solutions www.myfacility.com co-founder of the world's first, internet based Enterprise Energy Management company, Silicon Energy Corp. provides some great industry insights in to the industry and BuilConn connection. Read the interview. Jack McGowan shared the BuilConn Experience and kicked in with a great article on Deep Integration. Deep integration is a process rather than a conclusion, but it results in true Energy Web Services that companies can offer to go far beyond traditional DDC and Building Automation. Jack and I have agreed to prepare yet another supplement/outsert as a joint venture with Engineered Systems for the November 2003 issue called \"Selling Integration\". Please feed either one of us with any information you have about our industries approach to selling our new metamorphous. Our April joint venture supplement/outsert called \"Control Convergence\" went out this month to over 50,000 of Engineered Systems' readers in print and online to over 30,000 AutomatedBuildings.com readers. Although the printed message is KMC Controls powerful It occurred to me while we were preparing the online version that the extra power of linking key words and concepts allowed the depth of the data and usefulness to be significantly increased over the printed format.

I am also planning for my speaking engagement at CIBSE/ASHRAE Conference Edinburgh, Scotland and have just become a media sponsor and speaker for \"Intelligent Building, Building Intelligence\" China Forum, Nov 13-14 Shanghai, China, so life is busy but good. I am working hard to have our global online large building automation magazine continue our cross pollination and inter-connection of automation and intelligent building stakeholders. I applaud the \"Intelligent Building, Building Intelligence\" event's scope that includes not only intelligent buildings, but intelligent communities, and intelligent facility management. I believe that China has the opportunity and potential to lead the world with exciting new fully implemented intelligent communities, as they expand their large building infrastructures during a time of previously never before available new technologies. It will require careful planning and global communication with many new players to achieve the goals but events like this will be the catalyst to start the process. I will keep you posted as the event unfolds\n\nAugust\n\nInternet-based Energy and Security Most industry proponents believe that energy, security, and IT technology are converging-with the Internet taking center stage.

Please read the review for a heart felt message to our industry from Terry Wyatt, President of CIBSE Scotland is a fascinating place steeped in history in many ways but especially for the building industry. Their collection of large buildings from Castles to Cathedrals to 1800's office buildings to the new parliament buildings in Edinburgh now under construction, inspired my November building automation column for Engineered Systems titled Protection, Correction, and Connection. Watch for it next month as well as the pullout supplement written by Anto, Jack, and myself called \"Marketing Convergence\" - Connection and Convergence Combine. Tom's article Ending the Blackout Blues, We need (REALLY need) to improve the way our industry delivers - tells us to first, take responsibility for our designs and to be open to new ideas and approaches.

In addition to planning for our free sessions at AHR Expo 2004 Anaheim, I have been asked to moderate a \"Panel Discussion on XML related HVAC industry initiatives and views\" at the XML Symposium. The XML Symposium will be held on January 27, 2004 at the Anaheim Hilton Hotel and will be in conjunction with the AHR Exposition. This will be another ground breaking event for the large building automation industry. What is oBIX? oBIX stands of Open Building Information Xchange, and is an industry wide initiative to define XML and Web Services based mechanisms to present building systems related information on TCP/IP networks such as the Internet.

There was a tremendous feeling of anticipation as rapid change was all around us. The feeling was amazing! I was extremely pleased to the moderator on the \"Panel Discussion on XML related HVAC industry initiatives and views\" at the XML Symposium. My panel of Extraordinary Gentleman did a great job of providing insight to the reach of this new data carrying vehicle. The significant of XML in our future was well defined at this exciting symposium attended by over 160 attendees. I applaud CABA for bringing this timely subject to the ASHRAE winter meeting. This confirms the ever expanding reach of ASHRAE. I was impressed with the industry's desire to use the capabilities of this new data transfer vehicle. 2004 is starting to look like the year of convergence in the buildings industry. Probably the most interesting and core piece is the realization that XML and Web Services (XML/WS) will be a unifying technology, a catalyst for convergence. Be sure to read my interview with Anto that provides insight to the XML Symposium. Also see our oBIX FAQ and the article oBIXTM Evolves at AHR Expo by Randy Amborn, Trane. Tremendous interest by the complete industry at the CABA XML/Web Services Committee meeting at the Hilton, Anaheim on Jan. 26, 2004. A general concern was expressed by all that the marketing message is clear that XML Web Services does not replace BACnet or Lon field bus networks only enhances both. Concerns were also raised about the standards organizations necessary to bring XML Web Services to an industry standard that could be accepted by our industry as well as the IT industry. Our free industry sessions were also well attended with 100 to 160 per session. Dave Branson and I enjoy these sessions as they give us an opportunity to have open discussions with the industry. In several sessions it was very clear that the expertise was in the audience, but this only served to increase the value of these informal sessions. Again we thank AHR Expo for the opportunity and for providing the arena to stage these sessions. I have created a new page of Demonstrations & Presentations Available Online. The medium that we have evolved to of Browser Based Web Presentation can be effectively used to share information and demonstrate our industry's capabilities. As you view these linked demos imagine how you could use the demonstrated techniques to better explain your products and services. Please feel free to share with us demos that have impressed you.

At the XML/Web Services meeting In Anaheim when asked to introduce myself and give a reason for being there I stated \"I Smell News.\" I was right and being in the business of providing content for an online magazine that informs the industry of the latest trends in Large Building Automation this movement has been a windfall. Lots of articles and interviews about the industry's next big event, BuilConn, but also lots of our traditional information flowing. When I started our original web services forum in 2002 we had hoped to have a demo for AHR 2003 Chicago. Our web services forum which has now become history stated \"It now appears clear that the AHR Expo 2003 in Chicago will be too soon to provide a good demonstration and discussion. The general movement of the IT industry into turning the excited web services concept into a reality has taken much longer than originally estimated and discussions still go on. We will revisit this demo at next year's AHR Expo.\" We did not make that date either but we did have a very successful XML Symposium. Well this demo is finally going to happen at this year's BuilConn. In one of the conference call surrounding the setup of the XML Pavilion the question was asked \"Can anyone not port their XML data into a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet? There was no reply from anyone, not even a question. This made me feel that my April Column for Engineered Systems called Entering the Enterprise Through the Office was very timely. Also one of the deliverables for the XML Pavilion is Microsoft Office Integration - This demonstrates how some of the newer generation MicrosoftÂ® Office products such as Excel 2003 (Professional Edition with XML support), FrontPage or InfoPath can 'consume' web services from different building systems and display their data. A lot of interest has been generated by BuilConn's Buildy Awards (The equivalent of the Academy Awards for our industry). A lot of folk who have been soldiering on without recognition of their efforts and their project successes. This year's short list has been prepared - BuilConn: Announces Finalists âBuildyâ Awards so come out to the BuilConn event and cast your vote, plus be sure to get involved in nominating next year's Finalists. What is the Buildy Awards Program? See http://www.builconn.com/buildy/index.htm This month's Review: Content and Quality of presenters keeps BuilConn 2004 Fresh provides insight and connection to the over 90 presenters & content contributors for this exciting event. If you feel that BuilConn is dominating our magazine for the last few months it is because they are generating a lot of the industry's news and April is their month to shine. Last month's editorial follows with more info about the event. Welcome to our March The Build-up to BuilConn issue. As you can see we have a lot of information about this event, which this year includes the first ever industry awards called the Buildy Awards. Be sure to read my interview with Tish to find out more about these new awards and how you can participate. I am pleased to be a track leader as well as a moderator for the BuilConn event. I have summed up my feelings about last year's event the subsequent year in my March building automation column for Engineered Systems. This year's event is also being co-hosted with the M2MExpo. I feel that this will provide another valuable step in the total convergence process.

Ken Sinclair Editor/Owner AutomatedBuildings.com\n\nMay\n\nWow, last month Automated Logic got gobbled up by Carrier / United Technologies and this month it is Andover's turn to get gobbled by Schneider Electric. Last year TAC was also gobbled up by Schneider Electric plus, Novar of the United Kingdom acquired Alerton. What does this all mean? Change in our industry is constant. I am sure this is all for the best, although I feel that we will all miss the innovation that these companies provided to our industry. It does tell me that what we are doing is becoming main stream plus very global and that web ways and the importance of controlling the new wave of the converging real time data with our existing clients' enterprise is not going un-noticed by the major players. The purchase the industry leaders' client base is well understood as the quickest way to move into a new industry. I feel that the games have just begun and the independent companies have a clear message that if you provide comprehensive powerful integration solutions and assemble a strong client base someone will likely buy you out. This keeps the pressure on us all to innovate and keep the creative juices flowing. With Andover Controls, Schneider Electric will expand its security capabilities and benefit from a platform well suited for expansion in electronic security, which is a â¬ 20 billion market growing by 7% a year. Last year when Schneider took over TAC the market was estimated at â¬11 billion, growing on average by more than 6% a year. Our markets in all areas are rapidly expanding and globalization is upon us. Our last month's article LonWorks and BACnet Solution on a Chip was extremely well read and created a lot interest. This month Waking Up to Wireless points out that this new approach will add even more fuel to the fire. Exciting times and a great time to be in the news business. I finally got around to updating our Education tab. Although it had many broken links I was pleased that most of the core messages where still true and I was able to provide linkage to more online information. I was prompted to get at this when someone thanked me at BuilConn for providing this education reference service and said that he had all new employees spend a few days poking at the section just to get a overview of what our industry is all about. Now if I can only convince the new kids reorganizing their company web sites with active server pages and flash to not break the original links to their valuable information. I cringe at the loss of impact of some of the several year old web sites being reorganization by those not understanding the power of existing related links. Be sure to read our update.
