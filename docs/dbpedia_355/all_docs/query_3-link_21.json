and controlling the operation of various automated applications within a small building.\n\nIBS Intelligent Building Systems\n\nthese various Intelligent Building Systems may also be configured to monitor the safety of the property, contents and people in the building. Whether the building is occupied or empty, these IBS systems keep watchful control over the fire and security status, the comfort and energy consumption, and the effects of changing weather or occupancy to efficiently operate the entire physical plant.\n\nSpecially trained engineers, programmers, commissioning and maintenance technicians design, program, install and maintain these expensive and complex multiple IBS systems. After installation, the complexity of these IBS systems requires that they be operated by trained building technical and security staff. Typically, this staff is dedicated to the use and operation of the various IBS.\n\nIBS systems integrate, at a host level on a PC workstation(s), the individual computerized control functions of access, security, HVAC, lighting, and fire protection in an effort to provide occupant comfort, safety, and convenience, both during and after working hours.\n\nThese IBS systems adjust the building's various applications based upon preprogrammed instructions and can provide management reports of abnormal conditions (alarms), property usage and energy consumption, operating trends and maintenance information.\n\nthese systems may turn on lights, adjust the HVAC for comfort, turn security systems to the occupied status, enable elevators, and compensate for prevailing weather at the beginning of a day.\n\nthese complex IBS's may reverse the process to maximize efficiency, minimize energy cost and provide for occupant and property protection.\n\nthe interaction of preprogrammed parameters, real time sensor inputs, and operating events make these IBS's adjust automatically to schedules, occupant requirements, and the need of the management for timely indications of, and interactions for, planned and exceptional circumstances.\n\nsmall building typically include little more than a timing device for each HVAC unit, lighting control at each lighting panel, and separate burglar alarm type security.\n\nEach device operates independent of the other controls in the building and each has no central point of reporting or adjustment. This means that every change in use or schedule must typically be entered again and again into each controller by the maintenance personnel. Changes of schedule, or season, or use result in tedious and laborious modification to the various discrete applications. In many cases, operating parameters are selected as a matter of convenience for the maintenance person with little concern for efficiency, cost avoidance, or occupant convenience.\n\na control system for use in small buildings is provided with a local control interface that is preprogrammed with profiles of various application controllers types which permit autoconfiguration of the application controllers.\n\nthe local control interface includes means for obtaining the application controller type from each new application controller.\n\nthe local control interface uses the controller type as a key to access the pre-stored profile for the specific application controller type.\n\nthe profile provides the local control interface with all control variable information necessary to configure the application controller on the local control interface.\n\nthe local control interface also includes means for obtaining an application controller profile directly from the application controller at the time of configuration. This mechanism is particularly useful when the profile for a specific application controller is not contained in the pre-stored profile database.\n\nthe local control interface may acquire profiles directly from application controllers that are freely programmable for custom applications not pre-stored in the local control interface's profile database.\n\nthe present invention also provides a method for configuring an application controller.\n\nthe application controllers include a service pin that is actuated to initiate the automated configuration process. Upon activation of the service pin, the application controller transmits its processor ID to the local control interface. In response, the local control interface assigns a unique system ID to the device and polls the application controller to determine, among other things, its controller type. Once the controller type is determined, the local control interface retrieves the pre-stored profile for that specific controller type.\n\nthe profiles include all information regarding the control variables associated with a particular controller type.\n\ncontrol interface and various application controllers communication over a conventional communications network with explicit messages using explicit addressing.\n\nthe control interface is preferably preprogrammed with definitions of the various explicit messages that may be sent or received by the control interface.\n\neach application controller is preferably preprogrammed with definitions of the various explicit messages that may be sent or received by that application controller.\n\nthe local control interface includes means for periodically sending ping message to each of the application controllers.\n\nthe ping message may include control variables that affect operation of the application controller.\n\nthe application controllers include means for updating their control variables in accordance with values presented in the ping message.\n\nthe application controllers each include means for sending a response to each ping message. The response confirms that the application controller is still available on the network and, depending on the application controller, may return to the local control interface the value of one or more control variables that may be forwarded to or otherwise affect operation of other application controllers.\n\nthe data structure of the ping message for each controller type is preferably preprogrammed into the local control interface, thereby eliminating the need for user input to define these data structures at the time of configuration.\n\nthe local control interface is pre-programmed to provide integration between applications of various types.\n\nthe controller interface is preprogrammed to make appropriate changes to one application controller in view of information received from another application controller.\n\nthe control interface preferably includes sufficient programming to provide integration between HVAC applications, lighting applications, security alarming and card access applications.\n\nthe controller interface will also be preprogrammed to provide integration between public utility demand meter reading applications and asset monitoring applications, for example, applications that work with RF asset tags or bar codes to monitor movement and/or status of various assets, and alarm status from a fire alarm system.\n\ncontrol system includes a network server interface that permits the control system to be operated and monitored using conventional Internet or dial-up access capabilities.\n\nthe local control interface provides explicit messages that permit other compatible devices to read and write to the local control interface remotely.\n\nthe present invention provides a cost effective small building control system that is relatively simple to install, configure and operate.\n\nthe present invention preferably includes a dedicated local control interface that replaces the high-cost PC conventionally used to configure and/or operate a conventional IBS.\n\nthe dedicated controller includes only those components necessary to configure and control the system, and is therefore less expensive than conventional PCs.\n\nthe local control interface is preprogrammed with profiles for the various application controllers supported by the system, the control system permits self-configuration of the application controllers.\n\nthe local control interface also permits grouping of various application controllers, including application controllers of different types. This permits group toggling of occupancy status and potentially other variables, thereby permitting a certain level of integration between applications of differing types, for example the control of lighting and HVAC applications in response to access events.\n\na further level of integration is provided by the explicit messages sent by the local control interface. These messages transfer the value of control variables between application controllers, including application controllers of different types.\n\nthe network server interface also permits dial-up or Internet-based control and therefore provides additional flexibility in monitoring and controlling the system.\n\nFIG. 1 schematic diagram showing the various components of a control system in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention\n\nFIG. 2 is a block diagram illustrating the components of the local control interface\n\nFIG. 3 is a block diagram illustrating the components of the HVAC and lighting application controllers\n\nFIG. 4 is a block diagram illustrating the components of the access control application controller\n\nFIG. 5 is a schematic diagram of an ASM-1\n\nFIG. 6 is a schematic diagram of an LCU-1\n\nFIG. 7 is a typical thermostat module system diagram\n\nFIG. 8 is a representation of the data structure for an HVAC control ping\n\nFIG. 9 is a representation of the data structure for an HVAC response message\n\nFIG. 10 is a representation of the data structure for an ACU control ping\n\nFIG. 11 is a representation of the data structure for an ACU response message\n\nFIG. 12 is a representation of the data structure for an ASM control ping\n\nFIG. 13 is a representation of the data structure for an ASM response message\n\nFIGS. 14 A- 14 B are a flow chart showing the steps of a preferred embodiment of the automated configuration process\n\nFIG. 15 is a representation of the data structure for an access request message\n\nFIG. 16 is a representation of the data structure for an access response message\n\nFIG. 17 is a representation of the data structure for a door user message\n\nFIG. 18 is a representation of the data structure for an alarm message\n\nFIG. 19 is a representation of the data structure for an LCU control ping.\n\nFIG. 20 is a representation of the data structure for an LCU response message.\n\nFIG. 1 A schematic diagram illustrating the architecture of a control system according to a preferred embodiment is shown in FIG. 1 and generally designated 10 .\n\nthe control system 10 is a distributed control system having a local control interface 12 and a plurality of application controllers 14 , 15 , 16 and 18 interconnected by a conventional communications network 20 .\n\nthe local control interface 12 manages the control system 10 providing direct digital control of the application controllers.\n\nEach application controller controls operation of a corresponding application, such as HVAC application controller 14 , card access/security application controller 16 , lighting application controller 18 and system-wide sensor controller 15 .\n\nthe application controllers are generally stand-alone controllers operating in accordance with various control variables.\n\nthe local control interface 12 provides a user interface for monitoring system parameters, changing the value of control variables and managing alarms and events.\n\nthe local control interface 12 provides integration between application controllers 14 , 15 , 16 and 18 , including application controllers of different types.\n\nthe local control interface 12 is preprogrammed with profiles of the various types of application controllers 14 , 15 , 16 and 18 that are supported by the system 10 , including the relevant control variables for each. Additionally, the local control interface 12 may acquire a profile from an application controller at the time of self-configuration, for example, if the application is unknown to the local control interface 12 or a new or customized version of the profile is available. Profiles may also be downloaded through the local control interface 12 or remote access such as the Internet or a dialed or direct connection. These profiles permit self-configuration of the application controllers.\n\nthe present invention is directed to a small building control system including a local control interface 12 and a variety of application controllers 14 , 15 , 16 and 18 that communicate over a conventional communications network 20 .\n\nthe communications network 20 may be any of a variety of conventional hardwire networks, for example, Ethernet or other hardwire networking technologies.\n\nthe control system 10 is also suited for use with a wide range of wireless networking technologies, such as radio frequency, power line carrier, optical and other similar technologies.\n\nthe control system 10 may include a combination of networking technologies.\n\nthe system 10 may include a primary network section 20 a (and a network extension section 20 b that are interconnected by communication interfaces 20 c and 20 d.\n\nthe present invention may also include capabilities for remote networking. Internet, point-of-sale cash register systems, wide area networks and local area networks can be use for remote control and monitoring of the control system 10 .\n\nthe system 10 may include a data, web page server 22 to provide an interface for various remote networking capabilities. These various networking technologies are well known to those skilled in the art and therefore will not be described in detail.\n\nthe control system 10 is managed by a local control interface 12 .\n\nthe local control interface 12 may be implemented using a wide variety of circuit components and circuit layouts. Accordingly, the local control interface will vary from application to application. For largely cost reasons, the local control interface is preferably embodied in a dedicated control device having only the necessary hardware components.

Suffice it to say that this is a half-duplex communication interface over a mutually sensed and modulated DC current-limited power line, the mechanics of which have been practiced for many years and the actual operation of such is well known to those skilled in microcontroller-based designs.\n\nAn alternative that has also been developed uses the same type of mutual sensing and modulation in conjunction with a controller generated Manchester self-clocking (data with inferred clocking via bit cell transition polarity based on the previous data bit) command data stream with a trailing alternating clock/data bit stream for responses.\n\nthe intercontroller network interface section 110 supplies external network communications to the application controller and generally includes an FTT10A Free Topology Transceiver (not shown) and its associated circuitry or an LT485 EIA485 differential transceiver (not shown) and its associated circuitry, as desired.\n\nthe intercontroller network interface may include a different interface such as the PLT22 power line transceiver.\n\nthe actual protocol used is the Echelon LonWorks Manchester-based (for FTT10A or EIA485 interfaces) or the Echelon LonWorks special mode interface (for PLT22 or other power line interfaces).\n\nthe Echelon LonWorks protocols are well known to those skilled in microcontroller designs.\n\nthe intercontroller network interface also includes a dual LED (not shown) for indication of the status of network activity via an LM339 comparator and controller transmission.\n\nthe power supply section 112 supplies internal operating voltages to the application controller and generally includes a half-wave input rectifier diode (not shown), a current limiting resistor (not shown) and input over current protection (not shown); and a +15 volt supply using an LM317 adjustable linear voltage regulator (not shown), with its output set by appropriate resistors.\n\nthe voltage regulator does not use a bulk input capacitor, but instead allows its output to âdroopâ between power line half-wave cycles. This substantially reduces the internal heat generated.\n\nthe power supply further includes a +5 volt supply using an LM78M05 +5 volt linear voltage regulator (not shown); a comparator and DA converter reference circuit generating both 1.67 volt and 3.3 volt bias.\n\nthe ACU application controllers use a somewhat different circuit design than the previously described HVAC and lighting application controllers.\n\nthe ACU is intended to be used in a distributed networked system with specific peripherals and communication medium. As such, the choices for supplied power and networking technology are made as part of the overall system design and may require external modules to implement.\n\nEach ACU application controller generally includes central processing section 150 , card reader interface circuitry 152 , sensor loop interface circuitry 154 , relay and digital output interface circuitry 156 , intercontroller network interface circuitry 158 and power supply section 160 .\n\nthe central processing section 150 includes an Echelon 3150 Neuron CPU 162 that provides the applications program, I/O point control, and interface to the Lonworks network via either the FTT10A Free Topology Transceiver or an EIA485 Transceiver, as described in more detail below.\n\nthe Neuron processor 162 includes an EEPROM 167 .\n\nthe central processing section 150 also includes a 32K Byte Static RAM chip 166 , and a GAL logic device 168 for address decoding an external EPROM 164 , preferably in the form of a 27C010 Flash ROM chip, for the storage of the operating software as well as the application program.\n\nthe RAM chip 166 is used to provide additional file buffers for the ACU.\n\nthe GAL logic device 168 provides the OE*, the WE*, the Flash select, and the RAM select, and also generates the output port latch clock.\n\nthe central processing section 150 also includes a service pin circuit (not shown).\n\nthe service pin circuit has two functions: first it is driven by a push button autoconfiguration switch 170 to indicate to the Neuron processor 162 that it is required to request service information as described in the Echelon Documentation, second it drives the service LED 172 in conjunction with a 270 ohm resistor. This initiates the self-configuration of the ACU with the LCI, as described in more detail below.\n\nthe central processing section 150 further includes a system clock oscillator circuit 174 which generate the system clock used by the Neuron processor 162 , preferably at 10 MHz; a reset circuit 176 having a DS1233 low voltage reset controller (not shown), 24.99K pull up resistors (not shown) and a 0.001uF timing capacitor (not shown) that is used to monitor the +5V power supply for proper levels; and a real time clock 178 .\n\na system clock oscillator circuit 174 which generate the system clock used by the Neuron processor 162 , preferably at 10 MHz\n\na reset circuit 176 having a DS1233 low voltage reset controller (not shown), 24.99K pull up resistors (not shown) and a 0.001uF timing capacitor (not shown) that is used to monitor the +5V power supply for proper levels\n\na real time clock 178 a real time clock 178 .\n\nthe Neuron processor 162 uses a Motorola 68HC05P6A I/O microcontroller 180 for the direct interface to the card readers, keypads, and the supervised and unsupervised inputs (not shown).\n\nthe ACU uses the larger address space of the Neuron processor 162 in order to have greater flexibility in the number of bindings and file buffers available.\n\nthe I/O microcontroller 180 is connected to a system clock oscillator circuit 180 which generates the system clock used by the I/O microcontroller 180 , preferably at 4 MHz.\n\nthe Neuron processor 162 interfaces to the I/O microcontroller 180 via a seven-bit interface.\n\nthe Neuron processor 162 queries the I/O microcontroller 180 for messages via the DATA_RDY and uses the DATA_SEL 0 , DATA_SEL 1 , and DATA_TYPE to establish what kind of data and then uses the Neurowire (or SPI) port I/O object to send/receive data to/from the I/O microcontroller 180 .\n\nthe I/O microcontroller 180 buffers input data from the card reader(s) and/or keypad(s), as well as providing analog and binary inputs. More specifically, supervised input channels are realized via an integral 8 bit 0 to +5 volt analog to digital converter (not shown). The interpretation of an input value is a function of the specific designed use of that input used as a multi-state supervised input. Essentially, a voltage divider made up of the 4.7K ohm loop bias resistors and the end of line resistor installed in each detector is used to determine the state of the loop. The nominal end of line resistor value is 4.7K ohm 5%. The nominal state of the loop with 4.7K ohm is the Normal state.\n\na transient protector (not shown), plurality of 10K ohm series resistors, and filter capacitors (not shown) are used to limit and filter the supervised inputs.\n\nthe I/O microcontroller 180 also provides unsupervised inputs that are designed to detect binary contact closures to local common. They are realized via the same type input limiting and filtering circuitry as the supervised inputs. In this instance, the input values are read as digital inputs.\n\nthe I/O microcontroller 180 further includes card reader track data inputs.\n\nthe card readers' â0â and â1â inputs (Entry reader is used as an example) are connected to pull up resistors (not shown) and to the transient protectors (not shown) and filter capacitors (not shown). They then go to an inverting Schmidt trigger input device (not shown) and a reader type logic selection GAL (not shown) which is connected to two input port pins on the I/O microcontroller 180 .\n\nthe reader type logic selection GAL (not shown) is connected to the I/O microcontroller's interrupt line. If the Wiegand mode is selected, both data input lines go to the interrupt. If the magnetic mode is selected only the clock (or â0â) line is connected to the interrupt.\n\nthe reader modes are selected by a DIP switch (not shown).\n\nthe I/O microcontroller 180 receives these interrupts in conjunction with either of the two input port pins, it buffers the track data from the reader.\n\nthe second or exit card reader is interfaced in the same manner.\n\nthe reset controller 176 of the Neuron processor 162 is to connected to a pull up resistor (not shown) and to the I/O microcontroller's reset line via a diode (not shown) to synchronize the reset of the I/O microcontroller 180 .\n\nthe Neuron processor 162 can directly reset the I/O microcontroller 180 alone via the 101 line.\n\nthe ACU includes card reader interface circuitry 152 for interfacing the card reader(s) and/or keypad(s) (not shown) to the I/O microcontroller 180 .\n\nThis circuitry 152 is generally conventional and will therefore not be described in detail.\n\nthe ACU includes sensor loop interface circuitry 154 for interfacing any external sensors (not shown) to the I/O microcontroller 180 .\n\nThis circuitry 154 is generally conventional and will not be described in detail.\n\nthe intercontroller network interface circuitry 158 supplies external network communications.\n\nthe network interface circuitry 158 generally includes an FTT10A Free Topology Transceiver (not shown) and its associated circuitry or an LT485 EIA485 differential transceiver (not shown) and its associated circuitry, as desired.\n\nthe intercontroller network interface circuitry 158 may include a different interface such as the PLT22 power line transceiver.\n\nthe actual protocol used is the Echelon LonWorks Manchester-based (for FTT10A or EIA485 interfaces) or the Echelon LonWorks special mode interface (for PLT22 or other power line interfaces).\n\nthe Echelon LonWorks protocols are well known to those skilled in microcontroller designs.\n\nthe intercontroller network interface circuitry 158 also includes a dual LED (not shown) for indication of the status of network activity via an HC86 logic gate and controller transmission.\n\nthe relay and digital output interface circuitry 156 provides an output interface for controlling external devices, such as an electronic door strike. More specifically, the ACU has eight digital output bits generated via an AC574 latch (not shown). Seven of these eight lines go an MC1413D relay driver device (not shown). One of these seven drives the strike relay (not shown) for the door strike output. The other six supply open collector sinking digital outputs. The eighth line is connected to the base of a transistor (not shown) which drives a high frequency audio indicator (not shown) or a second relay (not shown) which can be used for a second door strike.\n\nthe latch (not shown) is memory mapped within the Neuron address space and the generation of the rising edge write strobe takes place within the GAL logic device 168 based on the address location, R/W, and E.\n\nthe open collector outputs of the relay device driver are used to sink up to 50 ma loads.\n\nthe six open collector outputs are transient protected and generally are used for indicators.\n\nthe power supply section 160 is a step down (buck) switchmode converter circuit including an input section containing a series diode and an input filter capacitor. This section provides a half wave rectified, filtered DC bus at approximately the peak of the input voltage.\n\nAn LM2575M-5.0 converter (not shown) provides an output of +5.0 V via an energy storage inductor (not shown), a commutating diode (not shown), and a filter capacitor (not shown). Most of the pins on the converter are connected to the groundplane for heatsinking purposes.\n\na transient protector (not shown) provides transient protection because the +5V can be used to power the readers.\n\nthe power supply section 160 includes supply selection jumpers (not shown) that are used for the reader power selection. Regardless of the supply selected, there are transient protectors (not shown) and series limiters (not shown) for ACU supply protection.\n\nMany applications will include one or more integrated sensors that provide information to the application controller. These sensors are typically packaged with and often dedicated to use with the specific application.\n\na DX package unit may include an inside temperature sensor that provides inside temperature to the application controller.\n\ncontrol system 10 may also includes various network-wide sensors that provide information to the control system 10 , which shares that information with those application controllers that use such information.\n\ncontrol system 10 preferably includes an auxiliary sensor module (ASM- 1 ) (described above) that is a LonWorks communications device which provides input information common to many HVAC control devices, such as outside air temperature, outside air humidity and supply hot water temperature.\n\nASM- 1 auxiliary sensor module\n\nthe local control interface 12 provides the sensed values to the appropriate application controllers over the network.\n\nthe control system 10 also preferably includes a thermostat module (DTM- 1 ) for interfacing thermostatic functions to HVAC equipment.\n\nthe thermostat is a self-contained intelligent thermostat capable of communicating with various HVAC devices over the LonWorks network.\n\na typical thermostat module system diagram is shown in FIG. 7.\n\nthe thermostat application includes space temperature, setpoint adjust, fan override and occupancy override. In operation, the thermostat permits adjustment of the space temperature setpoint within predefined limits.\n\nthe thermostat also preferably includes a push-button override that temporarily changes the occupancy status to âoccupied.â\n\nthe control system 10 may include various other sensor modules that provide information that is provided to a single application controller or that is shared with a plurality of application controllers across the network.\n\ncontrol system 10 is essentially a distributed system with stand-alone application controllers 14 , 15 , 16 and 18 capable of operating in the absence of communication with the local control interface 12 .\n\nthe local control interface 12 has the ability, among other things, to monitor and adjust control variables in the various application controllers, thereby affecting operation of the various applications.\n\nthe control system 10 includes various software components that control operation of the local control interface and application controllers. The design and configuration of these software components will be well within the abilities of one skilled in the art after review of the operation of these components described herein. Accordingly, the software components will not be described in detail.\n\nthe local control interface 12 and application controllers are capable of communicating over a variety of hardwire and/or wireless communication backbones.\n\nthe present invention uses Echelon Corporation's LonWorks technology as its communications medium.\n\nthe network architecture is primarily master/slave with peer-to-peer (i.e., application controller to application controller) communications only as required by some applications.\n\nthe local control interface 12 initiates most exchanges of communication with the application controllers. All communication exchanges are initiated using LonWorks explicit messages with explicit addressing (i.e. direct 48-bit Neuron ID addressing).\n\nthe local control interface 12 uses Standard Network Variable Types (SNVTs) for the standard data object model values sent via explicit addressing to each application controller.\n\nSNVTs Standard Network Variable Types\n\nthe application controllers 14 , 15 , 16 and 18 and the controller interface 12 also provide LonWorks SNVTs for access to system features via third-party LonWorks devices.\n\nthe local controller interface 12 does not directly manipulate the third-party device's SNVTs using LonWorks Network Management commands, however, third party networking tools can.\n\nthe present invention preferably operates using LonWorks, the control system is well-suited for use with essentially any private protocols or âplug and playâ open communications protocols.\n\nthe local control interface 12 preferably includes two modes of operation, namely installer mode and user mode.\n\nInstaller mode permits the user to access and control all aspects of the local control interface.\n\nUser mode permits access to only a limited set of commands, thereby reducing the likelihood of accidental or mischievous modification of important system settings.\n\nthe precise amount of control permitted in user mode can vary from application to application, but in the preferred embodiment, user mode only permits access to and modification of temperature setpoints for controllers, existing schedules and view/acknowledge alarms.\n\nthe local control interface 12 has the ability to divide the network of application controllers 14 , 15 , 16 and 18 into occupancy groups.\n\nthe occupancy groups are used to permit collective control of the member application controllers in each group. For example, the lighting and HVAC applications in a given area can be grouped together into a single occupancy group so that those applications can be operated as a group.\n\nthe local control interface 12 of the preferred embodiment supports 16 occupancy groups. Each occupancy group includes a schedule and a list of up to 62 application controllers. The occupancy status of an occupancy group can be controlled by the corresponding schedule, via an access controller (such as an ACU- 1 as described below) or manually using the local control interface 12 .\n\nan access controller such as an ACU- 1 as described below\n\nthe local control interface 12 preferably supports up to 16 schedules, one for each occupancy group.\n\nthe schedules may be used for group occupancy control, timed operation of access control, door mode control, door free access control and lighting control.\n\nEach schedule preferably supports up to two start/stop time intervals for each day of the week and up to two start/stop intervals for holidays.\n\nthe local control interface 12 maintains a database of up to 50 holidays. Holidays can be preprogrammed or user defined after installation.\n\nthe local control interface 12 also provides control configuration wizards that walk the user through the steps required to monitor and/or set the control variables for a particular application controller.\n\nthe wizards include easy-to-use graphical setup screens for common configuration items, such as occupied/unoccupied temperature setpoints and backup scheduling and alarm limits.\n\nthe application controllers 14 , 15 , 16 and 18 operate in accordance with various control variables that are specified by the user (or through pre-set default values).\n\nan HVAC application will include a temperature variable that sets the desired inside temperature for the corresponding area.\n\nthe application controllers are capable of operating in two distinct modes, one when the area is occupied and one when it is not.\n\nan HVAC application may include a first temperature setting to be satisfied when the area is occupied and a second temperature when the area is not occupied.\n\nthe application controllers are typically capable of operating in a stand-alone mode, they are capable of communicating with the local control interface 12 .\n\nthe local control interface 12 has the ability to set control variables values within the application controllers using explicit messages and SNVTs for data structures. This permits the local control interface 12 to affect operation of the various system applications.\n\nthe application controllers are preprogrammed with the data structure or format of all explicit messages associated with the controller type. This permits the application controllers to parse and understand the explicit messages. Alternatively, the applications may be downloaded with this information as necessary, for example, to add new explicit messages or to modify existing explicit messages.\n\nthe local control interface 12 can support from 1 to 62 application controllers.\n\nthe local control interface 12 allows modification of inputs and setpoints for each application controller as well as display of outputs for each controller.\n\nthe local control interface 12 maintains a controller database with certain information concerning each application controller.\n\napplication controllers are added to the controller database, they are given a default name (i.e. Unit 1 AHU 2 ) which can be modified by the user to any 20 -character string.\n\nthe controller's name is used when assigning it to occupancy groups and for alarm display.\n\nEach element in the controller database preferably includes the following attributes:\n\nNeuron ID LonWorks 48-bit Neuron ID for device\n\nProgram ID LionWorks Program ID for device (used as device type)\n\nController database records for ACU controllers preferably have the following additional attributes:\n\nExit Group Group whose occupancy count will be incremented when access attempt successful through exit side of ACU. Entry Group's count will be decremented.\n\nEntry Group Group whose occupancy count will be incremented when access attempt successful through entry side of ACU. Exit Group's count will be decremented.\n\nFree Access Schedule specifies a Schedule for controlling ACU's free access status.\n\nACU will be in Free Access when Schedule is active\n\nAccess Mode Schedule specifies a Schedule for controlling ACU's access mode\n\nAccess Mode when Schedule active mode (card, card+PIN or cipher) for ACU when Access Mode Schedule is active\n\nAccess Mode when Schedule inactive mode (card, card+PIN or cipher) for ACU when Access Mode Schedule is inactive\n\nManual Access Mode forces ACU into card, card+PIN or cipher access mode\n\nthe local control interface 12 allows users to specify occupancy groups, schedules, holidays and setpoints for the various application controllers. This information may be entered into the local control interface 12 using its touch screen. If desired, this information can be entered into a PC-based program and downloaded into the local control interface 12 via the serial port in the AM186EM main processor.\n\nthe control system 10 of the present invention permits self-configuration and integrated operation of application controllers of various types. This is preferably achieved by preprogramming the control system 10 with a configuration table that stores profiles for the various controller types recognized by the system 10 . Although the precise information included in these profiles will vary for each application controller, these profiles generally include information about the input SNVTs, output SNVTs and configuration SNVTs of all supported controller types. The table and its associated routines provide for lookup of SNVTs by name, controller type and controller version ID.\n\nthe LCI maintains another table of supported data types which provides range, base data type, engineering units, enumerations (if applicable), sub-data types (for structured elements), step for increment/decrement and display routines for each data type. All data types used by the LCI have entries in this table. These tables provide the local control interface 10 with sufficient awareness of the application controller to monitor and affect its operation.\n\neach profile includes a record for each variable supported by the application controller.\n\nthe record includes a field for variable type, variable name, display name and variable number.\n\nthe variables are preferably classified in one of three different typesânamely, input variables, output variables and input configuration variables.\n\nInput variables represent variables that can be sent to the application controller by the local control interface.\n\nOutput variables represent variables that can sent by the application controller to the local control interface.\n\ninput configuration variables are control variables that relate to operation of the application controller, but that are not routinely varied through local control interface 12 commands or otherwise.\n\nEach application controller is preferably pre-loaded with default values for all control variables. This facilitates automated configuration, by eliminating the need to provide these control variables with initial values.\n\nthe following is an implementation of the profile for an AHU- 1 application controller presented a âCâ header file: typedef struct snvt_profile â UINT8 direction; // input, output or input config UINT8 snvt_number; // LCI-defined SNVT number char *desc; // string describing SNVT UINT8 index; // index of SNVT on controller â SNVT_PROFILE; SNVT_PROFILE far ââ based( ââ segname(â_CODEâ))\n\nAHU1 [44] â â NV_INPUT,S_TEMP_SPACE,âSpace Temperatureâ,0 â , â NV_INPUT,S_TEMP_SETP,âTemp Setpointâ,1 â , â NV_INPUT,S_OCC_I,âOccupancy Cmdâ,2 â , â NV_INPUT,S_LEV_DISC_I,âReset Runtimesâ,3 â , â NV\n\nGain 31 â , â NV_INPUT_CONFIG,S_LEV_PERCENT,âEcon.

Min Outputâ,35 â , â NV_INPUT_CONFIG,S_VOLT_I,âEcon.\n\nthe local control interface 12 is also preprogrammed with the format of the various explicit message that may be sent or received by the local control interface. This includes the data structures for the various ping messages to be sent to the application controllers, as well as the ping response messages received from the application controllers. Similarly, each application controllers is preprogrammed with the format of the various explicit messages that may be sent or received by that application controller.\n\nthe control system 10 provides self-configuration of the various application controllers 14 , 15 , 16 and 18 .\n\nself-configuration is achieved through a series of communications between the local control interface 12 and the newly installed application controller.\n\nthe self-configuration process 200 will be described in more detail with reference to the flow chart of FIGS. 14 A- 14 B.\n\nthe communications exchange is initiated by activation 202 of the service control button on the application controller. This causes the application controller to send 204 a LonWorks âService Pinâ message that contains the controller's unique Neuron ID.\n\nthe local control interface 12 maintains a table in nonvolatile memory that has a listing for each application controller known to the local control interface.\n\nthe local control interface 12 When the local control interface 12 receives the service pin message, it determines 208 whether it currently has a listing for the application controller's Neuron ID. If it does not, it creates 210 a listing corresponding to that Neuron ID. The local control interface 12 assigns 212 the next available Device ID number to the new application controller and sends 214 a âDevice Designationâ message to the application controller. This message contains the Device ID for the application controller. The application controller stores the Device ID 216 in nonvolatile memory for later use in sending messages to the local control interface. The local control interface uses the Device ID from application controller explicit messages to determine which specific controller sent the message. The local control interface then sends 218 a âController Interface Identificationâ message to the application controller, which contains the Neuron ID of the local control interface. The application controller stores 220 the local control interface Neuron ID in nonvolatile memory for later use in sending messages to the local control interface.\n\nthe local control interface 12 next places 222 the application controller into a common LonWorks Domain and Subnet and assigns a unique LonWorks Node ID.\n\nthe local control interface 12 sends 224 an âUpdate Domainâ message to the application controller including the common LonWorks Domain and Subnet and the unique LonWorks Node ID, which are stored 226 in the application controller.\n\nthe Node ID matches the Device ID assigned earlier. This step is necessary to circumvent several inherent problems with LonWorks networking.\n\nthe local control interface uses LonWorks request/response messages for the âNetwork Variable Fetchâ and âNetwork Variable Updateâ operations, all nodes must have a unique subnet/node combination.\n\nthe local control interface preferably uses Echelon's Hosted Node architecture which has the limitation of only being able to receive explicit messages in one Domain, which requires each node to be in the same Domain.\n\nthe local control interface 10 preferably includes a plurality of wizards that may be run to specify or adjust the control variables for each of the application controller types. These wizards facilitate modification and control of the application controllers by providing a simple menu driven GUI that allows viewing and modification of all appropriate control variables.\n\nthe local control interface 12 monitors the status of and transfers control variable values between application controllers using a periodic message/response methodology.\n\nthe local control interface 12 periodically (e.g. once a second) sends a âpingâ message to each application controller. If the application controller fails to send an appropriate response to a specified number of successive pings (e.g. three), it is considered to be in a failure state and appropriate action can be taken, for example, setting an alarm or generating a log.\n\nThis process is also used to exchange information between the local control interface and the application controller using control variables embedded in the ping message and in the responses to ping messages.\n\nthe data structure of each ping message is preferably preprogrammed into the local control interface 12 .\n\nthe ping message are preferably tailored to correspond with the type of application controller to which it is sent. Alternatively, a single ping message universal to all controller types can be used. With this alternative, each application controller may simply ignore the control variables that are not relevant to its operation.\n\nthe HVAC control ping is periodically sent by the local control interface 12 to each HVAC application controller (e.g. each DXU- 1 , DXU- 2 , AHU- 1 , FCU- 1 , FCU- 2 , FCU- 3 , FCU- 4 and HPU- 1 ).\n\nthe HVAC control ping preferably includes the system time and the occupancy mode for that specific controller.\n\nThese control variables are sent to each HVAC application controller in an explicit message using SNVTs.\n\na representation of the HVAC control ping is illustrated in FIG. 8. The HVAC controller's response demonstrates that it is still communicating with the network and can be used to return control variables to the local control interface in an explicit message using SNVTs.\n\nthe HVAC controller's response preferably includes its Device ID, the outside temperature, the outside humidity and the supply water temperature.\n\na representation of the HVAC response is illustrated in FIG. 9.\n\nthe information received in response from the HVAC controller can be used by the local control interface and/or propagated to other application controllers by the local control interface.\n\nthe ping response is nothing more than an acknowledgement which indicates to the local control interface 12 that the application controller is on line and has received the ping.\n\nthe access control ping message is periodically sent to each ACU.\n\nthe access control ping preferably includes entry side mode, exit side mode, enable/disable flag for entry side, enable/disable flag for exit side, system date, system time, system day of week and ACU Device ID.\n\nthe entry side mode and exit side mode fields indicate the access mode of the ACU.\n\nthe ACU will be capable of operating in four different modes: 1) âcardâ mode, which requires only card validation to obtain access, 2) âcard/pinâ mode, which requires card validation and entry of a valid PIN to obtain access, 3) âcipherâ mode, which requires entry of a valid four-digit code to gain access and 4) âPINâ mode, which requires entry of a valid PIN to gain access.\n\na representation of the ACU control ping is illustrated in FIG. 10.\n\nthe ACU response simply includes the IAC Device ID.\n\na representation of the ACU response is illustrated in FIG. 11.\n\nFIG. 12 a representation of the ASM control ping is illustrated in FIG. 12 and a representation of the ASM response to an ASM ping message is illustrated in FIG. 13. As shown, the response returns the outdoor temperature, outdoor humidity and supply water temperature control variables to the local control interface 12 . As with all other messages, the control variables are presented as SNVTs.\n\nFIG. 19 a representation of the LCU control ping is illustrated in FIG. 19 and a representation of the LCU response to an LCU control ping is illustrated in FIG. 20.\n\nthe LCU control ping is intended solely to solicit a response from the LCU, thereby acknowledging its continued connection to the network.\n\nthe control ping includes a message number indicating that the message is a control ping.\n\nthe LCU response message returns only the unit number to the local control interface.\n\nthe local control interface 12 also has the ability to distribute various process point (or control variable) data to the application controllers.\n\nthe process point data can be obtained from sensors, such as those connected to the ASM- 1 module.\n\nthe local control interface 12 receives the process point data from the ASM- 1 module, or other sensor, in response to the ping message sent by the local control interface 12 .\n\nthe local control interface 12 then transmits the process point data to the appropriate application controllers via a network variable write using explicit addressing.\n\nthe local control interface 12 determines the application controllers that need the information by reviewing the controller profiles provided in the profile database. Alternatively, the process point data can be presented to the appropriate application controllers by including it in the ping message sent to that application controller.\n\nthe local control interface 12 oversees access at the various ACUs within the control system 10 .\n\nthe ACUs send an access request to the local control interface 12 when a valid card reader or keypad entry is obtained from one of the ACU readers/keypads.\n\na representation of the data structure of an access request message is shown in FIG. 15.\n\nthe access request is processed by the local control interface and a response is sent to the ACU indicating whether or not access is granted.\n\na representation of the data structure of an access response message is shown in FIG. 16.\n\nthe local control interface 12 also considers any affect access may have on related occupancy groups, for example, changing an âunoccupiedâ status to âoccupied.â If appropriate, the local control interface 12 sends explicit messages to update the status of the appropriate occupancy group.\n\nThis update will typically occur in the next ping message sent to each application controller with the occupancy group.\n\nthe ACU sends a door used message to the local control interface 12 .\n\na representation of the data structure of a door used message is shown in FIG. 17.\n\nthe control system 10 is preferably capable of operating in five different access modes: 1) âcardâ mode, which requires reading of a valid card to obtain access, 2) âcard/pinâ mode, which requires reading of a valid card and entry of a valid PIN to obtain access, 3) âcipherâ mode, which requires entry of a valid four-digit code to gain access, 4) âPINâ mode, which requires entry of a valid PIN to gain access and 5) âfreeâ mode, which permits free access.\n\naccess mode which requires reading of a valid card to obtain access\n\ncard/pin which requires reading of a valid card and entry of a valid PIN to obtain access\n\n3) âcipherâ mode which requires entry of a valid four-digit code to gain access\n\nPIN which requires entry of a valid PIN to gain access\n\nfree which permits free access.\n\nthe local control interface 12 includes a database supporting up to 500 access cards. Each database entry preferably includes a card number (32-bit raw card number), a card name (18 character ASCII description), a PIN (4-digit BCD number used when card+PIN access is desired), a time/date field (containing the time and date on which the card was last used), a last door field (containing the last door at which the card was used) and an access group field (described below). Cards are added to the database in a general conventional manner, for example, by presenting them at an ACU or via download from a PC or other similar device.\n\nthe local control interface 12 is also capable of storing up to four distinct cipher codes.\n\nthe local control interface permits cards to be placed into access groups. Access groups specify which doors a card may access and what time periods the card allowed access.\n\nthe local control interface preferably supports at least 16 access groups.\n\nthe local control interface also permits ACUs to control occupancy for occupancy groups, if desired.\n\nthe local control interface maintains a person count by tracking the number of entries and exits into an area. If the person count is not zero, the local control interface sets the status of the occupancy group to âoccupied.â\n\neach ACU application controller preferably includes a local âper-doorâ database for validating access in the event of loss of communications with the local control interface.\n\nthe ACU send an access request to the local control interface 12 that is not answered within 1 â 2second, the ACU will attempt to validate the access using the local database.\n\nthe ACU validates an access request locally, it will also preferably generate a time-stamped transaction log indicating the result of the access attempt.\n\nthe ACUs also detects certain alarm conditions and sends appropriate messages to the local control interface 12 when an alarm event occurs.\n\nthe ACU monitors the status of the supervised inputs to determine when a âdoor propped,â âdoor forced,â or âinput tamperingâ condition occurs.\n\na door propped alarm is generated when an individual, who has gained access, leaves the door open for longer than a predefined access time.\n\na door forced alarm is generated when the door is opened without proper access authorization.\n\na representation of the data structure of an access alarm is shown in FIG. 18.\n\nthe local control interface 12 also manages operation of lighting applications within the building via one or more LCUs.\n\nthe LCUs are designed to control commercial lighting circuits, which may include interior lighting, parking lot lights and signage.\n\neach LCU controls the state of eight individual lighting circuits.\n\nthe LCUs provides for eight lighting zones that permit group control of the lighting applications. More specifically, each circuit on each LCU can be associated with one or more of the eight lighting zones. The status of each circuit is affected by controlling the occupancy status of the corresponding lighting zone.\n\nthe lighting zone associations for each LCU are configured via the local control interface 12 .\n\nEach LCU maintains a database of the lighting zone associations for each of its circuits.\n\nthe LCU controls the on/off state of each circuit based on the occupancy status of the zone associated with that circuit.\n\nthe lighting zones can, in turn, be associated with occupancy groups, thereby permitting the occupancy of lighting zones to be collectively controlled with other applications within a given occupancy group.\n\nthe local control interface 12 includes means for transmitting control messages to the LCU to advise the LCU of the occupancy status of the lighting zones. This permits the local control interface 12 to control the occupancy status of the lighting zones in accordance with occupancy group schedules maintained on the local control interface 12 , as well as in accordance with other occupancy status changes, such as may be triggered by an access event. In operation, a change in occupancy status for a given zone, whether resulting from a schedule event or from another occupancy effecting event, is transmitted by the local control interface 12 to each LCU. Eight different command messages are used to discern between the eight lighting zones. For example, a first command message is used to communicate the occupancy status of zone 1 and a second command message is used to communicate the occupancy status of zone 2 .\n\neach LCU Upon receipt of the command message, each LCU reviews its database of lighting zone associations to determine if the command message is relevant to any of its circuits. If so, the LCU sets the on/off status of the appropriate circuit(s) in accordance with the occupancy status contained in the command message. Each LCU may also maintain a local back-up copy of the schedule to permit continued operation in the event of a local control interface or network failure.\n\nEach LCU also includes eight inputs used primarily for override switches.\n\nEach override switch can be associated with one or more lighting zones so that actuation of the switch affects the occupancy status of these lighting zones.\n\nthe lighting zone associations of the inputs are preferably set via the local control interface 12 , with each LCU maintaining a local database of the associations for each of its inputs.\n\nactuation of an override switch cause the associated LCU to determine the lighting zones to which the switch is a member and affect the on/off status of all circuits on the LCU associated with that lighting zone.\n\nthe LCU also sends a peer-to-peer message to all other LCUs on the network indicating the change in the occupancy status of the particular lighting zone.\n\nEach of these other LCUs then affects the on/off status of all circuits on that LCU that are associated with the specified lighting zone. This permits integration of override events between LCUs without intervention from the local control interface.\n\nVarious application controllers have the ability to send text-based alarms to the local control interface 12 to indicate extraordinary conditions, for example, several ACU alarms were described in the immediately preceding section on Access Control.\n\nthe local control interface 12 has the ability to display and store these alarms.\n\neach alarm includes a unit name, time/date of occurrence and up to 40 characters of text.\n\nthe text field can be used to provide meaningful text based descriptions of the alarm event.\n\na representation of the data structure of an alarm is shown in FIG. 18.\n\nthe local control interface 12 can be configured to provide an automated response when desirable, for example, the local control interface 12 can be programmed to repeatedly flash the lights in a zone in the event of a âdoor forcedâ alarm.\n\nthe local control interface and the application controllers operate in accordance with installed control software.\n\nappropriate control software is preloaded into the local control interface and the application controllers. In some applications, this may not be desirable or possible.\n\nthe local control interface 12 preferably includes means for storing a database of application controller software images and means for downloading the application controller software images into the application controllers.\n\nthe application controller software images will be downloaded into the application controller during the self-configuration process to provide the application controller with the applicable control software.\n\nthe local control interface 12 can, however, be used to download control software to the application controller even after self-configuration. This capability can be used to provide the initial installation of control software on an application controller or to update/upgrade the existing control software on an application controller.\n\nthe local control interface preferably includes means for downloading the control s"
