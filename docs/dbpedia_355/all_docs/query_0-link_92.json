        "text": "Hello,\n\nI am looking for advice from experts here. I have Honeywell Novar controller recently installed in our systems.\n\nCan I use any 3rd party cloud based BMS to integrate with Honeywell controllers? We also have multiple locations with other types of controllers.\n\nI see that many 3rd party BMS systems boast of integrating data from different controllers if they have BACnet enabled protocols. I have no idea how that works. Is this true and how easy/difficult it is?\n\nCan any guru here explain if I can invest in a 3rd party cloud based BMS that will be able to integrate the data from Honeywell controllers and see all data at a single platform. Kindly suggest if you have any good 3rd party platform that is useful and easy to use."
