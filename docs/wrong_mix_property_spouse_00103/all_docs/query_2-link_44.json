        "text": "Who Is The Suits Cast Dating?\n\nFrom Harvey and Donna to Mike and Rachel, Suits has featured some iconic couples and romances over the show’s nine-season run. But in the stars’ personal lives, who is the Suits cast dating and married to in real life? Keep reading to learn more about your favorite cast members’ relationships and families off-screen.\n\nSuits is USA Network’s legal drama created and written by Aaron Korsh. The show premiered in 2011 and ran for nine seasons until 2019. It follows Mike Ross (Patrick J. Adams), who uses his photographic memory to talk his way into a job as an associate working for Manhattan corporate lawyer Harvey Specter (Gabriel Macht). The show also stars Meghan Markle, Sarah Rafferty, Gina Torres, Rick Hoffman, and more.\n\nDespite ending five years ago, the show went viral over the summer when all eight seasons were released on Netflix in July 2023. Amidst the show’s renewed acclaim, Patrick J. Adams and Gabriel Macht reunited at the 81st Annual Golden Globes to present the award for Best TV Drama. They were also joined by their former co-stars Sarah Rafferty (who played Donna Paulsen) and Gina Torres (who portrayed Jessica Pearson).\n\nIf you’ve binge-watched all nine seasons of Suits or are currently watching the legal drama, you might be curious to know who the Suits cast is dating. Read on to learn about the real-life partners of Harvey Specter, Mike Ross, Louis Litt, Rachel Zane, and more.\n\nGabriel Macht (Harvey Specter)\n\nGabriel Macht is married to Australian actress Jacinda Barrett. The pair met on a blind date in 2000 and dated for four years before getting married in 2007. The couple share two children; they welcomed their daughter Satine Anais Geraldine in 2007 and their son Luca in 2014.\n\n“I’m a family man. My relationships with my wife and my kids are my priorities,” Macht told the New Zealand publication Woman’s Day in 2016. “And I have the upmost confidence in my love for my family and I prioritise that.”\n\nYou might recognize Barrett because she guest-starred as her husband’s on-screen love interest, Zoe Lawford, in Season 2 of Suits. Lawford was a former associate at Pearson Hardman and first appeared in Season 7, Episode 7, “Sucker Punch.”\n\nPatrick J. Adams (Mike Ross)\n\nSuits star Patrick J. Adams is happily married to Pretty Little Liars actress Troian Bellisario. The actors met in 2009 when they were cast opposite each other in the play Equivocation. Most of the couple’s relationship was long-distance, as Adams and Bellisario were filming across the country for their respective shows.\n\n“It’s a challenge, but it’s kind of perfect because we’re such analytic, hyper-intelligent people that sometimes just to be in each other’s faces all the time might have been too much for us,” Bellisario told People in 2013, adding: “We’re really growing!”\n\nThe couple eventually tied the knot in December 2016. A few years later, they welcomed their first daughter, Aurora, in 2018 and their second daughter, Elliot, in 2021.\n\nLike Macht’s wife Jessica, who guest-starred on Suits, Bellisario also played her husband’s former love interest in the legal drama. We first met Claire Bowden in the Season 4, Episode 14 flashback episode, “Fork in the Road,” a few years before Mike Ross started working at Pearson Hardman.\n\nRachel Zane (Meghan Markle, The Duchess of Sussex)\n\nMeghan Markle officially joined the royal family when she and Prince Harry wed in May 2018. Suits announced Markle’s exit from the show in November 2017 after she got engaged to Prince Harry. “I don’t see it as giving anything up. I just see it as a change. It’s a new chapter, right?” Markle said in a joint BBC interview with Harry in 2017. “I’ve ticked this box, and I feel very proud of the work I’ve done there, and now it’s time to work with [Harry] as a team.”\n\nMeanwhile, in his January 2023 memoir Spare, Prince Harry noted that he was unhappy with his decision to watch Markle’s character have sex with another man in Suits. Harry wrote that he “witnessed her and a castmate mauling each other in some sort of office or conference room.” Harry then joked, “It would take electric-shock therapy to get those images out of my head.”\n\nNearly two years after their nuptials, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex announced their decision to depart from the royals in January 2020. Since then, they’ve relocated to California and welcomed their son, Archie, and daughter, Lilibet.\n\nRick Hoffman (Louis Litt)\n\nIt’s currently unknown whether Rick Hoffman is in a relationship, as the actor has chosen to keep his personal life out of the public eye.\n\nHowever, the 53-year-old actor is the father of a son named Cole, born in December 2014. “The love of my life turns 8 today! Still excited when I pull up to the house. Hope it never changes:) Happy, Healthy Birthday Cole!!! I love you more than anything!!!” he penned on Instagram to celebrate his son’s birthday.\n\nHoffman also shared this sweet photo snuggling his son with the caption: “The best feeling in the world…#fatherhood #heartburst.”\n\nGina Torres (Jessica Pearson)\n\nSuits star Gina Torres was married to Black-ish actor Laurence Fishburne for 14 years before splitting up in September 2017. Fishburne officially filed to divorce the 9-1-1: Lone Star actress in November of that year.\n\nWith heavy hearts, Laurence and I quietly separated and began the dissolution of our marriage in the early fall of last year,” Torres said in a statement to Us Weekly. “There are no bad guys here. Only a love story with a different ending than either one of us had expected.” The actress continued, “Happily, however, our family remains intact and we will continue to raise our daughter together with love and joy and awe. As well as raise each other up with respect and love and the continued understanding that we’re in this together, if not side by side.”\n\nThe now-divorced couple, who appeared on-screen together in The Matrix Reloaded and Hannibal, share one daughter, Delilah, born in 2008.\n\nSarah Rafferty (Donna Paulsen)\n\nSarah Rafferty has been married to her husband, Santtu Seppälä, for 23 years. According to People, the couple met at Yale University when Rafferty pursued an MFA in acting and Seppälä a degree in finance.\n\nThe couple dated for a few years before making it official with a wedding on June 23, 2001. The actress celebrated her 20th anniversary with her husband in 2021. “Two decades in, still mugging. Happy 20th Anniversary, Santtu. Thank you for the “hope, coffee and poetry…..” she wrote on Instagram.\n\nThe couple welcomed their first daughter, Oona Gray, in 2007, followed by their youngest daughter, Iris Friday, in 2012. The actress has shared pictures of her family over the years, from masking up during a road trip in 2020 to birthday tributes for her daughters."
