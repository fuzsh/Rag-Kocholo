        "text": "Love is in the air for Extended Family’s Abigail Spencer.\n\nHow to Watch\n\nWatch Extended Family on NBC and Peacock.\n\nSpencer recently opened up about the new guy in her life and her hopes for a romantic Valentine’s Day this year while speaking to PEOPLE at the 2024 SCAD TVfest to promote her new NBC comedy, Extended Family.\n\n“My boyfriend lives in Spain, so I already gave him the hint. I was like, ‘Is Valentine’s a big day in Spain? Because it is here,” she said.\n\nWho is Abigail Spencer’s new boyfriend?\n\nAlthough Spencer didn’t mention her boyfriend by name, she shared that the two have been dating for four months. She also gave a few clues to the mystery man’s identity in an Instagram Story capturing the events of the weekend.\n\nSpanish CEO Oscar Valls appeared in a photo alongside her Extended Family costars Donald Faison, Jon Cryer, and showrunner Mike O’Malley. Valls was also tagged in a series of photos the Suits alum posted to Instagram and he shared the images in his own Instagram Story, according to the outlet.\n\nSo just who is Valls? According to his LinkedIn profile, he’s the founder of Farmbrots, an indoor farming company.\n\nHe also had his hand in the hospitality industry as the founder of Bird House, a bed and breakfast in Barcelona, co-founder of Bravo Beach, and co-founder of Pau Barcelona.\n\nValls told the Urban Vine he made the shift to urban farming during the pandemic when the hospitality industry was facing significant challenges.\n\nPhoto: Getty Images\n\n“The origin of Farmbrots is rooted in a challenging personal moment during the pandemic,” he shared. “At the time, I was facing the harsh reality of witnessing my other businesses in the hotel industry crumble. Faced with the possibility of losing everything I had built over the past decade and like the rest of the world in lockdown, I decided to channel the uncertainty into seeking new ideas with sustainable impact.”\n\nRELATED: Abigail Spencer Reflects on Suits' Streaming Success: \"I'm Way More Famous Now\"\n\nFrom the look of his Instagram page, he’s also an adventurer, often posting exotic photos from around the world including skiing at the Arctic Circle, leaping into the ocean in Peru, and surfing in the Maldives.\n\nAbigail Spencer on Doing Extended Family\n\nSpencer has had a busy year herself as one of the stars of NBC’s new hit comedy, Extended Family. Spencer plays Julia, a happily divorced mom of two trying to navigate the challenges of co-parenting with her ex Jim, played by Cryer, and her new fiancé, Trey, played by Faison.\n\nTo ease the transition for the children, the unconventional family shares a “nest” where the children always stay, while each parent rotates in and out for their parenting time.\n\nSpencer told PEOPLE she’s able to draw from her own experience with divorce as she takes on the new character. Spencer was once married to business executive Andrew Pruett, but the two decided to call it quits in 2013. The couple share a 15-year-old son, Roman.\n\nPhoto: NBC\n\n“It's hard, but I think the best art is personal,” she said. “It feels like it's happening to you and you get to project your life onto it. I think for my son, who grew up going to two different homes, like oh, he can scold us later, ‘Why didn't you do that?’ I think all of us have said it's nice to put something on the air where it just presents doing something a little differently and just to create more conversation around it.”\n\nShe added that the show is really “about family,” rather than divorce."
