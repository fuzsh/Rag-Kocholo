        "text": "Dolly Varden Char Bioelectrical Impedance Modeling May 2013 The objective of this research is to build and validate BIA models for Dolly Varden. Fish (N=192) were sampled from overwintering grounds in the Ivishak River, located on the North Slope of Alaska during sampling events in September of 2009 to 2011. In the field, fish were sacrificed, weighed, measured, and BIA measures of resistance and reactance were collected. Samples were transported to University of Alaska, Fairbanks laboratories, where they were analyzed for proximate content using standardized methods (AOAC 1990). All subsets multiple linear regression will be used to generate predictive equations relating BIA data to laboratory derived estimates of lipid, protein, water, and ash. The validity of these models will be accessed by using k-fold validation to generate diagnostic statistics such as root mean squared error and the PRESS statistic. Estimating the physiological well-being, or condition of an individual fish or a population is a common goal of fisheries research. Traditionally, condition has been estimated from aspects of an individual’s length or weight. Because lipid is the main form of accumulated energy and respiratory substrate in fish, such indices infer lipid content from individual morphology assuming changes in morphology are met with proportional changes in lipid (Shulman 1974). However, this assumption may be false within capital breeding Arctic fish such as Dolly Varden due to the size and magnitude of energy cycles they experience throughout the year (Glass 1989). During periods of physiological stress or starvation, such as overwintering and migration, lipid may be metabolized at rates faster than water (energetically inert) is lost (Brek 2008). Other researchers suggest further that lost lipid may actually be replaced with water (Shearer 1994). Such physiological processes aid in the maintenance of individual body weight and morphology despite potentially large changes in lipid and energy content. Because morphological condition indices cannot distinguish lipid weight from water weight they are less sensitive to changes in the lipid and energy content of Dolly Varden. While proximate analysis may permit the estimation of proximate constituents such as lipid and water directly, the procedure is time consuming, expensive, and requires the sacrifice of the subject. What is needed is a link between coarse morphological approaches, and costly, more complicated but sensitive lab-based methods. Recent research using bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) suggests that this technique may provide such a link (Cox and Hartman 2005). Previous research investigating temporal and spatial trends in Dolly Varden condition using traditional metrics has had limited success (Gallaway et al. 1991; Brown 2008). Following development, Dolly Varden BIA models will permit rapid, non-lethal, and high quality estimates of lipid, and other proximate constituents in the field. Relative to morphometric based indices, the greater precision of these condition data should facilitate more effective change detection in both time and space and aid in the formation of species-habitat relationships that are paramount to understanding and predicting the biological consequences of climate change. Sockeye salmon competition on Afognak Island June 2014 Determine if stickleback and juvenile sockeye complete for the same food resources. None Chinook and coho salmon productivity on the Unalakleet River December 2016 Understand how marine subsidies from pink and chum salmon runs affect the productivity of Chinook and coho salmon. None Fish movement on the Arctic Coastal Plain September 2014 We aim to understand where fish move among habitats, and identify the habitats crucial for spawning and feeding. None Mitigating Marine Nutrient Loss in the Upper Snake River Basin December 2012 This project looks at how nutrient loss from suppressed salmon runs in the Columbia River Basin are affecting streams, and how nutrient mitigation measures help restore productivity. None Invertebrate Productivity in the Context of Climate Change September 2015 Aim is to determine how food webs that support migratory birds are influenced by nutrient flux and warming from climate change. None Bioenergetics and habitat use of wetlands by fish of the Arctic Coastal Plain June 2015 Understand how fish utilize habitats and shape the food webs which support them. Project has a major climate change component, related to wetting and drying of aquatic habitats. None Assess reference condition of small-mammal population dynamics and genetic variation prior to Ambler Road development and ongoing climate change September 2028 Small mammals play a vital role in boreal and Arctic ecosystems in Alaska. As local and resident, keystone species in food webs with quick generation times and small home ranges, small mammals are sensitive bioindicators of local disturbance, including climate change and development. In Denali National Park, small mammals have been studied for 30 years (1992-2022) as part of the Central Alaska Network Long-Term Monitoring program. Over many years, rain, snow, and growing season temperatures were strongly associated with variation in plant primary productivity. Both vole and hare abundance cycles showed a four-fold change in amplitude (peak) that corresponded to long-term changes in primary productivity. As climate change continues to affect temperatures, primary productivity and growing season, we can expect changes in small-mammal populations movements, ranges and cycles that may drastically influence boreal and Arctic ecosystems. Our project will compare reference condition data - genetic diversity, genetic structure - as well as population demographic data among Denali, Gates of the Arctic, and Kobuk Valley national parks. These data are central for comparative research and informed dialogue with industry to establish pre-development mitigation strategies by providing pre-development snapshot of population status preceding future climate change and development.

This project will improve understanding of Chinook salmon and the ability to manage Chinook populations and their habitats for sustainability. None Circumarctic Rangifer Monitoring March 2011 Initiate a study to determine how projected changes in abundance and quality of caribou forage plants will effect seasonal changes in body weight and fat and protien composition in caribou and reindeer. None Ectoparasites of salmon using eDNA August 2023 Ectoparasites on fish are a source of stress for individuals and may become more prevalent with climate change and associated water warming. However, the distribution of these parasites, such as copepod \"sea lice\", are largely unknown. This is especially the case in Alaskan waters, despite the economic and cultural importance of Pacific salmon. In cooperation with fish pathologists, physiologists, and veterinarians with the University of Alaska Fairbanks Museum of the North and the Colloredo State University Veterinary Science Summer Fellowship program, this project assesses the distribution of fish parasites and pathogens on museum reference specimens and seeks to demonstrate the effectiveness of eDNA as a monitoring tool for these organisms.

None Ecology of Smith's Longspurs in Northern Alaska December 2015 The overall goal of this project is to contribute to conservation strategies for Smith’s Longspurs by further refining our knowledge of their breeding ecology in Alaska, using the unique availability of individually marked birds and baseline data at the Arctic Refuge. Our objectives are to (1) document natal and breeding site fidelity using resightings of individually banded birds, (2) estimate nest survival and analyze covariates that influence nest survival (e.g. habitat and temporal factors), and (3) continue to collect and analyze life history information to better understand breeding parameters such as breeding phenology, adult survival and movements, nesting chronology, habitat preferences, and nest site requirements.

None Juvenile salmon growth and heat stress September 2025 The goal of this project is to understand how juvenile salmon growth in freshwater habitats is influenced by water temperatures and thermal stress. The sample collection for this project is on Chinook and coho salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha and O. kisutch, respectively) in and around the Deshka River, a culturally, ecologically, and economically important salmon fishery in south-central Alaska. This research will be the thesis project for a Masters student in Fisheries at the University of Alaska Fairbanks. We will estimate recent growth from juvenile salmon otoliths and feeding success from stomach fullness for analysis with existing water temperature and thermal stress data. Results are expected to be broadly applicable to the Deshka River and also to salmon management throughout the state. Project results will inform key land and fisheries management decisions.

Resist-Accept-Direct (RAD) decisionmaking September 2023 As climate change alters ecosystems worldwide, managers are faced increasingly with challenges in how to manage for its impacts. The Resist-Accept-Direct framework provides a guide for decisionmaking about how, when, and where to choose to implement actions for climate resiliency in ecosystems. This project seeks to apply the RAD framework to river ecosystems worldwide, specifically including the Mississippi River. It is carried out in collaboration with partners across USGS, other Bureaus in the Department of the Interior, and elsewhere in Federal, State and Tribal governance, in addition with non-profit groups. The research helps inform decisions about river management in the face of ongoing climate change.

Stream restoration effectiveness assessment October 2024 Stream restoration is a burgeoning industry in Alaska for restoring and remediating aquatic environmental degradation. However, assessment of the effectiveness of stream restoration techniques and the tools used to monitor streams is lacking. This project will work in collaboration with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, U.S., Bureau of Land Management, and university and non-profit groups to assess stream restorations in Interior Alaska using the novel Stream Quantification Tool. We will report on the functional lift, or suite of ecological services provided by restoration relative to unrestored conditions.

Wildfire effects on aquatic biodiversity measured using eDNA September 2023 Boreal ecosystems in Alaska are at the forefront of global climate change, and one of the primary impacts of this changing climate is an increase in the prevalence, magnitude, and severity of wildfire. Although less headline-grabbing than stories of burned forests, freshwaters also experience wildfire effects through mudslides and other sedimentation increases, temperature changes due to lack of shading, nutrient and pH effects from ash inputs, and alterations to stream hydrology and geomorphology due to watershed change. Understanding the biodiversity of fish and macroinvertebrates is essential to a quantitative appraisal of freshwater conditions, including assessment of ecosystem impacts to disturbance such as wildfire. Nonetheless, such assessment is generally lacking in broad swaths of Alaska. The advent of environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding using next-generation sequencing methods holds exciting potential for broad-scale assessments of freshwater biodiversity in such situations. In this study, I propose to use eDNA metabarcoding samples, including primers developed specifically for the quantification of aquatic macroinvertebrates and fish, to assess wildfire influence on freshwater biodiversity at a regional scale within Interior Alaska.

Analysis of lake water quality data in Southwest Alaska National Parks August 2024 This project will assess the status and trends of water quality in lakes within the Southwest Alaska Inventory and Monitoring Network (SWAN). This will be a synthesis project, with little or no new data collection anticipated directly as part of this project. These data originate from within SWAN national parks managed by the U.S. National Park Service, with collection carried out by NPS staff and representing up to a 10-year dataset, with lakes re-sampled semi-regularly across years. Research under this award will be guided by the following questions: 1) To what extent do lakes, or samples within lakes, group along an identifiable gradient, and what environmental or other conditions drive these groupings? 2) Are there apparent intra- and interannual trends or trajectories of water quality change within and across lakes? 3) Can future trends be forecast across lakes and interpolated within lakes given predicted future environmental conditions, using the multi-lake network to infer conditions even in cases where data are sparse?

Small Mammal Disease Dynamics in Interior Alaska December 2025 Disease prevalence in small mammals is largely unknown in Alaska, with little monitoring occurring throughout the state. The potential for disease transmission between small mammals and domestic animals is high, and the subsequent potential for transmission to humans poses a legitimate health concern in Alaska. We are surveying small mammal populations near concentrations of domestic animals (sled dogs and livestock) to determine if disease prevalence in small mammals is affected by proximity and exposure to domestic animals. This will be the first coordinate survey effort for small mammal disease exposure in Alaska.

Food web dynamics in arctic streams September 2013 Identify key prey types and their sources in Arctic stream food webs. Measure prey utilization by fishes in selected aquatic habitats. None Developing ecological escapement goals for Pacific salmon: Role of marine derived nutrients in the health and sustainability of resident and anadromous fishes of the Yukon drainage December 2010 The objectives of this study are to determine: 1) the biological extent of marine-derived nutrients (MDN) presence in riverine ecosystems (e.g., measure how much MDN are sequestered by fishes and other biota), 2) the magnitude of MDN influence across broad geographic scales (e.g., initially across the Yukon Delta, Yukon Flats, and into Canada within the Yukon River drainage), 3) if certain fishes benefit from the spawning runs of others (e.g., do chinook juveniles and resident fishes benefit from chum runs?), 4) roles and significance of MDN in fish health, and 5) if there is a spawner density-dependent response by consumers (e.g., do more spawners equate to greater food web effects?). Investigators predict that: 1) MDN are critically important to riverine biota across broad geographic scales, 2) fish species benefit from the spawning runs of others, 3) MDN improves fish health (e.g., fish condition, and lipid and fatty acid content), and 4) there is a density-dependent response (fish in habitats with higher spawner densities benefit more than those in habitats with fewer spawners). Data from this study will contribute to the long-term goal of constructing ecological escapement models that predict the levels of salmon returns necessary for supporting fish, wildlife and plant species, and ecosystem sustainability in Alaska. None The effects of wetland management and landscape characteristics on black tern and associated species breeding colonies December 2010 Information needs identified by the USFWS include identification and inventory of existing colonies and breeding habitat, and the effects of wetland management and restoration; development of population monitoring protocols will also be addressed. The objectives of this study are to: (1) evaluate information collected for the USFWS Species Assessment for its potential to determine habitat availability across the breeding range of Black Terns; Researchers will use a subsample of wetlands within the Black Tern breeding range to: (2) inventory existing Black Tern colonies; (3) inventory and assess large-scale habitat characteristics; (4) make preliminary evaluations of the effects of wetland management and restoration on breeding populations of this species. Researchers will use information collected during this study to assist in the development of standardized monitoring protocol. None Diet of glaucous gulls on Alaska's north Slope September 2011 Describe Glaucous Gull diet, including spatial and temporal variation, during the breeding season on Alaska's North Slope. 2) Quantify relative gull consumption of anthropogenic foods and of prey species of concern. 3) Determine the effects of development on local gull reproductive output. 4) Evaluate the effect of diet on gull reproductive output. None Avian ecology in northern AK within a changing environment August 2012 This project proposes to provide a framework in which to better understand the ecology, including habitat requirements, of northern Alaska's avian species. The overall goal of this project is to research the distribution, abundance and life history of avian species of concern in northern Alaska. Task 1: Initial work will focus on Smith's Longspurs in the Arctic Refuge with the goal of expanding to other species and breeding areas in northern Alaska. Preliminary objectives include: - Refine methods to measure abundance and distribution of Smith's Longspurs. - Develop habitat-based models to predict the abundance and distribution of Smith's Longspurs. - Collect life history information to better understand breeding parameters such as nesting chronology, nest success/survival, habitat preferences and nest site requirements. Further research is needed to enhance understanding of the factors determining spatial and temporal use of coastal habitats within the Arctic Refuge. Information about how, why, when and where shorebirds are using these habitats will allow managers to address protection for shorebirds and other coastal resources, and will direct mitigation efforts in response to climate change and direct anthropogenic stressors. This study will fund a PhD student through UAF to: a) assess abundance, distribution, and species composition of shorebirds staging in coastal areas prior to fall migration, b-c) quantify movement patterns (both within the staging period and relative to breeding location) and residency times of pre-migratory shorebirds at staging sites, and d) examine physical characteristics and quantify forage for comparisons among staging areas on the coast. [Note, Task 2 will be conducted pending task 1 results and determination of available funding by additional sources] None At-Sea Location of Juvenile and First-Year King Eiders, dated Aporil 3, 2008 December 2011 The goal of this study is to test the hypothesis that population level effects or changes in fish condition can be described relative to thermal habitat and coastal currents, derived from optical and thermal infrared remote sensing data from the nearshore area of the Beaufort Sea. Several objectives make up this larger goal and need to be accomplished to fulfill the intent of this study: 1) biological sampling of fish; 2) collection of thermal data through remote sensing; and 3) the analysis and synthesis of the biological data with remote sensing data None Partitioning soil respiration along moisture gradients in Alaskan landscapes August 2012 Our objective is to develop a set of physical (temperature, moisture, radiation) and biogeochemical (e.g. C flux and quality) data that will facilitate accurate models of C exchange in boreal landscapes. None Carbon responses along moisture gradients in Alaskan landscapes June 2010 The interaction of large wildfires with permafrost is of central concern because of longer growing seasons and increased drought. The investigators hypothesize that fire may act as a trigger to the rapid degradation of permafrost in Interior Alaska. How carbon responds to changing climate and fire will affect carbon dynamics will likely depend on interactions with soil moisture, which is quite variable in Alaskan landscapes. In this study they are assessing carbon reserves and their interaction with fire and permafrost along soil moisture gradients in Alaskan landscapes. The investigators are currently developing a new suite of ecosystem modeling tools which are capable of simulating the linkages between fire, permafrost degradation and ecosystem dynamics. These models require robust sets of data that can be used to parameterize these models as well as to test their limitations and utility. The main task to accomplish the above objective is to develop a set of physical (temperature, moisture, radiation) and biogeochemical (e.g. C flux and quality) data that will facilitate accurate models of C exchange in boreal landscapes. None Assessing the role of deep soil organic carbon in interior Alaska: Data, models, and spatial/temporal dynamics January 2011 Develop a more complete understanding of the carbon dynamics of northern high-latitude ecosystems at several scales: plot, landscape, region (e.g., Interior Alaska), pan-boreal (Alaska, Canada, Russia, and Scandinavia). This study will provide a best-practices spatial assessment of soil carbon in Alaska that can be used by a number of modeling and experimental studies that address the vulnerability and fate of soil carbon. None Monitoring the body condition of caribou in late winter: developing and evaluating a \"hands-off\" approach June 2010 This pilot study will develop and evaluate the noninvasive technique derived from captive trials for assessing body condition of wild populations of caribou in Alaska. These data are also part of larger project comparing body condition of Rangifer spp. across North America which will provide baselines for regional and international monitoring programs. Future work will examine variation in demography (e.g., age and sex structure), resource availability and quality, and reproductive success in relation to changes in body condition at the individual and population levels. None Projected effects of climate-induced vegetation changes on caribou (Rangifer tarandus) energetics in northern Alaska September 2016 1) Employ the existing DVM and a suite of climate scenarios (present to 2100; IPCC, 2007) to a) simulate possible future changes in the seasonal biomass of aboveground non-woody tissue of various plant functional types (e.g. lichen, sedge, Salix) that are accessible to Rangifer; b) match DVM output plant functional type seasonal biomass to input functional types used in the CARMODEL; c) match output summary seasons (currently months) to the input seasons of the CARMODEL (e.g. calving, post-calving, late summer); d) explicitly track projected changes in growing degree days (GDD) and use the GDD:digestibility relationships developed by Finstad (2008) to project the effects of warming on seasonal forage quality by plant functional type. 2) Use the projected changes in biomass and digestibility of caribou forages through time (present to 2100) derived from the DVM in (1) to estimate the implications of this suite of climate scenarios on the seasonal patterns of fat and protein deposition and use by caribou for maintenance and growth throughout the year. 3) Compare and contrast the implications of climate-induced changes in forage biomass and quality on fat and protein dynamics in two groups of caribou with characteristically different diets at calving: a) caribou that calve in the wetter portions of the coastal plain (Central Arctic, Teshekpuk), and b) caribou that calve in uplands and drier portions of the coastal plain (Western Arctic, Porcupine). 4) Collect supplemental estimates of diet and forage quality for herds as necessary. Summer diets are relatively well known for all herds. Fall, and early and late winter-spring diets are relatively unknown and will require field collection of fecal pellets and microhistological analyses. Some seasonal forage will require nutrient analyses to establish baseline conditions. None Magnitude and rates of lake drying in wetlands on National Wildlife Refuges in AK January 2011 Refuge wetlands support millions of waterfowl and shorebirds and produce hundreds of thousands of ducklings, goslings and shorebirds annually that have been recovered in nearly all states, 8 Canadian provinces and other countries. Climate change could alter the fundamental nature of Alaskan refuges. Riordan (2005) found significant loss of lakes in wetlands on several Interior Alaska refuges; however, the geographic scope and magnitude of lake losses in Alaskan refuges have not been described. Magnitude and rates of lake drying have not been described across an E-W gradient (e.g., Yukon Delta - Tetlin NWRs) or N-S gradient (e.g., Izembek - Arctic NWRs). Finally, understanding the amount and rate of lake losses in wetlands across Alaska refuges will be essential to predicting potential effects on the distribution, abundance and productivity of waterbirds, particularly ducks and geese. Crucial proactive first steps toward understanding this potential problem are to: 1) fully characterize the heterogeneity in the magnitude and rate of lake drying in Alaskan Refuge wetlands, 2) identify differential characteristics of lakes that are drying and those that are not, 3) estimate whether change in total surface water area in wetlands (open and closed-basin lakes) occurs at the same rate of decline as for closed-basin lakes, and 4) assess the influence of fire on lake drying in refuge wetlands. Tasks: 1. Complete a statewide estimate of the heterogeneity in closed-basin lake drying initiated by Riordan (2005) 2. Estimate the rate of change in total surface water and compare this to the rates of change documented for closed-basin lakes in National Wildlife Refuges during the same time period, 1950-2002 (see Riordan 2005). 3. Document factors associated with variability in the magnitude and rate of drying among closed-basin lakes in study areas in National Wildlife Refuges (see Riordan 2005). Document the effects of wildfire on open water dynamics in refuge wetlands. None Implications of climate variability for optimal and adaptive management in wetland systems January 2012 1) Formally estimate the multi-scale temporal and spatial variance structure in a suite of putatively climate driven habitat metrics (e.g. lake drying, river flow, flooding frequencies), emphasizing available legacy datasets from remote sensing, river gauges, and other pertinent sources; 2) Formally evaluate the implications of the variance in climate-driven habitat trends for optimal monitoring strategies and subsequent design of adaptive management programs, specifically addressing the spatial and temporal intensity of monitoring necessary to estimate whether populations have demonstrated biologically meaningful changes and management activities have been effective or not; 3) Collaboratively explore the implications of the variance in climate-driven habitat trends with two samples of refuges--one group from Region 7 and one group from Region 6--that differ in their a) emphasis on lacustrine/palustrine (Region 7) or riverine (Region 6) aquatic habitats for USFWS trust species and therefore b) their stakeholder interests, inherent environmental variability, degree of climate driven change, and available management actions. 4) Collaboratively explore within- and between-region assessments of the strategic implications of the variance in climate related habitat drivers to the management activities of long-term a) planning, b) budgeting, and c) selection of potential actionable management. [note: work on the attached proposal conducted by non-CRU Federal employees, such as USGS Jane Austen and USFWS personnel, will be conducted outside the purview of this RWO] None Implications of climate change for biodiversity in Yukon River Basin wetlands: Yukon Flats National Wildlife Refuge as a test case May 2014 The overall goal of the biological component of the Yukon River Basin (YRB) science plan is to estimate the potential effects of climate induced lake change on terrestrial and aquatic species richness and abundance that is relevant to local and national users. None Factors Limiting Population Growth of Unhunted Dall’s Sheep December 2025 Despite nearly a decade free of harvest pressure, sheep populations in northwest Alaska have not rebounded as anticipated. Identifying the factors that continue to repress these populations will aid in the general understanding of Dall sheep ecology and help inform how sheep populations, at the margins of their range, can be sustainably managed in the future.

Mortality will be monitored via movement data and mortality sites will be visited as soon as possible to attempt to determine mortality cause. If possible, tissue samples will be collected for additional analysis. Health assessment will be conducted during capture and biological samples collect to analysis for disease, genetics, pregnancy, and nutritional limitation. Collared ewes will be radiotracked with fixed-wing aircraft weekly between May and June to determine lambing rates using the presence of a lamb at heel.<br><br>This study will be the first to quantify habitat use patterns, survival rates, and health of sheep in these herds. This project will provide ADFG with the information needed in order to manage both of these sheep herds in order to improve population trajectory. Synthesizing Ungulate Movement and Migrations Across Alaska December 2025 Ungulate movements and migrations are crucial behavioral processes that have a direct impact on harvest and habitat management programs. The availability of migratory ungulates to harvest has large implications for subsistence harvest programs, and the identification of migration corridors and habitat factors associated with movements and movement barriers is a challenging but critical question in the face of changing environmental systems.<br><br>Using monitoring data from caribou and moose populations from throughout Alaska, this project will identify unifying factors related to ungulate migrations while simultaneously providing individual herd managers with the information and tools needed to appropriately manage ungulates. Existing GPS and satellite telemetry data from multiple caribou herds throughout Alaska (Western Arctic, Teshekpuk, Mulchatna, Nelchina, Fortymile) will be used to parameterize movement models that will provide a mechanistic understanding of migration paths and cues, while existing telemetry data from moose in multiple Game Management Units will be used to parameterize models to help identify seasonal movements and corridors.<br><br>Aside from improving our understanding of ungulate migrations across Alaska, this project will develop a unified data flow and analytical framework for the various collaring efforts that are ongoing throughout Alaska. The wide variety of collar manufacturers, data streams, fix rates, and data quality have thus made it challenging to develop unified analyses or data management protocols, and doing so will help improve the inference gained from myriad telemetry efforts but also decrease the turnaround time required to use these data to provide useful information to wildlife managers.

Deer Density Estimation and Habitat Use in Southeast Alaska December 2024 Sitka black-tailed deer are an important game species in southeast Alaska, and are a critical driver of predator population dynamics in the region. On Prince of Wales Island, where habitat management for deer is a major land use, it is critical to understand where deer occur on the landscape and how they respond to timber harvest. Moreover, our understanding of how predators (e.g. wolves) shape deer distribution on the landscape could have important implications for harvest and habitat management. <br><br>By utilizing an existing/ongoing deployment of remote cameras across Prince of Wales Island for wolf monitoring, we will develop single-season and multi-species occupancy models for black-tailed deer that quantify occupancy rates across the landscape and how these rates are affected by both habitat conditions and by the presence of predators. Additionally, we hope to be able to relate deer distribution and occupancy to in-situ estimates of snow depth calculated from remote camera images. Lastly, we will evaluate the utility of this sampling framework for estimating deer density across the entire island.<br><br>Monitoring of game species is exceptionally challenging in southeast Alaska, and the potential for multi-species monitoring frameworks could provide a cost-effective mechanism for assisting with harvest and/or habitat management decisions. This study will build upon previous research that has demonstrated that deer respond to habitat management in terms of browsing pressure by also linking overall occupancy rates and interactions with predators to habitat conditions.

Effects of Human Visitation on Bear Activity December 2024 The impacts of recreational activity on wildlife can be substantial. In areas with high concentrations of humans and wildlife, there may be high potential for human activity to negatively affect wildlife. At the Anan Observatory, near Wrangell, Alaska, the USDA Forest Service recently renovated their viewing platform at a substantial cost to the ranger district. The Anan Observatory is a highly regulated bear viewing site in the Tongass National Forest, with visitation controlled through a permit system, however the construction of a larger viewing platform has led to calls for increasing the number of permits, and thus the human visitation rates.<br><br>We will use remote cameras deployed at the observatory and at the upper falls, an area off limits to recreational visitation approximately 0.5-km upstream, to quantify bear activity patterns during the tourist season during the summers of 2022, 2023, and 2024. We will use a combination of occupancy modeling and activity patterns analysis to determine if activity levels differ between the control area (upper falls) and the observatory, and if bear activity is related to hourly human visitation rates. We will also use long-term monitoring data from the observatory to determine if chronic human visitation has affected bear feeding activity.<br> <br>The results of this study will provide the USDA Forest Service with important information that they can use to determine if increased permitting will have deleterious effects on bears at Anan Observatory. There is substantial financial pressure surrounding the management of the observatory, with a number of guiding services operating out of the town of Wrangell, and their financial security is contingent on a long-term management plan that maximizes the number of visitors without having any adverse effects on wildlife.

Salmon habitat and shoreline vulnerability to recreational boat wakes in Big Lake, Alaska September 2024 The Matanuska-Susitna Borough, in south-central Alaska, implements a successful cost share program to restore shorelines along freshwaters. However, landowners are concerned that an increase in recreational boating to create large wakes for jet skis and other watersports are undercutting these efforts, leading to increased erosion and potential sedimentation on vulnerable salmon habitat. This research aims to quantify the extent of this potential issue, both in terms of bank erosion and effects on salmon egg-laying habitat. It will inform potential future management decisions to limit ballast boat use for wake generation, and identify the shorelines and underwater habitats where implementing such actions might be most important for conservation. Key partners on the project include the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the Alaska Department of Fish and Game, as well as the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation and private landowners who implement the cost-share program. Results of this research will yield a model of shoreline and salmon egg-laying habitat vulnerability. Presentations to stakeholders are also anticipated as part of the management and decision-making process.

Central Alaska aquatic inventory & monitoring data synthesis June 2027 The purpose of this award is to assess the status and trends of freshwater communities and habitats in streams on Alaskan public lands utilizing a long-term water quality dataset. These data originate from within central Alaska national parks managed by the U.S. National Park Service as well as other lands in the region managed by the U.S. Bureau of Land Management. Research under this award will be guided by the following questions: To what extent can sites across Alaskan public lands be classified meaningfully based on a suite of shared environmental conditions, and do these classes, in turn, contain clearly defined ecological communities? How are species and habitat distributions altered across Alaskan public lands based on habitat conditions and expected environmental shifts under climate change or human use such as mining, and are certain ecological communities or habitats at particularly high risk of decline? Streams and rivers on public lands in central Alaska are subject to acute and increasing ecological stress from climate change and in-stream mining. However, long-term trends in water quality and biomonitoring-relevant species are rarely assessed to determine how these stressors are affecting the ecological function of these aquatic habitats. The project is a collaboration of researchers and partners within the Department of the Interior, including the USGS, National Park Service, and Bureau of Land Management. Data synthesis will be aimed at delivering results that facilitate prediction of habitat and species population change as a result of ecological stressors in these central Alaskan freshwaters. Woody debris export to large rivers following wildfire September 2022 Large woody debris (LWD) in Interior Alaska provides fish habitat and serves as a human fuel source while also posing a danger for river navigation and infrastructure. However, there is limited understanding of the extent to which wildfire may affect recruitment of LWD, especially into larger rivers. Because wildfire risk and frequency are increasing, understanding its impacts on LWD recruitment into rivers is becoming more important as a freshwater management concern. In this study I will quantify the magnitude of LWD export out of smaller streams into large rivers in Interior Alaska and explore how this recruitment is affected by wildfire. The results of this study will underscore how fish habitat and other factors associated with LWD may change as Interior Alaska experiences more wildfire.

Broadly, the results of this study will underscore how fish habitat and other factors associated with LWD may change as Interior Alaska experiences more wildfire. Wildlife Resource Management on BLM Lands in Alaska September 2024 The Wildlife Program of the Bureau of Land Management is responsible for wildlife and habitat maintenance, conservation, and restoration throughout much of Alaska. This work is often conducted in cooperation with federal and state partners. Much of the work that BLM has conducted in recent years in interior Alaska has focused on habitat management and wildlife monitoring with a focus on a variety of wildlife species ranging from ungulates to raptors. This work has led to a variety of existing and current data streams that contain valuable information for management planning. In collaboration with BLM wildlife biologists are providing technical assistance for federal land management and research by developing a suite of geospatial coverages, queryable databases, analyses, and technical reports based on existing BLM inventory and monitoring programs to aid in the identification of trends in habitat conditions and wildlife populations. Specific products include 1) a spatially referenced database for long-term raptor monitoring in the Steese National Conservation Area, 2) a predictive model of caribou behavior based on activity patterns collected from satellite collars in the Fortymile caribou herd, 3) maps of seasonal movements and calving areas for moose in the White Mountains and Steese National Conservation Area, and 4) animations of caribou movements in relation to road access.

Moose Population Dynamics on the Seward Peninsula April 2024 Moose populations in portions of the Seward Peninsula have declined substantially since the early 2000's. The mechanism for this decline is unknown, as 6-month old moose in this region are among the heaviest (and presumably least nutritionally stressed) in the state of Alaska, yet lose the highest proportion of body weight over-winter compared to other moose populations. In collaboration with the Alaska Department of Fish and Game, we will be using a combination of radio-telemetry, demographic surveys, and both in-situ and remote-sensing derived metrics of forage to better understand the causal mechanism behind these declines in moose abundance. Our ultimate objective is to identify management actions that could ultimately reverse these declines and improve moose harvest opportunities in the region.

Evaluating Sources of Bias in Caribou Population Surveys December 2022 Understanding how to efficiently monitor wildlife is critical for proper harvest and habitat management. Monitoring of caribou herds in Alaska is almost exclusively accomplished through aerial surveys conducted during the pre-calving season. These surveys rely on locating radio-marked animals in order to find large aggregations of caribou across the landscape and using photo-census techniques to estimate group size. These data are then used in a specific mark-recapture framework, known as a Rivest model, to generate estimates of unseen caribou and, thus, total herd size. However, this approach is likely sensitive to grouping behavior (i.e. the distribution of group sizes among the entire herd) and both the total number and distribution of radio collared animals throughout the herd. The degree to which these factors influence the precision and accuracy of caribou abundance estimates is unknown and could have substantial impacts on our understanding and resulting management of caribou herds. <br>We will use empirical data on observed group sizes and collar distribution from 11 aerial surveys of the Western Arctic Herd and 12 aerial surveys from the Teshekpuk herd conducted between 1984 and 2019 to parameterize a series of simulations to evaluate accuracy and precision of Rivest estimates. We will use a parametric bootstrapping approach to simulate 10,000 realizations of true population size, group size distribution, and collar distribution from which we will use empirical estimates of detection probabilities to randomly detect both marked (with collars) and unmarked (without collars) groups. We will then use these simulated surveys results in a Rivest framework to generate estimates of abundance that we will compare to true (simulated) abundance for bias and confidence interval coverage. <br>By identifying the effects of grouping behavior and sample size on the reliability of Rivest estimates we hope to improve survey approaches and resulting inferences. Understanding situations in which Rivest estimates may be unreliable could 1) reduce surveys efforts by eliminating potential surveys conducted under non-ideal circumstances, and 2) lead to improved sampling protocols by identifying optimal sampling situations. Because caribou populations are known to exhibit substantial fluctuations, it is critical that inferences regarding population dynamics be derived from reliable estimates of abundance through time.

Wolf Abundance Estimation in Southeast Alaska December 2025 Wolves (Canis lupus ligoni) are a widespread carnivore in the temperate rain forests of southeastern Alaska. The areas in which wolves occur are characterized by rugged topography, closed canopy forests, and vast roadless areas. These factors make wolves exceptionally challenging to monitor. As an apex predator and a harvested species, wolves are among the most important species in the region in terms of management, yet the difficulties associated with monitoring wolves can hinder management actions. In this project we will be deploying an array of remote cameras throughout Prince of Wales Island to estimate wolf, black bear (Ursus americanus), and Sitka deer (Odocoileus hemionus sitkensis) densities using a combination of time-to-event and space-to-event modeling. This project will provide a framework for efficient and effective monitoring of these species throughout southeastern Alaska. In southeastern Alaska wolves are an ecologically important species and are considered a game species, meaning that they are harvested. In this landscape, wolves are very challenging to monitor. This project is a collaboration among researchers at the Alaska Department of Fish and Game, Oklahoma State University, and the Alaska Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Unit. using remote cameras, we will develop a robust monitoring framework for wolves, their competitors, and their prey, that can be readily implemented throughout southeastern Alaska. Downscaling recent and future freshwater processes across two large sub-Arctic watersheds: Assessing effects on freshwater habitat potential and productivity May 2026 Forthcoming Forthcoming Beaver and wildfire interactions in interior Alaska boreal watersheds December 2023 Wildfires are increasing in frequency, size, and severity across the boreal region of North America with significant effects on stream habitats for fish and wildlife communities. North American Beavers (<i>Castor canadensis</i>) are affected by and affect wildfires and are known to alter stream dynamics which impact organisms in and around those streams. Due to this, beavers could potentially act as a mechanism to magnify or reduce the effects of wildfires on aquatic systems with implications for ecological resilience and vulnerability in light of escalating wildfire regimes. Further, Alaska’s boreal region has diverse fisheries which are culturally and economically important and depend on the availability and suitability of freshwater habitats. Since freshwater habitat characteristics are driven by wildfire disturbance and beaver activities, understanding beaver/fire interactions is an important step to promote long-term sustainability of boreal fisheries. We are collaborating with the University of Alaska Fairbanks, USGS, U.S. Department of Defense, and the Alaska Fire Science Consortium to investigate this topic. The aim of our project is to develop models that include, 1) a spatially explicit model of beaver dam abundance and extent related to wildfire history, and 2) a habitat suitability model for Arctic Grayling (<i>Thymallus arcticus</i>); results will be used to estimate impacts of physical habitat changes on boreal fish species. Although model output can be used as stand-alone products for fire/fish/wildlife management decisions, our results will also be integrated into broader modeling efforts to assess the vulnerability of boreal ecosystems to changing climate and wildfire regimes.

Wolf-Caribou Interactions in the Fortymile Caribou Herd April 2024 We are evaluating the interactions of wolves and migratory caribou in the Fortymile herd. Using detailed information from GPS collared wolves and caribou, we are evaluating the relative influence of habitat conditions on seasonal movements and predator-prey dynamics. Additionally, we are evaluating the extent to which caribou movements affect wolf distribution on the landscape during aerial surveys in order to assess the potential for bias in population estimates.

Physiological Performance of Native and Invasive Northern Pike: Implications for Barrier Design in Invaded Systems December 2022 Northern Pike are an important native fish species north and west of the Alaska Mountain Range, but illegal introductions and the natural spread of pike have led to thriving invasive populations in Southcentral Alaska where they are predating on native or costly stocked salmon and trout. Although methods to remove pike in Alaska (e.g., rotenone and gillnetting) are effective under certain conditions, alternatives are needed in the greater Cook Inlet region where the risk that pike will reinvade after removal is high due to abundant and interconnected lakes and river systems. The placement of short waterfall barriers may be a potential option to prevent pike from reinvading salmon habitat. First, it is essential to determine the maximum leaping heights and swimming speeds of pike to then confidently design and test such barriers in the field. The objective of this study is to determine the maximum leaping heights, swimming speeds, and swimming endurance of pike, and how a variety of factors affect these physiological end-points in pike. We will collect pike from Fort Peck Reservoir in Montana, transport them to the Bozeman Fish Technology Center, and run leaping trials using an adjustable waterfall apparatus and swimming trials using both a swim tunnel and open channel flume. We will quantify how waterfall height, plunge pool depth, water temperature, fish size, and fish condition affect leaping abilities, and quantify how the latter three affect swimming speed and endurance maximums. Based on the literature, we expect to find that moderately sized pike will be the most successful at ascending the most difficult waterfall conditions (high waterfall heights with shallow pool depths), and water temperature will increase both leaping and swimming performance, while low fish condition will lead to reduced leaping and swimming performance. We will determine waterfall heights, pool depths, and water velocities that will both aerobically exhaust and prevent ascent of barriers by the most high-performing pike included in our trials. The results of this multi-experiment study will provide waterfall barrier parameters that theoretically will exhaust and prevent pike movement upstream. These specifications will be used to design and test barriers against invasive pike movement in the southcentral region to determine if they are a viable management option for pike in Alaska. If successful, the barrier designs can be modified and implemented in similar areas to target invasive pike while reducing impacts on native species.

Spawning Potential Ratio Assessment and Sensitivity Analysis Utilizing Estimates of Age at Maturity and Fecundity for Yelloweye Rockfish in Prince William Sound, Alaska December 2020 Yelloweye Rockfish (Sebastes ruberrimus) are a highly-valued catch in recreational and commercial fisheries throughout Alaska and make up an important portion of the subsistence harvest in communities along the Gulf of Alaska. However, no management or assessment strategies exist for Yelloweye Rockfish in Prince William Sound, and to date no abundance estimates have been made. In this study, we intend to create a framework or threshold for harvest that can be applied to the management of Yelloweye Rockfish in Prince William Sound. This project is a collaboration between the University of Alaska Fairbanks and the Alaska Department of Fish and Game. The recreational harvest of Yelloweye Rockfish in Prince William Sound has been increasing for over 15 years. This harvest coupled with commercial removals could result in harvest level that is already exceeding a sustainable level. The project is directed towards the conservation of this specific species in a particular region where it has economic and cultural importance.

Juvenile Chinook Salmon Movement, Overwinter Survival, and Outmigration Timing in the Chena River, Alaska May 2021 Since 2001, Chinook Salmon returning to the Yukon River drainage have been designated as a stock of concern by the Alaska Board of Fisheries, and the Chena River supports one of the largest spawning stocks in the Alaskan portion of the Yukon River drainage. The Chena River juvenile Chinook Salmon study will provide a method to estimate the outmigration timing and magnitude of smolt production from several rearing areas on a highly utilized stock. These estimates will lead to a mark-recapture study design that generates accurate and precise estimates of smolt abundance and marine survival that can improve the stock assessment models that are used to establish sustainable escapement goals. This study is a collaboration between the University of Alaska Fairbanks and Alaska Department of Fish and Game. This sampling design will generate accurate and precise estimates of timing into and out of the rearing areas as well as relative overwinter survival. These improved models will aid managers when making decisions about the Yukon River’s important subsistence, commercial, and sport fisheries. The project will also identify and characterize important fall rearing areas for juvenile Chinook Salmon. All components of this study are identified by the Yukon River Panel as information needs/actions. In addition, the ADF&G Chinook Salmon Initiative has identified juvenile Chinook Salmon information as an information gap for the Yukon River and the Chena River is one of the largest contributors to this stock.

This study is a collaboration between the University of Alaska Fairbanks and Alaska Department of Fish and Game. This sampling design will generate accurate and precise estimates of timing into and out of the rearing areas as well as relative overwinter survival. These improved models will aid managers when making decisions about the Yukon River’s important subsistence, commercial, and sport fisheries. The project will also identify and characterize important fall rearing areas for juvenile Chinook Salmon. All components of this study are identified by the Yukon River Panel as information needs/actions. In addition, the ADF&G Chinook Salmon Initiative has identified juvenile Chinook Salmon information as an information gap for the Yukon River and the Chena River is one of the largest contributors to this stock. Assessing the Resilience of Southeast Alaskan Salmon to Shifting Temperature and Discharge Regimes Using a Life-Cycle Perspective Coupled with Community-Based Monitoring December 2021 Salmon that spawn and rear in southeast Alaska (SEAK) forest streams are critically important to the region’s economic vitality and cultural identity. Environmental changes that compromise the ability of these streams to support salmon could have dramatic consequences for the region. In particular, there is concern that climate change could undermine the capacity of SEAK streams to support productive fisheries via alterations to water temperature and flow regimes via impacts on multiple freshwater life stages. Although life-cycle models that track salmon growth and survival across life stages have been developed for many at-risk populations throughout the southern range of salmon there have been limited efforts to expand this approach northward to Alaska. This project is a collaboration among the University of Alaska Fairbanks, U.S. Forest Service, and the Southeast Alaska Watershed Coalition. Results of our life cycle modeling for pink, chum, and coho salmon will increase the shared body of knowledge of Alaska watershed ecosystems and enhance community resilience. By presenting user-friendly versions of life-cycle models and model results to southeast Alaska community members and project partners, the project will enhance communities’ capacity to prepare for and adapt to environmental change by: 1) sharing knowledge of which systems are likely at-risk to help communities decide whether and how to mitigate and/or adapt to changes to local salmon resources; 2) training communities to use and adapt the life cycle models themselves, while continuing to serve as a resource for communities using the models; and 3) supporting community adaptation planning efforts via a climate scenarios planning session.

Boreal Aquatic Ecosystem Vulnerability to Fire and Climate Change May 2022 Fire is the dominant ecological disturbance process in boreal forests and is natural and widespread. However, fire frequency, size and severity are increasing in Alaska owing to climate warming. Interactions among fire, climate, permafrost, vegetation and hydrologic and watershed processes are poorly understood, yet critical for conservation and management of boreal aquatic habitats in a changing environment. Our research will address this challenge on and around DoD lands in interior Alaska by combining a detailed field experiment and measurements with an integrated suite of spatially- and temporally-explicit climate, terrestrial, and aquatic habitat models to better our understanding of the effects of fire and climate change on aquatic communities in interior Alaska boreal ecosystems. Collaborators include the University of Alaska Fairbanks, USGS, Alaska Department of Fish and Game, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, U.S. Department of Defense, and the Alaska Fire Science Consortium. The two primary goals of this project are to, 1) quantify fire effects on watershed- and local-scale aquatic habitats and the response of aquatic organisms on and adjacent to DoD lands in interior Alaska, and 2) integrate models that predict climate, fire, vegetation, hydrologic, and thermal dynamics to assess aquatic habitat and population vulnerability under a changing climate on and adjacent to DoD lands in interior Alaska. We will incorporate results from both objectives using a structured decision making (SDM) approach to define management objectives, decision options, management scenarios, and conduct cost-benefit analyses. The final product will be a web-based decision support tool developed to inform decision making. Fire is the dominant ecological disturbance process in boreal forests and is natural and widespread.

A rapid assessment method to estimate the distribution of juvenile Chinook salmon in an interior Alaska river basin August 2016 Identification and protection of water bodies used by anadromous species in Alaska are critical in light of increasing threats to fish populations, yet challenging given budgetary and logistical limitations. Non-invasive, rapid assessment sampling techniques may reduce costs and effort while increasing species detection efficiencies. This project was a collaboration between the University of Alaska Fairbanks and the Alaska Department of Fish and Game. The combination of habitat modeling, occupancy estimation based on eDNA, and snorkel surveys provided a useful, rapid-assessment method to predict and subsequently quantify the distribution of juvenile salmon in previously unsampled tributary habitats in the Chena River, Alaska. These methods will provide tools for managers to rapidly and efficiently map critical rearing habitats and prioritize sampling efforts to expand the known distribution of juvenile salmon in interior Alaska streams.

Landscape genetics, connectivity, and dispersal: predicting impacts of a top predator (Esox lucius) on salmonids in Southcentral Alaska September 2018 The introduction and expansion of invasive Northern Pike in southcentral Alaska have driven declines of salmonids in the Matanuska-Susitna Basin (MatSu) and led to the extirpation of a rare form of three spine stickleback in Praetor Lake near Wasilla. Because Northern Pike are piscivores that favor salmonids, their invasion has led to a change in the quality and quantity of salmon habitat in southcentral Alaska. Despite the strong conservation implications of the Northern Pike invasion, little work has been done to understand the ecology and potential evolution of the invader in its new range. This project is a collaboration among the University of Alaska Fairbanks, the USGS Northern Rocky Mountain Science Center, and the Alaska Department of Fish and Game. Given the broad extent of this landscape and limited resources available, determining the genetic diversity of pike in Alaska and the extent to which this top predator and juvenile salmon may overlap are crucial to predict future impacts of the invasion and inform management decisions through tools to aid identification and prioritization of critical areas.

Travel Support for Stakeholder Involvement in “Differential effects of climate- mediated forest change on the habitats of two ungulates important to subsistence and sport hunting economies” December 2019 This project will fund travel for face-to-face meetings with stakeholders (State and Federal agencies and Subsistence resource users) of the Western Alaska Landscape Conservation Cooperative (WALCC) in regard to a scientific modelling project. The modelling seeks to project the effects of climate on available forage for moose and caribou, as modified by snow cover and fire regimes, through 2100. The face-to-face meetings will present the goals and objectives of the modelling effort, seek identification of areas of particular concern for managers and subsistence users, and seek input on additional objectives that may be addressed by the modelling project. At the completion of the project, there will be a second set of face-to-face meetings where the results of the climate projections (maps of areas where forage is expected to improve or decline as a result of climate change) are delivered and stakeholders are consulted regarding the utility of the work to their issues and concerns and those issues and concerns will be noted in the final report for the modelling effort.

Connectivity for Landscape Conservation Design and Adaptation Planning November 2019 In the Northwest Boreal and Western Alaska region, climate is changing twice as fast as the global average. This is coupled with an increase in global demand for the region’s natural resources. Yet this region presently has less urbanization and development and therefore, fewer barriers to implementing a strategic landscape design for conservation (Chapin et al. 2004). Landscape conservation design in Alaska is an opportunity for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service’s, National Wildlife Refuge System (NWRS) to work collaboratively with partners to develop and implement a landscape approach that ensures our priority resources will have the capacity to cope with and respond to future change.

Chena River Juvenile Chinook Salmon Large Woody Debris Habitat Mapping September 2018 Large woody debris (e.g., logjams, rootwads; LWD) within the channel provide important rearing habitat for fishes, and especially for juvenile Chinook Salmon in interior Alaska rivers, including the Chena River. For juvenile salmon, LWD provides cover from predation, refuge from high flow velocities, and high quality habitat for invertebrate prey items. However, the distribution, abundance, and characteristics of LWD, particularly within stream reaches where juvenile Chinook Salmon are known to rear, have yet to be quantified in the Chena River basin. This project is a collaboration among the University of Alaska Fairbanks and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Results of this project will be used to evaluate the potential for reintroduction of LWD to reaches of the Chena River below Moose Creek Dam, provide juvenile salmon rearing capacity estimates for the basin, and contribute towards efforts to monitor LWD based on remote sensing and link the distribution and abundance of wood along the river to wildfire and land management practices.
