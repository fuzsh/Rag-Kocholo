        "text": "As the nation emerges from the Great Recession, the West is poised to lead the way in economic and population growth. Both Colorado and Arizona expect to add a million people each decade until 2050, with other Western states growing at similar rates, if not in equal numbers. Although newcomers will tend to congregate in the region’s metropolitan areas—where the populations will also be older and more diverse—smaller, high-amenity communities will also experience significant growth. This growth will create demand for new housing, transportation and transit options, educational and economic opportunities, as well as water, energy, and other natural resources. These demands will, in turn, increase pressure on our governmental and policy institutions to help support this growth in a way that protects the quality of life that attracts people to the region in the first place.\n\nThe 2014 RMLUI Annual Land Use Conference will focus on how we can approach issues of growth as we come of out the Great Recession. What can we learn about the mistakes of the past to make sure that the next boom results in the right kind of growth? How will our master planned communities do things differently this time around? How will we build new communities and retrofit existing neighborhoods while ensuring access to transit, to jobs, to schools, and to outdoor recreation? How do we ensure that our new forms of development are equitable and ecologically responsible? What are the best ideas about how to make the next boom an opportunity to create enduring communities for the future? And how do we ensure that financing is available to support smarter growth?\n\nConference Highlights\n\nKeynote Presentation\n\nFormer Secretary of the Interior, Ken Salazar, delivered the Keynote Address for the 2014 RMLUI Conference.\n\nDynamics of the Land Use Case: Elements, Strategy and Presentation\n\nThis day-long, soup-to-nuts workshop explored the process of land use development.
