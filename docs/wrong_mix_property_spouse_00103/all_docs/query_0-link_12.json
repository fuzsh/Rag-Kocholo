In 2008, they welcomed their first child, a son named Roman. Sadly, their relationship fell through in 2012 and their divorce was finalized in 2013, with Abigail awarded custody of their child. Nonetheless, Pruett’s divorce stirred some drama, as his ex-wife stated that he bullied her, allegations made in the wake of their battle for custody with the whole event covered by the press.\n\n“He is verbally abusive and a bully”, Spencer stated. She then added that she avoids talking to him while alone, as she doesn’t want to be the subject of verbal abuse.
