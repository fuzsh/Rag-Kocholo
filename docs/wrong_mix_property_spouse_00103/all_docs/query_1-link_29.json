Capstone Project: This project must be connected to work completed in HIST 6301 and should involve something that advances professional development. Examples include: curriculum and/or lesson plan development that incorporates knowledge and skills gained in the program for use in the classroom; a public or digital history project, such as a museum/library exhibit, podcast, website, or documentary film; an article-length research paper rooted in original, primary evidence; another type of project related to the individual’s unique professional goals, designed in consultation with and approved by the Non-Thesis MA Coordinator.\n\n2. Paper/Project Revision: Students must revise a paper or project completed in a previously completed class. The student must include the original paper/project, including the feedback they received from their supervising professor, and then include a foreword that explains the revisions completed for the final portfolio. (Note: Students selecting “article-length paper” as their capstone project may not use same paper for their Paper Revision.)\n\n3. Reflection Essay: Students must write a five-page essay reflecting on their experiences in the program and how those experiences will shape their professional life moving forward.\n\nOnce a student completes their Portfolio, they will present it in an oral defense before a panel consisting of the Non-Thesis MA Coordinator and members of an annually rotating Non-Thesis MA Review Committee, consisting of faculty in the Department of History.\n\nMaster's\n\nFall 2024: Jan 15, 2024\n\nSpring 2025: Oct 15, 2024\n\nRichard Verrone Fine Arts - Interdisciplinary Arts - (PhD)\n\nFine Arts - Interdisciplinary Arts - (PhD)\n\nThe Interdisciplinary Arts track of the Fine Arts PhD program allows students to work within two or three disciplinary concentrations.

A minimum of 24 hours must be taken in the Department of History at Texas Tech. This includes twelve (12) hours taken at the 5000-level in one of three geographic areas of concentration (United States, Europe, or World) and twelve (12) hours of elective graduate coursework. Of the electives, six (6) hours must be chosen from geographic areas outside of the student's geographic area of concentration. Students can take no more than six (6) hours at the 7000-level toward their degree requirements and must complete HIST 5304: Approaches to History, and HIST 6301: Introduction to Historical Writing, in the first semester they are offered after the student's admission to the program. HIST 5304 must be taken before HIST 6301. HIST 5304 and HIST 6301 must also be taken before completing six (6) hours of thesis hours (HIST 6000). Students will plan their programs with the advice and consent of the Graduate Program Coordinator, the Director of Graduate Studies, and their primary faculty advisor.\n\nThe 36 hours are distributed as follows:\n\nHIST 5304 (Taken during first semester course is offered after admission.) HIST 6301 (Taken during first semester course is offered after completion of HIST 5304)\n\nGeographic Area of Concentration: 12 Semester Credit Hours\n\nElectives: 12 Semester Credit Hours (6 hours of which must be outside the geographic area of concentration)\n\nHIST 6000: Master's Thesis: 6 Semester Credit Hours\n\nForeign Language Requirement. Proficiency in one foreign language is required of all candidates for the M.A. thesis-concentration degree. Proficiency in a language is defined according to the following parameters:\n\nnative speaker status as certified by the Graduate Studies Committee,\n\nattainment of a grade of C- or better in a fourth semester undergraduate course (in Texas numeration, the 2302 course),\n\nAttainment of a grade of B- or better in the accelerated graduate language course (one that is equivalent to two years of undergraduate language courses; in Texas numeration the 5341 and/or 5342 course);\n\nOther class work equivalent to the above; OR\n\nDemonstration of an equivalent level of competency through an approved exam (administered by the Department of Classical and Modern Language and Literature, by an approved outside agency, or by a scholar with demonstrable experience in the language in question) or by some other means acceptable to the Graduate Studies Committee, the Department, and the Graduate School.\n\nThesis\n\nThesis work is directed by a committee consisting of at least two members of the history graduate faculty. Other faculty who may be a scholar with relevant expertise from the Department of History, another department, or another university, can be added to the committee if the thesis director, student, and Director of Graduate Studies conclude that the nature of the thesis topic warrants it. After the final version of the thesis has been approved by the committee, students are required to pass an oral defense of the thesis.\n\nTerminal M.A. Concentration (Non-Thesis Professional Enrichment)\n\nProgram Requirements\n\nThe professional enrichment concentration is designed to assist persons for whom a two-year graduate degree would provide career advancement in a chosen or desired field other than that for which a history Ph.D. is required. The focus of the terminal M.A. is on providing a platform for developing critical analytical skills (reading, written, and oral) within a historical framework. The program provides intense study of up to three interrelated geographic or thematic fields. The terminal M.A. concludes with written examinations in the student's chosen fields of study. The degree does not require the completion of a thesis-length work. For this reason, the terminal M.A. concentration is not intended for those whose interests are oriented toward undertaking Ph.D. work in history.\n\nCourse Requirements\n\nA student in professional enrichment concentration must successfully complete at least 36 hours of graduate work to receive the Master of Arts degree. A minimum of 24 hours must be taken in the Department of History and at least 3 hours must be taken at the 6000-level. No more than 6 hours may be taken at the 7000-level. Students must complete HIST 5304. Students are also required to select at least two, and no more than three, focus areas (either geographic and/or thematic fields. For the three-field concentration, students are required to complete a minimum of 9 hours in each field. For the two-field concentration, 15 hours are required in one field, and 12 hours in the other field. The remaining 6 elective hours toward the degree can be used either to intensify work in an already selected focus area or pursue an appropriate minor in another department. Students will plan their programs with the advice and consent of the Graduate Program Coordinator, the Director of Graduate Studies, and their primary faculty advisor. Please note: all Department of History graduate courses meet face-to-face (no online courses are offered).\n\nThe 36 hours are distributed as follows:\n\nHIST 5304\n\nHIST 6301\n\nFocus Area One: 12 semester credit hours\n\nFocus Area Two: 12 semester credit hours\n\nDiscretionary/Elective Hours: 6 semester credit hours\n\nForeign Language Requirement. No foreign language is required for the academic preparatory concentration.\n\nCapstone Portfolio\n\nStudents will work with the Non-Thesis MA Coordinator to prepare a Capstone Portfolio consisting of three discrete components: a Capstone Project, a Paper/Project Revision, and a Reflection Essay. Once a student completes their Portfolio, they will present it in an oral defense before a panel consisting of the Non-Thesis MA Coordinator and members of an annually rotating Non-Thesis MA Review Committee, consisting of faculty in the Department of History.\n\nMaster's\n\nFall 2024: Jan 15, 2024\n\nSpring 2025: Oct 15, 2024\n\nRichard Verrone Languages & Cultures - German (MA)\n\nLanguages & Cultures - German (MA)\n\nSecond language learning and teaching are two of the major areas within Applied Linguistics that we specialize in here at Texas Tech.
