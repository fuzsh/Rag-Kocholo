        "meta_description": "Abstract. Extremely large floods that far exceed previously observed records are often considered virtually âimpossibleâ, yet they are an ever-present threat similar to the sword suspended over the head of Damocles in the classical Greek anecdote. Neglecting such floods may lead to emergency situations where society is unprepared and to disastrous consequences. Four reasons why extremely large floods are often considered next to impossible are explored here, including physical (e.g. climate change), psychological, socio-economic and combined reasons. It is argued that the risk associated with an âimpossibleâ flood may often be larger than expected and that a bottom-up approach should be adopted that starts from the people affected and explores possibilities of risk management, giving high priority to social in addition to economic risks. Suggestions are given for managing this risk of a flood considered impossible by addressing the diverse causes of the presumed impossibility.",

Our results suggest carefully considering the impact of uncertainty when designing climate change adaptation policies for droughts. Rigorous use and comprehensive interpretation of the available information are needed to avoid mismanagement.\n\nGlobal-scale human pressure evolution imprints on sustainability of river systems\n\nSerena Ceola, Francesco Laio, and Alberto Montanari\n\nHydrol.

This index, based on nightlights and river discharge data, shows a significant increase from 1992 to 2013 worldwide. The most notable changes are found in river basins across Africa and Asia, where human pressure on rivers is growing markedly. This index identifies priority areas that can be targeted for the implementation of mitigation strategies and plans.\n\nA large sample analysis of European rivers on seasonal river flow correlation and its physical drivers\n\nTheano Iliopoulou, Cristina Aguilar, Berit Arheimer, MarÃ­a BermÃºdez, Nejc Bezak, Andrea FicchÃ¬, Demetris Koutsoyiannis, Juraj Parajka, MarÃ­a JosÃ© Polo, Guillaume Thirel, and Alberto Montanari\n\nHydrol.

We compute seasonal correlations between peak and low flows and average flows in the previous seasons and explore the links with various physiographic and hydro-climatic catchment descriptors. Our findings suggest that there is a traceable physical basis for river memory which in turn can be employed to reduce uncertainty and improve probabilistic predictions of floods and droughts.\n\nA geostatistical data-assimilation technique for enhancing macro-scale rainfallârunoff simulations\n\nAlessio Pugliese, Simone Persiano, Stefano Bagli, Paolo Mazzoli, Juraj Parajka, Berit Arheimer, RenÃ© Capell, Alberto Montanari, GÃ¼nter BlÃ¶schl, and Attilio Castellarin\n\nHydrol.

In our method, one can get enhanced streamflow simulations without any further model calibration. Indeed, this method is neither computational nor data-intensive and is implemented only using observed streamflow data and a GIS vector layer with catchment boundaries. Assessments are performed in the Tyrol region.\n\nReal-time updating of the flood frequency distribution through data assimilation\n\nCristina Aguilar, Alberto Montanari, and MarÃ­a-JosÃ© Polo\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 21, 3687–3700, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-21-3687-2017,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-21-3687-2017, 2017\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAssuming that floods are driven by both short- (meteorological forcing) and long-term perturbations (higher-than-usual moisture), we propose a technique for updating a season in advance the flood frequency distribution. Its application in the Po and Danube rivers helped to reduce the uncertainty in the estimation of floods and thus constitutes a promising tool for real-time management of flood risk mitigation. This study is the result of the stay of the first author at the University of Bologna.\n\nTopography- and nightlight-based national flood risk assessment in Canada\n\nAmin Elshorbagy, Raja Bharath, Anchit Lakhanpal, Serena Ceola, Alberto Montanari, and Karl-Erich Lindenschmidt\n\nHydrol.

This work presents a simple and effective method for large-scale flood hazard and risk mapping, applied in this study to Canada. Readily available data, such as remote sensing night-light data, topography, and stream network were used to create the maps.\n\nHuman signatures derived from nighttime lights along the Eastern Alpine river network in Austria and Italy\n\nSerena Ceola, Alberto Montanari, Juraj Parajka, Alberto Viglione, GÃ¼nter BlÃ¶schl, and Francesco Laio\n\nProc.

Moving from the definition of accurate protocols, a rainfall-runoff model was independently applied by the research groups, which then engaged in a comparative discussion. The results revealed that sharing protocols and running the experiment within a controlled environment is fundamental for ensuring experiment repeatability and reproducibility.\n\nClimate and hydrological variability: the catchment filtering role\n\nI.

This paper analyses the catchment filtering role by analytically deriving the annual maximum peak flow frequency distribution based on realistic hypotheses about the rainfall process and the rainfall-runoff transformation. Depending on changes in the annual number of rainfall events, the catchment filtering role is particularly significant. Results also largely depend on the return period considered.\n\nUnderstanding flood regime changes in Europe: a state-of-the-art assessment\n\nJ. Hall, B. Arheimer, M. Borga, R. BrÃ¡zdil, P.

Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-2024-181,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-2024-181, 2024\n\nPreprint under review for HESS\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nFlood peak distributions indicate how likely the occurrence of an extreme flood is at a certain river. If the distribution has a so-called heavy tail, extreme floods are more likely than might be anticipated. We find heavier tails in small compared to large catchments, and that spatially variable rainfall leads to a lower occurrence probability of extreme floods. Spatially variable runoff does not show an effect. The results can improve estimations of occurrence probabilities of extreme floods.\n\nHyper-resolution flood hazard mapping at the national scale\n\nGÃ¼nter BlÃ¶schl, Andreas Buttinger-Kreuzhuber, Daniel Cornel, Julia Eisl, Michael Hofer, Markus Hollaus, Zsolt HorvÃ¡th, JÃ¼rgen Komma, Artem Konev, Juraj Parajka, Norbert Pfeifer, Andreas Reithofer, JosÃ© Salinas, Peter Valent, Roman VÃ½leta, JÃ¼rgen Waser, Michael H. Wimmer, and Heinz Stiefelmeyer\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 24, 2071–2091, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-24-2071-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-24-2071-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nA methodology of regional flood hazard mapping is proposed, based on data in Austria, which combines automatic methods with manual interventions to maximise efficiency and to obtain estimation accuracy similar to that of local studies. Flood discharge records from 781 stations are used to estimate flood hazard patterns of a given return period at a resolution of 2 m over a total stream length of 38 000 km. The hazard maps are used for civil protection, risk awareness and insurance purposes.\n\nHESS Opinions: Towards a common vision for the future of hydrological observatories\n\nPaolo Nasta, GÃ¼nter BlÃ¶schl, Heye R.

Tarquis, Ilja van Meerveld, Marc Voltz, Yijian Zeng, William Kustas, Xin Li, Harry Vereecken, and Nunzio Romano\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1678,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1678, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe Unsolved Problems in Hydrology (UPH) initiative has emphasized the need to establish networks of multi-decadal hydrological observatories to tackle catchment-scale challenges on a global scale. This opinion paper provocatively discusses two end members of possible future hydrological observatory (HO) networks for a given hypothesized community budget: a comprehensive set of moderately instrumented observatories or, alternatively, a small number of highly instrumented super-sites.\n\nIt could have been much worse: spatial counterfactuals of the July 2021 flood in the Ahr valley, Germany\n\nSergiy Vorogushyn, Li Han, Heiko Apel, Viet Dung Nguyen, BjÃ¶rn Guse, Xiaoxiang Guan, Oldrich Rakovec, Husain Najafi, Luis Samaniego, and Bruno Merz\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci. Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-2024-97,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-2024-97, 2024\n\nPreprint under review for NHESS\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe July 2021 flood in Central Europe was one of the deadliest floods in Europe in the past decades and the most expensive flood in Germany. In this paper we show that the hydrological impact of this event in the Ahr valley could have been even worse if the rainfall footprint trajectory was only slightly different. The presented methodology of spatial counterfactuals generates plausible unprecedented events and helps better prepare for future extreme floods.\n\nFlood damage model bias caused by aggregation\n\nSeth Bryant, Heidi Kreibich, and Bruno Merz\n\nProc. IAHS, 386, 181–187, https://doi.org/10.5194/piahs-386-181-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/piahs-386-181-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nOur study found that simplifying data in flood risk models can introduce errors. We tested 344 damage functions and found errors up to 40 % of the total asset value. This means large-scale flood risk assessments may have significant errors due to the modelling approach. Our research highlights the need for more attention to data aggregation in flood risk models.\n\nInvited perspectives: Safeguarding the usability and credibility of flood hazard and risk assessments\n\nBruno Merz, GÃ¼nter BlÃ¶schl, Robert JÃ¼pner, Heidi Kreibich, Kai SchrÃ¶ter, and Sergiy Vorogushyn\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-856,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-856, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe discuss the validation of flood hazard and risk assessments (FHRAs) to ensure they are useful for decision-making. We propose a new validation framework that considers not only technical aspects but also the real-world context in which decisions are made. By applying this framework to flood emergency planning, we demonstrate its practicality.\n\nWhat controls the tail behaviour of flood series: rainfall or runoff generation?\n\nElena Macdonald, Bruno Merz, BjÃ¶rn Guse, Viet Dung Nguyen, Xiaoxiang Guan, and Sergiy Vorogushyn\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 28, 833–850, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-28-833-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-28-833-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn some rivers, the occurrence of extreme flood events is more likely than in other rivers – they have heavy-tailed distributions. We find that threshold processes in the runoff generation lead to such a relatively high occurrence probability of extremes. Further, we find that beyond a certain return period, i.e. for rare events, rainfall is often the dominant control compared to runoff generation. Our results can help to improve the estimation of the occurrence probability of extreme floods.\n\nTechnical Note: Resolution enhancement of flood inundation grids\n\nSeth Bryant, Guy Schumann, Heiko Apel, Heidi Kreibich, and Bruno Merz\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 28, 575–588, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-28-575-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-28-575-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nA new algorithm has been developed to quickly produce high-resolution flood maps. It is faster and more accurate than current methods and is available as open-source scripts. This can help communities better prepare for and mitigate flood damages without expensive modelling.\n\nExploring the use of seasonal forecasts to adapt flood insurance premiums\n\nViet Dung Nguyen, Jeroen Aerts, Max Tesselaar, Wouter Boutzen, Heidi Kreibich, Lorenzo Alfieri, and Bruno Merz\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-2862,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-2862, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nOur study explored how seasonal flood forecasts could enhance insurance premium accuracy. Insurers traditionally rely on historical data, yet climate fluctuations influence flood risk. We employed a method that predicts seasonal floods to adjust premiums accordingly. Our findings showed significant year-to-year variations in flood risk and premiums, underscoring the importance of adaptability. Despite limitations, this research aids insurers in preparing for evolving risks.\n\nHistorical rainfall data in northern Italy predict larger meteorological drought hazard than climate projections\n\nRui Guo and Alberto Montanari\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 27, 2847–2863, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-2847-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-2847-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe present study refers to the region of Bologna, where the availability of a 209-year-long daily rainfall series allows us to make a unique assessment of global climate models' reliability and their predicted changes in rainfall and multiyear droughts. Our results suggest carefully considering the impact of uncertainty when designing climate change adaptation policies for droughts. Rigorous use and comprehensive interpretation of the available information are needed to avoid mismanagement.\n\nCooperation in a transboundary river basin: a large-scale socio-hydrological model of the Eastern Nile\n\nMohammad Ghoreishi, Amin Elshorbagy, Saman Razavi, GÃ¼nter BlÃ¶schl, Murugesu Sivapalan, and Ahmed Abdelkader\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 27, 1201–1219, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-1201-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-1201-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe study proposes a quantitative model of the willingness to cooperate in the Eastern Nile River basin. Our results suggest that the 2008 food crisis may account for Sudan recovering its willingness to cooperate with Ethiopia. Long-term lack of trust among the riparian countries may have reduced basin-wide cooperation. The model can be used to explore the effects of changes in future dam operations and other management decisions on the emergence of basin cooperation.\n\nExploring tracer information in a small stream to improve parameter identifiability and enhance the process interpretation in transient storage models\n\nEnrico Bonanno, GÃ¼nter BlÃ¶schl, and Julian Klaus\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 26, 6003–6028, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-26-6003-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-26-6003-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThere is an unclear understanding of which processes regulate the transport of water, solutes, and pollutants in streams. This is crucial since these processes control water quality in river networks. Compared to other approaches, we obtained clearer insights into the processes controlling solute transport in the investigated reach. This work highlights the risks of using uncertain results for interpreting the processes controlling water movement in streams.\n\nThree hypotheses on changing river flood hazards\n\nGÃ¼nter BlÃ¶schl\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 26, 5015–5033, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-26-5015-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-26-5015-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThere is serious concern that river floods are increasing. Starting from explanations discussed in public, the article addresses three hypotheses: land-use change, hydraulic structures, and climate change increase floods. This review finds that all three changes have the potential to not only increase floods, but also to reduce them. It is crucial to consider all three factors of change in flood risk management and communicate them to the general public in a nuanced way.\n\nBrief communication: Impact forecasting could substantially improve the emergency management of deadly floods: case study JulyÂ 2021 floods in Germany\n\nHeiko Apel, Sergiy Vorogushyn, and Bruno Merz\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 22, 3005–3014, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-22-3005-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-22-3005-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe paper presents a fast 2D hydraulic simulation model for flood propagation that enables operational forecasts of spatially distributed inundation depths, flood extent, flow velocities, and other flood impacts. The detailed spatial forecast of floods and flood impacts is a large step forward from the currently operational forecasts of discharges at selected gauges, thus enabling a more targeted flood management and early warning.\n\nAgricultural intensification vs. climate change: what drives long-term changes in sediment load?\n\nShengping Wang, Borbala Szeles, Carmen Krammer, Elmar Schmaltz, Kepeng Song, Yifan Li, Zhiqiang Zhang, GÃ¼nter BlÃ¶schl, and Peter Strauss\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 26, 3021–3036, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-26-3021-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-26-3021-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis study explored the quantitative contribution of agricultural intensification and climate change to the sediment load of a small agricultural watershed. Rather than a change in climatic conditions, changes in the land structure notably altered sediment concentrations under high-flow conditions, thereby contributing most to the increase in annual sediment loads. More consideration of land structure improvement is required when combating the transfer of soil from land to water.\n\nFlood generation: process patterns from the raindrop to the ocean\n\nGÃ¼nter BlÃ¶schl\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 26, 2469–2480, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-26-2469-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-26-2469-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nSound understanding of how floods come about allows for the development of more reliable flood management tools that assist in mitigating their negative impacts. This article reviews river flood generation processes and flow paths across space scales, starting from water movement in the soil pores and moving up to hillslopes, catchments, regions and entire continents. To assist model development, there is a need to learn from observed patterns of flood generation processes at all spatial scales.\n\nThe value of satellite soil moisture and snow cover data for the transfer of hydrological model parameters to ungauged sites\n\nRui Tong, Juraj Parajka, BorbÃ¡la SzÃ©les, Isabella Greimeister-Pfeil, Mariette Vreugdenhil, JÃ¼rgen Komma, Peter Valent, and GÃ¼nter BlÃ¶schl\n\nHydrol.

In this study, we assessed the model performance in terms of runoff, soil moisture, and snow cover predictions with the existing regionalization approaches. Results show that the best transfer methods are the similarity and the kriging approaches. The performance of the transfer methods differs between lowland and alpine catchments.\n\nThe International Soil Moisture Network: serving Earth system science for over a decade\n\nWouter Dorigo, Irene Himmelbauer, Daniel Aberer, Lukas Schremmer, Ivana Petrakovic, Luca Zappa, Wolfgang Preimesberger, Angelika Xaver, Frank Annor, Jonas ArdÃ¶, Dennis Baldocchi, Marco Bitelli, GÃ¼nter BlÃ¶schl, Heye Bogena, Luca Brocca, Jean-Christophe Calvet, J.

Over 1000 scientific publications and thousands of users have made use of the ISMN. The scope of this paper is to inform readers about the data and functionality of the ISMN and to provide a review of the scientific progress facilitated through the ISMN with the scope to shape future research and operations.\n\nCharacteristics and process controls of statistical flood moments in Europe â a data-based analysis\n\nDavid Lun, Alberto Viglione, Miriam Bertola, JÃ¼rgen Komma, Juraj Parajka, Peter Valent, and GÃ¼nter BlÃ¶schl\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst.

There are pronounced regional patterns, for instance: regions with strong Atlantic influence show less year-to-year variability in the magnitude of observed floods when compared with more arid regions of Europe. The hydrological controls on the patterns are quantified and discussed. On the European scale, climate seems to be the dominant driver for the observed patterns.\n\nAssimilation of probabilistic flood maps from SAR data into a coupled hydrologicâhydraulic forecasting model: a proof of concept\n\nConcetta Di Mauroâââââââ, Renaud Hostache, Patrick Matgen, Ramona Pelich, Marco Chini, Peter Jan van Leeuwen, Nancy K.

In particular, we carried out twin experiments based on a synthetically generated dataset with controlled uncertainty. Our empirical results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed data assimilation framework, as forecasting errors are substantially reduced as a result of the assimilation.\n\nRecurrence analysis of extreme event-like data\n\nAbhirup Banerjee, Bedartha Goswami, Yoshito Hirata, Deniz Eroglu, Bruno Merz, JÃ¼rgen Kurths, and Norbert Marwan\n\nNonlin.

Earth Syst. Sci., 25, 2327–2352, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-25-2327-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-25-2327-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe compared the dynamics of streamflow, groundwater and soil moisture to investigate how different parts of an agricultural catchment in Lower Austria are connected. Groundwater is best connected around the stream and worse uphill, where groundwater is deeper. Soil moisture connectivity increases with increasing catchment wetness but is not influenced by spatial position in the catchment. Groundwater is more connected to the stream on the seasonal scale compared to the event scale.\n\nThe value of ASCAT soil moisture and MODIS snow cover data for calibrating a conceptual hydrologic model\n\nRui Tong, Juraj Parajka, Andreas Salentinig, Isabella Pfeil, JÃ¼rgen Komma, BorbÃ¡la SzÃ©les, Martin KubÃ¡Å, Peter Valent, Mariette Vreugdenhil, Wolfgang Wagner, and GÃ¼nter BlÃ¶schl\n\nHydrol.

Combined calibration to runoff, satellite soil moisture, and snow cover improves runoff (40 % catchments), soil moisture (80 % catchments), and snow (~ 100 % catchments) simulation compared to traditional calibration to runoff only.\n\nDo small and large floods have the same drivers of change? A regional attribution analysis in Europe\n\nMiriam Bertola, Alberto Viglione, Sergiy Vorogushyn, David Lun, Bruno Merz, and GÃ¼nter BlÃ¶schl\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 25, 1347–1364, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-25-1347-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-25-1347-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe estimate the contribution of extreme precipitation, antecedent soil moisture and snowmelt to changes in small and large floods across Europe. In northwestern and eastern Europe, changes in small and large floods are driven mainly by one single driver (i.e. extreme precipitation and snowmelt, respectively). In southern Europe both antecedent soil moisture and extreme precipitation significantly contribute to flood changes, and their relative importance depends on flood magnitude.\n\nInventory of dams in Germany\n\nGustavo Andrei Speckhann, Heidi Kreibich, and Bruno Merz\n\nEarth Syst. Sci. Data, 13, 731–740, https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-13-731-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-13-731-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nDams are an important element of water resources management. Data about dams are crucial for practitioners, scientists, and policymakers. We present the most comprehensive open-access dam inventory for Germany to date. The inventory combines multiple sources of information. It comprises 530 dams with information on name, location, river, start year of construction and operation, crest length, dam height, lake area, lake volume, purpose, dam structure, and building characteristics.\n\nWhy does a conceptual hydrological model fail to correctly predict discharge changes in response to climate change?\n\nDoris Duethmann, GÃ¼nter BlÃ¶schl, and Juraj Parajka\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 24, 3493–3511, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-24-3493-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-24-3493-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe investigate why a conceptual hydrological model failed to correctly predict observed discharge changes in response to increasing precipitation and air temperature in 156 Austrian catchments. Simulations indicate that poor model performance is related to two problems, namely a model structure that neglects changes in vegetation dynamics and inhomogeneities in precipitation data caused by changes in stations density with time. Other hypotheses did not improve simulated discharge changes.\n\nComparing Bayesian and traditional end-member mixing approaches for hydrograph separation in aÂ glacierized basin\n\nZhihua He, Katy Unger-Shayesteh, Sergiy Vorogushyn, Stephan M. Weise, Doris Duethmann, Olga Kalashnikova, Abror Gafurov, and Bruno Merz\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 24, 3289–3309, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-24-3289-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-24-3289-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nQuantifying the seasonal contributions of the runoff components, including groundwater, snowmelt, glacier melt, and rainfall, to streamflow is highly necessary for understanding the dynamics of water resources in glacierized basins given the vulnerability of snow- and glacier-dominated environments to the current climate warming. Our study provides the first comparison of two end-member mixing approaches for hydrograph separation in glacierized basins.\n\nOptimal design of hydrometric station networks based on complex network analysis\n\nAnkit Agarwal, Norbert Marwan, Rathinasamy Maheswaran, Ugur Ozturk, JÃ¼rgen Kurths, and Bruno Merz\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 24, 2235–2251, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-24-2235-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-24-2235-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn the climate/hydrology network, each node represents a geographical location of climatological data, and links between nodes are set up based on their interaction or similar variability. Here, using network theory, we first generate a node-ranking measure and then prioritize the rain gauges to identify influential and expandable stations across Germany. To show the applicability of the proposed approach, we also compared the results with existing traditional and contemporary network measures.\n\nFlood trends in Europe: are changes in small and big floods different?\n\nMiriam Bertola, Alberto Viglione, David Lun, Julia Hall, and GÃ¼nter BlÃ¶schl\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 24, 1805–1822, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-24-1805-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-24-1805-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe investigate changes that occurred in small vs. big flood events and in small vs. large catchments across Europe over 5 decades. Annual maximum discharge series between 1960 and 2010 from 2370 gauges in Europe are analysed. Distinctive patterns of flood regime change are identified for large regions across Europe, which depend on flood magnitude and catchment size.\n\nThe role of spatial dependence for large-scale flood risk estimation\n\nAyse Duha Metin, Nguyen Viet Dung, Kai SchrÃ¶ter, Sergiy Vorogushyn, BjÃ¶rn Guse, Heidi Kreibich, and Bruno Merz\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 20, 967–979, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-20-967-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-20-967-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nFor effective risk management, flood risk should be properly assessed. Traditionally, risk is assessed by making the assumption of invariant flow or loss probabilities (the chance that a given discharge or loss is exceeded) within the river catchment during a single flood event. However, in reality, flooding is more severe in some regions than others. This study indicates the importance of representing the spatial dependence of flood peaks and damage for risk assessments.\n\nThe role of flood wave superposition in the severity of large floods\n\nBjÃ¶rn Guse, Bruno Merz, Luzie Wietzke, Sophie Ullrich, Alberto Viglione, and Sergiy Vorogushyn\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 24, 1633–1648, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-24-1633-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-24-1633-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nFloods are influenced by river network processes, among others. Flood characteristics of tributaries may affect flood severity downstream of confluences. The impact of flood wave superposition is investigated with regard to magnitude and temporal matching of flood peaks. Our study in Germany and Austria shows that flood wave superposition is not the major driver of flood severity. However, there is the potential for large floods at some confluences in cases of temporal matching of flood peaks.\n\nGlobal-scale human pressure evolution imprints on sustainability of river systems\n\nSerena Ceola, Francesco Laio, and Alberto Montanari\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst.

This index, based on nightlights and river discharge data, shows a significant increase from 1992 to 2013 worldwide. The most notable changes are found in river basins across Africa and Asia, where human pressure on rivers is growing markedly. This index identifies priority areas that can be targeted for the implementation of mitigation strategies and plans.\n\nUnravelling the spatial diversity of Indian precipitation teleconnections via a non-linear multi-scale approach\n\nJÃ¼rgen Kurths, Ankit Agarwal, Roopam Shukla, Norbert Marwan, Maheswaran Rathinasamy, Levke Caesar, Raghavan Krishnan, and Bruno Merz\n\nNonlin. Processes Geophys., 26, 251–266, https://doi.org/10.5194/npg-26-251-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/npg-26-251-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe examined the spatial diversity of Indian rainfall teleconnection at different timescales, first by identifying homogeneous communities and later by computing non-linear linkages between the identified communities (spatial regions) and dominant climatic patterns, represented by climatic indices such as El Nino–Southern Oscillation, Indian Ocean Dipole, North Atlantic Oscillation, Pacific Decadal Oscillation and Atlantic Multi-Decadal Oscillation.\n\nClimate influences on flood probabilities across Europe\n\nEva Steirou, Lars Gerlitz, Heiko Apel, Xun Sun, and Bruno Merz\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 23, 1305–1322, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-23-1305-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-23-1305-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe investigate whether flood probabilities in Europe vary for different large-scale atmospheric circulation conditions. Maximum seasonal river flows from 600 gauges in Europe and five synchronous atmospheric circulation indices are analyzed. We find that a high percentage of stations is influenced by at least one of the climate indices, especially during winter. These results can be useful for preparedness and damage planning by (re-)insurance companies.\n\nA large sample analysis of European rivers on seasonal river flow correlation and its physical drivers\n\nTheano Iliopoulou, Cristina Aguilar, Berit Arheimer, MarÃ­a BermÃºdez, Nejc Bezak, Andrea FicchÃ¬, Demetris Koutsoyiannis, Juraj Parajka, MarÃ­a JosÃ© Polo, Guillaume Thirel, and Alberto Montanari\n\nHydrol.

We compute seasonal correlations between peak and low flows and average flows in the previous seasons and explore the links with various physiographic and hydro-climatic catchment descriptors. Our findings suggest that there is a traceable physical basis for river memory which in turn can be employed to reduce uncertainty and improve probabilistic predictions of floods and droughts.\n\nJoint editorial: Invigorating hydrological research through journal publications\n\nNevil Quinn, GÃ¼nter BlÃ¶schl, AndrÃ¡s BÃ¡rdossy, Attilio Castellarin, Martyn Clark, Christophe Cudennec, Demetris Koutsoyiannis, Upmanu Lall, Lubomir Lichner, Juraj Parajka, Christa D.

Earth Syst. Sci., 22, 6147–6161, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-22-6147-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-22-6147-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nKarst aquifers are vulnerable to pollution due to the typically short particle travel times. As the rainwater runs off on the surface it may collect contamination before infiltrating. This paper proposes a new field-mapping method for the ability of the landscape to produce and convey surface runoff. The method is based on local data collection in the field, and a visual assessment of surface runoff traces from a distance, which makes it suitable for larger areas than traditional field mapping.\n\nHow do changes along the risk chain affect flood risk?\n\nAyse Duha Metin, Nguyen Viet Dung, Kai SchrÃ¶ter, BjÃ¶rn Guse, Heiko Apel, Heidi Kreibich, Sergiy Vorogushyn, and Bruno Merz\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst.

Results show that changes in dike systems or in vulnerability may outweigh changes in often investigated components, such as climate change. Although the specific results are conditional on the case study and assumptions, they highlight the need for a broader consideration of potential drivers of change in a comprehensive way.\n\nTowards risk-based flood management in highly productive paddy rice cultivation â concept development and application to the Mekong Delta\n\nNguyen Van Khanh Triet, Nguyen Viet Dung, Bruno Merz, and Heiko Apel\n\nNat.

The derived modelling concept explicitly takes plant phenomenology and timing of floods in a probabilistic modelling framework into account. This results in spatially explicit flood risk maps to rice cultivation, quantified as expected annual damage. Furthermore, the changes in flood risk of two land-use scenarios were estimated and discussed.\n\nJoint editorial: Invigorating hydrological research through journal publications\n\nNevil Quinn, GÃ¼nter BlÃ¶schl, AndrÃ¡s BÃ¡rdossy, Attilio Castellarin, Martyn Clark, Christophe Cudennec, Demetris Koutsoyiannis, Upmanu Lall, Lubomir Lichner, Juraj Parajka, Christa D.

Our results show that catchment evaporation increased on average by 29 Â± 14 mm yr−1 decade−1. We attribute this increase to changes in atmospheric demand (based on reference and pan evaporation), changes in vegetation (quantified by a satellite-based vegetation index), and changes in precipitation.\n\nA geostatistical data-assimilation technique for enhancing macro-scale rainfallârunoff simulations\n\nAlessio Pugliese, Simone Persiano, Stefano Bagli, Paolo Mazzoli, Juraj Parajka, Berit Arheimer, RenÃ© Capell, Alberto Montanari, GÃ¼nter BlÃ¶schl, and Attilio Castellarin\n\nHydrol.

In our method, one can get enhanced streamflow simulations without any further model calibration. Indeed, this method is neither computational nor data-intensive and is implemented only using observed streamflow data and a GIS vector layer with catchment boundaries. Assessments are performed in the Tyrol region.\n\nSpatial patterns and characteristics of flood seasonality in Europe\n\nJulia Hall and GÃ¼nter BlÃ¶schl\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst.

In total, 5023 infiltration curves were collected across all continents in the SWIG database. These data were either provided and quality checked by the scientists or they were digitized from published articles. We are convinced that the SWIG database will allow for a better parameterization of the infiltration process in land surface models and for testing infiltration models.\n\nEstimating parameter values of a socio-hydrological flood model\n\nMarlies Holkje Barendrecht, Alberto Viglione, Heidi Kreibich, Sergiy Vorogushyn, Bruno Merz, and GÃ¼nter BlÃ¶schl\n\nProc. IAHS, 379, 193–198, https://doi.org/10.5194/piahs-379-193-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/piahs-379-193-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe aim of this paper is to assess whether a Socio-Hydrological model can be calibrated to data artificially generated from it. This is not trivial because the model is highly nonlinear and it is not clear what amount of data would be needed for calibration. We demonstrate that, using Bayesian inference, the parameters of the model can be estimated quite accurately from relatively few data, which could be available in real case studies.\n\nWhat controls the stable isotope composition of precipitation in the Mekong Delta? A model-based statistical approach\n\nNguyen Le Duy, Ingo HeidbÃ¼chel, Hanno Meyer, Bruno Merz, and Heiko Apel\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst.

The impact of the different factors on the isotopic condition was quantified by multiple linear regression of all factor combinations combined with relative importance analysis. The proposed approach might open a pathway for the improved reconstruction of paleoclimates based on isotopic records.\n\nMulti-scale event synchronization analysis for unravelling climate processes: a wavelet-based approach\n\nAnkit Agarwal, Norbert Marwan, Maheswaran Rathinasamy, Bruno Merz, and JÃ¼rgen Kurths\n\nNonlin.

Investigation on an observation timescale will not reveal the inherent underlying dynamics triggering these events. This paper develops a new method based on wavelets and event synchronization to unravel the hidden dynamics responsible for such sudden events. This method is tested with synthetic and real-world cases and the results are promising.\n\nHas dyke development in the Vietnamese Mekong Delta shifted flood hazard downstream?\n\nNguyen Van Khanh Triet, Nguyen Viet Dung, Hideto Fujii, Matti Kummu, Bruno Merz, and Heiko Apel\n\nHydrol.

Other important drivers to the alteration of delta flood hazard are also investigated, e.g. tidal level. The findings of our study are substantial valuable for the decision makers in Vietnam to develop holistic and harmonized floods and flood-related issues management plan for the whole delta.\n\nReal-time updating of the flood frequency distribution through data assimilation\n\nCristina Aguilar, Alberto Montanari, and MarÃ­a-JosÃ© Polo\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst.

Its application in the Po and Danube rivers helped to reduce the uncertainty in the estimation of floods and thus constitutes a promising tool for real-time management of flood risk mitigation. This study is the result of the stay of the first author at the University of Bologna.\n\nTopography- and nightlight-based national flood risk assessment in Canada\n\nAmin Elshorbagy, Raja Bharath, Anchit Lakhanpal, Serena Ceola, Alberto Montanari, and Karl-Erich Lindenschmidt\n\nHydrol.

This work presents a simple and effective method for large-scale flood hazard and risk mapping, applied in this study to Canada. Readily available data, such as remote sensing night-light data, topography, and stream network were used to create the maps.\n\nSeasonal forecasting of hydrological drought in the Limpopo Basin: aÂ comparison of statistical methods\n\nMathias Seibert, Bruno Merz, and Heiko Apel\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst.

This study shows that skilled seasonal forecasts can be achieved with statistical methods built upon driving factors for drought occurrence. These are the hydrological factors for current streamflow and meteorological drivers represented by anomalies in sea surface temperatures of the surrounding oceans, which combine to form unique combinations in the drought forecast models.\n\nA statistically based seasonal precipitation forecast model with automatic predictor selection and its application to central and south Asia\n\nLars Gerlitz, Sergiy Vorogushyn, Heiko Apel, Abror Gafurov, Katy Unger-Shayesteh, and Bruno Merz\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 20, 4605–4623, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-20-4605-2016,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-20-4605-2016, 2016\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nMost statistically based seasonal precipitation forecast models utilize a small set of well-known climate indices as potential predictor variables. However, for many target regions, these indices do not lead to sufficient results and customized predictors are required for an accurate prediction. This study presents a statistically based routine, which automatically identifies suitable predictors from globally gridded SST and climate variables by means of an extensive data mining procedure.\n\nCan local climate variability be explained by weather patterns? A multi-station evaluation for the Rhine basin\n\nAline Murawski, Gerd BÃ¼rger, Sergiy Vorogushyn, and Bruno Merz\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst.

A downscaling based on conditioning a stochastic weather generator on weather patterns is a promising approach. Here the link between patterns and local climate is tested, and the skill of GCMs in reproducing these patterns is evaluated.\n\nA three-pillar approach to assessing climate impacts on low flows\n\nGregor Laaha, Juraj Parajka, Alberto Viglione, Daniel Koffler, Klaus Haslinger, Wolfgang SchÃ¶ner, Judith Zehetgruber, and GÃ¼nter BlÃ¶schl\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst.

To illustrate the framework, three pillars are chosen: low-flow observation, climate observations and climate projections. By combining different sources of information we aim at more robust projections than obtained from each pillar alone. The viability of the framework is illustrated for four example catchments from Austria.\n\nUncertainty contributions to low-flow projections in Austria\n\nJuraj Parajka, Alfred Paul Blaschke, GÃ¼nter BlÃ¶schl, Klaus Haslinger, Gerold Hepp, Gregor Laaha, Wolfgang SchÃ¶ner, Helene Trautvetter, Alberto Viglione, and Matthias Zessner\n\nHydrol.

This has been the focus of the Predictions in Ungauged Basins (PUB) initiative of the IAHS. The initiative has significantly advanced the science by furthering process understanding and estimation methods, and by synthesising the knowledge across processes, places and scales. Ongoing research on PUB is increasingly accounts for the feedbacks between humans and water in the landscape.\n\nA regional look at the selection of a process-oriented model for flood peak/volume relationships\n\nJÃ¡n Szolgay, Ladislav GaÃ¡l, TomÃ¡Å¡ BacigÃ¡l, Silvia KohnovÃ¡, Kamila HlavÄovÃ¡, Roman VÃ½leta, and GÃ¼nter BlÃ¶schl\n\nProc.

The problem of choosing a joint distribution was so far approached more from a statistical point of view. In the paper the suitability of various copula models of this relationships was analysed with a particular focus on the type and seasonality of flood generation processes in a regional context.\n\nHuman signatures derived from nighttime lights along the Eastern Alpine river network in Austria and Italy\n\nSerena Ceola, Alberto Montanari, Juraj Parajka, Alberto Viglione, GÃ¼nter BlÃ¶schl, and Francesco Laio\n\nProc.

To this aim, nocturnal artificial luminosity images and the geographical location of streams and rivers are employed. Our results reveal a significant increase of nighttime lights, and thus of human presence.\n\nLong term prediction of flood occurrence\n\nCristina Aguilar, Alberto Montanari, and MarÃ­a JosÃ© Polo\n\nProc.

This combined fluvial–pluvial flood hazard analysis is performed in a tropical environment for Can Tho city in the Mekong Delta. The final results are probabilistic hazard maps, showing the maximum inundation caused by floods of different magnitudes along with an uncertainty estimation.\n\nJoint Editorial: Fostering innovation and improving impact assessment for journal publications in hydrology\n\nDemetris Koutsoyiannis, GÃ¼nter BlÃ¶schl, AndrÃ¡s BÃ¡rdossy, Christophe Cudennec, Denis Hughes, Alberto Montanari, Insa Neuweiler, and Hubert Savenije\n\nHydrol.

The HOAL catchment features a range of different runoff generation processes (surface runoff, springs, tile drains, wetlands), and is convenient from a logistic point of view as all instruments can be connected to the power grid and a high-speed glassfibre local area network.\n\nDynamics of the flood response to slow-fast landscape-climate feedbacks\n\nR. A. P. PerdigÃ£o and G. BlÃ¶schl\n\nProc.

Our goal is to provide a unifying framework to address those regimes, how and why they change in space and time. For that purpose, we introduce a general model of flood regime dynamics under interacting natural factors and validate it with observations spanning a great diversity of hydrological settings. The model ultimately brings better flood understanding and forecasting abilities.\n\nA European Flood Database: facilitating comprehensive flood research beyond administrative boundaries\n\nJ.

The problem was so far approached more from a statistical point of view. In the paper it was attempted to better understand the hydrological factors controlling this relationship. The suitability of various copula models of the relationships between flood peaks and flood volumes was analysed with a particular focus on the type and seasonality of flood generation processes.\n\nModelling the interaction between flooding events and economic growth\n\nJ.

It is important to understand the drivers and mechanisms of the consumption and investment behavior of these societies in order to identify an optimal investment strategy into flood defense capital. To solve such an economic optimization model we develop a periodic water function to approximate the former discrete stochastic time series of rainfall events and apply it to an existing socio-hydrology model.\n\nVirtual laboratories: new opportunities for collaborative water science\n\nS.

Moving from the definition of accurate protocols, a rainfall-runoff model was independently applied by the research groups, which then engaged in a comparative discussion. The results revealed that sharing protocols and running the experiment within a controlled environment is fundamental for ensuring experiment repeatability and reproducibility.\n\nSnow-cover reconstruction methodology for mountainous regions based on historic in situ observations and recent remote sensing data\n\nA. Gafurov, S. Vorogushyn, D. Farinotti, D. Duethmann, A. Merkushkin, and B.

Sometimes we need snow-cover data over a longer period for climate impact analysis for the calibration/validation of hydrological models. In this study we present a methodology to reconstruct snow cover in the past using available long-term in situ data and recently available remote sensing snow-cover data. The results show about 85% accuracy although only a limited number of stations (7) were used.\n\nClimate and hydrological variability: the catchment filtering role\n\nI. AndrÃ©s-DomÃ©nech, R.

This paper analyses the catchment filtering role by analytically deriving the annual maximum peak flow frequency distribution based on realistic hypotheses about the rainfall process and the rainfall-runoff transformation. Depending on changes in the annual number of rainfall events, the catchment filtering role is particularly significant. Results also largely depend on the return period considered.\n\nWhat made the June 2013 flood in Germany an exceptional event? A hydro-meteorological evaluation\n\nK. SchrÃ¶ter, M. Kunz, F. Elmer, B.

Our results are based on extreme value statistics and aggregated severity indices which we evaluated for a set of 74 historic large-scale floods. This flood database and the methodological framework enable the rapid assessment of future floods using precipitation and discharge observations.\n\nEstimating degree-day factors from MODIS for snowmelt runoff modeling\n\nZ.

Snow density is estimated as the ratio between observed precipitation and changes in the snow volume for days with snow accumulation. DDFS values are estimated as the ratio between changes in the snow water equivalent and difference between the daily temperature and a threshold value for days with snowmelt.\n\nLarge-scale suspended sediment transport and sediment deposition in the Mekong Delta\n\nN.

The regionalization method based on physiographic–climatic similarity had the best performance for predicting daily and Q95 reference flow. We showed that basins without flow monitoring can have a good approximation of streamflow using machine learning and physiographic–climatic information as inputs.\n\nEvolution of river regimes in the Mekong River basin over 8 decades and the role of dams in recent hydrological extremes\n\nHuy Dang and Yadu Pokhrel\n\nHydrol.

These findings could help us rethink the planning of future dams and water resource management in the MRB.\n\nSkill of seasonal flow forecasts at catchment scale: an assessment across South Korea\n\nYongshin Lee, Francesca Pianosi, Andres PeÃ±uela, and Miguel Angel Rico-Ramirez\n\nHydrol.

Sci., 28, 3161–3190, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-28-3161-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-28-3161-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nFlooding worsens due to climate change, with river dynamics being a key in local flood control. Predicting post-storm geomorphic changes is challenging. Using self-organizing maps and machine learning, this study forecasts post-storm alterations in stage–discharge relationships across 3101 US stream gages. The provided framework can aid in updating hazard assessments by identifying rivers prone to change, integrating channel adjustments into flood hazard assessment.\n\nWhen ancient numerical demons meet physics-informed machine learning: adjoint-based gradients for implicit differentiable modeling\n\nYalan Song, Wouter J. M. Knoben, Martyn P. Clark, Dapeng Feng, Kathryn Lawson, Kamlesh Sawadekar, and Chaopeng Shen\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 28, 3051–3077, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-28-3051-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-28-3051-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nDifferentiable models (DMs) integrate neural networks and physical equations for accuracy, interpretability, and knowledge discovery. We developed an adjoint-based DM for ordinary differential equations (ODEs) for hydrological modeling, reducing distorted fluxes and physical parameters from errors in models that use explicit and operation-splitting schemes. With a better numerical scheme and improved structure, the adjoint-based DM matches or surpasses long short-term memory (LSTM) performance.\n\nAssessing the impact of climate change on high return levels of peak flows in Bavaria applying the CRCM5 large ensemble\n\nFlorian Willkofer, Raul R. Wood, and Ralf Ludwig\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 28, 2969–2989, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-28-2969-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-28-2969-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nSevere flood events pose a threat to riverine areas, yet robust estimates of the dynamics of these events in the future due to climate change are rarely available. Hence, this study uses data from a regional climate model, SMILE, to drive a high-resolution hydrological model for 98 catchments of hydrological Bavaria and exploits the large database to derive robust values for the 100-year flood events. Results indicate an increase in frequency and intensity for most catchments in the future.\n\nImpacts of climate and land surface change on catchment evapotranspiration and runoff from 1951 to 2020 in Saxony, Germany\n\nMaik Renner and Corina Hauffe\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 28, 2849–2869, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-28-2849-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-28-2849-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nClimate and land surface changes influence the partitioning of water balance components decisively. Their impact is quantified for 71 catchments in Saxony. Germany. Distinct signatures in the joint water and energy budgets are found: (i) past forest dieback caused a decrease in and subsequent recovery of evapotranspiration in the affected regions, and (ii) the recent shift towards higher aridity imposed a large decline in runoff that has not been seen in the observation records before.\n\nQuantifying and reducing flood forecast uncertainty by the CHUP-BMA method\n\nZhen Cui, Shenglian Guo, Hua Chen, Dedi Liu, Yanlai Zhou, and Chong-Yu Xu\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 28, 2809–2829, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-28-2809-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-28-2809-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nEnsemble forecasting facilitates reliable flood forecasting and warning. This study couples the copula-based hydrologic uncertainty processor (CHUP) with Bayesian model averaging (BMA) and proposes the novel CHUP-BMA method of reducing inflow forecasting uncertainty of the Three Gorges Reservoir. The CHUP-BMA avoids the normal distribution assumption in the HUP-BMA and considers the constraint of initial conditions, which can improve the deterministic and probabilistic forecast performance.\n\nDeveloping a tile drainage module for the Cold Regions Hydrological Model: lessons from a farm in southern Ontario, Canada\n\nMazda Kompanizare, Diogo Costa, Merrin L. Macrae, John W. Pomeroy, and Richard M. Petrone\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 28, 2785–2807, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-28-2785-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-28-2785-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nA new agricultural tile drainage module was developed in the Cold Region Hydrological Model platform. Tile flow and water levels are simulated by considering the effect of capillary fringe thickness, drainable water and seasonal regional groundwater dynamics. The model was applied to a small well-instrumented farm in southern Ontario, Canada, where there are concerns about the impacts of agricultural drainage into Lake Erie.\n\nTo bucket or not to bucket? Analyzing the performance and interpretability of hybrid hydrological models with dynamic parameterization\n\nEduardo AcuÃ±a Espinoza, Ralf Loritz, Manuel Ãlvarez Chaves, Nicole BÃ¤uerle, and Uwe Ehret\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 28, 2705–2719, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-28-2705-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-28-2705-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nHydrological hybrid models promise to merge the performance of deep learning methods with the interpretability of process-based models. One hybrid approach is the dynamic parameterization of conceptual models using long short-term memory (LSTM) networks. We explored this method to evaluate the effect of the flexibility given by LSTMs on the process-based part.\n\nWidespread flooding dynamics under climate change: characterising floods using grid-based hydrological modelling and regional climate projections\n\nAdam Griffin, Alison L. Kay, Paul Sayers, Victoria Bell, Elizabeth Stewart, and Sam Carr\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 28, 2635–2650, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-28-2635-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-28-2635-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWidespread flooding is a major problem in the UK and is greatly affected by climate change and land-use change. To look at how widespread flooding changes in the future, climate model data (UKCP18) were used with a hydrological model (Grid-to-Grid) across the UK, and 14 400 events were identified between two time slices: 1980–2010 and 2050–2080. There was a strong increase in the number of winter events in the future time slice and in the peak return periods.\n\nMetamorphic testing of machine learning and conceptual hydrologic models\n\nPeter Reichert, Kai Ma, Marvin HÃ¶ge, Fabrizio Fenicia, Marco Baity-Jesi, Dapeng Feng, and Chaopeng Shen\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 28, 2505–2529, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-28-2505-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-28-2505-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe compared the predicted change in catchment outlet discharge to precipitation and temperature change for conceptual and machine learning hydrological models. We found that machine learning models, despite providing excellent fit and prediction capabilities, can be unreliable regarding the prediction of the effect of temperature change for low-elevation catchments. This indicates the need for caution when applying them for the prediction of the effect of climate change.\n\nThe influence of human activities on streamflow reductions during the megadrought in central Chile\n\nNicolÃ¡s Ãlamos, Camila Alvarez-Garreton, Ariel MuÃ±oz, and Ãlvaro GonzÃ¡lez-Reyes\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 28, 2483–2503, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-28-2483-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-28-2483-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn this study, we assess the effects of climate and water use on streamflow reductions and drought intensification during the last 3 decades in central Chile. We address this by contrasting streamflow observations with near-natural streamflow simulations. We conclude that while the lack of precipitation dominates streamflow reductions in the megadrought, water uses have not diminished during this time, causing a worsening of the hydrological drought conditions and maladaptation conditions.\n\nElevational control of isotopic composition and application in understanding hydrologic processes in the mid Merced River catchment, Sierra Nevada, California, USA\n\nFengjing Liu, Martha H. Conklin, and Glenn D. Shaw\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 28, 2239–2258, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-28-2239-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-28-2239-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nMountain snowpack has been declining and more precipitation falls as rain than snow. Using stable isotopes, we found flows and flow duration in Yosemite Creek are most sensitive to climate warming due to strong evaporation of waterfalls, potentially lengthening the dry-up period of waterfalls in summer and negatively affecting tourism. Groundwater recharge in Yosemite Valley is primarily from the upper snow–rain transition (2000–2500 m) and very vulnerable to a reduction in the snow–rain ratio.\n\nEnhancing long short-term memory (LSTM)-based streamflow prediction with a spatially distributed approach\n\nQiutong Yu, Bryan A. Tolson, Hongren Shen, Ming Han, Juliane Mai, and Jimmy Lin\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 28, 2107–2122, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-28-2107-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-28-2107-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIt is challenging to incorporate input variables' spatial distribution information when implementing long short-term memory (LSTM) models for streamflow prediction. This work presents a novel hybrid modelling approach to predict streamflow while accounting for spatial variability. We evaluated the performance against lumped LSTM predictions in 224 basins across the Great Lakes region in North America. This approach shows promise for predicting streamflow in large, ungauged basin.\n\nBroadleaf afforestation impacts on terrestrial hydrology insignificant compared to climate change in Great Britain\n\nMarcus Buechel, Louise Slater, and Simon Dadson\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 28, 2081–2105, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-28-2081-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-28-2081-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAfforestation has been proposed internationally, but the hydrological implications of such large increases in the spatial extent of woodland are not fully understood. In this study, we use a land surface model to simulate hydrology across Great Britain with realistic afforestation scenarios and potential climate changes. Countrywide afforestation minimally influences hydrology, when compared to climate change, and reduces low streamflow whilst not lowering the highest flows.\n\nHybrid Hydrological Modeling for Large Alpine Basins: A Distributed Approach\n\nBu Li, Ting Sun, Fuqiang Tian, Mahmut Tudaji, Li Qin, and Guangheng Ni\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci. Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-2024-54,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-2024-54, 2024\n\nRevised manuscript accepted for HESS\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis paper developed hybrid distributed hydrological models by employing a distributed model as the backbone, and utilizing deep learning to parameterize and replace internal modules. The main contribution is to provide a high-performance tool enriched with explicit hydrological knowledge for hydrological prediction and improves understanding about the hydrological sensitivities to climate change in large alpine basins.\n\nImpacts of spatiotemporal resolutions of precipitation on flood event simulation based on multimodel structures â a case study over the Xiang River basin in China\n\nQian Zhu, Xiaodong Qin, Dongyang Zhou, Tiantian Yang, and Xinyi Song\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 28, 1665–1686, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-28-1665-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-28-1665-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nInput data, model and calibration strategy can affect the accuracy of flood event simulation and prediction. Satellite-based precipitation with different spatiotemporal resolutions is an important input source. Data-driven models are sometimes proven to be more accurate than hydrological models. Event-based calibration and conventional strategy are two options adopted for flood simulation. This study targets the three concerns for accurate flood event simulation and prediction.\n\nA network approach for multiscale catchment classification using traits\n\nFabio Ciulla and Charuleka Varadharajan\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 28, 1617–1651, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-28-1617-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-28-1617-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe present a new method based on network science for unsupervised classification of large datasets and apply it to classify 9067 US catchments and 274 biophysical traits at multiple scales. We find that our trait-based approach produces catchment classes with distinct streamflow behavior and that spatial patterns emerge amongst pristine and human-impacted catchments. This method can be widely used beyond hydrology to identify patterns, reduce trait redundancy, and select representative sites.\n\nMulti-model approach in a variable spatial framework for streamflow simulation\n\nCyril ThÃ©bault, Charles Perrin, Vazken AndrÃ©assian, Guillaume Thirel, SÃ©bastien Legrand, and Olivier Delaigue\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 28, 1539–1566, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-28-1539-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-28-1539-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nStreamflow forecasting is useful for many applications, ranging from population safety (e.g. floods) to water resource management (e.g. agriculture or hydropower). To this end, hydrological models must be optimized. However, a model is inherently wrong. This study aims to analyse the contribution of a multi-model approach within a variable spatial framework to improve streamflow simulations. The underlying idea is to take advantage of the strength of each modelling framework tested.\n\nAdvancing understanding of lakeâwatershed hydrology: a fully coupled numerical model illustrated by Qinghai Lake\n\nLele Shu, Xiaodong Li, Yan Chang, Xianhong Meng, Hao Chen, Yuan Qi, Hongwei Wang, Zhaoguo Li, and Shihua Lyu\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 28, 1477–1491, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-28-1477-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-28-1477-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe developed a new model to better understand how water moves in a lake basin. Our model improves upon previous methods by accurately capturing the complexity of water movement, both on the surface and subsurface. Our model, tested using data from China's Qinghai Lake, accurately replicates complex water movements and identifies contributing factors of the lake's water balance. The findings provide a robust tool for predicting hydrological processes, aiding water resource planning.\n\nHESS Opinions: A few camels or a whole caravan?\n\nFranziska Maria Clerc-Schwarzenbach, Giovanni Selleri, Mattia Neri, Elena Toth, Ilja van Meerveld, and Jan Seibert\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-864,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-864, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe compare the catchment forcing data provided in large-sample datasets, namely the Caravan dataset and three of the original CAMELS datasets (US, BR, GB). We show that the differences affect hydrological model performance and that the data quality in the Caravan dataset is lower than the one in the CAMELS datasets, both for precipitation and "
