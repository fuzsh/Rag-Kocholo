It is believed that most records of the camp were destroyed during or after the war - possibly to protect both the men and their families who were trapped in Third Reich territories.\n\nPlease get in touch if you can help add to this list.\n\nPlease see the map for more information about the men, where available, or click on the links below to go to their pages.\n\nUpdate: Since starting this list, the 1939 Register has been released, which includes the entry for Kitchener camp. If you are looking for a relative, or a specific refugee, please also check here. Neither this list of names, nor the 1939 Register provide a definitive list. A significant number of men who were in the camp were - for some as-yet-unknown reason - not present for the census. So please do check both resources.\n\nJump to:\n\nA, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z\n\nA\n\nB\n\nC\n\nD\n\nE\n\nF\n\nG\n\nH\n\nI\n\nJ\n\nK\n\nL\n\nM\n\nN\n\nO\n\nP\n\nQ\n\nR\n\nS\n\nT\n\nU\n\nV\n\nW\n\nY\n\nZ"
