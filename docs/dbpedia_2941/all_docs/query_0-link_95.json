        "text": "What is the five-fold ministry? This is a question that many people have heard of, but don't know what it means. The five-fold ministry is found in Ephesians 4:11, and it refers to the five roles that God has called Christians to fill. These roles are (1) apostles, (2) prophets, (3) evangelists, (4) pastors, and (5) teachers. Each of these roles is important not just for the early church but for the body of Christ today to function properly. In this blog post, we will explore each of these roles in more detail!\n\nâ\n\nWhat Do Five Fold Ministers Do (Church Government)?\n\nThe five-fold ministry exists to equip the church body for works of service in the new testament (Ephesians 4:12). The idea is that each member of the church body has a role to play in furthering God's kingdom. When everyone is working together in their gifts and calling, the Church is able to accomplish more than what any one person could do on their own. God's heart is for all people to be saved and to come to the whole measure of the knowledge truth (1 Timothy 2:4). To learn about the five fold in more depth, join our school of ministry.\n\nEphesians Chapter 4:11 \"So Christ himself gave the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, the pastors and teachers, 12 to equip his people for works of service, so that the body of Christ may be built up 13 until we all reach unity in the faith and in the knowledge of the Son of God and become mature, attaining to the whole measure of the fullness of Christ.\"\n\nDoes Everyone Have An Office? (Five Fold Ministry Gifts)\n\nPeople are born with the gifts of Jesus Christ (fivefold ministry). They are not something you can attain. On the other hand, gifts of the Spirit are available to all. It is God's ministry on earth through His people.\n\nThe gifts of the Spirit of God are available to all for free. All you have to do is believe in Jesus Christ and what He did on the cross. The Bible actually says to \"Pursue love, and earnestly desire the spiritual gifts, especially that you may prophesy.\" That means they are for everyone.\n\nOn the other hand, the 5 fold ministry is to equip the saints so that they can function in the gifts. There is a difference between having an office and functioning in a gift.\n\nWhat are the Roles of the Apostles?\n\nAn apostle is someone who is sent out by God to proclaim His message. They are often seen as pioneers or visionaries because they are often sent into new areas to start churches. Apostles and prophets usually work closely together.\n\nApostles are also responsible to equip people to do the work of the ministry. The term apostle came from the Roman Empire. When the Roman Empire would conquer a city, instead of destroying it, they would send out apostles with the kingdom mindset to shift the government and how the city functions.\n\nWho is Apostle Paul in the New Testament?\n\nApostle Paul is one of the most well-known apostles in the New Testament. He was originally named Saul and he was a Pharisee. He was present at the stoning of Stephen and he approved of it. After that, he began to persecute Christians.\n\nHe was on his way to Damascus to persecute the body of Christ (Christians) there when he had a dramatic encounter with Jesus Christ (Acts 9).\n\nAfter this encounter, Saul's name was changed to Paul and he became one of the most well-known apostles who ever lived. He wrote a large portion of the New Testament including fourteen books of the Bible!\n\nWhat are the Roles of a Prophet?\n\nA prophet releases God's word and truth. Prophets often receive messages from God that they then share with others to prepare God's people. Prophets also have a role in interceding for people. This means that a prophet can prophesy over others to edify or build up the church and church leaders.\n\nWhat are the Roles of an Evangelist?\n\nEvangelists gather people. An evangelist is someone who is responsible for sharing the gospel message with those who haven't heard it yet. They often do this through preaching and teaching. Evangelists also have a heart for discipleship, which means they help new believers grow in their faith.\n\nWhat are the Roles of a Pastor?\n\nA pastor is someone who shepherd's the flock (local church). This means that they care for the spiritual needs of the people in their church. Pastors also have a role in teaching and preaching. They often do this through sermons and Bible studies. Pastors guard the sheep, just like a shepard would protect his sheep.\n\nWhat are the Roles of a Teacher?\n\nA teacher is someone who is responsible for instructing others in the things of God. They often do this by breaking down the Word of God. That can be in a Bible study setting or from the pulpit. Teachers also have a heart for equipping people to be able to study the Bible on their own.\n\nThe five-fold ministry is an important part of what makes the Church function properly. Each member has a role to play, and when everyone is working together, great things can be accomplished for the kingdom of God!\n\nDoes Everyone Have A Five-Fold Gift?\n\nNo, not everyone has a specific gifting that is listed in the five-fold ministry. The fivefold is to equip and mature the body of Christ to function in the gifts.\n\nGifts of the Father\n\nThe gifts of the Father stay with us our whole lives; It is something we are born with. There are inherited gifts (grace gifts). To each has been given a measure of grace. This pertains to strengths in our lives.\n\nGifts of Jesus Christ\n\nThe gifts of Christ Jesus are the five-fold ministry gifts. The five-fold can be represented using a hand.\n\nThe thumb is the Apostle because he functions in all five gifts.\n\nThe pointer finger is the Prophet because he gives direction.\n\nThe middle finger is the Evangelist because he has the most reach.\n\nThe ring finger is the Pastor because he is married to the sheep.\n\nThe pinky finger is the Teacher because he brings balance to the body of Christ.\n\nâ\n\nAre The FiveFold Ministry Gifts Are For Today?\n\nYes! The five-fold gifts are for today! Just because we don't see them being used as often as they were in Biblical times doesn't mean that they are no longer valid. We need these gifts today just as much as they did back then! If you are looking for a five-fold church in Sacramento, come join our family on sundays or watch Flame of Fire Church online.\n\nGifts of the Holy Spirit\n\nThe gifts of the Spirit are for today and they are listed in I Corinthians 12:7-11. These gifts are given to us by the Spirit of God and they are meant to be used for building up the Church.\n\nâ\n\nWhat are the 9 gifts of the Holy Spirit?\n\nWord of Wisdom\n\nWord of Knowledge\n\nGift of Faith\n\nGift of Healing\n\nMiracles\n\nGift of Prophecy,\n\nGift of Discernment\n\nSpeaking In Tongues\n\nInterpretation of tongues\n\nConclusion: What is the 5 Fold Ministry?\n\nIn conclusion, the five-fold ministry is an important part of what makes the body of Christ function properly. Each member of the body of Christ Jesus has a role to play. The five fold ministry is to equip the body of Christ to function in gifts.\n\nNot everyone is called to one of the offices in the five fold but everyone is called to preach the gospel of Jesus Christ. While preaching the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Bible says that signs and wonders will follow. Therefore, everyone can function in gifts so that we can reveal Jesus Christ and His kingdom on this earth. Now, when everyone is working together, great things will be accomplished for the kingdom of God!\n\nHave a friend who doesn't believe in Jesus or is doubting God's existence.
