        "meta_description": "This is a list of movies or/and mini series set in the 509 BC-476 AD .\n\nThe history of the Romans is divided into 3 periods: Ancient Roman 753 BC – 509 BC , Roman republic 509 BC – 27 BC and the Roman Empire 27 BC – AD 1453. However the list main focus is the period of Republic (ruled by autocratic government), the reign of the Roman Empire, (coined during the rise of Emporor Augustus)and the Fall of the Roman Empire.\n\nPlease note: Biblical themes are not listed.  This is to ensure the list is focused on the Romans period.  Since there is a large number of Italian made productions,  I have limited the number listed; as not many, outside Italy, would of seen them.\n\n For those who are serious about Period Dramas and deem a movie/mini series worthy to be listed, add your comments.",

        "text": "A MUST have in any Period Drama collection. Buy it, steal it, whatever it takes, I recommend this superb BBC masterpiece for anyone to watch! Forget Ridley Scott's \"Gladiator\" (2000), this mini series make it look like a baby trying to walk and the villian Commodus a mere AMATUER!!! I, Claudius has it all:intrigue, madness, greed, seduction, murder, incest, vengence, hatred, lust, evil, scheming, malice and the list goes on. This is human nature in its purest form of sadism. Forget about history books, this is way better. One of the best, if not THE BEST, Roman drama series of it's time starring Derek Jacobi (one of my favourite British actors) and a perfect cast of talented English actors.\n\n***WARNING*** This was made in the 70's and does not have the budget of contemporary productions. Keep an open mind when watching this mini-series and judge for yourself\n\nI rarely give a 10/10...this is a 15/10\n\nThankfully a decent gladiator/roman movie to suit contemporary audiences. Besides the odd goofs (i.e. first part of movie, after opening battle scene, Maximus spends some quiet time with his horse, very visably you notice a pair of blue jeans, probably a crew member, backway), not a bad movie. Loved Joaquin Phoenix character, but wished he was more of a bastard.\n\nHaving seen both versions of Spartacus, the 1960 version with Kirk Douglas and the 2004 mini series, it was quiet difficult to chose which one to use. The script writer's historical imprefections aside, Kirk Douglas immortalized this character, although Sparactus was romaticized by Hollywood machine at the time. While Goran Visnjic version, was more truer to historical events, I felt something was lacking; and no fault of the actors, who tried to make this production feasiable.\n\nI've seen both versions of Cleopatra. The mini series 1999 and the movie version 1963; I've yet to see the 1934 with Claudette Colbert. To this date no-one I've seen has ever challenged Elizabeth Taylor as the perfect casting of the Queen of the Nile. Parts of it were inaccurate to history, but who cares? Great movie anyway you look at it. Very expensive and almost sent 20th Century Fox bankrupt to this date many critics regard it as a Flop.\n\nSet: during the Reign of Hadrian\n\nThis was a surprise. I thought I was seeing part Gladiator/part Braveheart. But this movie is based on the legendary 9th legend marched into Pict territory, in Britain, and was never heard of again...it gets weirder...its a true event that actually happened. Plenty of blood and gore, fighting and a vengeful mute girl. The standout for me, was the cinematography...breathtaking\n\nFor those who are interested in history, don't watch his TV Movie. It is a poor attempt to make veiwers more sympathic to Nero. For thoses who are just interested in less strenuous veiwing, this is for you. Its a depliction of Nero's life when he was young, to emporer and eventurally to his death. ***SPOILER*** the way Nero took his own life, by the lake, was a bit far fetched. And the girl he loved and lost years ago, just \"happened\" to see him bleeding by the waterside\"\n\nSet:during the Reign of Nero\n\nWhy is there another Quo Vadis listed? The reason is you need to really see the two Quo Vadis in order to see which one you prefer. The 1951 version with Robert Taylor or the Polish mini series 1985. I confess, I rather liked this version, but each to there own.\n\nFabulous cast, about two friends who suddenly became enemies. Visually it's sublime, acting is superb and the sets are magnificent. Top notch drama that only Hollywood can produce\n\n***SPOILER***the end was a too Disney like, where the Leper mother and sister disease was suddenly cured, by the blood of Christ, which \"happens\" to flow from his wounded body on the cross, to a stream to where the Ben Hur's mother, sister & wife to be \"happen\" to seek shelter from the storm.\n\nAfter years of civil war following the assassination of Julius Caesar, his adopted son Octavian manages to unite the various factions and assume control of the Roman Empire. Taking the name Augustus, he presides over an unparalleled period of growth and prosperity, but when he dies, the Empire is thrown into confusion by the corrupt and violent reigns of Tiberius and the insane Caligula."
