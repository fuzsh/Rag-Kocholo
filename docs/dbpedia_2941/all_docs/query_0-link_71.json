Proceed at your own discretion.\n\nRise together or fall alone.\n\nGodzilla x Kong: The New Empire[7], also known by the working title of \"Origins\" is a 2024 American science fiction monster film being produced by Legendary Pictures that acts as a sequel to the 2021 film Godzilla vs. Kong. It is the fifth entry in the MonsterVerse.\n\nIt was released to American theaters on March 29, 2024. and was released to other Countries in early April.\n\nThe film is directed by Adam Wingard, produced by Mary Parent, Alex Garcia, Jon Jashni, Brian Rogers, Thomas Tull, and Eric McLeod with the screenplay written by Terry Rossio, Jeremy Slater, and Simon Barrett. Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire begins three years after Godzilla vs. Kong, and see Godzilla and Kong team up to stop the tyrannical Skar King and his enslaved frost-breathing Titan Shimo from invading and destroying the surface.\n\nA follow-up sequel for the film, written by David Callaham[9] and directed by Grant Sputore[10], is in development. It will be released on March 26, 2027.[11]\n\nSynopsis[]\n\nThis latest entry follows up the explosive showdown of Godzilla vs. Kong with an all-new cinematic adventure, pitting the almighty Kong and the fearsome Godzilla against a colossal undiscovered threat hidden within our world, challenging their very existence – and our own. The epic new film will delve further into the histories of these Titans, their origins and the mysteries of Skull Island and beyond, while uncovering the mythic battle that helped forge these extraordinary beings and tied them to humankind forever.[12]\n\nPlot[]\n\nIn 2027, three years after Godzilla and Kong defeated a Ghidorah-influenced Mechagodzilla, Kong has established his territory in the recently discovered Hollow Earth. While on Earth's surface, Godzilla continues to maintain order between humanity and the Titans — defeating Scylla in Rome and resting in the Colosseum afterwards, claiming it as his territory.\n\nA Monarch observation outpost stationed in the Hollow Earth picks up an unidentified signal. On the Earth’s surface, the signal causes Jia, the last member of the Iwi tribe from Skull Island, to experience hallucinations and flashbacks, causing her and her adopted mother, Dr. Ilene Andrews, to worry. Also sensing the signal, Godzilla leaves Rome and makes his way to France, where he attacks a nuclear plant to absorb the radiation before traveling to the lair of the Titan Tiamat in Greenland. Monarch believes Godzilla is strengthening himself for an oncoming threat.\n\nWhen a sinkhole opens near his home, Kong discovers an uncharted region hidden within the Hollow Earth and a tribe of giant apes, including an adolescent named Suko. After an initial confrontation where Suko and the other apes attempt to capture him, Kong wins over Suko's trust by caring for him as the two start to slowly bond on their journey. Suko leads Kong to the tribe's lair, where their tyrannical leader, the Skar King, battles and injures Kong with the aid of an ancient ice-powered Titan named Shimo that Skar King controls with pain using a crystal. Shimo's ice breath injures Kong's right arm, but with Suko's help, he manages to escape after losing his axe.\n\nAndrews and Jia, alongside Titan veterinarian Trapper and conspiracy podcaster Bernie Hayes, travel to the Hollow Earth to find the source of the signal. After finding the Monarch outpost destroyed, they discover an uncharted subterranean section that houses the city of Malenka and the remaining members of the Iwi tribe, a group of people who communicate telepathically among each other and from whom Jia is descended. Inspecting some ruins, they surmise that the signal was a telepathic distress call sent by another civilization of Iwi that live in the Hollow Earth.\n\nAs Andrews observes Jia socializing with the Iwi, she voices her fears to Trapper that Jia may choose to stay with the Iwi and Andrews would have to accept it. Inside a temple, Andrews uncovers a prophecy: long ago, Skar King attempted to take over the surface world, and waged war against Godzilla's species in the process; Godzilla succeeded in trapping Skar King and his tribe deep within the Hollow Earth. The prophecy also states that Jia would be the key to reawakening Mothra, who was recently killed by Ghidorah in 2019. Kong, sensing Jia, locates the temple and is fitted by Trapper with an advanced prosthetic arm to strengthen and heal his frostbitten arm. Unbeknownst to them, one of Skar King's minions, One-Eye, follows them and informs his master as he assembles his invasion force for Earth. Jia successfully awakens the reborn Mothra.\n\nMeanwhile, Godzilla swiftly defeats Tiamat in Greenland in order to absorb the radiation from her lair, turning his dorsal plates magenta. Hoping to lure Godzilla to the Hollow Earth to assist him in battle, Kong surfaces in Cairo and calls out to Godzilla. Despite Kong's attempts to communicate, Godzilla mistakenly thinks his former rival is back for a rematch and attacks him, leading to the two Titans engaging in a brief fight until the reawakened Mothra arrives with Jia and intervenes, convincing Godzilla to aid Kong and help him fight against Skar King and his forces.\n\nGodzilla, Kong and Mothra return to the Hollow Earth, where they battle against Skar King, his army and Shimo with assistance from Suko and Monarch. Eventually, the fight carries Godzilla, Kong, Skar King and Shimo into Rio de Janeiro, where Shimo begins to induce a second Ice Age at Skar King's command. The factions are evenly matched until Suko arrives with Kong's axe and smashes the crystal that is controlling Shimo. Freed from Skar King's control, Shimo freezes him under Godzilla's orders before Kong shatters his frozen body into pieces, ending Skar King's reign of terror once and for all.\n\nAfter the battle, Godzilla reverses Shimo's ice age with his atomic breath before returning to Rome to rest in the Colosseum, Mothra restores the protective barrier of the Iwi’s home with her silk before flying away to look for a peaceful nesting ground and Kong, together with Shimo and Suko, returns to the Hollow Earth where he becomes the newfound leader of the tribe. At the same time, Jia reunites with Andrews and alleviates her fears by choosing to stay with her adopted mother.\n\nMothra's wail is heard after the credits rolled.\n\nCast[]\n\nRebecca Hall as Dr. Ilene Andrews, Monarch anthropological linguist\n\nBrian Tyree Henry as Bernie Hayes, Titan Truth Podcast host\n\nDan Stevens as Trapper, Monarch Titan veterinarian\n\nKaylee Hottle as Jia, Ilene's adoptive daughter\n\nFala Chen as the Iwi Queen\n\nAlex Ferns as Mikael, Monarch soldier\n\nRachel House as Hampton, Monarch director\n\nRon Smyck as Harris\n\nChantelle Jamieson as Jayne\n\nGreg Hatton as Lewis\n\nKevin Copeland as Submarine Commander\n\nTess Dobré as Submarine Officer\n\nTim Carroll as Wilcox\n\nAnthony Brandon Wong as Talk Show Announcer\n\nStaff[]\n\nStaff role on the left, staff member's name on the right.\n\nDirected by Adam Wingard\n\nWritten by Terry Rossio (screenplay), Jeremy Slater (screenplay), Simon Barrett (screenplay)\n\nProduced by Mary Parent, Alex Garcia, Jon Jashni, Brian Rogers, Thomas Tull and Eric McLeod\n\nMusic by Tom Holkenborg, Antonio Di Iorio[1]\n\nCinematography by Ben Seresin[1]\n\nEdited by Josh Schaeffer\n\nSpecial effects supervisor Bruce Bright\n\nCostume Designer Emily Seresin\n\nAdditional Literary Material Michael Dougherty\n\nAppearances[]\n\nMonsters[]\n\nGodzilla\n\nKong\n\nMothra\n\nSkar King\n\nShimo\n\nSuko\n\nScylla\n\nTiamat\n\nKong Tribe\n\nRed Stripes\n\nLeafwings\n\nWarbats\n\nHellhawks\n\nHollow Earth lizard\n\nVertacines\n\nWart Dogs\n\nParrot Frogs\n\nDrownvipers\n\nTree Mimics\n\nSkullcrawlers (mentioned)\n\nGhidorah (mentioned)\n\nMechagodzilla (mentioned)\n\nOrganizations[]\n\nMonarch\n\nApex Cybernetics (mentioned)\n\nVehicles[]\n\nHollow Earth Aerial Vehicle\n\nHMMWV\n\nWeapons[]\n\nKong's Battle Axe\n\nB.E.A.S.T.
