        "text": "“ No one hits my boyfriend. And no one kills my dad! ”\n\n–Will Solace after finding Nico and Apollo in Nero's throne room in The Tower of Nero.\n\nWilliam Andrew Solace is a sixteen-year-old[1] Greek demigod, the son of Apollo and Naomi Solace. He is a minor character in Percy Jackson and the Olympians and a recurring character in The Heroes of Olympus and The Trials of Apollo, and the deuteragonist of The Sun and the Star: A Nico di Angelo Adventure. Will is the current head counselor of Apollo's Cabin and a prominent healer at Camp Half-Blood. He is openly bisexual[2] and the boyfriend of Nico di Angelo,[3]\n\nHistory\n\nEarly Life\n\nWill was born in Austin, Texas to Naomi Solace, an alt-country singer, and Apollo, the Greek god of archery, music, light, prophecy, and medicine. His mother would take him on tour with her.\n\nWhen he was nine, Will was on tour with his mother when they stopped in New York City. They took great joy in riding the subway.\n\nLearning What He Is\n\nWhen Will was ten, he and his mother returned to New York City after a stop in Albany. When they are walking through Washington Square Park, a flock of pigeons, Stymphalian Birds, surrounded the pair and attacked them. Thankfully Maron, a satyr, was nearby and he was able to defend the mother and son. Maron went back with them to their hotel room and explained that Will is a demigod and brought him to Camp Half-Blood.\n\nEventually the son of Apollo became a year-round camper, although the details are currently unknown.\n\nJust under two years before the Battle of Manhattan, Will starts training under Michael Yew to be a medic and treats a new camper after he cuts himself in sword training.\n\nPercy Jackson and the Olympians\n\nThe Last Olympian\n\nDuring the Battle of Manhattan, Will took on the Williamsburg Bridge with his siblings, including Michael Yew, Austin Lake and Kayla Knowles.\n\nAfter Annabeth Chase was gravely wounded, and the bridge was collapsed (causing Michael to die in the process), Percy took Will to the Plaza Hotel to heal Annabeth, on a Yamaha FZ1. They narrowly avoided being pummeled by fruit by Pompona's Statue as they ran in. When they made it to Annabeth, Will became relieved when he saw the wound and said it wasn't bad, and if he arrived a few minutes later it would have been too late. Will told Annabeth to lay still and asked someone to hand him nectar. He poured nectar into the wound to clean it out, applied a silver paste, sang a hymn to Apollo in Ancient Greek to heal her, and applied bandages. The healing took a lot out of him, and he looked almost as pale as Annabeth. He then sent Travis Stoll to a store for mortal medical supplies, insisting that the Hermes campers leave some form of payment and not steal if it was possible.\n\nLater, Will and the other Apollo campers set up a makeshift hospital on Olympus to care for the wounded. Michael Yew was never found, so Will became the new head counselor of his cabin.\n\nThe Heroes of Olympus\n\nThe Lost Hero\n\nWill lent Annabeth his chariot from his cabin to borrow, and was very upset when it crashed in the lake. Will yelled at Annabeth, and said she could borrow it, not destroy it, and Annabeth apologized and promised to get it fixed. Will scowled at the chariot. Will also questioned why Leo, Piper, and Jason weren't claimed yet, since they looked way older than thirteen. Before Annabeth could explain, he asked if there was any sign of Percy, and Annabeth said no. After Leo was claimed, at Annabeth's request, Will took Leo to Hephaestus' Cabin to meet his bunk mates and give him a tour of Camp Half-Blood. Will said sure, and put a hand on Leo's shoulder as he walked him to the cabin, promising to explain everything.\n\nWill took Leo on a tour of the camp, which impressed Leo, who thought that Will was cool. Leo asked if he would get a sword, Will winced as if he found the notion disturbing, and Will said he would probably make his own in Cabin 9. Will also explained who his dad was, and how his name is Hephaestus, not Vulcan, and that it was good that he was claimed almost immediately. He began to mention a curse but stopped himself, making Leo worry. Will became concerned when Leo thought he saw Tía Callida, and Will said that he had a long day and the Mist was playing with his head.\n\nThe two entered the cabin, and Will asked Jake Mason where everyone was, who replied that they are down at the forges. Will then asked Jake if there was an extra bed for Leo, but Jake changed the subject to discuss the curses. Will was shocked when he gave Beckendorf's old bed to Leo, but he didn't protest. Will was even more shocked when he was told cabin 9 had underground rooms. Will and Jake began to tell Leo about the Second Titan War, and Will was in disbelief that Leo missed the whole thing. Will then walked Leo to the Forges to be acquainted with his siblings and he told him about Charles Beckendorf and the Curse of Cabin Nine. Will introduced Leo to his siblings and left them to get acquainted. Later, though not mentioned by name, Will was present when Piper was claimed by Aphrodite.\n\nAfter the Winter Solstice, Will attended a council meeting as a Head Counselor, absently wrapping and unwrapping an ace bandage around his wrist.\n\nThe Blood of Olympus\n\nWill attended a council meeting to discuss the Siege of Camp Half-Blood. He stopped an argument from breaking out between Clarisse La Rue and Rachel Elizabeth Dare by saying that it wasn't Rachel's fault that prophecies stopped working and put his hand on Clarisse's shoulder, calming her down and having her lower her dagger. Will explained that everyone in his cabin was affected, not just Rachel. He said he didn't know what was going on at Delphi and that Apollo hasn't answered any of his prayers or appeared in his dreams, and that this wasn't like Apollo. Will agreed when Jake Mason said that if Octavian was his descendant, he'd hide out in shame. He also said that wouldn't mind shooting Octavian off of his high horse, but that he wasn't a good enough archer, he's just a healer and wished he could use his father's gifts to stop the war. Chiron reassured Will that his talents would be essential before the end of the war.\n\nOn August 1st, Will helped deliver Chuck Hedge, the son of Gleeson and Mellie. While delivering, Gleeson told Will about Nico and how he was overexerting himself shadow travelling and using his powers.\n\nWill later saw Nico on Half-Blood Hill while he was scouting the enemy. He asked what Nico was doing there and Nico retorted to ask what he was doing, and said he would get himself killed covered in black but uncovering his mop of blonde hair. Will blushed and said that Lou Ellen Blackstone put some mist around him to protect him. Will also told Nico that Coach Hedge was fine and he had a cute satyr baby boy. He said he delivered it and asked if he ever delivered a baby, and Nico said no. Will then said his hands were still shaking and told Nico to feel them, grabbing his hand, but Nico yanked it away. Nico said they didn't have time for chitchat and when he began to suggest he shadow travel to the Romans tent, Will rejected it, and said that he cannot shadow travel. He said he could feel the darkness in him and he'd be in no shape for combat if he went to the tent. He said they can stop the Romans by sneaking around, but no shadow travel. Nico protested but Will was firm, aggravating Nico. He reluctantly agreed, as long as Will followed his lead.\n\nWill, Lou Ellen, Nico, and Cecil Markowitz snuck around, waiting for the chance to distract them. When the Romans saw them, Will ran and had six guards chase him as a diversion, which Nico deemed stupid. The Romans started to gain on Will and Nico had to run to save him by tripping one Roman and taking down six. Will thanked him, saying six at once isn't bad, and Nico said next time he'd let them run him down. When Nico used his powers to summon skeletons from the underworld, Will called him an idiot and said he cannot use his underworld powers, and when he said he was fine, Will insisted he wasn't. He put his arm around him and gave him healing gum to save him, and told him to not complain when he said it tasted like tar and mud. When Cecil came over, Will said that Nico will not be doing any Underworld magic. Nico quickly pushed himself off of Will when he realized he was leaning against him, and said he will do what he needs. Will rolled his eyes and called him Death Boy, which Nico hated.\n\nDue to his bickering with Nico, they allowed Cynocephali and Octavian to get close, but Will saved him and his friends by whistling, causing the Cynocephali to fall in agony. Cecil was bewildered and asked what he did, and Will explained his power. When Nico confronted Octavian and said he was leaving both camps for good, Will was shocked and asked why he would want that. Nico said it was because he never belonged, and Will became angry. He said no one at Camp had ever pushed him away, and that he pushed himself away. Octavian interrupted him and when he said Apollo showed him the future, Will became furious and said he was the son of Apollo, and called Octavian an anemic loser. He said his father did not show anyone the future, since prophecy is down, and said that what he was doing isn't what Apollo would want. Later, as the legion fell to the brink of war, Will tried to talk Octavian out of it, but he refused to listen. As the Greeks attacked, Will saved the day by whistling and alerting everyone that Reyna had arrived.\n\nAfter Gaea awoke, Will ran up to Nico and said one word: Octavian. They ran to him, only to find out he wanted to fire an onager to kill Gaea. They watched in horror as Gaea rose, but both boys were shocked when Leo Valdez flew in on Festus. Will didn't know how it happened, but they had other problems. They found Octavian, and will tried to talk him out of firing the onager, but Octavian didn't listen. Will tried to tell him that his robes were stuck and that this wasn't what Apollo would want, but again, he didn't listen. As Will tried to convince him again, Nico stopped him by saying they cannot stop him. Will stared at Nico in disbelief, but he didn't question him. They both watched as Octavian killed himself.\n\nIn the days following Gaea's awakening, Will spent most of his time in the infirmary healing the wounded. Nico didn't talk to him because he thought that Will believed he was a monster. After two days, Will confronted Nico while he spoke to Jason, and called him over. Will asked where Nico was, and he was angry that he didn't come to the infirmary to offer to help. When Nico insisted they wouldn't want him there, Will said that he should help him out and said that Nico was a friendly face, shocking the son of Hades. Will called him dense and said he hoped he got over the nonsense of wanting to leave Camp, and when Nico said he was staying, Will was relieved, saying he was dense, not stupid. He then ordered Nico to spend three days in the infirmary with him starting now, since he can't do magic without almost dying, making skeletal butterflies flutter in his stomach. After Nico went to talk to Percy and Annabeth, he went back to Will.\n\nBetween the Series\n\nFollowing the defeat of Gaea and the death of Leo, Nico spent a week helping Will out in the infirmary, although his efforts to help along with Dakota just lead to hilarity for Will as Nico and Dakota struggle to find the antiseptic cleaner. Despite how hard it was for Nico, his dedication caused Will to start looking at Nico differently and become romantically interested in Nico which Nico, unbeknownst to Will, noticed, as did Kayla Knowles, Austin Lake and Connor Stoll who drew Nico's attention to Will looking at him.\n\nA few days after Leo's death and after Nico's time helping out in the infirmary, a holographic scroll with a message, sent from the resurrected Leo, came fluttering into Camp Half-Blood on the wind, with Nico being the one to keep it in his jacket's pocket after the other campers had finished re-listening to it. While extremely relieved after learning of Leo's survival due to him having blamed himself for Leo's death and unable to forgive himself, Nico is also enraged at Leo for scaring him, so he looks at the scroll whenever he wants to get angry at Leo. At first after getting the message, Nico is consumed by his anger until Will takes him into the forest to scream out his anger at Leo's actions. As a result, Nico is left feeling better and understood as no one had ever done anything like that for him before, causing Nico to begin looking at Will in a romantic light as well.\n\nKnowing that Will likes him back, Nico decides to ask him out, but is too terrified each time he tries, unaware that Will feels the same way. Although Nico senses that something is there, it was still frightening for Nico to think about declaring it without knowing how Will or anybody else would react. Finally, based on what he's seen in the movies, Nico asks the satyrs and nymphs of Camp Half-Blood to help him set up a picnic in the woods as a romantic gesture towards Will, but Juniper and the others misunderstand Nico's request and instead throw him a huge camp-wide coming out party with Nico not realizing what's going on until Juniper announces that he has a big announcement to make. Although upset, Nico decides to own it and publicly tell Will that he's gay and ask him out, needing to know that he can be himself at camp and not hide in the shadows all of the time. Much to Nico's relief, none of the worst-case scenarios that he imagined occur and Will accepts, telling Nico that he would've said yes if Nico had just asked him without the party, coming out himself in the process. The fact that Nico, who wasn't the party type, went through all of that to tell Will he liked him impressed Will and helped to make it easier for Will to say who he is and stop hiding. Nico's coming out also gives Paolo Montes, Malcolm Pace and Jake Mason to come out as well.\n\nIn order to sit together with his new boyfriend during meals, Nico claims to Chiron that he somewhat loses control of his infernal powers while sitting alone at the Hades' Cabin table, and so he is therefore given permission to sit at the Apollo's Cabin's table instead, as Will produced a handy fake doctor's note, and Chiron decided it wasn't worth arguing about.\n\nAt one point, he and Will accidentally shadow traveled to the largest Cheez Whiz factory in Venezuela.\n\nThe Trials of Apollo\n\nThe Hidden Oracle\n\nWill cared for his father, Apollo, after he turned mortal, and carried him back to his cabin. Will tried to give him nectar, but his lips started steaming, almost killing him due to being mortal. When Apollo woke up, Will asked him if he knew who he was, and Apollo realized that Will was his son. Will told Apollo that his vital signs were completely human, how he almost killed him, and the state of his injuries. Will thought it was awkward that his father was the same age as him, and smiles at Apollo's complaints about being mortal, admitting that he'd rather find it humorous than freak out about it, and said that Meg seemed to be adjusting well to camp.\n\nWhen Austin and Kayla walked in, Will told them to go to the big house and tell Chiron that Apollo was awake. Will helped Apollo stand and led him outside to the big house. Will saw Nico say that Apollo had a strong aura of death, told Nico they need to talk about his people skills, and apologized to Apollo for his boyfriend. Will and Nico went together as buddies to tell the other campers that dinner was in an hour. Apollo did not understand Will’s attraction to a son of Hades but was happy if Will was happy.\n\nThat night, at dinner, Will sat with Nico (shoulder to shoulder), Apollo, Austin, and Kayla. Will bantered with Nico good-naturedly, reminding Apollo of him and Hyacinthus. Nico and Will told Apollo that Will gave Chiron a doctor's note so Nico could sit at their table, or else zombies would attack. Will and Nico also told Apollo the whereabouts of Percy, Annabeth, and the others from the Argo II. Later, While Chiron talked about the three-legged death race, Will was caught staring at Paolo's arms, and when Nico brought it up, Will said he was merely assessing how his arms functioned after surgery. Will said that no one wanted to do the race, but they couldn’t stand to disappoint Harley. Will bowed respectively along with everyone else when Meg was claimed.\n\nAfter Peaches attacked the campers, Will tended to Sherman's head injuries. Will came back to the cabin with Austin and Kayla and told them to get some sleep after his siblings questioned if Apollo was okay. Will put a blanket over Apollo, who was pretending to be asleep, and told him to sleep, soothing him. The next morning, Will and the others helped Apollo use the toilet, the shower, the sink, a toothbrush, and deodorant. Will also did morning boot camp with Apollo, and Apollo grumbled to Will about PE and asked where Clarisse was, and Will said she was in Arizona at college.\n\nFor the Three-Legged Death Race, Will and Nico were partners, tied to each other. Will mentioned how he missed Grover, and how Juniper misses him. Will and Nico ran off to the race. Later, Will and Nico cared for a dozen injured campers and reattached Paolo’s leg. Will wanted to look for Austin and Kayla, but as they were short on healers he felt he had to stay back and scolded Apollo into helping. Will and Nico set Valentina's broken arm while Apollo helped the others. The next day, Apollo and Meg went on a quest to find the Grove of Dodona and Will was at his going away party, with Billie, Malcolm, Paolo, and Nico. Will gave Apollo a combat ukulele, which he explained was the work of Harley, and told him the oath he made was stupid. Will was worried about Apollo and Meg, but Apollo reassured him that he would be back at dawn.\n\nThe next day, Nico and Will cared for Apollo in his cabin, after he showed up to camp without Meg at six in the morning. The two wanted to look for Meg, but Chiron rejected their request. Apollo had a concussion and Will healed him, and was asleep until noon. Nico and Will were worried about him and noticed that the hyacinths on the windowsill weren't there before. Will didn't want Apollo looking for Meg so soon, but Apollo told Will and Nico to protect the camp, and how the Roman emperors are alive. They were too shocked to go after Apollo when they learned the enemy was Nero.\n\nThat afternoon, Nico and Will were capsized in the middle of a canoe ride and rushed to help everyone when the Colossus Neronis attacked. Will and Nico shadow travelled away and stole Sherman’s chariot, and Will came back dragging Nico, who was half-conscious. Nico passed out, and Will went to get him Gatorade, and wished Apollo good luck. After the battle, Will care for the worst cases of hay fever in the camp epidemic.\n\nWhen Leo Valdez came back with Calypso on Festus, Will was one of the first campers to punch him. Will later started a bonfire in the amphitheater for a sing-along.\n\nThe Burning Maze\n\nAfter arriving at Aeithales, Apollo thinks of Will and how his son is doing at camp.\n\nThe Tyrant's Tomb\n\nHis father thinks of him when thinking of his boyfriend Nico while he is dying of a zombie infection. However, Apollo knows that despite his immense skill as a healer, Will is unlikely to be able to cure him anymore than the healers in New Rome could and is grateful that the two demigods are not at Camp Jupiter as they would just be adding to the numbers of people worrying about him.\n\nThe Tower of Nero\n\nWhen his father and Meg return to camp six months later, he hugs Apollo and gives him a glass of lemonade. He catches Apollo when the mortal god passes out. The following morning he greets his father as he emerges from the shower and tells him the others have gone for a hike. It's then revealed that Will bought Apollo clothes on his last trip into the city, hoping it would make Apollo more comfortable in camp. As they exit they meet up with the Apollo campers and head to breakfast, after informing his dad of his boyfriend's stress and voices the two are called to the head table by Dionysus. Meg joins them and they talk about the prophecy, where it is revealed that while Will told Nico most of it, he had missed out the lines regarding Nico directly. Nico is not impressed about this, but reveals that he knows what it means. Will tries and fails to talk him out of it, clearly not wanting Nico to go alone but also not wanting to go with him, before reluctantly joining him in gathering supplies for the son of Hades's \"friends\". They spend the day gathering supplies and the following morning he and Nico go with his father and Meg to Brooklyn.\n\nArgus drops them off a block from there destination and they walk the rest of the way. Rachel lets them in and warns them of the cows. She explained that three cattle cared filled with livestock appeared out of no where the other day and they were not given food or water. She called the authorities, but they could not see them. They then change the conversation to Nero. Rachel conforms the Fasces is located in a vault on a heavily fortified floor in the central levels of the towers along with the holding cells. When Rachel mentions what looks like a heavily guarded and fortified water treatment plant under the building with pipes connecting to the city's, he and the son of Hades confirm that they know people, the Troglodytes who can tunnel into and out to sabotage the system without Nero knowing. Soon Rachel utters a prophecy in Python's voice before she passes out and the cattle start breaking into the property. He carries Rachel until she regains consciousness and passes her to the daughter of Demeter as they escape the mansion before it collapses in on itself and they make their way to a construction site with a fifty foot pit. They jump onto a crane as some of the cattle, which his father recognizes as the troglodytes natural enemy Tauri Sylvestres, fall into the pit and choke to death on their anger. As they question their next move and if Nero is responsible for the cattle, his boyfriend thinks he can get everybody out via Shadow Travel. When the reach the bottom of the pit Nico says he can only take two with him at most and Apollo and Meg tell the son of Hades to take him and Rachel as they stay behind and fight one of the bulls as it slides into the pit.\n\nAs Nico recovers after passing out when he brings Apollo and Meg to an underground cavern, he and the others talk about their strategy as that his father and Meg only have a few hours to surrender if they are going to follow Lu's plan. When Nico regains consciousness he takes the four to the troglodytes and the son of Apollo reluctantly glows to give them some light. As soon as Nico announces their presence, they are surrounded and one, the leader Screech-Bling, asks if the son of Hades companions are offerings. Nico says no and offers them a skink instead. They accept it and take them to their camp where he is ignored by the residents, much to his annoyance. When they are given hats at dinner he is given a lamp shade, much to his annoyance. As his father, Nico, and Rachel make a case for them to help them, the troglodytes agree until the forest bulls attack. During the chaos he, Nico, and Rachel are separated from Apollo and Meg.\n\nHe aids in the Battle of Nero's Tower and separates from Nico early on, stating that he's needed elsewhere. At some point, he runs into Rachel, Screech-Bling, and Luguselwa, whose stumps he ties daggers to and redresses with fresh bandages. The troglodyte informs him they have disabled the gas and the four make their way to the throne room. When they arrive he sees his boyfriend on the floor and orders the fighting to stop. It does so immediately and he retrieves the injured Nico, snapping at the Germani to get out of his way. None of Nero's forces try to stop him. He heals the son of Hades as Apollo as his father and Nero fight over the fasces and witnesses the emperor disintegrate before his eyes. He, Rachel, and Nico look for supplies when Apollo asks for some. When they gather enough he gives his father a knowing look before the mortal god goes to fight Python.\n\nTwo weeks after Python's defeat, his father returns to camp as a god and he joins Will, Nico, and Rachel at the campfire. When Rachel mentions spending a year in Paris, the son of Apollo jokes about a possible date in the French capital with the son of Hades and Nico reveals that he believes that Iapetus has been calling him from Tartarus for help. Will becomes jealous until his boyfriend explains that the guy he wants to help is a Titan. Nico and Will plan to travel to Tartarus with the help of the troglodytes in hopes of finding out what happened to Iapetus and rescue him if possible, but Rachel gives them a prophecy that Will admits isn't good news.\n\nThe Sun and the Star: A Nico di Angelo Adventure\n\nTwo months after stopping Triumvirate Holdings, as the summer session ends, he and Nico walk with Austin and Kayla to Half-Blood Hill. As they walk, the son of Hades is asked which Star Wars character he would date and answers Darth Vader. When they arrive, Austin and Kayla are nervous about their travel arrangements as Chiron calls the Gray Sisters' Taxi. As it arrives, Austin reveals his mother moved to Harlem after he got into school there and Kayla is going back to Toronto. Will says he is staying at camp as his mother is touring for her new album. As Will's siblings leaves, he and Nico- the only demigods currently at camp- walk to the Dining Pavilion. When they arrive, they see Chiron and Dionysus talking.\n\nLater that night, he hears Nico screaming from inside his own cabin and goes over to help. When the son of Hades awakens, he kicks the son of Apollo out of shock. As Will hugs Nico, Chiron arrives with Rachel Elizabeth Dare, saying she needs to tell Nico something. Rachel recites the prophecy she emitted two weeks after Nero's down fall and says that is the twelfth time she recited it. Chiron is unnerved by revelation as Dionysus walks in with a bowl of popcorn. Nico tells them everything about insists that he must go to Tartarus to get Iapetus back. Chiron and Dionysus are hesitant as they question if Bob has truly reformed or if it is a trap. As Dionysus mentions that Hades closed off the Underworld to the living, Nico says they will be in and out before his father notices. Chiron states he will need three to go on a quest and Nico insists he and Will go as Percy and Annabeth managed the previous summer. They question Nico leaving something of equal value behind and he fears Will might sacrifice himself. The son of Apollo says he will not make sure Nico does not either and Chiron reluctantly agrees to authorize the quest.\n\nIn the morning, Chiron helps Nico and Will pack their bags and has them take Ambrosia and Nectar. After taking a mortal cab to the train station, they ride the rails to Manhattan. Along the way, Will tells Nico of the time he and his mother came to New York City and says the first time he was in the city his satyr found him and brought him to Camp Half-Blood. As they reach the penultimate train stop, Nico decides to take a detour. When the train reaches Penn Station, they head out to go up town. As they head to the subway, a tourist spills her drink on Will. They make their way to the subway and, after several delays, reach the Jackson-Blofis Apartment and are greeted by Sally Jackson and Estelle Blofis. After explaining their quest, and stating they only want advice from Percy, Sally says Percy should have a free period at the moment and takes them to him room where they use a humidifier and a lamp to contact Percy. After sending an Iris Message, they speak to Percy and Annabeth. After Sally leaves the room, Nico and Will explain their quest and Percy and Annabeth express their guilt that they forgot about Bob. After the son of Poseidon and daughter of Athena fail to talk them out of it, they tell the sons of Hades and Apollo that their best chance at surviving Tartarus is to stick together. They end the call and, after saying goodbye to Sally, continue on.\n\nNico and Will head to the southern most point of Central Park and stop at a pile of rocks. Nico explains that these are the Door of Orpheus and Will needs to sing to open them. After Nico explains he will ask the Troglodytes for help as a favor for finding them a new home in the Underworld, Will expresses criticism that they would help the people who destroyed their home in the first place. The son of Apollo reluctantly agrees to sing and the doors open. Before the doors close, Nico thinks he saw something and tells Will, but brushes it aside. As they descend the stars, Will expresses his concern as Nico comforts him. Eventually Nico welcomes Will to the Underworld, but he as they are still on the stairs and asks the son of Hades what he means. Soon Nico realizes they are still on the stairs and questions what it means. The boys continue on and they both see a light. However they soon find themselves back in Central Park at night and he collapses to his knees in exhaustion. Nico helps him up and they open the Door of Orpheus again. This time, Will glows and they reach the Underworld. However, the son of Apollo collapses in exhaustion and struggles to stay awake and falls asleep. Nico tries to wake him to little success. Will finds himself awake and runs after Nico, who has gained an energy boost. Nico jumps into the River Styx and urges Will to follow. The son of Apollo reluctantly jumps in and feels as if he is swimming in fire. Nico quickly gets out and Will follows him. Soon Nico vanishes and Will becomes unnerved. Soon a shadowy shroud envelopes Will and he is too tired to fight back. Will soon wakes up and Epiales, a demon who has trapped them in a dream as they were going down the stairs, puts them both back to sleep. Will dreams of the day he, Nico, Rachel, Meg McCaffrey, and his father ran from the Tauri Sylvestres. The son of Apollo sees his boyfriend motionless and struggles to heal him as the others mock Will's healing abilities. Nico then wakes up and drains Will of light. Soon Will wakes up and, realizing everything he experienced was in dreams, he blasts the demon with light upon seeing Nico in danger. Epiales looks at Will in shock and says the boys will meet their mother soon enough. Will hesitates in finishing the demon off, but does so after they try to attack Nico. After Nico thanks him, the son of Apollo passes out.\n\nNico watches over him as the son of Apollo rests. When Will wakes up, he explains how he has been training with his control over light. The two set out and Will tells Nico his dream Epiales gave him. When they reach the River Styx, Nico points out a path past a waterfall to avoid Hades and Will puts a sweatshirt to cover as much skin as possible. The boys make it past the waterfall and Nico calls out to the troglodytes. Screech-Bling welcomes the pair and takes them to his people's new home. The demigods are impressed by what they did and are surprised the troglodytes have rerouted the River Styx and Screech-Bling says his kind have no ill effect from the water. He takes Nico and Will to the communal dining area and Click-Wrong gives the boys human food. They enjoy it and he reveals it is tomato soup with lizard and shoe laces. Nico laughs while Will shutters in disgust. Soon the troglodytes start sniffing the demigods and they reveal they have been smelling the same thing for the past few weeks. After thinking, Nico gets an idea about who is sending him the dreams and the son of Hades asks Screech-Bling to call his council. Screech-Bling leaves and the demigods follow him. Once the council is gathered and introduce themselves- Howl-Smith, Clack-Jones, Shriek-Vibes, and Hiss-Majesty- Nico reveals that he thinks they are going to face Nyx. The troglodytes are shocked as Will questions who Nyx is. After Nico explains, she is a being older then the gods and titans, the son of Hades reveals that he met her before, causing an uproar. Will is stunned and Nico reveals it was too hard for him to share and told no one. After saying he needs to tell it now, the son of Hades reveals what happened the last time he was in Tartarus.\n\nAfter Nico finishes his story, Will and the troglodytes stare at him in shock. After retelling the story, Nico wells up and cries into Will's shoulder. After Nico calms down, the troglodytes express their concern that Nyx is after them in an attempt to get to Nico. The sons of Hades and Apollo theorize that Bob has been trying to get help from Nico as Nyx is trying to force him to be his old self as she thinks people can only be one thing for their life and cannot accept that they can change. The troglodytes agree to house Nico and Will until mushroom-glow, their equivalent of morning. Will expresses his displeasure with the Underworld, hurting Nico. After they are taken to the nursery, they fall asleep. Will dreams of the day he met his satyr, Maron. However soon Maron and his mother tell Will Nico will abandon him. Will wakes up to find Nico missing and he finds him outside the nursery. Nico offers hm brother and Will is hesitant until Nico says the troglodytes diet is mostly similar to a human's. Screech-Bling and Hiss-Majesty arrive and take them to a tunnel. Will gives Hiss-Majesty his sun globe and they crawl through. Will starts to become claustrophobic and hums a song his mother wrote about her time with his dad. The son of Apollo starts to glow and Nico suggests he conserve his energy. As the four near the end of the tunnel, Screech-Bling says they have one more obstacle.\n\nThey emerge from the tunnel and Will is exhausted, Nico rests him on a boulder as Screech-Bling and Hiss-Majesty hunt for lizards. As Will rests, Nico looks into the distance at his father’s palace and realizes he is unfamiliar with this part of the Underworld. Will asks Nico if Hades was always in Nico's life, Nico says his father was and Will says he only learned what he was at ten and only met Apollo years later. Will expresses his desire to meet Hades the next time they are in the Underworld. Soon the troglodytes return and say they must pass a farm. Will is shocked that a farm could function in the Underworld and, unknown to the son of Apollo, Nico is hurt by his comment. Soon they find the farm and spot a bull man with red skin. He spots the four and runs over to them, saying they will not get away. The bull man greets them and Nico introduces him as Menoetes, a demon assigned to tend to Hades's cattle. After inadvertently revealing their quest, Menoetes informs them he must tell Hades they are in the Underworld. However, Menoetes agrees to keep their presence a secret if they go on a quest for him. Nico asks what he wants, and Menoetes says he wants them to sneak into Persephone's Garden to steal fruit for his boyfriend Geryon. Reluctantly, Nico agrees to the quest and Menoetes calls forth donkeys for the demigods to ride on. Screech-Bling and Hiss-Majesty stay on the farm as the demigods head out.\n\nAs they travel, Will feels a rush like never before. When they reach Hades' Palace, the boys dismount and Will is disturbed by the images of death on the gates. Nico leads the pair to a hidden gate and opens it with a bone from his pocket. They sneak inside and the son of Apollo is captivated by all the plants and the sight of Persephone. Nico tells him to stay vigilant as the Queen of the Underworld moves to the far side of the garden. The boys wonder if they were set up, but Will thinks Menoetes is genuine in wanting to surprise his boyfriend. Nico takes Will to the center of the garden and they take pomegranates. While Nico is unable to touch them, Will easily picks three of them. They boys sneak back to the gate and, as Nico scouts ahead, Persephone finds Will. He notices that Nico is frozen in place and the son of Apollo struggles to give Persephone a straight answer as he tries to explain they trespassed to get Meneotes to let them continue their quest. However the goddess does not get angry and explains that she grew to care for Nico. When Will asks how she can love the Underworld, Persephone explains that she grew to love it after getting to know its perks and love and understanding is vital in a relationship, romantic or not. Persephone shows Will a flower that only blooms in the presence of darkness and he is shocked that he has darkness within him. As Persephone says it is key to balance one’s light and dark sides, Will hands over the pomegranates and Persephone tells Will to keep them and not tell Nico about their conversation. The goddess leaves and Nico, unaware of the conversation, unfreezes and tells Will they have to go.\n\nBack at the farm, Nico and Will see Hiss-Majesty joyfully herding cattle. When they arrive and present Menoetes with the pomegranates, the bull man eats one and explains he is happy where he is. As Will recounts their quest to the troglodytes, Menoetes tells Nico that many residents of the Underworld -including himself- have heard Bob’s scream. The bull man recounts a sighting one of his workers said upon regenerating that Nyx is forcing Bob to stay in a regeneration blister until he becomes Iapetus again. The demigods are angered as they learn it is agonizing to stay in one for too long. Menoetes tells Nico and Will that once they enter Tartarus, they should emerge close to a swamp where the hut of Damasen is located and that Bob is not far from there. Screech-Bling and Hiss-Majesty tell Nico and Will they must keep going. The bull man waves goodbye as they walk. As they walk along a slope, Will becomes sluggish. They spot a pair of drakons and try to avoid them, but Will falls down the side of the slope and Nico shouts, attracting the drakons. Nico goes over to his boyfriend as the troglodytes distract the drakons. Nico inspects Will, who is unconscious, as Screech-Bling comes over having just narrowly avoided the drakon's flames. After Screech-Bling offers to watch over Will, the son of Hades attacks the drakons. The son of Hades manages to kill one and scare off the other. They tend to the son of Apollo’s injuries and, when Will can stand, they move out. As they walk, he slowly heals, but his wounds soon open along with a fresh gash in his torso. Soon they reach the River Acheron, where souls who are deemed to evil for the fields of punishment are bathed to cleanse them of their past actions. The demigods, believing they have to win in it , are hesitant and start to argue. Once the fighting dies down, Screech-Blings says they can take a boat and points out a woman by a hut. The troglodytes turn back, with Hiss-Majesty saying they will return to Menoetes's farm. The say their goodbyes and Nico and Will head towards the hut.\n\nAs they reach the hut, the woman -a nymph- greets the two and introduces herself as Gorgyra. Both Nico and Will, having never heard of her- look at each other in confusion and Gorgyra is not surprised. She explains that her husband, Acheron merged with the river one day and since then, she has been weaving the souls of the depressed and remorseful into her dress. Nico hears the voices of the souls and tears up. Soon the nymphs pulls a thread of soul from the sons of Hades and Apollo and they are shocked and disturbed by what they hear. She says they can use her canoe to cross into Tartarus, as it will allow them to survive the trip but still experience the effects of the river. When the boys ask what the catch is, the nymph says she wants them to tell her their story. Once they catch up to the present, Nico and Will tell Gorgyra about the gifts they exchanged after the Battle of Nero's Tower. Will gave Nico a bronze coin with a replica of Will's stylized sun tattoo on one side and the Helm of Darkness one the other, and Nico gave Will his skull ring. Gorgyra is impressed by their story and feels sympathy for the pain they felt, but says they need the pain to grow as people. The demigods board the canoe and set sail, hoping for the best. As Nico and Will set out, they hear the souls of the Acheron shouting at them, telling them they are vial for all their past actions. Nico and Will do what they can to tone it out, with the son of Hades being more successful then the son of Apollo, as they fall into Tartarus. As they fall, they feel like they are falling for days. Nico and Will see only darkness and hears the agonizing screams from the river. Soon they see clouds that Nico realizes is blood. When the ground comes into view, Will tells Nico he believes in him and the son of Hades summons countless bones to create a ramp to guide them to the ground. When they stop, Will laughs and compliments Nico on his quick thinking and the son of Hades welcomes the son of Apollo to Tartarus.\n\nNico passes out soon after and Will watches over the son of Hades. As he watches his boyfriend, Will thinks of their argument and decides to apologize. The son of Apollo starts to freak out upon realizing where he is, but quickly calms down. Will looks around Tartarus and is unnerved by the sights around him, however he is curious after seeing several Regeneration Pods on a hill. After covering Nico with the canoe, the son of Apollo goes to investigate. He climbs up the hill, theorizing the goo might have healing properties, but stumbles when he gets close to the top. Will slides down and his foot penetrates a blister, burning it. He pulls out his injured foot and a flock of Stymphalian Birds appear. They swarm around Will and do not attack. They pick him up and, as he is carried away, Will sees something inspecting the canoe. Will tries to steer the Stymphalian Birds back to Nico and his shirt rips, causing him to fall into a field of regeneration blisters. He bounces off them and soon they open to reveal Cynocephali and they attack the son of Apollo. As Will fends off both the birds and the dog men, a saber tooth tiger appears and attacks the dog men. Soon it runs towards Will and sprints into a cat. Will realizes this is Small Bob and the cat transforms back as more dog men appear and Will uses his ultrasonic whistle to stun them. Will sees Nico running up to him with the creature from earlier and the son of Hades introduces him as a mania named Amphithemis and says he is looking for Dionysus. After seeing Small Bob injured, Will says the dog men have the child and Amphithemis attacks them as the demigods and Small Bob run. When they get a good distance away, Nico berates Will as he was planning on helping Amphithemis pass on and chastises the son of Apollo for leaving him alone. Soon they fight and Will breaks down in tears and apologizes. He patches up Nico to the best of his ability but suspects the son of Hades will have light scarring on his cheek from Amphithemis. They head back to the canoe.\n\nWill rests as Nico wonders if meeting Amphithemis was orchestrated by Nyx. When Will wakes up, he apologizes for leaving Nico and the son of Hades forgives him. They then try to figure out which direction to go as Will downs the last of their one of two canteens of nectar. The two notice Small Bob tying to push the canoe back into the river and they theorize they will reach the hut if they sail down the river. Will and Small Bob jump in as Nico pushes the canoe and, ignoring the voices of the souls, jumps in and the three set sail.\n\nAs they sail down the Acheron, Will falls asleep and wakes up when they reach the stomach. The boys cough as they realize they are being digested. Small Bob meows and Will notices mangrove trees and realizes they are in the swamp. The son of Apollo jumps out and wades through the river of pain to beach the canoe. Once a shore, Nico gets off and Will apologizes for not seeing the beauty of the Underworld. Soon they see seven Cynocephali and Nico, who say he had a feeling they were being followed, summons the dead to fight them. However, a skeletal creature forms and attacks the dog men. The boys and Small Bob try to flee, but a second created appears in front of them. As the first monster finishes off the Cynocephali, Nico attacks the second and it calls out in pain before the first asks why he attacked them. The boys look on, confuses as the monsters introduce themselves as Carl and Bartholomew, a pair of Aetera. The aetera beg the demigods to kill them so that they can collect more bones and threaten to eat them when they refuse. Small Bob kills the aetera, much to their joys, and Nico and Will vow to keep this interaction to themselves. They trudge through the swamp for hours and Nico helps Will stand. Will says he feels himself fading as Nico talks about their past experiences and his life before meeting Percy. When Will reveals he is scared Nico will leave him behind to save Bob, the son of Hades swears on the Styx and the two demigods admit their love for each other. Soon they reach the hut and Nico calls out for Damasen. The son of Hades searches the hut and is shocked that no one is inside. As they wonder why Damasen has not regenerated since the Battle For Control of the Doors of Death, the two desire to shelter at the hut. They start a fire on some bones and Will is able to feel some sense of relief. Nico soon falls asleep and he curls up next to him soon after. Nico wakes up and walks outside, Will joins him soon after and, after Nico fails to convince Will to rest more, the demigods head out. As they walk, Will hums a sing his mother wrote and asks Nico about his mother. The son of Hades says he remembers few things before his mother’s death and thinks of them as someone else’s, which he says is a coping mechanism used by those dealing with post traumatic stress. As they trudge on, Will starts to weaken and Nico takes out their last piece of ambrosia. Will tells him to save it for when they really need it. Soon they reach a wall of darkness that only Nico can see, remembering it from his first trip to Tartarus, Nico realizes they are close. He urges Will, who does not believe there is anything in front of them, to trust him and they enter. Soon Will sees what Nico sees and Nico almost falls into an invisible abyss, but Will catches him. Soon they find Bob.\n\nNico and Will go over to the pod and sees Bob shift from Iapetus to Bob and back again. Nico apologizes to Bob for taking so long and Bob says he was worried he could not hear him, however Bob becomes confused when Nico mentions a prophecy. Bob says it is not only Nyx who is doing this to him. Nico tries to slice open the pod and fails as Will fails to open the pod with sound. Bob says they must do it together and they demigods break the pod open. The boys and Small Bob hug Bob until they notice Nyx is behind them. The goddess unfolds her wings to reveal an army consisting of Cynocephali, Telekhines, Pit Scorpions, and dark pegesai, as well as Nemesis and Hypnos and Dr. Thorn. As Nyx starts to talk about tourism to her realm increasing, Nemesis and Hypnos silently criticize their mother's optimism for tourism as Nico demands Nyx let him and his companions go. Dr. Thorn goes to attack, but Nyx traps him in a vortex of darkness. A fight breaks out and Nico and his companions manage to hold off Nyx's forces with Will managing to hurt one of Nyx's wings. Soon Will goes limp and Nico rushes over to him. Nico urges Will to eat their last piece of ambrosia, but the son of Apollo refuses as the Mansion of Night appears and Will starts to lose what is left of his mental strength. Soon Bob breaks free and him and Small Bob attack Nyx as her children and minions watch. Soon the Mansion of Night catches on fire and Bob and Small Bob run over to the demigods, they pick up Will and leave Nyx's realm. Upon exiting, they find themselves by the River Phlegethon and the River Cocytus, causing the group to realize Nyx's realm moves around. When the goddess of night appears before them, she accuses them of arson, but they pin the blame on her children as Nemesis, Hypnos, and Epiales appear from behind. Nyx ignores her children's pleas to stop as Nico, Will, and Bob say they have changed and so can Nyx. Nyx ignores their words as she pushes Nico to reveal a detail he left out about telling the truth when the time comes and that if Nyx and her children fail to stop Nyx, Nico's children will. The four look at Nyx in confusion and the goddess calls forth over a dozen shadowy figures and claims they are the son of Hades's offspring.\n\nWill questions what Nyx means and Bob offers to destroy the figures, but Nico stops him and goes over to the creatures and realizes they are Cacodemons, beings Nyx creates out of negative mentions. The goddess introduces each one to Nico as the son of Hades's worst memories appear before him. Nyx takes this as proof that Nico is meant to be guided by trauma his entire life and Nico attacks the goddess. Nico summons the dead and Bob and Will soon join in. After realizing Nico has been his driving force the entire quest, Will manifests the ability to inflict sickness and gives Nyx hay fever. The goddess commands the cacodemons to defend her and they swarm the son of Apollo. Nico commands the cacodemons to stop attacking the son of Apollo and they obey with the commands from Nyx being cancelled out. Nyx commands her children to attack, but they refuse and subdue the goddess of night as Nico tells Nyx she helped him over come his trauma and, after remembering the prophecy, releases the cacodemons to be their own beings and fulfills the prophecy. Bob picks up Will and Nico and jumps into the combined rivers, shielding the demigods from the effects. When they make it ashore, Nemesis appears and tells them she will do what she can to increase their chances of getting out and tells them to never return. When the canoe arrives, they sail the river of pain and see Nyx transform into a black hole. Nico and Will start to panic, but Bob tells them they are safe and points out that the river of pain spins silent. They watch as Nyx touches the Acheron and her skin burns. Nico realizes that since Nyx is nothing but pain and agony, the river rejects her. The group sees a hoard of cacodemons are running along the river and Nico realizes they want to come with them. The son of Hades tells Bob to stop so they could board despite Will's hesitation. As the cacodemons board the canoe. Nico starts to cry at the thought that the quest might finally be over and falls asleep. He reflects on their journeys as Bob cries tears of joy. Nico wakes up and Will apologizes for his behavior and wanting to change a part of Nico that could never be changed. Nico forgives him and the two kiss as Bob calls them his sun and star. Nico falls back asleep and one of the cacodemons curls up next to him as the son of Apollo drifts into sleep, thinking about how love has led him to happiness with Nico.\n\nThey emerge in the Long Island Sound and Bob guides them to camp. Chiron greets them and says they have been gone a week. After Bob announces he is going west, he says goodbye to the demigods and Chiron and Chiron invites to boys to breakfast as the Dining Pavilion. When they arrive, Dionysus greets them and tithe sons of Hades and Apollo takes turns recounting the quest. By the end of it, Dionysus is happy with the outcome and intrigued by the cacodemons. Soon Nico goes back to his cabin to rest and make a call. After breakfast, he returns to his cabin and speaks with Austin and Kayla. Soon Nico arrives and he ends the call. Nico and Will talk about how their experience in Tartarus brought certain aspects of their relationship to life. Will again apologizes for wanting to change Nico and Nico accepts it. As they lay side by side, the cacodemons enter and cuddle up with them.\n\nAppearance\n\nWill is noted as having a surfer-body, shaggy curly blond hair, blue eyes, and having an athletic build. His appearance reminds Nico of Jason Grace in The Blood of Olympus. He typically dresses casually in a T-shirt and shorts.[4] Rick Riordan has stated that Will is in Nico's age group, making him about 15 years old.[5] In The Hidden Oracle, Will estimates Apollo's appearance as Lester to be about his age, fifteen.\n\nIn The Tower of Nero, it is revealed he has a stylized sun tattoo on his left pectoral.\n\nIn The Sun and the Star: A Nico di Angelo Adventure, Will's skin becomes waxy and he gains eye bags due to being weakened from being so far away from the sun while traveling through the Underworld and Tartarus. Nico describes Will as having looked like soggy ambrosia during this time. After returning to the mortal world, Will's appearance quickly begins to return to normal from exposure to the sun.\n\nPersonality\n\nWill is a caring person who is willing to help out anyone who needs to be healed. He cares greatly for his siblings and aided his father when the fallen god was at camp. Will also has a calming disposition, as shown when he calms down Clarisse during a counselor meeting. During Nico's dream in The Blood of Olympus Will felt inadequate because he is a medic and not much of a skilled fighter. Despite this, Will has risked his life in battle on multiple occasions rather than staying on the sidelines as a healer, showing great bravery, even willing to travel into Tartarus itself to help Nico rescue Bob.\n\nBecause of seeing himself as only a healer, Will appears to often underestimate just how powerful he really is, even if his powers aren't usually as flashy as his siblings. During the Siege of Camp Half-Blood, Will's more subtle ultrasonic whistle proved much more useful at diffusing the situation than his archery abilities or anyone else's combat abilities because it forced everyone to pause rather than just charging into battle with each other, giving Reyna the time that she needed. During his time in Tartarus, despite feeling extremely drained, Will was strong enough to inflict hay fever upon a primordial goddess while tapping into his plague powers for the very first time, something that Will accomplished by embracing and channeling his own inner darkness.\n\nWith a tendency to overwork himself, Will is extremely dedicated to his work, even going so far as to not sleeping for days on end. He has also developed a kind of shell, meaning that even in extremely stressful situations he at least looks calm and collected.\n\nDuring his and Nico's quest to Tartarus, Will is shown to struggle with the nature of the Underworld, seeing it as a place of evil due to his role as a healer being to keep people from going there. However, after experiencing it, Will finally understands that it's a place of life and death, not evil and a spark of hope in the darkness. Will's beliefs about fighting darkness instead of accepting and living with it also causes him to struggle to understand Nico and to accept the darkness within himself. However, after talking with Persephone about accepting his darkness and loving someone from the Underworld, Will opens his mind more and he finally begins accepting the darkness in himself and Nico, even embracing his own darkness to fight Nyx. Will later tells Nico that he finally understands that it's not about conquering or vanquishing or healing the darkness, sometimes its better to learn to live with it.\n\nRelationships\n\nLove Interests\n\nNico di Angelo\n\n“ I find this fascinating. Sometimes mortals are not aware of the threads that bind them. You could both be wrong about the first time you met, and yet the two of you have orbited each other for so long, like heavenly bodies in the sky. ”\n\n–Gorgyra talking about Nico and Will's connection in \"The Sun and the Star: A Nico di Angelo Adventure.\n\nWill's relationship with Nico was never touched until The Blood of Olympus. When Nico arrives at the camp near Thalia's tree he is surprised to see Will planning on stalling the Roman camp. He told Nico he was doing this to get fresh air after helping Mellie give birth to her satyr baby boy and held Nico's hand to show how he was still nervous about helping her give birth, which \"sent an electric current\" down Nico's spine to his shock and he withdrew his hand. Will immediately notices Nico's condition and nags him on not using shadow traveling (or \"Underworld-ly stuff\") anymore on his orders as a doctor. The two continue to bicker through their mission to at least make sure the onagers would not fire on Camp Half-Blood. When Nico stated that he was leaving both Camp Jupiter and Half-Blood, Will became upset and demanded a reason and berated him for thinking he didn't belong, saying that Nico has a lot of friends or at least people who'd like to be his friends at camp. Another blatant hint of a possible attraction is Will asking for his company in the infirmary. When Nico confessed his feelings to Percy, he walked away towards Will. This can be seen as symbolic of Nico ultimately choosing Will over Percy. After meeting Will outside the camp, Nico remembers his arrival with Apollo at the camp years before and how Thalia had referred to him as \"hot.\" Nico didn't understand why he'd suddenly be thinking of that moment, but it was likely an indication of his attraction to Will, as the latter is a son of Apollo, sharing many of his divine father's traits. Nico also notes that in comparison to Will, Octavian looks like a watered-down, unhealthy version of Will, without anything in him that makes a child of Apollo special.\n\nIn The Hidden Oracle, it is revealed that at some point after Gaea's defeat, the two begin dating, with Will at one point affectionately referring to Nico as his boyfriend. Will's father, the former god Apollo, is completely supportive of their relationship, due to him having had several mortal boyfriends himself. They continue their playful banter with each other and are usually seen sitting close by, holding hands. In fact, Apollo claims that Nico and Will are so cute together as a couple, that it made him feel desolate, jogging his memories of the time he had spent with his mortal boyfriend Hyacinthus, one of Apollo's two all-time favorite lovers (the other being Daphne). Nico on his part is always ready to help and support Will, such as when he tirelessly helped him tend to wounded campers (notably Paolo Montes and Valentina Diaz). Nico commented about Will staring at Paolo, but Will stated that it was nothing and that he was merely admiring how well Paolo's arms were functioning after surgery.\n\nWhen the Colossus Neronis automaton attacked the camp, Nico and Will were in the canoe lake, so they promptly rushed over to the beach to help defend the camp. Nico shadow traveled with Will to a chariot flown by Sherman, Alice, and Julia. Nico passed out from the effort, Will then takes the son of Hades to the infirmary. After the battle, he tends to the worst case of hay fever.\n\nIn The Tower of Nero, the two continue their romantic relationship, sitting together near the end while talking to Apollo and discussing a potential date in Paris. Will jokingly asks if he should be jealous when Nico reveals that he wants to go to Tartarus for a guy he knows before Nico explains that its a Titan friend of his. Despite the danger, Will supports Nico's plan and intends to help him with it.\n\nIn The Sun and the Star: A Nico di Angelo Adventure, Nico and Will reveal the story of their relationship to Gorgyra. It's revealed that Will started having feelings for Nico during his week helping Will out in the infirmary after the Battle of Half-Blood Hill and Nico caught Will looking at him and figured it out which Will didn't even notice.\n\nFamily\n\nFriends\n\nEtymology\n\nWilliam is a masculine given name of Germanic origins which mean protector.\n\nAndrew is a masculine give name derived from the Greek name Andreas, meaning \"man\".\n\nSolace is derived from the old French name \"Sollas\" which is derived from the Latin \"Sōlācium\", meaning comfort or \"consultation in times of stress\".\n\nTrivia\n\nWill's last name, Solace, may refer to the fact that his father Apollo is the god of the sun, as 'Sol' means 'sun' in Latin.\n\nHis last name Solace also means comfort or consolation in a time of distress or sadness.\n\nIt is mentioned when talking to Travis and Connor in The Last Olympian that he doesn't approve of stealing. He instructed the children of Hermes to leave whatever they could as payment.\n\nWill is the first counselor of Apollo's cabin not to die in battle and to appear in a book other than that of his introduction.\n\nOddly, Leo refers to Will as \"the archer dude\" in The Lost Hero, despite the fact that it has been mentioned multiple times that Will is a healer, not an archer. This is probably because Will was carrying a bow when they first met.\n\nIn The Blood of Olympus, Will can make a sharp whistle-like sound that can temporarily stun his opponents, making them clutch their ears in confusion. He later uses this in The Sun and the Star: A Nico di Angelo Adventure to stun a pack of cynocephali and a flock of Stymphalian Birds.\n\nWill is said to not be very good at music or archery like most of his siblings, but more talented at healing.\n\nIt is hinted he is also attracted to Paolo as he was staring at him. When Nico calls him out on this, he states that he was merely admiring how well his arms are functioning after the surgery.\n\nAs shown in The Hidden Oracle, Will is the second confirmed LGBTQ+ demigod in the series. The third demigod in the Riordanverse.\n\nHence, Nico and Will are the first gay couple in the series.\n\nAs revealed in The Sun and the Star: A Nico di Angelo Adventure, Will identifies as bisexual and displays an attraction to Persephone which weirds Nico out as Persephone is his stepmother.\n\nNico states that Will reminds him of Jason Grace, as he has the same blond hair and blue eyes.\n\nHis full first name, William, which could be a reference to his alleged brother William Shakespeare, who is said to be a son of Apollo.\n\nIn The Tower of Nero, Will is revealed to be a massive Star Wars fan which is also seen in The Sun and the Star: A Nico di Angelo Adventure.\n\nIn The Sun and the Star: A Nico di Angelo Adventure, it's revealed that Will wasn't out about his sexuality until Nico asked him out which prompted Will to come out. His siblings Kayla and Austin already knew, as did Connor Stoll, since all three had caught Will's looks at Nico.\n\nAs revealed in The Sun and the Star: A Nico di Angelo Adventure, while Will wasn't officially seen until The Last Olympian, he has been at Camp Half-Blood since at least the time of The Titan's Curse, possibly making him one of the unnamed Apollo campers who appeared in the first four books.\n\nWill is the first child of Apollo to have a point of view.\n\nIn an interview, Rick Riordan described Nico and Will as \"soulmates of equal brightness, no matter how different or far away they seem from one another.\"[6]\n\nReferences\n\nPercy Jackson and the Olympians Core Series: The Lightning Thief | The Sea of Monsters | The Titan's Curse | The Battle of the Labyrinth | The Last Olympian Main Characters: Percy Jackson | Grover Underwood | Annabeth Chase | Tyson | Clarisse La Rue | Thalia Grace | Nico di Angelo | Chiron | Luke Castellan | Rachel Elizabeth Dare Secondary Characters: Sally Jackson | Travis Stoll | Connor Stoll | Mrs. O'Leary | Silena Beauregard | Charles Beckendorf | Paul Blofis | Blackjack | Zoë Nightshade | Bianca di Angelo | Juniper | Ethan Nakamura | Daedalus Minor Characters: Gabe Ugliano | Argus | Tantalus | Hylla Ramírez-Arellano | Frederick Chase | Michael Yew | May Castellan | Austin Lake | Kayla Knowles | Maria di Angelo | Will Solace | Elevator Security Guard | Leneus Olympian Gods: Zeus | Hera | Poseidon | Demeter | Ares | Athena | Apollo | Artemis | Hephaestus | Aphrodite | Hermes | Dionysus | Hades | Hestia Minor Gods: Amphitrite | Ariadne | Ganymede | Hecate | Iris | Janus | Morpheus | Nemesis | Pan | Phobos | Deimos | Persephone | Melinoe | Triton Titans: Kronos | Atlas | Calypso | Iapetus | Krios | Hyperion | Oceanus | Prometheus Mythical Creatures: Minotaur | Centaur | Furies | Satyr | Cyclops | Manticore | Ophiotaurus | Nemean Lion | Empousa Related Content: Rick Riordan | Percy Jackson and the Olympians: The Lightning Thief | Percy Jackson: Sea of Monsters | The Demigod Files | Demigods and Monsters | The Ultimate Guide | The Heroes of Olympus | The Trials of Apollo | Percy Jackson Demigod Collection | The Lightning Thief: Illustrated Edition | The Lightning Thief: The Percy Jackson Musical | Disney+ Series\n\nThe Heroes of Olympus Core Series: The Lost Hero | The Son of Neptune | The Mark of Athena | The House of Hades | The Blood of Olympus Main Characters: Jason Grace | Piper McLean | Leo Valdez | Percy Jackson | Frank Zhang | Hazel Levesque | Annabeth Chase | Iapetus/Bob | Reyna Ramírez-Arellano | Nico di Angelo | Gleeson Hedge Secondary Characters: Hylla Ramírez-Arellano | Dakota | Tyson | Ella | Octavian | Halcyon Green | Dr. Howard Claymore | Alabaster C.
