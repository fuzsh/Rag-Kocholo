They're gonna be on television.\n\nI was naive enough to think that if you did a pilot,\n\nthat meant you're gonna be a TV star by next Tuesday\n\nand I'm still waiting to become a TV star.\n\nAw, that's nice.\n\nHey, it's gettin' cloudy.\n\n(coughing)\n\nOh boy.\n\n(horn honking)\n\nI had done another pilot where I did the voice\n\nof an animated dog called Hollywood Dog for Fox.\n\nThat never saw the light of day but they sort of knew me\n\nfrom that, they had me audition for the voice\n\nof Moe the bartender, very casually,\n\nI just went in and read some lines.\n\nThey went, Yeah, sounds good,\n\nand Matt Groening and Sam Simon had me just follow them\n\non the lot and record that day.\n\nI'm like, Record now?\n\nThey're like, Yeah.\n\nEach week I'd come back and then eventually,\n\nin season two, they made me a regular.\n\nI didn't even know what the show was,\n\nlet alone it would become The Simpsons.\n\n(phone ringing)\n\nMoe's rat free tavern.\n\nOh, heya Marge, yeah yeah, Homer's here.\n\nOh you want Homer?\n\nI'm sorry, I thought you meant Himler.\n\nProbably nearest to my heart is Moe the bartender\n\n'cause it's probably the most popular character I do\n\nand he's from New York, he's from Queens\n\nand I used to bartend and he's been\n\nthe most fleshed out, I think.\n\nI really like doin' Professor Frink 'cause he's\n\nan impression of Jerry Lewis who I grew up,\n\nwhen I was a kid, he made me laugh so much\n\nand I just, when I start talking this way,\n\nI find it difficult to stop,\n\nit's sort of like having a peanut, you can't just have one,\n\nyou must continue (laughs).\n\nThe burglar trips the alarm, the house raises\n\nfrom its foundations and runs down the street\n\naround the corner to safety.\n\nLike, when I was seven, that made me laugh,\n\nit still makes me laugh.\n\nToday's particle accelerators are nowhere near\n\npowerful enough to simulate these conditions.\n\nOkay, all right, I have a question then.\n\nYeah.\n\nUm, were you planning on kissing me ever?\n\n(audience laughing)\n\nThere are certain scripts that come along\n\nthat you know this is gonna be a great show.\n\nI auditioned to play Joey and they said, No,\n\nand I went back, I was like, You gotta see me again,\n\nI had never done that before essentially,\n\nkindly saw me again and just as quickly threw me out\n\nand then they had me in in the first season,\n\nI ended up playing that character\n\nof Phoebe's boyfriend, David.\n\nI would come back almost every year.\n\nIt was fun to sort of watch them all\n\nturn into the Beatles basically\n\nand I burned with jealousy and told them so.\n\nI was like, I'm really happy for you guys,\n\nalso, I hope you all die.\n\n(upbeat music)\n\nNow what do you wanna do that for, Professor?\n\nCharlie, you're doin' the right thing, really.\n\nYou know, back then, there was a real delineation\n\nbetween TV actor and movie actor, you didn't cross over\n\nand I remember nudging my agents, like,\n\nI can do movies, I feel like I can,\n\nget me movie auditions,\n\nand I think they kinda threw me a bone\n\nand got me this Quiz Show audition\n\nand I remember finally going in and reading\n\nfor Robert Redford who was the director of it.\n\nI had decided in that audition to sorta go in\n\nin character, sorta stay in character,\n\nI was kind of a guy who's from New York\n\nwho's a little bit rough around the edges.\n\nYou're too nice. No I'm not.\n\nIf it were up to me, I woulda sent him\n\nto the skating rink the fast way.\n\nI did that and what the casting director\n\nended up telling me was that she had left\n\nthe camera running as she was just chatting with me\n\nand she said, You know your audition was okay,\n\nit was actually just bantering back and forth\n\nwith me that Bob responded to, he thought you kind of\n\nwere the role and that's why he hired you,\n\nand so it really actually paid off in that moment.\n\nSee the problem, Professor is, the old college try\n\nain't gonna do it and you've seen Stempel,\n\nthe guy's unbeatable.\n\nWhen I think of asses, a woman's ass,\n\nsomething comes out of me.\n\nI had just done Quiz Show, people were taking\n\na bit of notice of me, Michael Mann had me in,\n\nI auditioned, got that role and on my 30th birthday,\n\nI shot 24 hours straight, I shot all night on Heat\n\nand then I went right to the Bird Cage set\n\nand that night we shot that scene where he goes to me,\n\n'Cause she gotta great ass. 'Cause she gotta great ass.\n\nThat crazy scene where he yells,\n\nGreat ass, into my face.\n\nMichael Mann shoots, like, a million takes.\n\nEverybody gets really tired and cross-eyed.\n\nI think Pacino got bored so he went, Great ass,\n\nI think out of frustration, which scared the hell out of me\n\nand if you look at that movie again, you'll see I just go,\n\nJesus, like that when he yells that, not acting at all,\n\nhe just actually terrified me.\n\n(upbeat music)\n\nCall me.\n\nOops.\n\nPerfect.\n\nOy.\n\nEh, sheesh.\n\nIt's the shoes.\n\nYeah, so Mike Nichols, director of Bird Cage,\n\nhad seen me in Quiz Show, wanted me to give me\n\na small role in Bird Cage, said pick any small role.\n\nI ended up doing a reading, a table reading of the script\n\nand one of the characters I did was Agador Spartacus,\n\nwho's a, was Nathan's dresser who talked this way,\n\nkind of a delightful Guatemalan drag queen.\n\nIt was only a one scene part at the time\n\nand Mike said, So which role do you want?\n\nI said, I wanna do that one, he's like, Really?\n\nI'm like, Yeah, that's the one that's funny.\n\nGood evening, hi, I'm Spartacus.\n\nAnastasia, sir, just wishing\n\nI could do the job for you, sir.\n\nThat was an imitation of a cousin of mine\n\nwho kind of talked like this.\n\nThis was the voice of the bat which was a little higher.\n\nMy godson actually talked more like this, a little deeper.\n\nThey thought I was crazy, by the way, when I did that voice.\n\nI really liked that voice and was doing it\n\nand they were, like, looking at me\n\nlike I was completely insane.\n\nThey were like, Okay, what are you doing?\n\nI'm like, I dunno, I thought it'd be a funny voice.\n\nThey're like, Yeah, I don't know,\n\nand then it ended up growing on them.\n\nI'd give her a ha and a hi-ya and then a woo-ah\n\nand I'd kick her, sir.\n\nJust some choices, rancho light and I'd appreciate it\n\nif you'd hold them back a bit so I was seeing\n\nas it's your first night and all, I suppose I'll forkgive\n\nyou if you forkget (laughs).\n\nWho's next?\n\nMystery Men, here's what's interesting to me\n\nfrom a business perspective.\n\nSo I had done these movies and sort of hit\n\na certain amount of heat, right, I was about\n\nin my early 30s, I got some momentum\n\nand what will happen is, if you're fortunate enough\n\nto have that happen to you as a young actor,\n\nis you'll get to star in some movies, one or two or three\n\nand Mystery Men was one of them.\n\nI did Mystery Men, I did Mystery Alaska and I did Godzilla.\n\nAll those movies tanked, none of them did well\n\nat the Box Office and thus, I lost my privilege\n\nof starring in movies after that.\n\nOh, but Mystery Men, that is probably\n\nthe best of those three.\n\nOver time, what really is remembered from it\n\nis clips from the movie are in that Smashmouth song,\n\nwhich seems to be what stands the test\n\nof time out of that movie.\n\nAmerica's Sweetheart, 2001, I remember\n\non that movie Joe Roth directed it,\n\nwho owned the studio, is the head of the studio.\n\nAs a result, there was lots of money\n\nand time on that project.\n\nIt would be, like, 5:00, we would have started at,\n\nlike, 10 that morning, it'd be 5:00 and we'd go,\n\nOkay, that's it, we're done for the day.\n\nI'm like, We're done? We haven't put in a 12 hour day.\n\nAnd it was like, Oh, ya know, Joe's got,\n\nhis daughter's got a soccer game so we're just\n\ngonna knock it off early today.\n\nI'm like, Awesome.\n\nIt's wonderful to have the boss, ya know, be your director.\n\nIt was fun, like, there was like a party every week,\n\nlike a sort of wrap party every weekend.\n\nWe shot in Vegas.\n\nThat's what I always imagined movie making would be like\n\nbut it, like, never is but that movie was.\n\nIt was, like, glamorous.\n\nThat's your sign of intelligence.\n\nBut I don't want anything from him.\n\nWell you can't escape biology, buddy, he's our father.\n\nAlthough I executive produced it, that was brought to me.\n\nA guy named Bob Larry.\n\nBob and I, as brilliant as he was, we did not see eye\n\nto eye creatively, we differed a lot on how certain things\n\nshould be and so between the difficulty\n\nof that subject matter meaning it was very emotional\n\nand dark and how much Bob and I didn't agree creatively,\n\nit was hard.\n\nCome on, that's impossible.\n\nLook for yourself.\n\nI see no transformation.\n\nYour fortune has no power.\n\nI played Gargamel in the first two Smurfs movies,\n\nwho's the villain, the evil villain Gargamel.\n\nI am the great and powerful Gargamel.\n\nLunatic.\n\nWould a lunatic do this?\n\nA-la-ka-zucar.\n\nThere's an element of my mother in there.\n\nMy mother's not this deep and gravelly\n\nbut she often has this expression on her face.\n\nShe's more like this, What are you doing?\n\nWhat's happening here?\n\nIt's a lot of how I remember my mother\n\nand, you know, Gargamel runs around chasing\n\nlittle things around, very displeased with them,\n\nso I connected to that.\n\nHow sad for you in 30 years.\n\nHere's how it's gonna work,\n\nyou don't open your mouth about Sully,\n\nyou weren't on the docks that night\n\nand you didn't kill him, Frank did.\n\nRay Donovan, I play a pretty twisted FBI agent\n\nwho has gone wrong.\n\nYa know, with Ray Donovan, I really enjoyed working\n\non that just 'cause I won an Emmy, although,\n\nactually, just 'cause I won an Emmy, let's just be honest.\n\nTo play a character more as myself, I felt like\n\nI had sort of matured into being able to do that\n\nwith more comfort 'cause I was the kind of guy\n\nwho besides being very uptight, I didn't feel\n\nlike I was doing anything unless I put a voice on.\n\nYeah, wait outside, hun.\n\nDelivers a slider into the dirt, count evens one on one.\n\nI miss having the best seat in the house\n\nand making every single moment come alive.\n\nI hooked up with Joel Church Cooper,\n\nwho's this awesome writer, we did a short\n\nat Funny or Die, that got popular and Joel\n\nand I started working together on the character,\n\nhe's a billion times better writer than I am.\n\nI love that though 'cause it's A, the only thing\n\nI've ever developed for myself that was any good,\n\nB, it's sort of a combination,\n\nit feels like my vocal career.\n\nBrockmire is sort of the culmination for me\n\nof a lot of lessons, like trust a writer,\n\nlike, I woulda trusted the Huff writer much, much more\n\nif I could go back and do that over again.\n\nEnjoy your work, if you are, you give the movie or show\n\na better chance of being better if you're not so fraught.\n\nIf I could go back in time, I wouldn't even change\n\nsuccesses or failures, I would just change my attitude\n\ntowards them and how much I enjoyed them or not\n\nand that's its own reward and that's all\n\nyou can really control."
