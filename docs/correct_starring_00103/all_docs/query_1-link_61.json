        "text": "What Women Want star Helen Hunt wants a divorce.\n\nHunt filed a Superior Court divorce petition Monday in Los Angeles citing irreconcilable differences as the reason to end her 17-month-old marriage to actor-husband Hank Azaria. They've been separated about six months.\n\nAzaria's movie credits include Godzilla and The Birdcage. He is also the voice of several characters on The Simpsons.\n\nHunt, the former Mad About You star, won 1998's best actress Oscar for As Good As It Gets and appears with Tom Hanks in the upcoming film Cast Away.\n\n\"Sopranos' finds favor\n\nelsewhere in New Jersey\n\nThe Sopranos could have a new home in New Jersey.\n\nEssex County officials barred the award-winning HBO series from filming a three-day gunfight on county-owned property because they disagreed with the show's portrayal of Italian-Americans.\n\nBut officials from Union, Middlesex and Passaic counties said they would welcome the wiseguys, including James Gandolfini who plays mob family patriarch Tony Soprano.\n\n\"I'm sure we'd be interested in having them if they want to talk to us,\" said Dan Sullivan, a Union County official. The show filmed in Union County in 1999, \"and there was never any problem.\"\n\nBritney, LL Cool J\n\nto host music awards\n\nA collaboration between Britney Spears and LL Cool J is in the works.\n\nSpears, who was tapped last month to be the host of the American Music Awards, will share those duties with the Grammy-winning hip-hop performer, it was announced Monday in Los Angeles.\n\nThe three-hour show will be televised Jan. 8 from Los Angeles on ABC.\n\nCountry singer Faith Hill has a leading four nominations, while Marc Anthony and rock band Creed have three each.\n\n_ Compiled from Times wires."
