        "text": "While I agree that Godzilla 1998 gets far more hate than deserves, I don't think it's 8/10 worthy. Matthew Broderick and Jean Reno's Performances were pretty crummy, the Baby Zillas were way too much like the Velociraptors from Jurassic Park (minus any signs of them being at all clever), Zilla's design is a major far cry from that of its namesake, 2 characters become major characters for exactly 1 scene (and are never seen for the rest of the film), most of the cast of The Simpsons shows up for no reason (seriously, Hank Azaria, Nancy Cartwright, AND Harry Shearer are in this film at one point or another), There's a pointless love story between Niko and Audrey... his awful girlfriend, and Hank Azaria's worst performance to date\n\nGodzilla X Megaguirus: G Extermination Command\n\nThis movie needs more attention because I don't think it's that popular among the fans. There are a lot of things I find it unique here and weren't really used that much outside.\n\nFor one thing, I think the idea of the military ditching the usual tanks and jets solution and build a weapon they use from space is different from sending a giant robot or a super jet to fight the monsters and I liked that way of thinking.\n\nSecond, that scene of the sunken city? We never saw anything like it. Too bad Godzilla didn't fight in that setting because that would the fights stand out more.\n\nThird, The fights here are unique for the Millennium series or any more \"realistic\" Godzilla fight as both monsters use different strategies and make use of their surroundings to outwit each other like Godzilla using his dorsal fins as a slicing weapon and wasn't just brute force or beam spams. We never saw anything like it, did we? Or use his tail to grab his opponent? While some moments were silly like Megaguirus' sneer or the body slam, this fight is still fun to watch and I don't think another Millennium series fight was this enjoyable.\n\nThe effect in this movie are a vast improvement over 2000 despite some obvious green screen moments and the weird editing of the final fight. Godzilla's suit in this movie is my personal second favorite suit of the Millennium series. What kills it to me however is the coloring choice. Sure they tried to fix that with the Kiryu saga but it wasn't the same exact design as this one.\n\nThen comes the humans. They're not that interesting and I found the final twist was a bit forced in the last minute even for one hint or two before.\n\n8.5/10\n\nI've seen enough Matthew Broderick movies to get used to his performance and it didn't bother me here.\n\nDidn't bother me.\n\nWhile I didn't know how the original Godzilla looked like prior to this movie, I still like this design even. Imagine it as a Godzilla clone with emphasis on speed and agility. Or at least that's one way to look at it.\n\nWhy should that be a problem? They are playing different characters than their Simpsons roles and since I don't watch the Simpsons I didn't notice it and didn't grasp my attention\n\nGodzilla vs Megaguirus, to me, is easily one of the best Toho monster fights in the series. Like you said, both of them are pulling out all their tricks, powers and tactics to try and outmatch the other, and Godzilla himself proved to be a very strategic fighter. Normally he's more intent on overwhelming the opponent toe-to-toe or blasting them with his atomic breath, but here he outwits his foe quite a few times, like with his dorsal fins, pretending she wasn't there so to snag her with his tail and of course pinning her into the ground so she couldn't dodge HIS BODY SLAM.\n\nMan, I'd like to see Megaguirus again sometime. She was a pretty hardcore fight for him.\n\nGodzilla, Mothra and King Ghidorah: Giant Monsters All-Out Attack:\n\nOne of the best entries ever for a fan of the pure evil and dark Godzilla as opposed the the anti-hero Godzilla. Godzilla here is not only one of the best designed ones but also the most brutal of them all as he destroys everything he sees, spares no one and enjoys torturing his opponents to the point you could imagine him unleashing an evil laugh after each kill. Poor Baragon suffered the most humiliating battle ever and Godzilla just kept kicking him around like a big bully.\n\nWhile I liked Chiharu Niiyama as Yuri and one of my favorite female characters, I think the best single handedly goes to Ryudo Uzaki as Taizo as I think he's the most interesting character in the whole movie. Well, next to the old man that I still don't know what he is supposed to be.\n\nAgain, the green screen shots are even more better looking to the point that models and real life locations are starting to blend well together, but the CGI still needs improvement as shown with King Ghidorah.\n\n9/10\n\nThen save it for your review so we can all hear it loud and clear in two to three months of now.\n\nlol\n\nI'm pretty much am. There is a lot I find wrong with Megaguirus. The music to me is really its saving grace.\n\nGodzilla X Mechagodzilla\n\nI'd say this is the third best movie of the Millennium series. I really liked the human story here and felt for them. Kiryu is by far the best Mechagodzilla design-wise, but not as spectacular as SUPER Mechagodzilla as it failed to kill Godzilla and the best thing it did was blowing off his chest, which is the most annoying thing in this movie. How the hell Godzilla survived a point-blank fully powered Absolute-Zero blast when it's supposed to devastate anything it touches in an instant?! I call it hacks and cheap ending.\n\nI should like the Godzilla suit in this movie since it's the same Millennium suit that I liked but with the right colors, but the head feels off and I think it's the position that annoys me. I was used to Godzilla's head aligned with his neck but seeing his neck under his head here is sort of an eyesore and can't ignore it. The first fight with Kiryu was terrible. Kiryu kept shooting missiles at him and he doesn't flinch and stays totally still like a statue. The first part of the second fight did annoy me as well because the two kept slamming and pushing each other but it was so slow to the point you see the explosions that happened really silly and makes so exaggerated. Thankfully the rest of the fight sped up the pacing and Godzilla was more lively than that statue mode in the first fight.\n\nAnd by the way, Kiryu's rampage was awfully familiar to me... A giant cyborg that was built with remains of a dead thing and then goes on a rampage until it runs out of energy? Feels very Neon Genesis Evangelion to me.\n\nAlso thought of the scene when Akane was screaming Kiryu's name to give her more power. That was corny for a serious-toned movie like this.\n\n7.5/100\n\n------\n\nGodzilla X Mothra X Mechagodzilla: Tokyo S.O.S.\n\nBy the time you finish watching this movie, you'll ask yourself: \"Why didn't the end it with just one movie\"? Because that's how I felt it. The story is pretty much the same though Mothra is added to the mix. And by adding her I started to question myself: \"Why didn't Mothra and the Shobojins took THAT long to warn the humanity on the risk of stealing Godzilla's bones? Shouldn't they have done that from the beginning?!\" And I though Mothra taking her very sweet time in Ebirah's movie was annoying...\n\nAnother thing I don't like is the change of cast. Why send off Akane when Godzilla is not yet dead? What happened to Sara and Tokumitsu? The people we were invested on in the previous movie just are just gone like that as if they were no longer important?! Not that I don't mind the return of Shinichi Chujo and it's nice to have continuity here.\n\nSo let's move on... Mothra in this movie is the best Mothra ever. She looks like an updated Showa Mothra but the mechanics are so well done here she looks alive as opposed to the carpet puppet of the Heisei series. The Larvae are also well made here and not as bland as the previous one nor a larvae on wheels and the silk ray was gorgeous. The Shobojin's design is my second least favorite. I don't like the fan-servicey look they were given, but at least they have better style from the ones in Final Wars.\n\nKiryu was downplayed since he lost the Absolute Zero cannon, but I'm not entirely swallowing the \"Kiryu doesn't want to fight\" concept. And Godzilla was also weakened a lot here with some maser shots were enough for him to fall down, but I guess his injury took a toll on him.\n\nAs said earlier, this wasn't necessary to make and could've been done with just one.\n\n7/10\n\nYou guys have given me too much to read and watch. LOL\n\nMy sister was over this weekend and she had never seen Legendary Godzilla.\n\nWhen we were younger she would give me HELL when I would watch Godzilla on TV, but she was pretty impressed by the new film.\n\nMy thoughts on some of what you discussed.\n\nGodzilla 98:\n\nI agree that it's not a bad giant monster movie, but it's not a good Godzilla movie at all.\n\nEven saying that, I don't think I'd rate it that high of a movie either.\n\nWhether you think they're trying to outdo the raptors in Jurassic Park or not, the shift in focus to all the baby Godzillas really ruins the pace of the movie.\n\nI don't think Hank Azaria's performance as Animal was bad in any way.\n\nWhat am I saying? Stuff.\n\nMegaguirus\n\nI like the movie; even the wacky colors on Godzilla.\n\nIt's such an odd film. Wacky, goofy, but kind of cool too.\n\nThe flooding of the city comes out of nowhere and leaves just as quickly.\n\nAnd while I agree that the Dimensional Tide is unique among Godzilla weapons, it absolutely kills me that they test the weapon next to a populated area.\n\nThey test a device that creates a black hole within walking distance from a village?\n\nEven with the Godzilla-film logic that is crazy!\n\nTokyo SOS\n\nTotally agree. Not only are some points brought up that should have been in the first movie, it's totally odd that the human cast of the first movie is forgotten. The fights are way cool though."
