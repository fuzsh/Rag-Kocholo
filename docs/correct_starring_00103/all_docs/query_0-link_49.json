        "text": "The One with All the Cheesecakes\n\nChandler and Rachel can't help eating the irresistible cheesecakes intended for a neighbor. Phoebe's former boyfriend returns for one night only, but Joey could ruin the romance. Monica plots revenge on her cousin's wedding day.\n\nThe One with the Male Nanny\n\nRoss mocks Rachel's new male nanny. Chandler becomes upset when Monica says that somebody from her job is the funniest guy she's ever met. Phoebe and Mike exchange apartment keys, only to get a surprise visit from Phoebe's ex-boyfriend David.\n\nThe One with the Monkey\n\nThe gang makes and breaks a pact to celebrate New Year's Eve without dates. Ross compensates for his loneliness by getting a roommate - a monkey named Marcel whom everyone adores. Well, everyone except Monica, who can't get past the faeces-throwing thing. And Phoebe faces a difficult decision when she meets a shy physicist who's thinking about giving up a fellowship in Minsk to stay with her.\n\nThe One In Barbados\n\nChandler gives David advice that culminates in David deciding to propose to Phoebe. However, Phoebe is still in love with Mike. Monica meddles and calls Mike, who shows up in Barbados and interrupts David's marriage proposal with one of his own. Phoebe chooses Mike, although she doesn't accept his proposal. Meanwhile, sparks fly between Ross and Charlie when they spend some time together rewriting his speech, and Rachel struggles with the idea of telling Joey that she's crazy about him.\n\nThe One with the Donor\n\nDisappointed to learn that they cannot conceive a baby naturally, Monica and Chandler mull their options. When Chandler brings home a handsome, unknowing co-worker, Zack (John Stamos - \"Full House,\" \"Thieves\"), for dinner, Monica and Chandler embarrassingly \"interview\" him as a potential sperm donor. Meanwhile, while shopping with Phoebe, Rachel confides that she is enamored with Joey. Unfortunately, Joey's current girlfriend, Charlie (recurring guest star Aisha Tyler), overhears. And Phoebe encounters a boyfriend, David (recurring guest star Hank Azaria), from long ago."
