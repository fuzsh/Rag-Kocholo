        "text": "If you've never heard of Screen Junkies, you're about to have a new weekly must-watch.\n\nThe YouTube channel puts out a series of Honest Trailers for popular movies, both old and new.\n\nThey've looked at everything from \"Star Wars\" to \"Batman & Robin,\" and even \"Frozen.\" They're all pretty spot-on, picking out obvious plot holes and coincidences you may not notice in big Hollywood blockbusters.\n\nThis week, ahead of the new \"Godzilla\" film, Screen Junkies released an Honest Trailer for Sony's heavily panned 1998 adaptation of the monster. It's a must-see if you're heading out to see the new version this weekend.\n\n1998's \"Godzilla\" went on to make $379 million worldwide, so it wasn't a total box-office bust; however, Sony's picture was trashed by both critics and audiences. (The movie sits at 25% on Rotten Tomatoes.)\n\nThe film is such a taboo topic that at the New York City press junket for the new film, actor Ken Watanabe told us they don't speak about the 1998 movie.\n\nWatch the honest trailer:\n\nHere's a brief breakdown of what made the film did wrong:\n\nThis overly-done French foreign intelligence agency.It pretty much killed the career of Maria Pitillo who won a Razzie for Worst Supporting Actress.\n\nThe U.S. military destroys more of NYC than Godzilla.\n\nIt felt like a \"Jurassic Park\" ripoff.\n\nSee Also:\n\nHere's How The Military Would Actually Fight Godzilla\n\nBryan Cranston Fans Will Be Disappointed With 'Godzilla'\n\n'Godzilla' Is Bogged Down By A Bunch Of Boring Characters\n\n25 Photos That Show What It Would Be Like If 'Godzilla' Tore Through The US Today\n\nThis Deleted 'Amazing Spider-Man 2' End-Credits Scene Gives A Huge Hint At The Next Sequel\n\nSEE ALSO: Here's how the military would actually fight Godzilla"
