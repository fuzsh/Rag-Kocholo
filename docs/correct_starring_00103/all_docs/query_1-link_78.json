        "text": "Spamalot has announced a date for the return of original cast member Hank Azaria. The actor, who has been filming the Showtime series Huff while on a leave of absence from Spamalot, will rejoin the musical on December 2.\n\nAzaria received a Tony nomination for his performance in Spamalot. He left the tuner in June to film the second season of Huff, a series in which he stars and produces. Alan Tudyk has been appearing in Spamalot in place of Azaria.\n\nAzaria is best known for his work in Hollywood. He has provided numerous voices for The Simpsons for which he won an Emmy and had featured roles on the television series Herman's Head, If Not for You and Mad About You. In 2002, Azaria headlined his own comedy series on NBC, the short-lived Imagine That. He won an Emmy Award for his performance in the television movie Tuesdays with Morrie. His film credits include Heat, The Birdcage, Grosse Pointe Blank, Great Expectations, Godzilla, Celebrity, Cradle Will Rock, Mystery Men, Mystery, Alaska, American's Sweethearts, Along Came Polly and Dodgeball. He also starred in the hit West End production of David Mamet's Sexual Perversity in Chicago in 2003.\n\nAzaria will now appear in Spamalot through April. David Hyde Pierce has extended his run in the musical and will also appear until that time."
