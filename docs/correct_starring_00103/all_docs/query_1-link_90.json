He also had recurring roles on the television series Mad About You and Friends, and starred in the drama Huff (2004-2006), playing the titular character, as well as appearing in the popular stage musical Spamalot. Originally primarily a comic actor, in recent years Azaria has taken on more dramatic roles including the TV films Tuesdays With Morrie (1999) and Uprising (2001).
