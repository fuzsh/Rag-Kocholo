        "text": "This Is The Best Godzilla Ever!\n\nHollywood has come to Godzilla, and it's worth the wait! No more campy, rubbery looking godzillas. This Godzilla is slick, reptillian, fast and original. Yes I said it, original!\n\nHave you ever heard of Godzilla hiding- in Manhattan?! Or laying eggs? Or being asexual?! Or actually dodging missiles?! No, this is the most original monster movie I've seen in a long time. After all, there is just so much you can do when the star of the film is a 100 foot lizard, so I wasn't expecting originality, yet that's what I found- in part.\n\nYes the plot is obvious; Big Monster arrives at Big City to demolish it, except that our hero, conveniently introduced within the first 5 minutes, will perservere and destroy it, yada yada yada. So if you're going to see this movie expecting a different plot, all I can ask is, \"What planet are you from?\" After all, nobody feels endangered if Godzilla quietly moves to the Himalayan Mountains!\n\nSo how about that big monster? Well, it's certainly big, and the special effects kept me interested. Definately the coolest scenes are when the attack helicopters are chasing Godzilla through Manhattan, swirving in and out of buildings as they attempt to shoot our foe. Although I have to say; if you ever happen to be in a helicopter, running from a monster, up is the direction to go!\n\nThe cast:\n\nGodzilla- what can I say? It swims, jumps, runs and burrows!\n\nMatthew Broderick- He's a nerds best leading man. He acts smart, smug, uncomfortable in groups, and he wears glasses! He plays the part well, except that he seems to have no fear. I'm not quite sure where a nerd would get that.\n\nJean Rene- if her role is to look good and act naive, then she does a good job. Otherwise, she sucks. This character seems to be confused. She's supposed to be some goody-two-shoes, except when it comes to Broderick's character, who she ditches without a word, steals from, and gets him fired. Now there's a romantic interest for you! I spent most of the movie hoping Godzilla would eat her!\n\nHank Azaria- He plays Brooklyn well. I liked his character's nonchalant brushes with danger. When the prospect of going underground to look for Godzilla's nest is presented to him, his response is, \"Sounds like fun.\"\n\nHarry Shearer- Here, Sean's hero from The Simpsons plays a slimy reporter, and he plays slime well! When the underling says that she wants a promotion, he replies with, \"You're attractive, let's have dinner. At your place.\" At this point, I turned to Sean and Scot and said, \"I want his job.\"\n\nYes I found Godzilla to be entertaining. Of course, you shouldn't go to this movie expecting political inuendo, snappy dialog, or vast character devopment. But if you want to see a fun, good special-effects monster movie, this is your best bet!"
