        "text": "Godzilla first appeared in film almost seven decades ago and since then has been in approximately forty feature films with more on the way. Named the longest continuously-running film franchise by the Guinness Book of World Records, the large lizard-like monster has been terrorizing cities all over the world since 1954. In 1998, writer/director Roland Emmerich (Independence Day) brought his own version to the big screen and, while originally planned as a trilogy, it ended up being a one-off film after disappointing reviews from fans and critics. As the movie celebrates its twenty-fifth anniversary, Sony Pictures Home Entertainment is releasing a limited edition, 4K Steelbook this week.\n\nFollowing French atomic bomb tests in the South Pacific, an unknown creature is spotted passing through the Panama Canal. Scientist Niko Tatopoulos (Matthew Broderick; Ferris Bueller's Day Off) is called in to investigate the matter, and he quickly arrives at the conclusion that a giant, irradiated lizard has been created by the explosions. Godzilla then makes its way north, landing in Manhattan to begin wreaking havoc in the big city. Niko, along with his college sweetheart, Audrey (Maria Pitillo; True Romance), cameraman Victor (Hank Azaria; The Simpson), and French Secret Service agent, Philip (Jean Reno; Léon: The Professional) must determine exactly what is going on and how to stop the monster before it is too late.\n\nOne of the complaints about Emmerich's version of Godzilla was that it wasn't very serious, instead taking on a somewhat more tongue-in-cheek slant to the subject matter. Of course, that would explain Broderick's casting in the lead role as he is well known for his comedic acting talent. He does a very good job with the material he is given while remaining true to his strengths. Reno offers a good performance while showing a little of his comedic side and Azaria rounds out the male trio, again using the comedic timing he is known for. Pitillo's performance, along with a number of the other supporting cast, leaves a lot to be desired.\n\nEven though Godzilla was released in 4K four years ago, this latest update is the best version, technically, so far. With Dolby Vision video quality the picture is clean and detailed, even during the darker scenes taking place at night. The color palette offers a variety of hues and shading giving the film additional depth. Unfortunately, the downside of the upgrade is that the effects stand out - not in a good way - and many of the green-screened scenes are much more obvious than in past versions.\n\nThe Dolby Atmos audio, however, is excellent, making use of the full-range surround sound speakers. For example, helicopters flying overhead sound as if they are moving across the room from right to left and back to front. Godzilla's roar is even more impressive in Atmos rather than DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 and the eclectic soundtrack/score is well represented on this release. The extras are all previously released and include Theatrical Trailers, Visual Effects Commentary, Behind the Scenes of Godzilla® with Charles Caiman, All-Time Best of Godzilla® Fight Scenes, and \"Heroes\" Music Video by The Wallflowers.\n\nThe special effects and less serious overall tone made this Godzilla less beloved than previous and since-released versions but if taken with a grain of salt, and recognizing that this one was meant to be a little lighter fare, it can be entertaining, if you open your self up to it. I do understand the complaints regarding the \"look\" of the giant creature, but if the viewer can get past that, there are definitely some laughs to be had. The Steel Book is beautifully done and, as this version is the cleanest visually and aurally to date, it is worth purchasing.\n\nGrade: C+"
