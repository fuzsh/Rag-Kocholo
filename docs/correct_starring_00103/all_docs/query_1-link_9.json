        "text": "Despite his initial intentions of becoming a stage performer, actor Hank Azaria turned his childhood talent for mimicry into a highly successful career, voicing many characters on the long-running animated comedy, \"The Simpsons\" (Fox, 1989- ). Thanks to his varied oddball interpretations of Moe the Bartender, Apu the Kwik-E-Mart owner, and Police Chief Wiggum, Azaria was able to transfer his success with animation into the live-action world. Following his breakthrough performance as a smarmy 1950s television producer in \"Quiz Show\" (1994), he stole the show from the likes of Robin Williams and Nathan Lane as a flamboyant houseboy in \"The Birdcage\" (1996). Though he tried - and failed - to enter into blockbuster territory with \"Godzilla\" (1998), Azaria fared well with moving and award-nominated performances in \"Tuesdays with Morrie\" (ABC, 1999) and \"Uprising\" (NBC, 2001). Though he finally fulfilled his lifetime ambition with a triumphant performance as an effeminate Sir Lancelot in the Broadway smash \"Spamalot\" (2004-05), Azaria never strayed far from his steady and lucrative tenure on \"The Simpsons,\" which solidified his standing as one of the most talented voice-over artists working in the business. He also worked steadily in both film and television, with big screen credits ranging from the porn-industry biopic \"Lovelace\" (2013) to a starring role as the evil Gargamel in \"The Smurfs\" (2011) and its sequels, and a starring role in the dark comedy \"Brockmire\" (IFC 2017- ) as a disgraced baseball announcer attempting to rebuild his life and career."
