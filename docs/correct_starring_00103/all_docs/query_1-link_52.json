On the show he plays James Cochran, who is the head of the FBI’s Los Angeles division.\n\nOn the big screen, he recently starred in Lovelace opposite Amanda Seyfried and Peter Sarsgaard. The film premiered at the 2013 Sundance film festival and Azaria plays Jerry Damiano, the director of “Deep Throat,\" which was the erotic 1972 film that made Linda Lovelace famous.\n\nHe also reprised his role as Gargamel for The Smurfs 2, which grossed over $322 million worldwide, making the combined box office total for both Smurfs films at over $850 million worldwide.

Azaria brings to life a list of characters too numerous to mention, though he may be best known as the voices of Moe Szyslak, Apu, Police Chief Wiggum and ComicBook Guy. He has been nominated for five Emmy Awards and has won three for Outstanding Voice-Over Performance for his work on The Simpsons, and he brought many of his beloved characters to the big screen in 2007’s The Simpsons Movie.\n\nHis additional voice-over work includes the feature films Hop and Happy Feet 2, which both grossed over $150 million worldwide and he made multiple appearances as Venom/Eddie Brock, from 1994 to 1996, on the animated series Spider-Man.

In 2005, Azaria originated the role of Sir Lancelot in Spamalot, the musical-comedy adaptation of Monty Python and the Holy Grail. The show was a huge success and earned 14 Tony Award nominations, including one for Azaria for Best Actor in a Musical. In 2007, he returned to Broadway and starred as RCA head David Sarnoff in Aaron Sorkin’s The Farnsworth Invention.\n\nAs a filmmaker, Azaria wrote, directed and produced the 2004 short film Nobody’s Perfect, which won the Film Discovery Jury Award for Best Short at the U.S. Comedy Arts Festival and the award for Best Narrative Short at the Ojai Film Festival.\n\nAzaria created the documentary web series, Fatherhood, which follows him as he interviews his friends and colleagues about their experiences as fathers and shows own journey to becoming a father. The series began airing this January on AOL and mom.me.\n\nAzaria also created the Jim Brockmire character which was featured as part of Funny or Die’s Gamechangers series. The Jim Brockmire Story tells the true story of a truly old-school sportscaster who set the standard for how to call a baseball game. He also loved his wife more than anything else until one fateful day when his sports casting career changed forever."
