        "text": "It's no small secret that Godzilla (1998), otherwise known as G.I.N.O. (Godzilla In Name Only), will perhaps FOREVER be recognized as \"that first American remake\"...or even \"that piece of CRAP American remake.\" I can't speak for the fandom at large, but I've had a strange sense of...well, it's as though I'm finally at peace. I've railed against the '98 movie, I've blasted it viciously, I've even defended it and called for my fellow G-fans to \"just let it go.\" But should it be buried? Forgotten? Maybe not so much. At the encouragement of a handful of friends (and my lovely fiance', who personally enjoyed the film as a child), we threw caution to the wind and tossed the thing onscreen. It was something of a thought experiment. With a new major release on the way, what sort of feelings would the film elicit? Would I be enraged? Could I finally distance myself enough to enjoy it for what it is? The verdict is...\"Man this movie is stupid.\" Now, \"stupid\" doesn't necessarily mean \"bad.\" I've always been of the opinion that the worst thing a movie can do is be BORING. And G'98 certainly isn't that, at least not for me. In fact, it's pretty darn fast-paced, and has some genuinely enjoyable bits sprinkled throughout, ranging from earnestly watchable to eye-rolling irony. \"Oh 1998, you so cray-cray.\" I'll shorten this with handy-dandy bullet points!\n\nGood(zilla) - - Despite the increasingly dated CGI, there's some impressive miniature work, models,, explosions, and even suitmation (despite all the raving against such things by the cats in charge). Overall it's damn good LOOKING. - The editing is quick and relatively smart, making sure things don't bog down...well, not TOO much. - The action sequences are well-shot, with an overall feeling of kinetic action, not unlike a roller coaster. - There's a handful of characters that are pretty amusing and genuinely fun. Jean Reno flip-flops between hammy and stiff, but he's always got a memorable line or look. Sergeant O'Neill is a side character whom I wish the entire MOVIE was about. Hank Azaria and the other character actors on board are doing their damndest to salvage the plot from the extremely tepid main characters. - The whole opening sequence, dumbass shots of lizards aside, is pretty good, especially with the music. And the part on the Japanese fishing boat? It's almost like I'm watching a Godzilla movie! - With its wimpering cries, the monster's death is actually pretty heart-wrenching, despite the film being so dryly hateful towards the animal (nobody wants Godzilla preserved or studied, a missed opportunity). Bad(zilla) - - Yes, the CGI is quickly dating itself as time marches on. Even Jurassic Park's elegantly reserved CG is better by comparison. - Matthew Broderick....ehhhhhhhhhhhhhhh....well, I like him in Ferris Bueller! - Maria Pitillo is relatively ok, but so painfully dull-faced for most of the movie...and the otherwise serviceable soundtrack craps out this AWFUL cornball romantic-theme whenever she gets goo-goo-eyed over Broderick. Oh, and people don't sound like that when they cry. - Yeah. We get it. They're FRENCH. - Yeah. We get it. It's NEW YORK. - The entire cab-chase sequence, despite being somewhat exciting on a superficial level, is just so damn stupid that I keep getting thrown out of the movie every time the monster lightly nudges it with his (her) snout. It's supposed to be ANGRY, right? So why doesn't it just annihilate the cab instead of playing with it?! - Science is flogged mercilessly throughout the film. Yeah, it's a monster movie, but there has to be SOME logic to what's happening so the audience isn't so badly pandered to. \"Theropoda allosaurus\" isn't a thing. If the pregnancy test wasn't designed for non-human creatures, how did it register as \"pregnant\"? Etc. etc. etc. - If the monster was SO COLD that the missiles couldn't lock on, then it would be DEAD (basically, that's not how being exothermic works). - There are too many damn characters in this, like many of Emmerich's films, and most of them are shoved aside by the 20 minute mark...so why were they introduced in the first place? - The whole pregnancy and giant eggs thing...how did they even know it was male to start? Is it just called male as a default state? If it's asexual...then doesn't that make it closer to a female genetically in order to reproduce? Geneticists, sound off! - If they hit it with the torpedoes...wouldn't that have exploded it what good? How did it survive the torpedoes but not the tomahawk missiles? - Why does the creature even assume that the puny humans had anything to do with killing the babies? - The creature is supposed to be radioactive...enough to contaminate the old man from the fishing boat. So why is radiation poisoning never a concern for the rest of the film? Okay, so as you can see, it sort of devolves into shouting questions at the screen, clawing at your head with all the plot contrivances. Ultimately, this is something of an exercise for me. Basically, I was able to watch the film, and almost never find myself comparing it back against Godzilla. Almost. The shifting of the blame from America to the French for the nuclear tests feels disingenuous on the part of the filmmakers. Not that the French weren't conducting their own tests, but America tested WAY MORE, and it didn't NEED to be French Polynesia...it feels like that was chosen specifically because, in the late 90's, we weren't quite ready to admit that the US can be just as terrible as everyone else. They don't even call the creature \"Godzilla\" very often. Specifically, it's only named 4 times (as I recall, could be off by one) - 1. By the old Japanese fisherman. 2. By Charles Caiman on the news. 3. By O'Neill towards the end. 4. By the news station at the finale (\"Godzilla Defeated!\") So, yeah, therapeutic and cathartic! I think I'm ready for the new film with as little baggage as possible :D Unless they make a Rifftrax. Then I'm ALL OVER that shit."
