Spanning a career that has seen him bring to life iconic characters like Moe Szyslak, Chief Wiggum, and Apu Nahasapeemapetilon on The Simpsons, Azaria's vocal talents have become an integral part of entertainment history.\n\nEarly Career Beginnings\n\nAzaria's journey into the world of voice acting began with his breakout role in the 1990 film Pretty Woman.

Moe the bartender, Chief Wiggum, and Apu Nahasapeemapetilon have become cultural icons, each with their unique quirks and vocal mannerisms.\n\nInterestingly, these iconic voices stem from a variety of inspirations. Moe, the gruff and surly bartender, is Based on Azaria's impression of Al Pacino. Drawing on the different stages of Pacino's career, from \"Dog Day Afternoon\" to \"Serpico,\" Azaria crafted a voice that perfectly captures Moe's disgruntled personality.
