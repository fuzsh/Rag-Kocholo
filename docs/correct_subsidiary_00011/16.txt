Digital Equipment Corporation was a leading American computer company that sold computer systems and software from the 1960s to the 1990s.

It was on this day, June 11th, in 1998 that Digital Equipment Corporation was purchased by Compaq Computer for $9 billion, making it the largest high-tech acquisition at the time.

Compaq had less of a presence than Digital Equipment Corporation in the market overseas, so the merger helped expand their joint influence. However, Compaq had also acquired several other large companies at the time, and the company fell into financial problems. In May 2002, Compaq merged again with Hewlett-Packer.
