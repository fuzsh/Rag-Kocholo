        "text": "Hewlett-Packard Co.’s deal to buy Compaq Computer Corp. for $25 billion in stock could substantially alter the business landscape.\n\nIf the merger goes through — and the deal remains subject to regulatory approval both in the U.S. and Europe — it would catapult HP to the upper ranks of the business technology sector. Indeed, an HP-Compaq combination would pose a serious challenge to industry heavyweights Dell, IBM, and Sun Microsystems. “At a particularly challenging time for the IT industry, this combination vaults us into a leadership role with customers and partners, said Carly Fiorina, CEO of HP, in a press release. ”Together we will shape the industry for years to come.”\n\nA combined HP-Compaq may shape prices, that’s for sure. The newly combined company will become the world’s largest maker of personal computers, with a 19 percent market share. It would also be the largest maker of network servers, with a 37 percent share — more than double the share held by No. 2 Dell Computer.\n\nWith four serious vendors on the scene, prospective corporate buyers of computer hardware may be able to negotiate better deals when purchasing business systems. But the deal would also give HP-Compaq a stranglehold on the server market, and some observers fear the prices of those machines may go up.\n\nHP and Compaq have been trying to become major players in the computer services business, an area that IBM dominates. The two companies have also experienced setbacks, however. Last year, for example, HP failed in its bid to buy the consulting business of PricewaterhouseCoopers.\n\nAltogether, the combined company would have four main business units: PCs and handheld devices, IT infrastructure (which includes servers and data storage), a printing division, and a consulting operation.\n\nThe companies expect to save $2.5 billion in costs by the middle of fiscal 2004 and add to Hewlett-Packard’s pro forma earnings per share in the first full year after the merger. If there are no hitches on the regulatory front — and that’s a big if — the deal will probably close in the first half of 2002.\n\nIf the deal does go through, the merged company would retain the HP name. It would also retain some pretty hefty sales — revenues for a combined HP-Compaq would be in the neighborhood of $87 billion. This is IBM country, folks.\n\nMoreover, the deal — and several other large acquisitions announced over the weekend — could trigger an all-out feeding frenzy among corporations. With share prices still floundering, some observers believe the proposed HP-Compaq will galvanize potential M&A plans now in the works at other companies.\n\nIn fact, several mega-acquisitions have been announced over the past few days:\n\nSanta Fe International Corp. said it has agreed to acquire Global Marine Inc. for nearly $3 billion in stock, creating the world’s second-largest offshore driller of oil and natural gasoline.\n\nDevon Energy is buying Anderson Exploration for $3.4 billion, making Devon the largest independent producer of oil and gas in North America.\n\nLiberty Media Corp. said it will buy six cable television companies and other assets from German telecom and technology giant Deutsche Telekom AG for around $5 billion. Under the deal, Liberty Media will pay three billion euros in cash, 1.5 billion euros in Series A common stock, and one billion euros in 10-year 7.125 percent senior secured Liberty Media notes. Interestingly, to protect investors Liberty Media will guarantee a floor value of 1.5 billion euros for the common stock component.\n\nManagement at Kraft Foods Inc. said it is looking to acquire companies in the health foods, snacks, and drinks sectors, according to FT.com.\n\nOracle’s Henley Strikes Gold\n\nPoor Jeff Henley. The CFO of Oracle Corp. saw his salary inch up by less than $19,000, to $825,000, in 2000. Henley’s bonus nearly evaporated to less than $105,000 — down from $1.36 million the prior year.\n\nThis is not to say Henley had a bad year financially. It seems the Oracle CFO was very busy in 2000 cashing in his stock options. The result: Henley realized gains of more than $85 million. $85,604,278, to be exact.\n\nAnd no, that’s not a typo.\n\nIncredible as it may seem, Henley’s haul pales in comparison to his boss, chairman Larry Ellison. The Oracle founder realized gains of more than $706 million. Again, no typo.\n\nTwo other executive vice presidents at the software maker exercised their options. The take? More than $22 million.\n\nSo, Whatever Happened to the Recovery?\n\nWhat do President Bush and Dallas Federal Reserve Bank president Robert McTeer have in common?\n\nBoth are surprised that the economy has not yet shown signs of recovering from the slowdown.\n\n”I must say that I have been a little bit surprised and obviously disappointed that we haven’t made a sharp turn yet,” McTeer reportedly told the Dallas Morning News in an interview conducted last week. ”I’ve been thinking it’s [the turnaround’s] right around the corner for a few months now. I’ve been humbled a little by it.” Added McTeer, ”This thing is lasting longer than it was supposed to.”\n\nMeanwhile, President Bush told a Labor Day gathering in Green Bay, Wisconsin, that ”Our economy is not as strong as it should be.” He also conceded that the U.S. economy’s 1 percent growth rate over the past 12 months has been ”paltry.” He added, ”That’s not good enough for America…and I intend to do something about it.”\n\nMcTeer and Bush, of course, still believe that the Fed’s cheap-money policy and the Bush Administration’s tax cuts will finally jump-start the economy. ”The third thing is that energy has stopped going up, and we’ve been getting a little relief on that,” McTeer said in the interview.\n\nUsing Incentives to Sell Convertibles\n\nHere’s the dilemma facing finance executives at cash-strapped companies.\n\nThey want to raise money. But their companies’ stocks are so beaten down, nobody is willing to buy more shares. And, although interest rates are down, the interest expense on bonds would still amount to, well, a big expense.\n\nThe answer: convertibles. This year companies have issued a total of about $70.9 billion in the convertible market, up from a record $61.6 billion for all of 2000, according to ConvertBond.com, a division of Morgan Stanley. Issuers clearly like the low coupons on this paper while investors wait to convert to stock.\n\nBut investors are less inclined to buy this stuff now as the stock market drifts even lower.\n\nWhat to do? A number of companies are offering convertibles with provisions that permit investors to convert the bonds into extra shares if their stock prices fall.\n\nThese are called ”death spiral” bonds — so named because the conversion price can theoretically plunge to zero. Of course, these provisions threaten to dilute existing shareholders’ stakes even more than a typical convertible security. But this is the price companies are willing to pay as they desperately try to survive.\n\nThe interesting development is that not just companies on the brink of insolvency are raising money in this manner. Last Wednesday, for example, TiVo Inc. sold $51.75 million of 7 percent convertible senior notes due 2006 in a private placement. TiVo’s flagship product enables viewers to record TV shows and view them later, with more flexibility than offered by VCRs.\n\nThe conversion price on these notes is $6.73. Under certain circumstances it can fall to as low as $4.21, according to published accounts.\n\nOther companies that issued death spirals earlier in the year, such as ExciteAtHome, weren’t as fortunate as TiVo, which at least is enjoying a floor for its conversion price. ”Our deal is not a toxic convertible,” Rebecca Baer, a TiVo spokeswoman, told Reuters. ”Our objective was to structure the transaction to maximize our access to capital and offer some upside to investors, but to have well-defined limits to equity ownership” Baer said TiVo sold its notes to a group of investors, including some of its strategic partners.\n\nOther Financing News\n\nIP-No: At least three companies on Friday withdrew their planned initial offerings of common stock. They were Pension Worldwide, which provides securities clearing, margin lending and other related services to the brokerage industry; eRoom Technology Inc., a provider of Internet-based software applications and services; and Acadia Pharmaceuticals, a genomics-based drug discovery and development company.\n\nMoody’s Investors Service upgraded the credit ratings of American General Corp.’s senior debt to Aa2 and its principal life insurance subsidiaries to Aa1 following the closing of its acquisition by American International Group Inc. The rating agency left the credit ratings of American General Finance Corp., its wholly owned finance subsidiary, on review for possible upgrade. ”The upgrades are based on the significant tangible strategic and financial benefits for AGC and its principal life insurance subsidiaries resulting from its new parent company, AIG,” according to Moody’s.\n\nBe It Ever So Humble…\n\nWhich hotels enjoy the highest customer satisfaction?\n\nMarriott International Inc. and Hilton Hotels Corp. received a gold star for customer satisfaction, according to the survey by J.D. Power and Associates.\n\nIn fact, among the six major hotel segments ranging from budget to luxury, Marriott-operated chains finished first or second in each of the five categories where the company had a brand, according to the survey.\n\nHilton brands finished first or second in four of the five categories where the company was represented.\n\nMarriott’s Fairfield Inns finished first in the economy/budget category, while its Courtyard brand was rated the best in the midprice full-food-service group. Its Residence Inns finished second among extended-stay hotels, while its Ritz Carlton hotels finished second in the luxury segment.\n\nAt Hilton, the company’s Hampton Inns and its Homewood Suites topped the midprice limited-food-service and extended-stay segments, respectively. Its Hilton Garden Inns were No. 2 among midprice full-food-service hotels.\n\nIn the upscale segment, Embassy Suites, which is also part of Hilton Hotels Corp., was rated No. 1, followed by Marriott hotels and Marriott’s Renaissance hotels.\n\nRounding out the results, Omni hotels finished fourth, followed by Hilton hotels. Westin hotels, part of the Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide Inc. family, tied for sixth place with Hyatt hotels. Four Seasons Hotels Inc. topped the luxury segment.\n\nOn the other hand, brands operated by Choice Hotels International Inc. and Cendant Corp. didn’t fare so well. Choice hotel brands that finished at or below averages in their respective segments included Econo Lodge, Comfort Inn, Clarion hotels, Quality Inns, and Comfort Suites.\n\nCendant brands that finished at or below their segment averages included Days Inn, Knights Inn, Travelodge, and Howard Johnson. Super 8 was Cendant’s only brand to score above the industry average.\n\nSo, what are the most important factors determining customer satisfaction? The guest room, departure process, and pre-arrival and arrival experiences, according to Linda Hirneise, director of the hotel practice at J.D. Power, reports Reuters.\n\nThe survey also revealed that travelers aren’t necessarily a loyal group. While more than half of all guests rate their overall satisfaction as high, only about one-third show strong loyalty to a given hotel chain, Hirneise told the wire service.\n\nLayoff News\n\nLam Research Corp., which makes equipment used to make microchips, on Friday said it will cut 10 percent of its staff and implement companywide shutdown days. Lam said cost cuts also include pay reductions, employee furloughs, and lower operating expenses.\n\nHitachi said it will eliminate 14,700 jobs, or 4.3 percent of its workforce. The company expects to lose more than $1 billion this year due to the worldwide economic downturn.\n\nStamps.com Inc. said it will can 25 percent of its staff as it tries to turn a profit.\n\nFrom the CFO.com Briefcase"
