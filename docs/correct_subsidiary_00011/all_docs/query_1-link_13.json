        "text": "By SAUL HANSELL\n\nn the largest takeover in the history of the computer industry, Compaq Computer Corp., the No. 1 maker of personal computers, agreed Monday to buy Digital Equipment Corp., a declining maker of large corporate machines, for $9.6 billion in cash and stock.\n\nThe takeover marked the ascendancy of personal computers over the behemoths that had dominated computing in the 1970s. But it also signaled that the future of the industry lies not in small computers alone but in integrated networks in which machines that span the full ranges of size, price, scale and power are linked in hybrid digital systems.\n\nParadoxically, that is an approach invented more than a decade ago by IBM. Now, Compaq, which was IBM's first serious competition in the personal computer market, is poised to take on IBM's lucrative systems and services businesses.\n\nWhen Compaq was founded in 1982 to make portable \"clones\" of the personal computer that IBM had recently introduced, Digital reigned as the nation's No. 2 computer maker, producing powerful machines that were favorites of academic researchers and respected by large corporations.\n\nBut the computer industry has been turned on its head in the last 15 years. Today, Compaq is the top maker of personal computers, while Digital's star has been falling for years. The deal announced Monday, coupled with its recent purchase of Tandem, a maker of high-end mainframes, will make Compaq the No. 2 computer maker in the world, behind IBM, producing everything from the smallest laptops to some of the largest mainframes.\n\nIn fact, Compaq's chief executive, Eckhard Pfeiffer, has made no secret of his desire to compete at all levels with IBM. In a sign of the reversed fortunes in the computer industry, however, it is the PC maker that is growing into a full-systems manufacturer.\n\nThat is the opposite path taken in the early 1980s by IBM when the storied mainframe maker decided to dabble in the personal computer market and ended up ceding control of the new industry to the maker of its operating system, Microsoft Corp., and the maker of its central processing unit, Intel Corp.\n\nStarting with small systems rather than big ones, Compaq has built a business that is similar in scope to that of IBM's.\n\nDigital itself was once seen as IBM's main challenger and a cornerstone of the high technology corridor that surrounded Boston on Route 128. But just as Digital had thrived by building minicomputers that were cheaper than IBM's huge mainframes, Compaq and other PC makers built machines so inexpensive and accessible that they have earned a place on nearly every office desk and in many homes as well.\n\nLike almost every company of its generation, Digital continued to offer its own proprietary computer designs and software, and it was late and unsuccessful in its attempts to enter the market for PCs built around standard designs. In recent years, Digital's sales have declined, and losses have been as common as profits.\n\nStill, Digital offered an inviting takeover target. It has technology, a cadre of engineers and salesmen, and a roster of customers that have become attractive to Compaq as it now tries to expand beyond the highly competitive, low-margin personal computer market into the more lucrative business of larger network systems and work stations.\n\nOne of the most hotly contested technology battles of the coming decade will be over who controls the very large computer systems, now typically IBM mainframes, that keep track of bank accounts, airline reservations and the like.\n\nCompaq and others are gambling that computers built on standard PC technology -- with chips from Intel and network operating systems from Microsoft -- will evolve the computing muscle to take on IBM's mainframe-based systems\n\nCredit: The New York Times Source: Company reports\n\nUnder Pfeiffer, Compaq has become one of the most aggressive companies in the computer industry. For example, it has been at the forefront in offering computers that sell for under $1,000, opening up a hot new market for home users.\n\nWhile admitting that Compaq runs the risk of spreading itself too thin with its rapid expansion, some analysts said that by picking yet another fight with IBM it could avoid the complacency that might come with resting on its laurels as the No. 1 PC maker.\n\n\"It is always better in technology to attack from below rather than being the lazy guy on top,\" said Steven Milunovich, an analyst with Merrill Lynch.\n\nThose with the most to lose from Compaq's growth are the other makers of mid-size computers, including Sun Microsystems and Hewlett-Packard, both of which have their eye on big systems.\n\n\"Compaq's deal should make IBM sweat a little,\" said Milunovich, \"but HP should sweat more.\"\n\nCompaq already is the top provider of big personal computers known as servers, which make stored information in small businesses or departments of big companies accessible to networks of users. Last year it paid $2.8 billion for Tandem Computers, a maker of systems used by banks and telecommunications companies.\n\nThat deal worked well, Pfeiffer said in an interview, but only whetted Compaq's appetite for a bigger share of big systems.\n\nIn particular, Compaq lusted after Digital's $6.5 billion business providing computer-related services. Big companies do not simply want powerful, inexpensive machines, like most PC buyers do; they want help installing, programming and sometimes operating the computers as well.\n\nIn recent years, IBM, which built its reputation by holding the hand of its clients, turned such services into its fastest-growing business. Others, including Digital and Hewlett-Packard, followed the same path.\n\nCompaq, however, relied on the independent dealers who sold its machines to provide such services. And that, Pfeiffer said, kept Compaq from being invited to bid on large corporate accounts.\n\n\"Frequently we weren't invited to the party,\" he said. \"Now Compaq can provide service and support capability that is a prerequisite for most of our major customers.\"\n\nDigital too, was not invited to pitch its products to big companies, but for another reason: potential customers worried that it did not have the staying power to survive.\n\nRobert B. Palmer, Digital's chairman, said: \"With this combination, we can put all the questions that have dogged us about our ongoing viability out of our customers minds. Together, we are a much stronger competitor than either of us were as separate companies.\"\n\nCompaq and Digital have flirted on and off since 1995, when the companies had roughly similar market values.\n\nAt the time, Digital had a number of unsettled issues, including the fate of its semiconductor business. Digital last fall settled a suit charging Intel with infringing on its chip-design patents by selling its chip manufacturing business to Intel for $1.5 billion.\n\nDigital further streamlined its own operations by selling its network equipment business to Cabletron Systems for $430 million last year.\n\nCompaq, over the last three years, grew rapidly, more than doubling its sales to $24.6 billion. Its market value more than quintupled to more than $45 billion. So when Compaq came courting Digital again in December, there was no question who would have the upper hand in any marriage.\n\nThe merger was negotiated quickly for a deal of this size. The first face-to-face meeting between company executives was on Jan. 15, and most of the details were hammered out last weekend.\n\nOne reason that negotiations were so smooth is that Digital did not insist on specifying what, if any, jobs would be given to its executives.\n\n\"I will continue on here until the merger is approved by shareholders,\" Palmer said. \"After that, I'm sure Eckhard and I will talk about what I do next.\"\n\nPfeiffer said that he expected to offer jobs to many of Digital's executives and workers.\n\n\"We have been chronically short in management talent,\" he said, but he declined to be specific about any job cuts.\n\nCompaq agreed to exchange 0.945 of its shares (worth $30 when the deal was struck) and $30 in cash for each share of Digital. The $60 per share valuation, was 33 percent higher than the $45.75 closing price for Digital last Friday."
