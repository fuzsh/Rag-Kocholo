        "text": "SAN JOSE, Calif. -- High-tech giant Hewlett-Packard Co. is buying Compaq Computer Corp. for about $25 billion in a blockbuster merger bringing together two rivals struggling to survive in the battered computer industry.\n\nThe stock swap announced Monday night creates a behemoth that has 150,000 employees and $87 billion in revenue -- about the size of IBM Corp. -- with products not only in the personal computer business but also in computer servers, printers and high-tech services.\n\nBoth Palo Alto, Calif.-based HP and Houston-based Compaq have been hurt by technology sector downturns in the past year and each company imposed layoffs to deal with shrinking profits.\n\nAnother 15,000 jobs will be cut as the companies combine, lowering the eventual total work force to 135,000, Compaq chief executive and chairman Michael Capellas said at a meeting with analysts.\n\nCompaq and HP are Nos. 2 and 4 in worldwide PC sales, but their combined total would surpass leader Dell Computer Corp., according to the most recent figures from Gartner Dataquest. Compaq ranks first in worldwide server sales, while HP is fourth.\n\n\"This is a decisive move that accelerates our strategy and positions us to win by offering even greater value to our customers and partners,\" said HP's chairwoman and chief executive, Carly Fiorina, who will keep those posts at the merged company.\n\nThe company will still be called Hewlett-Packard and will keep its headquarters in Palo Alto, though it will have a substantial presence in Houston. Capellas will be president.\n\nThe merger is subject to approval by shareholders and regulators, and European antitrust authorities are also expected to examine the impact of the proposed deal.\n\nOnce the merger closes, which is expected to happen in the first half of 2002, the new HP will be 64 percent owned by HP shareholders and 36 percent owned by Compaq shareholders. Capellas and four other Compaq directors will join HP's board.\n\n\"It's an extremely strong match for both firms, particularly at the executive level with Fiorina and Capellas,\" said analyst Rob Enderle of Giga Information Group. \"She's more of the charismatic visionary, he's more of the operations person. The two of them together should be able to take the combined firm places they couldn't go separately.\"\n\nHP and Compaq said the deal would save them $2 billion a year by 2003, but Gartner Dataquest research fellow Martin Reynolds said that won't be easy. Both companies, he said, have long product lines that customers will not want to see phased out.\n\nThe deal comes as the computer industry suffers through declining sales -- a trend blamed on a saturated market and the slumping worldwide economy. Compaq lost $279 million in the most recent quarter; HP posted a net profit of $111 million in its last quarter, but that marked an 89 percent decline from the previous year.\n\nIn June, Capellas outlined a broad reorganization plan bringing Compaq's services division into the forefront in the company's work.\n\nHewlett-Packard has moved in a similar direction under Fiorina, who has brought about a broad reorganization of the 63-year-old Silicon Valley institution since taking over in 1999. Fiorina, who majored in philosophy and medieval history at Stanford University and once worked as shipping clerk at the company she now heads, has come under intense criticism in recent months for repeatedly lowering her forecasts for Wall Street."
