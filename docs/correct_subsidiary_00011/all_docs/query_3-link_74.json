Along with Ted Forstmann, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Bill Boisture, President and Chief Operating Officer, she was one of the three corporate officers comprising the Office of the Chief Executive. She also was a member of Gulfstream`s Board of Directors (formerly NYSE:GAC) until the Company was acquired by General Dynamics in 1999. She currently is a member of the Board of Directors of Wolverine Tube, Inc., which is headquartered in Huntsville, Alabama.\n\nIn 1996, Davis was selected as one of \"The 50 Most Wanted in Finance\" by Global Finance magazine and in 1997, she was named one of the \"Top 25 Managers of the Year\" by Business Week magazine.
