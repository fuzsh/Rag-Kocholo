        "text": "WALT DISNEY WILL OPEN its first high-tech entertainment center, called DisneyQuest, this summer in Orlando, Fla. As many as 30 more will follow in other cities. The five-story building will be packed with computers that run everything from the rides to the kitchens. Disney is using technology to pack into a medium-size building most of the experiences that in the past took acres of land to create.\n\nNo great surprise that the 100 or so PCs in the buildings-for computer-based attractions, among other things-will be Compaq's. But this is just the visible part of the system. Hidden from visitors' eyes will be large computers providing central control and answering more demanding needs, including hosting the DisneyQuest Web site and providing ticketing and other business operations.\n\nIBM mainframes? No. These boxes will also be from Compaq.\n\nA few years ago the big iron would almost certainly have been provided by the likes of IBM, Hewlett-Packard or Digital Equipment Corp. These were the computer manufacturers with the heft and experience to handle critical data processing. Significantly, each had its own operating system, with the result that software written for one of these big hardware vendors would be useless on a rival's equipment.\n\nBut in recent years Compaq has come roaring into the big-ticket computer market with a line of products based on standard microprocessors from Intel running the standard Windows NT operating system from Microsoft. If you buy from Compaq, you are not locked into Compaq. That means Compaq lacks a captive audience, but it also means that Compaq is easier to sell.\n\nTo use a somewhat pejorative term, Compaq is a cloning company-if you define a clone as a piece of hardware that does not tie you to the vendor of that particular brand of hardware. First Compaq conquered the Wintel clone market on the desktop. Now it wants to ride that victory right off the desktop into the critical data processing operations of large corporations.\n\nOld-line data processing departments are still very much the turf of old-line mainframe companies, primarily IBM. But there is a world of businesses like the new Disney centers to be won. Increasing numbers of companies launching new divisions or developing new business applications are doing so on low-cost Windows NT servers, not on high-priced proprietary systems.\n\nIn short, if you think Compaq is just an assembler and marketer of boxes, you are behind the times. Since taking over the Houston-based Compaq in 1991, Eckhard Pfeiffer has put together the preeminent Wintel computer company, with $25 billion in sales for 1997. No other company-not Dell Computer Corp., not Hewlett-Packard, not IBM-even comes close in the clone business.\n\nUntil a few years ago the definition of a Wintel computer vendor was simple. It was a company using a low-cost operating structure to sell desktop PCs using an Intel microprocessor, Microsoft software and other standard computer components.\n\nToday that still defines most Wintel companies. Firms such as Gateway 2000 and AST Research remain stuck on the desktop.\n\nWhat Compaq has done is extend the Wintel model all the way into the corporate data center, stealing increasing amounts of new business away from the older minicomputer and mainframe companies.\n\nThe vehicle for Compaq's territorial expansion is a \"server,\" a powerful computer designed to sit at the hub of either a network of small desktop machines or other servers. A decade ago a server might have been just another PC, but one that ran a little faster or had more memory than the other PCs in a small departmental network. Nowadays a server from Compaq can be a monster with 4 gigabytes (billions of characters) of random-access memory, 708 gigabytes of disk storage and 9,100 PCs hanging off it; with a price tag of half a million dollars. Alternatively, it might have no attached PCs but simply serve up data to a world of hungry Internet customers. In the rapidly growing intranet and extranet businesses, the two worlds cross in a server that acts as an Internet machine dedicated to a defined group of employees, customers and suppliers.\n\nAs servers grow from departmental machines to corporate central machines, they are turning the computer industry upside down. Older mainframe or minicomputer companies such as Unisys and Digital have already been badly battered. IBM and HP have done better at adapting, but they, too, are under threat from the company in Houston.\n\nConsider these facts:\n\nn Compaq sells as many servers running Windows NT, about 30%, as the next three firms combined.\n\nn Half of all corporate Internet and intranet servers are powered by Windows NT-and are thus fair game to Compaq. Unix ranks second, with about one-third of the market.\n\nn With 1,460 installations through Aug. 31, Compaq ranks behind only HP and IBM in number of servers running SAP's R/3 software. This is the software that integrates the critical databases of a large corporation. Two years ago Compaq did not even show up in the rankings.\n\nn Compaq has edged out EMC to become the second-largest supplier, after IBM, of multiuser storage systems. These are arrays of disk drives that act as a corporate data repository and are often sold in a package with a server.\n\nn A Compaq data processing system runs Nasdaq. That 1.4-billion-share day in October didn't faze it.\n\nCompaq's revenues are still very much tied to the desktop. The company moved 9.5 million PCs last year, which account for about two-thirds of its revenues. As the number one PC clone maker, Compaq can spread its marketing and development costs over a wider base than its competitors can and thus make more money on each PC it sells. Compaq's estimated 1997 net profit margin of 8.4% puts it comfortably ahead of both IBM and Dell. With those profits piling up, Compaq has $6 billion in the bank and almost no debt.\n\nCompaq is now preparing for the next stage in its growth. Its future lies in those Wintel servers that will run Disney outlets and, someday, banks and airlines. How did Compaq transform itself from a company almost wholly dependent on the PC to one that in 1998 will get perhaps $10 billion in revenues from servers.\n\nCredit Eckhard Pfeiffer, the 56-year-old German-born M.B.A. who has been running Compaq since 1991. If your idea of a leader is Steven Jobs, Pfeiffer may not impress you. He speaks in a low monotone that has been known to put listeners in darkened convention rooms to sleep. But he is intense, focused and perfectly at home in the frenetic turmoil of the computer business. \"He demonstrates that you don't have to have a charismatic persona to be a successful chief executive,\" says Noel Tichy, a professor at the University of Michigan Business School who has studied Pfeiffer's management.\n\nPfeiffer joined Texas Instruments at the age of 22 and stayed there for 20 years, rising to vice president of corporate marketing. He joined Compaq in 1983, one year after the company was founded.\n\nWhen venture capitalist Benjamin Rosen engineered the ouster of founder Rod Canion and his replacement by Pfeiffer, Compaq was in crisis. A company that had grown accustomed to a comfortable 35% gross profit margin was under siege from price-cutters like Dell and AST Research.\n\nPfeiffer found a way for the company to live on a 27% gross margin. He slashed prices, making up for the lost revenues by firing nearly a quarter of the work force, or 2,700 employees, and boosted the number of resellers handling Compaq's PCs. Sales responded, climbing from $4.1 billion in 1992 to $7.2 billion in 1993.\n\nBut if Pfeiffer's most visible impact was in the commodity side of the business, his most lasting may prove to be on the other side. Pfeiffer knew that if it was to be more than a box assembler and seller, Compaq would have to graduate from cheap PCs into high-ticket machines that run whole corporations.\n\nCompaq had introduced its first server in 1989, but the product was languishing. \"The server product wasn't a focused organization,\" remembers Pfeiffer. \"It was somewhere on the fringes.\"\n\nWithin weeks of taking command Pfeiffer reorganized the company. He rearranged the functional divisions of the company (manufacturing, sales, engineering) into product divisions (servers, desktops and portables, networking products). Then he told the server division to take itself more seriously. It invested in a technology that it calls PCI Hot Plug, which allows system users to replace disk drives, tape drives and power supplies without having to shut the server down. The division set up partnerships with outfits like Corollary, Inc., which writes the intricate software that allows one server to keep eight Intel processors running simultaneously without bumping into one another.\n\nAlong with Pfeiffer two others deserve credit for turning Compaq into a powerhouse. Neither of them works for Compaq. They are Andrew Grove of Intel and William Gates of Microsoft. Each has come up with products that Compaq has known how to exploit brilliantly.\n\nThe steady march of Moore's Law has meant that a $738 Intel Pentium II microprocessor can do ten times the instructions per second as a mainframe of vintage as recent as 1990. The next generation Merced processor from Intel will be more powerful still.\n\nMicrosoft introduced Windows NT four years ago and since then has steadily improved the product. While NTstill has a ways to go before it offers all of the power of IBM's OS/390 operating system or Sun Microsystem's Solaris, it is clearly headed in that direction. NT Server 5.0, due in 1998, will be able to handle up to 32 gigabytes of main memory, dumb terminals and an improved directory of user names, all essential if NT is going to replace Unix in the very largest server installations.\n\nAdding to NT's capabilities is a growing aftermarket of companies that are developing NT add-on products. One of these is Tandem Computers, which Compaq bought in 1997 for more than $3 billion in stock. Tandem started out two decades ago making fault-tolerant machines that had their own operating system. But Tandem has recently converted its technology to run on NT servers.\n\nThe beauty of Wintel is that Compaq can leverage the research efforts and volume manufacturing of Intel and Microsoft. This allows Compaq, even after its acquisition of Tandem, to keep its research budget at a low 3.5% of sales. By contrast, Sun spends 9.6% on research and Hewlett-Packard spends 7.2%.\n\nWintel's virtue-that it is \"open\" to all computer manufacturers-is also its weakness, from Compaq's point of view. With virtually all the manufacturers acquiring the guts of their machines from Intel and Microsoft, what's to differentiate one machine from another?\n\nNothing, which is why Grove's dictum that you have to be paranoid to survive probably applies even more forcefully in Pfeiffer's business than in Grove's. In the last year Dell has turned around its server business, demonstrating that mail-order sales, which have worked so well with personal computers, could work as well in the low end of the server market.\n\nAt the high end of the server market Compaq faces a challenge from another set of companies. Hewlett-Packard and IBM continue to have an edge over Compaq in selling the largest servers (systems costing over $1 million, capable of managing terabyte databases or handling tens of thousands of banking transactions each day). IBM has been working with banks, petroleum companies and insurance companies for five times as long as Compaq has been in business.\n\nBut its giant rivals will no more be able to crush Pfeiffer's company in servers than they have in PCs. Compaq has economies of scale working in its favor. Compaq is by far the largest customer either Intel or Microsoft has. Because of this, Compaq is assured of getting from both firms the best prices, fastest deliveries and earliest insights into future product plans.\n\n\"From Andy's mouth to Eckhard's ear,\" says Howard Anderson, president of Boston-based market watcher Yankee Group. \"It's kind of like a marriage.\" Compaq also has its choice of dancing partners when NT software vendors look for a computer company to hitch up with.\n\nOne of the most important of these is SAP AG, the German software giant that is the leading supplier of software used to run the operations of large companies. SAP is the fourth-largest software company in the world, growing its revenues at 60% per year.\n\nWhen SAP started, the bulk of its software ran on IBM mainframe computers. That was followed by a period when Unix computers (where Sun Microsystems is big but Compaq is insignificant) were the dominant platform. We are now entering an era in which NT will be the dominant platform for new SAP installations.\n\nIn the third quarter of this year about 450 SAP R/3 software applications, or 45% of the total, were installed on NTmachines. That's up from 25% in 1996. Next year more than half of all shipments are likely to be on NT.\n\nUnix retains a small but dwindling advantage in the very largest R/3 installations. But the difference will be largely irrelevant by the end of 1998, says Jeremy Coote, president of SAP America. By then NT platforms will have gotten more powerful, with the release of NT 5.0 and faster hardware from Intel and its partners, and SAP will have improved its software to run efficiently on a network of medium-size servers instead of one large server.\n\nThe company benefiting most from this move to NT is Compaq. It accounts for nearly half of all NT servers running R/3. It is likely to extend its lead with a new offering it and SAP recently put together called Ready-to-Run R/3. Configuring R/3 on a server has been a complex task that usually required armies of consultants to implement. With Ready-to-Run, SAP and Compaq will configure the software for the customer and ship a system that's one stop short of turnkey.\n\nAs it moves more directly into competition for the heavy stuff, Compaq still has some growing up to do. For one thing it has to ante up for sales and service. An insurance company is not going to buy a $5 million system from a corner store. A bank expects a problem at its ATM network to be corrected in hours, not days. Is Compaq up to the task?\n\nCompaq went a long way toward building up its field sales force when it bought Tandem last year. The acquisition instantly doubled the number of people Compaq had in the field. And the Tandem people had much more experience in the data center than those in Compaq's sales force, who are accustomed to servicing PC retailers.\n\nEven with the Tandem acquisition, Compaq has only 8,000 sales and support people in the field, one-twentieth the number that IBM has. Don't be surprised if Compaq spends some of that cash hoard buying part or all of Digital or Unisys. Digital has 25,000 engineers and support staff in the field.\n\nAnother challenge for Compaq is to broaden its product line, particularly in networking gear. The biggest challenge many companies face is not buying computer servers but finding hardware and software that can tie all of their computers together.\n\nLast year Compaq acquired Microcom, a company that provides devices for remote access. With Microcom's Network in a Box, your branch office can have an Ethernet local area network and high-speed ISDN Internet access for $899. In September Compaq and Intel announced an agreement to jointly develop networking products like switches and hubs. These are the electronic boxes that route data files among computers. Cisco has a commanding lead there-and enviable profit margins.\n\nIn choosing Compaq as our Company of the Year for 1997, we are recognizing more than its swift growth rate and admirable returns. We are recognizing as well the accomplishments of a tall, soft-spoken immigrant who has been known to stride around Compaq's headquarters in cowboy boots. Finally, we are looking beyond the next few years and betting that Pfeiffer can utilize Compaq's current momentum to cement the company's position as a force in the computer business."
