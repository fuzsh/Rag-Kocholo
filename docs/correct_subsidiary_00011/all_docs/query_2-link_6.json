Above table reports Labor Condition Application(LCA) for H1B visa and Labor Certification(LC) for green card filed by Compaq, A Wholly Owned Subsidiary OF HP. The data only indicates the number of applications filed by Compaq, A Wholly Owned Subsidiary OF HP. It does not mean that Compaq, A Wholly Owned Subsidiary OF HP actually got the visa and hired the workers.\n\nOur LCA data includes LCA submitted for not only new employment, but also continuation or change in previously approved employment, new concurrent employment, change in employer and amended petition. Usually, only LCA for new employment needs H1B Visa quota if it is not cap-exempt.\n\nCompaq, A Wholly Owned Subsidiary OF HP has not filed any labor petitions for foreign workers from fiscal year 2021 to 2023. However, Compaq, A Wholly Owned Subsidiary OF HP had applied for LCA for H1B visa or LC for green card before 2012. You can still apply for their new openings. Be sure to contact their HR department or hiring managers for their updated work visa policy.\n\nDepartment of Labor(DOL) typically certifies more than 3 times the number of foreign work requests than the number of H1B visas issued by USCIS. So there is no one to one relationship between the number of workers certified by the DOL and the number of H1B work visas issued by the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS)."
