        "text": "article\n\nBOSTON -- In 1982, Compaq Computer Corp. introduced the first IBM clone, a \"portable\" computer the size of a sewing machine.\n\nWith its $9.6 billion purchase of Digital Equipment Corp. announced yesterday, Compaq itself is looking like an IBM clone.\n\nThe deal gives Compaq a similar range of products that International Business Machines has been using as an entree to the more profitable business of helping big companies set up, run and service their computer networks.\n\n\"We were always the smaller company coming up. Now (the) challenge is to take the No. 2 computer company in the world, integrate all of its components and take it to the next level,\" said Ben Rosen, Compaq's chairman since 1983 and an early investor in the company.\n\nThe deal gives Compaq a way to expand its business and helps Digital keep its 42-year-old name alive and put an end to a decade of red ink and large-scale employee layoffs that have cut its work force in half.\n\n\"I have the highest respect for our employees and their perseverance through some very difficult times,\" said Robert Palmer, Digital's chairman and chief executive. \"I am personally confident that their long-term future is substantially enhanced by this agreement.\"\n\nCompaq already is the world's biggest maker of PCs, but it has spent the last four or five years looking for ways to grow into one of the top three computer manufacturers overall. The Digital deal would make it No. 2 behind IBM.\n\n\"As we mapped out our enterprising strategy, we were looking for the missing pieces,\" Compaq chief executive Eckhard Pfeiffer said at a news conference. \"What else would we build?\"\n\nThe answer big computers that run networks of smaller machines. The types of computers Digital builds.\n\n\"Now we are rounding out the entire spectrum in corporate enterprise computing,\" Pfeiffer said in a telephone interview.\n\nCompaq said it planned to pay $4.8 billion in cash and issue 150 million shares of common stock in the deal announced yesterday. The companies in 1997 had combined revenues of $37 billion and 87,000 employees.\n\nPfeiffer and Palmer said it is too early to talk about the details of cost-saving measures or possible layoffs. Palmer said he plans to stay with the company long enough to ensure a smooth transition.\n\nBoth companies were pioneers in their day, but while Compaq is still riding high, Digital has had a rough decade.\n\nFounded in 1957 in an era of room-size mainframe computers, Maynard-based Digital introduced the world's first minicomputer and first computer time-sharing system in 1963. It rode its PDP and Vax minicomputers to the Fortune 500, and was at one time the world's third-largest computer maker.\n\nBut Digital missed the explosion in the demand for PCs, and lost billions of dollars as it cut its work force from more than 120,000 in 1988 to 54,000 today. Digital had $13.1 billion in revenues last year.\n\nLast fall, Digital sold its network-equipment unit, which supplies technology for routing information between computers, for $430 million to Cabletron Systems Inc. Digital also sold its Alpha microchip manufacturing operations to Intel Corp. for $1.5 billion in an agreement that also settled Digital's copyright infringement suit against Intel.\n\n\"When we look back on Bob Palmer's legacy, it's going to be the dismantling of Digital,\" said Maryfran Johnson, executive editor of ComputerWorld magazine. \"He's essentially sold the company off in bits and pieces.\"\n\nBased in Houston, Compaq ranks fifth in the overall computer industry today with sales of $24.6 billion last year. It has 33,000 employees.\n\nOnly last year, Compaq bought Tandem Computers in a $3 billion stock deal that doubled its sales force.\n\nThe company's first machine, the 32-pound Compaq Portable, rang up $111 million in sales in 1983 and ushered in an era of heady growth. The company took only five years to reach $1 billion in sales and was the fastest in history to make the Fortune 500.\n\nUnder the deal with Compaq, Digital shareholders would get $30 a share in cash and 0.945 Compaq shares for each Digital share.\n\nDigital will become a wholly owned subsidiary as part of the transaction. The deal is subject to approval by shareholders and government antitrust regulators.\n\nCompaq stock was down 8.5 percent yesterday, falling $2.69 to $29.06 on the New York Stock Exchange. Digital stock rose 22 percent, up $9.81 to $55.25."
