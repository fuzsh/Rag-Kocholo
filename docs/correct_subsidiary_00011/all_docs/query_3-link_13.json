        "text": "I worked at Compaq Computer from the late 80’s until the acquisition by HP in 2002. One of the most turbulent times for this amazing company occurred during the early 90’s when Compaq was besieged by low cost competitors from below and the IBM monster above. Compaq encountered significant challenges from these competitors and didn’t really have a clear strategy to combat this new phase of the personal computer market.\n\nI read Rod Canion’s book “Open”, which detailed the remarkable beginning and ascent of Compaq. However, I noticed that the end of his book didn’t really go into much detail regarding the changes that occurred in 1991 and realized that Rod probably didn’t really know many of these details. I read a number of accounts by those that think they know what happened, but the actual story was only known by a few people. Although there was a Wall Street Journal article, that story had some creative license and didn’t include much of the interesting background that occurs when individuals are called on to make critical decisions that ultimately involve the destiny of a company and impact to thousands of employees. The events that occurred at that time, and the profound change in Compaq’s product direction were complicated. Many of these details have never been made available – until now. I decided to write this so that many of my Compaq colleagues from that time would know what actually happened.\n\nThe Setup\n\nI was just finishing the launch of the COMPAQ DESKPRO/M family of products in September, 1991. I was the original product planner for the DESKPRO/M products and I spent 15 months planning and launching the new product line. My team and I presented the products to a number of major account customers prior to launch and while the products were receiving very positive comments on their features and performance, these customers were critical of the high prices that Compaq was known for. The mainstream PC price points were continuing to decline with Compaq being on the extreme high end along with IBM. I identified the trend while doing the planning of the DESKPRO/M and was able to get approval to price the DESKPRO/M lower than prior products. However, low prices from competitors like Dell, AST, Gateway, and others continued to be a step away from where Compaq’s mindset was by expecting gross margins in excess of 40 percent. After dozens of price related comments from customer briefings, I realized that Compaq was missing the boat in the mainstream market and something significant needed to be done.\n\nAt that point I started doing planning work on a lower priced product concept prior to actually handing off the DESKPRO/M to the Product Management team. I felt that starting work on my next project, even though it wasn’t official, was the best way to secure a project that I believed was critically important to Compaq, and one that would be interesting to me. In the meantime, we continued to prepare for the DESKPRO/M launch in New York that was typical of product introductions at the time.\n\nDuring the launch event, at the Marriott Marquis in New York City, I met Ben Rosen, Compaq’s Chairman, and took him through a demo of the DESKPRO/M and its “Intelligent Modularity”. The product line was actually quite different than prior Compaq products. It was an upgradeable product which Compaq had taken a stance against in the past. It was a multi-product launch spanning three Intel processor families which had never been done before as well as including a number of new multimedia features. We also publicized the cost savings approach of the product which had never been an item for discussion. It was a bold product and I think Ben liked that. He was attentive and interested and after the demo and a brief conversation he went on his way.\n\nThe product was announced and production was already underway with strong orders. However, Compaq was facing a number of financial challenges which placed a dark cloud over the excitement of a new product. After returning to Houston I received a call from Ben Rosen’s office asking if I would assist Ben at the Montgomery Securities Conference in San Francisco, where he was going to speak. He wanted me to bring the new DESKPRO/M and demonstrate it to the audience. His admin told me that he was returning to Houston after the conference and I could fly back with him on his jet. I was a young product manager and didn’t exactly know what the protocol was for the Chairman of the Board making such a direct request. I talked to my manager, Lynn Schlemeyer, who also didn’t exactly know what I should do. I believe I had to actually approach her boss, the Vice President of Product Marketing, Lorie Strong, who gave me approval to go to San Francisco and assist Ben.\n\nThe Idea and the Secrets\n\nThe conference didn’t go entirely well for Ben, who was pretty beaten up regarding poor Compaq financials and uncompetitive prices. He seemed pretty tired as we got on his private jet. During the flight, we made small talk about some relatively mundane things. Then, almost out of nowhere, he asked me if I thought it was possible to do “low cost” PC’s. I’m not sure if he already identified me as someone that could do some work for him or if he was just trying to get some answers. Ben was always a very sharp guy. I understood what he was asking. He wasn’t asking if it was just possible, he was asking if it was possible for Compaq. Compaq had become a huge company with an immense engineering organization that was capable of creating amazing products, but did so in an inflexible manner. Much of the engineering management had an NIH (Not Invented Here) mindset which always pushed them to develop everything themselves which guaranteed that it would take a long time and be high cost.\n\nI told Ben that it was absolutely possible for Compaq to create products that were low cost. I mentioned that I already started working on a next generation low cost product concept, but it was not yet approved – either as an actual project or as a project that I would be assigned to. He was interested and asked me to confidentially work on it and update him on the status. He also told me, surprisingly, not to tell anyone about the project, including my management, but to just report back to him.\n\nObviously, a Product Marketing person can’t develop a product alone so I did what came natural and got the best engineering manager I could trust and rely on technically. I had been working for the last year and a half with Jon Thompson, the Engineering Program Manager for the DESKPRO/M, and in the process we became good friends. We began to work on this new project after normal business hours and weekends by contacting suppliers and other technology companies. We created a story to tell these suppliers that we were going to leave Compaq and start our own PC Company. It was amazing how many suppliers approached us and offered help. The extent of the ideas and the pricing they offered us was even more amazing. These were prices that were lower than what Compaq was paying. After a month of this activity we realized that we needed to make more progress than we could accomplish in Houston. Comdex, the largest PC show in the world, was coming up and we thought it would be a great place to meet more suppliers and complete the analysis for Ben.\n\nI wasn’t feeling great about the deception and even tried to fish for some support within Compaq for lower cost products. I approached the Director of Product Management and told him that I had been doing some investigation and discovered that we could get much lower costs if we looked at some outsourced subsystems. He asked me to give an example so I told him that the $90 power supply that Compaq was producing could be sourced for less than $30. He dismissed it replying “I’m sure if there was really that kind of opportunity someone would have already thought about it”, and he walked away. I was floored, and I decided to not risk telling anyone else fearing that it might hurt the effort.\n\nWe contacted Ben and told him that we needed to go to Comdex. Coincidentally, he said that he was going to be leaving for Comdex after a Board meeting in Houston and we were welcome to fly to Las Vegas with him and L. J. Sevin on the Friday prior to the convention. Ben told us that his secretary would handle our travel details for the trip. This was the first year that Compaq had decided not to attend Comdex, for cost cutting reasons, which made it easier for us to not be noticed by anyone from Compaq. Obviously, since Jon and I were not supposed to be working on this project, we had no reason to go to Comdex. So, we took the time off as vacation and hoped nobody from Compaq would see us.\n\nWhen we arrived in Las Vegas we learned that Ben’s secretary wasn’t able to get us a hotel rooms in the city and therefore booked us in a cheap motel near Hoover Dam. She also was unable to get us a rental car, making it a huge problem to get to the motel. However, since both Ben and L. J. each had Cadillacs waiting for them beside the jet, Ben kindly offered up L. J.’s Cadillac for our use, which surprised L.J., and made him a bit uncomfortable. Ben said “It’s ok L. J., you can drive my car, and I’ll ride with you.” You’ve got to love Ben!\n\nDuring the trip we met a number of true PC industry characters, suppliers, odd balls, and even competitors. I met Ted Waite for the first time during this trip and he even offered us some ideas to help us get into the PC business. Ted had a good thing going, and didn’t seem at all threatened by another would-be competitor. As a side note, Gateway and Dell were huge competitors in the direct business. Gateway even came close to surpassing Dell in the direct business in 1993. I met Ted on a number of occasions and I even worked for Michael Dell for a couple of years. They were two vastly different CEO’s. Ted was an easy going, down to earth guy who was very easy to talk to. He was very driven but enjoyed having fun while building a big business.\n\nAfter a day or so it became clear that the distance to our hotel was just too much and we were losing a lot of time traveling around. We decided to find lodging near the strip but there were no rooms available. However, a Western Digital sales person offered to let us stay one night at their demo suite, as long as we were out by 7am so nobody would see us when the staff got there to set up the next day. So, Jon and I slept on rollaway beds in the middle of the WD demo suite with blinking lights and the sounds of hard drives all around us. We were good to our word and were out of the suite well before the first people arrived. The next two nights were spent in a room at the Excalibur, courtesy of an SCI salesperson that had to go home early. Luckily, it was a double room so we were pretty comfortable. For three nights, we didn’t have a single hotel room expense and the two nights at the cheap motel probably cost us less than $100 total. Along with the free use of the Cadillac, courtesy of L. J. Sevin, we were seriously doing things on the cheap. This even contributed to our story about starting our own business. Obviously, if we were doing this as a formal Compaq project, we would have had hotel rooms on the strip but wouldn’t have gotten anywhere near the assistance from the suppliers as Compaq employees.\n\nOur goal for the show was simple. We needed to talk to as many vendors as possible, get as many samples as we could, and get pricing on everything. The prices were all very low compared to what we had at Compaq. Not only were the prices low but terms and conditions were unbelievable. We had vendors willing to throw in free engineering, free tooling, and extended terms until we “got on our feet.” All that we were told, saw, and learned would have been impossible if we were wearing our Compaq badges.\n\nAfter two days of the show we were scheduled to meet with Ben at his hotel room on Tuesday, October 22rd. When we got there he was packing, which caused us some concern since he was our ride home. He asked how we have been and we told him that we made tremendous progress. He then told us that he needed to go back to Houston early and we would need to come with him or get other travel arrangements. He said that Compaq was going to have a big layoff and he needed to go back to review it with the Board. This was Compaq’s first layoff ever. It was shocking to us but not altogether unexpected given the recent financial situation. He then asked us if we might be on the layoff list which caused Jon and I to just look at each other. Quite honestly, until that moment I had never considered that I might get laid off. I told him that I didn’t think so but you never know. He told us that he would check and make sure we were ok. We had a couple of meetings scheduled for the day and were still expecting to get additional samples to take. We asked Ben to give us until 3pm and we could get our business taken care of. He gave us until 2pm and we made a mad dash for the convention floor where we were able to complete our final meetings and get more product samples.\n\nAs we loaded several boxes of equipment onto Ben’s plane he commented “Did you guys go shopping?” It was indeed a surprising amount of equipment. As we climbed out to our cruising altitude we started pulling out the products and explained to Ben the types of products we could get. I also showed him a summary of a costed bill of materials for a few models that I had quickly sketched onto an Excalibur hotel notepad. Due to our early departure I didn’t get enough time to put this information on something more formal. We showed sample costs and estimated street pricing for a high end desktop, a low end desktop, and even a notebook. I was extremely familiar with the current Compaq product costs and was able to give him comparisons. Ben was elated with the positive progress but also visibly upset with why he hadn’t ever seen this type of information from anyone else. The level of his disgust with the Compaq status quo and optimism with his viewpoint was only about to be seen. As we landed in Houston, he asked us to come to his hotel room at the Ritz-Carlton (now the St. Regis) for further discussion.\n\nAs Jon and Ben sat in the living room of the large suite, I sat at the desk and put together a more presentable business plan from my scant notes on the Excalibur notepads. Unexpectedly, there was a knock on the door and to my amazement it was Eckhard Pfeiffer, the recently appointed President of Compaq. Eckhard had only been in the job for a few months taking over for Mike Swavely who had recently retired. I had been in several meetings with him, and most recently saw him at the DESKPRO/M announcement. Eckhard sat down and Ben began explaining what we had been up to. To this day I’m still unsure whether Eckhard had some prior knowledge of the activity. We showed him the various samples that we had obtained. I gave Eckhard a summary of the product value proposition along with showing him the product plan that I had been sketching out since my arrival at the hotel. Eckhard was his typical self, listening patiently and asking occasional questions to better understand our proposition. We even talked about how to launch the products and whether they should be a first line sub brand or have a “by Compaq” branding. Eckhard told us that this was a serious topic and we needed to make sure that it wouldn’t hurt the Compaq brand and image. He emphasized that he liked the work but we needed to give the whole effort more thought on the execution.\n\nI worked all night on the “Product Plan” as well as part of the next day. At Compaq, a “Product Plan” included sections on Product Definition, Market Sizing, Trends, Customer Attributes, Target Markets, Positioning, Pricing, Forecast, Risks, and a complete financial roll up for the product over time. I was fairly comfortable with the plan, given my earlier prep work, although I didn’t spend nearly as much time on it as I had on previous products that I did at Compaq. My planning time for the DESKPRO/M plan took about six months and the PORTABLE 486/C took about five months. Typically, after the planning phase the product would be presented for approval to the strategy committee, which included Rod Canion. Upon approval, projects would then proceed towards implementation.\n\nAfter completing the Product Plan, I printed it and gave a copy to Ben Rosen along with the file on a floppy disk. The Board was meeting that day and Ben wanted to discuss it with Rod. My hope was that Rod would be in favor of the concept and assign me to continue working on it as a formal project. This would have been great for me in several ways. I would be working on a project that I felt very passionate about and it might position me for more responsibilities in the future. In any case it was only a matter of time to see what transpired at the board meeting between Ben and Rod. I was anxious but very optimistic.\n\nHigh Stakes in the Boardroom\n\nIt was around 8pm on Thursday that Ben finally called me in my office. Keep in mind, we didn’t have cell phones back then so I was just hanging out in my office waiting for an update. Jon was there as well and I was thrilled when we got the call. Ben told us that it had been a tough day and that he had the discussion with Rod. “Yes!” I thought to myself. Ben told Rod that he had initiated his own investigation into Compaq developing lower cost computers. I was thrilled that this was finally presented to Rod so I asked “what did Rod say?” Ben said that “Rod was very interested and wanted to get more information on what we came up with.” This sounded great so I asked him what happened then. Ben responded by saying “I told Rod that it wasn’t the responsibility of the Chairman to do the CEO’s job!” At that point, my heart was in my stomach. A sick feeling came over me and I then realized that this was going in a direction that I never, ever imagined. It was at that point that I realized things were going to change in a big way, for everyone. The change in demeanor and tone that Ben had after this point was noticeable. He knew which direction he was going well before the board meeting and his plan was now being executed. I was a relatively young business person but this was my first lesson in big, REALLY BIG, corporate politics at the highest level, and executed by a master. I now believe that after our first meeting in New York, Ben identified me as someone that could help him come up with new alternatives to the current path that Compaq was on.\n\nI don’t want to give the wrong impression about Ben. I don’t think he ever tried to deceive me even though I was deceived. I think he had a huge concern about the company and I was a person that could help him bring out the truth. I wasn’t experienced enough or questioning enough to understand the full depth of his mission and he wasn’t interested in explaining it all to me. The fact was, I was a product specialist and business manager that was able to see the things that should be and didn’t really focus on the bigger corporate politics anyway. There are people that have told me that they felt that Ben put me in a bad position. Honestly I think Ben did what he needed to do and I did what I thought was critically important for Compaq. I understood the magnitude of the effort but over my entire career I have always been comfortable with taking on big, crazy, aggressive initiatives\n\nThe next day was infamous. It was announced that Rod was fired and Eckhard Pfeiffer was the new CEO. Over the following week details about our secret project were communicated to the new executive team. During the meeting, where my boss’s boss was attending, Ben explained our role in the effort and then told everyone that we were following orders from the board and that if anyone sought to punish us for that effort he and Eckhard would personally get involved to remove them from the company. It was remarkably strong language. Eckhard made the determination that since this had started as a skunk works and made good progress we should continue to operate independent of the standard Compaq product divisions. We were called the IBU (Independent Business Unit) and were placed under the leadership of Richard Swingle, reporting to Doug Johns. Our offices were then relocated to a relatively remote location in the back of the Compaq Distribution Center.\n\nThe Work Begins\n\nOur mission was clear but not certain. We were working to create a new low cost line of PC’s targeting the traditional commercial channels as well as the relatively new retail consumer channels. From a product standpoint everything was open for redefinition. We looked at new colors, form factors, and software bundles. Up that that point someone buying a Compaq PC had to buy the operating system and video card separately and have it installed by the dealer or internal IT department. We made a decision to pre-install everything needed to have the product up and running right out of the box. We didn’t come up with this idea since many of our competitors had been doing the same for some time already.\n\nThe location behind the Distribution Center was interesting as we overlooked the trash bins. We could see the huge tractor trailer trash bins filled with materials from the Compaq manufacturing line. It was the scrap that is typical in a manufacturing overhead expense that ultimately adds cost to each product. The sight of these bins overflowing with wasted materials, and cost, continually reminded us of the excess costs that were inherent in the legacy business.\n\nWe had plenty of fights with vendors and internal Compaq organizations that really wanted us to fail. We changed the core supplier base for a number of commodities. We selected Quantum as a new drive supplier over Conner Peripherals. Compaq had an investment in Conner and they made up a large percentage of Compaq’s hard drives. I remember a meeting with Conner’s VP of Sales. He told me that he didn’t have the drive capacities I wanted nor could he support my aggressive price targets. He said that I would “have to take” what he had. I told him that we were sticking to the original requirements and if he didn’t have right products Conner would not get the business. I could tell that most of the Compaq people in the room remained quiet and were more supportive of Conner’s position than mine. It was less than an hour later that I received a call from Ben Rosen. He said that he just got off the phone with Finis Conner (Conner’s CEO and Founder). Ben and Finis were close, personal friends. Apparently Finis got on the phone with Ben immediately after the meeting and told Ben that Conner was not going to get the business. Ben asked me what I said. I told Ben the “I said that Conner shouldn’t worry as long as they had the best product at the best price”. There was a moment of silence and then Ben said “Ok, great. Keep up the good work”. I was shocked but this was a huge level of support for us. I have known executives who would have given the business to their long-time partner and friend even if it was detrimental to the business. Not Ben! Ben had a goal and I don’t think that any friendship would have gotten in the way of making the right decision.\n\nOne significant financial aspect of our preparation was never written about (to my knowledge). During our effort to launch the lower cost product lines, the volumes we forecasted were significantly larger than what the financial organization was comfortable loading into the system. Therefore, the overhead per unit was a fixed number equal to the current, highly inflated, overhead burden per unit. When the financial systems would run, the lower pricing of our products along with the high overhead allocation, showed a significant loss for the business. This information was used by the status quo to try and show that we were going to kill the company. I’m not sure if it was a concerted effort to kill our project or if it was their weak financial aptitude. When these numbers were presented, month after month, I could only say, “Just wait! The system will catch up with us.” I had faith in our estimates and the knowledge that extended beyond the current accounting systems. After a couple of stressful months defending the “New Business Model” of lower prices, and lower gross margins, the financial systems finally showed the accurate forecasts. It showed a significantly lower overhead allocation per unit which helped all of the product lines. Compaq now had a forecast with significantly improved financial performance but this didn’t happen until less than three months from launch. Credit needs to go to upper management and Eckhard for their patience and confidence. Although, there wasn’t a Plan B so maybe everyone was just hanging on hope.\n\nThe Payoff\n\nWe ended up announcing the COMPAQ ProLinea in June 1992 with a big launch event at the Ed Sullivan Theater (soon to be home of the David Letterman show) in New York City. That morning, I got up early to get a Wall Street Journal at the corner store. There it was. The story of how all of this happened was on the front page. This was one of two exclusives on the story and was written by Michael Allen of the Wall Street Journal. His documentation was fairly accurate but obviously missed some of the points that I documented in this piece. The event was a turning point in the history of Compaq. No longer would anyone credibly say that Compaq was only a high priced PC company. Compaq now had a good, better, best strategy with the ProLinea in the good position and my prior product, the DESKPRO/M, in the best position. As a side note, the “better” product was the DESKPRO/I which was planned and launched by Blake Irving, now CEO of Go Daddy. The server business at Compaq had not kicked in yet so the Desktop PC business was a predominant share or the business. The DESKPRO/M and ProLinea, products that I planned and launched accounted for probably over $2 billion of Compaq’s $4 billion of revenue in 1992.\n\nThere was one other aspect to the execution of this strategy which related to the competition. Change didn’t just happen for Compaq. Competitors like Dell, Gateway, and AST, who had enjoyed a relatively large price cushion based on Compaq’s high prices, quickly felt the pressure. With Compaq’s good, better, best PC strategy they were ill prepared to compete at each level. Dell had two product lines which basically fell in the better and best categories and couldn’t compete at the low end with the Compaq Prolinea and when they had to cut prices to compete, it killed their margins. The noose started to tighten on them and the other PC vendors with this unexpected barrage from Compaq. Dell lost money one year later, in their second quarter of 1993, and narrowly escaped demise with another aggressive strategy that I worked on. That, however, is a story for another time (A Hated Man: Winning, Losing, and the Resurgence of Dell)\n\nCompaq was now positioned with highly competitive product lines from bottom to top and was positioned for significant growth. In fact, the fourth quarter of 1993 showed revenue of $1.4 billion, an increase of 64% over the prior year. 1993 revenues were over $7 billion, more than double the 1991 sales number. Over the next several years, Compaq added its muscle in the server business. If not for the change in direction, who knows what would have happened and whether or not they would have had the patience to continue investing in the server business that ultimately gave them the runway to become the premiere PC Company in the world along with giving the server division enough runway to succeed, and thereby setting the foundation for what is now the new HP Enterprise Company."
