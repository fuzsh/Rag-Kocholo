        "text": "Abstract\n\nWhen the $19 billion merger of Silicon Valley legend Hewlett-Packard and Houston-based PC giant Compaq Computer Corp. legally closed on May 3, 2002, both companies had already devoted an immense amount of time preparing for the challenges that lay ahead. Chief among these challenges was avoiding the culture clashes that often accompany large mergers. This issue was particularly relevant given the very different cultures of HP and Compaq. This case provides an inside view of the integration planning process undertaken to create \"The New HP,\" highlighting the work of the integration office, known as \"the cleanroom,\" and the human resources team of HP vicepresident Jackie Kane. Also describes the dilemma facing one division manager, Rich Marcello, who struggled with the implications of a clean room decision.\n\nKeywords\n\nCitation\n\nPerlow, Leslie A., and Elizabeth Kind. \"New HP, The: The Clean Room and Beyond.\" Harvard Business School Case 404-064, February 2004."
