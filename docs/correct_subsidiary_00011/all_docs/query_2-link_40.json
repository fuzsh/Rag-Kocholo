        "text": "HOUSTON, June 27, 2001 – Compaq Computer Corporation (NYSE: CPQ) announced today that Con Edison Communications has chosen Compaq to provide advanced network and services management solutions for its \"last mile\" optical fiber-based network. Con Edison Communications' new network will provide large carrier customers in the New York metropolitan area with the high capacity needed for broadband services. Con Edison Communications is a wholly owned subsidiary of Consolidated Edison, Inc. (NYSE:ED)\n\nAs systems integrator, Compaq is managing the effort to build the industry's most advanced network and services management solution. The centerpiece is Compaq's TeMIP (Telecommunications Management Information Platform), the industry-leading network and services management solution for multi-vendor and multi-technology environments.\n\nIn Phase I-A, TeMIP provides standard management of faults, alarms and problem resolution. In Phase I-B, Compaq will link TeMIP with powerful mapping technology, which shows the precise physical location of all cables and fibers in the network. With the linkage, Con Edison Communications will be able to identify problems, locate them, and dispatch repair crews quickly, thus maintaining maximum network availability.\n\nCompaq will expand this capability to meet broader OSS (Operation Support System) requirements, including provisioning and service activation, customer relationship management (CRM) with Service Level Agreement (SLA) management and billing. For example, the TeMIP-based solution will enable Con Edison Communications to provision and activate new services automatically - thus saving valuable time. This is an industry first for multi-vendor optical broadband networks.\n\nMore information on Compaq TeMIP is available at http://www.compaq.com/temip <\\p>\n\nAbout Compaq\n\nCompaq Computer Corporation, a Fortune Global 100 company, is a leading global provider of technology and solutions.
