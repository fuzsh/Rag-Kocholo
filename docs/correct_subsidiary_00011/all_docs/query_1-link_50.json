        "text": "Digital Equipment Corporation, or DEC, was a large computer company (at one time, the second-largest in the world after IBM). They made minicomputers, their signature product (and the one that led to their success), for a period, the most popular kind of computers in the world. Their product range eventually extended from small mainframes to personal computers.\n\nIt was started in 1957, in an old wool mill in Maynard, Massachusetts. The original product line was modules, System Modules. Once those were established, they started producing computers using them.\n\nThey reached the peak of their success in the 1980s, with their VAX line. However, they were unable to successfully adapt to the rise of personal computers, which turned computers into commodities, and were bought by Compaq in 1998.\n\nSee also\n\nList of Programmed Data Processors\n\nTaxonomy of DEC consoles\n\nDEC indicator panel\n\nDEC Semiconductor Chips\n\nDEC part numbers\n\nDEC engineering drawing numbers\n\nDEC Software-related Order Codes\n\nEdited Option/Module List\n\nDEC acronyms\n\nDEC Documentation Errors\n\nDEC Hardware\n\nDEC Boards\n\nDEC Architectures\n\nDEC Buses\n\nDEC Systems\n\nDEC Processors\n\nDEC Memories\n\nDEC Peripherals\n\nDEC Storage Controllers\n\nDEC Disk Drives\n\nDEC Tape Drives\n\nDEC Terminals\n\nDEC Software\n\nDEC Operating Systems\n\nDEC Modules by bus\n\nDigital Technical Journal\n\nFurther reading\n\nGlenn Rifkin, George Harrar, The Ultimate Entrepreneur: The Story of Ken Olsen and Digital Equipment Corporation, Contemporary, Chicago, 1988 - The best general history of DEC, but stops at 1987\n\nEdgar H.
