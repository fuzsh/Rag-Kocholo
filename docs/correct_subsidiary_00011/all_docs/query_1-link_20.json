        "text": "In the largest takeover in the history of the computer industry, Compaq Computer Corp. agreed Monday to buy Digital Equipment Corp. for $9.6-billion in cash and stock.\n\nThe takeover marked the ascendancy of personal computers over the behemoths that had dominated computing in the 1970s. It also signaled that the future of the industry lies not in small computers alone but in integrated networks in which machines that span the full ranges of size, price, scale and power are linked in hybrid digital systems.\n\nParadoxically, that is an approach invented more than a decade ago by IBM. Now, Compaq, which was IBM's first serious competition in the personal computer market, is poised to take on IBM's lucrative systems and services businesses.\n\nWhen Compaq was founded in 1982 to make portable \"clones\" of the personal computer that IBM had recently introduced, Digital reigned as the nation's No. 2 computer maker, producing powerful machines that were favorites of academic researchers and respected by large corporations.\n\nBut the computer industry has been turned on its head in the last 15 years. Today, Compaq is the top maker of personal computers while Digital's star has been falling. The deal announced Monday, coupled with its recent purchase of Tandem, a maker of high-end mainframes, will make Compaq the No. 2 computer maker in the world, behind IBM, producing everything from the smallest laptops to some of the largest mainframes.\n\nIn fact, Compaq's chief executive, Eckhard Pfeiffer, has made no secret of his desire to compete at all levels with IBM.\n\nThe two companies have taken mirror-image paths to their present positions. In the early 1980s, mainframe-maker IBM decided to dabble in the personal computer market. It ended up ceding control of the new industry to the maker of its operating system, Microsoft Corp., and the maker of its central processing unit, Intel Corp.\n\nBy contrast, Compaq started with small systems, slowly building a business that is now similar in scope to IBM's.\n\nDigital itself was once seen as IBM's main challenger and a cornerstone of the high technology corridor that surrounded Boston on Route 128. But just as Digital had thrived by building minicomputers that were cheaper than IBM's huge mainframes, Compaq and other PC makers built machines so inexpensive and accessible that they have earned a place on nearly every office desk and in many homes as well.\n\nLike almost every company of its generation, Digital continued to offer its own proprietary computer designs and software, and it was late and unsuccessful in its attempts to enter the market for PCs built around standard designs. In recent years, Digital's sales have declined, and losses have been as common as profits.\n\nStill, Digital offered an inviting takeover target. It has technology, a cadre of engineers and salespeople, and a roster of customers that have become attractive to Compaq as it now tries to expand beyond the highly competitive, low-margin personal computer market into the more lucrative business of larger network systems and work stations.\n\nOne of the most hotly contested technology battles of the coming decade will be over who controls the very large computer systems, now typically IBM mainframes, that keep track of bank accounts, airline reservations and the like.\n\nCompaq and others are gambling that computers built on standard PC technology _ with chips from Intel and network operating systems from Microsoft _ will evolve the computing muscle to take on IBM's mainframe-based systems.\n\nThose with the most to lose from Compaq's growth are the other makers of mid-size computers, including Sun Microsystems and Hewlett-Packard, both of which have their eye on big systems.\n\n\"Compaq's deal should make IBM sweat a little,\" said Steven Milunovich, an analyst with Merrill Lynch. \"but HP should sweat more.\"\n\nThe merger was negotiated quickly for a deal of this size. The first face-to-face meeting between company executives was Jan. 15, and most of the details were worked out last weekend.\n\nOn the New York stock exchange, Compaq's shares fell by $2.75 to $29, while Digital's shares rose $10 to $55.4375 Monday.\n\nComputer powerhouse\n\nCompaq Computer Corp. is buying Digital Equipment Corp. for $9.6-billion in a deal that creates a powerhouse selling a variety of computer products from consumer PCs to networked business machines.\n\nCOMPAQ\n\n1997 sales: $24.6-billion\n\nHeadquarters: Houston\n\nEmployees: 18,900\n\nStock price 52-week high-low: $39.75-$14.13\n\nStock price Monday: -$2.75 $29\n\nRecent acquisition: Tandem Computers Inc., August 1997\n\nDIGITAL\n\n1997 sales: $13.05-billion\n\nHeadquarters: Maynard, Mass.\n\nEmployees: 54,900\n\nStock price 52-week high-low: $53.81-$25\n\nStock price Monday: $10 $55.44\n\nSource: Companies report"
